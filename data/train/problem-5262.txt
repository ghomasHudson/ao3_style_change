“Is she giving you trouble lately?” Dean asked. Cas sighed.
“I thought we had gotten past this phase, Squirrel, not that I’m not thrilled to see a renaissance,” Crowley said and Dean let him go abruptly. He looked away.
“She’s the spitting image of you both,” Rowena offered, brand new tenderness to her voice. He turned to face her on the other side of the library. She was in a pale pink slip and a silky robe, her bright red hair falling out of a long braid. He had never found her beautiful before then but she truly was, lit in the lamplight of the library. He didn’t know where the gentleness was coming from towards her but he was suddenly glad she was with his brother. It made sense, he thought, considering how hot and cold she burned. He furrowed his brow though and acknowledged none of his sudden familial emotions.
“You don’t know anything,” Dean brushed off.
“He’s… an old friend,” Cas explained. “Why is he so angry?” The little boy continued and Cas pursed his lips.
“That doesn’t matter right now,” Dean insisted and gathered Cas into his arms, preparing to take him from the house. “All that matters is getting you out.”
“I was just thinking,” Jack said to him one day, voice tentative and echoing against the metal of their prison. “The man- your friend- the fisherman?”
The money was wired to him quietly from a “Leia Tolkein,” who he soon realized was Charlie. It was a lot and certainly not from any legal means. The memo with it was “expect this every few months, don’t worry about things.” He had wondered for a while how she could have possibly known then he remembered that on a recent phone call with Jody, she had intuited his dilemma and suddenly everything clicked into place. He knew exactly who Jody would’ve called if she thought he needed money. And that person would’ve known he was too proud to take any money from him of all people. Despite himself, Cas smiled at the money. It was a step he thought, a weird step after everything, but a step.
Jack was overjoyed when he went up for his diploma and spotted Dean in the audience. He waved his typical little wave and Dean had waved back. Cas felt too overwhelmed to speak. When the ceremony was over he had hugged them both, pulling them together and Cas wasn’t crying because he wouldn’t let Dean Winchester see him cry especially right then but it was taking everything in him to not.
“Yes. I want to be there, for you and for the kid. I’ve never wanted anything more,” Dean told him. Cas couldn’t let himself believe it, that this would be happening.
Jack sighed a little and was quiet for a minute, raising a toy over the cat’s head. Then he turned back to Dean, a contemplative look on his face. It was a strange moment and Dean turned to face him then, shocked by how wise beyond his years the kid could look.
Those words would have been heavy on Anna maybe forty, thirty, even ten years ago. That day they were nothing. She’d written it all down. It was gone from her now.
with you?!” Cas had found himself screaming at Dean endlessly and was faced with nothing but a passive aggressive grunt and a shrug of the shoulders. That had only made him angrier. “Look at me! Look at me! I’m crying! I’m crying and your son is crying and I know you love us so fucking say something! Do something to fix this!”
“If we hadn’t found you…” Dean began.
“Never,” Cas told him. Lucifer grabbed his chin with his other hand then, and forced his face closer.
he thought,
“I didn’t want to ask you anything.”
“Cousin,” said Ishim and Gabriel found something stomach churning in his voice, always had, “you cannot give Castiel the care he needs. You’re not a doctor.”
“I don’t know if you should trust what my sister says. It was dark. An inky darkness tonight. You saw it. And she has a tendency to...embellish. She’s done it since we were children,” Cas paused. “I grew up with Dean Winchester, he’s my best friend and one of the best men I’ve ever known. He wouldn’t do a thing like this. Not ever, I’m sure of it. It’s not in his nature. You’d realize that if you spoke to him for just one second. He would never intentionally hurt another soul.”
“Sure,” he said.
“Please,” had been all Jack had been able to quietly get out, shaking lips, innocent eyes, a creature so good and so harmless that the injustice of it all crashed hard into Cas once again. The angels, however, didn’t seem to see it that way, and simply pushed the shaking body into the box laid before him. When confronted with that, as they began to drag him towards the sea and Cas away back towards the house, only then did Jack begin to cry. “No! Dad! Dad, please! Don’t let them!”
Cas looked at him. The last time this man had been on his knees before him, looking this defeated, this helpless, it had been in the crypt. And yet again, Cas was the one inflicting the pain upon him.
“What do you mean?” He asked again, Rowena went over to him, her wide legged pants swishing along with her.
“I loved you!” Cas screamed back at him. He dropped to his knees then, his face covered in his hands, dissolving into tears. “Oh god, I love you.”
“It’s nothing. Just give it to him. Please.”
“Oh yes?” He asked. “What will you do? Lock me away and shut me up like Cas. I’m afraid I’m not an invert myself so you won’t have much grounds.”
“And maybe that made me inclined to hope, I don’t know. Maybe that was stupid,” Cas trailed off a little. Dean stood up, uncomfortable, out of control, wanting to get as far away from this sort of conversation as possible. “You say all those things, imply all these promises, and now you won’t go near me. Me or him.”
“Speak different? I don’t mean to stop ya there, but you speak just like them. Have since you were in school. I’m the only one about here who speaks a lick different.”
He understood the terms of the agreement, and trapped in a box with only his child and Dean’s prayers for company wasn’t so different from the reality of their love beforehand. They were to never speak of these things, never to kiss or caress. They could never have a life together, Dean would not have allowed that. The plan was to suffer in silence and live beside one another and think that to be enough. It wasn’t enough, it had never been enough, but Cas would take what he could get.
Anna didn’t know what to say to that but it was clear Ruby wanted her to say something, the way she stood there, her hands on her hips and her lips pursed.
“If I called you every time I thought of you I would barely do anything else,” Dean admitted before he could stop himself. He left then, hurriedly, terrified to get a response.
“Fuck you, old man,” Claire mutterd into him. “Fuck you leaving us all like that. Fuck you.”
They went downstairs and Cas sat at the kitchen counter as Dean started on breakfast, nervously chattering with Cas as he did so. It wasn’t long before Jack stumbled downstairs in his pajamas, looking just a bit hungover.
“Well, it’s a free drink so shut up or get out,” Dean grumbled and Crowley laughed dryly.
“Didn’t get a chance to take a shower since I got back from the shop,” Dean admitted. “Worked late, had to put up dinner for my old man, then he got me wrapped up in beer and conversation as I said, then hopped in the car and came all the way here. I can hop in the shower now, if you want.”
some vamp or witch or whatever Dean had played it down as. For one thing, where he was being kept there was also Jack, gagged and restrained with Enochian handcuffs, and there were a significant amount of wardings against angels. The room was dark and hard to make out anything in the corners. The room seemed to be made of metal and he noticed a creaking sound and a swaying sensation. They were on a boat, he realized. He himself was just tied up like the human he now was, and Jack was passed out a ways from him, he struggled at his own bonds to get to him, trying to overcome the sinking feeling in his stomach at the worrying amount of blood on Jack’s face. He called Jack’s name, getting more and frantic until his son’s eyes slid open. He exhaled just a little then, their blue eyes locking together.
“He was just saying hello, mummy,” Cas said quietly. “I don’t think there’s much of a problem.”
Things changed a little after that. Jack was probably going to go to college next year, he knew, and after everything Cas began to loosen on some things. He told Dean he could visit more, stay in the motel in town and spend days with Jack. Over the summer he even said they could go on weekend trips together, though any hunting was absolutely out of the question. Cas still did his best to stay away from him. It still hurt. Hell, he still turned the radio off if “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” came on. But he knew that Dean and Jack needed each other. And it made Jack happy beyond words. Dean even convinced Cas to let Jack spend the long weekend for Columbus Day with him once the school year started, saying he could afford to blow off work on his college essay for a weekend.
“Our mom, she’s helping them hunt up in Canada, him and his sister Alicia,” Sam added.
“How was it worth it?” Jack couldn’t believe anything was worth getting hurt. Especially if his father wasn’t there to patch him up and kiss it better right afterwards.
“I don’t know, that’s more Dean’s domain,” Cas replied and looked at the man standing a pace away. Dean’s face had none of the lightness to Jack’s and in fact there was something strange and hard behind his eyes that confused him. Dean came up onto the porch.
“No! No! Please! Please! Please! You can't do this to him! No one deserves this! Please don't do this to my son!” He screamed, fighting against his bonds, hysterical tears beginning to leave his eyes. “Let him go! Don’t TOUCH him! Let him go or I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you all! Jack!
He sank to his knees, still clutching the letter tight. He would come to his senses in a moment, he assumed. Be terrified that Anna saw it, that she showed it to who? Gabriel? Mummy? He couldn’t say. But in that moment, it was his. He had nothing else to worry about but those hilariously vulgar words. So simple there was no misconstruing. He had an urge to wring his hands and say “so that’s that.” It was all suddenly so simple.
“But it’s not true. You don’t fully atone at all. You left out some very important details,” Sam said.
“That doesn’t prove anything.”
It didn’t help that Jack truly
“Get their bags,” Mrs.Milton called to Dean, who went to work on carrying the trunks upstairs. “It’s lovely to have all three of you here.”
“You feel that now… I felt it for years. But one day I had to leave my home behind too,” his father said and Jack looked up at him curiously.
“I don’t know. I don’t
It was most apparent everytime John came by. That first time, back when Jack was two and Claire was thirteen, Claire had been like a wary little guard dog, yapping at his heels and always keeping herself between him and Cas and Jack. The second time, a year later, she had seemed more relaxed as the first visit had gone mostly without incident. Only it had been that second visit when the incident with Jack had occurred, and he knew Claire blamed herself for letting her guard down, despite the number of talking tos Dean had given her, emphasizing how much it wasn’t her fault.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked..
“That’s only in the worst of cases,” Ishim explained. “Usually it just placates them.”
“You’re the only person he’s ever let me see,” Jack quietly told him. “I think you’re special to him. And I miss you when you go.”
“Me too.”
“Oh just you wait and see,” Gabe laughed. “Well, why don’t we three take a swim before dinner, ought to cool us down. If we don’t I think I’ll die in this heat.”
He fixed their broken fence posts a week later and changed all the light bulbs the weekend after that. He spent an entire two weeks repainting the exterior of the house as it was chipping like no tomorrow and another week doing the whole insides, going over in the chipper yellow that Cas favored. They mostly kept out of each other’s hair, he assumed Cas found it understandably hard to see him, and he saw more of Jack than he did of Cas. He tried to be wary of him but it was hard with the little boy barrelling into his legs to greet him when he came by and hitting with a million rambled questions that he needed answered right away. He had begun to bring things along for him even, leftovers from his meal at a diner or some book he’d picked up in town or an action figure he saw in a shop window. Things Cas always said Jack had to say thank you for and eyed suspiciously once they were handed over but the child seemed to instantly cherish, collecting proudly in his room. For his part, Jack was often handing him little drawings or clay figures he’d made during the day that Dean would grunt out a thanks to and then tuck them safely into his memory box.
“I’m really glad he’s taking that gap year,” Dean admitted and Cas nodded.
He was back two days later claiming the faucet seemed leaky and spent a whole day fixing and unfixing it just to keep up conversation with Jack who climbed up onto the counter and watched him work, swinging his small legs off the edge and explaining the plots of his favorite picture books in detail to Dean. Cas had come by with lemonade and a critical look but mostly gotten out of his hair.
It was a shame, Anna thought, a shame. And she closed the book and checked her reflection again. Strangely, she noticed she was crying, and laughed a little wiping it away.
“You saw him?” Anna could tell just from Ruby’s asking that she would believe her.
“But you’re going to come soon?” Jack asked one final time.
Cas had already tucked Jack into bed that evening when he heard the knock at the door. There was a long nighttime routine to get through, reading him
Cas didn’t respond. Dean cleared his throat.
“What do you do, Mister Ketch?” Anna asked to break the tension, knowing the answer anyway.
,” she retorted with a quirk of her eyebrow. “That seems unlikely.”
“But I should be.”
,” she laughed dryly, and then gazed back at her reflection. “Maybe I need powder, I think I look rather flushed.”
“What were you waiting here for then,” asked Dean, “if not for me?”
“Don’t you dare be sorry for me! I’m not sorry! I love you. I love you. You can hate me or kill me but you can’t stop me,” Cas told him. He looked up at Dean and his blue eyes were shining and defiant and then Dean sunk to his own knees in front of him. He reached out for him. Cas seemed to shirk from his touch for one moment, but let Dean go to him eventually, running his fingers through his hair as Cas continued sobbing into his hands.
“Well, if it makes you feel any better I insisted they pick a vegetable,” Cas said. “They should have a balanced diet.”
“This is just a… a little youthful rebellion. Good for a bit but now it’s time to grow up, you hear me?” Lucifer told him. Jack shook his head.
“What’d you guys order for dinner?” Dean asked but Cas shook his head.
“They’re scary. They hurt me,” Jack told him. “They twisted my arm.”
“Did my dad send you? Did Castiel?” Jack asked and she chewed her lip.
She turned her head from the window and looked at him, his eyes still resolutely on the road.
“I’m not gonna…” Dean trailed off. He didn’t know what he was going to say. Afraid of any promise that might come out. Jack tugged on Cas’s ear with his fingers causing Cas to yelp slightly.
He was watching Jack play in the backyard, a few feet away, digging around the worms with a stick, keeping himself occupied in the way only children can. He hadn’t spoken to him much but had taken to this as a sort of middleground, sitting a few feet away and just watching Jack at whatever he was doing, intaking the little commentary or stories he gave as he did it. He looked at Jack curiously for a second, it was scary just how alike he and Cas were. He couldn’t picture Cas as a child like this but he was beginning to assume it must have existed somehow.
“What’s going on? Who are they?” Jack asked.
“Alright?” Cas asked, looking back down at him.
“Not Sam,” Anna took a breath. “Dean. It was Dean.”
“I don’t think I’d want to love anyone more than you, daddy,” Jack said and his father laughed.
“Ummmm…” she said and then turned and called out, “Dean! He’s in here!”
“I get angry like that too, like I don’t have the words for what it is but…” he tried to force himself to keep talking, to spit it out. He couldn’t stop then, not when he was so close. “Sometimes I feel like you’re going to burn me alive.”
“It’s only the beginning for us, but soon, if I’m lucky, these might truly be everywhere,” he smiled. Ruby considered the chocolate in her hand. “Well go on.”
It was one of those hot days in the summer where the air sort of sticks to you. Anna Milton, who was twenty three and lovely, lounged about in her bedroom. She had been attempting a manuscript on her Remington (a birthday gift from her indulgent older brother Gabriel), but getting nowhere. When it’s that hot the heat can make even the gears of your brain slow to a halt. Absentmindedly, she looked out of her bedroom window, hoping to see the early approach of her brother who was due home that day.
“Go fishing,” Dean told him and savored the way the boy’s eyes lit up. “It’s pretty low effort, we could do it right around here actually. But you know, it’s pretty boring, so you gotta have the patience for it.”
“You didn’t ask me to join.”
“It made it easier to bear,” Cas told him in a quiet voice. He hated that everything he was saying only hurt Dean more. “You know you did the same thing for Sam, right?”
“It’s a curious title,
She couldn’t be a part of it. She had refused point blank. And she planned to give her notice once it was done. The nurses who came to take him were stony faced and foreign but he was not afraid. He had simply thought it more therapy. When he was led to the operating theater and strapped into the chair only then did he begin to become afraid. He had learned, over the five years, that struggling was futile, and he had been given a mild tranquilizer, so he was quite docile as they strapped him in. But Ishim soon began explaining the procedure and that was when he began to panic, his heart beating too fast, his wrists rubbed raw by his bindings. They were going to take his memories, that was all he understood, after years of battle, Ishim would finally win. They couldn’t. He found himself shouting. They simply couldn’t. Of course once they started to work, once he saw the pick, he simply froze. All of the fire that he had found in himself back in the library was gone and a terrible cold worked its way through his body.
, he thought,
One morning (morning was a loose term, Cas wasn’t exactly ever sure what time it was or how the days were passing, all sort of just measured by when Jack was asleep or awake) Jack woke up crying. It wasn’t exactly an uncommon occurrence but it hadn’t come out of any sort of a nightmare or conversation, it had just happened. Cas began shushing him, smoothing his hair.
“Don’t shout Anna, otherwise mummy will come running in,” Gabriel said, walking over to greet her. Anna headed down the steps and let him hug her. “You look well. Smarter and prettier than when I last saw you. I suppose it’s what Oxford does to a girl. Isn’t she worldly?”
“I think Claire would be more apt to tell you than me,” Cas said. “But I don’t think boys are gonna be a thing you’ll have to worry about,” Cas said. Dean furrowed his brow.
Cas had been fortunate to find himself a job at the local library (Garth of all people had called in a favor to get him a placing) and Jack, irony of ironies, was working part time at Gas n Sip (Jody had thought a job like that would be a good way for him to socialize with others in a safe enough fashion, plus they needed the money). Most of the day, Jack would sit with Cas at work (he had given his kind coworkers some flimsy explanation for why) and he had him do workbooks and online classes that Cas would assist him with whenever he got the chance. On weekends and in the evenings he would lecture him on all he knew about the universe, history, and science and Jack would listen with bright eyed, rapt attention. Cas discovered he was a good teacher, patient and kind, and Jack an even better pupil, who never seemed to lose his enthusiasm for any subject.
“You have to get him!” Cas demanded but Dean was barely listening.
He ran in then, ignoring the heat and the smoke and the way the wood burned his hands. He was screaming their names. Until his throat was raw. The house was in a full fledged inferno and he knew none of it was salvageable. Distantly he wondered what had happened to the cat or the chickens and then pushed it from his mind. Cas and Jack were both nowhere to be seen and his blood ran cold. Finally he heard a rasping voice call his name from up the stairs and he ran up and found him.
“I won’t let that happen,” Dean told him, harsh and quick and firm. “I would never- I promised you I’d never let him go near them again.” Cas sighed.
“So were you ever married, Mr. Singer?” His fellow librarian’s wife asked and he smiled awkwardly.
“Of course not, darling, but you’re as close as we’ve got, and who knows, we could make one out of you yet,” she cooed as she ran her long, painted fingers across his stubble. Sam caught her wrist with his hand. She raised an eyebrow.
“I don’t care about any of that,” Dean said firmly.
“Yes,” said Cas.
“What?” She asked and he sighed, trying to put it into words.
“Do you promise?”
“Where is he?” Jack demanded and Dean only shook his head.
“Roll me a cigarette? Would you?” Dean smirked.
“There is a certain operation, it’s new. Only a few years old. I’m sure you’ve heard of it. It’s had a lot of success with these sorts of cases. It calms people. Done successfully he may even be capable of being released and put back in your care. He could live quite nicely up at Milton House I would think. He wouldn’t be a bother to anyone,” Ishim said.
“He’s always been a flirt. Messing about with girls in the village, and with our maids. There was an incident with a school chum of mine when we were young in fact, Cassandra, but it was all resolved,” Anna took a breath. “It was today that I understood the full extent of his depravity. I found a letter he had written detailing...desires, for another man. I don’t know to who. But then I found him in the library with someone, just tonight, some man...I don’t want to say any more…”
“Well, his life hasn't been exactly free of danger. I need to do everything I can to keep Jack safe,” Cas knew Dean could hear the accusation in his voice and the line was quiet for a moment.
“I have to get to dinner.” Cas meant to wipe at his face but found he couldn’t move a muscle.
“Not daddy, Castiel,” Lucifer corrected.
“You’re not an idiot,” Dean told him gently. “You know, that’s one of the first things you ever told me?”
“That’s bosh,” Ketch laughed.
“Who are the flowers for?” He asked. “Ruby?”
“He’s my father” he whispered, all the anguish and love apparent in that last little word.
“Fuck Cas, you don’t have to say it like that,” Dean replied. “All I was doing was pointing out that he’s a threat. Trying to be logical. I don’t wanna hurt the kid myself I’m just saying, this is pretty damn apple pie.”
“I know,” Cas said, smiling. Dean kissed his smile and Cas melted into him, the child between them giggling and Claire making laughed noises of disgust. This was a better kiss, Cas thought, than one born of death and desperation. This was the kind of kiss he had been waiting for all his life. And he realized this was one of those perfect moments that he had given up his wings for, the type of joy you gladly accept all of life’s pain to achieve.
There was a pattering of feet then and Dean heard the door creak open and turned to see Jack standing there, a worried and uncertain expression on his little face. Dean felt shame twist his stomach. He’d done this to Cas with his child in the next room. What had he been thinking? It was such an awful violation he couldn’t put into words, his tongue choking on the apology.
“I’m not angry,” Cas said. “But what if you get scared again? What if you need to pull away? I don’t want you to feel burdened, to feel like you failed-”
“Ah.”
. But I know you’re going to have a good time.”
Dean and Anna split when they reached the house with her heading up to her bedroom and him heading to his room to continue his work. On his way he was stopped by Cas who it seemed was waiting for him.
“What did he just do?” She asked.
“You were gonna let Jack watch this movie?” He asked. He felt Cas’s laughter against his own chest.
“I don’t know,” he told him. “Whatever it is, it’ll be alright,” he said firmly and Jack buried his head into the crook of his father’s neck. It was an oft repeated gesture, whenever the truth of their fate got too much for him, he could sink into Cas and let the world disappear. It was a place of safety, a promise to always protect him that somehow Jack still believed in, not realizing just how horribly and irrevocably he had broken it. Cas was more than happy to indulge that fantasy, probably needed it as much as Jack.
Dean had finally heard him speak one morning. He had followed him outside one day to make sure the kid wasn’t getting into trouble or hurting himself. Predictably, the spot Jack was visiting was Cas’s makeshift grave marker. He was sitting criss cross applesauce on top of it and talking softly to the man deep beneath him, drawing little pictures in the dirt as he spoke.
“You’ve gotten good at that,” Dean admitted. Cas looked up at him.
“Don’t you know?”
“You stupid girl! What possessed you?” Dean accused harshly.
“I’m worried about you,” he admitted and Dean turned towards him with surprise. All of the conversations they’d had about the situation had been in relation to Claire and Jack, how Cas worried about his children around John. They’d not talked about this in relation to Dean, not for years. They’d spoken about it a lot when he had started going to AA after Jack was born. But once Dean had stopped going and the past began to fully seem the past, it had drifted to the back of their minds. Cas knew everything, half from serious, reasonable late night conversations and half from desperate tear filled late night confessions into the crook of his bare shoulder. But because he knew that, he also knew Dean would rather die than talk about it. He wasn’t that weak little kid, he would say harshly, if it was ever brought up. It wasn’t worth going over when it was basically ancient history and he was fine, totally fine. It was weakness, he thought, and too much weakness to even show to the one person he could allow himself to feel weak around.
Rowena had come to them with a new idea for a spell, one that would be stronger, might bypass warding, but would require a trifecta of witches. Power of three, she said, in her lilting Scottish accent, never discount it. Of course the challenge was finding two other willing witches, as Rowena was not exactly the most popular of the bunch.
“Don’t you have some work to do?” He asked him as he arranged the flowers in the vase. Dean snorted.
“Arm,” Claire insisted and with a sigh he extended his own. With a silver knife she drew a slash across it, blood trickling down. She examined it for a second and then looked up at him. “It’s really you?”
“That’s bullshit,” Cas responded. “That’s such bullshit.”
“I won’t,” she said and then he turned to her, green eyes harsh and steely.
“You know, everyone’s been saying that but it still hasn’t
“Introduce me to your friend,” Anna said.
“Well, as you can see I’m not in need of any saving,” Cas clarified.
“Are you safe?” He asked straight away.
“Cas, look, save your breath, I’m gonna get you to a hospital, I’m gonna-“ Dean rambled and then stopped himself. “You can’t die.”
So it wasn’t long after that she packed up and drove off to check out the Detroit job herself. And well, Ann Arbor was basically on the way. A pit stop really and she couldn’t stop herself because she knew she couldn’t be alone, not anymore. Not after days and nights of just her and Dean and the memories of Cas and Jack between them. And there was only one person who could help her or at least understand that. Just one person on earth.
to him (that one had stung more than he cared to admit because he had trusted him with Billie’s plan and Dean had turned around and crushed that trust to bits, that trust that he had thought was instinctive between them after everything), Cas couldn’t look at him anymore. There had been days and nights of awful screaming fights that had always seemed to end with either Jack crying and both of them feeling terribly ashamed or Dean simply storming out in a fit of defensiveness. Cas wanted to say:
The Miltons sat in the office of sanatorium. Anna had come from work and was as usual in her nurse’s uniform. Naomi, of course, was pulled together and perfect, looking sharp and professional. She was a woman of her generation, sure, but with the edge of the modern world. Gabriel looked small next to the women and while they took the two chairs in the office, he paced in the back, having not even managed to take off his great coat. Ishim, their cousin, sat behind his desk.
“I’ll see you around?” Dean said, heading into the driver’s seat.
“Dunno. He’s for Anna, I think. But she’s so particular, I doubt she’ll like him.” Cas put the cigarette to his lips and leaned in close. Carefully, Dean pulled open his lighter and lit it, noticing the way the flame lit up those ever icy blue eyes. Cas turned his face away and took a puff.
Oh Cas, she thought.
They awoke together and Cas felt so perfectly content and safe.
“I do?” Dean raised an eyebrow.
He stumbled to his feet then, his legs feeling unsteady like he was struggling to make them work but after a few shaky steps he got the hang of it. He was so close to them and as he got his bearings he broke into a run towards his house, so close but every second apart from it and his family was painful. He heard the chickens cheeping and as he passed the trees he saw the house in full.
“Claire doesn’t want one?”
“How was it different? Jack is my child, he’s under my protection. I love him more than anything. If you try to harm him I’ll kill you,” Cas stated. His voice was more level than Dean could’ve imagined such a declaration could be.
Jack’s face screwed up with thought for a few moments, as if he was trying to understand what Cas was telling him. Then finally he gave a small nod and leaned his back against the floor of the coffin. Cas couldn’t tell if he believed him or not and he watched the little boy lose himself in thoughts for a few moments before turning back to him, as if a wave of contentment had washed over him. It was sometimes funny, to Cas, how Jack would shake things off.
“Dean…” he rasped again and Dean knelt beside him, taking his hunting knife and cutting him free quickly, desperate to make his hands work. Cas was barely responding to his touch.
“But I told him I didn’t know what good it would do. And I don’t want to be asked more questions about it. I’ve had to explain too much to our children and grandchildren already. They didn’t know anything at all you know? This was how they had to find out.”
“I know,” Jack said quietly.
When the phone call had ended Cas was smiling so brightly he had felt like an idiot when he caught himself in the bathroom mirror. He had broached the subject with Jack at dinner, who had been angry about the idea of having to uproot again, but once Cas had explained that everyone in town knew them and thus wouldn’t believe that Jack was suddenly sixteen, when they had been saying he was over eighteen for a few years, he had calmed down. School seemed to fill him with nervousness but also excitement and he had rambled to Cas about all the tv shows and movies he had watched and how he hoped it would be just like that.
But the words were false even in his head. That was a fantasy, this was the reality. Funny how those types of things could flip on a dime.
They left not long after that, Jack waving happily at the girls from the window of the truck as they drove down the long suburban road. Privately, Cas wanted to laugh at how effectively he bounced back from things. They listened to pop music the whole way over that time and he looked at his son in the passenger seat, bouncing along to Carly Rae Jepsen and Ariana Grande and shook his head with a smile. They were going to be okay.
“I wish we could answer him,” Jack said quietly, breaking Cas out of his thoughts. Cas smiled at him.
“I’m not a little girl anymore,” she muttered. But if he heard he paid it no mind.
. And to her brother! From Dean Winchester! She would throw up if she didn’t scream. Instead she merely stood there. Glued to the floor. She didn’t know what to do next, it had to be a careful move. She could give it to Cas, see what happened, or even better, to their mother, it might win her at the very least a smile, but no that would end up being her fault somehow she was sure. She could simply burn it, end whatever was happening at the source. Or she could wait. She decided on this as the surest option and went back to her room. It was only a few minutes later before Ruby came in.
“Rough night?” She whispered. “You look pathetically hung over.”
They stood staring at each other for a second and then Cas took a step forward.
“Well, I thought, what if one day, because he fishes, he might find us one day? Pull us out?” Jack asked and Cas’s heart fell. “I mean who knows, right?”
“Not insane, of course not sweetheart, not insane. But, perhaps you have an affliction, something treatable,” she paused, and dabbed his sweaty brow with her handkerchief. “You’re the baby of the family, all of us, we all want what’s best for you. You’ll understand when you’re older.”
“Not a chance, she can’t take her eyes off your brother,” Cas replied.
“What do you mean dealt with? What needs to be dealt with?” Cas asked. At the back of the room Gabe emitted a small huff.
Rowena did, in fact, take him up on it one night. It was a rare moment when they bumped into one another in the library, nights spent searching for spells and ways forward, terrible dead ends. They’d been giving each other a lot of distance as he still didn’t know how to talk to her while knowing about her whole thing with Sam. The two of them were far from quiet and he was halfway to giving them a warning about it.
There wasn’t much up there, Cas’s bedroom, as he presumed it was, was left pretty bare. He went through the drawers desperately for any sort of clue, but found only soft sweaters and striped shirts of the kind he had worn back when he had been human. The blue tie was hanging off his dresser and Dean ran over the silky fabric with his hands. He had an urge to press it to his lips, but instead stuffed into his pocket, taking no care to not crumple it up. There was little sign of any personhood at all, besides the windows with the ruined bloody warding (for all the good they did) and a small photograph tucked into the mirror. It was one they had taken a few years ago of the two of them leaning against the Impala, Dean’s hand over Cas’s shoulder, the both of them laughing. Sam had taken it, if he remembered right. He didn’t remember why. Dean didn’t know Cas had kept a copy. He pocketed it too.
“Is that such a crime? Money’s not a dirty thing.”
“That can’t be true!”
“She sees him more.”
“You brought it?”
“Then can you stay?” Jack asked again, expectantly. Dean shook his head.
“Do you believe me now Cas?” Dean asked him, barely a whisper in his ear. “That I’m not going anywhere? That I won’t get scared? Do you trust me?”
“No use in that, I’m already dead,” Cas muttered, his head falling into the crook of Dean’s arm. Dean shook his head and made his way down the staircase.
Cas had no response to that, and simply turned into the shaking child beside him, burying his face in his hair as the coffin’s lid was shut on top of them both. The locks clicked one after the other, Jack flinching at each one, and once they were done, the cuffs restraining Jack’s hands fell away, no need for them anymore. Cas felt them being dragged down the beach towards the sea. Jack tensed up and wrapped his arms around his father’s neck. Cas held him close.
“You would never be a burden,” Dean swore.
he thought, but did not say. “I was so hopeless I was going to do an unforgivable thing,” he added, and the image of the Colt being pointed to Kelly Kline’s head, the way her frightened but trusting eyes had gazed back at him, inadvertently entered his mind. Even after all he had done for her, he was still so disgusted with the man he had been then, so desperate to prove his worth that he would kill an innocent. “I wouldn’t have lasted long, not the way I was. You- you gave me purpose for the first time in years, reminded me of the hopes and dreams, the faith I had once had.”
“I haven’t spoken to him about it yet. Just Jody and you.”
“He’s gone,” Cas said and Dean noticed then that he was crying, tears making clean tracks down the ash on his face. “Lucifer took him. He took him, Dean. He took my baby. He took Jack.”
“Oh, please. It was just a little fun. And I told you, I had nothing to say. I don’t know why you even wrote.” Cas turned into Dean as they reached the fountain.
“Don’t fight me on this, you know as well as I do that the both of you always come off as a little- you know, special. High schoolers, they’re just gonna latch onto that shit right away and they’ll bully him and man, I mean I can’t have him go through that. Come on, like you said, kid’s been through enough.”
It was Ruby, she made the girl and her red dress out right away. Ruby with her skirts hiked up behind her back and
“Why?!” Dean repeated, Cas seemed to be on the verge of tears but he didn’t care, couldn’t care. He needed his answer.
Anna had been sent to find Cas for dinner.
“That you’re practically a monk. That you’re twenty years old and I would bet I’m the only girl you’ve seen all of. And that hasn’t been since we were children.” In truth, Cas could barely remember what Anna looked like naked. They’d been so buttoned up and separated by the help so young. At Harrow he’d seem plenty of boys in full, hiding his own discomfort as they stripped in the dormitories each evening. And even at Cambridge he’d been invited along for many a midnight swim in the River Cam, though he’d mostly denied such offers. It was indecent, he’d explained, and he had to get back to his books.
“Not that, that’s awful enough in and of itself. You know the real way Cas died. You didn’t even mention that to the interviewer, did you?” Sam asked and Anna shook her head.
“Why’s it so big?” Sam said, breaking the silence, and Dean turned to stare at him.
“So you are going to give it to him?” Ruby questioned. “I mean I would, just to see what he does.”
“Public school is garbage, it’ll mess him up for life. Trust me, I walk in there, I still break out in hives and I was a cool kid.”
“Should I be afraid?” He asked and Cas titled his head. “Of your cooking, I mean.”
She knew Cas had never held a thing like that against him. That the people he loved were his whole world. That he was happy to die for Jack, for loving Dean, that he wouldn’t have wanted to die any other way, that he would never have wanted to live when they were gone. That the momentary joy of that love being put into words was worth dying for. But she hated Cas for it and she knew it was cold comfort for Dean, who yet again couldn’t save him. She wanted to tell him they would save Cas. That when they killed the Empty they’d get him out and he’d come back to them, like he always did. But she knew Dean. They were too alike. He wouldn’t be able to bear hope right then.
“Well, let’s charter a fucking boat.”
“My publishers said it was unlikely you would sue,” Anna replied. “You have more to lose than to gain.”
Cas was fixing his bowtie when a paper slid under his door. The sound of soft footsteps disappearing, convinced him it was his sister. He grabbed it in his hands and the words shot at him like bolts into his heart, like Christ nailed to the fucking cross. He wouldn’t have, he realized, needed Dean to have signed the letter to know it was from him. He’d have known by instinct, from the handwriting, from the sent, from the very fact that this was something he’d been waiting for longer than he could remember even if he hadn’t known it himself.
“Let’s not fight please,” Cas said, cutting him off. “It’s a waste of a night.”
“You’re such a curious creature, you know that? Everyone always says it but no one fully understands,” she admitted and gave one small chuckle. “This means no more resurrections, you understand? This is the last of it. Tell that son of yours that too. If you fall and break your neck tomorrow I’m not getting involved.”
But Cas continued, not paying him any mind and kicking off his pants until he was in only his underclothes. Then, quickly, and avoiding eye contact, he jumped in the fountain. It was colder than he expected, and biting. But once under, he could open his eyes and quickly found the handle. He swam up slowly, wanting to relish the brief peace under the water. When he broke the water, Dean was still staring at him. He pulled himself up and stood on the edge of the fountain and stared down at him. He felt a sort of electricity running through his veins, like if he stood there a moment longer he might entirely burst into flames. A small voice at the back of his head, the voice he tried not to usually listen to, told him that fire like that wouldn’t kill him. That embracing it may be the only thing that could save him. But instead he jumped off the fountain’s edge, grabbed his clothes and the vase, stuffed the flowers back in, and began to storm back towards the house. Ignoring the feeling of Dean’s gaze on him.
“I shouldn’t be talking to you,” Cas wanted to run but Dean stood right in front of him and he knew he was going nowhere.
“I don’t know, call the police?” Anna leaned back on her bed.
“They get whatever they want forever,” he had said firmly. “If this place makes them happy, then let’s do it. And besides if the angels wanna show up, good. I can’t wait to take a bite out of ‘em.”
, he considered and he remembered what Gabriel had tried to tell him last week. That a telegram had been sent to Sam telling that Dean had died on the beaches of Dunkirk and he wouldn’t be coming back to take him to the country after all. The words had been meaningless then but he understood them in that instant.
“She doesn’t approve of me being a writer,” Anna explained. “And it’s more than that. She could never approve of a thing about me. She once said she could barely stand me as a baby. Too red faced and I howled like a banshee.” Cas reached across her vanity and offered her a pair of earrings.
“What do you mean?” Jack asked.
, he told himself as he started his truck and they drove off in silence.
“Cas-”
“We can’t go home! We have to be happy we’re here!” She shouted back. “Now shut up and be grateful you little monster!” Sammy bit into her arm and she yelped and then turned around to slap him, losing her grip on Alfie, who kicked her in the shin. She tumbled to the floor. When she looked up, Arthur Ketch was standing there.
, he texted him back.
“He’s just confused, it’ll all be alright,” Cas consoled him. He looked at Dean then, meeting his eyes with a hard stare.
, she’d thought, and liked the idea.
“Alright, Liam Neeson,” Crowley drawled. “We’re doing all we bloody can.”
“Dad was never the same after the Great War, that’s what you always said-“ Dean cut him off.
“Well,” the man said, “shit.”
. Mother would certainly say it was. But I…” Ruby looked around nervously, “sometimes I think I’m really wicked Anna, really I do. Like something lives in me that shouldn’t. And I’m not even ashamed of it, I
“He’s sort of...Cas said he’s telepathic. I’ve never seen him do it. It’s only if there’s some sort of bond,” Dean muttered.
“I’m alright,” Cas told him, sounding far from it. Jack gave a wary glance up at Dean.
“Burn you alive?”
“What’s wrong with you? What’s
He found it hard to look at Jack most days, hard to look at Claire too but not as unbearably painful as looking at Jack. Claire had been right when she had said it the first day she’d shown up to the bunker: all that was left of Cas was in Jack. That could be beautiful but was mostly heartbreaking. Some days he hated him, and that thought was shameful but completely true. Jack was the reason why Cas was gone. It was Jack who Cas had chosen over Dean, over his own life. It was for Jack’s sake he was killed and it was for Jack he had begged when he was dying. He died so Jack could live. It was all Jack’s fault. Well, Jack’s fault and Dean’s fault for always being too damn fucking slow. He hated that he knew he ultimately hated Jack as it was easier to hate him than himself.
“You’re far from welcome,” he had replied and disappeared as per usual. Dean had found himself laughing once he was gone.
“I heard something break, are you alright, dear?” He asked Ruby and then noticed the plate on the floor. “Should I get a broom?”
“No, no, you were such a good boy. You did just what I wanted. I promise, shhh, don’t cry baby, I promise. It’s alright now, it’s alright,” Cas assured him and kissed his temple. He pressed their foreheads together then, sending all of his thoughts of love, all of his assurances towards the boy in his arms and in return Jack sent his longing and his sadness during his absence back towards him.
“Won’t come to any good that,” Dean huffed.
“Why not? You said it would be a good place for him, sorta, you know, more hippie dippie and all that right?”
“Wanna hot box the bathroom?” She asked him, his eyes nearly flew out of his head. “I won’t tell your mom.”
“Is he one of the help?” Ruby asked.
“You’re such a little sap,” Dean fondly told him and Cas gave him a small, shy smile. It was moments like that he still saw the kid in him, the sweet kid who looked at him with so much more adoration than he’d ever deserved.
“I heard your prayers-” Cas began, but Dean cut him off.
“You don’t know how much I tore myself apart this past year,” Dean said.
“Hey Castiel, we should talk,” Billie said and he squinted at her as she approached him. “Do you know where you are?”
“Lots of people love you,” Cas said and Dean had found an excuse to leave the call right after that.
Cas himself would bring him mediocre attempts at cooking and distant conversation. That was alright, Dean decided, anything was alright. He was never far, keeping an eye on things and sometimes Dean bristled from the lack of trust. After all, he was keeping up his end of the bargain, not telling anyone, even Sam, that he had found them. But then he remembered the fight in the kitchen and the sobbed out confession and his prior threats towards Jack, and he knew he didn’t have much ground to stand on.
“No, I’d not mind at all. I’ll get my costume, meet you in the great hall in ten.” She barely finished speaking before she left. Sam turned back to Dean.
“Just Max,” Sam replied. Rowena nodded and smiled.
Their days were consumed with Cas showing Jack around their garden and the forest near their house, naming every plant, every insect, every bird, every small animal. It was the two of them struggling through cookbooks, both comically inept at it. It was reading Jack books and watching movies, the ones Dean had showed him as “essential to being human,” and then shutting those movies off halfway when he realized how startlingly inappropriate so many were. It was feeding the cat that Jack had named Scooby for his favorite cartoon (not fully understanding that it was a dog’s name) and making sure Jack didn’t hold him too tightly whenever he picked him up for a hug. It was teaching Jack to fly or levitate books or drive his truck. It was sitting by the shore and pointing out the sealife and their ancestors and history and whispering that he knew a man who loved fishing and would one day, if things got better, teach Jack how to himself.
“Good for you.”
“We’re very fortunate for you taking us in,” Ruby said, “ow!” She yelped as one of the twins pinched her thigh. “They’re such little devils.”
“I love you,” Cas said, earnest and ever faithful and sure of himself. Dean reached his hand up to rest on Cas’s stubbly chin, a light tap to remind himself that they’re both real.
“I don’t know why I…” Dean began again and then stopped himself. Didn’t know why what? Why he’d yelled at him? Grabbed him? Forced a confession out of him they had both always known was waiting, silent behind his lips? Spent years searching for him only to push him away at his first chance? Didn’t know why he felt there was something wrong with him every time he had looked at Cas or god forbid touched him?
“I can try,” Cas said and Dean took his hand and guided it down to his lips and gently kissed his palm. Cas shook his head but was afraid to speak. He didn’t know if he had a will anymore but he was realizing that this was finally okay.
“I keep my promises,” Cas said and Dean nodded. There was a strange moment between them. Long and quiet and Cas wondered what now it would take him to forgive him. Because somehow he didn’t, some part of him still couldn't. He was beginning to realize this was maybe more about him than it was about Jack or maybe he just couldn’t separate Jack from himself. He didn’t know. Either way, it wasn’t enough. It still wasn’t enough.
“Not now it isn’t,” Dean replied. Cas could have screamed at him. Dean went for the buttons of his shirt, but Cas beat him to it. He briskly kicked off his shoes and socks and then unbuttoned his shirt, pulling it over his head, revealing his undershirt. Dean laughed. “Oh come on Cas you don’t have to.”
“What the fuck is this?” was all Dean could get out. Cas tucked the child tighter to himself at the sound of Dean’s gruff voice.
“Oh of course not.”
“Do you expect me to kiss your foot with gratitude?” He drawled in response.
“That’s the point, I can’t,” he said. “You have to figure it out on your own.” He turned back to the screen again, gunshots punctuating the quiet of the motel room. Dean thought he noticed Cas’s eyes grow watery watching Maria cradle the dying Tony, the red of her dress popping like a blood stain against the grey and brown cityscape.
Cas considered. He considered the house and the truck and the warding. He considered how Dean smelled of grease from working in the shop earlier that day and how he had ruffled Jack’s hair that morning over breakfast. He considered how he was there when the sun rose and set and how Dean held him when he felt like he was crazy or shattered. He remembered how the day before, at the supermarket, he had told the cashier that the sugary cereal was for their son.
“We’re not that far from home,” Cas said softly. Dean looked away. It was true, the motel was on the edges of town, and their apartment, the one currently occupied by his sleeping father, was only a twenty minute drive at most. There had been bad traffic, but nothing bad enough to warrant the time he got in.
“Ruby, dear, let’s show you about, our rooms are upstairs,” she took her arm as she spoke and led her away. Ruby cast another backwards glance at Sam as she was led off, hurrying the twins in front of her. Anna followed her cousin with her eyes and strode up to take her other arm. Ruby was young, she thought, and a flirtation like that wouldn’t do her any good.
“If you know the plot it means you read it too, you can’t get me in trouble,” he told her. “Besides, I have been an admirer of his prose for a while. I didn’t read it for the…”
. Even good people, he had thought, considering Dean and Sam and their promise to take Jack’s grace. Lucifer would do anything to get his hands on his son. For all Cas knew the British Men of Letters were even still out there, hunting them. There wasn’t a single group that wouldn’t do him harm. Jack grew curious sometimes, battered him with requests to go with him into town, but mostly he was content. He was still young enough to see his father as the most interesting and spectacular creature on earth, and while he asked questions about his mother or the people Cas had known before he was born, he never disobeyed.
“You keep saying that! You had powers! Jack has powers! You could’ve fought me off!”
“He’s alive,” the man said. “He’s human.”
“How did I get in?” Dean finally said. “If he made a barrier, an impenetrable one, how’d I even get in? Because I shouldn’t be able to.”
It was decided then. From that point on Claire was his shadow, sitting beside him at their war councils as plans were devised, making little comments in agreement with him and asking questions of her own. He caught her about in his flannel or jacket when her stuff was in the laundry and agreed to not make a comment. At night, when all the guests had gone to bed, she sat up with him and shared his whiskey.
“Thank you,” he had told Crowley, and realized he’d probably never said it before. Crowley had rolled his eyes.
“Where? What do you mean?” Dean asked and Sam looked at him, his face drawn.
“I don’t think it’s going to be much like
“I’m an unloved, greying, middle aged fart living alone in a bunker with nothing but a .45, a bottle of jack, and my car for company,” Dean said. “I don’t want that for him.”
“I do love you, you know,” Cas told him, his voice sounding far away and small. “And I still don’t regret any of it, I just-“ he started to cry again. Dean wiped at his face.
“I thought it was my style,” Cas replied plainly.
“No way,” Dean shot at him. “Not in a million years.”
He instead asked Jody for advice: how to cook, how to clean, how to enroll Jack in school, all logistics she would know as the best mother he had ever met. She explained it to him patiently and painstakingly, laughing gently when he proved himself nearly incapable of boiling rice or cutting vegetables without nearly taking his thumb off. He had sheepishly admitted to her that Dean had always been the one to do all the cooking and she had said he would get the hang of it in time, she promised. Gardening and housework he seemed to adapt to better, and he found he loved the simple routine of things like laundry. Busy work for idle hands, she had advised him.
she had to admit,
“I love you. Be good to him,” Cas told him, and then Dean felt his body fully go limp in his arms. He knew what had happened. It was obvious. He’d seen it a million times, a million times with Cas alone. He suddenly wasn’t holding him anymore. All he had in his arms was what was left behind. He wanted to scream or cry out, shoot himself in the head or charge into the burning house. He didn’t do any of that, instead he stayed with the body and held him as long as he could. He realized distantly that he’d never really held him before.
“No girls allowed,” Gabe quipped. “Go help mummy with something.”
(It seemed to have somehow been communicated though, as Rowena had climbed into the passenger seat when Sam had finally driven the Impala off the property. There was a small smile on her red lips, and a lingering hand on his knee.)
“Sir, you have to be getting back to the house,” the officer said but Cas couldn’t hear him. He had to stay he had to tell him, he brought his mouth close to Dean’s ear and whispered:
Dean didn’t get a chance to respond because it was then that the chanting stopped and Max turned to them both with an expectant look in his hazel eyes.
“Listen, Jackie, it’s hard alright? To do good you gotta do a little bad? Doesn’t that make sense?” Lucifer asked him but he didn’t blink. “I am your dad for real kiddo, that wasn’t a lie. And come on, I mean, you wanna be like them? They’re losers and pretty soon they’re gonna be dead losers. That’s all Castiel was. He was just a meatsuit for me to jump the bones of to hightail it out of hell and get on with the real plan. He was disposable. You don’t wanna be like that. You’re a chip off the old block. You’re like me. A winner.”
“Don’t curse in front of Jack,” Cas admonished and Claire laughed. “I’m so glad you’re here. You’ve been helping, Dean?”
“I’m fine.”
“If you ever raise a hand to him I'll shoot you,” she said bluntly. He put down his drink and glared at her, snorting in disbelief. “Don’t give me that indignation. I see the way you look at him sometimes. I know how easy it would be to do something like that. I know how you were raised.”
“I- I know,” Dean said desperately. “I know I can never- but we have to go now Jack, we have to go before something happens-”
“Well clearly you bothered with me.”
“I didn’t have a choice, Dean,” he told him and Dean shook his head and Cas wondered if he was close to tears, there was an unfamiliar glisten to his eyes.
“That was different,” Dean said.
“Upstairs, still writing, as usual.” Gabriel grinned.
“Mummy runs a tight ship, we’ll be sure to keep them in line,” Anna snarked.
Jack looked at him with those doe eyes and Cas didn’t think he would say anything and that would probably be okay. But finally Jack smiled, just a little.
“Well, she misses you. I don’t know, like I said, I doubt I’d have been the first to know if you were still here,” Cas told him. And it was true, though Cas had been the one to bring Claire into the family, Dean had been who she’d always latched onto. He’d been the one she tentatively began to call “dad” pretty early on, while Cas was still just Cas to her. It had taken her ages to see Cas as more than some weird older brother figure and instead a parent in his own right. He supposed it was partly the age difference, Cas having only nine years on her, which felt less than Dean’s own thirteen. Newly twenty meant far less to a precocious eleven year old than twenty four. But the other part, he had to admit, was probably due to her identification with him. They were so painfully alike and Dean knew that in his quieter moments he still saw a child in Cas. Not in any real way, he was smart, mature, and an incredible and capable father to Jack and Claire. But in little ways, like how Dean always put his arm out in front of him when a car drove in front of them while they were crossing the street. It was instinctual and baseless, but he suspected Claire picked up on it and absorbed it into her own psyche.
“I can take of myself,” Ruby told him. But he was already gone.
“And you’re not. Or so I hear from the maids,” Cas retorted. “Yet you still wouldn’t answer my letters.”
Jack ran to Cas then, sinking into his embrace. Cas held him close and stroked his hair as Dean felt an immense jealousy. He wasn’t sure where it came from, maybe that he couldn’t remember ever having been held like that or maybe because beforehand Cas had only ever reserved that type of love and care for him. Cas looked up over Jack’s head after a moment and made eye contact with Dean. He seemed suddenly calmer and stronger, more in control. Dean remembered the angel in the barn who had smiled at a knife to the heart. Cas’s eyes were unsmiling but just as steady as before.
“Certainly not,” Anna said.
“Let’s get back to the house. Before your mother worries.” Anna followed him, wrapping herself in her towel.
“But what can be done?” It ripped out of Anna, she was bored and she couldn’t stand the way the little man built suspense. He gave her a watery grin.
“I will never understand you,” she repeated curiously, a gentle smile on her lips, and in a flash of white light he was gone.
“Alright,” Cas agreed, though Anna could tell from the way his eyes flitted that he would have far preferred to go with the gamekeeper.
“Cas, do you ever get a chance to go on dates?” She had said as she licked the cream cheese frosting off a cupcake in a way he felt was highly unsanitary.
“I wouldn’t be able to see them? Talk to them? Live with them?” He asked. Billie shook her head.
From that point on things moved more efficiently in the conversation. Ishim explained the surgery in more depth and Anna pretended to nod along, her mind already on what she would have for lunch afterwards. A date was set and they thanked him for his time and care. They would visit afterwards to see if he could be discharged or not and it was discussed of Anna taking time off from the hospital to care for him, but decided that the war efforts came first.
“Well, what are we?” Crowley asked and Dean looked at him. What was Crowley? A missed opportunity, a dumb vindictive mistake, the only person who was ever honest with him, and ultimately a poor replacement for the one person he thought of before he went to be and right before he woke up, that was what Crowley was. Somehow he didn’t need to say any of this and Crowley only sighed as if in understanding. “No, I’m the blasted idiot who never had a chance. You took it didn’t you?”
Things moved quickly from then on. Dean had tried explaining his choice to Sam, who had been shocked, not unkind, but not understanding.
“You need to make a decision,” Cas said, Dean twisted his neck ever so slightly to look up at him. “Because it can’t go on like this, it really can’t.”
“Let’s do it over now then,” Dean said quietly, so quietly Cas was almost sure he missed him. Nothing in this conversation had shocked him but that sent him spinning. He had never dreamed of Dean promising him something like that.
“He can read your mind?”
“Good,” said Anna. “Now we should both clean up before dinner.” Ruby stood up and headed towards the door then turned back.
“Get him out, help him out,” Cas told him instead. Dean nodded and put his hands on Jack’s forearms, lifting him from the box. Jack went willingly with him, trusting, Cas noticed, instinctively. When he was clearly placed gently on the deck, Dean reached in for Cas as well. Cas found himself wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck as he pulled him out, desperate to feel that he was real and solid and not some terrible, terrible joke. He felt Dean’s sweat between his fingers and expected that Dean felt Cas’s own tears, uncontrollable and quiet, drenching his shirt.
“I was scared!” Cas repeated.
Dean was hung over the next morning when they did the spell, and just watching his brother, Rowena, and Max chant made his headache. Alicia came up beside him, gentle hand on his shoulder. He wished people would stop trying to have heart to hearts with him, Sam seemed to do it anytime they went for a drive together. The only person he wanted to have one with was his mother and he was pretty damn sure she wasn’t going to be offering. She hadn’t even gotten out of bed yet. He looked at Alicia.
“Sorry.”
“Of course you are,” he said. “Well, one of these days we should get it done, if it’s alright by your dad.”
“Well then, I don’t see why not?” Naomi stated plainly. As if it was a question of a child buying sweets and not the condemning of her youngest son.
Cas’s face was currently wrapped in distress watching the old man stare at the bright faced young lover, ranting about the new life he would build in the country. When the old man slapped him across the face and yelled “wake up!”, Cas flinched. Dean reached across the soft for his hand.
“No, of course not. I’m sorry.”
Cas hadn’t known how to respond to that, and had waited until night to give Dean a long report of Jack’s excellent first day to him.
“You know you two are free to come home whenever?” Dean finally asked.
They went to Jody’s first. He needed to get his bearings and it was high time Jack met his older sister. Of course they had hit it off famously and Kaia had been thrilled to see him yet again. They showed him around the neighborhood as Jody and Cas spent hours at her kitchen table, drinking tea and talking through everything. She had said right off that they could stay as long as they wanted, even permanently, but the house was packed already and Cas hadn’t wanted to make it hard for Dean to visit the girls. Also he knew he couldn’t stay in Sioux Falls, not a place inextricably linked to Bobby, someone who Cas would never get the forgiveness of and he knew he probably didn’t even deserve it. He wouldn’t soil a place like that with his presence.
“This is all my fault,” Jack got out, “I never realized- I never- you’re here because of me.”
“The Friends School? Oh...I don’t know.”
“I make chocolate,” Ketch responded, lighting up the way proud men do when asked about their livelihood. “You can try some later if you like.”
He could finally stop just calling him “the baby” in his head, or “the nephilim'' when he talked to Sam. There was no crib, but instead a mattress leaning against the wall, sheets with shooting stars on them, and a collection of stuffed animals in the bed. The dresser was full of clothes of varying ages it seemed, making him think the Amara theory was probably right. A laptop was plugged into the corner. It was a life, Dean thought, a whole life had taken place here and he had missed it. Cas and this kid, Kelly’s kid, Lucifer’s kid, as he had to keep reminding himself when he thought too softly about the child. They’d had something more normal than he had ever dreamed of giving him. And what did it cost them? He couldn’t bear it.
“That’s not true you just know how to take care of others,” Cas said. “You know how to manage him,” who the him was seemed obvious and unspoken but Dean responded to it with a grunt nonetheless, “and you know how to deflect and take the brunt off of others and keep everyone calm and happy but you don’t know how to take care of yourself. And besides, even if you did, that’s not all on you anymore. Now you have me.”
“You mean make money off if it?”
“We think it might be appropriate well, first of all, to have you placed under a conservatorship,” Naomi noticed the look of horror on his face and smiled at him gently, “Just for the time being angel, just until we know you’re not going to hurt yourself or anyone else.”
“So, you’re mad at me?” Dean asked him with a slight smile, Cas raised his eyebrows. “I saved you and all.”
“Of course, of course we understand,” Naomi assured him. “If he were to leave, he’d simply become a spectacle. If the press were to get their hands on it, well it might jeopardize both of your careers.” She looked over Anna and Gabe as she said this.
“Can we have someone get our bags?” Ketch asked.
“I am yours, you are mine, you are what you are,” Dean sang softly as he guided Jack’s hands through stirring the batter and ignored Jack’s complaints that he could do it himself. It was all okay, Cas told himself, it was finally all okay.
“No.”
“Don’t be so sure we’ll win,” Dean huffed. Rowena smiled. “I’ve had enough time to know you and your brother are the side to bet on,” Rowena admitted. “What? Do you think I’m only with him for his massive forearms and rugged good looks? I'm a pragmatic girl, I always have been. I like to play for the winning team,” she said and turned as if to go before stopping and running her tongue over her teeth. “Though I must admit, my son calls your brother “moose” but I think a more apt name for a certain appendage of his might be horselike.”
“Alfie and Sammy,” she said. “And perfect beasts both of them.”
And Jack had switched his order, sheepishly, to a grilled cheese with ice cream for dessert. On the car ride he had banned any rock, folk, classic or otherwise, when Jack had quietly switched on Crosby, Stills & Nash.
“Jack, why did you call me that, what you did on the boat?” Dean asked him suddenly, and Jack stopped what he was doing and looked back, head tilting. “A fisherman, I mean.”
“I’ve seen many hopeless cases before,” he said and Anna thought she saw something light up in his eyes. “And we must accept, after five years, Castiel is hopeless. He will not recover. He cannot rejoin society. He’ll only injure himself and the family.”
“Worth anything?” Dean asked, finishing the cigarette and passing it to him.
“You’ve really become all about the simple joys, haven’t you Cas?” Dean said and Cas didn’t really get the joke but nodded anyway.
“Bugger off, Sammy.”
“You raised a good kid,” Dean said. “He’s just beautiful. You should be so proud.”
“You like Forster?” Ketch asked him. “He’s the chap who wrote the book about the girl in Italy right? And that other one about one of the colonies?”
“Well it’s not enough is it!” Dean shouted at Crowley who for his part seemed unfazed. Sam sighed.
He was saving those memories, though, for later. It took incredible self control, as they were the ones he wanted to savor the most. But he knew that their later spanned on forever and while his reserves were nearly endless, he didn’t want to spend centuries with nothing new to tell Jack but detailed descriptions of how the monkeys crawled out of the trees or the first tornado. These things were beautiful, sure, but not anything like the last ten years of his life. Those had been the years that had counted.
“Yes, I think you’re quite right,” she said, fastening them in place. “I don’t know why I’m fussing so much, the guests are for you.”
“He’s under a load of blankets and it’s hot as blazes out, mummy,” Gabriel muttered.
“I’m not lying, I’m telling you the truth. I did a really bad thing when you were a baby. I stole your from your real father, but he looked for you for years because he loved you so much and now you’re going to go with him. And everything will be set right,” Cas said and Lucifer walked over then, bending down in front of Jack.
It was never the same after that. After everything with the bomb and Chuck and Dean telling Jack he wasn’t family and Dean
“I’m...I’m terribly sorry,” the interviewer said, barely recovering.
“Alright,” Dean agreed, his best attempt at stoicism coating his voice. He pulled himself together as if to head towards the door. “I won’t tell anyone about this.”
“I’d really like that,” Jack replied. “It sounds awesome.” And he flashed Dean one more bright smile before returning to his digging.
“It’s my last novel,” she said bluntly.
The knock was quiet and first and then loud and insistent. His heart froze. It couldn’t be Dean, he assumed, not at this hour. He didn’t know who else it could be, who could get through the barrier, it had held so well for so long. He reached for his phone in his pocket and texted Dean with one hand “Poughkeepsie.” He then pulled out his angel blade and held it at the ready. As if on cue, the door broke down.
“That’s a good thing,” he said and she turned her attention back to her window. A small way of indicating she wanted out of this conversation. It might have stayed that way had a certain soft fingerpicking not drifted into the car.
“Gabe. We missed you.”
“Do yourself a favor Sammy, go right ahead. The Bolsheviks won’t get you for one measly dinner.” And with that Dean strode out into the hallway. He looked about anxiously, until he caught sight of Anna crossing between rooms. He signaled to her quietly, and while at first she looked reticent she eventually met him.
“But you did,” Cas said calmly, Dean shook his head.
“Don’t get defensive baby daddy,” Crowley joked and Dean spun on him, banging the small man into a wall. Crowley grinned at him.
“Not much more than you do lately,” Cas had argued.
“Don’t hurt him!” Cas shouted and Dean gaped at him. “You’ll have to kill me first.” It was only then that Dean realized his gun was still quite literally blazing. He lowered it then, tentative and overwhelmed.
it could be better, that maybe they could be the family they had been before. But something was broken and none of them knew how to fix it.
The words had buzzed in Cas’s ears with a strange familiarity from when he had pieced through Dean’s soul by hands so many years ago. He wouldn’t let this happen, he swore, not to his son.
Claire replied by tossing holy water in his face. Cas sputtered for a moment before being greeted with a second splash of borax. Jack shrieked as the cool liquid hit him.
“Of course. Regular Mary Shelley,” he stepped back and gestured to his friend. “Cas, may I introduce you to a good friend of mine, Arthur Ketch? This is my kid brother Castiel, he just finished his second year at Cambridge.”
“There’s still the logistics,” Cas began but Dean cut him off again.
“Maybe he aged himself,” Crowley replied, “I mean, there’s not a lot of lore about nephilim but I wouldn’t be surprised.”
that horrible man. You never consider what that might have been like. What those days and months and years after that summer were like. That my mother made it clear she thought I had it coming to me. You never wrote to me. Never asked how I was. I don’t want your pity. And I don’t want your apologies. I won’t forgive you. And they may not have gotten a chance to tell you either way, but I am certain Dean and Cas wouldn’t have either.”
“I’m fine,” Dean assured him and tapped his leg against the floor. “We gonna pick up where we left off?”
“Sorry sport, I don’t think we could pass you off as FBI, this is a pretty small town,” Dean said. “Maybe if I’m working something nearby.”
“How did you know her last thoughts?” Dean asked. Cas sighed.
“Do that.”
“We have three bedrooms. You can always stay here. But you always drive away. I don’t know why.” Jack explained. “You never stay for dinner. I wish you would. Daddy makes good pasta.”
“Perfectly safe. It’s a routine sort of thing. We’re experts in that here.” He said.
“You saw him?” The man asked her and she nodded.
“If it’s what you think is best for Cas, doctor. If it’s what will keep him calm and out of trouble, then yes, I think we should do it.” As soon as Anna said it Gabriel grabbed his hat.
“Is that what you think I look like?” Anna couldn’t contain a true bite in her voice.
“Someone’s come in,” and Anna could know her baby brother’s voice anywhere. That was when it became clear what she was seeing. Cas, Cas and Dean Winchester in the library and they were...they were...she felt very crazed and then very calm all at once.
“Castiel?” Anna’s voice pierced through the darkness and then Dean’s head turned to her. The rest seemed to happen like something in the cinema. Cas quickly pulled himself together and hurried past her, red faced and terrified. Dean, however, dressed slower. Her eyes met his in the darkness, that warm shade of mossy green. And then he left the room, his mouth set hard, and she was left alone in the darkness once again.
“Charity.”
“Alright, I’ll do it,” Dean replied and Cas leaned down and brushed a kiss to his lips. Dean savored it, wanting to hold him there forever, stuck in the sweet forgiveness of the man he loved. Eventually he broke away. Cas smiled at him.
“Thanks for taking him,” Cas said and Dean nodded, though he could see something pained in the way his mouth was set.
“No,” Cas said firmly. “I don’t mind. It’s not a bad smell, not to me, never has been. It reminds me you’re home.”
“Yeah, I guess you guys could also just come home and stop being so goddamn weird about this,” Dean shot back.
On his first day of school, smiling with his backpack, he had texted Dean a picture of him, the first ever actually. Dean had texted back
“I think you’re being pretty fucking stubborn-”
“Oh right, I’ve heard how your father hasn’t been the most prudent with money in recent years.” The three siblings stiffened.
“Let me, here.” He said but instead of grasping the vase he managed to knock it from Cas’s hands, as it fell it hit the edge of the fountain, the handle breaking off and falling in, the rest of the vase falling to the ground. Cas sprang back and looked up.
“Oh God something’s wrong! You’ve done something awful to him! Don’t you see!” She was shrieking and his own body was seizing and he tumbled out of the stretcher and into her arms which grabbed him tightly and forced them all away.
“You’ll save me but you won’t look at me,” Cas said.
When the mysterious disappearances began he hadn’t forwarded the news to Dean because he had no intention of seeming hysterical or like he was inventing a reason to see him. But as the deaths piled up, Dean had shown up on his own, knocking on his door in his typical FBI suit and Cas felt as weak in the knees as he had that night after the brothel. As weak as he had when Dean had said that he’d rather have him.
“NO!” He shrieked and with that something came out of him, something overwhelmed with rage and grief and love. He could only see red and gold light came out of his body. “YOU WON’T HURT ANYONE AGAIN!”
“How do you have that?” Sammy asked.
Jack’s eyes widened.
“A sanatorium,” said Anna bluntly and his mother winced.
“A waste of time.”
Dean worked as a mechanic, which was good and hard work that kept his mind off of things and it was good to fix rather than break for the first time in a while, part time only, though. Most of his time was spent at home, where Cas was homeschooling Jack and there was work to be done: yard work to do, a leaky roof to fix, walls to repaint, and dinner to get on the table as Cas couldn’t cook for shit. He felt his favorite moments of the day were passing through the porch or the living room or the kitchen table where Cas was sitting with Jack bent over a textbook and pressing kisses into each of their heads. For the house itself, he had really no complaints, he enjoyed working on it, Cas himself kept things pretty clean and tidy, and the only problem was how drafty it got as if it wasn’t raining or too windy Jack and and Cas insisted on keeping the windows open. He wouldn’t complain about that.
“I love you too,” he told him and hugged Dean tightly. Dean patted his back and when they pulled away, he wiped the kid’s wet face. “I’m gonna go get the flour now.”
“Ignore me, fine, but at least spend some time with him. He’s beginning to worry you hate him,” Cas told him and then headed inside. Dean watched him wander into the house with an ache in his chest.
“Jack?” She asked him and he nodded. She stepped closer and he reached out and grabbed her arm with his hand. He received a flood of images and when he pulled away he understood. She knew his father, knew Castiel, thought of him as halfway a father herself. He smiled at her then. He assumed his dad must not be far behind. “I’m Claire.”
“I want you to know something, kid,” Dean told him and Jack turned his head to face him. “This isn’t your fault. None of it. Hell, you saved the damn day. You shouldn’t worry what your dad thinks he… he knows how much you loved him. He isn't angry. He would never be angry at you. What happened was horrible and evil but that wasn’t your fault. I promise you. Won’t do you any good to blame yourself either. He sure wouldn’t want that. He loved you more than anything and I know…” Dean’s voice caught but he controlled himself, “I know he’s still looking out for you even now. He’s always with you, alright?”
“Jack…” he began and Jack jumped off the bed.
“You’re alright now,” Cas told him quietly. “I’ve got you.”
such a baby, that when Cas looked at his soul it was so shockingly young, just a little slip of a thing, and by virtue of that he was innocent. Children never believe you when you say things like that. It had never helped him with Claire either, in his well meaning but shoddy attempts to parent her. He heard her prayers once in a while too, simple little things on hunts and before bed. He had never been more grateful for Jody Mills in his whole life.
“Anyway, I think I know why you’re staying away so long. It’s because I trusted the bad man and went with him when he said you weren’t my daddy. And that was really wrong and I think you’re angry about it! Or maybe even sad because I let him trick me but I never believed him! I always knew you were my real daddy! I just didn’t know what to do! I promise. I hope you aren’t sad or think I don’t love you anymore because I do. I really love and miss you and I want you to come back. I need you to.” Jack finished his little prayer with that and sat silently for a moment, staring at the marker and running his fingers over the letters he was just learning to read. Then he launched back into his litany of describing his day to Cas.
“That was it for my grace. I’ve been fully human ever since. And as for Jack, when she died, her last thoughts were for him to stay safe and hidden and young-”
“Right…” Dean said. “You know that’s not what I mean.”
“You don’t think they’ll certainly be a war do you?”
After winning, beating Chuck, beating Billie, beating the Empty, and finally getting their lives back, they weren’t able to savor it for even a moment. It was after Cas had become human to escape a fate worse than death; after Dean had finally found the courage to put all his love for him into words and he had responded in kind, releasing years of longing and repression and a desire strong enough to defy God himself, and somehow that still wasn’t enough. The brothers had made things right between them, Sam had gone off to move in with Eileen, and Cas had thought if the three of them stayed behind at the bunker and just
Dean seemed to trail off for a moment, as if he was searching for the right thing to say.
“Yes, I saw your little struggle earlier, I do hope you’re alright,” he told her.
“Why did you?” Jack asked.
“I’ll take care of the money. Don’t worry about money. Don’t
, she thought. Ruby shook her head and sucked on her finger.
“He’s got rights! You can’t just take him away, we were in the woods! I’m telling you!”
, he wondered,
He wasn’t lying, he told himself that, though Jack did not seem to believe him. Instead he simply clung to him tighter as they suddenly felt themselves adrift, the rush of water over them. The angels had sealed the coffin well, though. The water wouldn’t get in. “We’re safe,” he kept whispering to the boy in his arms, “I have you.”
“Do what?” Jack asked.
“Cas, after all the shit you’ve done for me, I’d consider us about even,” Dean told him. “And if you’re so grateful then that still leaves my question: why are you mad at me?”
Dean had left the room after that and Cas couldn’t remember a moment of feeling more devastatingly helpless besides when he had watched Chuck murder their son. All he could do was wrap Jack up in his arms and try to calm him down. Jack who, of course, blamed himself. Said he was the reason they had lost their happy ending yet again, and if he had just died like he was supposed to everything would be okay.
He wasn’t even thinking about Dean at that moment but it was then that Dean had burst from his captors. He hadn’t gotten very far in his state, and Dean was, he noticed, getting old too, didn’t move like he used to, and was soon grabbed again and forced to his knees.
So they had set up camp in the old house, put back up the wardings, and hoped it would last. After a week though, his mother and the Banes drove back up to Canada and he was left with Sam, Rowena, and Crowley to watch after the recuperating father and son. They all took shifts and got the pair whatever they needed, which was very little besides space and quiet as they struggled to readjust to this new reality. Months in darkness, in nothingness, he couldn’t imagine. At least hell had been something and even that, well that had been no picnic to get over. He still hadn’t gotten over it, he knew, if he thought about it too hard.
“Don’t get all flustered.”
“To save you,” he admitted and knew how idiotic that sounded.
“You know it’s only a year before Jack goes off to college,” she began and Cas shook his head.
“Mmm, maybe mummy had an affair with an Irishman.”
“Can’t I?”
The image of Anna begging for her life from him gave him some sort of sick pleasure.
“Nice sky today,” Dean remarked and Cas nodded.
“Only when he touches me and only if I want him to. It’s not invasive, it's… just another form of communication. I don’t know how to explain it,” Cas told him. “Anyway, he sensed her last thoughts and used them to create a sort of barrier around the property, it’s what keeps us safe. No one can get in but us. And he hasn’t used his grace since then, his powers seem to be projected out of him, tied up with the barrier. One day, I suppose, he’ll grow big enough to leave and get his powers back as he goes. But for now, he’s just a human child, albeit one with wings that grow bigger by the day. But you can’t see those of course.”
“He wants to be, what a barrister?”
“Your mom told Jody who told me,” she said plainly. “I want a fucking crack at Satan he’s ruined my life just as much as he ruined yours.”
“It can’t be,” Dean whispered. “Oh God.”
“I’m very sorry for all of this,” Dean started and Cas found himself shaking his head.
“What’s going on?” He asked.
They started seeing each other a little more after that. Dean came to more holidays and there were other things, too. Sam and Eileen’s wedding, finally, Patience’s college graduation, Alex’s engagement party to some guy he
“My, my, keep it up,” Ketch laughed. At the top of the stairs, Anna appeared.
“How are things with you and Kaia?” He asked with a bit of a joke in his voice and she rolled her eyes and heaved a sigh. “I know you don’t want me putting my nose in your life, Claire. It was the last thing I’d ever want my old man to do to me. I just know you haven’t seen her in a while.”
“What’s the matter? Hey, what’s wrong?” He asked and Jack could barely speak, he was sobbing so hard. Eventually, he was able to get him to breathe and he stared at him, forcing his blue eyes to focus.
“And he took a first too.” Gabriel told him with pride.
“She said she couldn’t go alone. You’re an awful brother to not go with her,” he replied.
“Angels are telepathic beings, Dean. Jack and I have a deep psychic bond, he had one with his mother too, for the little time she was alive,” Cas elaborated.
In the morning, when the inferno died down, he had to figure out his next steps. He couldn’t burn Cas, not after that. So instead he rummaged through the wreckage for some still intact wood, and drove down to the local hardware store for nails. He constructed the coffin in quick time, it wasn’t polished but it would serve, he decided, and he felt that Cas would like that it was built from his own house. He’d have to like something. Once it was done he picked Cas up, his body heavy in death and gently laid him in it, using his own shirt as a pillow for his head. Next to him he put a flashlight and a knife, just in case, he thought.
“I’ll come along, miss, if you’d like.” Anna’s eyes glittered, just slightly.
He led him upstairs to Jack’s bedroom where he found his son held by Enochian handcuffs and surrounded by demons, yellow eyed Asmodeus standing in the corner smiling at Lucifer.
“Dean, it wasn’t lack of trust. I didn’t want to burden you,” he admitted. Dean shook his head yet again and Cas could feel tears landing onto his hand.
“I had grown too big, my world view was too narrow. And there were things I wanted to find, to experience, that I wouldn’t have found safe at home, obeying my father, letting my brothers take care of me,” his father explained. “It was scary and it was hard, and at times I wished I hadn’t. At times I got badly hurt, but it was worth it.”
“He’s the fisherman, isn’t he dad?” Jack asked quietly. Cas nodded, dazed. “I told you so. You didn’t believe me.”
“Thank you for taking care of him for me,” he said. Cas nodded stiffly. “Come on Jack, we have so much to do.”
Claire, they saw more than just holidays. She often passed through on a case, sometimes with Kaia, sometimes without. Cas was never sure exactly when they were on or off and he didn’t know how to ask. He had brought it up to her awkwardly once while doing dishes and she had basically shut it down in a way that was so comically like Dean he had to stifle a laugh. He liked Kaia a lot and thought she was good for her, calmed her down, but of course, he was the first to know how hard those things could be. Things, in general, seemed to have smoothed between him and Claire and he loved having her around. She was, of course, so obviously all Dean, in the same way that Jack was all Cas, but that pain wasn’t entirely new. He saw Dean in Jack every day in ways he was still learning to bear, from the way he drank beer to the way he laughed, to the radio station he’d turn to or how he rested his arm out the car window. It was in bigger moments too, like in their rare fights. Claire was just that writ large.
“Sorry I’m not in the habit of lying about things like the dons are at Cambridge,” Ketch had a sharpness in his voice that again reminded Cas of his hard face in the great hall earlier. “Get it in your head, we’re heading for a war. The only thing we can do now is to find a way to make it a prosperous venture for us.”
They’d never spoken of these feelings, but they were facts between them. There had been two nights: once when he worked at the Gas n Sip after defeating Ephraim, slow and quiet and sad in Dean’s motel room, and once, desperate and furious in the bunker in the middle of the night after he was nearly killed by Ramiel. Both times had been cloaked in shame and done without a word before and after, the first time Dean had been up and dressed and silent by the time he woke up. The second time, he himself had been gone before Dean awoke. He couldn’t help but notice the sad fact that such things only happened whenever Dean was confronted with the reality of losing him. They couldn’t make love when things were peaceful and easy.
“This isn’t a burden, Cas.”
“Get out of my library,” Dean barked and she laughed and went off. He shook his head in the darkness and considered her freeness. He imagined being that free about Cas, talking like that with Sam, Cas gossiping with Rowena, Dean telling people in town that Cas was his lover. He even imagined taking Jack places and saying “yeah, this is my boyfriend’s kid,” and grinning with pride when they called him cute. He let his brain go so far as to picture leaving Claire to babysit Jack while he took Cas out somewhere nice before his heart clenched at his memory of the reality of it all and he drowned himself so deep in drink he thought he might never swim to the shore.
he’d pointed to his heart
“He’s not a force we can control anymore. And the things he says to the nurses, the things of the family, of all the unpleasantness in 1935, well it could easily get to the presses. And things might get out of hands…” Ishim trailed off and Naomi nodded.
Dean had told them over dinner that night (Cas had insisted he stay) that it was probably something simple, just a witch or a vamp or something and he’d clean it up in a day or two. Told them not to stay out late at night but in general probably it was nothing to worry about. Jack had begged him to let him help but Dean had given Cas one look and knew he had to say no.
“Your son is fine,” Billie assured him. “He’s with Dean, Lucifer is gone. They’re safe. You have nothing to worry about.”
“Well, I mean, it was you,” Cas said softly and Dean raised an eyebrow at him in response. He sighed and turned away, dealing with something on the stove. “I’ve… he’s heard about you a lot. From me. I think he knew you wouldn’t hurt him… hoped you wouldn’t.”
“He can’t remember who he is,” Jack said quietly. “I took that from him.”
“Can you give this to Cas?” He said, holding out the letter, she took it gingerly.
“Why are you doing that?”
“Are you satisfied? Have you humiliated me enough? I’ve said it,” Cas sobbed. “I’m not ashamed of it and you can’t make me be. I’m not ashamed of Jack, of what I’ve become, how I’m nothing now, and I’m not ashamed of loving you. I’m not. I won’t be! No one can make me!”
“I don’t know why you’re offering this to me of all people.” There was the familiar coldness in Dean’s voice and Cas felt something slip away beneath his feet that he had thought was finally becoming solid.
“It’s just me,” Cas replied, echoing an old joke. Dean didn’t smile. He just kept shaking his head. “I’m back. I’m here. I’m safe. We’re all safe.”
“You shouldn’t let them do that you know,” the younger brother said, referring to Dean’s task. “Work when you’re working, nothing when you’re not.”
Cas shook his head and took Jack’s face in his hands.
“My children aren’t staying under the same roof as that man,” Cas said, harsh and unrelenting. “He’s your father and you love him and want to help him through a rough patch, that’s all fine and good, I respect that. Family is important to you. But I’ve told you time and again, I don’t want them near him anymore.”
Claire had decided she wanted the ticket, though seemed a little uncomfortable about it, having dropped out her junior year herself. He had told her not to feel obligated but she had laughed.
“Daddy?” Jack quietly called and Cas reached his head up and looked at him. “I heard yelling…”
Gabriel was sent to gently lead Cas back to the house. Cas felt he moved along numbly, like a child led up to bedtime. He was shepherded into one of the sitting rooms and the doors were closed behind him. Gabe helped him to sit on a sofa and from somewhere a blanket was procured to be wrapped around his shoulders and a cup of tea was put in hands that he drank from perfunctorily. He surveyed the room: Anna sat in an armchair across from him, her legs folded at the ankles, a piece of paper on her lap. His mother sat beside him and had a hand that was wiping at his sweaty hair. Gabe, however, had moved into the darkness of a corner and was drinking a glass of brandy with his back turned. Later, Cas would think that should have been a clue. He wanted to start protesting Dean’s innocence, to demand to be allowed to see him, to call them all hypocrites but instead he did nothing and just let himself sink numbly into the warmth of the sofa and the smell of his mother’s perfume. She put her hand to his forehead as if checking his temperature.
“I have to say goodbye to Dean first,” Cas elaborated. “And then I’ll be right with you.”
“Oh, anyone who doesn’t is going to look a fool in a year or two,” Ketch interjected casually. “I’ve been talking to a chap I know in the ministry of defense. Trying to figure out a way so that it’s my bars in the boys kits. I’d bet you anything, 3 years from now, at most, that Winchester boy will be sitting in a trench in Germany taking a bite out of one of my brand new “amo bars.””
“Well what do I do? I want him to have as close to a normal life as possible,” Cas had asked her.
Cas took a step back.
“You serious?” He asked her and she gave a nod.
“I’m so sorry Jack,” he said softly. Jack wanted to scream.
“I don’t care,” Dean repeated. “I don’t care about any of that Cas.”
“It’s the principle of the thing,” Sam huffed, “You know at Oxford there was lots of talk.”
“You’re both disgusting,” Cas spat, and flipped back under the water. It wasn’t as clear as the fountain, but he had the same calm as before, like he could stay there forever.
“You can’t tell anyone Ruby.” Anna told her firmly.
There had been a lot of monolouging but it hadn’t taken very long for Cas to figure the rest of it out. They were a group of hunters, radicalized by he didn’t know what. They had gotten it into their heads to take out Jack because, despite him being the reason they and everyone they knew were still alive, he was too dangerous and powerful to live. They had been spending months searching for the two of them and had tracked them to the town, kidnapping people to torture for their location, killing them when they didn’t know. Clearly, Cas wanted to roll his eyes and say, they weren’t especially good hunters for all the time it took them, but he wouldn’t say that with Jack tied up like he was. In fact, it was taking everything in Cas currently to just sit there and be calm as Jack was vulnerable and in agony right in front of him and he couldn’t even simply hold him, stroke his hair and tell him it would be okay as he so desperately wanted to. The hunters had finally figured out their identity and location and abducted them both but not before they had captured Dean when he caught onto them and, evidently, tortured him for their location. Dean had taken the torture silently and not given them up for anything.
“I promise, Jack,” Cas said. Lucifer took the handcuffs off him then stood up and held out his hand. Jack looked at it and then at Cas.
, Jack,” Cas had told him. “And I hope for your sake it’s nothing like
“You should get to bed, quite soon, right as we finish, our little talk alright?” Naomi looked at him and Cas nodded weakly. “Castiel, Anna has told me some things that...well they distrubed me. And I telephoned your father, and they seemed to disturb him too. Now, there’s no need to rehash, or attempt to explain. It all feels quite clear to me, quite clear to all of us, that you aren’t well. And as you haven’t reached your majority yet, so in the eyes of the law your father and I are still your caretakers, we feel it’s our duty to do all we can to take care of you.”
He was obsessed. Rightfully so, he had to admit. Wherever Cas was he was at best just brainwashed at worst kidnapped and tortured. He needed Dean, desperately. Dean thought he could feel him crying out to him and dreamed of awful fates awaiting him. He tried to pretend half those dreams weren’t memories of pain he had inflicted on Cas with his own hands.
“Don’t talk like that,” Dean whispered gently. Cas smiled sadly.
“Maybe,” Asmodeus considered. “But you’ll burn first.”
“I understand, let me go to him, I’m begging you,” he told her, fierce, unrepentant, and uncowed. She waved her hands at the angels holding him and they led him towards the box. Jack for his part, was sobbing, unable to get a word out. With all the grace he could muster, Cas stepped into the box and laid down beside his son, quickly wrapping him in his arms and kissing his temple. He looked up at Naomi one last time. “Thank you,” he said. She nodded.
“Just about one,” Dean replied, and tucked Claire in, quickly moving back over towards where Cas sat on the sofa, wanting to keep their conversation from waking the two children. “Traffic was shit-”
“No, not soon at all, you’ll be my sweet baby for a very long time, safe and home with me, and I wouldn’t have it any other way,” his father replied and kissed his forehead. He picked him up then, shifting him onto his hip and inspecting his face to see if his tears had fully dried. “Let’s fix you some lunch.”
“It’s a bit on the nose, I suppose,” Anna admitted. Sam tensed.
“My sweet boy,” he told him. He bounced him in his arms for a moment then savoring Jack’s giggles. He was so precious to him and he wondered if it was selfish of him to hope it might stay like this always.
“I would recommend, of course, him continuing in my care. But Gabriel is right, he hasn’t improved and he’s obviously in a lot of pain. And he disobeys orders. Nurses have found him attempting to write to Mister Winchester,” Ishim said and Anna felt a bolt go through her spine at that name as her mother tightened her grip on the arms of her chair. “He causes fits. He attempts to run off. He’s no good. It can’t go on like this.”
“Cas was my best friend,” Dean insisted. Rowena raised an eyebrow.
“All I’m saying is where do you think those lovely blue eyes come from?” Anna laughed. “Gabe and I both have hazel.”
“He’s an invert and a sex maniac, of course it was him. I saw him earlier, attacking my little brother in the library. I don’t know what he would have done if I hadn’t come in when I did.” Ruby was sobbing again and so Anna attempted to soothe her, to rub her back and make her quiet down.
Naomi came forward with the Ma’lak box and presented Jack’s fate as somewhere between a mercy and a necessary evil. Cas, for his part, finally fully hated his own father. The idea of locking your child up, alone and afraid, in the dark for all eternity, innocent as Jack was or guilty as Lucifer had been, was abominable. He suddenly realized how unforgivable it had been of his father to willingly do such a thing to his own son. He struggled harder than he had thought he ever had in his life as Jack seemed to simply grow pale and frightened. Cas wondered just how much of his young brain could even understand this, what did eternity mean to him? A few seconds alone in the dark would be hell enough to someone who’d lived so little life. He wouldn’t be able to even touch the true horror of forever.
Cas swallowed, but kept Dean’s gaze.
“My room has a window Cas! I’ve never had a window!” He had told him, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet and Cas had smiled at him as he cleaned the fridge (left covered in a weird grey film from the previous inhabitants). They had put on Crosby, Stills & Nash as they moved in all their stuff, the rock music ban lifted when he had seen Jack’s puppy dog eyes (though “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” was still skipped). And Cas wondered if they both thought that it would fill the void of the missing man who would’ve most demanded it to be played. Cas painted Jack’s room yellow because he knew it was his favorite color and stocked up the cupboards with sugary cereal. After all he had been through, he thought, a cavity was the least of their worries.
“Please. Come on pal, I can’t do it myself.” His green eyes pleaded and she sighed and took it.
After dinner, it was Anna who discovered the note the twins had discarded on the table in the parlor and set the house into a tizzy. Everyone had expected Ruby to burst into tears after finding a letter where her little brothers wrote both how much they hated her and that they were running off into the woods in the middle of the night. Both Sam and Ketch had been at her side within moments, instead she had looked bored and had said they were probably just hiding somewhere in the house itself.
