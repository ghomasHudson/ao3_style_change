John is sitting in the kitchen of Sherlock's childhood home, and somehow he looks so easy to reach. For as long as they are here, he is entirely Sherlock's. There are no distractions and no potential girlfriends, only Sherlock and his history and his parents. John is here to witness it all. Sherlock is at once shy at letting him see, and eager to show him every last millimetre of this place.
The immediacy of the moment is almost too much, yet Sherlock cannot break away from John’s earnest gaze.
I had forgotten where I was heading. Not wanting to eavesdrop any more on an obviously intimate conversation, I turned around and left the same way I came.
“Yes”, Sherlock says gravely, slipping his right hand out of John's hair to cup his neck. “Two days in this climate is sufficient for your hair to start bleaching in the sun.”
My own ragged breathing was deafening in my ears. Sherlock was otherworldly, all high cheekbones and perfect curls, marble skin and expensive jewels. When he stood in the high tower in the arms of Paris' most powerful man, it was so obvious to me that he could never be mine. I must be a fool, writing poetry and songs and a whole bloody show for a man I was never meant to have.
This is what he must have looked like, holding me and waltzing. This waltz creates not only a link between her and me, but a chain that comes all the way from my own Father. It almost makes her a Holmes.
“Come on, you think this is funny. For all that he wants us to believe him to be a good, moral person standing above all the rest of us, he has never opened this book – not once.”
Then why didn't you SAY SOMETHING TO ME? How could you let me think that? Whatever the stakes, how could you let me think that? Why did you choose
He didn't look into my eyes again, and he didn't say anything else before he let the door fall shut behind him. And that lack of connection was what made me realise that it had happened. In the shift from one moment into the next – the shift from the tender press of lips into pulling back, damp skin clinging for just a second – he had ended us.
The thick fabric parted around his white chest. He sat up to let his arms slide out of the sleeves, and all that was left was the most beautiful man I'd ever seen, bared in my bed. I followed him back down onto the covers, already kissing with open mouths.
He looks rumpled in a both adorable and enticing way. Something unbearably tender blooms in Sherlock's chest. John toys with a curl on Sherlock's head before tucking it behind his ear.
“Well, what they don't realise is that the Maharajah knows what is going on and lets it happen.” I was struck by inspiration now. The story was laying itself out for me like a path, and I only needed to follow it. “The Maharajah's soul is very dark indeed. He isn't satisfied with just having the Hindu Dancer as his own; he wants to destroy him single-handedly, he wants there to be nothing left in the Dancer's world but the Maharajah himself. He wants to be so deeply hated that the hate turns into love – then he will truly own the Hindu Dancer in every way. So the Maharajah lets him conduct his love affair with the Sitar-Player, because he believes love to be a weakness that will wear the Dancer down. He believes this will ultimately be the weapon that allows him to conquer the Dancer.”
Holm William and I have the dance floor to ourselves. The fiddler stands in his usual place in the middle and we're on opposite sides of him, walking in wide circles. The benches along the walls are crowded with people who watch us with anticipation. You can see in their eyes, in the way they lean forward with elbows on their knees, that it's been some time since there last was a halling contest in Sidensjö.
My hands come up to rest on her back through the fabric of the carrier, letting the warm lump of her reassure me. Her head rests just below my chin, bathing me in her comforting scent.
We make it down the stairs to the basement. Luckily, the door to the workshop isn't entirely closed; I only have to push it to silently slide it open. We walk inside and I carefully close the door behind us. When I turn back to the room, William is already halfway across the large space, eyes rapidly sweeping over materials, tools and half-finished wood-creations.
His voice was softer when he spoke again. “My parents were gone. I can't even remember them. Never had a home besides the gutters of Paris. I was fourteen when I first tried drugs – I don't know what took me so long, really.”
John did grieve the loss of Mary. But most of all, he grieved the way his life had turned out; OUR life, I suppose. From the moment he watched me fall and up until the shooting, when he nearly had to watch me die all over again. I believe it was less about the lost life as Mary Watson's husband and more about being a pawn in a game, with his unborn daughter ultimately on the line.
At two a.m., John is soaring between wakefulness and sleep. A soft, warm pressure meets his lips, endlessly careful, and the wonderful scent of Sherlock's skin fills him. He lies still, distantly aware of Sherlock pulling back just as slowly. There is a whisper across his cheek: “I love you”, before sleep draws him in deeper.
Sherlock's back hit the far wall before he was even aware of backing. He stared at Moriarty without blinking until his eyes stung.
Peace isn't a word I ever thought I'd use to describe my life with Sherlock, and some days it really isn't fitting at all. Some days it's all dangerous criminals in every back alley and fierce breath in our throats. Some days it's furious tearing at clothes and demands to have or be had over every possible and impossible piece of furniture. Some days it's scars rubbed the wrong way and grief and heartbreak flaming up at every turn.
That morning, I tried to do some writing in the rehearsal room. But it was impossible when Sherlock was on stage, undoing the button of his suit jacket and showing off more of his red silk shirt. When I caught myself staring for the tenth time, lips embarrassingly parted, I gave up and set up the typewriter at my usual table in the coffee room.
“Yes, I know that”, he smiled condescendingly. “But I can't assume you will be any different from the imbeciles in the music section, now can I? I always have to do everything myself.”
“Come back to bed”, I said. He just took another drag of the cigarette, his hand shaking with the cold. I fetched the blanket from the sofa, draped it around his shoulders, took the cigarette from him and put it out. He turned his head then, looked at me with dark, terrified, wide open eyes. I eased open his grip around the cigarette package, slick with cold sweat.
William doesn't so much as glance in my direction, and I do my damnedest not to look at him either. But the space between us buzzes with a strange tension. We don't have to touch; we don't even have to look at each other to be somehow connected.
I don't know how many days it's been since I wrote the previous chapter, as the nights blur together in sorrow and alcohol. If I had to guess, I'd say a week, maybe more. I was sure that I was done trying to do this.
“Yeah”, John smiles. He threads his fingers through Sherlock's hair. There is another cascade of sparkling stars above them, and John tips his head back to look at it. “Nice setting, too.”
Then they close the windows and have sex. It's more intense than it's been in a while, even though the smell stays as an undercurrent through the whole thing.
I kissed him. My lips were stretched in a foolish smile, making the kiss clumsy and silly. The world was roaring with hundreds of people applauding us.
The forty-sixth year, their grandchild gets his first violin. John and Sherlock travel to London for never-ending concerts at music school. The seats are hard and everyone except for their boy is terrible, but it is always worth it for seeing his grave concentration on stage and his radiant eyes afterwards.
“Do we not?” Sherlock murmurs, hovering just above him. John opens his eyes, finding Sherlock's still closed. He looks soft, his eyelids smooth. “But you have to admit, John, the lines are somewhat arbitrary.”
“Why this pattern?” William lifts his hand to touch the carved image of a flower tendril weaving its way upwards. He runs his finger over the little bees sitting in the flowers.
“They wouldn't be able to charge that much if he wasn't worth it”, he answered. Just then, we passed a skinny woman in the shadows of a vault, and she slid the strap of her tacky dress off her shoulder in invitation. I lowered my eyes to the cobblestones, wishing I hadn't seen her filthy skin and the way she turned her eyes away. I had never paid for love, and had no intention of ever doing so.
What I told William last Sunday turns out to be right; the summer-warmth arrives for Midsummer. Even this early in the day the sun heats the bare skin of my arms. There's a sort of wonder in it, I can feel it every year; summer
I glanced up. He was looking around as if to see if he had forgotten something, but I saw that he was trying to hide a smile.
At five thirty, John is making lasagne. When Sherlock approaches, John dries his hands on a towel in the corner, and then goes to stand at the other side of the table. Sherlock frowns and follows him, but John just goes back to the other side.
“Stamford, what imbecile did you allow to arrange the backing instruments?” Sherlock demanded. Molly looked relieved at not being the target of his antics.
At nine p.m., they are in the middle of a parlour game. John kicks Sherlock's ass with it, and Sherlock kisses him with the sourest “Happy New Year” a human is capable of. Mrs Hudson looks confused.
He gets back home with an emptiness settled in the corners of his mouth, the hollows of his cheeks, the dark blue of his eyes. It's a strange kind of sadness. He doesn't feel as though he'll miss her, really. He only feels drained, as if the whole relationship has sucked him dry of something he didn't know he needed.
Sherlock looks silently at their hands. “Neither had I”, he whispers and looks up at John once again. John watches him, his best friend, his beautiful lover, the funniest, sweetest, most brilliant, most blazing man.
William creeps behind me so silently that I keep wondering if he's still there. If I concentrate, though, I can hear his breath. Sometimes I feel it rustling the hair on the back of my head. It sends a peculiar thrill down my spine.
I looked up and let out a sigh of reverence. The autumn had come upon us, and the afternoon sky was high and clear, a light blue that seemed to expand further up than it ever had before. It had been obscured by clouds for days on end, but today the sun was there, glittering on the golden handrails at the sides of the elephant's back. The air was crisp and clean, like breathing in the high sky and the pale sunlight.
John is looking down at him. His face is puffy with sleep, and his eyes are shockingly blue. His short fringe is standing straight up. It looks ridiculous.
When I got out of Stamford's flat, I saw a glimpse of Sherlock running down the stairs, disappearing around a corner of the staircase. “Sherlock!” I called, but the only answer I got was the clatter of hard soles against the stone stairs. I ran after him, and saw him when he passed my door on the floor below.
“Your brother was concerned. He thought you might harbour some fantasies of escaping.” He pressed his lips together and shook his head in mock reproach. “Holmes might be hesitant to go to certain lengths to protect what's important. But he can recognise a man who doesn't have such scruples.”
He plants his feet in the earth and starts swinging, remembering the exhilarating swoop in his stomach when he gains speed, remembering the calculations he made back when he learned how high he could swing before it became dangerous.
The red entrance below opened a fraction and a tall figure hurried across the street. His hair was hidden under a black hat, but even in the darkness I recognised his gait and his characteristic coat. He was out of breath when he burst into my room minutes later, shrugging off his outerwear.
She keeps staring up at me when I hold the bottle to her mouth. She drinks without fuss, apparently unperturbed about the food coming from me today. To her, that's the way things are and always have been; there is John and there is Sherlock, helping her stay alive.
She grows and changes every day. But when she is asleep like this, head just below my clavicle and face tipped up, mouth hanging open… she looks just the way she did on her second day when I held her against my skin. Now in retrospect I see how profound that moment was. It is etched into my mind irrevocably. I wonder if this is the way it's going to be for the rest of her life; if no matter how much she grows, when her head is at a certain angle I will always see that moment in her.
I note with wonder how all that seemed hugely important before is paling into insignificance when I hold this little person in my arms. Fear, heartbreak and lost hopes lose their weight in the face of her acute presence. Looking at her, it doesn't seem so daunting to bear it any more.
The room is silent for a moment, long enough for Sherlock to get nervous. But the follow-up question doesn’t come.
But he's kept on doing it like he's hell-bent on being able to talk about this. So I started doing it too, and I see the point now. I'm actually proud of him for it – because we need to be able to talk about this if we're ever gonna… I don't know. Whatever we're gonna do.
He finally feels my eyes on him and looks up. Our eyes meet in the low light from the candle. My breath stops in my throat when I see the look on his face. His pupils are huge, black pools, and his lips are slightly parted. He looks… hungry,
Sherlock smiles warmly. His curls are glistening with dew, letting the moon pour silver light onto them. Suddenly John doesn't mind the damp so much, and when he steps closer to the iron gate he isn't even that cold.
The forty-first year, Rosie has a child. All Sherlock wants to do is carry him around constantly. John takes sofa naps in the afternoons with the baby on his chest, and the weight seems to mend all that is wrong with the world.
“I didn't love her”, John says, meeting Sherlock's eyes. “And I regret that I was ever with her. It was just a substitute for you.” Sherlock looks down at his hands. “I realise that doesn't change what happened, though”, John continues. “I did leave you to be with her.”
“You shouldn't be in here.” I shouldn't either – I shouldn't feel so at ease in Anderson's office, just because I was in there with this madman.
My heartbeat quickened, and I leaned forward to place a soft kiss at the corner of his mouth. It twitched upwards under my touch, and I wrapped my arm around him.
“John, people may see him as a cold, calculating machine, whose only goal is to trick men into giving him what he wants. But we both know that's not the true Sherlock.”
Stamford had lived next door to me during my first years at university, and he had been a close friend of mine at the time. We were technically on the same course, though he rarely made an appearance, lacking the discipline for medical studies. Instead, he would spend every evening playing his piano. He had quite the talent for composing, and I greatly enjoyed hearing the notes in my walls when I was reading late at night.
can only mean one thing. He knows that if he doesn't break their eye contact within half a second, John will take it as permission to kiss him.
with me. He's inviting me to have fun with him in the middle of our contest. I follow him across the dance floor, chasing him just a step behind with my arms spread wide. It works on the audience; they start clapping in time with the music, urging me on. One point to me, I guess.
. I needed him to move in me, I wanted him to slam into me, as deeply as humanly possible, until he had claimed every part of me, every last cell of my body.
“We have to consider what would happen to the Work.” Sherlock turns back to John when he has ensured there is a safe distance of several feet between them.
John is just his friend, regardless of their conversation yesterday. You do not choose clothes for the benefit of your friend.
He's right, of course. He knows it, and he knows that I know it. I'm not even put out by it; I wouldn't deny him the title of Sweden's best halling dancer if he went after it. But I find that I like teasing him about it. Even though he knows he's right, he just can't leave it alone without getting the last word.
“Obviously. I bought it for Christmas. Then I recognised that, well. It would have been something of a give-away.”
This morning, I decided to just admit I'm doing this and start packing an overnight bag. So now I have my laptop here, and therefore my blog, which is helpful.
He glances at the clock and confirms that it will be another ten minutes to his bus stop. “Oh, God”, he murmurs. He can hardly breathe, and it aches between his legs.
He lives, firmly grasping my arms while I was holding his shirt so hard that the fabric hurt my palms, while I was panting or sobbing against his shoulder on the floor.
with songs from the movie. I've also added some covers that I liked, and a bit of Sherlock soundtrack, to make it into something unique for the fic. For this specific chapter, listen to
I closed my eyes and held him tighter, tears spilling onto my cheeks. “It's okay, Sherlock”, I whispered.
“Good boy.” There was a dull sparkle somewhere in Moriarty's eye. “I knew you would see it from my perspective.”
It's not even very clever. Sherlock has gone into her flat and wrecked it in the most petty way possible, just to protect John. Sherlock, who was silent that morning, halting his deductions the moment John asked him to. Sherlock, who played for John for hours the evening after the breakup. Sherlock, who genuinely cares about him, desperately though he tries to hide it.
In my haste, I bumped into a woman with short, blonde hair. She nearly lost her balance when I collided with her back, and she turned around, her body pressed against me.
Sherlock’s frown deepens. “This is a delicate and unpredictable operation. New variables keep turning up, which makes the duration impossible to estimate.”
Sherlock nodded stiffly at him. “Excuse me.” He turned on his heel and walked in the direction of his dressing room.
John smiles. So this is another one of those things, the things that Sherlock did long before they were a couple. Like learning the solar system, like composing music for him. Since they got together, he has let John see, frustrated that the words
He can see a light starting to glow behind Sherlock's eyes, lighting up in an incandescent smile. He shifts along John's body, moving his head to be level with John's.
his doctor”, I snarled to the side. Turning back to Sherlock, I pleaded with him. “Tell me, love, tell me what's wrong. I'll make it better. Let me-”
The lights were out. The darkness within the chamber had a red shade from the crimson textiles. I could only just discern the shapes of the furniture; the piano and the Indian elephant sculpture; the red sofa and the bed. The ornamented gold with the heart-shaped hole in the front was softly reflecting light from the mill and from the light bulbs in the garden.
John looks up at me, then gets to his feet without a word. He bends over the cradle to carefully lay her down. I rise to my feet when his back it turned, trying to calm my nervously beating heart.
My eyes flew open and I spun around. I had only heard him sing one single time, and already I would recognise that voice anywhere.
John is smiling at him, which is still reassuring but also just a tiny bit terrifying. He silently takes Sherlock's hand and leads him to the sofa.
Sherlock continues in a louder voice, attempting to ignore John’s laugh: “Toast sausages in the fireplace.”
“Okay, this is not as silly as it'll sound. Before I first started sleeping in your bed, I was changing my bed sheets one day and accidentally picked this up. I went to get one of my own, but I forgot to return yours, and it smelled like you which was… nice, so it kind of… stayed in my bed.”
The moon shines back at me so brightly from where it hangs safely in the sky. A massive, weightless globe overseeing whatever takes place here on Earth. If I only remember to look up at the sky, the moon greets me like the old friend it is and reminds me that some things aren't as complicated as they seem. They simply
The sparkle in Sherlock's eye, in the middle of his annoyed grimace, tells John that he sees the laughter John keeps in.
John's hand is a marvel. Soft yet rough, small yet strong, firm yet delicate. Sherlock held it, and held it, squeezed and relaxed, swept his thumb over warm skin. He held it and marvelled and gave all of his fierce attention to the beautiful structure of muscle, bones, veins and skin in his grip.
I saw it in Moriarty's eyes, that he finally looked and saw the soldier. He saw something of what Sherlock saw. He saw something deep and consuming between us that it was too late to quell. And he knew that he had made a mistake in allowing me in his game for so long.
I hope you enjoyed the beginning, and I'll see you soon for chapter 2! It'll get posted as soon as my beta is finished with it, which shouldn't take too long - we both want to spread any joy we can in these times of distress. Love to you all!
Sherlock was terrifying like this, all impeccable suit and blazing eyes, tongue sharper than a knife. The composer looked pale and he glanced at Stamford and me for support. He wasn't going to get it from me.
Thompson was vibrant with the spring. We let her loose. She splattered wet snow on our trousers. Sherlock didn't manage to say anything about it. Neither of us had a voice.
It hurts so much to love him. And even so, I just keep… doing it. I love him. I love him. I love him. I
Sherlock frowns in what could be genuine confusion. “Because then you wouldn't have given me oral sex through an iron gate – John, do keep up.”
I stood in the doorway for a while, watching him and wondering how many times, and in how many shapes, his beauty would fill my chest until there was no room for breathing.
Sherlock lets out a deep sigh the moment John's arm curls around his chest again, and his closed-mouthed moan seeps into John's skin, warming him.
“Magnificent”, he said, aiming a cramped smile towards the stage. “Good work.” He stopped and turned to Moriarty. “I trust that you find your generous offer has been well used.”
“It's just, there are so many things you could have done”, John says, trying not to giggle through it. “
I loved him and he's right here, I love him and he's right here, and I can't, I can't, and I'm so, so… He ruined it and I wish I could hate him for it, but I don't, I just love him, I love him, and so the hurt never goes away. He ruined it and I can see how much he regrets it. I can. But it doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter because I feel like the sorrow is eating my chest. I just can't.
The mighty flames embed themselves in my chest. They roar and dance and declare beyond a shadow of doubt that spring has come. The choir sings
But I'm not happy. How are you so thick? How have you not deduced this??? We broke up. I can't be with her. I can't be with anyone but you.
The tension left me in a loud breath like a silent laugh. I looked at Sherlock, and my breath caught in my chest when he met my eyes with the first genuine smile he had ever given me.
I forgot. For how many minutes? Hours? I can't tell how long I've been sitting here. I didn't even savour it, the bliss of oblivion.
“Christmas?” Sherlock scowls, but the light in his eyes is still there. “Why would you think that I was planning on acknowledging a pagan celebration of an astronomy-related phenomenon, hijacked by Christianity and subsequently exploited by capitalistic and commercial interests?”
When I'm not paying attention, I forget everything around us. Sherlock is all I can see, hear and think. Only what he's saying matters, and when he jokes I can't stop laughing. One time I did notice Greg saying my name pretty loudly, and I cut myself off mid-giggle, embarrassed that I'd all but forgotten he was there.
He's still coming when Sherlock suddenly withdraws his hand, zipping John's fly, and half a second later, there's a ding and the doors slide open. John registers that there's a person standing there and quickly bends down to hide his face, snatching the jumper and the jacket which must have fallen to the floor at some point. When he straightens, Sherlock has already shoved past the woman. John is careful not to meet her eyes when he enters the corridor, wondering how obvious his arousal blush is.
John looks different from here. Lying next to Sherlock on top of the sheets, he looks softer and more rumpled than Sherlock has previously had the privilege of seeing him. His nose looks different from this angle, too.
And a lunatic. Sometimes I want nothing to do with him and I go away. Then I come back. Because it isn't true, it's
Part of him wants to crawl away from Sherlock's sharp eyes, sweeping over his back when John is turned away – as if he wouldn't notice – but he can't stand not spending the twenty-ninth of January with him. He wants to tell Sherlock how much meeting him meant to him, but he chokes on the words before they're even in his throat.
The sole focus of everyone present is suddenly focused on what little can be seen of her sleeping face within the fabric. I look up at them uncertainly, but they have no attention to spare for me, so I try to just sit it out until the moment passes. John ruins it all by introducing me.
When I finally gave up on writing, as well as on the secret hope that he would come back that night, he was still sitting motionless in the elephant balcony.
“Of course. I did the cutting last night.” He closed the book. It showed no trace of containing anything other than God's words.
She breaks out in loud sobbing. It fades in John's ears as his blood runs cold. He stares into the darkness while she cries in his ear. He can't think of a single thing to say.
Sherlock’s eyes roll back into his head. He allows himself a minute of absolute bliss before he chokes out: “I’ll come if you keep doing that.”
I walk along the walls and look for a girl to dance with. Once I'm on the dance floor, I try to catch William's eye. Seeing him brings back a flood of memories from last weekend; all those little things I've thought I'd forgotten during the week. Like the way he moves his head fractionally to the side when observing the room, keeping his neck straight. Or the way the corner of his mouth ticked up when he thought I'd said something interesting.
“Jeopardising our friendship. What if you fall in love with me, and I don’t fall in love with you? I don’t want to hurt you.”
When I had my Sherlock in my arms, it was unthinkable that I had believed even for a second that this wasn't real.
The manager disappeared with the girls in tow, Gregory slipping out with one last look at Sherlock. He was coughing again, the whole of his nearly-naked body convulsing with the strength of it.
“Yes – touch me!” Sherlock's gaze locked with mine as I tiptoed across the carpet, Moriarty's face pressed into his throat. Sherlock's eyes were furiously blazing, and he jerked his head to the side, indicating a curtain near the heart-shaped opening at the front. “Oooh, yes… that's
She quickly notices something is different, though. She is clever; senses the new smells and sounds, concludes she might need to be awake for this. She kicks her little legs, blinks blindly, whimpers. I pick her up.
William turns back around with a jerk of his head that draws attention to the strong line of his neck and shoulder. Then he starts showing off in earnest. For a moment, I envy him deeply. I am a decent halling dancer myself, but when William does it it looks like no effort at all. This is the most physically demanding solo-dance that can be seen in the dance barns of Sweden, and it's unfair that someone who can play the fiddle as though possessed by the devil can also move his body in this way. He drops to a crouch and kicks out his legs in a way that looks as though he's
It felt as though they were doing it all for us. Sherlock stood right on stage, smiling at me and singing that he would love me until his dying day, and he looked like a birthday child, glowing and happy and special. I smiled back at him, singing along with Molly and not caring in the slightest who saw the way I looked at him.
The first year, John finally understands why he is alive in this time and in this space. The universe rights itself and he is suddenly home. The days rush by, Sherlock rushes from crime scene to crime scene, and John spins around him, hardly able to believe Sherlock is real.
“God, yes”, John says gratefully, pretending not to hear Greg's amused snigger. He steps forward to Sherlock: “Hey, if you don't need me I'm going to get some coffee. Can I get you anything?” Sherlock just keeps sweeping his eyes over the skirting, going on about the dust pattern on it. “Right”, John nods to himself, joining Greg by the door.
I didn't realise how long and intimate our eye contact had been until Moriarty's voice pulled us out of it, an English sentence with a heavy French accent: “
For a week, John eyes every woman he sees. When one of them looks back, a thrill goes through him. She's out of his league, tall and gingery with dark lashes and a small, perfectly shaped mouth. Her sister comes into the clinic with a sprained ankle, and John successfully navigates the line of how much a doctor can flirt with the relatives before it's inappropriate.
His heartbeat is loud in his own ears. He is sweating in his thin shirt. He got out of the suit jacket at some point, thank God. And John, John has taken off his jumper, and he is burning hot through the soft cotton of his vest.
“I don't know”, I said, surprised by the sudden attention, “I just… pull it down from the air. It's all… it's all right here.” I made a vague gesture in the air above the table with an eloquence that shouldn't have impressed anyone.
William sits down on the bench beside me. If it was an effort to get him to start talking when he came to my bed, it's even harder now. He's on edge, constantly sweeping his eyes across the room. His shoulders are a stiff, self-conscious line.
The seventh year, John comes home. He's a widower – if he was really married, that is – when he limps out of hospital to collect his one-year-old daughter. The air of 221 Baker Street is calm and still, the smell of arch-enemies and threat is replaced by the smell of biscuit dough that Mrs Hudson claims Rosie made mostly by herself. John limps up the stairs and Sherlock looks as though he's trying to hide in his armchair, but John was almost killed for all this, so he doesn't let him hide. He asks if Sherlock meant what he said, and watches his face crumble just as it did last time he saw him, with his hands covered with John's blood and sirens too far away and the most secret and forbidden words coming off his lips. Sherlock nods and there really isn't much left to do besides kissing him.
Twenty-year-old Sherlock is not as skinny as the ten-year-old version was. He's still thin, but in a more compact way. More muscular – though not more so than John. And most importantly he's still ticklish. John still knows precisely where to tickle him to make him squirm and giggle.
My breaths were only a steady stream of Sherlock's name; a mockery of my own voice, a silent curse and a prayer mixing with the blood pounding in my ears.
A shadow flickered across his face when he lowered his legs again and made to turn around, but I stopped him, lifting myself up briefly to come back with my knees on either side of his hips. His eyes widened when I lowered my pelvis, trapping his cock underneath.
For the fraction of a second, his smile was sad. But then it evolved into a smirk: “If you get me out of these blasted boots before they stick to me permanently.”
The other soldiers are asleep around them, but Sherlock hasn't even bothered to change out of his borrowed fatigues. They smell of dirt and a little bit of sweat, and they rub roughly against his skin, knowing his body intimately by now. Sherlock puts his hands behind his neck and stares at the underside of the mattress above him.
Wordlessly, Sherlock puts his feet up on the edge of the sofa, wrapping his arms around his shins and putting his chin on his knees. John's thumb rests on the play button of the remote, but he hesitates, looking at Sherlock. They haven't spoken for hours. John has seen this movie more times than he can count already; that's not what's important about this.
I rose from the bed and pulled on my trousers, quickly hoisting the braces onto my shoulders without bothering with a shirt underneath. I grabbed the newest bundle of papers and got back to the bed, sitting down at Sherlock's feet.
Silence blooms from his last word, his posture as motionless as the air. John tries to keep a straight face, but he thinks about her tastefully decorated flat with the brass curtain poles, he thinks about the prawns
Sherlock walked aimlessly through the halls, every second churning in his gut and moving him closer to eight o'clock. In the tower, servants were preparing supper, and in my flat, I was lighting candles.
He didn't join the rest of us for food that day either. I kept glancing around while Gregory took me to sit with a pair of Moulin Rouge dancers, now actors in the show. One of them was Mary, smiling widely and holding my gaze for too long. The other was a brunette wearing something that might as well have been an outfit for her night-time job, and she turned to smile at me with stark red lips.
I barely leave the dance floor for the rest of the evening. My feet ache and my head is light, but I am unable to tear myself away from the spell the two fiddlers' music has on me. I keep dancing until I reach the sort of trance that only happens on a really good dance evening, where my tired mind seems to disconnect from my body, and my body just keeps dancing as though it's the easiest thing in the world. I could keep going forever. Once I've reached this state, I'd never need food or sleep ever again; only the hardwood beneath my feet and the music.
I was grateful that I had bothered with a shirt beneath the waistcoat yesterday, when Martha Hudson stepped into my flat. She had to endure the beard, though.
He watches the snowfall from his chair, holding a teacup, feeling it get cold in his hands. At this time last year, there was no snow. The ground was bare and stiff when John limped through the park, for a second considering pretending not to hear his name being called from behind.
Suddenly Sherlock feels hesitant. Cold air lingers around his neck where he was previously protected by the coat collar. He feels unsteady without his coat. But he made the decision to hang it on the hook and now here he is, strangely bare in his tailored suit.
Watching the dog, watching the undersea-rainbows, watching the inside of my eyelids. Bright with the hint of sun.
“I'm sure I will”, she said, stepping closer to me. Sherlock was still being held up by the woman, but he squirmed under her arm, and once, he cast a furtive glance at me. In a hurry to get away from me, then – that wouldn't do.
her just as she saw him. And he would say I'm stupid to worry. He would say that if there is anyone who can survive in this world, it's Martha Hudson.
Sherlock stood alone in the middle of the stage. His face was open and soft, his arms hung to his sides. He didn't hide anything, nor did he exaggerate for the sake of the show. There was nothing but Sherlock Holmes, standing in front of this audience of strangers, the whole Moulin Rouge ensemble, his brother and the duke who owned him, telling me that he had, in fact, learned to love and to be loved in return.
And if one day, one of Sherlock's pillow cases ends up in John's room, it was an honest mistake when he was changing his sheets. And if that pillow case gets folded in between the mattress and the headboard, it's only because John can't be bothered to go down the stairs and give it back.
When I'm not paying attention, I joke and tease and bicker in a way I refuse to call flirting. It does look a lot like it, though.
For a moment, John is speechless. This romantic side of Sherlock shows when he least expects it, and it leaves him dumbstruck every time. John can feel his own gaze glowing when he searches Sherlock's face. “Are you serious?”
He didn't say anything about our argument earlier, and I didn't either – somehow, this was enough. His skin, spread broad under my palms without any garment to interrupt it, was a wordless promise. I kissed him deeply, he tilted his head to accommodate me.
When the door shut behind Sherlock, I put my palms against it, bowing my head between my arms. I could feel his absence like a hole in my belly, and I was shocked by the intensity of it, the physical sensation of loss. The pain was enough to make me surrender and admit to myself that this was something I had never felt before.
We kissed four times. Each kiss with a long pause in between for us to work up the courage again. I keep replaying them all in my head, one by one.
“So this – a room full of expensive stuff that marks you as better than everyone else – that's what's important to you?”
When they get to the lobby, a policewoman walks up to John to take the phone he's holding and put it in an evidence bag. He sighs resignedly when he complies, gratefully accepting Greg's offered paper cup of coffee.
“See?” William says. “People are stupid. They won't even consider the possibility of us living together for any other reason than being two bachelors who failed to woo a girl. Not even
He knows with amazing certainty that this is exactly how Sherlock would look. Even though John has never seen a glimpse of something like that in Sherlock, he's sure that Sherlock's eyelids would be smooth and his cheeks flame just like that if he ever let anyone touch him. John has never been able to imagine anything so clearly.
Sometimes he's still surprised to find himself standing on both feet, away from that poor bedsit he'd thought he would die in. He didn't think he'd ever recognise himself as John Watson again. But it's as if Sherlock's eyes not only see everything, but also have the capacity to bring everything to life. John recognises himself, and when talking to Sherlock, he even
When I burst into the hall, it was filled with Sherlock's terrifying shouts. Diamonds were scattered everywhere, gleaming maliciously in the moonlight. Sherlock's velvet dress was tossed to the side.
. He bounces a few times, stomps lightly and swings his arms before spreading them to his sides. He walks along the edges of the floor with his face to the audience, arms spread wide, cocking his head as if to say
His lips twisted in what could pass as a smile, but mostly made him look disgusted. “I'm always 'open'.”
John's mouth is just barely touching his, yet the kiss seems to stimulate every nerve ending in Sherlock's lips, making him hold completely still in reverence.
The soldier's skin is rough from sand and sun and guns. He watches Sherlock's face while he starts to move – slow, squeezing pulls – with a nearly impassive expression. This is only a favour between mates – not even that; colleagues. And it is one John Watson has performed before, Sherlock can tell from the way he effectively angles his wrist to work inside Sherlock's pants. He watches when Sherlock's eyelids flutter, he watches when Sherlock's lips part, he watches when Sherlock stirs, digging his fingertips into the covers and shifting his hips.
The trees are bare; greys and browns interspersed with the occasional dark green from a pine tree. But the naked branches tremble with hope, hiding their precious buds of new life. The ground is wet and muddy from the melting snow; spontaneous brooks flow along the road. The yellows and browns of the fields should look sad, but to me they just look alive.
I know you have written me a few letters without delivering them. Don't worry; I have not read them, nor have I read the drafts you have privately saved on your blog (and, as you know, the note from your wallet was found by accident, not by seeking to pry). I have no interest in such an intrusion on your privacy; as I am more observant than most, it seems fair that the matters I am unable to observe remain private to you. What interests me is your writing itself. I have observed that it is highly beneficial to your health – a fact that reinforces my resolution to let you keep it to yourself. It helps you to arrange your thoughts and to process your feelings, leaving you peaceful and collected. While this is what the violin usually does for me, I am curious to try your methods.
Holmes' face hollowed. The untouchable man of ice melted away when he slowly turned his head, staring with trepidation at the weakened body on the bed. At once, Mycroft Holmes was more human than anyone had known him to be in years. His pale skin was grey and haggard, as if exhaustion crept in his very bone marrow. His eyes, always so guarded, were naked and deep. Whether it was grief or love that tormented him more, no one could tell.
John keeps his eyes fixed on Sherlock through the flickering firelight. The idea of looking away for more than a moment stirs a deep fear he can't explain. It's that relentless panic he felt when he realised Sherlock was about to swallow that pill; it's not just remnants of adrenalin, but a simmering fear that Sherlock will disappear. They have known each other for a day, yet the idea of losing him is so unthinkable that John is scared to examine what it's really about. He just keeps staring at Sherlock, making sure this madman isn't about to throw his life away again, making sure he eats at the very least.But somehow, he senses with his heart pulsing in his chest, he's just as afraid of having Sherlock as he is of losing him.
In the end it was Holmes who broke eye contact, striding out of the room without another word. Sherlock's smile was small and smug.
“Uh-huh.” John sounds a little preoccupied. Sherlock realises that his hand has dipped lower onto John’s hip, and he moves it back to safer territory to allow for John to reply. “Yeah, safeness. I feel that way too. And it’s amazing to-” He cuts himself off when Sherlock’s hand slides past his hip and onto his upper thigh.
“I think I need to frame this for you”, John says, his voice weak when he's managed to stop laughing.
It's a beautiful picture, despite the silliness of it. Mrs Hudson has a knack for photography, clearly.
John ducks his head to hide his grin. He shouldn’t laugh at this; Sherlock seems to be genuinely upset. “I’m sorry, love, I can’t help you.”
Before I could think, and because I couldn't stand hearing Stamford come up with something even worse, I spoke.
For the first time in my life I dare imagine a future. It feels reckless. I am perfectly aware that I could lose it before any of it has come to be. And I am frightened; afraid that my truest desires will turn out to be selfish ones that this child will come to despise. But I need to be honest with myself, I think. For her sake.
“Hmm.” Sherlock lets his eyes droop closed. “Nothing says romance like iron, gunpowder, aluminium and lithium burning in the sky.”
“No, that’s what I’m saying.” John pauses. “I haven’t seen anyone since you fell, you know. I’ve been rethinking some stuff for the last two years.”
But the evening ends anyway, the way evenings always do, no matter how magical. Late at night, when I'm walking back towards Drömme with Mikael and Greger, I'm astonished by what neither of them mention. They go on endlessly about the new friends they've made, but neither of them talk about Holm William… when it's all I can think about.
“Oh.” Sherlock looks around in the kitchen, again surprised at the even bigger chaos there. On the floor lies a shattered tea mug, part of the RAMC logo visible on one of the shards. The corners of his mouth twitch downwards briefly. “You can use another mug.”
I was all alone on the stage, I was all alone in the world. It was just me, futilely holding on to what I had already lost. I was nothing in the rose-petal sea, and as it spread around me, I got smaller. Just a dot on the ground.
“I'm sorry”, Sherlock said. His voice was barely there, and it stuttered with his ragged breaths. “John. I'm sorry.”
He wore his suit like armour, his chin high like a soldier, as though he needed to be prepared for battle even in the privacy of our rehearsals. And battle he did; towering tall above everyone in the room, forcing us to bend our necks to meet his eyes, he demolished all of us with his words. His voice was unrelenting, yet it was smooth like honey and deep enough to caress my very bones.
“Let me help you too”, Sherlock whispers and reaches out. Watson makes a bitten-off sound in the back of his throat when Sherlock's palm spreads over his groin. He is fully hard as well, and the realisation sends another wave of pleasure straight into Sherlock's cock. Sherlock rubs the heel of his hand over the front of Watson's fatigue trousers, and the soldier tips his head back in bliss.
I walked over for a brief kiss. I had barely pulled back before he started talking, his French so fast I could barely keep up, gesturing to the particulars of the room. When he showed me the brands of his new make-up, my eyebrows rose.
He doesn't need to tell anyone how he's addicted to Sherlock's hair. How thick and smooth it is when it swallows his fingers, and the way Sherlock melts in his arms when John's fingertips brush his scalp. The way Sherlock's breath becomes just loud enough for it to feel as if he breathes for them both.
He's not too unhappy with the way it starts off. A little soldier limps into his lab with a tired face and a well-contained quiet rage, and Sherlock quickly looks away. To his credit, he knows it immediately; this is important, so he needs to be careful. He needs to be fascinating and interesting; he needs to be mysterious and aloof. He asks Stamford for the phone he knows Mike isn't carrying, waiting with a hammering heart the few seconds it takes the little soldier to reach into his pocket and say:
Words come quietly. They flow between them like the exchange of body heat, of tactile sensation, of air to breathe, of sweat. They are as honest as the beat of their hearts against the other’s chest.
The cloud cover made the morning look like night. I thought I could see a light in the window of the Gothic tower. I thought I could see Duke Moriarty step into the dining hall and close the balcony doors behind him, a victorious sneer on his face.
“You could have hidden sooner! This was an important encounter that I now have had to cut short because-”
He looked at me in slight reproach. “Don't get all philosophical over this. The only practical consequence is that we need to be more careful than previously.”
He doesn't feel the need to explain to anyone how his nose seeks out Sherlock's skin during those still mornings in bed. Sherlock is so sleepy and lovely, and John doesn't know what to do with the fondness he feels for his friend. So he presses his nose against Sherlock's forehead or his cheek, he nuzzles it against Sherlock's, and when he does that, there's a faint smile on Sherlock's face. He looks so blissful that John needs to do it again, breathe him in, stroke his face gently with his nose.
to avoid a problem…” he says with a sorrowful voice. It takes John a second to realise he’s still talking about the socks, and then he can’t help his burst of giggles. Sherlock continues with a sincerity that almost breaks John’s heart: “It’s not fair. Life is not fair.”
His jaw was set and he stared at me so fiercely. His passion felt like a punch in the face and I could only nod.
Sherlock is the stormy London night personified. His coat is flaring out like a mantle, fusing with the darkness, and his hair is bounding as if in wild euphoria, messing up his styling but making him look irresistibly alive. His legs are criminally long, and it's a bloody good thing John happens to be a soldier and knows how to run.
When the moon next rises, it's time. My father has bought a bag of caramels for Harriet to put on her night-stand, and my mother has ironed my blue shirt. This is the night when all the boys come out and dance, twisting themselves like fantastical creatures to seem desirable.
At first, Sherlock is sceptical of this idea. There are not enough points of contact between them when sitting side by side, and he has to twist uncomfortably in order to kiss John. But when he gives up and lets himself slide down in his seat, and John follows him, he remembers with a fresh wave of warmth that John is a
“Come on, John!” Sherlock shouted over his shoulder. I was right behind him, cursing and panting. He didn't need to beckon me; he'd
Sherlock is dizzy with how fast everything has changed. John smiles and wishes him good morning the way he always does, but his eyes look different; darker. Sherlock can see his effort to keep his eyes on Sherlock’s face, but then his gaze slides down and takes Sherlock’s body in.
We sat at the piano on stage. The words and the notes had settled overnight, and it calmed my nerves a bit. But when the first actors arrived some time later, I was still so anxious that I couldn't sit down. I paced in front of the piano, staying furiously focused on what I needed to do.
When he went on and turned a corner, there were other people there. I hardly noticed them, unable to see anything besides Sherlock's fleeing back. They all noticed us, though; it was hard not to.
The implication poured like cold poison into my body, my heart pumping it out to spread further through my limbs. “What?”
I stroked his cheek lightly with the back of my forefinger. “Don't do this to yourself, Sherlock. Please.” I leaned forward and pressed my lips to his forehead. It tasted strongly of salt. “We can leave tonight”, I mumbled against his skin. “Please say you'll come with me.”
Here, Sherlock's sharp edges are gone. The concentrated focus in his cool eyes has fallen away. His eyelids flutter as he tries to hold on to his clarity, only to helplessly lose his grip again when John's hips lock him against the cushions. Behind the hard façade Sherlock is soft and welcoming, living and hot; John can feel him glowing through the crisp fabric of his shirt.
John almost groans at the feel of Sherlock's hot skin touching him from shoulder to belly, and the return of Sherlock's hard erection trapped between them. Sherlock kisses John's throat, and John holds on to Sherlock's hair, desperately clutching a familiar thing in the middle of this shocking intensity. Sherlock's mouth moves down over his chest, sending an electric spark to John's groin wherever he touches him. John presses his lips together tightly, trying not to make a sound when Sherlock pauses to lick his nipples.
“Oh, yes. Of course.” Holmes smiled again. I wished he would stop; it made him look terrifying. It got even worse when he turned to me. “John, why don't you do the honours?”
You are a marvel, John Watson. When I hold you in my arms, feel your breathing deepen and your pulse slow until you are asleep, when I inhale the scent of your hair and the cooling sweat on your skin, it dawns on me that I have waited for you my whole life. And the fact that you have waited in your turn touches me deeply.
He wades through the shallow water to reach my side, and I fight to ignore his nakedness. There's no reason I should look anywhere but his face. There's no reason I should want to.
He froze for a second, then turned. His eyes were wary, pleading with me not to say it. My jaw muscles hurt when they clenched.
His eyes were intent on my face when I stopped before him, uncertain. My left hand made a fist at my side and he saw it immediately, reaching out to carefully seal his hand over mine. His thumb swept over my knuckles, a soft touch that made my cramping muscles relax.
“Want me to prove it to you?” I said, even though I knew the whole act was just a way to make me read it out and pay him attention.
“Um, hi.” Christ, I had already forgotten how overwhelming it was to stand under the spotlight of those eyes. “I- I've been thinking. About what you said. You know, about the palace scene.”
Came to see him on Christmas Day. Really I wanted to spend Christmas Eve here too, but his parents were visiting and now is definitely not the time to meet them.
“I can't even write any more.” I tried to make it sound light, but couldn't bring myself to meet his eyes.
certainly don't know how to do it. But you… No matter how strange the things I do or say, you just take it in your stride. You never judge me for anything.”
When he was turning a piece of a nail over his Bunsen burner, the words came, and now I know what song it is, and that's hilarious.
He has that innocently indignant look on his face, the one that means he doesn't know he's said something sweet. John's smile goes soft when he leans down to kiss him.
”, Sherlock hisses above him, shoving his hips against the gate. John parts Sherlock's heavy coat, opens his fly and pulls him out. He pauses a moment to take in the sight of Sherlock Holmes, fully clothed in someone else's fancy garden, naked erection sticking out through two railings in the gate. His eyes are heavy-lidded and his lips parted, his damp curls shining in colours from the fireworks.
In the Moulin Rouge elephant, standing on all fours over Sherlock with his slim wrists in my hands, staring at him and willing him to listen to me, I sang. Quietly, simply, I placed words upon the notes.
When you stepped through the vestibule, you were stripped of the coldness of peripheral life. The red walls protected from the mundane and tragic, promising never-ending life and a rush like stirring blood.
I smiled awkwardly, again having forgotten he was there. Sherlock was blinking rapidly beside me, looking dazed, almost confused.
He has to say something. Sherlock doesn't know what he's doing right now. It's probably an experiment, and as with other experiments, it's John who has to tell him when he's taken on something too dangerous.
in his mind pulses through his body, and he stays. He feels more stupidly reckless than when he runs with Sherlock after murderers at night – when he feels deep in his gut that he needs to stay close to this man at any cost. Wherever Sherlock wants him to be, in whatever way Sherlock allows him to be.
“Yes, of course”, Moriarty drawled. “The Dancer wants to rise from the underworld; he wants money, fame, a lifetime of security. Yet he throws his only chance away for this tragic Sitar-Player. It's a fairy-tale. It's boring. In reality, power wins.” Moriarty gave one of his manic smiles, and I frowned in disgust. “Once the Sitar-Player is done with the Dancer, she will leave him with nothing. The Maharajah, meanwhile, can fulfil every single wish the Dancer's ever had. It has to be changed, Holmes. The Dancer chooses the Maharajah in the end.”
“Well.” John tilts his head back a bit, watching his own hand arrange Sherlock's fringe. “It was only the first. Sometimes you're nervous and your head gets in the way. You need to get used to the other person. Process it so you can relax and enjoy it next time.”
I suddenly remembered that we were standing right next to the opening of the elephant, within earshot of anyone standing below. I kissed him to muffle his next sound when I moved my thumb in circles.
Now that I did have the time, I bought a typewriter, sacrificing the quality of my food that month. But the words that once came so easily now seemed lost. I couldn't bring myself to write about the war, and nothing else was real enough to be worth mentioning.
Now that they know they will soon part, and therefore know that things will not get out of hand, John is suddenly much bolder. Sherlock’s arousal escalates so quickly that he loses all coordination. He whimpers helplessly into John’s open mouth. The hand stroking his side slides further down, almost grazing his backside. It is enough to make Sherlock’s lips fall away from John’s as his head tips backwards to release a strained breath to the ceiling. John takes the opportunity to kiss his throat, and this time Sherlock actually does stumble.
They fall silent. Sherlock slowly raises his hands, lets the palms meet before his chest, then brings them lightly to his chin.
“I wasn’t very careful. Not in my selection of partners, and not in my practices. This in combination with cocaine was not very constructive.”
“Imagine”, he murmurs, “you and I, coming home after a case. A really good one. I’ve used my gun, and you’ve been absolutely brilliant. I’ve been looking at you all day, how sexy you are with your coat collar and your cheekbones… Mrs Hudson is out, and we know she won’t get back until late.”
She is not impressed by this. Just when she is about to start screaming, an impulse prompts me to start waltzing with her. I hold her upright against my chest the way I did last time, humming the first waltz that comes to mind.
Beside it, there was a new photo. Never underestimate the sneakiness of Mrs Hudson – I had no idea she had taken this picture, I don't even know when she did it. She must have sneaked into 221B at some point and found us like that. And then she thought it appropriate to frame it on her mantelpiece for everyone to see. Sherlock will be mortified.
Thank you for reading, and thanks to those of you who have told me stories of your own encounters with the Swedish folk music and dance! I'm thrilled to hear all about it. And for those who didn't know anything at all about it before reading, thanks for keeping an open mind and letting me show you something new! You're all so lovely.
A great gust of breath punches out of John's lungs. He folds forward into his hands as if unable to keep himself upright any longer.
John finishes by washing Sherlock's face with a cloth as best he can. Sherlock's eyes are closed and his hand is firmly grasping John's knee, warming up the wet fabric. John strokes Sherlock's still damp hair away to see his ear, angling Sherlock's head this way and that.
He pulled back, fingers going to his coat buttons. He held my gaze when he parted the heavy fabric, revealing the off-white oversized shirt he wore underneath. I felt my eyes widen; it was the shirt he had borrowed from me that first morning. He wore it without trousers underneath, the hem reaching below his pelvis. The boots ended almost halfway up his thighs, leaving a stretch of smooth skin bare on top of his legs.
It takes Sherlock far too long to realise that there is dawn-light against his eyelids. That he has the distinct taste of morning breath in his closed mouth. And that John's breathing pattern has changed.
“It's Mycroft.” The name was like a slap. He knew it would be, but he ignored it, repeated it. “Mycroft is my brother.”
, and the sensation was so overwhelming I couldn't feel anything other than that. Sherlock is alive. And the pain cut through all the sorrow, all the fury, and all the gratitude for that, until everything lost meaning except his presence in me.
“Finish your food”, he reminds Sherlock after a while, “so we can go to bed before we pass out on the couch. I'm knackered.”
I think on it for a moment. “I guess not.” He sighs softly, settling into the pillow. “I don't have any caramels for you, though”, I add.
Sherlock silently shook his head, trying to speak but only managing sharp, panting breaths. Moriarty shook his head back at him.
Any second now, John will turn his head, catch sight of Sherlock and smile. Because in spite of all the terrible things that Sherlock has done, he somehow did find a way to keep John forever.
He was springing like gravity is something that doesn't concern him, he was twirling like he was at the centre of the world and everything was forced to a stop around him. Every movement of his wrists seemed deliberate, every sensual stretch of his neck. My light grey shirt was darker from sweat down his spine, and the beginning of his scars were visible by the stretched neckline. His curls were a damp mess and he was breathing hard, must have been dancing for a long time.
Sherlock's chest is firm and solid against John's. It's like an anchor, a rock, a safe weight that pushes against John's lungs. Allows him to take deep breaths without his chest exploding.
I led him out of the hall. When we ran into a frightened servant I barked at him to give us his coat. I carefully wrapped it around Sherlock's shaking shoulders and held my arm protectively around his back, all the way home. He kept his head down as we walked, tears still silently streaming down his face.
“Don’t feel that you have to say anything”, John rushes to say. “It doesn’t have to mean anything. I’m glad I told you, though, because I don’t want you ever to believe I think you’re ugly. It makes me sad that you thought that.”
The beginning doesn't seem like the beginning, and this ending is not the end. Sherlock and I are a golden thread running through the weave of time, and our story slots into a much larger one, one too great for us to see. When I close my eyes and go back to the stage, to singing
The pressure in his lungs forces Sherlock to break away for a gasp of air. Their lips part with an exaggerated kissing sound. Once more he forgets to feel embarrassed when John's soft nose nuzzles across his cheek and into the curls above Sherlock's ear.
I was saved by the door flying open once more. Holmes slid into the room with a tight smile and a hard grip on the handle of his folded umbrella.
“I did see something…”, he started after a while. “There was something different. Something didn't quite add up.”
John thinks fondly of the miserable man with the cane, he remembers how naive he was, and he thinks about how wonderful the fifty-one years with Sherlock have been.
“You need to try harder”, John teases, and then they are running around the table, skidding on the floor, trying to trick each other by changing directions. Sherlock gropes for him across the table but John jumps out of his reach. When Sherlock nearly gets him, John runs into the living room, back into the kitchen, another turn to the living room and then down the hall. At the threshold of the bedroom, Sherlock finally grasps John's waist and they stumble across the floor, landing on the bed. John giggles hysterically while he squirms to get out of Sherlock's hold, but Sherlock has the advantage since he landed on top.
Sherlock finally meets his eyes. “It's for science”, he says with the same voice that he uses with Anderson.
I drew back a fraction to look into his eyes. They were unreadable in the dark. I tried to think of something to say, but everything seemed either too grand or too insignificant.
It was remarkably easy to move through the scene together. We each knew, after just those few lines, that we could trust the other. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Stamford lean back in his chair. I expected him to interrupt us at some point, to tell us how to move during our dialogue, but he kept silent. I took a step closer to Sherlock and continued:
The rosin dust wedged between the fibres of the victim's Persian rug. The blood-stained violin case. The scent of varnished wood. It all stands out to him like black letters on a white sheet.
“We get inside the door. We’re still high on adrenalin, and your hair is all tousled by the wind. You start taking off your coat, but I can’t wait any longer. I grab your collar and pull you into a kiss. You’re getting hot inside your coat and you take it off while you’re kissing me. I press you against the wall. You can feel me against you, how I’m getting hard.”
It shouldn't matter for a man who was about to die anyway, he told himself. It shouldn't make a difference whether the first thing to die was the only part of himself that felt alive. One thing stood above all, and that was to save the life of John Watson.
He sauntered into the room, hips swaying excessively, pursing his lips to draw attention to the stark red of his lipstick. I couldn't for the life of me understand why he would dress like that for my audition, but I kept my eyes steadily on his face.
“Moriarty holds the deeds to the Moulin Rouge. He has exclusive right to your sexual services. He's spending a fortune on you, he wants to make you a star. Here's your one chance at becoming someone, and all you have to do is court this duke.”
Yeah. As far as I understand, you did this to protect Mrs Hudson, Lestrade and me. So we wouldn't get killed.
I cleared my throat and looked down. I was unprepared for the sting. I didn't want to lose the memory of the magic in our dance, but it was too late – Sherlock had already said it, and the high I had been riding from that moment was gone.
“You might become less tolerant of me putting the Work first. You might want things from me when I am busy.”
, and the way his mouth shapes around it. There is a slight pause, and when they look at each other, the memory of two sets of windows with bullet holes hovers between them.
John turns away to fill the tea balls. “You could have just said 'no', you know. Just. Sometimes. Leave it alone.”
His forehead tasted like salt when I kissed it. His mouth tasted like cold air. He didn't move for a long time, and just when I thought he was too tired to speak, he said it again:
. He sucks in air, his mouth falls open, he lets out a rough sound that's almost a moan, and when he whispers John's name, his voice rasps. “Oh, John… Stuck, he was
, a woman says, and I feel inexplicably proud. I also feel a bit guilty; surely John wishes he were the one who held her right now so he could show her off properly.
I glanced at the paper in his hand. “It's yours. The one you composed at university.” I hummed the chorus, and he slowly grinned.
“I want all of that”, I murmur into the fabric of his shirt. “The lake. The necklaces. The forget-me-nots. You'll really write me a wedding waltz?” The idea of hearing a tune William's composed is wonderful.
His eyes were wild, pupils huge, and it sent a surge of pleasure through me. He couldn't lie still, his pelvis shifting against me, his head lolling back and forth on the pillow, fingers clenching in my flesh.
But William takes it one step further. His analysis is razor-sharp when he speaks of the precise way his choices in dynamics, phrasing and beat affect the dance floor. I gradually come to see that in his mind, there is a great map with thousands of possible ways it could go. He's ready to follow one of those paths at any time, knowing precisely what the effects will be given what he sees on the floor.
“I see.” Holmes' lip twisted in disgust. “An ongoing affair. Oh Sherlock, it's the first rule; don't get involved. And yet, even you lose your head over an infatuation like all the other brainless-”
Holmes stared into Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock stared back, an eyebrow twitching. Holmes tipped his head back a fraction, Sherlock rolled his eyes, and Holmes' mouth twisted to the side. I had no way of guessing what they communicated to each other through this, but it was unsettling. I wondered how long they'd had this silent understanding, and why they had needed to develop it.
He stared at me for a second longer before pacing away again, not dropping the knife as I'd told him to.
His hand dropped from his lips to turn the page, and I caught a small smile on his face. It was a private one, making him look softer around the edges. He looked divine, as if lit up by a secret sun in the dim alcove. Flawless and impossible to reach.
The inn was cosy and he'd booked us a room with a double bed – of course he had, we always sleep in the same bed, but still. When we'd turned out the lights we talked about the case, or rather, we giggled over it. Really, it's the most hilariously silly thing we've done yet, but that's a story for the public blog, I think. Think it's time to start it back up.
I pursed my lips in an attempt to hide my smile, because really, that was words from the man they'd trusted to write their play? “It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, no.”
The woman goes on to ask John about her sleeping patterns. Stamford steps in closer to me, bending to get a better look at her face.
The sixth year, John is scared all the fucking time. He resents the woman he calls his wife – he is not sure she technically is, since she did not marry him in her real name. He doesn't sleep for fear of what she might do. He watches her belly grow and is worried sick over this perilous housing for his unborn daughter. He asks the love of his life for help even though it makes him hate himself, because Sherlock has already paid the biggest toll from John's disastrous marriage; he was the one who got his heart pierced by John's wife, and then she shot him.
Perhaps we could be friends. I wanted to be. He was strangely charming in all his brusque honesty, and he was hilarious. No one else seemed to get it, but he had begun to notice that
I let myself get lost in a slow exploration of his hair, his cheeks and jaw, his neck and his chest, not caring about my trousers getting uncomfortable again. He gradually became less careful about the sounds he let loose, humming when I softly sucked on his bottom lip, sighing when I scraped my nails through his hair.
The stairs were endless, leading nowhere. I ran through empty hallways, looking for the entrance to the tower. The minutes ticked away, wasted and useless and hurting my Sherlock.
I stood at the window in my flat, waiting. The red lights on the windmill had just gone out, the turning blades groaning audibly in the still morning. My suitcase was packed and ready, waiting on top of my neatly-made bed.
They reach the end of the tune. The last tone rings out and it sounds like a laugh. For one dazzling moment, the young boy smiles at Soling Jacob, for the first time seeming at all moved by the magic that just took place on his strings. I blink and it's gone, his face once more composed. He barely acknowledges the applause before he throws himself into the next tune, eyes intent on Soling Jacob.
His face is remarkable. So alive, so sensual, so lost to pleasure. He tried to hold my gaze when I slid my fingers in, but his eyes screwed shut, his lips pressed together hard. He rolled his head on the pillow, his hair damp with sweat. He clutched my back, irrationally urging me forward, accidentally begging me again.
He texts her as soon as he's in a cab to the Yard. Her flirty reply tells him there's no lasting damage done.
“You didn't even use a condom?” John's voice reflects an anger he's too numb to feel. He regrets it when she breaks out into a fresh crying fit and answers something indiscernible.
I glanced down at the long, bare, masculine arms holding me, leading me in a slow dance on the spot. I couldn't keep my eyes from closing. His fingertips nestled their way into my shirt between the buttons, touching bare skin. A moan leaked into my breath. In answer, there was a deep, gravelly hum just behind my ear.
The only guests who have yet arrived are Sherlock and John; the celebration is tomorrow. They have been assigned the tedious task of peeling a large bowl of potatoes for the potato salad. Sherlock huffs and glowers, and John smiles.
“All finished”, Martha said with a last tug on the unforgiving knot of his corset. “Should I fetch you the outfit?”
The Afghanistan sand is mirrored on the soldier's skin, and the horrors of the war are painted on his worn, bloody uniform. The blood is not his own, although the wear is. He moves around the tent, tending to gruesome injuries with efficient competence. He moves as though he's got all the time in the world, as if he
I will not beg you to come back, for I only want you to come if it is your wish to do so. Nevertheless, I want you to know that should you decide to work with me again, I will be more careful. I will not leave you behind, John, and it was never my conscious wish to do so. You might say this means nothing, and I can only answer that I now understand even more clearly the meaning this has for you, and that I care deeply about your well-being.
"Once again, Watson, you have unerringly put your finger on the important point. What reason indeed?"
"I leave that to the Irregulars. Miss Gibson and Miss Madeley are taking their evening constitutional. There, see? I need only give the signal to let them know which pocket it is in. But we must keep out of sight!"
They would have us believe that the universe is cold and uncaring; that our minds are ill equipped to comprehend it and the attempt would drive us mad. But I am a man of science, and will be one until my dying day. I must trust that knowledge is always better than ignorance, light better than darkness, and that the universe has furnished us with a solution.
We turned towards home arm in arm, and when we reached the edge of the refuge that shelters us, I took his hand.
"And our Russian friends would be very glad to try it, with our help. An excellent idea, Watson. Perhaps it is time for the Strand Players to go touring again, hmm? That will give us an opportunity to observe them. And to plan."
Holmes indicated the chop house. "Our guard once again takes supper before his evening duties. I'll wager he'll have a tiring time this evening."
One may see many strange things in the rookery of St Giles, that den of vice where even the police fear to tread. Women walking about in men's clothing, riotous dancing in the streets, gin shops open until the early hours. If one is observant, one may even see two men holding hands as their tired feet take them home, or sharing a quiet kiss.
. We had never come across any such thing. None with the blood of Gloriana needed to eat, but they ate and drank and it seemed to have no effect on them. In 1873 some poor unfortunate had thrown sulphuric acid at the Prince of Wales, and he had brushed it off like water.
He pulled me along the corridor and in through one of the unlocked doors to a room containing two small desks. Holmes lit the lamp on each desk and hung his coat from the peg. I did likewise and we sat, pulling out papers onto the desk and generally trying to make it look as though we had been hard at work.
We heard Lestrade go back down the stairs and speak to the commissionaire for a moment, and then he went out into the street. As soon as he was gone Holmes threw on his coat. "Come, Watson!"
The commissionaire did not stir from his lodge. The guard stood twice more and tugged at the bell with increasing agitation, before crossing the room towards the door.
"Well said! Well said, my boy." His pacing brought him back towards me and he pressed a hard kiss to my mouth before spinning towards the fireplace. "They are not gods. And everything has a weakness. Well, come along, Watson. No use taking off your coat. We must investigate at once."
Miss Gibson inclined her head to me. "As I'm sure you've been informed, Dr Watson, we've been following Professor Moriarty."
"Yes, yes." Holmes took off his jacket and waistcoat and hung them over a chair, then lay down in bed in his shirt. I lay down with him, my arms around him, stroking his back slowly. Gradually his breathing slowed and his muscles relaxed.
Holmes has arranged for the Strand Players to tour the Continent. Soon they will be performing my little play before all the crowned heads of Europe; by March we will be in St Petersburg. And then we shall see. Perhaps we will live to see humanity free once more.
I thought of the great bulk that squatted in the Palace, 700 years old and never the slightest sign of change. And watching us, always watching. "Will it affect her?"
For my part I was very glad to quit that room forever. We went out by the side door, as we had come in, and saw Lestrade walking ahead of us. We followed him at a discreet distance, keeping to the shadows.
"Knowing Moriarty, it will not be easy to break. However, we may not need to. Observe. He is a neat fellow, is he not?"
"Hmm." Lestrade nodded. "Well, none of the others heard anything either. They must have got out the window somehow. Thank you for your time, gentlemen."
"Very little," Holmes sighed. "It would take me days to crack the code. There was a symbol often repeated—a capital F, and then a nine—but there are any number of possible meanings. F is the sixth letter of the alphabet...could six become nine? Then F would become I. But I am certain it was not a substitution cipher, and that would be far too simple for a man of Moriarty's intelligence…"
"The changing of the guard," Holmes said. "Dressed like clerks, do you see? But I fancy these are ordinary security men, not some elite club. They are careless. They do not look about them. Let us go inside."
The commissionaire ran a finger down his ledger. "I'm sorry, gentlemen, there's no Hatton Insurance listed here."
My blood ran cold. I seemed to feel the vial in Holmes' pocket as though it had its own gravity. "Of course," I said quickly, moving forward. The only chance now was for me to distract Lestrade while Holmes disposed of it. I did not dare look at him, but I knew that he would use whatever opportunity I could give him. "We have no objections, Inspector. Please."
From the corridor came the sound of feet moving purposefully about, and voices raised in anger. The guard was calling down to the commissionaire to telephone for the police.
Holmes stepped back out of the way, brushing lightly against Lestrade in the small room. Lestrade pulled open my coat and searched my pockets, then patted me down along my arms and legs. Throughout it all, Holmes stood calmly in Lestrade's line of sight, not moving.
"Holmes, we must get rid of the vial," I said. "It is the only thing that can incriminate us. Throw it out of the window."
"There is a side door in that alley." Holmes pointed to the side of the building just as a servant came out. "The passage then leads up to a landing on the main staircase."
Holmes strode purposefully through the door as though he came into the building every day. The commissionaire made no move to stop us, and we climbed the stairs unchallenged. At the top were two corridors stretching off to left and right, and a row of glossy black doors with small brass plaques. Some of the ordinary clerks must also have been working late, for lights glowed under three or four.
Holmes stared at me in absolute silence for perhaps three seconds, then he leapt from his chair and seized me around the waist. "Fluorine!" he cried. "Watson, let it be known that your genius is unsurpassed in the country. In the entire world. Fluorine! Can it—yes, it might be." He rushed to his chemical kit and started haphazardly pulling out bottles.
A few minutes later there was a knock at the door, and Holmes opened it to reveal a sallow rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow, no more than five feet four, who glared at the two of us as though we were condemned criminals.
The next evening I returned to the street at the appointed time. Holmes had vanished after breakfast with instructions to disguise myself as I might and leave my revolver at home, and I had not seen him for the rest of the day. But now as I stood waiting an elderly man emerged from the chop house, and limped towards me with his head bent.
But they do claim to be human; at least in part. Prince Albert is an ordinary man, and the Queen's children are half-bloods. So it is too with the Unspeakable Kaiser, the Czar Unanswerable, and all those who preside over the Old World; their consorts are human. Perhaps they are not capable of breeding with each other. I do not know. Until that day our our victims had all been more than half human, and it took a sharp knife and a strong arm to dispatch them. How we would deal with the princes and princesses, we did not know. Still less what manner of weapon could possibly be used against the Queen, as she spread her great bulk through all the rooms of the palace and squatted there.
'The Irregulars', he called them, and indeed the name was fitting. Many evil things dwell in the sewers of this city, and it only needs an unwary step to be caught in their trap. I have seen children scarred beyond all recognition, missing limbs, withered hands, a shaking like palsy. People did not like to look at them in the street, and so they passed by almost invisible. A useful talent for a spy. They paid dear for it.
"Can you credit it, Watson?" he cried. "A poison? Something that might rid us of these foul creatures once and for all. Is it possible?"
Moriarty's leather-bound notebooks were stacked in one corner of the room. My heart sank as I opened the top one to see page after page of nonsense. "A cipher," I said.
A man had emerged from a chop house further up the street and was hurrying towards the building. He vanished inside and a few minutes later appeared again in the lighted window above. The other man spoke to him briefly, they shook hands, and then the second man made for the door. A minute later he came out and stomped away up the street.
"Oh, but you'll never guess what we overheard!" cried Miss Madeley, the youngest and most exuberant of the Irregulars. Her companion tried to hush her, but she was bursting with the news. "Professor Moriarty has a secret laboratory!"
Holmes said nothing more until we had stepped out into the chilly night. He pulled his collar up against the wind and glanced back at the silhouette still at the window. "At least now we have got a look at the lodge. Did you notice the bells? The wires go into the far wall, and no doubt come out in that cupboard next to the stairs. Very instructive. Well, doctor, I suppose you'll have no objection in joining me for an evening stroll tomorrow?"
"The Czar Unanswerable," I said. "He is the smallest. And he goes about in St Petersburg, instead of sitting in the palace."
"Yes, a few minutes ago we heard loud footsteps coming up the stairs, and then the man in the room at the end of the corridor calling for the police."
"There is a dinner in honour of the Prince of Wales next month," Holmes said with a yawn. "That will be the moment to test our theory. His wine. He loves to drink, and gamble, and whore with the serving girls. He will be undefended."
"And lose our only hope of final victory? Besides, it would be clear at once where it had come from." Holmes cocked his head to one side, listening. "Ah, the police are here already. I fancy Professor Moriarty had his old friend the Inspector waiting nearby in case something should happen. But do not fear, Watson. Lestrade lacks imagination. That is his downfall."
I had spent the afternoon making house calls, doing what little my medical training could for the poor wretches of the Rookery. I returned to the cramped rooms I shared with Holmes to find him entertaining two of his agents.
Satisfied, Lestrade moved on to Holmes. Wishing with all my heart that I had brought my revolver, I moved casually around the table, ready to spring before he could call out. I wished I had brought my revolver. But Lestrade's hand came out empty.
No matter where we have lived—in poky little garrets, damp and dingy boarding rooms—Holmes has never been without his chemical instruments. He pulled them out now, and we rolled up our sleeves. Holmes tipped a little of the substance out onto a glass dish, and examined it carefully. He rubbed it between his fingers and sniffed it. Then he fell back in his chair and began to laugh.
"Not so much as that. That would only arouse suspicion. But I suspect many requests for coffee to come to the commissionnaire's lodge tonight."
One by one the clerks left until only a handful of lights were visible. Holmes indicated a window, high up on the third floor, where a lamp still burned. Every so often the shape of a man crossed in front of the window, silhouetted in the light.
Holmes pulled me into a doorway, where, craning my neck, I saw the two Irregulars, arm in arm, greeting Inspector Lestrade. To his credit he looked them in the eye and bowed courteously, and in response to some comment from Miss Gibson he pulled out his watch. While he was distracted, Miss Madeley slipped a light hand in his pocket, and withdrew it before he could see. He said something to them, pleasantries were exchanged, and they moved away.
As I looked around the room, the flow of Moriarty's work became clear. His bench was set up along one wall. On the right were cupboard containing the results of his experiments, each numbered to correspond to his notes. On the left, the cupboards all contained rows of the same dark substance, tiny flakes of black shimmering in their tubes. This must be the subject of his experiments.
So it was that after Holmes locked the doors of our little garret and I lit a candle, we climbed into bed together. I drew him close, taking comfort from the steady thrum of his heartbeat against mine, his presence a certain charm against the horrors of the dark. The rules don't seem so important any more.
It was more of a possibility than we had ever had before. I grasped at it with all the hope I could muster.
Miss Gibson and Miss Madeley were two of the most formidable of Holmes' little army. They were taking tea on our tiny sofa, looking for all the world like two elegant ladies paying calls.
"Miss Gibson, Miss Madeley," Holmes bowed to them, "you have performed admirably." He handed out shillings with a liberal hand. "Will you take some more tea? And perhaps a slice of cake?"
I will never forget lying beneath the stars on the eve of the Battle of Maiwand, while all around me came a ceaseless buzzing, as of a million flies, and somewhere in the darkness beyond our fires great shapes loomed, shuffling back and forth with a strange gait. For the first time in my life I feared the daylight, and what I might see by it.
After a thorough examination of us both, he stepped back. "Did you hear anything unusual this evening?"
I almost leapt out of my skin as a sound like all the church bells in London came suddenly from above us. We looked up to see a tiny, almost invisible thread stretching from the cupboard across the ceiling, and on the end, half-concealed by the light, a series of bells. A trap.
"Who knows? She is not half-human as the rest are. But if the results are good—yes, I think so. But it would need considerably more than we could get in a glass of wine."
I was too familiar with my friend's disguises to feel much alarm. Indeed, as he settled beside me in the lee of the doorway he wore a slight frown. "I believe my tricks begin to seem commonplace in your eyes, Watson."
Holmes smiled. "I rather think I want the thrill of doing that myself. And if it works, then we will look to the Queen."
I sat heavily in my chair, and together we regarded the useless object lying on the table. "Was it all a trick?" I asked. "Could you glean anything from Moriarty's notes?"
Our target was at the end of the row on the right, facing the street where we had been standing. Holmes moved quietly to the end of the row and looked at the plaque. "Hah!" he muttered softly. "'Worth's Chemical Mixtures'. Hah!"
There was a time when I would no more have considered kissing a man than plunging a dagger into Her Majesty's heart. But I am a different man now. Once you see through one lie, you see through them all. And Holmes has always had a gift for making the most impenetrable mysteries seem absurdly simple.
"They are not gods," I reasoned. "We must assume, therefore, that they are mortal. Whatever is born can always die."
I remembered Holmes' interest in the bells from the previous night. "His requests will go unanswered."
I do find Täpp Lisa pretty and sweet. It's just that I no longer want to lie in bed with someone I'm not dying to talk to. I don't want to struggle all night to light a spark I'm not sure will ever appear. I might have settled for that before; but that was before I knew. That was when I thought that the idea of laughing with someone until you can't breathe, of clinging to their every word in awe, of feeling so calm with them that you don't have to speak to
“He claims he focuses better when he doesn't have to 'digest'”, Irene said, mockingly quoting him. When I opened my mouth, she cut me off: “Don't waste your time trying to understand him, John.”
John keeps moving his thumb, not willing to move away from the heat increasing lower down Sherlock's pants.
He walked out of the doors and over the courtyard with confident steps. The coat swirled dramatically around his ankles. He walked like the god he was, owning every place on earth and every heart in Paris, not caring if he crushed them under the hard soles of his shoes.
Sherlock opens his eyes to the empty Baker Street living room. This could never happen if Mike were still there. John would not kiss him, and Sherlock wouldn't deliver those deductions in the first place; the experience of being involuntarily outed is not something he wishes upon someone else.
“Yeah”, I sighed as I gathered him into my arms. “Of course, yeah.” He did that thing where he fitted himself into the crook of my neck, though his height should have made it impossible. All the tension drained out of me when I felt his body against mine again. “Come what may”, I whispered.
I am reminded of the last time we spoke like this; soft words and honest voices. It was five months ago, the night I was released from hospital after Morstan shot me in the chest. I opened the door to 221B to find John on the sofa, watching telly in his pyjamas.
There was a big hole in my ribcage when I turned away. It let the cold wind in to storm around my heart as I released him.
The flat was silent. Sherlock's arms were heavy on my back. The sweat made our skin stick together, and his semen was drying between us. I disentangled myself from his arms, and he readily let me go. His eyes were closed. I left him on the bed and went to clean up and get dressed.
His eyes were fixed on mine as if a magnetic field locked our pupils together. His were wide, black holes for me to tumble into. A string of something more burning than electricity connected us, a band of gold between our eyes more palpable than anything else in the room.
But the clapping from the audience slowly dies while William dances. He doesn't interact with them, doesn't flirt with them, and so he loses them. Even the most advanced moves don't provoke a reaction from the crowd.
It's so typical; Sherlock's libido always spikes after a case. Mostly John tries to see to it that they make it home before he's cornered by a tall, dark, seductive man in a dramatic coat; but he supposes that the tone for this relationship was set at that very first encounter in a client's guest room two years ago. Sherlock has no self-control in his post-case satisfaction. And John is helpless before the Sherlock who lets his mind go and craves John the way he does right now.
The orchestra was playing as one man, flawless and sincere. Music beat the air into waves, pumping through the arteries and veins, the hidden spaces and secret gateways around the theatre hall. The floor beneath my feet vibrated when I sneaked into the building, choosing the unknown pathways Sherlock had shown me. I made it to the far end of the building without being seen.
And, yes. It hurt. Like I've imagined it would. Felt like I was being cut in half for a while. Just like I wanted it to. Because it's one thing to see him, it's one thing to hear his voice. But this, I could
All John can hear is his own breathing, loud even in the storm. Sherlock grabs the back of his head, pulling him against his shoulder. John breathes in the damp wool of Sherlock's coat, the taste of rain filling his mouth. With his own breathing muffled, he can hear the footsteps of the killer. He feels Sherlock bend his neck, and then his face presses against John's crown, hot breath warming his scalp.
Later, when that day had come to an end, when I hurried into my building and threw myself onto my bed with hands already on my fly, I would be certain that my life had just changed forever. But now, looking at it in the large shapes that hindsight creates, I see that it was entirely unavoidable. My life changed the moment my eyes met Sherlock's for the first time, and everything that happened after was as inevitable as dawn and dusk.
Why. Why are you doing this? Why do you show up after three bloody years and tell me these things? Do you think this is going to make anything easier for me somehow?
Stupidly, I hadn't counted on him remembering my name. Hearing him say it, as if he had already called my name a thousand times, made something slowly unfold in my gut. “No, I- I actually do.”
Sherlock's face was smooth for the moment, the fever wiping all his sharp edges away. He already looked oblivious, beyond knowing or caring about the sorrow of those he was about to leave behind.
?” Sherlock says in horror. Before anyone can speak, Sherlock snatches John's hand into his own, and says in a tone not open for discussion: “I
I can see him fighting not to ask an obvious question about why I'm here, or drop a stupid comment on how the sixth of August is not a night-wooing day. He frowns at me, trying to guess what's going on. I'm pretty sure he won't be able to deduce it.
I wouldn't be able to say how long we stood there. Wouldn't be able to tell you which shaking breaths were his and which were mine. Eventually we breathed in time with each other, and I wasn't cold any more, wrapped up in him. Strange how something that seemed impossible to do for months – holding him – now was the only possible thing to do. I nestled my face inside his coat collar, and the warm smell of Sherlock felt like a cure.
He was on his back. His hair was falling back from his forehead. His eyelids were smooth. His cheekbones were even sharper in the darkness. His lips were slightly parted. His breathing was deep and peaceful. His duvet had slid down a bit and he was wearing his light grey pyjamas, wrinkled by his collarbones.
I open my mouth to sing the waltz a bit louder, and all of a sudden I know which song it is. I have not thought of it for many years, but it is very dear to me; it always seems to inspire a sense of contentment deep in me. I remember now why that is, through a conversation I once had with Father. He was listening to a record featuring this song and he told me that he'd had this album since I was a baby. Apparently he used to hold me in his arms and dance to it at night when I didn't want to sleep.
“Apparently.” John scoops up honey with a spoon and puts it in a teacup. The fabric of his t-shirt moves over his chest, revealing the contours of his pectorals. “Question is, do we continue?”
But everything only sounds stupid; William would scoff at me, for sure. He never answers something he thinks is too obvious. And although I can't say it's very obvious to me, part of me knows that really, it is.
After a while he hears Sherlock get up from the couch and pad over to where John is standing. He presses his chest toJohn’s back and winds his arms around his waist. John sighs contentedly to the feel of Sherlock’s large hands resting on his belly and chest. Sherlock nuzzles his cheek against John’s hair, and John turns his head for another kiss.
What a stupid waste of time. It wouldn't even happen that way. John would never get carried away like that on a crime scene. If Sherlock is going to interrupt his work with this fantasy nonsense, it should at least be
John's hands stroke steadily up and down the sides of his torso, and Sherlock realises that he is trembling. He focuses on breathing, and when the trembling subsides John lifts his head.
Sherlock joins in his laugh. He laughs until John kisses him again. It truly is remarkably good; as if they have done thisevery day they have shared.
“Then, I suppose…” Moriarty drawled. “I will see you at the dress rehearsal, Holmes.” He didn't blink, and it made him look inhuman. “Send my love to my Virgin.”
“Holm William, this summer has been the best of my life. You are the most amazing person I've ever met, and I just…” I try another swallow. “I just can't imagine being with anyone other than you. For the rest of my life.”
“Fine, if you're going to be like that, let me give you a little extra incentive.” Sherlock frowned. Moriarty's eyes were shining, and he savoured the last moments of being the only one who knew. Then he lowered his voice as if delivering the most delicious punchline. “If you don't do my ending and come to me when the curtain falls, your little friend will die.”
The air rattles with fireworks when Sherlock leans in towards a gap between two iron bars. John tilts his head to the right and goes up on his tiptoes to fit his lips against Sherlock's.
It feels strange. The entire capacity of Sherlock's mind is occupied trying to catalogue the sensations and his heart keeps hammering nervously. A pair of lips touching his, and it feels like… well, exactly like a pair of lips against his lips. It's new and somewhat confusing; he had, perhaps irrationally, expected something else. When John withdraws, Sherlock leans in again to see if it feels different this time, but no. Still clumsy, and with a whiff of morning breath.
He never sleeps nowadays. John knows this, and he worries about it, but he doesn't say anything the way he did before. That would entail using the word
He awkwardly folds his hands in front of him just to have something to do with them. (And maybe a little to conceal his trouser front –
Something about this realisation lodges a lump in my throat. I raise my gaze to the mirror and turn so that her face is reflected. Her eyes are glittering in the half-light from the red lamp in the corner, her gaze astonished and infinitely curious. My arms are wrapped protectively around her body which is still small enough to almost disappear beneath my large hands. I look up into my own face and find a jubilant smile there.
The violin. Worn-off varnish on the left side of the neck. Missing E-string. Loose sound post. Chipped scroll. He assigns notes to the data, putting them into order with a staccato.
Moriarty was staring unwavering at me. His face seemed to hold nothing but those dark eyes, like black holes consuming every light in the room. It was the first time we looked at each other and each really knew the other. Until he saw me there, he had gravely miscalculated my strength. And though I'd had a premonition about his, I never actually guessed that the allure of his power and assets would be enough to make Sherlock choose him in the end.
Greg had not been happy to be pulled from a New Year's party half an hour before midnight, especially since he worked last New Year's too. But he grudgingly agreed to come and take the thief off John's hands. He also offered John and Sherlock a ride, but Sherlock would never agree to ride in a police car. John had no desire to cap this night off with
, but I'm smiling and it feels suspiciously much like my eyes might be glittering, and he turned his head away to hide a smile and suppress a snort.
‘Right, er, thanks for telling me, then. So, what now? Does this mean you’re finally having that dinner with Irene?’
‘When you’re alone, in your room, like this?’ She curled her hand over mine as I caressed her, following my motions.
‘Yeah. So are yours, genius,’ I laughed softly, and brought my hands up to cup her face between them.
which I could not be arsed to parse in full). I wasn’t about to go for the whole exploratory tour that Sherlock had done, it was too late in the game, for starters, but I thought I would give a try to whatever she had done that had put me over the edge, and ended up sort of making love to her with my mouth, because I adored her, and I was drunk on the plush, slipping, fullness of her skin against my tongue, and transfixed by the enraptured sounds that hissed across her lips every time I touched her, like a rhythmic prayer.
‘You did save her life,’ he needled, foregoing the temptation to bring up the angst-filled violin compositions as well.
As if there would be anyone else. Have I taught you nothing? Inexplicably, I feel my mouth twitch at the thought. The muscles feel stiff with lack of use.
Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment. It was getting easier, but never easy. It would never be easy. He put his hand on his friend’s shoulder, looked down into the old man’s face that looked back at him so trustingly.
‘Dating.’ In a single, swift movement, she righted herself, ‘You arrange to meet someone. You expend a significant amount of time worrying that they might turn out to be a serial killer. You spend an extra half hour minimum worrying about your appearance. You wear clothing you are not comfortable in to give an impression that you are more put-together and "feminine" than you actually are. And then-’
She had sat back a bit and was, again, looking at me with calculated fascination. She pushed my legs apart some and settled between them, tilting her head this way and that. She trailed her fingers up and down my calves and then up my thighs. I was holding my breath at this point and felt about as naked as I had ever felt in my life. Her fingers skated up my inner thighs and drifted over my pubic hair, just barely touching it. She smiled a little.
‘How about I let you deduce it, eh?’ Oh yes, I was more than content with this madness, screw dating.
‘Jesus, Sherlock. He fucking shot you. My husband fucking shot you. And now I’m fucking expecting, and it’s too late for me to…' (
‘What’s that?’ I assumed she’d wandered in halfway through a conversation with mind-palace Joan, who (still) magnanimously took over for me when I selfishly abandoned Sherlock to frivolous pursuits like ‘job’, ‘sleep’, or god forbid 'the toilet'…
Ok, I’m spelling this all out clearly now, but at the time, all of this was a sort of crazed simultaneous cacophony in my brain, which horribly wasn’t that unfamiliar, just a new variety of the ‘is Sherlock insane, or am I’ debate which had been my mental bread and butter for about as long as I’d known her.
Sherlock snorted, ‘why on earth would I want to engage in such a blatantly contrived bi-product of the pornography market, and one which you clearly wouldn’t be comfortable with?’
Sherlock nodded. ‘I do… I do want to. But I didn’t know… you did. I didn’t know, Joan!’ She sounded genuinely distressed at the oversight. Which wasn’t that surprising, considering her usual powers of observation.
To my surprise and delight, I discovered being the subject of Sherlock’s real life scrutiny had almost the opposite effect. Perhaps because her real life scrutiny was carried out with her fingers and – lord in heaven – mouth.
It was a vision of myself shouting ‘stop eating my bloody biscuits, and stop licking them off your goddamn fingers’ and slapping her hands away from their methodical activity at her mouth, and grabbing them and sticking them in my mouth, because if you wanted to lick your stupid fingers,
No… Doesn’t actually seem to be though. And I know Sherlock has poo-pooed the notion of gaydar, but mine is generally accurate (she does still try to catch me out on it though – hasn’t succeeded yet).
‘Sorry?’ I hazarded, my longterm project to curb her habit of dark muttering overcoming my inclination that I wouldn’t like whatever it was she was saying.
Sherlock took in a breath. ‘So that’s it then? You’ve had your little say, and now what, we ride off into the proverbial smog-tainted sunset? Would you even
answer, it just seemed like the correct one, the one I was meant to give. Obviously if Sherlock was coming on to me, if she ever did it again, if she
‘God, yes, of course. Just come here, will you?’ John rose to his knees (oh god, the gravel, the pain) and pulled Sherlock to him (oh god, the pulsing skin and posh shampoo) and was immediately overwhelmed by the thousand textures that were Sherlock, and the singing of his blood, which alerted him to the fact that this was all that was right, and good, and about ten years overdue.
There had been enough times in the past where she’d be so brilliant, or so mad, or so ridiculously precious that I just wanted to grab her and squeeze her, like you might a normal person. Maybe. If they were either your boyfriend, or your annoying sibling who you happened not to hate. But I got the feeling that was not on with Sherlock. It wasn’t that she shied away from contact, god knows her respect for personal boundaries was a bit dodgy at the best of times, she just seemed indifferent to it, and wasn’t exactly a cuddly sort of person. Although to be honest, I sometimes got the feeling she might be if she ever got round to admitting it. Quite a few of the strops ended up with her curled up around the union jack pillow in a way that suggested a severe lack of things to hug. I wish I could say I couldn’t imagine a world where Sherlock was starved of affection, but I really could. And that was grim. If anyone could benefit from a bit of a cuddle now and again. Well, I personally thought most people could benefit from that.
Sherlock gave a beleaguered sigh, ‘Well, of course! Her loss would have been a waste of a brilliant mind. I’m not saying I didn’t find her… of value.’
‘Yeah, you, er have that on your business card, don’t you. “Sherlock Holmes. Consulting Detective, world’s only. I couldn’t help but notice”.’
In another time, three years ago, you might’ve said that in a different way. You never saw yourself anywhere like this flat, but back then, it seemed to give you life. Now I can’t imagine how you can be glad to know me. I terribly misjudged our friendship, I misjudged what a vulnerability you were to me, I misjudged the extent to which you'd still be here, waiting, when I came back. I wouldn’t care so much if it didn’t keep putting you in danger. Everything bad that happens to you is because of me, because you know me. Well it was, until Martin. Although I fear, in the bigger picture, he’s also somewhat my fault. I deprived you of two years of
There are so many ways we could die, with the life we lead. You’re so reckless with that magnificent machine of your body, and so am I with… the battered second-hand car that is mine, or at least, I used to be. Now someone has to be around to look after you, because you sure as hell aren’t about to look after yourself. Or at least I tell myself that, again, and again. Almost believe it too. The both of us do.
Aaand that’s quite enough thinking on that topic. So. The girls at work don’t know all that. What they
I felt a puff of air against me that may have been a laugh. I felt her inhale slowly, and then she rose up in one deliberate motion.
John may not have been a deductive genius, but he knew Sherlock, and knew his intermittent admissions of introspection were never without cause.
It’s a funny thing, human memory, he often thought. That old blog he’d kept through the years had led to publishing deals, and his last bit, the
‘Sherlock... It would be more comfortable if… we could move to the bedroom? Yours? Or mine? If you wanted?’
have been felt wrong, scary. Not what Sherlock would have wanted. And how on earth would’ve it helped, admitting that I’d not just lost my best friend but what, something more, the love of my fucking life? That I’d told her she was a machine, and then hadn’t been able to stop her from smashing her brains out in the pavement in front of me? Ha. Yes. That was definitely going to help me on the road to recovery.
‘Because… because it’s what I like more than anything. As you may have noticed. And I think if I had a choice, I’d rather that than somebody messily getting me off with their stubby GP fingers.’
She turned on her heel in the doorway to beam at me, and she pretty much looked exactly like a terrifyingly happy manic genius whose chin had disappeared under the force of the beaming, but it was excellent.
She didn’t say anything. Right. ‘D’you want some?’ I gestured at the popcorn. No reaction. Excellent. I turned my attention back to the telly, wondering idly if the microwave
‘Not your fault.’ You look at me, ‘No. Sherlock. Listen. It’s not your fault. It isn’t. This is on him.’
‘As it turns out,’ Sherlock was saying, ‘I may not be entirely immune to relationships of a physical nature.’
) when I faked my own death, and now my recent miscalculations have put fissures in your marriage – the one thing you managed to salvage out of those years. It’s the least I could give, I guess, to leave you to that.
‘Yes, anything.’ I tried to convey as best possible I what I meant. Without saying it. God save me from having to say it.
‘Yeah. Yeah. I did. Didn’t realise you noticed. Don’t know what I was thinking.’ I had pressed my lips once against her shoulder, all the freckle constellations scratched out by bright pink scars.
Bugger, she’d seen the profile then. Damn blowflies. And she was on about the sodding Whitechapel thing again.
‘Good, because we’re already behind schedule, and I’d rather not be further delayed by preventable set-backs.’
‘The teal beret? Was it just because of the accident with the Whitechapel Barber, or is it part of a new headwear code for people of your age to signal to prospective partners that you’ve been pressured into this by your co-workers?’
‘Yeah, sure, you love it,’ I said, happily discovering a rogue pillow near at hand to whack her with.
Sherlock snorted, ‘I have a far wider conversational range than anyone you’ve selected to go out with. If you want to converse with someone over supper, I’ve made it clear that I am willing to accompany you, even if I don’t particularly feel like eating. I stop on cases for you, Joan, for your stomach.’
One of her hands had moved from my leg, and her fingers eased their way into me. One, two, three. Sherlock moaned outright as she sucked the throbbing apex of my clit between her lips and danced her tongue across it. I came, without warning, and without realising it was coming on until I was writhing obscenely against her mouth and fingers, and invoking every known deity plus several spontaneously invented ones.
’, and then it’s me, and all the myriad ways to end myself in your flat. My flat. Our flat. My flat now that you’re gone, and my grief, but your ghost, providing all the ways for me to take care of that. In this version, no matter how much I believe in you, I don’t believe enough to take away the last things I said to your living, breathing face. I believe in you, but I don’t believe you’re coming back, and part of me believes that I killed you. I was the person you were closest to in all the world, they tell me, so who could have saved you if not me?
I still hoped a bit like that now, hoped she could tell from how I was kissing her, and from how I held her face in my hands. Smooth, so smooth, her alien skin, the fine hairs of her eyebrows and temples, the hair that was live and perfect, and not broken, and not caked with blood.
‘What am I saying, of course you’ll make me bloody say it. Sherlock. Holmes. God help me, may I never have to say this again. It has come to my attention over the past few weeks that my proximity apparently makes you hard. Ok?’
Through all that though, I'd understood pretty plainly that I couldn’t be gay because I’d always liked boys well enough, and I’d had it pointed out plenty of times by my sister how ‘not gay’ I was. Nearly before I knew it was a thing you could be. It seemed fairly black and white to me at the time. I was comfortable as a sister/friend/doctor/soldier and I had never bothered thinking much outside of that.
‘Yes, but I refuse to accept that practicality or fashion sensibility defines gender, it’s a social construct, obviously,’ Sherlock was saying as she dandled her drink in an aloof manner.
‘John, I was a temporary diversion for her, an interesting game. And likewise. I admire her cleverness, but that’s all.’
And then all of a sudden I was kissing Sherlock, and it wasn’t ‘quite nice’, it was fucking amazing. When I put my hand on her neck she made a little noise in the back of her throat and curled into my palm like she was a cat, and I could feel her little gasp in my mouth, and I thought, well in for a penny, in for a pound, and I saw if I couldn’t taste her bottom lip, and I could, and then there was her tongue, and her mouth, and I was probably insane but it seemed like the warmest, slipperiest most sickly delightful place I’d ever been. She was drawing me into her, and devouring me, and gripping my face with her hands, and whispering my name into my own mouth. And I was… I had my hands tangled in her hair, and I was allowed to touch it, allowed to run my palms along the satiny warmth of her neck, I and I didn’t have to pretend it was admiration, I didn’t have to wonder what it felt like, and it was brilliant, it was…
It was the same look she had when she asked if things were ‘not good’, the same look when she’d asked if she’d mucked up her maid of honour speech, and oh god, it reminded me of the night she’d come back from the dead. That brilliant, horrible, enraging night. When she’d been so bloody wrong about everything. But then so had I.
In the end we remain, and remain, and remain. And now central London will find you with a forgiving lap in which to rest your head, a familiar pulse against your ear, and a hand in your hair to mollify whatever alternative beginnings and endings and in-betweens might drop in to give pause to your brilliant brain. And we will have that for many years, because the universe may be many things, but it is neither lazy nor cruel as a rule. As far as I can tell, there are no rules as such, just random collisions. So, much as the other random collisions that
'Buru- oh no, I don't even want to know.' I hadn't known Sherlock could read Japanese until earlier in the week, when I'd discovered an extensive search in my browser history involving vending machines and used pants. It probably reflected poorly on the state of my life that I hadn't even bothered questioning why Sherlock looked these things up.  Or why the more cringeworthy the item was, the more likely I'd find her commandeering
(2) Joan may not always be the paragon of body positivity, but Sherlock is a fan, as are we.  Long live Joan's gloriously amorphous stomach-hip-thigh zone!
Then Sherlock was back to kneeling in front of me. I realised I was bracing myself against the chair. I thought maybe I should stop, but I couldn’t think of what else to do. I could see her eyes flicking back and forth, I could see the fleck of discolouration in her right iris, I could hear her sharp, shallow little breaths. I realised I might not be the only one who was terrified. I closed my eyes.
Sherlock nodded against me, remaining cocooned in my limbs. After a few minutes, I thought she might just stay there. But then she gingerly extracted herself to bring her eyes level with mine, and placed one of her long hands on either side of my face. She sipped in air, as though she might speak, and when she didn’t, I wondered if the words had gotten stuck somewhere in her head. It had happened before. At last, she spoke, ‘It always has been, for me. You. Always you. Only you.’
‘No. No. Sherlock, that’s not what I- That’s not what I meant.’ John beseeched the empty room. Scrubbing his face with his hands, he made his way to the bedroom door. ‘Sherlock, will you let me in,’ he knocked.
I thought about how I hoped, in spectacular cowardice, that she would be bright enough to know anyway, and had tried to convince myself that it was enough, when I knew it wasn’t.
Let it be known that I hate these kinds of events. I particularly hate them when Sherlock insists that I come along, and then does not show up at the allotted time.
She’d scooted down a bit further and pressed her lips on the inside of my thigh, just above my knee. A wave of horrified pleasure sidled up the affected nerve as I realised that I hadn’t bothered to shave my legs for… oh dear. I’m not sure for how long. Sherlock removed her lips and pressed her forehead against my leg, nuzzling it. ‘Is this making you uncomfortable?’
I was still humming merrily to myself when Sherlock came home. She stopped in the doorway, scarf in hand and eyed the flat.
‘Hey.’ I whispered, and wrapped my arm round her neck so I could kiss her. She sighed against my mouth, seemingly discovering the same thing I had about her skin against mine.
Her eyes were closed again as she leant against my skin, I could feel her eyelashes flutter across it. I was reminded briefly of a cat and catnip.
military grade pistol that he did himself in with, judging by the haircut, or what’s left of it, and the tan, not above the sleeves, so unlikely he’d been on holiday. You can’t get a tan like that in Britain this time of year, and that bullet wound on his shoulder can’t have been healed more than six months. So, which sunny climate would see you invalided out of the military in the last six months? It would have to be either Afghanistan, or Iraq.’
When morning came, I was surprised, but not really, to find the bed still populated by one mad consulting detective currently drooling enthusiastically onto my collarbone.  It was the first of many firsts, thought by no means the end of others. While I often, in future, woke entangled in Sherlock’s limpet-like embrace, our home was never a stranger to 4 am experiments, police summons, or insomnia-induced violin interludes. However, on this day, I woke for the first time, perhaps in my whole conscious life, with the contentment of knowing that all the things I loved best were in one place, and that place was with me, and that place was home. Anyone who reads up on our cases will know we haven’t lacked in excitement or incident, but through it all, I’ve never had to wake up as one divided again, and that is worth everything.
