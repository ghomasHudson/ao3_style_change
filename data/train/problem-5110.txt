“Head Alpha Winchester, we would like your blessing on our union,” Ketch’s British accent only made the moment all the more formal, and Dean’s face split into a grin.
“I think, I need to talk to the girls first, especially Emma. I just… you were what I always thought that I-” Her words trailed off. She had to let go and if she could still have some form of friendship with Dean, then wanted that. But she knew it would take time. She had so much resentment and anger inside of her still, only now she was beginning to see that most of it was at herself… she had made the decision long ago to hold onto him, even though she had always known he was meant for another, somewhere out there and it turned out to be Castiel Novak.
for a slow and torturous death,” Dean growled out. Karen as well as Rowena nodded their confirmations to go with him.
Not only had his parents placed themselves in a staggering predicament, Castiel was the one to pay for it. The Novaks owed too much to the Winchesters and if they hoped to ever save face or any semblance of dignity… all that was left to do was give the wealthy Duke of Winchester their only Omega son as an appeasement in the hopes of renewed heights in society. However there were specific conditions and Castiel was already disheartened with the first attempt's outcome.
“Wizard?” the Omega asked as the horse started to jump on his front legs to keep Castiel away and he had never felt so confused. Suddenly Hercules let out a high neigh that ended in a squeal, and Castiel turned around to look at him. Galaxy went up on his high legs and snorted aggressively, and Castiel didn’t understand what the hell was happening. They weren’t scared of him, but something was very wrong as the three large horses moved to keep him away from the forest.
“Spare me the cheerful bullshit Dean! You were supposed to be my forever, you were supposed to love me like I deserved!” Tears started to slip down her cheeks as her pleading eyes looked at her ex and his son… “Why couldn’t it be you… like I hoped… “ She whispered as she whipped at her tears angrily. She had always known… their whole relationship she had known he had simply settled, that he did love her, just not as a true lover… and she had held on. Held on as tightly as she could and had decades with the Alpha she had loved her whole life.
It had been a decade, and still, he couldn’t understand those words. They rang throughout his skull as his vision blurred, and he stumbled towards a clearing. He could just make out patches of green grass amid the snow covered grounds, and as he fell to his knees and collapsed forward, he begged for the Goddess Asena to simply take him. He had no meaning. He was a lone, rogue wolf with no one and nothing. How could he be meant for anything else but animal food? It wasn’t long before his eyes slid shut, and just before the darkness came to claim him, he heard wolves howl.
Castiel watched as she glared at his brother, and a coldness that had always unnerved him about her seeped through. “He should be dead. The only reason he is breathing is so I can study him and make sure no one else will be affected.”
“Alpha Masters!” Ketch was suddenly there, and rushed towards them across the lawn. He looked outraged, growling as he came closer.
“What are you making?” Dean asked as the Omega’s happy scent spiked with contentment.
“Chulym River,” Crowley corrected as they piled into the SUV, a covered pick-up truck following close behind. “Alright so, what do we know?”
“Hmm?”
“I’m not quite sure,” he stated honestly. He didn’t feel wrong, nor frustrated or irritated as he normally did. He always felt restless, needing to do something in order to get that calm that he was now somehow feeling, without having-
Castiel choked back a sob as he felt a strong, warm hand clasp his. He looked up to find Dean by his side, his gaze lost in the flames much like his own was, and then he spotted Bela on the Alpha’s other side, holding on to his other hand. She nodded at him, sadness and sympathy clear in her pretty features, and Castiel felt grateful for her kindness. He laced his fingers with Dean’s and turned back to watch the pyre as the flames roared and smoke and ashes danced in the wind. Adam’s unique scent drifted over the pack, like the gentle Alpha’s final goodbye.
Dean made his way downstairs and out of the house, finding the yard filled with pack members—including Sam, Charlie and Pam—who watched him emerge. He hadn’t bothered putting on anything but his jeans and he was still barefoot, which suited him just fine.
Castiel looked up in surprise and saw a beautiful female Omega in a pale pink robe come towards the island.
“Why do we have to do this now?” Bela demanded as Crowley arched a brow at her, yet Dean was the one to answer.
Dean saw Castiel’s eyes lowered to his lips and when he pulled him into a kiss, the Alpha was ready. He had wanted this for so long, and when the simple press of their lips ended, he caressed Castiel’s cheek and neck as his lips followed for another kiss. “Is this okay?” Dean asked as Castiel found himself pressed against the wall. Castiel nodded his head eagerly and then Dean’s lips were back on his. He teased Cas’ bottom lip with a lick and the Omega moaned, permitting the Alpha to deepen the kiss hungrily. His large right hand buried itself in Castiel’s dark locks and the other was on his neck, over his mating gland as the Alpha’s thumb caressed his cheek. Castiel’s own hands traveled the broad expanse of his shoulders and carded through Dean’s hair, still damp from his shower.
“Now, how about you get out of this supply closet and we’ll go into your office. Dean and Ellie are in Garth’s office so they won’t see you.”
“Dean-”’ Castiel tried but the Alpha wouldn’t look at him.
He wasn’t going to last, heat pulled in the pit of his stomach as his toes curled when Dean slid his index finger between their cocks, adding to the delirious intensity as his climax started to slowly unravel throughout his limbs.
“No, what they do to their own is not our predicament. We, as Cecaelia, will only punish for the murder of the wee ones that never had a chance. Dean will be the one to decide if he chooses to hold the Merfolk responsible for their treatment of
Dean cracked his neck and roared. Many pack members covered their ears as they cowered from the rage radiating from him. Michael looked up quickly with wide, shocked eyes and Dean smelled his fear.
Charlie’s eyebrows hit her hairline as she thought about that. “Well, there you have it I guess. Bela loves Dean, always has and always will, and she obviously just wants him to be happy, and if she also believes it's with you—”
“What?” Castiel was stunned. Of course it had occurred to him every day since Dean had initiated the divorce but… but he felt confused and helpless like he was stuck on a spin cycle and didn’t know how the hell to get off.
“Cas, Charlie,” he nodded his hellos as he filled his plate with bacon. “Thinking of taking a walk in the wild, Cas?” Dean asked as he chewed his food.
Only a week later, Dean had shown up at his apartment with his packed bags and announced he had signed the divorce papers and told Jo he had met Castiel. The Omega looked down at his still sleeping husband and took his large hand in both of his and kissed it as he nuzzled it. Their union had been a bit awkward in the beginning. They had shared Castiel’s small apartment, Dean had insisted on sleeping on the sofa bed and for a few weeks, they had danced around each other, gotten to know each other while figuring out their feelings in link to their wolves. When their friendship had turned (rather quickly) into a romantic one, their first night… Castiel laced his hand with Dean and watched his sleeping love. That first night, Dean had cherished him, had shown him exactly how much he desired him, and had left Castiel in a shock of euphoria. No one had ever physically loved him the way Dean did and still did. The Alpha had made it his mission to learn the Omega’s body, his every hot spot and mold them all to his advantage that continuously left Castiel greedily mewling for more.
“I love them too,” Castiel said as he placed his basket on the grass and made sure to give each of the horses some much needed pets and kisses.
“Hmm? I’m right here.”
“Yes.”
“Wonderful. Now, Castiel, please come with me. I will return you safely to your mate’s den once we are finished with our visit,” the Sorceress informed them, as she inclined her head towards Castiel to follow.
He knew instinctively that the Omega wouldn’t go into the larger cities, but would prefer the proximity of the beach. Castiel had always preferred more intimate surroundings when it came to interacting, and from the tiny bit of information he was going on for his search, he was pretty sure it still applied.
“Alrighty then!” She winked at him and proceeded to carefully glide the wand over Castiel’s now gel-covered pup bump.
Day 59: I woke up with marks all over me! I can feel it… the noises… the whispers…
Dean was watching them now. Lily, Claire and Jack were just a few feet away with their mama. Castiel was showing them how to feed the horses. Those massive creatures loved his Omega, and Dean smiled as the horses nuzzled him and made the pups laugh, watching with awed gazes.
“Will I be able to say goodbye?” the Omega asked in barely a whisper, and Benny wasn’t ready for those soulful blue eyes, dancing with unshed tears, to look up at him so heart wrenchingly.
“So it’s Castiel and not Jimmy, then,” Meg asked, sporting a smirk, as Castiel’s bright blue eyes landed on her.
A knock roused Castiel from his reading. “Cassie? What are you still doing here? It's nearly ten o’clock.”
Castiel smiled and framed the Alpha’s face with his hands, kissing him sweetly. “I want this, I want us.” Dean smiled at his reply, green eyes filled with adoration. Lust swirled in the emerald depths, and a thin ring of Alpha red had started to appear.
He was stunning.
“Charlie… I… Dean is...” He couldn’t explain himself. Dean was his hero… He was Adam’s brother and it felt wrong… He lusted after Dean, when he had never felt this way for Adam—his mate—outside of their heat/rut cycles. And he was gravely unprepared for handling such desires. He wanted to be nestled in Dean’s arms, and found himself slightly jealous of Lily being about to nap and drool in his strong embrace… He loved Dean’s smile… dear moon goddess it made his heart thunder. Just hearing Dean’s voice calmed him and energized him all at once, and these erratic feelings were so frustrating because they seemed to continue growing and he had no idea what to do about them.
What did it mean? Was that what had attacked him? No…that didn’t feel right. If anything, the thought of them was oddly soothing, as if they would protect him. It was so strange, and it made no sense. Something was happening. He knew it; he felt it in his bones, but couldn't begin to fathom putting it all into words. What had changed? Why was his mind suddenly fighting so hard to revive memories that had been dormant for so long? Something had set it off, but what? Whatever the hell it was, it had awakened his libido as well. That had been completely unexpected, and too real to have been imagined.
He remembered when he found out he was pregnant… how scared and excited he had been all at once.
Dean was about to ask why when Charlie arched a brow at him. “Because that's your bite on his neck. I know you’ll tell me everything later, and believe me, I want to know it all. But right now there’s a pregnant Omega with your bite in a strange new place and he needs whatever will make him feel as relaxed and content as possible.”
“Is this prudent? Dean may be one of our best Hunters, and it is his right to avenge the slaughter, but shouldn’t we wait upon his return? It is his right, his war, and we as  Cecaelia may only interfere if he wishes it,” Henry, one of the Elder Cecaelian Council, and one of the oldest Alphas in their clan, voiced as the council convened for a meeting.
Castiel smiled in return. His heart was racing and he did feel warm, but he knew it was because of Dean’s close proximity and he was furious with himself. He and Dean would get physically close all the time, why was he reacting so strongly now? He was internally thankful that the Alpha had decided to put on a henley. His arm tingled as Dean caressed him there before he stood and promised to check on him later.
He couldn’t find it in him to reply when Charlie abruptly stood, patted Pam on the shoulder and was gone the next moment. Castiel frowned and was about to see where she had gone, only for Lily to start a round of ‘awwooos,’ Dean joining her with his own, much deeper and more powerful howls. He completely forgot about Charlie.
Sam looked ‘Meg’ over. Dean has scented her and outed her, but how was she here? “What clan are you from,” he demanded, and Meg rubbed at one of her arms. She watched Dean whispering words into Castiel’s ear and caressing him, his pain clear and painful to watch.
Castiel smiled at him. It was a beautiful, genuinely stunning sight that made Dean’s heart race.
“Damnit…” Castiel whispered as he flushed all over once more and hated it. This was completely unseemly behavior. Dean had been nothing but good to him and the Alpha had just recently broken things off with Bela and this… This was wrong of him, Castiel chastised himself. Guilt ate at him. Dean was his Alpha in name and bite only, and he couldn’t help but feel as if he was being disrespectful to Dean, and to Bela… Granted, he couldn’t help what he dreamt about but still, now fully awake and able to remember the ghost of the touch from Dean’s large calloused warm hands on him… shit.
“I hope I didn’t wake you. I got home a little while ago and just wanted to kiss her goodnight, even though it's three am,” Dean admitted in a whisper. He looked at the Omega before him. Castiel was always so beautiful… It was so effortless, and Dean was completely bewitched. He bit his lower lip as he took him in… dressed in one of the pajamas sets he loved, the pants and the button up, baby pink with soft white hearts all over them. His hair was wild from sleep and his dark blue eyes twinkled with emotions that Dean wanted to explore but wasn’t sure how. He smelled so good, sleepy and happy, soothing, and Dean just wanted to bury his face in his neck and fall asleep wrapped up around him.
“Makes sense.”
In true Winchester fashion, they were out the door and on the road in under ten minutes.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Hi Hercules, I brought you a banana,” Castiel told him as the horse snorted and tousled Castiel’s dark hair, making him laugh as he held up the banana for him.
Nothing had to change.
Dean pulled him up onto his lap, buried a hand in his dark hair and kissed him fiercely. “We can wait,” Dean reassured him, voice deep and growling with lust, yet Castiel knew if he said to stop, Dean would without reproach.
“That may be, but with Adam’s demise, Castiel is without an Alpha, and no self-respecting Alpha will take in another’s pup, nor an Omega now considered ‘loose’ since he is pregnant.” Bartholomew’s snide and disgusting statement made Dean twitch. He wanted to punch that smirk right off and rip off his head.
“Morning, let's get started shall we? This is quite a simple meeting as the terms are ‘irreconcilable differences’ meaning a no-fault divorce. So, Omega Novak or do you prefer Dr. Novak?” The female Alpha asked and Castiel had to physically make himself look away from Dean to address her. The removal of ‘Winchester’ wasn’t lost on him and it hurt more then he would have imagined.
Beep Beep, Beep Beep.
Castiel nodded numbly. Too eager and in a daze just from feeling his husband's hands upon him, demanding, groping and caressing as instinct urged the Omega to scramble up onto the bed and present. With slick already easing from his hole, he buried his face in the pillows as Dean kneeled behind him. The heat that came from his Alpha’s skin, the scent of his arousal and the touch of his large hands on his flank made the Omega keen. It had been much too long and a distant voice reminded him it was his fault for always being away, yet he pushed away the voice and frantically keened for his Alpha, arched his back and spread his legs just so that had Dean growling in approval.
Dean closed his eyes and sat down heavily on one of the stools. He should be the one overseeing the funeral preparations, he should be the one taking his newest pack member shopping… Instead, everyone let him sleep in and he felt both grateful and irritated at that.
The group of Cecaelia Warriors escorted Castiel, Gabriel and Karen safely between them as they dragged the restrained seven Merfolk along. The waters were silent, and the currents clearly indicated they were not alone, yet they couldn’t see any predators.
“Yes, thank you,” Sam replied for them both, as the tall Cecaelia and the Sorceress eyed each other hungrily. Castiel smirked. Well, then.
“Me too... “ he admitted, and then Dean’s eyes turned Alpha red as Castiel felt his own eyes turning Omega gold. Their wolves were responding strongly to the new intimacy and had clearly acknowledged their new mate. “Dean…” Castiel could feel his heart thundering and his whole body was suddenly boiling. He could feel slick start to ease from his hole, his scent potent in the air between them and Dean groaned.

Dean had announced the birth and of course, per traditions, there would be a Cresening that the entire pack could attend. Castiel was extremely nervous about it. Showing off Lily to everyone made him feel wary and fiercely protective of his little one. He trusted Dean to make sure Lily was safe, he truly did… But when she cuddled his daughter closer to his chest as she sighed in her sleep, Castiel just wanted to hide her away, keep her sheltered from prying eyes, and raise and nurture her in peace. He didn’t know why he felt so fearful, so unwilling to parade Lily around. He summed it up to being a brand new mama, and knew there was no actual danger. Lily’s soft scent was slowly putting him to sleep as they laid together on his plush bed. He had never felt such contentment, such surging and life-altering love for anyone like he did for this perfect little bundle that slept in his embrace.
“You Omega Novak?” The gruff man demanded.
“Hello Dean.” Castiel’s voice was raw and trembled ever so slightly as he stayed curled in on himself. He wouldn’t meet the Alpha’s eyes.
Castiel looked away and bit his bottom lip as he set his teacup down. “I, well, maybe a movie night, just us and Lily?”
“Sure. I’m gonna go back to bed I think.” Castiel stood and started towards his room. He stopped in the doorway and looked back, watching the Alpha finish his orange juice and then he was out the door, leaving happy whiffs of pine and bergamot behind.
“Is this necessary?” Charlie growled out as she too started to put her things away.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel greeted, as he looked up at his love who had fought to come back to him, just as he had promised. His heart soared, and he ran towards the Dragon, who roared in glee at the sight of his Healer.
“I want to be there. I want to witness,” Castiel voiced softly.
Dean’s words rang in his head like a mantra, and he closed his eyes. He felt as if there was something…someone else inside of him…his wolf? Castiel tried to wrap his mind around what was happening, and the slivers of information he had skimmed through. His own wolf, his DNA, his other half, was waking up, and it all sounded completely fucking insane!
Castiel took his time as he fussed with Jack’s bag while holding him on his hip and feeding him his favorite blue binky. The pup was his miracle baby. He couldn’t stop nuzzling him, taking in his baby smell as much as he could while he could. Dean had told him to take advantage of it, cause pups grew way too fast. The Omega turned in the hallway and looked into the room where his lover was resting. The nurse was going about checking on him in a blur of white that was going around the room while he kept his eyes on his Alpha.
“No?” Dean looked at him wide eyed, his scent turned sour and bold as his anger seeped into his voice.
“No, not at all. It had been the furthest thing from my mind. He would get visions or flashbacks at times, and said he mostly felt sensations,but he would remember green eyes, and eventually the name Dean,” she informed him quietly, as Castiel stirred and whimpered on the bed. The Omega’s heat was making him shiver and moan.
the hushed whispers, the screams and shrieks, the grunts and growls of the humans and werewolves that continued to help like ants on a mission. Resounding sounds sang in his head from his own wolf that he couldn’t quite make out, while his instincts begged him to move, move,
Gabriel turned back towards the gathering. Everyone was on edge, impossibly silent. All movement ceased as each Merfolk looked towards the sounding horns. Fear was potent in the water as the Omegas hid behind their Alphas while all eyes and attention was towards the western borders. Gabriel spotted Naomi emerging from Hester’s cave, helping the Sorceress swim out as Zachariah and his four trusted helpers, Anael, Ruby, Alistair and Gordon, came rushing out of the Elder’s meeting cove. Zachariah was wide eyed and just as confused at what this could all mean, while Naomi struggled to keep Hester awake.
“What the fuck…” His fingertips traced over his scruffy beard as his mind went wild. What the fuck hell hole had he stepped into? He was a goddamn carpenter from Lawrence, Kansas, married to his kindergarten teacher husband for the last seven years. He wasn’t some ghost hunter! Dean had never been in a situation remotely close to ‘scary’ or creepy for that matter, and this was bringing his peaceful simple life into a whirlwind of what the actual fuck.
The redhead Omega came and knelt next to him. “Okay yes, but not fully…”
“He has your bite! Your scent clouded around him, and he wore your collar!”
The Alpha sat up and wiped away his tears. The bed felt cold and Bela’s scent was faint, letting him know she had been up for some time. He looked at the alarm clock on his nightstand and to his surprise it was already past eleven. Dean frowned, feeling pretty sure it had been ass-early, and a bit miffed no one had bothered to wake him. He stood and donned a pair of jeans and a green henley before heading down the stairs.
Of course, rumors had started when Hester remained reclusive, and only Zachariah and Naomi were allowed to visit her. Not even Charles was allowed to see her, which had only served to make Gabriel worry all the more. Out of the four Elders on the counsel, Charles was the only one remotely caring for their community. Many considered him the weak link because of his knack for sympathizing with whatever Merfolk was in need of something from the Council.
Now, weeks later that had felt like years, Castiel found himself seated at the long table with his divorce lawyer, a Beta named Charlotte Bradbury who had come highly recommended and known well in  Omega circles. She was warm and sympathetic and had been a bit surprised when he had been adamant that he didn’t want this divorce. He supposed in her line of work most Omegas wanted to get away from their Alphas, but this wasn’t the case. Just the fact that he needed a divorce lawyer gnawed at his heart. He had tried his best to look presentable as they waited for Dean and his lawyer to arrive but Castiel just wanted the floor to swallow him whole. He didn’t want to be here, he didn’t want this divorce, he didn’t want any of this, he just wanted his Alpha and pup back home where they should be…
“So what now?” Bela asked as Sam still struggled to make full sentences, his mind too shocked that his brother was somehow gone.
Dean took a deep breath as he motioned for her to sit down with him on their large bed. “Look, the trip didn’t exactly go as planned.”
“I agree with you, Lorraine, but we must be smart about this. I suggest once Dean returns, and he
Of course there were a few differences this time around. Like the fact that Bobby was gone. Yet Dean and Sam knew they had to keep going. Their mentor had been proud of them and they would continue to make him proud by saving people and taking out everything that went bump in the night without Heaven and Hell playing them like pieces of a board game.
“You okay?” Dean asked quietly in the space between them. Castiel nodded and the Alpha beamed. Castiel somehow tuned out the rest of what Dean was saying, in a daze as Dean kissed his forehead, affirming the Head Alpha’s protection and gratitude for birthing a pup. In the next moment, Dean gently took Lily, who was already reaching for him, lifted her to nuzzle his face into the pup’s bare stomach, and then turned her for the pack members to see his markings had transferred over to the pup’s chest, stomach and a tiny bit on her diaper.
Dean’s lips were on his then, and Castiel was wild with need as the Alpha started a smooth, deep pace.
Dean clenched his jaw. “It was the right thing to do,” he replied confidently and he meant it, felt it down to his toes, and that was what he had to hold on to.
As the word ‘mate’ slipped passed those flush pink lips, a resounding hum, excited and howling, came from within Dean. His wolf was overjoyed, and damn well dancing as it confirmed all of those happy feelings and sensations since he had woken up.
“We just found out who his ex husband is and that he happens to be a patient here.” Jody stated as Balthazar arched a brow in question. “Dean Winchester and Ellie Winchester.”
“You must be of the Winchester Pack.” A woman with auburn hair, tied up into a tight bun, came towards them.
“Yes, well to make sure our great leader doesn’t upset the delicate balance of having two Omegas, I went ahead and made sure two collar were made,” Crowley revealed, lifting the top collar to reveal a second beneath it, identical to the first.
He must not have heard her correctly. Everything in him panicked, and he wanted to deny that she’d caught him looking at the Head Alpha with heart eyes… “I—”
“Mom, Dad, this is Castiel, my mate.” The Omega’s eyes went wide. These two were his mate’s parents. “Cas, my parents, Mary and John.”
in this too-short glimpse had left him gasping as his eyes filled with tears of sheer joy. The euphoric delight he felt gave him a pulsing and resounding ring inside, and were still sensations he couldn’t dream of putting into words. Yet, all he could truly take away from it was that Dean had been a thought, and then something about
“Truly?” Ketch asked as Dean hugged Bela and then turned to him and pulled him in for his own hug.
“Daa!” The sound of the pup Jack followed by Dean’s snort and smile brought Jo back to the present with a cold chill. Dean has a son… a boy and the hurt pierced and she wished wholeheartedly that it wouldn’t and yet she couldn’t stop her words. "So, first it’s an exotic male Omega, twenty years younger, couldn't be more different than me, and to top it all off, he gives you a son"
“Bela is
“I understand he is your brother, or was. He is turning into a monster, and the wards don’t make a mistake. Just look at his mouth, his elongated fangs…his body has changed, and its disgusting,” Dr. Hess informed him.
Dean sat on the sand as the waves crashed in. Sam had gone to get them ‘food’ and Dean had wanted to be alone with his thoughts. He fished out the large pink pearl from his satchel and held it in his hands. He remembered when he had found it, when he had realized that it was the perfect gift to give to Castiel and ask him to mate. The Omega’s reaction had been adorable, which had then turned quite sensual. Dean hadn’t been expecting it, yet it had been absolutely perfect.
Castiel carefully made his way over to the tub. As much as he wanted to crawl into the soft-looking bed, he yearned for a hot, calming bath first.
“Well, its open.” Sam added as he took a swing of his beer and kept his eyes on Dean.
Crowley huffed and turned on his heels, leaving them alone.
“We are heartbroken over what happened to your offspring,” Mary whispered, as she leaned against her mate while they wrapped their tentacles around one another.
“Michael has issued an ‘engin áskorun um vopnapakka,’” Crowley informed him smoothly, which made Dean stop moving all together. He looked at the short Beta and gestured for him to continue, while Bela murmured behind him that she had no idea and wasn’t part of this. “He filled with the Elders and is making it an official challenge.”
A deep and foreign feeling bloomed inside of him as Castiel looked up at him with a small, yet welcoming and genuine, smile.
He let himself indulge in the thought, as there was no one around while he watched his Alpha play with Lily… He couldn’t stop himself from wondering what it would be like to kiss those bowed lips, to have those majestic green eyes look at him filled with lust, to be taken care of by Dean on a much more intimate level. He felt flushed from just a few innocent thoughts, and pressed the cool glass against his cheeks to cool down.
“Dean!”
“He was my friend Dean. I couldn’t let Anna be alone at his burial…” Dean sighed angrily through his nose as Bela looked up at him, and the sadness that filled in her chocolate and raspberry scent made Dean swallow nauseously.
Bela’s words still swirled in his head as he was relaxed and sated by Castiel’s scent surrounding him. She was right, he felt good, he felt right. He was exactly where he was supposed to be. Dean glanced over at the male Omega and he smirked, Castiel had already fallen asleep just minutes into the movie.
“Hey,” Bela greeted him quietly as she caressed his cheek.
“Yes, it does. Emma is completely convinced that Cas is some evil demon and we are out to hurt you, even though we haven’t heard or spoken to you beyond whatever the girls will tell me.”
Castiel nuzzled her as she looked up at the birds taking flight from the tree overhead. She wiggled in his arms and tried to smile, her big blue eyes filled with wonder. These perfect, quiet moments were what Castiel cherished the most. Lily was thoroughly curious about everything around her and he smiled at her, knowing he would be here to teach her and show her things, be part of her ‘firsts’ and help her along. He had never felt so eager about his future as he did then.
“Hello, Benny. How are you?”
Castiel felt confused as his mind rushed to figure out what was going on. He had been happy, completely content with having his Alpha’s collar and then… his daughter… the pain he had felt as she moved wildly inside of him, and then the sight of the massive wolf…. Dean’s emotions and him slamming shut the tendrils of their delicate bond… Castiel suddenly felt nauseous as a pounding headache started to make itself known, and he moved to lay on the bed.
When he had finally left the bath and found himself dressed in his sleeping gown, his mind wouldn’t cease. Fear danced steadily in his stomach and he fought the tears that were threatening to slip past his lashes. What if the Lord Dean didn’t want him just like his younger brother? Castiel’s father would punish him and as the Omega thought about his sisters and the horrific way their father made them ‘work’... but there was also fear of the Lord Dean himself. The very few Alphas Castiel had met in his young life hadn’t been kind in nature. Perhaps Lord Dean would agree to marriage and mate him, but what if he was the one that would hurt him? Castiel had witnessed countless times when his sisters would come home with bruises and on the very few horrifying times black eyes, split lips and blood on their under garments. Both Anna and Rachel had both been too proud to let Castiel help them or cater to them, their gazes always with so much loathed bitterness it still made his heart ache.
“Fuck…” He could barely see anything, but it could only be one of two possible things: the gas pump or ignition point inside the distributor. He placed the flashlight in his mouth to look at the motor, trying to mind his hands so as not to burn himself, and sighed. He couldn’t see in this little light, and it wasn’t like he could fix whatever it was right this second. Dean stood and closed the hood, and leaned against the car as he rubbed his face in irritation. He couldn’t just stay here. He sighed and turned back to the car, and made sure to lock it up tight before he started to tail it back to the damn gas station. The rain was letting up, and he felt a bit of relief that it wouldn’t be such a shitty night when the sound of rustling in the nearby wooded terrain made him stop in his tracks.
Castiel didn’t wait for anything further and as quickly as he could, made his way to the nursery.
It had been a week since Bela had moved out, and she’d found a nearby house to rent. Dean was still struggling to accept his own feelings. He wasn’t upset, and that’s what worried him. Here was this remarkable woman, this special Omega, and he’d fully believed in their love and relationship, had planned to marry her, the whole nine yards, and yet… she left the house, her belongings all gone, a spare space in the bedroom closet, and her scent dissipated… and he felt like he could finally breathe… He felt like a complete asshole for letting her go. Yet everything in him knew that if he had argued to make her stay, they both would have continued on in a pale imitation of what had once been a strong, loving and fun relationship. That relationship no longer existed.
“Not very long, maybe three, four hours? You woke up just in time to feed her.”
Dean was heaving as he tried to catch his breath after he had released his pent up anger and fear in that scream, and suddenly everything was eerily silent. Even the rain and the winds seemed to have suddenly stopped on a spinning dime, and Dean shuffled up to his feet and made it to the window by the bed. Raindrops decorated everything in sight,  yet the rainfall itself had indeed stopped abruptly. Dean held his breath as minutes ticked by, and then the warm orange and pink rays of the morning sun slowly started to creep through the dense woods, casually caressing and illuminating the whole field and the cabin in its sunlight.
“Oh, hey guys. What's going on?” Charlie asked, smelling a mix of anger, irritation and sorrow in the room. Next to her, Castiel tried to discreetly cover his mouth as the strong scents made him nauseous.
“Dean-”
“I’ll call Dean—”
Dean was patting himself on the back for bringing Lily with him to this meeting. He had been dreading it for months, had known for some time that this would eventually be brought up, and was damn surprised it had taken this long for the ripple effect of his actions to come back at him. Having the pup with him had definitely helped him keep his cool.
Meg watched as Jimmy laughed with Benny. “How’s the puzzle?” Jo asked gently, as she came to stand next to her on the restaurant’s dock.
Dean had been ready to tell everyone right then and there, however, Castiel had pleaded with him to wait… he had wanted to go to the doctor's office and get confirmation. He had also voiced his fears that night. His age, it was his first and wanted to get passed the first trimester to be sure everything was ok. Dean had held him, told him how everything was going to be just fine and that he loved him.
Flashes of the journal’s bold and erratic rants came back to his mind and the words ‘don’t listen’ rang through his head as he tried to concentrate. The monster outside continued to bait him with his lover’s voice. No. No. No.
A text message from Emma brought her back to the here and now. Dean had a stroke, and she had to see him, had to see for herself he was alive. She swallowed her pride and left the house for the hospital.
“You weren’t expecting a Cecaelia Alpha,” Sam supplied.
“Yeah, I remember Garth saying something about it.” Dean grumbled as he tried to continue reading an article about a suspicious death on his laptop.
He stayed still for a moment as another memory of his lover played across his mind.
“Yeah, he’s taking a bath. I need to borrow a t-shirt and sweatpants from you,” Charlie announced.
A vacation. Not the kind where you just stayed home to catch up on things you’ve been neglecting but a real one; where you actually packed a bag or two and left town. Just the idea of not having to wake up early and grind through his daily routine had Dean humming in excitement.
Omega was near. Castiel was close by, and he had to find his love right
“This is where I will be starting next week. You should give them a call and see if they have any openings. Its across town and its a large clinic that’s actually part of St.Michael’s hospital. It has a diverse staff and its quite honestly a nice place and the people are actually decent.” Balthazar went on as he gave Castiel one of the business cards from one of the physicians on the board.
“I’m sorry, okay!? I’ve never seen shifters. Every pack has heard of the Winchester bloodline but it's a different thing seeing it. I meant no disrespect or harm. I swear. Hell I’ll pledge to your Head Alpha or Head Omega if I have to, I am not a threat,” Meg rounded on her, and while Charlie had seen her fair share of Alpha troublemakers, there was something vulnerable about her. She smelled genuinely apologetic, which surprised Charlie.
“Why is that the only thing that fucking matters to you!?” Now it was Dean losing his temper. He was too fucking tired and the whole Head Omega business had always annoyed him. “You are my fiancee! You are my Head Omega! That's it! Nothing has to change!” he growled out.
Ever so slowly, Jimmy sat up. Accompanying his thundering headache was now a piercing high-pitched sound that brought tears to his eyes as he covered his ears with his hands. It was deafening and threatened to blow his ear drums, yet he
It had happened when he had been visiting Rufus at his clinic. There had been a young couple in love, and the woman was a few months along with their first child. Absently, Jimmy had hugged his arms around his waist as a piercing sensation of barrenness seized him. Desolation reigned in his mind as tears swelled in his eyes, and he couldn’t look away from the young mother-to-be. Meg had asked him if he was alright. He hadn’t even realized that he had spoken out loud, and she replied to him that it was alright that he didn’t remember,that they would figure it out.
Most of the pack believed he and Castiel were romantically together and that Lily was his… While technically they only belonged to Dean on paper, most believe the rumors, and that they’d gotten together behind Bela’s back. As wrong as it perhaps was, Dean was going to take advantage of the confusion to slip out of a ‘meet’ he didn’t care for.
“Now, may I know my Alpha’s name?” Castiel added. A mischievous glint in the depth of those blue eyes made Dean feel at ease, and elated that his Omega was of a beautiful nature.
was no human. He was something Meg had been taught to fear her entire life:a Cecaelia.
Dean felt completely numb at her words. He was powerless to do nothing but nod and agree with her because this was what it was, the deed was done. And despite this painful situation with the woman he had loved for the last five years, in the depth of his heart he felt no guilt for saving Castiel and the pup, he felt right with that decision and so did his wolf.
“Thank you.” Dean smiled despite himself as movement at the far end of the tent caught his eye, and he chastised himself for not having paid attention, too lost in the swirl of comfort this Omega ‘Castiel’ radiated that he had forgotten about the Alpha scent from earlier.
The steam house made Dean smirk; Castiel had circled it, meaning they would be trying it. Dean didn’t really know how to even say no to his partner.
No. Dean hated the stench of the dying. He hated when he would notice the forms of children left in the ashes that his flames dealt out. He was scared of death- not his own, but the ones he cared about, like his brother kin Sam. Yet war had always been what he was made for; what he had been raised and hatched from his shell for. He had never even fathomed some other kind of life for himself. He was a warrior and a hunter, a Dragon. Blood and fire.
Benny sank down next to him and took a sip of his flask, and then shook it as he smirked at him. “Water. Cutting back on the alcohol. I ain’t that young no more,” he explained in a huffed laugh.
chance to give me the seven I will name. If you do not willingly turn them over to me, you will give me no reason to honor and spare any of you from my fury,” he warned, as the Merfolk had already started to distance themselves from Zachariah. “Naomi, Hester, Gordon, Anael, Ruby, Alistair and Zachariah.”
The Merfolk would be electing new Elders. Charles would stay on, while Gabriel had been suggested by others in the colony who stated that his bravery in volunteering to witness the executions merited him a strong mind. They were looking for two others.
"He's right. I am Dean, a Dragon. They will come for me until King Azazel is dealt with. If not them, then the King’s own goons," Dean stated as he studied ‘Crowley’, who watched him just as curiously. However, he was quite obviously guarded. Dean found that he, too, expelled a hint of magic close to that of Castiel’s.
Everything in him knew he should turn away as
Sam bit his bottom lip. “It’s why we are heading to my clinic…. Dean what are you gonna tell Bela?”
Castiel knew she was right and he had to change things, he had to build back the trust Dean had once had in him if he hoped for any kind of relationship with him and their pup… he couldn’t continue like this… he had to get himself together and prove himself.
“I’ll be right back,” she excused herself, and went to find Dean and Benny in the kitchen.
“Omega Novak will do no such thing. She is his daughter as well and deserves to be in her life.” Charlie countered only for Bela’s hazel eyes to gleam with challenge.
“Hey Dean, I— Dean?” Sam and Bela walked into the office, completely unaware of Dean’s sadness until both of their noses wrinkled at the horrible stench of distressed Alpha.
“Don’t. Don’t even, Jo. This? This mean, vindictive shit is childish. This jealously over Cas and Jack is a waste of time and energy. We got divorced and I moved on and I hoped you could too. I wanted, hell still would like, is for us to be friends, Jo. Go find someone that will make you happy like you should be. This bitterness… it’s going to consume you. You are a beautiful, strong Omega, and any Alpha or Beta would be lucky to have you look their way-”
Castiel watched his husband disappear down the hall. A ball of emotions threatened to choke him as he watched Dean pull away from him and this…this was the most terrifying thing he had ever witnessed. Dean hadn't raged, yelled or barked like all the other times Castiel had put work before his family. No this time, sadness and sheer pain had radiated off his husband and Castiel had been too shocked and frozen to do anything about it except watch his Alpha retreat and walk away.
War. Revenge. No matter how calm Dean was trying to keep himself, he was Cecaelia, and as a warrior, the rage always danced just under the surface of his skin. Even with their Cecaelian Sorceress’s glamour magic, he had a hard time keeping his true form from taking over when he was annoyed enough. Castiel had tempered that part of him, the part that made him the sea monster he was and thrived on. Castiel tamed his fighting beast into a mere nurse shark with those soulful blue eyes, and that smile that made all of Dean’s tentacles vibrate with sheer adoration.
Balthazar was the medical receptionist for the clinic. Also an Omega and a vivacious one who  could get Castiel to blush at some of the outlandish things the English man teased him about. He was incredibly efficient with a neat and straight forward hand script and a no nonsense aura about him that patients either loved or hated.
“Hi, you must be Castiel. I’m Jody.”
“Dean! We have a problem!” Benny barked as he opened the door.
The Omega sat up as he cradled the pup as she yawned and nuzzled into his chest. He was a bit conflicted about his feelings… He was grateful to Dean, more than he could ever say, yet this growing fondness for the Alpha scared him, if he was being honest with himself. There was just something about Dean Winchester that pulled him in and he wasn’t naive enough to believe it was the bond. He had been fully mated to Adam and their connection… His attraction to him hadn’t been anything like the way he felt about Dean. Whenever he thought about the heated dream he had about the Alpha, he blushed heavily.
When the plane finally landed, Dean took a deep breath. He hated flying. The circumstances he was coming back to were a shit show, making him wish this was all nothing but a horrific nightmare and he would wake up and everything would be sunshine and rainbows. Being the Head Alpha of a massive pack had serious challenges and at times situations were vexing at best, yet there was nothing worse than the possible onslaught of hurt feelings and angry scents from the people he cared about most.
Rowena smirked as her power simmered beneath her vibrant crimson tentacles.
Exhaustion had apparently seeped into his bones at the moment, and for the first time in years, Dean was dreading going home. The house Benny mentioned was Dean’s place, a big house the Alpha had built to be a central spot for all pack members and a way to welcome newcomers. It was even situated at the center of pack territory. It allowed all members, new or old, to be near their Head Alpha if they felt the need. It also helped any new members to assimilate and learn about their new pack and figure out where and how they can contribute.
Sam hummed a laugh. “You know what I mean. She’s been amazing while you were gone, making sure the funeral pyre would be ready for tomorrow and pushing everything for the wedding to a later ‘unknown’ date… the claiming, the Head Omega title… she’s waited five years for this and now…”
“Because of the pyre tonight. With the whole pack in attendance, having Castiel stand there with my bite and no collar will stir the rumor mill and will dishonor him.” Dean knew in his bones this was true. An Omega with a claiming bite on their neck couldn’t be at important pack gatherings without their Alpha’s collars. It dishonored them and was viewed as an insult to the Alpha.
Dean quickly took it and Pam leaned over to look at the contents.
The idea of having his own family, his own child had always been something Castiel had secretly entertained in the depths of his heart and yet impossibly terrified that he would become just like his mother, mated and married to a brutish Alpha that only cared about appearances and wealth, not caring the suffering he caused his children and spouse to obtain it.
Dean brought Lily up to sniff her diapered behind and made a face as he brought her to the changing table. “You made a tiny stinky,” Dean whispered as he went through the motions of discarding the dirty diaper, cleaning her thoroughly yet gently, and putting a new fresh diaper on her. “There! How about we get you the bottle mommy made for you and see about getting you back to sleep, hmm?” Lily smiled and gurgled while he whispered at her. She seemed endlessly fascinated by him, and it amused Dean to no end.
Dean growled against his neck as he started to nuzzle and suck bruises onto the soft skin near the Merman’s gills. Castiel moaned, making his tail whip up sand as the Cecaelia’s tentacles started their assault of his scales and skin. The Merman buried his webbed fingers into his lover’s short hairs, and pulled him up for a needy,filthy kiss.
“Dean,” Castiel called out as he hurried towards the man. The Alpha smiled tiredly at his love and opened his arms for his Omega and son. Castiel buried his face in Dean’s neck, scenting him greedily as his emotions swirled with relief as he felt his husband’s strong arms around him and a kiss to his own neck.
Meg stayed near and just watched, still in disbelief that her friend was apparently involved with a Cecaelia.
“Okay, so you brought him here?”
“Don’t worry Dean, we are very happy,” Castiel assured him as Lily reached for his nose. “We are gonna go have some lunch, aren’t we my pretty girl?” Castiel continued cooing at his precious pup as he walked out of the office.
Rufus sighed as he sat down on the rolling metal stool and regarded the young man with a concerned frown. “I wish I could help you, son. When you washed up on the beach…” Rufus rubbed his right hand over his face and sighed. He looked into the confused wide sky blue eyes of the young man he had grown to care for as his own son. Jimmy had been unconscious and unresponsive. He had been covered in an array of angry wounds all over him in a way that Rufus, in all of his thirty five years as a medical professional, had never seen. Being the main doctor of the small seaside fishing town for most of those three decades, he had seen many fishing accidents, and some had been devastatingly deadly no matter his best efforts. However, this case with Jimmy...there was so much more to his story, and everything in the old weathered man knew it in his very bones. “Nothing else ever washes up that could help us help you figure out anything about your past. This amnesia of yours, well, maybe you are the one blocking the memories out. I don’t know, but if all it does is cause you these piercing migraines, it might be best if you focused on your life now and your future.”
“I’ve never seen anyone have that reaction to Alpha Winchester before, usually everyone is just drooling over him.” Kevin started only for Jody to tap him on the head to hush.
“Yes, Alphas, Betas and Omegas and Alpha Singer runs a no bullshit and equality type of ship. His second in command is Omega Jody Mills. And she is much scarier then he is.” Balthazar mused which made Castiel smirk. “Look, if you want your family back like I know you do, leaving this clinic is the first major step. You don’t have to follow me to the Singer Clinic, but you need to get out of this one.”
However, he wouldn’t take the blame for things that were out of his control. "Enough, Jo. Why is everything about you? Because none of this is about or towards you"
“Dean, Naomi informed us that Castiel was here—” Pam started, only for the Beta to cut her off.
“Oh Dean, I don’t want anything,” Castiel replied. He felt a bit flushed, and wanted to blame it on his hot tea and not because of how close Dean was, how those mesmerizing emerald eyes were looking at him filled with things Castiel was terrified he was imagining.
“Now this is an unexpected surprise. I am Ishim, Head Alpha of the Styne Pack. This is Alpha Bartholomew, my second-in-command, and this is Alpha Virgil, my security expert.” The short grey haired Alpha whose scent made Dean’s hackles rise introduced with an all too confident smirk. However, there was a much more prominent scent that filled the room almost to a suffocating capacity, and he wondered why—or rather how—the three Alphas weren’t reacting to it. The room reeked of terrified Omega and it was painfully obvious it was coming from Castiel.
Castiel’s eyes went wide. That was a responsibility that Castiel couldn't even begin to understand nor undertake. His upbringing was nothing like this pack’s, and he knew that the title rightfully belonged to Dean’s fiancee Bela. “I’m not the Head Omega, I can’t be. I’m just a widower with a pup on the way that Dean is taking in because I am carrying his blood, nothing more,” Castiel asserted clearly as a fear settled inside of him. He didn’t want to be in the public eye and he didn’t want his new pack members to hold disdain towards him because of circumstances they didn’t know or understand. He wanted to serve Dean of course, he was his Alpha now, but not in a way that would dishonor him or bring him distress and drama.
“Thanks. So Cas, have you decided on a name for the little lady?” Dean asked as he leaned against the door frame.
Admittedly, the Omega found himself feeling a bit of envy as well. Castiel leaned against the open sliding door as he drank his iced tea, and his mind wandered to daydreams he knew he shouldn’t have, and yet… Dean was such a wonderful Alpha… an amazing hands-on father. Castiel wanted for nothing, and yet his treacherous heart and mind teased him with erotic images of Dean… It certainly didn’t help that the Alpha wandered around shirtless in the summertime, or wore those form fitting henleys… Perhaps Castiel’s heat was coming up and it was messing with his mind… He hadn’t had a heat since he had Lily, and Jody told him it’d be hit-or-miss if he would have one in the first year after giving birth… His heats had always been quite mild anyway…
“Well, it depends on who you ask. Some refer to our ancestors as followers of a goddess. Others think of us as earth creatures such as nymphs, since our gifts, our magic, mainly comes from our sacred tree.”
The shower felt like heaven. It was steaming hot, pounding out the tension of the incredibly long day from his aching muscles. Dean was pretty sure it was close to three o’clock in the morning, so he took his time lathering up the loofah and went through his ritual. He lingered once he was done, hands against the tiles as the water cascaded down his shoulders and back and he hung his head forward. His wolf calmed, having felt antsy the last few hours and he just wanted to feel clean before he face-planted into his memory foam mattress.
Castiel’s eyes opened wide, golden and bright as he unleashed a piercing roar. His canines elongated as his body contracted and shivered all at once as he felt indescribable sudden power coursed through him as he moved to roll away from Michael.
Sam was doing his best to keep up with his brother, wanting to be ready for anything as Dean looked practically delirious, following his senses blindly, scaring some of the local folks.
“Yup. Come on Cas.” Charlie was already by his side before Dean had even uttered the words. The redhead smiled at him knowingly, a glint in her eyes, and Castiel felt nauseous. They silently made their way to Castiel’s bedroom and once inside, he just wanted the floor to swallow him, what the hell was wrong with him!?
“I was told her eyes wouldn’t take on their permanent color for a few weeks,” the Alpha hummed, and Castiel found himself unable to look away from her. She was breathtaking, so small and yet the biggest part of his life. He buried his nose in her thin hair and breathed in her intoxicating scent, and his wolf howled in sheer joy of having their little one alive and well in his arms. His future was snuggled tightly against him, and the man that would father her sat next to him radiating content pride.
“Glad I missed whatever has you looking like that, brotha.” Benny’s voice made Dean look up as the burly Alpha walked in with a watermelon in hand, making Dean arch a brow at him.
Dean turned a corner and spotted a woman that was helping a slight man on the sidewalk. Time stood still for the Cecaelia Alpha as the man turned and set two confused and pain-filled sky blue eyes on him, and everything clicked for Dean.
Jimmy took it carefully and started to watch. There was a caption at the bottom of the video that was stating what Benny had just said, and as the video continued, he could see something happening where the octopus’ aquarium was. Jimmy’s eyes went wide. He watched as the octopus effortlessly escaped its confinement and made it across the floor, slipped into the tank where the fish had been starting to disappear, and collected himself a few snacks. He would then rush back down and across the floor into his tank just as the security guard wandered in. The caption at the bottom explained that the extremely clever octopus had memorized the guards’ schedules, and proceeded to get himself a snack every night. Jimmy laughed as he handed the phone back to Benny.
Dean was always looking out for him.
The brothers of course checked in here and there with the ex-angel, mostly about hunts yet simple ‘how are yous’ and ‘we should drop bys’ where part of every other phone call or text but before Dean knew it, a year had already gone by.
“I’m guessing big bad Alpha is still at the council meeting,” Pam said as she checked her phone in case Crowley had summoned her.
“Hey. Rufus told me you had a pretty bad one this time.” She sat next to him and caressed his hair.
Dean’s kind, Dragons, were rare, and yet the very few Kings and Queens that could have them in their midst controlled and ruled with the power and strength they brought with them. Dean and Sam had hatched together. They had been magically fueled with shifting abilities, which ensured that they were able to hide in plain sight as ‘humans’, while their true enormous, monstrous forms stayed protected.
“Perfect. How was the council meeting?”
“Alpha! We demand an explanation!” one person called as another stood.
“What’s wrong with him? What do I do?” Dean pleaded with his brother for help.
Castiel nodded sadly as he remembered Adam telling him he loved him… “I loved your brother, just not how he deserved. He was my best friend and I would never trade him for anything… I’ll never let Lily grow up without knowing her sire was a good and loving Alpha…”
“It’s always work work work. You have no idea how much this fucking hurts me. Hell, I’m pretty sure that me and our
The twinge of restlessness pulled at him once more, and Castiel realized it was coming from Dean. He made his way towards the large bay window of his bedroom, which faced the northern side of the backyard and was surrounded by a grand forest. He could feel Dean was in this direction and tried to focus on it, only for his unborn pup to suddenly move wildly, causing him to gasp.
Garth came to pick up Cas and within days, Dean and Sam had quickly heard through the grapevine that Cas had indeed become the ‘new’ Bobby; quickly and effectively integrating himself into the hunter community.
“Dean, I hope you believe me when I tell you this. You are not merely a war weapon. You may have been created for that purpose, but you are good, and you have the ability to build instead of destroy,” Castiel said as he looked Dean directly in the eyes. A warmth, like a hug, wrapped itself around Dean, and his beast suddenly wanted to spread his wings wide and roar into the skies that this delicate, yet powerful Healer- perhaps truly a tree nymph -believed in him. In the mere days that they had known each other, the Healer had shown him nothing but kindness and friendship without demanding anything from him.
, instinctively, that  it was some kind of call.
Castiel took a moment to think, and then he frowned. “Dean, were you always praised and rewarded only after you brought blood and fire to those that stood against your King?” Dean nodded. “Never for something…you’ve never used your gifts to build instead of destroy?”
“Thank you, Jack.” The child beamed, and ran away after he handed him the note from the bird.
Years ago, Meg had helped him look through what was called the missing ads, but they had never found anything or anyone that pertained to him in any way. Jimmy looked out over the water, the ocean calm and serene as a storm of confusion exploded inside of him. Why couldn’t he remember?
Dean took a moment to compose himself as he waited and held his breath. The beast, or whatever was out there, didn't seem to want to get inside, at least for now, and Dean had to use his reprieve wisely. He was still dressed in the drenched clothes, and he knew he had to get out of them and get them dry or he’d be in trouble. He looked around and found the tiny brick fireplace and quickly cleaned it out. He also found chopped wood next to it, ready for use, and started the fire, thankful his father had insisted on putting him in Boy Scouts when he was a kid. He quickly undressed to his boxers and set two chairs in front of the fire to start drying his clothes. He yanked the dusty blanket from the makeshift bed, and sat at the table as his mind raced.
“Alpha Winchester has also filed for sole custody of five year old Ellie Winchester. You can make it easy on everyone and sign over your rights-”
Fifteen minutes later, Castiel was pulling into his driveway. Dean had gone all out of the decorations, four carved pumpkins were lit and in the ends of the three small steps of their porch, their gleeful and shocked faces made Castiel smile. There was a massive spider web made of orange and black lights that took the hole front of the garage door with a giant spider with googly eyes perched in its center. The windows and the whole roof on the second story of their humble house was lit up in orange lights and a large bat was hanging from the center of the house’s peak. There was a graveyard in the front yard with tombstones that moved and haunted screams sounded whenever someone passed it on the sidewalk.
Tomorrow his new life would start, but for now he would sleep, feeling safe. With a heavy heart, he mentally told Adam that he and the pup—their daughter—would be okay, and he would make sure to be the best mama and make him proud.
“Nooooo!” Michael cried as he rushed Dean, a small blade glinting in his hands. Surprised yelps came from the crowd, and Bela screamed, horrified. Michael’s cowardice only served to enrage Dean more, and he caught the desperate man by the neck and snapped it in one swift movement. A nauseating silence followed as the knife fell from Michael’s limp grasp before Dean released him. The body dropped, its dead-weight thumping on the green grass in the remaining rays of the setting sun. None of this gave Dean pleasure. It only made him feel grief. This had been senseless and the man hadn’t even fought with pride, instead he’d brought a weapon. Dean felt numb and out of sorts at ending his life. The wrath that had awakened at the prospect of a real fight had turned into disdain and he still felt… twisted with disappointment. Dean paced irritably while Jody and Jo checked on Michael, pronouncing him and calling the coroner's office to transport the body.
When Dean saw his husband’s car parked in the driveway, he was actually surprised and wasn’t sure what to expect. His Omega standing in the kitchen cooking in his pajamas wasn’t it, but he didn’t fight the smile that graced his face. Cas looked beautiful, freshly showered, soft grey pajamas and one of Dean’s plain white t-shirts. He missed him.
“Didn’t have to, there were four of their members and four of us. Had to do so right there in the hospital room,” Dean shared as he closed his eyes. His skin felt itchy and his wolf was pacing and growling like something was wrong. Dean had a feeling it had to do with Castiel; the Omega was in the other SUV and Dean was pretty sure he wasn’t feeling all that relaxed. New land, new pack, no friends must be quite stressful for the new mama-to-be.
“I love him,” Castiel whispered out loud as he sat on the edge of his bed and looked out the window at the star-studded night sky. He focused on the brightest of the stars and felt himself unravel, feeling his late mate’s energy in his heart as he spoke. “I’ve tried to deny it to myself… to my heart… to
With Dean’s approval, Bela had opened her own practice, acting as Head Omega for the pack members that found it easier to go to her instead of Dean. Castiel had quickly realized many feared him, only not for the same reasons members in Castiel old pack feared Ishim. They feared Dean because he could and would shift, because Dean was always direct in his opinions, and wasn’t always as diplomatic as Bela could be. Castiel thought they were both incredibly mature for how they had handled their separation and the end of their relationship, coming together as friends and continuing to work together for the good of the pack. He was very much in awe of both of them.
“T-thank you. I’m Castiel,” he murmured in the tightness of her hug.
The Alpha swayed a bit in place as Lily slept on. He was barefoot and in just his jeans, and Castiel was in love with the sheer domesticity of the Alpha holding his tiny pup. The Alpha radiated contentment, protection and safety, and Castiel was filled with overwhelming gratitude for the handsome man before him.
The door opened then and Ishim stepped inside, looking smug and yet undoubtedly annoyed as he stepped into the room. “The doctors are waiting.”
“Right,” Dean said tightly as he sat on the chair facing their bed.
~|~|~|~ indicates memories/flashbacks
“No… I don’t believe there will be one. Alpha Ishim should be with him now,” she replied.
“There’s a lot of evil around this cabin. Unexplained shit. People gone missing, or coming out of the woods screaming about a monster. It’s just crazy. Not the place for anyone’s car to break down,” the trucker went on, as they came to a stop by Dean’s Impala. “Alright, let’s get this beauty of a car back on the road. Where were you headed?”
“I hate you,” Castiel grumbled, as his lips trembled while he let Dean pick him up.
Now he spoke to Ellie almost every day and sometimes, it was her or rather Dean calling him because she wanted to talk to him and Castiel cherished every second. There had been a few instances where Ellie was upset with Dean and would seek his cell phone to call Castiel to grumpily vent to him and they were the most endearing calls to Castiel. They were always over small things, like ‘Daddy wouldn’t let me have a cookie because dinner was in twenty minutes’ or ‘Daddy would let me go to bed without a bath… I hate bath time mama’. Every call filled Castiel with love and added strength on his journey, on his path to getting his family back.With every day that his relationship with his daughter became stronger.
“Castiel, this shouldn’t take very long; it's more of a courtesy meeting to make sure the final outline of the divorce agreement is what everyone wants.” Charlotte informed him as he needed. She had told him on many occasions to simply call her ‘Charlie’ yet Castiel couldn’t seem to do so, as if by becoming more familiar with his lawyer it would make this nightmare all the more real.
Castiel followed, sitting on the back porch in the shade to watch the two wolves play. He took out his cell phone just as Pamela appeared with Charlie, who was carrying a pitcher of pink lemonade.
Gabriel would never forget the day the sentry had returned with Castiel.
was growling at him…Castiel’s eyes opened wide in shock.
Dean growled as he took in a deep breath. Sam how no idea how mating season felt when you were mated to an Omega. It was a primal need to  copulate, breed, and quite honestly, for the Alphas to ravish their Omegas, cherish them, and give them pleasure while hoping their mate would catch and lay their eggs.
“Right, well for one, that place is filled with people you seriously need to reconsider being around Cas. It’s not healthy.” Anna growled at him as she excused herself to let him get read as his eyes focused back on the documents glaring at him, twisting the knife in his heart as it sank in that the divorce was indeed done and Dean was no longer his husband.
Dean turned a hard glare to Charlie, who was still watching with Pamela nearby. “Why was he alone? Especially during this bullshit?” He was tired and short tempered. Castiel was Charlie’s responsibility and with the shit show that had just happened, it made him feel all the more protective over the very pregnant Omega.
“Yeah…” Dean stood and rolled his head to crack his neck as he moved towards his dresser to get pajama pants.
“Cas, sweetheart, what's happening?” Dean was frantic as Castiel’s body started to seize.
When Dean’s eyes returned to focus upon Castiel, he found the Omega gazing at him with fondness and curiosity. “I’m sorry, I don’t mean to stare,” Castiel voiced as he blushed and looked away. The Alpha found himself smirking. The Omega blushing was completely endearing. “I, um, I know you must have been through quite an ordeal. Your scars…some fresh…the cuffs. You don’t have to speak of them if you don’t wish to. Just know you can tell me anything. May I just ask if you are indeed a rogue? Your wolf doesn’t seem to be in rage.”
Dean slipped into the quiet house. The last two weeks had kept him incredibly busy. Lily’s birth had bought a bubbling happiness that spread throughout most of the pack. However, Dean had spent most of his time being briefed on all the rampant rumors. Somehow, despite everything Dean stood for, despite his long relationship with his (now ex) Bela, many believed that Lily was in fact his daughter. That Dean was in her sire. Rumors that Castiel was Dean's secret Omega for years under everyone's noses, the most popular rumor being that he had been obligated to bring Castiel into the fold only once he had pupped. Dean had tried to set the record straight. He had repeated and growled and barked, but in the end it was futile. No one wanted to hear the actual truth, people loved scandal and apparently this was one that they latched onto. Dean was always the topic of gossip, no matter what he did or didn't do.
“Hey, just me. Here you go,” the Alpha announced as he came in holding a steaming bowl of soup and a bottle of aspirin. He came around the bed to where Castiel was sitting and placed everything on the night table before kneeling down to be level with Castiel. He looked at his Omega carefully. “Okay, so that’s chicken noodle soup and some meds for your fever. Make sure you eat it all, take two pills and get some sleep. I’ll take care of Lily, don’t worry,” he advised with a smile.
“He doesn’t care about the title, Bel. I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t mind you stepping up to help handle situations you’re familiar with. We are all working to make the pack thrive. There's no issue here. We all just fit.” Dean assured her as he started to walk again.
was and he shot up out of his seat and started to collect his things in a hurry.
Dean smiled at him as he moved out of the room. "Shhhh, we don’t wanna wake her up," he whispered as they moved back towards the kitchen, only for the Alpha to turn back around and study him for a moment. "Can I ask you something?" he asked in a still hushed tone.
They stayed silent for a moment, and Dean found himself observing the Healer as he seemed to fidget in place. He was quite a beautiful human, with his dark hair and light skin. Those eyes…they held a flicker of magic in them, and it was making the Dragon increasingly more curious.
He had taken solace in knowing
“Cas, let me help you,” Dean growled out, his voice deep and rough in his Werewolf form.
“Do you know the story of the Omega Mermaid and the Alpha Cecaelia? The story of the horrible war last centennial,” the old Cecaelia asked as the eel curled in her tentacles, keeping its beady eyes trained on Castiel.
Sam didn’t understand. His brother wasn’t mated, and didn’t know how it had felt to have his heart ripped out of his chest when he found their nest destroyed and the remains that were left behind. Just knowing Castiel was alive was all he needed to make his decision to come to shore and brave the human world to find him.
The history between the Cecaelia clan and that of the Merfolk clans had been a disastrous one.  War had raged between them over lies, forbidden love, and murder. Many lives had been lost over the years. The Merfolk had nearly been eradicated, having no chance against the warrior-monsters of the ocean, the Cecaelia. Hundreds had perished, and the Merfolk had been split into  two clans, the northern and the western kin.
A breath of fresh air was what it was supposed to be. A new start as cliché as that sounded. A new life, a new reason to
“Better?”
Jack Winchester was just seven months old and her own daughter Claire was obviously quite close to him. The ache in Jo’s chest just felt like pure devastation. She felt betrayed.
Dean watched them leave, his calculating eyes never wavering from the threat, and his wolf roared, wanting to jump out and chase the petite brunette until she was gone. He felt a gentle hand on his back, and all the pent up fury inside of him seemed to evaporate with that single touch from Castiel… He instantly felt calm and a warmth surged through him. As he turned to look down at the pretty Omega and those beautiful blue eyes gazed up at him, he realized the happy feeling was coming from Castiel through the bond. Dean couldn’t help the dopey side-smile that graced his face as Castiel smiled up at him.
“Is that the reason you took me in? Despite the threat I clearly pose to your Keep, wherever this is, you wanted to study me while not knowing quite what I was?” Dean asked, a bit amused with the Healer.
“Shh, you’re safe,” a soft voice assured him, as gentle hands ushered him to lay back into the comfortable plush pillows.
He waited as his heart’s thundering beats seemed to be the only sound in the frozen stillness of the evening. The Omega’s sky blue eyes wandered around the well weathered estate. There were remnants of what appeared to have once been a beautiful garden in the front of the round curved stone driveway. Everything else was covered in a thick white blanket of snow.
, he told himself.  But everything in him refused. The need to talk to him, now that he saw him again after so long, was all consuming. Seconds ticked by as the man who cleansed him came closer. Strong, sure steps as he gazed about the many goods available from the farmers.
As Head Alpha, Dean had to visit each home that was hosting in the two-week courting phase. Sometimes there were instant matches and it was easy to do the blessing along with the visiting pack’s Head Alpha. Other times, while the couple courting was very much a match, there would be someone in the family with an objection, despite having volunteered. The biggest issue Dean had come across was when the person that was intended to meet their mate was passed over for and a younger family member met their mate instead…
Anna had left him to go back to her own place after Castiel had officially started at the Singer Clinic. He had been there for the better part of a month and liked his colleagues and there was a familiar ease to working with Balthazar still. There was laughter and warm scents and positive energy in the much bigger clinic and Castiel finally started to feel good about his chosen path for turning his life around.
Dean couldn’t remember what he did after his run, how he showered, dressed for the funeral and now stood in the kitchen, zoned out with his mind slowed into sloth mode. His mouth felt like he swallowed cotton, his whole body was numb, and he felt cold despite being dressed warmly in his dark jeans, black boots and a charcoal plaid shirt over a black tee. He held a mug of lukewarm coffee and tried to pull himself together.
This… this was a huge moment and yet it felt tainted by the circumstances. Dean swallowed the sadness he felt. He never truly gave this moment much thought until a few months ago, and somehow he felt a heaviness within his heart. This was meant to be a joyous moment. As he took the first collar in his hand and felt its softness, he looked up to see Castiel’s blue eyes were watching him with almost a childlike wonder. His awed gaze made the Alpha forget the turmoil, if only for a moment, and the happy, gentle scent of the pregnant Omega reached his nose.
The presidential studio was meticulously thought out with privacy in mind. It boasted  an infinity pool, views of white sanded beaches and bright coral reefs, indoor hot tub, twenty-four-hour butler, and a world class spa that relied on Mayan herbal wisdom.
“When? How? Who?” Castiel had too many questions. They rarely ever spoke of Balthazar’s life outside of work and he had a strong feeling it was because of their co-workers.
"Thank you Dean… I don’t know where we would be if…" Castiel’s emotions were running high and a lump formed in his throat… he was so grateful and
Castiel loved tending to the eggs. They were beautiful, so many different colors and textures,and the blue Omega had loved cradling them and singing to them. Castiel had a beautiful melodic voice. Many Merfolk loved it as well, and would come near the creche to enjoy listening to  him sing to the little ones in their shells.
“Yes, he will be just fine,” They both looked on as the three females continued to argue.
Castiel looked up at his Alpha and sure enough, Dean wore a red and white baseball cap, blue jeans with a blue vest and with green gloves looking very much like the character Ash. He laughed a bit as his husband was always willing and ready to dress up in any get up their daughter asked for. It filled him with love for his Alpha and guilt nipped at him. He hated when they fought and it hurt how much the distance between them seemed to only grow in the last few years. He hated it.
She looked back at him and wrinkled her nose as the slight scent of jasmine hit her. It was nauseating that the scent of ‘Happy Alpha’ followed, and she couldn’t stay in bed any longer. As Bela stood, Dean rolled towards her side and buried his face in between their pillows. She took her robe from the chair and walked to the door to head downstairs.
The ‘yes Alpha’ placated Dean’s wolf in a way that surprised him. He had heard that from pretty much every single one of his pack members, yet hearing it from Castiel seemed to calm the agitation he had been feeling moments ago in the car. Dean tried not to think too much about it as Sam came to stand next to him.
Castiel released the breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding and hurried down the hall towards his office to collect his things.
Suddenly the lights went out and the security alarms sounded as the emergency lights came on, giving the room a red glow. The guards turned towards them, seeing if either of them had done anything.
“I’m sorry about Adam…” The Alpha had no idea how to even go about this. This had not been what he was expecting when he came to collect Adam’s body… He had hoped to meet with Castiel and speak with him about Adam, hug him and offer him comfort and to not lose touch as family members, and then be on his way home to bury his brother. Yet, what the universe had thrown at him was an Omega and child of his blood that desperately needed him, and Dean couldn’t walk away from that. It would be going against every part of his being. Castiel was family and Dean wouldn’t leave him behind.
had tried to rip him apart. He had no recollection.
“He’s not a lab rat, Hess!”
“I’m Bela.”
As he came closer to the shore, Dean took a moment to rub himself into the sand dunes that started to rise towards the beaches. He buried himself and stretched his limbs, his tentacles trembling with need for it. The magic confined his true form, and it was extremely uncomfortable when he neared the hundredth hour. He wiggled around in the sand, loving how the rough grains rubbed and took care of any itches and polished his garnet-red tentacles.
Castiel pressed on, the darkness of some of the estates’ many corners only serving to fuel his curiosity as he started then another tall hall that was dimly lit. He found closets full of linens and towels. As he continued on, he found a washing room that he hadn't ever seen before as a large basin stood below an intricate mirror. He smirked and continued on and finally he turned into a large room and smiled. He had found the kitchen.
There was also the fact that their ace in the hole was now human. Hell, Dean still had a hard time wrapping his brain around the fact that the ‘Angel of the Lord’ was now without grace by choice and living his life as a mere mortal.
He couldn’t stop his own feet as they started to carry him towards those blue eyes. Couldn’t stop himself from trying to smell his aftershave as he moved closer and his own heart stopped as those empirical blue eyes looked up at him.
“Daylight.” Dean was ready to go get his baby brother and bring him home.
The office they stopped at was warm and inviting as Dr. Mills sat behind her desk and Castiel took a seat in front of her.
Sam frowned. “The one Adam’s mate is from?” Dean nodded as he voiced it.
“Alright, well we could start with Benny Lafitte.” The female Omega voiced as he looked over towards the burly Alpha a few rows away from them. “He’s a huge teddy bear and Dean’s best friend since they were pups. They are basically brothers without the same bloodline. Benny’s family is mainly of Cajun descent and have been close to the Winchester family for a very long time. Benny’s and Dean’s grandmothers were long-time friends, so it wasn’t a surprise when the two boys met, barely out of diapers, became the best of friends.”
“Ah! When was the last time you went to ONE of Ellie’s soccer games? Practice? Or what about the singing recital she was in last month?”
Just days ago, Castiel’s father had cornered him in the bedroom he still shared with his sisters and Castiel had tried desperately not to crumble into tears.
Day 49: There’s something in the woods…
The consistent sounds of beeping and distant voices lured Castiel from sleep, and he frowned as he resisted. He wanted to fall back to sleep, feeling physically exhausted and his limbs felt heavy and wrung out. He took in a deep breath and was met with the distinctive smell of scent neutralizers and disinfectant… He frowned once more, confused but still refusing to open his eyes.
The sounding horns abruptly stopped,as if they had been taken from the Sentries sounding them. Sheer dread and panic swirled among the Merfolk as they all remained motionless ,their gazes held fast to the west. The mere moments of silence felt as if an eon passed. No one dared to move or speak.
“Fairy lights?” Castiel questioned softly, as he left his fingers trace over his lover’s bare chest.
Dean frowned at him as his emerald gaze turned intense.
That made Dean stop and turned back to face her, just in time to see Benny hiding a grin behind his hand as he turned away again to give them ‘privacy’ for all it was worth. Dean rubbed the back of his neck and licked his lips. “Yeah, thanks Bel.”
“No? But lying to the girls is? I’m not gonna pretend that everything has been easy since the divorce but I’ve always been honest, with you and with them,” Dean gruffed out as he made sure to keep his tone gentle and scent calm as Jack started to doze against him.
Dean laughed, overjoyed with this new turn of events, and promptly shifted himself. Castiel yelped, not expecting the Alpha to do so as Lily barked and danced eagerly.
. The Elders had been frantic for the past few moons, and wouldn’t say much to the Merfolk colony. Something had happened with Hester. Their Sorceress was heard shrieking and screaming moons ago, followed by some kind of shock wave that had rippled through the whole of the community and had woken up many with confused and worried kin. When some had asked the other Elders what had happened, they were all met with tight lips and subtle excuses about Hester not feeling well.
An idea came to him and he smiled, Dean wouldn’t let anything ruin their vacation.
“Dean?” The Alpha opened his eyes to Pam standing before him with a gentle smile. She patted him on the arm and looked him straight in the eyes. “What’s your heart saying?” She whispered between them.
Meg glared at the blonde Omega who continued to ignore her. She snarled at him and then exited without a word. Balthazar sighed and locked the door behind her which made Castiel frown at his actions.
“Meg, get out.  I need to go over his schedule with him.” Balthazar stated with ease as he looked over the files in his hands, dismissing her as if she was just an annoying fly on the wall.
Castiel, among many, had never been told the names or any kind of details beyond the monster Cecaelia taking an unwilling Omega Mermaid away from her intended. Tears swam in the blue Merman’s eyes. So many had suffered because of Zachariah. It went back so far. It was a  war that had occurred over his bruised ego and the rejection of an intended mate that never felt the same; that had never wanted him, but had simply wanted to have a life with the Alpha she had loved, and an innocent Cecaelia Alpha whose mother, after all this time, still mourned him and hurt for him throughout her long life.
Over the following weeks, Dean was around more and more often, they formed a reliable and comfortable routine, and Castiel couldn’t be happier. They would take turns waking up to Lily’s wails at night, and Dean never shied away from diaper changes or bath times. He would even take her on outings with him to give Castiel some alone time.
“Until we can know for sure he isn’t a danger-”
Castiel groaned and felt completely stupid for his reaction and Kevin’s words only reminded him that yes, Dean was infuriatingly handsome.
Meg smiled softly at her wife. “Castiel is Merfolk,his mate is Cecaelia.”
Gabriel remembered how some time later the dolphins had returned, and told him they had taken Castiel to shore quite a distance away and that humans had found him, but that was all they could supply. Gabriel was still grateful.
“It’s-it’s beautiful Dean, it’s perfect…” The Omega gasped and smiled at the Alpha before he walked inside.
“I love it. Thank you again, so much.” Castiel truly did and he kept his gaze on the Alpha as he left. Pamela winked at him as she moved to follow the duo, which left Castiel alone with Charlie.
Bela was the first to kneel and bared her throat. Benny quickly followed suit, keeping his eyes down, and Crowley held onto the sofa chair and managed to make it to one knee as he too cast his eyes downward.
“I feel good. Thank you for breakfast.” There was such a lovely energy about her, and Charlie’s strawberries and basil scent put him at ease and made him feel uplifted. Or perhaps it was just her bubbly personality, but either way he was thankful for it.
The elder brother turned around and glared at his brother. “I’m not having this conversation again, Sam,” Dean growled out as he continued on north.
“Thank you Dean,” Castiel turned and waddled back into the house.
“He’s an ass. You wouldn't think he’s the oldest with how playful he is,” Cain said as he dusted himself off.
Castiel hummed to himself as he started to make spaghetti with the leftover meat sauce Dean had made and frozen. The tranquility of cooking and the ease of motion that his body moved with ease about their kitchen and it hit him just how much he missed doing this simple act of making dinner for his family…He stood a bit shocked at the sentiment that cursed through him when he heard the front door opened followed by Ellie’s happy squeals as she spoke to Dean.
Jimmy found himself waking up in tears and screaming for Dean, and his body pulsed with its desperation. He wiped his face and sighed. He was losing his mind. He didn’t know how his body remembered a past his mind couldn’t, or wouldn't, allow him to recollect, and he felt divided and scared.
“I… Your wolf is beautiful,” Castiel whispered and felt himself blush when Dean laughed.
The brothers had divested themselves of  their human possessions, stuffed them into the waterproof sack Sam had found on the shore, and dove into the serene cool ocean waters to find a proper sand dune in which to sleep. They swam to the edges of the beach banks, where the sand dunes tipped down and into the depths of the ocean. They found a decent, safe coral reef, and Dean embedded himself into the sand. He narrowed his eyes, settled into a comfortable tangle of his limbs, and let the current soothe and lull him to drift and engage his tentacles to rapidly change color and twitch as he snoozed.
“He killed my son. Killed him because his intended fell in love with him,” she voiced weakly, as her moray eel swirled carefully among her weak tentacles, helping her to navigate.
“They’re gold,” Michael whispered, and then spun around as the yells of Dr. Hess echoed. Members of the MoL were trying to subdue her from shooting at anyone, while Zachariah stood by looking ill and uncertain.
Castiel looked back at Dean and his pup, and his heart swelled. Lily was sitting on the blanket, giving Dean a blinding, beaming smile as the Alpha put more sunscreen on her, which made her laugh. Lily was quite ticklish and there was nothing more beautiful than his pup’s joyous laughter.
Dean grinned and looked up at his brother over his laptop. “Yeah, I’m sure. It doesn’t exactly change much, since the pack believes I’m her father no matter what, so this will just legalize it.”
“Dean what the hell are you talking about? Spit it out already.”
After mating season, Dean had to leave his Omega to go on a hunting expedition. It was the custom for Cecaelia Alphas to bring back food for their mates to gorge on, especially if their Omegas had caught during mating. Castiel had smiled at him and told him to bring him back salmon and his favorite, shrimp.
“Don’t you dare say my name!”
Castiel walked into the house, flanked by both Charlie and Pamela as the trio laughed and talked, bringing their shopping bags in and making their way to the living room.
“Hi, sorry we’re late,” Castiel apologized as Lily looked at everyone in the room with wide eyes. Her tiny face started to crumble into an upset little shrivel and her bottom lip quivered, threatening to let out a wail.
Castiel stayed rooted to the spot as he heard the Alpha go up the steps. He pressed his hand over his cheek where seconds ago Dean’s lips had been.
Castiel nodded as he watched the brothers hug and turned his eyes downward and caressed his stomach. There were many Alphas around now, and the multiple dominant scents started to make him feel a bit uneasy, if not down right queasy.
“Still the same,” he confessed. It was draining, knowing nothing of his past.  Especially when he would get feverish for two months out of the year with no explanation as to why. His stomach would twist into knots, and he felt restless and stir crazy, as if he were craving something, and he couldn’t figure out what it was. He had discussed it, or as much of it as he could explain with the gruff doctor, but there had been no diagnosis, only a prescription for a strong sleep aid to help him sleep through the toughest times. Apparently, only he and his closest friend in town, Meg, suffered from this mysterious illness.
Castiel placed his hand over Dean’s on his cheek. “I love you, all of you, and I need to see, feel, and sense all of you. Your savage side is part of you. I want to see you destroy the ones who took our babies.” Tears filled Castiel’s eyes as he spoke. “You are Cecaelia, a Warrior, a monster, a ferocious and wrathful creature, and most importantly, you are my mate. My Alpha as I am your Omega. Take me with you.”
The blue-eyed Omega was all too aware of what that meant as he reached up with his good hand to touch his neck. It felt naked and wrong to have his neck bare. “Dean’s collar,” Castiel provided. He missed the one he had worn proudly as Adam’s mate. The Elders had wasted no time in removing it from his throat when his late husband had perished.
Castiel tried his best not to blush as those mesmerizing green eyes bore into him. “Yes Alpha.” He couldn’t hide how happy it made him, yet he still truly didn’t want to be an inconvenience to the Alpha.
“Brotha, look at me. I’ve known you a long time, and that happy Alpha shit you got going on is even more potent than when you and Bela were together. It's obvious that blue-eyed Omega is in awe of you, just give him a hint you’re into him as much as he’s into you. I don’t know how long I can’t deal with all the staring you two are doing… it's uncomfortable, man.”
“Oh sweetheart, none of that,” Dean teased as he came around his desk to scoop the pup from Castiel’s arms. Lily immediately hid herself in Dean’s neck and peered over his shoulder to look at her mama. Castiel smiled and cooed at her, and the pup calmed down quickly.
“I said one day. I honestly think you’d get along. Plus, Jack is the most adorable pup. He’s a good mix of Claire and Emma in temperament.” Dean added as he looked at his pup, tiny fist clutched in his hospital gown.
Castiel smiled at him and yeah, Dean loved to see it: his nose wrinkled and his baby blue eyes shined. Seeing that smile was like a healing, soothing glow to the Alpha. “It shows Dean; your pack loves you very much.”
A sudden pulsing thwop radiated, followed by keening whistles. Jimmy and Meg looked at each other with wide eyes, and hurried to witness the world’s wonder.
Jimmy sat in the sand next to his house. He had decided to make a small fire pit as he watched the sun set over the water. He grabbed his favorite blanket and made himself comfortable as the evening air started to cool around him, and the fire’s flames swayed in the light breeze.
Castiel knew he was right, every word felt like a physical slap that he needed in order to wake the hell up. His pining and sadness wouldn’t cease until he put into action what he most desperately wanted and he needed to prove himself but not only to Dean and Ellie but to himself.
Dean sighed. Benny sat to his right quietly, looking out the window to give them a false sense of privacy, but Dean knew the Alpha would jump in if he felt the need.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I want them back.” He whispered against her shoulder and his Anna pushed him gently to look him in the eye.
Dean clenched his jaw and nodded. He did know, but that didn’t change the fact that he wouldn’t make one damn move unless Castiel did first. “I know, I just… it's up to Castiel.” He left it at that as he started towards home, Sam and Benny close behind.
“I’m gonna need some Johnnie Walker Blue for this shit, ain’t I?” the grumbling doctor guessed as he, too, was still trying to piece together what he had seen. Then again, it hadn’t been the first octopus man he had ever seen.
Castiel was helped into the small private plane, grateful that from the moment they left the hospital, the Omega Pamela had stayed by his side. He had no clothes with him, nothing from his life here with his home pack, all because of traditions he had known and feared since he was a pup. Once Adam had died and Castiel was officially deemed a used and unwanted Omega, any ‘riches,’ anything personal he and his late mate had, were taken by the Elders. When Alpha Ishim had personally cut Adam’s collar from around Castiel’s neck, it felt as if ice had been poured over him. It had been such a final moment for the Omega, his heart had practically stopped. Having his collar removed in such a dismissive way instead of simply unclasping it… Castiel had hoped to keep it with him even though he wouldn’t be allowed to wear it any longer. Castiel had no idea what they did with his things, but had been reminded that he was no longer a beneficial pack member and was now merely a servant, and lowly Omegas didn’t need belongings. That had been before Dean had arrived.
“You should make sure he’s comfortable. He won't be going anywhere for quite some time. You should be grateful that I’m letting you see him at all,” Dr. Hess informed them, and turned on her heels. Two hunters loyal to her stood guard at the door.
“Dean? You all right,” Sam asked.
Castiel froze. His eyes were comically wide if the way Pam started to laugh was any indication. He found himself looking over towards the others and Crowley was smiling, his eyes still closed but close enough he heard their conversation. Automatically Castiel’s hand flew to his fresh claiming bite and he suddenly felt hot and nauseous. Dean had bit him, claimed him, he was the first one… And if Castiel had to guess how the others felt about it—or rather how they felt about Bela—they either believed she would be as understanding and forgiving as Castiel was wholeheartedly praying she’d be, or they simply didn’t care for her. He had no intention of being caught between two lovers, or of causing any problems for Dean, who had very clearly risked his own happiness to save Cas and his pup.
Meg, Rufus and the Harvelles had been key in helping him rehabilitate himself. He hadn’t even known how to walk or how to eat, Cars scared him and television, computers or any type of technology left him perplexed. He felt that the phrase  ‘fish out of water’ applied to him. Rufus had voiced it once and had explained it meant that it felt like he didn’t belong, that he didn’t ‘fit’, and that was exactly how Jimmy still felt after so many years. The years  had passed in the blink of an eye, too quickly for him to process, and perhaps that was why he felt so much more afraid now.
Dean having a stroke just after they just made love terrified Castiel. The Alpha was just fine now, yes, but Castiel would never forget this very real fear of losing Dean.
Dean fixed the earmuffs over his ears, which were already red from the cold. “Yeah, the guide said it's a small town in Krasnoyarsk Krai. It’s across a river, Chul-something…” He grumbled as Pam moved passed him towards the car. The whole airway was covered in a white blanket of snow. Dean couldn’t remember ever being this damn cold.
Castiel slowly started to wander about the lower floors, truly searching for the kitchen but not minding one bit being able to explore on his own. He knew this wasn’t wise, if not frowned upon and most certainly improper behavior for an Omega, yet Castiel couldn’t help himself. His wolf had started to slightly stir as his feet stepped on the main floor and his curiosity had all but doubled.
“I take it the spell worked well,” she asked both Sam and Dean as she made alluring movements with her tentacles while keeping her gaze on Sam.
“Heya, Jim.”
“Yeah, I’m guessing the Styne Pack didn’t bother with those? Or maybe they called it something else. Hosting is when a pack invites families from neighboring packs in the hopes that they will meet, mate and marry, which unites the packs and ensures peace between them. Most of the time it's for protection, land or profit of some kind,” Dean explained. “So make sure you wear your collar and please don’t go anywhere without someone you trust. There will be Alphas, and we don’t know much about this small pack. I don’t want anything to go wrong.”
Dean wanted to avoid a war, he wasn’t here to anger anyone, but in truth, he wasn’t about to ‘host’ strange Omegas or Alphas in his house when he wasn’t the least bit interested. However, he did have houses in his pack that would be open to meeting outside Omegas and Alphas for possible unions.
Yet on some nights, it would only be him and Dean and he cherished those times most. Dean always asked about the baby, made sure he was eating plenty and staying off his feet, and just seemed to be content and relaxed around him. Being able to get his Alpha to just sit and be tranquil, have a beer and put his feet up while smiling and looking as if he had no worries, made Castiel feel like the best Omega. There was an ease between them, they didn’t need to speak. The tension in Dean’s shoulder eased when he looked at him, and his cocky smile let him know everything was okay. It was endearing and Castiel had grown to love their friendship.
“Kevin!”
“Hey, look, I get that you have reservations about your feelings for Dean, whatever they might be, but—”
He had a sudden and strong pull to be home; to see Ellie in her costume and his husband too. He hated the way they were around each other. Dean was withdrawn from him, anger and sadness tickling just below the surface of his bergamot and mint scent and it made Castiel’s body ache that he had no idea how to fix it. Things had been tense for some time and he wasn’t sure if things would get better or if this was his new normal. He did not want to be walking on eggshells around the man he loved. Dean wasn’t openly hostile at all, but cordial and quiet which just made Castiel feel worse.
“Daa!” Jack piped up gaining loving smiles from his parents as Dean moved to take him from his mama.
these Merfolk, and I will take pleasure in it and in avenging our little ones,” the Cecaelia started, as he frowned and looked at his beautiful mate with a soft and adoring gaze. “I don’t want to scare you. I couldn’t bear it if you were suddenly repulsed by me or terrified of me.”
Both times he had been on heavy scent blockers, and he hated it. It frustrated his wolf to no end and the sex tended to be a bit more aggressive because he couldn’t fucking smell a damn thing. It hadn’t helped that Bela had insisted on being taken from behind. He loved the position but he knew she didn’t, and for her to suggest it, well… Dean could admit it to himself that it broke his heart quite a bit. Bela, for all her sass, was a loving and at times old fashion Omega, and if there was one thing in their relationship that had always been amazing—whether they were making love or having angry make up sex—was that she always insisted on positions that they could see each other and kiss. Now? Now Dean felt like he had slept with a one night stand that had regretted taking him home the minute he walked in.
“Hey there… I’m sorry, didn’t mean to spook you… And of course you’re the Winchester Omega… Just my luck,” she muttered as Castiel took another step back. There was something about this Alpha he didn’t completely feel at ease with.
“What is he after?” Dean asked far too calmly, which only made Bela step away from him and Benny stand up straight, knowing that tone and look in the Head Alpha’s eyes.
The Dragon frowned. “No.” He clenched his jaw as he studied the Healer.
“Please don’t Cassie. Just listen to me. I’m leaving this job and I think you should too.”
“Da! Aaaa,” Lily was telling him and yeah, Dean was completely wrapped around her tiny finger. He kissed her forehead and the pup giggled and kept playing with her binky as he turned back to the people in attendance. Crowey was already speaking with Asmodeus’ pack lawyer, outlining which houses would host who. Dean stifled a yawn, just wanting to go home, when Lily gave a wide yawn of her own, and looked a bit dazed which made him laugh.
“Cas, take a breath. It was one of Bela’s extremely loyal followers… It was bound to happen eventually, and sadly it did. Dean… Dean took care of it,” She said quietly as she looked at the floor.
“D-Dean...” Both the Cecaelia and Meg broke eye contact and looked down at Cas. He was mumbling and whining as he started to thrash about. Dean held him tighter.
Time slowed somehow as the screams from his fellow members and his brother sounded around him. The Werewolves’ snarls and growls mixed into the fray as the ground shook beneath him, and the grey sky drowned Castiel as the rain drops started to fall faster. He blinked rapidly with the need to keep his eyes open as the pain in his leg simmered down to a slight throbbing reminder as his stomach turned into knots and twisted. His hands ached, and his feet tingled as his body continued to tremble. Castiel closed his eyes as his head pounded in pain, and his jaw felt numb. A sliver of desperation filled him, and fear swirled about him as he felt lost, with no control over his limbs as he laid limp in his brother's arms.
“Well, I think we should celebrate!” Dean beamed as he tickled Lily into mumbling spit bubbles that made Castiel smile brightly.
. Hopeful of a new purpose, a new sense of self… it proved much harder than he had ever anticipated… being
Rowena came intimately close to Sam who appeared quite receptive to her advances. Castiel looked back at Dean, who smiled knowingly at him, while Mary seemed irritated at the pair’s flirting.
“You as well, Sam. Dean speaks very highly of you,” Castiel smiled.
Bela closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She wasn’t being fair and she knew it, yet everything in her told her that no matter how much they tried, how much she tried, nothing was going to be the same, everything had changed despite both of their best efforts. “I’m just… I don’t see this working Dean… No matter how much we try, you claimed Castiel and that changed everything… I can’t help but feel overlooked… He’s been a threat to my wolf since he arrived, and yes I
Charlie had been adamant that none of it—the situations or the decisions—were his fault and he agreed with her, he knew all of that, but it didn’t stop the feelings. Needing his Alpha to be happy was instinctual as an Omega, and even his human side wanted Dean to be happy… especially after everything he had sacrificed for Castiel and his pup, when he barely knew them beyond a handful of conversations over the years.
“Do you remember anything about this lover,” Meg inquired, after some time.
Meg finally lowered her gaze when everyone could hear Dean’s rumbling growl, warning her of her missteps. “My apologies Alpha Winchester, I meant no disrespect. Your Omega is an exotic beauty and I lost my manners.”
The female Alpha raised her hands in a peaceful gesture before she stepped back down the porch steps. “Sorry about that, lovely. I just saw you standing here and couldn’t resist wanting to meet such a beauty. I’m Meg.”
we will construct a very specific mission to destroy those responsible. Zachariah will meet his demise, fret not. Any other Merfolk directly involved with the slaughter of Dean’s offspring--” Rowena started, as Bobby interrupted her.
Crowley cleared his throat. “Well, he has the necessary four members backing him up to be taken seriously by the Elders. He’s contesting your role as Head Alpha, because you haven’t claimed Bela, who is viewed as Head Omega, and you’ve ‘replaced’ her with an unworthy Omega. He’s claiming that you are not fit to continue leading. In short, he wants to do this barbaric dance with you to get Bela and be Head Alpha,” Crowley finished as he rolled his eyes.
“It's a small town and many Omegas will be quite overjoyed to hear the dashing Alpha Winchester is back on the market.”
The strong scent of Omegas in heat was swirling in the waters. Castiel, Rowena and Mary, who was behind John with two of their tentacles intertwined, were all flushed, and seemed a bit dazed during the interval. It caused all five Alphas present to be a bit aggressive, yet they each held themselves back. Dean was vibrating in place while Castiel caressed his arm to soothe him.
Cecaelia…
“I can’t say I’ve even seen these three love someone so much,” Cain told him as he watched the three biggest horses surround the small Omega protectively. It was quite a sight.
“Oh shit!”
Dean sighed and closed his eyes in irritation. He knew damn well how long he had been searching, refusing to give up on finding his mate. He
“How?”
Dean licked his lips, his frustration high and he just felt exhausted. He was tired of this song and dance. He couldn’t even remember the last time they had kissed and the longing that twisted inside him only added to the hurt. He knew Castiel had always been on some kind of mission to prove himself to the Alpha dominant world and he had always admired, encouraged and even pushed him during his hardest times in med school and when he had been trying to get his foot in the door of the medical field.  Dean had never thought that once Castiel did make it and started his long fought for career, that the collateral damage would result in it being him and their precious pup being shoved to the side for his Omega’s pride and need to be a doctor. Maybe he was the one that was selfish but what the fuck was he supposed to think and feel when their five year old asked him time and time again ‘where’s mama?’ ‘why isn’t mama here?’ ‘Does mama not love me anymore’... gods that last one.. Ellie had been asking that one a lot lately and every time that question left those tiny lips it completely gutted him.
“So I believe this is goodbye,” Meg voiced quietly.
“All of this is wrong, I will never allow this to happen. It's an innocent child! The pup has Winchester blood, my blood! Castiel doesn’t deserve this!” Dean growled out in a hushed whisper as Benny looked him dead in the eye to try and calm him.
got closer.
Dean picked up his discarded cell phone, amazed to find it still with some battery life. It vibrated in his hand, and his eyebrows shot up as he saw the multiple missed calls and texts glaring up at him. However, what made the hairs on his arms rise was the time and date his phone announced. If he believed it, it meant he had missed days and not mere hours in that cabin...
Dean sighed deeply in his sleep as she pulled her hand away. Fresh tears gathered in her eyes as she watched him. She knew in her heart that Dean hadn’t made his choices lightly or to hurt her… Yet a part of her was furious with him. She felt as though he hadn’t thought about her—about
Day 53: I haven’t slept, there’s noises…not normal…
As Dean laid down to start to go to sleep as Alfie continued tending to his back, the Alpha moved his hand, expecting the telltale pull of the chain to restrain him, and he frowned when it never pulled back. He lifted himself up and looked over at the chain attached to his left cuff only to find it loose. The Alphas that had brought him back into his cell after the whipping had either not bothered or forgot to clasp it to the bolt in the stone floor.
“There’s nothing wrong with me wanting a career. Plenty of Omegas have careers and families.” Castiel countered angrily as the Alpha looked at him completely unimpressed with a smirk on her face.
Dean huffed in surprise at having the Omega hug him, but he wrapped his arms around him and laughed as Castiel looked up at him through his tears. “I’m glad you like it.”
Jimmy rubbed his face. This had been one of the most confusing flashbacks. However, the
“She gets that from Dean,” Castiel said, his mouth having a mind of its own before he caught himself. Alarmed, he looked up at his two friends. “I-I mean—”
He turned on the lump of a mattress and felt something beneath the poor excuse of a pillow. Dean flipped over the pillow and found a book. He sat up and picked it up, and once he uncovered it, he realized he was looking at some sort of journal.
“No!”
As soon as Dean saw her, he stood and looked behind her. “Everything okay?”
the Head Omega, nothing has changed,” Dean growled out, and some of them started trying to argue, but ceased once Dean lifted his hand for silence. “Castiel is none of your concern—” Dean pointed a finger at Anna who wanted to argue, and the redhead Omega was quieted by Dean’s glare. “—he belongs to me in name and bite only. You do not need to know details. My devotion to Bela has not changed, we only added to our household in order to save two lives. There will be no further discussion about this, am I clear?”
that filled the massive Werewolf fighting the monster.
The shout was loud and clear in Castiel’s mind, and it resounded through the whole of him as he sat in shock. Dean’s voice… he had heard it inside of his head, and he could feel its urgency and the underlying
He slipped on the socks that Charlie had left for him and in a sleepy haze, slowly shuffled his way out of the bedroom and moved down the hall to the kitchen. He managed to find the lights above the stove, not wanting to turn on the large lights, and he waddled towards the massive refrigerator. As he peered into the fridge, he found a jar of pickles in the door and on the second shelf, an assortment of pudding. Castiel grabbed a chocolate pudding and the pickles before he carefully made his way to the island counter. He left the refrigerator’s door open to help illuminate the space as he began to eat his treats.
“Hello, Dean.”
The events of what happened when he had reached Duke Winchester's estate days earlier replayed in his mind.
“Hey.” Castiel looked up, finding Dean was crouched down to be eye level with him, and he couldn’t keep the small smile from his face. His wolf was relieved to have their Alpha near.
Lately, images of the man’s lips had started to journey into much more sensual territory, and Jimmy was astonished  at the feeling it would evoke in him. Those lips and that mouth would be on his, in a searing kiss that left him trembling and gasping for more.
Bela was beaming and yeah, this all felt good. Dean was feeling better than he had in days, and this new turn of events was great. Now all Dean wanted was to get home himself.
Of course, Dean being the Alpha he was, he had attempted to escape, many times over, and no matter how many beatings or death fights the Head Omega Abaddon made him go through, Dean was nothing if not a stubborn bastard. The fact that he was a rogue wolf did help in making others wary of him, and unless Abaddon ordered it, they would more or less leave him alone. Then one day, while he had been cleaning the pig pen, he was taken to be whipped again and in his next breath, Abaddon had secured a silver cuff around his neck and his wrists. They had been magically infused, etched with sigils that would make the cuffs impossible for Dean to break even with his brute strength. Abaddon had quickly and quite lividly figured out that her scent had no effect on Dean besides making him want to wrinkle his nose in disgust. She smelled evil, and he couldn’t take it. He had no idea how else to describe the stench. So the collar and the cuffs would make him submit…somewhat.
“I understand, and I promise. I love Dean, and I respect his nature. I know he will destroy the ones responsible, especially Zachariah. It’s true. He was the one to order my eggs to be slaughtered, he was the one to order my exile, and he stole my memories of Dean. He will pay for what he has done, to Asa and to us.” Castiel’s whole body was vibrating with a wrathful anger towards Zachariah, this evil merman who had destroyed the lives of others simply because they loved a Cecaelia instead of a Merfolk...instead of him. No, Castiel, too, wanted his revenge. It wasn’t in his nature to be so filled with rage, but he wouldn’t run from it. This was the Cecaelian way of justice, and Castiel was a Cecaelia’s mate. Therefore, Dean’s ways were now his.
Dean gently pulled Castiel up into a kiss and he decided to grind down, gaining a groan from his lover. They started to move together, Castiel rolled his hips down, meeting Dean’s movements. Dean’s hands grasped and groped at his ass, making Castiel moan and whine.
It was just after five o’clock when Castiel bid his last patient goodbye as he walked them to the front glass door of the clinic. Movement caught his eye and he watched as families with young children had started to trick or treat in the early evening light. He couldn’t hear their joy but he could see it. Kids of all ages pulled on their parents' hands as they laughed and giggled and  crossed the small neighborhood streets to make sure to hit every decorated house to get all the candy.
. Zachariah screamed and wailed. His voice boomed and echoed until Dean yanked his arms out of their sockets.
Dean still sat motionless as his eyes roamed over to the right wall of his office. It was decorated with family pictures that held pride and happiness in every captured moment. As his tear-filled green eyes landed upon Adam’s graduation picture, then his certification into DWB and then the wedding picture, Dean squeezed his eyes shut, more tears ran down his cheeks, while he rubbed at his face with his free hand. He regretted not attending his baby brother’s wedding; pack obligations kept him from being there at the time. He felt a heavy and deep exhaustion settle in his bones as he made himself open his eyes and study the wedding picture. Adam had told him at the time that it was fine, it was a small, modest wedding, and Adam had sent him this picture of himself and his mate, an Omega named Castiel that Dean had spoken to in their video chats a handful of times…
Charlie smiled and rubbed his back. “I’m just saying, you have these feelings for Dean, maybe it's time you let go of the past and start a future with the possibility of truly being Dean’s Omega, not just on paper and for pack politics.” She stood then as she grabbed his legs and flung them onto the bed so he was sitting back against his headboard. “You better eat that soup or you’ll just make him worry,” she added before she turned on her heels and left the bedroom. The door made a resounding ‘click’ behind her.
“Of course, we wouldn’t want him to be dishonored.” The sarcasm in Bela’s tone was barely contained through her clenched teeth. Dean wanted to calm her and tell her it was only for the funeral yet he couldn’t. He knew how hurt she was by this… She was the one that was supposed to be his one and only, the bearer of his claiming bite…
Dean had just fastened the cord around his waist when Castiel appeared at the door.
“Yeah, I can understand that. Lily shifted again, scared Castiel. The first time he hadn’t witnessed it you know? And when she shifted back, she was asleep for a while. The other day she was just on Castiel’s lap, and she was fidgeting and wouldn’t stay still, and then she shifted. Her poor mama barely had a minute to collect himself before she took off,” Dean told him and snickered as he remembered Castiel’s shocked and panicked expression before he ran after Lily.
“Alpha Ishim, this is Alpha Dean Winchester—” was all Dean heard Naomi announce as wide, scared and tear-filled blue eyes suddenly consumed him. The happy and shy Omega that Dean remembered from the handful of video chats was now gone. Castiel looked devastated and broken, which only made Dean’s inner Alpha whine, wanting to give him comfort. They were both mourning and Dean couldn’t even begin to imagine how the Omega was feeling. He looked too thin, with a cut near his upper lip and dark purple bruises that seemed to cover the right side of his neck and shoulder, while a cast covered the whole of his left arm.
“Well, then, it's good that Mating Season is upon us,” a new voice from behind Dean’s parents’ echoed, as a stunning, vibrantly colored Cecaelia came forth. Her tentacles were a bright byzantium, while her long flowing hair was a crab red. She exuded power. She turned and looked at Castiel and gave him a soft smile. “I’m Rowena. It is a pleasure to meet the Omega Mermaid that’s enchanted our best Warrior Hunter.”
Dean sat at the desk in his home office. He still held the phone in his left hand as he looked out over the polished wood of his desk, not actually seeing anything, fern green eyes blurred and unable to focus as he was consumed by the one-sided conversation he just had, leaving him shell-shocked. His heart suddenly felt as if it had stopped, and time had slowed to a standstill as the horrific and painful news he had just received repeated itself in his mind like a slow-motion recording that was distorted and grinding. Two silent tears slid down his cheeks as he still tried to understand what the hell he had just been told…
It ‘recycled’ money that was near it, meaning that when the brothers would need to ‘pay’ for whatever they needed, the box would materialize the exact amount needed by ‘borrowing’ whatever the humans near them had on their person. Once the transaction was completed, the spell would cause the money to return back to its rightful owner. Sam had found it brilliant, while Dean had simply nodded and didn’t care to understand further. He just wanted to get Castiel back.
“Why is he here? What did you do for him to have a stroke?” Jo demanded, acting as if she hadn’t heard a word Castiel had said.
“I um, I had to claim Castiel as one of my Omegas for me to bring him here,” he said carefully. Bela’s eyes went wide and her brows hit her hairline. “Because Castiel was a widower and pregnant, the Styne Pack was about to kill the pup, and if Castiel survived the operation, he would have been made a slave. The Styne Pack don’t believe Omegas can raise a pup on their own and no other Alpha would step in with him carrying another’s pup.” Dean sighed as Bela shot up and started to pace. “He is carrying a pup of my blood and this was the only way I could save them both.”
“You're welcome to anything Cas. You live here now,” Dean stated as he motioned towards the kitchen. “Get some rest, tomorrow we will get you some clothes and whatever else you need.” He smiled gently at the Omega, and his wolf felt content, easing some of his stress.
He found himself yawning as fatigue sunk into his bones. He wasn’t sure how much time had passed since he had last heard the creature outside, but it seemed his adrenaline rush had just dropped to needing sleep. He was hungry and could feel his stomach growling, yet he knew there wasn’t anything edible and in trust, he was suddenly just too damn sleepy. Slowly he rose and went over to his clothes to turn them over before he shuffled over to the mattress. Dean laid himself down and groaned. He missed his memory foam at home…where his adorable husband was. He missed Cas like a sharp pain, and he wasn’t sure what to think of the eerie situation he was in. He wondered if Sam was worried yet that he hadn’t arrived.
His punishments were harsh words and warning of a belting. While his sisters were treated with physical punishments and whenever Castiel had tried to intervene, the punishment would only be worse for the girls. So Castiel stopped, cried silently for them and in turn was shunned by them while their mother coddled him as Castiel tried to understand why. The older he and his sisters grew, the worse their lives became as their father would take his sisters without him, dressed them in clothes that cost months worse of mortgage and with every outing, every time Anna and Rachel returned home, Castiel would notice the slight changes in them. Some physical, such as their dresses weren't as pristine and they seemed slightly disheveled. Anyone else wouldn't notice but Castiel did. His sisters grew silent and withdrawn and as they changed, Castiel would often see bruises in the shapes of fingers upon them and any time he tried to speak with them to do anything, Anna and Rachel shoved him away.
He rubbed at his eyes and couldn’t believe what the hell he was seeing. “DEAN!!!” Castiel’s heart raced and he heard movement upstairs but he couldn’t tear his eyes away from… from what was in front of him, which he couldn’t completely grasp.
“I’m trying to make Lily a sweater,” Castiel said with a smile and showed Dean the poor excuse for a sweater. “I’m not very good,” he admitted as he laughed and Dean joined in. The would-be pup sweater was horrible.
Castiel nuzzled him now as he waited for Dean to wake up… that thought of being without him was a blinding fear that threatened to choke him. His wolf whined in desperation even though he had been told repeatedly since Dean had been out of surgery that the Alpha was going to be just fine, but he needed his husband to wake up and tell him himself, see those intense and vibrant green eyes aimed at him filled with adoration and love that always overwhelmed the Omega in the best of ways.
“Alpha Asmodeus, while I regrettably must decline my own meet, I do have proud houses that would love to host and perhaps meet possible mates. It would be a pleasure to have our packs unite as such.” Dean dreaded all the political lingo, but he would happily use it to avoid unwarranted wars being waged for the sake of wounded pride.
“I, um, I was also exiled from my clan- the southern clan, for falling in love with a human.” Meg solidified the truth for him as she looked back at Jo, who smiled at them. “I assumed it had been the same for you, until now,” Meg finished, as she looked at Dean. She then spotted the massive pink pearl in Castiel’s other hand, which he held tightly against his person. It was most likely his mating gift from Dean, which explained the fascination with all the tiny pink pearls he had managed to find.
Because of their friendship, Bela still to this day held Pamela’s presence as a threat at times, even after five years of Dean’s dedication to her. Pamela found it hilarious.
“You are in Winter Peak,” Castiel informed him, as his eyes landed on Dean’s left leg. He was completely captivated, as Dean’s body was fully reconstructing all of the damage. His tendons, muscles, veins, skin…everything was knitting itself together. It was a slow process because of the damage, but being able to see it happen was extremely wondrous.
the man had said, and Rufus had fainted when he saw the man dive back into the water with his tentacles.
Bela tore her eyes away from her ex and the pup to look at Castiel. “Dean and I weren’t meant to be. We’ve both accepted that, and we have a good friendship now. Despite how I’ve acted towards you in the past, all I’ve ever wanted was for Dean to be happy… I’ve known him for a long time, and I haven’t seen him this happy in quite a while. Lily has a loving Alpha and he will move mountains for her… But you need to know that Dean has one fault. He’s so busy taking care of others, he forgets to take care of himself,” Bela shared, voice gentle yet strong as she glanced back at the sound of Lily giggling wildly, followed by Dean’s own laugh.
Dean licked his lips. “I am a rogue, but I am not in rage. I haven’t succumbed to that yet.”
Lorraine studied him and looked over his body and tail, the attention leaving him a bit unnerved. “You are quite beautiful, much like Anna was. I suppose it is in the nature of Merfolk Omegas to be pretty and exotic.”
“Castiel. It’s nice to finally meet you. Alpha had spoken about you before.” He smiled and hoped his unease wasn’t too apparent. After everything Pamela had told him, he desperately wanted to get along with her, she was Alpha’s love and fiancee after all.
“Cas…” Anna’s tone was soft and filled with concern which only served to make fresh tears start anew in Castiel’s eyes. A hiccup left his lips and his older sister was rushing towards him and took him in her arms. Castiel held tightly to his sister as he cried against her shoulder.
“I see, well I suppose there is no harm in saying goodbye. As per our customs, Castiel is going to be placed with a new family once he is out of surgery,” Ishim voiced, his tone irritated and filled with barely hidden disdain as he looked down his nose at the battered Omega sitting on the bed.
The Omega watched as a crowd gathered at some kind of commotion that had occurred. An ambulance was just pulling away and Castiel saw Dean pacing in the yard, barefoot and shirtless, looking distraught and… he could feel his sadness.
Gabriel made his way towards the colony’s gathering circle. Many of the Merfolk had started to congregate there. Something in the water was inciting them all to rally. Something had been provoking the Alphas, mainly, and of course, Omegas followed. They were in the middle of Mating Season, and yet, no one was able to stay calm or in their coves to breed. There was too much of a stir among the Merfolk. There was a sense of unease since Hester’s screams, and it left the rest of the Merfolk on edge to understand. Illnesses were not a common occurrence, especially for a powerful Sorceress. The colony depended on her to keep them safe from threats, especially wandering humans that could get too close to their home.
“Who the hell are you?” Anna demanded.
Adam was dead, there was no changing that. It just felt wrong, like Dean had been robbed of the idea that he had time
Jo watched as her eldest daughter casually addressed whom she considered her nemesis as she handed him a pup no older than six months old…
Castiel’s eyebrows shot up. “He does? But I don’t see one…” The Omega looked around the small plane a bit confused.
with Hester.” Rowena gave an eerie and sinister smile at the mention. “You won’t have to worry about her.” All eyes turned to her as her eyes glowed amethyst and focused on Castiel. “When Dean found you, it set off her spell. The object of, or really, the reason for her spell’s success was in keeping you away from him and out of the sea. She tried to remove him from your mind, but couldn’t from your heart. She clearly hadn’t counted on him setting out to find you and bring you back here, where you belong with your Alpha. Once Dean found you and brought you back into the water, Mother Sea wasn’t going to let one of her most precious creatures suffer in her oceans.”
“No!” Michael screamed, as he tried to protect Castiel.
Upon his return, after three moon cycles, he had planned to bring Castiel to his elders. He had already announced his mating to them, and they had been welcoming and eager to meet and welcome the Omega that had captured the fierce warrior's heart. Yet when Dean had swam to their nest,he had found it in shambles. It had been destroyed. He had found the pearl on the ground, partially hidden by sand. In the upper cove he had built for any eggs they would have, he had found the crushed remains of two eggs. He had picked up the two biggest pieces of each and the pearl as he roared and cried while his heart broke. Fear had gripped him, not knowing what had happened and where his mate had gone or been taken to. There had been a fight, it was clear in the condition of the nest, and Dean had screamed in his confusion. Desperation and rage filled him at finding out what had happened to his family.
Another older male Cecaelia came forward, and awaited his turn in hugging the brothers.
Ever since, for the Merfolk, any and all interactions with the Cecaelia were forbidden. The Merfolk sentry were ordered to kill Cecaelia on sight No small feat since Cecaelia were aggressive and powerful creatures. They were considered just as dangerous and forbidden as humans. Any display of favoritism or careless disobedience would result in the Mermaid being exiled, if not killed, for treason.
“Call me Jody.”
“Do you know who the intended Alpha for the Omega was from your clan,” Dean asked. Charles looked around and then at his captive fellow Elders. Zachariah wouldn’t look at him.
He took a step back and looked at the room. He was finished renovating and it was fully stocked with all the pup things Castiel would need. Missouri had helped him and he just hoped Castiel would like it too.
to protect instead of being told to do so, and it was…liberating.
