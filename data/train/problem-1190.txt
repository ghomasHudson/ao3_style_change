As he passed, he saw out of the corner of his vision – he couldn’t help but notice – Sherlock was no longer splayed out on the sofa. Smirking to himself, he made for the shower, refusing to let his eye drift to Sherlock’s open bedroom door.
Side by side sleepily afterwards, Sherlock closed his eyes. ‘Oud and bergamot. Exactly right, as I knew it would be.’
‘Haven’t gotten round to questioning him yet, mind,’ the Inspector was saying, and John, in another in a series of dim realisations, looked up at a clock. It was twenty to nine.
‘How’s work?’ Harry asked shortly, in a tone full of accusation that he hadn’t asked first, since he’d been late, and was apparently meant to spend the rest of their time apologising in word and deed.
'Maybe,' he conceded. They needed to agree on something before she'd really consider what he needed to say. 'And you trust him, then, do you?'
‘To see the room where Neville St Clair’s clothes were left.’
, eventually, and then they could sort it all out. Until then they would work the case, as always.
‘And at the moment, I’m more interested in what the nice blokes in snobby opera capes like.’
Lazily shifting away from John, Sherlock insisted, ‘Your idea of a “day off” is to
to say the one thing he was fairly certain he could never articulate to the single person to whom he should honestly confess it. This is how he lived – he toyed with academic anomalies and traced suspects all over London and sat in his flat all day longing viscerally to touch a man who had been sitting, for the majority of their waking hours, less than two feet away.
Having hit upon a sensitive question, John waited (not looking at Sherlock) while Damery frowned guiltily. ‘I… I must ask you not to press that point, Dr. Watson. As I have described it, my client — my friend — is in a terrible situation, and I must rely on your sympathy to keep his or her identity private, though I have no doubt at all that you could discover it without much trouble.’
‘You?’ John prompted, innocuously, ‘Sorry, did you want something?’, eyes blown wide as he looked into Sherlock’s face with a maddening impersonation of patience, and
could not possibly equal 3. ‘His house is a former abbey, converted with modern amenities of course, but he put his desk where the
you seem to have interpreted.’
‘I was thinking about composing a blogpost about it.’
‘Go,’ Sherlock sighed, smirking just at the corners of his mouth, but pushing him playfully, and John smiled back, chest winging with hope, as he lumbered to his feet and off to bed.
Sherlock’s toes curled softly on the top of his foot. Thunder rolled. He slept.

spot to use for a vantage point,’ John muttered through his teeth.
‘John,’ began Sherlock, clearly moving towards demanding but no less desperate and red-hot and shrinking around the places John could feel him, inside and along his long gorgeous (horrifically scar-striped) back.
‘Oh,’ said Molly, observing (entirely superfluously) the obvious change, ‘I didn’t know you could drive.’ She buckled her seatbelt dutifully. ‘Did Mrs Hudson teach you?’
Ryder’s snuffled breath because more audible as he lifted his head, jacket rustling against Sherlock’s leather chair. ‘Wha–’
But I could swing whatever —’
‘You won’t be being me. You’ll be being yourself.’ His mouth swerved and he gave the half-smile he saved for moments he deemed he should aim for ‘reassuring’. ‘Well, yourself as a society misanthrope with a pornography addiction.’
“It is your life to gamble,” Death said a second time, and, satisfied, the girl left the window and returned to the hermit’s bedside.
“An awful lot of effort,” he says, “for such a small taste of nostalgia.”
“Why would you want a book of witch genealogy?”
The kitchen floor sags suddenly beneath the tree, sending them sliding through the mud. Sherlock heaves Joanna into his arms, one around her naked back and the other hooked under her legs. “The front door,” he says, staggering a little under her weight. “Where—”
Afterwards she’d wretched into a wastepaper basket, her gran watching with the dead bird’s body cradled in her gnarled hands. “Now you know your limits,” Gran had said, as if that had been the lesson all along.
“I want to never again suffer famine or drought. I want never to be hungry.” The girl leaned out the window and gave Death a grin not unlike his own. “I want the cornucopia.”
Joanna’s calm slips. “What do you want, Mycroft?”
Joanna keeps a wooden comb in the top drawer of her bedside table. She hears Sherlock reach for it, the creak of the drawer as it opens and closes, but she still tenses when he steps close and gathers her hair in his hands.
When she wakes, she will remember the dream in pieces – distorted images and sensations filtered through the breathless pain in her chest and the hammering of the heartbeat in her ears. She will remember her grandmother’s house, the wind rattling the windows and the slow drift of sand across wooden floors. The air dry, biting cold, and her gran crying softly into weakened, weathered hands, the pain turning her into a stranger.
Joanna grins. “That I won’t forget,” she says, and slaps her bloody palm into the long list of names carved on the underside of the table.
The hermit drank the tea, and when it was gone he slept again. The girl sat beside his bed and watched the sun sink below the trees. She lit a candle to keep away the dark, and it burned until sunrise.
Joanna’s shoulder is a knot of pain, and her leg is little better. She leans heavily against her cane and sighs. “Harry—”
Twenty years later, Joanna lies awake in her bed in Baker Street and remembers the heat of Alfred Boyle’s heart beating in the palm of her hand. Remembers the power she felt as it stopped.
The strange angles of his face are turned ghoulish by the harsh light of the lamps; for a moment Joanna thinks she must see what Donovan does when she looks at him – the psychopath, the alien. The freak.
“And if he dies?”
“I’ve got you,” she says. “Now
The witch of the wood laughed a terrible laugh. ‘Just so, just so,’ she said, and took a yellow wax candle from the deep pocket of her skirts. ‘The flame of this candle will cure any fever. I will trade it for a promise.’
Mrs Barrow sinks into the chair opposite Sherlock’s, her hands clutched in front of her and shaking. “She was going to leave. I couldn’t let her leave.” She looks at Joanna beseechingly. “He just wants to
“Classy.” She tugs the shirt off his shoulders, and it drops to the floor with a splat. She unbuckles his belt and pulls it free. “I thought you went out to hound Dimmock about General Shan’s autopsy.”
Mrs. Hudson sighs. “Joanna, love. You’re drunk.”
There’s a silence. “Where?” he says.
A circle of electric lamps stands around the edge, and the techs work under the unnatural glare of their light, uncovering the remains bone by delicate bone. Joanna counts six bodies, six sets of remains, each partially exposed by the crumbling earthen walls and floor. A camera flashes, and Sherlock looks up from his place bent over a small, skeletal arm. Judging by the size, the victim couldn’t have been more than seven years old.
The corner of Mycroft’s mouth lifts in a small, chilly smile. “On the contrary,” he says. “Several are first editions.”
“You’re ill,” Joanna says. “Let me—”
He leans in close, his eyes darting across her face. “Flushed skin, dilated pupils.” He presses two clinical fingers to the hollow of her throat. “Accelerated pulse.”
“I remember that when she was sick – when she was dying, and she lost three stone in as many months and the pain was so terrible she couldn’t eat or sleep or stand, I remember hating her for leaving me.” Joanna looks down at her lap. At the gentle tremor in her left hand. “The morning she died, I almost brought her back. I’d promised myself I never would, but she was gone and I needed her. I didn’t have anyone else.”
The smell rises from the sawdust, and Adrienne’s fingers go still on the keyboard. She slowly turns her head and looks down at the box, her eyes slightly wide. “This was in your flat.”
“I bet he has pamphlets,” Gran says. “I bet he visits all the little old ladies and tries to save their sweet little pensioner souls before they croak.”
the footsteps seem to say.
Joanna slumps down to the floor, kitchen cabinets cool against her back, and scoops up the satchel with one finger. It swings in the air, harmless and disarmed. An empty gun.
They’re closer now to her grandmother’s house than to Baker Street. Closer than she’s been in years.
“Because it was the easiest way to keep you out,” Gran says.
Harry raises her head. “There is,” she says. “There is something you can do.” She stands, setting the water glass on the bedside table with a clatter. “You can use Gran’s book.”
Blood wells red and stinging beneath the needle’s point, and as she pulls it free she turns her wrist and lets the first drops of her blood fall to the waiting earth.
“You’re nearsighted,” she says, oddly charmed by this unHolmesian weakness. “I never noticed.”
me—” There’s a rush of air as the hand draws back to slap again, and Joanna opens her eyes.
, she wants to say, but of course she almost did. She folds her arms across her stomach. “All magic requires sacrifice, of one kind or another. Unlike Moran, I prefer to risk my own life.”
“Shit,” Murray says at her back
Joanna sighs. “Mycroft, you know perfectly well that Sherlock and I—”
They sit in silence for the rest of the afternoon, and neither of them looks away.
She shrugs. The adrenaline has made her muscles feel lovely and loose; she could stare him down all day. “The postman’s never complained about it, no.”
She reaches into her trouser pocket and takes out the broken stick of white chalk she’d nicked from a drawer in Sherlock’s desk that morning. It’s been some time since she last wrote in chalk; it feels cool in her too-warm hand, sliding smooth between her fingers. She crouches in front of the storage unit lock and writes the first sigil. Chalk squeaks against steel.
“For this spell? Twenty-nine. One each year since I killed Peter.” He goes to reach into the breast pocket of his coat, and then hesitates. “I’ve prepared a list of names and burial locations, if you’ll allow me.”
The witch of the wood sat in a chair outside the door, waiting. She looked the widow up and down with her laughing black eyes and said, ‘No, you are much too old. Come back when you are younger, and I will bake you in my oven and eat you for my supper.’
The hermit lay awake, his clever eyes unclouded by fever. The girl touched her fingers to his forehead, to the echo of his heart’s beat at throat and wrist. He batted her hand away. “Girl,” he said, “you have not slept.”
“Excuse me,” Joanna says through gritted teeth, her face hot with embarrassment. “I have to get my flatmate upstairs so I can break the rest of his ribs. Goodnight.”
The fight lasts for hours.
,” he reads. “
Joanna sits back against seat, wrists pinned tight between her back and the leather. “What about the boy? Carl Powers. Was that a proper drowning?”
The rich man’s son soon recovered, though he limped on the bitten leg for the rest of his long life. When his father died he inherited his great fortune and his grand house in the middle of the town. The rich man and his wife lived there happily for many long years, until the day the rich man’s wife woke to see Death standing at the foot of their bed.
“Penny and I did have a falling out in the years before she died,” the woman tells Sherlock, genuine regret in her voice. “I can hardly blame her for thinking I was a danger, what with the way I acted after Peter was taken. I said some horrible things, and threatened to do quite a bit worse.” She reaches out suddenly and seizes Joanna’s hand, her skin as soft and dry as tissue paper. “You did find my boy, didn’t you? You did find Peter’s body in the pit?”
“We’ve had worse fights.”
At night Joanna leaves her sleeping self behind and walks the empty halls of Morland Park.
He drops into a crouch beside her. It must have started to rain; his hair is damp, and he smells like wet earth. There’s a smudge of dirt on his chin. “You’re not serious.”
The first page is a recipe for a simple dark wheat bread. Gran taps it with one thin finger, and Joanna frowns. “Bread?”
Joanna wakes in the middle of the night to see a boy at her bedroom window.
The man called Moran reaches up and touches the shell of his ear. He lowers his hand, showing her the dots of blood on his fingertips. “I see you don’t share your father’s fondness for Eliot.”
“Prude.”
There’s only one chair. Sherlock sits at the round table in the centre of the room, his head bent over the open book.
She laughs, wiping the sting of chlorine from her eyes. “When I tackled you and fractured two of your ribs, you mean.”
“He’s not here for you,” Moriarty says, low and suddenly vicious. “It isn’t
When Joanna asks what she talks about, Harry pretends not to hear the question.
Sherlock pushes her head down like he’s a copper ducking a criminal into the back of a police car, and it’s enough to start her giggling again. Magic crawls under her skin like red ants, like bubbles in a shattered champagne glass; she hardly notices when Sherlock slides into the back seat with her, crouching low to fit.
—” as Joanna makes two more neat stitches with the black thread of her housedress. “Joanna,” she says, “Joanna, that voice—”
Sherlock shifts forward in his seat. “Mycroft?”
“I appreciate your honesty,” Joanna says, and dumps the cup of water into Sherlock’s lap.
. The classics are classics for a reason, you know.”
“He cares,” Mrs Hudson says. She smoothes the quilt at the foot of the bed, tugging it tight at the corners. “And it would do him good to see her, even as she is, but I don’t intend to waste my breath bullying him into it.” She stands back, inspecting her work. “This room needs flowers.”
Sherlock’s smile is empty and perfectly horrible. “Good evening, Sally. In your usual high spirits, I see.”
“I’d still like to see them. Your ankles too, if you don’t mind.”
“Joanna, I need you to answer me.” His voice sounds even, perfectly controlled. She thinks about reaching up and touching the beating pulse beneath the bruised skin of his throat.
“Turn around, and then look back at the car.”
she thinks,
“Not particularly.” He turns his attention to the little brick house in front of them, and the crowd of police officers blocking the open door. His eyes narrow, taking in the scene. To Joanna, it looks like an aggressively normal little street lined with aggressively normal little houses. She wonders what Sherlock sees. “You do realise,” he says, “that I neither want nor need you to defend me.”
, Joanna reads at the top of the page. Beneath that, in the same young, stiff hand, it says,
“We should phone Lestrade,” she says, staring at the open door. “Wait for the police.”
Thompson sits back, her hands folded in her lap. The bracelet stills. “Sherlock can’t cure you, Joanna, not completely. I think you know that.” She gives Joanna a small, encouraging, infuriating smile.
Adrienne holds out her hand, empty and palm up. “I’ll give it back if you can’t manage,” she says. Her lips quirk in a small, taunting smile. “Think of it as an experiment.”
“It will be too late, I’m afraid,” a man says from the kitchen door. The clock chimes again, and is silent.
, she thinks, the words pressing hard against the back of her teeth.
“You have got to be fucking kidding me,” Harry says. She grabs the axe out of Sherlock’s hands and strides back up to the base of the oak. She leans hard against the trunk with one hand, her palm grinding into the bark. “Jo, is that you?”
The witch of the wood smiled. ‘Just so,’ she said, and took a yellow-bristled brush from the deep pocket of her skirts. ‘Take this brush and go to the tall stone that stands over the rich man’s grave. Polish its surface until it gleams like mirror glass, and do not stop until you see your beloved’s reflection standing behind you. Do you understand?’
. Devil’s Weed, or Moonflower. Used as a hallucinogen or lethal toxin. Symptoms include delirium, hyperthermia, and severe sinus tachycardia; overdose can result in coma and death.”
, she should say.
She shrugs. “Thought I saw something. Figured I should find out what it was.”
The wards are failing again; her vision blurs, turning black at the edges.
Joanna grits her teeth. “Free will.”
He reaches out and plucks a leaf of bok choy from the hair behind her ear. He holds it up to the light, studying the green-edged glow of its veins. “It bothers you more than you let on. Killing.”
The sound is – the sound is not a sound but a sensation, a tremor in the earth and a shudder in the teeth. Then it passes and Joanna is choking, is clutching her throat because there is something trapped
This isn’t the first time she’s killed for Sherlock Holmes. She doubts it will be the last.
His grip is strong, but she could pull free if she wanted to. Instead, she leans into his side. Their shoulders touch, lightly. “I did. It would have been better if you’d told me yourself, but I didn’t think you’d want to be disturbed.” She flexes the tendons of her wrist, and they move in his grasp. “How do you know what clothes I was wearing? You were gone when I woke up.”
, she thinks, and by morning it’s forgotten.
“Not a problem.” Sherlock opens his legs, letting her step between. He tips back his head and looks up at her, a smirk curling at the corner of his mouth. “I have a very high tolerance.”
The assistant ignores her, attention fixed on her mobile again. Joanna climbs into the car and sits beside Sherlock, her wet clothes squeaking against the leather seats. Alice takes the seat opposite and closes the door hard behind her.
, she thinks. Sherlock breathes into her mouth, and when he pulls away his eyes are like stone.
Joanna slips it back onto its shelf, fitting it neatly between her books and his.
He plucks the glass from her fingers. “I am not
, the caption reads.
, Joanna thinks.
“I don’t want her on fire,” Harry sobs. “I just want her
Sherlock is staring down at her, stunned. She turns her hand in his and grips his fingers tight. “Don’t let go,” she says, and that’s when the wave hits.
“I’m not shot,” he says, his voice faint. “Blacked out when—” her searching fingers find the fourth and fifth ribs on his left side and he hisses. “When we hit the water.”
“We’re not finished with today’s lesson.” She taps her cane hard against the bare ground. “Meadowsweet.”
The room outside Mycroft’s Whitehall office is small and rather beige, its only decoration a murky painting of the ruins of a Greek colonnade and a lone, ruthlessly uncluttered desk. The new nameplate at the desk’s edge says simply:
Then it stops. “That’s all there is,” Sherlock says, sounding very young. He lowers the violin. “I haven’t written the ending.”
Adrienne almost smiles, her eyes still fixed on her computer screen. “You don’t have an appointment.”
“It’s not my fault you can’t be trusted to take of yourself,” he says, and before she can respond to that bit of outrageous hypocrisy the bedroom door swings open and reveals Mrs Hudson in a panic, still tugging a dressing gown over her flannel nightdress.
See notes at the end for content warnings.
He turns and jumps the barricade, darting past firefighters and police and up to the blue flames seething in the air between the stoop and the front door. He glances back at her in the crowd, and she nods.
“No, you just hid it. Not very well, either.” She frowns at the slow roll of clouds on the horizon. “Maybe I should switch to reading palms. Or tea leaves. Something less dependent on the weather.”
“No, my dear, it’s lovely,” Gran says, patting her hand. “I just don’t have much of an appetite tonight – it’s the cancer, I expect. Inconvenient timing, but the roast will keep.”
Mycroft lifts a sardonic eyebrow. “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,” he says, demonstrating an undoubtedly genetic ability to say the most irritating thing possible in any situation. He turns back to Adrienne. “If the bottles were destroyed before Moran could retrieve the information—”
Joanna staggers but stays standing, her left arm numb at her side. For a moment the drain is too much, too fast – the alley spins around her in a woozy slur of light and dark, pale fire and purpling night sky. Her stomach clenches like she’s about to be sick.
“Did Mycroft tell you to say that?”
Joanna wishes she were dim enough to think, even for a moment, that this was Mycroft’s doing.
Sherlock doesn’t hesitate. “I’ll pay it.”
The hermit slept through the heat of the day, and when the sun sank below the trees the girl lit a candle to keep away the dark. She sat in the chair beside the old man’s bed, and though she was as tired as she had ever been, she did not sleep. She watched the flickering light of the candle, and though she was as hungry as she had ever been, she did not eat.
“Can’t say. I’ve never tried.” She turns away, her cane clicking against the floor as she walks. “Come along, then. A little bird told me there’s a rotting corpse in the refrigerator with your name on it.”
The anger is sudden, immediate. A bile at the back of her teeth. “Yes.”
“Oh for fuck’s sake, Joanna,” Harry says, stumbling backwards in the mud. “We really need to get you back into therapy.” Then she bends down, picks up the axe, and jams the blade deep into the crack in the oak’s trunk.
“Well, it’s about bloody time!” Mrs Hudson says, and bursts into happy tears.
“A healthy hundred-year-old oak doesn’t just uproot after a fortnight’s rain,” Joanna says, her voice pitched low. “But I don’t see how someone could’ve used a tractor or a crane without—”
“Your pulse is a little fast,” she says when she reaches his heart. Her voice sounds strange through the seal of the eartips, and she swallows. “Everything all right?”
The girl ground the flesh of the radishes into a thin paste and seasoned it with the last herbs of her basket. She warmed the paste over the hearth fire and then fed it to the hermit, spoonful by spoonful.
She can feel Adrienne’s gaze fixed on her face. She doesn’t look up to meet it. “Sherlock has spent the last few hours trying to gain access to Moriarty’s official file on our secure server,” Adrienne says. “It lists Moran as a likely associate – that should be enough to start with, I’d think.” She stands, takes the cigar box from Mycroft’s desk and tucks it under her arm. “Shall I give him a nudge in the right direction, sir?”
“I know he won’t.” Joanna shrugs, tipping a bit to one side. “But hiding things from him is impossible, so I’m not going to bother. I’m not going to lie to him, and I’m not asking you to, either. Mostly because it wouldn’t work, but also—” She stops. Frowns. “Also because it would be wrong.”
She raises a wet hand and flicks water at him, laughing when he recoils from the spray like a startled cat. Some things, she thinks, will just never get old. She shuts off the tap and dries her hands on the cleanest tea towel. “Pass me that recipe book, would you? The one with the cardboard cover.”
The boy’s jaw tenses, his face a careful blank. “I was a child then,” he says. “I’m not anymore.” He turns and disappears into the maze.
a long-term solution to the problem.”
Anderson scowls. “There’s no evidence to suggest that the poison was self-administered.”
. Believe me, I’d have noticed if you’d said anything like that.”
Joanna shivers, her arms wrapped tight around her. Their clothes are nearly dry, but the damp and the cold and the slow, creeping exhaustion are taking their toll. They both stink of chlorine and smoke and Sherlock’s wincing now, every time he breathes too deep or lifts his left arm. She needs to get them inside.
“Like—” Mrs. Hudson raises her hand and wiggles her fingers in Joanna’s direction. “
Moriarty shrugs. “Carl sank like an innocent. But then, I did help him along in that, didn’t I?” He leans forward, Seostris’ book open in his hands. “Do you believe in fate, Doctor Watson?”
There is a book in her hands. She doesn’t remember taking it from the box, but now she feels its weight, and the soft, curling edges of its blue paper jacket. The cover is blank, and when she opens to the first page to find its title, the paper slices into the vulnerable skin between her thumb and forefinger. Startled by the pain, she drops the book and raises her hand to her mouth. She tastes dust with the blood, and looks down to see the book open on the floor.
“This is what you wanted,” the hermit said. “This is what you sought from the beginning.”
“Masochist.”
“I shouldn’t be long. I doubt it will be worth my time.”
“Be nice,” she says. “Dying.”
She reaches out with a steady hand and takes the letter. “Nice to meet you, Sebastian,” she says, and closes the door behind her.
your first question? Really?”
The lamps lead her to a pair of massive, curving staircases; her fingers skim the banister as she descends into a vast entrance hall, the marble steps cool under her feet. The ceiling arches overhead, and when a small boy in stiff-pressed trousers rushes past her on the stairs, the great house echoes with the sound of his footsteps.
Joanna shakes her head again, harder. Her eyes squeeze shut. “Don’t—”
Harry looks into the glass, her nose wrinkling. “It isn’t from the tap, is it?”
“You’re going to end up just like Gran. Miserable and broken and alone.”
With anger comes clarity, a pulse-slowing stillness that silences the screaming muscles of her leg. Joanna smiles. “I agree completely,” she says, and twists her finger into the thrice knotted piece of string in her trouser pocket. The rug beneath them ripples like a wave in water, and with a sudden, sinuous snap of hand-woven wool Joanna knocks the other woman off her feet and into the nearest chair. Adrienne lands hard, gripping the armrests with both hands, and the brief flash of genuine surprise on her face is just as satisfying as Joanna hoped it would be.
Joanna beams up at her. “But I need my thumb, Gran. I use it for thumb-things.” To illustrate she wiggles the digit in question, ignoring the sting of pain in her palm. “See? Thumb-tastic.”
, she wrote, just below the record of her mother’s death.
Sherlock says,
She nods, unsure what her voice will reveal if she tries to speak.
The lake is colder now. She lies still and thinks of the little room above. Of the white-framed window, and the long fingers of the black birch tree.
, she thinks, and lets her eyes close.
‘I have kept my promises,’ the widow said with a careful, furious calm that made her wise old teeth chatter in her wise old mouth. ‘Everything you asked of me, I have done.’
“Something funny?” she asks.
“Perhaps,” Moriarty says. “But you can’t, can you? You turned your back on it. Gave up your inheritance for a glamorous life of sand and blood and shit.” He leans toward her, his elbows resting on his knees, like an old friend inviting a confidence. “Is that why you never told Sherlock you found my name at the crime scene? Because you knew that if you told him about the magic, he’d find out how utterly
Mycroft looks up from the book, something almost like uncertainty in his eyes. “You remembered this. After thirty years.”
Joanna has never swooned in her life, not even when she was nine and broke her arm falling off a climbing frame; she doesn’t intend to start now. She steps into the centre of the herb plot, remembering to stand with her feet a steady shoulder-width apart. She looks down at her trainers. “Should I be barefoot?”
She shrugs, ignoring the twinge in her shoulder. “Nothing important.”
An expression of genuine amusement flickers across his face. “Yes, of course. I was only speaking of family in the figurative sense. I’m sure Sherlock thinks of you as the sister we never had.” The corner of his mouth twitches. “Your feelings, I assume, are equally sororal.”
Joanna looks at the letter, then back at the stranger’s face. “She’ll want to know who it’s from.”
The wood is flush with late summer flowers, the little stream thick with reeds. They follow a path into the heart of the wood, past benches and signposts, until Donovan leads them off the path and into the trees.
“Yes, yes, I’m all right. Don’t start tearing my clothes off again.” She stands and helps him to his feet. Her gun lies abandoned on the tile not far away. She picks it up, checks the safety, and shoves it in the waistband of her trousers.
Sherlock frowns, confused and irritated by his confusion. “Gets
Joanna goes inside and cleans the blood and dirt from her hands, wishing she hadn’t asked.
Gran clicks her tongue disapprovingly. “You’ve memorised them – that’s hardly the same as knowing them.”
Branches whip at her face, thorns snagging in the thin paper of her blue jumpsuit, but she doesn’t slow. She hurtles through the mud, over the rotting bodies of fallen trees. She runs until the harsh sound of her breath fills her ears, but the shadow stays small in the distance, in the dark spaces between the trees – always just in sight, just out of her reach.
“He murdered your son,” Joanna says, her mouth like dust. “He cracked open Peter’s ribs and cut out his heart, and then he did the same to another child, and another, and another.”
Joanna takes a deep breath. The fingers of her right hand clench around a cane she no longer carries. “I had Harry.”
Sherlock makes a low, dismissive sound – clearly he finds fault with her priorities. “Still in my trousers. It’s fine.” He pulls out a sticky, congealed lump of what once must have been nicotine patches and drops it onto the table. He begins his attack on the coat’s inside pockets, finding in quick succession a blue biro, a round tin compact, and his pocket magnifier. He shakes the water out of the magnifier and grins. “Excellent.”
Joanna thinks, and grimaces at their oily-sweet smell.
“He will return,” the hermit’s voice said from the trees. “You need only wait.”
Sherlock snorts. “Don’t be.”
He nods, but now that she’s looking she can see that his fingers are clutching the edge of the mattress, his knuckles almost white.
“What the buggering
Joanna lifts the lid and sees a dead starling lying on the bottom of the box, its delicate feet curled and stiff. “Gran, you—”
Joanna sees his reflection, and then remembers where she’s seen it before.
The starling lies dead in its box, tucked away in the fridge between the eggs and the milk. The sickly sweet smell of its decay follows her from room to room, clinging to her hair and hands.
, Joanna almost asks, but she knows why – because the house told her to. Because that’s what the all-saint’s fire was meant to destroy.
“Obviously,” Mrs. Hudson says with such a familiar note of scorn in her voice that Joanna can’t help but wheeze a laugh. “This isn’t funny, young woman. I’m phoning for an ambulance.”
“And what about pain management?” she asks. “If you won’t stay in hospital and you won’t let me hire a nurse, what am I meant to do when it gets bad, Gran? Draw up another decoction of willow bark and put a fucking knife under the bed to
When she looks again, he’s gone.
“It is your life to gamble,” Death said, and, satisfied, the girl closed the door and set to work.
‘Only the stone itself,’ the witch said, still smiling. ‘After all, you will have little use for it once you are done.’
He raises an eyebrow. “And?”
He shakes his head, as if to clear it. “No. I was – something came up. Another case. Jewel thief.”
“Because that’s what he does,” Joanna says. “He’s been toying with us for months. He hired you to kill those people because he wanted this to happen. Exactly this.” She takes a very small step forward, her hands up and open. “We’re not the police, Sergeant. We don’t care about what you’ve done. It’s Moriarty we want.” Another step. “Will you help us?”
The witch was hunched and grey and skinny as sticks. She looked the bride up and down with her little black eyes and said, ‘You are much too tall. Come back when you are shorter, and I will bake you in my oven and eat you for my supper.’
“A simple precaution,” Mycroft says, tapping one finger against the book’s spine. “Metaphysically-imbued items can become quite…” He pauses, rather dramatically. “
“Absolutely not,” he says, but a quick shift of her weight and he’s already losing his grip on her legs. He staggers and she lands hard on her feet, pins and needles pricking from her hips to her toes. She shuffles away from the house with the comical wobble of a newborn foal; Sherlock trails awkwardly after her, probably trying not to look at her bum.
Murray follows her down the long staircase to the front hall, over the threshold and into the empty street. Harry’s car is parked nearby, its windscreen dark with a blanket of dead leaves and its tyres swallowed by sand. Joanna sighs. “She’ll need me to dig her out.”
“You’re probably thinking of ways to save him,” Moriarty says, sounding amused. “I can hear that cracked little misery of a mind just crank-crank-cranking away. You’d detonate the bomb yourself if you thought you could catch me in the blast, but there’s no way to be sure, is there? Lover boy could be here now. He could be just on the other side of that wall.”
She releases him abruptly; he takes a stumbling step back, his lips still slightly parted. He breathes deep and watches her chest rise in time with his. “Joanna—”
“A boy I knew.”
, she thinks, because this time tomorrow or next week or next year she’ll be dead, and he’ll still be Sherlock Holmes. He’ll still be an idiot, and there will be no one left to tell him so.
“What?” Harry says.
Sherlock does nothing, his eyes dull in the strong light of the lamps. She steps closer. Places one hand palm down on the table, beside his.
“Why—”
you are?”
, it says at the top of the page, and the stories are listed below.
They continue through the summer, lush and green and quiet in a way her dreams have never been before. When she sleeps she finds herself in forests, in rain-soaked jungles, in an ill-tended garden on the grounds of a dark-windowed manor. She knows she’s searching for something; she doesn’t know what.
“I should have spoken to him,” Agamede said, her words weighted with grief. “I should have begged him to stay.”
She stretches a little, testing the stiffness in the muscles of her back and arms. Her bad shoulder aches. “How long have I been asleep?”
“Ask it,” the assistant says. “Nicely – you’ve worked it up into quite a state.”
“A bug,” Joanna says, resting her hands on the back of one of the visitor’s chairs. “It was recording everything we said in the flat and bottling our voices in that glass.”
“My leg is fine.”
“There will be a price.” The woman’s hand slides down to cover Joanna’s eyes. “There’s always a price.”
. Others are less familiar, but she recognises their type – boys’ books of adventure and fantasy, featuring cruel pirates and noble Indian chiefs and orphan heroes who risk terrible dangers to seek their fortunes. She wonders if Sherlock has deleted them all; somehow, she doubts it.
“I’m looking for a book,” Joanna says. “I’ll probably find it faster if you help.”
“You should be nicer to Mrs Hudson,” Joanna says into the silence. “You know how she worries.”
He sits on the edge of her bed. “You’re shivering.”
“Like you promised him Agamede’s mirror,” Joanna says, and it may only be a half-remembered guess, but it sounds true as she says it. Moran’s expression reveals nothing, but his voice—
“I saw something,” the frizzy-haired tech says, still kneeling over the body, almost in tears. “When it happened, I saw someone in the trees—”
Joanna hesitates, and the house trembles.
The trouble lies in the things she genuinely wishes to hide.
Harry’s gone quiet, and Joanna tugs her arm until she’s sitting back against the headboard. “Here,” Joanna says, offering her the glass of water she keeps on her bedside table. “Drink this.”
,” Joanna says, sure of her answer but stumbling a little over the pronunciation. “Queen of the Meadow, or Bridewort. Used to treat stomachaches, diarrhoea, and the pains of first love’s heartbreak.”
Joanna closes her eyes.
“I have what I need,” she says, and drops down into the passenger seat. She buckles her safety belt and looks at her sister, at her slim face and wild hair framed by the rising dark of the house. “You don’t miss it here at all, do you?”
Adrienne gives him an arch, insulted look. “Of course, sir,” she says, and leaves the office. She closes the door behind her.
“You’re trying to get out of doing the washing up.”
Joanna waits, careful not to hold her breath.
There’s a rubbish bin beneath the sink. Joanna crams the satchel and the clay man inside, below the fruit peels and used plastic wrap.
under her breath. Adrienne brings Joanna boxes of Harry’s ratty schoolbooks, her mother’s murder mysteries, her father’s favourite anthologies of modern poetry.
. That was the last they’d spoken of it.
“Not at all. That one belonged to my maternal grandmother – she was a bit of an eccentric, bless her. Excellent cook, though.” She hides her hands in her trouser pockets. Her left is perfectly steady. “Sherlock said he’d be out for most of the night. I’ll tell him you stopped by, if he doesn’t deduce it from the mud on the doormat.”
“Absolutely not,” Sherlock is saying, and the low, infuriated rumble of his voice calms her. His voice, and the cool, slightly chemical smell of Baker Street. She sits up in bed and takes in the steadying darkness of her room. There are footsteps on the stairs. “If she wanted to talk to you, she would answer when you phoned. As she does not, we can assume she doesn’t wish to see you at any time, much less in the middle of the night, much
“’m naked,” Joanna says, sounding drunk, though she isn’t anymore. “It’s cold.”
She turns the page. “Have you ever actually

he wants. I could kill you now, burn you alive and let him watch, and it would only be part of the game. He’d have his next move ready in minutes, and your ashes would be dirt under his feet.”
, she doesn’t say, but of course he hears it. His gaze flinches away, but only for a moment.
Years passed, and Death kept his word; the girl did not see him again. She took the book, the blade, and the horn and travelled far from the village where she’d been a child, through forests and cities, along deep ravines and across storm-churned seas, and wherever she went she used Death’s own gifts to save those he would have taken. Word of her skill spread far, and with the secrets written in the black book she cured kings in their castles and labourers in their fields, delivered whole those infants meant to die and restored to the aged the strength of youth. The girl grew to be a woman, and where she walked the people had no fear of death.
The mattress moves beneath them as he shifts, easing closer. “The clothes you wore yesterday are gone. Shirt, trousers, bra, pants, everything. If you’d stripped naked in some sort of drunken haze, your clothes would be scattered about the flat. Instead they’re just – gone. Not in the bin, not in the wash, not flushed down the toilet nor burnt to ash in the fireplace. You disposed of them somehow, and I don’t know why.” The circle of his fingers tightens around her wrist. “You texted my brother and asked him my middle name.”
Sherlock flips the wallet open, closes it, and throws it onto the worktop. He drifts to the other side of the kitchen, tying the belt of his dressing gown firmly around his waist. “I have a new case. I leave for Minsk in a few hours.”
“He doesn’t,” Adrienne says, and walks off down the corridor, phone already at her ear. “Now stop stalling and open the damned door.” Her heels click in quick percussion against the concrete, and Joanna listens as the sound of her footsteps fades.
“I see,” Alice says. She taps a button on her phone and lifts it to her ear. Mycroft answers immediately. “You’ll want me at the scene,” she says. “I’ll return as soon as the flat’s secured.” There’s a pause as Mycroft replies. “Yes, sir.” She rings off.
“Good evening, Doctor Watson,” he says without looking up from the time-yellowed page in front of him. “Did you enjoy your walk?”
Joanna can’t help it; her heart starts to beat a little faster. “What’s lesson two?”
She looks up and meets his eyes. She can’t remember the expression she saw on his face in the moment Boyle prepared to snap his neck. She knows he was looking at her.
“I’m looking at those ribs the moment we get home,” Joanna says, but if he hears her, he doesn’t respond. They sit in silence until the car turns onto Baker Street twenty minutes later.
She’s known Sherlock Holmes for little more than twenty-four hours when she kills for him the first time.
Caught, Joanna smiles through her panic. “Yeah,” she says. “Me and Gran’s cursed mummy.” She leans forward a little, mockingly, like she’s sharing a confidence. “He doesn’t need much sleep, you see. Being dead and all.”
The human with the axe runs for the oak’s trunk, evading her roots long enough to swing the blade deep into her flesh. Moss and ivy writhe across her bark, tangling in the human’s hair and clothes and seeking the handle of the axe. Yet the human brings the blade down again and again, shouting with each swing.
The front door of 221 is dark wood, solid in its moulded frame and cool against the skin of her palms. Joanna has walked through this door hundreds of times, maybe thousands. She has locked and unlocked it, turned tumblers and thrown bolts, has crossed its threshold time and again and lived for months within the walls of its house – the house that rises around her now, a body of wallpaper and wood and brick. She has counted its steps and scuffed them with her heels, has shouted up to the flat above and down to the basement below and slept and bled and dreamt beneath its tiled roof. A house has bones and flesh, the joints of its floorboards and watching eyes set in window frames and as much as any house has ever been, this is her home. Her bones and her flesh.
She takes another long drink from the cup. “Right. Because you’re not in the habit of coddling drunks.”
Gran smiles. “How do you feel about sandwiches?”
Death reached into his cloak and drew out a twisted, bone-white horn. It looked to be hollow, but when Death raised it, the air around them filled with the golden smell of a harvest feast, of ripe, full fruits and warm-baked bread. The girl accepted the horn and tucked it close under her arm. “You intend to take the hermit at moonrise,” she said.
He reaches down and picks up the book. It’s smaller than the others, blue and bound in cloth. If there is a title printed on the cover, she cannot read it.
“You should put a plaster on that finger,” Joanna says. “You’re still bleeding.”
Joanna takes a deep breath, and the spine of the recipe book presses hard against her side. “Whatever you want to call it,” she says, “it isn’t part of my life anymore. Sherlock doesn’t need to know.”
“Not forever,” Gran says, but she doesn’t mention it again.
Joanna sighs. “Don’t tell me – you’ve lost your keys again.”
Sherlock is six years old, russet-curled and grinning like a devil; he swings once around the banister at the end of the staircase and is off like a shot towards the gallery, his short legs working at incredible speed.
James Moriarty would burn it.
“You don’t. Clara does.”
“Two of your fingers are dislocated,” she tells the man, leaning forward a bit to catch his eye. “If you don’t see a doctor soon, there might be permanent damage.”
“The pond, Sherlock. How did you manage that? Have they installed one at New Scotland Yard since I was last there?”
. She and Harry read them over and over again, stealing the book back and forth between them in the day and repeating their favourites aloud each night in the dark, long after they were meant to be asleep.
“I left the house to your sister.”
The Burberry shopping bag is still sitting beside Harry’s empty chair. Joanna reaches for it, ready to limp after her, but she stops when she sees what’s inside.
The ride back to Baker Street is silent but for the hum of the engine and the soft sounds of Adrienne’s mobile. Joanna leans against the town car window and watches the city flow past, a London bleached colourless by the height of the midday sun. Her shoulder aches, but her mind is clear.
Gran’s recipe book is heavier than it looks, and it lets loose a low sigh of dust when Joanna drops it onto the kitchen table. The picture on the cheap cardboard cover is stained and worn, but she can still make out the shape of a tall, robed woman and the harvest cornucopia she carries in crook of one arm. The scythe she raises with the other. Joanna turns to the first page and breathes in the bitter smell of old herbs and older paper.
“Gran told me you’d be hiding up here,” Harry says, her shoulders hunched low as she steps up into the room. Her nose wrinkles delicately. “Jesus. This place smells like a corpse.”
— from gaping at Sherlock at this deceptively banal pronouncement.

) Being on his person, the book necessarily had to be small (either constantly or collapsably so), inconspicuous, and — judging by his aesthetic tastes and scholarly interests — antiquated in some way: a throw-back, a personal joke that would add ironic savour to the victorious melodrama of carrying such implicating material into the ivory towers and red-carpeted halls of London’s great and powerful.
–Derek Walcott, ‘The Fist’
‘Nah, it’s fine,’ John shrugged, putting the book down and wiping his face to shake himself of the fog in his mind.
‘Not like swallowing legal papers,’ he had gone on, looking anything but solemn. ‘Bloody dry enough to make anyone choke.’
‘You did not hear yourself, Watson,’ Holmes interrupted. ‘You groaned in approval; you positively hummed with pleasure.’
‘I’m sorry,’ John told him, which was so ludicrously irrelevant that Sherlock couldn’t help but wince.
The ringing sounded again.

‘Of course,’ Bradstreet admitted with a sigh, placing his hands in his pockets, ‘but the other staff – the Countess’s PA, Catherine Cusack, the hotel’s assistant something-or-other, Ryder, the room service boy Thaw, the hotel’s plumber Huggins, all of 'em said they were surprised he had come back so late that evening to fix some vents. Felt a bit odd around him.’
‘John?’
Voice croaking, Sherlock lifted his head enough to protest, ‘We don’t need —’
‘Not so much,’ he replied eventually, continuing to address the whole room rather than peer at Sherlock in the half-light. ‘But the surgery was more complicated — the bullet nicked my shoulder, whereas you, fortunately, didn’t have it hit anything. And the sepsis was my main problem. That was why they didn’t move me to a bigger hospital: worried the trip would make the fever worse.’

At Bow Street, Sherlock gave his best Usain Bolt impersonation and, as ever, left John to pick up the fare.
‘You had sex with me only yesterday,’ Sherlock reasoned, feigning objectivity. (He did have standards to maintain, even if they were both entirely aware it was a front.)

Miss Morstan was that John would, almost assuredly, not believe that Sherlock had not insisted upon knowing the full contents of the ‘AGRA’ file. It was precisely the kind of relentless nosiness that John, with some reason, attributed to Sherlock: the fact that Sherlock had not gone out of his way to learn about Mary Morstan — as he patently had in sussing out John’s middle name, his military assignations, his credit (and indeed sexual) history, his childhood home-life — was, frankly, uncreditable.
Bradstreet waited another moment, looking between them, unsure. Sherlock said nothing but pushed past, so quickly the motion-sensing lights were still flickering as he marched through the doors. The inspector looked uncomfortably at John. ‘Everything all right there, Doctor Watson?’ he ventured in an undertone.
John was acting strangely, though, a little more solicitous about their coital plans for this evening.

‘I find it’s best to take the molehill to Mohammed.’
His hand hit the table so hard his unused butter knife sprung up and clattered to the tiled floor like a colonel’s whistle in a barracks. A radius of silence mushroomed out from their table. He held his breath, counted — The sheer proximity of his balled fist to the water glass, shuddering as the ice sloshed the sides, at least made him grateful he had not collided with it. He didn’t fancy having to deal with stitches, his own or anyone else’s, on top of restraining himself from slapping his sister in a hotel bistro in Piccadilly where everyone was staring, shocked, at the lunatic who had interrupted their lunch.
‘You reported that the dressing table had been broken into, as well as some papers and several other drawers and items disturbed.’
‘Oh. Well…’ She tucked her hair back, then shrugged, smile fading. ‘I’ll keep thinking, anyway.’
I paused here, at the conclusion of one of Morris’s paragraphs, to peer side-ways at Holmes. After a moment of stillness, Holmes unfurled his long body and rose, lithe as ever, to fetch some tobacco from the persian slipper. I took this as a signal that, rather than abuse, I should I expect his further attention. I carried on.
‘I want to kiss you,’ John told him, hushed, almost inaudible against the dreamy white noise of the waking street, the bristle of innumerable fibres encasing them in the aural equivalent of cotton wool.
‘And yet nothing else was taken?’ Sherlock went on, with a tone of disbelief, and the Countess inclined her head.
‘You frequently invoke Mrs. Hudson whenever you wish to disapprove of something I’ve contributed to the flat.’
‘Advanced intellectual stimulation is essential to a child’s cognitive development, John, as we have discussed numerous times.’
The only thing more wonderful than Mycroft’s pale face as he exited 221b (no doubt in the direction of his dry cleaner) was John’s irrepressible laughter as it carried on long after he had gone.
‘Would you…’ He paused. This was asking for trouble, but… maybe it didn’t count, if he could postpone it until tomorrow? ‘Would it help, if we arranged a time to… to have sex? Gave us some space to wrap our heads around it?’
‘Oh, not really,’ said Violet indifferently. ‘My father always kept a place in town, though I’m sure you know that. I said I needed a place to have friends round when everyone comes up, and he thought this would suit. But it was my fiancé who surprised me by completely redecorating it: he has excellent taste.’ She sipped her tea, awaiting his disapproval.
Taking up a pen, Sherlock scripted a phrase he expected Henry Baker would welcome, and handed it to John. He watched John’s dark eyes read the sentence, then lift to peer accusingly at him. ‘Really.’
with John’s name (‘John H. Watson, M.D.’) along the fronts and spines in bright, clear gold. (An excellent colour choice for his name.)
‘Oh, lord,’ John went on, chuckling, as he rose (releasing Sherlock’s fingers at last) and marched towards the stairs, ‘if she opens a delivery of ten different flavours of condom, you’re doing your own explaining.’
Bradstreet was just emerging from the interview when Sherlock stopped short, John only a pace behind. Sherlock then stepped forward, and John wondered if he meant to shake Bradstreet’s hand (an unusually tactile thing for Sherlock to do, though he was prone to more pleasantries
Stomach still in something of a somersault routine, Sherlock exited the flat a quarter-hour later, headed for the tube. (He’d spritzed a bit of the cologne he’d given John last week on his average-bloke M&S jumper beneath the worn-leather jacket. One never knew.) Before attuning his mind fully to the problem at hand, and while he was still above ground, he sent one last text — wildly unnecessary but, he thought, the sort of thing John might appreciate having affirmed (however uncomfortably trite it felt coming from Sherlock’s own fingertips, bared like a teenagerish scribble of their conjoined initials in a notebook).
John hid his smirk by rubbing his upper lip.

thought about that for a brief second, smirking at the idea of a royal commission and wondering if Sherlock had been hoping instead for John to come home and find him wrapped in a sheet, to fuck him on the carpet, like he’d just about ended up doing the other day.
It was all true, plainly written in her every movement and unconscious gesture, but John was positive — almost as positive as Sherlock would be — that she hadn’t yet actually told them what had happened to her. Yet in the back of his mind reverberated the words Sherlock had confided in him last night.
Blinking himself into conscious, he felt, as Sherlock continued to be jolted with aftershocks, that he was in danger of declaring all sorts of things.

Wearily, but with a flicker of vengeance, Maureen nodded. ‘Come on then.’
‘Really! John!’ Her eyes darted back at the room for a moment. ‘He’s doing much better. You mustn’t forget yourself, you know.’

He was not a good man.
Sherlock had rolled his eyes. ‘Dear lord.’
‘Yes you do.’
Trust Sherlock to imagine a conspiracy among friends before breakfast.
A staggered exhale from John’s nostrils wrested Sherlock from the tornado of his own thoughts. He found his own mouth dry, rear molars ground into each other as though cemented. With effort, he unclamped his jaw a fraction of a pascal.

After many long seconds, heartrate returning to rest, John opened his eyes (pupils sluggishly contracting to normal, at a standard rate) and blurrily turned his face.
‘Bossy,’ John chided, but he gave in anyway.
She nodded, sniffing her pastry and then apparently thinking the better of it. Suddenly, John thought over her face and – oh, yes, excellent – he loved being able to deduce something Sherlock had missed. He was going to savour that once they left.
Everyone blinked.
‘“Hell?”’ Sherlock repeated, examining her with a tilted head that made him not a little bit intimidating himself.
‘Gruener keeps a book. It involves personal anecdotes of his assignations with underaged young women — girls, ages approximately thirteen to sixteen. When one of his employees procures a new “worker” who meets Gruener’s approval, Gruener reserves the right to “break her in” to her new career.

A humid gust of breath stirred the minute hairs on his upper lip, nose… John. (Good.) Probably waking up ((bed)room temperature low: still early) to go to work or some other ill-advised distraction from the far more interesting work of the case (and Sherlock). The usual sounds of morning (it had to be morning: Sherlock hadn’t even come to bed until just before half-four), John rolling over to verify the time on the bedside clock (as if he couldn’t deduce it: soldier’s habit!), then drowsily moving around more. Not nearer to Sherlock: unimportant.
'Utterly,' she swore, with almost breathless fervour.
Waking in a cold sweat at approximately half-past three in the morning (absurd to refer to such an hour as ‘morning’: it was unequivocally, if disorientatingly, night), he’d abandoned his allocated bed roll and gone in search of fresh air (though not hard to find here) and (more difficult) something besides the terrors behind his eyelids to look at.

John returned a moment later — no, unless he was carrying a very, absurdly, stupidly small species, whatever was slowing his steps minutely was not canine —, a brown box and several assorted pieces of post in hands. Balancing the box on one lifted knee against the worktop, John reached over it, sifting through and whittling down the post to two single letters; the rest went in the bin.
) was ‘no longer a threat’, and that he ‘shouldn’t worry’. Sherlock had been so voraciously focussed on the wonder that was John Watson that he hadn’t chased down the trail before it was (almost certainly) expertly washed away with military-strength, MI6-funded bleach.
John huffed without glancing sideways.
– no, fuck that, before then, you swore,

But John was still looking at him almost entreatingly, and Sherlock couldn’t deny that he understood, down to his smallest biological units, how desperately he would resist letting John go into that man’s house on his own.
‘That was organised, you know,’ chided John, breathless, while Sherlock opened the lubricant to squeeze a glob into his palm.
His chest felt ringingly hollow, a house bombed out and empty, walls still reverberating from the blast. He was fairly sure he would crumple to the ground if he tried to get to his feet, and the last thing they needed was for him to get a knock on the head and need stitches. Even so, it didn’t seem fair that the one battlescar on his body from a wound that had nearly killed him was from a bullet on dusty road and not from the echoing, gaping agony of loving a man who refused to take seriously John’s desperate pronouncement that losing Sherlock again would actually kill him. Sherlock’s freshly-hewn tissue under a mat of cotton wool and padding and surgical sutures would, of course, leave a permanent mark. The fact that, at least this time, John knew where the scar had come from was like sea water in his lungs.
Sherlock says; Joanna can remember his sneer, the arc of the violin bow as he snapped it through the air.
“Of course he is,” Alice says, her tone mild. “I assume that’s why you so enjoyed his attentions.”
“Ah.” He doesn’t say anything else. His mobile chimes, and she opens her eyes.
“I’ll text,” he says, and leaves her standing alone in her bedroom, her hair still damp in its single, perfect plait.

Late afternoon sun streams into the corridor, painting the floorboards. Joanna stands in front of the attic door and, for the first time in years, tries the knob. It’s locked.
Moran pulls the trigger. The Browning clicks, jammed.
Sherlock walks past him without a word, not stopping until he stands at the edge of the pit, looking down.
They haven’t walked far before Joanna sees the tent, its peak white amid the green. Beneath it a team of blue-suited forensic techs stand and kneel around a crater in the earth – a hole exposed by a massive, uprooted oak. The tree lies broken across the forest floor, the long tangle of its roots curled in the open air.
The door to the hermit’s cottage opened and a thief came inside. His hands and feet and face were wrapped in black rags, and he carried a knife, its blade wicked and stained.
They found the pool at the heart of a grove of birch trees, far from the village and the home of any living man. The trees were bare, and stood like pale sentries around the water. The woman reached out and found their bark cold to the touch. The pool lay just beyond, its surface as still as silence and as smooth as glass.
“There was nothing to fear, child. All things die.”
The corpse on the table smiles, her arms folded across her chest like an ancient king’s, like a pharaoh’s in stone. Like someone prepared for death.
“What have you done to mine?” she asks, and startles when heavy footsteps pound up the attic stairs a moment later. She stands, turning her back to the mirror and stuffing the crisps into her pocket.

“Oh, stop whinging,” Gran says, and takes another sip of her tomato juice. She watches Joanna work from her lawn chair at the edge of the herb garden, sheltered by the shade of the stunted hawthorn tree. “These are the basics, girl. You can’t learn to use them until you know how to grow them.”
Joanna can’t help it; she drops her head back against the kitchen counter and starts to laugh. After a moment Gran joins in, the sound low and hoarse and rare.
Sherlock reaches out, wordlessly offering his brother the little blue book. After a moment, Mycroft takes it.
They talked of her travels, of the places she had seen and the deaths she had undone, and when they had finished the hermit emptied the cup in front of him and said, “I never thanked you for what you did.”
It’s a man shaped out of clay, small enough to sit easily in the palm of her hand. Its arms are bound behind its back, its clay legs tied together with twine.
“You were smiling.”
she thinks, and remembers the ashes of the vest, swallowed by flame. “He was playing with us. He never intended for me to burn.”
“Sherlock—” She turns to face him, but he’s already backing away, moving toward the door.
She can buy Sherlock and Mrs Hudson more time. She can force the wards to hold. All she needs is a needle and thread.
Joanna lives alone in the house until she begins her first term at Barts.

A memory rises, unbidden, of the dead starling and its terrible stillness. A memory of the mouse quivering in the palm of her hand, its heartbeat and breath.

Joanna knows what to look for, now. She doesn’t forget.
Gran taps her shoulder lightly with the end of her cane. “Meadowsweet.”
There is a sound like wind or waves, like the scrape of the dead birch tree’s black fingers against the window glass. Harry looks around at the unfamiliar little room, at the pale wallpaper and the white wood furniture. The empty night table beside the bed.
The witch of the wood laughed a horrible laugh. ‘Just so, just so,’ she said, and took a small wooden box from the deep pocket of her skirts. ‘This box holds the antidote to any poison. I will trade it for a promise.’
She tightens her grip on Sherlock’s hand and pulls herself out of the dark.
,” Gran says again, but Joanna’s pager is beeping and she’s already walking to the door.
“Maybe it’s for the best,” she says to no one, her voice cracking a little with disuse. “I’m not a child anymore either.”
A sudden snap of bone and his arm is free of the tree’s grip. Before she can react he slams his hand palm down on a nearby sharp-growing branch, and she feels the slick rush of warm blood against bark.
“You don’t need to keep me safe, you nutter. You need to stop being a bloody tree.”
The house overwhelms her with its panic and dread and
The man steps into the kitchen and gives Mrs Barrow a dry kiss on the cheek. “Hello, Amelia. Sorry I’m early.” He nods at Sherlock. “Mr Holmes.”
The boy sets down his pencil. Touches his ear once, with one finger.
Joanna looks at the cigar box and its broken tangle of copper wire and glass. “Has a distinctive style, does he?”
“Goodnight,” the assistant says, almost smiling. “We’ll be in touch.”
For an inexplicable moment, Sherlock hesitates. “Who was he?”
“The spell needed to be as strong as I could make it. The result was worth the risk.”
Sherlock steps up to the wall, brushing his fingers over the weatherworn brick as he studies it, his eyes quick even in the dim light. He drops his hand and turns back to her. “Well, then,” he says. “Are we going over or not?”
Mycroft looks back and forth between them like a spectator at an unexpectedly violent tennis match. “Ladies, if I may interject—”
Sherlock stands, the bruise a shadow across his ribs. “No, I didn’t. But then, I am rather clever.” He lifts his hand until his fingers hover over her left shoulder, just above the scar. “May I?”
Joanna clutches the cane’s handle, breathing through the humiliation and pain. “Make it up to me,” she says. “Buy me lunch.”
Once upon a time there was a man who was dying, and Death came and stood outside his door.
“He’s testing me,” she says. She looks past Sherlock, into the light of a streetlamp prismed by rain. “Moriarty. This was a test.”
Joanna gives the assistant a pointed look. “Alice?”
He looks up at her from his knees, his hands firm at her waist. She can feel each of his fingers through the thick fabric of the nightgown. His eyes are fixed on hers, red-rimmed and unreadable.
He nods. Then, after a brief pause, he says something in return. She doesn’t need to hear the words to know it’s something secret. Something he would never say to anyone else.
“Sherlock, stop shamming. I need to know if it hurts.”
He inhales, and it sounds marvellous – a clear, clean rush of air that drowns out every other sound, any lingering doubt or fear. It’s easier now that he can’t see her face, and Joanna closes her eyes before she asks him to breathe again, working her way left to right down the lean breadth of his back.
“And he led me here,” she says, gesturing to the wall.
His fingers still. After a moment’s pause they continue, weaving the plait down her back. “The thought had occurred. I only have so many attachments to exploit; as my flatmate and colleague, you are the obvious choice.” He finishes the plait with quick, economical twists of his forearms and wrists and ties it off with the snap of an elastic. “No sane person would risk her life for a convenient flatshare.”
“No. Helene kept her ancestry a secret, even from me.” Moran tilts his head slightly to one side, curious. “And you, Joanna? What do you see in Agamede’s mirror?”
that has killed you, old man,” the girl said. “Now save your breath and drink.”
Joanna nods. When she’s sure of her voice, she says, “My parents died when I was twelve. I lived with her until I left for university.” She sits in the chair beside his, slipping the cane from his suddenly loose grip. “But then, you already knew that.”
They all begin the same way.
He knows he is. “It was Glentworth Street,” she says. “Outside that coffee shop.”
She breathes clean air for him – one deep breath, then two. His heart beats fast in the palm of her hand.
There’s a strange strain in the fine lines around his eyes, at the corner of his mouth. He watches her face, waiting for her answer.
The woman walked past him, through the trees and close to the water’s edge. “I was tired of being afraid.”
“Hmm,” the assistant says, and presses her palm flat over the hole. She holds it there for a brief moment, perfectly manicured nails and pale fingers splayed across the wallpaper. When she lowers her hand, the air smells slightly of wood smoke and the hole is gone.
.” The air inside the car is so hot she can hardly breathe. “Of course you did. You’re Sherlock Holmes, the world’s greatest swot detective; I suppose by now you can identify a hedgewitch by her broom handle and a blood cult necromancer by the stains on his tie.”
Death looked again at the girl. She had a stubborn chin. But for the healthy summer flush of her skin, it was not unlike his. “The hermit’s fever is a fatal one, child. You cannot win his life from me.”
, and then the foundation of the house shudders beneath her. Harry screeches, grabbing hold of the table, and the tremors shake the pots from their hooks, the cups and bowls from their shelves. The lamp swings wildly from the ceiling, ceramic and glass shattering across the floor, and then Gran reaches out and pokes Joanna hard in the shoulder with the end of her cane. Everything goes still.
“I’m going to quite intentionally boot you out of my flat in a minute if you don’t tell me why you’re here.”
That only makes them laugh harder.
“Who found them?” Joanna asks.
“Jo!” the human with the axe yells through the din, shouting into the crack it opened in the oak’s trunk. “Jo, can you hear me?”
, Joanna thinks.
,” the voice says, forcing its way out of their throats. “
“Hand-sewn binding, generic mid-century cloth cover.” He flips the book open, briefly, to the first few pages. “No publisher’s name, no editor, no author. No title. Judging by the acidification of the paper and the quality of the ink, I’d say it was printed in London on a privately owned press sometime between 1947 and 1953.”
,” she says, and this time the needle finds her palm’s heart line. She breathes deep and knows that her breath fills his lungs, knows that every pulse of his heart finds its echo in hers. She drags the thread through her skin, slick with blood and nearly black in the firelight.
The floor around her is littered with books, many with familiar titles –
“What do you think?” Joanna asks her shadow, the wall of flame between them. “Could be dangerous.”
Sherlock tilts back his head to look up at her, squinting slightly into the light. “What are you waiting for? We’re about to exhume the torso, and I want your input.”
There is the sound of light footsteps on the stairs, and Joanna turns to see Mycroft opening the door to the cellar room, poised and crisply pressed as always. He pauses slightly at the threshold, glancing around the room as though marking the changes since the last time he’d been inside.
flowers.”
Gran sits in the chair beside hers, sighing as she eases the weight off her bad leg. She leans forward, drawing the handle of her cane along the table’s edge. “You could’ve asked me, you know. It is my mirror; I know it better than most.”
“Yeah, that’s not going to happen.” She slides slowly out of the bed and gives her legs time to adjust to her weight. After a minute’s patience, she’s standing. She cinches the belt of the dressing gown tighter around her waist. “If you hear me fall, don’t come after me. Either let me crawl to the toilet on my hands and knees like a man or leave me in the corridor to die.”
‘Do not be afraid,’ the orphan girl told the boy; ‘it is not your time yet,’ and she thrust the yellow wax candle into a lamp’s open flame.
,” he says, and that’s when Moran steps around the table and aims the gun at the back of Sherlock’s head.
Mrs Hudson avoids Sherlock and the little room below the library, but she visits Mycroft each evening in his father’s study, bringing him heavily sugared cups of tea and sandwiches he politely refuses to eat. Joanna likes watching them argue; it’s as close as she’s ever seen Mycroft come to losing his temper, and winning seems to cheer Mrs Hudson up enormously. One night they spend nearly twenty minutes debating the nutritional merits of Branston pickle, and it somehow ends with Mycroft grudgingly eating both halves of a cheese and chutney sandwich – butter, pickle, and all.
, the screen says, and Joanna sits in the chair beside Sherlock’s, listening to the reporter’s even-toned account of the destruction. Faulty gas main, he says. A tragic accident.
When she turns around, her grandmother is standing at the top of the narrow staircase, leaning heavily on the railing. Her face is dangerously pale. “Give that to me,” she says, her voice as sharp as Joanna’s ever heard it. “
There’s no evidence of force or impact on the trunk. Joanna frowns and asks,
“I know. That’s what she told me.” Harry’s hand finds hers in the dark. “But it’s not quite true, is it?”
“I wouldn’t have,” Moran says. “Not today. Not like this.” He’s sweating now too, from pain or the heat or both, and his forehead is beaded with perspiration. “James will kill Holmes himself. I promised him that.”
He looks up, and his bloodshot eyes fix on her sleeping face.
His arm lashes out and the book hits the far wall with a muffled slap. He stares at the place where it hit, breathing hard in the silence. Then he reaches across the bed and folds his hand over the limp fingers spread across her stomach.
Joanna steps off the last stair. “Not for much longer. The fire’ll burn the booze right off.” She takes the tea tray from Mrs. Hudson’s arms and sets it down on the little table near the front door. “This is probably going to look awful, but you have to promise you won’t do anything to stop me. As long as I finish, everything will be all right.” She turns and looks at the other woman over her shoulder. “All right?”
He laughed. “I do not doubt that. Still, I owe you a debt; I would like to see it settled.”
“Magic, probably,” she says. “Though you don’t seem like the type to accept that as an explanation.”
Joanna looks to the sky, the slow roll of clouds on the horizon and the rare light of the stars. If she’d looked before, she might have known. All witches believe in fate.
In her nightmares, her gran is dying.
“And to you, child,” Death said, and was gone.
Joanna drops her schoolbag to the floor and rattles the doorknob with both hands, twisting it hard to the right and to the left, hoping to shake something loose. She’s about to slam her shoulder against the frame when her gran emerges from a room down the corridor, her eyebrows raised high. “Problem?”
“It’s fine,” she says through her teeth. “I can control it.”
There are footsteps in the corridor. Joanna listens as he walks past – his pace measured, steady, familiar – and follows the sound, letting it lead her into the east wing of the house. Up a narrow staircase and down a long hallway, to the open door of the little white room where Joanna Watson sleeps.
“Something you’ve composed?”
Night fell, and the widow polished the stone that stood over the rich man’s grave until it shone like a mirror in the moonlight. When she looked at the stone she saw the dark heart of the wood razed to the ground, a terrible black-towered city burning in its place, and she saw the grove of white trees, but she did not see her beloved.
Joanna watches the body slump forward onto the table, blood and brain matter spilling onto the wood.
The song is not lovely, exactly. It is simple and bittersweet, each note pure and clear and uncomplicated. Joanna has never heard him play it before, or anything like it; the melody reminds her of the long nights before Gran’s death, of sitting alone beside her sickbed and listening for the sound of the wind in the chimney. For the tap of tree branches against window glass. Sherlock plays and it is beautiful, and horrible. The loneliest thing she’s ever heard.
.” He stands a little, bending across the table and pulling at his eyelid. “Look,” he says, “you’ve blinded me with a bud of broccoli.”
No answer. The only light in the little room comes from the hallway outside, and the open crack of the door. Joanna slips out of the bed and walks across the room, her bare feet soundless on the milk-white rug. The doorknob is cold in her hand, and the hinges creak as she looks out, squinting into the light.
The table is propped up on its end, pushed against the back wall of the storage unit and surrounded by dust-dark cardboard boxes. Layers of greying bubble wrap protect the table legs where they jut out into the room, but the names etched on the underside are exposed. Adrienne pushes past her, steps neatly around the pieces of a broken loom, and moves close enough to read them.
Moran. She can feel it now, the empty space in her mind where he belongs, the absence itself like a kind of memory. Sebastian Moran. How many times has she forgotten his name?
‘You have slept too long,’ Death told the rich man’s wife. ‘He is already gone.’
“Harry, no!” Sherlock cries, but the oak is already growing, her branches crashing through the roof and spiralling towards sunlight and the sky. The old house begins to crumble around them in a hail of plaster and brick and wood, but neither of the humans runs for safety.
Joanna’s sheets are still wet, soaked through in a muddy, coat-shaped stain, but she finds a dry corner at the far side of the bed. She spends the night curled on her side, watching the slow progress of shadows and sunrise across the wall. When she finally drifts off, it’s to the sound of his pacing footsteps in the rooms below.
“Yes,” he says, “
“I see it now,” Sherlock says from the door. He leans against the frame, his arms folded across his chest. His voice is slow, almost lazy. Deliberate. “It’s the appeal of the contradiction. That stimulating soupcon of cognitive dissonance – the doctor and the soldier. The garden and the gun.” He pauses, his eyes fixed on hers. “The cornucopia and the scythe.”
The body in the bed cannot feel it, but Joanna does – the humid press of his sweating palm, his bony knuckles tucked against her belly. She is nothing more than a ghost at his side, solid as a shadow, and still she feels the phantom weight of his hand on hers.
The bride did not know how to explain love to a witch. ‘My husband cares for me,’ the bride said instead. ‘If he dies I will not live long enough to be an old woman, and I will never again be short enough for your supper.’

“Once upon a time,” he says, his voice low and dry as dust, “there was a boy who was dying, and Death came and stood outside his door.”
“I do not seek shelter,” said the thief.
On the thirteenth night the witch woman Agamede stood at the pool’s edge and waited for her love to appear in the water. Hours passed, and the surface was as dark as the moonless sky above.
an amateur, and she
“Now I know my limits,” she says again, aloud. A promise to an empty room.
There are other clippings taped to the wall, but they mean little to her – personal adverts from the Daily Mail, an interview with the MP for Croydon South. Several obituaries, none with names she recognises. At the bottom of the map Sherlock scribbled a note in pencil. She bends down to read it.
“Gathering what information he can before the trail goes cold.” Sherlock makes a derisive noise and turns to the window. Alice looks up from the mobile and meets Joanna’s eyes. “If you’ve learnt anything that might be useful in the search—”
“It is,” Joanna says around the cold lump at the back of her throat. “Very important.” She looks up and meets her grandmother’s steady blue gaze. “Will you unlock the door?”
“Selfish.”
“Yes, Sherlock?”
A test, more like. Joanna drops the key into her open hand. “I’ll try, but it isn’t going to work.”
Joanna swallows. She knows Gran is only guessing; she could lie, if she wanted. “Yes,” she says. “I wanted to know about the mirror.”
Moriarty laughs quietly, into her ear. “Oh, I would. But the curtain’s up, Jo, and we’ve such a show planned for him. It’s time for your entrance.” The sniper at the end of the corridor moves closer, an unsubtle, unnecessary threat; Joanna opens the door and steps through.
A billow of smoke escapes over their heads. Sherlock braces Mrs Hudson by the shoulders as she coughs the burning air from her lungs. Her body shakes with the effort, and grey tears stream down both their faces, stained with smoke. The wards condense around them, keeping them from the flames even as the doorway begins to blacken and char.
Joanna stills. Looks up and meets his eyes, their colour ethereally pale in the streetlight. “Of course,” she says. “Of course it does.”
‘And you have lived a long, good life. Your beloved died in his sleep, a fat happy old man who loved you with his whole wealthy heart. Twice he was meant to die, and twice you were allowed to keep him. Would you dare ask again?’
She wants to. It would be easy enough – she could crush him with a twitch of her fingers. Snap his spine in two. She may not even remember, afterwards.
Sherlock had slammed out the door minutes later in a great sulk, and Joanna hasn’t seen him since. That was three hours ago.
His fingers find a rough spot on the front cover. He rubs his thumb over it once, twice, and then angles the book towards the light, revealing a shallow imprint in the cloth – a horned snake coiled in a circle, eating its own tail.
One afternoon she writes,
She closes the bag.
For a moment she feels cracked open and exposed, as if she’s found herself suddenly naked in front of him. His face is impassive, unreadable, and there’s nothing like judgment or pity in his eyes. She looks back, laid bare, and wonders at the part of her that wants to show him more.
The floor beneath the kitchen table was cold and unswept. Joanna knelt on stiff knees, her head tipped at an awkward angle as she burned her grandmother’s name into the wood.
Joanna turns from the window, but the other woman’s eyes are still fixed on the glowing screen of her mobile. “You didn’t just read about my grandmother in a file, did you? You knew her.”
The attic door slams shut behind her.
Gran nods. “I have one more.” She leans back in her chair, fingers steepled in front of her. She smiles a stranger’s smile, wide and hollow and white as chalk. “Botulinum toxin.”
“That’s it,” Joanna groans, pulling her upright. “You never get to call me an idiot again. Not after a stunt like that.” She helps her grandmother through the sitting room door and onto the nearest sofa. “You couldn’t just rip it to pieces or throw in it the fireplace like a normal person, could you? You had to be
His palm cups the top of her spine and she goes quiet, curled over her knees and breathing hard into the sudden silence. A seed embedded deep in the fibres of the mat at her feet sprouts delicate roots and a thin, spiked stem; Sherlock’s thumb brushes the sensitive skin behind her ear, and the thistle blooms.
Fire swallows her grandmother’s arm from elbow to fingertips, a pale, unnatural flame that spirals high in the air over her open hand and turns the letter to ash within seconds. Then the ashes themselves burn away, and the fire is gone. Gran’s arm falls to her side, and Joanna barely manages to catch her before she slumps to the floor, exhausted.
“Joanna,” he says, and she stops just inside the room. He sits stiff-backed against the headboard, his pale face framed by the long shadows the bedside lamp casts on the wall. She thinks of the wonder in his eyes when the warding spell touched him. The shape of his lips as he silently spoke her name. “If I asked,” he says, “would you tell me?”
Sherlock sits beside her, his eyes darting from her mangled arm to Moran to her gun and back again. She can almost hear the desperate speed of his whirring mind. “You exposed the bodies yourself,” he says to Moran. “Your victims. You wanted them found, wanted us to investigate, so you uprooted the tree with—”
, Mrs. Hudson. We had a strange encounter with the—” She stops and takes a breath. “He’s dangerous and he’s obsessed with Sherlock. We could be putting you at risk living here.”
“I’m sure you will,” Sherlock says, and whirls off towards the front door of 221. Joanna steps out onto the pavement and closes the door firmly behind her. The car drives away.
“So’s your face,” Joanna says cheerfully, and yanks hard on the door handle with the cold-numb fingers of her left hand. It opens, and the lights overhead blink on to reveal a long, narrow room piled high with boxes.
“Not really,” Gran says. She tips her head to one side. “Why? Was it funny?”
“Moriarty asked if I remembered the story of Agamede’s Mirror. I’d forgotten, but I knew I’d seen the name before – in Seostris’ burned arcana, and in
“I’d like to,” he says. “If you’d let me.”
to be sure you won’t fall into a Russian fishpond and freeze to death.”
Mycroft clears his throat, and they turn together to look at him. He leans forward and rests his elbows on the edge of his desk, amusement in the slight purse of his mouth. “When last we discussed the issue, Doctor Watson, you told us in no uncertain terms that the Craft was no longer a part of your life. May I ask what inspired this dramatic change of heart?”
She doesn’t open her eyes at first – instead she feels the car moving beneath her, smells the leather seats and the subtle sting of a man’s expensive aftershave, sitting close. The Chinese smugglers had knocked her out with a blow to the head and tossed her in a van, but this is a considerably more refined operation – a jet-injected dose of a fast acting sedative to the neck and a getaway in a bloody limousine.
The room is homely, small and simply furnished. The walls and floor are bare stone, the ceiling almost oppressively low, but the overstuffed bookcases and the warm light of the lamps make the space oddly welcoming. It reminds her of 221B when they’re in the midst of a case – books and open files covering every available surface, the walls papered with maps and photos and endless notes in Sherlock’s spiked handwriting. A rough rendering of his incredible mind, held together with pushpins and string.
She stands and begins to put away the shopping. “Sherlock, even if I only spent
? What can she—
Her fingers are clenched around the cane. “I do.”
She smiles. “Probably not for long,” she says, and follows him back to their flat.
He doesn’t look away from the mobile. “Sorry, can’t help – fucking off.”
He looks away, apparently fascinated by the neatly arranged surface of her dresser. The half-empty glass of water on her bedside table. His gaze shifts to the open window, to the fire escape and garden beyond. He takes a long breath through his nose, inhaling the scents of rosemary and yarrow, eyebright and asphodel.
“You thought it was Moriarty. That he’d got to me somehow.”
“Right,” Joanna says, under her breath. She takes the silver needle in her right hand, pinched between her thumb and forefinger, and holds her left out over the ground. Then she takes a deep, sun-warmed breath and stabs the needle into the centre of her palm.
“Sherlock will be furious when he finds out he missed this,” Joanna tells them from the study’s open door, watching Mycroft try to scowl at Mrs Hudson and chew at the same time. “If I weren’t incorporeal right now, I’d take pictures.”
, the smile says, and rage clenches like a living fist in Joanna’s chest. “Tell me one thing you remember about your grandmother.”
She turns.
She doesn’t always see him in his room. Sometimes if she goes to the attic too early on a Sunday morning she’ll see him staring bleary-eyed into his bathroom mirror, half-dressed and skinny and brushing his teeth; once or twice she catches a glimpse of him in the backseat of an expensive car, or walking along a busy street. He takes to carrying a compact mirror in his pocket, and with it he shows her snapshots – the delicate clockwork of a gutted pocket watch, an ill-tended garden, a perfect footprint preserved in dried mud. The solemn, high-ceilinged halls of his school, and the rusted labyrinth of pipes in its cellar.
“A decidedly old-fashioned style, one rarely worn by women of your age. Short hair would better fit your limited interest in the more time consuming aspects of personal grooming, but instead you grow it long – unusually long, and despite its relative health and thickness you never wear it loose. Every morning you wash, comb, and plait your hair, and every evening you plait it again before going to sleep. It’s more ritual than habit, and one you’ve kept for a very long time.” He pauses. “Since the day your mother was no longer able to do it for you, I imagine.”
The oak does not understand.
Moran stiffens a little. “Quite right. Time to soldier on.” He moves to press his hand palm down on the table. “I’m afraid I’ll need your gun for this next part, Joanna,” he says, and then with a terrible sucking sound the splinters collapse back into the table, ripping through the flesh of Joanna’s arm. Moran snatches the gun from her hand just before she falls to the floor, clutching her bleeding arm and biting back a scream.
“You wouldn’t,” Gran says, but the light blinks out a moment later. Joanna switches on her pocket torch and listens to her grandmother’s footsteps behind her. The soft click of her cane on stone steps. “Astrology is rubbish.”
“He’d be wasting his time with you, then,” Joanna says. “I’ll just pop down and tell him so, shall I?” She’s out of the room and down the stairs before Gran can answer. The stranger knocks again, just as she reaches the hall, and his arm is still raised when she opens the door.
, she thinks, and shoves the slip of paper into her coat pocket. It hardly matters – she knows what happened, and there’s nothing the police can do. Nothing she could tell Sherlock that would make him believe.
‘Hugh Boone,’ Bradstreet suggested blankly, his finger worrying his strawberry-blond moustache. ‘I agree, he’s not a pretty bugger, but I don’t think that a wee shower would be quite so useful as an interview.’
John chuckled. Christ, yeah, he did — fuck, it was going to be a long day, now complete with a white-tie disguise bait-and-switch, apparently.
‘What makes you assume that?’
‘I don’t bottom,’ John had enough wit to say honestly, while his fingers coaxed a twitch from beneath dark denim fabric. ‘Is that a problem.’
the bird hobbling in the street... So was that merely a coincidence? Was it the Alpha Pet Club itself that was the key, a thieves’ front for passing goods – but again, they would hardly have sold Flint to an outsider if the entire object was transport of items; and in any event, Flint had been hand-reared, and cared for as well as taught a variety of polyglot phrases – no, the shop was not the key either…

and shoe polish.
‘Sherlock, you can’t…’ He swallows the end of his own sentence, then swallows again. Sherlock doesn’t move. ‘Sherlock,’ he begins again, lowering the volume and tone of his voice, ‘I don’t forget this between – about us, what we… do–’ Sherlock scoffs minutely into his pillow. John breathes and shifts closer, so his next words raise the hairs on Sherlock’s forearm and elbow. ‘I don’t forget who I’m with – not just because you don’t let me, you git – you’re the most brilliant, big’ (he kisses Sherlock’s elbow) ‘-hearted’ (Sherlock scoffs again, but warmly, and a tiny twitch of a smile curves his mouth) ‘arrogant bastard I’ve ever, well, come across’ (Sherlock rolls his eyes behind his eyelids and John grins openly) ‘and I…’

His loss of a full stone (all right, 252 ounces at its worst) during his absence evidently upset John, just as his lack of ‘healthy’ eating or exercise or sleep had bothered him during their previous cohabitation.

‘Hello,’ John managed, a little thrown.
Now it was Holmes’s turn to glance my way, bemused. ‘Why, of course you are. I heard the small sighs and approving grunts that are the hallmarks of your experience of the more, shall we say,

Surely, all too soon, he would be balancing equations and composing and drafting scenarios of crimes they should be chasing mid-coitus, because his body craved John at all times, even when the abstract thought of it disgusted him. A contradiction no one but himself should be forced to live with. Already today, he had been unforgivably distracted from working to take down a monster of a criminal by the thought of John’s hands wrapped around his body. (What if, someday, he didn’t remember to say John’s name?)

Sherlock quirked a smile.
‘Yeah well.’ John shifted to stand up straighter, withdrawing into himself. ‘Suppose London should just be rejoicing that you made it back in such good time. Well done there.’ After a second he moved around Sherlock, hand mere centimetres away as he angled past, back to the kitchen where he stood with his back to him, but assuredly frowning down at the table. Deciding.
‘Yes,’ said Sherlock finally, and John hated how deep with memory his voice had gone. ‘I do know what you mean.’
‘It’s quite all right,’ Sherlock had informed her, through the licks.
‘You’ve been thinking about it,’ Sherlock plowed on, timbre deep. ‘You’ve been imagining it for weeks. You

‘Yeah, so. Anyway…’
‘I love you, Papagena,’ Ovid crooned merrily. Sherlock felt vaguely ill and strode rapidly into the kitchen.
. In any event, you also got an impressive array of magazines and newspapers, including several that you usually deem not only morally suspect but also wildly overpriced. Your salary nor your hours have increased at the clinic, and we did not make any substantial commission from the nonexistent million-pound reward from Mr Evans. Feeling generous, then, which is to say feeling extravagant beyond just general good spirits. Though you are a gambler by nature, you evidently felt it justified based on the expectation of soon-to-be attained earnings.

Dr. Dhawan came round the corner, starting and making a joke about wool-gathering, successfully jolting John back to himself. With a laugh he recognised as collegial but obviously forced, he made a nondescript remark and grabbed the packet he had supposedly come in for, kicking himself all the way back to his office.
It was possible that such a comment would not be appreciated, but, well, John continued to desire ‘honesty’ from him, and it was his ‘honest’ (and therefore accurate) expectation that John would find nothing but disappointment from the ne’er-do-well, perennially absent Harriet.

, he needed to leave.
Suddenly Sherlock stood and stepped two wide strides away; at the last second John caught himself, nearly face-planting into the cushion, as a cold, confused, furious sensation plummeted in his stomach and twisted. Sherlock, looking possibly homicidal, yanked his jacket into pristine order, and shouted –
He sniffed, waited for his stomach to settle. Slowly it shifted from churning to simply aching, but he made himself stand, ignoring the keening of his knees as he rose. On his feet again, he blinked. He scrubbed fiercely at his face with knuckled fingers, and ignored the water on his hands except to wipe it on his jeans.
‘ howled Suze, tears streaming down her face – a face he saw reflected in a glass display case as he crept ever closer to the fray. He just needed to get to Gruener before she made her move, ruining not just her own future freedom but everything they had risked, all the information they needed, from coming tonight.
(He ignored the superficial slight.)
Sherlock separated the (apparently) prosthetic graft from the towel and, putting the false mask on the cot with a toss, offered the now grimy cloth to the seated man. With a hooded look, St Clair eyed Sherlock, then took it.
. You know about her, and you know why the email didn’t get through.’
, Christ, it was warm and insistent and inseparable from his, and the high plaintive noise in his throat wasn’t
from somewhere nearby. Must change that text alert. Spotting it on the side table beside the microwave, he dried his hands and picked it up.
the two of them they hated each other, though now john had a better understanding of Sherlock's hatred for his brother, and just why hadn't they run when they had the chance? Why hadn't Sherlock taken Katherine after that and just gone far far away, and now that lunatic had her! a small helpless four year old girl!
John returned to the flat and was surprised at who had broken into the flat this time.
"If you're up to it, it sounds like fun." Katherine told him John nodded a bit unsure really Katherine took the cup of tea off the tray that was in the smaller cup that she assumed was for her, John lead Mrs. Hudson out for a minute
"Sherlock are you alright?" John asked him "you look like you're about to bust the window in half."
"John-"
John saw the spark of worry in Sherlock's eyes just for a brief instant but after Sherlock inhaled a bit he invited Mrs. Hudson in to sit down with some of the tea that he had John reheat Sherlock then took his cellphone and disappeared outside.
"Sorry, I just need to get ahold of him. Rosie's sick." Molly explained to her Sharon rolled her eyes a bit in disbelief, of course the brat would fake being sick when the date was going so well, she practically had John wrapped around her finger and the brat was going to ruin everything.
Six years, it had been six
"Moriarty has some heavy leverage over him and Mycroft that's causing them to work together to do crimes." John explained Irene nodded a bit bringing the tea cup to her lips and taking a sip of it leaving a ruby red lipstick stain on the cup. John watched her for a moment, he could tell she knew something he didn't something she was keeping to herself, he knew from the spark in her eyes. after a moment of silence between the two where John finally decided she wasn't gong to tell him until he asked her he let out a frustrated sigh
As John pulled up to his home that he had once shared with Mary and walked in he was trying to place the thought that he was forgetting
"Katherine is really sweet." John told him Sherlock looked down at him again John smiled John reached into his coat and pulled out a small drawing though it had a bit of blood on it "She told me she made this for you, she-she was going to give it to you when she got off the plane." John said smiling a bit Sherlock took it and unfolded it he couldn't stop the small smile that graced his features, it wasn't his usual false ones but he was actually smiling it was something that John rarely ever saw but was glad he did.
"Alright that's it, I got the letter that she escaped where is she?" Mycroft asked obviously angry Sherlock rolled his eyes at him
John couldn’t help tapping his fingers on the table nervously, he kept glancing at his phone waiting for the moment that Rosie figured out that they had set her up, the woman across from him was talking on about…. what
"So you figured this out yet?" Moriarty asked Sherlock was in no mood for games right now, two of the people who were important to him were missing and Moriarty thought that he was going to get away with playing like this
John looked at Mrs. Hudson then once he was sure Sherlock was out of ear shot
“I know, but I’ve got to save my dad he’s so terribly blind and these women he picks are no good and lord knows he has better taste than Lestrade does so whatever woman he’s set him up with is bound to be worse than anyone he could have found on his own.” Rosie told her dramatically slouching in her seat as she buckled her seatbelt and Irene couldn’t help but chuckle at the slight resemblance to Sherlock’s behavior it was obvious that they spent a lot of quality time together and knowing Sherlock’s eye for John it didn’t surprise her
when Sherlock opened it he noticed that ever time the words "Star crossed lovers" appeared it was high lighted in different colored highlighters. Sherlock snapped the book closed, he didn't need to be a genius to know who had left the book or who had taken John.
there was the sound of the two men shouting and something hitting the floor above their heads, John sighed and ran his hand through his hair Mrs. hudson smiled
“You went through my phone Rosamund,” Sherlock told her Rosie opened her eyes and smiled up at him
"Yes."
"Daddy he hit me!" there was that anger again. Blood pumping furiously but Sherlock took a deep breath attempting to hold it off. Moriarty would get what was coming to him. Sherlock would see through to it.
"Yes you will I promise Mycroft and I will come to get you and then you can come home and rest." Mycroft looked like he was about to protest but sherlock threw the pillow at him
"It's my blog!"
Sorry for the unneeded explanation!!!
that was what he was forgetting. John smiled as he walked over and put down the bag of vegetables on the table in front of Rosie and Molly, John had decided himself that he was ready to start dating a while ago but whenever he tried it never worked out and he would decide that maybe he wasn't ready and every time he had the told Rosie that he would be going out with a woman and she never seemed to mind but this time the date was set before the conversation and John felt like maybe this time he should actually talk to his little girl this time.
Careful to mind the door, John came in as silently as he could, shut the door behind him, and all but fell back against it.
, he told himself savagely.
The knock on the door followed by the entry of one of the temps who handed him a patient intake form, ‘Mr. Summerson,’ then in a low, dramatically disgusted hiss, ‘
‘May I present,’ said Sherlock with furious triumph, ‘Mr Neville St Clair.’
Not a military or public safety investigation, that was more than obvious. Not a murder, or he would not have been able to laugh earlier (he was not so cold-blooded as either Mycroft or himself); nor, for the same reason, was this ‘friend’ merely a fiction to cover up one of his own indiscretions. Almost certainly Gruener had jilted, blackmailed, swindled, or (most likely) beguiled a twenty-something duchess (upper-class, naturally) whose self-destructive tendencies were not new but likely to result in a chain reaction of public scandal and private shame. More importantly, Gruener had already killed twice — four times, if you counted the dead newspaper reporter in Denmark, plus the ostensibly unrelated Parisian private investigator Gerrard Le Brun who no longer enjoyed the use of his legs (Sherlock counted both incidents). So far, Gruener had not seen his name officially linked to any crime whatsoever.
John’s expression immediately coalesced into understanding, which was so infuriating that Sherlock fleetingly considered shouting and storming out (was that reaction now solely acceptable when John did it?). He bit down the impulse, squirmed, hating the slithering, too-soft, too-silky, merlot-coloured dressing gown; his long hair curling and wisping where it most needed to be cut; the distant rumble of hunger in his gut,
As Mycroft incrementally slid the wheel round, Sherlock dared not spare another look at John. His strained, downturned mouth and weary eyes made Sherlock concerned that he was concealing something, that he had drawn into himself as a way of recoiling from something akin to a punch (
‘We’ll get this right, y’know,’ John told him, in a familiar
But… he went through his mental calendar: that must have been only, what? Three days before Sherlock had shown up? Stiff-limbed and exhausted, Sherlock had made his grand re-entry into John’s world, 26 months and eight days after he’d died, and any thought of rings or other lives had been shoved violently, joyfully from John’s mind. They had gone back to Baker Street, caught up in a case (but, more deeply, in each other) and he’d barely wanted to sleep or even breathe at the wrong moment for fear it would all come crashing down. He’d been too numb even to be relieved not to have to invent a fake reason to end it with his sort of-fiancée/soon-to-be-not girlfriend. His mind (his heart (his bed)) had been too full of Sherlock to give much space to anyone else.
‘I don’t doubt it.’
‘Easy
, he nodded once to the hovering waiter across the dining room to speed things along.
With a growl that made a passing flutist – recently broken up with her boyfriend, she ended it; off to a practice session with a fellow Academician, a cellist who fancied her; worried about upcoming travel expenses; slightly hungover from too much white wine – glance at him in alarm, he punched a reply. His hands were shaking.
They kiss for another moment, until Sherlock tucks his arms in between them and nestles closer into his pillow, eyes shutting.
It twisted in his gut, the wrong-footedness of this whole conversation: they had planned — John had been clearly thinking all day about it, even bought extra supplies in a very conspicuous, self-defeatingly ‘subtle’ dark plastic bag — this morning he had looked at Sherlock like he wanted to ravish him in their sitting room where
, Sherlock had said; with a shiver, John imagined simply cornering Sherlock against the living room door and kissing him into a withering mess who confessed to everything, including how wonderful it had been and how great it would be to give a second go…
Mycroft raised an auburn eyebrow, quirking his head to lift it even higher. No doubt the imbecility of his operatives, the high cost of overtime, the poor intelligence and the personnel reshuffling were whirling in his bureaucratic brain. Sherlock had no energy to wait on attendance for his brother to break the silence, and so broke it instead.
‘Ah.' John's face did something complicatedly inauspicious. 'Right. Well, plans are for amateurs, aren't they? I’m sure we could just turn up: not like there’s a chance of an ambush. He won’t have big guards with guns or dogs or anything. D’you know, I think you’re on to something.’
He couldn’t help it — he barked a laugh — but he punctuated it with a twist of his hand, sparking Sherlock’s prostate again, sending a jolt down Sherlock’s leg that curled his toes. Sherlock’s prick was caught underneath him, even more neglected than John’s (which was finding some maddening level of friction leaking onto Sherlock’s leg), squished between Sherlock’s stomach and the sheet and no doubt leaving a wet spot that he’d be making John lie in later, the bastard.
‘And yet you are surprised,’ he murmured to the apparition, checking ‘Expedited shipping’.
‘Horner,’ corrected John, expressionlessly.
The small eyeroll of annoyance that belied a smile was the most encouraging thing John’d seen all day. Instead he came close, fingers absent-mindedly picking at a frayed thread.
