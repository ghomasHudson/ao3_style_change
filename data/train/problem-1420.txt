Instead of outing his partner then and there he called out, “We’ll be off out in a minute. I need to talk to Sherlock.”
have been a burst of earth-shattering love in his abdomen for this man, but John doesn’t let it show outwardly; no matter how honoured Sherlock is, it doesn’t mean he’s ready for John to pledge his undying devotion. He merely lowers his head and kisses him, come breath and all.
“Wait!" John called out when Sherlock turned tail and ran from the room. He turned to follow but Mary yanked him back.
She shifts in her chair slightly, looks up from the laptop and smiles. "It's a bit...well...it's a bit gay, isn't it?"
When he does, it’s with a casual grace, calculated to the inch, conveying clearly that he’s not bothered in the least by the previous silence. He holds his mobile in one hand, texting as he shrugs his coat off and tosses it to the sofa.
John laughed above him. “You’re in the wet spot,” he informed Sherlock, as if he didn’t already know.
“Oh.” Mrs. Hudson breathed softly. “Ohh.” She looked down at the drawings like he’d sketched a basket of puppies.
"Hold up," Donovan announced. "He's been in the system before for assault and he's on parole for involvement with the Chechen Mafia."
John can see then where the boy gets his curiosity. For purely selfish reasons, and maybe a bit of boredom, John affects an American accent, “Ah, no, I don’t. Gotta find a woman to stick around long enough first.”
Her eyes went wide and her hand came up, but before she could remark, John was already leaning over in his seat far enough to sock Sherlock in his shoulder, hard enough to nearly eject him from his chair.
Sherlock thought if he were shot dead right then, he’d still be quite satisfied with the way things had gone. Until John confidently cupped the hard length of him in his trousers, because at that point Sherlock decided there was much he had yet to accomplish.
battle of wills, both men tilting their chins, pursing lips, or raising eyebrows in a language they’d developed as children.
“No, I’m sure they do too, it’s just I wouldn’t think wool would be their biggest export. Why not move to the highlands if you’re going to raise sheep?”
Sherlock was not, by any stretch of the imagination, a patient man but he could on occasion remain patient enough to stalk prey like the best of predators. It took nearly three months for John to stop looking over his shoulder and checking his chair before he sat before he’d take a cup of tea Sherlock handed him. Just enough time for Sherlock to formulate and put his plan into motion.
John’s hand slid down Sherlock’s concave stomach, just a whisper of contact over his straining erection, before he ghosted down.
of it,” Sherlock replied, the innuendo making John’s eyebrows climb toward his hairline.  “You had best pray there aren’t any of your cameras in my bedroom, Mycroft, because I plan on doing the ill-advised all night and well into the morning.”
“Oh, John, this is so sweet of you. I haven’t been to the carnival in years!” Scarlett chirped excitedly by his side as he fished out the cash for their tickets.
John glanced away from the coffee table to catch Sherlock scowling at him. He scrunched his nose at that, as if
"Mary, dear," Mrs. Hudson greeted sweetly. "Top off?" She jiggled the bottle of hundred quid scotch.
“Oh.” Though pacified, he could feel himself going red. “I- I’ve imagined it. But never… no, never tried.”
“There’s nothing to be upset over, you silly thing. I had a beau do the same for me once upon a time. It’s quite romantic.”
Sherlock's eyes flashed open, he gasped, and then promptly spent all over the eight hundred quid suit. John had never been so proud.
"Mmm," Sherlock mused as he ran his fingertips up John's sides, "Maybe condoms would be best. No clean up. And perhaps they'd help with your ability to last any significant amount of time."
Sherlock turned so he could see John through the Tyvek hood. “Shut the door, I’m trying to keep the temperature regulated.”
“You know, you look ready to pop already,” John remarked casually. “Maybe I should skip this bit.” Sherlock let John know what he thought of that suggestion with a look. “Okay killer, calm down, was only kidding.”
Laila closed in on him after that, arms wrapped around his neck, and she graciously let him have a nervous breakdown and hitch brokenly into her hair. He wasn’t crying, not exactly. Just…releasing tension.
“Sherlock Holmes, what are you up to, making all that ruckus?” She demanded; stern, motherly scowl in place despite the fact that she was not so secretly looking at John in hope.  Did she see his potential as well?
“You should have come back sooner,” he answers but it’s in a softer tone, as if he’s talking a gun out of John’s hand.
Things had gone well, despite all logic. It lifted Sherlock’s spirits like no needle full of opiates had ever done, seeing John trust him so explicitly. There was still work to be done, he knew that, but in that moment, with John’s pleasant, warm voice drifting up from the stairs, everything was perfect.
He used his free hand to pull John up higher, kneeling instead of sitting, so Sherlock could reach him comfortably with his mouth. Saliva welled up at the sight of him, so thick, perfectly fitted for Sherlock’s hand. He couldn’t remember ever being this affected, it was truly unprecedented, and he might have liked time to process it fully, but that’s what made it so unprecedented. He didn’t care one wit to wait.
Sherlock simply stared back. John waited through several rapid fire blinks, Sherlock’s surprise apparent in the otherwise blank canvas. The man eventually licked his lips and muttered, “That doesn’t- No. How could- But you never…”
“Sure,” John agrees. “You leave me any hot water?” He stares at the telly like Masterpiece Theater has him riveted.
“Had an awful day today. Dr. Brooke is out this week and she’s shifted a dozen of her worst patients onto me. Still angry about that incident at the café I assume. By rights you should be giving jabs and consoling the elderly since that was all your fault to begin with. Christ, Sherlock, you’ve got sugar all over the counter,” he snapped as he set his hand down in the grainy bits. He smacked his hands together over the sink and scowled at the mess. White trails of it all over faded lino as if he’d jammed a spoon in and flung it without care into his mug, which was precisely what had happened judging by the cold cup that sat at his flatmates elbow. “This is how we get ants you know. You could show a bit more care.” He did a poor job of sliding what he could into the sink but the mess was extensive; bits of it kept falling off the side of the counter onto the floor.
John snorted, which sent a gust of warm air across Sherlock’s nipple, which then peaked with the stimulation, even as unintended as it had been. He ignored it.
“You’re the one with the lust for violence. I’m just sorry everything didn’t erupt into a melee of baseball bats and broken beer bottles.”
“No…it’s just…we met at a party,” John finished lamely, blinking at the back of the chair he’d vacated minutes before.
John placed alternatively soft and wet kisses against his skin, the tip of his nose brushing the hair of his thigh with each pass. Sherlock’s cock, which had lost its vigour, perked back up at the attention to his lower half. Shivers raced up and over Sherlock’s skin at the lightest touches, raising gooseflesh and the hair of his arms. He couldn’t wait to to do the same for John, to explore his body in the same way.
He deflated. “Yes. I haven’t had a proper case in weeks. That bit with the,” he waved his hand, “what do you call it? With the sticks and the horses?”
John went on without him. “I’ve been thinking about that a lot actually, how, if you’d just let me show you, you’d see how much better I’d gotten since the first time.”
They'd not really brought up John's past sexual history before but if Sherlock wanted to know he would be honest with him. "Yes."
It was almost a surprise to see but he’d drawn the two of them at St. Bart's, from John’s perspective, with Sherlock as a small figure atop the building. Here John was the one crying, little broken hearts scattered throughout. Seeing such a childish rendition of that tragic day did nothing to lessen the blow.
"Why did I talk him into the long con?" Sherlock nodded. "Simple. I was curious. You can understand that, right?"
John shook his head with a chuckle but then he smiled up at Sherlock, close-lipped but with openly friendly eyes, and motioned for them to continue on into the clinic.
Sherlock was well on his way to unconsciousness at that point, barely able to conjure up the will to respond, but he did. Perhaps he was dreaming after all, what did it matter?
John melted against him, and Sherlock wrapped him up in his arms to pull them down against the mattress. Sherlock unfortunately slipped free during the manoeuvre.
“Um.” Sherlock licked his lips, fairly certain he knew what John was asking but nervous to reply in case he was mistaken.
infuriating.” He slid his hand further back and gripped Sherlock’s curls a bit more forcefully. “But you’re also ridiculously sexy.” He lowered his head to nip at Sherlock’s neck, causing a soft inhale. “And delicious,” he muttered, moving further down. He licked a bit of his own come from Sherlock’s chest before returning to look Sherlock in the eye. “So maybe I wouldn’t have left.”
John growls, clutching at his towel like he might use it as a garrote. Several consecutive calls for help fall on deaf ears, so John sucks it up and jerkily wraps the towel around his waist.
“Mary…she put me together again. Not whole, not like before, but enough. She kept me alive when nothing else could, kept me going until you could return and I’ll always be grateful to her for that. Now she’s between us, or at least I’ve been telling myself that she was keeping me from you. But that’s not true, is it?”
“If it makes you feel any better, I've already talked to Daniel and he's spread the word not to sell to Sherlock."
Sherlock smiled down at him. "I wouldn't have been." John scowled at him. Of all the smart arse things to say at a time like this... "
John turned an interesting shade of red and pointed sharply at Sherlock through the window. “You shut your trap! I’ll deal with you in a moment.”
The flat was semi-lit, only the fire in the hearth giving off enough light to see by. John was nowhere to be found but evidence of his residence was obvious - shoes and coat by the door, take-away still sitting on the coffee table, he’d even brought the scotch out from the cupboard. Sherlock tried not to read into any of the evidence left behind, but if he were able to turn it off he’d not be half the man he was.
“What? At all? C’mon, there’s got to be something you enjoyed? Collecting frogs out by the lake on your family estate? The butler telling stories of the haunted stable? Being invited to country fetes down in the village where Sara, the barmaid, winked and pulled you into a reel?”
“Yes,” he answers. Jefferson, he remembers, was the quiet sort, no one knew him well, but he was in his third deployment and hadn’t ever given anyone cause to think he’d snapped. Therefore, in John’s mind, it was an accident. “I didn’t find out until after that he was-
“You know,” John said conversationally, “I had a girlfriend once, years ago, who was a photographer-“
John snickered and let a small dragon’s puff of smoke out. His limbs were already feeling heavy, his thoughts just a little bit lighter. Mrs. Hudson had some premium stuff. He toed off his shoes to get properly comfortable and then made a mental reminder not to take any more of his clothes off.
“Why do you care?” He had to ask. It wasn’t like Sherlock to ask after the local populace, unless it pertained to a case. Of which, granted, John had only been a part of a few, but it still seemed strange.
John leans forward in his chair and laughs. He shifts some more chicken over to Sherlock's plate. "What an idiot." Sherlock shrugs as if that were a given and takes the offering without comment. "Why didn't anyone hear him call for help?"
Sherlock wordlessly eyed him as he crawled up into the man’s lap, settling there. They looked at each other, both breathing hard, sweating profusely, and flushed from hairline to toes, and finally smiled.
His bedroom door was ajar, and since John felt honor bound to check on his pseudo-patient, he made his way down the hall.
“Right, I’ll check on you later then.” He waited briefly for a response that didn’t come. He closed the door behind him; leaving John in blessed dark and semi-silence.
They shuffled until Sherlock was against the pillows, John stretched out along his right side. It seemed John was simply enjoying the view, until he closed his eyes with a chuckle, forehead to Sherlock’s chest.
John was kissing Sherlock’s throat as they came back down, and it occurred to him then and there that lovemaking didn’t end with orgasm. He could continue loving and being loved by John as long as he wanted. He tilted his head back down to get at John’s lips again, feeling such an immense welling of love pour out he might as well start writing bad poetry.
“Your superiority stems from growing up with a sister who ignored most common social cues,” Sherlock stated after looking him up and down.
“Well that’s just not true. You went back to Dr. Thompson prior your wedding to tell her you were having second thoughts-”
“Mycroft would approve, I can assure you,” Laila tried to convince him, shaking his shoes impatiently.
"On it," Donovan chirped and dove into the car to type it into the system. She came back a minute later with an address.
They nodded and walked casually back to Greg’s car. Sherlock gallantly, by rote at this point, held the door open for him and John slid silently into the beat seat. He waited until the door closed before pulling Sherlock down for a hard kiss.
“Park it in my office, I’ll be back in a second,” Greg motioned vaguely at his office and walked away.
"No mystery there. It would have taken him eight minutes to bleed out, torn as he's managed to get himself. The shrubs acted as a sound dampener and he must have just had the unfortunate luck of maiming himself when no one was around to hear him cry out."
He blinked. “It’s just…it doesn’t make any sense. Why deny there being a thing to begin with? He has to know what I want. If he even remotely cared, why would he turn me down?”
“Victor,” Sherlock’s voice crooned with an almost believable softness, “please. I did want to see you. I feel badly for how things ended.”
And here came the begging. Always more with him, that's how it started. As if three fingers wasn't enough to get him off.
“You utter shit!" John cried. "I thought I was going to have to move out and then I thought I was going to have to blow you to stay. You fucking arsehole.”
"This plan is insane but it's better than nothing," Greg muttered. "All right, I'll take John first, he's gonna be the hardest to convince."
He nodded gently, saying he understood, though he was a bit curious as to the exact meaning. He watched, spellbound as John wrapped a wet hand around his own prick, moaning all the while, and then he lowered himself down. A hand came down to brace himself by Sherlock’s side and then he lay himself flush against Sherlock’s arse and immediately started to roll his hips.
In a blur, Sherlock was on him. John put up a valiant fight, but his biceps were neatly pinned to the door in seconds and Sherlock was upon him, bent low and then...
The line would be closing soon. The carriage had been empty for some time when a lone passenger got on and sat directly across from John. He knew who it was before he even sat, before the Yves Saint Laurent shoes slid out to nearly touch with John’s brown brogues.
He then completed the reign of terror by saying, “What terrible thing would happen, do you think, if I kissed you right now?”
“You won’t regret it, John,” he said as he opened the door. “The Tiger Palace is notorious for their chicken stir-fry. For underground Mahjong tournaments too but I don’t think you’re ready for that.”
It took Sherlock less than a second to process how she’d managed to butcher the equation this time. His arm fell over the side of the chair, the page fell to the floor, and he let his head fall back against the leather cushion. He sighed so hard his fringe trembled.
“Let’s get started,” he suggested, “shall we?”  Sherlock gestured for John’s to bring his bag closer.
hesitate. Okay?" She starts to shake her head in denial but he interrupts. "Whatever reasons you think you have, trust me, they don't matter. Not when regret will follow you for the rest of your days. Do you understand? Don’t
He immediately shook his head. "God no. He did try to make a break for it but I nabbed him on the way out. I'm not letting him out of my sight until we see this through."
“You won’t. He’ll have you running every day for the next fifty years, until your bones are too brittle to go on.”
The crook of his arm itched. Instinctively he moved to scratch it but what he ended up doing was smacking his flatmate on top of the head.
Sherlock, to John’s surprise, started laughing. “Only my pride. I had it for a second, though, didn’t I?”
John seemed to think this was comical.  He turned his head away and Sherlock could see the shake of his shoulders, indicating suppressed laughter. He told himself he wasn’t the least bit affected by it.
John glances over to find Miller glaring at him. He very much wants to give him a two fingered salute, but holds off in favour of following Sherlock back to his rental. Surprisingly, the keys are thrown by Mitch into Sherlock’s hand and they’re left completely free to drive off into the night.
He really should have seen it coming, but he's still surprised when he hears a nervous cough behind him.
“I know enough,” Sherlock responds. “And anyway, you have even less reason to trust me and yet here you are.”
John spit like a cat, angry and puffed up but didn’t immediately take off when Sherlock let go, so he jumped to his explanation.
been upended, he was just thankful he remembered the basics of French kissing, because John had engaged without much warning. And it was bloody
“You mean…” He frowns. It seems so straightforward but for some reason John’s having a hard time believing it.
Sherlock dropped onto the bed like his strings had been cut, before John could even reach him. He seemed to wait patiently for further instructions.
By the time Sherlock returned it was after sundown. A car pulled up outside and yelling could be heard through the window.
She flinched but blinked rapidly as she gathered her thoughts. “Um, his name’s Daniel Kaminski. They broke up a week ago. She said it was mutual and I believed her. They hadn’t been dating long and it didn’t seem to be going anywhere, so I assumed he didn’t care. He wasn’t weird about it, you know, not like a guy who wanted to kidnap her would be. He didn’t bug her or show up at her work or anything.”
John laughs and looks away. Sherlock is casually glancing at his fingernails, which means until John looked over he was watching the conversation. Of course he was.
“Nothing,” he announced casually. “Are you saying you think it’s too sudden, then? Moving in, helping me with cases? Or is it because we became intimate? Because I’m of the opinion that we work well, in all areas.”
It was slow in coming, John could barely hear it, but it came, audible enough to give John a chill at its deep resonance. Laila didn’t seem satisfied,  seemed to demand more or possibly clarification. Sherlock’s answering hiss was given a nod of approval. Laila marched back to John, took his hand and lead him towards his coat and shoes.
“I calculated a seventy-four percent chance you’d put your old clothes back on. I like being surprised.”
Sherlock gracefully stepped out of the cab as it rolled to a stop, not bothering to wait for John to follow. Lestrade frowned at John but met them and waved for Sherlock to follow him into the building.
“Got this done almost a year ago,” he explained and began to shrug off his jacket and roll up the sleeves of his jumper to showcase the tattoo on his shoulder, the one that Sherlock already knew was there.
"Just shut up, would you? That's not," he took a deep breath and laughed, "forget the costume. If you want to know the truth...I'm scared."
"I wouldn't have need to fret if you'd not agreed to marry a gun wielding psychopath in the first place," Sherlock muttered as he held his bunched up tie to John's wound.
He shifted forward again, sliding his hands under Sherlock’s thighs to heft them up and over his shoulders. Sherlock grunted at the maneuver but didn’t comment, just hooked his ankles and let John slip his hands underneath to grip his arse.
Once back at Baker Street, Sherlock flopped down onto the sofa with his newly purchased Bond DVD, and grinned. John loved Bond, he remembered hearing so just recently, though the information had seemed superfluous at the time. He wasn’t sure why John enjoyed the films, having not actually seen one himself, but he was willing to give it a try. Maybe he’d find references to inaccurate MI6 intel that he could casually point out was wrong. John would love that.
“John,” a rumbling voice calls from the loo and John starts, hand flying away from his groin like it’s on fire.
"They've got him trapped in the ship yard. The only way out is the river and his hands are still cuffed but he managed to snag a nightstick off Daniels before he ran off."
John rushed down the hall, burst through the door to the stairwell, and flew down nearly every step until he reached the fourth floor. Before he even reached Colby’s room he could see a long black, possibly wool, coat hanging on the hook outside her door.
With less thought than he would to make tea, John gets up, grabs the laptop, and walks the short distance to the sitting room.
“This,” he squeezed and then swatted the meat in his grasp. “You are unbelievably sexy and I’d like to preserve this moment.
Minutes later, Lestrade and Donovan arrived with the police in tow. Sherlock stood aside and let John and Ms. McCurdy explain the details. Donovan took notes and Lestrade glanced at Sherlock, knowing he was doing his damnedest not to get roped into going to the police station for interrogation.
They weren’t bad, objectively. Accurate at the very least. It was the softness of Sherlock’s portrayal of John, the obvious love he’d suffused the images with, that had given him away. Any artist worth their salt could tell he’d caressed the shaded areas of John’s face with his fingertips much longer than necessary.
“There, that’s better,” John soothed. He enjoyed the way Sherlock gripped the edge of the desk for support, the white of his knuckles accenting the flush of his skin beautifully, the desperation in his grasp. The play of muscles in his back was especially beautiful, what of them he could see beneath the ruined button down. John did his absolute best to concentrate on the small things, certainly not the hot, hot heat surrounding his prick or the sight of himself disappearing inside. If he so much as glanced down it would be all over. It didn’t help that he already knew what it looked like, so really squeezing his eyes shut was doing nothing to help.
Molly watched Mary watching Sherlock. Something about her body language was off. But when Mrs. Hudson rushed over to the bar, Molly got distracted and followed.
Sherlock blinked slowly as John put a hand to his forehead and cheek to feel for a fever, in case he had gotten sick from being out in the cold.
Just before Mary closed the door, as Mrs. Hudson started pleading her case, she caught Janine with her ear to the door where her husband was having a go at his best man.
he going to do now? He had unwittingly been letting her steer his life for the last year, with school and friends and that, and now that he was free the only thing that leapt out at him was…
“Now if we could just get you to work on staying focused on cases instead my cock, we’d have ourselves a genuine breakthrough.” He laughed as he bent to pick up Greg’s spilled pens and pencils.
“You still got the cuffs?” Miller eventually asks, looking put out at not being able to shoot them right off.
“That was ridiculous,” John announces with another snicker, runs a hand through his hair, and smiles at the ceiling of the rental.
“And then you left.” He closes his eyes and sees it as vividly as he has for the last two years, since the day it happened, and his heart clenches all over again. He knows tears were now rimming his eyes but, hell, Sherlock isn’t looking anyway.
“You’re secretly relieved by your girlfriend cheating. You were waiting on a better excuse than the issues you were already having to break it off. What was it? She pressured you to change majors even though you just started Uni? Yes. You were pre-med. Strange, her not being satisfied with that…  Ah, she wanted a political figure for a husband. Didn’t believe you could pull off being a doctor. Made you switch to poli-sci with her so she could groom you for office. With the added bonus of keeping a closer eye on you so she could pursue her much larger, meatier side project; one of your rugby teammates if I’m not mistaken. Tsk tsk. You’ll be feeling the sting of that for a while. At least if he were smaller you could have cracked his skull, am I right? ”
That remark earned Sherlock a bloody lip. His head snapped back, pain blooming bright, making the situation more real somehow.
A family of four pulls in beside him, and the lot of them pile out, loud and clearly hungry. John smiles at the son, likely about four, who stands next to his dad, staring up at John in the unrestrained way children his age do.
“And you obviously don’t care what I think. What on Earth would lead you to believe I’d want to come back with you after that?”
“I’m never not going to be thinking about this, at least on some level. You’re just going to have to deal with the consequences.”
A weary sigh travelled the line and then a droll voice responded, “I should have gotten you both a dog for Christmas. A bloodhound or a spaniel perhaps. It would have saved me time and energy.”
“Hairline fracture,” he informed. “I told them it was lucky, considering… well never mind. Doc says it should heal quickly as long as I don’t punch anyone or anything else.”
He bit down just a bit harder before letting up the pressure, soothed over the mark with his lips before moving over and biting again. Oh, how incredibly satisfying it was, to feel that taught bit of flesh give just a tiny bit against his teeth. Sherlock took several ragged breaths above him.
John blows toward the loo so fast Clara's braids swing as he goes by. She looks like she might follow but her friend calls out and she must have gone to her instead because John makes it to the toilet unmolested.
“No, see, we finished between the two of us,” Sherlock explained, waving and lisping adorably. “Two people finishing one bottle is… not… bad. Simple maths. See?”
Sherlock didn’t care, Mrs. Hudson couldn’t see them like that. She’d get the wrong idea and never shut up. He desperately tossed his sleep wear off and traded it in for the standard, solidly comforting, suit. John grumbled to himself in the sitting room, words vague but obviously complaining of his decision to drink the night before. Hopefully he’d be hazy on the details on how he’d been woken up.
Sherlock made a study of looking as innocent as possible. John needn’t worry on that score; he radiated
“I certainly never had but I’m glad you brought it up. I’ll have a talk with my brother, see if he can’t insure that production never comes to fruition.”
“Hey, Watson!” Someone called from behind. He waited for them to catch up rather than turn and look. His neck had cramped from passing out in the backseat of some bloke’s car the night before.
“Now you get over here and pull the piece of carbon fiber out of the cuff of my shirt,” Sherlock whispers, turning so his back is to John, his cuffed hands out.
John burst into a fit of giggles, and like that, the tension of the previous minutes was gone. Sherlock hid a grin with the turn of his head.
, John’s cock shouts. When a bit of rational returns to his brain, a bit, John stares up at the wall, the hideous painting beside the bed, and asks, “What?”
“Yes. Perhaps join the RAMC after I receive my degree,” John answered hesitantly, still looking to Sherlock and back.
John watched as Sherlock's eyes lit up in excitement, pride in his own deductions, whatever they were. He smiled at John briefly but then he was off again, stalking into the bedroom. A C.S.I. member scuttled out seconds later in fear and John snickered.
John stared in confusion. “Client?” He drawled the question, working it out. “So, you’re like…a P.I.?”
Mycroft hung up and John stared at the phone. If Sherlock’s brother was worried, John was worried. He’d called as a precaution - maybe Mycroft had already known Sherlock’s whereabouts and could settle John’s panic - but now, now John was beside himself.
"Greg!" Molly hissed. She looked around to make sure no one but herself and Mrs. Hudson had overheard. They were pretty secluded from the rest of the wedding party, under a shady tree in the front garden, while the rest finished pictures.
“I’ll be the judge of that,” John bellowed back, trying for stern but it was more likely he found Sherlock’s tantrum humorous. Seconds later the front door slammed.
"What do you mean-" Sherlock started to ask, clearly offended, until John made quick work of his zip and tugged Sherlock's cock free. "Agghhhhh."
“I honestly don’t know where these numbers are coming from. My roommate quoted it at a hundred this morning. It’s mortifying.”
“All right, Harry?” He gave a cursory greeting before jumping right in. “I’ve got a question, do you remember the name of the first bloke I ever kissed?”
I'm in the midst of a nervous breakdown over the last chapter tbh, so apologies if it takes a while to get to you fabulous people. I wanted it to be finished by now, but life and creative differences with the characters has gotten in the way lately. Sherlock seems to think it's okay to angst the shit out of this story and I'm doing my best to wrangle him... It's not going well. One thousand apologies, I'll have it to you as soon as I can.
“Normally I wouldn’t advocate this, but… you ignore it.” She dropped her hands into her lap in frustration. “He’s just talking shit. He’s scared, John. Everytime he fucks up and you get mad he loses a little bit more confidence. I can tell. I mean, the cough medicine incident, c’mon.”
“I suppose. Threw most of it up in the bushes there,” he motioned at the hedges surrounding the front of the building, “where we found him lying face down in it. You can probably skip hospital but that’s your prerogative. If his brother catches wind of this, Sherlock will be hung out to dry.”
The answer to that was beyond John at the moment. “I don’t know if he’d let me even try right now. Maybe tomorrow after he’s cooled down.”
“Christ, Sherlock, really?” He roared incredulously over the sound of the sudden arrival of the helicopter. “In front of the Mobster?”
“Lovely,” John grumbles. He sets the lot of it back down on the bed and instead reaches for the telly remote.
The vendor shoved an enormous bear at John, who stumbled back at the unexpected weight, and hitched a thumb for them to go. John laughed, sort of proud of himself actually. He was glad he’d stopped at Scarlett’s suggestion.
He watches the road, still wary of cartel members. John wants to trust Sherlock when he says they won’t be a problem anymore but that doesn’t mean the danger has completely passed. Like he said himself, he's is a genius but he’s not infallible.
, an internal voice whispered, but he ignored it in favour of wrapping an arm around her. As terrible as he knew it was, she was damn beautiful and if he could just get her into bed at least once...
John in respite was a softer thing, and yet the tiny line between his brows remained, as though he dreamt of Sherlock making a mess in the kitchen. Sherlock smiled to himself at the thought. The often called upon edge of John’s jaw took shape, the dip of his chin, the thin slash of his mouth. Here Sherlock stopped to study a bit longer than was decent but with John asleep and none the wiser it was hard to curb the desire.
Sherlock finally snapped out of his surprise and rushed forward. “John! John, John stop.” He yanked at John’s shoulders, desperate to get him away before he killed the man.
Even stranger still, John didn't receive a Christmas gift from Sherlock. Maybe that would have seemed too obvious, John mused. They had both left for Christmas break and come home to even worse moods than what they’d left in, which was saying something. Previous to Christmas, John had tried to be sensitive to Sherlock’s addictions, possibly overcompensating with an overly sunny disposition after the gut wrenchingly awful...no…he wasn’t going to dwell on that, he’d done that enough after the fact, replayed that moment over and over in the last few weeks-
He felt the answering snort from John. “Yes,” he nibbled some more at the fleshy bit of his shoulder, “delicious, you are.”
"I'll let you in on a little secret," he pulled at Sherlock's belt until he took the hint and lifted up enough for John to get his hands underneath, "not everything we do is for your specific enjoyment." He tugged the leather until it was loose enough to work Sherlock's trousers and pants down over his lush behind, and admittedly felt a little self satisfied when he threw them into a heap beside the bed.
"Oh yeah, I'm mad at you, husband. Such a shocking development, never thought you'd do this, yadda yadda yadda."
“Stupid,” he muttered to himself, opening the front cover, flipping through the pages until he reached the damning evidence that had ruined everything.
“John, stop. John! Seriously, stop,” he begged, clutching at John’s head in near panic, doing his best to scoot up the bed and away.
, was it? What happens when dopaminergic input from the VTA modulates the activity of neurons within the nucleus accumbens?”
The father looks down at his son and then over to where the boy’s pointing. “Oh, leave the guy alone, Jake,” he mumbles, clearly used to the boy’s curiosity. “Jen, take the kids inside while I finish pumping, they’re at it already.”
“Been told it burns like hell at first but they’re always crying for more by the time I’m done with ‘em.”
Sherlock knew well the impact words had on the human psyche, but John had turned the particular torture into an art form.
"Finally," Sherlock snapped. Sally rolled her eyes but followed without comment as they made their way into the building. Greg met them at the top of the landing to the third story, and motioned them inside.
Sherlock took a deep breath and, without breaking from John’s stare, said, “I don’t believe Mrs. Hudson has ever used a tampon. Before her time, as it were. Isn’t that right?” He then looked up at her as if he’d asked ‘Do you use oregano in your pasta sauce?’
The bloke twitched and hiccupped as John pulled away with a last lick. He took the liberty of laying his head against a surprisingly muscular thigh. They both breathed deep in the near silence of the room.
Something in him snapped. Christ, here John was, letting him off the hook, and all he could think was - why? It was obvious. It had to be, Mrs. Hudson had spelled it out for him as plain as day, and yet, John, in his infinite capacity for burying the obvious when it came to Sherlock’s motivations, was going to brush it off like it meant nothing. How long could they do this, this ridiculous dance, wasn’t John as exhausted as he was?
“I understand that you don't date men, I don't quite understand why, perhaps a boyfriend in the past, I don't know, you don't have to explain, but I have tried to respect the decision. It's just," Sherlock struggled to say the words, to lay his heart on the ground at John's feet. “Since you are single again, sorry about that as well, could you perhaps see yourself, not a
They walked hand and hand back to Laila’s dorm. He waved a hello to Gail, kissed Laila, with a promise to call tomorrow, and walked slowly back to Baker Street. He’d promised to think about everything Lalia had brought up during dinner, but he broke that promise, only thinking about putting one foot in front of the other until he hit his bed.
Sherlock pulled him forward until their lips met and John breathed so heavily through his nose, his head swam, but he didn't pull away. Not until Sherlock quietly whispered against his lips, "How do you want me?"
John twisted the stem of his wine glass and wondered how the night would play out. Would Sherlock even show up? If he did, would he make a scene? It would appeal to his dramatic nature, but he must also know John wouldn’t appreciate being made a spectacle of, surely.
"Sherlock, gimme your mobile. I need to call for backup and a squad for John." Greg waited with his hand out until Sherlock slapped the phone into it. He ushered the women out the door with him as he dialed for help. John noted he'd already tied Mary and Janine together with a length of rope.
“It was a woman’s name.” She nodded rapidly, feeling useful, her hands flapping as she tried to remember. Sherlock didn’t see how they were possibly going to work it out before he found it on the computer, but as long as they weren’t interfering in the investigation he’d let them play.
“I think between the two of us, we can subdue the man. Your muscle memory seems to be satisfactory.”
John’s grin lit his entire face. “Oh, kissing too much for you now too?” He was teasing but when Sherlock glanced away in embarrassment he exclaimed, “Oh my god, it really is!” Sherlock glanced back to find John smiling like he’d done something particularly brilliant. He plopped his chin down onto Sherlock’s chest and stared. “What shall we do then while we wait?”
“Go on,” Victor snapped suddenly, “I know you can see it. Tell me about how my engagement fell apart when my company did. How he left as soon as the bank account hit six zeros instead of seven. Go on.”
“Because you’re bloody gorgeous, you great fool! Not to mention brilliant and interesting and absolutely stark-raving mad and just… Oh,” he moans, dropping his head into his hand.
“All right, imagine a scenario where you’ve done something I’ve specifically asked you not to and I’m so mad I use sex as a form of punishment. That’s the sort of sex they imagine we’re having.” The next was mumbled under his breath, “Why anyone in that office is concerned about what we’re doing in the privacy of our own flat, I have no idea.”
“What are you doing?” he demanded once reaching the bottom stair. “You can’t keep bees in the bloody cellar!”
Here's a fun idea: Got a friend who said that hat was a bad idea even though it was so not a bad idea and what do they know? Rec this fic to them. That'll teach them to be unsupportive.
“I used to,” he agreed. “I used to think I did. But you showed me a better way. Through you, I could see the point of it all. Being human, being kind, thoughtful, caring, selfless, brave. You did that, John. And instead of resenting you for making me care, all I could do was love you more. How is it that you don’t know? It should be as obvious as you are to me.”
Sherlock frowned. “It is,” he entreated. “They primarily utilize echolocation, a far superior way of locating prey, but that doesn’t mean they don’t still see.”
“Yeah, mate, as long as you don’t wash it off, you’re good to come back until we close,” he answered.
“What have you done now, you great fool?” Mrs. Hudson bustled in behind John, who grimaced as if to say he’d done his best.
A frown appeared and then John let out an amused huff. “Well, I mean. I should think it were obvious.” Whatever Sherlock’s face was doing seemed to clue John into the fact that it wasn’t, not to Sherlock. “It’s when two people who either simply don’t like each other or are angry with each other have sex despite that fact because the sex is worth it. Sometimes better because of it.”
The next morning, John wakes to his mobile alarm, and immediately groans in pain, as his thighs, back, and shoulder all scream louder and longer. Having slept in the rental hasn't done him any favours; next time he’ll spring for a motel, no matter how shady they appear.
John nicked Mrs. Hudson’s spare key from the chair cushion in the foyer, as Sherlock had shown him, and made his way silently as possible into her flat. All was quiet in the front of the flat but John could just make out the sound of Mrs Hudson’s telly in her bedroom; a luxury she’d purchased after Sherlock had first moved in and she’d received her first cheque from Mycroft. She’d divulged that bit of information that morning as they’d discussed Sherlock’s mysterious brother. The kitchen looked the same since he’d been in last. He did manage to find a half-eaten tray of Jammie Dodgers on the counter, which he grabbed after nabbing the peas. He balanced the lot and sneaked back out as silent as he’d come. It wasn’t high treason but John did get a little heart-pounding rush as he crept back out the front door with his pilfered items.
John soon found Sherlock’s forearm around his throat, as Sherlock pulled him out of his foetal position. The pressure increased; no matter how hard John pulled, Sherlock’s arm wouldn’t budge. A small part of John’s brain, the part he’d been avoiding lately, noted the definition in Sherlock’s arm as John scrambled for a purchase.
Sherlock frowned. That nose scrunch that John adored appeared, signalling Sherlock’s confusion, meaning he’d not stop until John confessed to all. His heart gave a lurch but some part of John felt like it would loosen a knot that had formed in his stomach, one that had sat heavy ever since he’d lied at Angelo’s that first night. John felt secure in his standing with Sherlock now, he could confess all and not worry he’d be on the street with the next breath; that their friendship could withstand the confession.
“Just don’t break any beating hearts over the non-beating ones,” John teased, as if the idea of Sherlock flirting back didn’t absolutely devastate him.
Sherlock saw the logic in that but instead of letting John up, he tightened his hold, causing John to chuckle against his ear.
John let out a surprised snort against Sherlock’s neck. Lips at Sherlock’s ear, he growled, “Take me home and I’ll show you.”
He did his best to look contrite as John delivered his diatribe but, knowing John was too sexual a creature to make good on the threat, he dismissed John’s dramatics. As John stomped away Sherlock was already narrowing down his best chances of angering John just enough to warrant theoretically fantastic angry sex without pushing him into anything too drastic - like leaving permanently.
He could still hear Charlie Tamwood, the gardener’s son, explain why no one would listen to six year old Sherlock’s deductions. He’d marched directly into his mother’s office and demanded to be called Sherlock from then on- never mind that there were no less than four English Kings, and a new prince, named William.
“I don’t know,” John answered, frustrated. “It just is. You know, like make-up sex. You’ve heard of that, I’m sure.”
“You think I would ever want someone like you?” He sneered. “I went to Harrow. My brother has the Prime Minister on speed dial. I could have dinner with Swedish Royalty tomorrow if I wished.” He leaned forward, into John’s space. “Why would I ever want someone like
“Hmm?” The man hummed absently. He glanced over and John gestured toward his ink stained fingernails. “Oh, I don’t, I mean not professionally.”
“I can see that you do,” he spit back, going on the offensive, despite his resolve. Anything to make John stop.
Without breaking eye contact, John slid down, half on the bed, half off, and happily watched as the recipient looked down in wonder.
John could just picture Sherlock sat in his chair, fingers at his temple, trying to work out Victor’s motives. At least he hoped so. For all John knew from listening in Sherlock could be flirting.
“Reels?” John immediately regretted asking when Sherlock scowled at him so hard his teeth looked ready to grind to dust.
His jaw is starting to ache already, it’s been too long since he’s had any practice, so he pulls off and lets his hand take over for a second.
With only half of his case unpacked, John gave up and stripped down to his vest and pants. He gave a half-hearted thought about brushing his teeth but decided instead to drag the sheets and pillows back up onto the bed. The blanket was still folded up in the chair in the corner, where Sherlock hadn’t reached before he’d collapsed. The lamp could be fixed in the morning.
"Yeah, not sure what she's worried about. She'd got miles on...Janine, was it?" He took a casual sip and side eyed John for his response.
John’s curiosity was well founded but it only reminded Sherlock how truly awful his schooldays had been. He could deny it until he was blue in the face, but lacking social skills had made Sherlock’s adolescence quite lonely.
“Uh, yeah, actually. It doesn’t seem as bad but… yeah. Huh.” He glances out the window before it occurs to him that he’s left his cane in the rest stop… along with everything in his possession in his rental. “Shit.”
“Hey, why don’t we lay the right way on the bed?” John suggested after a minute, and Sherlock nodded his agreement.
“Stop," John snapped, voice dark, closing Sherlock's throat as effectively as a hand would have done.
“You made it to the crime scene, but to hear Greg tell it, you only made it as far as the hedges before getting sick. Going by the stain on your teeth, I’d assume it was grape flavoured then?”
“Can fend for himself, he's a grown boy. Sit and enjoy your first meal as a married man." She smiled, her eyes crinkling with shared love.
They glared at each other until Sherlock’s eyes crinkled. It wasn’t a smile but it was close enough that John took it as a win. He looked back down at the sprain, noting the discolouration.
“I would keep them in a terrarium of course. I know what you’re thinking but I wouldn’t just let them roam free about the flat. I’m not an idiot,” he was saying. John smiled-
The tube was relatively empty when he stepped on, and the quiet afforded him another brief moment to collect his thoughts on Sherlock. He didn’t want to fight, he knew that, not anything serious anyway. Their teasing banter was actually one of the things he liked best about being friends with Sherlock, and he’d never consciously do anything to ruin that.
“If I’d’ve known you wanted this,” John whispered between wet kisses and nips, “I would have started in the first night.”
“Why all the subterfuge? She’s far too clever for her own good, let’s just say that. Hey, it all worked out well in the end, right?”
“Why else would a British detective turn up in America looking for the major player of a South American drug cartel? We have our own criminals, trust. I didn’t come here to topple your empire.”
There was seemingly too much static for Sherlock to pick up from his position, if his frown was anything to go on, but Greg nodded and told the officer on the other end, "Good job."
Mary glanced at Sherlock standing behind John, and then up at David, giving him a little ‘well this is awkward’ look. John wasn’t stupid, he knew Sherlock was behind him, had heard every word; he could read it in the way John's shoulders stiffened.
“No, we’re not finished. It wasn’t just us falling asleep, Sherlock. You- Christ, you were doodling pictures of me while I slept, and then we had a damn cuddle together and now you’ve basically admitted I’ve been missing the obvious since day one, so, yeah, I’d say we’ve got a lot to talk about.”
“The swelling should have gone down by now but I’m not surprised it hasn’t, the way you aggravated it last night.” He frowned down at the ankle in a way that lead Sherlock to believe that wasn’t all John was upset about. When John licked his lips Sherlock knew he was gearing up to start an uncomfortable conversation.
John seemed to be waiting for some kind of response from Sherlock, but, as he wasn’t able to think beyond John’s hot breath making the front of his pants moist, there didn’t seem to be much he could do to move the conversation along.
John gapes in shock. “You shammed that whole thing,” he whispers in awe. A trickle of impressed warmth spills in his stomach, filling him up better than any pub brawl could have done.
He raised an eyebrow at Laila’s offer. “I suppose. Your taste is wasted on John, I’m afraid. He’s more of a Guinness man.”
Mary looked him over, trying her best to parse his mood but he gave nothing. That alone probably conveyed his anger.
Sherlock grunts, blowing a few curls into John’s face. “Working hypothesis. Since adjusted in light of new evidence,” he mumbles.
Sherlock looks up at him finally, clearly angry that John's called him out. "You'll notice that but not that you've still got shaving cream behind your left ear?" He snaps, a pathetic attempt to deflect.
The constables glanced at each other nervously. “He killed our suspect, sir,” one of them explained.
“Perhaps you’re dissatisfied with the word disability? Honestly, there’s nothing to be ashamed of, John. It’s perfectly natural to learn at your own pace.”
Foremost in his mind is practically admitting to a fan that he regrets never telling Sherlock...the thing he's trying desperately not to think about- has been trying desperately not to think about since Sherlock's return.
"So I said to 'im," Greg burped, "this isn't the cargo bay, it's the loo." He pounded John on the back as he spilled a little bit of his beer on the floor. John laughed but he definitely wasn't drinking as quickly as Greg would like.
John had no idea, but god help him if he didn’t just want to let her lead one last time anyway. It was stupid, he knew, but wasn’t it just the way of things? Everyone else knew better, didn’t they? And apparently she had Mycroft’s invisible blessing. Sherlock’s too, if his rumbling Arabic was to be believed.
"Mmm, rockets. You know what military talk does to me, don't you dare. I'm having a wonderful time, I'd like it to last."
By the time Sherlock returned, John had sat at the kitchen table, finger tracing the lip of the crystal glass he’d removed. Sherlock stood in the doorway and watched.
The man laughs good-naturedly. “Right, right. Well, let me give you some unsolicited advice,” he finishes pumping, jiggling the handle into his gas tank, and meets John as he pulls his cane from the passenger seat, “if you do decide to start a family, don’t listen to a thing your wife says about ‘non-violent punishments’, okay? Don’t get me wrong, I love my kids, I’d never hurt them,” he looks around before whispering, “permanently. But sometimes what I wouldn’t give to-”
someone even hints at you being anything other than my business partner or flatmate? It’s like working with a parrot. ‘I’m not his date’”, he squawked, dramatically John thought. “‘He’s not my boyfriend’, ‘We’re not together’. Christ, John, nobody
“No, it’s all right. I promise. I’m just not used to anyone being interested in it. You can…if you want.” He waved at it.
John pinched the bridge of his nose. This wasn’t Sherlock. This was Sherlock on sex hormones; completely mad like some rabid thing. “I’ve created a monster.”
Molly struck first, armed with a bottle of champagne, which she brought down on top of Janine's head. It fell with a thunk and Molly waited while Janine stood there looking confused, before she fell to the floor.
“I’m sorry, mate, but those are the rules. I can’t be liable for you dropping it on a fellow reveler.”
Ice would have done the trick just as well but he was too polite to say. “Thank you. Next time you’ll have to have a steak ready for Sherlock’s eye.”
“Oh, yes, I suppose I’ll try to eat.” He lifted a slice of toast and nibbled on the corner, despite his nerves protesting the maneuver.
Sherlock affected a put upon sigh and shoved past John like a dark cloud bent on raining on someone’s parade. John wanted to call out but he didn’t know if the coast was clear, even though Sherlock obviously believed it was, so he just followed as the man strutted away. They made their way toward the River in a hurry; he practically had to skip to keep up.
He caught up to the ‘couple’ halfway through the movie, taking a seat in the back and to the right side of their location. He had a clear line of sight to John, so if he tried anything, Sherlock would know.
John was ready to tear his hair out when Laila pulled him roughly by his shirt front and snarled, “That’s Irene Adler and if you know what’s good for you, you’ll shut up and let me dump you. Ready?” Without any more warning than that she open palm slapped him across the face. “I knew it! You bastard! I can’t believe I fell for your lies! I never want to see you again, John Watson!”
“You’re lucky I just bought a new… Sherlock, jesus!” John marched back to the bed and cradled Sherlock’s face. “Hey, it’s all right, I’m here. Hey.” Sherlock continued to shiver, despite John’s proximity and his assurances. It was too much adrenaline in his system, too long having gone without John’s touch, just too much. John rubbed at Sherlock’s arms, ran his hands down to pull Sherlock’s away from the bed spread, where he’d gripped them and been unable to let go.
Greg made to stand again; John was hopeful of rescue, but Molly snatched him back down again. Dammit.
Sherlock reached up and ran a thumb over John’s pink scar, remembering how mesmerized he’d been the night before.
“I don’t know,” she swirled her pinkie finger in her scotch and, in what was no doubt supposed to be sexual in nature, let the excess drip onto her tongue, “necessity is the mother of invention after all. Perhaps it’s a matter of breeding a better class of criminal.”
“Unlikely, you finding a place where my body wouldn’t be found. The native scavengers would have my bones picked clean in a matter of days, even if you buried me deep. Think about it.”
“No, Sherlock, I’m not going to do that. It’s an invasion of their privacy, to say nothing of mine,” he said with a raised eyebrow.
“It’s nothing,” John assured. “Just that, well, Laila’s going to be insufferable.” He smiled up at Sherlock, a twinkle in his eye.
“Oi, my accent isn’t fake! I’m from Hampshire. And anyway, I have no idea what you think I’m involved in but-”
“Mmm, interesting,” Sherlock muses. His fingers drum on the steering wheel and John watches them in the light from the dash, thinking wildly inappropriate thoughts. “John.”
“What?” Sherlock queried, looking around for obvious items that might have jumped out at the unobservant man.
"First it's not now and now it's hurry up. Make up your mind, will you?" He rose up out of the way so John could lube his cock quickly. John didn't take the bait Sherlock laid out, he was too far gone to be angry at the man's tone. He stroked himself fully until he was satisfactorily covered, when he looked up Sherlock was watching him, fisting himself as well. John groaned loudly at the sight and let go of his prick like he was burned.
"Well yes." Silly man. She grasped at something to get his mind away from the wedding. "The Inspector mentioned a case involving a corpse buried under the new Barclay's building. Sounds interesting."
“Goddamn it, Sherlock. Your brother is going to have my head,” Lestrade’s voice filtered in past the sound of his own labored breathing.
John felt sucker punched by this observation. He hadn't thought of that in years, certainly hadn't connected that moment to this one. But of course Sherlock had.
John blinked in surprise at that but eventually answered, “Yes. Enough for a lifetime, far too much.”
“I doubt it, but as I’ve never spoken to her, I’ll never know. I just needed to confirm Oliver’s location to the authorities. When Oliver goes to Houston to meet Lillian, he’ll really be meeting the FBI. He’s the weakest link in the Juarez Cartel, he’ll flip on the other key members faster than anyone else would have. Case solved.”
"Virgin," he snapped. "You can say it. I'm a virgin. Christ, had I known you were so squeamish I'd have gone off and-"
“I tried not to but…Yes. It’s probably overwhelming to you, I know, but I just couldn’t stop it and I’m tired of pretending-“
To Sherlock’s surprise, his mobile went off, a text alert. He fished it out of his pocket and silently swore if it was Mycroft snooping on Sherlock while he snooped on John, he’d chuck his phone into the Thames and disappear into the homeless network.
“Sherlock… Let me put it this way: if I considered last night, from the time we met to this moment, our first date, I would be out right now looking for an engagement ring.” Sherlock’s eyes widened at that, his heart ticking madly, but John went on. “The part I’m surprised about is that you’re apparently feeling the same insanity that I am. We just met! I can’t just move in. Hell, you might actually still turn out to be a serial killer for all I know.”
A bomb went off in Sherlock’s chest, spreading warmth and chaos. It was decided then. He would keep John.
Sherlock wanted to be flippant, it was in his nature to brush off uncomfortable conversations, but this was important. John’s trust was the most important thing. He’d not start off their proper foray into a relationship with false hope and lies.
John gave a great, put upon sigh, one that put Sherlock’s to shame, but smiled all the while. “I suppose. I’ll get to knock you around some more at any rate, that’s quite an incentive.”
John put his arm and shoulder right back underneath to steady him. “Whoa, hold it. I think you’ve got a sprain. Quit squirming, you idiot. Let’s get up to the flat so I can look at it.”
“Leaving the flat, walking to the corner shop for more cough suppressant, texting Lestrade, being asked onto a real case. After that…” He rubbed at his wrist. “Not a lot.”
Greg laughed. "You're completely serious." He scrubbed a hand over his short cropped hair and continued to laugh. "Can you imagine?"
“John, oh my-” Sherlock breathes deeply for an intense few seconds, “god, oh god,” he deep, rumbling voice cries out.
“Hmm.” Sherlock paused to process the new information before coming to his next query. “Why would they think we do that? We don’t hate each other.”
John snorted. “Absolutely not.” Before John could process the weight of the words - perhaps he was just high on having successfully pulled the wool over Sherlock’s eyes for so long -  he whispered, “Christ, you really don’t know, do you?”
John stared at the kitchen table, with Sherlock’s chemistry sets, his microscope, the old mugs of tea Mrs. Hudson hadn’t cleared away for him, and, god help him, John pictured sweeping all of it aside and pinning Sherlock down with his fist in those dark curls.
Mycroft gave a slight shake of his head, to John’s great relief, without looking, still preoccupied with staring down the hall. “No,” he answered back softly, only just glancing at John. “You were right though, we did find him in Camden. Thank you again.”
Except, previously unnoticed by John, some of his bits weren’t exactly soft, so the impact was doubly shocking.
“You're so strange,” John noted aloud. The kid nodded in agreement as if this were common knowledge. John decided then, “I like you.”
He had to feign polite confusion when Janine leant across the table and asked, "Right, John? The Best Man Speech?" As if he hadn't been eaves dropping.
