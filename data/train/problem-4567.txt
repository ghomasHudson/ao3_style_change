Course, Dean wasn’t actively dying so he dragged it out. His mistake was mentioning it during his weekly video chat with Sam and Eileen. Sam had run out of the room to grab an article he read. While his brother was busy in piles of paper, Eileen got straight to the point. She suggested his Herophilus Gland might be acting up.
A flood of people starts to file into the plane. “Akobel,” Cas provides. “I would avoid mentioning that to Ishim. Although Lily will be there so it's likely unavoidable.”
“Jesus Christ.”
“Where do you come in? Pretty sure Gabriel knows your feelings on the matter,” Dean observes. The idea of the Miltons, one of the oldest and most prestigious magic families, being stuck on a party boat is hilarious. He doesn’t know why Gabriel wants Cas to be involved. Cas hasn’t been a Milton for a long time.
Cas doesn’t even blink, “You have a large suitcase.”
‘Dude,” Sam says, quietly so Castiel can’t hear. Seraphs have great hearing, he probably can. “A week ago you were on a warpath. Now, you’re playing house with that thing.”
Dean doesn’t have an answer.
Dean and Cas are left in the kitchen. “You okay?” Dean asks softly.
“I felt a pulse when you mentioned them.”
Castiel looks at Dean, a somewhat pitying expression in his eyes. “The distinction is difficult to express in any human language. It is enough to say I did not fall. I am falling.”
Castiel’s expression is unreadable, “I’m not from around here.”
Cas shifts his eyes back and forth. “Nothing. We were exchanging stories. She’s a well traveled hunter.”
Eileen would pat him on the shoulder while laughing at him. That’s fair.
Dean can’t help but wonder if this is what Cas truly wants. He was falling long before he knew Dean but dating certainly didn’t slow the process down. He shakes off the feeling. He loves Cas. He needs to trust that Cas knows what he wants, even if it’s not going to be easy.
Not even twenty minutes into his tanning session, Cas’s eyes spring open. He grabs the tube of sunscreen. Dean should have expected this.
“Your problem, Dean, is that you have no faith.”
Dean waits around for a bit. He doesn’t need to get the locals suspicious that Cas and him are together. He orders another beer, smiles sympathetically at the table with the twerp, and rambles out to the camper after half an hour.
The avian clinic doesn't close until 8:00 pm on Fridays so it’ll be a late dinner. Dean decides he’ll make burgers for Cas closer to when he gets home. That’ll take his mind off whatever hair-brained scheme Gabriel has cooked up or whatever his latest bullshit is.
Dean isn’t a fan of getting out of his cozy camper so fucking early but it might be worth it. He sits on the stairs of the camper, coffee in hand, enjoying the sunrise, and watching Cas stare off into the distance.
He’s in the bread aisle, debating whole wheat versus sprouted wheat bread when he sees him. Well, feels him. He gets the uncanny feeling someone is staring. He jerks his head up and comes face to face with one Mr. Dean Winchester. Dean’s eyes are wide, his knuckles white where they grip the shopping cart.
A rush of affection and lust sparks in his heart. “Like my love for you.”
Dean tries his best to glare intensely at Sam. He wants to tell Sam to shut the hell up but he catches a glimpse of himself in the rearview mirror. All he resembles is a kicked puppy.
Jack beams, “Okay, so first I’m Mewtwo.” The comparison is a little shaky. Jack wasn’t created in a lab but he is super powerful and misunderstood. Jack never created an evil clone army to take over the world though.
They stare at each other. Dean doesn’t know what to say without sounding way too sentimental.
Dean doesn’t bother trying to rouse Cas in the morning, the smell of breakfast always wakes him up. One advantage of a tiny living space. Dean does have to wonder why a mighty angel of the Lord is comatose most days until late morning.
He got caught up in it, couldn't stop daydreaming. He was a lonely, lovesick kid, dreaming about his soulmate. Lots of people got carried away with the prospect at that age.
Cas looks at his watch, they’ll need to leave for their sailing soon. “You’re a good friend.”
“The top canine teeth of elk are called ivories.”
Dean is in the middle of reshingling one of the cabins. He’s spent no small amount of time hauling the damn things onto the roof. He’s not even off the ladder when an unseen force knocks him back. He lands on his ass, thankfully. Limbs still intact. He looks skyward. It is an angel, wings spread wide, knocking shingles every which way. Dickbag.
Their first date goes very well. It’s wonderful to get to know the man Dean has become. He’s a mechanic at Bobby’s Singer’s place in town. Dean’s always loved working on cars and Cas can see how much he enjoys the work, even if the customers are terrible.
Dean squirms, “Fine. Fine. I’ll spell it out.” He clears his throat “Cas, will you marry me?” Dean barely gets the words out before Cas is kissing him. Hard. Like he’s trying to devour Dean. He finally has to let up for air.
There’s a distant voice in the background. Cas swears it’s Dean but that’s not possible. He has no reason to be at the townhouse.
“So what, you don’t have the nuts to finish off some poor little lost soul.”
Dean slides into the passenger seat as Jack starts the car. Nougat slides down Jack’s arm and starts to fiddle with the dials on the radio with his tail, attempting to find Jack’s favorite pop station. He stares Dean down as he does so.
He nods.
Before Dean can even think he blurts out, “Come with me.”
Cas raises his eyebrow. “Tell me Dean, what do you think we’ve been doing for the last year? The financial benefits would mostly be for your sake. Sex is hardly a requriement, although I’d be happy to discuss physical intimacy with you."
He knows it’s not exactly like that. Bobby’s got, what the hell does Cas call those? Secondary marks for him and Sam. The pages of Sam’s book stopped turning after Jess died. And Cas, well his marks changed every time the weirdo sneezed.
Sam had tried for years to get Dean to do this. What Sam didn’t know wouldn’t kill him.
“Semi-retired,” Donna adds, patting Jody on the back.
It’s not perfect. Cas insists on maintaining an actual sleep schedule. He has no problem glaring at Dean until he puts his phone away at night. Despite this horrible treachery, Dean worries about Cas’s sleep. He can't seem to get comfortable.
I should state for the purposes of the plot, I’ve taken some liberties with bird care when it comes to familiars.
He tries to suppress a smile. Jack’s been trying for a while now to protect their old truck against further wear and tear with spellwork. They’ve made impressive progress but magic is finicky and so are cars. The two together tended to produce interesting results. Jack somehow glued the tires to the driveway last week.
Cas is right. He cannot be right.
No problem, 😎 I’m finishing up some work. Come on over. I’ll be done in five.
There is one spring mark left on his arm. The tulip. Lissuin. It remains as beautiful as the day it nestled on his palm.
A voice, the gravelly baritone he knows so well, rings out.
Castiel must pick up on Dean’s thoughts. “All living things have a spark, Dean. Something given to them by the Divine. I am no different. I will be human one day. I will have a soul.”
Mercy, this man sometimes. “Dean. I would also be fondling the testicles if I was trying to pleasure it.
Dean glances down at his mother’s ring on Cas’s finger. Dean shouldn’t even argue. Cas is his husband after all. He’ll build him anything he fucking wants.
You know that thing you mentioned about undead ghosts? I thought you were joking WHY are they so fucking hard to kill??
So Dean yells. “CAS!”
Dean is settling into this life. It’s not half bad.
Cas stares him down, “I never said I didn’t like it. I found the moral lesson to be undermined by the premise of the franchise. Perhaps if you would have listened to me you would know that.”
Jack’s going to be five soon. His boy is going to start kindergarten in the fall. Dean doesn’t get teary-eyed at the thought.
Dean finds himself unable to sleep, he’s been staring at the ceiling for hours. Thinking about Cas. It’s an embarrassingly common occurrence these days. With their last kid going off to college, they’ve had more and more time to spend together.
There is one local he is concerned about. Dean Winchester.
The soul mark flares up from Dean’s shoulder. Striking and splendid.
“Oh. This shirt. The one in Dean’s closet? I didn’t get it from Dean,” Claire teases.
Cas is getting tired of it. It would be one thing if Dean just ignored him but Cas is starting to feel like a zoo animal with the way Dean looks at him. His attempts to approach Dean around town have failed.
Everything suddenly makes sense. The night Dean got back from the trip. Cas had tried to comfort Dean. He’d offered his love and Dean’s soul, perhaps ready for the first time, had accepted. Relief floods over Cas.
Cas is confused until Dean grabs his wrist and flips it over to expose his palm. Dean traces his thumb across Cas’s palm, the flower following obediently, “Do you think I was talking about the farmhouse when I said I was happy to be home?  I needed to see you and Jack after this fucking week. And yeah, if my best friend is having car troubles, I’m gonna help. Have you met me? Come on, you know that.”
happen? It isn't just being with a man. Dean isn't getting flustered because he has a crush on Cas. Well, he does. No, it's much more.
Dean’s getting better at reading Cas’s moods. Something’s up.
you feel...you feel so good. Please,” Cas gasps out. Dean’s getting close, he’s gonna lose it if Cas keeps saying shit like that. He leans down to stroke Cas’s dick in time with his thrusts.
Dean gets a stupid grin on this face, “What about Catstiel? Won’t Catstiel be there? The familiar she named after her favoritest sibling.” So sue him. It’s cute. Catstiel.
Cas was fifteen when he ditched the farm with his brother Gabriel. Gabriel was more worldly, he protected Cas. Got him the job at the Gas-n-Sip. For a while, it was just them but more and more of Cas’s siblings followed suit. Michael was the last to show up, all ready to declare himself a god among his siblings.
Cas inhales sharply, “It did not explode.”
It always surprised Cas but Gabriel stayed in town. He sent Cas a lengthy field report after Cas had maybe inquired about Dean when he was considering coming back. Dean worked as a mechanic in town. His brother ran a small-law office. Gabriel told Cas he confirmed Dean was 100% single. Small-town gossip never ceases to amaze him.
Dean gulps, “Is there a smiley face after that?”
“Cas!” he shouts. Dean puts him down so he can run over. “Jack, darling. Cas worked all night. Be easy.”
Dean grips the steering wheel tight so he doesn’t plow into a tree by accident. Thousands of thoughts swirl around his head. Would Cas want something elaborate or would he prefer a quiet dinner between the two of them? Yeah, Cas would like that. Sam could watch Jack. No wait, Jack should be there. Should he? Dean wants to include Jack but he also wants some lovey-dovey time for him and Cas to celebrate their engagement. Maybe a private dinner and then they could take Jack to that horribly expensive ice cream parlor he loves…
Sam stops, “Dean. You are not Dad. A hunt went south and it took longer than expected. You didn’t leave Jack alone in a motel room. He’s got like ten people watching him and Cas, you know, his legal guardian.”
Cas opens his palm, inviting Dean to complete the Bonding. “Dean, stop being stupid.”
Dean slides over into the driver’s seat. He pulls out his phone to check his text messages, he missed a few when he was with Jack.
The video ends. Dean can’t help it as he smiles fondly at his phone.
Dean had almost forgotten he’s into a sardine can until the door is latched and the engine roars to life. The whole thing rattles.
“Why don’t you kill me,” Dean asks, coldly.
Unretirement is a strong word. Cas tells him it’s not a word at all.
Jack’s gotten pretty good at driving. Dean enjoys the fresh air and decent food. The bunker is starting to get stuffy. Dean dusts constantly but he’s beginning to think that’s not the problem.
Well fuck. Dean had thought Castiel looked like an angel. Not because he was one but because he thought Castiel was handsome and had dreamy eyes.
“No. The other most important lesson.”
He walks down to the bird room and opens the door. Colette is clinging to the side of her aviary, wanting attention as usual. He greets her first, lest she get offended, before he greets Honey and Bee. Those two are thankfully being quiet this afternoon. He’s learned very well that sun conures can scream so much despite their tiny bodies.
Dean thumbs at the base of the tree, “You know I used to watch every shitty movie on tv when I was a kid. Only decent things at cheap-ass motels. I secretly loved the Bonding scenes. The guy would grasp the woman. She’d wither and moan. Tell him it was like being struck by lightning before he planted a sloppy one on her,” Dean says.
Cas finishes, the last photograph is of him and Jack backpacking. He glances at Dean and must read his thoughts.
“It’s nice of them to let us board early,” Dean says as he tries to get comfortable. “So I don’t get trampled to death in this metal death tube.”
“I’ll think about it,” Cas concedes.
“You only make this for me because you want my pies,” Dean teases.
Cas is hopeful Dean will listen. He most likely won’t but the Lord has worked miracles before.
Suddenly the pressure on his chest is gone. The angel is standing over him. He grabs Dean's arms with his wings and hauls him to his feet. Dean’s head spins. The angel is telling him to breathe.
Cas rolls his eyes. “I’ll see you tonight Dean.”
Cas had convinced Jack, after much discussion, to watch a movie that was not
“Dean did invite you right?” Sam asks before looking pointedly at Dean, “Like we talked about?”
“Real close. More of a father to me than my dear old Dad ever was.”
“I actually bought the store when the owner retired. Well, I bought it with a friend. It’s a small shop. It covers what I need. Meg seemed a little too eager to get rid of me when I went on my trip. I’ve actually been thinking of selling my half. I’ve been writing more and more the last few years,” Cas says.
“I understand.” If Dean wants to talk, Cas knows to let him.
Rufus was an old hunter, long since retired. He suspected it was a banshee from the moment his neighbor turned up dead from a blow to the head. He was the one to call Bobby when he couldn’t stab the damn thing himself.
Dean looks it up on Yelp.
That gets Dean’s attention, “I thought Michael usually did that?” The Miltons took their family reunions incredibly seriously and there was no way Michael had willingly relinquished his role as the planner.
The windows start to fog up as Cas pulls him down into a deep kiss while drawing one knee up to change the angle. Dean keeps thrusting. Cas tugs painfully on Dean’s hair when he hits the sweet spot. His angel moans loudly, a desperate look in his eyes
“Kali will be accompanying Gabriel.”
His soul mark aches a bit but there’s no pain in the back of his head. Those blockers were miracle drugs.
“I know.”
Dean wasn’t the only one in his life trying to get rid of Jubilee. Jack liked to read Dean’s car magazines and routinely tried to talk Cas into replacing it. Right now, a more reliable vehicle would be nice.
Looks like the whole welcoming committee is here.
Cas gets out of bed. He’s got his usual grumpy morning frown on. Dean tries not to grin as Cas passes him to get to the shower.
Donna joins them. She hauls Cas off to see the pictures around the bar when he shows interest.
“You know, the mountain that once stood here was very beautiful. When it erupted, the foundation gave way. It collapsed in on itself. All life around was destroyed and the mountain was a hollow void. I grieved. I would come back from time to time to check on it. Life began to return, water began to fill the caldera. I witnessed the transformation and was reminded of the way life always returns. I felt joy. Not all of my time as an angel was spent suffering.”
Cas turns to face Dean, “You sound very close with your brother. It can be difficult when such relationships change. You are exploring and setting boundaries when perhaps you have not in the past.”
You’ll always have a place here. No matter how long it takes you to get your head out of your ass
“Sounds like a plan, sunshine.”
Sam stays with Dean a few days. He still seems suspicious of Castiel and whatever Dean is doing. But the kid’s got a life. Eventually, he packs his car to return to California.
“What about your list Cas?” Dean inquires, “We never did hear it.” He hasn’t seen Cas work on it. He would know.
Dean is happy that his family is getting along but they may be getting along too well.
Castiel continues, “If you were to ask my brothers and sisters, they’d say I had a crack in my chassis. I was different from the start. I’ve spent many years on Earth. I like it down here. Eventually, I stayed for good.”
Donna and Jody appear very tired. Jody had told him some vamps were causing trouble but she didn’t mention it being that bad. The tourist season could be bad this year.
“Yep”
“Didn’t know you had strong opinions on gas station food,” Dean says.
He lets go of Dean’s hand but Dean couldn’t have imagined that. They held hands. They touch more than is strictly necessary but he’s pretty sure they’ve never held hands.
There was a time in Dean’s life that he would have refused but in truth, he’s actually a little touched by Cas’s offer. A lot of people would have blown Dean off by now.
There’s a sigh on the other end, “Yeah. I’ll try scenting another mouse with tuna juice. I think spoiled him too much.”
Jack nods along, writing down Dean’s instructions word for word. The kid’s got a supernatural ability to take notes, which makes sense if Dean thinks about it.
Dean nods, “I know. Even Sam doesn’t judge rabbit food that hard.”
Cas waits. He is hoping for at least a patented Winchester smile and hug. All Dean does is shift back and forth. It’s suddenly very awkward standing there in the bread aisle.
Dean tucks himself back into his pants and climbs over into the front seat so Cas has room to get his pants back on. Once everything is securely fastened, name tag straightened, and tie adjusted he joins Dean in the front seat.
The lights flicker ever so slightly as Cas rubs his face. “I think there’s a part of my brother that will always want his family to reconcile or manage to have a civil family dinner at least.”
Dean almost spits out his coffee, “You just said you didn’t fall.”
So Dean hoped that by sprinkling in some movies with aliens, he might get a reaction or a confession.
Casteil doesn’t miss a beat. “As my travel companion was saying, that is exactly what is happening.” Castiel says, tone serious. He’s really selling their cover story.
Dean stops short. He looks up into the night sky. “Would you believe me if I said I’m fine?”
“Then that’s a no.”
He told Cas he didn’t want to be a hunter but the realization hits him hard now. He wants to offer to help his friends but the feeling of excitement and adrenaline he once got isn’t there. Maybe he can just use diplomacy or something. Nobody has died yet.
“Your welcome, sir,” Dean responds.
Sometimes Dean would let him sit in his lap and steer the Impala on one of the old logging roads far from town before Jack had to go to preschool. Jack loved to drive, even if his legs couldn’t reach the pedals. Besides, Dean needed to start Jack off on the right foot. His father drove like a man who didn’t fear death.
She adjusts her hand, “Any emotionally or physically intense event in your life recently?”
This isn’t the Dean Winchester Cas knew. Sheepish and quiet. Did Cas really know Dean at all? Maybe this is all Cas’s fault. He has been projecting onto Dean for fifteen years. That was the last time they really talked. Now he is interrupting his dinner. Dean probably wants him to go away.
The visitor’s center’s not shabby for being out in the middle of fucking nowhere. Some gold prospector had called the place a “mass of black vomit.”
Cas finishes chopping the onions, bringing them over to Dean. “He’s very serious about that last one.”
“I’m gonna get my eight hours, Cas. Try not to wake me up when you flop into bed.” He’s already moving towards his beloved memory foam.
Cas knows logically that there was a time in his life before Dean. Before the endless flowers that ebbed and flowed with the changing seasons. All matter of greenery grew from Laurelin and Telperion since they sprouted on his back at the tender age of fourteen. Yet, they’d never produced such an abundance of flowers. Now they created countless blooms, all for Dean. A physical manifestation of Cas’s love, fierce and absolute.
Cas scoots over to get out of the Impala when Dean remembers his very obvious sex hair. “Wait,” Dean cries.
He could call Sam for money. It’s not pride that stops him. Okay, maybe a little. He wants to keep going at this and propane doesn’t pay for itself. Asking Sam for help feels like defeat.
“No, a few dinners and social functions. I would be free to spend most of the trip doing what I please,” Cas answers.
Cas goes to grab his blade, lodged firmly in the side of the cabin. “It would seem Heaven thought to finish me off before I truly fell. I suppose they took a calculated risk and hoped a mere footsoldier could kill me in my weakened state. They forget themselves. This will remind them.”
They hold the position for the prescribed thirty minutes. Cas’s arm begins to cramp fifteen minutes in but he pays it no mind. He takes the time to relish the steady beat of Dean’s heart,  the way Dean melts against him and the way his hand perfectly matches Dean’s soul mark. The only way to further cement it would be to take Dean as his husband.
Dean keeps rambling. “Anyway, I’m looking at this devastatingly handsome dude with the most ridiculous honeybee tie. He literally drags me inside, dusts me off, and gives me his ugly coat. Tells me to take it and return it when I get the chance. Who does that? I made it to class, slightly soggy but only five minutes late. I dropped the coat off the next day and we got to talkin’...”
“Okay. Felix, Marvin, Nougat, and Teddy are all fed and watered. Be on the lookout for poop in the next 24-48 hours,” Jack says as he looks over his checklist. “Be careful of Marvin’s pleading face. I promise he’s not starving.”
“Dean, I am much older than you,” Cas sighs. “You must understand, angels are beings of divine intent. We are supposed to follow orders without question. I was quite liked among my siblings. My skill in battle was unrivaled. I was close to being perfect, if not for my propensity for disobedience.”
“Throw it.”
They drink and talk about their plans for the next few days. They’ll head to the Tetons tomorrow. After that, Dean wants to see the Geysers at Yellowstone. They looked pretty in his guidebook. Cas wants to see the wildlife. He draws Dean a map of all the places they’ll be stopping at, like he’s planning a battle.
Cas shrugs, “I cannot say. I had other things on my mind.” There’s an unmistakable hitch to his voice.
Cas: 😊 😊 😊 Sam. I have wonderful news 👀  🍰 🗣!!!! I must inform you your brother 🌈 and I are to be wed. 😍 😌 🥳 🥰 😇 +  👱♂️ 👬 I have also sent home 🏠 the bananas 🍌 you requested. Do not let Dean tell you otherwise. 🍌 🍌 🍌
Sam continues, undaunted “And. And. On the search history on my computer, do you know what I found? Zillow. You’ve been looking at homes. I know you’ve got like, a mountain of issues but come on, just ask him. Hell, I will ask for you if you want. I can’t take this anymore.”
“Dean, you are not a burden. Quite the opposite. In fact, I wanted…”
“I told you, the windows,” Cas huffs.
Castiel flaps his wings. Once. Twice. Fans them out.
“Is the issue that you’re unsure of his feelings or, you know, you,” She gestures vaguely to all of Dean.
Of course, Sam reappears at that exact moment.
Claire begins searching through his closet, “Because it’s hilarious if I wear it. Besides this cruise cannot all be Dad’s freaky family. There has to be some hot girls on it.”
Fuck you
Look bitch I’m sorry
Dean’s jaw drops. “What?”
Dean sits there, not knowing what to do. Part of him desperately wants to stop. But it feels like nothing next to how much he aches to know. To see where this goes. He didn’t drag himself to the Soul and Bonding Center to chicken out.
Cas motions for Dean to stop at every pullout so he can glass across the valley with his binoculars. On their third drive through, Cas spots a fuzzy black blob. He assures Dean it's a black bear.
Okay. Well, nothing for it. Dean inhales, “Umm, his full name is Castiel Novak. It’s the name of an angel if you’re wondering. Dark brown hair, blue eyes, few inches shorter than me.  He dresses like a frickin’ dork.”
Oh, Heaven. He’s seen Dean shirtless before but he’s not allowed himself to truly take in his fill. He’s simply stunning. From his muscular arms, his freckled chest, down to his soft belly.
“Anna, sweetheart, could you hand me the pliers?” Dean requests. He’s trying to get a weight threaded onto his fishing line and he had to drop the damn things.
“It is festive, isn’t it? It feels fantastic during penetration.”
He chooses a gravel patch where several cars are parked, it looks to be a trailhead. He can see south for miles. There is an old timey sign that reads “Howdy Stranger. Yonder Is Jackson Hole. The Last Of The Old West.” Fat chance these days.
Dean hops down, tugging his shirt over his head. Dr. Mills starts to fill out his prescription on her computer.
Dean runs his hands over his face, “No. Cas, I love you. As in. R-O-M-A-N-T-I-C. I love your hideous trench coat, your shitty car, those damn ties. I love that you’re a dorky little librarian who cares so much about his job you can get weirdly intense about it. You’re kind and loving, and such a great father. I love seeing you and Jack together and I want to be part of that. I want to…Christ. Bond. With you.”
She squints at the screen before shaking her head furiously, “No. Absolutely not. No way. That gives way too much old geezer on the golf course vibes.”
He and Cas had breakfast together almost every morning. He hadn’t come over to have his coffee with Dean. Something was stressing Cas out and none of his texts indicated the cause.
The sun finally showed itself. Some days Dean and Cas go down to the beach if Jack is hanging out with his old high school friends. Dean got him and Cas matching Hawaiian shirts so they can be an extremely tacky couple together. Cas makes it look good.
Dean can feel himself panic.
Castiel looked down at Dean’s flannel. “Do not worry. I’ll make it good as new.”
“We talkin’ like marriage material or the cute cashier at Walmart I flirted with,” Dean asks.
Cas loved the idea. They found an artist Cas liked and Dean held Cas’s hand for the several sessions it took. The six wings of a seraph. The shade of charcoal was even right.
Jack leans over and nudges Nougat, “Get off the dashboard, it isn’t safe. Go sit in Dean’s lap.”
Dean cannot believe he’s here. He stares straight ahead at the cream-colored lettering on the wall declaring
“I know it, bud.”
layered in there. “Is all this necessary?” He checks Anna out of the corner of his eye. Her feathers are tight against her body.
God, they’re such fucking dumbasses sometimes. The alarm beeps again. Dean should just burn the Gas-n-Sip down.
“It isn’t.”
“I have a proposition,” Dean had said.
“I want a pie. Not cake.”
Dean had been at one such party. He was drunk, dancing around, making a complete fool out of himself. Cas couldn’t stop looking. It didn’t help that Dean caught him staring, ran up, threw his arm around Cas and asked “Did it hurt?”
“Dinky?” Cas roars, his eyes glowing blue. Promising sign. “This is an ancient cosmic weapon. It has slain countless enemies. It is not
Sam and Eileen have really made something out of this whole venture. Most of his life, Dean hunted because it was all he knew. That’s how he helped people. He would be lying if hunting had not thrilled him and given him a sense of purpose. Those feelings never lasted though.  Monsters kept killing people, Dean and Sam kept chasing after them. It never ended.
“Big Jay, slow down,” Gabriel shouts from somewhere .“You’re ruining the surprise.”
Dean is fiddling with the oven so he can cook his turkey bacon when there is a great whoosh behind him. The lights flicker a bit.
“Yeah, I can see that. You’ve been here awhile,” Dean replies. Has this guy not even called for help?
The asshole has the nerve to look Dean straight in the eyes, “You said this was a low stakes game meant to deepen our relationship. Surely you would not be upset at my victory.”
Cas agrees to the microbrewery tour on the condition that Dean takes him to the zoo. It’s a real hardship to spend the day moseying around, eating junk food, and being with Cas. Dean buys him another stuffed grizzly. They’ll find room for it somewhere in the camper.
Cas’s fear dissipates, replaced by a budding joy. Dean wasn’t dying. It was quite the opposite.
He yearns for the open road.
Cas looks down to see he’s been smearing butter up and down the corn cob absentmindedly. He tries not to blush. “My apologies. I was distracted.”
“I feel you kid,” Dean tells Jack, patting him on the shoulder.
There’s the jingle of keys, “Yeah, if anything coyotes would eat Dad,” Jack suggests.
Dean turns to ask if Cas wants any hashbrowns when he notices that Cas is holding a necklace. A simple silver chain with an orb of glowing white light encased in glass. The last of Cas’s grace. Cas probably used a magic spell to create it.
Coming right toward Dean is a huge iridescent snake. He moves effortlessly across the tile as people fling themselves out of the way. The last time Dean saw Jörmungandr, it was Cas’s board certification party. Cas was so wrong. He has to be forty feet by now.
Honey liked Claire, Jack, Cas, and then Dean in that exact order. Bee loved whoever was feeding him at the moment. Dean can respect the hustle.
Cas has a pretty good customer service face, forged in the fires of working retail for years but he frowns for just a split second, the corners of his mouth twitching in frustration.
“I’m sorry Dean. Gabriel called early and we had a slight disagreement. I ended up being late to work because of it. He picks the worst times to call,” Cas mutters as he gazes forlornly at the tray of potato puffs.
“Good morning Dean, thank you for breakfast,” Cas yawns, sitting at the dinette.
“Really? Maybe you should have communicated your feelings better.”
For fuck’s sake. He has to snap out of this. He’s managed to hold it together for ten years. What’s two weeks? Besides, Cas is there to spend time with his kids, relax on the beach, and do touristy crap. He doesn't want to fuck Dean into the mattress. What he wants Dean to do is help him deal with his stupid family.
Dean thinks. Castiel’s mess isn’t really his problem but he can’t leave the guy stranded on some mountain pass. He’s a lot of things but he is not that much of a dick. Besides, he came prepared.
“Elk grow waterproof hairs in the winter. It protects them from the wet and cold.”
Then he spots it. Actually, he feels it. The thick, almost tangible sense of the supernatural. It’s coming from a seedy looking bar. Can’t hurt to check it out.
“I need to use the bathroom,” he announces.
“Look, I’m not great with feelings. Or talking. But I wanted to apologize. I was a real dick to you when we first met. You’ve only ever been good to me. I’m sorry.” Dean hopes Castiel understands he’s also sorry he didn’t say something sooner.
Dean stares at Meg. He’s known demons. Pure evil. Yet, here he is talking to one about whether or not he’s dating an angel at the nursery they both own.
It’s Monday and Dean is not panicking. Totally not panicking.
Dean really hopes his husband still has that supernatural hearing.
“How is the case going?” Jack inquires, as they motor down the road.
Cas stayed awake as long as he could, lovingly responding to Jack’s comments but he was drifting off fast. Dean put his arm around Cas and kissed him on the forehead, “Go to sleep sunshine. I’ll put Jack to bed.”
He hasn’t allowed himself to think about them in years. When the dreams started, it confused the hell out of him. He’d hadn’t given much thought to finding a soulmate. Dean Winchester wasn’t the type to settle down, but he figured he might find a lady, have a few kids. The standard apple pie life. The thing was it was a dude in the dreams.
She huffs but takes it nevertheless “This alliance is on shaky ground. Watch yourself.” She pulls out her tablet. “Anyway, we’ve got plenty to review regarding Moondoor logistics.”
“It certainly captures the spirit of how paranoia can destroy trust. The depiction of the creature itself, a being of terrifying power without clear motives, was very accurate as well,” Cas says quietly.
Cas has so much to ask. Instead he just blurts out “You didn’t say anything.”
“Fuck off,” Dean says, throwing the dish towel at Cas’s head. “So rematch?”
Dean’s focused on surviving this pass. He doesn’t bother to turn and look at Cas.
Dean really does try to suppress his laughter, “Dude, if you don’t like the name, why did you agree to it?”
Apparently, everything in my life waited to happen in June. Alas.
“Where are you going,” Eileen asks.
“I’ve taken some classes from Mrs. Leahy. Her course on advanced warding was excellent. You’re featured heavily,” the old man says. What the fuck are those two telling people? Dean’s getting famous at this point.
“Cas, you okay?” Dean tries.
“I hear you,” Dean calls out. “Don’t get your panties in a twist.” Colette’s not a familiar but he’s pretty sure he hears an offended chirp.
Dean thinks about himself at that age. A high school dropout with six dollars to his name, a kid to raise, and no one to help. He could have used assistance in navigating the world, studying for his GED, and being a parent to Sam.
Sam looks back at the camper. “I may not understand but I get it.”
Something ugly turns in his gut at the thought of it. He swears to god if any of those fuckers make one asinine comment about Cas’s career choice or his name or anything else Dean’s going to break their face.
Cas glances down at the tulip resting on his palm. “And you Dean? Are you alright?”
“Don’t be afraid, I’m going to show you myself. My true self. Well, a projection into your mind. Your eyes would explode should you see my true form on earth,” Cas informs him. Good to know.
Castiel was right about one thing. His piece of shit car refuses to start. There’s at least a dozen things wrong with it.
“Yeah, you say you're an angel. So prove it,” Dean says. He has to be sure. He wants to have faith in Cas. “I’m an angel of the Lord” is asking a lot though.
“I’m a man,” Dean says. Surely it’s a solid counterpoint.
Castiel still has a B&B to run so Dean tries to busy himself. He’s bored within two hours so he wanders around. Wing and a Prayer B&B, 4.8 rating on Yelp, is located in an old turn of the century mansion. It’s painted a royal blue. Almost a jewel tone. The main house has five bedrooms for rent, with a living room, kitchen, formal dining room, and library available for guests.
“This is my angel blade. It is a weapon of immense power, touched by the Divine,” He tells Dean as he holds it up for him to examine.
There’s Castiel’s quarters, built in the old barn next to the house. The upstairs is an office, the downstairs his living space. Two additional lodgings sit off to the side of the house. Perhaps they were once for the servants. They’ve been renovated as stand-alone cabins for rent.
Dean lets out a little whine. “Come on, big guy, show me what you got.”
Cas opens his mouth as if to ask a question but it snaps shut. He tilts the hat back, squares his shoulders and utters what Dean wants to hear.
to get her through security?”
“You’re concerned about this?” Cas asks gently.
Dean feels for Cas. He’s not mentioned Jack’s mother so he probably was a single father.
Castiel offered to pay him. Dean has steadfastly refused. Castiel already does enough. Dean’s not gonna take his money. He hustles pool when he needs spending cash. Castiel frowns at him when he gets home.
Cas continues, unaffected by Dean’s protests, “Do you enjoy sunburn?”
“Tell me, have you seen Dean? Word around town is that he was
It’s the kind of place the supernatural love. A place to hide away in.
Dean, Sam, Eileen, and Charlie sit in the workshop. Drinking beer and talking about nothing in particular.
The angel shakes off the surprise, grabs Dean by the neck, and throws him off. He stands over Dean, looking furious. Fuck. Dean barely has time to react before a loud thunk sound fills the air.
“It was three points. I’d hardly consider that kicking my ass.”
“But nothing Sunshine. Sitting in bed while you get eaten by coyotes isn’t going to make me feel any better. Jesus.”
Dean leans across the counter, grinning. “I didn’t hear you try and stop me.”
Dean gives him a look, “I was gonna say you could have some time to think. This is a big decision. We could date for a while. Give some time for Jack to adjust.”
“Of course Dean.”
Dean puts his arms around Cas. “Come on my little luvdisc. It’s not the windows.”
Dean, you know you can always talk to me.
Dean throws his arms up and paces a bit before continuing, “Sam, the road trip wasn’t supposed to last forever. The way we talked about it, I was going to come home. I’m trying to say that I found what I was looking for out there.”
Sam offers Dean a room there. Dean stays for a while but it just doesn’t feel right. He slips into old habits. He’s bored. He fusses over Sam. He drinks a lot. With the hunting network in full swing, there are fewer cases for Dean to take. He feels like some kind of caged animal, pacing back and forth. Waiting. Just waiting for something, anything to happen.
There is another matter Dean has been wondering about. Dean should ask. He can do this.
“Cas…marriage isn’t just a business transaction. It’s a partnership. And there’s sex.” Dean argues.
“That’s it?” Dean asks, trying to get comfortable as he sits next to Cas.
He never does run over any strange men.
“Anna, love. I know. I know. Yes, I know love,” Cas stammers. He awkwardly coughs, as if trying to shake whatever’s bothering him. “Uh, she’s getting excited. Although the others are getting very suspicious. Colette dive-bombed me while I was packing despite me explaining at length that I would take them all if not for international law and cruise policy.”
“Very well,” Cas says, reaching inside his sleeve and pulling out a blade. He must have summoned it. It’s an impressive knife but not the kind of weapon Dean was expecting.
“Please.”
Dean blinks. His mind went blank at some point. Castiel doesn't move. Just looks at Dean, waiting for a response.
He can’t even figure out what Cas is. He can perform minor miracles, can somehow go to the moon, adores nature, and is a loving father. What kind of creature does those things?
“Dean.” Cas’s voice startles him. “I think you got a bite. Your line is moving.”
Dean gently catches Cas’s hand. It’s slimy with lotion. “I’m proud of you, Cas.” He gives his boyfriend a big, dumb smile. Cas leans down and kisses him.
Dean’s watching Cas debate water filters. Sam would be having the time of his life if he knew Dean was here, buying sensible shoes. Speaking of Sammy...
Cas hugs his son tight. “Love you Honeybee. I’ll see you in a few days. Give my best to Kevin and his mother. You three stay safe.”
Instead of politely declining, what comes out of Dean’s mouth is, “My husband likes to can.”
“I’m going to ask you more questions. Nothing else,” she says as she pulls on a pair of latex gloves.
His destination is technically a few miles east, but Dean figures Las Vegas is an acceptable detour. The drive from Lawrence to Vegas is about 18 hours. Dean takes a lot longer. It’s different from a hunt. There’s no end goal. He can just do whatever he likes.
The angel looks between Castiel and the blade. Between Dean and Castiel. He flares his own wings out, seemingly to meet Castiel’s challenge. This scruffy douche’s wings are a dull, muddy brown. Castiel’s on the other hand, are a beautiful deep charcoal color. He just molted too so they look extra shiny.
Dean wants to pin Cas under him and fuck him all over again but someone has to man the counter. He settles for a kiss. “I’ll see you soon. Mr. Winchester.”
“Hey Dean,” Jack says standing in the doorway. It’s only years of training that keep Dean from having a heart attack. The kid has an impressive ability to show up out of nowhere. An ability they get from their father, no doubt.
Dean plates their food and sits across from Cas. They talk about their plans for the day. Cas is going for some long nature stroll. Hard pass. Dean wants to read. He’s been working through
“It was rather unpleasant,” Cas admits
“You’re so beautiful,” Cas utters. “Such a beautiful soul.”
They’ve been slowly making their way up Interstate 84, toward Portland. Dean’s suspicious of the city although he’s hoping Cas will agree to a microbrewery tour. Gas station beer is starting to corrode his stomach.
Dean’s relationship with Castiel Novak is well, nothing between him and Cas has ever been typical.
Dean shakes his head, “She’s a good sport about letting me dress her up. She even let me put that cowboy hat on her for Halloween, remember? She was so adorable.”
Dean didn’t have a chance to swing by Crater Lake last time he was in Oregon. He’s been meaning to hit Mount Shasta again to see Jody and Donna. They can motor that way after Crater Lake. Cas agrees to the plan.
Jack begins to wiggle when he sees Cas.
“So, is that a yes?” Dean chokes out. He wiggles his eyebrows. He knows the answer but he needs to hear Cas say it.
Dean wonders sometimes what Castiel would have been like in his full glory. A mighty seraph, leading armies in the name of Heaven. Dean’s pretty sure they wouldn’t have gotten along. Humanity suits Cas.
Dean opens his mouth but Cas hushes him. Cas opens the tupperware container and takes a bite of pie before continuing, “Beloved, you are in my life because I want you here. You're the one I chose, out of all the people in this world. You are a kind, loving, and selfless man. That’s why you went on that hunt. There were people who needed your help. I know you were conditioned to shoulder the blame for everything by your father but many things in this life are out of our control. This was one of those times.”
Not done? Was there more?
“I didn’t realize I needed your permission before talking to strangers,” Dean says, mood souring.
“It’s ridiculous Dean. It’s the biennial Milton family reunion this year. Normally I wouldn’t even care but Gabriel is planning it this time. He wants me and the kids to go.”
“You got opinions on Pokémon now Cas? You didn’t even like the movie?” Dean accuses, turning in his seat so he can better glare at Cas.
He squares his shoulders, “Hello Dean.”
These people didn’t have anyone else to turn to so Dean and Sam agreed to take the case. He promised Cas he wouldn’t be gone that long. It was one banshee.
“Show me, please,” Cas pleads.
“Sir,” Cas pleads, “There’s no road straight to the interstate. You have to go south and then east.” He draws his finger along the only road that goes toward the interstate.
I came prepared
The nurse leaves him alone in the examination room after a few minutes. At least he doesn't have to take off his pants. The room is painted a muted salmon pink. If it’s meant to improve his mood, it isn’t working. The walls are lined with the same damn educational charts that are in every doctor’s office. Dean notices one entitled “The Soul in the Human Body” with little blue lines radiating out from the center forehead. Sure enough, one energy line runs right past the ear and slopes down toward the back of the skull. Further down, another one runs across the boob region.
There’s someone at the desk. It’s the same mechanic who helped them yesterday. A grizzled old man, typing angrily on the computer.
He saunters out, greeting Sam by chucking the bananas at his head. “Hey jerkface. Guess who just had the best night ever.”
“Hey, Dad! Wow. Poor Jubilee is really done for,” Jack observes as he gets out of the passenger side. “Mind if I have a look?”
Diplomacy is surprisingly easy when you’ve got a boyfriend who can light up like a glow stick and threaten to smite all three of the little shitbags. Two are typical cocky hunters, self-assured and not interested in really saving people. Cas puts the fear of god in them. Dean tells them to get real jobs.
Dean tells Castiel this over dinner, expecting some sympathy. Cas is his husband after all.
The sun is out today so the beach is very busy with families all around them. There’s college kids getting wasted. Interesting folks with metal detectors, sweep along the tide line.
“Mid-morning will do. I want to buy tickets early.”
Dean gives him his best reassuring smile, “It’ll be fine Cas.”
Dean grips the paper as if his life depended on it. “Right. Cas I…Fuck. Let’s back up. You know, you know I’m not straight. Right?”
Dean is not panicking. He’s in control of the situation. “So what, my soul decides to get all hot and bothered for my best friend? How am I going to explain this?”
“Jack, what have I told you about compliments? You studied hard for the test and received an excellent score.”
“It was four points off my best though.”
It’s early evening when they arrive back at the camper. Cas showers to get the the dust and horse smell off. He is dressing when Dean realizes he wants one more thing.
Dean sets the groceries down on the counter. He’s got enough for burgers tonight and he picked up a few things he knows Cas needs. As he shoves things into the fridge, around the mysterious jars and bird chop, he can hear Colette squawking. Bird is a damn drama queen.
“Goodbye my dear,” Michael says gently. His eyes snap to Dean. “Try not to harm my only nephew in that death trap.”
“I was only checking. The whole “being rusty” thing. I just wanted to make sure I romanced you correctly,” Dean answers, turning a very bright shade of red, again. He can’t be bothered to care right now. He’s got a boyfriend.
“Are you going to help me pick some shirts or not?” Dean says.
His work is coming along nicely. Some time away from the university, his tenure application, everything, has really done him some wonders. When he gets writer’s block, he goes out to the old orchard and simply takes a break. It gives him a chance to clear his mind. Think about other things. Think about Dean.
“I’m yours. I’m yours, Cas,” Dean pants out. He’s impressed with himself that he can still form words.
“Yes. Jack. He’s eighteen this year and a freshman in Seattle, here –” Cas pulls out his phone and begins showing Dean photo after photo from a folder entitled “Jack:)” Cas helping Jack move into his dorm, various photos of Jack at college, with friends, Jack standing in front of a  cabin. Cas stands there for a solid ten minutes, telling a man he barely knows, how great his son is. It’s a little surreal for Dean.
Vegas is Vegas. He gambles, meets a few lovely women, enjoys the Strip afterdark. Still, Vegas is full of traffic.
The rain finally lets up outside. The only sound now in the Impala is their breathing and Cas’s chewing. Cas works his hand back and forth across Dean’s scalp.
“Sir, I assure you, there is only one road to the interstate. Now, if you don’t intend to buy anything I have other customers waiting.”
Their postcard collection is getting quite large at this point. On the detour to Mount Hood, they decide to venture off I-5. There’s a lot of good camping between there and Crater Lake.
Cas scoots closer to Dean, “Did I ever tell you why I was on that mountain pass to begin with?
Dean frowns, “It’s none of your damn business. Look, I was only scoping out some places that Cas might be interested in. He’s stuffed in that house with, like ten million other people. He and Jack deserve some space. The house doesn’t need to be too big. But he needs a nice yard. He’s got his gardens. Lord knows he’s going to need a canning shed soon. Jack needs a place to play. We need a place for the chicken run.”
Dean expects an awkward pause. Cas doesn’t even hesitant.
“Afraid so kid.”
Dean’s not one to shit too much on the tourist scene. It is their entire economy at this rate but they get some real pieces of work in town. A lot of entitled jackasses who think they can talk down to everyone in town. They can suck it as far as Dean’s concerned. Who else is gonna fix their cars, pump their gas, or sell them processed junk food?
Charlie inhales her tart as she leans against Dean’s dresser. He can’t blame her. His lemon tart would make anyone cry. Dean nearly did the first time he tried it.
He gives a thumbs up.
The produce leaves a lot to be desired. The bananas are a disgusting shade of brown. Sam will have to live for a few more days without fruit before Dean musters up the energy to drive to the nearest big-box store.
“Couldn’t help but overhear your conversation from before. You know there’s a road that goes straight to the interstate. Hook a left at the diner up the street and follow the dirt road for a while. Ignore all the no trespassing signs. Just keeping going. Local secret.”
Retirement it is.
Cas turns, giving Dean the same smile.  “I see you’ve met Dean. You’ll enjoy his cooking. He’s a far better cook than I.”
That son of a bitch. Ever showing Cas
Feeling more centered, he positions himself against Dean. Cas slowly slides in, letting Dean adjust to being stretched open. Once Dean visibly relaxes, Cas circles his hips, never taking his eyes off Dean. As he begins to find a rhythm, he guides his angles and the roll of his hips, based on Dean’s reactions.
“Warm that up.” He instructs. Cas holds the lube between his hands and uses his very convenient angel powers to heat the bottle to a comfortable temperature. He throws it back to Dean so he can get to work preparing Cas.
“Do you think I grow flowers because I merely like you?”
He should call back and apologize. Try to actually explain himself. He doesn’t.
Dean and Cas spend the next hour yacking with each other. Sam wants to know all the gritty details of angel lore. Dean has to remind Sam that Cas does need to sleep after Sam pulls out his copy of the Vulgate and asks Cas to fact check it.
Dean visibly gulps. “Kinda like the realistic stuff.” He reaches into the drawer, skimming the bases of the silicone dildos. “Can’t believe you have a tie-dyed one.”
Their late start didn't matter. Dean doesn’t really care all that much about the fish part of fishing. It was mostly an excuse to spend a little quiet time outdoors, drinking beer, and relaxing with his best friend. If anyone was concerned with the fish, it was Anna since she kept staring at the water, eyes pinning anytime she saw movement.
Even out of the corner of his eyes, he can see the massive bitch face on Sam’s face, the one that says
Cas knows there’s a reason. It could be pride. It could be denial. Perhaps Dean does know and does not wish to speak about it. Cas has faith Bobby will come around though. He and Dean may fight but the deep love they share is undeniable. The lug nut wrench on Bobby’s arm did not develop by coincidence.
Dean’s brain grinds to a halt. He spits out his toast. “Mimikyu? MIMIKYU? How do I give off Mimikyu vibes?”
Dean glares at him, “I didn’t even say anything.”
Dean’s jaw drops. Cas starts to nod, “I think that is very perceptive Jack.”
He grabs Cas by the tie and hauls him close. He quickly finds the comb in the glovebox and starts to try and fix Cas’s hair, enough to look presentable.
“And what is that Dean? To seek vengeance for your father? Your father’s business with that demon is his own. To involve yourself will only cause unending torment,” Castiel says.
“What did you do this weekend?” Charlie asks, seemingly determined to make her point.
“Dean, I bloom for you already.”
Cas lets out a quiet laugh, “Dean. I know you do not share my faith but do you recall Genesis 1:27?”
“You two were plotting your revenge,” Dean states.
“After Jackson, I wanted to do something nice for you, to give you a token of our travels. I didn’t know how long we’d be together. Now I hope it will remind you of where we’ve been and where we still have to go,” Cas admits, grinning at Dean.
She continues to stuff stolen tortilla chips into her mouth. “And thanks to my skills you can now say that without choking up. But what’s the urgency? Not like we haven’t had this conversation before, Phil Connors.”
Dean is gonna deny it until the day he dies but he may have screamed the first time Cas drove him to work. It was only by the power of divine intervention that Cas’s axels didn’t break in half every time he got behind the wheel of his pimpmobile. It’s sort of understandable since Cas didn’t learn to drive well into adulthood and because he really didn’t need to fear anything.
Dean shrugs, “Shoot, doc.”
“I'm hungry Dean. I would like some eggs please,” Cas says as he yawns and stretches out.
Dean opens his mouth to refuse. He didn’t mean to stare. It’s just that mason jars were pricey and he had gotten into the habit of looking for deals. Cas’s garden kept expanding every year and so did his home canning operation. It was practically his second job when canning season was in full swing.
Cas isn’t quite asleep but he’s almost there. His back is exposed, showing off his tattoo. It had taken several sessions but damn, it looks good.
His bizarre tattoo.
“I love you,” he whispers.
“It’s a movie. For children,” She says.
Cas’s tone is perfectly even, sweet almost. “I don’t know what you’re referring to.”
“I insist Dean. It’s not common to find strangers so willing to offer assistance. Let me repay your kindness.”
Sam shrugs, “Yes, and?”
Jack doesn’t seem to notice or care about their squabble, “I want to hear Dean’s first. He did introduce me to Pokémon Go.”
Dean is not jealous.
Jack clears his throat, “I couldn’t decide for you Dean so I chose two. The first one is Machamp.”
“Dean, please stop.”
Dean doesn’t need the government or Heaven’s stamp of approval for it to count. He slid his mother’s ring on Cas’s finger and considered it good enough.
“I am. Your father has told me so much about you,” Dean says. Jack returns his smile as he shakes his hand.
Thankfully, after lunch his angel starts to fall asleep on the picnic blanket. Perfect. He flops on his back and grabs his copy of
This was supposed to be a Hallmark moment. Sam’s acting like it’s no big deal. “I expected crying, Sam. You’re always trying to get me to talk about my feelings. Where is the emotion?”
“He was so close to challenging me to fight in the parking lot. But I had Grill Master bestowed upon me by popular demand. No one can resist the Winchester All American Burger,” Dean boasts, “Except you.”
Cas relents. He can’t help it, he adores all his soul marks, He strokes the flower with his thumb. “Very well, you may flail about a little bit. I feel the same but I am in no way responsible if Dean questions us.”
Well, one banshee and three weeks later, Dean feels like shit. Cell service is spotty out here so the last time he spoke to Cas and Jack was several days ago. Worse, he’d broken his promise to Cas, hell at this rate Cas was probably going to dump him for being a fuck-up.
“Dean,” Anna says darkly, imitating Cas’s voice. “
“I know where you keep your angel blade. I will use it if necessary,” Dean threatens.
“I’m sure this is boring you. I’m just a mechanic. Not really that much compared to your work.”
“So why do they want you dead?” Dean asks. Maybe Castiel broke some angel law.
Dean does disagree with Cas’s assertion that he’s not trying to replace the tour guide. Between photographs, he leans into Dean and tells him all sorts of fun elk facts.
As usual the only sound is Cas tossing and turning. It’s been gnawing at Dean for days. Cas hasn’t said anything but Dean can see he’s not sleeping well. Kinda unfair for Dean to have his awesome memory foam while Cas gets the lumpy cushions.
He tries to respond but nothing comes out. He is at a loss for words. Cas understands. He pulls Dean close.
Despite his love affair with Dr. Sexy, Dean would rather pull teeth than see any sort of medical provider. Cas knew that. He wouldn’t ask Dean to go if he didn’t think it was necessary.
Cas stepped forward right into Dean’s personal space, “I felt the depth of your conviction at that moment. Few people can perceive my true form. That is why I wanted to speak with you. My brother has strongly suggested I need to “make friends” with people I am not related to by blood or the bonds of employment.  You work at Singer's Automobile, do you not? Perhaps we could be friends?
“Don’t be such a prude.”
Dean’s making a pie tomorrow. From scratch. Cas has got a kitchenaid stand mixer straight from Dean’s dreams.
“You were right. He does have a very bright soul,” Jack observes. Okay, so Jack really is his father, just with less of a filter.
“Yes?” Dean repeats. He couldn’t have misheard that. Right?
The bucket hat moves, Dean can see Cas’s eyes crack open, “Anna loves the ocean. I think she would like to see it again.”
That is a matter for another time. Or at least tomorrow morning. He just wants to be with Dean right now.
“What do you mean by that,” Dean demands to know.
Dean isn’t going to pass up the chance to look like Thomas Magnum, “Fine. Fine. Why don't you choose more for me, since you're an expert in tacky cruise wear.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Awww, I miss you too <3
He’s got a little fridge in his cabin. Dean hopes there’s something cold in there. He opens the door. Castiel is sitting on the bed. He looks pissed.
Cas grimaces, “He tried but I got Adam to suggest more age-appropriate books.”
A loud bell heralds their arrival as Dean follows behind Cas The place is packed with plants of all types. Dean’s been driving through the Northwest but he doesn’t think he’s ever seen more green in his life.
That gets a dramatic sigh from the kid as he pulls out his ID and shoves it in Cas’s face. Dean bristles. The fucker doesn’t have to be an asshole about it. It’s standard Gas-n-Sip policy
The flush is beginning to return. “Are you telling me Cas caused this? Cause’ it's been a while since we met.”
Less than forty-eight hours after they defeated Chuck, there’s a sickening gloopy sound that echoes within the entire bunker. Its source is the dungeon.
Cas just squeezes his hand and smiles.
“Isn’t that what you want?
“Above-average. We’re still doing the Crucible in English. Come on Felix, take the mouse. I got a 94 on the algebra test. Felix, please this is a high-quality rodent. What else? I checked on my tomatoes starts today. They’re growing appropriately, they should be ready for the school plant sale next week. Felix, please.”
“Yeah, a little,” Charlie agrees. Dean stares at his burrito instead of responding.
The photograph is still in Dean’s wallet. Its corners are frayed, there’s a crease across one edge but the inscription is as clear as ever.
Cas takes Dean’s hand. A silent “I love you.”
Jody’s face goes cold. Dean doesn’t know why. Benny isn’t a threat.
It’s just past 2:00 pm. He is due for another application at 2:30 pm but Cas is practically comatose. Dean’s not gonna wake him up.
May the Lord have mercy. What kind of desire is that?
After Cas had calmed Dean down and clarified the whole “I’m an incarnation of an angel thing”, it hadn't taken Dean long to fall in love.
Dean gulps. “Why?” Dean’s beginning to suspect he knows why. But it can’t be. He’s known Cas for five years. Nothing’s changed between them.
“I don’t like this one. It gets too much eastern exposure. We’ll roast in the mornings,” Cas complains as he glares at the windows in some fixer-upper they’re touring. It’s the fourth one today.
Right. Dean has the bad habit of calling everything at work a case, even if it was updating encyclopedia entries.
An hour later, he’s in the middle of drafting his reports when his phone vibrates. If it’s Sam with another photograph of the ocean, he's gonna throw his phone out the window.
“Let me finish,” Dean says, “When we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day.”
Michael looks constipated at this point. Dean ignores him. “Anything you want. You can even order extra whip cream.”
They fumble toward the bed, both not wanting to break contact. Once seated, Dean gently takes hold of Cas’s hand and guides it to his shoulder. “Hold that there. Just like that. The next step would be to touch yours. Fuck. I didn’t tell Doctor Mills you had two. Which one should I…”
Dean takes a sip of beer. Cas doesn't need to hear the gory details of his fight with Sam. All the same, Cas is a practical stranger. It might be good to get an outside perspective.
Dean should just shut the hell up and kiss Cas but he keeps running his mouth. “But you only wanted to move in with me. Kinda a leap there, buddy.”
Cas turns to see if he can spot the kids. “Your family has cottage cheese for brains, Cas. Do you know that? Whatever. Hit me with the Milton trivia.”
“You have one, don’t you sunshine. Don’t weasel you’re way out. I know where you sleep,” He says. Jack leans forward eagerly to hear. Cas can’t resist Jack’s earnest face.
Cas looked at him curiously. Dean rambled on, “It’s not gonna replace your wings but it might be nice. You know as a memorial. That’s not the right word. Fuck. You know what I mean.”
“Hey, easy, easy,” Dean says, running his hand up and down Laurelin. “Just relax. Are you okay? No pain?”
Cas doesn’t say anything. Dean wonders if he’s misread the situation.
“Did you sleep well, sunshine? Dean asks. The bags under Cas’s eyes tell him the answer.
Hopefully, tonight will be less eventful.
The depth of which he could never accurately describe in any language. He tries his best anyway. “I, thank you, Dean. You are like family as well.”
“Thank you, I think I will sleep much better with you,” Cas says, already getting up. Why did he have to phrase it like that?
“I was talking to Sam again about changing the name to the Leahy and Winchester Institute of Supernatural Learning once I get my degree. The jerk refused since there’s two of them and one of me. Eileen said she’d consider it if the numbers were even.”
He’s on the ground. On his back. There’s six great wings around him.
Cas will avoid it today. Last time, Dean nearly set his edition of
He can hear the pride in Cas’s voice, “I was assigned to watch over Jack’s mother, Kelly. Jack was still in the womb but he was quite perceptive. He knew Kelly was not going to survive his birth. No human could. She asked me to protect her son. I agreed and Jack chose me right then as his father. His protector. I’ve watched over him ever since.”
Dean bursts out laughing, beer snorting out his nose. It burns.
“I overheard Bobby talking with you. As I said, I don’t tend to interact with hunters but Meg does. She’s taken some classes with Eileen and Sam. Apparently you feature heavily,” Cas says, eyes still intensely fixed on Dean.
“My name is Castiel,” was the first thing out of Castiel's mouth. Dean glanced down to the nametag. Real helpful.
Jack comes up behind them, gingerly patting the mirror, “I think it’s smoking less than when we arrived.”
He can feel Cas’s eyes boring holes into his head. “You are correct. There are people who are not you.”
Cas can hear the edge in Dean’s voice, “First of all, you do. Second of all, the Cas I know maybe stubborn sometimes but he would have called his best friend for help when his car broke down. Did I piss you off?”
Dean owns a cowboy hat for just such an occasion. He had to run to the local thrift store for Cas’s cowboy hat emergency though. The only one in stock was from the Calgary Stampede. Odd to find in California but it would do.
It really started when Sam met Eileen. She had ended up working the same case that Dean and Sam were on. Suspected banshee giving an old folks home trouble. She stabbed the sucker right in the heart with a golden knife. Sam had been smitten ever since.
They drive to Crater Lake, as usual they take their sweet time, constantly diverging from I-5, mostly because Cas wants to stop at every mountain peak. Maybe Dean does too but it’s mostly Cas.
The inkeep is sitting on him.
“I would love that Dean. We deserve some rest.”
Dean isn’t going to disagree.
Dean tries to act offended. As always, it fails. “I’m happy we’re all getting along, plotting ways to destroy each other in party games.”
“I am certain you will find the outdoors more enjoyable with the proper shoes.”
“Yep. Would be kinda nice not to have a pounding headache constantly.”
Dean should get a move on but he’s tired. He slept too many nights on the bench seat of the Impala during his hunting days. At least now, he’s got an actual mattress. He doesn’t need his usual four hours right now, a quick nap should suffice.
He and Dean shared a profound bond once.
Dean looks at Castiel. Sometimes he forgets just what Castiel is. He seems so human most days. But Dean knows better, he still remembers the day they met. He should just relent. All the same, stubborn pride boils up. Dad had told him that pride would be his downfall.
Cas shrugs, “It seemed apt.”
“Yeah, traffic was actually...what is this?  Claire asks, looking at the box in horror. “Please don’t tell me you’re making matching shirts for Anna”
“Cas, I need to say something.”
Cas is snoozing next to Dean, feet propped up on the cooler, book resting in his lap. The bucket hat declaring “Size does matter” that Claire bought him rests low on his forehead. Instead of his usual get-up, he’s got on a soft pullover and old jeans that hug his thighs so well. Not that Dean would notice.
Oh. “This isn’t about my car.”
That is the moment Jack shows up.
They’re called zomhosts. They build character. Patience is the most important virtue of any hunter.
“Man, there are at least a dozen places we could look at. There’s a lot a few miles down the road from the Novak fortress. House is kinda run down. Nothing your angel mojo and some power tools won’t fix. I’ll build you a proper canning shed though. It would get too hot in the kitchen if I’m using the oven and you’re canning going during the summer. It would require some logistics but I think I can build Jack a playset. I saw some cool designs online.”
Dean had his sexaulity crisis way back when. As many kids surely do. There was a cute boy in his 10th grade chemistry class. They would talk for hours after school, sitting far too close together. Dean was only at that high school for a few months so nothing ever happened. Except the sexuality crisis part.
It’s a truck camper in good condition, roughly a decade old. Dean’s spent the last month researching his options. Thankfully Youtube is a thing. There’s no end of people willing to point a camera at their face and give an in-depth tour of their camper or RV. The truck camper seems right. It’s just gonna be Dean so he doesn’t need a lot of space.
He motors on over to the Gas-n-Sip and gets out. He needs to monitor the process or else Meg might set his car on fire.
“Don’t be dramatic. I’m just wondering when you’re coming home,” Sam retorts.
He feels safe around Cas. He likes sleeping in a bed with him. He enjoys his company.
Once Cas has some food in him, Dean flops over, resting his head in Cas’s lap, snuggling against his belly as he closes his eyes. Cas smells faintly of orange soda and industrial laundry soap.
Dean’s not tracking “What now?”
Cas wonders if Dean is going to try and talk him into saving Jubliee if only to avoid the smart car or lecture him about car maintenance. Dean all but hauls Cas out of the kitchen as soon as he finishes drying the last dish.
“Leave,” Castiel barks. “I will not miss next time.”
“That’s hardly needed. My shift is over at 6:00 am. We can pick up Jack and get takeout at the pancake house he likes. He’s probably not feeling well enough for school anyway.”
Cas shifts a little, “I realized something when you were gone. I want to move in with you.”
