What still doesn't add up is this body. This
“This body... fits me better,” Dean says, awkwardly.
“I... I didn't wanna lose you. Or Bobby.” Sam sees a muscle jump in Dee's jaw, his torn up knuckles tight on the steering wheel.
Bobby's eyes slowly widen until he's practically pop-eyed, staring at Dean. “Sam... what did you do?” he asks softly.
“Jack's in the Empty?” Dean chokes out.
Anger closes Dean's face again. “Why make me trans in the first place then, huh? If
“No,” Sam says, “It's nothing.” He stands up from where he was sitting on one of the beds. “All good?”
Fair point. Dean shrugs. “I guess not.”
Dean looks up and whatever Bobby sees in his face makes him flinch. “Sweet Jesus,” Bobby mutters, staring at Sam.
He can hear his heartbeat thudding in his ears, picking up speed. He takes another breath. Something has changed.
They sit there in silence. Finally, Sam says, quietly, “I'm glad you didn't have to kill him.”
“Yeah?” Bobby answers.
“One hit and you're on the floor,” Dad says, disgusted. “Didn't I teach you better than that?”
Dean's eyes widen but he doesn't let go. Castiel can feel his breath, hear his heart beating faster. Dean must still be worried.
is attracted to him. He's always been attracted to women, though acting on it was obviously complicated. He's admired men, sure, but that's only because he wanted what they had, isn't it?
Some things never change. “Sure,” Sam says.
“It's really very similar to the other one. The end result will be the same.” Castiel needs to tread carefully.
Sam laughs. “So you could come back.”
Dean starts to get up too, and stops when Cas touches him. “Dean,” he says, intensely.
“Been readin’ all these books you know? Seen all sorts of things, stuff about creatures. And angels.”
“Please Chuck, please make me bleed.”
going. He regretted nothing, but it didn’t mean he wasn’t apprehensive.
“S-stop! Dean! Hmppphh.” Cas bit his lip and turned away.
“I know.”
He shoved, but Dean was heavy and solid. Dean spread lube between the cracks of his ass, wormed his way between Cas’ legs even as he tried to keep them closed. Every time Cas tried to roll over or head towards the edge of the bed Dean would yank him around and smother him. There wasn’t any room between them, no space to throw a punch, no air to breathe, no weak points to tackle.
“I’ll kiss it better, see.” Dean leaned over and planted a sloppy wet kiss on his cheek, and then nuzzled into his neck. “God, I have missed this.”
“Yeah…”
Dean hummed, cocking his head, “Are you finally smart enough to know impossible odds when you see them? Is that why you won’t fight back?”
Dean watched as the blood on the bright white walls slowly faded. As the details of his torment disappeared as though they had never existed. One by one every spot of red flickered, gone, sayonara.
“You know I can’t.” Sam spoke sadly. “It was a nice dream though, wasn’t it?”
“There’s nothing… Dean there’s no source for this pain.”
Sam, hallucination though he was, gasped indignant and rose to his feet.
“I made it good, I tried to be gentle.”
“Whatever you say, Cas.” Dean clambered off, pulled
“You have me.”
“I’ll make it good, it ain’t gonna hurt. Trust me, alright?”
“Yeah.” Dean grunted, slumped low over Cas until his head rested between the crook of each wing. “Aren’t they beautiful? Told ya.” Dean turned his head, “We can get on with the plan later, definitely later. Get a message out to, uhhh, tell our source to get us word on the location. We needa know where Sam—Lucifer— is.”
It happened oh so fast, and ever so slow. The first push, insistent, the pain flared bright and new and vivid and Cas keened. He thrashed, and Dean held him tighter. His arms were used for leverage, Dean gripped with demonic strength and the blade was still in his hand, pressed in a line against Cas’s forearm, promising things Cas didn’t want.
“Sam, he's coming home. He's coming back to us,” Cas groaned.
Dean appraised him with a look of disbelief. “That seems unlikely, with how you two are joined at the hip. It never was right, that he got into your pants before me.”
“Tick tock, Sammy. Cas is waiting for you to reply.”
“Yeah, Cas, you will. ‘Cause you need to be ready to fight in case Chuck comes back.”
“Is that all?” he asked, turning around to face Dean.
There was
Cas was sleep mussed and sluggish and caught off guard, that must be all, but he could fight this. He felt how hard Dean was through his jeans and briefly had time to wonder how he was keeping it up while so wasted before Dean ground down so forcefully Cas was surprised it didn’t hurt.
with it made his dick twitch. And well, Cas would have to see eventually if they really were stuck together.
But like this? Like this it was too much, too wrong, too broken.
“How does it feel Cas?”
He rolled onto his stomach and pushed onto his knees, loathing the sound of the chain slithering across the floor, and the shifting feeling of the metal plug that tethered him in place. He just got his knees under him as Chuck materialised at the north wall and clapped his hands.
Dean’s hands pulled at the hem of his shorts, started to move them down his hips and it took everything in Cas not to shift with the tug and let them be pulled free. Not like this, out of nowhere with no explanation.
And maybe, Dean thought, he wouldn’t even need to ask.
“He's a little occupied at the moment,” Dean replied, closing his fist again so Cas gasped, mouth open and tongue panting for slips of air.
Sam stepped forward and drew his hands away. “Don’t, that won't work. And you’re not horny, it’ll only hurt.”
The room sustained Dean as long as Dean fed it his pain, his tears, his blood, and stayed exactly where he was meant to stay.
He didn’t sleep here, by Chuck’s design, and he didn’t eat here, by Chuck’s command, and he didn’t speak here unless there was someone to speak to—which there never was, and when Chuck was here it was mostly screaming, anyway.
Chuck found them with Dean sitting on Cas’s lap, legs splayed out to either side, and Cas buried to the hilt inside him. Dean’s head resting on his shoulder, the pain gone, as he was full and stretched wide.
Dean thrust forward, drove deeper and bit down, teeth digging into the soft tender flesh of Cas’ shoulder. Cas cried out, and Dean shushed him, fucked him like he was trying to bury them both in the mattress dick first, and Cas’ body was the only barrier getting in the way.
He was stuck here, with only Dean, and Dean’s hands and his words and all the things that should have been given freely but instead were being stolen.
“You’re not. I’ve seen sorry on you and this is not it.”
Despite the presence of someone else, he was
“Sam didn’t send me, in fact he asked me to stay away,” Cas replied calmly.
Humiliation burned, and he wished—not for the first time—that the rush of blood to his cock, and heating his face, was enough to sate the room’s insatiable desire. It wasn’t, it wouldn’t be. And now Cas was here to see exactly what Chuck had made of him.
Dean nodded, clenching in pain again. “He said—keep me occupied, and, well he knew ordinary torture wouldn’t work on me so… he got creative. The room is kind of an extension of him, I think. When I bleed, or come, or cry, it doesn’t hurt me. But if I’m not held down the way I’m supposed to be…”
“It doesn’t
“Shh, it won’t hurt. It won’t.”
“You weren’t with me, you were sleepin’. I was awake all alone.”
Cas waited a beat in an uncomfortable silence and Dean thought he was going to refuse, his hopes for some other kind of stimulation bleeding out, and feeling dashed on the floor amongst the blood.
“This… my wings. You’ve ruined…”
There was a humiliated flush across Dean’s chest, warming his face, but he was also comfortable, soothed. He’d been invaded by metal ever since he arrived here, only going seconds without the hook or the plug. And now he had flesh, real and live and throbbing. Cas settled and moved with him, was warm and so much less intrusive. So the embarrassment, the debasement, he could take—if it meant Cas stayed.
“Yeah, let’s do it, please. I can… could beg, if ya want. Maybe press on some of these wounds and I’ll make you come just from writhing around on you.”
“Call me, when you need help with those wings. I’m not going to be more of a dick about it than I already have been, you’ll need a hand. And… they’ll want it to be me.” Dean turned with a decisive nod and left. Cas wasn’t sure but he thought he heard the door lock from the outside, hemming him in.
“Mad?”  Dean didn’t understand how his partner couldn’t see it.  “Cas, Baby, I was terrified.  You said you’d let me know when you needed me to take care of you.  I need to be able to trust your judgment… To be able tot trust that you’ll call any time – every time – you need me.”
Dean cleared his throat and coughed again.  “Fine, sir.”  He adjusted himself in his boxers, sinking down in the couch to relieve some of the strain as he waited for his erection to calm down.  The sound of crumpling foil sparked his curiosity again and he felt the need to hold onto the couch cushions to prevent himself from getting up to see what Castiel was cooking.
Dean felt his face heat up as Castiel held him in place.  “Yes, sir,” he admitted.
“Sir,” he pressed his hip further into Castiel's hand.  “Please.”
“Dean, stop.”  Castiel stared blankly ahead.  “I am not ignorant, nor am I blind.  We’ve talked about honesty.  Please don’t condescend to lie to me about this.”
“I liked that last night, even though you were in charge, I was allowed to choose the movie.  I mean, give me the choice of Willow and Dragonheart.  Nine times out of ten, I'll choose Willow.  But...”  He turned to face Castiel and let his thought trail off.  In his way, Dean was saying thank you.  He was letting him know he appreciated even the little ways Castiel showed the value of Dean's opinion.
, not walk?”  Sam sounded incredulous, like this wasn’t the hundredth time he asked Dean about his foray into the world of exercise.  Dean wished he could see his brother’s smirk.  It had been too long since they had seen each other in person.  Their phone calls were nice, but no comparison to the real thing.
“Well, my girlfriend’s parents had a jar of the stuff.  Dean used some and fell in love.”  Sam raised his eyebrows suggestively before patting his brother on the shoulder.  “Well, I’ll leave you two to it.  Better pick up another purple jar, we’re running low again.”
“Dean,” Castiel pleaded and more was spoken in the name than Dean could bear.
Castiel understood.  Dean had to find what worked for him, much like Cas was figuring out how to navigate himself through depression.
Sensing something amiss, Dean tried to lighten the mood.  “You would think that a person who literally owns a sandwich shop, could find something to eat.”
“Right, yeah. Well, if you do end up sticking around you'll have to subject yourself to them anyway.”  He handed Dean his phone.  “What did you have in mind?”
Dean became side-tracked immediately.  Castiel's looked like a magazine, with tall plants in the corners and a weird combination of furniture that somehow came together.  He pulled Castiel into the living room, spotting shelves of knick-knacks and photos of who he assumed were Cas's brothers.  Little figurines lined the highest shelf like soldiers.
He counted freckles and scars, taking a breath to cover each inch of Dean from his crown to his soles with kisses.  Castiel saturated his body as though tenderness could penetrate Dean's shell.  That his spirit might understand that he was worthy, cherished, and cared for.
Gabriel was teaching Dean his secret to flakey pie crust when Castiel called from work.
Castiel did as he was told, moving hesitantly as he was still without sight.
“Gabriel sent you to spy on me?”  Cas muttered under his breath as he shrugged off his suit jacket.
Dean,
Well, he thought, he’d already opened the dialogue; what harm could it do to ask?
Castiel moaned and shuddered before he yelled, “Stop!”
Dean held up his end of the conversation and shared about his love for reading.  He shared about how he used to struggle through reading comprehension assignments in school, but overcame it by listening to music or tapping out a beat as he read.  While many people told him he was only further distracting himself, he found that the additional stimuli actually helped him concentrate.
“We’ll meet you at St Mary’s General.”  Gabriel hung up once he heard Dean grunt in agreement.
Thank you to everyone for your kudos, comments, subscriptions, and bookmarks!
Dean pushed the blindfold up and off his face.  “I’ve got you,” he repeated, staring into the blue depths of Castiel’s eyes.
Dean exited the email composition screen and the blank page saved as draft.  Rolling over, he pulled his sheets snug around him and settled in to sleep.  One thought persisted on his mind, vying to be noticed.
For Dean, their relationship was a serious divergence from 'normal' and Castiel admonished himself for slipping into fantasy during downtime.  This was Dean's time to vent and explore his limits.  It was Castiel's time to discover how Dean really felt about their play.
Dean kissed him and asked, “Would you like a drink of water?”
Dean hoped, for their sakes, that the man knew what he was doing.
Still, no change.
When Cas went on to talk about his relationship with Michael, Dean's heart almost broke.   Cas discussed Michael's job with the CDC, bouncing all over the world to study epidemics in war-torn countries.  The way Cas spoke about Michael, with concern and pride, made it sound like he was the older one of the two.  Dean could relate to his fears about Michael being so far from home having experienced similar (though not identical) fears having Sam across the country at college.  Dean shared how his relationship with Sam had changed since he left and wondered aloud if things would ever go back to the way they were.
Dean couldn't remember the last time he ran.  High school.  Maybe.
The submissive’s eyes welled with unshed tears and gave a barely noticeable shake of his head.  The stage disappeared as a door closed between them.  Castiel found himself in a cramped hallway nothing like the front of the club.  The smell of sweat and leather nearly choked him and his illusions of the club shattered.
Dean unlocked the door and ushered Castiel into the apartment.  He pointed out the doors for his bathroom and bedroom as they made their way through to the kitchen.  The kitchen area opened up to a decent sized living room, separated by a breakfast bar instead of a closed wall.  Castiel set the pizza box down, grateful to unload the hot and oily cardboard.  He gestured toward the sink, “May I?”
Castiel's eyes lifted to Dean's with a spark of disbelief, then his head tipped in a slow nod.  He didn't call for Dean to follow him or express gratitude for the companionship.  He just turned and walked down the hallway without a word.
Keeping his focus on the TV screen, Castiel swatted at Dean's hand and made a noise that would have been a giggle if not for the depth of his voice.  “That tickles.”
At the garage, Dean was counting down the hours.  He had been feeling
“No, he was hiding behind the counter when I came in.  Didn't see him until he started necking with the cashier.”
Castiel considered it a moment.  Dean was mouthy, opinionated, and inexperienced.  He doubted Dean wished for the role Anna assumed in their relationship.  Castiel believed he would be much better suited to the role of submissive, with perhaps a few hours of scheduled puppy play per week.  Instead of shooting down the idea outright, Castiel offered him a trial.  “You will kneel at my side at dinner.  You will not speak when you are on your knees.  You will eat what I provide.”  Castiel looked down at Dean's upturned face.  “After we eat, I will tell you when to stand.  You will no longer be my pet.  And we will return to the couches to speak.”
“So, how long are you around?”  Dean tucked into his sandwich with gusto.
Setting his jaw, Castiel mumbled under his breath, “You’re still mad about that.”

“8? 8:30.  He said he'd come straight from work.  Maybe I should call him.”
of making food for himself either.
Dean rocked forward as he thrust and his free hand found Castiel to keep from topping over.  He paused, looking down at his Dom, wondering if this physical contact was allowed.
“That’s what I was thinking about before we started,” Dean admitted, finally.  “Kissing you.”
A/N:  Another brief instalment.  Wish I had more for you guys.
“Feathers or leather?” Dean asked, craning his neck like he was trying to see something hidden behind Cas's back.
Dean shifted from foot to foot.  “Do you know Defiance?”
Friday night Castiel found himself at the office long after closing, headphones blaring symphonies because – no – lyrics were definitely not welcome in this space.  His ears ached with every blast of horns and screech of the strings, but the music did its job.  In moderate discomfort, Castiel's mind was unable to bombard him with thoughts of the club.  Finally, he could steamroll through his work.  Cramming a full week's agenda into the last five hours certainly did not bring forth the best quality, but even a stickler like Castiel could tell that he wasn't going to produce anything better in his current state.
“Good. Just waiting for my next job to start.”  Dean craned his neck to see if any cars were coming down the street.  “Guy's late.”
Dean was caught off guard by the question, but it seemed a fairly safe subject.  No mistaking this for flirting.  He answered honestly, “Not so much.  Well, a few days per month?  Maybe people think that’s a lot.  Most don’t get this bad.  I take medicine when I feel it coming on and it helps.  I didn’t have any on me when we went to the concert.  The heat, the noise, the lights… triggered a bad one.”
There was a long pause where neither knew just what to say.
“Yeah, yeah.” Gabriel continued to open envelopes and placed them in separate piles: bills and junk.  “You think Cassie's sick?”  He doesn't look up as he asks, but Dean suspects real interest.
“Curl your fingers, Dean. Deeper, boy. More. Right th- Aah!” Castiel ground his hips down toward Dean until he buried the fingers as far as they could go. “Come on, Dean. Right there.”
“Yeah, he’s pleasant,” but the way Dean enunciated pleasant didn’t sound like that was the word he’d choose.  Deans hung by the table as Castiel filled the orders for an older couple.  He took his time looking at a few of the smaller jars.  He could guess they were different jams, maybe experimental flavors since there were so few of each type.
Dean didn't bother correcting his use of pronoun and came up beside him.  Leaning into Cas's space, Dean promised, “After work, Baby and I are going to take you out.”  His hand slipped up Castiel's back before settling one arm around his shoulders.  Dean ran his free hand over the Impala's roof. “What time should we pick you up?”  Dean stood at the driver's side door, head tipped toward Castiel.
Dean followed Cas outside and left Kali to deal with her husband.
Dean wanted to bury his head in his hands, but was unable to do more than turning his face toward the back of the couch.  “It's becoming less relaxing and more...”  He let out a grunt of frustration as he strained against Castiel’s hold on his arm.  “It makes me want... other stuff.”
“Yes, Sir.” Dean did as he was told and carefully retraced his work.
Eventually it had cooled enough for Castiel to slip into the water.  He thought things had been going pretty well.  He had a productive day at work; his mind was mostly quiet. But there was something nagging at him, the nasty little voice.  Self-depricating and destructive.  Castiel had spent many years trying to ignore it's message and prove it wrong.
Castiel helped him onto the sofa and laid him out, abandoning the bowl of soupy dessert on the end table.
When Castiel lowered him to lay on his stomach, Dean let out a soft groan in discomfort.  Confused, Castiel knelt beside him and noticed the problem.
His first séance seemed like a flop.  Castiel sat on the floor in the parlor with a candle and his third bottle of beer.  He knew better than to get sloppy drunk before communing with the dead, but he really didn’t want to do this sober.  Everyone had warned him that his physical handicap would make him an easy target for a vengeful spirit.  He shouldn’t try to make contact alone, in his weakened state.  The discouraging negativity of the hunters who used to rely on him as a leader and fighter nagged at the corners of his mind.  By the middle of his beer, Castiel had thought he had found a happy medium in a light buzz.  He was only just able to silence their voices and readied himself to engage the other realm.
“Ha. If you only knew.” Gabriel and Dean lifted the crib and set it against the wall, away from the windows and the air vents. Then they moved onto the next big projects, a dresser and a bookcase.
“You could help.  I know you can cook; you own a shop for fuck sake.”  Dean hated to see Cas sick and Gabriel's bullshit was wearing his patience thin.
As they walked, Castiel tried to elicit Dean's preferences by asking him a few pointed questions.  “What is the main theme of the scene?  How should the it end?”
Castiel's fingers continued to move over his head and neck, soothing Dean's worry as if he was the one who needed saving tonight.  It baffled him.  Dean wanted to be the one offering comfort, not accepting it.
“Sure, um.”  Dean finished the rest of his beer in one go before stumbling though an answer.  “I guess I just couldn't... didn't want to do it anymore.  It was fine, at first.”  After a long sigh, Dean shook his head and dropped his gaze.  “Just took it's fuckin' toll after a while.  Don't know how the others do it.”
Dean brought his hands down to Castiel's hips and kissed him once more.
Castiel's hand lingered over the fluttering patch of skin.  He wondered if it was a foot or hand.  “I'd be happy just stealing yours for the moment.”
Dean sidled up real close and pressed his face into Castiel's neck.  He was smiling. Regardless of the ever-changing tides of their relationship, Dean was happy.  They were figuring themselves out and getting through it together.
Castiel nodded.  His throat sounded dry when he spoke. “OK.”
New text messages from DW.  Castiel had saved his contact information under the initials since Dean seemed so fond of them in his emails.
Cas recaptured Dean's hand and dragged him in before he had the chance to pull further away.  He tipped Dean's face up.
Dean raised his finger and nodded to indicate that he had questions but needed a moment to finish his mouthful of food.  “I didn't know you experimented with being Submissive.”
“Good,” Castiel spoke clearer than before.  Dean could tell he was coming out of the daydream, but he wasn’t panicking like before.
Dean parked the Impala in front of Castiel's home without explanation.  It didn't make sense to go back to the apartment when Castiel was so clearly out of it.  Dean figured Cas would do better in familiar surroundings, the comforts of his own home, and so he asked Castiel for his house keys and let them in the front door.
“Depression?”
Every now and then, the stranger let out little whimpers.  He brought his knees to his chest and at one point fisted a hand in Castiel’s shirt.  When he settled down again, his breaths even and slow, Castiel returned his hands to the man’s hair.  He tried asking what the guy had taken, if he was on any pills.  But when he started to speak the man buried his face deeper into Castiel’s hip and shook his head in protest.
Dean put on his best set of puppy-dog eyes.  “Please, sir.”
Castiel pulled the guy’s arms from his jacket and tossed it onto the table.  The flannel button up was next.  Who wore layers in the summer anyway?  He left him in a grey Henley and brushed the matted hair from his face.  And damn, was that a good-looking face.  Castiel studied the lines of the stranger’s jaw and nose, his eyes lingering on the pair of full lips.  Under normal circumstances, Castiel thought he would take time to put each freckle to memory.  Maybe even ask the guy to model for a portrait, and not just use it as a pick-up.  Castiel shook the fantasy from his thoughts.  The man had blacked out on the dance floor and it was no time to ogle.
Thank you to everyone who is reading, commenting, subscribing, and leaving kudos!
DW: so r u working hard or hardly working? ;)
Hooking his chin over his companion's shoulder, Castiel spoke quietly, his breath ghosting over Dean's neck. “Good night, Dean.  I'll see you in the morning.”
“Dean?”  Castiel spoke as he stilled his lover’s hand.
By the time Dean had unpacked the car and put away the groceries, Castiel had still not finished in the bathroom.  Dean stood outside the door and listened to make sure his boyfriend was safe.  Sounds of water running and the regular clunk of soap bottles let Dean breathe a bit easier.  Unlikely that Castiel would hear him should he knock, Dean looked around the house for something to pass the time.
Dean's cheeks flushed darker, a shy smile on his lips.  Castiel was in awe to be so close to Dean's pouty mouth.  He had fantasized about that mouth for months.  What he would give to feel his kiss.
“The scientific community is gonna need more than 'I think', Doctor.”
“Dude,” Gabriel interrupted without tact.  “If you’re gonna give my brother a little square box, you best be on one knee.”
The laps passed quicker this time as Dean imagined zombies lurking around the corners of buildings.  He was a warrior and danger lurked behind trash cans and shrubs.  He ignored the ache in his ankles and shins, the burn in his chest, and pushed himself harder.
Castiel dragged Dean and two giant shopping carts up and down the isles of, what he called, “a
Dean heard the faint beeping of his alarm clock, but it sounded too far away to be real.  His phone buzzed in his pocket until it fell with a crash against the hardwood floor.  He woke with a start and nearly jumped out of his skin when he saw the time.  Still in yesterday's clothes, Dean found that he had slept on the couch through the night.  Thankful that he didn’t have to be at work until the afternoon, Dean relaxed and let his heart rate return to normal.  His thumbs typed a quick note of apology to Castiel.  Guilt settled heavily in his stomach when he responded immediately.
Castiel’s throat jumped as he swallowed.  He stared back at Dean with matched intensity.  “You have me.”
When he woke, it took him a while to realize he was not dreaming.  He blinked and rubbed his eyes, went as far as to pinch himself just to prove it was real.  Dean was there, lying beside him.  Not human, not solid.  But there.  Staring back at him, wearing a gentle smile and fond expression.
He allowed Dean to lead him through the crowd and stepped in front of the gate confidently.  “Hey, Sammy, how’s it goin’?”
“And now?”  Dean followed up, wanting to learn more about the routine that supposedly tempered his depression for near a year.
Dean knew what it meant when Castiel said he wouldn't hurt him.  It was agreed that Dean would be subject to some pain, but never more than he could handle and never in a way that Dean said he didn't like.  That was the importance of the safe-word.  To make sure Dean always had a way to tell Castiel that they needed to stop.  “Kansas.” Dean announced his safe-word and tightened his hold around Castiel's waist.  He breathed in the cool, fresh scent of his skin and cologne.  “Ready.”  He pulled away from Castiel and averted his gaze.
He took a step forward and swayed into another stranger.
Ellen leaned her hip against the counter to listen, wiping her hands on a small towel.
There was no response from the gallery and, for the first time, Castiel wondered if he’d just imagined the whole thing.  It was possible that he was so lonely that he dreamed up a companion.  He stayed on the floor, sipping his beer until the candle burned down and the wick extinguished in a puddle of wax.
Dean followed the step by step instructions to the letter: placing one hand on his chest and the other on his belly, inhaling through his nose to the count of ten, taking the air into the bottom of his lungs, noticing the expansion of his diaphragm, releasing the air slowly as if filling a new balloon.
“I'm not sure what you're getting at, man.” Dean grabbed a few boxes of spiral macaroni and dumped them into the boiling water.  He measured out rice for the other pot and turned the burner to low.  When those were set, he went to work seasoning the vegetables.
Dean closes his eyes. Just for a second, he lets himself pretend Bobby is asking
!” The demon has his palms out, backing away. He's wearing Dee's ring.
“See? That wasn't so bad,” Sam says, quietly, sitting down on the couch.
Sam hasn't come close to bringing Dee back yet, even after four months. He has nightmares about Dee in Hell most nights. These demons are going to regret trying to mess with him.
“What?” Dean asks.
Dean comes back into the library with a tray of coffee mugs. “What are you practicing?” he asks.
They drive on in silence for a few minutes. Sam knows Dean wants him to drop it, but he can't help but say one more time, “You could've told me before.”
“Hey Bobby,” Sam says, smiling awkwardly like they're strangers.
Instinctively, Castiel takes off after him. It's like a dislocated joint snapping back into place. All at once, something previously impossible is as natural and exhilarating as ever before. The freedom of flight thrums through Castiel's bones.
“And of course, Sam's done the other tests,” Bobby continues. “So there's no point in repeating them.”
It's better than the alternative. Anything is better than that. And maybe, between the two of them, they can convince Dean not to do the summoning.
Sam sneaks out of the motel room after Dean falls asleep. The two of them drove all over town, looking for demons but came up empty. Ruby told him where she'd be waiting hours ago and Sam can only hope she's still there.
“Sammy?” Dee asks, and different voice or not, that note of concern is so familiar it hurts.
“He planned this,” Dean says out loud.
Clumsier than he should be, he salts the windowsill. His ears are ringing now. No, he's
Cas sits back on his heels, his hands bloody. “The wound is sealed. Anything more will hurt him more than it will help.”
Dean blinks. “What?” he asks. He steps back quickly. After a strong effort of will, Castiel does not close the new distance between them. Castiel's wings reach for Dean but that's allowable.
“About me,” Dean says. He meets Bobby's stare as levelly as he can, anger twisting inside him. “Why didn't you say anything?”
“Oh. Okay,” Sam says.
“I'm sorry,” Sam blurts out. He's gripping the blanket hard enough to whiten his knuckles.
Surprisingly, Jack doesn't smile back. “Why won't they?” he asks.
Dean hugs him back, confused.
Castiel is about to answer when Jack spreads his wings and cries, “Race you!” He flies away with a whump of displaced air.
“It's a trick,” Bobby says, still staring. “Has to be.”
Castiel steps closer. Dean leans back. “This is your problem, Dean. You have no faith,” Castiel says.
“Wait,” Sam says impulsively.
Sam stands up. “I should shower, I've been on the road a while.” He doesn't quite slam the bathroom door.
,” Dean says. His voice comes out harsher than he intended, and he clears his throat. “It isn't your fault.”
“He hurt you,” Cas says, his eyes blazing.
The gas station isn't hard to find. Sam sort of remembers seeing one on the way. That whole day is both sharp and faded in his memory.
His heart is hammering, adrenaline surging through his body. Dean stares at Cas.
Dean can't believe his ears. “What?”
Through the glassless windows, the pay phone he noticed on the way in catches his eye. Screw supplies, he needs to talk to Sam
Dad stiffens and blue light explodes from his eye sockets. He falls to the floor. As he drops, Castiel is revealed, staring into Dean's eyes, like he could see Dean all along. Maybe he could.
Dean's thoughts are whirling. “Can't he get out?”
Dean clears his throat. “So, I guess you won't be around much, now that you're all powered up and can fly again,” he says.
Dean's stomach drops at the thought of Sam doing something so dangerously stupid alone. He sits down on the other bed across from Sam and leans forward. “How did you even get away from her when I died? I thought she was ready to kill you.”
“How've you been holding up, son?” Bobby asks, his voice softer.
“Dee? Are you okay?”
Jack's eyes widen and he drops his book. “Damaged? Why didn't you say something?” He surges to his feet.
“I'm sure I can find it,” Sam says and he hangs up.
Castiel seems content to let Dean have as much time as he wants to try to process that. He stares into Dean's eyes from way too close. It's distracting. He's certainly attractive enough to be an angel. Anybody would be able to see that, it's not like
“She tried. She fired this burning white light at me and it didn't leave a scratch. Like I was immune,” Sam says.
He shakes himself. Nothing he can do about it now. Either they're watching him or they're not, no reason to change his behaviour at this point.
Sam tosses him the keys. “I assume you'll want to drive?”
“You knew?” Dean asks. Instantly, he wants to take the question back.
Dean's curiosity gets the better of him. “So, you suspected? How?”
brought me back in the first place!” the demon snaps, jabbing his finger at Sam.
“Do you want to?” Castiel asks, uncertain. “I could only show you their shadows and even that might be painful.”
She shakes her head. “Not possible. It would take too much power. No demon can swing that.”
Jack turns back to Castiel. He blinks, then smiles. “Oh, there they are. Do they feel okay?” he asks.
When he comes back out into the motel room, Sam's on the phone, whispering. He hangs up when he notices Dean.
Sam's eyes widen a little. “Huh. That makes sense, actually.”
-----
“Dee, are you telling me you're transgender?” Sam asks, gently.
“My wings were damaged falling from Heaven,” Castiel explains. Ingesting another angel's grace, twice, before being able to reclaim Castiel's own probably did not help.
-----
Rowena smiles and goes on. “Annoying but manageable. But the new wee God himself? Sounds like an overreach to me.”
“But you had hope, didn't you?” Rowena asks, almost sympathetically. “That's always a mistake.” She leans back. “I'd forgotten how comfortable these seats are.”
He doesn't deserve to just be handed what he always wanted.
“Hey Sammy,” the demon says, his smile softer.
The hug is as welcome as it is unexpected. Dean wraps his arms around his brother reflexively. They just hold on for a solid minute. Sam's still taller than Dean, go figure.
The defeat in her voice hurts. Dean feels anger surge through him. “And some things you can,” he says, firmly. “How do I get to the Empty?”
“It's fine. I know I'm your second choice,” Ruby says over her shoulder, reaching for the door handle.
Dean never would've done it. He would've let Dad kill him instead. “Yeah.” He stands up. “Need anything?”
Castiel gasps, reflexively rising from the chair. Light bulbs burst overhead. Running feet echo in the hall.
Jack's wings twitch as he looks anxiously from Dean to Castiel and back. Dean ignores Jack and strides away, stiff with anger.
Castiel knows the answer. “They aren't warding against nephilim. We're the ones who added the protections against angels in the first place, not the Men of Letters.”
Cas shakes his head. “Not just today. Before, I didn't understand. Family isn't—” He gestures like he can't find the words.
“Want me to talk to him first?” Sam asks.
“No!” The word feels like it's tearing out of Sam's throat.
Dean turns to see Baby sitting there, shiny and perfect. He grins, lost in admiration for a moment. As he approaches, he automatically checks the Impala over with his eyes. The tiny ripple in the paint above the front left tire is gone. It takes everything he has not to react. Dean spent ages trying to get rid of that blemish, even repainting the whole car multiple times.
“Here,” Ruby says, pointing through the windshield at the diner. “Not right this second, but they've infested the place during operating hours.”
She sighs. “I
Bobby pushes the cloth up, and Sam catches Dean's wince. “Nothing, my ass,” Bobby says.
Castiel shakes the water away and starts walking towards home.
He's going to kill Sam. He's really going to do it. Dean opens his mouth to tell Dad he'll have to kill Dean first.
“We never had time,” Dean says, finally.
Dean collapses onto the couch and puts his head in his hands. He can't think. It's all too much.
He picks up on the third ring. “Hello?”
There's a pause where Bobby stares at both of them. He's probably waiting for Sam to introduce Dean and Sam is definitely waiting for Dean to introduce himself. Dean clears his throat. Even after running the conversation through his head the whole way here, he's got nothing.
Bobby shoves away from the desk, crossing the short distance between them. “Come here,” he says and hugs Dean.
Dean has no idea what to say to that. Bobby holds on to his arms for a moment longer, then releases his grip. He retrieves his beer from the desk. “Sorry about that,” Bobby says, “I had to make sure.”
Oh, Sam knows all right. He still remembers the first time Dad told him to 'take care of your sister'. Sam isn't sure who was more shocked: him or Dee.
“Who?” Sam asks.
to tell you: you wouldn't go to Hell again. You're a good man.”
“What?” Dean asks, taking a step back.
Footsteps in the hall make Dean look up. “What's the verdict?” Bobby asks from the doorway.
“Do you remember what I went through even with birth control?” Dean asks. “Always some kind of problem like no family doctor, wrong brand, no address, we can't afford it. Anything to do with this would've been worse.”
Sam nods. “Okay, Dean.”
Sam passes him a duffle bag. “Here. I don't have any of those compression shirt things but we can go shopping later maybe.”
He can hardly hear Sam over the leftover ringing in his ears. “Come back now. We have to go.”
Sam remembers the long, drawn-out war teenage Dean waged against Dad to get on birth control in the first place. He sighs. “I just wish I could've
A tapping on the window behind him makes Sam turn quickly. But it's only the wind blowing a little gravel around.
He finds a dusty dirt road and picks a direction. Are his legs longer? He's definitely walking differently. Might have to learn how to fight all over again. He's looking forward to it.
Castiel can't think of a reply Dean won't mock just as much. When Dean leaves his bedroom a few seconds later, Castiel follows.
. But bile fills his throat and he has to swallow it down instead. He leans on the desk.
It happens while he's gathering supplies. The gas station TV flicks on to static, then the radio. Dean grabs a package of salt. His ears pop from the pressure change. Something is coming.
Before the fire. Sam takes a deep breath. “Why didn't you say?”
deserves? No, he wouldn't get to Heaven without some kind of intervention.
After a long moment, Sam announces, “I'm gonna be sick.”
“Did you... did you change my body?” Dean asks, a little breathless, eyes wide.
Dean shakes his head and leans against the wall. “Not over yet,” he says.
“Hey, don't worry about it. It's fine now,” Dean says.
“What did you say it was? Castiel?” Dean asks. “I've never heard of it.”
“Wow,” Dean says, without meaning to. It's a lot to wrap his head around.
Dad stands over him. “Pathetic,” he spits.
Bobby wraps his arms around Sam in a fierce hug. “It's good to see you,” he says, his voice muffled.
Sam stops automatically, breathing hard. “Why would you even try this?” he snarls. “What kind of idiot do you think I am, you stupid demon!”
“You still have no faith,” Cas sighs, his hands relaxing. He tilts his head suddenly, like he hears something.
“No, not really. But I think whatever did it is looking for me.” Dean explains about the ringing sound and broken glass in the hotel room. Sam only saw the smashed window from outside. They left pretty fast.
“Back to the bunker,” Castiel says, firmly. “Sam and Dean will be worried about you.”
“I'll tell you when you get here,” Dean says and hangs up. Blood drips into his eyes. He has a few tiny cuts from the mirror glass but can't feel anything major.
and there's an ant investigating his left boot. Even his imagination isn't this detailed.
Dean leads Castiel into his own bedroom and shuts the door. “What the hell were you thinking?” he demands.
Oh. The bunker's wards must've blocked Castiel from returning to the library. They are set to keep angels out, after all. And Castiel has been entering only though the front door all these years.
“What the hell is going on?” he hears himself ask, his voice hoarse and satisfyingly deep.
Castiel gives in. There will be consequences for this. Dean deserves the truth. “I heard your prayer.”
Dean takes a deep breath. He looks around the room, everywhere but at Cas. Ruby's knife catches his eye. It's halfway under the couch, where it must've slid after Dad dropped it.
“I don't need them anymore.” He didn't even think Sam knew about his binder. Dean always tried to hide it.
He pokes his head out of the bathroom. “Sam? Can I get some clothes?”
“Who?”
body. Maybe Sam didn't just make a demon deal.
Castiel has been surviving on crumbs of affection for so long but that look in Dean's eyes... maybe a place at the table isn't impossible after all.
Sam's eyes fly open. He gasps, half-sitting up. Dean grabs his brother's shoulders, ignoring the spike of pain from his half-healed arm. “Hey, you're okay. Cas is healing you.”
Sam stares at him. “What? You're crazy.” What if Ruby misheard the name or the demons she spied on were talking about something else?
Dean exhales forcefully. “It was you then, not God or anything. This was just
Castiel nods but Sam isn't finished. “Speaking of flying, I think I'm the only one here who's never seen your wings.”
Dean groans. “No, not again! You said you were done with that crap.”
Dad looks like he's about to speak. Instead, he brings the shotgun around and hits out at Dean. Dean's arms go up to ward it off. The blow lands on his right forearm. There's a cracking sound when it connects. Dean cries out. The pain is like lightning. He falls to his knees, his legs suddenly unable to hold him up.
“Only when they come back from the dead,” Bobby says, dryly.
Sam shakes his head. “We could have! There's—”
Sam stares at it in his own bloody palm. Dean wants to take the thing away, to throw it across the room, but he can't move.
“Cas is going to teach me how to show Sam my wings,” Jack explains.
Robert Singer attacks with an iron rod. Castiel catches it easily and send him to sleep with a touch on his forehead.
Rowena delicately places two fingers on her temple like she's getting a headache. “Dean Winchester, you have an extremely powerful soul. The Empty is stretched thin enough as it is. Your arrival would break the stalemate.” She sighs. “Especially since protecting you will inspire both your child and your lover to greater heights of power, as cliche as that sounds.”
Dean opens his mouth to say it
“Yeah, okay. Uh, tell me more about it?” Sam asks.
All of his euphoria drains away. The handprint is burned into his skin. It's red and raised to the touch, like a brand. Something did this to him. His new body isn't a gift. Dean needs to remember that.
having this conversation over the phone.
, dies.
Dean moves closer, not longer as confrontational. This is good progress. They will become allies. “Wait. Did anyone tell you to do this for me?”
“Dee?” Sam asks. He can't believe it. Shouldn't believe it.
“I'm fine.” Castiel spreads arms and wings to demonstrate, then begins descending the stairs. “I believe I was blocked by the bunker's wards on the way back.”
He makes himself pull his sleeve back down. He doesn't have time to think about this now. He has to find Sam.
“On your left shoulder,” Sam says, reaching out. “Let me see.”
“Dee? How?”
“Maybe we'll practice that first,” Castiel says quickly. Since a mistake would permanently blind Sam.
Dean cautiously steps forward, scanning the half-lit library for threats. “What the hell happened? I heard that angel noise.”
“Uh, cheers,” Sam says, awkwardly, and takes a gulp of his beer.
“You scared me half to death!” Dean shouts. “I wake up to that horrible angel noise, which
“Demons, plural? By yourself?” Dean asks.
Now it's Dean's turn to frown. “Explain what?”
his body. And there's no way Dean will let that happen.
Dean smiles. “Well, that's how I'm working it,” he says, like that settles the issue. “I'm starving, let's hit a drive-thru on the way in.”
“Same thing at the gas station, soon after I popped up,” Dean says.
Dean grits his teeth. “Deanna Winchester.”
When Dean calls again, Bobby answers with “Who
Bobby, why would he need anyone else? A community of people like him is a dream Dean's never considered realistically.
“We have work for you.”
“Only you should hear what I have to tell you,” Castiel says to Dean.
Cas turns. His expression doesn't change.
Sam sighs. “Then do you at least know where they are?”
“Where did you take him?” Dean asks, his voice a little shaky.
“What?” Sam asks.
“I heard a name: Castiel. It could be connected.” Sam hopes Ruby's information is good.
Dean sighs. It's a sore spot for both of them but he needs to keep Sam safe. Safe definitely does not include being psychic.
Dad steps forward. Dean instinctively leans back against the desk. Nowhere he can go that won't leave Dad an opening to get around Dean to where Sam is hiding. Dean can't hear him gasping in pain anymore.
“I'm not! I just—” Sam stops himself from saying he knows what it's like not to fit in. There are still some things he can't say to Dean, even with this new openness. “I missed you,” he says instead.
The apartment was quiet but for the sound of their breath and as Castiel's hand came to rest on his head, and Dean had never felt more at home in this place.
Castiel tasted himself on Dean’s lips and groaned with another spike of arousal.  “So fucking good to me.”  Ready to reciprocate, Castiel knelt on the cushion and held Dean’s bare hips in his hands.  He had just wrapped his hand around Dean’s cock when his phone went off.  It would be Michael calling anyway, no harm in letting him leave another voicemail.
Another man would have gotten defensive, but Dean had a long conversation with Garth as they mindlessly turned out one oil change after another.  Garth knew a hell of a lot more about depression than Dean thought, which prepared him for when Cas made comments like that.
Cas continued to knead the meat of Dean's shoulder, only releasing it to periodically caress Dean's throat and jaw.
“OK.”
Castiel had to close his eyes to clear his sinful thoughts.
“OK.”  Castiel settled back in the seat, listening to the lyrics of Dean’s supposedly favorite song.  He told himself Dean wasn’t avoiding the question.  He had already mentioned his affinity for Led Zeppelin, so it actually made sense that his favorite song would be played by the same band.
Dean tugged him back toward the living room, wanting to thank his boyfriend with proper enthusiasm.  “Permission to resume making out until that's cooled enough for eating?”
“Come inside, Baby.  Let me take care of you tonight.”  Dean’s hold on Cas was solid, but he was only testing the waters.  If Cas said ‘no,’ said he wasn’t interested in giving Dean control, Dean would submit to him in whatever way he needed.
Dean moved faster.  He wanted to show Castiel that he was good at this, wanted this and more.  He wanted Castiel to come and beg for
Dean sat in the Impala, drumming gently against the steering wheel while he waited for Zachariah to call him back.  The guy had said he would be working from home all morning, but when Dean showed up at 7AM, right on time, the man was impossible to reach.  After ringing the doorbell and knocking multiple times, Dean left a voice-mail on the only phone number he was given.  He was scheduled for a three hour session and felt guilty informing the man that the clock was running even as he failed to make use of it.  When his waiting started to cut into the second hour, Dean decided to give Sam a call and put his time to better use.
“I'll work on the contract today, while you are at work.  We can take another look at it whenever you are ready.”  Castiel kissed his hand again before returning his attention to his breakfast.
Seeing Dean's expression harden, Castiel tilted his head.  “What's the matter?”  He wiped his hand with a napkin and set it back on the counter.
“No, I… When you asked me about the festival…”  Castiel licked at the corner of his mouth tasting ketchup.
Castiel clenched his jaw and dropped his gaze.  He wasn’t used to being scolded by anyone, not when he was his biggest critic, not when he was the one to set the rules. It felt strange to succumb under Dean’s control, but it wasn’t awful.  Dean didn’t force him into anything and his correction came with concern rather than disapproval.
“Hmm.”
Regardless Castiel told him there was no need to rush, Dean was showered and 'dressed' in record time.  He slipped out of the bathroom wearing boxers and a towel, found Castiel crouched by the couch, setting out a pair of old tennis shoes presumably for Dean to destroy.
With gentle movements, Dean rolled Cas onto his back and straddled his leg.  His eyes were hooded with sleep, but they shone as he gazed into the blue eyes beneath him.   Warmth bloomed in his chest as he brought his lips down to Castiel’s cheek.  He trailed kisses over his neck, laughing quietly as Castiel moaned.  If Dean could only hear one sound for the rest of his life, he wouldn’t choose Zep, ACDC, or the Stones.  He would choose Castiel’s voice.
Dean turned his back to them, shielding the view of his hands as he traded phones with Gabriel.  “Can you add Michael's number, too?”  He asked while punching his contact information into Gabriel's cell.
“I guess the undead can be quite motivating.  I think there’s an app for that.”
“Go on.”
Dean pushed himself up to sit on the counter.  “I spoke to Sam,” he said seriously, “and he made me see what a jackass I was for doing what I thought you would like for our date instead of using the information I actually know about you to create a night that you would enjoy.”
Dean and Cas find a new routine that seems to help.
With a smirk, Dean winked.  “I'm gonna find one you like, and it's gonna stick.”  Dean made coming up with a term of endearment sound like a threat.
Dean's scowl formed deep lines in his forehead as he placed their dinner in front of Castiel.  He knew that Cas had something against his table manners, but Dean had never had to worry about impressing anyone.  Now he yearned for Castiel's approval but got ridiculed instead.
Dean looked between them, confused. “Ask me what?”  His attention had been on Castiel but he didn't think he'd missed anything important.
How is it that you are such a distraction when you are not even here?
“I can give you five minutes.”
Chapter 7
Castiel huffed and pulled his knees to his chest.  He looked so young, so small.  Dean ran his fingers through Cas's tousled hair a moment before he turned away.
Hooking his chin over Castiel's shoulder, Gabriel narrowed his eyes at the stranger.  “Pleasure's mine, I'm sure.”
“I thought they saved virgins,”  Dean said with a frown.
“No need,” he said with a smile, pulling out a pair of tickets.  He tapped them against Castiel’s nose and hooked an arm around his shoulders.  “Come on, let’s cut in.”
“You know, Dean, it is said that flattery will get you everywhere.”  Castiel chose the foil wrapped sandwich.  “You could try it sometime.”
Castiel could swear that he saw Sam wink at him.  He tucked in a little closer into Dean’s side.
Castiel arrived while Dean was flipping burgers on the deck.  He slipped an arm around his boyfriend’s waist and took a long drink from Dean’s beer.  They finished off the bottle before greeting each other with an ale flavored kiss.
Cas was asking permission to gag him, but Dean's eyes dropped to his Dom's stiff cock hungrily.
Dean upended his bad on the carpet and found a pair of metal rings that would serve his purpose.  Most of his rope collection was already in small piles on the bed, so Dean only needed to grab the rings and a blind fold.
Finally, they made it to check out and escaped the madness of wholesale back-to-school shoppers.  Dean grumbled about spending nearly one-thousand dollars on one trip to a grocery store, but still fought with Castiel when he offered to pay for his share.
Castiel sat at the counter and watched.  “But you would prefer to kneel.”
Dean thought the call was dropped until he heard Michael's voice again.
Pulling his consciousness away from the pain, his senses came to life.  Dean could zone in on the feel of Castiel's steady fingers on his hip.
“Why did you go?  If you knew there would be those triggers?”  His hand was moving again, absently scratching behind Dean’s ear.  He didn’t notice until Dean spoke up about it.
Laying the guy on the wooden bench, head in his lap, Castiel dragged ice cubes over his face and neck.  He moistened the stranger’s chapped lips, remembering a time when his sister had done something similar during the flu as a child.  Dehydration was dangerous.
, Dean stopped himself.  He knew better than that.
He ghosted his fingertips over Dean’s shoulder and down his arm.  “I will do with your body as I please.”  When Castiel’s fingers reached Dean’s wrist again, they clamped around the joint and held it down.  Their hands pressed into Dean's lower back as Castiel leaned over his body.  He held his lips against the shell of Dean’s ear.  A shiver coursed through the man beneath him as he whispered, “And right now, it pleases me to give you this massage.”
Castiel froze when he saw what Dean was getting ready to do.  Maybe to someone else, to Dean, this seemed like a perfectly acceptable moment to have their first kiss.  Cas, on the other hand, couldn't shake the feeling of wrong.  He wasn't ready for this next step.  He wasn't ready to have Dean make this move for both of them.
“Do or don't do whatever you want, Master.  You're the Dom; or don't you remember?”  His chest burned as he held back further remark and he laughed once more.
But what about the spirit’s touch?  The watchful company he kept through the night?   Perhaps this spirit felt as lonely as Castiel had.
Dean whimpered, his eyes watching the hand.  Castiel started slowly, at first only brushing the short hairs over his ear with the tips of his fingers.  Dean's trust in him grew exponentially after that.  He turned into Castiel's hand, forcing it to smooth the hair over his head and rubbing his cheeks against Castiel's palm.   Castiel doted him with caresses and light scratches behind his ears.  With each touch, Dean drew himself closer until he was practically in Castiel's lap.  Castiel drew the trench coat over Dean's bare shoulders and continued to reassure him with words of comfort.
“It's different things,” Dean started to explain.  “Just being held in place... helps.  Makes it easier for me to let go, let someone else take over...  It's fun too, to struggle against the ties.  And some of the patterns can feel like you've got your Dom's hands all over you.  And you know how much I like your hands on me.”
Dean raised an eyebrow and wondered if Castiel might change clothes in front of him.  He himself was already naked, so maybe Castiel did not see nudity as something to be ashamed of.
Castiel bit his tongue as he saw Dean shrinking before him.  He heard the way he had snapped at Dean over something as trivial as a TV show and he felt terrible about it.  Dean was at least trying to make the best of their awkward situation, Castiel could put up an effort as well.
Castiel wiggled a bit, struggling against the ties. “Good boy. Suck me good and hard, Dean. And when I tell you to stop – stop.”
“You’re OK, babe.  Can you tell me what happened?”
Sitting on the edge of the bed, Dean looked down at him with adoration in his eyes.  He laced their fingers together.
“Good.”  Dean didn’t open up to Garth as much, now that he was speaking to Sam everyday.  Still, the guy was good people and Dean trusted him.  He had been open and informative when Cas had first took a turn toward depression, Dean figured he owed him an honest update.  So when Garth asked about Castiel, he answered truthfully.  “He’s good.  Real good.  Rough days, but even with the craziness at work, he’s been alright.”
“Why?”  Gabriel sniffed at it – nothing but water, lemon, and honey.  “Smells like vomit.”
Dean heard the sound of keys and glanced over Zachariah’s shoulder to see Castiel testing the door.
Dean caressed Castiel’s face and started again.  “I’ll teach you to work with the rope, but I’d prefer if I was the only one who tied you.”  Dean lifted Cas’s bruised wrist to his chest and held it over his breastplate.  “This can never happen again,” his voice wavered and he cleared his throat.  “I don’t want you to do this on your own.”
Dean's voice came muffled by the way his cheek pressed into his arm, “Apple's my favorite.”
Cas was being so obedient and was much more in control of his breathing and body now that he was lying down and blindfolded.  Dean told himself he needed to ask Castiel what helped him most during the session so that he could use it again.
in the way Dean's stomach jumped as he stared into Castiel's blue eyes, but the feeling passed as Castiel's hands sneaked under his shirt and warmed his lower back.
Castiel was safe and he was going to be OK.  Dean was sure of it.  He had faith in Cas and already thought there was progress being made.  If they didn't let it get too far, if they caught it early, Dean felt there was no reason for Castiel's mood to slide down any further.
Warnings at the end.
Castiel combed through the verbiage and eliminated all talk of sexual acts.  Castiel resigned himself to amending the contract if there was such a time where a sexual relationship developed.  He also added a provision for “downtime,” a meeting they would conduct together twice per week where Dean could review the relationship and express his opinion without the fear of retaliation or penalty.  It would be a time of discovery for both of them where they could discuss areas of their relationship that needed improvement.  Castiel understood that downtime could be invaluable in even the most experienced D/s relationship.  The contract was viable for one month, during which time they would agree to the terms of their trial/training period.  Castiel poured over the document for hours until he was satisfied that Dean would approve.
“Yeah.  Thanks.”  Dean's mouth twisted as he tried to find the right words.  He hoped that Castiel knew that the gratitude he expressed was for more than the night's company and conversation.  Dean needed to thank Castiel for giving a shit, for listening, for caring enough to approach the stage on Saturday.  “Well, have a good night.”
It was understood that Dean would continue to interact with Castiel as a submissive during downtime.  While he would not be punished for anything he said, he should conduct himself with respect to his Dom.  “Do you have something specific on your mind?”
Reaching out with his toes, Castiel poked Dean's thigh.  Dean turned to him with a sad smile, neither one able to forget the scene from the kitchen.
Unknown Caller: Missed you. Again.
Michael's bored question cut like a knife.
“Do I really have to say it?”  His voice was muffed by the back cushion.  “Your hands on me like this, you know it's turning me on, right?”
Before heading to the garage, Dean dropped off a bagged lunch for Cas – grilled cheese, cole slaw, and a pickle from Ambrosia.  There was also a pair of dark chocolate truffles, courtesy of something Gabriel called the “FKC”.
Dean and Castiel layered up for their short trek across town.  The night was starting to get dark and they stayed close to each other.  Dean took every opportunity to brush his hand against Castiel’s as they walked.  He was never denied the contact, but Cas didn’t seem to pick up on the cue that he wanted more.
Dean took the pen with a word of thanks.  Castiel really did seem to value his input in their relationship.  The realization eased any lingering doubts about giving control over to the man.  After all, Castiel was the one who had spent most of the day writing a contract that was essentially an outline for how he would care for him.  Dean scribbled in the margins, making the appropriate edits.  “If we change our dating days to Monday – Friday," he suggested, “we could spend all weekend together as Dom and sub.”
Warning: Casual conversation about shibari.
Castiel's eyes fluttered closed and another gravelly moan escaped his throat.
“Good boy. Use it to make me come without touching my dick.”
Stepping into the bar brought up a mix of emotion.  There was anger at the club managers, shame in himself for coming back, relief at returning to routine, and an overwhelming concern for his sub.  And he really should stop referring to the man as his now that he intends to... what?  What, exactly, did he hope that another visit would accomplish?  Castiel sat down on the stool at the end of the bar top and sank his face into his hands.
Once they were alone, Dean took Castiel's face in his hands.  He knew they would only have a brief moment alone and he stared into the clarity of Castiel's blue eyes.  There was sadness there, unhidden, and Dean's heart sank.  He wished he knew what to say or do to ease the pain of whatever was bothering him.  Dean knew that there were options, should Castiel truly want a family of his own one day: foster, adoption, surrogates.  But he doubted how comforting a reminder of that would be.
It wasn’t that he didn’t want to accept the proposal.  Dean was it for him, Cas was sure of that.  But they had only really gotten to know each other in the past month!
Dean lit up as he talked about his partner.  He was so proud of him for the way he was handling his work situation and Dean couldn’t be happier to see the way Cas cared for his niece.  Castiel was understanding with Dean’s odd work hours and supportive of Dean’s exploration into Dominance.  Dean had once thought that Castiel wouldn’t be willing to submit and he felt honored, in a way, that his partner would trust him enough to show his vulnerability.  He spoke with Garth in vague descriptions of their relationship, but with his head and hands in the engine, Dean didn’t feel as self-conscious as usual.
Author's Note:  I am delighted at the positive response this story has gotten.  Thank you for sticking with me.
The creak of the bathroom door startled Dean and he noticed he hadn't moved from his spot near the couch.  He was not where he promised to be.
Castiel placed a kiss to Dean's hair and was rewarded by the sound of a low rumble from deep in Dean's chest.  The purr vibrated between them, tickling and soothing all at once.  Castiel pulled Dean closer and his fingers curled around the short hairs behind Dean's ear.  He couldn't resist kissing him again.
When it seemed like Dean had read his fill, Castiel touched his hand.  Dean drew his eyes away from the contract.  “I was reading a few articles online about what a BDSM relationship is supposed to be.  Honesty is a big part of that.  So, I want to tell you upfront that I don't think I'm ready to sign a contract.”  Dean took a deep breath and opened his mouth to speak, but no words came.
“Yeah.”
Castiel did not know what to say without overstepping a boundary and offending Dean.  It was clear that Dean had no intention of spilling his guts to a stranger.  Even so, Castiel wanted to offer a solution, even a job.  Though the office was crazy with the addition of two new doctors, the budget didn't leave room for a new staff member.  Under different circumstances, he thought he would hire Dean as his own submissive.  He feared that job offer wouldn't go over well.  Beyond that, Castiel wanted to comfort his companion.  He wanted to tell Dean that it would all work out, that he'd be OK.  But Castiel had no guarantees and he refused to lie to this man.
“Are you ready?”  Dean took the rings in his hand and tapped Cas’s wrists.  “Sit up.”
Gabriel giggled a little and Dean looked at him like he had grown another head.
When Dean cut the engine, he noticed Castiel had made no move to exit.
Castiel's hand held him gently at his cheek and there was a tension in his fingers, an energy that Dean hadn't felt before.  He breathed and waited and watched.  Castiel's eyes bore into him and Dean inflated with the attention.  Castiel's blunt fingernails pressed into his jaw as he held him in place.  “Good boy.”
He didn’t sell much that morning, but the real crowds had started in around lunchtime.  Everyone looked for something to eat as they perused through the market.  It seemed like most tables were drawing substantial attention.  But Castiel’s remained in quiet order.  He busied himself shifting the signs and rearranging jars so that the labels were faced front.  It was the kind of mindless work that didn’t take much effort and allowed him to drift off in his thoughts.
Dean’s fingers smeared through the blood, dragged it around into the shape of a sigil that felt like a burning brand of fire across Cas’ skin once it was complete. He screamed and Dean uttered soothing words into his ear. More blood trickled down over the drawn lines but it didn’t matter, it was still there beneath the trails of liquid. Cas peered blearily down at his chest as the initial burst of heat died down to an irritating tingle.
“Dean! What do you mean occupied? What have you done with him?”
“Don’t take it too personally,” Dean said, getting sloppy in his movements. He seemed so distracted by Cas’ wings, carding his fingers through them and stroking down them to delicate tips, only to flick them in a way that sent Cas into irregular spasms as they shifted, vibration traveling down the shafts right through to to follicle. He’d never felt them so physically and coupled with Dean’s touch it started an awful aching that made Cas undulate, trying to escape what was part of him.
Dean hovered over him, obscuring the hallucination of Sam and Cas sighed. Dean’s hands traced the outline of his wings in the air. “I know you don’t understand,” he started.
Dean leaned over him, dropped his forehead between Cas’ shoulder blades. “Not
He’d broken his promise to Sam to stay away while Dean was hunted down and brought back to the bunker to be cured, and the least he could do was obey one Winchester who gave him orders today. He inclined his head with a nod. “For you, anything.”
“But you like it?”
He felt abandoned, left out in the cold even with Dean pressed so close. He could feel heaven pulling away from him further, now he was sullied, now his wings had emerged and grounded him to the earth.
He wasn’t sure what Dean was saying, there were words and sounds but all he could focus on was the touch. The touch that felt like dirt on his essence, smearing dust across the planes of once holy relics. Sullied now, being pulled away from him in new ways.
“Dean…”
Dean could see nothing besides the torn asunder bloody marks of his own body, but he heard Chuck’s approach. Sneakers squeaking on the white floor, still like the nervous little nerd Dean had first known him to be. Chuck’s hand gripped his chin and lifted it, forced Dean to look him in the eye.
and there was no more pain, only intense pleasure. The bindings were broken and though he was distantly aware that it never used to feel like binding, but like safety, the relief was overpowering. He went limp, exhaustion dragging down his limbs until he could barely twitch.
“Sam, this is about Sam,” he mumbled
It wasn’t hard for Dean to get Cas in his car; with his wrists still tied, nearly boneless from the high of his orgasm, and with the encroaching pain that was starting to border on too much without the pleasure to soften it.
Cas wanted to scream but only a high whistle left his vocal chords. His wings flared out, spread like delicate fingers until they were wider than the span of the bed. He couldn’t control them, they were reacting and changing to the stimuli. They were finding a new anchor point, a thing to tether themselves too on the physical plane.
Not that that stopped anything. It never had. It was why Cas spent so much time dizzy with substance and lost in a fog; to forget the deeds he had been too weak to stop, to will away the memories of the things and people he hadn’t been able to save.
and where better than with me.”
Maybe Dean was okay with that though, he never expected to save Sam completely, not any more. And maybe trapping his brother to earth, to be fought and beaten into submission on human terms, was the closest he knew he was going to get to bringing Sam to heel. To get to see his face again, and to know that Sam’s body wouldn’t be used to bring more destruction to the planet.
The fluid leaking from his ass came into focus second, slipping past his ripped clothes and going tacky beneath him and the seat. Disgusting, awful, and... exactly what he wanted. As he moved to get away, it
Dean scoffed. “Turn around, then. Hands behind your back.”
“What was that, I barely heard you. Actually—I want
You have
“Let me,” Cas said, placing his hand over Dean’s heart.
Just as they had the day before, and the day before that, and for a hundred—a thousand—days before that.
The light glowing from the west wall flickered brighter for a second before it winked out and reappeared on the east instead. He was lost in fiery agony, a fish on a hook on a line in an endless burning sea. And then the wounds were gone, and the east wall lit, bright and ready for a new day.
“But you’re hurt?”
“Don’t say that!” Cas hissed. “You don’t believe that, I don’t believe that.” He turned, pulled himself free to curl up with his knees to his chest.
Dean moved lightning fast, hefted Cas up and divested him of his pants in one smooth move. Cas kicked his ankles, drew his legs together but a quick sharp bite at his nipple made him gasp and loosen and Dean drew the pants over his feet to drop onto the floor with a soft
Comments and kudos are, as always, a writer's bread and butter, and feeding is always appreciated <3
“You don’t know what you've done,” Cas said. The words felt flat, barely worth saying at all.
“S’just… what we need. How we gotta be. Can’t do this without ya.”
It was messy; as skilled as Dean was the drinking made him too rough and too intense. Cas kissed back because he knew how to do this. The end of the world had taught him many things and one of them was how to give in to the whims of his body, and the whims of others, too. He did it now, just hoping it would be enough to get Dean to stop.
Cas looked into Dean’s eyes, swallowed. He didn’t want to lie. He couldn’t lie, not with his body parading the truth directly under Dean’s nose. He nodded. Dean abandoned the pool cue, dropped it to the floor with a clatter and pushed himself into Cas’s space.
He could withstand torture, but the monotony was wearing. Tunes kept getting lost from his head, falling out with each drop of spilled blood, until all he could manage were broken hums and half-snatches of melodies, mixed with wheezing gurgles from his throat.
“Is it secure here, can we talk without being overheard?” Cas asked, as Dean felt his weight move and settle, his clothes brushing Dean’s bare flesh.
“Was someone screaming? I heard, or I thought I heard, enochian.”
. “Still hard, still wanting. I wonder what it would take to make you soft?”
Dean dropped the phone and turned the key in the ignition, the engine flared to life below him and Cas rattled a moan, still with Dean’s arm twisted around and hand clamped over his airway.
“What was that angel? Use your words.” Dean pulled his head back to look him in the eyes.
Dean had enacted the spell but it hadn’t been long since it was cast, maybe there was still time for someone else to bond with him too, to make his connection with Dean less all encompassing. Cas thought about stumbling out to beg for someone else at camp to fuck him, to touch his wings and call him theirs. To love him. The idea was laughable. Humiliating.
“That’s what I mean, he saw the wings of the angel he was destined to be closest to and it’s all kinds of messed up. I’m closest to you and you’ve never even wanted to, but I can fix it. I can take the lead when you won’t.”
“You don’t know that!”
“I could undress!”
“It’ll take time, you’ve been through a lot,” Sam assured him.
back here.”
“You could have asked.”
“W-Wait!” Cas cried out, his voice cracked.
Dean let him breathe again and he sucked in air with a whine. His head dipped backwards and Dean’s grip followed. He felt warm all over, and Sam’s voice was helping.
“Can’t regret how I feel Cas. Won’t. Too much of my life I’ve… I've held back and repressed and now—now I just can’t anymore. Kinda freeing, y’know?”
“No!” Cas fought, he fought with all he had, struggled and tried to surge away but he felt caught on Dean’s dick, and trapped in Dean’s arms. Dean was utterly focused on keeping Cas close. His thrashing got him nowhere except a prick to his skin, over his heart. Just where Cas was most terrified of.
Dean hauled him off his knees and dragged him backwards until Cas’s back slammed into the wall. He groaned again, dropped his head to Dean’s shoulder and shook. His breathing was loud and ragged.
Dean leaned in and planted a kiss on his forehead, before finally letting him breathe. He flashed Cas’s cellphone in his other hand.
He hugged Sam a lot in between, and wolfed down food, and revelled in the normalcy of simply being clothed. And then he went back to bed, and slipped into sleep in a repeating pattern that he thought would worry them all more than it seemed to.
Dean looked up, lifted his hand to trace the lines of Cas’ jaw, looking tenderly at him.
The man left and Cas turned his head, wishing he didn’t have to hear the door click closed, taking safety with it. A flicker caught his attention. He blinked, surprised as Sam appeared as if out of nowhere. He twitched his fingers, hoping to beckon him. He knew it wasn’t real, just his mind slipping and sliding down the tracks of pain and confusion and the drugs trying to blind him with some new distraction.
“Dean makes them for us,” Sam murmured behind him. “But he is usually right.”
He opened one eye, then the other, and focused on the care on Cas’s face, ignoring the flush on his high cheekbones.
Not to get ahead of myself or anything but having you here is like a little gift to myself, an unexpected twist. But a good one! I’ll have to think on how to make best use of it.”
He pulled back and struck Cas again, too many times in quick succession for Cas to keep count. The pain spread into what felt like one giant bruise. He tried to keep his reactions to himself but let slip an uncontrollable noise or two. Sounds that seemed to drive Dean wild, eyes alight and grin broadening. Cas was on his knees, looking up at the once-man, now-demon who used to be his friend. Even like this, he would trust Dean with his life; he would let Dean
Dean’s arousal was obvious, in the heat of his touch and the fervour of his actions. In the hot hard length of his cock and the sweat littering his skin. Cas was cold and still as stone and not aroused at all.
“You always been like this, Angel? Or did turning human mess you up inside more than I realised?”
Dean grinned — evil and sparkling with treachery, but he caught Cas’s lip between his teeth and bit down until Cas tasted blood. It tipped Cas over the edge and he came with a shout that was half smothered by lips and tongue and teeth. He came with the taste of his own blood in his mouth, and Dean’s deep dark chuckle ringing in his ears.
“Until then Dean and I have been keeping ourselves occupied haven’t we?”
His breath caught when Chuck materialised through the wall. His fears came back tenfold, magnified a thousand ways, with a hundred worries. What if Cas was ripped away now? What if Chuck added demands on Cas’s presence, now that he was here? The chance for Sam to pull them out before things got worse, came, and passed, and was left in the dust—they’d pay for the error in blood.
Cas had nothing to say.
“And you did it anyway.”
“Ready to start a new day, Dean?”
Cas.”
“I’ll do anything you ask, Dean. I always would have.”
“Alright, I… Yeah I can do that.”
He was too
“I like driving my dates home at the end of the night.” Dean shrugged. “Makes me feel like I treated them real special.”
“Dean, I said no.”
“You’re just a tool to him, I wish you’d seen it earlier,” Sam said.
Dean didn’t speak again, but rammed home like the end of the world was coming up behind them and he had to finish before it got there. He wrapped an arm around Cas’s neck, hauled him up and fucked and fucked until hot, wet come filled Cas’s ass.
“You recognise that? All at the thought of you suffering just the way he knows you like to.”
Dean choked him again and his feet scrabbled uselessly in the footwell, ass squeaking on the seat as he couldn’t breathe and couldn’t breathe and
“Of course angelcake, seeing you hurting, making all those little noises, it turns me on like nothing I’ve ever felt. Being the
“You weren’t looking.” Cas gasped as Dean sped up.
He shifted on the floor, waiting for the healing that would burn across his skin next. That would close the wounds and leave him whole. Ready to start all over again.
“I choose what goes in my body, not you, not you, not you.” Cas spat. “Get. Out.”
Lube slick sounds followed, flesh on flesh and bottle top closing; hands rubbing over skin and then surprise cool liquid being pushed inside him. Not enough, probably, but he didn’t get a say. Knew he wouldn’t really want one, anyway.
“I absolutely will not--”
With a hand on the small of his back, Cas was held down under a bruising grip. The marks and bruises from his earlier encounter with the pool cue sparked and complained and he ignored them as the blade was lifted. He felt it trail around the backs of his thighs, felt the tip poke him on the flesh of his ass.
“Dean, stop.”
“Why,” Cas sucked in air through his mouth, and tried to get his body under control, violently shivering instead. “Why are we in the car Dean?”
When Dean’s hands roved lower, left his face and neck and slipped under the waistband of his pants he knew he was mistaken. Dean’s hands were warm, pressed just the right amount onto his skin to make him want to arch into the touch, but that was just physiological. He didn’t
Cas peered out the window at the mid afternoon sun, and gave Dean a pointed look. “Long time until nightfall.”
The point of the blade, sharp and stinging, pierced the jut of his shoulder blades. He screamed. As it moved in the patterns of the sigils it cut deeper than skin, it flayed him to the depths of his being, pushed through the barriers of flesh and matter into the ether where his wings were hidden. The cuts broke the divide and his wings strained against what suddenly felt like confinement, instead of protection.
and Cas swallowed a sob as come trickled from his ass and stained the sheets.
“So Castiel, I see Dean’s made you right at home.”
hurt Dean.
If this was what Dean would do while enjoying himself, Cas didn’t dare make Dean angry. Was this what he was here for, just a warm body, a punching bag, a way to satisfy the men of the world when he had nothing else of worth left to give? Is this what staying with, and saving Dean, meant?
“It’s been so long, Cas, don’t you want to?”
So when the East wall broke open, and black nothing seeped in, and a man in a tan trench coat stepped out, Dean’s mind exploded into overload and he groaned. If he could have covered his eyes and ears he would have, but he’d been strung up by the hook (always the damn hook, always held in place in the most humiliating way) with the chain looped somewhere up over his head and the other end attached to the cuffs on his wrists. Jerking his arms down forced the hook to delve deeper into his ass.
There was room in all of their lives for more. He’d submit to anything, if Dean would only ask.
where Dean was headed. His head pounded in a way that told him the sleep he’d had wasn’t enough, his body ached, and he felt weak. Weak with resolve, and weak physically too.
Cas sang like a little bird soon enough. Once Dean began a wordless yelling, Cas begged with whatever words Chuck demanded of him. Dean was grateful, briefly. Until Chuck’s work began. Sat astride Cas, his ass completely full, Dean was slowly, methodically, torn to shreds.
He tried to shove Dean off but Dean only held on harder, his grip clasped tightly around Cas’ wrists, tighter than Cas seemed able to grapple back.
“What?”
“Yeah,” the man says. “So, you wanna try holy water, silver, throw some salt at me, maybe?”
Rowena looks away. “Some things you can't fix,” she says.
Dean sets the tray down on the table, rattling the mugs a little. “Oh,” is all he says but he stares at Castiel like he's hungry for something.
“Yes. Thank you,” Castiel says.
“What? No, I didn't!” Sam is confused enough to look into the demon's eyes for the first time. They're Dee's eyes. But that's impossible.
Castiel hugs back and gently corrects him. “I should have asked you to.” It feels good to hug with wings as well as with arms. Castiel has never managed it before.
Sam's clothes are a bit too big but not unmanageable. The sleeves are the worst. “Are you secretly an orangutan, Sammy?” Dean mutters to himself as he rolls them up way too many times.
Bobby pulls the door open. He looks tired and annoyed and so familiar that it's hard to breathe. “Hey Sam,” Bobby says.
“Hell,” Sam says, his face all concerned.
“Cas, will my wings look like yours when I'm older?” Jack asks out of nowhere one night, as they're reading side-by-side in comfortable armchairs in the bunker's library.
The three men look at each other, their eyes wide. “Who are you?” Dean asks.
Dean shakes his head automatically. “No, that's fine. I'm good now.” He takes a swig of beer to cover his whirling thoughts. If he can keep Sam
“What did you call Dee?” Bobby asks.
“No problem. I'll put this part in today, but maybe hold off on flying until it's done,” Sam says.
“Yeah. Let's never talk about that again,” Dean says and shuts the door.
Dean feels a sharp pain in his chest. He breathes in automatically. Old habits. No need for air in Hell.
It can't be this easy. All those years trying to hide, trying to find a way around it, and then the truth comes out and there aren't any consequences?
Dean flinches. Castiel withdraws the hand quickly but Dean grabs it. “Cas, you're burning up!” He covers Castiel's forehead with his free hand. “You have a fever. What the hell?”
“Rowena!” he yells.
It happened so fast. Dad came in, angry but cold with it. Dean knows that kind is more dangerous. He and Sam were researching, here, in this room. More ways to stop Lilith breaking enough seals to free Lucifer. And Sam stood up to go greet Dad, and Dad had the shotgun but Dean never thought he'd
Dean feels lightheaded as he takes stock of the rest of his body. His clothes almost don't fit: looser in some places and tighter in others. His arms are huge. He touches his chest and it's flat. He isn't wearing a binder.
“Why?” Dean asks.
“I will be in touch,” Castiel says. Dean's pretty sure that's relief in his voice. It's hard to tell.
Dean turns it off. “Rowena,” he says again. “Come on out.”
“Well, that doesn't sound good!” Dean snaps.
When it doesn't come after a few minutes, he lets out a long breath and pretends to relax. Letting your guard down is asking to be taken out. He doesn't look back.
Memories of childhood hit Dean like another blow. He remembers this feeling of total helplessness. It's worse than the pain.
But Dean's never been very good at being happy. He stops the car at the end of the song. He remembers dying, choking out his last words to Sam. If Dean's dead and not in Heaven, there's only one other place he could be.

“You want to go on a hunt?” Sam asks, eyebrows up.
Bobby is staring at Dean again, holding his beer like he's forgotten about it.
“This is a bad idea,” Bobby says, shaking his head.
Surprise changes Dean's entire stance. “My
“All the more reason to get back on the horse,” Dean says breezily.
Sam can't help but laugh a little. “Okay, well, tell me if you want to stop. I don't want to mess this up.”
Eventually, he finds an abandoned gas station to break into. Thirst drives him to the out-of-order refrigerator. The bottled water is only slightly cooler than room temperature and it tastes like bliss. The newest newspaper says September but who knows how long it's been there.
Dean quickly pulls them back and sits on the edge of the bed, anchoring Sam under the blankets. It's an old trick from when they were kids.
“Nice try,” Bobby says and hangs up.
Sam doesn't look enlightened.
“No, they won't,” Castiel says. Unfolding wings that don't quite bend correctly anymore is painful but Castiel persists, trying not to wince. Jack's lovely pearl-gray wings extend slightly, reaching toward Castiel's. “Why do you ask?”
A breath later, Dean remembers. “Hey, save your juice. Sam needs it more,” he tells Cas.
Bobby freezes.
Castiel takes a deep breath and stretches out shadows of newly perfect black feathers, showing off for the most important people in the world.
Cas' voice is quieter but somehow even more intense. “Your father hurt you to control you, not because you deserve it. You are a good man, in spite of him.”
Dean looks at Sam and Sam looks back wide-eyed. “Uh, no, I guess I forgot,” Sam says.
------
-----
“Bobby? It's me, Dee.”
The angel's blue eyes are intense. His face is sterner than usual. Cas takes a step forward and crouches in front of Dean. “I am here,” he says.
Sam's jaw clenches so tight he hears his teeth creak. He turns off the car. As he gets out, he slips Ruby's knife into his belt, hidden by his jacket.
Bobby pulls back to arm's length but doesn't let go of Dean. “I didn't know, I suspected,” he says. “And I should've tried harder to let you know you could trust me.”
After the best shower of his entire life, Dean discovers he forgot to bring clean clothes into the bathroom with him. He's going to need a whole new wardrobe. Clothes shopping will definitely be more fun now.
Castiel bristles. “I couldn't. And I knew I could walk here relatively quickly from where I landed.”
This time, the pressure is even more intense. Dean cries out as all the glass in the room shatters at once.
Sam sighs heavily. “Then, I guess we'll have to find out more information some other way.”
“Rowena,” he says, his voice loud in the silence.
Bobby circles his desk to sit down on the chair behind it. “So, do you have any idea how you got back?” he asks Dean.
was a dead giveaway. The last thing Dee ever wants to do is talk.
“I healed your body,” Castiel says, slowly. Let him be satisfied with that.
“Stop!” the demon shouts, and for the first time, he sounds like Dee.
“A demon, right? What else could?” Sam asks.
“Yeah,” Dean says. He's braced for the worst now.
“Dad, stop, please!” Dean begs. Behind his back, he scrabbles around on Bobby's desk, blindly looking for a weapon, a phone, anything.
When Dean buried his hands in the feathers of his wings, it felt worse.
“I want it. I want it...
Cas’s presence helped as Chuck wielded his power. It was sharp as a whip and just as effective. It sliced Dean’s torso, chest, and the tops of his legs into bloody ribbons. Until the scarlet liquid dripped into a pool beneath his toes and he slipped and slid and couldn’t keep his feet under him. He sagged on Cas, now longer supporting his own weight at all, energy spent, and only able to writhe as he screamed through the rest of the torture.
“I got you, I got this, feels so right so good,” Dean muttered incomprehensible things behind him, buried his face in the space between Cas’ shoulder blades and nosed along his skin until he could kiss at the back of Cas’ neck.
“I care, deeply. I thought that much was obvious.”
“You’re filthy, these clothes are getting so stiff. How does it feel?”
“It’s a good look on you, can’t believe I missed it.”
to beg for it.” Chuck pointed at Cas and Dean went very, very still.
Cas yelled, air stuck in lungs that didn’t want to expand around the impact site. Dean stepped close, grabbed his hair and yanked so he could whisper against the shell of Cas’s ear. “You make a good piñata.”
“Can’t. Got things to do.”
“Didn’t want to see you fucking my brother,” Dean spat.
"You... you know…?” Sam sounded worried, choked up.
Being bound was different, uncomfortable, strange to be so powerless.
Cas buried his face in the mattress, barely hearing, almost incoherent with the litany of hurts and sensation that encompassed his being. Dean laid over the top of him and the smothering weight went deeper than physical. He knew that all he’d ever wanted was to help these men, and that if this was what it took he would have, if he’d been
Cas wasn’t sure he was correct, but mostly didn’t want to
Cas stopped, started again, faltered while trying to look stoic and unaffected—but Dean saw. Dean always saw. He dropped his chin to his chest and let it hang there, eyes closed tightly so he could pretend he wasn’t embarrassed.
“Do it again,” Dean whispered.
didn’t get tempted.
“Same time tomorrow, boys. Enjoy the scenery.”
, there was nowhere left it could go. Not for the time being.
“That it would ground you, make you… less powerful. Yeah.” Dean rubbed his eyes, looking worn and sleepy.
And with Dean’s come flooding his ass, Dean’s body touching his own, Dean’s breath mingling with the same air, that was what they latched onto. Dean. Dean. Dean. Only Dean.
He wished he could condemn Dean completely but he couldn’t. He wished he had a friend who he could trust. Cas looked up with watery eyes, the image of Sam was already fading, and he cried out.
“If you’ve hurt him—”
Dean, head drooping to his chest, smirked. No, right now he was full of Cas. Through all his agony he was fully aware that the wriggling and jolting and clenching he’d done had given Cas another sort of problem. Cas was hard and thick inside his ass, throbbing a little too. It felt… wonderful. A counterpoint to the pain, a balm to the monotony. Cas was here, it was different, his prison had changed. He felt like a new man.
“Cas, Angel, Baby, you could give a man a heart attack.” Dean’s eyes flashed black at him. “Good job I’m not a man.”
“I can’t move! I can’t— you have to stop!”
Cas’s fingers let go of his wrist instantly. Except then soft probing fingers pushed at his rim and he gaped again. Shock, awe, horror. All of it mixed up and then Cas thrust his hand and he was inside Dean, two fingers up to the second knuckle and—yeah. That helped, a bit. It helped. Dean relaxed a fraction, squirming, wondering if he could get Cas deeper. Cas almost pulled away and Dean’s hand flew back to grab him and stop him.
“But this is better. So much better. You fully clothed but laid out for me to take. Just this one little hole here, where I can get to the meaty centre.”
. If this is what was required to keep the world safe, if it’s what he had to give, he could have helped.
This was just one more thing to add to the list, it seemed. One more painful violation to chalk up to his own ineptitude. He should have been able to fight Dean, at any other time in his long, long life, he would have been the strongest of the two of them. He wasn’t sure what bothered him most—the reminder of his lack of agency and his depleted strength, or his so-called friend taking pleasure from his body without his say-so. It was probably a draw. There were certainly no winners here.
He cried out again as Dean added more pressure, and then near sobbed in relief at getting a moment's respite. “Keep making those sounds Angel, they’re sending my blood right where I want it.”
“Ow! Watch it.”
When Dean estimated it to be almost exactly a day since Cas’s arrival… the wall on his right turned black again. He was used to Cas’s dark hair, and bright blue eyes by then, so the sudden change in colour didn’t make his head ache. He was not prepared to see Sam though, and hissed, pulling away, trying to turn and hide. Cas threw himself forward, and stopped Sam from entering, so he was just a floating torso leaning through the black hole.
“Dean needs to bleed before the day is out and we’re running out of time.”
“Are you going to do this without a fight?”
“Make him stop,” Cas whispered. “I tried, I couldn’t. He’s too strong.”
“What?” Cas paused in his examination of the chains holding Dean up.
as he spoke, pushing on Dean’s inner walls to spread him wider.
He looked up, into light grey eyes and a face full of malice. Chuck turned his face side to side, looking for something—Dean didn’t know what.
