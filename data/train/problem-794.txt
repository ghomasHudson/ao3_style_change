Maybe he flew home. It certainly seemed a lot shorter than what he was anticipating. Or maybe he time travelled. Drinking does that. But it’s never backwards, to fix what you wish you hadn’t done. It’s always waking up and wondering what happened to Wednesday.
He shrugged. “It shouldn’t matter, but it does. Not being in that situation, I can’t give an accurate response.”
He shook his head. “He sees our faults and wishes to correct them; his own faults are not our concern. Our duty is to improve ourselves. It was wasteful to break a slate. I wasn’t paying attention.”
John breathed heavily for a moment, his eyes damp. Sherlock understood what Magnussen had done: it was classic brainwashing, stripping away a person’s ego, and then creating a dependency. John was meant to believe that he could succeed, but needed Magnussen for that.
I didn’t especially care if people did not find me winsome or wish to pinch my cheeks. I didn’t like being touched and had only ever endured hugs from my mother and my old nanny.
The housekeeper brought out a tray with the tea. I’d asked for toast as well, and now brought out the jar I’d carried all the way from China.
And you don’t start telling him how shite your own life is. Murray has already reminded him several times that he needs to get out, meet people (wink, nudge). It’s true, he doesn’t get out much. That doesn’t mean there’s not a collection of empty bottles in his kitchen that he keeps forgetting to put in the recycling bin. Drinking alone is bad, but it’s his most affordable option these days.
that will soon reach maturity. Your client’s ruin would inspire them to think much more clearly and reasonably. It will certainly improve my business prospects.”
As always, Sherlock materialised just as the first pieces of toast were ready. He smiled and gave John a quick kiss, then sat down.
It’s not a boat, he realizes. It’s a swimmer, closer than he looked. People do swim across the channel. It’s twenty-one miles at the narrowest point, but the straits are a busy shipping lane, so a swimmer usually has a boat alongside them as they swim.
He took an object out of his pocket, holding it out of Brook’s reach. “If you’ve hurt Jason, you won’t get out of here alive!”
Why had John Watson chosen to become Jason Bradford? He’d played other roles, in movies, on television, and on stage. Surely he could have created a better alias, one that didn’t draw on his past.
Sherlock frowns. “You always look a bit delirious, John. I think it’s just how you normally look when you’re confused, which is most of the time. You simply walk around, trying to make sense of the world, and find yourself perplexed, with that look on your face. On you, it looks like delirium.”
His face contorted with some painful emotion, just for a moment. Then he hardened his expression. “I must. I will not go through this again. My heart, once broken, may heal. Twice, though, I cannot survive. I will go away before that happens.” He laughed, but it came out like a sob. “Oh, Holmes, don’t you see? It’s never been about money, or fame, or even the adventure. It’s you, always you. I know you don’t— that you can’t—“
people don’t forget. You’d better be living like a monk if you want people to think you’ve changed.”
“You do,” he said, returning her smile. “And I’m sorry if I embarrassed you today. You didn’t deserve that.”
“I don’t intend to use it,” I replied. “We’re dealing with a dangerous man, Watson, one who threatens people daily. I’d like to have a threat of my own. I am not a man to lose my head. Not as hot-headed as some people I
He remembers women used to flirt with him. It was flattering to be considered a catch by pretty girls at uni, and now he wonders if that flattery had led him to think he was straight. Mary had certainly flirted, aggressively. He remembers the night he took her out to a fancy restaurant, the best he could afford, and picked out a bottle of wine from the list. He was nineteen, and he felt like a man, doing adult things. She looked at him like he’d hung the moon.
“I shall never marry,” I said, “lest it bias my judgment.” My disgust was aimed both at my mother’s foolish plans and any potential brides she might put forward.
He’s felt jealousy before. This can’t be that. He remembers someone flirting with a girl he’d fancied once, suddenly feeling proprietary, as if she were his. That same feeling flares up when he thinks of Holmes chatting up people in a bar, maybe flirting a bit to get them to talk. He’ll try to
“I’d just like to tidy up a bit, dear, if you’ll let me.” She gestures vaguely. “It’s been days… the things he left lying about… and my goodness, the kitchen…”
Lestrade drained his beer in one draught, signalled the waitress for another. “I take offence at that, on behalf of fifteen year olds everywhere. My daughter is fourteen, and she could have written a better script.” He gave Sherlock a guilty look. “Don’t tell Molly I said that.”
John has been moody, and Sherlock doesn’t understand why. Moodiness he understands; he knows that he himself is a moody person, swinging between almost days of manic activity and days where he barely moves. He warned John about that, knowing that it’s best to be upfront about one’s failings.
What had happened to the old governess, Miss Faucher, I never learned. I’d liked her, though she was stern. She spoke French, which my mother had taught me, and gave me interesting things to read. Quite often she lectured my cousins about what fate awaited idle children who refused to read their lessons. I did not care what my cousins thought of her or whether they failed to apply themselves and grew up to be ignorant and useless. Miss Faucher never scolded me, but did not hesitate to reprimand my cousins when they talked back to her. I suppose that explains why she left, but I do not know whether she made that decision herself, or if Aunt Kitty sent her away for bullying her
Irene popped the cork and began filling glasses.. “It’s never been clear to me why a heterosexual couple should be allowed to kiss before nine o’clock, and a gay couple has to wait. You’re not the first, but I think your kiss might be the one to start things moving in a new direction.” She laughed. “And it’s about time! What’s the worst they can do to me? Tonight is a one-shot. I already have a reputation for pushing limits in
. Women attract him too, and he grabbed onto heterosexuality like a life-raft because he was afraid of the alternative. His sister and his father, yelling. Harry thrown out of the house. His father, looking at him, saying
Well, his neighbour downstairs didn’t mind the violin, which was a point in her favour, but she was a woman. Not his area.
Warning: This chapter references an abusive relationship in the past between an adult and a 17 year old.
“I believe we do.” I held up the glass. “These are the prints of the man who was employed to fix the masonry of the garden wall. At my request, Mr Chadwick has summoned him to complain about a fault in the wall. While he was fixing it this morning, I had the kitchen maid offer him a glass of lemonade. His prints on this glass match those of the thief.”
“Afghanistan,” Holmes repeats. He shakes his head ruefully. “It’s always something.” He reaches across the table and picks up Watson’s phone. It’s a bit large for John’s pocket, and he’s always worried about losing it or breaking it. A much nicer phone than he would have bought for himself, it’s actually the first mobile phone he’s owned. In 2006, people had flip phones. And he had nobody to call then.
He’s in the pathology lab at Barts Hospital when Watson walks in. He’s with Mike Stamford, an anatomy lecturer that Holmes has gotten to know.
Sighing, he said nothing but limped a bit faster. When we reached our destination, a house in Kensington, I pointed to an upstairs window. “Up there is an open window. You must climb up, slip inside, and let me in below.”
I put my arms around him, embracing the icy cold. “John, I have to leave here, and I don’t know how long I will be gone. I will return someday, though, and I will find your bones. I will put you in a proper grave and visit you every day.”
But he and Holmes are nothing to one another, not even friends. They have their own, separate lives, even if the last couple of days have been spent together. And jealousy isn’t about love. If he loved Sherlock, he would know it. He would feel— well, it’s not. Jealousy is about wanting. Wanting to have. John doesn’t even know what he wants. And he certainly doesn’t
“No. Well, he injected me with some kind of sedative about an hour ago, but it’s wearing off. I’m okay.”
She shrugs. “Whatever.” Not exactly an invitation, but she has taken out her earbuds and seems to be listening.
In the video, the man is pushing Watson against a wall. They can see the man’s back and Watson’s face, though the resolution is not great. There’s no audio, but he’s clearly talking to Watson, leaning into him as if he’s making a salacious suggestion. They can see the gleam of a knife in the hand he holds behind himself.
“And what will you get out of it? It’s one night, Alex Tribble’s hand reaching up from the grave. Nobody will be thinking about a week later.”
The dentist pushed his chair back and removed his mask, revealing a full beard. “Well. I think we might try bonding a composite material to the tooth, Mr Holmes. That would be the least invasive. It’s quite a chunk you’ve broken off, though, so you might consider an implant. That would require me to remove the existing tooth. It’s your decision.”
By the time the clock was striking midnight, I had worked myself into a thoroughly pitiful state. When I heard Watson come through the door, his feet on the stairs, I did not rouse. I stayed in my chair, hugging my knees and staring into what remained of the fire, those dying embers symbolic of all I had lost.
“No, but it’s very dangerous. It might have destroyed the world, if he’d gotten it and used it. He could have made himself Emperor of Earth.”
No longer holding back, I pushed my way through the crowd of people waiting, caught him in my arms. “John,” I said, pulling him close. Then I found I could not talk at all. I simply breathed.
Smiling, he hunts for his dressing gown and toothbrush. He showered last night, so he ought to hold for a day. With any luck, he’ll be home by then, in his own space.
The words they say won’t be important. They both know, and will take that step forward now to meet the other. She imagines them in the dark entryway of 221B, standing in that moment of indecision. Then, tentatively, their arms going around each other, their fear dissolved.
I’m having one of those nights, though. It rained this morning, so I didn’t ride my bike to the surgery, still raining when I got home, a steady, drenching rain, so I haven’t walked. I’m staring at the ceiling, wondering whether I should take the pill.
So he drinks, just as his father did. Dad got into fights when he was drunk; otherwise, he was a quiet man. He saved junk because it was better to have junk than nothing. A windfall would slip through his fingers; he hoarded pennies and pounds. He was two men, really, the spender and the hoarder. He drank to deal with the perpetual row going on inside his head.
A cup of punch in his hand, John sinks down into the sofa. Smiling, Matt takes the seat next to him. “You look happy.”
After a few weeks in my new home, I found myself in trouble once again. My group was studying the Bible. Mr Anders, the teacher of this youngest group, was reading aloud a passage of scripture in his thin voice, trying to inspire our awe with these words:
Even though he’d reserved it, John hadn’t quite expected the opulence of the Honeymoon Suite. It had its own jacuzzi and a shower big enough for an orgy, as well as an extremely large, round bed, like a cake. John thought about all the things they might do in that bed, if that had ever become part of the game. But it hadn’t.
Fifteen minutes later he was riding the bus home, a small, flat box tucked into his pocket. He’d picked up a card to go with it, and would write something romantic before giving it to Sherlock tomorrow. He would prop it up on the table so Sherlock couldn’t miss it when he finally decided to wake up and eat breakfast.
He set his hand next to mine. It was translucent, like an old photograph that has faded. Laying my hand against his, palm to palm, I could feel only the wave of cold, nothing of his skin or the shape of his hand. His eyes, however, opened in surprise at the touch and then the corners of his mouth quirked up. He was laughing, silently. I laughed, too. How could I fear a spirit that felt mirth?
actually the drug-seeking relative who’s always asking to borrow a few pounds. Only until the next case is solved.)
“If that’s so, then you must do your lessons and not annoy your cousins. They cannot help that they are not as bright as you.”
“Mrs Hudson,” I said. “I am an antiquarian, a researcher and an historian. You must not worry if you find that I have some rather unusual objects in the flat, such as this skull. Please, do not be alarmed.”
He rolls out of the scratchy sheets (doesn’t think of Sherlock’s high thread-count, Egyptian cotton sheets and satin pillowcases), has a quick wash using the hotel toiletries (nothing like the scent of Sherlock’s shampoo), and puts on the same clothes he wore yesterday, an emotional age ago. He pays his bill and checks out, begins to walk, thinking.
As I stood looking at his coffin, I wondered what people thought when they were dead, if they could think at all. What was left of a person, once all the flesh and blood and guts were gone, only their bones left? I wondered if they missed being alive.
It has to start with him, he decides. He has to be more courageous, learn how to say who he is and what he wants. With Sherlock and with Mary, he has to stand up for himself and stop avoiding uncomfortable subjects. That’s the only way this will work.
It was in London that I began to spend time among these spiritualists. Science had not solved the problem of death, and spiritualism had filled that space. Though it was not a science, that did not mean that answers were not there; it only meant that I needed to sift through the evidence to find them.
“There have been people who have survived suicide attempts. Many of them express that they realised at once that they’d made a mistake, that they knew they didn’t want to die.” He put his arms around John. “I’ve been careless with my life in the past. I’ve overdosed twice, and once nearly died of sepsis. The last time I overdosed, I would not have cared if I’d died, but that was because you were dead.” The tears were coming now, dripping into John’s hair.
Her eyes flutter open and she startles again. But she’s seen a lot of deaths, many of them odd in some way. Maybe she’s even seen a dead man come back to life.
It soon became clear that when I failed to turn up by bedtime, which was the first point in the day where my presence was missed, my cousins suggested that I’d run away. People had spent a good part of the night hunting for me, and when talk turned to involving the police, Edwin finally admitted what they had done.
He’s just William now, last name Vernet, after the artist whose painting of a shipwreck he once admired. He lives in a cottage, keeps bees, and occasionally draws money from a very old bank account.
more. The bits of evidence he’s gathering refuse to form a coherent picture; John asks a question, and it all comes together. John isn’t brilliant, but he shines a light in the corners Sherlock has overlooked.
“Yes.” Sherlock smiles sadly. “I was here yesterday. Last night I landed in Bucharest. The hotel is dismal and I miss Baker Street so much. I miss you. I’m lying on a dirty mattress, trying to sleep, thinking about how to begin this mission, and I wish you were with me. I wish I’d told you before I left. So I’m imagining that I did tell you.”
Lestrade his standing there watching him, his eyes soft. “Call him. Just do it before you overthink this. Talk to him.”
“Could you please put Miss Adler’s photo in a drawer? I don’t fancy her watching us from the top of the bureau while we—”
This gave me an opening to leave the room. Watson rose and said he might like to see the house where I’d grown up, but my mother gave him a stern look and asked what sort of music he enjoyed. Fortunately I’d schooled him in the classical composers and as I left the room, he was telling her how much he loved Tchaikovsky. She would tell him that Russians were tediously sentimental, and that he should listen only to German composers if he wished to train his ear.
He’s home, but it’s not really home. Not now, not after 221B Baker Street. Even if he wanted to be here, it would feel like a stranger’s home.
Mycroft wasn’t omniscient, but he did have very good surveillance. I had obviously missed a few bugs on my last sweep of the flat.
John puts his arms around him, rises up on his toes to whisper in his ear. “I’ll let you take it off me later.”
Maybe that’s why he’s been angry with Sherlock, because he’s reminded John who he used to be, back before he got lost.
We took a cab home to Baker Street. As we rumbled over the streets, I was humming Sarasate, waiting to see what Watson would say,.
He doesn’t limp now. The cane was at his side when he walked into the Rock Garden. He remembers his hand around it, self-conscious, while he was watching people dance. He must have left it inside when he went into the alley. Or maybe he dropped it there.
The room was dark and smelled of dust. Even when I was a very young child, I was not afraid of the dark. And I do not fear death, or things that have died. But when I heard the click of that key, I felt something I had not expected.
Whatever she had to say to him, he knew he deserved her reproof. He’d been cruel to Molly today, letting his own feelings come out in a way that hurt her.
His date last night was an awful parody of that long-ago evening. Instead of being desirable, he’d been an object of pity. Instead of flirtation, there were awkward pauses and short conversations. He is no longer the one sought; he has become the one friends feel sorry for, try to pair up with anyone they know who is still single. Next will be the divorced women, complete with children. He doesn’t want that. Not a woman, not someone else’s kids.
“Calm yourself,” I said. “When a man is hot-headed there is no possibility of him acting rationally. And reason is what is needed right now.” A disguise would be essential for the first part, which was reconnaissance. A young tradesman, I thought. Surely there were women in Milverton’s employ…
As if on cue, Greg spoke up. “Fond memories. Even then, we could all see that Sherlock was going places. He’s a gifted actor, and I’m glad he’s had opportunities to show his range. I don’t think anyone looks at him and still sees Alex Tribble.” He gave Sherlock an encouraging smile.
“I don’t care who their fathers are.” Holmes speaks quietly, but Watson can hear the contempt in his voice. “The police don’t care, either. I’m a detective. My work is putting bullies where they can’t hurt other people. A crime has been committed, and someone needs to be held accountable. You’re not a murderer, Charles. You’re a boy who sees injustice and wants to change that. Will you help us?”
, flirtatiously. Technically, she’s his boss, managing partner of the small surgery where he has started to work two or three days a week. It’s a general practice, so they see a bit of everything— minor injuries, kids’ ailments, chronic conditions. And it’s a short train ride away from Baker Street, far enough to give him some space, close enough to get him home quickly in an emergency— or what passes for an emergency in Sherlock’s mind. It’s a nice job, absorbing, but not overwhelming.
That does sound like a good idea. He feels plastered, his legs like springs, his brain like cotton. He hadn’t planned on drinking so much. Maybe it’s time to go home.
As he went through the remaining pages, he was not terribly surprised to find two kidneys and a bladder (
“He showed up as I was leaving Barts. We walked back here and talked a bit. He’s sorry, John. You know how he is. He never expects people to care about him, so he acts like an arse.”
In the darkness, John wonders what Sherlock’s face is doing. He reaches up a hand and touches his cheek, imagines that it’s turning that beautiful shade of pink it often does when he’s shy of saying something.
Putting my arms around him, I clung to him. How strange it was to be dead and yet to feel his body as if we were both alive. “I’ll miss you.”
After a few weeks of bone broth and thin gruel, I was well enough to resume my studies Seven boys and one teacher had died; the rest of us returned to our studies.
Mike doesn’t make an excuse to leave. The genial expression on his round face morphs into solicitous interest. “Could you get a flatshare?”
He sighs. “I used your devotion, and I am truly sorry about that, but you were the logical person to ask. You always got me body parts, and I didn’t figure getting an entire corpse would be out of the question.”
“Of course not. Though if you had turned your talents in that direction, I believe you could have gotten away with it. Thank heavens you did not! But tell me, did you ever find out the identity of the man who confessed that night?”
Sherlock channeled a bit of Baz Culpeper, removed and almost icy. He’d always played Alex as a naif, a creature innocent of human evil, but one also incredibly observant and unwilling to be bullied. This adult Alex couldn’t be quite so innocent.
“Darling, you think too much. Knowing this about you, I didn’t want you to over-analyse what was going to happen. If I’d told you, you wouldn’t have been able to do what you did tonight. Live television can be spontaneous, unexpected— which was exactly what we needed.”
At any rate, here he is, outside his building, and the key is here and there is a bed waiting for him upstairs if he can just climb all the stairs to get there.
“Oh, do come along!,” I chided. “Our suspect is away and his staff are abed. We must get in and out quickly.”
“Now,” says Matt, “nobody needs to be afraid you’re going to make a fool of yourself, since Cher and I have already gone there, done that. Who’s next?” He looks pointedly at John.
“I do want that, though.” John sighs into Sherlock’s chest. “I want… all of it. Christ, I really am rubbish at talking. I can’t even say it. What I mean is, be patient with me. I’m open to… what you wanted. I’m just not experienced. In that.”
“Hullo! I didn’t think you’d still be up,” he said, hanging his coat and hat by the door. “Everything all right?”
“You’ve been handling my other casework. We have other clients requiring our attention, and I did not wish to distract you. I need to be away when this trap is sprung, so we will take the holiday I promised you. It would be best for Scotland Yard to manage this without my presence.”
He remembers the night he shot the cabbie, how frantic he’d been until he saw Jefferson Hope dimly through a window, handing a bottle to Sherlock, and knew exactly what he needed to do. Knowing made his hands steady, his aim true.
He imagines evenings at the Watson house, Mary dominating every aspect of John’s life, and John putting up with it because he feels he has to. Rationally, he can see why John married her. He’s a responsible person, and could never turn his back on a situation he felt responsible for. Irrationally, he despises Mary Watson because of what she did to John, cheating and breaking his heart. He even suspects that she got pregnant on purpose, thinking that she’d snagged a doctor and imagining the prestige he might have if she could just push him a bit more. John was just raw material for her ambitions.
“I never do,” he replied. “That is a trait I believe we share. We’re both wary, disinclined to socialise, even though that’s what one does in this business. At our core, we don’t trust people, and make sure they know as little about us as possible. We’re intelligent, able to see through people before they see through us.”
He also remembered a person he’d met at that scene, Detective Sergeant Greg Lestrade of the Metropolitan Police.
“Get him out of here,” she said, pointing at Brook. “I’ll give you my statement when I’m done here.”
There’s something about coming face to face with a person who is vaguely familiar and clearly recognises you that makes one feel obligated to stay and chat. Mike Stamford, the bloke he sat next to in Anatomy, looks delighted to run into him, and he can’t very well say,
Holmes and Wilkes hold each other’s gaze for a few moments, during which Watson wonders what Huxtable was told concerning their visit. He also remembers that touching your nose is a sign you’re lying. He can’t remember where he heard this, or even if it’s true, but all his instincts tell him that the man is concealing something.
He opens the door, sets the bags on the table. “I thought I’d really fucked everything up. That you wouldn’t want me if I had a kid. Every time a new one showed up, I couldn’t believe you were staying. I feel so lucky to have you.”
Mrs Bellamy, largely ignored by her husband, turned and smiled at Watson. “My husband speaks admiringly of you, Doctor. We read your recent story in the Strand. You have quite a talent in your own right.”
It had taken them less than thirty minutes to go from the Rizla game to just asking each other random questions. The only celebrities that Sherlock knew were nineteenth-century chemists and twentieth-century criminals, which had more or less spoiled the game, and Sherlock had declared it
“I just want to live with you.” Her voice is small; she glances at Sherlock. “Well, not all the time. But Sherlock doesn’t hate children and I really like him, so can I?”
He pours himself another glass, swirls it and lets himself be mesmerised by the way it catches the light. His father spent every evening romancing a glass of whisky, slowly drowning himself, letting his life slip away.
The whip comes down and Sherlock winces, but does not cry out. I feel my skin split, a stripe open on my back. I want to cry out, but I don’t want Sherlock to know. I won’t let him see.
Sherlock is chained, arms to opposite walls, slumped over. His back is covered with blood, criss-crossed with wounds. A man with a whip hits him again and again. He cries out.
Mason is every bit as tall as Wilkes, but built like a brick wall. He’s a placid man, but looks extremely put out with the entire situation.
John is awake, but doesn’t say much. Sherlock continues to sit beside him, talking enough for the both of them. He deduces the nurses, both of whom are having boyfriend troubles. Kelsey doesn’t know his boyfriend is cheating on him, and Amber is beginning to think a dog would be less trouble than a man.
Breaking the fourth wall for a moment, he looked out over the rows of faces, some of them grinning, some crying, all of them cheering. Mostly women, but men, too. Families with children and grandparents. Alex Tribble’s fans.
.” He laughed. “I did it because I already hated the rom-com, meet-cute ghetto. I was afraid I’d be stuck there if I didn’t break out, do something different. I thought I could act, and was so excited to be cast in a movie like that. And I realised after, the only reason he cast me was that he saw a person he could use and discard.”
He gestures the way, decides that he can make tea. It will give him something to do with his hands while he figures out what to do about this girl. On the landing they step past the suitcase and box, the girl casting a look at them, but not asking.
“That someone is an idiot,” he replied. “Standing here, these trees, these… ghosts—“ He waved a hand around them. “I’ve always wanted to see this place, and I’m glad you were willing. It makes me appreciate the fact that we didn’t die, that we do have one another. It makes me grateful for having a second chance with you.”
“That’s not what I meant. You have real emotions about this, and if you act like a sociopath it will hurt you— not just your career, but you personally. It won’t help you deal with it.”
“We’ve been married five months, according to this. October 31, 2009. We were married on Halloween?”
is becoming a bore. Lestrade may be happy playing a cop for the rest of his career, but I am not content to play Baz Culpeper, consulting detective, for two more years. My character is supposed to base all his deductions on reason and logic, but every week it’s coincidence that solves it. And a raise will make them feel entitled to even more of my time. I’d rather have better writers than a raise, to be honest. The series has gone flat. I like working with Greg, but the cases are boring.”
“Wrong. It’s my business, Sherlock. Your career could get a nice boost from this. The proceeds are going to charity, and you’re not particularly known for your charitable efforts, so this can only help.”
He hears, rather than sees, her shrug. “I’ve been busy. I know you want to see Rosamund, it’s just…” She sighs. “You’re not here, so you can’t know how difficult things are right now.”
The doorbell rings. It’s David, the one he met at the restaurant. God, he’s tall. John briefly wonders what Sherlock would deduce about the pretentious horn-rim glasses and the fake tan.
And I would not return and find John’s bones, give them a new place to rest as I had promised. This gave me a deep pang of regret. I had promised him a grave with a proper marker, where I could visit him; instead his bones would lie under the grass near the greenwood, and mine would lie in the little graveyard at the school chapel. Maybe I would haunt the school with the other children.
He might have been irritated, thinking that the man had looked him up, pried into his life. No, that was impossible. It was just by chance that he’d run into Mike and followed him to Barts.
I had grown close to one boy, as he was the next to join our school after me. His name was Victor, and he was from a small town in Wales. Because he was small and sickly, I felt compassion for him. His bed was next to mine, and sometimes I heard him cry at night. Then I would climb in bed with him and we would whisper to one another until we fell asleep.
Mycroft frowns at his brother and continues. “It is a paradox. We can with almost perfect accuracy predict great events which result from numerous small, unpredictable events. Randomness produces an outcome which, when looked at mathematically, seems inevitable.” He raises his glass to Sherlock and John. “As I say, you may have met in any number of ways, but I believe that the universe would always have brought you together. Any other outcome would have been impossible. Let us raise our glasses to inevitability.”
The problem is this: Sherlock can’t be someone he is not. John must love him for himself, not the person he imagines him to be.
Again and again the whip flies, and I feel myself shredding. I’m crying, my tears watering his back, giving my sorrow to him, a poor sacrifice for all he’s given me. I give him all the grief I’ve felt for two years, my regret for letting him protect me when he didn’t see himself as worthy of my love and protection. I give myself to him, and know that if I have to die to save him, I will not hesitate. He made that decision two years ago for me, and I was angry. Now, I understand.
I looked at his sleeping form, now young and handsome, just as he was on the day we met. Two young men, hungry for danger and adventure and mystery.
“Too dangerous. It would have meant trouble for her.” I smiled. “The cake was delicious, by the way.”
I glanced at Watson, who had turned pale. “Mother, though I have never given it much thought before, I am amenable to your suggestion. However, I am only twenty-five. Do you not think it reasonable to wait a few years? Watson and I have—“
She said this because he was complaining about coming home from uni, telling her that since he would no doubt spend the entire holiday in his room, what difference would it make if he came back to the house where he grew up?
What happened after the curtain went down; lots of squishy cuddles; paparazzi; an interview with Mary Morstan; and a year later, some old ghosts.
“I have a friend at Scotland Yard I’ve consulted with on scripts a few times. I called him when I suspected there was more to Brook than Diarrhoea Dude. He told me there’s an active investigation on him and asked me not to tip him off. Those two extras who’ve been hanging around for the last month were actually undercover cops, so I wasn’t too worried. And once John was on board, I knew I had a stand-in for him.”
He cracks a couple eggs into the pan he’s set on the burner. Breakfast for supper, as most days. He often skips the morning meal, just a cup of tea to tide him over until lunch. Most days that’s a tin of soup, though occasionally he splurges on coffee and a sandwich at the shop down the road. He could probably eat more, but he finds that he’s not hungry most days. Weeks of battling a gut infection left his bowels a mess, and he doesn’t like to load himself down with heavy food.
“Of course not. She’s fourteen, John. She gets ideas in her head about things, and kids can be mean. She’ll get over it.”
He helped himself to another egg. “My hand does not shake when I am sure of something. He was going to kill you, Holmes.”
Having spotted a camera at the door, Sherlock asks to see the security footage. He and Lestrade watch the film speeded up, starting from yesterday’s closing, noting each client’s departure, the staff wiping down the equipment, the manager closing out the computer, and eventually the last staff member leaving, arming the security and closing the door behind him. The dead man does not appear in the footage.
Maybe that’s who he is now, but he’s not going to give in without a fight. He’s going to risk losing, and have a look underneath the burden he’s been carrying around, thinking that was his life.
“In a fine suit, you’re a treat for the eyes. Tonight—“ he slipped a hand into my trousers. “I want to have my way with you, posh boy.”
“I saw it when we first met, and every time we met again. I felt it every time I came back, and every time I left. I knew it when you took care of me, when you were angry with me,
“I’m not a prima donna, no matter what you’ve heard. I have committed myself to this. You may rely on my professionalism.”
He sighed and stood up. “Tea, old man? You know, boiling water is not so difficult. Even you might manage it. As a chemist, you ought to acquaint yourself with the procedures for brewing tea.”
He stares at Holmes. “You really think there are four murderers in London, all of them with the same idea to randomly kill gay men?”
He wanted John to know what he was really like, to see him for who he is. Now John has voluntarily spent an entire day with him, following him around, chasing cabs, leaping across rooftops, being left behind (twice)— and yet, here he is, patiently standing by a police car, waiting for Sherlock to notice him. He’s killed a man to save Sherlock. Why is he still here?
I am not susceptible in the least to the wiles of either gender, and hold the same standard for all of my cases. If a potential client bores me, there is little chance I will take their case.
Every ghost I’d met remembered who they were; they appeared in that form, a shadow of the life they’d left. John had always appeared to me as the child he was when he died, but now he often seemed to be trying to stretch himself into an adult. When he did this, he was always a bit distorted, sometimes forgetting his ears or making his arms too long. I understood what he was doing. If a ghost can wish for something, it might be to have a body— warm, feeling flesh that would grow and experience things. John had never grown up. Now that he had come to haunt me, it was plain that he was trying to simulate the experience of being grown.
“So, after years of trying to convince everyone that you’re straight, you’ve decided to have a go at being gay. Is that it?”
is not something a ghost can possess, but they often appear bloody or ghastly from their final illness or accident. Flora showed none of the injuries that had killed her.
Irene glanced at him and smiled. “Molly and I have a few ideas about what the MacGuffin is, but we need to work on it a bit more. Since it won’t be revealed until the ending, I’m going to have to leave you all in suspense, too. Rest assured, it won’t be pointless or silly. Well, it probably will be, but we’ll make it meaningful within the story’s context.”
Even his relationship with Sherlock was founded on loyalty. He’d known Sherlock less than two days when he shot a man to save his life. He didn’t hesitate. He lined up his shot and took it, knowing there might be consequences.
When it’s night, John doesn’t object to being tucked into Sherlock’s bed, avoiding all the stairs up to his own bed. Sherlock will sleep on the sofa. That’s what he tells John, anyway. The first few nights, he sits in a chair next to the bed, watching John sleep. The release papers say he doesn’t need to wake him; the danger from the concussion is past. Now it’s just waiting to see how much will come back to him, and if there are any areas of impairment.
“Someone needs to say something to her,” he told Lestrade as they waited to do some publicity shots for the airing of the final episode.
Lestrade laughs. “I can imagine the conversation they’re having. Parenting is not for the weak.” He looks at Sherlock with a small frown. “Are you all right? Is John…?”
“Isn’t it? Your nature drives you towards danger, to prove that you can survive. My nature compels me to self-medicate lest boredom drive me towards insanity. Currently my drug of choice is brain work, not cocaine, but I am, and always will be, an addict. As a medical man, you understand addiction. And you yourself are no different, drinking to avoid dull reality, so you don’t have to face things about yourself, so you can avoid making choices. I observe that your drinking is more than occasional, Doctor, and not at all social. From where I stand, someone who drinks that seriously, for those reasons, is an alcoholic. You can blame your father or your sister or
No, that would be selfish. What could John do with that sentiment? He can’t love Sherlock back, except as a best friend. That will have to be enough. He will love John secretly, in his heart of hearts, until he dies.
“You looked very nice when you left last night. All dressed up.” She shrugs. “Of course, you always look nice. But you were nervous. That’s not usual for you. So tell me, what is he like?”
With sudden certainty, Sherlock knows he wants to be that man. He wants to know John Watson, and to explore those things with him.
It’s too soon. He doesn’t know how to do this, how to look at a man or think about a relationship with one. For over ten years he’s been someone’s husband, someone’s father, a doctor, a soldier. Most of that is gone now. It’s time to start over, be someone new.
“Promise me,” I repeat, knowing there is no promise I can extract from this man. “I know he’s in danger. If he dies… if it comes to that, you must tell me. I can’t live… with uncertainty.”
It was still dark when I awoke. I checked the time and let Watson sleep on, feeling his chest rise and fall under my arm. I have never considered myself a sentimental man, but at that moment it was clear that I had reached a crisis. Moriarty was a greater threat than I had predicted; what he was playing at was not a game. If I cared about Watson, I would have to protect him, and that would almost certainly mean leaving him.
As the paralytic effects wore off, Brook was dramatically carried off stage by two beefy extras who looked rather like the Men in Black. His final, villainous moment was mostly scenery-chewing.
Watson sank into his chair. “I cannot be calm with such a despicable human being preying on people. Perhaps you are not so hot, but we must do something. Sitting around smoking our pipes while that— that
“Of course. She is our Queen, and a lady. In any case, she would not appear in our rooms, but summon us to the palace.”
Watson shudders again. Lestrade gives Holmes a look that is probably familiar to him. Holmes rolls his eyes. An exchange they’ve had many times, he thinks.
“I’m near falling asleep,” he protested. “If you’re thinking about getting off, you’d better hurry before I’m unconscious.”
“Yes, indeed,” said Mr Allen. “And in your line of work, many practical applications. Just imagine how improved photographic methods might capture details of a crime scene— position of the body, murder weapon—”
He reviews the gym’s security footage, finds the blip where something has been deleted. Lestrade obtains video from the parking lot which clearly shows the victim getting out of his car and walking towards the door just as the gym is closing up. He is let inside by Chisled Abs, aka Steven Vincent.
As if a cue had been given offstage, there was a knock on the door. Everyone froze, looking at one another. Yes, they were all present and accounted for. No one missing except—
If he believed in fate, which he suspects he does, he would see this not as a coincidence, but as the universe offering him a clue. If he’s hoping to solve his life, he’s going to have to start paying attention.
I walked right by him on Baker Street once when he was dressed as an elderly priest. Another time I tried to give directions to a wino who couldn’t remember where he wanted to go. Again, Sherlock. He explained it to me:
It’s nearly noon. If none of that had happened, he’d probably be waking up now. Alone, most likely. He’s not sure how the party would have gone without Freddy Mercury, but he’s certain that there wouldn’t have been any guitar solos from John Watson. He would have gone home early, finished the half bottle of scotch in his cupboard, and fallen asleep in his horrible bed. He’d be waking up to another dreadful day in his boring life.
“Six, I think.” Sherlock had watched that movie more times than he could count. It was a remake of Chaplin’s 1921
Sherlock Holmes undoubtedly has someone. He was a horrible person, but he has most definitely turned out better-looking than John has. He was always going to be tall, John supposes, but that odd angular face, those clear eyes that had always startled John— all of it has come together in a configuration that is oddly pleasing. Not merely pleasing. He’s a handsome man. Gorgeous, in fact. Any awkwardness he’d had in school was gone. Simply but elegantly dressed, every movement graceful. Even just standing there, he’d somehow conveyed a dancer’s grace.
He stood awkwardly in the doorway. “I was hoping… Perhaps I misunderstood…” He stepped into the room. Unexpectedly, he threw himself at my feet. “Sir, I admire you greatly. I know you think I’m an ignorant boy because of the way I responded to your… your attentions. But I want to learn! Can’t you see? I will be anything you desire, if only you’ll let me be your… your…”
When he’s awake, though, he doesn’t initiate conversations. John has never been the kind of person who talks your ear off, so maybe this is fine.
“Do keep up, John,” I said. “When you applied to be a donor, you did not check the box to keep your identity secret. At the time, you were at uni, studying to be a doctor, and you thought it would be wise to let the recipient of your genetic material have access to your medical history. Obviously Ariel’s mother had that information in a file, and Ariel, knowing that her mother had information about her father, consulted this when choosing her destination. She got your address from the Office of Veterans’ Affairs. When Mrs Hudson answered the door, she informed her that you are her father, and Mrs Hudson let her in.”
Holmes shrugs. “Not quite like this. There’s more to this situation than meets the eye. It’s not just unhappy boys being picked on and harming themselves. It’s more organised, I think. But yes, in our day there were boys who made it their mission to make other boys miserable. You know that.”
When he’s said this, he realises there’s a truth buried under those choices. He doesn’t love Mary, and it didn’t start with the letter she sent to Afghanistan. Maybe he hasn’t loved her for years. This shouldn’t be such a revelation to him, but it is. He’s been holding onto a fantasy that maybe never existed. He’s held on for Rosie, who deserves two loving parents. Now they will have to figure out how they can give her that.
That’s what I imagine when I can’t sleep. But I know where my imagination will eventually lead. You’re in your dressing gown, yelling about deerstalker hats, and I’m reading the paper, realising that you’re this close to being famous now and that will change everything. I’m a bit worried about that, how it will change you, what it will mean for me.
His own confrontation with Fake Jason came next. They had practiced it so many times that he shouldn’t have been nervous, but he was. Every single time they’d rehearsed, Brook had some little suggestion, some nuance he wanted his character to have. At one point he’d decided that Fake Jason should touch Alex a lot as a way of seeking dominance over him. Sherlock had thought it ridiculous and annoying, and Irene had agreed. He’d settled for pacing around Sherlock like a panther.
Mike left me a bottle. Something herbal, to help me sleep. He’s a careful doctor, a cautious man, and knows me well enough to understand what kind of pain this is.
“But here is what I wish to confess to you, my boy. I became obsessed, wondering whether there truly could be an unsolvable crime. It must obviously be a murder, but without any suspects, no weapon, and no opportunity for it to have happened. For many years I planned it, and at last I believed I’d invented the perfect crime. And so it was.”
None of that matters when their mouths finally meet, fulfilling the promise of that earlier, brief kiss. It’s longer this time, tender but promising something more— to stay.
“I thought we’d share a bottle,” his date says. “Perhaps you’d like to look at the menu before we decide.”
“A hunch, based on what I know about Mike Stamford. No matter how good a friend he is, he wouldn’t arrange a date for someone who had treated his wife poorly.” He looks down at his plate. “Sorry.”
“It’s just that—“ He paused, looking a bit apologetic. “There’s a lot of luck involved. So many things might have gone wrong, sending you down another path. What if John hadn’t died? What if you hadn’t become a junkie—“
John smiled. “I know you don’t like Valentine’s Day, but I wanted to get you something because it’s our first. It’s all right if you—“
He wanted to put his arms around John. He’d done that once, comforting him in his sorrow. Now, it might be too much.
Once we’re home and have made it upstairs without Mrs Hudson hearing us, Sherlock removes his shirt and shows me his wounds.
He takes a mug from the cupboard, finds a nearly full box of tea. The worktop is spotless, all the way to the wall, and the sink is empty, no neglected dishes. Even the windows are clean enough to see through. Waiting for the water to boil, he wonders why he ever thought Harry was such a slob.
As I begin to move forward, the footsteps resume and I realise, with relief, that it’s John. He knows I’m here, behind him. I hope he’s brought his revolver; I seem to have left mine at the flat.
Sherlock had wished for that kind of anonymity as well, and realised that more than once Mycroft had kept him from the worst of himself. The stints in rehab, while horrible, had allowed him to step out of his life in a way that John hadn’t been able to do.
They had lunch, and then a few drinks. Soon he was pouring out all of his misadventures, bitterly confessing that he wished he’d never married, that he wouldn’t make that choice if he had it to do over, and that he was ready to move on, even if it meant starting over from scratch.
Holmes nods. “Right. After we’ve got their version of events, which will be limited to what he’s told them and include a lot of hand-wringing and self-pity from his parents, we’ll talk to him.“
Last of the big angst. You will note that I've added a chapter. Not really, but Chapter 9 just became so long that I had to break it up. I had intended to post Chapters 8 and 9 together, so here you go-- three chapters in one day.
She said he’d seemed a little depressed, but assumed it was because he’d just broken up with his girlfriend. He’d asked for a couple days off while they were in Japan, saying he was going to meet up with a friend and do some hiking. She didn’t know who the friend was or where they were meeting.
and sometimes he even yells a bit. But the next morning, there he is, making the tea, putting extra sugar in Sherlock’s cup, and asking if he has anything on for the day.
Watson was dancing again, flirting with a woman not in the least worthy of his attention. I knew her; she was our host’s niece. At once I became suspicious of the reason we had been invited.
To this pronouncement Edwin immediately objected. He was the youngest of my cousins, just a few months older than me, a big, ruddy boy with the kind of cheeks women love to pinch. I never had to worry much about pinching, as my face was so thin. Women were more likely to urge me to eat something; those who were less polite generally thought I had a furtive, devious look and declared me a liar. For the most part, this was true; because so much about me seemed objectionable, I strove to conceal as much as possible, and learned to lie at an early age.
“I just wanted to say… to compliment you on your improvements to the script. I think it’s… very good.”
“I wouldn’t be asking if I didn’t. Tell me, please.” He looks a little desperate, she thinks. She remembers that look, before.
“Yes, of course. John was cast as Puck. But it was never released. Artistic differences, I gathered. Tedious lawsuits.”
the Sea of Trees, best known as the site of many suicides. He’d read about it when he was in his early teens. A very dense forest, grown out of igneous rock, it was said to be haunted. The eerie silence, due to the closeness of the trees and the sound-absorbing qualities of the hardened lava, was reportedly unnerving, and no doubt the origin of the folk-belief that ghosts lived there.
“Would you… want to see some more?” It isn’t the question he wants to ask, but he doesn’t know what that is yet, the question that will unlock John Watson for him, the question that will let him take this man out of this dismal bedsit and into a murder investigation, which is where he belongs. Sherlock is certain that he belongs there, but he isn’t sure how to ask.
“And have you solved it? The case…” His trembling hand fumbled for something, maybe his cane. The wheeled chair made it unnecessary, but the cane had been his friend for many years, and his hand still sought it. “Bees. You were studying something about bees.”
Sherlock turns and props himself on his elbow. John can see his silhouette in the darkness, looking down at him. “I would have been a drug addict. All the things we did after we left school made us who we are, people capable of loving each other. I’m not sure I would have been so intrigued when we met again if it had been a reunion of two old friends. It would have been tepid, both of us making polite promises to get together which we never would have kept. I think we did it exactly right. Implacable hatred into undying love.”
Doctor Gurung, the neurologist, shines a light in his eyes, watches them track a moving finger, asks him to say his name, the date, to hold up two fingers.
Angelo sets a plate of lasagna down in front of John. He takes a bite and suddenly feels ravenously hungry. For a while he eats in silence. Sherlock is not eating or drinking, but watches the street intently.
When it’s shallow enough, the swimmer touches bottom and begins to walk towards shore. He’s naked, Holmes notes, his skin gleaming like gold in the early light. As he wades out of the channel, water sluicing off of his body, he grins at Holmes.
And now they’re heading to a new Turkish restaurant that’s opened on the other side of the park. John will probably get the kebab combo, he thinks. They can share a mixed appetiser to try all the interesting dips with pita bread. He’ll tell John a funny story, and they’ll drink a bottle of retsina, and they’ll laugh about their first date, how it was so different from tonight.
He nodded. “I have conditions. Money is not my concern. We will build the consulting business back up, as you say.”
I tried to make my voice light. “If you recall, I did promise you a holiday some time ago, as a result of a small wager we had at Stamford’s wedding. I conceded, as you know, and if you will forgive the delay, we might spend some time abroad, as I promised you.”
It’s time to break his safe little routine, go out and meet some people. How that will happen, he’s not sure. But he’s certain he can’t be this careful, fearful person any more. Nor can he carry this anger around, looking for a target, letting it slowly poison him.
Sounds simple, but when you’re the one putting the pressure and the blood is flowing over your hands, nothing is simple.
“How do you reconstruct this, gentlemen?” I asked. “One pistol fired, a bullet in the holder’s neck, another in the ceiling.” I pointed out Milverton’s bullet, which they had overlooked.
He had torn open the letter and was smiling as he read. “Murray is getting married. We’ve been invited.”
“I am currently engaged to be married to the daughter of the King of Scandinavia. It is an excellent match which will resolve certain diplomatic issues between our countries. Miss Adler, however, possesses a somewhat suggestive photograph of the two of us and threatens to send it to the family of my fiancee. This family, one of the foremost in Europe, has very strict old-world principles. The photograph would bring to an end our engagement, which is to be announced three days hence. Miss Adler has promised to make the photograph public on that day.”
Harry is learning from her mistakes. John has never understood what his mistakes are, even in chemistry. But she is right, he can change, if he could just figure out how to do that.
and continue being angry. Or he might smile at Sherlock and offer to make tea. Denial and evasion are what he would expect. He needs another strategy.
In real life, Molly had had similar feelings for Sherlock, and he dealt with them no better than his character. Mostly he pretended he didn’t notice, and sometimes made remarks that made her draw away, looking sad and defeated.
Puzzles were the thread that connected everything he had loved. He speculated about a mouse corpse, what was going on inside that small body as it rotted. The tiny bones in a bird’s wing made him wonder about flight. He was curious about how bees talked to each other, and how spiders knew how to make webs. Everything that absorbed him presented him with puzzles to solve.
“I’m— thank you. What you did, erm, that was good. I’ll try to remember anything that can help you catch him.” Once again, he concentrates. He remembers someone, tall and thin, messy dark hair, light eyes. Sort of like Holmes, he thinks, only— “He wasn’t wearing a coat.”
Watson huffed and gave me an exasperated look. “And how do you deduce that? You haven’t even met the man!”
Anderson nodded. “But those only confirm the fact that he died; they don’t say why. And the interviews— it’s all speculation, isn’t it? People said how he was overwhelmed by fame, how his girlfriend dumped him, or how he dumped her, how he was a secret alcoholic, drug addict, sex addict, how he hated his mother, loved his mother, yada, yada. It’s just gossip. All those people capitalising on his death. What’s amazing is that there are people who actually
When I come out of the loo, I glance down the hall towards his bedroom. There is a light under the door. And I hear sounds— voices.
He’d sent the letter two weeks ago, but no reply had come. That might tell him everything he needed to know.
Though there were rumours that the next series would be the last, his contract had been renewed for two years, thanks to his cooperation with Molly’s little project, the reunion. She was calling it
Many of my clients are foolish, especially those young ladies who have been indiscreet, record those indiscretions in writing, and live to regret putting a postage stamp on said indiscretions and mailing them to another person.
Eventually Molly is a friend, not just an accomplice. With her, he doesn’t have to pretend he’s anything but what he is. It’s nice, having someone to talk to.
“Sherlock, I’m serious. Do not meddle with him. If you do, you will find yourself in trouble I cannot extricate you from.”
He loves this, he realises. Working alone is what he’s always done, impatiently growling at Lestrade to keep his team silent, to stop putting him off. But now he has a John Watson. John can be obtuse, distracting, stubborn, oblivious, but he has a way of clearing Sherlock’s mind, focusing his attention. It’s inexplicable, but with John beside him, Sherlock
He leans back on the sofa, closes his eyes, and giggles. “You arrogant prick. I think you’re drunk. And you aren’t even wearing a shirt.”
Mycroft knew about our father’s death, but all the time that he was gone had believed that I was being brought up by my aunt and uncle. In fact, he’d sent letters to me there, and was disappointed that I hadn’t written back. On his return he went to see them, hoping to find that I’d been sent to a good school and was preparing for university. His anger when he found I’d been abandoned at a charity school was justified, and he came at once to take me away.
His wallet is empty and his bank account doesn’t have enough to cover what looks like will be a very expensive meal. As a man, he has always picked up the tab on dates, but there was no discussion about who would pay when tonight was arranged. He assumes they will split the bill since neither of them did the asking. Even so, he won’t have enough to cover his own meal. That will be embarrassing.
John Watson is good-looking in a normal, non-threatening way. He doesn’t startle people or cause them to turn their heads in horror. He is compact and, in spite of illness and injury, retains the athleticism of a youth spent on the rugby fields. He has perfect posture, a result of military training, and an expressive face that hides little. He is the exact opposite of Sherlock, who is angular, odd, disconcerting, and conceals everything. People smile at John. Sherlock’s smile makes people apprehensive.
He wonders who would want to live with a man like Holmes. He’s clearly obsessed with things that are grimmer than what most people obsess about. He’s eccentric, arrogant, unpleasant. Odd, solitary. Does he have friends? People he hangs out with? What does a man like Holmes have?
Nor could he imagine John planning a disappearance so seamless that everyone would believe he’d actually died. The story of his suicide was melodramatic, a plot written by an adolescent mind, fed on television drama— so unrealistic, it might have been invented by Molly Hooper. Except that Molly would have written a happy ending.
“No, it’s not. You may think you don’t need to ask questions because you’re good at deducing people. But John isn’t a witness or a suspect. If you respect him, stop making assumptions and talk to him. Ask him what it means, tell him what you’re worried about. He loves you, Sherlock, but he can’t read your mind.”
“No. That was a surprise to us both, I think. After the case was solved, we came back to the flat, and… It just happened.”
“You don’t have an acting reputation to defend,” Sherlock pointed out. “What demands is Martha making?”
John comes along to crime scenes, pores over the evidence with him, discusses possibilities late into the night, and is always game for another chase. He’s a good doctor, has seen enough blood and gore that even the worst crime scenes don’t faze him. Sherlock tries to remember not to call him an idiot. Almost everyone is, but it’s not something you say to your colleague. Or flatmate.
Playing Diarrhoea Dude seemed like a good match for Rich Brook’s abilities, Sherlock decided. And he looked nothing like John Watson. He was taller, for one thing, and darker; the dyed hair did nothing to change his natural colouring. He would be outfitted in jeans and a shapeless jumper reminiscent of the ones Jason used to wear on the show. Irene said something about using contacts to lighten his eyes if they needed to do closeups. John’s were actually a dark blue, Sherlock remembered. But it wasn’t so much the hair or the eyes that made him so unlike John. He giggled and fidgeted and tried to ad lib his lines, and had no subtlety at all in his delivery. His face was like a mask, the same slightly manic smile plastered on with every line he spoke.
