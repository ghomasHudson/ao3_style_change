right now.”
“Okay, you are banned from the internet. Forever.”
Dean nodded, though didn’t look too convinced.
“From the Bunker?” Castiel asked, to which he got a ‘hmpf’ in response. From everything, Cas realized. He wanted to get away from it all.
“I didn’t drink any of this! Alright?” Dean sighed, frustrated. “I--I poured ‘em out.” he was looking resolutely at the sink again, refusing to look at Cas.
Dean grabs his keys from his room and heads towards Bunker doors. He’s the only sober one, surprisingly, and their ‘We Beat Chuck’ party was beginning to get low on booze. The last thing anyone  wanted was for a bunch of hunters, werewolves, and a Queen of Hell to start rioting over the lack of alcohol.
“And you should have had this antidote hours ago.” Cas finishes up the touches and hands the cup of putrid smelling liquid to Dean. “You should’ve told me about the Djinn attack earlier.”
~~~~~~~
“No, it’s. It’s not the hunting or lack of that was keeping me up. It’s that there are certain rules, okay?”
“Dean!” Sam calls out to him when Dean passes through the library.
“Just… Just pour that out for me, will ya? It’s the last one.”
The way his voice shook, the absolute agony in his eyes. The display makes Dean sick to his stomach. Dean should’ve done this ages ago, but it was shit like this that had held him back, made him question himself. Made him question everything.
Cas looked over his shoulder to the graveyard of liquor and shook his head, smiling up at Dean. “No,” he said. “He’ll understand.”
Cas’ raises a brow to say that yes he is serious, he’s
Dean gives in with an angry “Fine.” and a huff.
“Dean,” he starts slowly, taking a careful step forward. “Put down the gun.”
Castiel stops his subtle movements. Lowers his hands to his sides.
Dean huffed a laugh but followed obediently. Turning off the kitchen lights as he went.
He checked the bathrooms, the library, and it was on his way back to check the garage that he noticed there was someone in the kitchen. Quickly turning on the lights, Cas blinked his eyes until they adjusted and he could see Dean standing by the sink.
A voice in his head said
“Dean? Dean!” It’s Sammy. He continues to pound on the locked door, calling his brother's name. “Dean, what’s going on in there?! DEAN!”
Castiel gets into the car as well, and after a moment turns to look at Dean.
.” And now he was bringing out the waterworks. “
“It’s fine, Cas.” Dean waves a dismissive hand, before perking up a little. “Hey, grab some of that whiskey, will ya?”
“You know what they say about letting your dreams stay dreams.”
“Beer run.” Dean says hoarsely, then clears his throat “I’m going on a beer run.”
“Let ‘em.” Dean growls, mouthing at the skin he’s exposed. “I’ve waited too damn long for this. If they see something it’s their own friggin’ fault for lookin’.”
“So. It was like I told you. Chuck gone. Eileen and Sam were together. Jack was back.” Dean swallows. Looks to Cas. Looks away. “And that was basically it. Just a, ya know, nice, homey, hunter existence. Not too over the top. Djinn did a good job. Probably why it trapped me for so long.”
Dean looked up at Castiel, betrayed, stricken, “What?” his gruff voice shook.
“I just--” Dean cut himself off. His voice sounded awful. Had he been crying?
Castiel stands in front of Dean, hands up in a non-threatening gesture, eyes wide with fear.
“O-kay.” Dean swallows nervously. A talk? That was normal too. Right? They had talks. Lots of talks. So why did Dean feel like all the air had just been sucked out of the Impala.
Dean grabs the whiskey with the same enthusiasm as a kid snatching a bag of candy.
Cas looked at the bottle in his hand, then back up to Dean. “No.”
Dean looked up at the ceiling, taking a deep breath.
“You don’t have to do that, Cas.” Dean protests for the tenth time.
“So everything’s good now?” Dean asks gruffly.
“It’s the least I can do--literally, seeing as I can’t heal you at the moment.”
Dean’s face contorts in rage as he approaches the weakened thing.
Dean clenches his teeth together. He feels dirty at having had this thing running around in his mind, learning all his greatest desires, using them against him.
Dean reaches up to put Baby in drive, but Castiel stops him with a hand over Dean’s. Dean looks down at Cas’ hand, then up to his face in alarm. This was… probably normal. The touch had Dean feeling all kinds of ways, but it was definitely just a platonic hand touch. This was fine. Dean wasn’t a freakin’ Vulcan or anything.. ‘
It was rare, and therefore alarming, for Cas to wake up without Dean being right there. The fact that the neon green lights of the alarm clock telling him it was only three in the morning had the ex-angel up and out of bed in a heartbeat, panic causing that beat to grow faster and faster.
"Remind me when we get home to call Rowena and tell her what happened." Dean rubbed his face tiredly before slamming the passenger door shut. "She's gotta keep her subjects in line."
"Yeah, all I'd have to do is shake a shifter's hand and they'd sizzle," Dean gasped. Could he punch a ghost with this thing?
me: it's one meal, how long can it take? 30 minutes? better add some general conversation with vague durations just in case i get it wrong. now the reader can decide.
Dean half tuned out of the conversation. Mostly, his attention was on his food and the occasional brush of Cas's knee against his. He fidgeted with his new ring below the table to keep his hands busy; all they wanted to do was reach out to Cas and pull him close.
Cas opened his eyes and looked up at Dean, more alert now. "I do. Let's go." Dean's eyebrows climbed up his forehead as Cas stood up and started to pull him to his room by the hand.
“Thank you for calling Gabriel,” Cas said after a moment of contentedly gazing at Dean.
Dean ducked his head. His cheeks felt a little wet, and he couldn't lift his eyes to meet Cas's, but he clung to Cas's hand like a lifeline. With his other arm, he pulled Cas into a brisk hug (he didn't trust himself not to bawl if he held on any longer), a shaky "Thank you," whispered into his neck.
“Hey, Cas?” He began cautiously, not wanting to be offensive. “Why’re you the only one here?”
“So, Sydney had basically the same story as Kevin. Struck by lightning, fine, then suddenly able to read Enochian,” Dean said between bites.
“These signs have appeared before. Back when God left Heaven, he created one more angel. With this angel came the list of prophets. It was so even with God gone, someone would be able to read His words.”
Dean’s aim was unrivaled. He easily claimed the prize of a giant stuffed bumblebee, much to Rock Paper Scissors guy’s dismay. Sam went to nudge his brother about it, but Dean was already walking towards the dark-haired man. Sam watched in awe as he smiled and handed the guy the bee. His face lit up, and his eyes followed Dean strolling back over to Sam.
"Though he did have some help," Eileen added.
“How many visitors?” Dean tried to keep his tone casual.
“People are gay, Dean. Now would you let me continue please?” Dean tried not to smile and rolled his eyes instead. “Her wife said this woman had been hearing voices and ignoring everyday obligations, saying they ‘weren’t important anymore’. A few hours later, her wife reported her missing. Then three people with no relation turned up dead with their eyes burned out.”
Sam needed to help the men sort themselves out. Maybe Syd and Claire could be a good influence on them…
Cas straightened. “No, I believe trouble has just arrived at both houses.”
"Those two giraffes were complaining about how slippery the ground gets after it snows," Cas relayed. "They wish that their caretakers would put more effort into shoveling their enclosure."
Dean went over to his bag. He pulled out the angel blades and holy oil, as well as a couple lighters. Soon, they were off.
“Is this about the lightning incident?” The mother asked nervously. “We already talked to the police.”
There's a lot of foul language
"All out of juice? Jack can't whip up a new batch for you with his new God powers?" He huffed a nervous laugh, like it would dull the pain at all.
"Holy shit," he whispered. His heart had dropped to somewhere near the Earth's core and taken most of his voice with it. "I— you… fuck."
“I’d say split up.”
“Yes. Here,” Castiel grabbed Dean’s hand. “Let me show you.”
The light faded and Cas collapsed on top of Dean, who struggled to hold him up. It was extra difficult because Cas’s giant wings now fell to either side of him. They were battered and bloody, but at least Cas was still breathing.
"Light sleeper," Dean muttered.
"What's this all about, anyway?" Dean asked, setting down the menu and letting his curiosity get the better of him. "You've never done anything for holidays. It's just another birthday, no different from last year or the year before."
Sam didn't believe him in the slightest, but he could see that Dean was, in fact, denying his feelings for Cas. As far as Sam could tell, Cas just didn't know what to do with the emotions, so he ignored them completely.
Something started beeping rapidly. “It’s too late for that,” Dean fastened his parachute. “It’s gonna blow; I gotta get out.” He slipped on his mask, closed his eyes, and ejected.
remember when we could actually go places? and see people?? without worrying for our safety in crowds??? that was wild, dude.
Sighing in relief, Dean said, "Good. Sounds good. Let's do that. When we talk about the other thing." Fucking words, why do they never work right?
Cas looked back at him. "I believe I've found reason to savor small moments instead of letting them pass me by. You make me want to spend eternity watching steam curl above my coffee, or frost creeping across the Impala's exterior. You, Sam, and Jack all give me greater strength than the grace of a thousand angels ever could. Even my connections with Eileen and everyone else I've met on earth help me get through difficult days in hopes of better ones. And you, Dean — a supernova could never hope to compare to the light your soul emits. Your compassionate heart knows no bounds, and I'm eternally grateful to have met you."
“A child with a mystery origin, unharmed by lightning…” Cas trailed off, deep in thought.
Dessert (pie, of course) came and went without a hitch. Dean got Cas a small slice to try, which he ate without comment. There was a point where Dean wordlessly wiped some whipped cream off Cas's cheek with a napkin, but that could be played off as platonic, right? If Sam thought anything was off, he kept it to himself.
Dean was no help unpacking. He passed out on his bed right away. Sam made a mental note to prevent him from getting too bad a hangover next time. Once everything was spread out across the room in an orderly fashion, Sam fell asleep.
Dean nodded, frowning in agreement. “He’s got the mojo.” He stood. “I’ll go call him.”
“I didn’t see what was wrong with it, but Grandmother was quite alarmed. She even notified the police, and the news reporters got wind of it.” She tilted her head downwards. Sam furrowed his brow. Claire offered him a cookie, which was strange, but he took it.
“Not yet, but a new prophet and angel will probably draw a lot of attention. We need to stay here to keep whatever they attract away.”
With a start, Dean realized there was a person standing a few feet away from him. He scrambled to his feet and sized up the stranger in a defensive stance. The man had strikingly blue eyes, which were squinting against the sun, and windblown black hair. He wore nothing but an off-white woven cloth draped over one shoulder and around his waist. It was strangely pristine, considering this man looked tan enough to have been on this beach for hours.
Dean nodded and pat Cas on the shoulder. There was an attempt.
The words hit Dean like a train.
Cas rolled his eyes good naturedly. "You're insufferable."
“You have no idea,” Cas said wistfully, gazing out the window. Dean was starting to remember that old myth.
The demons watching over the Righteous Man were no fools. They moved him around Hell to fend off anyone trying to get a taste of the fabled Apocalypse's harbinger. Castiel hoped to reach him while they were still near the surface, where the barrier between Hell and Earth would be the easiest and quickest to break through with his charge in hand, but he had no such luck. Alastair and his lackeys dragged the Righteous Man deeper and deeper into Hell, aiming to lose the feeble little angel in the crowd. Despite the demons' best efforts, Castiel never broke the connection, even when the light was reduced to no more than a pinprick amidst a sea of horror.
Once they got out of the rocky carriage and deposited the vomit bag, Sam and Dean decided to play some prize games. The first one they chose was an “obviously rigged” ball toss, which Dean wasted thirty dollars on. They finally moved on when Sam noticed a giant line of third graders behind them.
“One day you’re gonna tell me what happened, because it changed you.”
Cas decided that this would be a great time for Claire to learn another angel skill: healing. Claire tensed a little when she saw her hand glowing, but she relaxed after watching Syd’s wound repair itself.
Holding himself back from casually touching Cas was even harder now that Dean knew his hand wouldn't be slapped away. There used to always be something to do, some goal to accomplish, some time constraint that kept Dean from gravitating towards Cas, along with the crippling uncertainty of whether or not Cas felt a pull to him as well. Now, it was like a dam had broken, and Dean had to physically restrain himself from clinging to Cas 24/7. For once, it was harder to stay away from Cas than it was to reach out and grab on with both hands, and that scared the hell out of him.
“Obviously.”
They pulled up to the warehouse on a dirt road. There was no sign of anyone there, but Dean suspected that Cas could sense grace. He looked back at the Winchesters and motioned to the door.
Dean accepted Syd’s mother’s offer of coffee and left his number with them. He then drove to the meet up point and bought a motel room to wait in.
"Well, today is a special day," Cas said pointedly.
“Sorry you had to see me like that.” Cas’s wings were now only half-visible, kind of like a hologram. They folded behind Cas involuntarily, as if trying to be as small as possible.
Cas was still fighting the first angel. Neither could land a hit until Dean entered the fray. He stabbed the enemy in the stomach. It wasn’t fatal, so they had time to open their shirt and reveal a complicated burn mark on their chest, almost like the banishing symbol.
Claire shuddered and said, “There was a man outside.” The brothers stepped closer to hear her as she continued. “He lit a match and threw it in the window.”
Dean smiled sadly. “Maybe your ‘curse’ applies to both sides.”
They made their way down to the beach, Dean admiring the gorgeous garden. As they reached the shore, where a small raft had appeared seemingly on its own, the two men faced each other. Dean was trying to memorize every detail of Cas’s face when he was pulled in by the collar for one last kiss.
Dean was used to late-night hookups, their kisses filled with lust and absolutely nothing else. But this was different. This was rare. This, he realized, was love.
Castiel gazed at the horizon thoughtfully. “Time is difficult here. I’d say perhaps two days.”
Sam, Dean, and Cas meet up to discuss their findings. Meanwhile, something is trying to hunt down Sydney and Claire.
Syd crossed her arms, but flopped onto the bed nonetheless. Dean turned to the table, where Cas was having much more luck with Claire. They were standing close together, like Cas sometimes did when he wasn't reminded about personal space. Must be an angel thing.
“Whoa!”
The enemy angels seemed disinterested in Dean. They tried to grab Cas, but he slashed their arms with his angel blade. Dean stabbed one in the back while their attention was on Cas. Their eyes lit up, then they crumbled to the ground.
Dean felt his throat close up a little bit. "Yeah," he choked out, "Yeah, that's an awesome idea. Maybe then it'll feel more like ours. Thank you, Cas. Let's go see what that one with the steering wheel on the door was called…"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, it can't be a prophet. I mean, Metatron flipped the ‘off’ switch when he closed Heaven, right?”
Cas squeezed back in response. "Promise."
She nodded. “I was outside a large building, and I noticed a wire running down the side. I did not know what its purpose was, so I reached out to touch it. I didn’t know I would receive an intense shock upon contact. I learned later that it was connected to a pole designed to draw lightning. Anyway, after that, I walked home.”
“Shut up.” Sam grinned even wider, like every other time his brother can’t come up with a comeback. He parked the car and got out.
“Yeah,” A strange look crossed her face. “But you don’t think they’re related, do you?”
He tried to walk out of the room as quietly as possible, but one of the tapestries (a young woman with bright red hair) loudly bid him a good morning. Cas blinked awake, though did not look surprised.
"That's something I wanted to talk to you about, at our next stop."
“Gabriel?” Sam suggested.
Dean made a split-second decision and grabbed Cas’s hand. He stroked it with his thumb, trying to calm Cas down. He hoped Sam wasn’t looking at them.
Dean punched his brother in the arm. “That was one time.”
"What do you mean your ab— never mind." They both stood up. Dean slowed his pace to avoid drawing attention. "Let's get our jackets and tail her until she's not around a bunch of people. We should try to avoid killing her meat suit; a body will not be easy to take care of in the middle of the city."
Sam cleared his throat. “So… Do you think it’s angels?”
A small sob escaped his mouth. Dean closed his eyes, overwhelmed by emotion. It was perfect, of course it was perfect. A reminder to carry with him everywhere, through the good days and the bad. A reminder of the good in his life, of Sam, of Jack, and, most predominantly, of Cas. For lack of any way to respond other than crying his eyes out, Dean returned the ring to its rightful place and laced his fingers with Cas's.
“One angel had this weird symbol burned into their skin,” Dean explained breathlessly after Sam had rushed over. “They stabbed themselves and exploded. Cas’s wings appeared and wrapped around me like a cocoon. I’m totally fine, but now he’s unconscious.”
"Ah..." said Castiel, wanting to satisfy Dean with his answer. He didn't really have a clue about the things he was saying, but for his own good, he preferred to nod than end up like Sam. He wasn't going to be murdered right after great sex.
"Perhaps..."
"Believe it, there's nothing to it." Dean exchanged glances with Charlie. He tried to convey more to her through it than he was able to. However, a certain message got through to her: he wasn't the least bit happy about his brother's plans. Looking at the man, he knew that he was prepared to do anything to thwart his plans. The verdicts of heaven had come down. Castiel had to stay alive. He didn't know why, he didn't know for how long, or if he was going to be useful in the future, but he was going to keep him alive. No matter at what cost.
"Silly," Cas muttered, but kissed Dean. Passionately.
"Whatever you plan," he replied, shrugging his shoulders. After a while he bounced off the wall and stood a metre behind his brother. Although he was afraid and had doubts, he looked for support in himself. He told himself that everything would be fine. He would not be haunted by dreams and frightening looks. He believed in his gods and in their will. If they thought Castiel was worthy of committing murder, he wasn't going to back down. The dagger he turned in his hand was going to be used. Sam's blood would coat the blade and become a sign of loyalty to his Lord.
"He has beautiful eyes... I have seen them many times before. I don't want to know that they will stop shining tonight."
"So his name is Castiel!" she whispered, looking intently at the man. He nodded in reply and then gave her a small smile. "I'm Charlie and this is Dean. It is a pleasure to meet you."
Charlie held a sight-impaired dog in her lap, which by some miracle was still alive. Her pale hands combed the animal's back. The woman looked ahead and tried to soak up the view of the red sky. This was her time to relax. She had returned from the city an hour ago. She made sure Bobby took his medication, gave the dog a water, and cleaned up the entire floor. After spending the day at work, she enjoyed the relaxation immensely, where many people might not have seen something special. Charlie sat in a rocking chair on the porch. Her feet rested on the old, dilapidated floor. She rocked while simultaneously tending to the animal that belonged to the family.
Castiel closed the door behind him and went back up to Jack’s room, who was back to looking morose. He sat down next to him after plucking a book off his bookshelf, handing it to Jack.
"I recently sustained an injury and they didn't wish to help me because all I was was a burden to them and besides, all that time could be spent travelling. So they left me to die. I came across a man who nursed me to health. He was a good, kind man but I was an invalid and I couldn't in good conscience continue to impose on him any longer than I had. So I said my goodbyes and I've been travelling ever since. I don't know what really drew me to this place. But it was not like I had anywhere else to be and I was desperately hungry and tired so I figured, why not? And here I am," Castiel finished, spreading his arms somewhat awkwardly.
And look.
Dean hesitantly reached out and touched it, thinking it to be dead but the moment he made contact with it, the bird let out a weak, pitiful sound. Dean got down on his knees and looked more closely. In the dim moonlight, he could just about make out that its wing was bent at an unnatural angle, the feathers torn and ruffled.
And the beginnings of something, something strangely like undying faith, bloomed between them.
When he’d gone to open the door, widely beaming, Castiel had expected animated children. Instead, his smile grew impossibly wider as he took in the sight of his best friend, dark blonde hair, windswept, green eyes shining like emeralds. He was smirking mischievously and it made butterflies flutter in Castiel’s stomach. He took in the sight of Dean who was dressed in a loose white shirt and tight leather pants, complete with his favourite brown leather jacket, a Stetson perched on his head and a whip on his waist. Distantly, Castiel thought of some adventure movies that Dean had made him watch months ago but his contemplation was forgotten when faced by how absolutely ravishing Dean looked. His thoughts had just begun wandering into dangerous territory, his skin tingling, when Dean’s voice jolted him out of his reverie.
"Cas-tee... That's a mouthful. I think I'll just call you Cas. I'm Dean."
The swan slowly began to heal. It ate more, moved around and even allowed Dean to apply some healing paste to its wings. Its eyes began growing brighter and the lustre had begun returning to its beautiful black feathers. Some days, it made weak attempts to fly, and Dean was always there to catch it and soothe it.
Dean’s efforts paid off. He was beginning to understand Enochian and he made good progress. It was mostly limited to spells, initially, some of which Dean was pretty sure they’d come across before. Most of the books were about magic and even though Dean was sure he was on the right track, he still didn’t know how he would pick up on the stuff Castiel said, the slang he used. At least, that’s what Dean thought it was. So he dug deeper, hoarding more books until he came across a few very old ones, hidden in a heavily warded wooden box in an obscure corner of the library.
“Dean.” Castiel said warningly. As it is, he was having a tough time resisting Jack’s puppy dog eyes. He was not sure he could handle Dean’s thrown into the mix as well.
They looked.
And looked.
Dean blinked, and in an instant it was Cas standing in front of him instead of the swan, tears brimming in his eyes and running down his cheeks.
Dean had imagined kissing the angel more times than he cared to count. He thought that it was most likely to happen after a hunt, maybe after they’d almost lost each other for the umpteenth time. Maybe it would happen after they’d had one of their legendary arguments. But this, he’d never expected it to go down like this. It was the most perfect feeling in the universe. It was like they were meant to fit together this way. Dean never wanted to let go.
“Well, that’s fine once in a while. But you do know you can’t adopt Dean’s eating habits right?”
The matching smiles on both their faces were blindingly radiant and Castiel found himself smiling along with them. Dean got up from Jack’s bed, ruffling his hair and promising to be back with enough candy to last him a lifetime. The mock glare that he earned from Castiel on saying that only made him chuckle and the warmth and happiness in Castiel’s heart grow. As Castiel walked him out, they fell into a familiar teasing banter.
Jack smiled as he put down the book and Castiel moved the chair to sit beside his bed. They spent the next few minutes in companionable silence, punctuated only by Jack’s feeble but satisfied sighs as Castiel spoon fed the soup to his son.
All it took was a moment.
Dean didn't know what to say. He simply stared at Castiel, whose blue eyes seemed to glow orange in the firelight. Before he could talk himself out of it, he reached out and patted Castiel's arm.
Everything changed when a stranger showed up at his door one day.
In time, Dean made a friend of the swan. He would come back home and talk about his day while the swan listened as they ate. On particularly bad days, days when Dean was starving, or feared that he'd lose his job, the swan waddled up and nuzzled against his neck. It would let Dean pet him as his worries slowly drained away. Both of them were lonely, and both of them sought comfort in the other.
He pressed his lips against Dean, gently first and then they grew frantic, clutching at each other desperately, everything else forgotten. And that is how one of the more spiteful maids found them and snitched on them. They were kicked out of the mansion and Dean didn't get paid that day but he couldn't find it in himself to care. Cas was worth it, and more.
Even as they spoke with their words, so did their eyes, without any.
“Batman, huh?” Dean smiled. “Good choice, buddy!”
Every night, Dean sat with Cas as he transformed into a swan and weaved. They simply basked in each other's company while they could.
“You’re not really going to go trick or treating, are you?”Castiel asked.
With great reluctance, Dean pulled himself out of his bed and dragged himself to the door, teeth chattering because of the cold. He had a scowl on his face and a few choice curses on his tongue as he flung open the door. The words all died in his mouth when he took in the sight of the man standing in front of him. The first thing Dean noticed was
He woke up with Cas in his arms. For a few moments, the only thing he felt was happiness and crushing relief, as he cuddled his husband and pressed a kiss to his messy hair. And then he reached out for Cas' cheek. It was cold to the touch. His beautiful blue eyes stared vacantly into empty space. Dean felt nauseous.
And look.
All it takes is a moment.
And when Castiel saw Dean’s soul settle in peace, he couldn’t stop the warmth that spread through him.
“What?” Sam said, looking suspiciously innocent. “I didn’t sleep well last night.”
“Aww c’mon, Cas! The kid needs his Halloween candy fix, doesn’t he?” Dean’s eyes grew wider and there was a little pout on his lips.
Two weeks had gone by. Dean suddenly woke up in the middle of the night, alone. The first thing he heard was the sound of the damned loom. Anger and worry coursed through him. He got out of bed, determined to get Cas to sleep at any cost. He padded barefoot across the room and flung the door open, profanities ready at the tip of his tongue.
"I mean, I just thought that since you're not really going anywhere in particular it would be wise of you to settle somewhere cause man, your lifestyle is hella unhealthy and risky and it's not like we ain't got jobs here, I mean, we've got plenty of ways to earn some money and there must be
Early next morning, he went out to buy another box of donuts for Cas. Ever since he’d gotten to know about the deal with the Empty and realised just how unhappy Cas really was, he hated seeing his best friend upset. Dean had vowed he’d do whatever it took to make Cas happy. And if he had to get up early to surprise Cas with donuts, then so be it. When he walked into the kitchen and saw it empty, he simply grabbed one of Cas’ sticky notes and stuck it to the box after writing his name on it. Knowing he had the entire day to himself with nothing to do, he headed to the library to get started with Enochian.
And looked.
“I will kill you,” he murmured as we walked past Sam. “
Ever since he’d moved into the bunker, Dean had decided that he absolutely had to make Cas eat whatever he made. That was, of course, before Cas decided to take over the cooking duties and kick Dean out of the kitchen. But a few days had been enough to discover that Cas could be a worse glutton than Dean when he wanted to. There were the burgers, of course. Dean had already known that. But nothing,
Cas repeated these words, and others that Dean didn’t understand, over and over again, till he felt Dean’s heartbeat slow down. He caressed the hunter’s hand one last time before he got up to leave.
safe and happy. Their faces break out into wide smiles and in that moment, nothing in the world seems impossible to achieve.
Dean stares at Cas for a moment, dumbstruck, before shouting, “Dude, what the hell?!”
“When I stopped you, you were talking about… us.” Castiel prompts carefully.
“I had made a deal with The Empty--”
After they parted, Dean looked over at the alcoholic carnage and winced. “Sam’s gonna be pissed.”
“Seriously?”
Every single bottle was empty, save for the bottle of Jack Daniel’s Dean held in his hand.
’, and as usual, when that voice said those magic words, Dean tended to just roll with the changes and ‘do the thing’. He takes a deep breath, then turns to give Cas a steady look.
“Can do that too,” he murmured against Cas’ lips.
“Cas!”
“I’ve got him.” she assures, and then smiles. “But maybe Sam is right. You should call Castiel.”
“I’m only supposed to use it after a hunt, to celebrate, or ‘cause I’m all beat up, or to keep me going another day because everything’s going to shit and I have to keep going. But… but now everything’s nice. Everything’s fucking perfect. The world isn’t ending. Sam’s safe and happy. So is Jack. Hell, I even had a frickin’ Angel underneath me and all I could--”  Dean bit his lips, shaking his head again like he was fighting with himself, “I was laying there wide awake, thinking about the bottle of Jack in the kitchen cupboard. The one I hid behind the Lucky Charms  so Sam would keep his damn hands off it.”
“...A road trip?”
Cas smiled into the kiss, not minding the salt taste of left-over tears.
The bastards must have taken him. But why leave Dean behind?
“Where’s Cas?”
“Umm, Dean?” he questions. “Are we going, or…?”
“He was alive in your dream?” Castiel asks. He doesn’t seem upset. Simply curious. Maybe a bit jealous.
“I think we should… talk.”
“Where’re you goin’?” he asks eloquently.
Hadn’t the guy shot him down just a few weeks ago? And now he was...What? Dean had no idea.
“There’s something that you’re leaving out.”
“Yeah?” Dean asks, sounding hoarse.
” Dean glowers at Castiel for a moment, who looks rightfully chastised, before asking, “What kind of deal.”
“Then what is it like? Dean, you can’t drink this much, it’s insane--!”
Dean feels his stomach drop, his hands dropping from the steering wheel as well, causing Cas’ hand to fall away.
“Real subtle, Sam..” Eileen quips.
“Maybe you should call him.” Sam suggests, poking Dean in the chest with his free hand. “An’ then you could go on th’ beer run together?” he smiles happily at Dean once he’d finished slurring his words at him.
“You’re one twisted son of a bitch, you know that?” Dean growls at the injured Djinn, raising his shotgun. It’s no dagger dipped in lambs blood, but he knows from experience that enough shots to the head will wipe him out just as easy.
Dean wakes with a sharp gasp. He’s laying on his side in some field, everything around him tinted with a washed out grey. Even the Leviathan corpse a few feet in front of him.
“Beer run. Be back in a few.”
“Stay back,
Castiel laughs, and Dean can’t help himself from leaning back into Cas’ space, pressing his lips against the grinning corner of Cas’ mouth, and down his jaw.
“Why is Sammy here, Cas?” Dean asks over the sound of the continued banging and pleading of his brother.
Dean cocks the trigger, pressing the barrel more firmly against his temple.
Castiel laughs, leaning his head back against the window with a dull thunk.
~The End~
Dean was laughing now, pulling back so Castiel could see the beautiful relief of it.
Castiel chuckles, “Not a big Aerosmith fan?”
“I--” Cas starts, then gets a defiant look in his eye. “I asked you first.”
Castiel raised a brow and waited for an answer.
There were bottles lining the counters next to the sink. Beer, whiskey, vodka, every bottle of liquor that they had in the entirety of the Bunker, it seemed like. Even the very expensive top-shelf scotch Dean had won from Garth in a poker game a year ago.
There was a moment of silence, invaded by the smell of alcohol. It lasted until Castiel couldn’t stand it any longer. He moved, grabbing Dean and pulling him close, pulling him into a hug. The old Hunter went willing, gratefully, and buried his face in the side of Castiel’s neck, holding onto him tightly.
“Yes.” Castiel sighs. “Everything has been settled. Like I said.”
Cas huffs a laugh, “Yeah.”
“Where do you want to go?”
’ he had time to think before Sam walks in, stricken face telling Dean that his brother needed him to stop his own moping and be a shoulder to lament on right now. Dean could do that. And gladly did. Anything to get him to stop thinking about how badly he just fucked up.
“But how could he have known? You haven’t had the chance to text him. I sure as hell didn’t. No one’s been yelling or making a ruckus.” Dean tilts his head to the side, “So how could he have known?”
“Drop it, Cas. It doesn’t matter.” Dean sniffs and tries to put on a bored face. “Listen, are we going or not. Got a lot of thirsty people back there--”
“A soul for a soul. Jack get’s to stay out of The Empty, and then the moment I was ‘Truly at happy and at peace’ the Empty would come to collect me.”
Okay.
“What?” Sam looks back at Eileen, distraught. And then poorly stage whispers, “Really?”
This was one of those moments that made Dean still wonder if Chuck was still writing the script. Or maybe Becky this time. Hell, maybe even Sam and Elieen.
“May I join you?”
Dean could feel himself start to blush, so quickly gave a line about ‘that being his que to leave’ and booked it for the safe confines of Baby.
“Say what?”
“Dean.” Castiel admonishes as the Hunter starts loosening Castiel’s tie and working the buttons open on his shirt. “Anyone could walk by and see us.”
“He would’ve enjoyed that.” Castiel smiles.
“Dean?” he asked, coming up to stand by the other man, “Are you alright? What are you…”
Dean could feel his heart pounding in his ears, and his whole body heat up suddenly like he’d just been tossed into an oven. Cas was looking at him with what seemed like… hope?
“What is it?” Castiel asks, amused and now with a smile to echo Dean’s, though he doesn’t know what they are smiling about.
Or two….
Dean’s brows dips down in confusion, and suspicion.
Cas looked at the bottle, and without hesitation opened it up and began to pour. He willed the amber liquid to flow out of the bottle quicker, as each glug seemed to cause Dean some form of pain.
“Like father like son,” Dean let out a pathetic, wet laugh. The red rims around his eyes now explained as fresh tears came to track over where the previous waterworks had already made a path. It was only now Castiel realized Dean was drunk.
There was a pause, Dean’s whole body looked frozen in shock before Castiel watched him nod jerkily. Like it was difficult to acknowledge, even in movements rather than words. Like he was ashamed.
“Why?” he asks apprehensively.
, together.”
’ Dean’s inner voice screams at him hysterically.
Dean halts his stride and waits for Castiel to catch up to him.
“Okay.” he says decisively, deciding now would be a good time to actually, you know, drive and all.
Sam stumbles over to stand in front of Dean, putting a hand on his brother's shoulder to balance himself.
There’s a moment of floating in darkness. Dean feels as if he’s waking up from a dream, put stuck in sleep paralysis, unable to open his eyes. He has time to think, to worry. Had he managed to pull the trigger? Or had Cas taken him out first, and that loud noise he heard was nothing more than Sam breaking through the door.
“It was to save Jack’s life, and I’ve already taken care of it. In fact, that’s why I was late to the party.”
“I frickin’ love it. I… I need it.”
“Yeah, except everything seemed to have worked out for us, ya know? No chuck. Sam and Eileen weren’t,” Dean nods his head towards the direction of the war-room, in which he was pretty sure poor Sammy was getting dumped. Dean felt bad for the kid, but didn’t blame Eileen in the slightest either. He understood how she felt. Hell, he’d been struggling with the same maddening question of ‘am I just doing something because I was scripted to’ right along with her. “And Jack was…” Dean looks up to judge Cas’ reaction at the mention of Jack.
“It’s fine.” Dean assures. “Plus, it’s the only thing that can wash this taste out.”
“You... what?” Castiel was beyond confused. Dean would never waste alcohol, even if he knew the finishing off what was left would make him sick. “Why?”
“Actually, maybe it’s best I say this before we’re on the road.” Castiel explains himself. But still doesn’t remove his hand.
“Rules?”
“You’re… an alcoholic.”
“I can’t--” Dean tried again, before shaking his head and handing Cas the bottle. “You do it,” he said flatly.
While Castiel waited for a reply, he felt dampness against his skin. Dean was crying again. Castiel held him tighter. “Dean?”
“Wanna get away,” Dean finally responded.
One: He’d be trapped in The Empty forever, forced into a dreamless sleep, alone in the dark.
For a moment Dean looked like he was about to cry again, but instead, he leaned forward and captured Castiel’s lips in a kiss.
“What?” Dean looks up from where he’d zoned out on the steering wheel to Cas’ amused face. “Oh! Right.” Dean blushes and fumbles with his keys as he starts the car.
“You know,” Cas continued, “I never did get to see the second-largest ball of twine in the US. Always wanted to.”
A sudden loud banging on the door to his room has Dean flinch, but he still keeps his guard up.
“Dean,” Castiel says slowly, looking like the word was painful for him to say. He looks up at Hunter with pleading eyes. “Perhaps--” he stops himself, clenching his jaw and looking down at the table, lips working as if they didn’t want to say what he was gonna say, and yet Cas was determined to force them into forming words anyway, “Maybe now isn’t the best time.” he forces out.
“No thanks. I’d rather have the real thing.” Dean raises his shotgun to shoot the bastard, but stops at the Djinn’s sudden laughter.
“I’m sorry about the ‘mixed signals’. They aren’t really mixed. I mean, I’m not mixing them on purpose.” Castiel draws a hand over his face, obviously struggling as much as Dean had been. Good. “I do like you, Dean.” Castiel says, almost shyly but still with conviction. “In fact what I feel for you has long since passed ‘like’.” Castiel swallows and looks up at Dean.
A sudden rustling sound catches Dean’s attention, and he turns towards it, shotgun raised amd at the ready. A few yards off Dean sees a figure moving on the ground, obviously struggling, in pain.
“Doesn’ matter.”
Well, Dean figured one of two things was going to happen.
“Dean.”
“Really?” Castiel quirks a brow.
.” Dean growls.
“What?”
Once he was out of the Bunker, walking across the gravel to where he’d parked the Impala, a voice calls out to him. Dean turns to see Castiel standing near his pimpmobile, as if he’d just arrived.
“Deal.” Dean leans in and kisses Castiel.
serious.
“It means I made a deal, which made it necessary you didn’t say what I think you were going to say.”
“Maybe you should stop being attacked by Djinn if you hate the taste so much.” Castiel says, grabbing the cup from where Dean had sat it on the table. He’s halfway to the sink before he stops, sighing and setting the cup down on the metal island instead, and turning back to face Dean.
Castiel hesitates, unable to think up a lie.
“NO!” Cas shouts, lunging at Dean. Lunging at him with an Angel Blade in hand.
“He’s worried about you, Dean. We both are. Please, just put down the--”
“Where are you going?” Castiel looks back to the Bunker and at the plethora of cars still parked around it. It was obvious a party still rolled on inside.
“No…”
“I’m sorry, that was uncalled for. I’m the one who left you there, unprotected. My one concern was getting the leviathan away from you, I didn’t consider--”
Dean keeps his glare aimed on Cas, but then he smiles, causing a wary look to come over Cas’ face.
“S’not your fault,” Dean said, muffled against Castiel’s skin. “S’mine.”
“We could kiss now, and then you could yell at me about being an idiot later?”
Sleep hadn’t come easy to him, this round of being --almost but not quite-- human. It’d taken a lot of trial and error before they’d discovered all Cas really needed was to be under about 190 pounds of Hunter like a comfy human blanket. Dean seemed to like the arrangement too.
“You never got to finish telling me about your dream.”
“Necessary?” Dean scrunches his face up in anger and confusion. “What the hell are you talking about ‘necessary.”
“Yeah that’s what I thought.” Dean takes a deep breath, muscles tensing to pull the trigger.
Cas shrugged his mouth and shoulder, ”Anywhere.” he said. “As long as it’s with you, we can make it up as we go.”
“Cas--”
“Yeah, maybe you’re right.” he says, lowering his shotgun with a smirk that doesn’t reach his eyes.  The Djinn looks hopeful for a moment. Until Dean drops the smile. “But I haven’t given up on reality. Not yet.” Dean pulls out his pistol instead. The Djinn only has a moment to look afraid before Dean fills his skull with bullets.
“Cas, actually, there’s, uh, something else that happened in the dream, and, uh,” Dean chuckles nervously. “Well, you were in it, obviously. And you even lived here at the Bunker. I mean Jack was here, so you being here made sense. But also--” Dean loses his breath, looks up at Cas, hopefully for some reassurance or something. Dean’s pretty sure they’d been flirting around this thing for a while now. He was pretty sure he wasn’t stepping over any lines here.
They kiss for a moment before Dean begins to smile, so much so that it’s interrupting their kiss.
“Yeah. He was.” Dean sniffs and takes another, larger drink.”Had him enrolled in school for some reason.” Dean huffs a laugh.
Castiel had heard of this before. There were people in the homeless shelter he’d briefly visited during his first stint at being human, people who had talked about their struggles with alcohol in a similar way, and how difficult it was not to drink, as per the shelter’s rules.
“Dean--”
“Alright sasquatch. Go sit down before you fall down and kill somebody.” Dean helps a pouting Sam back over to the table before turning to Eileen. “You got him?”
“You’ve already taken care of it?” Dean asks in disbelief. “What kind of deal was it?”
“Dean?” Castiel’s voice shook but he didn’t have enough care left over to mind.
“In the dream we were together. Like, together together. Hallmark movie,
“I’m sure I can find something if you need--”
Dean ignored Castiel as if he hadn’t spoken, and kept staring into the sink’s drain as if he were about to be sick. Had he...no. There’s no way he could’ve...Had he drunk /all/ of this liquor? In one night? Castiel was aware of Dean’s love of alcohol, but this was beyond what even Dean boasted of being capable of. This went beyond alarming. This made Castiel want to grab the impala keys and rush Dean to the hospital. To force-feed him charcoal water until he threw everything up. This was--this was--
-----
“Who are you? Where am I?” Dean looked around. He was on an island peppered with various trees. In the center, a small mud brick house stood, surrounded by a colorful garden of fruit and flowers. A stone path wound through the garden and down to the beach where the two men now stood.
"That's another thing." Cas took off his glove and showed his palm to Dean. It was red and some of the skin had been scraped off, leaving it tender and, more concerningly, not healed.
The brothers jumped up. After Cas didn't elaborate, Sam decided he and Dean would go to Claire’s house, which was nearer. Cas agreed and disappeared to Sydney’s.
Dean's heart dropped to his feet. The pleasant moment was gone, and the warm feeling in his stomach was replaced by bitter ice. Goddamnit, of all the places.
“I insist.”
“Well, we got a pretty serious thing here,” Dean and Sam launched into an explanation. Cas’ face looked more confused and worried by the moment.
Once he was dry, Dean started to wander around the boat. Two fishermen watched as he stared wistfully out at the horizon.
“Yeah?” Sam stumbled out from behind the wood planks. “Sorry, that angel knocked me out.” He saw Cas. “Holy shit, what happened?”
“It’s yours,” He said with a smile.
“Yes,” Cas tore his eyes from Dean and went to look at the laptop Sam had open. “It does sound like some angels took vessels to battle. I think I could sense them on my way here.”
Sam met up with Dean at a nearby diner. They greeted each other and sat down, then started telling their stories.
“You wouldn’t believe me.”
Dean took his ring and gave Cas the one he'd been looking at. A bunch of different feelings whirled around in his head, then he thought
Castiel led Dean over through the garden to the small house. As they walked along the stone path, Dean saw that very few of the plants in the beds were ones he recognized. He was no botanist, but these flowers were definitely otherworldly. In one patch the gold petals seemed to sparkle; in another red swirled to blue. Some of the flowers actually rotated to watch Dean and seemed to tilt their ‘heads’, almost like they were curious about him.
Cas sighed. “I don’t want you two getting involved. You’ll make half the angels your enemies.”
"What else is on the agenda? Or are we making it up as we go?" Dean asked once the waiter walked away. He had a nervous feeling in his stomach that he could almost call anticipation.
The trio sat Claire next to Syd and explained what they had learned about the angel/prophet situation. Claire simply nodded, her large eyes occasionally flicking over to Syd. She looked bored and pissed.
“It’s alright.” Dean reached out to put his hand on Cas’s. Their tea laying forgotten, the two of them moved to sit on the couch, where Dean started to ask Cas about his decor while stroking his hand reassuringly.
“Then there is no case,” Dean and Cas looked at Sam. “Well, there’s nothing to kill, right?”
“I still do,” Sam blurted out. His throat caught, but he continued, “I didn’t call you just for a favor. I knew that with… all this going on, you wouldn’t want to lose your brother. And I couldn’t lose mine,” He added, turning to see through the window. Dean and Cas were kissing. He wasn’t surprised — it was about goddamn time — but he couldn’t bring himself to smile. Sam looked back at his shoes.
Cas didn’t need a toilet or bed, so he resorted to standing in the middle of the room, which happened to be in everyone’s path. After getting fed up with slamming into him while not looking, Sam drew an invisible circle in a corner for Cas to stand.
"You can drive if you want," Dean decided, handing over the keys and resolutely not regretting the layer of cloth between his lingering hand and Cas's.
Cas allowed himself to be pulled along. "Somehow, I believe you're right."
"Yes," Cas agreed, keeping his voice level. "Forty years in Hell, forty-one on Earth, and one left up to interpretation."
“Okay,” Dean said weakly.
“It's like, six in the morning, dude,” Dean groaned from his bed.
Dean woke up on some beach. The sun shone through his closed eyelids. He could smell the sea and hear the waves. As he got up and blinked hard to adjust his vision, sand tumbled off his chest. Dean removed the mangled mask from his face and took off his parachute, the sail of which was floating in the water behind him.
Castiel had lived for billions of years, but the few he had spent on Earth took up so much more space in his memory than they had any right to. He found himself calling a group of humans "family," despite the fact that the time he had known them was an infinitesimal fraction of his total existence. And yet, it seemed like eons longer than that.
Shaking his head, Dean dispelled the thought. No need to bring up a man's deathbed confessions when he wasn't ready. Besides, Cas was obviously in the mood to celebrate something (whatever that may be), and Dean wasn't going to rain on his parade with the heavy stuff before they'd even had breakfast.
“Why would she touch a lightning rod?” Sam asked incredulously.
Dean wasn't afraid to admit that he hadn't thought about what he'd do once the disasters ceased and he could be done with hunting. He'd honestly expected to be long gone by now, taken out in a blaze of glory ending that was messy and terrible but easy; that was how it was supposed to go. Living for the moment and only daring to hope for another day was much easier than imagining a long road ahead of dealing with everything in the rear-view mirror. Now, though, hunting didn't need to be his whole life. The world didn't need any more saving. A restless spirit or stray werewolf here and there wouldn't go amiss, he reasoned, when he needed to stretch his legs and get some exercise (he wasn't about to start running for fun, thank you very much; he'd leave that to his health nut brother).
Cas shook his head. “I can’t leave.”
Instead, Cas simply said, "Dean,"
Cas nodded. "I believe so. My ability to sense her evades me, but I did smell a hint of sulfur while she talked. I assumed it was just a potent flower of some sort. We should follow her. I have my angel blade in my coat."
Squirming under his gaze, Dean admitted, "I don't like making a big deal of this kinda stuff. You got things planned?"
After a few minutes of dodging traffic, Dean pulled up to a burning house. The firemen were rushing Claire’s grandmother out on a stretcher. Dean went to check on her, and Sam jogged over to Claire, who was unscathed aside from some smudges of soot. He put his hand on her shoulder comfortingly and led her over to the Impala.
“It says that she ‘wanted to see how it worked’. Guess she’s more of a doer than a learner,” Dean said while scrolling.
Sam inhaled and bit his lip, then said, “Five months.”
A small voice gasped next to Dean. A little girl with her hair done up in four puffs was looking right at the little guy on his shoulder. Dean gave her a smile and gestured her closer.
“You’ll never be happy if you keep pushing people away.” Dean tried not to take it personally. “Love is pain, but it’s also part of being human.” Cas let out a small sob. Dean cupped his cheek. “Hey, it’s alright.”
“Honey?”
"Heya, sleepyhead," Dean said softly, "Movie's over. You wanna head to bed?"
“So we gotta keep a constant watch on them?” Dean slumped.
A woman nearby watched the exchange in amusement. "Your partner seems very good with kids," she said to Cas.
Dean thanked him, grabbed their jackets, and ushered him out into the open air.
Before Dean could finish rebuttoning his uniform, Cas grasped his hand again and pulled him toward the small building. Dean thought he heard someone laugh at him tripping. He didn’t have time to look back, but he had a sneaking suspicion the voice belonged to the foliage.
“If I had a nickel for every time you said that,” Dean sighed, but turned his attention to Sam nonetheless.
They found five cars to put up on their walls. It seemed like enough to warrant the cost of getting them, but not so much that they left no room for what someone else might want to put up. Two of their choices were set apart enough from the other cars to get decent pictures of them. Cas wrote down the makes and models of the rest to find on the internet later. He seemed so in his element that Dean had to resist taking a picture of his concentrating face so he could cherish it forever.
“What do you want in payment?” He asked in an undertone.
“Dude, check this out.” Sam called through a cup of coffee.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Claire began, “She found me in her garden one day twelve years ago. She took me in and acted as a grandmother. I’ve lived here ever since.”
One of the first things Castiel learned about Earth was that time passed differently there than in Heaven. Nobody thought to mention this before he set foot on the grass that he used to watch grow tall with the blink of an eye but now barely shifted as hours passed. Castiel's initial moments walking among humans were spent marveling at the feeling of being trapped in a frozen moment, the clouds crawling across the sky and the sun moving nearly imperceptively.
Dean chuckled a little. He got one more glimpse of the ocean in the distance before Sam started to drive in the other direction. “One day.”
“Her wife?” Dean raised an eyebrow, earning a glare from Sam.
Dean beamed. "God damn, you thought of everything."
"Yeah," Dean answered with his most smug smile and exactly zero brain cells, "But you still love me." It took a moment for his mind to catch up with his mouth.
“He put you on an island in the middle of nowhere for something you MIGHT have done?” Dean said incredulously.
"Do you have any kids of your own?"
"You think your mojo's not working?" Dean dug around in the glove compartment for the first aid kit, one hand still holding Cas's. It wasn't a bad scrape, but it would be a bitch to drive with, and the thought of Cas in pain rubbed Dean the wrong way.
After he turned the car off, Dean took a moment to just sit in silence with Cas. He was nervous about going in and facing Sam and Jack in light of the new developments between them. It was one thing to get everything out in the open with Cas, but it was entirely another to consider how their other relationships might change because of it.
Cas nodded, looking a little grave. "Today you turned forty-two. Discounting the year you and I spent in Purgatory… you've officially been on Earth longer than you were in Hell."
“Yeah,” Dean mumbled. “Demons suck, and you have every right to be mad. But we pulled you here ‘cause we need you.”
"We found this purple rock that can make the holder see like a mantis shrimp," Jack regaled, "Those are the things that see way more colors than humans. Sam wouldn't let me try because he almost threw up when he touched it just for a second."
He looked back at Cas. Maybe there was something to be had with settling down. Having someone to share a space with. And not just out of necessity or habit, like squeezing into tiny motel rooms for as long as he could remember, but because being there with that someone made it home.
Dean laced his fingers and tapped his thumbs together. Now what? He couldn’t exactly pray to Cas saying
Sam crossed his arms at Gabriel. “Later. Just do this first.”
Cas pulled a thick blanket out of his bag, and Dean helped him spread it out. They weighed it down with one of their shoes at each corner. Dean watched Cas set out two beers from the cooler, a camping lantern, and a smaller blanket ("In case you get cold.") while the setting sun cast a golden glow on his face through the trees. This time, Dean gave in to the urge to take a picture. The shutter went off as Cas searched for a way to switch on the lantern, sitting cross-legged on their picnic blanket. Dean smiled at the unnecessarily sharp focus frozen on his features in the image and then the sheepish upturn of lips on the real Cas.
“The angel appeared on earth as a human, unlike others. It was a means of disguised protection for the prophet. Unfortunately, the angel was killed after a few generations. After that, an archangel was assigned to protect each prophet from Heaven. But the first one was the first holder of the torch.”
Sam & Dean interview the two subjects of the news stories.
“The day you were struck by lightning,” Dean finished for her, looking around in thought.
"It's okay," said Dean, "I get it. I am John's son, after all. I see why you might… worry about my reaction. I'm just sorry you didn't feel like you could tell me. I'd never want to push you away. I know I did when you first became human, and I regret it to this day," he amended, guilt creeping down his spine. "I thought I had no other choice—"
“That’s amazing.” Dean marveled. He quickly plucked the shirt from the fire. It wasn’t even hot. He went to hand it back, but Cas refused.
"Is this okay?" Cas asked earnestly.
Cas put his hand on Dean’s shoulder. “I understand. I will arrange for you to go home.” Dean looked terribly relieved. Cas took a breath and continued, “How about you stay for just one more night?”
Dean and Sam shared a look. “...Where?” Sam asked.
Sam made his exit after wiping crumbs from his chin. He struggled to get away from Ms. Johnson, who insisted he stayed for tea. After one last warning not to trample the flora, she let him go.
"Dean," Cas said in a tight voice, "I never told her my name."
"Yes, my grace is nearly gone," Cas began, "And Jack asked me if I wanted to be made an angel again, but I said no."
"Goddamn, I haven't been to one of these in forever," Dean exclaimed, grabbing Cas's unoccupied hand in excitement. "Yeah, I'd love to. Sam never wants to go, these days." To be honest, he couldn't remember the last time they'd attended a car show.
Cas chuckled. “No, I’m going to spin it.” He demonstrated by holding his berry by the stem and spinning it like a top. The berry flattened like a frisbee until it was about the size and shape of a tortilla. Then Cas rolled it up and took a bite. Dean grinned and tried for himself.
Dean ate the rest of Cas's pancakes, interrupting him every now and then to offer a bite. The sun rose higher in the sky and cast a golden light on Cas's face, making his hair practically sparkle. When both plates were empty, Cas paid the bill, Dean left a fifty for the waiter (what could he say, he was in a good mood), and they made their way back to the car.
“Oh, so I could bring the fuckin’ book but not my goddamn headphones?” She demanded, yanking her hand away.
"If you look closely, you'll see yours has an inscription," Cas prompted.
“It’s fuckin’ real,” Sydney whispered at last. “The danger is fuckin’ real. I can’t fuckin’...”
Dean's phone vibrated with a text from Sam.
"They're made up of silver and iron," Cas was saying, "I called upon Gabriel to redeem a favor. He befriended a skilled dwarven blacksmith during his time as Loki, and he kindly put me in touch with them to commission these. I hoped for something meaningful but also practical for a hunter."
"I disagree," said Cas, refusing to elaborate. "Would you like to take a day trip with me to celebrate?" He leaned back against the counter and watched Dean sip his drink. Their shoulders touched.
Dean rubbed his chin, trying to think. “Look, I have to get back home.” Castiel’s face fell. “My little brother probably thinks I’m dead. Wait, am I dead?”
“The tablets,” Sam added. His eyes slowly widened, the realization dawning on him. “So you think…”
Cas slipped his arm around Dean's waist about thirty minutes into the movie, watching him the whole time with a question in his eyes. Dean kept his eyes on the screen but nodded and patted Cas's shoulder in response, leaving his hand there. He risked a glance over to Sam and Eileen. Sam's head was resting on her shoulder, eyes half-lidded. Dean knew he'd be asleep soon, especially since Eileen's thumb was slowly stroking the skin of Sam's hand in her lap. A fond smile crept onto Dean's face.
“No, I couldn’t.”
“Is there anyone else here?”
"Where do you want to start?" Dean asked, leaning back onto one hand.
Dean stood up and offered his hand to help Cas do the same — neither let go when Cas straightened.
Dean was already tapping the steering wheel in rhythm to the music when Sam got down to the Impala. As soon as he hopped in, the car was racing towards the exit.
“Do you think I’m not?” Avoiding the question, Dean noticed. Still, that smile was nothing short of adorable. Shut up, Dean told himself.
Sydney still didn’t move. She was shaking slightly and still staring at the spot her cut used to be. When she didn’t get up after Sam asked her, he scooped her up and carried her to the Impala. She sat in the back, staring wide-eyed at the back of Dean’s seat.
“Nope.”
Cas nodded. "I have to get a few things to bring with us. I'll wait for you after I load it up."
Cas shone with pride in the rapidly dimming twilight. He took the other ring out of its box and offered it to Dean. "I intended for you to take this ring, while I wear the other one. There are certain connotations associated with exchanging rings, I know, but this doesn't necessarily have to follow societal norms. I just wanted to give you something useful and worth treasuring. Something to remind you of who loves you, and you'll never lose it."
“Oh,” Dean didn’t exactly see what the big deal was, but he could still feel a blush creeping up his neck.
Cas's blinding smile was answer enough for him. Dean fought to concentrate on the road into town, littered with midday traffic.
“Ah, so it’s heartbreak.”
“Relax, Dean-o. I can do it… for a price.” He shot Sam a pointed look.
Cas turned to watch the sun dip ever lower in the swirling colors of the sky.
“What are you doing?” Dean looked back up at Cas.
"Humans experience life in an entirely different way than angels," Cas explained, "You have a limited time on Earth, and thus you must live it out in the best way you can. Angels don't age, they're hardly ever in danger, they don't feel, and they never change."
Sam shrugged. “He said he was pretty busy with the whole civil war in heaven. We probably shouldn’t.”
“What did you do?” Dean asked, feeling the texture of the threads under his fingers.
“Who do you think I met in the middle of the ocean? A mermaid?” Dean forced a laugh. Sam bit back a retort upon seeing Dean’s sad expression.
Dean looked up at him skeptically. It didn’t feel at all like those fire blankets he’d find in public buildings. “Prove it.”
"Time is different as a human. Every moment is given significance, the likes of which I had never seen before from heaven. Watching the Colorado River carve the Grand Canyon takes up less space in my mind than the events of today, despite the millions of years' difference in the duration of each. I used to watch species rise and fall on the evolutionary chain with the tempo of a heartbeat, and now I get impatient waiting for my food to heat up." Cas chuckled, and Dean couldn't help but grin through his welling tears.
The dusk sky ripened like a peach, reddening with each passing mile of farmland and distant cities. Dean's stomach coiled with anticipation, a spring being compressed by the massive weight he'd been carrying on his shoulders for god knows how long. One way or another, tonight would mark a change in Dean's life. For once, he was optimistic about the outcome.
The transition from two to four people (Plus Cas) sharing a living space was not as seamless as one might hope. Between the one shared bathroom and limited walking space from multiple beds, tempers were running high. Dean swore loudly whenever he came across a major obstacle, and Sydney would swear even more.
The brothers played some more games, but Sam couldn’t help but notice that Bumblebee had become a bit of a shadow. Dean either didn’t see or didn’t care. However, he did leave a suspicious amount of prizes on the counter of the booths, then claimed to have forgotten.
-----
Dean stopped a couple hundred steps later in front of a small building with glass walls. Inside, dozens of plants teemed with butterflies of all different colors. He turned to see Cas beaming at him before they walked to the door.
“I’m not.” Cas’s face looked innocent. Too innocent, Dean thought. “You’re with me.”
Castiel finally found the Righteous Man after ten years of fighting alone. By then, he'd been reduced to repeating his mission of rescuing the Man like a mantra. He said nothing else as he sliced through the guards and muttered no curses when Alastair escaped. He didn't gasp in horror as the Righteous Man pierced a soul's heart with their own sharpened fear of abandonment. He simply appeared before his charge, pulled him close, and propelled them both upward.
However, the unknown fourth demon got Sydney from behind. She froze in fear after a kitchen knife sliced her bicep. Claire rushed forward before anyone realized what had happened. She clasped Syd’s hand on the gash while she pressed her palm to the demon’s forehead.
Speaking of, their food just arrived. Moving his hand out of the way of the plates, Dean realized it had been holding Cas's for the past few minutes. God, had he been running his thumb along Cas's knuckles, too? This was getting out of hand (ha). Their waiter kindly chose not to comment, for which they were going to receive an extra large tip. Fortunately, Dean was spared from fully melting into a puddle of mortification by the scrumptious-looking pancakes presented to him. He cut off a piece and shovelled it into his mouth as quickly as he could, praying that he wasn't blushing too badly.
“You,” Dean finished. “Yeah, I realized that last night.”
Cas shook his head, then looked back at Dean with tears in his eyes. To Dean’s pleasant surprise, Cas made up his mind and smashed his lips against Dean’s. As they kissed, Dean heart the ivy sing like an unearthly viola. If he cared, he’d know that the flowers had opened. The only thought going through his head as Cas pulled him toward the small bedroom was ‘so that’s why the table plant smelled like honey.’
“Hello? Who is this?”
The guide at the door warned them to watch their step in case a butterfly decided to land on the floor. Cas dutifully hung his head and walked carefully to the nearest bench, where he and Dean sat. Cas watched the little bugs float lazily over his head with open joy that Dean couldn't tear his eyes away from. He didn't want to whip out his phone, but he did take a few seconds to let the image solidify in his memory.
Dean nodded.
The table was already set when they got there, servings of fettuccine alfredo still steaming on the plates.
"You did," said Dean quietly. A hand clasped his arm, and he looked up into Cas's earnest eyes.
“Whatchya readin’?” Dean asked while looking at her book.
“You didn’t know that I love you back,” Gabe reached for Sam’s hand and held it reassuringly.
“We gotta go on that ferris wheel.”
“Not sure,” She said tentatively. “I don’t know when I learned the language, but it’s almost translating into English for me. It’s also giving me a wicked headache.” She added, rubbing her eyes.
Dean looked up in confusion. “Why do you think he’d help?”
“Sounds like she was an angel vessel. Should we call Cas?”
“All you had to do was ask, Samsquatch,” said a voice behind the Winchesters. They turned around, expressions somewhere between relief and surprise. There was Gabriel, leaning casually against the wall. He wore a small smirk, but the sad way he was looking at Sam gave him away. Then his eyes fell on Cas and his expression turned to open worry. “Oh, Cassie…”
Dean threw up his hands. “Well, let’s go see what’s going on!”
Despite all the stunning and strange flowers in the garden, Dean’s eyes were glued to Cas. He admired every simple but unique motion of his hands on the loom and the muscles in his arms. Cas stopped singing and Dean blinked. The shirt was complete, but unremarkable. Castiel handed it to him.
"A little. Nothing over-the-top, but I thought today definitely deserves a little indulgence. Perhaps we could start by going to that nice diner on the other side of town for breakfast."
Wind assaulted what little of Dean’s face was exposed as he tumbled through the air. Now that he was out of the jet, he could see that one of the engines was smoking. He started fumbling with the chute. Finally it flew open and caught him in the air, but it wasn’t very long before the jet exploded and knocked Dean unconscious.
“I haven’t had many visitors. Those who have come here don’t seem to be the telling type. Besides, would anyone believe them?” Cas shrugged and retrieved a tea tray from the small kitchen.
Dean scrambled to his feet, subtly making his way to the hook that held Cas's coat. Finally, his fingers found the hilt of the angel blade. He leaped into the fray and put the second demon into a chokehold, blade at their throat. Cas wrestled the woman to the ground and put a knee on the arm twisted behind her back. Dean made sure the door was shut, then nodded to signal Cas. Latin chanting spilled out of Cas's mouth with practiced ease. The lights flickered as the demons struggled harder, but Cas didn't let that faze him. He spoke the last words of the exorcism with extra force as sinister smoke burned twin patches in the floor.
"Yes, I did. And I want to continue to do so. If I were to become a fully-fledged angel again, I would be stuck exactly as I am now, or worse, I'd revert to how I was before I Fell." Cas's thumb stroked Dean's skin absentmindedly. "I'm not perfect. Some might even say Falling was the worst thing that ever happened to me. But I wouldn't give it up for the world. Not now, not ever. My new emotions and thoughts are gifts that make the world so much more vibrant. They scare me sometimes, yes, and mortality is terrifying, but they make life worth living."
“Jacksonville, Florida.”
“Heya, Cas.”
"Would you like to lay down?" Cas offered.
"C'mon this way. I saw a sign for something cool when we were driving in. I think you'll like it."
Sam exhaled through his nose loudly. “So get this,” He repeated. “There’s this news story. Some woman goes missing. Just before she left, her wife said--”
“Hello, Dean,” The man’s voice was gravelly and deep. Dean had a moment of panic as to how the man knew his name, then remembered it was sewn on the front of his uniform.
“Kevin,” Sam finished with a sigh.
“M’kay.” Dean mumbled over the revving of the Impala’s engine.
As if that wasn't enough, the rings had even more to offer. "I'm aware that all the rigor involved with hunting can make it difficult to keep track of personal items. I also don't know how rings are sized, so I asked the dwarf to add some enchantments. Firstly, the rings will be a perfect fit, no matter who wears them, and they won't tarnish. Secondly, they cannot be removed except by the wearer or with their permission. And lastly, should the owner ever misplace their ring, they need only reach into their pocket, and there it will be waiting. You'll never lose it to a monster's antics, nor anything else."
that Dean forgot how sleepy he was, wanting to stay in this moment forever. They wrapped each other in their arms, trading slow kisses, until Dean couldn't hold back a yawn anymore.
"Alright," he sighed, pushing Cas away just slightly. "I'm tired. How about we go to sleep and maybe pick this up tomorrow?"
When they had both put on their FBI getup, Dean asked Sam, “So should we split up, or do one at a time.”
The movie had ended at some point during Dean's contemplation, and Eileen was the only other person still awake. Cas's head was pillowed on Dean's shoulder. Eileen nudged Sam awake and bid them goodnight before leading him to their room. She gave Dean a pointed look at Cas. Dean smiled a little, waving his hand. Cas stirred after they were alone for a moment.
They spent the afternoon together. Dean and Castiel occupied the couch across from the television. Of course – as they did every Saturday afternoon – they watched Dr. Sexy, M.D., which was Dean's favorite show. He had watched it every week since he met Castiel, or even longer. This time was no different. The man was following the action on the TV screen with a dreamy gaze while he held a plate of pancakes in his hands. And although Castiel constantly made fun of his little obsession, he cut Dean's pie into pieces and fed him. Claire had her own opinion on the matter as well, but she had long ago decided not to mention it. Her parents made an odd couple, but she loved them more than anything, and Doctor Sexy couldn't prevent that.
"Just like Claire."
Dean had already stopped asking questions years ago. He was now an adult, almost independent, and wanted to continue what had been started. He knew there was no way out. They were the Red Hill family and they couldn't escape. Fate had grabbed them in its clutches almost a century ago. From then on, everything seemed different. And although people saw how much they valued traditions, they chose not to blow it. They greeted them, chatted and went back to their lives. They saw no point in fraternizing with them, but maintaining peaceful relations was something else entirely.
"Dean, Ruby's not your enemy, she's your sister-in-law." Castiel sighed. "I don't think the two terms have much to do with each other."
"Do you live in the valley, Castiel?" Charlie asked. She wanted to help her cousin. Just this once. He seemed preoccupied with the subject of God's will in this case. He was the one who had inherited the family business for a reason. He could be dangerously fanatical.
"Probably tried to drag the guy who plays Doctor Sexy to bed."
"I already do," he replied, snuggling into his husband."
"You clean up nicely," he said when Dean managed to pick up all the pieces of the broken plate on the dustpan without hurting himself in the process.
"Peace at last..." started Charlie, looking up. "It's so quiet here today... As if nobody had visited us for ages!"
Castiel grasped the erection he prided himself on in his hand. He took a moment to prepare himself, then pressed Dean against one of the walls of the old shed. The paleness of his skin mingled with the white paint. Castiel drew in a breath, then glanced at his beloved with his eyes. He looked at the profile of his face, which showed pure excitement and desperation. His lips were red and swollen. He was panting, making his chest rise and fall in the blink of an eye. He pressed his hands against the wall, grasping the points of attachment. His juicy buttocks were exposed and ready for anything. Castiel brought a hand to his face and then plucked his fingers. Not wanting to cause Dean any pain, he gently smeared his member with lube, then moved closer to the man at the shed. Although Castiel was scared, he wanted to do it. His thoughts were focused on how different it could be from what he had experienced so far. He had hundreds of visions and his own theories, but he decided to find out through experience. Gaining courage, Castiel began the penetration.
"And you're just going to go there like that!" Dean raised his voice, watching his daughter in disbelief.
"Good morning, Cas," he whispered, bringing his face closer again.
"What is it that has happened that we are eating stew today?" Sam asked, smiling warmly.
"Yes..." he nodded, burying his fork in his plate. "I feel like I know you from somewhere."
"Put it in your mouth..." whispered Castiel, being a tad impatient. He saw Dean hesitate a moment, so he pulled him towards his arousal. With no other choice, the man grabbed Castiel's swollen erection in his filigree hands, then shook it. A moan escaped Castiel's lips, which could only encourage the man who was kneeling to continue. "Yes, baby... Just like that..."
