Castiel’s breath hitched in his throat.
‘Hello. Is there another clue? I’m getting worried about you.’
Dean didn’t think much about it, wrapping his thick arms around Castiel’s thin torso. He pulled him closer, almost nuzzling him as he continued to hug the teenager. “W-what are you-”
Sam stood rooted to the spot, dialing Bobby’s number with a frown.
Later that day, he decided to go out for lunch. But he didn’t go with any of his friends and he didn’t even grab any food. He knew a secret place with a beautiful view around the small group of trees beside his school that he hadn’t yet seen during the winter. It was a cleaning with a take, and it was usually alive with birds and flowers despite having been disregarded often.
“I like you, Dean,” Castiel suddenly whispered in his ear. Dean stopped breathing for a couple beats, not expecting anyone to actually tell him so plainly if they ever did at all. “I like you too, Cas,” he murmured back.
A/N: I decided to continue this story with a different plot, so I made a change to the end of the first chapter. The only letter Dean found was the one addressed to him.
“Well I know Castiel won’t appreciate it when he finds out it’s you and you’re dating someone already.” Charlie told the jock.
A/N: I'm sorry. I wanted to cry while writing this but it just had to be done. ;-;
Dean opened the driver seat to his Impala and smiled at how beautiful the inside still was. He thought about asking Castiel if he wanted a ride home, but he had already started speaking. “I’ll be going now. See you tomorrow.”
Castiel didn’t look quite on the verge of tears, but he did look upset. He rolled up his sleeve and took a long hard look at his arm, where the scars could easily be seen. “It’s true, alright. My soulmate would rather commit suicide than be with me and leave the scars as a reminder.” Now he was fighting to keep the tears back.
Still, Castiel’s soulmate was quite creative with the angelic touch. The fact remained that he couldn’t guess how his soulmate knew who he was and it would probably stay that way for quite some time. He watched the designs swirl around his fingers and his arms.
~“Well that’s alright, it just means you have more time to find your special someone.”~
Castiel wished to hear his soulmate open the door, come in and hold him tight, but that was just a stupid dream that would never come true. He wasn’t Cinderella, there wasn’t some fairy watching over him, and there was absolutely nothing he could do to help himself, either.
“Aw, but Cassie, it’s really fun!! I even got my soulmate to agree.” Gabriel grinned and sat on the desk where Castiel had tried to get comfortable. He rolled his eyes and looked at Gabe with annoyed eyes. “You have two minutes.” That warning was like setting off a time bomb. He exploded with words, mischievous plots and big, toothy smiles. Castiel managed to understand that Gabriel was wanting to prank Dean Winchester, a complete idiot and asshole in Castiel’s opinion. That stupid jock had gotten into so much trouble and according to rumor, never had a girl longer than two weeks. He knew Dean Winchester liked a girl named Lisa, which wasn’t much of a rumor. Gabriel said that he was practically asking to be pranked.
Staying with the Novaks had proved to be a good idea for the Winchester brothers. Dean had the occasional beer on his sad nights, but for the most part, he was sober. He hadn’t become his father, he took care of himself, and he did his homework.
Charlie ran up to Dean outside the school when she caught him alone. “You have a plan for today?” She asked, simply worrying about what would happen to the jock and to her best friend.
Dean yanked away his wrist on instinct, being reminded of his father at once. Castiel’s smile faltered and left Dean with a sense of guilt, having glared at him right after the other teen said such kind things to him. “Sorry,” he apologized slowly with a lack of words on his tongue. “My lifestyle is difficult to understand for someone who doesn’t believe.” Dean explained with a frown. He let Castiel take back his arm uncomfortably and watched his every move. “You don’t have to believe it, actually it’s safer that way, but I’d like you to… to believe in me, please.” Dean proceeded to lean his head against Castiel’s, which was something he considered brave. Lately it was tough for him to be close to anyone and doing such a thing with Castiel was a huge improvement on his part.
“Well, someone must help me set up the Winter Dance in the gym.” Michael muttered in irritation. He was seriously beginning to think of asking other upperclassmen instead of these buffoons. But he could force his brothers into helping him- the others had a choice.
“I went to get-”
Castiel forced his face into his soft pillow, closing his eyes. He had gotten a clue already two days ago, as soon as he got home, but he hadn't paid much attention to it. He already knew who his soulmate was, so why bother? It had read, “Today I tried out for the play, it was different to me, but it was okay.” Castiel wasn't sure why it was different to him but he didn't really care. But that was when Castiel, too, had auditioned in the auditorium. He'd gotten a scar that day, too, but at least it wasn't the horrible deepness it had been before. That was when he was still slightly uncertain.
“Why?”
Castiel pondered a moment. He understood the message completely, but he wasn’t sure why his soulmate considered that to be a clue. Maybe he would just have to look for someone who constantly had bruises. It was honestly depressing but the fact that he was keeping someone alive made his heart flutter. He didn’t know his soulmate was someone so close to dying. But what did that mean? Obviously he was suicidal. His father probably beats him, Castiel thought.
Down to the very last beer bottle.
Castiel’s message showed the exact opposite of the amount of confidence he actually possessed. He pretended to be sure, when in reality he was being torn apart by apprehension.
Dean Winchester once again pulled his hand away secretly and went around to the other side, fixing the lights on the car which had also been splattered with paint.
Sam looked up from the book with angel lore. “Yeah, Dean. I always do.”
He was quite hesitant to press his foot against the surface as he peered into the water’s blue-white depths. He couldn’t tell how deep it was, because the ice was too blurry to see through the water. When he did, though, he felt a boost of confidence shoot up his legs. Castiel fully stepped out onto the ice, letting out a deep breath he didn’t think he had been holding in.
Meanwhile, Charlie narrowed her eyes towards the table of jocks and kept in observation mode. She had a feeling she’d be conducting an experiment this afternoon.
*~*~*
Dean’s eyes dilated and he was frozen in shock. Castiel had shown such passive-aggressive behavior for someone so normally quiet. “And Gabriel will be good to Sam. You won’t have to worry about his safety when my brother is looking after him. I think it’s time that you stop worrying about everyone else and start looking after yourself. What do YOU want? What does DEAN want?”
“Okay, Dean. Do you promise to call me if you need me?”
No response. Castiel threw the pen across the room, smacking the poster he had on his wall. “How dare…” Castiel quickly got ready for school and hopped on the bus, zoning everyone and everything along the way. He didn’t even take out his earbuds at school when Charlie tried to talk to him. Nothing, absolutely nothing was worth it.
Castiel crept behind the other high schooler cars and avoided being seen. He learned his sneaky devilness from his brother Lucifer when they were kids, and judging by the technique Gabriel was using, he assumed the same went for his brother.
Well, I'll leave you to comment, vote, or... cry?
They greeted the pastor after they entered the church and walked down the pathway between the pews. Sam admired the architecture of the church, including its stereotypical stained-glass windows high up on the walls. Dean introduced them both as FBI agents.
Charlie continued to show her support. “I understand, Dean, but you’re his /soulmate/. Some people aren’t even lucky enough to have one. Since you do, you need to do everything in your power to make sure that Castiel is happy. And I don’t exactly think he’s content being called a, uhmm.. ‘Shitty outcast.’” Charlie huffed, “Especially by his soulmate.”
“Shut up, Norris.” Dean didn’t meet a single person’s eyes the entire time. He stared at the ground like it was covered in jewels. “You’re not standing up for this fucking retard, are you?” Norris asked dangerously.
“I can see that,” Castiel’s teacher sighed and sat at a desk beside him. “Is there anything I can do to help?”
“But still, it doesn’t help anyone to bully him.” Charlie continued as she gave him a motherly expression.
“Ask him… ask him for the next clue.” Charlie decided, putting Plan A into order. She was going to support Castiel if it was the last thing she did and trust me, it wouldn’t be.
“Yeah, but, why? Cas has been freaking out about you. And I think you need him, too. Why can’t you just tell him it’s you?” Charlie asked.
“No, Cas… Thank you for saving mine.” Dean’s voice was shaky, like he was about to cry as he squeezed Castiel’s hand lovingly. Castiel leaned up and kissed Dean’s perfectly chapped lips, sighing into the kiss. When they separated, Dean led Castiel to a bench and wiped off the snow. He took a seat and Castiel sat beside him.
'You’re looking in the wrong place.'
“I wasn’t that mean,” Dean said defensively. “I’ve been worse to you.”
Absolutely no one. His father was now dead as well as his mother, and Castiel had not heard of any grandparents that may have taken him in. What was he supposed to do, live in the house without anyone knowing?
Sam furrowed his eyebrows and knocked again, harder this time.
'My father doesn’t want me falling desperately in love with someone. The life I live… It’s very dangerous. You couldn’t possibly understand. If I were to fall for you, I would put you before my duty and he doesn’t want that.'
You don’t have the right to call me that, Castiel wrote.
“How the hell can you know that look?” Dean asked Castiel anxiously, watching Lisa stroll down the hall with her friends. He looked down at the floor.
'Hey there. Ready for my next riddle?'
“Because, I can't…” Dean Winchester tugged on the ends of his sweatshirt. He wanted desperately to be able to. He wanted to stay in Castiel's presence and just talk to him, but he couldn't. So he left.
Castiel shook his head angrily. “Why were you so mean to me in there?” He asked, looking up at Dean with sad, big blue eyes.
'Only of you. I don’t know what I’d do if I didn’t get to look at you at least once during my day. I absolutely hate weekends.'
'Good. I’ll keep drawing then.'
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean’s eyes widened with tears and he blinked them away until they covered the letter he gripped tightly in his hands. The buzz may have prevented him from seeing his dead soulmate, but he imagined the boy clearly in his mind with the last words of the letter.
Castiel smiled brightly and accidentally smudged the word lovely. He sighed and laid his head down on the desk, his entire arm now beautifully designed. That was enough exhaustion for the day. Definitely enough anxiety.
“No, no, no.” Castiel wouldn’t believe his ears. He wanted Dean Winchester to be as dreamy and sweet as he had been the day before. He received a sudden flashback:
*~*~*~*
'Of course not. They’re lovely.'
Castiel approached the jock and was at a loss for words. He opened his mouth to speak but all that came out was exhaled air. Dean was surrounded by the other football and basketball players, some baseball or swimmers, too, and he certainly stood out from the rest. It wasn’t that he looked too attractive when compared to the others but he just appeared les /jocky/ than usual.
All he wanted was to talk to Dean that day to clear his head and he ended up being bullied instead!
Dean threw the top of the box aside and sifted through the box’s contents. Inside was a letter enclosed in a crisp envelope.
“Aww.” Charlie cooed, imagining how they might eventually get together.
There was something unsettling about his choices, but Castiel had a feeling they’d all be sorted out soon. He glanced outside the door and noticed how dark it had gotten. The sky wasn’t even a sunset anymore, but a reflection of a pool of black. The white snow was the only thing he could really see in the sky because not a single star could be seen among the fog in the air.
“Oh, me too!” Charlie exclaimed, grinning. She was a video game freak and rambled on about several before Sam and Dean could get her to shut her mouth.
“I know. But don’t worry, I’ll change the way he thinks of me. The eleventh day.”
Castiel didn’t expect a response, but when he got one, he couldn’t deny the butterflies in his stomach. I’m sorry, Cas. It’s the only way to take away the pain without leaving you.
“Dean Winchester? What makes you think that?” Charlie asked slyly, unlocking her phone. She began typing, not showing him as she did so, and then put her phone in her pocket. “Well, I don’t really want to think about it. I’m trying to pretend it isn’t true.” Castiel admitted shyly, crossing one leg over the other. He looked down at his plate of food, left untouched by him.
“Agh, okay. What should I ask him?” Castiel pulled out the pen stuck behind his ear.
The man did not bid them farewell and simply left without another word, getting into the old junkie car instead of the Impala, which was definity a surprise to the Winchester brothers. He drove away fast.
It was Sam. “No, thanks,” Dean groaned, rolling over onto his other side. Sam sighed and didn't bother asking again, which was disappointing because Dean had been wanting him to.
Castiel turned to face the person who had suddenly stifled a cough. “De…. Winchester.” He greeted the jock, his arms folded across his chest.
“All that matters is right now.” Dean sounded strict, but certain. Castiel admired that tone of voice; it was so demanding and he liked the way it made him feel. He nodded with no verbal reply and laid his head on Dean’s shoulder. Dean suddenly moved and forced Castiel to himself.
The red liquid was smeared and his fingers began to fade until the only evidence that remained was the red cut on his arm just below the faded pink one. A scar.
Then he printed out a list of all the girls in his year, crossing off all the names he knew for sure wouldn’t be his soulmate. He put a few question marks by the ones that wore sleeves. He sighed as he realized there weren’t very many left on his list.
Dean lifted his finger and placed it on Castiel's lips. “No buts.” He forced himself to lay down, closing his eyes. He let himself ease into the couch when Castiel laid beside him. He was shocked that the other teen had decided to, but he was grateful nonetheless.
There were so many things he wanted to ask this person that if he really wished it, he could cover his entire body with words. Then he remembered something he hadn’t thought about it in a long time. He had looked into the mirror and noticed something that made him question if he meant anything to his soulmate.
Dean’s face was like a tomato, but he couldn’t tell whether it was due to the cold or due to embarrassment. He assumed it was probably both.
Sam’s nose scrunched in annoyance. “Seriously, Dean?”
Dean Winchester seemed much different than Castiel expected him to be. When they went through the different options for parts, and tested out a few different characters on him, Castiel noticed he acted better as Aaron Burr although Dean struck him as more of a full-on star Alexander Hamilton. Maybe it was just the lighting of the stage, but Castiel swore something was different about his eyes. Regretful, almost. Just like Aaron Burr had been after he shot Hamilton. Gabriel nudged Castiel back up to the stage and apologized in advance, but Castiel was already upset with him. “Go ahead and act out the last scene, from the script. Dean as Burr, Castiel as Hamilton.”
*~*~*~*
“Who's Bobby?”
Castiel traced his fingers over the five scars on his arm. They looked pretty deep and Castiel wondered how much pain his soulmate endured while doing it. Castiel assumed he wanted physical pain to take away the mental pain, but he didn’t think it was a healthy nor helpful trade.
He hated himself for not doing enough as he felt the slice.
Dean threw a few shirts and some shorts into his duffle bag. He tossed some of his hunting supplies there, too, just in case they ever came across something.
“Because my soulmate is male!” Castiel screeched, flushing a bright red after attracting the attention of several students around their table. Charlie nodded as if it was nothing, seeing as her soulmate was also of the same gender. She hadn’t figured out the name of hers yet, but they talked often, and Charlie didn’t feel ready enough to figure it out anyways. She received a clue that it was someone she was already close to, and she didn’t want to ruin any friendships she had considered how little there actually were.
Sam peeked through the door’s thin opening after tilting the doorknob, his worry obvious underneath a faked smile. “I just came to see how you’re doing. I know this might be a little hard for you, staying here, but I want to let you know-- I’m thankful you came. That house was a dreadful place to be. Castiel wouldn’t have wanted that for you.”
“Agh, you don’t understand,” Dean grumbled under his breath.
‘What does that even mean? What kind of hunt?’ Castiel wrote back.
But Dean thought of Castiel every day--- and his whole world was still grey. His heart was still heavy and his eyes still sore. After graduation, he had taken hunting on as a full-time job. He was getting really good at it, too. He was handy with a knife and even handier with bullets.
Dean was as handsome as a star, that’s for sure, and the ladies who had followed him praised him when they were finished, but Castiel didn’t need approval. He didn’t really care if the girls liked him as Dean seemed to. He didn’t see the purpose of caring so much when he wasn’t going to see any of them in college or in life. Except, maybe, Dean Winchester. The thought sent shivers down his spine.
It would definitely be a good idea to get Dean to stay with the Novaks.
Castiel didn’t expect him to answer as soon as he did, but he was grateful for it. ‘You want it now?’
Throughout dinner, Castiel nibbled a few bites and looked down at his plate. Why did everything have to be so complicated? He couldn’t focus on a single word uttered at the table and even though he wouldn’t want to, he would at least like to have a mind free from worries. “Alright, guys listen up!” His mother cleared her throat and told them to put their pens down. “The reason I wanted us to have this family dinner is because… you are all going to have a new baby brother or sister!!” She screeched, making Castiel’s head spin. Oh, joy, another one, Castiel thought, using every ounce of strength he had to not roll his eyes and smile. “Oh, isn’t that lovely?” Their dad rhetorically asked, engaging in conversation with Michael.
Castiel sat by a tree outside school grounds after school had finished.
Castiel shook his head. “But-”
Castiel took a deep breath, his heart racing as he stepped outside. Immediately the cold air stung his eyes and confined his lungs, making it even harder to breathe than before.
Behind the shadows of the tree, Dean stepped out and passed his twin on the way to the clearing.
Castiel like awake in his bed, with cold sweat dripping down his neck and his back as he stared at the scars that would mark the pain forever. Below the scar, however, was the clue, “I know you were there, now you’ll understand but damn, I do it all for Sam.” An hour later, there came the drawings, all laced into one big heart that said the words Castiel somehow had been wanting to hear since the very beginning.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was mostly silent. The waters were more quiet than usual, which was odd to him, but the wind was insanely loud in his ears. He liked it that way, when he didn’t want to hear his own thoughts because then he’d probably jump off the bridge.
“Then I’ll know you’ve fallen for someone else.”
“Oh. Great. Know any suicidal football players?”
“Hmm…” Castiel looked up at him. “Well, maybe give me some advice?” The teacher nodded and smile, resituating himself with his large stack of papers. “Go on.”
“It’s lovely, Dean.” Castiel leaned against him, smelling the rose lightly. The snow had begun to fall harder. It was freezing. “I love you very much.”
'To start you off, I am male. Begin your quest, you may not want to fail.'
“Damn it, Dean… You cannot continue to torture yourself. Don't lie to me; I saw the look in your eyes at the funeral. You can't even match your clothes.”
“Ah, the Trickster.” Dean Winchester chuckled, but Castiel could see real sadness in his eyes. The car must mean a lot to him, Castiel thought with a sigh. “I apologize on behalf of my brother,” he told the football player, looking at the Impala.
What a horrible, mean world it was to live in. Maybe he’d find a way to speak to Dean privately and give him a little message. Castiel was grateful that the jock was so close to him and less close to the others, because his next action was quite secret. He walked a few more steps up to Dean and whispered in his ear, “meet me by the lake.”
The anger in Dean’s voice frightened Sam. He hadn’t gotten that feeling since John last beat Dean in front of him out on the porch. He immediately felt the need to call Bobby, who had been vacationing down in Florida with Ellen and Jo. Sam and Dean had been offered to go, but both denied (however, only Sam had been polite about it). “Leave me alone.” Dean added, retreating to his room.
“Remind me why we think she’s a bitch,” Castiel mumbled to Charlie in embarrassment.
Sam sighed and went into the bathroom, getting a washrag because he knew he wasn’t physically strong enough to take it back from his brother. He cleaned up the blood around the sink and tossed the washrag into the laundry room. He was smart enough to recognize all the signs. There were barely any dishes, and there wasn’t any laundry… Sam slowly checked the tub, which looked the exact same as it did before he left eight days previous. “Listen, Dean, I think it is my business. You’re my brother.” He checked Dean’s room next. The bed was the only thing that looked recently disturbed, since its covers were spread across the surface. “I care about you. You’ve barely eaten, you haven’t kept yourself clean... What’s going on, Dean?”
'If you really knew me, you wouldn’t  say that. Cas, you’re too damn good for me. There’s nothing more to it.'
A/N: Hey, I know this one's kinda different than the others. There wasn't even a clue! Dean's too depressed for any of this right now. Chapter title, I wasn't sure, but it was inspired by Hamilton on the last song and I figured since both are depressing why not?? Anyways, I know you probably didn't enjoy the bit about Lisa but good things to come, maybe, hopefully? Guess!!
Sam nodded respectfully. “Okay, Dean. I’ll come with you.” He opened the door slightly more and Dean saw Gabriel down the hall, eagerly waiting for his soulmate to return for a much-deserved cuddle session.
“Thanks,” Dean thanked him, dealing with the trunk and the back window quickly. The silence lasted a lot longer than either of the two would’ve wanted, but neither knew what to say to keep it from happening. Castiel took the front and right side, Dean the back and the left side. When they had finished, Castiel struggled to reach the top of the car. Dean noticed this, and walked over to him, tracing his fingertips over Castiel’s and reached along with him and both towels. Dean let his other hand find its way to his face, where he covered his rose-colored cheeks.
“No, this isn’t happening, this can’t be..” Dean mumbled words of sadness and loss to himself but the fake Dean just cracked his neck and stared down at the real Dean with the most evil look on his identical face.
“Of course it is, you gay shit. How do you think your mother would feel about this?” The man growled, his voice a lot lower than before. Dean glared at him, “How dare you bring Mom into this-” Dean hissed under his breath.
You make me smile, Dean Winchester.’
Sam Winchester had only just reached teenagehood, or at least it seemed like that. He took his headphones off and sighed. “It was alright. Uh, Dean, who’s this? Where’s Lisa?”
“Of course,” Lucifer smoothly replied, laying on his back despite feeling the cold of the snow.
Castiel stood upon a chair, growing flustered that he STILL couldn’t reach the spot he was supposed to hang the streamer. There was already a table set up for punch, presumably by his committed brother Michael, but other than that the entire gym was left without a single decoration. The worst part was that he only had a few hours to finish decorating before everyone started showing up to the dance.
“Be careful, Sammy. You know how dad doesn’t like soulmates, especially not dude ones. Don’t get your hopes up and don’t get attached,” Dean muttered under his breath, feeling Castiel clench the hem of his shirt. He rubbed circles in the boy’s back, showing a kind of gentleness he hadn’t shown anyone, not even Sam. It was similar, of course, but it just wasn’t the same. Sam scoffed when he noticed it, “And what are you doing? Not setting a very great example.”
“I may not know everything, but I do know that you’ve saved my life. I know that without you, I won’t ever be content. We need each other, whether you accept that or not, and that’s it. So don’t ever say you aren’t needed again because to me you will always be.”
“Agh, Sammy, I said leave me alone.”
*~*~*~*
“Ignore my brother.” Castiel added, glaring at Gabriel. He rolled his eyes and wished he could see Dean’s for the sake of curiosity. “He’s a douche.”
“Of course I did, Charlie, but I don’t want it to be him!” Castiel exclaimed, loudly, causing some of the people beside them to stare. “Okay, look, I know things may get a little dark around here to me if I don’t go with him, if it is him, but I’m not sure how much I care. He’s a complete assbutt.” Castiel ranted, mostly to himself, but Charlie listened patiently. “He may be attractive, and his life IS in danger, but he’s not a good person!”
There were certain precautions he could’ve taken. There were so many things that he was responsible for, but yet he didn't try to do anything about them before. He blamed his procrastination, but it was probably also his increasing anxiety since he’d discovered his soulmate. With a deep sigh and a glance out the window, he wished wishing stars had real value.
“Yeah, but not really,” Dean sighed into the bubbles.
Castiel closed his eyes and laid back down, shivering underneath the stranger’s leather jacket. He didn’t go back to school for the rest of the day and nobody else saw him.
Dean shot Gabriel a questioning look, which made the boy respond with “Cassie here is in charge of the decorating. Why don’t you help him?”
“Cas, I was an absolute dick to you, especially with those jocks,” Dean commented sourly, “Why the hell are you accepting me? I’ve done nothing to earn that kindness.”
“That’s Winchester to you.” Dean was looking down at the floor when he muttered the bitter reply. “Yeah- only his friends get to call him Dean.” The other jock scoffed and moved his hands around in his coat pockets. A golden chain swung around his muscular neck.
((A/N: For people that think there’s a mistake with this process- yes, I know it would be much more difficult to clean paint off a car, but this is fictional :P would you rather have some destiel action or describing cleaning a car? Destiel? Yesh.))
'I can’t. You couldn’t possibly understand why, but I do wish it was possible.'
“Good morning,” Castiel greeted Charlie. Before she replied hello, she looked irritated with something and it made Castiel think. She usually never got worked up about things, maybe there was something wrong? No, it’s probably just some fictional form of irritation. Castiel guessed maybe her favorite character died or she lost an expensive comic book, but he was far from right.
He wanted Castiel, with his simple clothes and small smile, enchanting blue eyes and a calm expression on his face as he watched Dean score a goal for his team. Maybe if he was lucky, he’d eventually see Castiel with a huge grin instead of a small smile, chanting his name like he couldn’t be prouder.
Dean sighed and relaxed his arms around Castiel the best he could. “So, you've got a different place to live. That's very good. I'm happy for you.” There was a long pause and Castiel just couldn't take the small talk anymore.
Sam looked uneasily at his brother, unsure whether or not to argue. Dean was fragile in this state and Sam was damn near the only one who could tell, since Dean was very careful to shield his feelings from everyone around him. Sam didn’t want his brother to hurt all alone. He felt guilty that he could have happiness with his own soulmate while Dean suffered from grief.
“Cassie can help ya! I’ve got a special date,” Gabriel’s cheeks were nice and pink. Castiel’s eyes widened for both parts of his idiot brother’s sentence.
Castiel shivered a little, letting out a long breath, that became visible in the cold air.
So he didn’t respond. There’s no point in guessing something with only 40% probability when the result was automatically losing the game. He would just wait a little longer, and if that meant a few more scars, then so be it. Castiel decided that a few more horizontal scars were better than a long vertical one. He thought about showing Charlie, asking for her opinion, but he didn’t want to bother her since her family was going through some tough shit at the moment. He held his cell phone in his hand, wishing there was some soulmate seeking number he could call, and fell asleep for hours.
“Yeah,” Castiel breathed out dreamily.
“Dean, what’s this?”
“Didn’t I tell you it isn’t your damn business?”
Castiel was extremely surprised by his brother’s beautiful statement. Lucifer wasn’t known to say things like that at all and Castiel didn’t even know he was capable. He was probably good at writing poems, Castiel thought, but that just made him think of his soulmate and the poetic words he so rarely heard anymore. He had received a clue the previous night, “You used to think so badly of me, but I hope that changed under the tree.” And it had. Honestly.
“Oh, my, I’m not sure what to say. Your father has been in a car accident and is now at Mercy Greene Hospital in critical condition. I’m afraid he doesn’t have much longer. You and your brother should come down immediately.”
Dean smiled, a happy smile, and nodded before stashing the script into his backpack. “Yeah. Just wanted you to know.” His fingers nervously twitched as Castiel reached out for him. Castiel’s hands found their way unto Dean’s and together they tightened their grasp.
“It’s Dean. Something’s wrong with him.” Sam sighed and watched Dean close the door behind him.
Today, there weren’t just pictures. There was a really long message in perfect calligraphy starting from the top of his left hand to his elbow. That means my soulmate is right-handed, he thought with a hint of hope. He read it as it appeared on his pale skin:
Dean let the water drip down his back. He imagined Castiel sitting across him, with that calm resourceful look on his face. “I love you,” Dean murmured to the hallucination. “I miss you.”
Castiel became extremely confused. He had to admit, Lisa Bradbury was actually really nice to everyone. She was just too clingy and dependent, especially on Dean Winchester. “And we don’t like her because she /should/ be mean?”
Because this is Dean Winchester, you fool, Castiel thought miserably. You’re just a loser to them.
Castiel managed to get into class undetected through the back door while the teacher was looking away. First period never really took attendance like they were suppose to and he sat in the back, so it wasn’t like he was going to be called out or anything.
“I don't have much right.” Dean began, looking back from the door to the black haired teenager beside him. “I'm giving you the right now. Explain yourself.” Castiel invited him closer, but Dean rejected the polite offer. “I can't. Not yet.”
Castiel shrugged, wishing he had a sweatshirt like Kevin. The colorful drawings were crazily crawling up his arm as they spoke. How on Earth did no one see anyone drawing on their arm like this during school?
Dean leaned against his locker instead of storming off like Castiel thought he would. What was he doing? His curiosity got the best of him. Castiel set his books neatly in his locker on a self-constructed shelf and looked at the dusty floors on his way to the upset jock. “Is something wrong?” Dean didn’t meet his eyes.
“Anytime,” was the only incoherent reply.
“Piss off, dork. Dean’s busy. Doesn’t have time for losers like you.” One of the jocks stepped up beside Dean and slung an arm around his shoulder.
Castiel smiled a little and leaned down on the snowy porch beside Dean. “Are you alright?”
“He's like my uncle.” Dean explained, wandering around to the clearing where he had saved Castiel's life. He smiled and sat underneath a tree in the snow, not caring one bit that it would make his pants wet or anything. Castiel did the same and leaned against the tree, shifting uncomfortably because of its sharp bark. Dean rolled his eyes in amusement and gently pushed Castiel against his chest.
“Nope! Sorry.” The bell rang right when Charlie finished her sentence and she stood to throw away her trash. “Gotta go, Cas. See you tomorrow.” The two didn’t share any mutual classes for the remainder of the day so she decided to bid him farewell now. Kevin did the same and followed her.
“But you plan to, eventually, don’t you?” Charlie continued, crossing her arms in the passenger seat. “Of course. Well, unless something majorly bad happens. I’ve been planning to tell him at the dance, that’s for my twelfth clue, but I just…”
“Call me if it gets any worse. I’ll let you know when I’m on my way home.” Bobby replied, ending the line.
“Hey, Charlie, where’d you-” Castiel’s footsteps stopped as he watched Dean’s lips across Lisa’s passionately. It seemed like a strong kiss, even if that wasn’t true, and to him- it looked even worse. Castiel’s mind liked to work against him and twist things to deepen their meaning and make everything more dramatic than it needed to be.
“Sh! I don’t know how on Earth you figured this out, but know that you know you need to promise me you won’t say anything.”
“I don’t see any kids here,” Sam reported. Dean nodded and cracked his knuckles as Sam pointed to the picture frames across the room.
The letter read to Dean Winchester.
“Agh, Charlie! He does this all the time. I get one clue, and then he won’t talk to me at all until the next day after it’s too late and there’s already another scar. How can I possibly figure this out if he’s giving me such vague clues and then ignoring me??” Castiel angrily threw down his pen.
Castiel hid behind Gabriel the rest of the time, having been embarrassed for singing in front of everyone so dramatically. He honestly wasn’t sure how he followed through with it, especially after catching Dean Winchester’s eyes midway through. That’s where he felt his words choke up and his vocal range lower. It was okay, though, because Castiel thought he did well for someone who hadn’t performed in front of others before.
“Whoa, there, uhmm… I think you didn't get enough sleep last night or something. Why don't you just…” Dean smirked at his companion. “Why don't you just go kill yourself?”
“Cas, wait, you don’t understand, that was-” Dean panicked, in attempt to protest and work for his case, but Castiel didn’t want to hear any of the lying, filthy words that came out of Dean’s mouth. “I see exactly what that was, Winchester. I see. I know.” Dean approached him quickly and folded his hands over Castiel’s two. “No, you don’t… it’s not what it looks like.” Castiel shook his head, shivering from the sparklike touch. “I don’t care! I don’t want you!” He managed to break free and run down the halls, skipping past eavesdropping Charlie and all the way to the men’s bathroom. Of course, he didn’t hear the bell ring over the sound of his own crying. Why did this matter to him so much? It shouldn’t bother him as much as it was. This shouldn’t bother him, because he didn’t want Dean Winchester to be his soulmate.
Castiel took note of his cologne, the oil and car smells, and even his shampoo. But he tried to concentrate on the smell of the ink on his arms instead, reminding him that he would be cheating on his soulmate if he were to continue with this sort of behavior towards Dean Winchester.
(See the end of the chapter for
Charlie ran off as she saw Dean Winchester walking to his Impala. She pretended to fall and accidentally fell on the concrete. Dean looked surprised as he held out a hand to offer her assistance. Charlie grabbed his arm and yanked up his sleeve after she managed to regain her balance. Her eyes widened at what she saw all over his arm. Her eyes flickered to his green ones with a few small bruises across his face. Football player, green eyes with obvious signs of abuse, and drawings on his arms!! Oh, scars, too.
“Heya, Sammy. How was school?”
A/N: ACKKKKKK! This chapter pains me but it was also exciting to write. What'd you think? Getting kinda close there, huh? We've still got eight chapters. I wonder... ;)
“Go away.”
“No.” Dean answered honestly, keeping his eyes transfixed on the grass and snow below his feet. Castiel’s eyebrows showed the limitation of his anger. He had misinterpreted Dean’s reply. “I don’t think you’re crappy, or shitty, and you’re definitely not dumb.” Dean told him. “But…” Dean had finished typing on his phone and finished with, “you do seem like an outcast. According to Urban Dictionary, an outcast is - someone who doesn't belong in his main social area.”
Gabriel had been teasing Sam the entire time and Castiel had to admit, he felt a bit of jealousy toward his older brother. They got to be together without any problems and it just wasn’t fair. Then again, all he had to do was write DEAN WINCHESTER on his arm and he could have that same relationship.
But this time was different. Castiel’s fingertips had began as single colored designs, but as he looked up his arm, designs became more intricate. Go up even further and you’d see pictures of people, sometimes animals, with symbolism. It was a wonder how someone could draw these beautiful things.
The kiss didn’t last as long as it seemed to, but after Dean gave Lisa a comforting hug he eyed Castiel across the hallway with a surprised look on his face. “I’ll see you around, Lisa,” Dean managed to mumble. She walked away, putting on a strong face for her peers.
Dean was trying to stay loyal to Castiel, but the protectiveness he held for his brother Sam was a lot more to go on, and he couldn’t help but ask what Gabriel thought he was doing. “Who cares about us, what are you two doing?” Sam approached Dean with an amused smile an held out his clean arms, revealing the X that Gabriel had drawn on his own arm. Gabriel copied Sam’s action and Dean finally understood why they were so close.
Castiel felt numb. His mind, his body, everything just felt like it wasn’t there at all. He was thankful for his best friend Charlie and Kevin. The three were usually an inseparable trio but Castiel had a full plate and they hadn’t hung out much since the year began. Castiel was surprised when the two sat next to him at lunch.
“What if… what if angels are real? I mean, demons are, so surely the same goes for angels, right?” Sam’s pupils darted back and forth in thought. He spoke with his hands, contemplating the possibility of his question.
“Great! I'll call him now. Go pack your bags.” Sam dialed his soulmate’s phone number and walked into another room.
“What’s wrong?” Charlie asked as she started chomping on her burger, nearly getting ketchup all over her nerdy shirt.
Sam pulled into the driveway of a huge, white house with a white picket fence and a bright green lawn. Dean thought it looked beautiful. There seemed to be a pool out back, along with a smaller storage building and a lot of open yard area. Castiel was lucky to have had such a house.
“Oh come on, he doesn’t even know it’s me!” Dean exclaimed. “You can’t use that against me.”
“Yeah, okay, Bobby… If you say so.”
Castiel tilted his head. “What happened to ‘Cas’?”
“What is it, Samsquatch?” Gabriel asked softly, trying to raise the younger boy's mood but to no avail. His concerns were only met with choked sobs as Sam wrapped his long arms around the thin trickster from the front. He sniffled a little, just thinking his father was going to be gone forever. Gabriel led him to the Impala and crawled into the back with him.
'Who hates weekends?' That was horribly absurd. Castiel thought everyone loved weekends. Maybe not.
Castiel sat on the steps of the large entrance to his school, resting his head between his knees. He made sure to keep his earbuds in his ears, listening to a variety of music from country to pop to rock. Castiel caught a glimpse of his wrist and saw his soulmate’s calligraphy appearing slowly.
He didn't catch the boy's name. But he would be forever grateful and in extreme debt to that person. And in that moment, he realized he really did need saving.
Dean stood above the book and began to speak the incantation. He doubted that it would work, but Sam had enough faith for the both of them. Suddenly the wind picked up and the brothers could hear the roof shingles clatter outside. The sigils burned brightly and with a loud CRACK! everything went silent. Dean shielded his eyes from the blinding light and when he opened them again, his eyes dawned upon the most beautiful creature he’d ever seen.
Barely anyone knew that Castiel could sing. He did it well, and sometimes performed in choir at church, or sometimes with his family which had become more rare as the years got longer. He was a great actor and had often tricked the trickster (Gabriel) himself! But he didn’t like to brag about it and strayed from the subject. Today, he thought, he was going to step out of his comfort zone and have fun doing something he thought he’d never find himself doing.
It happened so quickly for Castiel that he didn't even have time to take a breath before plunging down, deeper and deeper into the cold darkness.
“I hate you.” And when he looked back, he wasn’t sure who he was talking to.
Castiel’s eyes were glazed, but he hadn’t taken any drugs. Even though he hated that boy, he couldn’t help but feel even more betrayed than before. He should’ve expected that much coming from Dean Winchester, the living eye candy everyone loved so much. But… if Dean really was his soulmate, why would he be kissing someone different? Didn’t he WANT Castiel to like him back?
“I'm fine.” Dean answered, wiping his brow. He staggered to stand, and Castiel helping him by providing a leaning post. “Let's get you inside.” Castiel opened the door and helped Dean inside, asking, “where are your medical first aid supplies?” Dean pointed to the bathroom. Castiel ran and grabbed a few things before coming back. He'd been sort of interested in medicine and learned a few things on his free time a while ago. Dean had already started pouring a bottle of liquid on his hand where glass had cut it as his father kicked him across the porch. He winced, and Castiel grabbed it out of his hand in worry.
But it no longer felt like home.
“I know.”
“Right. He’s been gone for over a year now. Dean’s a smart kid. He knows he’ll never have a soulmate. I dunno about you, but I’d be pretty damn upset.”
*~*~*~*
Suddenly he couldn't feel his own arms and legs frantically trying to help him gain balance. He could only see a few of his nervously twitching fingers through the murky water. When he glanced up at the sky, all he could see was the darkness growing lighter and lighter. The only bit of sky that he could see with the only eye he kept open was a small fragment, obscured by the snow which had accelerated in its fall over time.
“Seems like forever ago we were both here.” He laughed bitterly and looked upon the lake, watching as the moon reflected off the ice. Castiel took out the pen behind his ear and looked at his arm. He wrote the name DEAN WINCHESTER in small handwriting. He let the pen fall from his hands into the snow. Castiel linked their fingers together with a sad smile.
Dean didn't think he could handle the pressure of thinking about it. He didn't want this to happen to the only person on Earth he was meant to love. Castiel was strong but who's to say he's strong enough to handle this? Dean had always thought his father to be a strong man, yet he hadn't climbed out of the walls keeping him hostage to his own depressing thoughts.
“Alright, yeah, the guy’s a shitty outcast.”
“Is Lisa coming over later?” Sam asked. He liked the girl. She was always sweet to him and she thought he was like an adorable little puppy. “No, Sammy. Actually I’m breaking up with her.” Dean hesitated, only deciding to as he spoke. It would be better that way, maybe help Castiel figure him out.
It took everything to keep his position. He didn’t want to out himself in a situation where he’d be bound to anyone, although his image of Dean Winchester had improved significantly since the moment he met the teenager. It was much different, with all this knowledge. The feeling was similar to when you get your hands on someone’s diary and you have a whole list of opportunities in front of you to do whatever you want with them. You could expose the information or keep it a secret and let it tear you apart.
Sam threw his phone down at the couch and approached Dean’s door. He knocked a few times and took a step back, the way girl scouts do at an odd-looking house.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Dean responded to her, smirking. Castiel’s heart rate accelerated because he knew they were talking about him. “Come here, Novak. I know something’s going on between the two of you. I’m no guidance counselor, but I think you should sort it out now. I’ll leave two to it.”
Castiel’s angelic heart broke into several pieces. He wasn’t going to find his soulmate? That wasn’t fair! Anyone who didn’t find their soulmate past the age of twenty-one (which barely anyone was unlucky about this), lost the ability to see colors. Their skin turned an ugly grayish color too. He wasn’t ready to face that possibility.
“I should’ve told you,” Dean cried onto Castiel’s chest. “I’m sorry, Cas, I’m so fucking sorry. It’s all my fault.” It only got colder and darker as the night continued. He only moved when he was sure he couldn’t feel his fingers. “I love you more than you’ll ever know.”
“Kinda,” Castiel responded genuinely, resting his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
“Ah, having soulmate troubles?” Charlie asked, looking across the table at Kevin who had just taken a seat. He didn’t eat much and had his nose in a book that said ‘History’. Castiel knew he’d have some sort of test coming up and also knew better than to bother him.
“How?”
Lucifer nodded, looking to the sky. “I like to think of life like a sunset. When the day is done and we’ve all made plenty of mistakes, the sunset gives us a chance to look back and see the beauty of them. It gives us the opportunity to go fix it in the morning.”
Castiel nonchalantly shook his head a few times for good measure. “No, I don't think so.”
“But.... Dean, I don’t blame you.” Castiel had always been a very understanding, compassionate person. Despite the horrible feeling he experience when people called him names or played pranks, he was quick to forgive. However he wasn’t as quick to forget. He would remember how Dean Winchester treated him for a long time, if not forever, even though the jock had apologized and admitted that what he did was wrong.
Charlie rolled her eyes playfully. “Yeah, okay.”
Castiel expected a confession, but he supposed it was only the eighth day. Maybe it just need to take time. He was angry with Dean anyways, even if the jerk wasn't his soulmate. It was probably a good thing that Dean left, because then he wouldn't have to deal with him…. or the feelings that came along with him.
Dean shook his head, “This is Charlie. She’s hella gay.” He assured his little brother. “Oh, okay.” Dean grinned and looked fondly at Sam. He didn’t know about anything that was going on with Dean, especially not the self harm. Dean did everything he could possibly do to keep Sam away from his father, meaning he would frequently take him to Bobby’s- a friend of his father’s. Bobby was like their uncle. But Sam knew a lot more than he let on. Of course, he’d forever make sure that Dean felt like he was protecting him no matter what Sam was really facing in his life. The two really cared about each other THAT much.
Life was alright for Castiel, most of the time. It was a lot better than others. His soulmates’ life, Dean’s life… it was a worse hell than he could ever imagine, he was sure of it. But that didn’t make him feel any better about himself. Jumping the bridge seemed like a pretty good idea, he figured, and it wouldn’t be too painful.
“I’m Agent Giles, this is Agent Ickler.” Dean flashed the badge and gave the Sheriff a charming smile. “He’s an intern,” Dean clarified as the Sheriff looked from the badge to Sam’s face.
3. Before anyone says anything I would just like to say that I know they're OOC. It's sort of a given, but that's alright. I'm trying to stick to their personalities, but when they're teens, they've got alterations. Keep this in mind if you find yourself thinking that one of them would never do something like that.
Charlie patted Dean’s shoulder and started walking inside the school. “Well he may be upset about that.” Charlie smiled and left Dean alone outside with the other cheerleaders and sports teams who usually hung out before they went inside. Castiel walked right past Dean on his way inside, completely ignoring him. Dean felt a bit offended. What had he done?
“Possibly,” Sam admitted, hovering over a fragile-looking woman. She wore a cross necklace over her breast. He leaned down and held it between his fingers. “Didn’t that article say most of the bodies were found in churches?”
“Dad’s going to die.”
Castiel suspiciously darted his eyes around the area, looking for any sign of a teenage boy. But there were none. 'I do like this book. You’re a stalker, then?'
“Do you- do you have anything to drink?” Dean asked quietly, hoping Uriel would know what he meant. He nodded and said, “you may visit the kitchen anytime, Dean. I only ask that you do not drink anything alcoholic.” Dean did not respond and dismissed the older Novak with the flick of his wrist.
Still, Castiel knew above all that the bridge was the place to go.
'Oh, and my drawings don’t bother you, do they?'
He sighed, throwing the apple into the trash can. He threw the entire basket of rotten fruits away, tossing a few cans of soda there too. As he went into the living room, or rather; sulking room, he noticed several beer bottles lying on the side tables and the floor. There was trash all over the place. It hadn’t been this clear to him before, but it got him thinking… he was just like his father.
It's funny how the world can change in such a short amount of time. The light you cherish so deeply can turn black and the eruptions of laughter and happiness can fade into nothing in just a few seconds.
“I dunno. Guess we’ll find out when we get there.”
“Cassie, you’re here!” Gabriel exclaimed, approaching Castiel with the signature smile he provided everyone. “Yes, Gabe, you know I’ve been looking forward to this play for a while now.” Gabriel nodded in understanding; the two had conversed about it before, but had not mentioned it recently.
It didn’t matter, because to Castiel, that was enough. “It wasn’t… Oh..”
“Because.” Dean went on to further explain what he told Castiel about how his father didn’t approve of liking the same sex nor the idea of soulmates. “So, see? You just can’t say anything.”
“No.”
'Aren’t you concerned you’ll lose the ability to see color?'
“Sorry, I just, erm…” Castiel couldn’t keep his eyes off the seemingly increasing number of followers surrounding Dean Winchester. “Wanted to talk to you,” Castiel wasn’t able to get much else out, nearly choking at the end of his sentence.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean mumbled, throwing the towel to the ground. He didn't object because he had already wanted to go there. He wondered if the spiritual connection they shared would be strengthened if Dean lived where Castiel used to. The Novaks’ house was big enough for three dozen people. Surely it'd be okay for the Winchesters to spend the summer there?
Is this what would happen to Castiel if he took his own life?
“Yeah, apparently I’m so much of an outcast that even my soulmate has to pretend to want me.” The message came out wrong. Castiel knew that, but he didn’t bother to fix it. He seemed to have struck a nerve. “It’s funny, really, because for a second I actually thought someone wanted me, but you’ve helped me realize that no one does.”
P.S. The way this worked out sorta added another chapter. I was going to do one clue per chapter but oh whale
“Welcome. Hey, Cas?”
“Fine.” Sam left without another word and went into the kitchen, searching every last cabinet for some food to eat.
Of course Castiel felt bad about rejecting his supposed soulmate. He didn't want to hurt Dean Winchester, or lose him. But he didn't want to be bound to him, either. That didn't keep him from staring at his wrist all day, wishing calligraphy or drawings or just SOMETHING would appear. It was the cleanest his arm had been since the drawings first began.
'I’d like to just say your name. Scream it, even,' Castiel thought miserably. He only had one more year before he was shipped off to college. Thankfully, the government almost always made sure to send soulmates down the same educational path.
“Around $500, sir,” Dean answered with a hitch in his breath. Castiel saw the other shadow rise, and heard Sam’s younger voice. “I’ve got $50 from shoveling driveways,” He contributed to the situation.
“He knows I’ve dated other people,” Dean retorted.
For a moment, the entire world felt still. It felt as if the ice had crept upon the people, turning them into figurines. He couldn’t see anyone else, but he wasn’t really looking. The trees looked like they were doused with foam, or rather liquid glitter and the sparkle of the snow that had begun to fall amazed Castiel. He didn’t want to breathe and take away the magic of the silence, but the cold air came as a refreshment to his lungs.
“Sammy, what’s wrong? What is it?”
The sound of apologetic crying filled the air. Dean's cheeks were stained with endless tears and his hands had clenched the bedsheets long ago. Castiel decided finally to be of assistance. It was only because Dean had fallen silent, and in Castiel's experience that was never a good thing. He placed his hands onto Dean's strained shoulders and pressed down, almost to support his weight. Dean jumped a little and then relaxed under Castiel's touch.
“That’s, uhm…” Dean trailed off, trying to come up with some half-assed excuse to tell his brother. Instead, his instincts told him to shelter the truth. To become the monster he always knew he’d been. His eyes narrowed as he walked over to Sam and snatched the blade from his hands. “That’s none of your damn business.”
Castiel grabbed a pen off his desk and began scribbling on his own arm below the message.
But that was before he felt the pierce of green eyes right through his soul. Someone's he'd seen before. His hand felt warm, stingingly and painfully warm. His eyes had already begun to shut. He gave up on seeing seconds after seeing the green light.
He was surprised to see Lucifer sit beside him. “Castiel, why aren’t you inside? You’ll freeze to death out here.” Lucifer’s voice was laced with mild concern.
“No, Sammy. You stay here, okay? I need to do this on my own.” Dean shook his head and got to his feet. The letter, crumpled in Dean’s pocket, felt like a piece of Castiel was still with him. Dean hadn’t known Castiel long enough to be gifted any of his personal items, so this letter was all he had.  It lightened his heart but also burdened his mind like a bag of bricks. He knew he needed to get out of this house and go for a ride in the Impala,
(See the end of the chapter for
Curiosity pricked at him. He’d seen so many people ice skate on lakes, and he thought it beautiful. Just being able to stand on the surface would be a dream come true. And why couldn’t he? The lake froze in the winter.
Sam’s face paled and he dropped the phone, leaving it to hang by its twisty, curly cord against the old, dusty wall. His eyes were wide and scared, making Dean immediately worry for him.
“Play Tryouts 3:00 to 4:00 in the High School Gym!” Castiel heard over the announcements. He smiled, planning immediately to not leave school as early as he usually did. He thought about asking Charlie to try out, but she refused because “the girls were too obsessed with men.” Castiel had rolled his eyes at her and suggested that she join AV Club. She, of course, had already joined and laughed at him.
“Father, do you have an idea what may have happened to these people?” Sam poked, trying to maintain his respect for the much older man.
“Well, it’s complicated,” Dean started with a sigh He laid his head on the steering  wheel, careful not to honk the horn. “I don’t think I’m strong enough to handle pain at school and at home. I didn’t want them to turn against me.”
Castiel's heart pounded furiously in his chest. Am I supposed to answer that?, he thought to himself. His anxiety levels had raised sky high and he hid behind Dean, using his hoodie to his advantage. The football players thankfully got disgusted and laughed it off before leaving. Castiel was surprised that they had left so quickly without any bullying whatsoever. Dean turned around and wrapped his arms around the smaller teen. “I'm sorry, Cas…” He murmured, pressing his nose to the crook of Castiel's neck. “But I choose you. They're not my friends anymore. It was an effective way to get them gone at least.”
“I may have followed you as you followed them. You were acting suspicious and I figured I should tag along.” Gabriel admitted, rubbing his head with a cheesy smile. Castiel didn’t get to respond, since he heard a loud noise inside. His attention towards the window, where he saw a shadow from across the wall. There was a man with a beer bottle. And then there was Dean, blocking Sam from view.  “Did you get the money?” A gruff voice asked, Castiel assuming it was the one with the beer bottle. “Yes, sir, I worked fifty-four hours for it.” Castiel identified Dean’s voice, but it was much shakier than usual. Castiel didn’t know it could sound so frightened.
'Okay! Thank you.' Castiel grinned from ear to ear. With a few hints, he’d surely be able to find his soulmate! Things were beginning to look a little brighter. The next piece of writing appeared much slower, but it was beautiful handwriting nonetheless.
The brothers pulled up and got out of the car, somewhat eager to see the bodies found in the church. They straightened their jackets and briskly made their way inside.
The man noticed Dean’s wincing and twisted his arm, nearly breaking it to see what was causing him so much pain. “Take off the damn sweatshirt you filthy piece of trash.” Dean didn't obey. Castiel knew he wanted to keep his scars a secret.
“Castiel, stop moping around and help Michael get the food like a good son!” Castiel’s father told him. He didn’t quite see why his parents had to be such jerks. If he wasn’t forced to eat, he would’ve just stayed in his room for the remainder of the night. He wasn’t going to eat more than a few bites. He could still taste the bitter ice water that littered his lungs.
“Go away, Charlie.”
He skipped his classes for the remainder of the day, staying alone in the bathroom. Charlie managed to find him after a while, and didn’t hesitate to open the men’s bathroom door. “Oh my God, Castiel, you’re a mess!” She offered her hand, to which Castiel took. She led him outside, giving him a tissue along the way out the school doors. “You’re desperately in love, you know that?”
Castiel flushed the brightest he’d ever known to be possible when he realized he had written what he was thinking.
Castiel felt sick to his stomach. How could he possibly think like that? He didn’t want anyone else. Castiel just wanted the person he’s meant to be with, like everyone else. Why couldn’t it be simpler than this?
A/N: Hey guys!! I know this was short, but I was just too excited to get this story rolling some more. I think the next three chapters will be much longer so it'll all work itself out in the end, I promise. Speaking of the end, after three chapters it'll be over! Eeek, I'm excited to finish a story since most of mine have been unfinished ideas. Anyways, kudos? Or at least thoughts about the chapter or the story in general? Thanks! Until next time :3
“No way!! Tell me all about him.” Charlie looked as though she’d just discovered a pot of gold. After that, Castiel explained everything from the clues to the cutting, leaving Charlie with a frown on her face. “You’ve gotta find him. You both need each other. Why don’t you talk to him now?”
“What if I guess your name wrong?” Castiel wrote.
“Okay, Cas. I love my car, it’s pretty great, if you figure me out I’ll take you on a date.”
Castiel didn’t hear her. He was too busy counting Dean’s freckles. There were at least sixty three, but Charlie interrupted his counting with, “Oh my God, you’ve got the hots for Mr. Sexy, don’t you?” Charlie almost screamed, excitement sparkling in her eyes. “What? No! The douche called me a shitty outcast the other day,” Castiel admitted with a sigh.
“What? How do you know?”
HAPPY EASTER FOR THOSE WHO CELEBRATE!!
“What the actual fuck does that mean?” Lucifer grunted, playing with his pen that had a fuzzy eraser top. He looked up from his usual seat on the long, narrow table. The board was covered with Michael’s notes, the darned geek, but there was a little extra space that Gabriel had written “mikey sux balls” throughout the meeting that went unnoticed by only Michael himself. Castiel found it rather childish, and wished his brothers were a bit more mature- but not quite as adult-ish as Michael. His sister Anna had managed to escape the meeting, running off with her no good friends.
Dean Winchester,
Of course, he chose a seat at the back of the class and hid behind a book. “Mr. Novak, would you mind demonstrating how to put on a condom for the class?” Castiel almost choked on his own spit.
'Listen. I’ll continue with the clues, and I’m serious about  that stupid dance. I’m being forced to go, so I want to make the most of it. But don’t try to find me if you don’t know who I am. It’ll be too late.'
But his soulmate didn’t reply to his question. Instead, the beautiful drawings laced up his arms grew lighter in color, leaving only the slightest but possible visible amount of design.
‘One day, some time, I know you’ll come to see how much you mean to me.  I will be here for you, always.’
“What?” Bobby answered irritably.
*~*~*~*~*
Letting out a small grunt, he took notes from what he saw on the board, which was quite a distance away, but he could still see it due to his extremely reliable senses.
“I have the right. It wasn't my fault your mother was killed by a demon. No, it was your brother's fault. The damn demon came to poison him, anyways.” The man, Sam and Dean's father, Castiel guessed, was really angry. But Castiel wasn't sure what the hell he was talking about. Demons? Those weren't even real. Maybe it was code for something.
“That's because I can't see colors,” Dean retorted. “I haven't for a whole year.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes suspiciously. “Charlie, I’m not an idiot.”
Castiel awkwardly shuffled into the passenger seat, not feeling a shotgun vibe. He didn't feel like he had the right to ride up front. He thought about squishing in the back, but Dean's glare told him not to.
*~*~*~*
“Oh, does he know you still are?”
Castiel frowned and kept scrubbing. After about an hour and a half of cleaning, the Impala was returned to its former shine. “Oh, Baby. You look great.” Dean patted the top of his car, wiping his forehead with his sweatshirt sleeve. “Thanks again, Novak.”
Dean was dressed in a long sleeve dark green shirt and wore no sports jacket nor any school spirit gear like the others. He wore ripped jeans (ones that looked super unintentional but he managed to pull it off better than anyone) and a necklace with a weird face on it. Castiel stared at it, noticing Dean Winchester’s toned torso while doing so. He scolded himself, knowing that he should be focusing on finding his soulmate and saving a life rather than staring down living eye candy like a vulture.
“Wow, Dean. Didn’t know you were so gay.” Charlie laughed.
“Hey, Charlie…?”
Dean kept his lips sealed tight and observed the footprints that had been in the snow for a couple days. He remembered the lake incident and wanted to say something but decided against it. Castiel didn’t know what to say, either. It was only the truth.
'Dangerous? I’m worried about you. But I don’t know what to say… I already love you.'
Finally, after he was positive everyone had left the house, he crept to the kitchen for a beer. He opened the fridge and took one, gulping it down. It tasted bitter but Dean eagerly grabbed another and gulped it down too. He grabbed a few more, but not enough to get him drunk. Then he wandered around the house, looking at the handles of every door. Some had gathered dust, and some hadn't. Almost every door down the hallway in the back of the house had gathered dust except one, which held a handprint.
Anyone that sided with Norris was sure to make Dean Winchester’s life absolute Hell if they ever found a reason to, which always seemed to root from bullying. Seven or eight players crowded around Dean, glaring at him for insulting Norris.
Dean chuckled under his breath and nodded somewhat reluctantly. “‘Course, Sammy. I promise.”
Castiel's eyes widened when he realized it was still lying on him. “I don't know.” He took off the coat, revealing his clothes that were only half dry. “Why are your clothes wet?” His father asked, jumping into the conversation. “I fell in the snow.” Castiel fibbed, crossing his fingers behind his back. “Yeah, so I have to go change.” He tried to use any excuse to go to his room.
He paced down the halls long before his classes began and took more than one “bathroom” break during a few. It was really starting to bother him and Castiel wondered how he could possible end all his madness. Why, talk to Dean, of course. Yes, that seemed like the perfect choice.
He was solving the biggest problem of his life right now and he was starting to not care about finishing his math homework. Therefore, his gradings had dropped to Bs and Cs instead of As, earning him a visit from his teacher. “Mr. Novak, are you doing alright? You seem rather off lately,” the teacher walked up to him and set a paper with a red 69 underlined on the desk. “No, sir, my head isn’t in it,” Castiel answered truthfully with a sad smile.
Either way, he knew he only wanted things he couldn’t have, and Charlie managed to snap him out of his daze by shaking his firm shoulders. “Dean! The hell?” Dean shook his head and smiled at her, taking a few steps toward the stairs of the school. “Sorry, Charlie, I gotta go. Lisa’s waiting for me.”
“Dean, you're covered in bruises and you've got that fiery look in your eyes. You've done something. What is it?” Castiel stared him down.
“What kind of wrong, boy?”
“Y’know, Dean, there isn't any food here. I think it would do us both some good to get away from this place. I'm sure I could get Gabe to let us stay over there for a little bit.” Sam honestly still hated the look of the place and had been getting flashbacks of his father ever since he stepped foot into it. He was not about to let Dean become a depressed alcoholic, anyways. Being at the Novak’s might prove to be a little better than he'd originally planned because Dean would feel more at home there.
“Well, nice or not, I haven’t seen her without Dean Winchester by her side,” Castiel commented in observation. Charlie nodded and took another bite. “She’s got it all. Popularity, smarts, friends, love, sports-”
Then Sam walked in alongside Gabriel, holding swinging hands as they peeked through the door. “Ummm… I told you so.” Gabriel laughed and pointed at the two on the couch. Castiel furrowed his eyebrows.  Gabriel must have discussed them with Sam at one point.  And wait… why was Gabriel holding hands with Sam?  Castiel normally would've asked them or showed some sort of interest but he didn't want to leave his position.  He didn't want Dean to assume he cared about anything else at the moment besides their own breathing?
“Who's coat is that?”
Dean hadn't been paying attention until his name had been spoken. “Err...uhm… yeah. Appreciate it. A lot.” He wasn't very convincing to any of the Novak brothers but he was too busy exploring the house to care. His immediate thought was why hadn't Castiel ever invited him to stay?
Confused, Castiel turned his head and looked at them both.
“That’s okay, I don’t need the details… yet.” Charlie sighed and stared into Dean Winchester’s eyes. “Why would you want to hurt yourself?” She wanted to understand why the jock would ever do such a thing, especially when it seemed so unlikely. She also felt bad and wanted to help him to the best of her ability. “You’re popular and charming to most ladies, all the guys want to BE you, why the hell would you do something like that?”
He wanted to say something sweet, or explain his reasoning but he didn't know what exactly to say. So he didn't say anything and nuzzled Dean's neck. The other Dean seemed embarrassed at Castiel's gesture but he enjoyed the attention.
Castiel didn’t speak. There wasn’t a point, especially since he knew he’d wasted too many words that day. He sat on the edge of the bridge, looking out into the vast waters and wondered how he could be in charge of two lives. Not only his own shitlife, but his soulmates’, too! He didn’t want to have so much responsibility thrust on his shoulders without warning. Now if someone died he’d consider it all his fault, and he’d likely fall into crippling depression.
“Why not?” Castiel continued, trying to meet Dean’s eyes or at least get the boy to look at him. “I’m not putting my… friend in danger. It’s risky business, Cas, you could die. I won’t allow it.”
“You… whAT?” Charlie asked, her eyes widening in surprise. Was it just a joke? Surely. “Oh, ummm…” Dean wracked through his thoughts for some sort of excuse for his innocent brother’s slip up. “He’s talking about video games. We kill monsters in video games.” Dean nodded and pressed his lips together, as did Sam.
Castiel nearly fell off the chair but successfully landed on the ground with a huff. Dean stood behind him, bent his legs, and lifted Castiel up onto his shoulders. The smaller student was blushing beyond belief but kept his composure and hung the streamer. Dean walked to the other side of the room, streamer still in Castiel’s hands and he hung the other side.
“Really? Chick-flick much?” Dean asked in a monotone voice, quite unamused at the nerd’s words. “Well, as of now, I’m pretty sure Cas hates my guts. I wouldn’t be sure of yourself.”
Castiel walked past the row of lockers as students fled to them, putting away their books for lunch. Dean Winchester slammed his shut, making Castiel jump in surprise at the loud noise. Dean’s eyebrows had creased and his eyes were as sharp as his jawline. Upon further inspection, he noticed several marks across Dean’s face.
Dean Winchester smelled like many things.  He smelled like car oil, smoke, and iron, but there was also another scent that lingered on his blue and green flannel. He smelled of crystal waters and sweet whiskey. He really smelled like the outdoors, specifically pine needles and the earth. When Castiel really, really, thought about it…and when he closed his eyes, he imagined he was laying on top of Dean in the woods, with ratifying mist and soft earth below them only complimented by the trees and flowers around them. Castiel was starting to wonder what he smelled like and if Dean found it attractive.
Dean only focused on the game and planned strategies on how he could score. Of course, he was happy to have so many people cheering for him in the stands, including the cheerleaders, but there was only one person he really wanted the support of.
This trip was in pursuit of a couple of mysterious victims who turned up dead in churches surrounding the small town of St. Paris, Ohio with their eyes burnt out of their skulls. Sam accompanied Dean, much to Gabriel’s dismay, as he had for the past month.
Lucifer, the troublemaker, was sitting at the table with headphones, ignoring everyone else. Michael was still being responsible, helping his parents get things together for supper. The most childish brother Gabriel was writing excitedly on his wrist, and Castiel watched his face light up every time he paused to read the new writing. He wondered who Gabe’s soulmate was. Then he looked to the other side of the room and saw the door, which was slightly ajar. He figured it was simply for fresh air. The last person he noticed was Anna, the only girl (besides his mom). But she, too, was writing all over her arms.
“Uh, Novak, listen…”
Castiel guessed about 20 minutes were left for lunch, so he decided to walk on the surface. That would’ve been plenty of time.
Dean thought about everything. He thought about how lost he would be if his father actually died that night. Sure, his father had beaten him, but it was his only way to stop grieving his wife's death. Dean had trouble blaming him at times like this. His father had loved his mother so much that when she died, he drove himself insane. Had his vision gone gray? His skin hadn't. Or, maybe… When Dean took a closer look, his father's skin did have a gray tint to it but nothing too noticable.
“Well, I doubt he’ll figure this clue out, I’m beginning to see that he’s a little oblivious. The next one’s about Baby here,” Dean chuckled in amusement and patted the dash of the car. “I figured everyone knows I’m in love with this car, but there’s tons of guys who take pride in their cars. I’m not looking to make this too easy for him, I still need to see how far he’s willing to go.” Dean paused for a while, dusting off the radio and then continued, “I’m not going to risk it with my dad or possibly ruin both our lives if I don’t think it’s going to be worth it.”
*~*~*
Scrambling through his morning routine, he nervously skipped a shower and grabbed an apple on the way out the door. He knew he had to be at school at 7 o’clock so he was only about seven minutes late. Castiel glanced at the watch on his wrist, which turned to 7:13 when he blinked. The watch had been his grandfather’s, and it meant a lot to him, but he rarely wore it. There were too many ink drawings on his arms to be observed, but when he woke up without any, he decided to wear the watch.
His lips met hers, mixing with salty tears, and she kissed back. Dean knew it didn’t have a spark, of course there wasn’t one, but there was almost the reassurance of peace. Whatever the case, he was grateful for the kiss because it helped push away the guilt. He was grateful for the absolution.
*~*~*~*
“Assbutts?” Dean laughed, ruffling his dark blonde/brown hair.
“Sorry, Novak, but it is.”
His head bobbed forward and he felt a warm hand touch his cheek gently. His eyes were frozen shut but he wished he could open them. He wanted to see who had been inches away from his face.
“Well, he’s seein’ black and white, ain’t he?” Bobby asked, Sam replying with a mumbled yes. “That boy, Cassiel-”
With a frown, Castiel looked down into the water at his own reflection. His hand caressed his cheek, wishing that someone else might do the same, and stared into his own eyes. He saw bright green ones staring back at him. He grabbed a loose stone from the side of the bridge and threw it down at his face, splashing away the emerald eyes.
“Who, that jackass?”
“Right, Cas...tiel, get off me,” Dean hissed, more like a dragged sigh, and nudged the other teenager out of the way. Castiel looked a little upset, maybe because his moment had been ruined or maybe because he felt embarrassed by the fact that he had to be forced away from Dean Winchester.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Peace out, bitches!” Charlie gave her signature sign and left the Impala, leaving Sam and Dean to drive back home where he could guarantee they wouldn’t be greeted with a smile.
Dean Winchester stopped in his tracks when he noticed Castiel. His eyes flickered from feature to feature until finally he met the boy’s eyes. Dean immediately looked away and try to ignore the blue-eyed boy.
Castiel wanted to smash a book into his face. Just to show him that he was real, and he wasn’t just hurting himself. Castiel felt the pain too, like he hadn’t before. It was as real as he was, but his soulmate surely didn't know that. Maybe Castiel should enlighten him.
Castiel’s heart rate accelerated from what it had been already. The loving statement had made him extremely nervous, but he didn’t want Dean to know. “I want you too, Dean.” He leaned in until he could feel Dean's breath on his cheek.
'I don’t mean to put you in this situation. But… It takes away the pain. I am not supposed to talk to you, my father has forbidden it. Before I let you risk your life by getting close to me, I need to know how much you care. If you can’t figure out my name, you must not care. Not enough. And for this, I need all you’ve got. Because the people close to me always get hurt. I don’t want you to be hurt too. I can’t fall in love with you. Soulmates? Do you honestly believe we’re meant to be together?'
“That’s nOT ENOUGH!” The voice had screamed, causing Sam to shrink back in what Castiel assumed to be fear. Dean stood strong, almost straighter than before, and lowered his gaze. “I’m sorry, sir. It’s all they would pay me. The rent is only five hundred dollars. We would still have fifty for food and stuff.” Dean mumbled.
Neither one of the two knew what was happening in that moment, but everyone watching sure as hell knew.
Dean was fuming with such anger he had used as a coping mechanism. He often turned pain or sadness into anger, and when he did, it didn’t end well. With one strike, he pulled a dagger out of his coat pocket and stabbed himself in the heart. Or, at least, his doppelganger. “Damn it,” he cursed to himself, watching the body fall into the snow.
Dean Winchester acted like he had it all under control but underneath that tough facade Castiel knew exactly what he was really feeling. Dean Winchester was scared and nervous. “How dare you-”
Castiel walked past the football field, seeing how cold and dead the grass looked. It reminded him of himself. It didn’t snow too often around town, it was mostly fall-like weather in the winter. A few times, it snowed, but that was pretty rare. Castiel thought the snow was beautiful. He wished it would snow more often, and maybe end the football season sooner. That would make the jocks less mean and egotistical.
“Yes.” Castiel nodded and watched Dean walk to the truck, pulling it open and accidentally getting paint on his hands. Castiel touched the side of the car, too, and didn’t realize that the paint from Dean’s hands had appeared on his own. When Dean realized the possibility of what was happening, he nervously cast a glance at the other, who didn’t seem to notice, and looked back at the car. “No, no- don’t come over here.” Dean told Castiel as he approached the trunk. Dean surveyed the display of monster hunting weapons all across the trunk. He slammed it shut after he finally found the towels and spray he kept for cleaning purposes.
Charlie was waiting for him inside the lunchroom, so Castiel eased into his usual seat on the bench-like table. “You look tense. What's wrong?” She asked, pushing food in front of him. Castiel nudged it to the other side of the table and frowned. “I think… Charlie, I know who it is.”
“Okay, well, I should go.” Charlie scribbled something on a piece of paper lying in the Impala and handed it to Dean. “Call or text me if you need anything.” Dean nodded respectfully. “Thank you so much, Charlie. See ya tomorrow.”
“Dammit, Cas. You don’t get it. My entire freaking life, everyone I have ever loved or cared for has died at my hands. There’s nothing left for me, nothing besides you and Sam. He used to be my only reason for living, but that was because he needed me. I was always there to keep him safe like our father couldn’t. But now he’s got your brother to take care of him. I’m not needed anymore.”
“Thank you, Dean.” Castiel sighed in relief when the hunk of muscle set him down.
Sam’s question broke the silence. Dean hadn’t heard the name for months and it stirred within him. Yes, that was the reason. He was missing his soulmate. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Lisa looked at Charlie when she began talking. “But he’s going to keep trying, because this person is meant to be with him. So, is there something you need to say, Dean?” Charlie was on the edge of her seat, feeling both excitable and nervous about the situation.
The two approached the door of the white house and were greeted by a burly police officer. “Good afternoon, Sheriff. We’re here to take a look at the scene.” Dean got the fake FBI badge from his pocket and Sam quickly followed suit beside him.
