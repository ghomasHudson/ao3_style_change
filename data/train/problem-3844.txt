“D’you know everyone here?” Dean asks around a mouthful of beef and bun.
As the last dregs of his coffee are emptied onto his tongue, music starts to play from the wireless speaker on the side table. Cas must have connected to it with his phone. What Dean assumes are flutes and xylophones play a plucky holiday melody to which Cas’s voice comes warbling up the stairs in accompaniment.
His gut clenches painfully at the idea that maybe he’s losing it, that maybe he’ll have to deal with everything utterly alone and breaking down on top of it all.
Cas shifts his attention between the two Winchesters, unsure how to interpret their banter as they stare each other down for a few seconds, until Dean eventually cracks into laughter and Sam follows. Dean does drop Cas’s hand at that point and pulls Sam into a firm hug. “I missed you, man.”
“So? My friend Cheri and I were just introduced yesterday and we already had a great time.”
Dean’s not sure which is worse.
If only.
“So, trying out a secret family recipe? Special occasion?”
“My dad dragged us all over the place for his fights. Traveling is great and all, but it’s better when it’s done on your own terms, if you ask me.” Dean observes the colorful doodles Jack is making on his new sheet of paper. “Stability is important for a kid. You’re doing good by this one, Cas. He’s safe. He doesn’t need to worry about where his next meal is coming from. And he’s got a reliable role model.”
Dean’s not sure what his problem is. Sam has never given him a reason to think he would be anything other than accepting of Dean’s relationship with another man. Hell, he probably figured out a long time ago that Dean is about as straight as a thin rubber ruler.
He was distantly aware that he was crying, but it was dissociative, the way a passenger looking out the window of a moving car might focus on thinking of their destination but not the wheels and metal pushing them forward through space.
” he pleads out of earshot of the cell phone’s mic.
“I thought you’d be, you know,
Dean blew a drunken raspberry of a sigh past his lips. “Well, we hit a roadblock. Looks like we might— might be S.O.L. on getting you back this time. Like, for real. I hope you’re at least— at least at rest.” He clenched the neck of the bottle so hard he wondered if it might shatter. That would be poetic, wouldn’t it? To have all the little pieces fall around him like all the little shards jumbled up inside.
Cas flaps a hand in dismissal as he takes a sip. “I get a supplier discount. My brother helps me collect the honey at the end of the summer season and takes a portion of it to local breweries like this one. They ferment it into the fine drink you see before you.”
Castiel groans, giving up his pursuit of Gabe and sprawling his upper half across his table in defeat while he’s subjected to the remainder of this conversation.
“Hold up, Cas. He can keep his feathers on until I get back with some clothes for him, at least.”
Dean softens and finally looks up. “Don’t be. You didn’t do anything wrong.”
it, though.
!” Dean curses, swinging a fist into a loose board. Splinters fly off the plank and he drops his phone as a piece embeds itself between his wrist and his watch. “Oh, son of a bitch!”
“It’s bee time?” Jack asks.
Dean grins, his eyes sparkling. “I don’t have class again until noon tomorrow,” he says slowly, eyebrows waggling. “We could do breakfast, instead.”
Cas shakes his head with a little laugh. “I meant the
“Deaaaannn, it’s Jack, silly.”
“Yes.” Cas nods. “But Anna was alive when she severed her ties to the Host. Her essence was reborn in a human body and her grace absorbed within the earth. The angel whose grace now lives in this fledgling made a painful sacrifice so that the forces of Heaven would not diminish. And we have been chosen as guardians.”
His breath caught on the inhale. He couldn’t say it. Castiel wasn’t there to hear the message and still Dean couldn’t say it. What the hell did he have left to lose at this point? Better not to ask that question, he figured.
“I mean, I probably shouldn’t tell you this, but dude, have you
Cas does the squinty thing. “Dean, are you sure this is safe to consume? I wasn’t aware sustenance could feel emotion.”
moment at all.
“Alright, kiddo. Settle down before you fall down. Let’s go inside,” Gabriel says to the child-shaped halo above him.
drunk, the voice—
“I would like it to be time for dinner
Inside, Jack has dutifully set the gift on the short folding table Castiel had set up for that purpose. Hyped up, Jack now leaps between the couch cushions, attention focused on the ancient television in front of him which he has turned to cartoons.
“If you’re asking what the surprise is, that would defeat the point of a surprise. And if what you’re really asking is
Everything in Dean wants to shut down, to black out, to pinch himself so hard he wakes up. The logical part of him says he needs to leave and call the cops. But the impulsive fight-not-flight side of his brain, the one honed by years of lessons learned from his father’s impromptu training sessions (usually after John had gone down in a match, tipped up the bottle, and dragged Dean into the empty ring to teach him how to defend himself and his brother) spurs him to draw the knife from his back pocket and scope out the battered remains of his new home.
He doesn't even want to think it lest it be jinxed...but he’s
“Are you sure?”
” with a partying smiley face. Castiel types slowly, but he wants to make sure his messages are accurate and free of typos. Scarcely has the address been sent when another message comes through.
“Jack, you know you’re not supposed to jump on the couch. Sit down, please,” Castiel chides.
Aghast, Dean puts a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “Cas, buddy, you have some catching up to do.” When he gets no reaction to the informal nickname, Dean decides he’s going to keep it.
” Dean rolls his eyes affectionately as he ascends the front steps. He’s normally the one to play mother hen, but it’s cute that Cas cares.
Sam reached out a hand. “Hang on. Billie once said she would toss me and Dean into the Empty when we died. Doesn’t that mean humans can stay there just fine?”
!” Castiel surmises she’s looking at the name on the screen.
They stumble into the dim room, untouched by the break-in and kept Spartan clean. Though there is nothing to trip on, they still collapse onto the bed in an ungraceful, tangled heap of limbs and half-shed clothing. Cas climbs over Dean’s lap and helps him out of his shirt, the button-up and Cas’s sweater having already been discarded somewhere in the hall.
“Please, you go ahead. About that phone call…?” he prompts, a smug grin that he can’t stop starting to pull at his features.
“Er, yes. They do,” he answers.
to stay. Mouth dry, Dean averts his eyes and picks up the tray of dishes. He heads down the stairs and into the kitchen, Cas following close behind, and adds the dessert dishes to the soak pile in the sink.
A nervous chuckle escapes Dean at the stare boring into him. He can smell Cas’s earthy scent, rain-fresh flowers drying in the springtime sunrise.
The final photo is of Jack fast asleep cuddled up to Cas, both of them now utilizing the blanket. Gabriel can be seen in the background blowing a kiss from the recliner where he’s finally woken up from his nap. The message that follows the pictures is a simple “
“Woah.” Gabriel crosses his arms and leans back against the sink. “Sounds like a lot of work for a four-year-old he’s never met.”
As Castiel texts, Gabriel finishes his pie and stands to rinse the plate and fork. Setting the clean dishes into the drying rack beside the sink, he turns toward the remainder of the pie. “Should I put the rest of this in the fridge for Jack-a-boy?”
“As that’s one of Gabe’s concoctions, I’ll be sure not to mention it. His ego’s big enough already.”
, dude, hummingbirds
Within only a few minutes, he’s cleared the entire house. Whoever did this is long gone. The fact that they left the upstairs untouched means they must have wanted to send a message but didn’t plan to stick around and risk getting caught. Considering Dean’s current state of mind, that was probably in their best interest.
fan?”
He tucks the phone into his pocket and unchains the bike. Swinging a leg over, he settles onto the seat and pushes off toward the sidewalk. It’ll be about half an hour before he gets home, but the breeze is light and the sun is still far enough above the horizon to make it a pleasant trip.
“You are amazing, and you don’t even realize it.”
“Heyyy, Caaaaas. Guess what today is!” Dean slurred as he flopped onto the pea-green couch in his bedroom, one hand on the phone and the other around a half-empty bottle. “I’ll give you
—for the rest of his time at KU. Cas intimidated the
“The two of us drinking alone in my house, while I should be grading term papers, is not my idea of a great time, Gabriel,” Castiel says as he sighs.
Bending closer, Cas wraps one hand and then the other around Dean, pulling him into his mouth. Dean’s had blowjobs before but this, with Cas, is an experience on a whole separate plane of existence. He grips the sheets and holds on for dear life as Cas sucks him down as far as he can, warm tongue gliding from base to tip, lingering to lap at the curves at the top. The unholy sounds Cas is making vibrate through Dean’s most sensitive parts and he tenses, pleasure-stricken into voicelessness.
Rubbing a sore spot where his pelvis had collided with an unyielding writing surface, Sam started to hobble off—probably to the location of the nearest fire extinguisher—when Eileen came running into the room, wide-eyed and pistol drawn.
Dean only had a few minutes to talk in between one self-appointed mission and the next, but given the significance of the date, he desperately needed to hear Castiel’s voice. He knew it would give him the encouragement to keep burning both ends of the proverbial candle, even as worn out as he was.
The final screw installed, Dean steps down from the ladder. “Well at least you aren’t pretending to like me for my brains,” he says with a wink.
Even though they’ve said goodbye, they both stare at one another, as if waiting for the other to move first. Castiel feels a sudden urge to lean in, to close the distance between himself and this man he barely knows. Spooked by the unexpected thought, he clears his throat and applies reluctant pressure to the pedals, hoping for the chill of the wind to distract him as he speeds away.
Dean shuffles over on the couch and lifts his arm. “Come on,” he says, and Cas dips against him, pushing his face into Dean’s neck and slowly snaking his arm around Dean’s middle. Dean presses his nose into Cas’ hair and breathes deeply. Coffee, and sugar, and just a little bit of lemon.
She sighs, “you’re so dramatic. I’m having a birthday party and you have to come.”
“Please, stop bullshitting me,” Dean says, hating that it sounds like he’s begging, “just tell me the fucking truth.”
“So you work for your dad, yeah?” Katie’s eyes are closed, a pleased curl to her mouth, “I couldn’t do that, I’d kill him.”
Castiel looked confused again, then he took his hands out of his pockets and starting backing towards his car again. "Yes, of course. I mean– You're obviously busy so I'll just go and– yes, I– have a nice day."
“I don’t know,” he says, “I guess I’m jealous, sometimes. He could leave because I stayed, you know? I liked raising him. It was a good job. And I guess I did pretty well. I should be happy about that.”
“What thing?”
Meg nods at him approvingly.
There was still a mark on Dean’s collarbone.
“Not really, they’re complete gibberish.”
He looked older. His hair was hanging in his face and curling at his shoulders. He had wrinkles around his eyes and along his brow. Dean's little brother looked older than him.
“It’s dad’s shit,” Sam frowns.
“How was your thing?” Cas asks him, while he’s making coffee.
It startles a shaky laugh out of Dean. Cas is moving his hips and Dean is meeting him and it’s almost, almost enough but it’s still so gentle–
He’s cross legged in front of the headlights, carefully teasing it out of its holding and turning it around to check the wirework.
Dean looked down at himself. “This?
As Dean sighed and sunk into him, lips pressed against his throat, and whispered “
When Sam starts to pull back, Dean stops him. “Hey,” he says, “I wanna help with the wedding, okay? I wanna help pick flowers and– and argue with vendors and I wanna feed your kids sugar and teach them how to ride bikes, okay?”
“Oh, get off,” Talbot complains, waving at Eames with his cane, “I’m perfectly capable–“ He reaches the bottom and pulls Dean right into a hug, both arms tight around his torso.
“Come on, dad, time to get up,” Dean says, rolling him over on his side with a grunt. There’s no response.
“Hey,” Dean says, “how you doing?”
Only just now is the sky to the east lightening.
He corners Talbot in the wine-cellar after dinner.
He gets to work.
“He didn’t remember meeting me.” Cas hears the words but they don’t feel like his. “There was one other time, at his work I… I thought I might have been forgettable because he remembered again and the next time he saw me he was so happy but we were… we were on a date, we’ve been dating for– he didn’t know who I was, Sam. I was holding the receipt of a 80 dollar dinner we just shared and I drove him to the emergency room and then he looked up and he didn’t–”
“And,” Dean continues, just in case Cas wants to take it all back, just in case he needs one more chance to run. “I’m still a mess. I think I have to stop drinking. I’m really bad at talking about my feelings.”
“Are you sure you don’t want to–“
Dean hands him the bottle, to prove that he can.
“Because you would inspire them. Because your job is difficult and important.”
“I’m glad you called.”
“That’s fine,” Dean says, “thanks. My plane leaves at 10:45.”
“That’s the car you’re here to fix right? The one you drove here?”
“It hit me so suddenly,” Dean murmured. “How fucking dumb I was being.”
Dean shot him a look, “we’re not?”
“Army rations,” Cas points out, and Dean laughs.
“I have a question,” he says, when Castiel is refilling his cup. “Does nothing ever happen here? At all?”
“Perfect.”
“That’s the weed talking,” Dean tells her.
He drives to the manor in a daze, parks the Impala in the garage and leaves the keys on the dashboard. Fifteen minutes later, he’s packed, and his duffel bag hangs across his shoulders, weighing almost nothing. Cas had still been asleep when Dean left and he hadn’t turned back to look at him. The moment he’d woken up he’d started moving. He didn’t stop for coffee or food, he just walked out, avoided his own eyes in the elevator mirror, in the rearview mirror.
“I’m at the airport, text me the info.”
“Dean, why are you laughing?”
He feels as if he could disappear. As if he could just start folding into the empty spaces inside himself until there is nothing left.
Dean grinned, “That’s very specific. And inappropriate.” But they kissed. Then leaned shoulder to shoulder and watched the patient synergism of light and shadow.
He stumbles back, turns away, and takes several deep breaths. This is why he’s here. He’s here to fix her. There’s still so much to do, the electric work needs time and he’s waiting for headlights to be delivered and he hasn’t even started on the cosmetic bits. But she would start, right now, if he asked her to.
He hears the rule of sheets, a murmur in the background, “what’s wrong? What happened?”
“Likewise,” Dean says, and shakes his hand.
“Well…” Sam starts, and there is something a little high and nervous in his voice, “there is actually something I wanted to talk to you about.”
Dean powers through a surge of nausea, takes a deep drink of coffee, and leans his elbows on the table.
Cas laughs, and some of the tension seeps out of his shoulders.
“I know,” Cas says, eyes wide.
“Oh,” Sam says, “Oh, okay, uhm. That’s good! How’s Talbot? Did you see the car?”
“Dude, I know.”
Cas presses his lips to the corner of Dean’s mouth, then pulls back just a little to look at him, still rocking close close close, in in in. ”Yeah?” He breaths. So unlike how he usually speaks, but still so much himself.
“Love you, Dean,” Sam says, all business.
He banged his head against metal. Metal was very hard. The wrench had not ended up underneath the car, and now he had a headache. He rubbed his scalp as he looked up.
“He was a soldier?” Dean asks, trying to imagine Cas, soft and serious and solemn, holding a gun.
“Come visit soon, okay?” Sam says, “I think you need some sense knocked into you.”
When Dean found him, he was still standing there, but he was holding the frame tight in his hands. Even now, with the lump in his throat and the way he felt too small to fit in this house, Dean walked in and everything felt like it made a little more sense. Like the chaos of atoms spinning through an infinite universe with no destination and no purpose could just for a second stop and say
Cas sits next to him, and puts his cold feet under Dean’s thigh.
“You’re back, thank god you’re back. I’m
“Just pull over.”
Dean switched his glass to his left hand and shook it, "Dean. Nice to meet you."
“That was the plan,” Talbot says, putting his laptop aside and gesturing at a chair. “Once you finished it I was going to do a whole thing where I put a bow around it, Eames spent hours finding ribbons that were wide enough, he’s gonna be so annoyed– anyway, it’s your car.”
“Will I see you tomorrow?” He asks, and Dean nods.
Dean isn’t used to this. He doesn’t know how to ask for things, he doesn’t know how to say
Dean does a double take. The man who’d spoken stands next to a mid-fifties Volkswagen. He’s in his forties, salt-and-pepper hair, nicotine-yellowed teeth parted in a surprised grin.
“Hm, that’s uncharacteristically nice of her.”
They danced. It was so unlike them.
Dean wants to tell him he doesn’t get it, ’cause he’s likeable. Sam is smart and funny and nice to people.
“Man, I dunno.”
“But you’re already seen it.” He said into Dean’s palm.
"I saved you from a conga line." He said. "You taught me to drive the Impala, because you said it was 'a crime against nature and style for a grown man to drive a mint-green Fiat', and you came to my class for career day, and last year, we went to the Grand Canyon." He took a deep breath. "You call me Cas."
I’ll try.)
“I’m a massive shit,” he says. “Don’t ask stupid questions.”
Talbot gives a thoughtful hum.
Cas was already inside the room. He didn’t hear the end of Sam’s sentence. Didn’t care. Dean’s jaw was clenched tight. They looked at each other for several long moments. Was it silence? Or was it a black hole, swallowing everything and anything so greedily even light died between its teeth?)
”Thanks, dude,” Dean said, grinning, still chuckling. His eyes were brighter with the reflection of fairy lights and something more. ”The
Sam tries to make himself scarce but it’s a small house. Dean steps outside and sits on the stoop, rubbing his sweaty palms on his jeans. Evening’s setting in over Scottsbluff, the sun dipping over the summit to the west. He doesn’t get much evening light in his garden.
“Do you want to?” Sam asks, carefully.
“I meant in this town.”
A man wearing dress pants and a blazer under a beige trench coat stood a few steps over him, looking concerned.
“Shit,” Dean says. He puts his hands in his hair, grips as tight as he can, until his scalp is burning. He walks away from the car, stops a few steps away, and lets his head hang.
He wants this forever.
Looking back over his actions the last few hours, Dean feels assured that this cannot be blamed on his poor map-reading skills. He decides to blame it on the English countryside, and road signs, and the car, and England, and the rain.
“Okay, okay,” Dean says, wiping his eyes, “I believe you.”
“Honestly, my heart is
“Dean,” Cas is saying, “Dean, Dean, Dean,” and he’s pulling his fingers out to move Dean’s arm away from his mouth so much like Dean had in the kitchen but Dean unclenches his teeth and grabs Cas’ hand and pushes Cas’ fingers back into himself along with his own and it hurts but it’s better than–
“How was it not real?”
Eventually, Sam let go of him and sat down on the side of his bed.
”I didn’t peg you for a whiskey drinker.”
He gave Dean a small, teary-eyed smile, and well, Dean was either going to get murdered in the parking lot, or he was going to do a good deed. If he survived, he could always pick up the rest of his shopping another day. "Yeah, sure, that's fine." He nodded, and started pushing his cart toward the front of the store. The man followed at a respectable distance, casting furtive glances at Dean at regular intervals, but not saying anything. Dean unloaded his shopping, flirted with the girl behind the register, and then packed away his steaks, his pasta, his favorite beer, breakfast cereal he had never had before, organic milk he didn't know existed, and caviar.
Cas’ voice is low and warm and throaty in his ear, “Goodnight, Dean.”
It’s just a car, and he knows how to put cars together. He doesn’t email Charlie.
“Seventeen months ago, yeah,” he interjects, looking past her down the stairs.
Silence.
, he reminds himself,
”That’s because you’re brilliant.”
“Can we talk about something else?” His voice is too loud.
“That’s right. The engine. The engine is made up out of all these tiny little parts that do
Talbot doesn’t ask questions when Dean wants to borrow his laptop, just hands it over and continues his conversation with Eames.
She showed him through the glass doors and he saw Castiel out of the corner of his eye, one hand in a fist on his thigh, the other holding a phone to his ear.
He drops him off at an apartment building which has seen better days. At the café, Cas always looks like he has everything under control. Here, leaning down to speak to Dean through the open window of the car, with the dirty grey building with its small windows a glum backdrop, his coat starts to look old, rather than vintage. His hair starts to look unkempt, rather than charmingly tousled. The dark circles under his eyes are clearer.
“You always remember.”
"You are not going to be stuck in the garage all day, you are coming to eat breakfast, and you are going to enjoy it. Eames made eggs.”
, he tells himself.
“Aren’t you too young to drink coffee?” He scowls at them.
They step out of the car, doors slamming and the sound echoing around the garage.
Sam leaned over Dean’s shoulder, “Well, you do write like a kindergartener. Cas, do we have crayons?”
When he comes out, he looks as ragged as the apartment building. He’s wearing a t-shirt again, and his hands are shoved deep in his pockets, head low and shoulders hunched, looking as if he’s fighting against a wind only he can feel.
Cas hasn’t seen him yet. He’s standing behind the counter, foaming milk, that line between his eyebrows that Dean knows the shape of now, that Dean has kissed. Gabriel is leaning against the counter, saying something, and Cas laughs. He knows he won’t be able to do it. If Dean talks to him, he won’t be able to do it.
“Was there something wrong with it?” Cas frowned a little.
you don’t care about me having a fucking college education. You never have, I was pushing your buttons which was a dick move but you
“Right, well.” Dean clears his throat. “Sorry about the shouting.”
“I was admitting to it!” Dean rubs his forehead.
“Yeah,” Dean says, simply. “We’re boarding, I gotta go. I’ll call you when I land, okay?”
“It’s getting there,” he calls back.
is fucking incredible, Cas is like no one else he’s ever met, Cas is goddamn unreal. All of it gathers in his throat and sticks there. His heart is beating so hard he’s dizzy.
Dude looked damn fine in that shirt. Too bad he seemed a map or two short of being 'all there'.
The little old ladies with cars that broke down no matter how much you fixed them up made it quite clear that he was a hero to them, and there were worse things to be. Besides, there was nothing quite like the sound of a healthy engine, and knowing he fixed it.
“It’s fine,” Dean says.
A tingle ran up his spine as he remembered Dean’s smile, his shining eyes, the backdrop a soft bokeh out on that balcony.
“Goodnight,” Cas answers, “I’m glad you came all the fucking way out here.”
“Yeah, I–“ He says, “Well, it’s just that–”
This is the part of the job that Dean really loves.
Dean sat at the foot of the bed.
“Sweetheart,” Cas says, and Dean feels it like a punch to the chest. He stands up slowly, legs shaking, not lifting his head but letting his cheek drag up against Cas stomach, chest, neck, and then they are kissing again. Cas is cradling him like so much treasure, like he’s scared to spill any, scared that Dean will just start tumbling into pieces and fall through his fingers and run into the ground beneath them.
"Are you in much pain?"
“Nope,” Talbot says again, even louder, “nope, nope, nope.” He takes a firm grasp of Dean’s ankles and pulls him out from under the car.
“Oh, uh,” Dean says, “It’s going okay. Believe it or not, this place isn’t a mechanic’s dream, but I think I have some leads.
”Hey, I know things.”
“I never meant to– I’m sorry, I’m being a dick. It’s just– I’m not in control. I can’t walk around and pretend shit’s okay when…”
“Why did you come back?” He asks.
Flirting with her was a big mistake.
“Oh, really? I was just going to suggest we have a look at the vegetable patch outside–”
“You always remember."
me, but you were in my life and in my bed. That’s not something I can fabricate. I am not that good of a liar, and neither are you.
Dean’s eyes shifted back to the engine. The muscles of his arms stretched the sleeve of the old t-shirt he was wearing to it’s breaking point when he started back in on it with the wrench. Cas let a finger trail over some dirt by the line of his tricep, and goosebumps erupted suddenly on the warm skin. He smiled a little.
“talbot is making me spend the day with him, help!”
Dean had looked into his eyes and decided, again, to marry him. Had decided every single day since that first blazing summer afternoon. Had chosen Cas. For the rest of his life. As they danced words hung between them, greater than stars: like planets. Some unsaid, all heard.
“When I realised you’d gone, and not just gone away but gone home, I thought I knew what that meant.”
There’s a pause.
“Can’t right now.”
He nodded, ”that’s what I thought. Can I call you Cas?”
Dean wracked his mind, trying to place that ruffled dark hair and that gruff voice, then he slapped a hand to his forehead. "Of course, Castiel, sorry, I'm not usually so bad with faces. Nice to meet you again."
Subject: BRO WTF
Cas looks up and spots him. Dean raises a hand, and he smiles.
“Oh god, what if he dies?” Sam said, and then he was crying. Jessica wrapped her arms around him and he fell into her. She kissed his hair. She looked at Cas, her eyes shining with pity.
Cas is soft and rumpled and so very, very naked. It’s a sight Dean’s not used to. It’s a new one. Dean knows Cas is smaller than him, that his chest is narrower though they are almost exactly the same height, but it’s something else to see his bare hip leaning against the counter, his flat stomach moving a little when he talks, or laughs. His shoulders shifting and his collar bones protruding when he shrugs. It makes Dean’s head spin.
“Fine. I’m working on the wiring. Next week I’m thinking I’ll go get a new generator.”
“Phone?” Meg says, “Never heard of it.” Then, to Dean, “you have to bring a gift.”
“I knew I loved you for a reason.”
“Alright, well. If you could stay the week out, I’ll have time to catch up on some of these bills…”
“Probably,” Sam agrees, “but his best wasn’t good enough.”
“Your website said–” Sam starts, looking uncomfortable.
They drive up the gravel pathway slowly, in second gear. They turn left on the asphalt, and the Impala groans her way into third gear, then fourth is easier, and then they’re in fifth and they’re driving.
“I haven’t actually driven her yet,” Dean says. “She starts and stops, but it will probably not be a very smooth ride.” For the first time, he gets to look at her in the light of the sun. She looks bigger out here. “She might break down, which is why I’m bringing all that.” He nods at the tools in the backseat.
Cas was smiling at him, wide and bright. “You’ve done an amazing job.”
–––––
Dean kicks him in the chin, and Cas kicks him back.
“Shh.”)
There’s already electricity wired in here, and water: a sink and a hose in the back corner. A proper hydraulic car lift isn’t cheap, he’d balked at the price of the one he bought for Winchester and Son, but this space could feasibly hold one.
Cas shakes his head, scraping his empty plate, then drinking deeply from his beer. He’s wearing a t-shirt, which Dean doesn’t think he’s seen him in before. He’s always in button-ups.
"Hey, you're Castiel, right?"
“Who do you brag to? Sam? Bobby?”
He goes back through their conversation, Sam’ “is it a date” hanging empty on the screen without a response. When he goes to his contacts, Castiel Novak is right there at the top.
“No, but you’re American?”
Sam’s answer is a little too soft, but it doesn’t hurt like it usually does. “That’s great, Dean. I’m really happy.”
Finally, there’s movement in John’s face, he frowns but doesn’t open his eyes.
He learns some things over subsequent visits to Taste Buds. First: don’t flirt with Meg the waitress, it’s a bad idea. Second, the American’s name is Castiel. He’s not told that, he just reads the name tag and no one corrects him when he starts using it. Thirdly, a guy named Gabriel owns the candy store next door. He keeps coming over to bother Castiel. Dean isn’t sure he likes Gabriel very much. He finds him unnerving, like if you turned your back for a second he might steal your wallet, or give you a wedgie.
He also couldn't help but take a little pride in the fact that out of the two of them, he was the only one who could actually cook.
. The little things, babe. It’s all in the little things.”
“So there’s a rehab centre in Gering,” he says, when he’s made Dean hot cocoa on his own stove and sat him down at the table like he’s about to ask for a divorce.
The radio fades into nothing, white noise filling his ears, a dread settling in.
No it wasn't. "No it's not." Sam was messing with him. "It's 2011, this isn't funny."
Cas comes to sit next to him, and the couch dips.
Ten minutes went past in silence. Castiel now and then opened his mouth as if to speak, looking troubled, but never actually said anything. Then a nurse called Dean's name.
He had to quickly look away. Perhaps the dark would hide his blush. It was night and everything was framed in dancing light.
“You know what, Eames, you’re pretty cool,” Dean says, and drinks his tea.
When he was nine, he fixed her for the first time. There was a problem with the anti-freeze, and to this day he remembers every scrape of metal against his knuckles, every heavy tool, every finger of his dad’s hand pressing down on his shoulder. More clearly than anything, he remembers the pride he felt when they drove on. Pride that he had fixed her, he had made her well again.
And suddenly he was sure. Dean must be dead. It was a moment of absolute clarity, sparking like electricity under his temple. In this very moment the doctor was putting the paddles back, sighing, wiping his forehead. The machine would still be on. One long, piercing sound the only thing still panicking in the room; the only thing saying
“When we get back from California, we should buy a camera. Take more photos of shit.”
”Hello, Dean.”
“Sixties model?” He asks, getting out of the Impala.
They only bother to turn on the weak, yellow light that runs along the bottom of the cupboards, so they can eat without stabbing each other, but it’s bright enough that Dean can see Cas’ flushed cheeks. When Dean tries to nudge Cas’ fork away from the last mushroom, Cas says, “we should have ordered pizza.”
The bruise across his cheek and eye swell up, go down, and start turning yellow. There are no messages from anyone on his phone. No Talbot, no Gabriel, no Meg, no Cas. He’s relieved and he’s heartbroken and he’s confused. He wants to delete those numbers off his phone. He wants to change his own number, just in case. He wants to get drunk so he can talk to Sam about all of these things, and he wants Sam to be drunk enough not to remember it in the morning. He wants his dad not to be a drunk.
Nothing. He keeps pouring tea.
“You’re driving,” he says, and
“Dean…? Do you know what time it is? Are you okay?” Sam’s voice is bleary with sleep and confusion. Dean’s breaks on the first try, so he tries again.
“What the hell,” Dean scowls at him, “you are such a bitch, I’m sharing here–“
Dean scratches at his neck, he so fully wants to do that. Glancing over his shoulder, he sees Cas and Garth have been joined by several other people, talking rapidly. Cas is frowning like he has a headache.
He has to stand awkwardly in the doorway as Talbot lets the silence linger.
“It’s okay if you are,” Sam says, insistently, like he’s rehearsed it. “I get that you’re the reason I could leave. You did all the work and gave me all the options, and I just took them.”
“Sam went to law school, so. And I like working on cars. I’m good at it. Just makes sense I would take over, when Sam left. It’s not great money, but what do I need money for?” Sweat is slowly making its way down his spine, but his hands are shaking as if he’s cold. “Dad started that shop. It says Winchester on the sign. You don’t just throw that away, you know, someone’s got to keep it running. Not that I’m– it’s dad’s shop. I just work there. It would be nothing without him.” His voice sounds strange. “I like working there,” he insists, as if Cas had protested.
“What do you have against it?” Cas asks, buckling himself in. “You were pretty riled up about it when we first met.”
Sam sounds guilty, but not guilty enough. “I told him, at the hospital, that this was one of his options. He could cut you loose or cut himself out, but he had to do something. I guess he chose.”
Okay, 70 percent sure.
Cas threw his head back, partly to laugh, partly to make sure Dean didn’t have to stop. “We have a projector, Dean, it’s not the nineteen nineties. I think you’re getting old.”
He’s trying to figure out what that means when a large mug of coffee is set down in front of him.
“Okay,” Cas says. “Turn right here.”
Subject: TELL ME THINGS
”Do you want some beer?”
From ten days ago, Charlie Bradbury, subject: “Just talked to your brother…”
This particular guest didn't seem the dancing type. He was, after all, standing in a corner with the best man, rather than joining in.
”Okay… Okay, okay–” Mumbled, and almost rambled, but clear and promising and warm. Then a third finger is pressing into him and Dean gasps out and pushes back but they are gone just as quick.
He looked confused, "Yes. Yes, I usually– I'm Castiel? We met at your brother's wedding."
Cas gets them painlessly through the small roads where Dean had gotten lost, and in no time at all, Dean has payed for his smog pump, as well as a cruise control harness, a battery tray, a linear wire loom, and been handed a list of names of people all over England who might be able to help him with the rest. Steven Hardy shakes his hand firmly, and even knows who Talbot is. “That American,” who’d made himself a reputation shipping American classics out into the English countryside.
Dean really tries to be cool about it, but he doesn’t want to sit in this house alone, with no job to go to, no booze to drink, and a silent phone. Wondering if Cas saw his call and decided not to answer.
And there’s the anger. Dean swallows hard around it, “you can drink beer when you can get it out of the fridge yourself, sir.”
“The wealthy American who bought a previously historically protected manor a few miles from here? Yes, I know of him.”
They pull over by a rest stop and Dean pops the hood, enjoys the sun burning the back of his neck.
Dean scoffed. “Why?”
There is loud clanking of glass on the other end, “
“It might be ready for a test-drive,” Dean says, “do you wanna come?”
“He forgets– He was in the wrong year yesterday.”
Dean kisses him before he goes. Then he drives back to the manor.
I’m sorry. I never wanted to make you a widower.)
He looks over at Meg, who is looking at him with deep disappointment in her eyes, shaking her head slowly as she plates a cheesecake.
“joey quit"
“Ease my troubles, that’s what you do. Oh, the morning sun in all it’s glory…” Dean sang. His voice as warm and ragged as it had been on that balcony at the beginning of time.
Cas huffs and looks away. “It is in England,” he mutters.
Now, Dean turned around to sit lightly against the car, close to Cas side. He found Cas hand with his, and pressed his lips to his cheek for a short moment.
He didn't like champagne very much. In fact, he didn't like it at all. But, as the best man, he was required to have at least one glass since it was the 'classier choice'. He'd
Dean makes a non-committal noise. He’s sweating under his collar. A voice so like Sam’s is whispering in his ear, prodding at him insistently. ’You fixed that car,’ it says. ’He ran out of liquor and disappeared for two weeks, Dean. He never even looked at that car.’ and then ’you had a bruise on your shoulder for a week where that bottle hit you, Dean.’
They lie pushing close, again, again, again. Dean’s being loud again, embarrassing and loud and moaning but Cas is muttering swearwords and laughing shakily, laughing as if something in him is just so goddamn happy he can’t help it.
Jimmy Talbot limps out onto the front steps, right foot in a walking cast, ornate wooden cane supporting his weight, grinning from ear to ear.
“what?”
“Yeah?” Dean picks up his wrench again, “lay it on me.”
He turns away before Cas can see him flush. “Thanks.” He opens the driver side door. “Help me get her out of here?”
Dean drinks his beer. “That is a terrifying thought.”
Cas leads them down a trail to a lake, and sits on a bench by a tree. Dean sits next to him, glancing at him out of the corner of his eye.
, Dean thinks, and buries it, buries it, deep and far away.
"Why am I in California?" Oh. There were his vocal cords.
Cas is very willing to provide him with reasons for why he doesn’t own a car. Almost as willing as Dean is to counter every single one of them. As if “I don’t travel that much” and “it’s expensive” and “Gabriel can give me a ride” and “a Honda” and “2008, I think?” are
Cas walks him to the door, when the sun is sitting low.
“Yes, sir. If I may be so bold, I rather thought it beyond saving.”
Meg refuses to take Cas’ shift, so Dean visits Katie on his own. She lives on a farm, in a ramshackle little shed across the way from the main house, and Dean would have knocked on the wrong door if she hadn’t been sitting on a lawn chair by the shed, smoking.
He grips Cas ankle tighter, as if he can keep him there, keep them both there.
“I’m calling you after this lecture!”
When he wakes up, it’s dark outside. According to his watch, it’s mid-afternoon in Nebraska. He turns on the lights in the room, which just casts long shadows across the mass of empty floor. In the en-suite, he washes his face and neck, and drinks water from the tap, avoiding his own eyes in the mirror. He feels jittery and out of place, like it’s too quiet, or he’s being too loud.
“Dean?”
Cas furrows his brow, “I suppose that depends on your definition,” he says, “are we comparing me to the average non-car owner, or are we comparing me to you? The answers will be quite different.”
“I’m not rejecting–”
“I want to be with you until one of us dies.” Cas said.
Cas’ hand lands on his on the steering wheel, soft and warm. His thumb strokes the back of Dean’s hand, slowly and carefully, then travels down and grips his wrist tight.
It was an even more unpleasant experience to wake up, be immediately blinded by the bright, white lights of a hospital room and then realize he had absolutely no idea why he was there.
“Jesus, Sam, you didn’t do this to me!” He turns around and shoulders past Sam into the living room, as if Sam would let him walk away from this conversation.
“I’m gonna tell him you said that,” Gabriel sings, and Dean puts his forehead on the steering wheel. He’s tired, he’s hungry, and he’s done. He hears Gabriel open the door and step out, but he doesn’t close the door right away. When Dean looks up, he’s peering into the car, an uncharacteristically serious expression on his face.
He knows he’s too drunk to drive anywhere. He’s made no contingency plan, and neither has Cas. They’ve just let the hours spill into each other, holding their breaths for something to come and stop them. At least, Dean has, Dean has been holding his breath for weeks. He’s dizzy with it.
He finds himself saying his own name so often it stops sounding like real words, because everyone wants to talk to Talbot, wants to ask him about his latest fixer upper, wants to know who the kid is that he’s brought with him.
There was another pause. Dean cleared his throat again. The man looked ruffled, like he'd been fidgeting. His suit jacket was nowhere to be seen. The sleeves of his white shirt were wrinkled and the top few buttons undone. Dean's gaze lingered on the end of a collarbone and the tendons of his throat. His vest had creases like he'd never heard of an iron and his hair looked like he'd been running his fingers through it – Dean wouldn't mind running
Dean ate his fries. “Soon though.” They pressed their knees together under the table. “Are your students impressed?”
“I want you to come to my school for career day.”
“Why’d you drop out?” Dean asks.
) He was probably sad. It must be sad to lose patients, especially the ones with family. They would roll his body down to the morgue. He wondered if Dean had felt it. Would dying hurt, even under anesthesia? Did doctors sow up the patients if they died on the table? Would they be stitching Dean’s head together again before they left the OR? Would they be leaving it open, gaping, for Cas and Sam and Jess to stare down into–
, harder–“
“I won’t–” he heard his own voice saying, “I won’t be okay.”
He considered the word
He turns back into the kitchen and pours it out in the sink. Then he opens his fridge and takes out all the beer in there and starts pouring that out too.
Neither of them speak for a long while. Cas looks happy, watching the water, hands folded gently in his lap, sweat beading at his collar and his temple.
(I want to be myself. I don’t want to become someone less than that. If I do… If they mess up and something goes wrong–
“Planning Sam’s was bad enough.”
“Dean,” Sam says, sounding anxious, “you know what I mean, right? I’m not saying– Obviously you’re my real family–“
“Yeah,” Dean says, but something else is building in his chest, ballooning up fast and oddly euphoric, as if he’s accidentally opened something up and he can’t stop it now, it’s happening whether he wants it or not. “I’m in love with Cas,” he says, staring at something over Sam’s shoulder.
Then Gabriel’s voice is coming down the line, “Please tell me you’re standing in a field full of sheep right now. That’s the picture in my head and I need it realised. Are there sheep-droppings on your jeans? Please tell me it’s raining and you somehow lost your shoe. Make this dream come true for me.”
“I gotta go, let me know when you’ll be back.”
Dean jumps, “jeez, man, walk a bit louder, please,” he says and quickly closes the email-tab.
“How are you?”
Sam doesn’t answer, his silence is tense and opinionated.
”will you stay?”
“Hell if I know,” John says, slurring, “we don’t need him. We’re fine just the two of us.”
“Come here,” Cas says, and hitches up his own jeans. When Dean starts to pull his own shirt off, feeling overheated and wanting, Cas stops him. Gentle and firm, he leads Dean through the living room and into his bedroom, closes the door behind them. Dean wants to look around. He’s never been in here before. But he’s just barely holding himself together, just barely keeping all of this empty space within in check.
Dean laughs. Talbot doesn’t say any more. Maybe he’s said all he wanted to. Maybe he’s done and Dean can walk away and never think of this moment every again.
“Of course not, we’re going golfing.”
“Yeah. To help us remember.”
“Oh, okay,” Sam laughs, “back to normal now are we?”
He dropped out of high school in junior year. John nodded silently when he told him. He moved into his own place as soon as he turned eighteen, and John didn’t put up a fight. He was already at the auto shop working full time. His name was on the building, and Dean liked it. There was some monument to his work, some proof to his existence.
“You know why I had to get out, right?” Sam’s saying, “You get it, right? Why I couldn’t stay. It wasn’t– I’m always gonna need you, Dean.”
.” He dragged his hand through his hair.
“The army?” Dean repeats.
“I’m never doing this again,” he tells Cas, “under absolutely no circumstances.”
He drags his nails against Cas’ bare arm, slowly. “You deal with lots of people at Taste Buds every day.”
“I don’t know. Let’s get the Impala and just drive.”
One day, Sam comes back to the house holding a thin folder, looking nervous.
“No, you don’t,” he says.
Dean heads to the counter, “Thank god, you’ll understand. They’re feeding me nothing but tea, I’m going crazy. You’ll have some real coffee, right?”
“You’re not looking forward to tonight, are you?”
“I asked him about you, on the phone. I wasn’t gonna bother fixing the car. I wrecked it and I got to reminiscing, so I call him up and I ask about you boys, and… He was real proud of Sam, you know, just like you are. But Dean, you were a brilliant kid.”
Sam talks him through looking at his face in the bathroom mirror and washing the vomit off his hands, talks him through calling an ambulance on John’s landline, and stays on the phone with him while an EMT tells him he did good making John vomit, and asks if he wants his face looked at.
“That’s just not good enough,” he says, “I’m here to do a job, and if you’re not gonna let me do it, then we’re gonna have a problem–“
“Wow, okay,” Sam says, but Dean’s not done yet.
“It wasn’t real. It was– it was a story, and it was nice, imagining it, but it was just a story.”
“I love you,” Cas mumbles into his cheek, then kisses him there, and then at the edge of his jaw, and then again, on his lips.
“Since when does Winchester and Son run internationally?”
Sam tries to interject, “no, really, Eileen doesn’t mind–“
“Duh,” Sam agrees.
“So–”
“Yes,” he says, “you’ll be there.”
“If I asked, would you marry me?”
It’s stuffy and warm in there, wax candles spread out on the tables and along shelves. As soon as they step inside, a short, skinny guy with brown hair starts towards them, eyes fixed on Cas, arms stretched out and brandishing a beer bottle.
“I’m really sorry, Dean,” Joey says, sounding it, “it’s been a mess since you left, I just can’t deal with John anymore.”
Cas crosses his arms. “Yes it is.”
Sam had brought them to a pub slash bar with food and a jukebox (and a karaoke machine that Dean would never be drunk enough to use, wedding day or not). Sam was in a booth, crying into his hamburger because he was the sappiest person they knew. Not they they had a lot of room to talk. They were dancing. Cas knew the music playing, vaguely. It was something Dean loved to sing when he thought no one could hear him. Slow and sweet. They were the only one’s dancing but there was no room for embarrassment. Not where their chests were pressed together. Not where Dean’s lips rested close to Cas’ ear, murmuring the words to no one but him. Not when there were fairy lights hanging from the ceiling. The room could have been empty. Dean and Cas were an isolated, untouchable point in the universe. Swaying in the midst of little stars suspended around their heads as if they were the centre of a galaxy and a gravitational pull.
Dean shakes his head, “I dunno,” he says. “I’m just happy.”
John backhands him. Dean’s not ready. He falls to the side, knocking his hip into the coffee table, the pile of bills toppling over onto the floor, and catches himself on his elbow.
Dean drinks his hot cocoa. “I guess.” He probably should be arguing. He should be stomping around the house, fuming. “He’s not gonna like it.”
"I am Castiel." He said. "I am your–" he glanced at Sam, who nodded encouragingly. "I'm your boyfriend."
“I get that.”
To: Dean Winchester
The grin is the same one Dean knows from his adolescence, but very little else is. He looks older, sure, it’s been more than ten years since they saw each other last, but Dean knows Jimmy as John Winchester’s friend, who wears torn jeans and yesterday’s wife-beater and who’s missing a tooth, he doesn’t know this man in the nice suit, whose American accent lilts in odd ways, who is clean-shaven and sober and wearing delicate round spectacles.
–––––
At one pm, Ricky buys them both burgers, and asks Dean about England. Here, in the dingy little office with its blinds that can’t be rolled up anymore, the manor seems exaggerated in his mind, the little town and the rows and rows of expensive cars a bit excessive, like he’s telling this story for the hundredth time, at a party somewhere, and all the details have gotten a life of their own. He can’t grip them in his hands. It’s all coffee and hands and gears and blue eyes and dark skies. Every word out of his mouth sounds like a lie.
“Duh, I know, but are you gay?”
Dean shakes his head, “it’s fucking incredible, like she hasn’t aged a day. I mean, she’s still looking pretty rough, but I think I can do the first round of priming next week, so.”
Dean stilled against him. His eyes shuttered. “Oh.” Then he was silent for several moments. Then he pulled back.
Sam doesn’t answer right away. “What’s going on Dean?” He says, finally, something like alarm in his voice.
Dean threw his pen at him. “Go back to California, moosebrains.”
“Don’t.”
Talbot sighs. “Alright. Sit down.”
“So there had to be a reason you left. Something I hadn’t seen, or hadn’t understood. I was confused. I wasn’t ready to hear why you were gone.”
, dad. I mean, hi dad. How– how are you.”
“You–!”
It could really only get better from there.
“What’s wrong then?”
“You can’t make him,” Dean says, “he has to want to go.” He knows that much.
“I got Ricky to step in for a while,” he’s telling him, “he’s not gonna let dad push him around, so hopefully dad won’t try.”
“Hello,” Cas smiles back.
“I’m not ready to cross satanic sacrifice off the list yet, no matter what the sign on the window says,” he continues. Castiel is sitting low on the couch, chin tucked into his chest and arms crossed over his torso. He’s staring at the television, which is showing an ad.
“Just get in the car,” he mutters.
“Why?” He asks.
“Of course I do,” Talbot frowns, and he looks so serious Dean goes ahead and sits down. “I want you to have it.”
It only takes two minutes to replace the nail and hang the postbox back up.
She nods, “tell me about it. I’ve got a Model A, you know, 1928 Ford, I cannot tell you what a bitch it’s been– Been working on it for near six years now, and it’s still nowhere near running.”
had one of these!” He’s pointing at it, as if he’s expecting the driver to smack himself on the forehead and move right on to another, less outrageous, car. Instead, he takes the duffel right out of Dean’s hand, puts it in the trunk, and opens the back door for him.
Cas’ entire body shudders. He stills, sucks in two harsh breaths. Then he lets go of Dean’s left hand, cradles the back of his head, and kisses him like it hurts not to.
“That’s a good idea. To help us remember what the garden looked like before you completely gave up weeding it.”
“Yeah, yeah, but listen. The last five years all you’ve done is work in dad’s shop, pay dad’s bills, clean up his messes. This is gonna be the first time maybe ever that you’re away from him.”
“Hey,” Cas says, turning Dean’s face upwards, nails scratching softly against his scalp. Dean shudders, and looks up, on his knees like a praying man, holding Cas as if he’s performing a benediction.
“When did you get home?” Dean asked. His casual tone had no place here. It jarred the stillness of the room.
“Tuition? I agree,” Cas says.
"It sounded very heartfelt." The man commented. His voice was far deeper than his face would have anyone believe, and Dean definitely blamed the champagne for the warmth in his stomach.
Talbot raises an eyebrow at him, “I don’t know how to tell you this, but it’s actually a pretty mediocre car.”
“You’re the American?” she asks, her words nearly drowned by the music and her accent.
Dean tries not to laugh, he does, it’s shitty to laugh when someone’s just telling you things they think, but Cas is
"What, him? No, I barely know him." Dean frowned.
It’s a small lake, sheltered by trees along the edges, but the sun beats down on the water, and glittering lights scatter across the surface.
Dean throws himself on the bed and dials back, yawning so wide his jaw makes a cracking noise.
, Dean. You were quick and witty and incredibly emotionally astute. And you were always reading to him, and then stealing his books and lying about it. Why didn’t you finish high school?”
“I’ve been trying to keep my nose out, I have, but…” He looks guilty, and sympathetic, and Dean thinks he knows what’s coming. “I’ve been opening the post, and sending invoices, you’re not doing so great.”
From: Charlie Bradbury
Garth gets a hold of Cas pretty quickly after that, and Dean lingers close by, nursing a beer. Garth makes no attempt to include him in the conversation, so he tries to look decorative. There are a few regulars among the guests, but most of them seem to be from out of town. At least, Dean has never seen this many young people in Leatherhead all at the same time before.
“You don’t
Cas nods and leans in through the open window to grab his phone.
“Just warning you, I’m pretty fond of it.”
“What about customers?” Dean asks.
“Oh, he’ll go,” Sam says, voice dark, and Dean doesn’t argue.
Cas gets sick of him, mutters grumpily at him, pushes him down on the bed and holds his hands down and tries to make him shut his damn mouth.
“You’re one to talk, you still work for your dad.”
“That’s what I said,” Dean says, kicking Cas lightly beneath the table to try to make him smile.
Before they can answer, he continues:
“Did you drive through a tunnel?”
Cas frowns, “what?” he asks.
“Fucked if I know,” he scoffs.
. He remembered loud music and the sound of an engine and thinking that he was so, so lucky. He remembered feeling scared and wanting and not daring to ask but saying yes, yes, yes. He remembered stubble burn and arguing and dancing and slamming doors and blue eyes and bad TV and good books and nails digging into his back and rings.
“I love that
They smoke in silence for a little while, and Dean turns his face after the sun when it peeks between intermittent clouds and breathes slow and deep.
“You said there were payment options right?”
“I like this better than you spending the day with Mr. Talbot. I enjoy your company.”
“Get back to work. Don’t fail me on this.”
"Why the fuck am I here? What's wrong with me?"
“You can’t make me collateral, Dean,” Cas continues, but his face isn’t neutral anymore, it’s overcome– emotions are playing out in his eyes and at the turn of his mouth and the tilt of his eyebrows in the same they way are wanting to erupt out of Dean and all of them are aspects of all the love between them. “When you want to punish yourself, you can’t do that through me. You can’t do that again.”
“Yes!”
Dean nods. “You’re welcome. Anytime. And–” He stops, looks down at his shoes, wishes he had something to hold in front of him, as a shield, “and thank you, too. For. Fuck it, you know what for. I’ll see you tomorrow at the coffee shop?”
“Hey Dean, how is everything?”
The man still looked concerned, "is your head alright?"
Dean shrugs, “honestly, I’m pretty tired.”
When Sam answers a little later, Cas frowns down at the phone in silence.
“What?”
“Just kiss me.”
Nothing.
Dean is already on his way up the stairs. “You can afford it,” he calls over his shoulder.
Also, can you please buy a better phone so we can facetime?? I need to know if you’re still as pretty as you were in america. I’ve had to explain to everyone on discord why you’re not active anymore, saltandpepper thought you turned on the show bc of the mid-season finale and I had to tell them that you probably haven’t even seen it yet – honestly, you gotta, Dean I screamed out loud. I did.
Sam muttered a curse. "I'm sorry, Dean. I'm telling the truth. It's 2014, you're in Sacramento. You came here three weeks ago to let the doctors run some tests–
“Yes.”
The car door opens, closes, and Dean drives back.
Cas turned to watch him wringing his hands. Those words had hurt him more than anything Dean had ever said. He wondered if Dean knew that.
He enters the garage from the west end of the house. Here, the fluorescent light flick on strong and bright, lighting the rows of cars and shelves of tools in clear detail. Dean breathes out.
“50 percent chance?”
“He’s asking who I am, what should I tell him?”
Cas’ apartment is cold in the mornings. Cas makes him coffee and stands close, rubs his hands across the goosebumps breaking out across Dean’s shoulders. Dean struggles to relax under it. He feels twitchy, Cas’ touch unpredictable.
“Just bring me a beer,” John says.
“Ricky’s only staying for two more days,” Dean says, “I don’t know if we can afford to replace him.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean says, and it comes out like a whisper.
“No problem,” Dean mutters, tucking his chin into his chest.
It’s a small, bright room, with a round wooden table with two chairs by the window facing the front yard. Dean lets his hand linger on the counter tops. If he sits by the table, he can see the Impala on the driveway.
“I talked to this nurse about changing the channel in the waiting room, I don’t think I can take another second of Dr. Sexy, honestly it’s just inappropriate for a hospital.”
“And still after that?”
“I wonder how we’re meant to forgive our fathers,” Cas murmurs, but he’s staring out at the lake, not at Dean.
"Sure was," he offered, "unless you had hay fever or disliked any of the way too many shades of yellow."
He almost forgets to be scared during turbulence. There is a strange rush in him. All the strings keeping him together have loosened – it’s not a precipice, it’s something else, a sudden rush of adrenaline, a waking up from a dream of falling. Turbulence is nothing against this. He barely understands what the flight attendant is saying to him. He’s too busy wondering if she can read it all on his face, if she can tell this is a man about to throw everything he has at something and hope it catches him. If he dies here, he thinks, at least he dies doing something.
“Oh, right.”
Cas pushes in slow and deep. He leans heavily onto Dean’s back, his other hand stroking Dean’s hair shakily where he’s almost not even propped up on his elbow anymore, almost lying fully on top of Dean. He puts his lips against Dean’s cheek and kisses him almost goddamn innocently–
,” Cas warns.
–––––
When he leaves, she leans in through the open driver’s side window and gives him an odd look.
They didn’t speak for a while. Cas let his eyes rest on the piles of new planks, the places where the porch was beginning to take shape, and the places where is was still a skeleton. They were sitting on lawn chairs on the grass.
: “You will be missed.”
”Who is this? Cas?”
–––––
The coffee goes up Dean’s nose.
“Sam, Imma need you to do that thing.”
“Are you doing okay with everything?”
“I’m not going to class–”
“But you’re not asking?”
“Shop’s fine,” there’s something sharp in his voice, “don’t mess this up, Talbot is an old friend.”
He returns to the manor one night, head fuzzy from low lighting, hot coffee, and a hand curling over his knee, goes to bed, and realises he hasn’t been in the garage in three days.
“I want to sell my car.”
Cas undresses Dean slowly. He leaves kisses and words burned into Dean’s skin. He presses Dean down on the mattress so gently, and he looks at all the places where Dean is imperfect and dirty and dull, presses the pads of his thumbs into all the crevices of him, to every scar and bump and bruise seen and unseen. He looks, and looks, and looks.
“Hey, no,” Cas says into his shoulder, kisses into his skin like he’s made of something shiny and fragile and admirable, something you want to run your lips over again and again– “No,” he whispers, and pulls their fingers out. He grabs Dean’s hand and presses it into the sheets next to his head, helps his fingers curl around the fabric.
“No,” Dean says, and starts pulling on him. “You don’t need beer, you need a shower.”
“Hey, that’s okay, I just stepped out of the shower, so.” Dean looks down at himself. He’s suddenly very aware that he’s naked.
He’s standing in the doorway, hand to his chest. “You scared the shit out of me, I thought I’d forgotten to lock up and the place had been robbed.”
There is something venomous within Dean, sitting between his ribs, pulling them apart – spreading his chest open until he is violently, brokenly exposed, threatening to spill out. He needs to pull something in, to pull something down with him.
"Do you know who I am, Dean?"
“I gotta go,” he says. Talbot looks worried. “It’s been a long day,” he says, “I gotta, I don’t know. Take a nap or something. I’m just gonna go to my room.”
. I hurt him enough on a day to day basis.”
Dean pulls Cas’ shirt out from where it’s tucked into his trousers, and lets himself drag his palms against the warm, smooth skin of Cas’ back. He can hear the breath hitch in Cas’ throat, and feel Cas’ nails dig into the back of his neck.
“So what’s up?” Dean says, trying to sound chill.
“I… I want to drink less.”
“Seriously,” Dean says, wiping his forehead with his t-shirt, “if this is a bad time–“
“Could you sit down for a second, do you think?” He asks, and Cas glances at the door, then sits.
He turns to face Sam, drying his hands carefully on a dish towel. “I wanna tell you that you had no right to do that.”
Dean is immediately suspicious.
Everyone around them were chanting,
The stranger hurried to his side.
“Look at you,” Cas breathes.
“I left you to pick up a mess, and I should have known you wouldn’t just abandon it– abandon dad. You’re too good for that. You’re too kind, and caring, and–
“Where did he go?”
Rows upon rows of bottles line the walls on either side of them, and in front of them shelves upon shelves. It’s an entire basement full of alcohol. Talbot leads him along the shelves and there, somewhere in the middle of it all, sits an island of armchairs and couches and, in the centre, a poker table.
(“Sam loves you.”
Dean wants to laugh. “Why? You haven’t seen me in
“Keep telling me about the Halloween party,” Dean insists, and they walk shoulder to shoulder through the park, on their way back towards the parking lot.
He wipes his hands on the rag tucked into his jeans.
Dean drinks his coffee, dizzy.
The night sky, stars and galaxies spinning in infinity, exploding and creating did not hold a candle to this. Nothing compared.
Dean, you got me really worried. I’m five seconds from getting on a plane. I miss you too, but what’s going on?
“Suck it up,” Dean says. He can’t stop smiling.
He cleared his throat, "huh, yeah, thanks."
“I’m at the airport, Sammy,” he says, “move your bangs from your ears and listen.”
From: Ricky Bryer
When he turns back around, the real estate agent is with him at the top of the stairs.
"What?" Dean said, and it felt like the perfect word at that moment.
He turns, and Cas is looking at him, face pinched and eyes wide.
“I’m glad you’re–“ he tries, “I’m not good at– I’m glad you’re here.”
“That could look nice.”
“Then why the
Talbot starts to hobble down the stairs, and Eames moves quickly to his side, trying to stabilise him.
She herds them to the counter, temporarily turned into a bar, and starts grabbing glasses.
“What?”
–––––
The phone chimes again.
Hands were gripping his again.
“Take care of yourself, yeah?” He says, voice a little rough, “I’m kind of fond of you.”
This is his life now. Sitting, shit-faced, in the cellar of a mansion, because he can’t do his job anymore when his chest feels like it’s going to cave in.
Sam had been quiet for a long time, and Dean thought he’d fallen asleep, but then he said “cheetahs can run this fast.”
“Yes,” the man says, Dean wonders if he’s a doctor, “that’s for outpatient care, which if I understood you on the phone correctly, is not an option for your father.”
Fear rushes him like adrenaline, and he’s rushing again, trying to urge, asking for something so that he doesn’t have to think, something that will ground him here, in this bed, in this place, something that will drown out that goddamn untethered-ness that’s trying to yank him up and out and pull his to pieces.
It takes a moment for Cas to speak, “are you sure? I’ll need to be dropped off and picked up, it’ll be out of your way–”
“You are kidding me, right?”
,” he says, and Cas’ arms tighten around him.
There’s no response Dean can make.
They pull to a stop and Eames immediately steps out and opens Dean’s door for him.
For a moment, he sits on the edge of the bed, listening to the wind along the stone walls. Then he puts his shoes on.
Before he gets to the driver side door, Cas stops him, a hand on his arm.
Cas is shoving kebab into his mouth at an alarming rate, but he pauses to shake his head.
From: Dean Winchester
“Schh, breathe. Cas, please breathe.”
“Great!” Talbot jumps out of the chair. He can do that now, he got the cast off. “You can come with me to this car show I have to go to. You’re a good kid for keeping me company. Meet you in the garage in 15?”
“What do I do without you I only just found you–”
Cas nodded against his shoulder. “Yes. But it’s not why I’m marrying you. That was going to happen anyway. In every version of us. In every alternate universe.”
They go golfing. It’s the worst afternoon Dean has had in his entire life.
Dean dropped the wrench. Then he started shaking with silent laughter. He looked up at Cas, eyes shining, grin stretching his lips. He leaned his hands heavily on the car, and Cas was slightly distracted by his biceps again. Cas knew he was smiling too. He always smiled back at Dean. Summer had brought out a constellation of freckles across his skin, his hair was ruffled and damp, Cas had cut it yesterday. Dean usually did it himself with a pair of kitchen scissors. When Cas found out, he had gone out and bought a real pair. Last night Dean had sat on a stool in the bathroom, laughing more and more as Cas pressed his shoulders down, insisting that he sit still or he’d cut his ear off. On purpose. Then Cas was running his hands through Dean’s hair, lightly scratching his scalp, and Dean had let his head fall to the side with a groan. Things had deteriorated when Cas leaned down to press his lips to Dean’s collarbone, then his jaw, and Dean had sort of grabbed his neck a little and made sure Cas knew exactly where he wanted him. The scissors had clattered to the floor, forgotten.
They sat on the hood of the Impala and watched the sun rise over the Grand Canyon. Dean was laughing. The world was a cascade of orange and red and incomprehensible expanse.
"–the first time we met."
“Well he got filthy rich on horses or something and moved to England. Got an antique car collection, and he called up dad a couple of days ago cause he totalled a car and doesn’t trust any of the Brits to touch it.”
“I don’t see why people have to be rude,” he says, frowning, “I know my lemon pie is good.”
“I– Yes, sir.” He steps back from the Camaro, and looks over at the Impala, sitting innocently by the wall.
He goes to John’s apartment with a pile of bills. They do that sometimes, sit at John’s little kitchen table and sort invoices and bills until they make sense, and John signs what he needs to sign so Dean can do his job.
Then he’s standing alone in John’s dirty, smelly apartment, the front door still open, and Sam is saying “I’m not landing until 9pm, can you go to a friend’s house?”
He calls Sam.
“Look,” Gabriel says, “I don’t know how much Cas has told you about his time in the army, and I don’t wanna go all big brother–“
“Well, I tried to get a hold of his insurance, but– anyway, we can pay the first three thousand upfront, and after that–“
“Shit,” Dean says, burying his face in his hand.
He finishes the rough work on the engine and gets started on the electrical system. Sometimes, he can forget what car he’s working on. It’s busy work, difficult work, and when it comes down to it, cars are like humans: largely all the same. They don’t work if things aren’t connected right. They let you know when something is hurting. They all have parts that need to do a certain amount of work for the whole to not break down.
“I’m not going to help you punish yourself, Dean.” Cas says, immediately, “Once, maybe I would have, but I am sick of violence. I refuse to beat you up just because you want me to.”
“And the car?”
The bell above the door sounds, but it’s just Gabriel, so Cas makes no move to stand.
“Okay.” Cas kissed his knuckles. “When we made up, I assured you that your intelligence and resolve amazes me every day.”
“What’s your poison?” she asks him.
She waves him over to park next to a dusty, green mustang.
It hurt something deep inside Dean's chest to see that look on this stranger.
“Do you think there’s a universe out there where we’re immortal?”
He stares at the ceiling. He moves his lips silently, to see if they work. Then the words are spilling out into the room: “I have to leave tomorrow morning,” he says into the dark. They sound cold and echo-y and so unlike him. Cas makes a noise in his throat and shuffles close.
"And I loved you long before I got… got sick. I keep thinking– I’m
“Didn’t wanna be a nurse, turns out.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, dragging a hand over his hair. He needs to cut it at some point, and shave. “I’m good. Your, uh, your tie is on backwards.”
"I have a brother named Sam Winchester, born on May 2, 1983." Dean read.
“What’s wrong?” Dean asks.
He comes with Cas deep inside of him, and when Cas comes, Dean makes sure their lips are pressed together, so that he can feel Cas’ lip trembling, and kiss him until they can breathe again.
. He thumbs past advertisements, a painful loss for Derby County rugby team and the personals, but stops at property rentals.
“I’m not
“See you at dinner,” Dean says, and walks away.
He considered the word
Dean slapped a hand to Cas’ mouth, “Jesus, Cas, don’t
He remembered going to the Grand Canyon. Twice.
“I can pay it,” Dean says to the man, a little nameplate Dean hadn’t noticed before reads Mr. Taylor, “Upfront.”
“Okay,” Cas says, as if it’s that simple.
“I want to make it through the Iliad in the original Greek.”
He didn't read the rest of the cards. He didn't have to. It was clear now why Castiel wanted him to do this out loud: while his brain failed him, his lips and his tongue knew the motions of these sentences. His body recognized them. The empty space in his mind declared them true. He stuffed the cards back in his pocket.
“What?”
"With surgery, there's a 50 percent chance of survival." and as the words passed his lips, a sense of deja-vu overwhelmed him. He recognized them – as words he's said before, as words he'd heard, as words he'd written.
Sam stares at him, says “are you serious? That’s– Dean that’s our car!” and Dean smiles for the first time in what feels like a very long time.
Dean smiles at him, as best he can. “It’s okay, Cas. Really.”
–––––
Talbot aims a thumb in the general direction Eames left in, “you spend ten years with that guy and then tell me what your defence mechanism is.”
“How did I end up here?” Dean groans. “What went wrong?”
… Thanks, but… I really don’t.”
Talbot says goodbye to him in the entrance hall, hugging him tightly with both arms and saying things Dean doesn’t register.
“I don’t know what to do,” he says. It’s awful to realise he’s crying, that the heat on his cheeks isn’t just from the slap. When he tries to wipe his face, he hisses at the sensitive skin around his right eye. “I don’t know what I can do, Sammy.” He just wants someone to tell him what the next step is. He just wants to keep treading water.
Dean’s having trouble imagining John apologising at all.
Sam took the mug out of his hands. They were shaking. He hadn’t realised. Sam looked so scared.
“Things are gonna turn out good for you, you’re resilient and badass, and you have people who love you.”
John tries to get Dean’s hands off him. “Fucking hell,” he groans, “if I want a beer I’ll have a fucking beer.”
Don’t spread my ashes anywhere though, that’s so cliché. Just bury them.
“What?”
sir? He’s not getting paid enough.”
“It’s four in the morning for me, man,” he says, “I have to crash.”
He drags his teeth over Cas’ bottom lip, pulls it in between his own, and Cas makes a low noise against him, grips him tighter, for just a moment. Then his hands become gentle, grasping at Dean’s arms, trying to hold him still. Dean doesn’t want to be still, he moves his hands to the bottom of Cas’ shirt, pushes it up, his palms against his stomach.
, this is how you repay me? With doubt and rejection?”
”We need to fix this, like, immediately. You should come over to my place and watch them. Right now.”
“You can open it,” Dean tells him, trying to get a hold of a bolt with the tips of his fingers.
“Sam, for fuck–“ he glances at the little girl next to him, who’s still staring with wide-eyed attention, “For christ’s sake, I’m not having this discussion with you right now–“
“My father had two good sons, and two disappointments. Except Gabriel chose to leave. He chose to be something other than what he was meant to be, did so willingly, happily. With much enthusiasm. I just failed.” Then he adds: “Loyalty is often complicated.”
Sam hangs up, because it’s two am in California, and Dean goes to find Talbot.
She hangs up.
He wants to keep saying it. They are the only words that don’t hurt his throat, that seem to want to fall out into the space between them and fill it up so it’s not cold and empty. But Cas looks like Dean’s slapped him, and the space between them stays.
He sits in Talbot’s ’73 Dodge Challenger outside Cas’ apartment building at five to noon, his fingers tapping the dashboard, trying not to stare at Cas’ door.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean breaths, and steps into the space Cas has made for him in his arms.
“What are you writing? Dude! What are you writing?” Dean cranes his neck to try to see. Cas puts his hand on the back of Dean’s neck and turns his head forward. Dean almost swerves the car off the road.
She doesn’t ask him why he dropped out. She lets him talk at her about the Model A for a while, though she’s nodding like she already knows the stuff.
Dean chokes on his coffee. While he laughs, Cas looks blankly at him, so he stops.
DEAN, I was talking to Sam since he got that virus on his computer and can’t afford to buy a new one AND he tells me you’ve met someone?? DUDE YOU HAVE TO TELL ME THESE THINGS. I need to know everything. Is he british?? Does he like Metallica?? Does HE have a smartphone?
If he were a better person, he thinks, he would argue more.
“Do you need to sit down?” Cas’ eyes are traveling slowly across Dean’s rumpled hair, the bags under his eyes. At least he showered and changed, so he shouldn’t be smelling as bad as he’s feeling.
“The kitchen was remodelled just seventeen months ago, so it’s in great shape,” he hears her saying, the mother humming thoughtfully.
“Okay, yeah, of course. Uh, say hello from me?”
won’t you just let me work?”
–––––
He feels he is being chased. He feels he is chasing something. If he could catch up, if he could lose himself in this, he might not feel so fucking lost.
“Whatever he said,” Cas interrupts him, voice insistent and eyes flicking back and forth between Dean’s face and the table, “he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. If he made you uncomfortable, or insinuated anything that– that you don’t–“
Sam thinks for a little while, “what do you think Stanford was for me?”
"My cousin made it clear that I was to introduce myself to you." The man stated.
Dean looks down at himself. His jeans are freshly cleaned but oil-stained, and his duffel suddenly looked grimy and sad, sunken in on itself. He shrugs, his leather jacket creaking. “This is all I got.”
The driver raises an eyebrow. “Why would that be, sir?”
“Your phone chimed, you have a text.”
“Man, shut up,” Dean grins, “Of course I’ll take you. When do you need me to pick you up?”
Then he’s knocking on the door anyway, and Talbot is telling him to come in. It’s one of the endless lounges in the damn manor, and Eames passes Dean in the door with a nod in his direction. Talbot is sitting on a sofa with his laptop open, typing rapidly, doing whatever work it is that rich people do to keep being rich.
”No. Yes. Broken wrist, nothing bad.  Or… I don’t know, Sam.”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas says, but he’s smiling a little, “did I make you uncomfortable?”
“Do you think she’s planning on killing us?” Dean asks, flicking through Cas’ copy of
“Dean.”
He tapped his foot, glared at the clock, and sighed heavily.
“We already are.”
Cas gives him a mild look, “too late. Who’s Sam?”
“I think your phone’s ringing,” Gabriel tells him.
“–American coffee as soon as I have a moment.”
“Sorry,” he says, and tries to pull his hands away.
Dean leans back in his chair. “Cool. Okay. Good.”
“This might be a mistake,” Cas says, and Dean nods. He nods and nods, packing all his hurt away, as far down as it can go. “Dean,” Cas says.
All the while, the strange, sad man stood next to him, looking at Dean like he was waiting for something.
“Can I go back to work now?” Dean says.
“Right,” Dean mutters to himself, feeling stupid.
“… I guess–“
He was eleven the first time he kissed someone. They hid behind the car on the far side of the motel, and she pressed her lips to his just for a second, before she ran off, giggling. They’d left the state the next day.
“Well,” Dean says again, “that’s not really gonna… Can I have someone sign for me?”
“Halloween is a difficult time for Gabriel,” Cas tells him, “having to decide between sweets and pranking innocent neighbours is very stressful.”
Dean says, “sure, yeah,” not really listening, distracted by how blue Cas’s eyes look against all the grey and brown behind him.
When they’re finally back in the car, it’s late afternoon and he’s eaten eight or twelve jaffa cakes on this guy’s patio. “I am so sick of tea,” he groans.
“Okay,” Dean says, and Sam looks surprised. “Did you think I would argue?”
, shut up! I’m flying out tonight,
Cas puts a hand against the side of Dean’s face, stroking his cheek, too quick, shaking too but not like Dean, not like he’s breaking apart, not like he’s scared.
Talbot’s eyes grow sad. “I don’t think you do,” he says, and Dean’s jaw clamps shut. He’s suddenly furious with Talbot, furious with how he keeps toying with Dean’s life, keeps pulling rugs out from under him.
This kiss is slow. It’s wet and close and it burns Dean’s stomach and his bones feel loose. He’s so hard it hurts. Still, he whimpers when Cas lets go of his face: a noise that slips out no matter how hard he is trying to hold, hold, hold things in, take things in, not let them out. Cas catches it with his lips.
It was a very unpleasant experience to wake up and be immediately blinded by the bright, white lights of a hospital room.
? "–but really it was David Mitcher who lived next door to us."
,” Cas thought
From two days ago, Charlie Bradbury, subject: “BRO WTF”
“What?” Dean says, then, “Oh. My dad hit me. It’s fine, it doesn’t hurt anymore.” He’s out of his element here, he can’t breathe, but suddenly he feels he can keep going, to keep talking and telling Cas things. “I’m sorry I left,” Dean says, “I’m sorry I didn’t say goodbye, but mostly I’m sorry I left.”
“Hey, Dean.”
Under his hands, the Impala disassembles piece by piece. This car was once his house, his bed, his mother and his friend. Every piece of metal he moves, he knows: the soft and the sharp edges. And as she shrinks, so does he, as if it is his own skin he is peeling off, himself he is baring to the world. The beers he brought with him run dry quickly, his eyes do not.
Dean eats some soup. “Oh my god,” he says, and eats some more. “What did you put in this, crack?”
Talbot lowers his sandwich, “you didn’t go to college?” He seems uncharacteristically worried.
, Dean thinks,
Shaking, Dean gets in the driver’s seat and shuts the door. He turns the ignition, and she rumbles smoothly alive, the lights on the dashboard shining like beacons. He pumps the break with his foot. Working. He opens the glove compartment and shuts it again. Not even a squeak. His hands flutter over the blinkers, the wipers, the hazards– working. working. working.
“Dean?”
"I'm sorry I forgot you." Dean mumbled.
“So I gotta tell you something,” he says, and a shadow falls quickly over Cas’ face. It makes his stomach churn in a new way. “On the way back, yesterday, with Gabriel–“
“We have everything.”
“Come here.”
He lies awake for a very long time, loving Cas so much it makes him feel ill.
He wonders if Cas would get it. Would he be able to see beyond the dirt and the dents, recognise the potential of this car? Find something beautiful in the process, the painstaking, slow work, and not just in the finished product.
And there it is again, that cavernous thing. That gaping precipice. Leaning up towards him, rushing up towards him and as if he can tell, Cas curls a little closer and says, voice low and husky and god has Dean wanted to hear his voice like this, wanted to know what he sounded like in this moment and here it it, it’s his to drink in and savor and have and Cas says
When he goes back to Taste Buds, he does it to prove something to himself.
“Uh. No? Just Watford today.”
“Mine too,” he says. “Sam never knew her.”
Talbot looks like he wants to stop him, but doesn’t.
In his room, he showers and puts on boxers and a t-shirt. He feels drunk, or hungover. Off-kilter anyway. The room seems different. It looks imposing and unfamiliar, taller and narrower. Dean rubs his hands through his wet hair.
Dean pondered for a moment, “I want to build a real porch.”
He spots Gabriel setting up a game of beer pong, and ducks behind the counter to hide, where he gets offered another beer by a tall girl wearing a shirt that reads ’ask me about my socialist agenda’.
To: Charlie Bradbury
“You’re American?” Dean asks, for a moment completely distracted from his coffee quest.
“We’re engaged?”
“Nothing,” he says, hating the thickness in his throat and the heat in his dry eyes. He’s just tired. “I just wanted to let you know I’m at Talbot’s place, sorry, I should have checked the time over there first.”
Dean’s fingers did not leave his hair. He leaned over Cas, up on one elbow, close and warm and so soft. “You know…” Dean cleared his throat. He was shaking.
“No, come on, I just got off the flight, I’m trying not to vomit everywhere, can we just not–“
“It wasn’t a date,” Dean says. He’s pretty sure. 90 percent sure.
Dude, you could have told me you were going back in time, I would have come with!”
"You too."
His cell-phone is one of the ones with the buttons, because he never feels older than when he tries to write a text message or look at pictures on Charlie’s touch screen one, which means he can’t actually see the face his brother is making. He can imagine it very clearly.
When Cas comes, Dean has his arms wrapped tight around his hips, pressing as close as he can get, swallowing, and Cas is shaking.
Dean turns to Cas, and puts a hand on his arm, where the t-shirt ends and his skin starts. “Wait right here,” he says, “don’t pay.”
“And get it done fast, I need you back here.”
The covers are still rumpled from where Cas slept last night, and it’s easy to push them aside to make room for the two of them. Dean runs his hands over Cas’ back, pushes their chests and hips together, and Cas breathes out, long and slow, across the skin of Dean’s throat.
One missed call: Castiel Novak.
“They say– They say either kiss me or get off me and watch the sunrise.”
He’s at Taste Buds when it opens the next morning, standing outside the locked door at 7am. His head is pounding, and he can still taste vomit in the back of his throat, under all the toothpaste. The sun is already glaringly bright, and he chugs water out of a bucket-sized bottle Eames provided him with.
“You don’t bake,” Dean says, trying not to sound too worried.
The beginning of a smile tugs at him, “he lives in this
“I know,” Dean says, and feels guilty.
He works until he can’t stand to look at her anymore, this misshapen skeleton of all he used to know.
It’s an unfamiliar scene.
and he means tonight, Dean knows he means tonight. Will you sleep here, with me, is what Cas wants to know but it’s not what Dean hears.
There’s crashing sounds in the background, and his dad curses. “You not done yet?”
Dean hangs up. Then he calls back.
Dean stepped a little closer. His hand wasn’t pressing against Cas’ chest anymore, it was just… resting there. ”Really? ’Cause I seem to remember vows and rings and a big white dress.”
Then Sam makes him get up from the floor. It’s hard. He’s shaking.
It’s been nine years. No wonder his hands feel too big for the steering wheel. No wonder his body feels too heavy to carry. She carries him, as well as she’d done when he was seventeen, when he was twelve, when he was six.
“Yeah?”
A car passes them.
“There is so much love in you,” Cas is saying back, “let me take part in it.”
"Before I went to sleep, Mary used to say that angels were watching over me."
The car was turned off. But Cas knew what he meant.
He has his hands somewhere between the alternator and the serpentine belt when his phone chimes.
He moves on. The living room is sparsely decorated, but has a nice wooden ceiling. The midday sun falls across the floor in an almost reddish hue.
“That’s so cool to hear,” Sam says, “wow, it’s crazy, isn’t it? I guess I didn’t really think about it until now, my summer internship has been kicking my ass but… that’s our
“My parents.”
“I’m not staring,” Cas says, “I’m working.”
You need to tell her to fuck off, honestly. She’s hot in that way where she thinks she can get away with shit, and it’s your job to knock her off her damn horse. It’s your game night! If Tai can’t come without her Tai doesn’t get to come either.
It goes to shit so quickly.
“I know, Dean.”
“Hey, Ricky,” Dean says, “good to see you.”
Cas gave Dean all his fries. “Not family quite yet.”
." He starts pushing Dean out of the room, grabbing the tools out of his hands and throwing them behind himself to lie discarded on the floor.
Cas winced.
“Huh,” he mutters, and puts it back. He stands, knee creaking worryingly, and pops the hood to finish tweaking the fuel injection. It only takes a couple of seconds of probing fingers for a sick sort of deja vu to settle in his stomach. He’s done that already.
“Gabriel has been having trouble with his suppliers, there’s been inconsistencies and the drivers blame the factory and the factory blames the driver and– it doesn’t matter. He needs to go into London tomorrow to sort it out and…” He trails off.
It’s really, really difficult not to drink. He checks his cabinets, he checks his bookcases, he checks his bedroom: no bottles anywhere. He doesn’t own a car anymore. He considers walking to the store. Instead, he sits himself down on the couch and makes himself stay there, forces his legs not to move.
“Indeed, sir,” Eames says, and that cup has to be full by now, but Eames just keeps pouring.
“Yeah, actually,” Sam says, “he used to babysit us, right?”
“No, I don’t.” Dean took a long drag from his beer.
(Dean was drinking coffee out of his Pendleton National Park-mug and reading the newspaper like he wasn’t sliding one socked foot further and further up Cas’ leg.)
“Gabriel took take of me,” Cas continues. “Made sure my treatment got paid for. Got me my job.”
Dean had been twelve when he drank his first beer, sitting on the hood, his dad beside him and the sun beating down on the top of his head. He had coughed and wanted to spit it out, cold and foamy and bitter, but he had forced it down and his dad had grinned at him.
“Ask not what’s brought me in, but what I brought...for you.” Dean removes a small glass container from his bag and presents it with a flourish. The sides are fogged and the top has a piece of masking tape with
He wants to say that Castiel isn’t the only one who has fallen. That he’s not alone and that Dean has faith in
Dean softens, thinking himself foolish now, but absolutely distracted by the fact that Cas is basically holding hands with him.
He’s been pacing for five minutes and has already received more than seven odd looks from students and coworkers. Yes. He’s counting.
Dean shoots her a glare. Charlie’s eyes aren’t even open.
Castiel observes the scene with a contented smile. “Oh, yes. The ladies love the daisies.” At Dean’s raised eyebrow, Castiel explains, “All worker bees, the ones who gather the pollen, are female. And, they prefer blue or purple flowers, so that’s why I’ve planted those asters there.”
“Dean! Unca Cas said I can have a cookie.”
again.
“Watch where you step.”
Bully kid spins so fast he almost twists his ankle as he scrambles in the opposite direction. He doesn’t stop to pick up the snapback hat that flies off his head, landing with the front facing Castiel.
Castiel looked conflicted but remained speechless, eyes roaming anywhere but on Dean. In the background, Sam shifted the weight on his feet but held a respectful silence.
Just three days after the burglary, the shop is looking better than ever. With all the helping hands getting Dean back on his feet, he’s able to hold the grand opening today just as planned. At the asscrack of dawn, his excitement had decided that he was done sleeping, so he called Cas over and set about putting finishing touches on the place: one final sweep of the entryway, colorful flowers from Cas’s garden in a vase by the register, and a million readjustments of each table, chair, and napkin in the place. Of course, all the fresh pastries, pies, and other baked goods for the day are displayed prominently in the replaced glass cases.
“I didn’t recognize the reference. We weren’t allowed to watch television.”
. I’m a fan of Tolkein’s literature, but Gabe’s been trying to get me to watch
“Wait, are you the one converting that old house downtown?”
“You’re doing great, Cas! Keep going!” Dean shouts over the music and Gabriel’s directions. He keeps moving but looks over his shoulder to watch Cas’s progress.
“Okaaayy! Who’s ready for pizza, cake, and presents?” Castiel interrupts. As predicted, Jack distracts the conversing adults by wriggling to be set down from where Gabriel is holding him on his shoulders.
“What do you mean
Dean is going to murder Castiel Novak.
falling into Cas’s side, and Cas has never been happier for the existence of “unfooted birds” or the concept of drunk dialing in his entire life.
“Way to butter me up, dude.” Dean runs his fingers across his forehead and drops his eyes to the hideous green carpet beneath his boots.
He didn’t need the recording to remember the speech, though. Just as the Enochian warding had once been engraved on his ribs, Castiel’s last words were seared into the grooves of his brain. They spoke for themselves.
“Some kids over in Tallahassee started getting sick. And not like seasonal flu sick. One day they were fine and the next: comatose. They couldn’t exactly blame it on pneumonia that far south, but it sounded real close to another hunt we worked years ago, so we went to help out. And whaddya know? Shtriga.”
Castiel bites the inside of his lower lip. “You know, Dean, what you did back there, in the alley… you might have saved that kid’s life.”
Castiel looks around. Most of the cars have already taken off and Dean is just kind of...standing there. “Where’d you park?”
Well, at that moment, the only feelings Dean had were destructive, and angry, and broken. This certainly wasn’t the first time Castiel had been wrong.
“Go on, Dean. Tell me more.”
“That’s the only way you could possibly improve on such a lovely flavor,” Cas says, taking another bite with more haste.
“So, you know how my pie recipe was my mom’s? Well, she also used to make the BEST chocolate chip cookies. But she didn’t write that recipe down, and no matter what I try, I can’t recreate it. I’ve tried using different kinds of sugar and vanilla. I’ve tried adjusting the temperature and the cook times. I’ve tried adding a little bit less flour and a little more butter—”
Does he mean Dean? The shop? Or both?
Castiel steps out of the bee suit and into the house, nearly tripping over a sleeping Nougat.
Jack seems to perk up at the mention of food, suddenly much more animated as he climbs up into his favorite seat at the table. “Can I have fancy pancakes, Unca Cas?” Jack still has some trouble with L sounds but Castiel is proud of how substantially his vocabulary has expanded in the past year.
Taking his mission seriously, Jack skitters off toward the front of the house. Dean chuckles at the kid’s antics.
“It is being advertised on a billboard just outside.”
Dean finds himself wanting to lean into the touch. He wishes that, for once, Cas might move the hand from his shoulder to his cheek or card those dexterous fingers through his hair. He can feel it sharply now, like so many times before: the fragile precipice on which they stand. Just a few words. Just one short motion. That’s all it would take to shatter this illusory barrier they’ve built between them, bricks of self-control sealed with a mortar of sinking sand.
“I love you, too.”
the guy he’s been infatuated with since his first day at KU. They’d met at a mixer. Bright, wide blue eyes glancing at him from across the room, a smile that crinkled the man’s entire face in the softest, most endearing way Dean had ever seen. Thighs that strained against the material of the jeans he’d been wearing that had haunted Dean’s dreams—and daydreams—ever since.
“You were?” Dean whispers, a soft look flitting across his features, before it twists into a sort of sarcastic smile. “To kick my ass?”
“Well, now you can see why I was covered in paint and drywall dust the first time we met.”
The pain in his voice, such a bleak contrast to the carefree and playful Dean from just a few hours ago, breaks Castiel’s heart. “You couldn’t have known this would happen.”
The corners of his eyes still crinkled in amusement, Dean’s demeanor softens and his joking tone dissolves completely. “They don’t stand a chance.”
as they both stumble over a few steps. Their hands are still clasped between their bodies and Dean is staring down at them.
“Oh, no, hot cocoa is great!” Cas says, picking up a mug and holding it up to his face in both palms as if savoring the heat.
“I’m sure he takes after his uncle,” Dean assures.
“You only use me for my brother’s roommate,” he grouses, forehead resting on the steering wheel. It’s an acceptance, and Charlie knows it is.
Pulling into the bakery’s gravel lot, Dean parks and douses the headlights, spending a few moments checking missed messages from the drive home. He’s got four from Cas—three pictures and one text—and one from his brother, a voicemail asking about coming by for the grand opening in a few days. It’s late, so he’ll get back to Sam tomorrow. Dean steps out of the Impala and locks her up, opening the pictures as he walks to the front door.
Dean’s face falls and he kicks himself for being so naive, but he clamps his teeth together, replacing the disappointment with irritation.
Suddenly exhausted, Dean pulled the nearest chair away from the table and dropped into it like a sack of flour, slumping forward in defeat. “I know. I’m sorry. It just…feels like giving up on him. Today is literally groundhog’s day, and if that isn’t the perfect metaphor... ”
Dean lowered his voice and tried to tamp down the self-loathing chewing on his rib cage.
with Cas, hot cocoa had become a tradition on chilly movie nights and tonight is no exception. Dean hopes they don’t lose power. The meteorologist had forecast quite the blizzard ahead of them, which can already be heard picking up steam beyond the shuttered kitchen windows.
Castiel takes a long sip from his steaming coffee mug and tries to savor the calm before the storm. He breathes in what should be a refreshing mocha scent but is reminded of the hot cocoa from the other night and how awkward he’d made things between himself and Dean. He scrubs both palms into the grooves beneath his tired eyes and rises from the reclining chair with a yawn.
This time, Sam gives a choked noise of shock and Dean chortles as Cas punches Gabe’s arm.
. In any way you’ll have me.”
Cas raises two fingers to pinch the bridge of his nose.
Dean knows he hasn’t been the most subtle, but he can’t help himself. Neither of them had grown up with much of a happy upbringing, so seeing Cas blissfully in his element and acting as a positive parental figure to Jack is something Dean wants to savor. It doesn’t hurt that the beekeeper is easy on the eyes.
“Oooh yes!”
Cas moves both hands into Dean’s hair and rains kisses on his temples, his forehead, his nose, his chin. Forehead-to-forehead, they catch their breath together for a few moments before Cas gives one more quick peck to Dean’s lips and settles down beside him, draping an arm over his heaving chest and snuggling close. Dean wraps his arms around the other man, completing the circle. They lie there in comfortable silence for a while, enjoying the come-down.
They stare at each other for a few moments before Cas leans in and gently presses his lips to Dean’s, his eyes sliding closed. Dean lets out such a deep sigh, something that sounds like it came all the way from his
When he finally resurfaces for air, Dean swallows heavily. “I’ve never done this before.”
“And I’m sure I’ve got some family-friendly flicks I could pull up so you don’t have to scramble for a sitter every time,” Dean offers, walking with Cas to the door.
“Oh, shit.”
The edge of Dean’s mouth twitches faintly and his gaze lowers. “Thanks, Cas.”
“Dean?!”
“—the
“It’s perfect!”
“No!”
Checking his temper, Dean offers a soft, “That must feel awful.”
“Oh, shit!” the bully yells, dropping the other kid who holds his bleeding cheek in one hand and runs off at Dean’s urging.
Dean leans in and rests an ear on Cas’s shoulder, his nose tucked into the curve of his neck. He sighs softly, feeling some of the weight of his mind siphoned away by the hands around his waist. Reluctant to leave the embrace, he pulls his head back to face his boyfriend.
Regardless of the annoyingly pedantic way his little brother showed affection, he knew Sam was dead-on—about everything—but Dean couldn’t let the kid get a big head to go with the rest of his gargantuan body.
“To ask you to dinner, actually.” Cas keeps his tone light, just in case he’s read this entire thing wrong and Dean’s complimentary attitude had simply been the result of alcohol consumption and a flirtatious personality.
“If you’d like, I’d be happy to give you a tour of the hives. But, they’ll be quite stationary during the winter as they huddle to keep the colony warm and insulated.”
“I’m never fucking drinking with you ever again.”
A few hours later, Castiel sits on the white porch swing with Jack on his lap, using the tips of his shoes as leverage to propel them both forward and back. Upon what Castiel figures is probably the 5,874th swing of the morning (at Jack’s insistence), he hears the rumble of a powerful engine and correctly surmises that it belongs to Dean’s sleek classic car before it makes itself visible, turning down the drive toward the farm. In the daylight, the impressive gleam of the Impala reflects the fall foliage lining the pathway as it comes to stop neatly beside Castiel’s truck.
“Dean,” Cas interrupts, “your cookies are fantastic.”
Staring off into the night sky, Dean gives another nod, idle fingers playing with the edges of his worn leather jacket. “This is really the first time we’ve spent any length of time apart. I practically raised him after Mom died and Dad buried himself in his work.”
he’d realized Cas was the one who was always bringing bagels and coffee into the faculty lounge. That sustenance was the only thing that got Dean going some mornings.
to rile Dean up.
A smile ghosts Cas’s lips as he looks up, eyes shining fondly even as he shakes his head. “It’s not. But he’s a good kid. Nothing like his father, thank goodness.”
Cas lets out a startled laugh, and Gabe is staring at the phone like it’s suddenly sprouted the feet that Dean seems so fixated on.
Dean mimics the motion with his spoon. “Mmm,” he says in appreciation, savoring how the sweetness of the honey combines with the punch of cinnamon. “The recipe was my mom’s, but I tweaked it. Honey gives it a more gooey consistency that I just love and I want to share that with the world. Or, at least the parts of the world that visit my bakery when it opens.”
Cas’s smile puts the moonlight to shame.
Maybe Castiel didn’t feel the same now that he’d returned. What if Dean had misunderstood his meaning as romantic when it had been meant platonically, more familial? It wasn’t like he hadn’t told Dean he’d loved him in the past. At the end of the day, Castiel would always be an angel. An otherworldly being. Just because he’d made human connections and used human terms didn’t mean he interpreted them the same way. Didn’t mean he experienced love the same way.
The days were dragging themselves out as the Winchesters continued searching for the far-flung ingredients they’d need for the summoning. Progress was slow, so Dean had insisted they keep up with saving people in the meantime. In fact, he’d been running himself ragged with it, but he needed to feel useful in the times when he wasn’t getting any closer to finding Castiel.
“Okay, so what’s the deal?” Dean asked, trying his best not to be impatient.
A spike of trepidation jolts straight from his head to his gut as he fumbles for the lightswitch, flipping it a few times to no effect. Breath held, he activates the flashlight feature on his phone and sweeps it across the room, illuminating a scene that sends a cold wave of devastation crashing over him, rooting him to the spot. What had been a fully renovated storefront when he left this morning is now a graveyard of splintered tables and overturned chairs, lightbulb shards strewn across the floor, busted display cases, and graffiti expletives spray painted over smashed subway tile.
The only thing left to take care of is to finish mounting the new security system that had just come in.
And how wrong it feels to be having a
Returning the hug, Dean rests his ear and cheek against Cas’s hair and closes his eyes. He’s so caught up in the tenderness, he doesn’t even hear the sound of someone approaching, their footsteps lost to the quiet hum of the other patrons.
“Hey, Cas. I know it’s been a while since my last call. We’ve started hunting again in between trying to track down leads on breaking you out. They’re...few and far between. But we just got back from a case with Claire, actually.”
Dean yelled and threw his beer bottle across the room where it exploded and cracked his mirror, broken glass crashing into the sink. That was going to be a bitch to clean later, but he didn’t care. Everything around him broke eventually. It was his turn this time.
,” Castiel says, his heart beginning to race.
Thursday evening, at 4:55 p.m., Dean fusses about the bakery’s kitchen like a fly at a picnic. He triple checks the stove to make sure the rolls aren’t burning. He straightens the cutlery for the second time. He dunks a pair of tongs into the salad bowl at the center of the table. Salad isn’t really Dean’s bag, but Cas seems like the kinda guy who’d back Sam up on the organic health food schtick.
“Starting to?” Gabriel casually rocks back and forth in the recliner with his arms crossed, watching Castiel’s dizzying efforts to wear a track into the carpet.
theater. You know, with living people on a stage? Actually, that reminds me. I’m closing up early today to head over there. Tonight is improv night.” He pulls a quarter-folded pamphlet out from his apron and flips it toward Dean between two fingers. “You should go if you want to get a taste of the local flavor.”
Dean swallows, chest heating against his best efforts. He wants to tell him that he believes Cas has been doing the impossible long before they met. That he’s the one who makes Dean question his poor self-value every day, makes him feel like he’s more than just his brother’s keeper. That if Cas wants to raise this kid together, the two of them pretending to be fathers instead of just friends, Dean will follow his lead even if it kills him.
Angry tears boil hot around his eyes as he slips into the familiar cloak of self-loathing.
Cas’s pocket plays a tune a few moments later and he nods. “And I think that’s my cue. Thank you again for having me over for dinner. I had a great time.”
“Tell me what you want from this, Cas.”
Once satisfied that they had been mixed properly, Sam set the container onto a table in the middle of a summoning sigil. He picked up the crimson knife and turned to Dean. “You sure about this?” Sam’s brows knit into that overturned U-shape they always formed when he was concerned.
He hears Cas huff a laugh, which—at least Cas isn’t
And directly in front of Cas and Dean, the announcer from earlier sits with one ankle balanced on the opposite knee, watching as people continue filing into the rows of seats. He spots Cas and grins, waving with the microphone. Cas gives him a small wave in return.
“Let me at least help with the dishes,” Cas says, standing with his plate in hand.
With his chin cradled, Cas lifts his hands to overlap Dean’s fingers and presses into the touch, closing those gorgeous blue eyes that remind Dean of a cloudless summer sky. Unable to resist the opportunity, Dean pulls his lover’s face forward and plants a soft kiss onto even softer lips.
“Alright, Leif Eriksson. Let’s go find seats.”
“Ah...Dean,
A brief look of surprise is replaced with a faint smile. “Yeah, I’d like that.”
Cas scratches the back of his neck. “I have custody of my nephew, Jack. His mother passed away and my brother is incarcerated. In the immortal words of Gabriel, Luce is
They’d spent the first part of the movie reluctant to speak, but the moment Harrison Ford appeared on screen, Dean had been too excited to keep from quoting
Because Dean would be the worst partner in the world if he ever made Cas doubt that he wants this, wants them, wants him. He studies the fine lines and muscles in Cas’s face for any hint that he’s uncomfortable and almost forgets Sam is standing right there.
“Oh, that’s
Dean bumps his nose against Cas’s with a playful laugh. “I would kiss your grumpy face every day for the rest of our lives if you’d let me.” Realizing how much that sounds like a proposal, Dean’s face goes as pink as Cas’s nose had been when he’d entered the shop.
“Behave, would you?” Cas pleads, which is about as useful as Gabe telling Cas not to worry.
Cas’s face falls. “Speaking of, I should really get home to relieve the sitter.”
“This was lovely, Dean. Really. I’d stay if I could.” Cas stands and folds the blanket he’d had around himself, returning it neatly into the bin. He stretches his arms skyward to awaken stagnant muscles from sitting still for so long, and Dean catches a flash of skin as Cas’s shirt hitches with the motion.
“I know that look. What’s on your mind, honeypie?” Cas asks, drawing Dean into his arms after a quick peck on the lips. He’d taken to calling him that after their honey apple pie had won first place in the county fair.
“Oh, right,” he mutters, smacking his lips together to get his mouth working, if not his mind. It’s too late—early?—to form coherent thoughts, such as how he should’ve trimmed the tree outside the guest room so that it doesn’t scratch at the window with its bare branches and scare a sleeping child. But something he knows more instinctually, on a subconscious level, is that he loves this kid as much as he loves his uncle and never wants Jack to feel afraid. “Yeah, sure. Get up here.”
“Great job staying in the lines, bud,” Castiel commends. Jack goes back to coloring.
“Hey, Cas,” he rasped, swallowing and clearing his throat again. “I— I know you can’t hear this any more than you could hear a prayer right now, but I just…I miss you, man. I can’t— I don’t know what to do.”
would have been caught eavesdropping and he determined once and for all that he was
“And here comes dessert,” Dean says as he gets to the top of the stairs, carefully balancing the tray of goodies. He walks steadily over to the coffee table and sets the tray beside the DVD folder. “I know it’s a lot of sugar, so if you’d rather a cup of water or something, lemme know.”
Then where is Cas? Why would he leave without saying a word? The sick part of Dean tells him that Cas probably regrets what happened and couldn’t have gotten away fast enough. Another surge of uneasiness roils his insides as he realizes that he can’t even call Cas now with his broken phone and the contact number stored there.
“Air quotes that I can hear should
All at once, Cas leans in and Dean moves his hand from his cheek to wrap around the back of Cas’s neck, mouths colliding like the tide meeting the shore, a force of nature simultaneously chaotic and assured.
It was gone.
“Tempting. But there’ll be time for that later. And I think I might enjoy making you squirm with anticipation throughout the day.”
Having reached the end of their meal and a natural conclusion to their discussion on the best books worth reading (Dean leaning a little more sci fi and Cas more high fantasy), Dean jerks a thumb over his shoulder at a set of stairs where a rope barrier is currently fastened to one side for easy access. “If you’re finished, I’ll clean up here and you can head up to the living room. I’ve got a few streaming services you can browse and a sleeve of old DVDs on the coffee table. Guest picks the movie on movie night!”
Soon, they’re all seated and munching happily on an assortment of cake, cookies, and of course pie. The taste of cherry pie filling brings up a memory of Dean’s summers on the road when he’d pick up cheap gas station hand pies just for the nostalgia of his mother’s cooking. Chewing on oatmeal raisin gets Sam to talk of helping his girlfriend with a bake sale on campus. A bite of lemon meringue inspires Cas’s thought of someday visiting France. Around and around the table, they trade stories.
Whether minutes or hours later, Dean is awoken by a small hand patting his face and the sound of sniffling. He and Cas had fallen asleep face-to-face in a jumble of limbs and body-heated fabric, but at some point, they had shifted so that Dean was on his stomach, head turned toward the door.
Dean lifted his eyes and found Castiel’s etched with apprehension and adoration and something else, something like longing. Dean whispered, confirming what Castiel seemed to be asking, “You weren’t supposed to hear it that way.”
“I want
Dean reaches out and grabs Cas’s hands into his own, palm-to-palm, entwining their fingers and yanking Cas forward into an equally surprised but receptive kiss. From across the room, Gabriel whoops, drawing attention to the scene and causing the room to erupt in cheers and claps. But to Dean, it’s all background noise. He pulls away with a dopey smile of his own. “Cas, you’re incredible. I don’t know what I did to deserve you.”
Castiel backed up enough to study Dean’s face in the lamplight. “I lo—”
win. But Castiel was gone and Dean had no idea what to do next, despite his determination to rescue the angel.
The backyard area is much more expansive than the front, the entirety of the property deceptively large. Just as the front drive had sloped down toward the house, the backside of the lot dips until it connects with the neighbors’ plot. More trees, like the one out front by the vehicles, speckle the landscape ahead, casting shade onto the field in the afternoon sunlight.
out of him
Cas smirks. “What’s important is which uncle. If I keep using Gabriel as a babysitter, his influence will make sure I never survive Jack’s high school years.”
He paces around the living room until his cup is empty, only pausing once to watch the sun rise in brilliant orange and yellow hues over the slight hill that sits between the farm and the main road. As he rinses out his cup, he hears a soft scuffing of the linoleum and turns to find Jack shambling into the kitchen, a stuffed rabbit trailing close behind. Castiel puts on an authentic smile, fatigue ignored at the sight of spaceship pajamas and tousled hair. “Good morning, birthday boy! Are you hungry for breakfast?”
“I know it ended on a sour note, but I’m glad you decided to join us tonight.” He fiddles with the watch on his wrist and huffs a laugh. “I can’t imagine the scene Gabe would have made trying to get me up on that stage without you there.”
“Oh, hush. I love you, and you know that.” She scoots across the bench seat and smacks a kiss on his cheek, gripping his head dramatically as she does and making a loud
“Do that again,” Dean gasps, and he doesn’t wait to slide one hand up the side of Cas’s neck, thumbing along the stubble at the corner of his jaw and coming to rest at the base of his ear. The other hand grabs Cas’s shoulder and tugs.
Other thoughts tried to seep through, but there wasn’t room for anything else, his mind suffocating on those eight letters. Everything was fuzzy, as if he were the one enveloped in shadow, absorbed by darkness.
after your text, Cassie. What kind of uncle do you think I am?”); a new art table complete with gel paints, chalk, and markers from Castiel; and a remote controlled car and a super soft blanket patterned like a tortilla from Dean (“Every good burrito needs some pepper Jack cheese!”).
Spit it out, Cassie!”
Ingredients and baking tools are strewn all across the counter tops. A carton of eggs. A bowl with a whisk. A baking sheet. A roll of wax paper. Measuring spoons.
In his dread, he flexes his hand to grip the sheets and it pulls at the bandage wrapped around it, placed there
“That ador—
“These look great, Jack. Thank you for this breakfast of champions.”
“His name is Chazaqiel.”
“So, before we get to the apiary,” Cas starts as they pass a carefully manicured herb and vegetable garden where Dean imagines Cas probably talks to his plants while he waters them, “There are some rules to be aware of. Jack, what’s rule number one?”
“Nuh uh. My turn.” Dean leaned in, pressed his lips against the cusp of Castiel’s ear, and pulled him closer. He was done waiting.
“Oh?”
Castiel reaches down to pat Jack’s head as the child hovers close to Castiel’s pant leg, unsure of the new face before him. “It’s okay, Jack. This is Uncle’s friend. Can you say hello?”
Dean points one index finger in rebuttal but silently grabs several more jars of cinnamon honey and pays for them because, as he explains, he’s stocking up an entire bakery by himself and he can only carry so much. That means he’ll have to shop often, thank you very much.
“So, maybe I’ll see you there?” Cas asks.
and watches through the window as large snowflakes bathe every outdoor surface in clouds of ice. He takes a seat in one of the booths and waits for Cas and Jack to show up, trying not to worry about them driving in the oncoming stormy weather. The wind howls like a banshee, tumbling furiously between tree limbs and around cars, over rooftops and through gutters, bullying the snow into flurries.
Out on the screened-in porch, Cas removes a kid-sized beekeeping suit from a hanger. He gets Jack situated into it, fastening the zipper before putting the netted hat over the boy’s head and a pair of gloves on his hands. Once Jack is outfitted, he passes one adult suit to Dean and grabs another for himself to don.
Castiel makes a strangled noise. He’s not getting enough oxygen to form words. He shoves his phone at Gabe.
“Dean, I think maybe you should go now,” Castiel says, reaching for his phone. The man has obviously had quite a bit to drink, and even though Dean is the one who called
“Hey, come on in,” Dean welcomes Cas at the entryway, gesturing inside to the warmth of the storefront.
A throat clears. “Uh, hey Dean.”
, too. Someday he’ll be brave enough to say those things aloud because Cas deserves to hear them, damn it. But all the pretty words get caught in his throat and what comes out is a whisper.
“Is this—” a voice slurs through the phone. Though its owner is
too heavy for asking someone out for the first time, but he can’t help himself. “I would
“Says the guy who tried to eat purgatory,” Dean laughs, shaking his head as he leaves the room.
freckles. He’d always had a weakness for freckles. And those wide shoulders, practically forcing their way out of the dress shirt that covered them, with a torso that tapered into slim hips and the cutest damn legs Castiel had ever seen? He’d never stood a chance.
Given what they’re about to do, Dean grins at the unintended pun. “Yeah! Alright, Space Ranger. Lead the way.”
“Gabriel!” Castiel shouts.
Dean groaned at the interruption. How had Gigantor hidden his steps so well? “No one. I’m just on the internet watching cats do stupid things.”
An arm encircles Dean’s waist and pulls him closer but with their bodies aligned, Cas pushes Dean against the sink, gasping into his mouth. Dean moans around the kiss, brow furrowed and tongue darting fervently between Cas’s soft lips. Cinnamon and sugar mingle as they continue to explore each other in this way, licking and suckling, until Cas feels Dean growing hard between them.
“And then— and then I watched you go. I didn’t even try to stop you. Why didn’t I stop you, Cas?” The tears were back. So much for not crying. “Why couldn’t I tell you that I—”
Jack takes Dean’s hand and tugs him outside. Dean tilts back to face Cas as he’s pulled along and shrugs happily. Cas smiles behind his face net and follows close behind.
“Well, happy birthday to me, I guess. My gift to myself is from you! You were right about me, about my motiv— motivations.” The furniture in the room was starting to blur and words were getting tougher to form, but this was important, even if the message died on his lips. “I just didn’t realize it. Or I was too chickenshit. I dunno. But
“Nerf herder.” Cas launches an arm at Dean’s ribs for more tickling at the dig, but Dean catches his wrist mid-flight and holds it.
Jack comes hopping over at that, Gabriel tailing close behind. “Can I have cookies now, Dean?”
“Because the next time I die, I’ll get to spend my eternal afterlife with you.”
By the time Dean could form a coherent thought that didn’t include blue eyes and a trenchcoat, Sam had long stopped calling. The phone lay motionless and silent beside Dean’s body which had curled in on itself and was shaking with each painful inhalation. Maybe Sam assumed Dean had disappeared along with all the others.
“You better bee-lieve it,” Dean says, drawing a lighthearted eye roll from Cas, who shuts off the television and ushers Jack to the back door after helping him back into his shoes.
“Cheers to that,” Dean says with a gentle smile, figuring Cas might appreciate a change of topic. He tips his glass toward Cas, then tilts it back and into his mouth. The blackberry and honey flavors mingle palatably, sort of like a boozy pie drink. “Huh. M’not normally a wine drinker—and I’ll be damned if you catch me admitting it to anyone else—but this is nice.”
“Do you dream in the Empty? Do you remember anything? Because I can’t forget. No matter what I do, I can’t get you out of my head, man.” Dean’s voice broke as he started replaying Castiel’s last words again.
“I didn’t even say anything!”
In an exaggerated motion, the fork takes a chunk of pastry and apple filling past his lips, sliding back out with just as much sluggishness. Cas chews and hums an unnecessary note of deliberation.
“I’m glad you’ve got it all figured out. You sure are smart.”
Black ambrosia fills Dean’s favorite mug—a birthday present from Cas last year, covered in Zepp song quotes. Dean winks at Jack who sneaks a handful of chocolate into his mouth while Cas is distracted.
“Give it a rest, Winchester. You had fun,” Charlie says. “Now, go sleep on the couch or something. I need my space.”
“Will be fine,” Gabriel interrupts. “Kid’s out cold and I’ve got nowhere else to be. So, go make sure your boy toy’s in one piece and just let me know how it goes, alright?”
An hour later, Dean flips the new window sign from “
“When you said all that stuff about me, when I realized what was happening,” his throat constricted at the memory but he pressed on, “it was like I’d been caught in Jell-o or something. Everything was slower and way too fast at the same time. I couldn’t do anything but stand there and be useless while you poured your guts out to me.”
At the curious lift of Cas’s brow, Dean clarifies, “Sex. Well, not

“I thought it was bad when Lucifer killed you the day Jack was born. Having to— having to pick you up from the cold ground and wrap you in a goddamn curtain and carry you to the pyre and then— and then it was just
It’s just a coincidental bonus that he also gets to chat up his new friend at the honey stand.
“Alright, Red. But if I see any of my students there, I’m bailing,” he warns, passing the device back to its owner.
Castiel looks up to find Dean’s green-eyed gaze staring intently back and a warm smile spreads across Dean’s face. “Then you’re just where you need to be.”
“So,” Dean says as he plops the holiest of munchkins on the unholiest of bedspreads and settles a wooly blanket around him, “What do we call you, huh?”
Pausing a beat too long, Cas looks away, playing it off like he was just taking in the scenery. Maybe it’s the mead talking, but Dean starts to think that maybe the scrutiny has a deeper meaning.
“Back home in Kansas, studying to be a lawyer. I’m happy for him, but he’s been one of the only reliable people in my life. It was hard to leave that behind, ya know?” The alcohol starts to make Dean’s head swim pleasantly.
With a flutter of his robe, coffee cup clutched in one hand and bedhead unperturbed, Cas moves to inspect the job Jack has done so far. “Yep. Nice work. What do we need to do next?”
“Well, the trial comes in that I can’t help you. You’re going to have to find the components and perform the ritual on your own, or else it won’t work. I’m sorry I can’t do anything else, but this is already more than I said I would do and any further divine interference might tip off the Shadow,” Jack said, the flames dimming as he quieted.
be sexy,” Dean grumbles, but then he’s up and pulling Cas to the door.
“It’s nice to meet you.” Dean gestures back toward his car. “I brought you a few things for your birthday. Do you think you could be my big helper and carry something inside for me?”
Cas withdraws his hand and places it alongside the other in his lap. “Very well.”
“Why would the police— Oh.” Castiel suddenly understands Dean’s meaning. “No, I won’t be committing fratricide,” he reassures. “But Gabe shouldn’t be surprised if I dump some Skittles in his M&M bowl next time I visit.”
“We can play around later. I just don’t want either of you getting stung. The bees can get agitated by sudden movements.” Castiel points to a spot a short distance away from the closest hive. “Hang out right there for a minute.”
“Almost five years,” Cas replies, setting down his glass and piling leafy greens onto his plate from the salad bowl. He drizzles vinaigrette dressing over the top and sighs. “It was time I got my own place, but I moved here rather suddenly after my folks kicked me out.”
Dean didn’t let him finish his sentence, stealing the words with another kiss. Castiel laughed around Dean’s mouth, his joy palpable.
“Uh.” Castiel blinks. “The bird inspector? Do you mean the bird professor?”
“Oh, and uh, since he sleeps, does that mean he’ll also need to eat? And, you know…?” Dean waves vaguely toward the bathroom.
When Cas laughs, Dean laughs with him, pleased to see the mirth return.
“Mornin’, sunshine. Need any help?”
“So you have your own hives and everything? What’s that like?”
While the first batch of pancakes is starting to brown, Castiel gets some fresh strawberries from the fridge and a banana from off of the hanger on the counter. He rinses the strawberries and retrieves a small cutting board and fruit knife before having to flip the pancakes. Alternating between slicing the fruit and checking on the pancakes, Castiel finishes cooking breakfast within a few minutes.
For the third time in the same week, Dean walks into the honey stand. He gives a little wave and saunters over to the counter when Cas sees him.
While waiting for his burger order to finish cooking, Dean steps behind the one patron currently at the bar. A chalkboard sign advertises the bar menu full of craft beers, standard alcoholic fare, and “This Week’s Special: Angel’s Honey Mead.”
Dean thinks he can come up with a few entertaining ideas, alright. But what he says is, “Sure, man. Speaking of...what is there to do for fun around here? You’re the only person in this town I’ve talked to longer than five minutes, aside from my realtor.”
The first photo is of Dean with Jack on his back from their time horsing around on the way to the bees. He hadn’t even seen Cas with his phone out to take the picture, and it makes him smile to know that Cas had indulged them for a moment before telling them to knock it off.
Sliding his hands up Dean’s broad chest, Cas leans forward to cage their mouths in another kiss, hungrier than the last, hips grinding with the movement and drawing a whimper out of Dean.
With a conspiratory smile, Dean beckons Jack around the corner. “Alright, hang tight right there for just a second, okay?”
A whispered voice from the nearby darkness asks, “Can I sleep in your bed? I’m scared.”
Jack paused and, as Sam fumbled his way through translating as best he could to Eileen, Dean started to wonder if the holy wifi had dropped somehow. He raised his eyebrows. “Should? Forgive the skepticism, pal, but why do I get the feeling this’ll be harder than it sounds?”
When Castiel looks up, he freezes for half a second and Dean almost swears there’s a flush on the other man’s cheeks. He clears his throat as Dean walks fully into the stall and up to the counter.
“They wiggle their abdomens to point the rest of the hive in the direction of the best flowers. Then they loop around and do it again to ensure the message gets across,” Castiel continues, drawing a circle in the air as he explains.
Ah, there it is. Cas doesn’t think Dean is cut out for the task after all.
Chaz opens his mouth but promptly closes it and shakes his head, loose curls bouncing against his face.
Reeling from the unintentional vulnerability, Dean swayed. Castiel’s phone dropped to the mattress as he rose from the chair and reached out his other arm, steadying Dean at the shoulder.
you do anything. I came back from getting us the drinks that
” Castiel didn’t identify himself, but there was no mistaking the awkward earnestness of the angel. “
Dean squinted at Castiel as if the latter had been speaking Enochian. He wanted to be human? “Why?”
The man steps around the counter. As he approaches, Dean is distracted by the intense blue eyes giving him a rapid appraisal, undoubtedly catching the paint and spackling paste splattered all over Dean’s clothes. “Well, that would probably be the cinnamon,” he says, reaching to tap the shelf in front of the specified item. “But it really depends on what you plan to use it for. For tea, I would recommend the lemon. For toast, I prefer the peach.”
“Yeah, Castiel?”
“I think we are.”
He was leaning over an early sixties Ford Mustang that afternoon. It was one of the perks of the job; in between the Toyota Yaris' and the rusty jeeps, a good old american classic would come through for him to get his hands on. He would never tell his boss, but he always took just a little extra time on those. Not enough that the customers would ever notice, but enough to let him sigh over beautiful machinery for a little bit longer.
“You tip well,” Cas tells him, sounding pleased.
“Hey, Dean, what’s up?”
Blood rushes in Dean’s ears.
He was smiling when the door slammed open. “Cas?
–––––
There’s a pause, and Dean starts to feel stupid. “No, it’s okay.”
He clenched his hands in the sheets. "This is so fucked up. I just lost three years of my life. In five minutes." A warm hand covered his. Cas looked at it as if he was as surprised as Dean at where his hand had ended up and tried to pull it back but Dean, surprising himself, turned his hand and took a firm hold of Cas' fingers. They felt nice against his, and he'd just lost three years of his life, and if he wanted to hold someone's hand he was damn well going to do just that.
“Thank you for everything you did for me.” He speaks carefully, like he’s rehearsed this too. “I leaned on you, and you’re the best brother anyone could ask for. And I’m sorry I left you to deal with a mess you shouldn’t have had to deal with, that no kid should have to deal with.”
. He stopped trying to tug at his IV and started trying to tug his hands out of the other man's grip instead, he didn't know who this was, or why he was in Dean's hospital room. Why was
Dean squints at him. “You’re such a little shit.”
Cas kisses him, and for a second he thinks, maybe– but then he’s being led to the couch, and Cas curls up against him, both of them still wearing jeans, and presses close close close for long moments. Cas pulls a blanket over them, and Dean holds his face in his hands and presses kisses to his cheeks and it’s the gentlest thing he’s done since he held his newborn brother in his arms for the first time, feeling clumsy and scared but wanting to do something right.
Something tender and aching fills Dean’s chest, and he’s starting to recognise that pain for what it is now. He thinks it’s just the shape that love takes in him.
Sam eyes him carefully, “everyone’s got shit,” he says. “And people move.”
There was a pause. The air still felt heavy with Sam's sympathy, and with Cas' sadness, and with Deans deep, deep confusion.
Cas turns the sign to “open” and unlocks the door.
Cas’ smile sits behind his eyes, soft and wide.
“That’s awesome, Dean,” Sam says, “It must be so weird for you, I can’t imagine…” He trails off and Dean doesn’t have any words to fill in for him. “Still think it’ll take two months?”
(You’ll get the house. Please stay in it, if you can.
"–I was told that I have a brain tumor, located in my hippocampus."
“Yes, sir. Is everything okay with the shop?”
Meg comes in at nine am, and flips him off when she sees him.
“Do I have time to finalise my will?”
I’ll call you tonight.
He gets placed on a stool by the island in the modest little stainless steel kitchen. Cas hands him a towel, which he uses to dry his face and scrub at his hair. When he looks up, Cas is watching him. Then he turns around and pulls a put out of a cabinet.
“Hello, boys,” Gabriel says, and pulls up a chair. Dean groans. “What are we talking about?”
Cas went upstairs.
“Hi, dad,” he says, glancing back.
That’s definitely Gabriel in the background. Cas shushes him. “What’s on your mind, Dean?”
“He’s also not the type to give up on things.”
The cards bent under his clenching fingers. That was a secret, not even Sam knew that. He flipped to the next one.
Dean’s heart is fucking pounding.
They were married.
His chest expands to take in oxygen, and he breathes out slowly, between his teeth, trying to stop his jaw from trembling, the hot prickling in his eyes.
There was a scar running across the back of his left hand and he had no idea how he got it– his nails were clean they were never clean– his left forefinger was crooked at the first knuckle like he'd broken it not too long ago–.
“I am,” he insists. “I just–“ He doesn’t know how to finish, but Cas just waits. “I don’t know when he stopped needing me, I guess.”
He doesn’t say anything.
He tries to remember if he’s ever done this before. If being naked with someone has every been about anything other than sex.
Cas smiles down at him, “Meg-themed,” he says, and Dean wants to kiss him so bad. Instead, he just wraps his hand around Cas’ ankle and squeezes.
“I like this place,” he says.
He primed the Impala yesterday, but was only halfway through the second sanding when a sudden smattering of rain had appeared above.
“People do that all the time.”
Dean always disliked hospitals. Not because he felt particularly adverse to needles, he could not care less about the smell and the color scheme, and he hadn't been scared of Doctors since he was five. What annoyed him about hospitals wasn't even that they made you wait five hours before they poked at your wrist to tell you it was broken when you clearly already knew that. No, what
They kissed.
It’s a ten minute drive until he starts closing in on the Leatherhead town centre. It’s a small, old little town. Cute, almost. He parks the car on the side of a street and marches up and down streets until he finds a little café, nestled between a candy shop and a travel agency. He frowns up at the name of the business, “Taste Buds”. It seems like a new low. Then he marches inside.
When he thinks Talbot’s out of the house, he fixes every single thing he can find wrong with Talbot’s cars.
Then, Cas asks, “did you always want to be a mechanic?”
Even here, naked and close and hard, Cas flushes, high on his cheeks. Dean wants to make him look that happy all the time.
Dean rolls his eyes, feeling awkward and defensive. “It wasn’t real.”
Dean’s stomach hurts. “Cas, you don’t have to–“
“Meg broke everything. Café closed tomorrow for the electrician.”
Nothing hurts as much as when Dean forgets that he’s even sick.
“No!”
“Winchester?” a man says, “not like John Winchester?”
Talbot powers on, “I can’t talk long, I’m just calling to make sure you’re home this afternoon, the car’s gonna be delivered to your front door, and there’s a paper you have to sign that it’s arrived in the expected condition.”
of the Indiana Jones movies? That guy is a
Watford is a boring place, which is unsurprising. Cas, though. Cas is fucking wonderful. Dean has never really met someone who is funny in the way Cas is funny, before. His remarks – about the weather, about Dean’s stories, about how Gabriel keeps playing tricks on Dean, like hiding his phone in the coffee bean pot – continually toe the line of sarcasm, but always land on the side of genuine, good-natured commentary.
The guy looks at him with narrowed eyes. “If you have a seat, I will bring you a cup of coffee–“
When she pulls a joint out of her pocket and lights it, glancing over her shoulder, he groans.
“I didn’t ask you to–”
"Read."
He calls out before he can stop himself. His nails dig into Cas’ back. Then Cas does it again, never looking away, holding Dean’s hip steady with one hand, leaning on his other elbow, placed so his hand can cradle Dean’s jaw and of course, of course this is how he would do this: giving Dean what he needs, clear blue eyes never looking away, looking fearlessly, tenderly, not shying away from all those ugly things Dean is trying to hold inside, all that empty space.
Dean was still muttering to himself, looking on edge and uncomfortable. Cas made him leave the bag on the kitchen counter then grabbed his hand. He looked sad.
, he tells it.
“But–"
Other than that, the waste basket is full, the floor covered in dirty footprints, and nothing seems amiss. Except the plant in the window is dead. Dean tips it into the trash and pushes it down with his boot so it won’t spill everywhere. Then he puts the empty pot back on the window sill.
“You’re goddamn right you didn’t.” Dean takes another pull from the bottle. What made him think he had the fucking right to–
“I can’t keep breaking your heart.”
The café is empty except for them, and Cas’s hands feel warm and firm on his upper arms, far warmer than the blanket.
“I had to see for myself,” Talbot says again. “I know you think there isn’t a lot to you,” he continues, with no regard for the bile rising in Dean’s throat. “But you’re wrong. You deserve that money for the work you’re doing here. It’s yours. I’m not taking it back. And I’ll always have work for you, if you want to do something else.”
Okay.)
“Car first,” Cas says, smiling.
Sam starts laughing, and then Dean starts laughing too.
When he found out, he hadn’t said a word. He had been silent all the way back from the hospital, and he didn’t stop at the house. He had driven straight to Singer and Sons and got out of the car. Cas followed him. Having nothing to say, it was the only thing to do. Just walk after him, watch his jerky movements, wait, think.
He flipped to the next card.
–––––
“I guess we were,” Dean says, “but, you know. Not like it could become anything.”
"Wow, okay, never mind, just trying to make small talk." He raised his hands a little and backed off, sinking further down in his seat. That's what he gets for taking Sam's advice and working on his 'nice'.
"What is this?"
"Yes, I know." the man smiled.
“Thanks, Dean.”
Subject: Hey
A little later, Cas comes and refills his cup again.
It’s not raining, but it isn’t not raining either. The sky is a tense grey, looking as if it has decided to rain but then become so distracted by the sight of a jeans-wearing American walking next to an extremely well-dressed posh British butler-sort that it hadn’t managed to follow through on the action. Dean is annoyed by it. It’s meant to be June, but he’s almost shivering, and his skin feels clammy under his collar.
, Sam, I’m not a monster, could you look Jessica in the eye and say ‘oh, by the way, sometimes I don’t love you’?”
Cas gave him a look of such naked hope that Dean didn't dare regret it. "I'm sorry I scared you." He said.
, Cas, you–“
“That’s gross,” Dean mutters, “you’re so gross.”
When he passes by the kitchen, Talbot pops his head out.
"It's okay, Dean. I'm right here. I'm right here with you. We're going to figure this out. We're going to get you help. I promise."
Talbot lets him go.
“But this is a… This is a Mercedes-Benz 600. Did you know that? This is the Pullman.
They leave around 2am, and walk back to Cas’ apartment. It’s drizzling a little, tiny drops visible falling through the beams of the street lights. Dean is pleasantly drunk, and Cas is leaning against him a little. When he starts laughing, Cas blinks up at him, a question soft and inviting in his eyes.
”Dean, the wedding isn’t over.”
Dean gets up and grabs a bottle off the closest shelf. He doesn’t know what it is. It could be worth thousands, for all he could tell. He uncorks it and takes a long drag, enjoys the way it burns his throat.
He steps away from the door, and goes to the travel agency next door. The man there is confused why he’s asking for help at a travel agency, he can just book things online now, and instead of asking him why he works at a travel agency if it’s so obsolete, Dean stammers out something about not having a computer, and asks him to please just book it for him, thank you. The man does, and Dean pays with his shitty, scratched up American Express and tucks the ticket into his pocket and tells himself he’s doing the right thing.
“I need coffee,” he says.
”The hot best man you’ve been staring at all night, you dingus.” She took some food off his plate. There was a non-edible leaf in there but she didn’t seem to notice. ”Go over there, introduce yourself! He’s probably bi.”
“He didn’t mean to, and I think he felt really bad about it. I’m not trying to throw him under the bus or anything, I just felt shitty knowing and not… saying anything. So. We can pretend this never happened, I won’t bring it up again.”
“It’s a picture of an engagement ring,” Cas says.
“I’ll… I’ll speed things along. And Cas, you’ll tell me if it’s too much, won’t you?”
In the rearview mirror, Dean sees that John is furious, but he doesn’t try to argue again. Part of him is impressed. He could never shut John up like that. Then again, Sam always stood up to him, he was never scared of him.
“I will leave this here.”
Eames hands him the cup.
Dean picks up Cas and two travel mugs of coffee from the sidewalk in front of Taste Buds at noon the next day. He’s wearing a colourful raincoat and his hair is standing in all directions.
“I will make sure.”
“What–”
“Hey, Cas. Sorry, is this a bad time?”
She’s unperturbed. “It will of course work perfectly well as an office, or a guest room. The previous renter used it as an art room, there is some lovely light in there. In the whole house really, the kitchen was remodelled–“
The corridors look different at night. He has to feel himself forward with a hand against a wall, and the floorboards creak loudly under him. The staircase seems longer, the ceilings higher.
This is still Cas. This is Cas and he’s been strong and he’s been harsh and he’s tried to be ruthless and he’s seen where it leads and he wants this for Dean– wants something soft. Wants something kind.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut and holds onto Cas until he feels like a person again, a person and not just a body overflowing with joy and fear in equal measure.
“Okay, baby girl,” he says softly, breaking the silence, “let’s get you up and running again.”
“If you’ll follow me, Mr. Winchester.”
Dean stopped rubbing his head and stood up. "Yes, hello, sorry about that, didn't hear your car." He took a rag from his pocket and started wiping his hands, "welcome to Singer and sons, how may I help you today?" He flashed a smile.
When Dean pulls Cas into his mouth, his hand clenches in Dean’s, but the other one strokes his cheek, his hairline, his neck. Cas is saying things, but Dean can’t hear them. He doesn’t need to, he just needs Cas’ voice, landing like a blanket over him, starting to fill up all these new, empty places in him.
“Sam,” Dean interrupts, rubbing his face with his free hand, “it’s the Impala, alright?”
Eames doesn’t elaborate. When they turn off the M25 and onto winding countryside roads, when the roar of traffic fades away and all he can hear is the hum of the engine, he closes his eyes for a moment and wonders when the last time it was that he went driving, just for the hell of it. Just for the feeling of it. He can’t remember.
Dean’s hand spasmed in his.
"Dean. Dean, calm down. You need to calm down or you're going to hurt yourself. Sam is here, he's just getting coffee, he will be
