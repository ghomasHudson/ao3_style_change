“No,” she called back.  “Just sittin' here.  Enjoying the view.”
Steve nodded.  “He loves you,” he said, and Shuri made a face.  Steve smiled.  “Know who he would blame if something were to happen to you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you for helping,” Steve told him, pushing DJ’s hair back.  “Did you have fun shopping with Jarvis and Mrs. Parker?”  DJ nodded with a great deal of enthusiasm.  “Did you and Peter pick out presents for everyone?  All the boys from Hammer’s place?”
“You don’t know,” Rhodey said.  He pushed the croissant aside and reached for his coffee cup, then slumped back into his seat.  “Steve.  All of his ink, every piece of it, they’re all people.”
He reached for the hat that was hanging on the back of his chair.  “The King’s Ball is in just over two month’s time,” he said. “Which is, of course, why the Wakandan delegation is entering the city.  They won’t be the only ones.  By that point, I will be expected to name an heir.”  He looked at Steve.  “Things’ll be coming to a head, very soon.”
“True enough.  And how did you come to be here, my cursed child?” Agatha asked.  She took her nametag from Clint.  ‘Ask me about my gingerbread house.’  She shook her head.  “You have Frigga to thank for your continued health and wellbeing, you know that, do you not?”
“We don’t have anything,” Tony said, because there was zero chance that this was going to go his way. “I have a meeting.”
The commercial sign flashed, and Morrison surged to his feet. “Well, that was quite a piece of grandstanding,” he gritted out, and Steve smiled at him.
-Seven years later-
"It was this or try to squeeze through the window on the bathroom."  Tony leaned to the side, giving Steve a wicked look around the edge of the menu.  "And I wasn't sure that it was the men's room."
Stark was wearing some sort of silk dressing gown, tied loosely at his waist, the hem fluttering around his thighs as he walked.  His legs were bare beneath the edge of the robe, and Steve felt his face heat.  Before he could turn away, Stark caught his eye.  “Are you not coming in?”
Steve shook his head  “Nothing.  I just-” He managed a smile.  “It was just nice.  The sandwich offer, I mean.”  He looked back at the webpage.  “Can I have a ham and cheese?”
"You're on my couch."
Behind him, Steve, Sam and Peter were doing their best to follow Luke as he moved smoothly through the steps, his thumbs hooked in the belt of his pants.  He was leaning so far back that he seemed to be prepping for a limbo contest, rather than a country line dance.  Jess was lipsyncing along to the song, with Carol, Clint and Thor acting as backup singers, their hips swaying and their heads bobbing along to the beat.
The spike of nausea caught him off guard, so sudden and so complete that it left him reeling.  He reached for his coffee cup, and had to ignore the way his fingers were trembling.  “You’re here,” he said, his voice hard, “because I needed a housekeeper, and your aunt is a damn good one.  You were just part of a package deal, and at the time when I hired her, you were small and quiet and I assumed that she would be putting you in an empty closet or shed of some sort.”
“I know,”  Her fingers flexed at her sides, locking into fists for a moment.  “I-  I know.”  She looked up at him, her sharp little chin raised high. “Would I be asking if I had any other choice?”
The woman blinked at him.  “English?” she asked, her brow furrowing.
“Uh-huh.” Steve slammed the last cabinet door.  “Because you missed me, or because I have a slim chance of controlling your boss?”
“Conspiracies everywhere,” Tony said, as Clint walked past, Darcy adjusting the ribbons of his flower crown in his wake.  It was red and yellow with silver ribbons, a perfect match for the tacky Iron Man Halloween costume.  “I’m going to have to file a cease-and-desist here.”
Tony stepped aside, letting them pass.  He was pretty sure they left glitter in their wake. “No,” he said.
“Look, I’m busy here,” Nebula said.  “And while I appreciate the rather obscene tip you gave me last night, Tony, I’m not doing any more work on you until that heals up, so you can call us in a week or so and make another appointment if you-”
“Sorry, Cap,” Tony said, and he was, he was sorry.  Sorry that people were horrible, mostly, but also sorry he'd gotten Steve into this.  “But they're going to do that.  They're going to do it a lot now.”
DJ bounced up, throwing himself into Steve’s arms.  Steve scooped him up, hugging him close.  His face was tight, his eyes squeezed shut.  “Thank you.”
“There’s a lot of you, perhaps you missed a spot,” Tony said.  Steve gave him a look. “Fine.  Well, then, you can sit there for a moment and…” He waved a hand at the bathtub.  “Just relax.”
“There’s been some trouble.”  Steve dug his fork into the bowl.  He’d never seen a dish quite like it, but the memory of an empty belly was a constant companion, and he’d never been a picky eater.  The rice was spicy and sweet, all at once, an unfamiliar tang that bit against his tongue and the back of his throat.  But rice mellowed it, and the thick rounds of sausage were delicious.  He dug in, taking another few bites before he looked up again.  “It’s steady work.  Which is hard to find these days.”
"I told you specifying a location would make a mess of it," Tony said.  "You should've just gone with 'surprise marriage.'"
Happy leaned on the steering wheel while the gates were pulled open.  Beyond it, there was half a dozen men, big men with broad shoulders and stiff faces.  “Mr. Stane’s over ruled the boss.  He’s pulled a bunch of the guards off the factories, sent ‘em here.”
Either they didn't understand English or they were pretending they didn't so they could avoid talking to him.  It wouldn't be the first time.  But as they ducked past a display made to look like the bow of the Titanic and ran across the floor of a New York disco, circa 1975, he found himself laughing.  “I don't know where we're going, but can we go back to the Titanic, because that, that was amazing, seriously, I don't even know what's happening here, but that was an amazing work of engineering considering that it's plywood and canvas and a lot of duct tape, so-”
“Also me,” Steve admitted.  He gave Jan a wry smile. “A lot of that is me.”
DJ blinked at him, then looked down at the cup of soup he was clutching between his hands.  “Oh.  No.”  He set the cup back down and gave them an attempt at a smile.  “No.  I’m…  Not hungry.”
He leaned back, crossing his arms over his chest and keeping a wary eye on her.  "Yes, you have.  Haven't you?”  He paused, his eyes narrowing.  “I could have sworn that you-"
Mrs. Parker chuckled, an impish gleam in her eye.  “I can’t imagine what you’re talking about,” she said, wiping the blade of her knife on the tea towel.  “Straight from Paris, that one.”
“If that means you'll leave?” Tony said, giving him a vicious smile.  “Yes.  I am.  Get out.  And if you have any problems with the situation, you can take them up with Fury.  But unless he comes down here to reinforce the status quo?”  Tony leaned in.  “I'm in charge.”
Tony let out a whoop, a sound of pure joy bursting out of him, and Steve was laughing, high and bright and warm in his ears.  They shot between the buildings, the motor roaring as they cut through the parking lots, one after another, accelerating as Steve found one narrow gap after another.  Tony found himself grinning, his arms wrapped tight around Steve's waist, his body moving easily with Steve's on each turn.
“My orders,” Steve said, staring straight ahead.
Nat buried her face in his shoulder.  “You’re an idiot, you really, really are.”
"He tried."
“You planning on helping?” she asked, and Tony grinned.
The usher threw the door open ahead of him, and Tony shot through it, blinking at the bright lights of the foyer.  “I need somewhere quiet,” he said, his words brisk.  “And private.”
His eyes closed, and he took a deep breath.  “It’s-”  A spark flicked around his fingertips, a crackle of something almost like static electricity.  “Lock.  It’s a lock.”
There was a beat of silence, then Jan yelled from across the room, “COME OVER HERE AND GET YOUR JUST DESSERTS,” and Steve gave up.
“Where he lives,” Tony repeated.  “Get his address.”
DJ blinked at him.  “Monkey bread?”
Allison blinked.  “Was that…” Her eyes darted towards Tony.  “Was that a prepared speech?”
Steve stood up.  “You can’t send me back.  At least, not right now.”
He looked at Steve, something haunted in his eyes.  “Manageable.”  He took a deep breath.  “But this.  Doesn’t help.”  He blinked, once, twice, his head twitching to the side, his head falling forward as he rubbed the back of his neck.  “He needs you.”
He walked along the table, pausing next to Tony’s chair.  He held out his plate, and when Tony reached for it, Ty met his eyes with a smile and let the thin porcelain slip from between his fingers.  It tumbled to the floor and shattered with a crash.
“At least one foot,” Greer said, and Steve didn’t want to think about that.
“I’m not hungover!” Tony called.
“Right.  Do we have plans for either of our captives?” Clint asked, his arms crossed over his chest.  Natasha gave him a look, and he shrugged.  “Look, I’m fine with hiding a body, but I’d like some time to figure out where we’re dumping it.”
“I'm not,” Peter told DJ with an easy smile.  “But I'm a good climber.”
“Every one,” Tony said, pushing his hair away from his face.  “Just you.  And rooms full of boring numbers.  For the rest of your natural life.”
DJ's eyebrows dipped low.  “You remember,” he said.  “You never forget.  But I didn't...”  He straightened up, his fingers still locked on the fabric of his pants.  “I didn't need you.”
“Well, an army does march on its stomach,” she said, pushing the basket of potatoes across the counter to his seat.  “Put the peels in a pile on the cutting board, Bruce'll want them for the garden.”  She headed back into the pantry, returning with a bin of flour and another in sugar, a tin of baking power balanced on top of the pile.  She set them down beside a mixing bowl and reached for a measuring cup.
“That’s…  Still up in the air,” Bruce said, but he started towards the door, with a slow, plodding tread.  He looked at Steve.  “Can I leave him to you?”
“Don’t worry, I got more,” Bucky said, and Steve sighed.
“You look like you could use a hand.”
“We’re babysitting, so obviously.”
There was a second of pause, and then Greer emerged from under the table, her eyes squeezed into narrow slits.  She blinked at Bruce, then reached up and pushed her hair out of her face.  “Where am I?” she asked, her voice gritty.
He rotated one shoulder, almost a shrug.  “Better than he should be, even coming off the front lines of France and Germany.  More of a concern, he’s faster than he should be, and he knows he’s being watched.”
Tony nodded. "Pizza pie fight."
Steve took a deep breath. “I’ll keep that in mind.”
“Right,” May said, turning off her jam.  “Peter.  Bed.  Now.  I will not say it again.”
But God, things were easier when Tony was there.  It was enough, when Tony was there.  Steve could deal.  As long as Tony was there.
There was a moment of silence, then the rustle of fabric as Tony lifted the sheets.  “Well, this is going to look good when we try to leave,” he said, his voice resigned.
“He’s actually not,” Tony said, but Obie didn’t seem to hear him.
“Yes, yes, fine, Obie.”  He rolled to his feet, and held out a hand to DJ.  “Welcome to the Stark Mansion, young man,” he said, and DJ gave his hand a firm shake.
But the slow, steady weight of his gaze was his own.  The way he moved, awkward and sometimes too quick for his own good.  His careful,economical use of words.  The way he saw things, the way he listened, his gentle, bright spirit, his natural wonder, that was DJ.  That was only and always DJ.
“It's like they know me,” Tony said.  “How're the fansites handling it?”
Steve folded his arms on the edge of the counter, leaning into them.  “Spicy waffle fries, tossed with taco seasoning, then broiled under a blanket of cheese before being topped with jalapenos, sour cream and pork carnitas.”
“No,” Steve said.  He looked at Tony, who hadn’t moved.  “No.  My captain-”  He stopped, a bitter smile crossing his face.  “My captain’s been spending freely over the last few weeks, both on himself, and his friends.  Started attending the station’s weekly poker game again, and he’s been racking up some impressive losses without complaint.”
Steve nodded.  “Why?”
Steve’s whole body tensed.  “Stane?”
“I’m just, I’m more comfortable like this,” Peter said, and DJ, freed, dragged a book across the workbench and went back to reading it.   “I’ll just…  Earmuffs.”
“I don't think we're quite friends, Mr. Stark.”
Tony was chatting with Rhodey when he reached their table.  Tony glanced up at him.  “You okay?” he asked.  “I was about to ask Jarvis if you'd fled the building.”
Steve drained his punch.  “I need a drink.”
“Good I ask now, so I can save room.”  Pepper stacked up a pile of paperwork with a brisk motion.  “DJ, want to come with me?  We can get washed up for dinner.”
Steve wished that was the case.  “We’ll see you after the film.”
He thought about that, his eyebrows arching.  “Nope,” he said at last.
“Stay still.”  Pepper’s voice.  He reached out, and her hand was there, her fingers wrapping around his, holding tight.  “You’re in the infirmary.  Bruce, can you-”
He held up his half-eaten sandwich like he was proposing a toast.  “You’re all insane,” he said.  “And you can stay here, being insane, and have a normal lunch.  Because nothing.  At all.  Will happen.”
Steve paused, his coffee cup hanging motionless in the air.  “Why?” he asked at last.
“Yeah, well, you’re a goddamn coward and left me to deal with that alone, so you lost your vote,” Tony said, pulling a lead lined containment unit out of the storage.  He heaved it up onto the workbench.  “As it turns out that was the worst conversation I’ve had since the last one where my child disappeared to another dimension, so I should’ve left with you.”
Next to him, Pepper was laughing.  “You don't have to sound quite so morose about that,” she pointed out.
“Excuse me?” Tony gestured up towards the second floor landing, where Rogers had just disappeared.  “I wasn't-”
That won him a small smile.  DJ sank down onto the couch next to his bed, pushing a few pillows out of his way so he could tuck his legs up next to him.  “Bunk beds?”
“Sometimes your Auntie wants Olive Garden.” Rhodey’s voice echoed up from behind Tony.  A moment later, his hand waved into the view.  “And you love your Auntie, so you’re gonna go eat goddamn breadsticks.”
“It is,” DJ said, with a slight nod.  He blinked at Tony, his face utterly serious.  “It is.”
"I will have you murdered," Tony said, holding the coffee cup up like a ward between them.  "Don't you-"
“Doesn't that no matter what I say, you get to decide what it means?” Tony asked.
“Oh, I don’t either, but Mrs. Parker plays a mean rag on the piano.”  Bobbi dropped the music back into the folder. “But still.  I managed to track down a few incidents that I’m fairly certain happened, at least to some extent.”  She spread the pages out.  “An Italian grocer who refused to pay the protection money that la Cosa Nostra demanded of him.  Rumor has it that the four men who came to firebomb his storefront met...  Unusual resistance.  No one’s bothered him since.”
“Sir,” Jarvis said, bringing Tony's head around. “You have a visitor.  Ms. Van Dyne is on her way up, and has inquired if you are decent.”
“No, he wouldn’t,” DJ said around the spoon, and Steve choked on a laugh.
Natasha arched an eyebrow.  “I’m going to have to cast my vote with the Council of Lesbians,” she said.
Mickey snorted.  “Ain’t that the truth.  I do my best, and my ma takes what she can find, but it ain’t much these days.”  He shoveled another heaping spoonful of rice into his mouth.  “I keep a roof over our heads, but sometimes, it don’t stretch as far as it could, you know?”
“What?”
“Jarvis, I thought we discussed this,” he said, as Steve’s weight shifted off of him.  He let out a hiss of displeasure, and Steve dipped back down, brushing a gentle kiss against Tony’s lips before pulling away completely.  Tony stayed just where he was, flopped against the carpet, staring blankly at the ceiling.  “I thought we were in agreement.”
“Wait, are we talking about Sam’s potato nachos?  The spicy waffle fries, topped with cheese, sour cream, salsa, jalapenos, barbacoa pulled pork and refried beans?” Bucky asked.
"You can't just list the whole team," Tony said.  "That's-  No, Steve."
Val's fingers stroked through her hair, the movement slow and idle.  And then she started to braid again.  “You don't tell because he'd feel guilty for losing you,” she said, and DJ's heart skipped a beat.  His eyes jerked up to meet hers, and Val twisted the braid around her palm.  “He doesn't know you remember, does he?”
Jarvis smiled.  “Thank you, Miss Potts.”  To Tony, he added, “Sir, if you might come with me, please?”
“And I'm sure such people will see that regard in their upcoming bonus checks,” Pepper said.
“Watch it, buster,” Sue said.  She smiled.  “You have a child.”
"The jewel encrusted cod piece," Tony filled in for him, because that piece of the wardrobe was so bizarre as to require comment.
He landed on his feet, and he wasn’t at all sure how, but he also wasn’t about to question his luck.  Jerking back upright, ignoring the way his heart was lodged in his throat, he managed a grin up the stairs.  “Think you can outmaneuver me in my own house?” he crowed.  “Think-”
Tony banked hard left, slipping in the narrow gap between two buildings.  "You know, I know you're kidding, but I think, for the record, it's good for me to state that no.  No, that is definitely not one of mine."
He paused, his hand hanging in mid air.  He tried to exhale, and it came out as a bark of laughter, sharp and hard.  “Lady, you have no idea what I’m afraid of.”
Her shoulders flexed in something approaching a shrug.  “I was smart, useful and I kept my mouth shut.  He didn’t have any further interest in me.”
Tony grabbed him before the shock could wear off, wrapping the towel around DJ and sweeping him off of his feet.  “Gotcha,” he said, heaving DJ into his arms.  For a moment, he found himself holding a struggling, twisting mass of cloth.  Grinning, he flipped the corner of the towel back.  DJ blinked up at him, his face flushed and his eyes bright.
“Are we sure about that?” Clint asked, his head falling back.  “Really?”
“And now it’s a topic of conversation again,” she said, collecting the empty cups and plates from the desk and piling them up on a tray balanced on her hip.  “And it’s your fault.”
“I mean, it’s still an option that’s on the table,” Trip told him as the boy looked over the packages.  She wiggled her eyebrows.  “I look damn fine in a pompadour.”
"I'll have another coffee," Tony said, frowning down at the plans in front of him.
“Which is everyone,” Ellen said.  She leafed through the photos.  She'd seen most of them before, but a few were unfamiliar.  She fished them out, laying them out on the desktop.  “I think Instagram just assumes that everyone who opens up an account wants to follow VanDyne.”
In the silence that followed, Tony reached for the shampoo bottle.  “Are you okay?” Rhodey asked at last.
One glance was all he really needed.
“I can’t believe I missed the bar fight,” Carol said, staring morosely at the ceiling.  “I can’t…” She shook her head.  “It’s just not fair.”
The liquid was pale and golden and hollow down to the depths, far, far deeper than the cup that held it, so deep that he couldn’t see the bottom, so deep that he didn’t even know if there WAS a bottom.  It never stopped, it never got darker, it just went on, forever.
“Office.”
Tony glared at him.  “You,” he said, stabbing a pen in Peter’s direction, “are absolutely going to college.  I didn’t force march you into two separate prep schools so you could give up and go be lazy just when it comes time for you to finish your training and start taking over the boring, mundane tasks that I do not want to do.”
Bobbi leaned over to take it.  Tony sat back in his seat.  “Actually, Peter and DJ need adult supervision.  And you're available.”
“Less talking, boy, and far more petting,” Agatha said into her tea cup, and Harris reached out, his movements slow and cautious.  .
“Just give up and grab a roll of paper towels.  If the holidays are about anything, they’re about giving up and accepting your family can’t be trusted with your carpets,” Tony said.  He held out a hand.  “Give me the cups.”
“Since I’m not budging on this, and you can’t make me, I’m fairly certain that it is,” Tony said.  He stood. “But if it makes you feel better, I’ll pretend to consider your position of the matter.”
“You’re next no matter what we go by, but first name,” Tony said.  “Less talking, more ripping.”
“I cannot imagine that’s the case, sir.” Jarvis picked up the pencils DJ had been using, setting them in their box.  Someone had written DJ’s name on it.  Tony considered the handwriting.  It looked rather like his.
Sam's eyebrows shot up.  "Right.  And who's going to teach him?  Natasha's a terrifying Russian ballerina, and you're about three feet tall in heels."
“He's still out there,” Natasha told him.  “Going over the grounds with a fine tooth comb.”
In the dim light of the bedroom, he realized that Tony was stumbling, his hands gripping the railing of the loft, towards the stairs.  “Hey!” He flung himself out of bed, nearly ending up on his face as his feet tangled in blankets.  “Tony!  No, no, no-”
Slowly, Obie straightened up.  “If they’re really his parents, you can’t deny them,” he said.  There was a note in his voice that Tony couldn’t quite quantify.  He was surprised to discover that he really didn’t care.  “Tony.  You can’t just-”
"No one invited you," Jan said.  She lifted her foot off of Steve's spine, and Steve flopped onto his back in relief.  Jan didn't seem to notice.  She put her hands on her hips.  "Natasha's getting the equipment, and then we can start.  You-"  She made a shooing motion with one hand.  "Go."
No.  Yes.  He wasn’t sure.  He didn’t know if he could.  He didn’t know if he wanted to.  But his father sat there, chewing, his eyes level, waiting.  Waiting for DJ to make up his mind.  Waiting for him to decide
“I suspect that’s closer to the truth than you’d like, Lieutenant.”
Nine and a half minutes later, he stepped off the elevator into the lobby, knotting the scarf around his neck as he walked.  He waved at the security guards.  “How's things out there?” he called.
The line connected with a click, and there was a second of silence.  Then, “Hi, uh, Tony Stark’s phone?”
Shuri opened her eyes as wide as possible and plastered a smile on her face.  “I love your dress!  Who is your family forcing you to marry?”
“Us?” Hank said, his head coming up.  “How is this an ‘us,’ Tony?”
"I also know," Sam said, giving him a flat look, "that I did what needed to be done today, instead of what I wanted to do, and I was able to do that, because I knew that you-" He flicked a finger in Tony's direction.  "Were here.  With him."  He settled back in the chair, his head tipped slightly to the side, his dark eyes steady.  "I trusted that you could handle this."
Isaiah gave Steve a look of such triumph that it was all that Tony could do to keep from laughing.  “I'll check my calendar,” Isaiah said.  “And get back to you.”
“I’m okay,” Harris said, folding his arms on the table.  He looked at DJ, who was staring out the windows at the city skyline, his face unreadable.  “I’ll call if anything comes up?”
Steve’s hands slid down his back, his broad hands cupping Tony’s ass.  “Better?” he whispered against Tony’s skin.
“And it's a damn THING,” Steve said, frustration twisting through him.  “And in six months, I won't be, and it's-”  His shoulders slumped.  “It's what I wanted, and it's all wrong, all at the same time.”
But he took a step to the side, and spotted DJ, curled up on his side, hidden behind the arm of the sofa.  His eyes and nose were red, and he stared, unblinking, at the fountain.  Tony paused, one hand braced above his head on the curve of the staircase.  “Diagnostic,” he said, his voice soft.
“I mean, at least not without having to try to sneak in through a back door, or past an usher,” Steve pointed out.  “Knowing some of them, I’m sure they’ve made a try or two, but might be nice for them to see one without having to worry about being carried out by their ear.”
“Yes,” Steve said.
Hammer was sitting at his desk, his spectacles crooked on his nose, a large, mostly empty bottle of brandy clutched in one hand, a glass in the other.  He barely flinched as Steve stepped into his office, his red rimmed eyes flicking up towards him, then back down to his drink.  “You here to arrest me?” he asked, his voice vibrating on the words.  “Or kill me?”
“Yeah, but most of them are beneficial,” Clint pointed out.  He folded his arms on the wall, leaning into them.  “And most of them, we don't want the police involved.”
Tony's hands were in fists at his sides.  “He needed you.”
“That's one way of putting it.  Are you up?”
A couple of things!
“It’s hard to get your balance, let me-”
“When do I not?” she shot back, her head jerking towards the door.  “Go.  If you manage to get up there before the main course, you might get by without much comment.”
Tony looked at Bruce, and Bruce shrugged.  “Yeah, Jarvis handles-”
He had to leave eventually.  It might as well be now.
Harris sucked in a breath, which helped the light-headedness a lot.  “Right.  But there is a Tony Stark.  That we have to claim.  As ours.”
“We ask that you attempt non-lethal methods before going straight to weaponry,” Phil said.
DJ looked down at his bare feet, and wiggled his toes.  He looked back up. "No," he said, and it was so obviously a lie that Pepper had to struggle not to laugh.
Steve grinned at him.  “If I give this to you, what're the chances that you'll actually manage to drink it without spilling it everywhere?”
“No, I didn’t,” Shawn admitted.
“Can't.  Dead,” Tony mumbled into his pillow.
“Just curious about your choice of words,” Steve said.
“So, something's going to end up on fire,” Bobbi mused.
“Too late!” Tony said, because everyone was filing out, one after another, with varying degrees of speed.  Bruce was the last one to slip through the door.
“Yeah, I asked him.”  Rhodey stared at him, pained.  Tony raised one shoulder in a half shrug.  “Seemed like a good idea at the time?”
“No, you won’t,” Tony said, catching Jan by the shoulders and turning her to face him. “Hey.”  He gave her a slight shake, and her head bounced up, her eyes catching his, and he smiled.  “I told you what happened, and now you’ve stressed Cap out-”
“Cute you think that I’ll be getting in your car,” Iron Man said.
To Bruce, Tony said, “Stay with May and Peter, just-” He shook his head.  “If he needs a hospital-”
“Maybe never.”  Tony took a deep breath, looking around for more pieces.  “I haven’t decided yet.”
“And either they’ve got someone else to open the gate, or they never needed anyone to open the gate.  All he knows is that he’s at the literal scene of the crime, and if anyone sees him coming or going from that spot, he’ll be caught red handed.  So now he’s got two choices.  Cut his losses and go help put out the fire he started and hope that doesn’t come back on him, or to see if whoever he was supposed to let into the grounds is still here.”
“I tried. It's going directly to voice mail,” Marcy said. “I notified SHIELD, Coulson's reporting the same thing. You could try, but-”
"I'm not going far," Tony said, but he wove his fingers through Steve's, his grip firm and strong.  "Try to keep up, old man."
Tony stared at him.  “My car's-”
Steve took a breath, and then another.  He looked up.  “Because I’ll find another way back.”  He smiled, and it felt it in his teeth.  “And it might be even stupider.”
Steve lifted his arm just far enough to aim a look in Tony's direction.  “When it's a gun, I usually get to have the shield,” he said, his voice dire.  “And I'd really like to stop discussing this now.”
"No, you may not," Stark said, waving a hand through the air.  "But you're going to."
Steve's eyes rolled up towards the sky.  “We're going to make it go away, okay?” he said, his lips twitching.  “We'll get a nice-”
Steve glared at him with one eye.  “Of course there is,” he said, knowing it would make Tony laugh.  When Tony poured more water over his head, washing the soap away, he let his eyes close, savoring the small comfort of Tony’s touch.
Steve let himself smile, just a little.  “Would I do something like that?” he asked, his voice mild.
He crossed to the sink, turning the tap on and rinsing the bowl.  Miss Potts broke the silence.  “Officer?”  He turned, and she was right behind him, her hand extended.  “My friends call me Pepper.”
“They planned that we'd destroy their toy?” Thor asked with a scowl.
Her mouth opened.  Closed.  “That's... Probably true,” she admitted.
“If I split it with her, I might just be able to,” Harris said.  He straightened his jacket with a twitch of his hands.  “Right.  I’ll be back.”
“You're TWELVE, which is not a teen, it's a pre-teen,” Val said with a smirk, her foot hitting once, twice, a third time in rapid succession, faster and faster, “and you're covered in Pringle crumbs and floor dirt, so I'm not sure you're ready to be an adult.”
“I think it best if it were Clint alone,” Jarvis said, and Phil subsided back against the pillows.
"A pie fight," Steve echoed.
Steve grinned down his own reflection in the gleaming countertop.  “Uh-huh,” he said, wringing out the rag.  “I take it someone tried to find a place to take DJ for dinner when he’s in town.”
Steve’s eyes flicked towards Tony, who crossed his arms over his chest.  “She wants to see if she can drive Obie to a heart attack by announcing our engagement,” he explained.
“Thank you,” Steve said, smiling down at his keyboard.
“Only the mildest of solutions,” Tony told him.  “Barely corrosive.”
Steve dragged one leg up, bracing his arm on his knee.  "I don't know," he admitted.  DJ's face fell, and Steve smiled, just a little.  "Well, it's your story.  How do you think it ends?"
“I understand broken plates,” Peter said, his sweeping almost melancholy.  “I have a sympathy for broken plates.” He paused, his hands stacked on the top of the broom.  “They are my only friends.”
Her eyes flicked in his direction. “Just a little?”
"We just saved the world, like, twice last month,” Tony said, flapping a hand in the general direction of the world outside the windows.  “The-  The entire world!”
"And that means this is a stupid idea," Tony pointed out.
DJ realized he was laughing.  He reached up, covering Steve’s hands with his.  “Okay,” he said.  “I”m-”  He nodded, as much as Steve’s grip would let him.  “Fine.  I’m fine.”
Tony stared at him.  “No,” he said.
"The employees chose the former.  So everyone took a cut in pay, a cut in hours, but everyone held onto their jobs," Miss Potts said.  Her fingertip tapped against the china, the nail clicking against the side, soft and rhythmic.  "StarkIndustries is still producing, with trained, experienced, loyal employees."
"All of my friends are horrid," Stark said.  "He'd better not be in the workshop, I'll have his-"
“Six THOUSAND,” Steve repeated.  “Six.  Thousand.”
“The world is full of contradictions,” Natasha mused.
Steve pushed himself upright, his breath leaving him in a rush.  Tony was sprawled out next to him, the blankets pulled up almost over his head.  Only the dark tumble of his hair, tangled with dark red rose petals, one perfect cheekbone, and a tawny, golden arm was visible.  His fingers were lax against the pillow, the line of his jaw rough with stubble.
“And that’s when he hit you with his chair,” Peter said.
“I'm fine.”  The words floated out of the kitchen, and Steve sprinted in that direction, the laundry basket tumbling from suddenly numb fingers.
"Yes.  You are.  Good.  For you.  I've heard good things.  That said?  I am not part of this conversation," she said.  "You two better finish this up fast, Natasha lays traps when she's bored."
"Yes, as rational as, you know, bigots can be," Sue agreed.  "But even so.  If they come for her brother, she's going to be involved.  On the off chance that the government doesn't make a target of her, she'll make a target of herself."  This time, her smile was a little deeper, a little more real.  "They're a matched set, those two.  Reed keeps hinting he wants another child, and I've told him, if they outnumber us, we're doomed."
Steve shook his head.  “What’s the difference between believing and knowing?” he asked, for the lack of anything else to say.
When she finally stepped back, she left Sam with an arm full of flowers and a bright smile on his face.  She rocked backwards, her hands behind her back, her head tilted forward.  “Next Friday?  Dinner?”
She whipped out one of the blank certificates, holding it up.  “Still.”  She looked over the top of it.  “If you saw this hanging on the wall of a dentist’s office, you wouldn’t even look twice, would you?”
Tony gave them his best smile and a wave.  “I know we're dressed for a wedding, but a man's got a right to expect a proposal, so-”
“Do you love him?” someone asked, and Steve's heart stopped.
“I’d salute his sacrifice, but…”  Clint shrugged.
“Scare you?” she asked, sounding only mildly curious.
Someone laughed, and Tony wasn't sure who, but it wasn't him.  He gave Steve a look.  "Strip, Rogers," he said, and, grinning, Steve peeled the glove off with one smooth motion.
“Yep,” Steve agreed.
“Tony!”
Bucky tossed the knife in the air, catching it by the hilt.  “Is that supposed to stop me?” he asked.
He straightened his vest with a few quick, efficient movements.  “But in the meantime, Dr. Essex thinks it best for you to work hard, get lots of fresh air, eat carefully, and stay here.  Where you’re safe.”
“I doubt it,” Morse said, her ponytail swinging behind her as she moved.  “After all, I’m pretty sure Tony just unlocked it to throw you off of his trail.”  She grabbed a heavy jug, swinging it up onto the workbench. Steve wasn’t sure if it held whiskey or something a great deal more caustic.  “Didn’t he?”
There was an aching note to Steve's voice, words full of yearning, of memory.  Tony let his eyes slip shut, let the vibration of Steve's voice slide over his skin, into his very bones.
“Clint’s mad at me and your father,” he said, the words careful. He nodded, his jaw going tight.  “Everyone’s a little mad at me and your father.”
Jarvis gave him a warm smile.  “Of course, sir.”
The photographer showed up promptly at nine, escorted be a large, bombastic bald man.  By that time, DJ had been fed, dressed, and fussed over, Mrs. Parker kneeling down in front of him to smooth his hair.  She whispered to him, her words inaudible to the rest of the room, but he giggled, his cheeks pink.
“Well, I was gonna, but then you said please,” Jessica said.  “What're you even doing here, Jan?  You don't live here.”
“Gotta put the car away, and then I’ve got watch,” Happy said.  His smile was tight.  “You aren’t the only one who doesn’t like strangers in our space.”
“What do you think you’re doing?” Tony said, reaching up to give Steve’s shoulder the gentlest of shoves, pleased when Steve caught his wrists, stretching Tony’s arms up over his head, pinning them to the ground.  Tony arched up, pleasure humming through him as Steve leaned over him, his face flushed.
“I wouldn't promise them anything,” Pepper said, her voice a purr.  “You'll get distracted at some point, and then-”  She wiggled her fingers in his direction.
“Did Tony, did your dad find you?” Franklin asked, and DJ nodded.
“Tony.”
“Ask me if I care,” Steve said, as they bypassed the elevators.
“Sleep,” he said, the single word succinct.  “Wake me when we hit New York state.”  He wrenched the door to the bedroom open and stumbled through, only to find the bed was already occupied.
She smiled.  “It took me a moment to realize that he meant Peter.  I didn’t even have a chance to reply.  He looked up at me, and said, ‘It’s not natural for a kid to be that quiet.’”
“Want some?” Al asked. Ellen was pretty sure he hadn't been this animated since the first season finale of Great British Bakeoff. He held up the pot. “Enough for one more.”
DJ nodded.  “Nat’s cooking.”
Tony twisted around as Steve slipped through the crowd, relief washing over his face.  He hopped up onto the stage. “I lost you.”
“I have many secrets and that’s not one of them,” Tony said.  “I’m not sure which one of you is trying harder to kill me, at this point, it seems like it might be-”
Clint rolled to his feet and took the phone out of Tony’s hand in one fluid, easy movement.  “Hi, Pepper,” he said, dancing just out of Tony’s reach.  “Phil’s in Las Vegas on an assignment.  I’m trying to surprise him.”
He shook his head.
"Though your New York is much to my liking as of late," Odinson said, and before Rogers could realize what was happening, Odinson had grabbed his hand, his grip strong and solid without being painful.  He grinned, his face open and full of warmth.  "How do you do, my friend?"
And God help him, right now, he had no idea which this was.
"Ms. Ning?"
“Darling, I would never!” Tossing her head, Jan headed for the door.  “DJ, if you ever want to be a model, you come and see me.  I bet you photograph like an absolute dream.”
Tony nodded.  “No.  We don't.”  The strands of Steve's hair slipped between the rough pads of his fingertips. “You're one of a kind, Rogers.  And you hold your secrets pretty well.”
“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Tony said.  He surged to his feet, ripping the sheet free of the pad of paper.  “Rhodey.”
“It’s my middle name,” Tony agreed.
DJ looked at Steve.  "Pizza?" he asked, proving that he had the Stark family ability to ignore anything that he wasn't interested in.
“And while they were arguing about this, someone turned it on,” Carol said.  “It wasn’t me.”
Outside, the sidewalks were swarming with people, parents making sure that their children were bundled up against the cold, adults buttoning their coats and tugging on gloves.  Light spilling from the lobby doors spilled out into the city streets, lit by the lamp posts and the cars speeding by.  Despite the hour, it was busy, full of light and noise and people, the way only New York seemed to be.
He'd pushed his luck enough for one day.
"Thank you, we appreciate your understanding," Steve said in that bright voice that he used when he was really hoping no one noticed how many things in the general vicinity were on fire.  For some reason, it almost always worked.
Duck shut the door, his hand braced on the knob. “Ellen, I think you know Captain Steve Rogers. Captain Rogers? Ellen Ning.” He headed to his desk, his tread heavy. “Seems Captain Rogers thought it was the time of you met, Ning.” He dropped into his chair. “And so he came to visit us.”
They disappeared, and the other Doctor Strange followed in their wake, his cape flapping in a wind that seemed to affect only him.  For an instant, the doors stood open, shuddering  under the pressure of the light of he portal.
Laughing, Steve let him take the book, reaching out to steal his water cup back. “Okay,” he agreed, settling back against the pillows.  “I expect you do to the voices, though.”
“Very polite of you,” Natasha said.  “Bobbi?”
Tony nodded. “Right.” His eyes falling shut. “Later.”
“So someone goes over,” Tony said.  Another shrug.  “You do.”  His jaw tight, he added, “Sam does.”
“Dinner'll be in forty-five minutes, so lay off the snackage,” Tony said.  He crossed the room, giving a ball an idle kick as he passed, and lifting a stack of books off of a stool so he could sit down.  He folded his arms on the edge of DJ's workbench. “Richards-Storm spawn, your mom says you can stay for dinner, if you want to.”
Bucky snickered, and Sam stood up with a sigh, moving to sit next to Steve.  Grinning, Steve moved over to let him take a seat on the rock.
"I take it Reed's not handling it well."  Steve headed towards the elevator, Sue keeping step with him the whole way.
“Jess,” Greer said with a grin, and Steve nodded.
“I can make it work,” Steve said, and it was ridiculous, it was impossible, but his voice was hard and determined and Tony found himself believing he could.
The words were bitten off with cold intent, his teeth snapping against each other with each syllable.  Clea paused, her hands still holding the armor captive in midair.  Her head tipped to the side.  “On the floor?” she asked, and Tony lost it.
“What?” Tony asked him.  DJ bounced in place, and Tony bit back a grin.  “What, I don’t know-”
Darcy stared at him.  “Well, that’s a choice you’ve made there,” she said, as every single person at all the tables around them stood as one and collected their trays.
Stark smiled.  “Thanks.  For taking care of my kid.”  He shut the door,  and Tony slumped back in his seat, a hand over his eyes.
Which, he supposed, was no different as to why he’d used it today.  The only difference really was, every other time he’d stepped through a portal, Strange had known he’d been there.
“I’ll need you to book that trip through the app.”
Sam's eyebrows arched, just a slight flicker of movement.  “Ask your boy out?” he said, and just like that, it was fine.  Everything was fine.
Bucky barely waited for him to get out of sight before he nodded.  “Right.  Wait here.”
“But you filled it with tequila,” Tony said.
Tony was breathing hard, his lips swollen, his eyes huge and dark.  “The we’re operating under the same rules?” he asked, and his voice sent a shudder along Steve’s skin.  “As long as the door’s unlocked, nothing’s off limits?”
There was a long moment of silence.  "I'm sorry, what?" Sam asked.
Rhodey smiled.  “During the middle of winter, when the snow’s piling up on the skylights and day lasts about three and a half minutes before it’s dark again?  Let me tell you, during January?” His head tipped back his eyes falling shut. “It’s something else.”
He didn't really need much.  A few hours here and there, and he could survive.  Four or five a night, and he was fully rested.   He almost never got more than six a night, unless he was recovering from an injury.  He didn't need much.
He could feel it again, the way his flesh tore, the way he ceased to exist, in an instant of pain that melted into nothing, that melted into a darkness that would swallow him whole.
“Inarticulate keyboard smashes and there's been a distinct uptick in photo edits,” Jarvis said.  “Your portmanteau is under serious discussion-”
"Wait," Steve said, cutting her off.  "He dated Rhodey?" He stared at her, his mind grinding to a sharp, painful halt.  "When?"
Steve stared back at him, caught by the color of his eyes, a warm, honey-golden brown.  His dark brows arched, an amused smile tipping his lips up, and then he set a hand gently on Steve’s elbow.  “One step to the side, please, and I’ll-”
His voice trailed away, and it was so obviously a lie that it hurt to hear. But Tony knew a thing or two about lies told in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. He wasn't about to call him on it.
“I cannot wait for you to get your comeuppance,” Steve said, reaching for his coffee cup. “I cannot wait.”
Tony pointed at Bruce.  “Can we make that two?”
It was a quick trip down the stairs, both of them moving as quickly as they could while keeping the noise down.  Steve saw a door open on the first floor, but didn’t bother looking back as they passed.  A matter of moments, and they were out of the building, the cold light of dawn hovering just above the skyline.
Jarvis nodded.  “Wonderful.”  He smiled.  “And what would that be?”
“Oh my GOD, how do you tell lies that big with a straight face, Stark, seriously-”
He jerked upright, his heart in his throat.  “One sec,” he called back, turning off the water and heading to the door.  He pulled it open and leaned out.  “Deej?”
He didn’t know this city anymore.  But he remembered it, anyway.
But it was enough for Peter to realize that DJ’s door was ajar.
“Call me if you need me,” he said, his voice quiet.  He glanced back at Steve.  “Either of you.”
Steve tugged him down to sit on his lap.  “Also a surprising amount of sex,” he mumbled into Tony's shoulder, his ears red.
“Oh!”  Steve reached into his pocket, pulling out his watch.  He looked down at it, and then back up at Tony.  “Half past twelve.”
“And we're not counting that out,” Bruce added.  He popped a bit of apple into his mouth.  “I'm telling you now.  If I hear any explosions, uh, I'm heading to bed.”
“Wait, again?”
“If you give that to your horse-” Okoye started, even as the horse reached out, lipping at the fruit.  Okoye’s mouth went thin and flat, and Shuri burst out laughing.
“I’m gonna go,” DJ said.
“Come on,” Sam said, swinging his gym bag to bump hers.  “We can go hide in the gym and actually spar.”
Steve blinked at her, shock washing over him like an icy wave.  “What-”
“Nope.”  DJ turned at held the suitcase out to Rogers.  “You, too.”
“I’m pretty sure Tony would fund it,” Sam asked, and Steve had to slow down, he was laughing so hard  Sam grinned at him.  “Put in a good word for me?”
"God, no, that was VILE," Steve said.  He sounded shocked, and Tony struggled against an entirely inappropriate sense of satisfaction.
“Hi,” he said, holding up his own hand for a high five.  “Hi, Cap.”
“We tease because we love,” Carol said.  “And cause it’s funny. She flipped through the pages in front of her.  “Where is this one from?”
Tony considered Steve with one bloodshot eye.  "This isn't what it looks like," he said.
“Deal.”  Steve leaned in, and Tony saw it coming, plenty of time to move away, to stop him.  Instead, he stood there, his heart stuttering to a halt as Steve brushed a kiss against his cheek.
Everyone looked at each other, and Wanda took her seat.  “He’s asking you to sit.  Down,” she said, the words colored red, and everyone sat.
“What?” Steve asked, but the boy was already heading off to speak to someone else, a basket of masks balanced on his hip.  Steve watched him go, bemused.
Ellen pushed her face deeper into her pillow. "Go away."
Clint was at the stove, an apron tied around his waist, and his sleeves rolled up to his elbows.  The air was heavy was the scent of garlic and onion, and fresh baked bread.  Clint glanced over as Steve walked in.  “Coffee’s on the hob,” he said, snagging a jar of some unidentified spice from a high shelf.  “Mrs. Parker’s made some fresh apple turnovers, they’re in the basket on the sideboard.”
"Didn't you serve in France?" Tony asked.
Despite what Miss Potts had said, the kitchen was well lit, warm and smelling of coffee and yeasty dough.  The counter was spread with stacks of ledgers and files, a tea pot resting beside the largest pile, steam curling from the spout.  Steve glanced around.  "I think you're safe," he said, making Miss Potts laugh.
Tony paused in front of the dining room doors, two massive heavy panels that towered over him, and he hated how those closed doors always made him feel like a child.  A child that was never so sure of his welcome.  He took a deep breath, his hands resting lightly on the handles.  He straightened his shoulders, his chin coming up, and pushed the door open.
Tony nodded.  “Just warning you now.  No C-Span over breakfast.”
“I didn’t,” Shuri said, taking it from Okoye’s hand.  “You did.”  She reached into her boot for her knife.  “We are surrounded by princes, Okoye, and our lives are harder for it.”
Steve shrugged, his hand coming up to cover his pocket.  “It’s been through a lot,” he said.
There was a slight shudder to the ground, the sound of a heavy tread on cracked concrete, and then Hulk loomed over the top of the SHIELD transport, his broad, grim face peering down at them.  “Hey, buddy,” Clint said, even as Gyrich took a single, involuntary step back, his shoulders hitting Coulson's chest.  Clint waved his good hand in the air.  “You throw everything into the harbor?”
Before the words were fully out of his moth, Phil interrupted him, repeating, “Where’s Stark?” his voice tense and crisp.
"Tried," Tony said, as Steve wrestled the passenger side door open.  "You keep coming back.  Like..."  He glared in Peter's general direction.  "Like the cat."
“You're both ungrateful, you know that?” Isaiah asked.
“This isn’t even your dimension,” Clint said, nudging Darcy and Harris into a pew across the way.  Darcy was wearing Harris’ jacket, and Harris had one of her bouquets.
“Because he's going to have to sign the paperwork for DJ,” Tony said, and Steve paused. Tony looked at him, his face unreadable. “Won't he?”
“Yeah, that's where I get confused here,” Sam admitted.  “You skipped a few steps, Steve.”
“Right.”  Bruce adjusted his glasses, leaving a smudge of dirt on one lens.  He didn't seem to notice.  “I'll just-”  He gestured behind him.  “Right.”  Without finishing anything close to a sentence, he headed for what Steve assumed was the servant's stairs.
Steve grinned at the coffee machine, which was halfway through its brewing cycle.   “Could you let Nat and Bruce know that I'm making eggs and bacon?” he asked.  He pulled open the fridge door, peering into the depths.  “See if they're interested.”
“No one believes that, Tone,” Rhodey said.  He hooked a thumb in Steve’s direction.  “Maybe Rogers does, he’s still new.”
Steve looked at her, and then at Tony, and Tony had a strangely…  Sympathetic look on his face.  His heart sinking, Steve looked back to Jan.  “Isn’t…  That a good thing?”
“Boston, maybe.  Or out west.”  Steve’s shoulders felt tight, and he shifted his weight, trying to relax.  “Once we were somewhere new, it’d be easy enough to convince people that he was my half-brother.  You tell people your parents are dead, and most of them don’t ask more questions.”  The wind kicked up, rattling the leaves in the trees, and tugging at Steve’s clothes.  “And chances are, no one would’ve missed either of us.”
“Nonsense, we’ll have this sorted in just a moment.”  Strange smiled at him, his eyes crinkling at the corners.  “And the library has a number of protections on it.  You know that.  You’ll be safe there, I promise.”
“Yes,” Jan said.
God, he was in deep already.
“Tony,” Obie started, just as someone knocked on the door.
“He’ll barely notice,” Jan said.  She wound her arms around Tony’s neck, giving him a very familiar pout.  “I’ll just hide the papers from him for a week and by the time it blows over, he’ll have moved on to another project and won’t even notice the divorce filing.”
Tony focused on setting the chess pieces back on the board, avoiding Obie’s eyes. “I mean, there’s many things I’m not suited to be,” he said.  “Can we narrow it down?”
“Yes, Jarvis,” Tony said, his head tipping upwards.  He stumbled back a step, back thudding against the workbench.  He grabbed for it, his fingers scraping across the smooth surface.  “Who else have you invited to this little party of ours?”
Jan rubbed a hand over her face.  “Yes.  Yes, Steve.  I try not to stereotype, but the idea that you were a lesbian never, ever crossed my mind.”
“Or someone recently started getting lazy,” Ty said.  He gave his wrist a twist, letting the wine in his glass swirl almost to the rim.  “Or wanted to get me in trouble.”
“Yes, sir,” Jarvis said.  “Will you require anything further?”
“I really don’t pay her enough,” Tony mused.
“I’m glad.  But both of us did some pretty stupid stuff, and we made everyone worry, and they’re mad, and that’s something that your dad and I have to work on.”  Steve’s thumb bounced against the steering wheel.  “But no one’s mad at you, Deej.  If you want tacos-”
Tony frowned.  “He was doing that three hours ago.”
“And he was rewarded with kisses for doing such a good job of it,” Jarvis said.
“Yes,” Shiro said, holding up a noodle.  “I noticed.”
Stephen Strange stepped through the glowing portal, his feet floating for an instant in midair before he found the floor, stepping down as easily as if he was descending a staircase.  His cape swirled in his wake, caught in the wake of the portal for an instant, and then swooping forward to tangle around his legs.  He landed, light and easy and confident, and the portal behind him snapped out of existence.
“I think that Rhodes sat at the top of the stairs until morning, with a gun, just in case we went back up.  But he was the first one to come down.” Clint took the lid off of a jar.  “To find I’d made biscuits and sausage gravy, bacon and fried potatoes, a pan of scrambled eggs and a pot of beans.  He stood there, staring at the two of us, because Nat was elbow deep in a pile of bread dough, and I was stirring porridge over at the stove.”
He couldn’t see her face, but he got the feeling she was smiling.  “What do you know,” she said.  “Bobbi works just fine, no matter if people are expecting a man or a woman.  Follow my lead.  That’ll be fine.”
DJ nodded, taking that as given.  “You have expensive things?”
Steve nodded. “Thank you.”
“Can anyone in this place answer a damn simple question?” Steve asked, tossing himself back into his seat at the counter.  “It shouldn’t be so much to ask, so-”
He wrenched the door open. “Darce, what’s-”
Steve sighed. “There's zero chance that I haven't already been exposed, so just-”
Laughing, Tony grabbed hold of the lapels of his sweatshirt, pulling him in.  “In my defense,” he repeated, “most of the messes he cleans up, he made.”
“Excuse me,” Pepper said, on Rhodey's other side, “the promise of pastry is the only thing keeping any of us here.”  She smiled behind the rim of her champagne glass.  “Jan's been talking sweets with us for a week.”
“He’s also not an idiot, Darce,” Clint said.  He grinned up at Tony.  “So.  We negotiating?”
“I suspect it would take a great deal more effort than I’m willing to dedicate to the task,” Agatha admitted.  She went back to her soup.  “And the only one likely to be able to control the situation is our young friend here.”
“No,” Steve repeated.
Sam looked at the box.  Looked at him, his eyebrows arching.  “Has…  Has no one given you a Christmas present before, Tiny Tim?”
Natasha gave Clint a look, and he shrugged.  She turned back to Tony.  “It’s not cover,” she said, one leg swinging slowly back and forth through the air, her skirts swishing with the movement.  “It’s a job application.”
Tony thought about that.  “Ass?” he asked.
Natasha’s lips twitched.  “Right.  We’re going to be just fine.”
Steve took a deep breath. “I know,” he said, his hand lingering for another moment before he settled it back on the steering wheel.  “Instinct.”
Dummy rolled past, a dry erase marker clamped firmly in his claw, and Tony watched him go, a faint smile on his face.  “Make that zero big and bold, buddy.  We want to be able to see it from space.”
“We can split it.”
“No,” he said, his jaw tight.  “You didn’t.  I had a job to do, and I was doing it, you-”
Ellen studied the timeline.  “Stark's never managed to keep a relationship quiet for more than a few weeks,” she said.  She walked to the beginning, tapping each face as she passed.  “Most of them, it was public in a matter of days.”
“If you were sane, you would've called the police after the first one,” Bruce growled against his shoulder.
Tony studied him.  “I never know if it's a good thing or a bad thing when you go all Brooklyn on me,” he said, and Steve's lips twitched.  “What does it even mean?”
“I'm going to take that as a yes,” Tony said.  He leaned back in his chair, waving a hand in the air in a universal gesture of surrender.  “Fine.  It can stay.”  DJ's face lit up, and Tony struggled against a smile.  “What are you going to call it?”
Steve moved his bishop, collecting Tony’s pawn.  “The beds here are horrible,” he grumbled.
Sue weighed her options, sensing the minefield all around her, even if she had no idea where the particular explosives were.  She'd navigated similar fields before, and the easiest way to deal with them was to sidestep them completely.  "It's not just education, Tony," she said, folding her arms over her chest.  "There's socialization."
Harris looked back at DJ.  “We’re going to Vegas.  Want to come?”
Reluctantly, his bones aching with it, he pulled away.  “Jay?  Let’s get to work.”
Bruce paused.  “Point taken,” he said.  He picked up a large box.  “Remember when Sitwell gave him a pack of 500 Pixie Sticks for his birthday?”
Greer pinched the bridge of her nose.  “I like his ass,” she said.  “Can I get a flower arrangement that says ‘I like your ass?’”
“Well, all's well that ends well, gonna go take a shower, and then grab something to-”
He would’ve preferred that to being halfway between universes with no sure way forward.  Or back.
She chewed on the eraser of her pencil, her attention still focused on her calculations.  "Then put them down."  She looked up.  "Marjorie!  What's our stock of black barathea?"
Pepper took the whole platter.  “Right.  They are.”
“Excuse me, I do not,” Steve said.
“What do you think of this font?” she asked.  She held it up in front of her, her big brown eyes peeking over the top.  “It seems very...  Fussy.”
Pepper never looked away.  “He had the right to do it,” she said, her voice quiet.  “Even if you hadn't been missing, he would've had the right.   He did all the negotiations.  And when you were missing-” Her mouth worked for a moment.  “The company was in chaos, Tony.  It was...  It wasn't a good time.  And a large government contract was the best thing he could've announced.  It wasn't a weapons contract, it was for things that were already highly monetized, but no one on the board, none of the analysts were doing anything but cartwheels with joy.  It stabilized the company at a time when we desperately needed it.  When no one was sure what our future was going to be.”
Tony stopped, his head turning to stare down at Peter.  He took a deep breath.  “YES.”
“Right, you’re tough, but if you disappoint the child?” Rhodey smiled at him.  “I’m pretty sure the kitchen staff’s going to hogtie you and shove you in the trunk of the first car they can steal.”
“Good luck with that,” Jess said, grinning.  “Steve, we didn't list 'dance lessons' on the group calendar, that's about as discreet as we're going to get.”  Steve tried to glare at her.  It was harder than it should've been, and she just shrugged.  “We're helping!  Right?”
“We stayed,” she agreed.  “Because one morning, after we’d been here for about, maybe a month?  I went down in the kitchen, in the early hours, to start the bread rising.  It was maybe-”  She shook her head.  “Maybe four am.  I wasn’t expecting company.  But Mr. Stark was there, with a cup of coffee and a stack of papers.”  Slowly, carefully, she began to remove the skin from the apple in her hands, the peel sliding between his fingertips.
There was a beat of silence.  Then, “I'm going to talk you into phone sex one of these days.”
She threw her hands in the air.  “Merry fucking Christmas, everyone out!”
Tony flipped through the book, his fingers stroking over the edges of the pages.  Steve hadn't been its first owner.  There were pale, almost invisible pencil stroked marking passages here and there.  They were hesitant, cautious, as if the person who'd made them had been afraid of getting caught doing it.  A tiny heart, smaller than his pinkie fingernail, had been sketched against one margin, and he smiled down at it.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck.  “You said, 'he's Steve,' and just like that, I was home.”

“Oh, I couldn't, one doesn't call one's betters by their first name, me Ma'd be rolling over in her grave,” Happy declared, and just like that, he was maneuvering Hammer through the crowd with an admirable sort of grace. In a minute, they were absorbed by the crowd and gone.
“I think it’s a bizarre form of penance,” Rhodey said.  He struggled into a sitting position.  “Or maybe-”
But the minutes ticked by, and the grounds remained deserted in all directions.  With one last glance over his shoulder, Steve headed across the lawn to the greenhouse.  Even as he reached for the doorknob, he was still waiting for someone to appear to stop him.
“Right, so-” Steve started, but Jan held up the catalog.
Obie set his glass down.  “You look pale, Anthony.”  His eyes tipped up from under the heavy line of his brows.  “Did you have another attack?”
“What’s there?” Tony asked, but DJ was already moving, ducking through the dwindling crowd.  Harris, caught off guard, scrambled to follow him, almost bumping facefirst into a girl dressed as the white mage from Final Fantasy.
“Every woman in this room had Tony in the poll,” Natasha said, and she seemed to relish saying that aloud.
“No,” DJ said, and Steve laughed.
Steve’s face split in a grin.  “There’s this clinic in Harlem-” he started, and Tony burst out laughing.
Steve grinned.  "We're going to do movie Russian Roulette."
When the kiss finally ended, he pulled back, just far enough to meet Tony’s eyes.  “How does being married feel?” he whispered.
“Yes, we're running it.  Give me the rest of the photos so we've got something for the lawyers to cling to when the libel suits start rolling in.” Duck glared at them.  “Nice knowing you both, ladies, because you realize that if this blows up, it's going to ruin us all?”
“What?”
“The symbol.  On your shield.  That was the mark of the chosen prince.” She rocked forward, her shoulders down, her chin up.  “Where did you get it, boy?”
“We can say whatever we want, ain’t gonna make it so.”  Clint picked up the peel and popped it into his mouth.  “I think there’s some uniting happening downstairs, that’s for sure.
It wasn't ideal, but he'd damn well take it.  “Okay,” he said.  “This...  This isn't so bad.”
Steve wanted to scream, or cry, or both, and he was an adult, he was a grown man, whatever dignity he had left would get him through this.  “You’re so goddamn dismissive,” he said, through gritted teeth.  “So.  Just to be clear.”  He leaned forward.  “Just to be crystal clear.  I have no intention of working for you.”
“As quickly as I can,” Tony said. “Call him back and stall.”
Steve, to his credit, didn’t ask.  “Avenues that can make Stane disappear.”
Phil looked up, catching Clint’s eye.  For a moment, he just stared at him.  The he raised one hand, gesturing at the stack of files.  “That’s because I am,” he said, and went back to his form.
"Nah, but I just got on shift a few minutes ago," he said. "Place is going nuts, but I don't know what's up. Why?"
Peter’s mouth worked.  “I don’t want to handle Miss Potts.”
Steve was laughing, his eyes bright.  “Come on, just for me?”
Steve took it from her, opening it cautiously.  Inside, there were a pair of glasses.  The frames were black on top, the rims bleeding into pale, almost transparent plastic at the bottom.  He turned them over in his hands, confused.  "Glasses?" he asked.
“Also dressing for dinner,” Rogers said, his lips twitching.
“I vote bigots,” Steve said, and he looked a little less like the living dead now.  A little less traumatized.  Tony was glad.
Steve's head came up, and his eyes were wide and unfocused, his cheeks flushed.  “What?” he managed, before he went hard for Tony's mouth, the kiss stealing the breath from both of them.
“The same,” Natasha said, falling into step next to them as they walked up the driveway.  “He says he saw the fire being set, but with what Stane told Tony, I think we can assume he’s lying.”
Steve raised his head, letting Tony bury his face in his shoulder.  “Bucky,” Steve said, smoothing a hand over Tony's head, “go home!”
“Because Miss Potts requested a police guard,” Steve said.
Steve's head fell forward, a curse pushing hard against his gritted teeth.  “Right,” he said.  “Right.  The truck.  Right.  I...”  His voice trailed away.  He didn't know where he was going with this anymore.
Tony considered DJ.  "Depends," he said, his eyes narrowed against the full glare of the late morning light.  "Are you just here to steal my pastries?"
Happy slapped him on the back. “Can this guy hold his beer?”
"You are good like that,” Steve agreed, tossing the rest of the trash.  “You can make it up to me by coming over on Friday morning and help me fix my color problems.”  He grinned at Sam, cheerful about his manipulation.
They walked in companionable silence across the lawn, down to the greenhouse, leaving footsteps in the dew-damp grass.  He finished his scone just as they reached the door.  “Why do I think it’s not going to be locked tonight?” he said, as she reached for the handle.
He was, as always, pleasantly surprised to discover that he was still alive.
“Did you swipe your badge to open the door to that warehouse?” Steve shot back.
The room service waiter smiled, just a little, as he rolled the first of the two oversized food carts into place next to the table.  “I just deliver it, sir, but I wouldn’t be concerned.” He held out an envelope to Tony with one gloved hand.  “Compliments of the house.”
He slid off the bed, and wandered in the direction of his own room, rubbing at his eyes as he went.  Tony followed behind him, his hands still held loosely in his pockets.  “First thing we’re going to do,” he said, “is teach you how to wash your own face, because this seems a less efficient use of my time.”
"You finished destroying that?"
"I hate everyone in this room," Tony said, through clenched teeth.
“You should drink your tea before it gets cold.”
“Enjoy your meeting, Obie,” Tony said.  “I'll be sitting here, thinking very hard on your words.”
His fingers traced over the diagram, smoothing along the thin lines of ink.  “That’s all I need.”
“Want me to take a look?” Obie offered, sipping his whiskey, and Tony gave his head a shake.
“Then I looked up, and Tony Stark was standing there, looking at me like…”  She stopped, shaking her head.  “Like he’d figured something out, but he didn't know what it was.  And without looking away from me, he just said to the desk sergeant, ‘The kid’s mine.  And he’s late for work.’”  She raised her hands, a universal gesture of surrender.  “Then he just turned and left.  By the time the sergeant wrestled me out to the front desk, with me fighting him the whole way, Tony was just calmly counting off bills, and I still don’t know if he was paying my bail or he just thought a bribe involved just…” She shook her head. “Putting down money until someone told him to stop.”
“It might make sense,” Darcy said, shifting her bag from one arm to the other.  “Maybe each universe has a different one?  To keep track of, you know, which universe you’re from?”
“And the con chair of this particular gathering.  So you know me, but I don’t know you.” Agatha stacked her hands on the top of her cane.  “I have come to realize I most likely owe you an apology, young one.” She smiled, and it softened the lines of her face.  “But I need to know what is happening, before I know just how large of one.”
“No,” Tony said.  In the dim light of the room, his face looked like it had been carved from marble, all hard lines and deep shadows, and his eyes were hooded.  Steve had seen fear on so many faces, in so many eyes, and yet it was different every time.  “I don’t trust them.”
“Another,” DJ said, his head on Tony’s shoulder.
DJ propped his chin on the edge of the workbench.  “Movie,” he said, his eyes bright.”
King Nicholas bowed.  “Your Highness.”
It threw him back again, but this time, Harris was there, catching him before he could end up back on the floor.  Strange reached out, his hand passing easily into the portal.  Confused, Harris did the same, his fingers passing the barrier with only the slightest resistance.  It felt like plunging his hand into half-solidified Jell-O, cool and thick, but certainly nothing that could stop him.
“Yes, ma’am,” Steve said, scrubbing the table down with quick, methodical movements.  She moved away, and he scowled down at the gleaming surface.  “I’ll be fine in a minute.”
“Captain Rogers?”
“The bookshelves, the bureau?  The bedside tables?  They’re all untouched.  Someone who was looking for something would’ve been far more thorough.  But the only parts of the room that have been searched are places a child could be hiding.”
The book rotated in place.
“Okay,” she said.  She maneuvered him into a chair, pushed him down.  He went without a fight, grateful that someone else was there to make the decision for him.  “The reception's still going on.  You excused yourself and then you came up here.  Jarvis called me.”
“Good night.”  He waited until she slipped out of the function room, then he reached for the trash can.
“You’re not going to sleep,” May told him, her voice stern.
And then, silence.
Once upon a time, there was a kingdom, that had stretched beyond its own reach, a kingdom that pressed against its own borders, even as its borders began to push back.  Once upon a time, there was a kingdom that stretched so high, it risked falling into its own shadow.
“You can wait a bit, your Highness,” she said, leading her horse to the side of the road.  The roan mare, her tail swishing, was pleased enough to stand in the shade of the trees, sniffing at the grass next to the wall there.  “We are days early still.”  She looked up at Shuri’s scowling face.  “Come.  Have something to eat.”
“Perhaps you should consider a date, rather than a public relations event,” Pepper said, her voice tart.  “With someone who enjoys your company and won’t attract-”  She waved a hand through the air.  “Bullets.”
“Why would you invite someone you hate to your wedding?” Steve asked.
Darcy considered that.  “Probably.  Still safer than-”
Tony smiled at Steve.  “I stand here, and I wonder.  If we break up, Steve, you'll leave a massive hole in my life, and I'm starting to think it would even scratch the surface of yours.”
He looked up, at the heavy weight of the vegetation that pressed in on them, a confusing tangle of impenetrable leaves and stems and blossoms, so thick that it threatened to block out the sun.  He could feel it, the damp air a physical pressure on his skin. And wondered if that warning was coming far too late.
Tony skidded to a stop, his heels digging into the carpet, twisting his arm in Steve’s grip.  “How dare you,” he bit out.  His chin came up, his eyes sharp.  “And what will you do if I don’t give you the blind obedience that you demand?”  He was so close that Steve could feel the heat of his body.  “Because you’re not in control here, Officer.  You’re not in charge.   You.  Have.  No.  Power.”
“I got it,” Trip said.  She looked at Steve.  “Do you promise to love, honor, and cherish Tony, in sickness and in health, in good times and bad, in alien invasions and supervillain attacks, as long as you both shall live?”
“Right, that's...   That's not going to slow him down,” Rogers said.  Tony stared at him, and for the first time, Rogers smiled, just a little, that wide, beautiful mouth curling up.  “But he wouldn't leave without his things, so he's still here, somewhere.”
“My-” Tony's mouth dropped open.  “Are you-  I don't have a type.”  He spotted Rhodey heading in their direction, and turned his attention to him. “Rhodey.  Do I have a type?”
“Mmmm,” Tony said, around a mouthful of pasta.  “I take it that the lock to the liquor cabinet is broken again?”
Obie was already shaking his head.  “Anthony, nothing would make me happier, you know that.  You’re such a clever boy, so-”  He paused, a faint smile creasing his cheeks.  “You know, when your father died, I thought we would lose you, too.”
Phil studied him, wondering why every warning sense in his brain was going off at the same time..  Clint seemed to be waiting for a response, and he sighed.  “Feel free.”
The boy shifted his weight.  “I don’t mind, sir.  I’m used to working, and I’ve got no head for schooling.”  He gave the basket a look.  “I wasn’t trying to take more than I always have, I swear, I just thought…”
Tony’s mouth opened.  Closed.  “No.”
"We actually have a lot of enemies, so-"
"I love you, man, but I do not love you that much," Sam told him with a smile.
“No.  I should’ve fucking tossed you out, you and your ‘there’s an issue with their paperwork,” she said to Harris.
“I’m guessing there’s something going on here that’s a problem, but I don’t know what it is,” Steve said.  He smoothed Tony’s hair back from his forehead.  “It’s Christmas, Tony, and I know he’s been buying presents for everyone, so-”
“Oh.”  Steve caught himself smiling down at the package in his hands.  “Okay.”  He cleared his throat.  “I mean, it's fine if he goes home, he should-”
Slowly, gently, Iron Man pulled them out of freefall, slowing their descent.  As they approached the ground, Iron Man shifted his grip, catching the straps of DJ’s backpack from behind, and swung him back into an upright position with practiced grace.
It was a smooth, simple piece, the light sliding over the surface.  No fuss.  Nothing obviously artistic about it.  But it was perfect, for all that.  Tony held out his hand, expecting Steve to hand it to him.  Instead, he cupped his hand around Tony's, sliding the ring smoothly onto his finger.
“We paid the rent for the next few months,” Tony said.  “Good enough.”
Tony's eyes snapped open.
“Better?” he asked.
Steve froze, halfway to the door.  But he knew better than to look back.  “Excuse me?”
It felt like a trap, but Steve wasn’t sure he cared.  “Fine.”  He looked up.  “Did you leave the greenhouse unlocked on purpose?”
"Sunlight is overrated," Tony said, which was the wrong thing to say, he knew it even as he was saying it, even as the words slipped out of his mouth.
Where the ceiling should’ve been, there was simply….  Nothing.  A void.  A lack.  As if whatever had been there had been consumed, been burned away, and there was nothing left, no dark or light, no sky, no sign of the building itself.
“Tony.”
“I do like to keep track of your failures,” he said, just to hear Steve laugh.  “They’re so few and far between.”
He shook his head.  “I'm fine,” he said, and Pepper nodded against his shoulder.
"Or at least not boring,” Steve said.
The apartment had an awkward layout, long and narrow, with a set of steep stairs against the wall leading up to the loft, like it had been carved out of space leftover when bigger and better floorplans had been completed around it.  From his vantage point, he could see only the edge of some that might've been a living room, the back of a couch and kitchen table pushed up against the wall, directly below the skylights, where it'd get the most sunlight.
He didn't want to think about how long he'd been in love with Steve Rogers.  If he allowed himself to dwell on that, he would lose what was left of his mind.
“And I think he likes me, we shoot hoops sometimes, and Jess convinced him to play badminton with us-”
Steve's lips twitched.  “Tony-”
“He's checking on his kid,” Steve corrected.  He held out a hand.  “Let's go.”
"Of course we are," Jarvis said, his voice expressionless.  "Why would we show sense?"
Tony’s eyes closed.  “Aw, fuck.  Nebula, I’m going to kill you.”
Tony gave him a look.  Jarvis smiled, unconcerned.  “Well, consider it over,” Tony said, his voice sharp.  “For now.  Until our guest decides he has further opinions on how this household ought to run.” He turned towards the main staircase.  “I expect it’ll be roughly around dusk when that happens.”
Tony rolled over, dragging the blankets up over his shoulder.  "That's cute," he said, grinning.  "I mean, I know I grew up with money, Rogers, but my father had a company to run, and my mother had her own work taking up most of her attention.  And my father chose my childcare providers more on 'do I want to sleep with her' questionnaire rather than due to any real qualifications.  I was not ringing my little silver bell and having my brow mopped with a cool cloth, let me tel you that much."
“I'm done discussing this,” Tony said, and for a second, the kitchen went still, every head swinging in his direction.
But apparently Iron Man did, because the torrent of words came to a sharp, stuttering stop.  There was a long moment of silence as they just faced each other, Rogers’ hand still hanging in space between them.  Then, finally, the faceplate of the helmet snapped up.
“Uh-huh.”  Tony held the plate out of reach.  “Jan handled it.  Don’t make yourself sick over some damn mini cannoli, Steve, and go get some real food.  I can take most of this team on an extended sugar rush, I do not know if I’d survive you.”
“I’ll give it my best shot,” Clint said, holding a hand out in her direction.  Laughing, she leaned forward, far enough to slap her palm against hers.  “She’s very tricky.”
“I sense I've hit a nerve,” Bucky said, and Tony was laughing against Steve's shoulder, his fingers clinging to Steve's shirt.
Tony took a deep breath.  “I’ve had a very tough twenty-four hours,” he said.  “All I’m asking is that you honor my attempt to be a semi-decent father to my half-Japanese child and cook my damn noodles, Yoshida.”
“I’m taking that as approval,” Harris said, his voice quiet.  “But that might be the panicked optimism talking.” He ran a gentle hand over the cat’s back, and it arched up, pressing its head into the hollow of his palm.  The angle made its ears go flat, and DJ smiled.
“The point is, I was there to handle that for you,” Bucky said.  “Because if he had been cheating on you, I would’ve had plenty of time to hunt him down, break both his legs, and make sure he took it back down before posting a really scathing Gulp! Review on him.”
Tony wasn't running.  He wasn't.  Running would be a symptom of panic, and he absolutely was not panicking.  So he wasn't running.  He wasn't running.
Which was not making this situation any better, or easier, but when had Tony ever cared about making things easy for himself?
Steve couldn't hold back a smile.  “You sure are,” he said, as Val came bouncing up to them.  “Thanks for coming.”
“No,” Harris said.  “Is he-” He paused.  “She?  They?  Any good at them?”
“Do not go down beneath the hill,” Steve said, his voice soft.  Almost reverent.  Bits of the old language was mixed with the new, and he shifted in his seat, remembering the thrill of fear her dire warnings had brought him.  “As some gates, once opened, cannot be closed again.  Do not follow the sound of the mournful horn.  It guides you down dark paths, and you’ll have no such help getting back.  Do not drink from their cups.  Even their water is like wine, and you will lose yourself.”
Jarvis gave him a look.  “No, but it sustained you more than once.  A slice of bread and a cup of milk was enough, even in this house.”
There was a strange, sharp popping noise.  It was, in the split second that Harris had time to think, like the sound of an incredibly large piece of popcorn exploding into existence.  It was not like a gunshot, or a firework, or a tire blowing out.  It was something entirely different, and entirely unfamiliar.
“Well, I think we're fucked, because that almost makes sense,” Tony said.
“Steve,” Steve said.
“Hey, if the guy looks like you, pretty sure she'll forgive me,” the photographer said.
Rhodey held up a hand. “No,” he said, shaking his head.  “Absolutely not.  I’m not getting involved in your latest act of madness, this is-”  He ducked as Happy went by, arms flailing through the air.  Rhodey watched him go, his face bemused, before looking back at Pepper.  “No.”
“Yeah, there was…  There was this guy there, someone who Thor knew, some big name from Europe,” Rhodey said.
Steve came jogging down the stairs, shaking his head the entire way. “Apparently he can,” he said.  He sounded incredulous, but Tony could hear the amusement under the words.  He gave Tony a look.  “Are you out of your mind?”
Tony shook his head.  “No, he just does that.”  He gestured in Steve’s direction.  “He’s just…”  He nodded.  “Like that.”
“Not here,” Steve said.  He sounded like he was strangling.  “Not-  Not here, Tony.”  He grabbed Tony’s hand.  “Let’s go.”
The song and dance before the movie was enough to enthrall the boys within a matter of minutes.  Tony, for his part, had more fun watching them than the chorus girls.  Next to him, DJ bounced in his seat, his hands braced on the edge of the cushion.  Every so often, Tony bumped his foot against DJ’s, and DJ would bump back, even if his eyes never left the stage.
“Get in the car,” he said.
In the silence that followed, Peter gestured at Clint with both hands.  “Clint Barton, ladies and gentlemen,” he said, and everyone was laughing now, everyone except Clint, who just grinned, unrepentant.  “Someone gave him government clearance.”
Steve jerked his hand back down.  “Hi, Luke,” he said, trying for a natural smile. “Enjoying yourself?”
Tony stopped, his eyes going wide.  “Huh,” he said at last.  “Wow.  I mean, yes, but-”
Steve stared at him, then at Jan.  She gave him a 'what are you waiting for?' look, gesturing at Clint.  "All right.  One hand on his hip, the other, take that, and-”
“Maybe we both need practice,” Tony said.  “All the legalities.  All the paperwork.  All the possibilities for things going wrong, every Doombot and paparazzi-”
“You always want to sleep,” Tony pointed out.
“If you lick that,” Tony started, as DJ held it out in front of him.
“Never tell me the odds,” Clint said.  They stopped at a red light, and he craned his head forward, trying to get a better angle out of the windshield.  “What time is it?  Maybe we’ll see the fountains go off.”
He braced a hand on the desk.  “So you let them build their own.  Fill ramekins with shredded carrots and chopped mushrooms and cubes of roast chicken.  Give them tiny rice paper wraps or taco shells.  Give them cheese and dressing and lettuce and let them make their own dinner.”  He shook his head.  “Stir fry tableside, or toss their pasta while they watch, in whatever mess of stuff they want.  And if you have to, have to, have to include the words ‘chicken nuggets’ on your menu and Jesus Christ, I don’t think you do, you have a full kitchen.  You have a full staff.  Learn how to fry some real goddamn fried chicken and if you look in your freezer today and anything in there says ‘Tyson pre-breaded,’ well, then, FUCK YOU.”
Tony rolled a silver ball bearing across the workbench in DJ's direction.  It rattled across the battered surface, catching the light every time it bounced.  DJ reached out, his fingers closing around the tiny steel ball.  "We're fine, Jarvis," Tony said, wiggling his fingers against the bench.  DJ took the hint and rolled it back.  "Bring us something-"  He paused.  "Low effort."
“We trust you.”  Pepper pulled his hand away from his hair.  “Stop it, you’re making a mess.  We do trust you.  And I find-”  She exhaled.  “I want to trust him.  More than I feel I should.  Hill’s never steered us wrong, but she’s never kept us in the dark this long, either.”
Jesse nodded.  “We were late-”
"How would you know?" Mackenzie said, leaning against the counter again, claiming the space.  Her long braids slid over her shoulder, heavy and dark and gleaming against the crisp blue of her apron.
“Probably,” Peter said, swinging by.
Clint looked at Natasha.  Natasha looked at Clint.  “So,” he drawled.  “A trap.”
“Should've thought of that before you came in here and slept on my boyfriend,” Steve called over his shoulder.
Obie smiled at him, and the fireplace behind him cast his face in sharp relief.  “Like a good boy.”
“Tony,” she said, catching his attention.  Tony looked at her, blinking.  Sue took a deep breath.  “There's a child.  In your workshop.”
"A thing," Tony confirmed.  "A, like, a thing, Steve?"  Steve was still staring at him, his face oddly pale.  "They think we got married.  What would you call the thing last night?"
Obie nodded.  “That’s my boy,” he said, his voice approving.  And Tony hated how much better that made him feel.  Obie straightened up.  “Since you were late, though, I think you should clear the table tonight.  I’ll let Mrs. Arbogast know that you’re to wash the dishes tonight.”  He arched an eyebrow, a jovial smile on his face.  “I think that’s a fitting punishment, don’t you?”
“Any time,” he agreed.  “I love you.”
Steve's head fell forward.  “Bucky, you have five minutes to get out of here, or I swear I'm going to start stripping and throwing every single piece of clothing at you.”
“Things are…  Complicated, right now,” Steve admitted.
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis said, not missing a beat.  Tony gave him a suspicious look, and Jarvis smiled, just a bit.  “He’s not allowed to do many things.  Unfortunately, every attempt his aunt has made to make him understand his rather unenviable position as the child of the help has been undermined by her employer.”  He folded his hands behind his back, his body canting forward just a bit.  “Leaving him with a sense of himself as a valued and appreciated member of the household.”
Someone he didn’t know.  Someone he wasn’t even sure he liked.
“Hi,” Steve said.  “Couch time.”
"I know, I know, I'm GOING," Ellen said, grabbing her bag from the back of the chair.  “And your bow tie is crooked.”
Duck gave her a look.  Jesse stared at him, her face impassive.  After a long, silent moment, Duck reached for his phone.  Ellen's eyes darted towards Jesse.  “What?” she mouthed.
Someone, probably Peter, nudged the camera up until Tony’s face could be seen again.  “You build a dish around something and then just, you know, take it out, then fuck you, it’s going to be bad.  And what that says is that you want this person’s money, but you consider them an annoyance.  The same fuckers who are pitching diva hissy fits about someone asking to have the sauce on the side, or asking for an alteration in the spice level, and I see that, I see that behavior and you should be ashamed, I’m ashamed for you and I’m over here on the other side of the room pretending I don’t know you, Jesus, I really wish I didn’t because you’re insufferable, goddaaaaaaaaamn.”
“On it,” Steve said, watching the fire.  “Be careful.”
Tony smiled back.  “Tomorrow I have other things to do,” he said, his voice almost apologetic.   “I’ll…”  Exhaustion was a constant companion by now.  Jobs.  So many jobs.  So many things to do, to think of, to handle, to-  He shook his head, refusing to dwell on that.  “I need to get my toolbox, at least.”
“Sir?”
Clint shrugged, and immediately winced.  “Dunno.  But sorry they took off before you got here.”  He slid off the stretcher, his booted feet hitting the ground with a solid thump.  “Would've liked to see how that would've worked out for you.”
Tony looked at him, his eyes narrowed, as if he was looking for some sort of hidden meaning in Rogers's very straightforward words. “Yes,” he said at last. It sounded a bit like a question.  “I mean.  I’m not.  Jan is.  Because Jan doesn’t have any idea how to do things by half measures.  It’s part of her charm, but sometimes, honestly, she’s-”
Tony’s eyes closed.  “Yeah.  I was thinking of ordering more, now I don’t know if I can.”
Steve felt his face heat.  “I’m sure it’s around here somewhere,” he said.  He bunched a pillow in his arms, telling himself he wasn’t hiding in its depths.  “It’s not as if I tossed it out the window.”
“Don't believe them,” Tony told him.  “I'm a paragon of virtue.”
Tony set his bottle of soda down on the workbench.  “Maybe I shouldn’t have thrown that,” he said, his voice thin.
“Hmm,” Jarvis said, which was somehow both noncommittal and disapproving at the same time.  Tony was impressed.  “Perhaps sir would like his own piece of paper so he can write his own letter to Officer Rogers.”
“For all you know, I could!” Tony said, shaking out his fingers.  They tingled, and he ignored that.  “So don’t sneak up behind me like that, it’s fucking annoying.”
Tony paused, studying him.  "Well, I thought it was your collar, but maybe it's your shorts you've got in a bunch," he said, and Steve choked on a laugh, his face twisting with the force to hold it in.  Tony smirked at him.  "Here, let me check-"  He reached for the waistband of Steve's pants, and Steve skittered sideways, his breath leaving him in a burst of laughter.
“Familiar,” Phil said.  He reached into the box.  “Is this…”
Steve shook his head.  “Can someone please tell us what’s happening?” he asked, and DJ could hear the strain in his voice.
“Give me one good reason I should still take you to the movies tonight,” Tony said, deliberately away from Steve.  “One good reason.”  DJ flopped forward, his head tucked against Tony’s shoulder.  Tony tried not to laugh as DJ peeked up at him, his face sad.  “All right, that is a very effective argument.  However, I refuse to be seen in public with a boy who has soap in his hair.  How will we be handling this?”
Tony saluted him with his water cup.  “Expect to repair these at least once,” he said.
He suddenly wanted to be anywhere but here.  Of all the places for his heart to be broken, the woman’s locker room hadn’t even been on the list of possibilities.  It felt somehow appropriate anyway.
“Nothing,” she grumbled.  Tony gave her a look, and she made a face.  “No.  Literally nothing.  I’m fairly certain he’s forgotten that I exist again.”
Tony leaned back into the solid warmth of Steve’s body.  “And how, exactly, do you know this?” he asked, his head tipping in Steve’s direction.
“How's that working for you?”
“Where?”
No.  Not at all.  Tony smiled back.  “Sure,” he said.
The cat stretched up, bracing its front paws on the edge of the planter, its whiskers wriggling as it sniffed the soil.  Tony stood.  "Oh, no.  Out of my plant.  Out of-" The cat's head tipped in his direction, studying him for only a moment before it went back to pawing at the dirt.  "Absolutely not." Tony leaned over, hoping that he could extract it without losing a hand.
“I think she’s justified,” Steve said as the other car came to a screeching halt behind them.  He gave it a wary look.  “We have options.”
“She will be talking to other royals,” T’Challa said.
Gyrich turned his back to Coulson, staring at the rest of the team. “Where's the girl?” he asked them.
DJ grinned at him. “That,” he said, reaching for a pair of pliers, “is lie.” He stopped, concentrated on putting the words in order, in the right order.  “Is a lie.”
“You’ll be pleased to know that the chicken and a lovely medley of root vegetables are roasting away in the oven,” May said.  “Angel food cake, vanilla ice cream and fresh blackberry sauce for dessert.”
“What the hell is going on in here?”
“Is this because I left the laundry in the washer machine and it’s probably a ball of mildew and hate by now?”
“He says that like someone bleeding is unusual for movie night,” Sam said, picking up the teapot.  He filled a cup with a practiced gesture, the tea pooling neatly in the hollow of the cup.
“No, it didn’t,” Strange said.  DJ looked down, and Strange sighed.  “DJ.  If someone has just learned to change a lightbulb, that does not mean that they’ll be capable of rewiring the entirety of a house.”  He smiled.  “You changed your lightbulb very well.  We can build on that.”
"The couch has an infestation," Steve said.  He ducked as Bucky tried to kick him in the head.  "Getting slow, buddy."  He caught hold of Tony's arms and pulled him to his feet.  Tony rocked forward, swaying into the shelter of Steve's body.  Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's waist.  "Hi."
Tony nodded.  “Yes.  Yes, you can.” He rolled, going up on one knee so he could press a gentle kiss to DJ’s forehead.  He smelled familiar, and Tony didn’t know why.  “You absolutely can.”
“I’ll see if I can’t find you a small glass of something more palatable,” Jarvis said.  He smiled down at DJ.  “I made DJ a cup of warm milk with chocolate melted into it.  It might not be much, but it certainly seemed to be appreciated.”
Heat washed over him, fast and sharp, and Steve caught Tony’s chin in the cradle of one palm, pulling him up for a kiss.  Laughing, Tony met him halfway, that dangerous, wicked mouth of his drawing Steve in and dragging him down.  “Maybe later,” he whispered against Steve’s lips, and Steve kissed him again, because if he kept talking, Steve was going to lose his mind.
“Cause I wanna load a fresh memory card if you're going to do something interesting.”
“Yes, yes, we are, but since you weren’t answering, Harris texted me and Darce and told us the op was over.”  Clint leaned against the side of the car.  “You coming to witness this debacle?”
“Well, what a gorgeous little baby,” Danvers said, scooping the cat off of his shoulder, her hands cradling its slight weight.  “Down we go.”  She leaned over, setting the cat on the floor and paused to rub its ears.  “Now, be a good little mouser.”
He remembered falling, remembered bracing himself for the impact, for what he knew was coming and then he hit, hard and fast and with enough force to drive the breath out of him. He hung there for an instant, his body a live wire of pain, and then it was over, and he was on his back, he was upside down and sideways and there was something very hard digging into his ribs.
Tony leaned back in his chair, taking a moment to steady himself.  “Yeah,” he managed, and his voice wasn’t shaking, he could convince himself of that.  “Right.  You-”  He nodded.  “Well, that’s freshman me, right there.”  He reached for the coffee pot, because that was a lifeline that he could understand, and it was a hell of a lot safer than most of his lifelines.  “Promise me something, kid.  Stay out of the frat parties.”
Steve shifted in his chair, his legs kicking the air as he tried to find a comfortable position.  “Are there fairies in America?” he repeated, rolling the bit of pencil between his fingers.  He smoothed a wrinkle out of the paper, careful not to pull too hard.  The scraps his mother salvaged from the trash at the hospital were almost always crumbled, but he preferred them to the sheets of newsprint he could find on his own.  “I was wondering.”
Tony studied him. “I suspect him of sleeping his way through the staff,” he said at last.  “Just so you know.  I’m watching you for any sign that you’re succumbing to his charms.”
Steve rolled his eyes.  “I've got a long day of serving and schmoozing,” he said.  “And there's a lot of friendly competition here, I think wearing pants is a good first step to keeping myself afloat.”
Not like he’d done much sleeping these last few days.
“And after Jarvis left, Clint gave Natasha money,” Peter said.  DJ pushed at his hands.  “Can I stop-”
She leaned back in her chair, rocking it back on the casters.  “I mean, it’s pretty important to a lot of people,” she said with a smile.  “I’m just…” She looked at the display of reusable bridal bouquets, something which most people would’ve considered tacky.  She’d always liked it, though.  The flowers never faded, silk petals holding their shape and color year after year.  More permanent than some of the marriages they’d blessed.
“People we don't like and also Peter-” Jan amended.
“Hi, Darcy?” Harris said.
“It means you manage to knock the pins out from under me, every time,” Steve said.  He held up his hand, letting the ring catch the light.  His smile was slight, almost shy, but his eyes were brilliant.  Steve's thumb slid over the band.  “So, am I wearing this home, or are you having it wrapped up?”
Rogers stared at him.  "Frolicking?" he asked, and there was that smile again, the one he tried not to hide.  But there was laughter in his voice, and creases in his cheeks when he tried to keep his mouth set in a frown.  Tony grinned at him.
“I can’t believe that Thor didn’t stop it,” Tony said.  “He can usually handle a drunk-”
She held out a hand, and Steve stepped forward, taking it and raising it to his lips in a theatrical gesture.  Tony stomped down on a wholly irrational spike of jealousy.  “If you’ve ever a need for a good suit, I demand the right of first refusal,” she said.  “If you’re going to jilt me so cruelly, you owe me that much.”
“A few years, yes, sir,” Jarvis said.
“Oh.  Peter grimaced.  “No.  That’s....”  He pasted a smile on his face.  “I’m going to make coffee.”
“Yeah, you're sick, it's fine, it's just fine,” he said, trying to sound soothing and not exhausted.  “You're going to make it worse if you don't get some rest, Tony, so-”
Tony subsided into a chair, letting his head fall into the cradle of his hands. He focused on his breathing, on keeping everything calm and controlled. He could control this.
"We'll be fine," Steve said, wrapping his arm snuggly around Tony's waist.  He tucked Tony up close to his side, and started muscling him towards the door.  "I'll keep you updated."
But Tony was smiling in his sleep, just a little, those beautiful lips curled up at the corners.  His long, dark lashes were still, one hand resting on the pillow beside his cheek.  His fingers were lax, and Steve found himself fascinated by their almost elegant structure, an anatomical study that he wanted to which he could’ve dedicated dozens of pages, and hours of his time.
Once he was back in the hallway, Steve collapsed against the wall, his hands braced on his thighs, his head hanging down.  He took a deep breath, and another.  “Jarvis?”  He swallowed.  “Did Tony go back to the office?”
“No, that would be you,” Agatha said, going back to her tea.
“What the hell does that even mean?” Sam asked her.
“Put on your trash costume!” Tony yelled, spooning fruit onto his plate.  He paused, then dropped a croissant onto the top of the fruit.  Fuck it.  He deserved it.  Also more bacon.
Steve nodded.  “Yes, your Majesty.  You were…”  He scrubbed a hand over his eyes.  “You were King Phillips’ spymaster.”
Her eyelashes dipped, slow and languid as she tied her hair back with a bit of cord.  “I’m sure it was,” she said, striding past him to check the pressure gauges on the still.  “Since you respect locked doors so much.  No chance you would've forced one open.”
“You owe me ten pounds of gourmet Swiss chocolate and a couple of dozen roses,” Pepper said.  “In that I’m going to have to spend our day off tomorrow dealing with complaints from people who didn’t get tables tonight.”
Tony let out a happy sigh, and rolled over.  “Thanks,” he mumbled, fumbling for a pillow.  “That's-”  He buried his face in the fabric.  “That's good.”
"What's the difference?" Steve asked, ducking around him to open the fridge.
Tony nodded.  “No, no, of course not.”
“The rest….”  Harris exhaled.  “How much was that?”
“Dramatic, but not life threatening,” Bruce said.  He flicked a finger against the glass bottle hanging from the stand next to the bed.  “Our usual cheerful volunteer has been hard at work.”
“Excuse me, I gave him a perfectly good codename,” Bobbi said, tapping a finger against her lips.
Tony nodded.  “He’s completely fucked the Foundation Budget, you know that, don’t you?  They think I’m the one who did it, and now there’s a surplus and it’s-  It’s chaos over there, Steve.  So many very upstanding members of society caught between gratitude and wanting to murder me.”
“Hey,” he said, his voice soft.  “We're here.  You gonna wake up?”
“They'll work just as hard as I did, be just as talented as I am, and they'll never make it, because they don't get the break they need.  Because something, or someone, holds them back.”  Steve's fingers tapped lightly on the polished wood of the counter.  “And I walked away from that, from a thing a lot of people want and will never get.  I rejected that.
"Eat," he said, collecting the potatoes, as the back door opened again.
Tony looked at DJ.  “Don’t you want to be special?” he asked.
“He’s hard of hearing,” Peter mumbled into the carpet.
“Fine with me.” Tony grinned at him.  “I'm not going to be watching it anyway.”
“Oh, God.”  Tony squeezed his eyes shut.  “Is it morning?”
“Also,” Jan said, perching on the edge of a piece of fractured concrete, “because I kind of figured they were doing it to you, too.”  She leaned forward.  “Is this really your first time?”
Steve tried to smile, but it felt odd on his face.  "Tony.  Everyone always looked at me differently.  Before the serum.  And after.  What I was, who I was, for some people, that changed.  For me, it didn't."  He took a breath.  "For the people who mattered, it didn't."
“I think that is an absolute certainty,” Tony said.  To Fury, he said, “Just how many of these things are we dealing with?”
"Rogers!"
"Long enough for you to get your tongue stuck in the neck of the bottle, and then laugh yourself almost to tears about that once you got yourself free," Steve said, grinning.  Tony pinched the bridge of his nose.  "Alcoholic battery acid, Tony."
DJ blinked at her, confused, and she gave him a slight smile.  “I don’t like the other ones,” she explained, her voice kind, and DJ nodded.
Steve, being Steve, held out hope longer than he did.   He barely waited until Strange floated to the ground, the portal folding out of existence behind him, before he spoke.  “What do you have for us?”
“It seemed prudent.” Steve lay his book down on his lap, spine up.  “Also, wondering why my boyfriend was ducking my phone calls.”
Tony glanced at Pepper, who shook her head, her face puzzled.  "What do you mean, attempted?  He had the codes, he had-"
“We don't have much of a leftover problem around here,” Tony said to Rhodey.
Steve’s fingers stroked at his waist, twitching up under the fabric of his shirt.  “Did you-”
“Trust me, my darling, I know that-” Strange tried, and that was as far as he got before Clea swept a hand through the air, stepping into the gesture, and in an instant, she was gone.  Above them, the trees shuddered, leaves clattering against each other, despite the lack of a breeze.
“Keep the door locked,” he said, even as he kicked the curtain to the back room out of the way.  There was no response, and Tony turned around, leaning back into the shop.  “Did you hear-”
“Mr. Morrison?” Steve looked at him. His teeth flashed in a brilliant smile. “Be glad you're only dealing with me.”
“Yes.”  The word was out before Tony actually finished asking the question.  Steve took a deep breath.  “Do you?”
They wove through the old apple and pear trees together, their steps almost in tandem.  Bobbi didn’t seem to be paying attention to where they were going, her head down, her shoulders squared.  “When I was a teenager, things started to fall apart.  There was a political skirmish in the Chemistry department, and my father’s loyalty to his adopted country was questioned.  When he got fired, well, he also got blackballed.  No one would hire him.”
Clint muttered something that Tony was pretty sure meant ‘I will murder him in his sleep’ in Clint’s made up language.  He grinned.  “Hey, Deej?  Wanna help me take apart a coffee grinder?”
“Came along with Coulson,” Steve said.
“Thank you.” She tossed her head.  “So do I.”
Steve stared at him.  “Why is Tony texting you?” he repeated.
Not sure how he'd gotten to this point in his life, Steve decided that giving up the jacket, which he'd never wanted to begin with, was the safest course of action.  He wriggled free of it, trying to ignore the pained sounds she made.  “It fit well enough,” he said, handing it over.
Steve swung his own helmet on.  When he spoke again, it came through the radio unit on the helmet.  “That's what you think.”  He rocked the bike upright, knocked the kickstand back with a flick of his heel, and gunned the engine.
Jan pulled away from Steve, letting him take his clothes from her arms.  He shoved them in the nearest box before she could decide to make another try for them.  “No, I don't live here, which means my only chance to judge people's living spaces if is they move.”
Tony took a step forward before he turned back towards Steve, one hand reaching him.  “Welcome home,” he said, and Steve caught his fingers.
Tony’s lips twitched.  “There’s no magic word,” he said, catching her hand as she skipped in a wide circle around him, the toes of her boots poking at individual stones.  “Hank-”
Tony collapsed back onto the bed, mumbling something under his breath, and it sounded almost like “I love you,” and Steve did his best to ignore that.  Certain things, after all, just weren’t good for his mental health.
He needed more than 'none,' though.
“What's happening?” Steve asked, as Sam stumbled for the coffee pot, scratching idly at his head.
“Ready?” Steve asked.
Tony was fighting them, howling at them, but he was up, he was alive, and they had him.  Steve swiveled on his heel, the garbage can lid up in front of him, muscle memory pulling him through.  Not one.  Never one.  One could fail.  One would fail.  Something public like this, something this risky, not one, there would be more, there would be-
By the time he reached the kitchen, Tony had already collected a coffee cup from the cupboard.  He looked over his shoulder as Steve walked in.  “Hey, Cap,” he said with a smile.  “I’m going to fall asleep unless I get some coffee in me.”  He held up the cup.  “Want some?”
There was silence. For a long moment, everyone just stared at him. And then Joy said, "I'm sorry, what?"
“Tony.”
“Why didn’t you delete that?” Jessica asked Peter, and Tony stopped dead.
“Are you going to watch it?”
“The department issues Colts now,” Steve said, returning it to his holster.  “But I know this one, and it's never failed me.  It's....”  Comforting.  Which was a bad word to assign to a weapon, and he knew it.  A gun could become a crutch, far too easily.  He knew men whose first, last and only response was to pull the trigger, no matter what the situation, and he couldn't imagine anything worse.
“I mean, I technically did,” Tony said.  He leaned against the workbench.  “Wow.  Now that you say it, yes.  I guess I did.”  He straightened up.  “He's kind of a lab accident, I mean, a lot of kids aren't precisely planned, but DJ does take it to an entirely new level, which is kind of funny when you-”  He glanced up, and caught the look on her face.  Tony arched his eyebrows.  “Not funny?”
“Yes?”
“I was going to call you, but you cry about these things,” Tony said.  “Which, I’ll admit, makes me quite uncomfortable.”
“I'll see if I can run interference,” Marcy said.
DJ looked at his hands.  “Plants were sick.  Some of them.  Had to wash the solar room.”
DJ reached for another cookie.  Cookies were uncomplicated.  “Yes,” he said, because Steve had that pinched, tight look on his face again, and he hated that face.  The answer must’ve been the one that Steve had been hoping for, because his face relaxed.  DJ smiled at him.  “Figure it out.”
“I wanted a coffee,” Tony said.  He turned to face Steve, pulling his sunglasses off.  He held them off to Harris, who took them without thinking.  “Marry me.”
Pepper sipped her lemonade.  “Oh, God, no, he's far worse than Tony when he gets going.”  She smiled.  “But he does like to think of himself as the responsible one.”
“The French,” Tony said.  “Most of Europe, actually, but mostly, yes, the French.”
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Tony said.  He reached for his bowl.  “But because I got hurt, Jarvis made me something to eat.  My favorite thing.”  He held it out so DJ could consider the contents.  “It’s pasta with tomatoes, sausage, and cheese.  Want to try it?”
“They’re not doing a particularly good job,” Steve said, sinking down onto the step beside her.
“No,” Bruce said, and then, a moment later, “Who’s ‘we’?”
Steve’s eyes rolled up.  “Your highness,” he echoed, giving her a bow.
"I don't know why she records that, she doesn't even seem to like it," Steve said.
"Right, we're going to-" Jan poked Steve in the stomach, her lips pursed.  "We're going to need more."
“Okay, other than that...” Rhodey said.
“Indeed,” Agatha said, with a sip of tea.
Tony shook his head, something like a laugh slipping out from his tight lips.  “And here I was hoping you'd point out that I don't have to do anything I don't want to do.”
Frustration overwhelmed him.  “Because I said so,” he finished, and it was stupid and childish and he didn’t care.  If there was one thing his father had taught him, it was that Starks made their own reality.  The rest of the world be damned.  If he wanted to do it, he did it, and to hell with anyone who said differently.
Both hands went back to the steering wheel.  “He’s got steady hands and doesn’t flinch from the sight of blood, let me tell you.  Just likes plants more, I guess.”
“Yes,” May said, her arms tightening.  “You’ve mentioned that.”  The hug went on forever, for so long that when she finally let go, Tony could swear he could feel the imprint of it against his skin, a bruise that he wasn’t sure he’d be able to shake.  May took a step back, and she wasn’t crying, but her eyes were bright with unshed tears.  “He admires you a great deal, you know.”
“I’m trying to imagine you in a Denny’s and, uh, I’m failing,” Bruce said.
“What’s the password?”
“I'm sure I'll eventually move to a house where it doesn't fit the décor,” Jan said.  “But in the meantime, don't worry, I had the Metropolitan Museum make me one of those little white placards they put on their exhibits, and I mounted it right next to the vase.  'From the Collection of Anthony Stark.'
“And we’re going for a swim before lunch,” Pepper said.  “So that’ll be a natural stopping point.”
“Tony-”
He looked down at the flask in his hand, water dripping along the polished metal and wood, making it glow in the sunlight.  “Know what?” he asked, turning it from side to side, watching the light flare along the surface.  “Waking up in Wakanda might’ve been a blessing.”  He looked up to find Bucky watching him, and smiled.  “After that, coming back here feels more familiar.  Things may have changed.  I may have forgotten a road or two, and a few villages may have moved while I was sleeping-”
Steve's bed.  Steve's apartment.
Bruce was laughing, his shoulder shaking as he tried to choke back the sound.  “That’s…  That’s-”
"Wake up."
Work was the solution.  Work had always been the solution, and it would always be the solution.  After all, he thought with a wry twist to his lips, it wasn't like had another one.
Pepper rocked back in her chair.  “I’ll be honest,” she said.  “There’s so much redacting in that file, that nothing short of a microscope would allow me to look ‘closer.’  We’ve got locations, and dates and the implication that someone, probably multiple someones, think he’s very important.”
Steve stared at him, caught between annoyance and amusement.
The lights dimmed, and the TV flickered to life, music swelling.  Steve paused, his chopsticks halfway to his mouth  “Is this…  Is this the muppets version?” he asked, his voice quiet.
“Tony-”
“Of course.” Tony waited until he left the room before he stood, straightening his shirt.  He was a mass of wrinkles at this point, and there was little he could do about it, but he also didn’t want to waste the time it would take him to change.
DJ took another bite of his soup, watching the creature lean into Harris’ hand. “How did it get here?”
“My father built this place, I think, as an apology,” he said, his voice quiet.  “Sorry.  Sorry it’s cold.  Sorry it’s gray.  Sorry it’s so frightening.”  Sorry I’m not a better man.  He swallowed that, around the hard lump in his throat.  “He built her a house, an amazing, opulent, massive house, bigger than anyone else had, better, he hired craftsmen and artists and stone masons and painters, and he built her this house.”  Tony spread his hands above his head, gesturing at the mansion itself.  “He tried to make her something like what she’d left behind but…”  He smiled at DJ.  “His taste was not the best, I think.”
“Don't you worry, Officer,” Billy said. “I'm keeping the rabble at bay, aren't I, Miss Potts?”
Bruce met Steve’s eyes.  Steve sighed.  “Where did Natasha find him?” he asked.
She stopped, and Steve shifted in his seat.  “If no one's buying, then-" His voice trailed away, the question implied rather than spoken.
He walked back to his chair and dropped back into it with a heavy sigh.  “The lost heir.  The prodigal son.  Home at last.”
"And doing this, making this public, that changes the perception again, doesn't it?" Morrison asked. "You've altered your legacy here, Captain. Your war record is going to take a backseat to your personal life."
“Relationship,” Steve said, because there was no point in pretending otherwise, not now.  He fiddled with the glasses.  “I don't think these suit me, Jan.”
“Don't look at the fine officer of the law that way,” Pepper said, her voice pitched low.
Tony ducked his head to hide his smile.  "Right.  Can't commit to a course of action unless you're sure of what the extenuating circumstances are."
Steve nodded.  “Reckon I’m not,” he agreed.  He straightened up, pushing the car door shut with one hand.  He took a step back, letting Happy pull the car away, and turned back towards the house.
“Ah,” Stark said.  “‘Barton is an asshole’ confirmed for a universal constant.”
It might've been a bad choice.  And he didn't even care.
Tony nodded back.  “I’m holding you to that,” he said, his voice dire, and then Strange was gone, winking out of existence so quickly that Tony didn’t know if he had even heard the end of that sentence.
“It happens a lot,” Steve admitted.  “Okay.  Right.  Everyone go to bed.  Pickup can wait until tomorrow.”
Tony looked up at him.  “Yes,” he managed.  And again, more certain this time, “Yes.”
He looked down.  It might’ve been liquid.  It sure looked liquid.  He was pretty sure it shouldn’t have been liquid.  Or even semi-liquid.
Tony struggled to keep a straight face, despite the way his heart was pounding. “Why, is there something you wanted me to hear?” He arched an eyebrow. “Or something you didn't want me to hear.”
"They'll be fine," Mrs. Parker said, shaking out the blanket.  Tony looked at her.  She looked back, unimpressed.  Tony gestured at the two boys, and she heaved a sigh.  "Mr. Stark, they will be fine.  Peter is a very responsible boy."
He could hear that.  Somehow.  Steve could hear Tony, in the early hours of the morning, half awake, trying to figure out this newest puzzle, making the offer.  “I take it you were good with plants?”
Tony buttoned the jacket, and glanced at himself in the mirror as Jarvis collected the hanger.  "Well?" Tony asked.
“I set all your meetings, so I can be fairly confident in saying no, you don’t,” Pepper said with a sugary sweet smile.  “Eleven. Be ready, or I’ll have Happy toss you in, suit and all.”
Smiling, Steve looked away.  Desperate for something to focus on that wasn't the domestic squabble, his gaze caught on the plans Stark had spread out over the table.  He stared down at the papers, his smile melting away.  He flicked the top one up, and comparing it to the one below it.  His eyes narrowed.  "Huh."
Steve crouched down in front of her, his arms braced on his legs.  “You can if you want to?” he said, and she nodded.  “Okay, then, go ahead.”
Tony nodded, his shoulders flexing as he tried to calm his breathing.  “Rogers.  We don’t know-”
“Maybe you should let someone pick a fight before you work yourself into a lather,” Jesse said.
“I’ll hold him still, you tape him up,” Darcy said, grabbing Clint’s arm and holding it out straight.  “You, let the woman work.”
“And you were prepared for that with a picture of-”  Tony gestured at the screen.  “What IS that, kid?”
Steve looked back over his shoulder, his eyes scanning over the lawn, looking for movement, for anything that was out of place.  But everything was still, the grounds silent.  He took a deep breath.  “Deej?  Don’t go any further, and you can stay out here for a bit, all right?”
“Look, it’s for your benefit,” Bucky said.
Steve shook his head.  “I told him I didn’t want to date you, then I told you I didn’t want to date you, in front of him.  What the hell else am I supposed to do?”
The array of cars was dizzying.
Before he could do more than reach for the ring, Steve's fingers snapped closed, curling tight against his palm.  He pulled his hand back, out of reach, before he let his hand relax again.  “Give a fella a second, will ya?” he asked.
Steve took a deep breath.  “I'm trying not to be irrational here.”
Steve rolled his eyes, telling himself that he wasn't as hot as it felt. The suit that Miss Van Dyne had sent over fit him like a glove. Not that he'd expected anyone to notice. Certainly not Tony, who was used to people wearing things that, well, fit properly. "You scared her off," he said. "Can you at least button your shirt properly, Seamus?"
Tony's eyes slid shut.  “Glad one of us thinks so.”  With one last glance back at his sleeping child, he headed for the door.  “Glad someone does.”
"Dinner for nine," Miss Van Dyne said, holding DJ's feet up.  He tumbled backwards, still laughing.  Thor leaned a hand on the bed, grinning down at them both.
Steve nodded.  "'Them?'  Is Val-"
Tony paused, halfway up the hallway, a hastily wrapped present braced against one hip and the others cradled against his chest.  “Did...  Did you just hear yourself saying that?  Was that something you said?  Willingly, did you-”
“I take it you're a good judge of character?” she said, blowing across the surface of her tea.  The smell was...  Questionable.  She lowered the cup back to the saucer without tasting it.
Tony took a deep breath and let it out.  His eyes were stinging, and he didn’t want to examine why, whether this was grief or relief, or something else entirely.  He’d thought he knew loss, in all its myriad forms, but this was new, for all that it was familiar.
The servants’ staircase let out in a narrow hallway that ran in an almost invisible space between the main rooms on the second floor.  It had taken him a long time to memorize all of the twisting back corridors, the hidden spaces that most visitors to the house never saw, but by now he knew it like the back of his hand.
DJ dropped his pencil, taking the letter with both hands.  He grinned up at Jarvis.  “Thanks,” he said, turning the envelope over and over in his hands, inspecting it from every angle.
“Keep telling yourself that,” Tony said, as Darcy took her phone back.
“Can I-  Of course, I mean, obviously I can skate!” Tony said, and Steve gave him a look.  Tony's chin came up.  “Who can't skate?”
“I can get him,” Aunt May said, jamming her feet into her slippers.  “Are you-”
“We’ve had quite a few years to acquire them, if you think about it,” Jarvis said.  “A few purchase here and there, added to storage.” He dusted off the top of a box with the side of his hand.  “It’s not as if you’ve ever been up in the attic.”
“Don’t you dare, I’m hiring a caterer,” Jan said.  She looked at Natasha.  “Are you going to help me out here?”
“Only ones made by Nazis, I think yours is safe,” Steve said, with an easy going smile.  Tony caught himself smiling back, despite his headache.  “But your phone is starting to annoy me, so I might be tempted.”
“Ah.”  Agatha nodded.  “Then, you’re asking how I could mistake you for her?  When you lack the strength that she possesses?”
Tony balanced him, his body relaxed, his hands in constant motion as he bit out his words.  His tension bled out in small ways, in the way he shifted his weight back and forth on the balls of his feet, always on the edge of flight.  His face was open and calm, a slight smile on his face, but his eyes were blank and sharp.
“Nope.”  DJ grabbed his bag.  He would’ve taken it, even without Steve’s suggestion.  The weight of it, hanging from his hand or his shoulder, was comforting.   He shifted, settling it against his back, and wondered if this was how his father felt about the armor.  “By the door.”
“Tony,” Obie said, a faintly amused note undercutting the scolding look he gave Tony.
Another pause.  “Okay, I'm lost.  Can we back up?”
“No,” Tony said.
“You really gonna bring this up again?  Really?” Logan asked, leveling a look in Clint's direction.
"Just Natasha is fine," she said with a faint smile.  “Come along.  The stairs to the kitchen are this way.”
He was filling the first cup when he heard footsteps pounding across the polished tile of the entryway.  “Morning,” he said, looking back over his shoulder.  “There's coffee if you-”
He shook his head.  “He has to know that.  That even if we can’t bring him home, we’ll keep coming to him.  We’ll…  Find him.  No matter what.”
“It’s-” Steve glanced at his watch.  “It’s four thirty, Tony.”
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, trying to ignore the way his pulse was pounding in his ears.  “God damn, but I hate magic,” he gritted out.
"We could trade.  She could pull of my outfit," Steve said, and despite everything, this was easy, this was right.  Or wrong.  He didn't know any more.  He knew what he wanted, but that was one sided, that was just him.  That was his problem.
“Is he all right?”
“No,” Pepper said again, her voice dire.  “No.  The two of you are not allowed to go out alone.  With Steve?  Sure.  With Bruce?  Absolutely.  With Thor or Nat or Clint-”  She stopped.  “Actually no.  Not with Clint.”
“Every time I open my eyes and you're there, next to me, sleeping or reading or scowling at your phone because some vendor got above himself-”
“Stark?”
Peter poked his head into the room.  “We have cookies?”
“Yeah, me, too, but that’s what happens when you cleverly design your menu around supposed aphrodisiacs,” Tony said.  He wrapped an arm around Peter’s shoulder.  “What’s our assignment?”
“Obie,” Tony responded, in the same chiding tone.
“You're going to be using some different muscles,” Jan said, patting him lightly on the chest.  “Let's go.”
“It’s been more than ten years for me,” Steve admitted, not that anyone was paying attention to him.  Jess patted him on the shoulder.  It was more reassuring than it should’ve been.  “They’re not wrong, though.”
“Getting into your work is a sign of an advanced mind,” Jan said.  She took the plate of cookies from DJ, handing them to Bruce.  “Here, Bruce, have a cookie, it’ll be good for your nerves.”
Steve's stomach churned.  “Right.  That's...  What I need to do.”
“Fine. I weep daily. You've ruined me for other men,” Pepper said, utterly deadpan.
Startled, Steve looked up to find Miss Potts and a lovely, statuesque redheaded woman waiting for him at the base of the stairs.  “It was nothing, ma'am,” he said.  He shifted his weight, his cap clasped in front of him in both hands.  “I'm glad we found him.”
And Shuri was sitting at the table, a spoon halfway to her mouth.
Tony gaped at him.  “What?”
“Hush, you,” Tony mouthed at him, and Steve went back to stirring his stewpot, still laughing.  Tony went back to the video. “Steve can't have a cat, just like I can't have a cat, because we work too much.”
Steve shifted his weight, caught between fight and flight, but Bobbi’s gaze was level and steady.  Natasha opened the back door of the car.  “Get in,” she said, her voice flat, and Steve got it.  She shut the door behind him with a very final sounding thud, and he did his best not to flinch.
DJ’s eyes rolled up towards the sky.  “Going!” he said giving the sand a good kick before he started to make his way around the car.  Clint, his hands tucked in his back pockets, followed behind him, shooting them a look from under the hard line of his brows.  He said something to DJ, his voice pitched low, and DJ laughed.
Steve dropped his bag next to the stoop, holding out his hands.  “Want me to take a quick turn?” he asked.
“Right,” Rhodes repeated.  His fingertips tapped against his bicep.  “I’ve got a friend who can be persuaded to pick up an odd job or two, if he’s got the time.  Let me know if you need help.”
Her lips twitched up.  “I wouldn't worry about that,” she said.  “He can't collect.”
“Is someone being murdered in here?” Tony asked, leaning in.  “Because it sounds like someone's being murdered, and I have to object to that, there are rules, and all of you have at least one parent who will notice that you're missing and or dead, so let's not do that.”  He arched an eyebrow at them. “Right?”
"Dummy convinced me that I should not."
Jarvis was silent for a long moment.  “When one is a guest in a household, and one behaves badly, it is not out of the question to think that one might be frightened as to how this might change one’s position.”
“I may have made a mess of things,” he managed, the words breaking with each syllable.  “Jarvis.  I may have…”
“You were so sick,” Obie said.  “So…”  He shook his head.  “And with your heart condition, I spent so many sleepless nights, sitting beside your bed.  Waiting.”  He leaned back in his chair, his napkin crumbled in one hand like a handkerchief.  “I’ve never felt so helpless in my entire life.  I hope you never have to go through what I went through, trying to keep you alive.”
Tony grabbed his helmet.  “What?  Why?”
Once upon a time, there was a boy, who had lost everything, including his home.  Once upon a time, there was a boy who was desperately seeking the truth, and a way to outrun his past.
“Not if I’m doing it right!”
Shuri made a face.  “Actually, we don’t.  Race me?” she asked, wheeling her horse in a quick, tight circle.  Her braids swung behind her in a cresting wave, the silver beads on the ends catching the sunlight.  “The road is straight enough, and-”
Steve clicked his fork against Tony’s, a toast between eaters.  “Happy Valentine’s Day.”
“Can I buy you a new couch for your birthday?”
“And in the morning, I sat Peter down, and I told him.  This is what we’d be doing.  And I was sorry.  I would make it as short as I possibly could, I would get him out as quickly as I could.  But for as long as we were there, where ever they put us, whatever they expected of us, he had one rule.”
He looked up.  “Steve?”
“There.”
“He used it to buy them socks,” Tony said.  “And he hates socks.”
“It’s a confusing concept, to be sure.” Tony grinned, amused despite himself.  “Has he taken a brick to any part of the green house yet?”
“They’re more similar than you might think,” Clint said.  He held up his tray with all the aplomb of a waiter in a French cafe.  “Cocoa, Deej?”
“Because I’m terrified that you’re going to end up with a bullet in your head,” Obie said, blunt about it, and everyone went still.
“You seem...”  She stopped, trying to find the right word.  “Agitated.”  Not quite right, but close enough.
“No, seriously, fuck you all,” Bucky said.  He crossed his arms over his chest.  “Let the royals clutch their pearls, because fuck you in particular.”
"He seldom does," Steve said, the words out of his mouth before he even knew they were there.  Stark's head snapped up, his eyebrows arching, and Steve felt his face heat.  "I mean-"
“I know,” Steve said, his face tipped up towards the sky, catching the last of the raindrops in the palm of his hand.
“Forever,” the man at the counter grumbled.  One blue eye appeared under the shock of blonde hair to glare in Steve’s direction.  “See him out, Tony.”
“Yes,” he said.  “Don’t worry, Peter’s right here, he’s going to stay with you, but I need both hands free, okay?”
“You got married.”
Steve's lips kicked up in a reluctant smile, some of the tension going out of his shoulders.  "You've mentioned that.  Once or twice."
“Just drive,” Tony snapped, yanking the passenger side door shut.  He looked back over his shoulder.  “DJ? What is it?”
Somewhere above them, someone started hammering, the clatter of metal on metal echoing through the great hall.  Steve's head came up.  “Repairs?”
Laughing, Steve pulled his hand back.  “Fine,” he mumbled into his pillow.  “See if I try to check on you  again, you ungrateful ass.”
“I try,” Steve said.  “Phil says we’ve got a visitor.”
Tony kicked his legs out in front of him, his shoulders braced against the wall.  “What was that all about?” he asked, gesturing at the old lady with his spoon.
“Banner,” Steve said, his voice flat.  “The gardener.”
“Shocking,” Tony said.  He was smiling at Steve now, his eyes dark and warm.  “Bucky sorted him out for you.”
“No.  No, I didn’t.”  Stark’s fingers relaxed.  “I did not, and I will not, ever strike my child.  That was never an option.  And despite that-”  His head bobbed in a little nod.  “For a split second, it seemed like the only option I had.  It’s happened before.  It’ll happen again.  And every time, I’m going to have to make that choice.  To be a father in a different way than my father choose.”
