Castiel smiled at Dean from where he knelt, fetching Dean some water.  Dean laid on his stomach, naked as a newborn.  His head was pillowed on his arms.
Sam held up a finger.
“What are you talking about?”
Dean knew he was wearing a stupid smile on his face, but the snort Cas gave him was worth it.  Cas stilled and Dean slowly applied pressure.  He could feel Cas shaking in an effort not to just shove himself back.  Dean appreciated that he didn’t.  Cas was so strong that he may break Dean’s arm.  It was heaven, having his whole hand inside of Cas.  It was so hot inside of him.  Cas let out a legitimate moan.   As soon as Dean moved his hand a little Cas gasped and his muscles clamped down on Dean’s hand.  Jesus it hurt, but in a satisfying way. Dean kept moving as much as he could.  He spread his fingers out as much as he could to simulate a knotting.  Cas finally, finally came.  His cock twitched as he came all over the sheets.  Dean could swear he heard Cas sob.  Cas’s orgasm lasted for a long time, but once it was over. Dean let his hand sit snugly inside of Cas’s omega channel.  A knot would stay in for a long time.  His hand was pretending to be a knot.  The inner walls spasmed deliciously.  Didn’t remember having this type of sex feel so good to him.  His own dick was crying out for attention.  It was trapped painfully in his pants. His dick would have to wait.  Dean was sure that there was a line.  He wasn’t ready to cross it.  He wasn’t convinced that he would ever be ready to cross that line.  Dean guessed that the average knot would go down in about twenty minutes and checked the clock before pulling out.  A pathetic little ‘guh’ slipped out of Cas.  Dean sighed and stretched his hand and wrist.  His joints popped.  Dean had an almost overwhelming urge to lick his hand clean of Cas’s slick and then he wanted to lick up Cas’s come from the sheets.  Dean’s sheets.  Dean clenched his jaw and resisted.  His knot was swollen in his pants.  Cas fell bonelessly to the side.  There was a little bit of cum still shining on his cockhead.  He still held Dean’s other hand.  He rubbed it with his scruffy cheek and kissed the tips of each finger with extremely dry lips.
“So good…”
Cas explained with an unnerving calm that only made sense if you knew him.  Dean rubbed his head in a restless way.
Cas’s brow furrowed.
“You don’t understand.  It cannot be ours.  Nephilim are forbidden.  They have been forbidden since the great flood.  Fallen angels took a liking to the daughters of man and created Nephilim.  Nephilim were giant monsters who terrorized earth.  Between us, they were maybe only as tall as Sam, but humans were much shorter in those times.”
“You wanna elaborate?”
“I gotta go Sam.  I can’t leave him for too long.”
Dean bit down, hard enough to bruise, but controlled himself enough not to break skin.
“The bleeding has stopped…”
Dean grabbed his face and looked him in the eyes.
Cas nodded.  Dean’s mouth was dry.  Cas was stretched out on his back, naked, in Dean’s bed.
“Wait Sam. Can you make extra dinner for Cas tonight?”
He watched Cas genuinely enjoy his food.  Cas moaned happily around the ground meat and gave Dean those big smiling baby blues with his mouth all full.  Dean picked at his own, despite his hunger.  Finally, he stopped trying, resting his head on his hand and watching Cas enjoy the molecular structure of cooked egg and beef.  He had a bit of egg and cheese stuck in the hairs below his lower lip.
Dean had been overjoyed to find Cas in purgatory, giving him a giant hug.  Cas had confided that he had never meant to abandon Dean.  He sincerely thought that the souls of purgatory would want him more than Dean.  He had fled, taking the target off of Dean.  Dean was, however, insistent that Cas accompany him out of purgatory.  He would not leave Cas behind.
“That’s it Cas.  Take what you want.  Shit…  You are so wet for me…  Do you know how fantastic you smell?  You have no idea what you do to me…  Damnit you’re so pretty around my hand like that…  You like that don’t you?  Bet you love being all full…  Seriously you are gorgeous right now…  How do you even smell this good?  I’m so hard right now…  I bet you can smell how hot I am.  That’s for you Cas…  Gonna pop a knot in my jeans because of how good you are…”
Sam was right.  It was taking too long.  Cas had been whimpering and his distress had leaked out into the hall.  Dean had almost gone to him and offered to ease the pain.  Cas had hurt him a lot, but he had done it to help.  Dean didn’t forgive him.  Not by a long shot, but there was a bond there.  He hated to hear the broken sounds of pain and frustration.  He wanted to hold Cas.  He wanted to taste his skin to get that slick in his mouth.  He wanted to push into Cas’s hole and watch his eyes go soft and wide.  He wanted to turn those sounds into pleasure sounds.  Dean locked himself in the shower room and tried to scrub Cas’s dizzying scent off of his skin.  Dean couldn’t help but remember the sight of Cas’s pretty omega cock, wet with precome.  The sweat and slick glistened off of his tanned skin.  His dick, which was half hard from the smell of Cas in heat, perked up at the thought.  He groaned.  Sure, he’d found Cas attractive before.  Jacking off to him felt wrong.  He had done it before while in rut.  Dean had some very well flushed out fantasies of Cas left over from his ruts.
“What?”
Cas whispered into his ear.  He just nodded.  He was working on that.
They all sat in silence for a moment.   Castiel broke the silence.
“I thought you might say that.  I love you too.  Sleep now.  I will watch over you.”
“You never did get over that watching me sleep thing huh?
Cas nibbled his knuckles.
“Move.”
“Well shit Cas…  This smells like a heat.  You ever go into heat?”
“Wise ass.”
Dean ran his hand over his hair, which was sticking up in all directions.
“Cas thinks we should call Crowey.”
Dean snorted.  Jack turned to look at Dean.  He looked so much like Cas that it hurt Sam’s heart.
“I will forgive you again and again and again.”
Jack nodded.  They held the jacket tight around themselves, as if for warmth or comfort.   Jack’s eyes were on their feet.  Their toes wiggled.
Castiel had not consciously noticed that he was gripping Dean’s hand until Dean tried to walk away.  Dean looked back, deadly serious.
“Open the muscles.  We must be running out of time.”
Dean’s mind was a little foggy from the aroused Cas smell and the mouth that was currently having its way with him.
Castiel came once on the toy by burying his nose in Dean’s pillow and scenting it.  Touching himself had been nice, but he had been unable to come without a scent he was connected to.  The alpha pheromone in the toy package smelled fake.  He hated that smell.  He was sure that the heat was to blame, but he hated Sam’s scent as well. Normally, he found Sam’s scent pleasant, friendly, and comforting. The only scent he wanted near him right nor was Dean’s.  He wanted Dean’s scent all over him. When the next wave of heat came, Castiel was unable to achieve orgasm, no matter how carefully he followed Dean’s previous instructions.  It was frustrating and painful. He needed his alpha.
Castiel supposed he should feel something like hurt, but he just felt self loathing.  He had wanted to kill Dean’s child because of the way he was programmed.  Then, he let fear keep Sam and Dean from their new family member.  Tonight, tonight he could have killed the little one.  He could have died and their baby could have died with him.  He felt so selfish that it was hateful.
“Dean…  I did not leave you…”
“Will you tell Dean I’m sorry?”
“Nh…  Cas?”
“It mustn’t be ours.”
“Seriously Cas?  I really don’t care anymore.”
“Fine.”
“Dean…”
Dean palmed his crotch to ease some of the pressure.  He needed to ease Cas’s heat quickly.
“I would, but they’d be unhappy.  No newborn should know that they’re parent died in order for them to live.  They would know, too.  They are extremely intelligent.  We have already learned the english alphabet and I taught them all of our names.”
Sam rolled his eyes.
Cas just looked at him as if he wasn’t sure that he was still seeing Dean.
“It... feels so nice…”
Castiel took Dean’s face in his hands.
Dean felt a little sick at the thought.   He wanted to have sex with Cas, but didn’t want to touch him and dirty him.  He was bad news.  Cas might not even want him.
“GET OUT.”
Cas told him after a moment of just, being in Cas, and holding him like a damn girl.
“Oh…  alright…”
“I need some fresh sheets too. Your arm is gonna stick to those if you let it dry like that.  Cas went without question, allowing Dean to wipe help him sit on the floor and wrap a grey blanket around him.  After changing the sheets, Dean insisted on wiping Cas down.
Cas finally came, his muscles clenched deliciously and Dean groaned.  Cas whispered a stream of praise filled with “yes” and “Dean.”  His come painted Cas’s chest, neck and even his face.  Dean failed to stop himself from licking the come away from Cas’s cheek.  It was bitter, but it hit the spot.  Dean found himself humming and licking Cas clean of his own come.  It was like he couldn’t help it.  When Dean caught himself, he blushed furiously and hid his face in Cas’s shoulder.  He could hear Cas laughing.  It was a nice laugh.  Dean could feel it in his knot. That felt awesome. Cas was laughing at him though.  He was ashamed.
“You guys just disappeared.  Is Cas okay?”
“The sex of our child is male.”
Was really all he managed.
Cas stayed quiet for a moment.  Dean had never seen him quite so relaxed.
“I have to go…”
Sam stared at his laptop without saying anything for a whole two minutes before Dean lost patience.
“God Cas, I need you.  You know I do.”
Castiel asked from his prone position on Dean’s bed.
Dean’s mouth was very dry.  He practically flung his clothes to the side and scrambled in bed with Cas.  He barely managed to get a condom on before Cas was sinking down his cock.  His back was to Dean this time.  Dean watched the tan skin of his back ripple over his muscles.  Cas leaned forward, sighing contentedly as he rocked back and forth.   Cas leaned forward and coaxed Dean’s knees so that they were bent in front of him.  Dean felt a little thrill in his gut as the way Cas was handling his body.  He was using it in order to get what he needed.  Cas grazed the soft under sides of Dean’s knees, making Dean twitch.  Dean could practically feel Cas smirking.  He decided that he would have to do away with that smirk.  Before he could, Cas began to ride him in slow, methodical movements.  Dean’s toes curled and his eyes rolled back.  Cas felt awesome.   Dean gripped Cas by one hip and snaked his arm around to stroke his cock in time.  Dean didn’t do much.  Cas all but houled and thrust forward as well as down.  Dean could feel Cas gripping his knees for leverage.  He watched his Cock disappear inside of Cas over and over again.  It was the best sight.  He would not tire of it.
“So Cas, you had something to tell us, right?”
Dean rotated his hips experimentally.  He had to get this show on the road.  Cas gasped.  Once Dean found the angle that made Cas clutch and moan, he took hold of Cas’s dick.  He wanted this to go as quickly as it could go.  This was pretty good sex and all, but it wouldn’t be worth it if Cas died before they finished.  It didn’t take much for Cas to cum, maybe ninety seconds of pressure from both ends. He reached up and grasped Dean’s branded shoulder.  His grace rejoiced at the miraculous reunion with Dean’s soul.  At the touch of Cas’s grace, Dean came embarrassingly quickly. It took him by complete surprise.  The pure love and joy was too much.  Grace and soul curled and swirled around each other as they pressed love, safety, and family into each other.  Dean laid there in a sweaty, sticky heap on top of Cas for too long. He clutched Cas’s shoulders the way he had earlier, during the ritual.  Cas’s grace had diminished, but it was still all Cas.  The damn thing felt like it was trying to wrap around him.  Dean embraced it, embraced Cas.  He held it close and hoped Cas got the message.  He didn’t want to have to say it.  Not out loud, anyway.  He was having a hard time feeling physical things, but then Cas said his name.
Dean breathed into his ear. He let Cas sniff around for as long as he wanted, all the while insisting that his space was being invaded.  Sam joked that they should get a room and Dean called him names.  Castiel tuned all of this out.  Something was happening to him.  A startling muscle cramp rolled through his abdomen.  His knees were weak. Castiel continued to scent Dean, only twitching when it hurt.  He blinked hard.  He wanted more Dean smell.
Dean was kind of bluffing.  He’d only done this on himself before.  Still, he knew that not right felt like.  Dean’s heart pounded in his chest.  He was breathless.  Cas was stunning.  He had awesome abs and a tattoo that Dean just wanted to lick.  He put that on the list of things he’d do to pleasure Cas. Cas’s cock wasn’t full, but it looked cheerfully interested against his thigh.  Dean squeezed his eyes shut, took a deep breath, and pushed through his anxiety.  He tumbled forward onto the memory foam mattress.
“Crowley isn’t the one who saved my life.”
In the car, Jack felt itchy in the place where their skin had been tattooed.  They picked at the bandaging to find it healed over.  The ink had disappeared.
Dean insisted that Cas remove his clothes, except for a pair of white boxers.  Dean tentatively wrapped an arm around Cas’s shoulders.  He ran just the tips over Cas’s collar bone and back down to his shoulder.  He wasn’t entirely sure what to do.  Lisa had never really been that into cuddling other than after sex.  That's what Dean was good at; post coital snuggling until his partner had had enough.  Cas was just lying there, allowing Dean to touch him without sex in the imediate future.  It felt really weird.  Cas’s skin was nice and soft and warm.  He held his hands palm up and spread his arm.  An invitation.  Dean had not been held like that in years.  He found that he truely, desperately wanted to be held.  Dean shuffled under the blankets, pretending that it was just another night of rest. Once Cas wrapped his strong arms around him, something broke inside of Dean.  He wined nakedly and pressed himself against all of that skin, so that he was snuffling helplessly at Cas’s neck.  Castiel held Dean tightly.  Precious, beloved, Dean.  He stroked Dean’s back until the whimpering stopped.  Dean quivered and his eyes were wet.
Cas pressed his lips against Dean’s forehead.
Smooch.
Cas felt secure under the human weight of Dean.  Dean’s scent was bright, healthy and masculine.  He was extremely aroused,  His breath smelled of Castiel’s release.  Castiel could still taste it inside of his own mouth.  He wanted to remember this scent forever.  Natural lubricant leaked from him as Dean’s hips snapped against his own.  He let out a mournful moan, wanting so badly to know what Dean felt like without that foolish plastic balloon separating the two of them.  Castiel felt that, after everything they had been through together, nothing should come between them.  Dean’s breath was hot against the back of his neck.
“Of course Dean.”
Cas gave him a little smile that managed to look both exasperated and fond.
Castiel may not last that long.  Just this morning, they had all sat together in a nondescript diner.  Dean had favored him with the fondest of gazes and called him handsome. Now, Castiel was baring his teeth and grimacing as his veins blackened.  Castiel locked eyes with Dean.
Why did he keep saying his name like that?  It was really sexy, but Dean was already attached to him and physical intimacy was the last barrier between them.
Something that Jack had said in the Impala made much more sense now.  They’d made this very cryptic comment about how the car was full of memories.  They’d then settled in the seat where Cas liked to sit and just sort of gazed around wistfully.  Sam and Dean had had a very hard time losing their father, but they had been adults.  Jack was a walking, talking infant.  It must be so much harder for them.  Cas had told Jack that he would be right back, that he would protect Jack.  Cas hadn’t come back. Sam tried to explain to Dean that Jack probably needed his father right now, but Dean had shouted him down.
“But it's not and everyone who knows you, sees it.  Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad, you have done for love.”
One second, Castiel was standing in the cold with his pants and belt undone as he bled from the womb. The next second, Dean was screaming and there was a startling, stinging pain in his back. Then he was nothing.
Sam appeared outside of the kitchen where Dean and Castiel were having coffee in the kitchen.
Dean barked out a laugh.
Dean scrambled over to kneel between Cas’s legs, feeling oddly bashful.
Castiel shrugged.
“Dean- Dean.”
“You think we need to…”
“Well, I think biting worked slowing your heat down.  Let's stick to that for now.”
Castiel’s big hands krept under his shirt and instantly began to push it up. Cas never broke eye contact.  Not until he reached Dean’s arms and Dean had to break eye contact himself in order to get naked.  Cas impatiently yanked the tie from his neck as Dean began to fumble with the buttons of his shirt.  He could see Cas’s smooth omega cock peeking out under his shirttails.  Dean pushed the shirt down Cas’s arms.  Cas made that awesome growling noise and practically threw Dean onto the bed.  Dean yelped, then chuckled.  Cas was clearly done with being patient. He rolled Dean’s body around and arranged it just the way he wanted.  Dean felt a little thrill at the way Cas was using his body.  Like it belonged to Cas and Dean needed to get with the program.  Dean found himself with his ass up in the air and his chest on the mattress. Cas smelled fantastic and horny.  Cas rubbed his wet cock over the cleft of Dean’s ass, humming to himself.  Dean twitched.  It felt nice.  His body wanted him to chase the feeling. Then Cas pulled away.  It actually made Dean kind of sad. But then, there was a hot wet roughness swiping over his hole. He gasped.  Cas, you sneaky bastard.  Cas licked Dean’s hole, making that pleased ‘hmm’ing sound.  The vibrations were driving Dean a little crazy.  Cas wasn’t even In him yet.  His hole unfurled and allowed Cas to plunge in.  Dean was beginning to pant hard as he pressed his face down against the matrice.  How did Cas even know how much he liked rimming?  Getting eaten out was such a treat for him.
“Sure they don’t.  I’ll take that as a sign that you haven’t had one before.  Go lay down.  Sam and I will go get you some things that should help.”
Dean didn’t think before he spoke. His voice broke.  He sounded so needy and broken.  It was disgusting.
Good Times Bad Times - Led Zeplin
Jack’s eyes sparkled and their cheeks puffed like a chipmunk as they tore into the treat.
Dean’s eyes flickered to Cas’s hand and arm.  An ugly roping pink scar had replaced  the gaping wound.  Cas still looked tired and pale, but he’d get better now.
“I love you.”
Castiel stood from the table.  Jack had grown quickly.  Cas looked more pregnant that he should, but how would they know?  There was no president for this.  There were no records of any Omega angels giving birth to nephilim.  Cas might not need nine months.  Jack could be ready to be born any day now, for all they knew.
Was really all Dean could manage to say.  Cas looked like he could use a mug of something warm, some comfort food, and a hug, or something.  His urge to nurture was threatening to get the better of him.  Sam cleared his throat loudly.
Dean found himself whispering into Cas’s ear. He dragged his fist over Cas’s cock, enjoying the warmth and weight of it.
Cas showed him that lopsided smile.
“Lucifer could still be out there.  This sounds like something he would do.  Nephilim tend to be conceived when an angel alpha that impregnates an omega.  There have been few exceptions.”
Cas kissed the tears out of Dean’s eyes.
Dean’s voice was completely wrecked.  He cleared his throat.  The corners of Cas’s eyes crinkled as he smiled around Dean’s knot.  He could see the spit shining against Cas’s lips.
“Yeah…”
This time, Dean’s strokes were long and thorough.  He made sure that he drove in hard at the end of each thrust.  Cas made the most delicious grunting sounds when he went in deep like that.  He devoured Cas’s mouth.  Cas wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist, and dissolved into a trembling mess as Dean squeezed and jerked his Cock to the rhythm of his hips. Dean, so overcome with the intensity of the lovemaking, locked his jaw around Cas’s neck before he could stop himself.  Cas tilted his head back.
Dean made a motion with his hand like he wanted Castiel to get on with it.
Sam supplied.  Dean was covering the table with a white length of fabric.  There was something under the sheet.  Sam gulped, knowing who it was.
He squeezed Cas a little closer.  He had almost forgotten how nice being tied to Cas was.  It gave Dean a non-girly excuse to kiss him a bunch and pet his belly and draw patterns on his skin.  The truth of the matter was that Dean was a giant girl who liked to cuddle.  Cas loved holding Dean, but it made Dean feel all weird if he didn’t have a good excuse. Cas seemed to be enjoying the attention.  He kept kissing Dean’s forehead and cheeks, because Cas was a big sap. Dean didn’t want to let go once his knot went down.  He held so tightly onto Cas, that he would have been concerned that he’d hurt him.  Dean squeezed him above the bump, so as not to hurt the conscious person who was growing in there.  Cas broke his hold, only to turn over and press his back against Dean’s front.  Dean pressed his face into Cas’s wild hair.  A tear had leaked out when Cas had broken his hold and Dean was ashamed.  The smell of Cas centered him.
Heat pooled low in Dean’s gut.  It shouldn’t sound as hot as it did, but Cas’s low voice made the words sound sound downright sinful.
“Just…  Um…  Don’t…  You know…”
He took Dean’s hand and pulled his rings off one at a time.  Dean watched his nimble fingers work.
“Oh...”
Dean threw his head back and laughed.
Cas pressed a kiss to his shoulder, causing him to shudder.  God it felt intimate.  What made him feel even more naked was the way Cas washed him.  It also made him feel cared for.
“I’m here.  I’ll be here when you wake up.  Rest.”
“Could have cleaned up while you were sleeping.”
“You wanna elaborate?”
Cas placed a light kiss on his forehead.
“Dean, no!”
When Dean got to Cas’s room and found it empty, his stomach plummeted.
Cas nodded.  His stubble was rough against the skin of Dean’s chest.  Cas was going to give him a friction burn.
Just What I needed - The Cars
Dean murmured his agreement.
Dean confessed as he untied his boots.
“Cas, I don’t cuddle.”
Dean screamed.  He sounded feral.  Dean pulled him to his feet and they took off after Jack.  They didn’t get far.  Sam tackled them, as gently as possible.
“You should eat Dean.  You must be hungry.”
“Our child.”
Dean didn’t think Cas could get any diseases from him.  It was very difficult for male omegas to get pregnant.  Condoms were the final wall between himself and Cas.  Dean wanted that physical barrier up.  If he claimed Cas, knotted him, and came inside of him without protection, they would be mates for real.  The concept filled him with deep unease and a peasant warm comforting feeling all at once.  What if Cas regretted mating with him?  At the same time, he wanted this.  He wanted it so much that it hurt.
“Dean…  you don’t have to let me do this…  Souls are very volatile.  Yours is especially powerful.  It will be painful and invasive.”
“Dean…”
Dean wrinkled his nose.
Castiel mumbled. He was holding Dean’s hand against his rounded abdomen.
“I don’t think the Nephilim is ours, but, hypothetically-”
Castiel hummed.  He sighed as Dean rested a hand on his lower back. His skin was cool and soothing.  He felt the lubricant buble out.  Dean’s fingers teased around his opening, allowing it to loosen.
The two of them were covered in leftover semen, slick, and sweat, so Dean found Cas another dead-old-guy bathrobe.
Cas nodded.
Jack’s eyes sparkled.
Castiel, Dean, and Sam sit down and try to figure out what to name the nephilim.
“Seriously Cas.”
Cas still hadn’t moved, but Dean was trying to clean him up, so he just moved Cas where he needed him.  He even waited patiently while Dean went to get a bowl and some washcloths.
Dean knew what that meant in theory.  This kind of magic came up from time to time.
“Dean I-”
“It's like that…  But slower…”
Dean’s vision blurred as his eyes filled with water.  He wished it away, but it wouldn’t leave.  His tongue was stuck to the roof of his mouth. Cas sighed contentedly and pressed their cheeks together.
“I’ve only got a little experience in the dude department.”
“Dean, how would I know?”
Cas struck him in the face.  The handle of the angel blade left a dull ringing in his ears.
“Would it seriously be so awful?
Castiel happily scented Dean’s neck and behind his ear. Dean didn’t seem to mind.
Dean was making Cas some lunch when his phone went off.  It was Cas.
Cas was silent for a beat.  Dean could hear him breathing laboriously.
“Cas?  You alright man?”
“I mean…  Happy to help..”
“Good thing I’ve got a buddy then.”
“I am still an angel Dean. We should get Sam before his food gets cold.”
“I think Dad got them for me right before we went for my first legal drink…  So twenty one?”
“I hope it's alright…  That I wanted to touch you in your sleep...  It is truly something I have wanted for a long time…”
“He’s our little brother.”
Sam stumbled out and the door slammed on its own.  Dean could hear Cas’s choked cries of what sounded like his name.  Sam shot him another disgusted look and made his way to his room.
His hole was suddenly filled with Cas’s stiff tongue.  It pushed in and stayed there for a moment.  Cas’s breath was hot against his entrance.  Cas pulled almost all the way out and then pushed his tongue in again. Cas was fucking him, but with his mouth… His strong, wet mouth... It was hot as hell...Fuck yes…
Dean pushed the door open wide enough to set down the cooler.  He wanted to hold his nose.  Cas’s scent was incredible and intense and wow.
Dean couldn’t seem to look at Jack.  He busied himself with something else.  Sam was on his own on this one.  Jack looked very solemn for someone who had just been born.
Cas snarked. Dean barked with laughter, even as Sam went silent and Cas pressed his perfect self against Dean’s skin.
Dean asked.
“I do need to know one thing Dean.  Do you want me to stay?”
Dean soothed as he pushed one finger into the first knuckle.  He paused.  Cas’s hipps canted impatiently.  Dean slid in to the second knuckle.  Dean seemed content to stand there and fuck him with one finger.  He added a second one before Cas had a chance to beg.
‘Is that you?’
At the word ‘heat’ Dean purred and planted his nose into Cas’s scent gland.
Hot Blooded - Foreigner
“What’s up Huggybear? Scoot over.”
Castiel was very aware of how Dean felt about family.
“That was…”
“I’m not really a hammer.  I have doubts.”
Jack smiled.  It was wide, gummy, and made him look incredibly young.
“Whoa!  Jack! I’m not gonna hurt you!”
Cas replied flatly.  Dean huffed in annoyance.
Clearly Cas was not cool with being woken up.  He was grumbly and grumpy. At the same time, he was nuzzled and scraped his beard over Dean’s tattoo.  Sam made a really annoying voice, like he knew exactly what was going on.
“Ah, I see…  Hypothetically, if the nephilim were ours, how would you feel.”
I'll Be There For You - Bon Jovi
“Yes?”
“Guys, I’m trying to help.”
Castiel’s brain wasn’t right.  It was slow and foggy.  All of his clothing lay forgotten on the floor of Dean’s bedroom.  His feet had carried him toward the place where Dean’s scent was thickest.  He wanted to spread himself out on Dean’s memory foam mattress and mix his scent in with Dean’s.  Castiel was unable to stop himself. The drive was too physically strong.  He felt so empty.  He wondered if anything could possibly fill him.  He pressed his front down against Dean’s sheets and wined in distress.  The sheets were only cool for a second.  Cas thought he may literally combust.  It was possible.  It had happened before. Where was Dean? Sam? Castiel wanted a knot. He wondered if he smelled nice enough.  Maybe Sam and Dean didn’t like the way he smelled and he would never be full.  Castiel sighed.  He noticed himself rubbing his swollen penis against the sheets.  The satisfaction it brought was minimal at best, but he liked the thought of his fluids marking Dean’s bedding.  His scent would be in them for months.  Something slippery was slowly leaking from his opening as well.  Cas supposed it was meant as a lubricant.  He had not quite come around to the fact that he may be in heat yet.  He was sterile.  He did not have heats.
“You'd die for them?”
“Take what you need.”
“You need to get that thing that Sam gave you.”
“After Rowena’s spell broke and you left with Sam, I had some time to think once I learned I was dying. What would I say to you?  I figured that happiness is in just saying it.  I should give you the option to say it if you return my feelings.  I knew this was unlikely, but I want you to be happy.”
Sam and Dean arrived at the bunker late that night to find it silent. Dean didn’t like it.  Cas had sounded off on the phone.  Of course, he and Sam had been worried about Cas since he’d had to start recovering from Rowena’s spell.  It had only been a couple days, but Cas had sounded downright sick when he’d called.  They found him in his room, wrapped up like an angel burrito in blankets that Sam and Dean had given him.  He clutched an empty mug and squinted at Sam’s laptop like it contained some great cosmic puzzle.  It sent a weird feeling through Dean’s chest, which scared him, so he shoved it away.
Well, he would think of that later. For now, he was just with Claire, and he wanted to enjoy it. He would still go home at noon for lunch instead of eating outside, he didn’t want to leave Dean too much alone.
He stopped here for a short moment, the memory was painful.
“What’s wrong?”
She titled her head and smiled sexily. “So are you coming?”
“I will contact Jo, to know what she got.”
“Some water, please. We finally know, it will be Malory, it seems.”
“It’s okay, you don’t have to panic, I know how to handle that.”
“We were friends back then,” Jo told Dean with enthusiasm, “If someone had told me you would marry Cas’ one day, I wouldn’t have believed it! Where did you two meet?”
He explained her what happened, and went to the moment he had the idea to ‘propose’ Castiel.
“Actually, I knew,” Anna intervened. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell any of you, and that I acted like I had no clue. But Castiel and I agreed that the less people knew, the better.”
“I don’t know if I can go on like this forever.”
“Yeah, I think so too.”
Castiel shivered. What the hell was that? “Why?”
“Why did you notice me? Out of all people in that club?”
“Why would I be disappointed?”
“Thank you, it was really wonderful,” Castiel added as well.
“…We’ll see about it, but well, you won’t need to work that much, you’ll be married to someone rich.”
“Okay, we’ll take both the dress and the suit,” Dean ordered.
Hi! So, I really got time to write and I'm really happy at that chapter!
Dean was looking at him however, torn between anger, hurt, and weirdly enough a sense of understanding. The man had made him think of Sam several times already, but now he made him think of John. His dad and Cas’ would defend their children with the same rage, and Dean could only admire that. Thinking of his father’s protectiveness brought him back to
“Yeah!”
“Ok. Can you watch Claire for me?” He asked the two women.
“Hey! Snap out of it!”
“As you wish.”
In a second, Castiel understood: he had to get rid of those guys, and take Claire away from that City, right now! Those guys were maybe not thugs, but he would deal with them exactly the same way.
“Look, if you don’t want it, that’s fine, I was just suggesting that so it won’t look suspicious.”
Castiel turned to look at her and saw a blond young woman coming toward them with a smile. He frowned, she looked oddly familiar, and he titled his head as she got closer. He didn’t notice the older woman behind her.
“It’s a shame this place is neglected.”
He looked at her belly with a smile. It was true he wished to know his niece, and if Sam could forgive him, he wanted to see him as well. It was pretty incredible: who thought the girl he was so wary of at a time would be the one to help him save himself from his own mistake?
Well, he wasn’t an English teacher for nothing. “…You’re one hell of a nerd, you’ll get along with Sam.”
It made Dean surely uneasy, remembering how stupid and rude he had been with all of them. He especially wanted to talk to Anna. He eventually managed to get close to her.
“You know how to use words, you still have to learn how to hold those back when needed.”
“Alright.”
“That’s one naughty way to break the rules. You should have escalated the wall, Romeo style, while you were at it.”
“And what is it, that thing which made Jessica forgive you? In your past?”
Castiel blinked and felt that he could start to move again. A hand touched his shoulder and he sluggishly sat against the headboard.
“Okay.”
“You…You want something to drink?”
“Okay, we’ll talk about that later. I’ll show you the house and you’ll start moving with me. Tomorrow we’ll officially announce our marriage.”
“What are you doing? I left you the room…”
“There is something I will give you, then.”
“What the hell, didn’t you hear your daughter?”
This made Castiel’s breathing itch, and he felt weirdly nervous. Fiance…Yeah well, it was true, he was engaged to Dean technically. He took Claire in his arms, not wanting her to wander around and put a mess. A small child like her in such a store was like an elephant in a porcelain shop. The man looked at him and his smile was a bit more frigid.
Sam rolled his eyes with a smile and went to the kitchen and put something in the oven before turning it on.
“Considering your interpretation of the Lovers, I guess you didn’t do that just out of strategy, there was something else.”
“For a guy like you, I’m pretty sure we can fasten things up. I bet I can settle that in two weeks, ten days maybe. It would be better for us to settle it soon, while the public has its eyes on you.”
Sam and Dean find where Amara is and Dean is ready, he wants to end her to end the darkness in him. Maybe things could be different, better if he wasn't tied to the dark….. He is ready.
Cas asks how the hunt went and Dean gives him the highlights. Dean asks him what's in the bag? Cas looking embarrassed pulls out one of the items, it was a packaged pie. Dean chuckles at the irony, he was really hungry and pie sounded awesome! Cas also pulled out a plastic fork so Dean was able to begin devouring the pie immediately.
Still looking at the floor but starting to glance up to his TV to navigate to the movie, he sees Cas cross the bed to the right side and while staring straight ahead he feels a surge of every nerve in his body responding to Cas slowly sitting down beside him. The bed was a single so he knew it would be snug, he and Sam had managed to fit comfortably to watch shows before. But with Cas's body being about a half inch from his side, every part of his right side started to tingle and even ache a little, the hairs on his right arm and leg jumped towards Cas.
Castiel's eyes slowly open to look up at him, his blue eyes made even more intense by the blood lining them, Dean feels a wave of relief wash over his entire body. Cas holds the stare and it feels to Dean like a similar sensation to being healed by Cas. The whole body chills of light for this and those moments everything was ok.
No sooner was the mess created, it vanishes.
Dean walks down to the kitchen wearing his robe and a smile, he is refusing to think too much about what was going on between him and Cas. When he stumbles on Sam yelling at an invisible man, he then notices sweet treats and marshmallow covered nachos on the table. Sam was now pinning the invisible man to the wall. The man revealed himself and Dean was annoyed to find out it was Sam's Imaginary friend from childhood here to ask for help on a hunt.
Castifer gets the call and shows up, he offers to take Dean back in time to retrieve the hand of God from the ship transporting it. Dean is eager to get some time alone with Cas, he  jumps at the idea and convinces Sam to stay home from the trip.
While this is going on, Lucifer is trying to convince Sam to be his vessel. The warding around the cage failed and Sam was pulled into the cage where it was revealed that Lucifer was sending the visions to Sam all along.
Dean can barely handle the tingling from the healing and from Cas being so close. It's coming from inside and outside of him and he is having a hard time not being turned on by this.
Dean gives Cas the popcorn and he sits down, Dean shuts the door to the room, walks to his side of the bed, sits down, gestures to Cas to hold the popcorn up a bit Cas does but is now wearing an almost smug look on his face. Dean acts slightly annoyed as he pulls the covers over both of their laps and wiggles for comfort knowingly and purposefully placing his entire right side alongside and touching Cas'.
Cas is confused for a moment, then frustrated by this line of questioning. He puts down the files and walks closer to where Dean stands, ignoring his personal space and with a stern look tells him..
He paces some more waiting for the beep still mind racing, what kind of person should Cas be with, he thinks about him with an angel, a hot angel girl with long brown hair, he hates it and decides nope angels are Dicks. A human, maybe he could find a nice girl for Cas to end up with, he deserves to be loved and happy. Dean would never expect to be in that sort of thing, not anymore, but he wants it for Cas. He begins to picture Cas smiling, laughing with a human chick, her praying to him to summon him to her, the thought has Dean's heart racing out of his chest. He wants that for Cas but can't stand to think about it for even a minute. He actually gets mad thinking about calling Cas but he is too busy being prayed to by someone else.
Dean frustrated claps back..
Meanwhile in the bunker, Lucifer reveals himself to a stunned Sam. During an attack Castiel is able to break through Lucifer long enough to save Sam but he can't kick him out or Dean will be trapped back in time. When Dean is brought back Sam screams to tell him
Dean's eyes now worried, darting between Cas' eyes, and his lips nervously. Cas is just holding position with his chin tilted towards Dean. His expression is gentle but firm. Cas' eyes slowly drift to Dean's lips and that is all Dean can take.
Cas reluctantly down next to Dean,
"Dean"
Cas stops for a moment and turns to shuffle through the bag. Dean is sure he could die from anticipation. Cas is back and begins to coat both of their cocks in lube.
Watching families, people torn apart by what he unleashed, he can't even think about it for a second without spiraling into despair. He feels unclean, broken, he can't think about that right now he needs to help the people he can and fast. Kill first and ask questions later.
Cas smiles and reaches an arm around Dean.  He uses his other hand to gently lift Deans chin again. After a deep stare, Dean hesitantly kisses him. This time is more gentle and soft than before. Dean slowly moves his hand to rub over Cas' muscular back, feeling just the thin T-shirt separating him from skin. Thinking about this, he begins to tighten a grip on Cas' back. Cas has his arm around Dean and is gripping his shoulder, his other hand moves down from Dean's chin to rub his bare chest, then slowly slides around to Dean's back. Cas pulls Dean deeper into the kiss, deeper into him.
"Here sit back down and hold this."
Is this what its like to fuck an angel? Dean wonders. They stay foreheads pressed together breathing each other in. Dean drifts off and wakes up periodically a few times. Each time he is pleased to find he is still wrapped up in Castiel. Finally at around 7 am he wakes and wants a snack. He grabs a shirt, puts a robe on and heads downstairs, still feeling blissful from his experience with Cas.
“She can be shy when she meets strangers.”
“Welcome into my world.”
Don't forget to comment!
“Not only. You did well too, you weren’t in an easy situation, and you handled it greatly.”
Anna and Castiel let her and her new companion spend some times together. He turned to her: “How does that exactly work?”
“He is used to it anyway, and Crowley had no one with him. If he wanted to try something, he would have had bodyguards, at least…Isn’t ?” Charlie added, trying to comfort herself as much as the others.
“I know, I watched the news.”
“Wow…How did you manage?”
She blinked several times, showing she had already heard the name, but couldn’t put her finger on it, and Castiel had to explain her who he was. She seemed stunned to see that man here. “Glad to meet you…You two know each other? I had no idea!”
“Wow! I never thought I would see such a car park before my house!”
“Yeah, same here, I couldn’t believe I didn’t notice anything,” Marc added. Castiel noticed the girl named Charlie lowered her eyes, looking slightly embarrassed. Ah yeah, Dean told him she was the only one who knew. At least someone shared his feelings.
A short silence settled between them, until Jessica broke it.
“Come on, don’t tell me this place isn’t good enough?” Dean’s tone was more teasing than questioning.
Castiel was indeed busy, not only because he had to take care of Claire but because he had some people to see, and he would also have an appointment for his wedding outfit. He had planned to visit Anna, Lexie and Zack, the latters would come of course, even though they weren’t really enthusiastic to see Dean again, as they both told him on the phone, but Castiel still wanted them to come. But first, he would visit Reverend Lowry, not only to reassure him on how and Claire were doing but also because he wanted to ask him something. Right now he was sitting in the old man’s living room, Claire playing around them. The Reverend had prepared some tea and it did feel soothing to be with him
He stopped at the sound of that voice and was stunned to see that Castiel guy here. What the hell?! Why was he even here? Oh he certainly didn’t need to see that fucker right now! Why didn’t he leave already?!
Dean’s voice woke him up and he looked at him with hatred. It was because of him that he was here, he shouldn’t be eating in that stupid restaurant with him, he should have been with his little girl! It was because of him.
“I’ll join him, I guess I left him hanging for too long. Don’t overwork yourself, I don’t want my best tech to vanish.”
Castiel didn’t know why she was dismissed earlier than usual, but it was good for her he guessed. Dean looked once again outside before turning to Castiel who was brushing some dirt away from his pants.
“Really? I noticed the two of you have bruises, Dean told me someone attempted to mug you, is it true?”
“And your father, he never suspected anything?” Asked Dean
She kissed her gently, turned around and greeted Dean and Claire as she passed before them. Castiel approached Jo, with a smile. She looked pretty delighted and amused.
Castiel nodded. “I heard, but I couldn’t answer.” His voice was coarser than usual, and he stood to take his daughter’s hand. They went in the kitchen and Dean watched Castiel prepare her corn flakes and orange juice. “You drink coffee in the morning?”
Dean sat on the couch, extending his arms over it. It had been a busy day, it wouldn’t feel bad to rest a bit. He wouldn’t answer that, after all he wasn’t in the mood for some taunting. He just breathed in deeply, listing what he would have to do tomorrow. It would always help for the next day. Castiel was reading, while Dean turned on TV, they just stayed comfortably silent for a while like that. He eventually turned it off, a bit bored by it and looked at Castiel who was wearing his jeans jacket. One thing came back in his mind.
“Throw it as far as you can!” Dean instructed her as Sasquatch brought the toy back before Jasper could. She threw it, even though it hardly landed far, both dogs tried to grab it, this time Jasper was victorious. She had a huge smile.
With a wicked little smile, Dean trailed his fingers on the couch, close to Cas’, without reaching him, though.
“People always talk. But, I want to tell you that recently, Crowley is apparently eying the technology business a bit more. You refused him as one of your shareholders didn’t sit that well with him.”
“I don’t know if Dean spoke of us to you?” Benny asked Castiel, trying to find something to break the slight awkwardness. “I must say I was blown off when he told me about you. But I can understand why you wanted to hide.”
“Yeah, it kinda helps…You really never had a long-term relationship?”
“Their goal was to demand a ransom, I don’t remember how much they asked, but my dad would have had to sell his company to pay.”
“Yeah.”
“Her family was involved with the mob, but they had angered another mobster, it’s that one who told my father about her. Since they couldn’t get them arrested because they had no concrete proof they wanted to kill him, they decided to do otherwise: they threatened the family and forced them to sell the restaurant they owned, their only asset. Then he warned her and her family to leave the city and never contact us again. It might sound harsh, but…”
“She doesn’t live here?”
“Hey…”
She raised an eyebrow: “Why didn’t you call?”
“Claire is sleeping. She is worn out, happy but worn out.”
“No, but she understood we both did some, so she wants to do the same. Well, why not? We’ll see that when you’ll be older, though,” Cas’ murmured to her, while ruffling her hair.
“Thanks, your Highness.”
Dean took a deep breath, he was obviously nervous: “I apologized to you yesterday, about your father, but well…It’s not all I should apologize for.”
“I told you I didn’t want to be intimate!”
He just went to bed, frustrated. He would usually have what he wanted, but not tonight. That guy should have been dazzled by him, by his home and should have been in his bed already. Instead, he had mocked him.
Now, this was a strange thing to say, Castiel took his hand away, but accepted to swim with Dean who lead him toward rocks. He felt the need to pin Cas’ gently against those and kiss him, in fact, maybe he could do it. It wouldn’t be their first kiss and they were supposed to act as a couple before people. The water hugged their waist, the waves crashing gently against them. He gently pushed him against the closest rock, careful not to hurt him.
“Surely not. I didn’t want to. Why would I?”
He prayed next to the little bed, he prayed God that she would be safe, that nothing would happen to her. He asked for forgiveness for endangering her, for his pride.
“Yeah, I agree. I remember when we went to Egypt, I was eleven and Sam was seven. The pyramids had us amazed.”
“Well…I…I must admit it wasn’t only to piss off my father, I kinda wanted to thank you. For what you did.”
“Where would we go?”
“You knew I would say ‘yes’.”
He was absolutely breathless: after ten years, Jo and Ellen were here before him!
It was still giving him vertigo when he thought about it: Sam was going to be a dad. He had called him three months ago to tell him that Jessica was pregnant, leaving a message, but Dean hadn’t called back immediately. Not that he didn’t want to, on contrary, but out of nervousness. Just like his dad, Dean had rejected Jess, thinking she was interested in their money. Yet when the girl had proved them wrong, Dean had felt guilty.  So he had eventually called back but Sam hadn’t picked up the phone and Dean had left a short message. After that, none of them had tried to contact the other again. He didn’t know why Sam wouldn’t call him again, but Dean didn’t dare, because after what happened, he kinda waited for his little brother to allow him back in his life.
“That place was made for a family. There isn’t any in this house, not anymore,” Dean stated with some bitterness before going back inside.
Anna was now out of question, Dean would think of her, same with Lexie or Zach, Dean knew about them. Who, then? Wait…There was actually one person he trusted enough and didn’t think of yet. Of course! But would he accept? And the place he lived in wasn’t the best of all. Yet for now he had no better solution.
Being a parent wasn’t easy, Castiel knew it from the beginning. Today was one of the days he was reminded of it. Claire started asking why Dean wasn’t around, she wanted him to come with them, and she couldn’t understand why Jess and Sam weren’t here either.  Castiel tried to explain her that they were busy today, she cried at a point, she couldn’t understand why. Claire would rarely pull a tantrum, but when she did, it wasn’t half-way.
“Yeah. You packed along with Claire?”
“Fine,” she replied. “Dean told me you would be here, he drove me so I wouldn’t have to walk.”
He had said that quickly, as if it would have been painful to trail it down. Castiel put a hand on his arm, to encourage him to continue.
This was what truly felt like a punch for Dean. It would have been legit to leave the child with her other parent, the mom, but he would rather have her stay with one of his friends rather than keep her around him?!
“You’re calling me a liar?” His tone was getting darker.
“Good. Now wait for me, I have some stuff to do before we leave.”
Castiel opened his mouth but Anna caught his arm immediately, reminding him to shut up. At this moment, he resented Anna for not letting him defend Lexie. Sure, he wasn’t in love with her, but he liked her, and he didn’t want any guys to disrespect her. He knew she was quite shy, she wouldn’t find the words against this guy. Lexie was pale like she had seen a ghost, and trembling. Harold took her by the arm gently.
“Yeah, just this once, can’t it be possible?” Lexie asked with her doe eyes.
“What happened, then?” Cas’ eventually asked.
“You were right, you know. As much as everything Sammy said hurt, it’s also good he learned about it. It’s weird because it fucking hurt to hear him blame me, but it has that effect, like…Like someone got me, won’t let me derail my own life.”
“Hum, yeah, my friends were also surprised. The two of you met during college, if I’m right?” He asked Ben. “I heard of your names, it’s just your faces I didn’t know.”
“I already like his brother! I’m looking forward to meet him at your wedding. Too bad he is married.”
She still had a gentle tone. “You don’t look angry or shocked.”
The man followed him, and Castiel immediately went in Claire’s room. He hadn’t recognized him, but he knew the name of Dick Roman, and he knew this man was dangerous. He didn’t wake Claire up, but he remained at her side, he would come down only when he would hear him leave. He saw one of the dogs entering the bedroom as well, laying near the bed and he was actually glad of that. He knew the pitbulls loved Claire, and he felt like she had one more protection. Yet he hoped Dean would be fine.
Dean smiled and blushed slightly. He wished it was that. “Well, there is still the little girl, but I guess it will be easier to…Have fun.”
Taking a deep breath, Castiel hoped she would accept. “I came for that. Dean Winchester doesn’t know about her yet, I don’t want him to discover she exists. I need her to stay with someone I trust, and...You’re probably the best choice I have.”
With a nod, Dean was the one who lunged at him this time. He went for a punch and a kick which almost made Castiel fell. Dean threw a hook at him but Castiel blocked it and tried to hit him in the ribs, making him back away.
But before Castiel could do anything, the man had crushed it against the call like crazy. Castiel watched in horror as his cell was now on the ground, completely broken and useless. Hell! And this first he thought of where all the pictures of Claire he didn’t have the time to save elsewhere. Dean chuckled.
“After I kicked you out.  If you want to stay Cas, you'll stay until you’re better! Stay longer if you want. No going hungry for you!”
Cas’s eyes had faded back to blue.  The weird feelings were gone.  What was left was the weight of Cas in his lap.
Dean supposed he was right.
“Yeah Cas.”
“Okay…  How about Hayden?”
Dean sighed heavily.  That was usually easier.  In his experience, omegas in heat came quickly once they knew what to do on their own.
“Humor me.”
“Cas…”
“But usually water is a good start.”
“Damnit Cas.  Move.”
“Have you seen YOU eat Dean?”
“Dude…  We’re mated now.  Of course you're allowed.”
Cas was right.  The heat was building in Dean’s gut.  Cas took such good care of him. Dean made an agreement noise as he sucked a mark into Cas’s skin.  It looked so pretty. Cas should always be marked up like this.  Dean gasped as Cas angled his hips, grasped Dean’s cock, and took it into himself all in one swift motion. Dean rotated his hips languidly as he sucked more bruises into Cas’s hairline.
When his knot finally went down enough, he slipped out.  Cas gasped deliciously.  He was drooling all over himself.  Why did Dean like that so much?  He was about to lean over and grab a tissue for Cas, when Cas pulled him even further up the bed.
Dean squeezed Cas’s hand.  The guilt welled up inside.  Cas was bleeding out now because he saved Dean.  That was sick.
“After the workout you just had?”
“Not Billie.  That’s Death’s name now. How about Charlie?”
Cas had sad eyes again.  It was Dean’s fault again.  He didn’t know how a single self deprecating joke had spiraled into sad eyed Cas making untrue statements like this.  Cas seemed to think they were true.
“I got this.  Just enjoy it.”
“That's how nephilim are typically depicted in classic art.  This is just the human side. We don’t know what kind of brainwashing Cas has had to deal with on his end.  They could be telling him that Nephilim will destroy everything if they are allowed to exist. “
Dean just kind of shrugged and bit into his own burger.  Jack watched Dean carefully.  Castiel had always said that Dean was a perfect example of what it meant to be human.  Dean was their father after all.  They should learn from him.  Dean took a bite of burger, Jack did the same.  Dean twisted his beer open, Jack twisted one open too.
“Hey Cas.  We’re heading back now. Sam’s been trying to call you. You okay?”
Dean awoke to find Cas holding him close.  Dean squeezed his tighter.  He never wanted to leave this bed that smelled like the two of them.  His knot had, thankfully, gone down.  Dean took Cas’s temperature, which made Cas roll his eyes.  He then looked Cas over, as if doing a health check.  Cas was still sporting multiple bite marks from their intense matings, but he felt and looked healthy.  Dean pointed at Cas once he got to the door.
“Forget gender for a second.  What names do you guys like?”
“There are words read in Enochian.  Then you would take part of your soul and place it over my wound.  The ritual needs two more things.”
“Shower?”
Sam sounded a little exasperated.  Dean spoke up.
“You said that we were family Cas.  Well, that goes both ways. We’re going to help you okay?”
Castiel ignored Dean and continued toward Lucifer.  His only goal was to keep the devil away from Jack.  Dean was frantically calling for him.  Sam was shouting.  They fell silent as they faded through the portal.  There stood Lucifer…  Smirking like he had any right. A fresh wave of agony reminded Castiel that he had to act.
“Scent bonding is a myth Cas.”
Sam switched  tabs, letting out a frustrated little huff.
“Dean… What happens now?”
Cas chided.
Dean blinked quickly.  The guilt threatened to overwhelm, but Cas’s scent was so nice and soothing.  Dean whimpered and gulped it in greedily.
“Yeah…I’m impatient for tomorrow, Jo will look gorgeous, I’m sure!”
Today, it was more superficial, a bit colder, the warm atmosphere had been smothered by the glitter. But maybe that could change eventually, and at least they still served wonderful drinks!
“Yes. I am. It doesn’t matter how much we fight, I promise your daughter will never go through the consequences.”
“I warn you, I won’t have it! You disobeyed me long enough! This is the worst sin you pulled out yet, the Lord will strike you! Sinners like you should be burned! As for my grand-daughter there is no way I’m letting her stay with two disgusting…”
He sighed and laid on the bed. Tomorrow would be a difficult day, and yet he wasn’t scared of that, far from it. It was weird because he was energetic; he would have felt like going out usually but not tonight; maybe because the house wasn’t deserted anymore? But he wasn’t feeling sleepy, so he decided to do some work, and after that he would go and look on the net for a place to stay at in California. If he didn’t want to marry right now, at least he would see Sam soon. His brother wasn’t living in Los Angeles, only close to it, in a smaller city. He wanted something near the beach, he remembered Castiel saying he would miss Queens because it was close to the ocean.
He still wondered what his name was.
“Well, your body does something simple while you sleep: it paralyzes you so you won’t reproduce the same moves as in your dreams and it naturally stops when you wake up. But sometimes, even when your mind is awake, even if your eyes are open and you’re aware you’re not sleeping anymore, the paralysis remains.”
At first this made his stomach churn, he didn’t like the idea of Cas’ doing that kind of things with the other guys. But when he thought about it…
The buzz of his phone suddenly interrupted his thoughts, he took it without thinking, persuaded that it was either work, either another congratulation.
He only blocked or dodged his blow, keeping his energy and focusing on his breathing. When he felt like attacking again, he went at it. Blocking another blow from Castiel, he sent his knee in the man’s kidney, not hitting hard, but enough to make him bend over and twisted his arm behind his back. Cas’ yelped in surprise at this, and Dean’s other arm encircled his waist, pinning him furthermore. Feeling Castiel’s back pinned against his front made him feel a wave of warmth.
She was pretty aware this was an excuse to be alone with his brother. She knew Sam and Dean would eventually need to have a private discussion, but there was something weird going on. Whatever, she would talk to him later.
Why try to save him at everyone’s expense if he couldn’t even be saved in the first place? That was the most human and logical choice. She gave a shaky breath: “I tried to convince him, but he said you had defied his name, his family. And he said our school would suffer anyway, but that if you didn’t leave, he would completely destroy it…”
“Every trip has to come to an end. But I would definitely not mind coming back on a regular basis.”
Anna pulled him harshly, making him shut up and stumble along with her. He just laughed and Dean could swear he heard something like: “Rich dudes I swear!” He gritted his teeth and felt a rage which himself couldn’t explain. When he was home, he was still thinking about it. Why? Because that fucker dared to mock him, that was all. Then, he could almost hear Sam’s voice in his head: “
“English. I always liked that.”
“I’ll just take your number, write it on a paper for me, please. I might be able to borrow a phone if anything goes wrong.”
“Sorry! We’re sorry, sir. He is just a bit out of his mind.”
They both drank again, and Dean was starting to feel the need to embrace him again, they were both leaning against the counter, not touching but looking at each other.
“Except for some bad words, I didn’t do anything to her!”
Dean smiled a bit, though he was a bit skeptical. “Considering how I acted with him, I doubt it. Did it ever happen to you? You do something to someone, then feel so awful about it you wonder how you could do that?”
“I have a message for Castiel Novak, I had to deliver it personally.”
“I know, but you must learn to stop over-worrying.”
“Hello, I guess you’re Castiel Novak.”
The child didn’t answer but watched as Dean opened the door and got in. He stilled in the doorframe for a second, his heart missing a beat. Castiel was lying on the bed with his eyes open, and his body completely still. Was he…
“Which means?”
“I would hardly call it a proposal,” Castiel coldly replied.
“If you know me, you already know what I think about it.”
He looked at the sea below and started as Castiel was looking down as well, a way to give him a bit of space so he wouldn’t feel observed like a lab rat.
“I’ll have it refreshed for you. Mrs Tidler probably left already, she is the cleaning lady and also the cook.”
Castiel was silent and he took another gulp before Dean took the bottle for himself. The way Dean was saying that, he didn’t just sound protective but he sounded strong, more than ever.
“It’s difficult to explain. But it’s like this. You must know I love you dearie, I’ll always do everything so you can have what’s best.”
Unwelcome images went through his head, images of a tub filled with reddened water. He bit his lip and stood up, feeling almost crowded and smothered. “I need to shower.”
He honestly had no idea during all those hours whether or not he was doing right, they didn’t stay inside all day, a lot of them went into the garden, in the parts which weren’t set up for the wedding, Claire joined them, and the little girl was praised on how pretty and adorable she was. Cas’ didn’t know whether or not some people said that out of politeness, but he had no doubt some people meant it. His daughter was adorable after all!
Dean was about to answer when noises took his attention. He stared at the house and noticed more and more people were gathering to look at them. “You didn’t want to miss that party?”
was a fighter in an illegal fighting ring?!”
“What?”
“Well, I guess I would have discovered whether you like sweet or rough…” They were so close Dean started to lean for a kiss, but Castiel backed away, his cheeks growing warm. “For now, I think I’d better get to bed now. It’s better if I sleep alone.”
At this, people around went almost silent and Castiel noticed how Dean’s face twitched. Yet the man gathered himself back pretty quickly. “Well, I guess he is. I didn’t have much news recently.”
He got no answer at all, in fact, Cas’ didn’t move at all. This was like an adrenaline shot, he sat up and shook the man at his side, understanding immediately what was going on.
“Damn right, but I’m not an expert when it comes to men’s clothes.”
“Wow, calm down! It was just a nickname for the fights! Whenever he was in the ring, he was always careful of his face, he would always make sure no one could hit it! And that’s…”
“Yeah…”
Castiel lowered his eyes once again but came closer. He had been able to tell Dean off, to threaten him, to remind him he wouldn’t obey, but answering this question was tougher than expected. He gathered all his boldness.
“Why did you sneak away?!”
“Yeah. That’s all I have, except for the couch.”
“We aren’t exactly in that kind of situation. This is supposed to be a friendly spare.”
“You know this almost makes me wish we had a wedding by the ocean too,” Marc told him, “this place is wonderful.”
“Oh yeah! By the way, you know there are some people you’ll have to invite, right?”
“Really? That’s a good idea,” Dean replied genuinely.
The third man was panting and bleeding and looked damn angry. “I should shoot you! You’re glad the boss wants you alive!”
“Very funny. In that case I would rather say ‘the douche who is blackmailing the other into coming here’. At least you seem to have good tastes.” He said that while admiring the view.
He remained like this for a soft moment, thinking of everything that happened, and couldn’t but remember that the back he was pressed had many old scars.
“Her name is Claire, and his is Castiel.”
“Yeah, I am.”
“No, I have no reasons to think so.”
Hope you liked it!
He thought of it. Indeed, it’s not as if anyone could really use that story against him, it wouldn’t be dangerous in Castiel’s hands, and maybe he would understand him better. After all, it could be worse a shot. But it felt like…Like he was baring himself, like he was vulnerable…But if there was one person he could be vulnerable with, it was his husband, right?
A cold feeling crept through him. He didn’t want Castiel to do that or to even think of it! Dean’s expression made him laugh as he realized what kind of misunderstanding just occured.
“Stop being an ass and I’ll consider it.”
“You’re tired,” Cas’ declared. “You should stop now, maybe.”
“Oh, you’re a big girl, now,” the reverend praised kindly. “You know it’s seems like she is growing up so fast, I remember when she was still taking her first steps.”
“Well, I didn’t really lie, we did met in a club and he did fell against my car because he was drunk. It wasn’t two years ago, though.”
“Yeah. And I’m gonna ask the same question: what are you doing here?”
“You didn’t ask. And honestly, would it have changed anything?”
“At a point, I even stopped living with him, Ellen allowed me to sleep at her place, and she would also feed me. I saved some money for my future studies, I knew I wanted to become more than some thug. The reverend pushed me in that way. But when Ellen had to sell her place and leave, I had nowhere to go. I didn’t want to stay with the Reverend, if he had kept a minor with him, he would have been accused of horrible things. And anyway, my father would have searched for me there.”
The big black cat was waiting for his owner inside, laying nonchalantly on the couch. But when he saw Claire running toward him in excitement, he sprinted away like crazy.
“I’d like to start now.”
“You know, there is something we didn’t do yet. I thought it was time to fix that,” Dean declared.
Don't hesitate to comment, a bit more action wil come in the next chapter!
“Now it’s your choice: marriage or misery.”
He looked at those, thought over it and rubbed his face. He really wasn’t sure at first, but as Jess said, there was no bad interpretation.
“I won’t tell you, no way.”
“He told me about what you two decided. I don’t know what got through you, but as long as you don’t hurt him, it’s the most important. He told me you’re getting through therapy?”
He felt quite weird calling him like that, to think this was indeed the man he would marry. Even that bruise on his jaw couldn’t waste his beauty. Yet he didn’t like it.
“Well, let’s say, we didn’t want to attract much attention,” Dean simply explained, looking fondly at Castiel. The latest blushed and decided it was better to get over it.
It was also weird for him, he had the impression to be in the center of a storm now, and he didn’t how he should feel about it. Maybe he needed a good night of sleep? When he went to bed, he found the bedroom empty. At first, he was quite glad to have all the space for him, but after some minutes in the darkness, he started to feel the too heavy silence in the room. Though he hadn’t been really enthusiast when he suggested Dean to share the same room, he had to admit having a presence near him felt good. He let some minutes pass in silence, and felt tempted to go and join Dean, but he decided against it. It was a good thing to leave him alone, to sort things out and show him he was on Sam’s side.
He stopped as he saw Dean went to talk to a man standing next a boat. They spoke a bit and the man gave Dean keys.
“Well, you could have changed your mind, and decided you would have preferred something grandiose,” Dean clarified. “What about you, kiddo, you like it?” Asked he to Claire.
“After your father died. I know the two of you didn’t talk much at his burial. Maybe you should fix that.”
“Let’s say that most of times my experience with rich people wasn’t pleasant. The rich students we had already, well…Let’s say their parents thought they were above everything. For example, I remember the first time I punished one of those students for not making her homework. Her parents came and acted as if I had punished their daughter for nothing and threatened Anna like crazy. In the end she had to yield. I hated that, I mean how am I supposed to teach if the parents will not allow me to bring discipline?”
Before you write it in the comments, I don’t think Charlie would do something like that, it was out of character, but I wanted to explain why she wouldn’t judge Dean too harshly.
“Do you need help?” Dean asked
He spent more time he wished with Marc but made the effort, not that he disliked him, but he was really distracted. It was the first time it happened, usually, when he and Marc would discuss business around a drink, he enjoyed it, nothing would come to distract him like that. His employee left him as soon as they were done, sensing his boss wouldn’t get in a better mood. Dean went through the dance floor but couldn’t find him anymore. Damn! If only they had got the occasion to talk, he would have been able to impress and make him wait nicely! Hell, it had been a long time since he had desired someone that much and it had to be the one slipping away from him!
“I told you! And I told you he was handsome!” That was Mrs Simmons, she was at a window, smiling carelessly. Castiel and Dean approached and Cas’ had this little satisfied smile: “Guys, this is my future husband, Dean Winchester.”
“I was just going to embrace you, no more.”
Obviously Castiel was still sleeping, he was breathing normally, and his body was completely relaxed against his. It wasn’t the first time he had someone in bed, but he would rarely hug them. It was like the time he had held him, but this time there was no tension at all. H found himself wishing this would happen more often, when Castiel would be sleeping or awake.
That was certainly not a question he expected, in fact a lot of things were really unexpected. Was he trying to buy him? He just shrugged, there were probably tons of things he could have asked for, but he didn’t know what and right now he didn’t want anything but be left in peace with his child. He eventually found an answer.
“And your mother?”
He could see Castiel had started to pack and he felt a bit reassured and weirdly thrilled about this. It could end up in a disaster and he knew it, but he was weirdly happy to know those two would come and live with him.
The melancholy in those last words was breath-taking. The song stopped there, and Castiel stayed at his daughter’s side, watching as she closed her eyes, and shifted to sleep. Then, after a short moment, Dean saw Castiel joining his hands and pray, murmuring so softly he couldn’t hear, and even the child couldn’t hear.
“It’s not as if I was gonna take advantage of it to coerce him in my bed, you know! And he could benefit from it, really. And if he eventually wants us to divorce, we will, we just have to keep it going for sometimes, after that he can leave.”
“Stop bargaining with me!”
“So, you think I shouldn’t have defended my friends?”
“Nope, it won’t be. You will also have to get your ass away from that city. I don’t ever want to see your face again.”
“By having you as my shrink?”
“Mostly by name. I used to fight in Crowley’s arena, so I heard rumors about him. What did he want?”
“Is there a problem?”
“Oh come on, not that one!” Someone protested.
“He did. But I wouldn’t hesitate to defy him anymore. He beat me even more, gave me the belt harder, he even called for some friends once to ‘help him’ when I defended myself. But I wouldn’t take it nicely anymore.”
“I was surprised to hear you talk about your girl. You don’t intend to hide her anymore? So you…”
“You don’t want Claire to see you with bruises, am I right?”
“Yes, I do know about it, your wife probably knows more than I do, but I know it, and I know the victims tends to take their captor’s side…It’s not my case, I don’t excuse what your brother did. I think I could forgive him one day, but he still has to make up to me. He wronged me, I won’t ever justify what he did.”
“What do you mean?”
“There are some things we’ll have to talk about. You didn’t tell me everything.”
When he thought about it, he had never shown anyone his scars willingly. Some people had noticed those eventually, but he had never purposefully showed them. He almost stopped as if he had just realized that: Dean Winchester was the first person with whom he had done that. Why? Because he had felt guilty for kissing him just to defy his father?
“Well…Here it is…”
“That’s flattering then,” Jessica concluded, giggling a bit.
All of sudden, Dean leaned toward him and Castile thought for a second he was going to kiss him but the man backed away with a teasing smile and Castiel huffed in relief and amusement; people around though this was just a lovers teasing. Then Dean took him by the hand and drew him closer again, Castiel allowed him to do so, he was feeling safe in spite of everything. They continued to dance, eyes locked, their pride stopping them from looking away.
“What happened?”
“You know, it’s something I never did before: cooking with my boyfriend or girlfriend.”
Winchester&co
Before Castiel could ask anything, Dean pulled himself away, stood up and stormed out of the room, giving Castiel a hateful glare. He left the man here, lying limply on the bed. The man remained here, staring at the ceiling, when he heard his daughter waking up.
“Yeah, you can cut the onions, I thought we could have risotto tonight.”
“Don’t touch me, you disgusting pig!”
At his dismay, Dean realized that laying at Castiel’s side like that would have its hard side as well.
He stopped there, and Jess gently encouraged him: “Do you want to talk about her? I know your dad took both you and Sam to a shrink after what happened.”
This time, Jonathan looked truly scared and he left, stumbling slightly. Dean just closed the door and turned to Castiel who was standing still, his expression cold and hard. Before Dean could reach him, he went back inside. Without caring whether or not he wanted to be alone, Dean followed his future husband. Castiel went toward his bedroom and closed the door but the other opened before he could lock it. Rolling his eyes, he went to the window and stared outside, refusing to look at Dean. He watched the dark-haired man, wondering what was going through his mind. He had that stone-like face, but he was pale and shaking slightly. Dean gently put his hand on his shoulder, but Castiel swatted his hand away.
“What?!”
“Why not?”
“Good morning,” he breathed out, knowing he had to be polite.
“Not us,” Kevin said about Marc and himself. “And I actually met Dean because he had briefly dated a model I worked with. Funny when you think about it, he dumped th girl but kept the agent as a friend! And I introduced Marc to him when he searched for a new advertising agent.”
“…Shut up,” he growled with embarrassment, making Castiel even more satisfied and amused.
“Well, when we slept at your house you weren’t that cooperative…”
“What do you think? I don’t like homophobes, I already told you that, and I didn’t like the way he spoke to you. I don’t like people who beat up children too, and I clearly understood he was that kind of person. I also didn’t like him threatening to take your daughter.”
Suddenly turning to him, Cas’ pushed his future husband hard against the wall. Before Dean could understand, register that his head hurt, his man suddenly crashed his lips against his.
“You’re okay?” Jess asked before Dean could.
It made Castiel huff. He didn’t stay for too long after that, his next visit was to Anna. She listened with attention when he told her what happened in California, and was pretty satisfied when he told her what happened once Sam discovered.
Oh God, how was he supposed to speak about it? But just looking in Castiel’s eyes, he knew he had understood. In fact, he had to go to the end of the story, leaving him in the dark at that point would do more bad than good.
Cas’ took another gulp of alcohol and wondered if it wasn’t starting to get to him. He had never held alcohol so well, which was funny considering he had worked in a bar. Maybe it was what made him speak out.
Without a word, Castiel left, and a nagging sensation crept through Dean. People would usually obey him, from anyone else, he would have been confident that his orders would be obeyed. But with his stubborn fiance, he couldn’t tell.
He tried to sound brave but the fear was obvious. He was scared for his own life of course, and yet his first thought was this: what would happen to Claire? Would Trish even stay for the rest of the night? He imagined his daughter being placed in some foster care, where she would hardly be fed and taken care of, he imagined her cry for him…For a second he considered begging. Dean didn’t know the real reasons why he was afraid but he was enjoying it, a dark kind of joy he knew was wrong, a part of him was ashamed but it was enjoyable to bring an enemy down.
“Then what?” Asked he.
“But…”
“If Claire wasn’t sleeping, I would have suggested you to go down the road and to the beach to swim. But well…”
“We take the doggies?”
“No, but it helps thinking. You see, each cards have a signification, but if you read several books or ask several people about it, you’ll see they never give you the exact same meaning. So it’s quite open to interpretation; When I draw cards, let’s say, I ask myself whether or not I want to try to have my own cabinet, I can draw the cards and depending on what I have under my eyes, it can help me consider what the dangers are, why it would be good. It doesn’t give me the future, but it clear out my own pros and cons, the dilemmas.”
Indeed, that’s something he hadn’t thought about. She wouldn’t be safe around her grandfather for sure, so if he couldn’t get her a safe second home, well, he would have to be extremely careful. He was between a rock and a hard place.
“Not-crowded places? New York is a weird choice as a place to live, then.”
Dean didn’t say more. Somehow, he wanted his future husband to ask, but the question never came. Was he afraid of that? He remembered that way he danced in the club, and felt a sting. Would have things been different if he had been able to talk to him sooner?
There weren’t many things which could make Dean tremble in nervousness. He had dealt with Wall Street sharks and mobsters and none of them had ever made him tremble. But here he was trembling as he looked around for his little brother. He spotted him quite easily, Sam was taller than most people.
Castiel frowned: “You already got me unemployed, isn’t that enough?”
“I did.”
“That’s why he didn’t last long,” Castiel answered.
A short silence followed and then Dean remembered something he noticed: “You worked in the garden again, I saw.”
“You handled yourself with the reporters, though.”
“You regret Central Park for our wedding, don’t tell me you regret the groom,” he mumbled, turning his head away. Marc knew perfectly well it was only in order to hide a smile. His husband was just fishing for a love declaration, he knew it and there was no reason to deny him that. Marc took him by the hand to draw him closer.
“I didn’t have much time to really visit yet. But I will.”
It came out before he could realize it, Castiel couldn’t help himself: “Did I cause your car any damages? I wasn’t aware I could actually break cars with my shoulder!”
He didn’t speak of it anymore, and neither did Dean. “You won’t go to work?”
“You have no right to come here!”
Though she was pouting, the kid did come out of the house and once again, Dean wondered what the hell he would do with the girl around. Once again, Castiel took her in his arms and Dean told him to get in his car and ordered his driver to get the child’s seat from Castiel’s car into his own.
“I don’t, be reassured.” As if he cared about his damn money, he wasn’t some whore!
Dean smiled tightly at those words, and looked at the woman who pronounced them. Some would say Bela Talbot had class, some would be entranced by her beauty, but to Dean, she was just some politician’s daughter who was really cliché whenever she was trying to seduce someone. In fact, she was pretty much the femme fatale cliché all the time, taking people just for money and power, thinking herself extremely smart when her overconfidence made her commit a lot of mistakes in the past. Dean knew what she wanted: she was just trying to get a rich guy, but she had no feelings for him. Maybe she was attracted to his body, and considered it as bonus.
That was Dean’s first question that morning. Castiel was preparing breakfast for the three of them, Claire was waiting for it eagerly while playing on the carpet with her toys. He had seen Dean was depressed when he came to join the in the living room. At the tone of his voice, he could hear how worried he was.
He had wanted to go to that guy, but not only he had just left when approached, he also had the nerve to mock him! But now, maybe he was indeed just a drunk man. Maybe he hadn’t even noticed Dean in the club, it was a hazard that he left when he arrived.
Death agrees to fix the problem, but only if Dean kills Sam. With an impulsive swipe of the Scythe  Dean makes the heart choice and kills Death.
"I am going to let you rest Dean!"
Cas respectfully declines and Sam shrugs and heads off to bed, leaving Cas and Dean at the table. Dean is a little annoyed by Sam's offer,  can't Sam see that Dean needs to be the one to be there for Cas? Dean catches himself in this thought and just shakes his head and lets out a small laugh.
Dean reminds himself that he and Cas are friends. He hates that Cas has just been gone this whole time. Dean knows that it's his fault, he was starting to push Cas away, and Cas went.
Annoyed Dean says "Cas, the movie... Of course you haven't, well we are watching it tonight!"
Dean hurried up to get a towel around himself, he was still hard from thoughts about the library, in fact he could have came when Cass called his name if he wasn't so startled.
As soon as Sam says that Dean is hurled across the room by Castifer. His heart hurts and the pit in his stomach about the news is so severe that he can barely feel the effects on his body from being thrown.
"Do you wanna start the wire?"
"Dean you ARE strong, these feelings come from a place of STRENGTH. If you didn't feel you wouldn't be Dean Winchester and I wouldn't have chosen to fall from grace for you, to SAVE the world. It WILL work out, I know it. I have faith... Faith in you"
Just as he is thinking all of these thoughts a strong hand crosses his chest and grabs his shoulder firmly. It's Cas and he is making eye contact with Dean. The hand feels like a warm comfort, that Dean doesn't feel he deserves. He should be on another planet wasting away. At least then the world could be safe, he feels so selfish.
Lost and broken from the day he sits and stares off of the dilapidated dock. The only way he can think about this without shutting down, is what he tells Sam. They are going to find Lucifer, trap him and save Cas.
"Cas you wanna watch more movies tonight?"
Once Sam leaves it gets quiet for a minute Dean busies himself to make a sandwich still covered in evidence of battle from the hunt. He glances over at Cas and feels warm comfort, he thinks of what it felt like to wake up on him, then his stomach churns as he remembers Cas scooting away.
Dean can move away a bit now and prepare popcorn. He could not stay in that barricade with him above and Dean below the blanket. He needs some control back, when he returns he can put some space between them, so that angel static doesn't mess with him. He tells Cas to wait where he is and heads to the kitchen.
"So maybe you should get some rest."
What happens next is a blur the mark burns as it comes off his arm, was this Death? Did Cas, Crowley and Rowina pull it off? "Now that is an interesting team up" he thinks to himself. Before he can begin to think about the consequences of his choice, the darkness erupts around him, Sam, and the impala.
He goes for it. Eager but gently he presses his lips against Cas'. Cas pulls back for a second to see the confirmation in Dean's eyes. Dean is a little shaken when Cas pulls away, but then before he can think, Cas shoves them both against the filing cabinet similar to the Pizza Man but kinder. Cas kisses Dean sweetly waiting for Dean's tongue to enter his mouth before he reciprocates.
Cas needed to heal and for Dean that means it was time to watch movies. There are 4 furnished and accessible bedrooms in the bunker, there are a few others but they were filled with clutter from hunts and their dad's storage. One of the open rooms that had been Kevin's just never felt right to be in since he died. One was Sam's, One was Deans, and One was the generic guest bed.
He starts with his right arm reaching for the clock he turns his entire body to face Cas, his chest now touching Cas's arm, his junk now firmly against Cas' leg, his face only inches from Cas', he makes direct eye contact with Cas as he fumbles for the button on the alarm. Their eyes locked in closeness Dean looks to Cas' lips, for a second then back to getting lost in his eyes, this is it, he is so fucking close, Cas seems perfectly content with no objections.
Cas runs into Amara and watches her kill another angel. She blasts Castiel to Dean with a message after painfully carving it into his chest. She then doubles over weakened.
Cas looks over to him, head cooked to the side and says
"You shouldn't have bitched out!" as if he was speaking to himself the words burned him and he could see they hurt Cas. Cas, exasperated took off to go research about Gaza in the bunker files.
"Woah! Where are you going?"
Dean hands Cas the pile.
He wants to be with Cas.
While these thoughts cross his mind Castiel is looking at Dean's wounds and begins to apologize "Dean there aren't words", Dean can't believe that the angel wants to apologize to him, after the beating that Dean gave Cas when he had the mark. Dean refutes the apology immediately and makes sure he knows he was not to blame.
This has been my first fic, I plan to continue it eventually but will need to do a serious combing through of the episodes after these. So it may come up eventually, if not I hope you enjoyed my head cannon so far. Let me know in the comments if you want me to keep going!
"You are not mad at me Dean, you are mad at yourself. I want to help you, but you don't want to be helped, so you push me away."
Cas fumbles with the bag and moves it to the side. "I made some other purchases for myself"
Dean finds a case at a nursing home near the bunker and it turns out to be a Banshee. Being close to the bunker is convenient because Dean needs to go home for a gold blade. He heads back to the bunker and finds, who he belives to be Cas, tearing up one of the file rooms.
Dean tells Cas and Sam that Cas is staying in the bunker until he gets better, Dean may not be able to save everyone or take back the things he has done but he will take care of his friend now.
"That's not Cas!"
Cas' words wash over him like a wave of relief, he feels suddenly calm. He is not sure how Cas does it. His voice feels like a familiar song that comforts Dean. He can move on for a moment to let his mind wander, he can't help but wonder what else is in that bag?
Dean, still pissed off, prepares himself a drink, and then a second, and then a third...
Dean's voice breaks as he chokes on his words Cas removes his coat, and jacket. Dean is upset, but this pleases him. Cas rolls up his sleeves and sits on the side of Dean. He puts a firm hand on Dean's bare shoulder and says...
He had heard enough, Knowing it probably wouldn't work but needing to try, he thrusts a knife into her, but it disintegrates on impact. She grabs Deans face and he is sure she is going to suck out his soul, she kisses him instead. The last person he had kissed was Cas. Dean is feeling it is a point he needed to prove to himself, he kisses back.
"Yes"
"The town?"
For the others it didn't really mater but for this Chapter I would highly recommend watching at least the Dean/Castifer scenes and the last 5 minutes of Season 11 episode 11 after or before reading. It was one of the main motivations to tell this story. I hope you are enjoying what I belive to have really happened on the show. Love you guys more to come soon!
Sam calls and he needs help on the case. Dean heads back and still feels off about his talk with Cas.
Dean and Sam's rooms had the best TV's he offered to Cas that he could bring his TV into one of those rooms for Cas to sleep in, but Cas being the angel that he is didn't want them to go without. Sam overhears this and says
When confronted Castifer tells him that he is trying to find a way to stop Amara. Dean is put off by Cas, nothing about him feels normal right now. Castifer says that he "had Amara in his sights" and that "he couldn't take her out." Dean, surprised and scared that Cas had gotten near her, is now worried for his safety.  He puts his doubts aside and talks with Castifer about Amara.
Dean wakes about 5 hours later, he walks the halls of the bunker and sees Sam praying and he has to call him out on it! He follows Sam to the command table where he sees a table full of research. Cas must have stayed up all night and went through every archive to find information about Gaza. Which Dean isn't sure how to feel about. Before he has time to think about the library, and the things that happened there, he is surprised to get a call from Donna. She needs help! Dean quickly gets a visual on Cas, he is reading from an old manuscript in the guest room. Dean briefly and awkwardly lets him know about the case that he and Sam are going to go work and leaves it at that.
He thinks he will test the waters
Dean in the middle of the kitchen, pulled the popcorn out of the microwave his whole body feeling shook thinking about it.
"So?"
They save the people, hunt the things and even do a little match making. On their way home Sam talks to Dean about the visions he has been having about the cage. This terrifies Dean at his core to even talk about. Lucifer is like a guarantee he will lose his brother, he can't think about it, he can't even consider it. He shuts Sam down as soon as he can and they make their way back to the bunker.
Dean asks "What about Cas?" Expecting Sam to say something so he doesn't have to go to this house, Dean doesn't really want to leave, but he can't just lay in bed with Cas all day, even though for a moment the thought does please him…
A few days pass and he doesn't hear from Cas. Dean wonders, what he is doing? Where is he? And why had he left.. Then he thinks back to the hallway and going to bed alone. He is now pretty sure that Cas is just giving him space. He justifies that after some time apart they can just go back to best friends Dean and Cas, without the extra curricular activities. This frustrates and saddens him, but pushes it down to look for a hunt. He is sure that keeping busy will fix the way he feels.
Much of it is a recap looking at what I would argue is definitive proof that something was going on in the scenes we don't see..
He points to the Zeppelin shirt and shorts that he wore before, now neatly folded on a table in the room.
"should we be eating popcorn? Isn't that what people do during movie nights? "
"Oh yeah I would like to stay here and cry on him all day while he watches' ' Dean shakes out the thought and agrees to go.
Cas ponders all Dean has said and nods his head and looks to the TV to see what Dean has planned. Dean hasn't thought that far ahead, he knew he wanted Cas in his bed, he knew he wanted to be close with him. These thoughts have him too distracted to choose a movie. Finally after flipping through Netflix a bit he asks Cas.
Thank you for reading.
Confused, frustrated and terrified Dean sits next to Cas on the bed with his bowl of popcorn.Sitting upright and stiff Dean keeps a good distance between them. Cas staring intently at the Wire on Netflix, he has made it to about the 3rd episode, Dean has seen it all and is having trouble focusing on it. Instead Dean's mind races….
The thought makes him mad again and he darts his head to look at Cas, Cas Slowly moves his head to look at Dean. Dean started with an annoyed expression at the scenario he made up in his own mind, then saw Cas and his face immediately softened, they were close maybe 5 inches away, Dean couldn't help but look down from Cas' eyes to his lips, then back to his eyes. Cas smiles a little and holds Dean's stare just long enough that Dean is sure they are going to kiss, and Dean is ready, scared, excited and still thinks he will pull away. Dean considers initiating and pauses again thinking Cas may not think of him that way.. Just then Cas' smile fades he says
They save the people and hunt the things at the Lizzie Borden house, when they get a lead on Amara. Sam suggests they call Cas to bring him off the bench, Dean hates this, he wants Cas to rest but he reluctantly agrees. Talking to Cas he can hear that he is now watching trash TV.  Dean jokes with him about it and he responds
"Hey Cas do you need anything? I think I wanna go check with Sam and wash Baby"
Realizing the mark of Cain has pushed him too far, Dean sees flashes of Castiel's battered face, he thinks "how could I do that to him, all he wanted to do was help me, Cas teamed up with Sam and Charlie because he cares. He is always sticking his neck out for me and that's what he gets? Why am I such a dick?"
Dean stops thinking, and blurts out..
Dean doesn't know this but the ship was warded against Castifer. Dean tries to find Cas but ends up completing the mission on his own. The mission was the opposite of time alone with Cas, he had to meet several people he knew were going to die. It hurt he felt powerless. He wishes he could confide in Cas about it.
Dean hates the feeling of him walking away, and is determined to enjoy his company while he can.
______________________________________
It feels cold and hollow. He feels like he is sliding into the darkness. For a moment he remembers the light that he feels with Cas and it helps him to pull away. She goes on to talk about their connection. Dean hates this, its connection to dark, he doesn't want it.
Cas is not amused, and seems a little embarrassed. Dean is nervous, but for other reasons. All he is wearing are shorts and Cas is on his bed. They have porn and lube.. Dean feels like may start freaking out, before he can spiral Cas gets up to grab his coat. He says he is going to go in another room for a while. He places the items back in the bag and begins to take them with him on his way out the door.
"You're drunk" He begins to pull away.
"Yes, you're in for it now." Dean says delighted.
She says she wants to bring bliss to the world, and that it's the bliss that Dean feels when he is around her, but that's not what Dean feels, she acts as an amplified mirror to his inner darkness. Dean waits as she goes on about how she wants to become God.
Without skipping a beat Sam tells Dean that Cas is on season 2 of the wire. Sam must have checked in on Cas while Dean was getting coffee or in the bathroom. Dean couldn't argue, what was he gonna say,
Rowena began to speak the words to reverse the spell on Castiel. He stops, she finishes and he collapses to the ground convulsing. Dean does not trust Rowena, and Cas looks like he is in bad shape. Dean finds himself wishing he was still being struck by Cas. Anything is better than watching his best friend shake on the ground he feels so bad that he let this happen. Cas is here because he was trying to save Dean, he thinks back to the first time Castiel looked right through him. "you don't think you deserve to be saved" with a head tilt and a stare the angel read him on impact and yet Cas has always tried to save him.
"Man! Just come back here, let's watch something."
Looking straight ahead to the movie now, Dean is not entirely sure why all of his nerves feel so electric. He is about a half inch from Cas and feels his body begging to be a little closer. Shoving the thought out of his mind he focuses on the movie, how cool would it be if he got to wear cowboy hats with Cas? He will get it now having seen this! Dean gets excited and looks over to see Cas' reaction to the movie so far.
"It's fine Dean"
They are able to save her and hunt the thing. On the way out Mildred tells him she knows when someone is pining for someone else and that he should follow his heart.
The hunt was a milk run, Warepires, that turned out to be ghoulpires and they talk to Cas on the phone while they are gone at least 4 times. The first time he calls, Sam suggests Cas go in his room and watch netflix. This is a relief to Dean, having an angel laying in your bed and watching your TV is totally normal, though if he is being honest with himself sorta hopes Cas will stay in his bed..
Dean feels wrong doing it, but if they really are going to push past this and be friends, then he should be honest. He tells Castifer that he is attracted to Amara. Saying it to him hurts Dean more than it appears to hurt Cas. Dean goes on to say that it scares him and he is not sure if he can stop it. Expecting a different reaction, Dean is surprised when Castifer puts a cold hard hand on his shoulder and tells him this could be a good thing.
Dean catches himself looking at Cas instead of the TV. He thinks Cas looks really good, than he shakes his head quickly to add to his thought "For someone that has died a bunch." Forcing his gaze back to the TV, his peripheral is picking up a bent angel in bright blue boxers.
Thinking of when he beat Cas to a pulp, how much of a relief each blow from Cas felt when Cas was under a spell. Why he's so angry. Now he is just mad at himself for letting the darkness out. Thinking of all of the people that have died, and recently because he wanted to be rid of that stupid mark, he is mad at Cas and Sam for prioritizing him over the freaking world. He is so angry.
"Hey you guys, I'm pretty beat, I can crash in another room. Cas, you can sleep in my room and watch my TV if you want.".
Dean is really excited to show Cas this movie and he can't remember the last time he had true downtime with his best friend. Because of the limited TVs in the bunker, Sam and Dean have sat on the same bed before to binge watch game of thrones. So why did having Cas sitting in his bed make him nervous now? Is it because Dean is still convinced if Cas sees him too closely he will see his darkness? He thinks that must be it, and shrugs it off.
Sam and Dean do what they can to save the people in the town, closest to where the darkness arose, he flashes back to Amara telling him that they are bound, and he winces at the thought, she is bound to the things inside of him that he wishes he could wash clean of, the things he wishes he was not.
Dean opens the generic plastic thankyou bag to find Busty Asian beauties, lube and tissues.
He wants Cas in his bed, he wants to feel his warmth and light. He wants to watch more movies with him wearing his shirt. The thought of never doing it again actually hurts him..
He grabs his head, this isn't going away.
He has no idea what to do.
Cas changes as Dean watches. When he finishes he stands near the bed. Dean gives him the look to join him already, and lifts the blanket. Cas moves under the blanket and as close to the edge of the bed as he can. Dean throws on a cowboy movie he has already seen and scoots closer to Cas. He moves until his entire body is pressed against him.
"Cas I don't need personal space from you."
This takes place between 11-8 and 11-10.  This will not be as fluffy, but it is nessisary.
Cas seems to not be affected by Dean sitting with him like this. Dean keeps thinking of the ways he would have to draw the line in the sand if Cas wanted to progress things, and now Dean just feels like a dick, planning ways to stop something he started? he thought, now he is just upset, who said closeness is only for couples, his skin needed this, his body craved affection, human touch, and closeness. He is starting to feel foolish, he got his hopes up that Cas wanted to be closer to him. He will just have to accept one day Cas will be on earth with a wife, and Dean will just be an old hunter in need of some healing that Cas may or may not come to give him.
Dean now wrapped in a towel using another to dry his head steps toward Cas, seeing him now brings a smile to his face. He grabs some shorts and returns to the bathroom to put them on. Dean goes and sits on his side of the bed. Cas tentatively sits on the other side.
"Uh huh" Dean doesn't buy it, he lounges for the bag. Cas is displeased but doesn't do much to stop it.
Dean's face drops when Sam says that Lucifer touched him and he felt calm. That's the same effect Cas has on him… He hates hearing that Sam is feeling that with Lucifer. Was this angel power? Maybe that's why he felt so physically drawn to Cas? Sam goes on to describe the burning bush and plead his case. Dean still hates it but does agree to go talk with Crowley about it.
Sam and Dean are unaware that Cas said yes, and as the three of them walk towards the Impala Dean checks to make sure that Cas is alright. Castifer tells Dean that he will be and that he is going to catch up. Dean has had a hell of a day and can't dwell on it, but this annoys him.
Sam is at the table nerding out about a Lizzie Borden's house that has had murders lately. Dean, annoyed , realizes that Sam just wants to go because he is a serial killer dork. Dean is surprised that Sam hasn't said anything about Cas… in his bed...
Sam and Dean deal with the direct impact of the darkness's destruction, going through the motions to try to correct what he broke. Another flash and he is with the darkness, he feels a connection to her, like she is linked with the darkness inside him, it feels like killing her would be killing his own darkness and right now it feels like that may be all he has inside him.
11-14 -11- 15 Dean is ready to have a serious talk with Cas about his feelings for him, but unfortunately he finds out that Cas is not Cas.
Cas said.  He looked tired.  His under eyes were puffy and he was pale.
“I guess I can work with that.”
“Dean.”
Dean has been on super heavy Rut suppressants that John gave him since he was about 21. Now that he's mated to Cas, his body changes its mind. It could have asked him first. Good thing Dean has Cas to help him. Hopefully Dean doesn't say or do anything embarrassing and girly. You know, Hormones.
It was so like Dean to spoil Castiel’s moment of tenderness.  Cas pushed back and looked him in the eye.  The nephilim’s soul/grace pulsed at Castiel’s sweet joy.
“Cas?”
“And you haven’t helped him…”
“Cas…  Between you and me…  When dad was hunting and I was on my own, I spent the four years Sam was in college helping omegas who were in heat. It was honest work.  It paid well.  I got to help people.  They didn’t have an alpha or couldn’t take suppressants. Those who called an Alpha service needed help to get through their heats.  The only help they had was an Alpha for hire. I’m pretty sure I’m an expert on heats.  You're in heat.”
Castiel bared his teeth and brandished his angel blade.  Lucifer was advancing on Castiel.  Perhaps he had not thought this through.  Protecting his family had been his first priority, but on further inspection, Castiel was injured and Lucifer was an Archangel.  Castiel knew his strength and speed.  He had to get back to his child, to his family.  Castiel waited until he knew the portal would close in mere seconds before fading through clumsily.  Sam and Dean were standing there, just out of reach.  Dean sighed and let his muscles relax a little when they made eye contact.   Castiel couldn’t help but smile a little.
“Father?”
Dean placed both hands atop Castiel’s shoulders.  Castiel looked into his eyes one more time, silently pleading with him to back out.  When Dean didn’t so much as flinch, Castiel squeezed his shoulder with one hand.  He closed his eyes, thankful for the darkness.  His bleeding grace ached for the soul that was in front of it.  It knew where to go.  He allowed it to direct his hand, pushing through Dean’s body as carefully as possible.  He felt Dean’s head fall against his shoulder.  Dean hid his face in Castiel’s neck and he made a small sound.  Castiel’s grace rejoiced at the reunion with Dean’s soul.  It flicked it with tendrils aand swirled around it in weak spirals.  Dean was breathing hard against his neck.
Cas was looking at him with those baby blues. Dean felt vulnerable, even though Cas was the one opening up.
Cas seems annoyed now..
"Cas you should be wherever you are comfortable I just want you to rest up."
Dean hated telling Cas about his draw to Amara. He also hated Cas' reaction. He wonders what he would have hoped for, and is embarrassed to realize he was hoping for Cas to be jealous. It has been almost a week since they were in bed together. No girl has lingered in his thoughts like this after a hookup.
He wakes up alone, his bed feels empty but he just pushes past the thought. He finds Sam in the kitchen, who tells him Cas left this morning after going on a walk with him. This freaks Dean out. He tries pouring a drink to help calm his nerves. Sipping the drink he wonders where Cas went, what they could have talked about? Dean wasn't being exactly careful to hide what was going on from Sam, and he certainly wasn't ready to deal with any of it. In his mind he is still very straight, and Cas is just tolerating his human weakness.
Cas interrupts Deans internal crisis, with his head cooked he asked
He is embarrassed about what happened but Cas seems unaffected. Just the angelic duties of a best friend? A shoulder to cry on.... That's it these mixed feelings about Cas are all just a need to vent out this hurt, its therapy and Cas is a good friend. Dean also figures he just needs to get laid soon, that explains why he stabbed his angel in the leg, it all makes sense now. He continues to watch the show with Cas, making small talk. Cas doesn't bring anything up, he is a good friend.
"Dean, you know I always enjoy our time together."
Morning is here and he wakes up feeling a weight has been lifted, the darkness is still inside him, but Cas sees it, is still here for him. He believes they can get rid of it, that's enough to put Dean in a good mood. He looks over to Cas, he seems content still watching TV Dean pats him on the leg as a friendly thank you and heads to check on Sam.
In a damp abandoned warehouse he hears what sounds like a disoriented Cas, approaching a screaming woman, "Not today!" he thinks.  Cas would rather be hurt, that hurt someone, and Dean is not going to let that happen. He runs to follow the sounds, and he sees Cas with blood rimmed eyes strangling a woman. "Cas Stop!" Dean remembers when Cas was trying to stop him, what Dean did to him, how he thrust the angel blade next to Cas because even with the mark he can't kill his friend.
This interpretation gets even more indisputable in the next chapter. I can't tell you how many notes were taken to make sure that this can slide effortlessly into the story.
Dean considers helping him to unbutton his dress shirt but he was having trouble not getting lost in his eyes. He feels like that would certainly be too close. Dean sits on the bed centered but to the left side a little. He finds the controller and begins flipping through to find Tombstone, Cas is in front of the bed and to the left, he has taken his shirt off and began to remove his pants.
At the Bunker Dean tries to find Cas, he is not there, Dean starts to worry but calls his cell. Cas answers and lets him know he will be back shortly, Dean tells him he wants to see him when he gets back...
Dean falls asleep.
Cas touches his forehead.
In this chapter a weakened Cas needs to heal, Dean shows him one of his favorite movies in his room in the bunker. Still a slow burn, but thank you for reading.
Dean brings Cas to his feet, one hand stays holding his head to look at him until he is standing and then Dean cups his face with his other hand not breaking eye contact. It's almost like Dean thinks as long as Castiel eyes meet his, he will feel good, light, warm, he will feel okay.
Dean collects himself and realizes that he gave Cass his usual lounge shorts, so he goes for that back of the closet look.
Cas has been thinking about this since Dean first told him Sam wanted to talk with Lucifer, he would rather take this burden than have Sam do it. Sam was his friend, and more importantly if anything were to happen to Sam, Dean's darkness may overcome him. Castiel says
But first coffee.
They sit watching, Dean still wanting to be closer, but not sure how, every part of him that is touching Cas feels warm, tingling, he wants more, and is not sure how to get it. Looking over to the nightstand on the other side he spots it, his ticket to getting just a little closer, the alarm, he will reach over Cas to turn it off. Dean still can't organize his feelings, he pushes so many things down and tries not to think of his motivation.
"I am freaking happy man, I know we need a plan to fight the darkness, but right now you me and Sam, safe in the bunker, together, this makes me happy."
Sam and Dean wash Baby. Dean lets Sam know how restless he feels without exact details. Dean suggests to Sam that they go out on a hunt, if he can just hunt he will forget about the angel in his shirt and in his bed.
Sam told Dean that he had asked Cas to talk with him about Lucifer and after talking, Cas went off on his own. Sam goes on to tell Dean about his visions. Dean hates this and is sure that it is all bullshit he was already in a bad mood and this is just passing him off.
"Dean you look happy"
Dean dreams of the darkness and light, of cold and warm, of Amara and Cas. They seem to battle for space in his dream, they both fade but it's bright and he is warm. Before he opens his eyes he feels true comfort. He wakes up on Castiel's chest, face pressed against his own Zeppelin shirt, he looks up to see Cas simply allowing it while flipping through the choices on Netflix.
Dean feels heavy with guilt about Charlie and Cas, and every other godforsaken thing he cares about.
Dean finally accepts that he wants Cas close, he is not Gay, but for Cas he thinks getting close feels right, he still likes girls, but he is delighted to think of an ending where he and Cas are best friends, and sit close and have eachother. Before he can dwell on that thought Cas has finished healing him and returns to sit at the table.
Dean is pissed and huffs out of the room and heads to his room. In his room he looks over to his bed, to where the angel was holding him just last night. Still drunk he falls into bed. He starts replaying the kiss in his mind and before he can stop his hand wanders down the his still hard parts and he relieves himself. Even after the relief he was frustrated, he was upset that Cas stopped him. That he didn't want him to.. Did Cas not want to regret something? Is it because he is no more into dudes than Dean is? Is it because he knows how broken Dean is? All of these thoughts swirl around to taunt Dean. He eventually remembers, he was not the only one to get hard by the kiss, this thought gave him some solace and he was able to get some rest.
With that Cas scoots replacing the distance between them. Dean gives up and focuses on the movie, Castiel is not into him after all. They talk about other shows, and movies, Dean rattles off a list of things Cas needs to see, including the wire.
Castiel stops convulsing, Dean just wants to save him, any way that he can, he is powerless. Hoping with everything inside of him that Rowena wasn't screwing them, that he would be ok. Dean reaches for Castiel's face. He looks lifeless, Dean's heart drops in his stomach he shakes Cas' body then gently scoops his head cupping Cas' cheek into his hand. A moment of true despair washes over Dean, "Cas!"
He doesn't think of Cas that way, and Cas may not think of anyone that way, or atleast Dean hopes that's the case. At least this way they can be alone, but together when Sam inevitably pairs off with someone.
Cas looks at Dean, sort of confused, but does it.
"Cas what else is in the bag?"
Dean can tell Cas is comfortable and happy this makes Dean happy. His favorite angel that has been trying to save him now looks content, he deserves this.. Dean noticeably smiles at Cas and nods his way to show he is excited. Dean also unintentionally lets Cas know he looks good with an accidental raise of his eyebrows. This only widens Cas' smile, working in a feedback loop Dean feels he should try to break this spell or they won't stop.
Sam comes up with a plan, they need a powerful weapon, a hand of God, Dean cracks a beer in the morning and listens to Sam's nerdy research. At some point it dawns on him, this is the perfect reason to call Cas! He has wanted to for days but he was worried, he hated that about where they were left things, but this is the perfect excuse. If they just had some time alone maybe Dean could talk to him, fix whatever he needed to fix to get Cas back in the bunker, back with him.
Cas is here holding him and telling him it's okay to feel weak, this was a first, and what a relief. Why would Cas do this for him, why was Cas still around fighting and dying for Dean, he felt he didn't deserve this, but Cas said that he did. Cas thinks he deserves this, Cas who has seen every bad ugly part of Dean has stuck around.
After some prompting from Sam he remembers meeting the darkness, he remembers she saved him, was he supposed to be grateful?
“He speaks english…”
Dean attached himself to Cas’s neck.  Sam coughed, smelling embarrassed.
Dean spoke as if he was just realizing that he was okay with Cas’s sleep fettish.
“Wanna taste it…”
Dean’s voice was thick with saliva and precum.  He liked that it was Cas’s precum.  He liked that he got to do this for Cas.  Dean sucked Cas’s cock back into his mouth and moaned.  He allowed it to go a little further into his mouth this time.  His tongue ran over and over it restlessly.  Then, Cas finally tilted his hips in response.  Cas ran his hands over Dean’s face in a caress that made Dean’s heart hurt.  Cas’s thumb swiped over the corners of his eyes.  His palms rested at Dean’s jaw.  One hand ran its nails over Dean’s scalp. The pad of his index finger traced the shell of Dean’s ear. One of Cas’s soft palms pressed under Dean’s chin.  It made Dean want to take him deeper.  He opened his throat, focussing on nothing but the weight of the cock in his throat and the warmth of Cas’s body and pressed forward.  Cas whispered broken encouragements.  He told Dean that he was amazing and beautiful, that Dean’s body was skilled and that this was the most wonderful feeling. and -
Castiel paused.
He lapped at a drop of cum on Castiel’s sternum.
When they got to the shower room, Cas made to go to a different shower.  Dean pulled Cas in with him.  Cas went without protest.  He reached up to touch Dean’s chest, but hesitated.  His eyes were all big and hopeful and sad.  Dean pulled him in under the hot water.  He wanted to kiss that look off his face.  There was a beat where Cas was limp, then he pulled Dean forward and hugged his around the shoulders.  The water made it hard to breath. Dean broke away gasping.
“Bad sore, or like dull ache?”
Dean prayed to Cas later that same day to come home.
Castiel felt so dry inside, no matter how much natural lubricant his body pumped out.
“Sam, Isn’t it true that human male omegas sometimes try to get pregnant for years?  Isn’t it the case that some try repeatedly, but never end up carrying to term?  It would be so unfair if I were to get pregnant on the first try, wouldn't it?”
Dean was seeing Cas everywhere.  They weren’t in purgatory any more and Cas was missing, but Dean could see him.  He drank too much and slept lightly, waiting for the purgatory monsters to come for him again.  Then, Cas had shown up for real.  Then he was finished getting cleaned up, Cas had asked, how do I look?  Dean remembered that his dick had told him that Cas looked awesome.  He smelled nice too.
Cas patted the space beside him on the bed.  Up until now, Dean had been kneeling behind him.  Cas seemed to need him closer.  After trying and failing to get the hand Cas was holding free, Dean sat down awkwardly beside Cas’s legs. He didn’t pull out.  He knew Cas needed to be full too.
Cas told him with an even voice.
Sam laughed at him.
“If you ever change your mind, just ask, okay?”
Again, Cas patted his chest.  Dean didn’t so much sit as kneel.  He had some idea of what Cas was planning.  He was correct.  Once he was settled, Cas took his hips and pulled him down toward his face.  Dean gasped and braised himself against the wall.  The warm, soft slickness of Cas’s mouth slowly enveloped Dean’s alpha cock.  Cas pulled him forward by the ass cheeks, forcing Dean to impale Cas’s face with his dick.  Dean trembled steadily. He shut his eyes tight and just let the feeling of Cas’s mouth wash over him. Cas pulled forward until he was fully sheathed.  His throat fluttered gently around the head.  Then Cas’s throat worked and he swallowed hard. God, he had no gag reflex. Dean’s hips moved in minut, restless thrusts inside of Cas’s mouth and throat.  It was so good.  He wasn’t going to last.  Dean tried to pull back, but Cas made a humming sound and locked Dean’s legs in place with his biceps.  One of his hands wandered from Dean’s cheek and his finger slid into Dean’s ass easily.  Dean made a wounded sound.  Cas’s thick finger slid inside easily, using his own slick and cum as lube.  The smell was something else.  It smelled like Cas’s orgasm, his slick, his cum, his contentment, and Dean’s arousal.  Cas smelled like he could just lie there and let Dean fuck his throat all night.  He seemed pleased.
“It's alright Dean.  I’ve got you.”
Dean’s mouth twisted as if he just took a shot of cheap tequila with no lime and he shook his head.
Dean could feel his face heat up.  A massage of the omega’s channel, along with some alpha pheromones and an orgasm usually did the trick.  That meant talking about sex with Cas.
“I think sex is going to have to be off the table after all.  Don’t come into my room and don’t do anything creepy while I’m sleeping.  Got it?”
Sweet Emotion - Aerosmith
“I’m alright Dean.”
Cas made an even more insistand whining and arched his back.  Dean picked up speed, happy to see that Cas was enjoying himself.
Dean cracked open a bottle of water.
“Dean, I may simply hold you.  Please do not go to bed every night thinking that you might have to deal with sexual touching in the middle of the night.  If you do not want that, tell me, or pray if you can't.”
“If you apologize to me I swear…”
He heard Cas rustling around.
“I think the ritual isn’t finished.”
“It is a very angelic way of expressing deep devotion. I have to paraphrase.  The enochian used is ancient and does not translate to english well. It goes something like this;
Cas let out a breathless chuckle.  It was a good sound.
“Hello Dean.”
Cas snapped.
Let me know if I misgender Jack.
“Your mouth your mouth Dean…  Your mouth...  I’m…  I think…”
“Have you been looking up a way to help Cas or what?”
Sam sat back down just as Cas’s eyes returned to normal.
“I am kinda hungry.  Let's get something to eat.”
Cas let out a long suffering sigh and rolled onto his side.  He took the pills from Dean and drained the rest of his first water bottle in one gulp.  His adam’s apple glistened as it bobbed up and down.  Dean gulped again.
"Dean, you gave me what I needed most.  I want to do the same for you.”
“I’m hanging up.”
He muttered, patting his chest.
Cas was breathless.
Dean understood.  He turned them to the side.
“I need you… You're family...”
“It's angel radio!  There are so many voices!”
Dean shook his head, but Cas held firm.  Cas’s eyes were red rimmed, and there were tears in them.
Cas’s scent was stale here.  He had not been here today.  He had not been here in a while actually.  Cas’s scent led him to a partially open door.  Dean’s door.  The scent coming out of his room made him want to find the source and lick it all over.  In his heated mind, Cas had chosen his room as a nest.  Dean bit his lip.  In ancient times, an omega in heat would choose an alpha mate by waiting in their den.  The scent would draw the alpha in.  If they smelled good to each other, it meant that the two were chemically compatible and they would mate.  There were cases where alphas had sent omega’s away and the omegas had to wander from den to den to find an alpha to take them.  This system was dangerous.  Sometimes, Omegas would be left outside overnight because nobody found their scent appealing.  These Omegas were often hospitalized for injuries inflicted during a public and unwanted claiming.  Sometimes they would be found in the morgue after being raped and left to die.  Times for Omegas were much better now.  They didn’t need to be claimed if they didn’t want to.  Heat suppressant and birth control prescriptions were available as well as gland clogging deodorants and lots of different kinds of condoms. There was pressure by society to be claimed and have children, but modern omegas did not have to.
Cas silenced him with a bruising kiss.
“Cas.”
“My room?”
Dean had very mixed feelings about Cas having any kind of reproductive... anything.  He had liked Cas in a special way for a long time.  Still, Dean had believed that, if Cas would be anything, it would be a Beta or even an Alpha like Sam and himself. Angel Cas was a Steryl Unpresented.  All of the angels he ran into seemed to be Sterile Unpresented.  Something about Cas still did it for him.  Dean tried and failed not to think of how good looking he was.  How nice he smelled.  Cas smelled like the woods after a light rain when everything was waking up and there isn’t a wendigo after you.  Cas smelled like coffee too.  There was something else in there.  Dean didn’t think about it much.  He just kind of figured it was an angel smell.  It was close to how star jasmine smells, but that wasn’t right. That smell had become spicier in the moments Dean got back to the bunker.  Cas had looked so dreamy with his sex hair, big pupils, and flushed cheeks that Dean had really wanted to nip his neck.  Not a mating bite or anything.  He had just really wanted to taste his skin.  Dean really did not want to have to think about the way Cas would taste right now.  He was pumping out all of those pheromones designed to get an alpha excited.  The smell alone had tested Dean’s will a little.  He wasn’t an asshole.  He could control himself.  It was Cas.  Cas smelled good to Dean every day.  Right now, Dean kept having to look at and smell Sam to make his chubby go down.  His dick did not like Sam.
Castiel hugged him.  Just held him and enjoyed his warmth.
Just as soon as Dean pulled the trigger, Jack let out a sound that Sam could not hear.  He could not hear it, but he could feel the way Jack screamed.  The sound physically pushed himself and Dean back and up into the air.  Sam could see the nephilim’s power radiating off of them like heat waves.  Jack’s face was twisted into something frightening.  Sam and Dean hit the floor, hard.  Sam has to collect himself.  He moved through the pain.  His eyes were shut tight as he moved to get up.  Sam heard the patter of Jack’s bear feet as he ran.
Cas was tight, but the muscles stretched easily.
Jack missed Castiel.  They missed his heartbeat, the light of his grace, the way he was always speaking to Jack.   Castiel spoke to them in their head and out loud too.  Castiel used to say that it was important that Jack learn to listen with their human ears as well as their mind.  He explained that Dean and Sam weren’t used to communicating using their minds the way that Jack and Castiel did.  Jack would have to speak using their mouth.  Castiel had answered as many of Jack’s questions as he could.  He sometimes Castiel didn’t know, but he would try to find out.  Jack loved Sam and Dean, but they did not understand their complicated and nuanced emotions.  They loved Dean because he made Castiel happy and Jack loved Castiel.  Jack loved Sam because they could tell that Sam made an effort to bond with them.  Sam was doing all of the things that Castiel had told Jack Dean would do when they came out.  Dean hated Jack.  That much was clear to them.  Dean couldn’t look at them for very long.  His thoughts were always full of pain, anxiety, and Castiel when Jack was in the room.  Jack wanted Dean to love them.  Dean loved Castiel.   Castiel loved Jack.  Jack loved Dean.  Why didn’t Dean love Jack?  It was very hard to understand.  It made Jack’s head hurt.  They sat at the desk in Castiel’s room, missing him and listening to Sam and Dean arguing.  Jack remembered a time when Sam, Dean and Castiel had sat together in the kitchen, eating meals that Dean prepared with care and laughing about nothing in particular.  Castiel would occasionally take Dean’s hand and play with the rings on his fingers.  Jack asked him what they were.  Castiel told them that one of the rings belonged to Dean’s father, who had died.  The other belonged to his mother, who had also died. Jack asked if their family would die.  Castiel told them that all humans died eventually, he hoped that Dean and Sam would live for a long time.  Castiel told them that he didn’t know how long anyone would live.  It made Jack sad that humans died.  It made Jack sad that angels died too. It smelled like Castiel had spent many days in it.  Jack searched the underground bunker until they found a blanket in Dean’s room that smelled like Castiel.  It was grey and soft.  They wrapped themselves in it and clutched it, comforted by the familiar scent.  Castiel’s scent was all they had known for months. Living without him now made Jack feel very complicated emotions.  They rubbed their wings together, uneasy.  They just really wanted Castiel.  Perhaps what they were feeling was simple.  Jack did not know.  They wished they could just ask Castiel.  Castiel had always had some kind of answer.
Dean’s voice sounded like an alpha growl in his own ears.  It was doing it for Cas, who sighed and pushed back against his hand. Cas nodded quickly.  Dean could see the strain and knew that three just wasn’t cutting it any more.  Cas hadn’t asked for anything up until now.  It was so like cas to take what he was given and ask for so little.  Cas made a little sound, which he tried to muffle.  It was an unhappy mule that didn’t fool Dean.
Dean found Sam in the library, making a bitch face over his laptop and a book.  Sam wrinkled his nose even more as Dean approached.
“So are we doing this?”
“You’ll be trapped…  You're an angel too…”
Dean didn’t want to talk about it.  He was honestly embarrassed by how he’d behaved.
“Cas.”
“Drink your water.”
Dean pulled back enough for Cas to cum into his mouth.  He came so much that Dean couldn’t swallow all of it at once and it spilled over his chin.  Dean’s eyes watered and his throat was so sore, but it was so worth it.  Cas hauled him up by the armpits and kissed him hard. Cas licked the cum from Dean’s chin and claimed his mouth.  Dean melted.  This was nice.  He wanted to keep doing this forever.
Dean stroked his belly, trying to connect.
Cas growled.
“Other angels will feel the location of the portal.  They will come for Jack.”
His first night in the Men of Letters bunker, Jack discovered that they only needed one nap at night.  They knew that humans slept more than two hours because Castiel used to watch over Dean at night sometimes.  Dean slept anywhere from four to six hours.  The memories that Jack had of those nights were tinted rosie with Castiel’s unconditional love for the human.
Cas paused.  Dean licked his dry lips.
No.  Dean wasn’t really worth all of that pain.  Cas shouldn’t for him.
Dean clenched his hand into a fist to keep from touching his own cock, which was currently tenting his jeans.
Dean took his elbow and Sam’s eyes grew wide with concern.
“A long time ago, a ritual caused my grace to bleed profusely.  The old injury seems to have opened up. The attack dog spell may be the cause. It tore at my grace until I obeyed.”
He muttered.
Dean took a deep breath.
“Come with me?”
“I told you, Angelic thinking on gender is not the same as human thinking.  I myself only answer to male pronouns because I got used to it.  Most of my vessels have been male.”
“Hi.”
Dean’s instinct in this situation was to get out of it…  He was tied to Cas and hadn’t asked if Cas could heal if he pulled his knot out.   Even if he could, Dean didn’t want to hurt his hole, especially not while he was pregnant like this.
“Dean doesn’t like to talk.”
Then he was kissing Cas, really letting himself relax.  He really wanted to just feel Cas.  Cas had been so close to death.  Dean wanted his weight.  He wanted to feel that vibrating purr Cas let out when he was pleased. Dean wanted to feel Cas so deep, that Dean would be reminded that he was alive for days.  Dean had never done this, but he had thought about it.  He hadn’t been able to trust someone enough to allow himself to be that vulnerable.  He allowed Cas to use his weight to push them into a lying down position.  Cas could easily just hold him down like this.  It wouldn’t be any effort.  Dean imagined that lean, muscled body between his thighs and whined.  Cas drew back.
“That isn’t specified.”
“Your scent…  ”
Cas gazed upon him with such fondness, that he had to look away.  Dean was such a coward.  He thought that maybe he had grown a pair.  Dean thought maybe he would be able to say it.  Someone had best repo his balls.  He didn’t deserve them.
“I’ll take care of this case.  I’m not done with research anyway.”
They sat side by side atop Dean’s mattress.  They said nothing, simply maintaining eye contact.
“Sam.  Cas went into a heat. He hasn’t had one before.”
“Do you mind?”
That was not what happened.  Dean ended up all needy, licking Cas’s torso clean of cum like they were mated and Dean was grooming him.  Then he’d kissed Cas full on the lips with a mouth full of cum.  Cas, the kinky bastard, seemed happy to swap cum with him. Dean then crawled right on down to Cas’s wet, pink hole and greedily licked it open before fucking Cas with his tonge.  Dean stroked Cas’s cock and thrust his tongue up inside of him until Cas came.  The thing about that whole exchange was that Cas had not been sick or begging.  Dean had simply thought that Cas smelled real good and wanted him.  Cas had looked all doe eyed and inviting. Cas was all warm and pliant.  Dean had wanted to touch him, so he did.  Cas was in heat and a little omega channel massage with the tongue never hurt. It didn’t really matter that it did nothing for a really bad heat like this. Dean didn’t think anything of it until much later.  Once he had cleaned Cas of cum (he may or may not have licked it up) and gotten him to drink more water, Dean left for a moment in order to call Sam.  Dean needed something quick to eat, but did not want to take the time to go find Sam. The closeness in Cas’s bouts of heat concerned him.  He knew that Cas would use the fake knot if he had to, but didn’t imagine that Cas would want it after he had had a real knot. Still, Dean needed to let Sam know about Cas’s theory and see if Sam had been doing any of his own research.
“How about Logan?”
Sam could actually hear Cas’s use of quotation marks.
Sam shook his head again.  He sighed, as if he were in a room full of idiots.
Dean pressed his eyes into Cas’s neck  so that he didn’t have to show Cas he was ready to cry.  Cas had seen the worst of him, and yet, he still made Dean feel naked.  He scented Cas, allowing himself to be centered.  Cas purred continuously, first gently, then instantly in Dean’s ear.  The kiss was chaste, sincere, and sweet.  Cas held his gaze.
“Mrh?”
I didn't give this much time in the first bit, so i'm adding a very short chapter.  I wanted something light and fluffy before all hell breaks lose in the next part.
On their third day on Earth, Sam and Dean took them to a tattoo parlour with a fake ID for an anti-possession tattoo.
Cas issued the order in a fucked out voice. He pulled the blankets up to their chins and kissed Dean’s forehead.  Dean shook his head.  He wasn’t done.  Dean sleepily crawled under the blankets and licked the cum from Cas’s cock, his thighs, his balls, his belly...  He liked having Cas’s cock in his mouth.  It was soft and small, but nice.  He could hear Cas making little noises up there. Good.  Dean crawled back up to his pillow only to have Cas kiss him with a very wet mouth.  He tasted like slick and their come and sex and Cas.  Dean licked Cas’s chin clean before he sighed and pulled him close.  He wanted to be held.  It was fine, as long as they didn’t call it cuddling.
“Dean, I need you to listen.  Take me to your room.  I’ve got you.”
“Please..  More...”
“Dean…”
“They were worried. I do not think they understand that humans need time.  I told them that you wanted to meet them, but we needed to move at a much more human pace.”
Dean’s mind supplied him with an image of naked Cas, which he liked.   He thought of not touching Cas, and decided that he’d rather keep scenting him, thank you very much.  Castiel let out a long suffering sigh.
“There is a sigil that needs to be drawn in holy oil. The bond must then be sealed.”
“Dean…”
“I get it…”
Dean focussed in on Cas’s voice.  Cas was pregnant and Cas needed him.
“There are traces of his energy in here.  Can I stay in this room?”
Cas’s smile was something he had never seen before.  His eyes were soft and large, and so, so blue.
“I can’t believe we’re naming our kid based on something I said cuz I was frustrated.”
The Cas shaped nothing stood like a statue for a moment before dropping the angel blade.  Cas cupped Dean’s face in his hands.  Dean instinctively flinched away.  He needn’t have worried.  He had been healed.  Cas’s blue eyes were wide and frightened.
“I’ll get the holy oil then.”
“My knot…”
Cas opened his eyes.  They shone bright yellow.
Dean chuckled nervously.
Of course he did.  It was so like Cas to think of Dean’s happiness, even while he was bleeding out.  That poor selfless son of a bitch.
The nephilim was righteous and offended. The feeling was so fierce it made Castiel’s being throb harder.  He laid there in the hay.  He wished Dean and Sam were here.  If he were to die, he wanted them to be there. He was so cold.  The darkness was opening up to swallow him.  All he could see was blackness.  Then there was nothing.
Castiel could smell Dean’s concern and low grade alarm.  He felt an odd bubbling sensation coming from his hole.
Dean wasn’t used to asking for things.  What he wanted didn’t usually matter in bed.
First, there was the memory of the old Cas, pre-rebelion days. They had sat next to each other in a children’s park
Cas placed a kiss on each of his eye lids, collecting the tears.
He received rejection from the nephilim grace, loud and clear.
“Rest up, okay Cas?  Sam n’me will take care of you.  I’ll get the nerd to do a deep dive into the library.”
Dean murmured.  Cas was not interested in those specific word sounds.  Dean’s hands felt good though.  Dean ran a hand over Cas’s back.  It slid through sweat.  Cas’s skin was extremely hot. He was unable to concentrate on that when he was inside Cas.  It was hot and slick and Dean’s eyes rolled back at how good it felt.  The muscles opened and clenched around his fingers in the most beautiful way.  Dean took hold of Cas’s shoulder for leverage.  Cas clutched it.  He gripped so hard that Dean winced.
“How you feeling Cas?”
“I think your suppressants have failed.”
“Want you…  On top…  You know how that works?”
“They won’t watch…”
“Mmmm?”
“Okay, okay...”
“Oh.”
“Go to sleep Dean…”
Dean was aware that he had just crossed the line between instruction and phone sex.  He was talking dirty to Cas.  He needed Cas to come if only to manage this mysterious heat.  Cas cried out, but then it turned into a long drawn out purr.
Castiel ran the tip of his finger over the bridge of Dean’s nose.  Dean made one of the faces that he made when Castiel did things he didn’t understand.
