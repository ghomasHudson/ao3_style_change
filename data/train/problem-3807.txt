Dean rolled languidly off top of Castiel, staring at him with stars in his eyes. Once Castiel caught his own breath and regained movement of his limbs, he retrieved a damp towel from the bathroom, first cleaning himself up and then perching on the edge of the bed to carefully clean the sticky mess from Dean’s stomach. Dean still hadn’t said a word but was now staring dazedly at the ceiling.
“That’s awesome, Clarence,” Dean chimed in, and now it was Castiel’s turn to flush. “Really, though, helping kids, man? That’s great.” Charlie felt herself grinning as she watched them.
Dean heard giggles from the direction of the couch but ignored them as they finally made it through his bedroom door, and he kicked it closed behind them. The lamp on his nightstand flooded the bed with a warm light as the pair made their way toward it, shedding the rest of their clothes as they went.
Dean shook his head and pulled a large metal bowl from a shelf below the stainless-steel island, “You have absolutely no idea what you’re missing out on. I’m about to change your life. Get over here.”
They laughed through a magnificently bad movie, though Dean and Sam had to initially explain to Cas and Jack why sharks being sucked up into a tornado was so funny. When the credits started rolling, Sam stood to grab the next round of beer.
He knew where the meetings were held because he’d been to them before. And though he hadn’t told his family about his attempts at getting sober, it turned out that it didn’t matter anyway. He’d failed all those times, and to numb the pain of failure, he’d just drowned it in more whiskey. He didn’t just fall off the wagon; he’d gotten run over by it.
Castiel Novak was not a morning person. He slapped his phone as his alarm sounded on Sunday morning, covering his head with his pillow. He didn’t always work on Sundays, but today happened to be his turn in the rotation. He finally hauled himself out of bed and lazily pulled on his scrubs after the second alarm before dragging through the rest of his morning routine. He was still feeling groggy when he threw on a warm fleece jacket with the hospital’s logo and grabbed his messenger bag as he left the apartment.
Dean exhaled slowly, feeling on edge. Sam shifted on his feet and a muscle in his jaw twitched. “Hey, Dad.”
“Um, Cas, would you, uh, wanna go to the Roadhouse Christmas party? It’s Friday night, right Ellen?” She nodded. “Everyone’ll be there.”
Dean laughed and turned leave, but Gabriel’s hand grabbed loosely at his arm before he got too far. “Hey, Dean?”
“She’s coming back to Lawrence for a few weeks for winter break. We’re gonna get together then—talk some stuff out.”
Instead, he’d bit his tongue and carried on with shopping, knowing that she wasn’t worth his anger. She didn’t know any better in the same way people used to question why Jack lived with them.
Dean shook his head, “No way. This is messing him up, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him this panicked, this human. I should go alone, Jack is safer here.”
Cas beamed down at him. “I second that,” he said, moving down to cushion his head on Dean’s chest, their legs tangling themselves below the sheets.
Eileen joined Jack with his purple roof, carrying over a bowl of rock candy for his walls. Dean turned to face Cas.
“We’re relieved to hear from you Cas. See you two in a few,” Sammy sighed. “See ya, Sammy. Make sure the kid stays hydrated,” Dean swears he saw the eye-roll as his brother hung up.
“Okay. Huh. That’s, good to hear. I’m sure Jack will be relieved,” Sam sighed, “He’s managed to fall asleep so I won’t bother waking him now. Are you two heading back tomorrow?”
His eyes darted down the left corridor subconsciously. Cas was an early riser, a grumpy one till his second cup of French Roast yes, but it wasn’t like him to miss breakfast like this. Dean couldn’t help his worrying, did he stay up doing research or was he unwell? His grace was running at trickles, was it affecting his health?
He linked their fingers together as they walked around, admiring the golden woods surrounding the ground. Cas pulled him closer, “Can I buy one candle? Please? They’re on sale, and the woman at the booth says that you can get them made with a custom scent. And, she even has a gift box with supplies to make your own candles at home… Dean?”
The grocery store was empty, save for himself, the shopkeepers, and a young couple debating over cat food in the far back. Sam untucked his list before starting with the fresh produce and baked goods. He picked two warm loaves off the shelf and a bag of garlic-flavoured dinner rolls.
There was a comfortable silence between them as Dean sat Cas down on the bed to dry his hair and dress his more prominent wounds. He stopped every few minutes to place a quick kiss on Cas’ lips or forehead. The blush was ever so present, and when Cas refused to get dressed apart from the boxer briefs, Dean wondered to himself if he’d survive the night.
Waking up to the press of Cas’ body over his own, Dean cuddled closer to the angel in his arms. He was pressing his nose between tufts of tangled hair. To their side, his right arm lay asleep, bearing the weight of Cas draped across him. Moving was not an option. Dean didn’t want to wake him. The drive home wasn’t long, but he needed as much sleep as he could get.
Cas handed over the mugs before settling by Dean’s side, sticking a mitten clad hand into the grates to move the new coal around.
Cas leaned back and Dean took it as an invitation to roll them over until Cas was laying on top of him, face tucked into his shoulder. “Thanks, Dean, I’m glad that you’re here.”
Cas’ fingers found their way below his T-shirt. He shot Dean a smirk before spreading them up the expanse of his chest, stopping only to pinch at his nipples as he answered, “For the record, Dean, I’m a young angel.” Dean shivered, lost for words as he let Cas undress him.
“Dean I - ‘m sorry, you should let me be,” Cas drew his body back, away from him. Dean didn’t move. He sat forward on the heels of his feet and tilted Cas’ face to his, “Don’t you dare apologise. I’m here for you Cas.” He closed his eyes, but didn’t push him away so Dean took the opportunity to continue, “Let me take care of you.”
“We should get those,” Cas whispered into his hair. “Jack will be back from town soon. He’ll want to get started.”
He pulled out his make-shift first aid kit, got out his switchblade and busied himself. He began by cutting the blood soiled trenchcoat open.
Dean’s head was spinning. They hadn’t heard from Cas in two days. He had been giving him the benefit of the doubt up until then, not wanting to interrupt his hunt. Cas knew to call for backup, he’d have called right? So what if his grace isn’t there? His attempt at keeping his calm was failing but he tried his best to hold on.
“What do you mean Jack?” Cas asked. Jack had a look in his eye, one which spoke of timeless knowledge and joy.
“Hey, Sammy,” Dean looked across to Cas, who was sitting atop a pile of pillows. He was nursing a cup of hot chocolate they’d managed to mix in the absence of proper lighting. “I found him passed out in his motel room. He’s,” he paused, “He’ll be okay.”
A single stream of light was cast across his bedroom. It played with sharp shadows but offered silent solace; he was safe here. He wasn’t alone. Awakening to total darkness was far from pleasant. The memories it churned coupled with his nightmares led to sleepless nights fueled by fear. No protests came when he opted to leave the hall lights on at night or after he’d fallen asleep with his door ajar, granting the yellow hues access to his walls.
Placing the final batch of cookies to bake, he turned to see Cas giving him a soft look. He glowed in the orange light, but not with grace.
“This isn’t about what I’ve done for you, Dean. It’s not the same. I’m not even sure what’s wrong with me... I think something’s broken.”
Dean’s heart fell over. Was he such a bastard that his best friend thought, he what? That he’d pretend as if this hadn’t happened? That, they’ll get soft and cuddling today, then back to normal tomorrow?
“Yeah,” he sighed, “I can’t believe I’ve been out for two days. I’m sorry, I should have been more careful -”
“I’m not telling you not to go after him. We’re all worried but think for a second, he’s not that far out. We can go together once Jack wakes up.”
Dean reached for his best friend, “Cas,” he kept his voice soft and pulled the angel into his embrace, “Are you okay? Can you hear me?” Cas whined, pressing his face deeper into Dean's chest.
“I’m sorry the weather got out of hand and ruined our trip. This isn’t what I had planned when I proposed we take time off,” Cas whispered before looking down.
He grinned, “Once you don’t go around buying scented candles or any of those random seasonal trinkets for the bunker. You’re only allowed to buy me pie.” Cas pressed closer, running his hands under the sweater to draw circles on Dean’s hipbones.
“I’m sorry Dean.” His face was raw with emotions. This wasn’t his fault, “Don’t be. Cas, you can’t prepare for everything. Let’s get you cleaned and patched up okay? We can call home later.”
, he told himself. The realisation was like catching supernovas in his bare hands. A million thoughts were running through his mind, but only one word mattered.
Cas nodded against Dean’s chest, “O-okay.” His tears didn’t stop, but he let go long enough for Dean to grab a tube of shampoo to work into his grimy hair. There was a visible hum of content as he allowed his fingers to draw circles into the angel’s scalp. It was far more intimate than anything Dean had experienced in a long time. He felt a flutter deep in his heart as he tried for a smile, “Is this okay?” A hum of approval followed and then a shy frown as he said, “My clothes
His stomach fluttered. Every moment felt like falling in love all over again. Through soft touches and comforting words, being with Cas made him soar. Yes, flying was scary, but he’d go anywhere with his angel, knowing in his heart that Cas would protect him. They saved each other and always will.
As unexpected as the snowstorm was, there were few things he would trade their vacation for. Maybe thicker blankets or a gas heater, but not much else. Cas’ presence made battling the cold worth it. His angel was worth everything.
Dean paused mid-thought after hearing a scream, “Dean!” Sam’s voice echoed across the water. Snapping his head back, he saw Sammy waving over to him. Jack leaned across his torso, on the verge of fainting. He seemed to be holding on to Sam’s jacket. Dean’s brain went into auto-pilot as he ran over and held Jack close. Taking the weight off of Sam in the process before sitting the boy down.
“Something I should have done a long time ago.” Dean ran a shaky thumb over Cas’ jaw, studying the curve of his chin and the way his eyelashes fluttered as he drew circles over his pulse. He felt the spike of Cas’ heart rate against his palm and watched with intent as his pupils blew wide under the dim light. The sight of Cas unravelling under his touch was driving Dean crazy. He wanted more, but not this time, he thought.
There was a growing pool of darkness swallowing his frame. Clammy fingers found his torch, granting him a tunnel of light. Something was burning or got burnt. The smoke snuck up on him and left a bitter taste in his mouth.
Christmas carols trickled through the bunker halls. Traces of his midnight baking left the library smelling of cinnamon and melted butter. Their main tree was standing proud in the map room, red lights blinking at Dean as he gave the place one last once over.
His breathing grew sharper as he circled the couch, noting that the living space was separated from the bedroom. Nothing stirred, and then another spark. Small yet vibrant like fireworks. Dean watched captivated as the sudden burst of yellow and white faded back to black. The room felt heavier, a press of energy against his limbs.
“His grace is being snuffed out like a wildfire. I don’t know why Cas didn’t tell me that he was going out but I expected better of you two. If he gets hurt out there without backup....” His bottom lip trembled, the thought alone of who or what could get to the angel left him uneasy.
They stared at each other for a few long minutes, breathing in sync and half-hugging each other. Dean saw the tears forming around Cas’ eyes, pools of blue glossed over and overflowing with love.
Dean walked over to hook his chin over Cas’ shoulder. His house was already lined with yellow flowers, and there was a hot-wheel car placed in the front yard. He’d know that body anywhere.
Eileen signed back to him, “We’ll be there in a minute,” before posing for a selfie with Sam. They were genuinely happy for the first time in years, and Dean’s heart swelled with the knowledge that his family was together this holiday season.
Embers and sparks, like swirls of energy in the darkness, peeked at them as the fire lulled them through the night.
Resting their foreheads together, he took a moment to admire the depth of those sapphire eyes. Then, he stuck his tongue out to lick the sweets off Cas’ thumb, “Who are these for?”
Cas pulled him closer, “I thought you said no presents before we have a meal as a family? What happened to those rules?”
They both flinched a bit. Dean was angry yes, disappointed even that Sam didn’t at least mention it but he wasn’t trying to be the bad guy. He couldn’t understand why they kept it from him. Cas was no stranger to popping in and out of their lives. Heck, he had gotten used to it, as much as it hurts but there was no reason for that now.
He rolled over, settling his head on Cas’ lap, careful of his now bandaged ribs, “I could sleep.” Cas gave him a fond smile, “Humm, getting old are we?” Dean grinned, “You shouldn’t be one to talk, you’re a celestial fossil.”
Cas leaned back, his face was pink, hair frosted and sticking out at odd angles. Dean raised a hand to run his fingers through the mess. A hearty laugh vibrated through his core, warm and comforting, like coming home.
“Yeah, it’s already late. I should be heading to bed myself. Look after Cas, we’ll see you guys after lunch. Good night Dean.”
, “Hey, Cas? Can you hear me?” The sparks roared around them, streaks of colour falling about. They didn’t burn. It gave the same pressed feel as before, of pure energy. Was Cas doing that? he wondered, puzzled. The colours looked far more vibrant, cast across his face. It was a breath-taking sight, well, it would have been if Cas wasn't unconscious, he thought.
Cas hummed, “I don’t think there are any rules. I set the houses up, so you’re free to make them look as you please.”
He slipped on the thumb holes, toying with the creased ends of the stitching. “Less I’m-overly-excited-for-the-holidays and more I’m-trying-to-keep-warm, nothing else?” He asked, hoping that Cas would agree. It was one thing to attend the Town’s Harvest Fair, but seasonal sweaters were
“It’s not -,” he stated, “I’m not your responsibility.” Dean won’t have heard him had they not been sitting in each other’s space. He wasn’t sure if he was supposed to hear it. All the more, it broke him.
Cas didn’t respond, he was shaking again and Dean wanted to kick himself. He hadn’t meant to shout at him.
The cabin was well insulated, but the growing cold was sneaking past the walls and crawling up their jackets. Even bundled under three layers, Dean’s toes were numb, and goosebumps were trailing up his thighs.
“I’m only so strong,” he whispered, kissing Dean’s forehead. “But we need to finish the cookies. Let’s get a move on.”
It was too much to think over at the moment. All he knew was that he wanted this. He wanted to be the one to keep Cas safe. And if it involved getting to hold him in his arms every night, he was more than okay with it.
Dean walked over to fix himself a cup of coffee, “You should do both, half and half. That way you can get a taste of both, and decide which you like better for next time.”
“I can see that,” Cas mused out loud. He tucked Dean further up his lap, “If you let me get the fire going, we can cuddle all night. I don’t want you catching a cold.”
It was snowing outside. Stone roads paved white, trees shivering in the howling wind, windows frosted over. Hail was dropping on the roof every few minutes in a loud rumble, like pebbles being tossed across a glass table.
“I know,” Cas drew him close, “You were right. I did put you back together. Guess I was afraid - I am afraid. Dean, I’m not sure what’s going through my head. It’s all too much. I’m scared and I don’t want you to feel obligated to help me pull myself forward.” He leaned forward, breath falling in low puffs on Dean’s collarbone, hands locked in a hug.
“I want one with bees!” Cas grinned, no doubt responsible for this new demand. The kid had developed an attachment to pyjamas. He had almost twenty pairs by now but kept finding new designs and patterns online or in thrift stores when they were travelling. They had yet to say no to him.
Before anything else, he had to call home. It was way past midnight, yet he knew that Sammy would be awake. He picked up after two rings.
“Jack,” Cas’ face fell, “Is he okay?” He could make out the tension and guilt on Cas' face. Jack was still a mess when he left, but Sammy had called that morning to say that he was calmer. Once he knew his dad was alright the kid would feel better.
Sam was seeing past the anger for sure, he thought. This was more about Dean being afraid of losing someone else, of losing Cas… again than it was about them not telling him. They were the only family he had left and he wasn’t keen on risking their safety ever again.
They stared at each other for a tense second before he snorted. Staying pretend-mad was hard. “Whatever, Samantha. We’re done with the cookies if you crazy kids want to join in on decorating the gingerbread houses.”
When they left for the hunt two days later wearing matching green and blue sweaters, Dean felt bubbly. Everyone was smiling at them. The locals were all welcoming and kind as they walked from booth to booth; waving at them from across the lawn, offering them samples and even complimenting their sweaters
Dean switched his phone off and tucked it back into his bag where it lay on the floor. His back hurt and he had to stifle a yawn as he dropped face-first into the bed beside Cas. That earned him a laugh, “Sleepy?”
“He wants to take up knitting,” Dean said. He smiled, and there was a distinctively fond look in his eye. “We found a box of silver knitting needles in storage last week, and he wants to make use of them.”
“Cas!” his voice bounced around the room, falling flat, “Cas? Can you hear me?” Dean felt his heart sink lower and lower. No answer came and the silence ticked at his anxious mind.
Dean reached for him again, framing his face with his hands, “Hey,” he dragged his thumb over the stubble. Cas shivered, “Hello, Dean.”
Small intakes of breath fell cold on his collarbone. The sun was yet to rise and no amount of body heat can shield off the underlying chills. Cas shifted, digging the bend of his knee upwards and into Dean’s stomach. He tried to mute his groan.
“Huh,” Dean shot the sparkling colours one last look as they melted into the ground, “It's beautiful.”
“Dean,” Cas said his name between a moan and Dean found it hard to listen to reason. There was a distinct want flickering through his eyes. Dean shook his head slowly, “You’re injured. You need to get in bed and get some rest.”
Hey :) I'm sorry for not updating sooner. I've been caught up with life, so to speak. I do hope that you enjoy reading my endeavour of writing fluff.
“Of course!  You don’t recognize me like this.”  She grimaced at her own mistake, confusing Dean even more.  “Dean,” she said, dropping her voice to barely above a whisper, “It’s Castiel.”
Two hours later, Sam was satisfied that he’d covered the lore on church grims.  Just like Cas said, they were the spirits of dogs bound into service to protect churches.  As far as Sam could tell, no one had ever actually tried to kill one, but there was no reason why the usual salting and burning the bones
“Huh,” Sam noted.  “His buddy Shawn Nesbitt was doing some work in Celtic music.  And wait …” He dug through the fliers on the freezer door.   Yes, there it was.  “They recently did two gigs at a pub in town called the Green Lady.”  The flier was all knotwork and fancy Celtic lettering, some of the words in English but some clearly not.  “Hey Cas, is this Gaelic?”
Ada sighed and leaned back in her chair.  “Everyone thinks old churches are haunted.  But there are no ghosts here, Agent Peart.”  She ticked off the stories on her fingers as she spoke.  “No one killed themselves here.  Every priest who ever worked here died peacefully.  I’m half Ojibwe and I assure you that this church is not built on an important Native American site.  We had that checked.  There were never any runaway Confederate soldiers hiding in the basement crypts.  The church doesn’t even have basement crypts.  Just a root cellar with a dirt floor.”
Using her right hand to keep the washcloth pressed tightly on her thumb, Castiel walked back into the suite’s sitting room and sat down at the table with her laptop.  If she wasn’t able to finish the warding right away, at least she could confirm some more of her research regarding battling Fairies.  Maisie followed, again lounging extravagantly on the couch, feet propped up on one of the armrests.
The knock on the door saved them from having to finish the conversation.  Sam didn’t wait for Dean to answer, just stuck his head in the door and said, “Hey, uh, let’s talk.”
I hadn’t checked the weather before coming up with this dumbass plan, and I pulled out of the bunker garage into gray skies and a rainstorm.  That was okay, although it meant I’d have to watch the road a bit more than I’d planned on.  We were in the Impala because I do my best thinking there, and my best talking.  So yeah, driving in a rainstorm wasn’t perfect, but I was done with waiting for perfect.  There was never going to be a good time or the right time or the perfect time, and with what was barreling down on us, if I didn’t do this soon, there might be no time at all.  So rain or no rain, it was time to drive.  It was time to talk.
Jack and Sammy called as they were getting ready to head out. The kid’s voice was hesitant, “Cas? Dad? You’re, you’re okay?”
The alarm clock chimed from its place on the nightstand, indicating 3 am. Dean groaned, “We should at least try to sleep if we’re driving back home early.”
If he has any angel-mojo left, it isn’t working, Dean thought, 'cause he looked... hammered. There were bruises everywhere as if he’d fell from a height, purple and red gashes all across his arms. The long slash across his trench coat caught his attention first.
Cas stared down at the hoodie in his hands. It was navy blue and plain, save for a cartoon mouse he vaguely recognized standing across the chest. He smiled up at the woman standing next to him and said, “Thank you.” They were both covered with blood, sprays of red across their clothes and faces; he’d gotten there just in time to kill the vampire.
All three houses were left to dry on the table that night. Dean lingered for a moment, looking at theirs. Their curtains were crooked and he could see the jellybeans sliding off the walls.
Swaying from side to side once more, he soaked in the soft tunes of Christmas folk music trickling in from the library. Cas’ arms loosened, dipping him on their finale twirl.
“Uhmm okay, fine!” He groaned, dropping his head on Cas’ bicep, wishing he could stay there for a few more minutes or forever, he wasn’t picky. He asked Cas to twirl him again before he moved to grab his oven mittens. They were burgundy and covered in embroidered reindeers wearing Santa hats, he loved them.
He worked his mouth up the line of Cas’ jaw, stopping to suck at the curve below his ear, “Good. That’s good.” Their foreheads were bumping together and they were both close to tears. “'Cause I don’t plan on letting go of you ever again.” Cas moaned into his neck. He sounded like a positive wreck and Dean’s smile only grew as he pulled him up back into a promise of a kiss.
Sam thought of Eileen. She was staying and hunting with Jody and the girls for a few weeks. He hadn’t thought of marriage in years. Their lives didn’t exactly entertain the prospect, yet - he thought of Dean and Cas, no doubt a golden couple in the hunting community. They made it work, it wasn’t always easy, he knew, but being married in the hunting community was far from impossible.
The four of them were easing into a state of retirement, taking fewer cases every month, and more time for themselves; for family. Perhaps, marriage was still an open option for him. He smiled at the thought.
To be fair, Dean was giving in to all of their puppy eyes as of recent. He went soft without any pestering when Sam asked him to make smoothies for breakfast or vegetable soups when he’s under the weather. Dean melted with submission whenever Cas took up a new hobby and asked for assistance, even when he ended up half-covering their room with supplies. So really, it didn’t surprise Sam that his older brother gave into Jack’s pyjama craze.
“H- he uhm,” the kid was no doubt nervous. How worked up is he? Dean thought just as he spotted Sammy coming from the library.
He nodded, “It’s my job. Take care of yourself, Mrs Green. Thank you for the hoodie.” Trying for a smile, she nodded before leaving the room. As Cas made his way to the van, part of him wanted to turn around, go back in, and comfort her, but he knew that it wasn’t his place.
The sheer happiness he felt bubbling inside him was intoxicating, yet, he embraced the high. He was content and safe in Cas’ arms. Their love was stronger than faith, and Dean wanted to wrap himself up in it.
The room had a thermostat and a built-in heater. By the looks of it, Cas hadn’t bothered to turn them on. It didn’t do much for overall warmth but he was no longer shivering so there was that.
“I love you too. And I mean it. The bunker is your home too, so even if we fight or you decide that you don’t want this anymore with me, you’ll always have a place to go… and way to leave too…”
Dean shook his head in question, “Apart from Sam and Eileen coming by, what else is happening today?”
“Yeah, I do.  The cops in Elgin actually did their jobs and interviewed a bunch of David Boddicker’s friends.  Guess what Boddicker did for a hobby?  Urban spelunking,” Sam reported.
Over take-out pizza, the team compared its notes from the day.  All the evidence they’d compiled – the bartender’s memory of wet hems on the green lady’s long skirts, the fact that Boddicker had disappeared after announcing his intention to explore the Belchamp sewer system, and the town’s insistence on keeping the sewer maps secret – pointed pretty solidly at the sewers as the green lady’s hiding place.  Or maybe it was the place where the gateway to the Fairy Realm was located.  Either way, Sam foresaw a trip to the sewers in their near future, maybe even tonight if he could find anything like a map of the sewers online.  Clearly Boddicker had found something that lead him to go exploring this particular sewer system, so the information must be out there somewhere.  All he had to do was find it, and finding things online was what he did, broken head or no broken head.
Feeling stiff from sitting on the floor, Castiel twisted his body, stretching his back and shoulders before standing. Dean’s eyes followed him as he paced around the room, admiring the framed photos on top of an old wooden dresser. He smiled at a picture of two young boys, clearly Dean and Sam as small children, holding sparklers as a young John Winchester smiled beside them. In the next frame was a pretty blonde woman in a flowered sundress. Castiel saw Sam’s eyes when he looked at the woman, but her expression, a sly and perhaps mischievous smirk, was all Dean.
The passion in Castiel’s voice died out and he dropped down onto a bench. “I—I didn’t know for a long time why I always assumed they were terrible humans, not until I became human myself. Then I realized it wasn’t them that I hated at all… It was your choosing them that I hated.”
Sam huffed a laugh. “You really like him, don’t you?” Dean just shrugged one-shouldered, eyes fixed on the floor mats. “Dean.” Sam waited until his older brother’s eyes fixed back on him before continuing. “You’re allowed to like him. Stop trying so hard not to.”
He turned his eyes to Castiel, catching those intoxicating blue eyes once again. “Hey, Cas… can I, uh, get your number?” He nervously fiddled with his phone, setting it flat on the table and sliding it toward him. ”Y'know, for next time. We, uh—we should hang out again.”
When they finally pulled apart, the corner of Castiel’s lip quirked up mischievously. “You know,” he prodded a finger playfully at Dean’s chest, “I believe I owe you something.” He slid his fingers into the waistband of Dean’s boxers and sunk down to his knees. “You wore the shirt I picked to the party, and I made a promise. I’d hate to break that promise.”
The fog faded and the weights on his eyelids lifted enough so that he was able to blink himself awake. The fluorescent lights stung his eyes, but when he was finally able to focus, Dean and Gabriel were both hovering above him.
it wasn’t a terrible car. Dean could appreciate the distinctly commanding look and the subtle hints at the horsepower hidden beneath its hood. And
There was a tiny flutter of lids before Dean’s heart remembered to beat and then he was staring into stunning blue eyes again.
He wondered where Dean and Lisa were and what they were talking about. There was a mix of fear and worry, and even a tinge of jealousy causing his mind to swim in bad ideas. He just hated the idea of Dean dealing with his first negative reaction to coming out—hated the idea of Dean having to explain himself to his ex. He couldn’t stop thinking about it. He picked up his double-spiked eggnog and pointed a thumb over his shoulder.
“You should call her,” Dean finally said just before he pulled the Impala into the driveway. “Just say hey, y’know. See how she’s doing.”
” Angry tears streaked down his face, as the words long overdue spilled out, but he stepped back and intertwined his fingers with Castiel’s, grounding himself with his chin held high. “We managed without you as kids, and we don’t need you as adults. Hell, it’s better when you’re gone most of the time anyway. Why do you even care?”
Instead of pulling Baby into the garage tonight, he turned off the engine just in front of the steel door, not bothering to get out of the car. Tonight seemed so surreal.
Dean slid back into the booth with a mischievous grin. Castiel narrowed his eyes in suspicion. Before he could ask for an explanation, their waitress set a plate in front of him—a slice of pie with a single lit candle.
Sam’s lip curled up into a half-smile. “Honestly, I think I knew before he did. Remember Lee Chambers from high school?”
The loft was beautiful, and Dean’s hand-built touches were evident throughout. Large windows with wide wooden sills lined one side of the open room, looking toward a wooded area. The fall leaves made for a picturesque view. The walls were the same red brick as the exterior of the building and the floor was a smooth plane of polished concrete. The kitchen was a mixture of stainless steel and wooden surfaces with shiny utensils and cooking gadgets that Castiel didn’t recognize hanging from hooks along the wall. A wooden dining table with vintage metal chairs sat near the wall of windows and on the opposite side stood tall wooden bookshelves that surrounded a large television mounted to the wall. A very plush leather couch and armchair, a vintage floor lamp casting a pleasantly warm dim light, and a wooden coffee table sat across from the television, and before he could stop himself, Castiel was envisioning long cozy movie nights with popcorn and warm blankets.
Castiel laid a hand on his chest, just over his heart, expecting him to flinch away, but he didn’t.  “You’re thinking with this, not with your head.”
Sam’s jaw clenched tighter and tighter as he read over the records, noting the gaps and lack of follow up.  “This is some seriously incompetent police work,” Sam grumbled.  “Or someone’s trying to hide something.”
The three of them and Ada Beach reconvened at midnight on the front steps of the church.  Cas drew a sigil on the slates at the base of the stairs in chalk, marking runes in her neat, efficient handwriting.  Sam sprinkled holy water over the steps and the walkway, then burned a bowl full of stinky herbs and wood.  “Passionflower, white lily, hyssop, spruce, cedar and a holy wafer,” Sam explained, as if he hadn’t just this afternoon dragged Dean to every florist and garden center in the county.
Back at the house, Sam almost immediately retreated to the guest room, claiming a headache.  Dean knew that when Sam said “headache” he meant “flashbacks to Hell.”  He knew Sam’s hallucinations were worse at the end of a long day, but Sam had insisted on being there when they summoned the church grim.  Dean stared at the closed guestroom door and wondered how long Sam was going to be able to hold out.
Dean sighed.  “All right, padawan, come check the bedrooms with me and I’ll try to explain what’s ‘weird’ for the normals.”
“Cas is a friend, one of the very very few friends we’ve got left, in case you haven’t noticed.  I am
Maisie grabbed Castiel’s wounded hand and pulled her into the bathroom.  She turned on the cold tap and pushed Castiel’s hand under the water.  The cold immediately eased the sting.  “Ah dammit, there I was talking your ear off while, like, you’re trying to do the . . . whatever.  I’m sorry, really sorry.  I -- I didn’t think.  My mouth just, like, runs away with me when I’m, like, nervous,” Maisie babbled.
“Thank you?” Cas replied, clearly trying to figure out what the right response should be. As he dug through the take-out bag for the last fortune cookie, Dean shot her a grin to let her know he wasn’t insulting her, just teasing. She gave him a little half nod in return. Cas was getting better at dealing with banter. In a few more weeks, she might even have a sense of humor. He found two cookies at the bottom of the bag and tossed her one. Unlike his health nut brother, Cas didn’t say no to cookies.
Dean decided to stop dancing around the issue.  He laid a hand on her shoulder.  “Welcome home, Cas.”
“I just mean . . . huh.  It’s weird.  If this is really Cas in a new vessel, why has he -- sorry, she -- been sitting here letting them treat her like she’s crazy?”  Sam replied.  “Why not go back to Heaven or come find us or go literally anywhere else than a psych ward in Minnesota?”
“Cas fucked up.  Big time.  Epically.  But, ya know, so have we.  Between you and me, we started the fucking Apocalypse.  And yet here we are,” Dean explained.  “Sitting there last night, listening to her rip into herself even more than I wanted to, I decided that we don’t have so many friends left that I should give up on Cas.  So, yeah, I’m working on forgiveness and we’re gonna work on being friends again.”
Sam flipped through the pages of her medical chart, looking for the driver’s license.  He quickly consulted the map program on his phone.  “Yeah.  I don’t think the place is far from here.”
Sam did what Sam did.  He weighed and considered and thought, drinking his bourbon in slow deliberate sips.  Dean gave him all the room he needed.
“Yeah.  I mean yeah and no.  We’re both stubborn as fuck and we both run off and do shit on our own all the time because we don’t want to be a burden to anyone and we don’t talk to each other and then we butt heads and . . . and . . . and I want us to stop doing that to each other.  I don’t wanna waste any more time with us being pissed at each other.”  I wasn’t saying it right at all.  I flexed my hands around the steering wheel, realizing that I’d had it in a death grip while I fumbled around for the right words.  “Do you get me, Cas?
“Our best, most reliable weapon is cold iron, either in the form of bullets or blades.  If we knew her true name, we could dismiss her, but I doubt the name she uses is her true one.”
Hearing Cas say my name in that way only he did gave me the strength to say the words.  “You’re it for me Cas.  You’re the one who makes me happy.  The one I want to be with.  However much more time we’ve got before we check out, I want us to spend it together.”
Dean not only made coffee, he scrambled up some eggs and fried bacon.  Over breakfast, he and Sam worked out a plan for the day.  Dean would drop Sam at the library to run down local records and history.  Then Dean would go question Wendell’s equally dumb friend Jason and try talking to the staff of the church.
Barbara hadn’t just made coffee for them.  She had put out a spread of mini-quiches, spanakopita, and fresh grapes, all arranged with the meticulous care of someone who entertained a lot.  “It’s just some fruit and frozen things that I heated up, but good manners are good manners,” she explained.  “You’ve been so kind it was the least that I could do.”
Sam stopped himself short of saying something really snarky to his brother. Cas was smiling that half grin that she allowed herself when she thought she’d finally gotten some human thing right and Sam didn’t want to spoil the moment for her. Instead he simply asked, “So we’ll roll for Belchamp in what, an hour or so?”
The raindrops on the roof were loud as drums in the silence that followed.  I kept glancing over to my right to make sure that Cas somehow hadn’t regained the power of flight and bamfed outta there rather than face what I know he thought was going to be a fight.  But I wasn’t interested in fighting.  “Don’t blame the kid.  He’s still all messed up from getting his soul back, and he just spilled out everything that was eating at him, like keeping a secret that big.”
In the living room, the coffee table and the side tables were filled with piles of paper – practice reports from students, marked-up musical scores, fliers advertising musical performances, school district paperwork – all interspersed with stray CDs and a thousand different guitar picks.  The couch was older, with a sag in the center seat that spoke of regular use.  One entire wall of the living room was taken up with shelves various kinds of music in a variety of formats.  Like Dean, John was heavily devoted to vinyl, but his musical tastes were far more eclectic.  His impressive collection included everything from the most up-to-date modern jazz to classic big band, with just about everything in between.  He had a lot of classic blues albums, which immediately put Sam in mind of a demon deal, but no hellhound killed its victim with neat slices to key arteries.  John’s CDs were mostly small label presses, some demo recordings, some classical collections.  The three CDs nearest to the top of the paper pile on the coffee table were labeled in Sharpie as “Shawn’s New Celtic Stuff.”  Sam grabbed those.
“You folks here for food or just drinks tonight?” she asked.  She was gorgeous.  Tall and willowy, black hair down to her ass, wide-set gray eyes and skin so pale white that Dean wondered if she’d ever seen the sun in her life.
He didn’t even get to reach up to his face and wipe them away. In the blink of an eye, Cas cradled his face, drying his cheeks with his thumbs as he pulled Dean close and brought their lips together for a tender kiss. Feeling the sensation of Cas kissing him completely blew Dean’s mind, wiping away every thought, every speck of guilt, and cleansed his soul. He had always wondered what it would feel like to be kissed by Cas, had even dreamt about it on some lonely nights, but nothing had prepared him for the intense sensation that was now rushing through his veins. He felt his blood pounding in his ears, felt his heart race and his cheeks burn, and he gave himself completely over to the sensation.
You were supposed to live a long life, find love and happiness. You’re not supposed to be here. Not yet.” He lifted his head, staring at the ceiling, contemplative. Broken.
Reality punched Dean in the guts. Mortified, he stared at Cas, too disturbed by the thought alone, but even more disturbed by the realization of what his cowardice had actually done to Cas. Anger crashed over him like a tidal wave, filling his bones with a seeping self-loathing. How selfish could he be that he had never even stopped to think how his actions would affect Cas? How stupidly blind, how blindly stupid had he been in his own insignificant fears that the thought had never even crossed his mind before?
Realization dawned on him once more. The way they had been going, the way things had been, all he had ever done was hurt Cas. He had always kept his feelings hidden, convinced that Cas didn’t feel the same way. And then, when he had proved him otherwise, Dean had been too shocked to reply, to reciprocate. For years, they had danced around one another in an absurd tango, too blind for each other’s feelings. For years, Dean had avoided dealing with any of it head on. His feelings, his guilt – Cas. Until the bitter end, he had avoided him, and all that had done was hurt Cas deeply. He was staring at the result, was watching it roll down Cas’s cheek this very instant.
He reopened his eyes when his words were met with silence, worried that maybe Cas had zapped away. But he still stood there, mere inches away from Dean, his forehead wrinkled in contemplation. “Okay,” he finally spoke again, “I won’t make up excuses.” He rubbed his neck sheepishly. Now that he knew with a certainty that Dean didn’t hate him, he seemed much more calm and collected. There was still sorrow on his face, but Dean’s words had at least dulled the pain in his eyes. When he met Dean’s gaze, a faint smile stretched out on his lips. “Dean, you’re not the only one who made mistakes. I’m not perfect either. I screwed up too, I’ve hurt you too in the past.” He tilted his head, the smile growing in intensity. Dean felt his heart flutter; he never thought he would get to see that most beautiful smile ever again. “And still, you’ve forgiven me each time, haven’t you?”
Exasperated, Dean ran his fingers through his hair. He had never been good at expressing his feelings, much less to the man he had been in love with for years. Somehow, it seemed much easier to take on all the Knights of Hell at once. Or would’ve been if he had still been alive and kicking. Or any of them, for that matter. “Cas, you know why… I mean look at us. The ways I’ve treated you? The things I’ve said? Hell, even after dying all I knew was how to be selfish. It didn’t even occur to me once how you were feeling with me avoiding you. Even now all I do is hurt you. I’ve treated you like shit, and I’m aware of it. So how can I
Cas was as breathtaking as Dean remembered him. His hair was dark and disheveled as Dean remembered it. His eyes were as clear and blue as the sky on a cloudless summer’s day just as he remembered them. His eyes that mirrored the sheer terror Dean was feeling at that exact moment as he realized he hadn’t been talking to Bobby at all.
Trying to somehow find his ground, Dean shook his head. “Me dying was just… a case of bad luck,” he repeated Bobby’s words from earlier. Though instead of taking his words, he should’ve taken his advice, and done so much sooner. Dean was far from being at peace with his circumstances. But then again, all these weeks prior, when he had still been alive, he had assumed that Cas had been lost to the Empty forever. And without him, Dean had felt as though he had already been dead inside anyway. Especially after countless failed attempts to save Cas, to release him from his deal with the Empty.
a coward. With everything they'd been through, with everything Cas had told him that day before he had died, Dean was still nothing but a goddamn coward.
At the sound of his name, Dean flinched. He felt his heart drop to his stomach, screaming in agony even more than his body had the day that frickin’ rebar had ripped him apart. To try and distract himself from the pain, he finally looked at Bobby. The frown on his forehead made him look so much older than the day he had died. Which meant a lot given the fact that people didn’t age anymore once they went to heaven. Still, as every other day, Dean chose to ignore it. As every other day, he chose to play dumb. Because playing dumb was so much easier than facing the truth, and dealing with all these things he had fucked up so badly. “Why what?”
“I’m sorry, Dean. I never meant for you to feel responsible for my choices. I didn’t mean to burden you with my death, that’s the last thing I wanted.
Which was why he couldn’t let history repeat itself tonight, even though the circumstances were different from back then. Oh how different they were. There was no pride on his part, no ego getting in the way. Just his fear and his feelings of inferiority. His strong belief that after everything, Cas truly was better off without him. Though truth be told, Dean knew himself to not be good without Cas in his life. He couldn’t sleep without Cas, could barely breathe without him. But he felt selfish even thinking that way, always had.
Feeling butterflies whirl inside his stomach, Dean slowly retreated, but didn’t let go of Cas’s face. The feeling of his skin below his touch gave him the courage he needed to finally break out, to finally damn all his doubts and his guilt to hell. To let go of the past and look at what was right in front of him. “I’m saying you’re wrong. You always had me. Because I love you, too. Because you’re my true happiness, too, and I want to be with you – if you’ll have me. If you’ll give me this one chance to finally do things right.” Uncertainty gripped his heart. He knew how Cas felt, and Cas finally knew how he felt too. Moreover, he had finally said that one wish he had been holding in his heart aloud. He had finally bared his soul. It was there for Cas to take. If he wanted it. If after everything, he decided that Dean was still worth it, that he deserved a second chance. Even if Dean still wasn’t ready to completely forgive himself, he was more than ready to finally let Cas in fully. Cas had always seen his soul for what it really was, but still Dean needed to tell him the things he kept locked in his heart. He didn’t want to avoid him anymore, he wanted to share all his grief and joy with him. He wanted Cas to know all of him.
Dean’s lips formed a thin line as his whole body tensed. Speaking of him pained him so much he felt as though he couldn’t breathe even just by
Dumbfounded, Dean’s eyes wandered from the kitchen door to Cas. He felt anxiety slowly seeping through every fiber of his body, forming a lump in his throat. Cas looked tired.
“Thanks.” Mechanically, he reached for the bottle and took it from Bobby. From the corner of his eye, he saw him take a seat next to him on the porch of Bobby’s small new ‘home’.
But Dean knew that this didn’t even come close to all the things whirling inside his mind. He meekly shook his head no, but didn’t find the strength to speak. He wanted to tell Cas so many more things, but again, his guilt had his tongue in a knot. Even if failing him that one last time hadn’t been his fault, he had always been his burden. Because he’d realized he just couldn’t live without the angel. Maybe that had been the reason why he had stopped Sam from calling the ambulance. Maybe that had been the reason why he had given up on all the things he had come to wish upon – because he couldn’t imagine himself doing these things with anyone else but Cas. And Cas had been gone.
He finally needed to do things differently if he wanted to break them out of this vicious cycle. He still didn’t know whether he deserved any of this, whether he would be able to forgive himself one day – all he knew was he couldn’t bear the pain on Cas’s face anymore. The pain of thinking Dean wasn’t and had never felt the same way as him. He’d rather die yet another time than let him hurt like that ever again.
He had not been in love often. He could count the times he had been on one hand. Counting how many people he’d actually told probably didn’t even require any hands at all. He was painfully aware that the amount of times that phrase had actually left his lips was close to zero. He had always been more about actions, but even those he was incapable of right now. He didn’t even dare touch Cas in any way, much less hug him like he so desperately wanted to. Yet, he didn’t know how to have his heart reach out. Speech and actions both seemed to fail him.
Instead of replying, instead of admitting it, however, Dean drank. That’s what he had been doing every time the pain became unbearable – he drank. He was always drinking, but he never forgot. The pain never let up long enough for him to breathe properly. He had thought telling Bobby or Charlie would lessen the pain, make it go away. But it stayed. It stayed and laughed him in the face, bigger than any monster he’d ever faced before. Because deep down, he knew that this was the biggest monster in his closet, a monster that accumulated smaller monsters and kept growing and growing, towering over him like an insurmountable pile of crap. He’d thought that once he’d go to heaven he’d finally be at peace. Alas, he had been so wrong.
It was still weird to think of it like that, even after being here for almost seven weeks. It didn’t feel like home, not even with Bobby around and all the other friends and family they had lost over the years just a few streets down. He missed Sam. He missed his baby brother. He missed Jack, Donna, Jody and the girls.
, but why would the angel ever assume Dean didn’t want to see him? Why would he think that lowly of himself?
But he knew that he had to speak up. Bobby was right. Charlie had been right too. They needed to fix this. Hell, he knew he couldn’t go on much longer if they didn’t work things out. He knew that if he let Cas walk out the door tonight, he would break down completely. He knew he had to speak the truth, and speak it tonight – or forever hold his peace. “I didn’t avoid you because I didn’t want to see you, Cas.
Cas sat down across from him at the kitchenette table and started opening her laptop, but he reached over and pushed it closed. “You’re as bad as Sam. You don’t have to be working all the time. Go read your book. What was it,
He went out for a drive to clear his head, using the excuse that they were almost out of coffee beans, a definite red alert situation.  He was going to miss this whole “drinking freshly ground coffee in the morning” thing once they returned to their normal hunter lifestyle of crapsack motels and truck stop food.
“Well that’s not suspicious at all,” Dean remarked sarcastically.  “Looks like we’re going pub crawling tonight.”
“Way back when they built this church, the very first priest wanted to keep the church and its people safe.  So he buried his dog at the base of the church stairs, then bound the spirit of the dog to protect the church and its people.  It doesn’t wake up for little minor things, but back at in the 1900s, we think it killed a man for trying to steal the church poor box.  And when those stupid frat boys tried to steal something important and valuable, well, it protected again.”
It was midnight when they finally gave up on doing research and kicking around ideas, but Dean knew his head was too full for him to sleep any time soon.  He sent his brother off to sleep in the guest room – Sam would never fit on the couch but Dean would, just barely – and sat down to flip through TV channels.  Whoever the Swansons had been, they had a decent cable package.  Dead family’s house, dead family’s couch, dead family’s TV, and an ex-angel who’d somehow repo’d a half-dead body sleeping in the family bed like goddamn Goldilocks, Dean reflected morosely.
Dean smiled.  The more original Cas came out to play, the better, as far as he was concerned.  “Well, then, what can you do?”
“What does that have to do with a dog attack?” Ada asked.  She did that Mr. Spock thing where she raised one eyebrow, something Dean had always thought was cool.
“Ear plugs worked for Odysseus, might work for us,” Dean said.  Sam shot a surprised look at his brother, who almost never let on that he’d cracked a book or two in his life.  Dean frowned back at him.  “What?!  I read.”
Dean took one last circuit around the outside of the church building and headed inside.  He found Cas in the main chapel, looking up at the stained glass window depicting the Annunciation with one of the saddest expressions he’d ever seen.  Then, to his surprise, she knelt down in the rearmost pew and started praying silently.  When she stood up a few moments later, her shoulders were slumped in visible disappointment.
“Yeah, sure, whatever, Cas,” I responded, choking the words out around the rock that seemed to have formed in my throat.  I quickly found a spot with a big clearing off the side of the road, where people parked in nice weather to fish in the nearby creek.  I could let him out of the car here and then he could call Sam or Jack to get him back to the bunker and I’d just drive for a while until I could forget how I’d just made the biggest mistake of my life.  I bit my lower lip hard enough to draw blood and shut my eyes so that I didn’t have to watch Cas get out of the car and walk away from me again, this time maybe forever.
He was going to kiss her, would have kissed her, if not for that barking dog bringing him to his senses in time.
Sam nodded.  “I’ve got a ton of Saint John’s wort.  I’ve been using it for the last few weeks to deal with the hallucinations from the Cage.”
Hwang responded with a brusque laugh.  “No wonder you put a knot in the Chief’s knickers.  He hates those cases.  Have a seat then, and I’ll bring you what we’ve got.  Boddicker is mostly being handled by the Elgin police, though we’ve got some things.  Detective Drummond is the lead on the other three.  He’s out in the field now.  I’ll send him to you when he’s back.”
“Sure thing,” Maisie responded with an answering grin.  Unsurprisingly, she was far more comfortable with Dean than she was with Castiel, despite all of the reassurances.
Cas was weeping fully now, despite her best efforts to lock it down.  Dean walked around the kitchen table, pulled her to her feet and into a fierce embrace.  Her arms wrapped around his waist and her face buried in his chest.  Dean rested his head on top of hers and rubbed gentle circles up and down her back, the way his Mom used to do for him as a little kid, whispering into her hair, “It’s okay, Cas.  It’s gonna be okay.  We’re gonna be okay.”
character into the edge of the door frame with Dean’s third-best knife.  Castiel’s hand flinched, the knife skipped, and its point drove into her left thumb.  The pain was sharp.  She tried but failed to stifle an immediate verbal reaction.  “Son of a bitch!” she hissed, falling back on Dean’s all-purpose oath.
“Look,” Dean added, “Sam and I are heading out to follow up on some leads.  Here’s one of my spare cells with both of our current numbers.  You call me if you need anything at all.”  He set the phone on the night stand.  “Drink a lot of water and sleep it off, okay?”
They asked a few other follow up questions, but Stefanie hadn’t noticed much unusual about Matt or around the house.  She’d been focused on work and wedding planning.  Although she was making heroic efforts to keep control, she was getting more and more upset with each question.  Dean felt a little guilty about stirring up her grief and he could tell Sam was feeling the same.  In the end, after fifteen minutes of questions and increasing amounts of tears between her careful answers, they thanked her, shook hands and headed out.
“Son of a bitch.” It all made sense.  The sloppy police work.  The hostility to the Feds looking in on the case.
“Whatcha got, Sammy?” Dean asked, sitting at the head of the kitchen table, the place he’d claimed as his own during their “family dinners.”
Maisie headed out the main door, Cas only a few steps behind.  Dean stopped her with a light hand on her arm.  “You got this, right?” he asked quietly.
“The ritual they used to create the kyrkogrim is here, in the records.  Maybe there is a way to use the ritual to change the terms of the guardianship,” Cas said quietly.
.  Dean settled in with another beer to watch Paladin adventure his way through a world where the good guys always won.
“John and Shawn Nesbitt were friends.  They played guitar together sometimes.  Shawn was a talented classical guitarist.  He played – he played for our oldest son’s wedding.  John was absolutely broken up when Shawn was found dead.  He was sure something wasn’t right about what happened.  I told him – I told John to leave it alone and let the police handle it.  But you know how that went.”  She interlaced her hands as she talked, clenching them together until her fingers were white, but kept her face as still as a frozen pond.  “The police haven’t done anything and now John is dead too, the same way as Shawn, and they still won’t admit they can’t handle it.  Shawn’s parents are older, they live in an assisted living facility in New Jersey, and they don’t want to make a fuss.  But I am going to fuss, no matter what anyone says.”
“Sure, next time we have some quiet time, I’ll see if I can find one of the good old black and white ones with Karloff.” He liked watching movies with Cas. He’d watch just about anything with her just to see her reactions. It was like watching something for the first time again, plus she always saw things he’d never thought about before. Hell, if she liked it, maybe he’d even see if this
“Beats me,” Dean replied.  As if Ada Beach would let them anywhere near the church’s carefully-tended flower garden with a backhoe.
Ada Beach met them at the door of the church.  “Ms. Beach, thank you for letting us come back.  This is my partner, Agent Lee, and Ms. Swanson, our translator,” Dean said.
The freezer door was covered in fliers and magnets advertising bars.  Unlike the ones in the living room, these fliers were all for performances by John himself or by John with Shawn Nesbitt – they called themselves “The Desperate Romantics” – at clubs in Rockford or Elgin or DeKalb.  They’d even played in Chicago once, right before Shawn was killed.  Sam had the beginning of an idea.  Maybe the vamps or whatevers had zeroed in on these two particular guys at one of their performances.
I opened my eyes and he was right there, slid across the seat to close the space between us, gorgeous blue eyes focused on me as if nothing else existed in the world.  His thumb traced over my cheek and my belly was all butterflies again and it felt like hope.  “Cas?”  I hoped and I wanted so badly, I didn’t know what else to say.
“Bullshit. I call bullshit!” Dean interrupted.  “I had to listen to Lucifer monologue at me and you are
Dean was so incredibly done with his brother’s hints and winks about him and Cas.  “You need to stop that shit right now,” he said, the growl in his voice making clear that this was not an idle or teasing threat.
like he’d been doing this his whole life.  Now, I can’t carry a tune with both hands and a bucket, but Cas?  Cas can fucking sing.  He couldn’t hit those high notes like Plant, but he took the whole thing down an octave or so until it sounded like the growl of Baby’s engine with lyrics to it and it was one of the best things I’d ever heard.
The coat was huge on her, but for the first time since he’d found her at the hospital, Cas looked completely comfortable in her brand new skin.  Dean helped her adjust the fall of the lapels over her blazer and nodded in satisfaction.  “There.  Sam’s waiting in the car.  Let’s go.”
Cas pulled out one of the flyers for the Green Lady and showed Maisie the symbol she couldn’t translate.  Maisie nodded.  “Yeah, that’s it.  The Green Lady welcomes Fairies – you saw that last night – and it’s owned by Timothy Drummond and Rosemary Ramsey.”
Ada had tears in her eyes as she crossed herself.  “I hope that poor creature finds its rest in Heaven.”
Dean Winchester hated the smell of hospitals.  The combination of nose-burning disinfectant, too many humans crowded into a small space, and various forms of sick had always turned his stomach a little, but his reaction had become even worse since he’d had to stand in a hospital room and watch Bobby die.  The effort to keep his stomach from rebelling was so all-consuming that he was barely listening to Sam question the witness to their latest hunt.  Two stupid frat boys in Wabanquot, Minnesota had gotten themselves mauled by what they described as a giant glowing black dog, and now here he was, standing in a hospital room, hoping he wouldn’t blow his FBI cover by puking on his shoes.  And hoping that he wouldn’t have to put a silver bullet in this dumbass kid who couldn’t have been more than 18.  While Sam continued to pepper the kid with questions, Dean patted the various pockets of his fake Fed monkey suit looking for Bobby’s flask, then remembered that he’d left it in the car so he wouldn’t lose it again.  He swore under his breath.  A drink would really help settle his stomach.
“Valerian and Saint John’s wort. They’re herbal therapies for calming. They don’t take the edge off my reflexes or my brain, don’t worry,” Sam replied, edging into snippy and annoyed.
“I promised Sam I would fix him,” she said.  “And I will.  No matter what it takes.  No matter what kind of deal I have to make, no matter what it costs me.  I will find a way to help him, Dean.  I promise.”
“I know the Belchamp police think I’m just a hysterical suburban mother with an over-active imagination who’s read too many true crime books.  I’m not.  It can’t just be a coincidence that John and one of his friends died exactly the same strange way,” Barbara said.
Dean handed Jason a card.  “Look, Jason, if more strange things happen to you, if you start feeling sick or weird or not like yourself, you call me, okay?  I deal with crazy stuff like this all the time.”
Maisie fussed in her purse, then handed Castiel a small piece of paper with a phone number and e-mail address written out in loopy, sprawling print.  “That’s my cell number and my e-mail.  So you can get in touch with me if you wanna talk some time,” she explained.  “Now let me take a look at that cut again and see if we need to go hit the Urgent Care after all.”
Cas fumbled, “Uh, I had, um, an unorthodox education.”  Fortunately Ada was too spooked to question that.
“No, just ginger ale.  I might have to drive back to the hotel,” Castiel answered with a glance over her shoulder at Dean and Fenella, who were dancing very close together.  She wondered just how far Dean was going to take his willingness to be bait for the green lady and she didn’t like most of the possibilities.
“Can I help you?”  Sam hated being short with her but the headache pounding in his left temple made it difficult to mind his manners.
“I’m not interested in hurting anyone.  Dean – my friend – and I are trying to find out why four men are dead, including this young man.  Will you help us?”
It had never occurred to him how alone Cas was now that she was human.  Did she even know anyone who was still alive other than him and Sam?  There were so many things Dean wanted to say.  He didn’t know how to say any of them.  Instead, he did what he always did and tried to talk to Cas with his eyes, hoping that Cas could read in them what he couldn’t say out loud.  They sat across the kitchen table, half-eaten sandwiches ignored, minutes stretching out in silence.
He thought he caught a hurt look flash across her face, but it was gone quickly enough that he might have imagined it.  “I’m going to try to get another hour or so of sleep before I have to talk to the lawyer about the house and the money,” she said.  “I know you and Sam can’t be happy sitting around waiting for this all to be resolved.”  She picked herself up off the floor and retreated to the master bedroom without another word, leaving Dean feeling a little bit like an ass even though he knew he was doing the right thing.
“I don’t know.  I truly don’t know.  Maybe I don’t deserve to be forgiven.”  She sounded leaden and defeated.  She still wouldn’t look at him, even as more words tumbled out.  “On the very first night we met in the flesh, I was amazed that you felt that you didn’t deserve to be saved.  I didn’t understand then how anyone could feel that way.  I understand it now.”
With his usual perfect timing, Sam chose that moment to stroll into the kitchen. “Hey guys, I think I finally found us a case!”
Jason gave a little shiver.  “It was frickin’ huge, man. It looked like my grandad’s Rottweiler on ‘roids.  Its eyes were crazy bright blue, like a frickin’ propane torch, and it had that same blue light around its mouth and teeth.”  He shook his head at the mental image.  “Sounds crazy, right?  But I wasn’t drunk or high, I swear.”
Castiel did her best to answer those questions, but every answer seemed to engender more questions, all of them interspersed with excited laughter and exclamations that Maisie could not believe she was talking to a real angel.  Although the young woman surely meant no harm by it all, the endless questions were becoming a distraction from the very difficult process of etching Ogham script into the door and window frames of the hotel room as warding against Fairies.  Castiel wasn’t entirely sure that carving the ward runes was necessarily better than drawing them, but the ancient stones she was copying from had been carved and it seemed safer to take no chances.
Cas frowned and babbled something at the dog again.  It growled and whined back at her.  “I think – I think yes, he’s awake and watching all the time.  It’s part of what he is,” Cas said.
“Do we have several more days?”  Sam asked.  “The killings are spaced apart but there doesn’t seem to be any sort of regular schedule, at least not from the four we know about.”
Dean didn’t need her to say the words out loud to know what came next.  They’d both done far worse things than that.  So had Sam.
Maisie flinched but tried to hide it.  “I thought you weren’t here to do any smiting,” she said with deliberate casualness.  She was avoiding looking at the picture on the screen.
Sam cleared his throat.  His face spelled out ‘tell me again how you’re not totally into Cas’ so clearly it was almost audible.  Dean pointed an angry finger at his brother.  “Sammy, you're gonna do that thing, where you just shut the hell up, got it?”  He grabbed the car keys and headed for the door before anyone could say another word.
by the Rolling Stones, a decent enough song for a basic slow dance, the kind of thing he’d taught himself to do years ago because women really dug guys who were willing to dance with them.  Dean took Fenella’s hand and slid his other hand around to the small of her back.  Her hand on his shoulder made him itchy.  This Fairy chick was going to be really unhappy when she realized that this prey fought back.  “This is a nice place,” he said.  “I had some buddies who came here, recommended it to me.  You ever meet John Ponca and Shawn Nesbitt?  They played gigs here a couple times.  Pretty amazing guitar players.”
Cas gave me one of those shy crooked smiles of his, the ones that put butterflies in my belly.  “That sounds like a splendid idea.  I’ll go get Jack and --”
“Of course.  He’s the patron saint of law enforcement,” Ada noted.  Dean didn’t bother to correct her.
,” Dean answered with enthusiasm, quickly filling a plate.  Sam started with some grapes but the smell lured him into trying some of the spanakopita and he was pleased at how good they were.
“Pretty much,” Dean agreed.  Sam was always saying the same thing, so he assumed it was true.  To Dean, pool was just pool.  He couldn’t remember a time when he couldn’t play it.
Maisie noticed the blood before Castiel had chance to formulate the question.  “Oh shit, you’re bleeding!” the young bartender exclaimed as she sprang off the couch.  “Is it bad?”
“Yeah.  Detective Drummond is Tim’s cousin.  Rosie is related to the Police Chief and the Mayor,” Maisie responded.
Trouble sleeping and nightmares were things Dean knew all too well how to deal with.  “Yeah, they gave us two bottles of pills for you, but we’re going to try something different.”  He got off the couch, shut off the TV, walked into the kitchen, pulled two glasses from one of the cabinets and began to scrounge through the liquor cabinet.  Yep, right where he’d remembered it, a nice single malt scotch, probably a gift these poor bastards had never gotten the chance to drink.  “We are going to use the patented Winchester Method of Dealing with Crap.  We are both going to drink ‘til we’re numb, talk until we’ve lanced that boil, and then probably never speak of it again, got it?”  Dean set the glasses and the bottle down on the kitchen table, then motioned for Cas to take a seat across from him.
Cas was, of all things, curled up in the back seat reading a book. She responded to Dean’s question with a confused look. “I’m sorry, I have no idea what you’re talking about.” There was only one cure for that.
They stood like that for a long time. His T-shirt was damp where her face was pressed into his chest.  He held her until her sobs subsided and her tense body relaxed, making him wonder whether she’d somehow fallen asleep standing up.  “Hey, you awake?” he asked.
“On weeknights, one a.m.  There’s usually someone there cleaning up for an hour or so after, but if we, like, wait until, oh, three in the morning, everyone should be gone,” Maisie explained.  “Is that good?  Like, useful?”
Cas tried to explain the differences between human souls and animal souls.  Dean entertained himself by asking increasingly ridiculous questions and listening to her try to answer them, until she eventually caught on to the game.  She chuckled just a little, which made him wonder what it would sound like if she really laughed.  There and then he decided it was his mission to find out.
“Why dredging up the old spook stories, Ada?”  A short, portly middle-aged white man in a Catholic priest’s black suit and white collar stepped into Ada’s office.  “How do you do?  I’m Father John Pederson,” he said, extending a hand to Dean.  “I’m afraid I eavesdropped a little bit on your conversation.”
Jason nodded.  “A little, maybe, but not as bad as Wendell.  It bit at my legs and ankles, grabbed me with its mouth and front paws like it was trying to take me down, the way my grandad’s Rotty does when he’s playin’ too hard.”  He rolled up the legs of his baggy jeans and pushed down his frayed socks, pointing at the healing wounds along his calves and ankles.  Most of the marks were long slashes, not puncture wounds.  Dean hoped for this kid’s sake that they really were from claws.  Skinwalker claws didn’t carry the curse.
There was a pair already at the table, but while they finished their game, Dean took the time to explain the basics to Cas.  She painstakingly studied the table, the players, and the shots.  “It’s all geometry and physics,” Cas observed.
“Cas . . . “  I choked on his name, wishing I knew how to say this right, wishing I knew how to tell him that I wanted him to be happy, that I wanted to be the one who made him happy.  I almost left it where we were.  Partners.  Working together.  Best friends.  We could do that.  That would be safe.
“We’re very sorry for your loss,” Sam responded.  “Are you able to answer just a few questions now?  It would be a great help to us.”
“Any idea how the hell we do that?” Sam asked.  He was a little spooked by the whole idea and Dean didn’t blame him a bit.  Dean was more than a little spooked himself at the prospect of a wide open door into Fairyland.  With Leviathans already running around, the last thing the world needed was another whole troop of grabby, supernatural assholes who looked on humans as toys or food.
“We both disobeyed and fell. We both did horrible things out of pride.  We both devastated Heaven --”
Dean managed to get two decent-sized glasses of water into her before Cas started dozing off at the kitchen table.  He took her hand and pulled her to her wobbly feet.  It took less effort than he expected to get her into bed, on her side in case she needed to throw up the little she’d actually eaten, blankets tucked around her.  By the time he returned and placed a cold bottle of water on the nightstand, Cas was breathing the soft, steady rhythm of sleep.
“Anyway,” Sam continued, “Wendell and Jason hopped the fence around 2 a.m., jimmied the lock on the church’s front door, and made off with a prayer book plus two silver candlesticks from the altar.  In the graveyard, they were jumped by an enormous black dog that – according to Wendell, at least – had glowing blue fangs and eyes.  Wendell helped Jason get over the fence before he got too ripped up, but Wendell couldn’t get over by himself and got mauled badly.  Even with the cosmetic surgery he’s going to have scars for life.  It was only because the cops showed up that he’s alive at all.”
