Tony's lip was trembling. "Well, fuck," she said, "Steve. I love you and I knew I loved you since before I knew which end of the soldering iron not to put in my mouth---"
With a massive shrug, he pulled them both onto the bed, by some strange miracle managing to stay coupled, wrapping the duvet over them both as they breathed together in silence, trembling. Eventually, Steve held his hand out.  “Towel,” he rasped. Tony sighed regretfully, then handed Steve the towel. He turned to break the spoon, catching the hot wetness flowing out of him and catching Tony in his arms, kissing him softly.
“It’s funny, I didn’t think I’d need to sweat, but it’s a really efficient means of temperature regulation. And look, I still get goosebumps.”
And without warning, there was the visual equivalent of a whoosh,  the world turning inside-out and going small, so small and dark, and they are seated around a dark, wooden table, listening to the click of a case closing and Stephen Strange saying, "So the Orb will tempt you with visions of what you think you want most in life, trying to trap you in a lotos-eaters' vision of reality. The key---"
Tony raised up to his knees. Steve poured a capful of mouthwash. Tony looked rebellious. Steve pried his jaw open and poured the mouthwash in, covering Tony’s mouth with his hand. “Swish,” he commanded. Catching Tony’s eye he said, “Oh, you can swallow. I won’t punish you. But I don’t think you’ll like the way it goes down.” He felt Tony’s lips writhe under his hand, a new sensation. After a while, he took his hand away and commanded, “Spit.” Tony did.
She was smiling at the scene but her eyes told another story. I assumed this wasn’t Tony leaving it alone then.
I will not say that Anthony Stark’s daddy issues are now officially visible from space, nor will I comment upon his clear desire for someone – one particular someone, at least – to give him a smack and cuddle him. I really don’t have to, I think.
The first suit, the restraining suit, drew him to his feet again, then sat down on the nearby bench, drawing Steve across its lap, one hand holding his hands behind his back, the other gently across the back of his neck. Steve briefly wondered if he was going to be spanked, like a misbehaving brat. The other suit moved behind him an Tony wheeled his chair to face Steve again. “Tony!” he said, “You can’t---”
“A little bit late for that, I’m afraid,” he intoned in a mellifluous baritone that ought to have been rousing the troops for Saint Crispin’s Day. “But no harm, no foul, eh, old friend?” I narrowed my eyes. In my experience, Charles’ “old friend” was the direct equivalent of anyone else’s “You want some? COME GET SOME.”
The statue itself towered at the center of all this, newly illuminated from below, making it appear even taller than before, and throwing strange shadows at the ceiling. And it was wearing a pinstripe suit and a round white mask. The costume seemed mundane compared to the rest of the decorations. Zipping around the statue’s head was the translucent, holographic form of a wiener dog with a red nose wearing a sheet. I didn’t get it.
want? Are you okay with this?” It was obviously getting hard to fight the influence of… whatever it was. Tony’s asshole was pulsing, drawing his index fingertip in, practically begging the second finger to scissor him open.
Steve had brought food, but didn’t even think Tony saw him (which was okay, he damn sure noticed the turkeyburger, even if he didn’t actually notice that he was eating), and Steve, well, Steve was sucker for watching his lover at work. There was something mesmerizing about the way the world fell away around him, the unguarded expressions of frustration, confusion, and triumph. So few people saw Tony’s mask of constant babble for just that, partly because he let it slip so seldom that it felt like a rare privilege to be around him in these moments.
Hands slithered across his ass, pulled his pants and boxer-briefs down. Steve felt more exposed, more naked, than he could remember since… well since the day of Rebirth, the serum. Tony pushed his legs apart with a knee, murmuring encouragingly. And… knelt.
The intercom chimed. “Mr. Stark, is there a headset? We have new data, and it’s… it may be sensitive.”
“Stop it. It’s sad enough that Tony tries so hard. I don’t know how Jan put up with it all those years.”
Steve shook his head. “Well… I mean… yeah, I guess I was curious about that, too, but can you feel the armor from the outside? When people touch you?” The tips of his ears flushed. “Eh, forget it, I don’t mean to be nosy.”
another part of him murmured cynically, as Steve flinched from the reek of alcohol on Tony’s breath. He knew he should roll with it, forgive his lover, get over it, but this… this wasn’t over for him, not by a long shot, and Steve… God forgive him, but Steve had needs, too. An idea began to form.
Steve winces at the last name. He's fucked up, he's fucked up big time, and this is the blow they will never come back from, the final betrayal. Tony takes two steps into his personal space, holding his pointer finger stiff like he's going to knock Steve over with it. "Steve... shut up and kiss me."
But in the left hand, we had another cloth flag to represent one more team member. It was pretty obvious, after all. But Steve had come over for the great reveal. Okay, he had been there for the team meeting anyway, and I had made the current getup of his stone alter-ego part of the itinerary. He was tagging along and there was no reason to stop him.
Fuck. And some part of him that was not an image of a gloriously naked-and-trembling-for-him Tony chided
, and made a mental note to file the cock twitch the thought engendered under “explore later.” Was it Tony’s total immersion getting to him like that, or was Steve even more perverted than he’d thought?
They were on their way to the university. Their house was quite close and every day, Steve and Bucky would walk together and separated when they already reached the main garden. Bucky was on the Law Major while Steve was on the Art Major. Their building was in the opposing direction from each other. So they could meet when did not have any class or would return home together or hang-out with their friends.
“Don’t say something like that Clint. I know they will. Besides whatever it is, they will get my support.” He said to Clint lightly. Clint found himself silent by Steve’s statement. Bucky tried to hide his snickered while Natasha looked elsewhere but the smirk was visible enough to see. He rolled his eyes.
“I already bring my lunch, so it’s up to you,” Steve said as they walked towards the rest area and cafeteria.
“Good morning, all,” he strode into the kitchen, and passed Steve, who was at the stove cooking, on his way to the coffee. He stopped next to him and put a hand on the middle of Steve’s back, and the contact made Steve shiver. “You okay?” He asked in a low voice, but apparently not low enough. Steve nodded and went back to cooking, but while Tony was pouring his cup of coffee, someone else spoke.
“Let’s just start the movie, yeah?” Bruce chimed in, trying to alleviate any tension. Funny how things work.
“I’m here, Tony. I’m just going to the bathroom and I’ll be right back.” Steve hurried to the bathroom and back, removing his pants and sliding into bed in a t-shirt and boxers, as he always did. “I’m here,” he offered quietly, unsure if Tony was back to deep sleep or not. Tony shifted and laid his head on Steve’s chest, throwing an arm and a leg across Steve’s body. Steve just smiled and held him close, and kissed his head before uttering a soft “Goodnight, Tony,” and closing his eyes.
“When was the last time Tony ate?” he questioned, already taking things to make a sandwich from the fridge.
“Well that was a bit of a bummer,” Tony sighed, a small smile on his face. “Things were starting to get so good.”
“You like every Steve,” Natasha smiled at him and Tony saw Steve’s blush grow larger, Steve purposely not meeting Tony’s glance. “I will admit, it’s nice to have someone other than Tony say snarky things,” she offered. “The snark loses its effect when it accompanies everything one says,” she looked pointedly at Tony.
“Hey, Steve, I heard Nat caught you and Tony doing it in the workshop today,” Clint giggled as Steve plopped down on the couch for movie night with a bowl of popcorn.
“I can’t imagine why,” she smirked, looking between him and Tony. “I’ll meet you up there,” she left the room with that.
“I was just so nervous, Nat. I don’t know what happened. Two months ago, I couldn’t have cared less. When I’m in Captain America mode, I don’t think about it, I just lead the team. But when I’m just Steve and he’s Tony, it’s like he’s on this whole other level and I don’t know how to talk to him.”
“He’s just being an ass, as usual,” Natasha added. Steve feigned a smile and rushed out of the room.
“Believe me, there’s no need to apologize,” Tony’s words made him blush. “You should probably get to bed, though. It’s late.” Everyone else had already left the room and went to bed.
“I’d like to think so,” Steve looked at the ground, smiling. Tony’s stomach was stormed with butterflies- Steve always made him feel like a love-struck teenager.
“I was sleepwalking last night apparently, and I woke up in his bed cuddling him, and this is hell, Bruce. Steve is never going to go for a guy like me. He’s the moral compass of the nation, and I’m Satan.” Bruce smiled and sat down.
A few days later was the weekly movie night. Steve made sure to arrive a little late, so he would get there after Tony. Sure enough, when he walked in, everyone else was already there and waiting, popcorn and drinks sitting on the table.
Steve went over and managed to pick Tony up, one arm under his knees and one under his upper back, holding him close. He carried Tony to the elevator and said nothing when the door closed, knowing Jarvis would just take him to Tony’s floor. All he could think about was how warm Tony’s body felt against him, and how close they were. When the elevator doors opened, Steve saw that it was not Tony’s floor but his, and after he thought for a moment, he decided to go with it.
There was a knock on the door of the workshop, and Tony yelled ‘Come in!’ without bothering to check who it was- it was either Bruce with a question or Steve with food, both of which would be a welcome distraction.
“Good man,” Tony grinned at him. “What kind?” he held his hand out for the cup as Steve approached, sitting on a stool on the opposite side of Tony’s work table from where he was.
“Nat, I just,” he trailed off, realizing that what she said kind of made sense. “I have no idea how to even go about…any of that.”
“Steve, what the hell are you doing in my bed?!” Tony demanded before looking around. “Or,” he was quieter now, and felt embarrassment blooming on his cheeks, “what the hell am I doing in yours?”
“Okay, Steve, I’m sorry. Let’s talk about it tomorrow,” he put a comforting hand on Steve’s shoulder. “I have to go to the bathroom,” he went to get out of bed, but Steve grabbed his arm before he could get up.
“I’m sorry about Clint last night,” she apologized, although she had nothing to apologize for. “He can be a real asshole sometimes.”
“Yes, sir.” Steve was completely confused, but he headed to the workshop in a hurry. Natasha was standing outside the door when he stepped out of the elevator.
“So much,” Tony seemed to relax even more, and let his head fall gently to Steve’s chest. They watched the rest of the movie cuddled together, with Natasha and Bruce stealing glances at them, making encouraging faces, and Clint looking thoroughly nauseated, as he usually did at affection. When the movie was over, Tony said a quick goodnight to everyone and, with Bruce on his heels, hurried to his workshop, which is likely where he was until the movie. Steve went to bed with a smile on his face, and instantly drifted off. However, a few hours into his slumber, he woke up to see Tony’s silhouette in his doorway once again.
“Tony,” Steve scolded, trying to be firm but mostly it just sounded like he was melting for Tony like he did every time they spoke.
“It’s just so fun, Anthony, I can’t help it,” he said, his voice dripping with sugar-sweet fake innocence.
“Well, I just figured since your boyfriend is going to be there,” she smiled at him, not completing her statement.
“You don’t have to worry about that today, Birdbrain,” he then turned his attention to Steve. “I have to head to the workshop now, unfortunately, but I’ll see you later?”
“Is everything okay, Nat? Is Tony hurt?” Steve became panicked, not having considered how truly strange this was.
“Thanks, Clint,” he smiled before turning to Tony and handing him a plate. “Good morning, Tony,” Steve said in a less charmed tone than before.
“Indisposed?” Steve raised his eyebrow at that. He opened the door and Natasha followed him, chuckling slightly. He saw Tony, asleep on his work desk, and he shook his head as a smile spread across his face.
“Very good, Captain.” JARVIS fell silent after that, and Steve took the plate with the sandwich, and bottle of water, and a cup of black coffee and headed towards Tony’s workshop. The door was open when he reached it, likely JARVIS’ doing. Steve cleared his throat awkwardly.
“Goodnight, friends!” His voice was loud enough to make Tony jolt awake, much to Steve’s dismay. He immediately sat upright, a sheepish look on his face. As everyone else left the room, he smiled at Steve.
“We were just talking about Steve and Tony,” she informed him, turning her attention back to Steve. “You should’ve talked to him more last night.”
“Not sex, idiot,” she scolded, making Bruce chuckle. “Tony’s not used to having people around. Why do you think he wanted us to move in?”
Thirty minutes later, they had a completely layered lasagna ready to go in the oven, and Thor’s apron was covered in tomato sauce.
“Movie night, Steve,” she smiled at him again, starting to leave the room. She turned around at the last second, “please, just keep the PDA to a minimum,” she winked, leaving the room. That left Steve, standing there sweaty from his workout, his heart racing and his head spinning. Did Tony really have feelings for him?
“Wait! You two are together? This is magnificent, my friends, we must celebrate!” Thor beamed, clapping Bruce on the back. He smiled uncomfortably and Natasha just chuckled and ignored Thor, turning her attention to Tony.
“Well, in his words,” Steve straightened up and cleared his throat, and then in his best impression of Thor, “I would like to impress Lady Jane with midgardian tomato cake.” Tony laughed at this, partially at the thought of Steve trying to be serious in the conversation with Thor, and partially because Steve was so damn cute when he was being goofy.
When he awoke very early the next morning, Tony was still asleep on him, so he gently shook him awake.
Steve managed to occupy his mind for a few hours with working out and cleaning, but when late afternoon hit he could find nothing to do that distracted him from his thoughts of Tony. Finally he decided to give in and headed towards the workshop, despite the fact that his better judgement told him he should let Tony work. The door opened when he approached it and he saw Tony staring intently at whatever he was working on.
“Good morning, Bruce. I have some things I’d like to show you in the workshop, if you have time,” Tony urged, making Bruce put his paper down altogether.
When Tony awoke the next morning, the weight of Steve on him was gone, and he opened his eyes to see that he was alone. He got up and brushed his teeth before going to the kitchen, where he knew everyone was.
“Think about it, Tony. He brings you food all the time, he always sits as close to you as he can, and from what it sounds like he willingly cuddled with you last night.”
“Oh, Stevie,” she smiled wide and put a hand on his arm. “He is soooo your boyfriend, whether you guys admit it or not. And based on this morning, I’m assuming he wouldn’t mind to. So the real question is, what are you gonna do now?”
He walked into his bedroom and carefully laid Tony down on his bed, covering him up with the blanket. He was heading towards the bathroom when Tony spoke.
“First of all, I never said anything about you being friends with Tony. It’s kind of obvious that’s not exactly what you have in mind," Steve blushed to the tips of his ears, and she continued. "But if you were looking to do that, I would say start small. Take him an apple when he’s in his workshop for a long time. Sit next to him at movie night.” Steve felt perplexed.
“I’m gonna get another drink,” he stood up suddenly. “Anyone else need anything?” There was a chorus of yeses, and on his way out he heard Natasha excuse herself.
Tony awoke to a noise, quickly taking in his surroundings. He was in Steve’s bed yet again, and the noise he heard was heavy breathing. The blankets were pulled completely off of him, and he sat up to see Steve, sweating and shivering, with a far-off look in his eyes. His breathing was ragged and uneven, and he was clenching the blanket so hard that his knuckles were white.
“Tony?” he prodded, just to make sure he was asleep. No response, so he moved the blankets aside and covered Tony up when he flopped down on the bed. Tony immediately shifted his head onto Steve’s chest, slung his arm across Steve’s torso, and wrapped his legs around Steve like a koala bear. Steve planted a small kiss on the top of Tony’s head. “Goodnight, Tony. I’m glad you’re here.” He drifted off the happiest he thought he had ever felt.
“Yeah, you know, where people sleep?” Steve remarked sarcastically as Tony stood up. Tony grabbed Steve’s hand and began to pull him towards the elevator. Tony smirked at Steve and had an ornery look in his eye. “What?”
“That’s because you have the sporadic sleep schedule of a lunatic. Steve makes breakfast every morning,” Natasha commented dryly, flashing a fond smile in Tony’s direction.
“You know me well,” Tony took a drink of his own. He intended for the flattered tone in his voice to sound sarcastic, but he was afraid it sounded as real as it felt. Steve seemed to remember every little thing, and it always warmed his heart.
“Don’t be so surprised,” Steve chuckled. “I make breakfast every morning, Tones,” Steve reminded him in a teasing tone, looking nervous about the nickname- he had never called Tony that before. It made Tony’s heart race, but he tried to stay calm.
However, not everything went as he hoped. He approached the body again. The rigid body was covered with wings. When he touched his wings, he suddenly felt afraid that this person would immediately wake up and attack him. Maybe this was just a trap and it turned out that many monsters had surrounded him, waiting for him to eat the bait they had prepared. Or maybe the bandits waiting for him took their bait. When he raised the wing, he was surprised to find that the man's body was not covered in a single garment. Although a slave, at least his master will give clothes to his slaves.
“Yeah.” He couldn’t explain anything to his mother. Telling his life, science, and the company is what usually he did, not his relationship.
They would directly attack every person with wings, horns, and tail without mercy. Many had fallen and were lying lifelessly in the snow. Their wings broke and lay rigidly full of pricks in their bodies. Not knowing what to do, he ran to drive the residents to safety. The Children, women and old people ran to save themselves while the male population ran to attack and detain the soldier. Their wings spread wide, their hands turned into large scale arms with very sharp iron claws, and some who fought seemed to have magic circles on their arms.
Cold. It was really cold. He had never felt so cold in his whole life. A snowstorm blew so hard covered his view. His view on bomb explosions, flames in every house, and black armored men with embers and attack the residents.
Bucky just stunned there and his face went blank and stared at the gaping door, where his friend was left. Steve was not the kind of person who admits openly about what he admired. Hence, it was hard to guess what he was actually like and even didn’t give a hint. The similar thing happened when Steve saw the paint from the museum and didn’t say anything but the adoration looked clearly from his face. Bucky finally figured out after they examine two other paintings from a similar creator. One thing Bucky really grateful was that his friend couldn't school his face. So when his friend’s birthday that accident as same on America independence’s day came. Bucky gave him an autograph from Steve's favorite’s artist and he couldn’t stop saying his thanks. So, knew that Steve admitting something close to 'liked Tony Stark' was an unfamiliar thing to Bucky.
Tony had just finished discussing with scientists and checking R&D division. Bruce was nowhere to be seen, and Tony left the group. After he recorded and examined other new single this morning, he went to the studio for the photo shoot for the upcoming fashion magazine. He met Natasha and Pepper there. Finally, he was at SI, doing his research for the upcoming Stark tech. He was truly grateful that this is the last thing he had to do today.
Taking a deep breath, he knew the risks. The risk will be borne by him after binding himself with the sword. "I'm sorry, I can't go back." Closing his eyes as he murmured, a huge amount of energy appeared and burst from his chest all over his body. His heart was pounding, his blood flowing profusely, his feeling of miserable pain he felt the bones in his body changed and elongated. His eyes narrowed, he could see everything clearly and sharply. The soldiers in front of him seemed to be getting smaller and smaller. They all looked up at him.
As he started to stand, Bucky was offering his hand to him. Steve accepted it and stood by his best friend’s help.
“What’s the problem if I become a fan of Tony Stark?” Steve snapped, his ear started to changing color to the shade of pink.
“Don’t listen to her, Steve. She doesn’t deserve to be heard.” Bucky said as his eyes threw a dagger look to the woman’s back.
Peter looked at his dad and asked literally the same question. “When am I gonna call Tony Daddy?” Steve just stared at Peter long enough, he could feel the blush starting to rise from his cheeks and wondered how his son could be thinking of something like that.
“Papa?” A seven-year-old boy appeared from the hall, he was still wearing his Spider-Man long-sleeve pajama. His brunette curly hair was messed everywhere, his brown chocolate eyes were still sleepy, and he dragged Iron-Man and captain America plushies in both of his hands. He walked towards the dining chair in front of the blond, placed his plushy on the chair, and sat on the other chair beside it.
Steve was frowned and confused by Peter’s word, and then he realized that he still hadn’t replied to Tony’s message.
The little boy tried to reach the glass of chocolate milk, and the blond chuckled as see the kid couldn't reach the glass. The blond cleared his throat to catch the attention of the little kid. “U ... umm! Please …” The little kid said with his puppy eyes. The blond smirked and took the glass, placed it near the little kid for him to reach it. “Sure, here you go, son,” The kid cheered and drank happily, and then moved to eat his bacon and scrambled eggs.
“Maria, it's time.” His father yelled from the hall. Maria who heard it just sighed and stood. Before she walked away, she looked at Tony directly. “It's not over Anthony, I will ask about it again and make sure that you introduce me to him and his son,” she said as she walked out of the room.
“Nothing wrongs with it actually. I’m glad about finding what you like. I just hope you are not going to act like those fanatic fans,” Natasha assured him.
“You’re right Peter, thanks,” Steve said as he started pulling his phone from his pocket and saw three other messages from Tony who asked about why he had not responded to the message yet. Steve started typing ‘we’re walking to the bus stop now, Tony. Sorry for the late reply.’ Peter asked as Steve press the send button.
At the long dining table, there was a brunette guy who just poked his breakfast blankly and kept staring at his phone near his plate. He wondered why his boyfriend was not replying his message. He snapped back from his mind as he heard someone cleared his throat. He looked up and found another old man with white hair and grumpy face in his left side and an old lady with concerned face in front of him.
"GO! I WILL DISTRACT THEM!” He shouted while protecting himself with the shield from the arrow of fire that flew towards them.
“Yeah Peter, I guess I’m gonna join you guys tonight. Huh...” Tony realized something, something that Peter said. He called Tony what?
“You almost gave Papa a heart attack, Peter. You don’t want that, do you?” Another person appeared behind him. Steve turned to see his boyfriend standing behind him all this time. There was a smirk in his face.
Anthony can visibly see the slight of amusement on the corner of his butler’s mouth. Oh, he absolutely a manipulative bastard!!
Someone coughed beside them, Steve and Tony who heard it instantly separated and looked to the source of that damn sound (in Tony’s opinion). There were Jarvis and Peter who stood in front of them. Peter’s eyes were being blocked by Jarvis’s hands.
“What were you already got used to?” Steve and Bucky heard a feminine voice and they were greeted by red hair female with a black V-neck tight shirt, dark skinny jeans, and black leather jacket. Steve was sure he almost imagined some secret agent from James Bond film or Black widow from Avengers movie after seeing her.
"PETER! Hey dear, what are you doing here?" Tony asked, kneeling in front of Peter and holding him tight as if his life depended on him. His last meeting with Peter was three days ago and Tony could not stop missing him.
On his way, he saw a sword stuck in the snow. The sword was not very deep and maybe he could pull it out because the sword was not stuck in hard objects. However, what caught his attention was not a sword, but a body that lay rigid next to it. The Brunette man thought he might be a criminal or runaway slave. The location may be now in a wild area, not a public route that people often take. Many monsters or wild animals that could attack at any time.
“I remember you sounding like that when you were still 7.” His Mother beamed with joy, Tony could see it from her face.
“Of course Mr. Stark, I’m gonna tell the guide that you are joining,” she said. “By the way, we are going to go to the biological division,” she added as she walked toward the guide.
He might look like an ordinary employee outside. However, no one knows that Steve is a famous singer and nobody realized either. He was very grateful to it. His YouTube account has reached 10 million subscribers after one year. Steve started to cover songs because Peter always said that Steve had the most beautiful voice he had ever heard. Peter always asks Steve to sing lullabies every night. Not only Peter, but many of his friends also said the same thing. Especially Bucky, his childhood friend and brother (not really brothers, but they are very close like brothers). Bucky was always raving about Steve to stop working at SI and starting his debut, he even promised to help him find an agency. Natasha said the same thing, her friend from middle school who became a supermodel in many magazines. She always thought that Steve had material to be a model since he started his puberty, but Steve refused the offer politely.
“Really, good to know you already meet the truly yours, Tony.” His Mother was smiling warmly at him. He didn’t know why but he felt happy with it. “What does he looks like?”
“I can’t even imagine Steve is being that kind of person.” Clint snickered and Bucky tried to hold his laugh that failed he did.
Oh god, please not. He already got enough about last month while his friends: Natasha, Wanda, and Gamora did revenge for some group of girls who were making fun of him. It was absolute chaos and, in the end, did scolding that trio and tried to convince them for not did it anymore. He was grateful they did get uncaught. Steve asked pepper to keep an eye of them.
“It’s a love song. But when I translated it, I suddenly remembered you.” Steve confessed, his breath started getting rough because of his face, his nose touched with Tony’s.
“I’m not reading something like that. Stop it, buck.” Steve covered his face and groaned, suddenly he hit somebody.
While Tony continued explaining, his mother looked at other photos, saw another photo of him, Peter, and Steve, and she smiled at the photo. Tony noticed his mother’s face has changed. “Something wrong, ma?”
“It’s really nice to see nice father and son group hug, right Peter.” someone approached them from another lane. Steve spun around to see who was talking and found Sam with the grin in his face. “Hey, kiddo.” Sam greeted.
As they walked outside the Stark Industry, Steve invited both of them to walk together through the park as they were walking home. Jarvis followed them from behind on Tony's side. They entered the park, the shortcut to their way home. Peter started to walk beside Jarvis and run around, chasing the dove, or catching the butterfly or bug that he found on the sidewalk. Jarvis kept an eye on him and taught to his curiosity about a bug or everything Peter asked.
“Shot Nat, you almost got me the heart attack,” Bucky blurted. The woman just smiled knowingly and stood closely.
Suddenly the door opened again and an old man with attractive black suited entered in. “Ah, I think you already meet Sir Anthony itself, sir.”
“Because I thought he is your boyfriend.” Peter suddenly blurted out. Steve choked by his own breath after him listening to his son confession.
“Oh god!!” Anthony groaned and lay on the couch near him. He was done the photoshoot session and just got a break. Tony tried remembering all the schedule for today such as: rechecked Stark Industry R&D division, met a producer for another contract, finished his new single, went back to SI for some work, rejected some (bald man) stubborn contract and photoshoot session.
Tony felt his cheek starting to become a shade of pink. Damn Jarvis, he needed to stop doing that, but at the same time, Tony was really happy with Jarvis' comment.
Tony and Steve startled by that call, as he took a look on Steve's face, his face now full of joy and happiness that could not be described. No different as Tony. Tony took Steve's hand in him. As Steve came back from his mind, Steve started to drag Tony and walk towards Peter and Jarvis who was waiting, for them.
“Wh- I- How about you getting ready now, or you gonna be late” Steve blurted out and there was a slight blush on his check. Peter spun around to look at the clock on the wall.
“No need to, besides I already know Peter” Tony assured, “I’m the one who needs to apologize. I hope Peter is no troublesome to you.”
“It’s nice to see you here Mr. Stark, and I’m sure a lot of people around us surprised why you are here,” he said with amusement smile. Tony understood the hint and surely realized that people around them stop their activity just to be surprised knowing their next CEO standing beside one of the employees there. It never happened before that the Tony Stark came to the Economic and Marketing division, especially to greet one of the employees there. It was not his thing. Tony Stark always had known that he was more at R&D Division than there.
“Aww come on Jarvis, you already see that guy’s contract? There’s nothing good in it. Besides I still remember when we first gave him our proposals.” The brunette spoke up.
Seeing from his condition, the dragon shifter must warm his body or he could die from the cold snow at night. Not only the man but also himself. They must quickly find shelter from the blizzard at night or it will endanger both of them. However, he realized he could not carry it as long as the magic chain bound his body.
It was sunny day morning in Queens, warm air spread everywhere, and the light of the morning sun beaming through the window.
"Healthy, I know," Sam interrupted when they entered the rest area. The rest area is like a cafeteria in high school but more in the cafe design. Steve and Sam look for an empty table after they find one near the window. They both sit and put their things (cell phones, tablets, notes). Sam went to order the food and Steve looked out of the window, he could see the whole of New York City from there. He wondered what Peter was doing now and what Tony was doing now. Peter might have been on the R & D floor and Tony did his job. Steve returned to his notes when Sam brought his food. They eat together and talk about things they do or other things they can talk about.
“School held a field t’ip and we came to Stark Industry to see ‘obot, but I was lost.” Peter tried to explain what happened.
“You are not mad about it?” Steve blurted out. Peter's face showed him that he was feeling more confused than before, so Steve continued. “I mean you are not worried that someone will come to our life?”
“Eat, young man! I know you didn’t eat your breakfast at home and if it’s still there. I will wash your mouth with the soap.” Sarah gave a LOOK to Bucky.
She looked back to Tony and sat on the edge of his bed. “So, has he already replied to your message?”
Steve tried to make next song cover video. He wrote the lyrics and sang it noiselessly, but someone tapped on his shoulder and he saw Sam leaning against the partition between Steve and Sam's desk.
Tony stared at Jarvis who smiled innocently. “Whatever you said Anthony, I’m not the one who told her about Steve. However, if you are curious about it, she is the one who asked me about you in the first place.” Jarvis confessed.
He sighed from his imagination. It was impossible to be able to have a chance to talk to Tony Stark, the famous singer, just like a daylight dream. He heard a knock from the door and before could answer, the person opened by kicking it and shouted. “WAKEY-WAKEY STEVIE”
As they parted to take their breath, Tony blurted out between his breaths. “That’s not fair, Steve.” Steve just chuckled and gave another quick kiss. Tony accepted it with defeat. Tony liked seeing Steve blushing, he looked really cute and he never got enough with it. While Steve thought the same about Tony.
“Yup, I found him listening to his song in his playlist a week ago and again this morning in his room.” Bucky smiled winningly.
“Don’t take it personally, Steve,” Natasha spoke softly, a kindness in her voice that Steve imagined most people didn’t experience.
“Hey, um, JARVIS?” Steve still felt weird talking to the AI, but he was getting more used to it the longer he was in the tower.
“Uh, Steve? Your gigantic bicep is kind of squishing my arm,” he spoke in a whisper, amusement clear in his tone. Steve decided to act before he overthought.
“Natasha?” he asked quietly one day, catching her getting on the elevator. He waited until the door closed to speak.
“Sleepwalking,” Steve blurted out, avoiding eye contact with either of them. Tony rolled his eyes, and looked at Natasha.
The Avengers were a team, but they weren’t necessarily friends. Despite this, after everything that happened with Loki, Tony had asked the rest of the Avengers to live in his tower. Partially because he wanted them to be together in case something else happened, but mostly because he didn’t want to be alone. To them, however, he would never admit this. He just told them it was for safety purposes- that it had been Fury’s idea, that Pepper had nagged him about it until he gave in. Pepper knew how much he wanted them there, how much it would benefit him to have people around, so she kept quiet about it. He gave each of them their own floor in the Tower, and in the middle was the communal floor- kitchen, living room, laundry, gym. Tony tried to think of everything he could put on that floor so that they would want to spend time there.
Steve got up to pour some water from the glass on the nightstand onto the towel, cleaned away the sticky sugar residue. When he finished, he knelt beside the bed and placed his forearms on the soft sheets, for all the world as if he were going to say his prayers. Leaning forward, he looked over his shoulder and commanded, softly, “Mount.” He heard Tony’s breath catch in surprise and desire, and his cock twitched in a sudden sympathetic shock of arousal. Arms dropped to either side of  him and he felt warmth against his ass. He reached behind him to guide Tony into him.
Steve rose to lie beside Tony in one smooth motion, pausing to kiss and kiss and kiss again, rubbing his now-naked body against Tony’s. “You see?”
There was a hint of smugness in Tony’s voice when he said, “Okay, I’m going to be experimenting a little here. I’m going to ask for a color in a few seconds, but you stop me the second it gets too much, Rogers, do you hear me?”
I braced for impact. Instead, I got that incredible smile beamed at me. I squinted against the glow. Damn. Should have used sunscreen. “I love Hanukkah. I’ve always loved the story. You know,” and here the smile turned almost bashful, “freedom fighters doing their best in the face of those who would force them to stoop.”
The doctor said, "Okay, we can confirm: definitely not cursed. And, oh, hey... yup, looks like they're in the clear. Do you want to tell them, Colonel? They'll be---" and she broke off, covering her mouth and making a sort of half-squeak, half-coo noise often associated with kitten videos and pictures of piglets and hedgehogs in hats.
I guess it was funny after all, and I felt like a spoilsport for not putting on the matching costumes – the bunny suit or the flower crown. The last one actually was strangely pretty. What do they do with these things after they were finished with them, anyway?
. Your engineering, your style, it’s part of you. It would be beautiful on its own, but there’s nothing about any part of it that doesn’t say ‘Tony,’ to me, and that… It’s... strong… and---“ He took a deep breath. “Look, can we just drop this? It’s embarrassing.”
As I talked, I shot a tight, concentrated beam from my finger into the pile of sand and welded the glass outline of a heart into it, wrote AJ + RD + VA + PWH inside the heart, then shoved the whole mess into the wall and ran the oubliette protocol I’m not supposed to know about.
I processed this for several nanoseconds. “Tony… I may be missing something. Buying gargantuan sculptures of their friends… do people… do that? Should I be buying a statue of Wanda?”
,” only inspiring Tony to take him deeply into his mouth as Steve chanted, “Yes, yes, yes,” and alternated calling Tony’s name and God’s, his fingers buried in Tony’s hair as Tony rubbed against Steve’s leg.
Justice’s voice became clearer every second. “Hank left us the water-soluble paint. Guaranteed not to stain Tony’s precious marble boy after it comes off. It already looks quite nice, but the whole display is still a bit tame.”
but his throat wouldn’t work, the words wouldn’t come. And Steve couldn’t, he wasn’t allowed to, but he couldn’t
“What?” said Tony. “Uh, queen to D5,” he said, as Steve pulled him into kiss him softly. Under the circumstances, it was the only thing he could have said.
It wasn’t so nice when the gathered ex-Avengers walked behind the statue and began to stare at its … backside.
“Queen to E5.” It wasn’t exactly cramped in the capsule, but it was small enough that it was a mercy to be able play without a board. "Mind if I?"
"Oh?" she purred, "like this? Go ahead." She brought her dripping finger to his lips, and he grabbed her hand, sucking and licking it clean. He shook his head. "Not what I meant."
"And those fools are still in denial. All right, here's what you're going to tell them--- wait, no, tell Stark and make Steve pry it out of him..."
Tony shrugged. “I can’t tell. I guess… my lips are tingling.” Steve touched them, and Tony jerked his head to the side. “Command, this is Stark. Any new information?”
Why did Tony buy that thing? “Irony,” he says, every time somebody mentions it. I knew I had been a fool for not saying no when Alicia had asked me to sit for a sculpture. I understood when Clint mocked me for the public’s obsessions. It was Clint. But Tony used to have more empathy…
It would’ve been perfect. From the contacts for the bunny suit, I got an address of people who specialize in custom-builds like this. Fiberglass. Of course they could have built it after the exact specifications. The mask is actually already in the basement. Maybe for Tony’s birthday next year.
“Sit,” he said, and Tony obediently sat on his haunches at Steve’s feet, hands turned to paws on the ground.
"Well, that's asinine. What kind of idiot doesn't want a foot rub? That-- oh. Oh!" Steve almost sagged in relief that he didn't have to explain further. Then, softly, "And that worked out?"
Steve caught Tony’s hand, wrapped it around Tony’s own bare cock, guiding him as he frantically jerked into their hands. Tony’s eyes were wild and locked on Steve’s face. “Deeper, please, please, it needs you so deep in me, love...” Steve’s fucked Tony relentlessly, one hand guiding his hips as Tony fucked their intertwined hands. “Tony…. I don’t think I can hold back any more…”
He heard Tony’s pants unzip. There’s a pause, as if of consideration, and a soft impact of cloth on the ground, once, twice, thrice. Steve risked a glance out of the corner of his eye. Tony was naked and idly stroking himself.
We had been at this farce for four months then, and it had developed a dynamic of its own. Whenever I thought one of them had finally grown tired of it, it was revived by another. Even Vision engaged in it and called it a team building exercise. Steve seemed to find it amusing by then. And if the white sundress they put on it for Labor Day weekend wasn’t designed by Janet van Dyne herself, I'll straighten my hair and call myself Natasha.
Tony nodded gravely. “I think…” He rolled Steve onto his back, straddling him. “I think it needs me to see your face when we fuck. I bet you’re beautiful when you come.” He started, as if he’d said too much, but Steve only nodded back.
“Yes!” Tony roared, “Fuck me, come inside me, come with me, baby, come with me, Steve…” Steve, helpless, complied, groaning a curse as hot drops of Tony’s come splattered on his chest and Tony collapsed on top of him, pulsing around him.
“What?” Steve could smell Tony’s desire, and he was sure he was making a wet spot on his jeans, but Tony unclasped and took a step back. His pupils were blown, his lips were red and shining with their spit, and he was panting in unison with Steve. Right. There was no lost moment here, and if Steve had to fight to get this back, then… he sank to his knees, eyes locked with Tony’s, licking his lips, sliding his hands down his thighs, making his meaning plain. “Tony…”
Confession time: every year, I root for the Grinch. That holiday’s like and out-of-control juggernaut (with none of the rough charm of the actual villain), distorting family, flight paths, and the economy. It shits on both retail workers and people who don’t personally ally themselves to this one particular god, forcing us to listen to covers of the same twenty songs on a loop twenty-four hours a day. I hate the whole mess. It’s emotional blackmail and hollow loneliness, and the only thing that redeems it is sneaking out to bars at 10 p.m. to bond with fellow escapees, or, these days, the burnt coffee, cigarettes, and fluorescent lighting of an AA meeting. That’s the true meaning of Christmas for you: family. Specifically, escaping family.
“Costumes. Yes, I know. I can’t help but know. In the meantime, some of us are doing real work that nobody can even begin to guess at. Kitty, did you know that I–”
Tony’s eyes went far away for a second. The suit behind him gathered his wrists in one hand, then pushed its fingers through his hair, grabbing and pulling him to his knees with it.
I met up with Sue for skating and cocoa at Rockefeller Center after the war council of the week. You have to take every chance at sweetness you can get when you live where we live.
Seemingly out of nowhere, Professor Xavier was blocking our path with his chair and flailing away with a sledgehammer at the foundations of everything good in my life.
“Oh, hey, you’re naked, when did that happen? No, let me show you what I mean,” Steve said, bodily lifting Tony onto the acceleration couch.
...have an amazing caterer. You think I’m joking, but we once detected an attempted AIM infiltration because those posing as the caterers used crummy store-bought eggnog, even though they tried to punch it up with melted ice cream (no, I’m not kidding) and enough happy drugs to (almost) wipe the scowl off Namor’s face. Stan and Joan have never failed me. I don’t know what I’ll do when they’re gone… aw, who am I kidding? They’re going to live forever, a man, his stunning wife, his appalling mustache, and an army of Brownian-motion berserker-waiters in ink-stained tuxedo pants. (I think he hires directly from CUNY’s arts undergrad program.)
He turned the water off, ran his hands over Tony, smoothing the excess water off of his skin with the blade of his hands. “Stay,” he warned, toweling himself off lightly. He grabbed the hair at the nape of Tony’s neck  “Don’t shake,” he said. Feeling the beginnings of a twitch -- the punishment had been issued, but Tony in pet mode was still Tony, a consummate brat -- “No!” he said, dropping the towel onto Tony’s back to swat his nose lightly with two fingers. He toweled his lover roughly and thoroughly, almost polishing, bringing the blood to the skin. “Collar.” Tony raised himself to his knees, presenting his neck as their private ritual demanded. Steve, for his part, kissed Tony’s Adam’s apple, breathing in the scent of soap-over-clean-Tony, relishing the wave of goosebumps rippling over his arms and shoulders having nothing to do with drafts. He fastened the collar about Tony’s neck, moving to brush his mouth against the peppermint-gagged lips.
--- while part of him wanted to weep---- he was getting the one thing he had wanted more than any other, one wish he never even dared to think of, and this was so
? He has ten seconds, maybe, and it's now or another several decades of soap-opera pining because the timing is never, ever right.
Tony forced himself to look up. There was nothing at all wrong with Steve’s poker face. “Ah,” Steve said. “That… makes sense. I was… anyway. So.”
Steve felt his eyes crinkle around the edges as a thought occurred to him. He unwrapped the briefly-forgotten candy cane in his hand, breaking the hook off and tossing it into the trash a few feet away, licking and sucking the straight part luxuriously as his pet watched with begging, thwarted eyes. “Mm,” he groaned deeply, “so sweet… want a lick... boy?” Tony shuddered minutely. “Practically drooling, aren’t you?” He lowered the cane to Tony’s mouth, let him take a long, slow lick, then, before Tony could mimic Steve’s little show, Steve bent to lick the other side of the sticky confection, their tongues inevitably, enticingly entwining around it. Steve pulled his mouth away, leaning back, and slowly, as if to avoid Tony noticing, moved the cane to line up with his cock. Tony continued to lick the candy, his tongue straying more and more across the skin of Steve’s straining erection. Steve groaned and hissed. “God, boy… this is so bad… so dirty…  if only you could know what you were doing to me… so wrong…” The pace of Tony’s licks quickened as, staring intensely up at Steve, he took his cock into his mouth alongside the stick and sucked. Steve moaned again, the familiar and the foreign moving tightly against his hardness in tandem, fire pooling in his loins and gut. “Stop... stop!” he gritted out before he reached the point of no return. Tony pulled away, reluctantly. Steve glanced down, weighed the evidence at hand, and nodded to himself.
Now, I am completely aware of my reputation in meta and non-meta circles alike for being a bit of a dick. I relish it, in fact. You can’t save the universe without using every means at your disposal and that fact that you’re here to judge me for it absolutely justifies that. But I pay for it, and I am sure I will pay for my deliberately waiting until my wife took a long swig of her hot chocolate before I said, “And, speaking of using the statue to telegraph the state of their relationship, it was completely butt-naked today. I think it will be for a while.”
But--- Certain parts of his background, both before and after the serum, had made being immobilized in any capacity profoundly unsexy to Steve. He rarely had anything so uncouth as a panic attack, but their attempts at BDSM play in that particular direction fizzled at best. Yet here he was, held tight and aching to be touched. “It’s you.”
I’m still waiting for him to try to use some of his beloved tech to make it come alive and love him, since the real Steve clearly doesn’t. Pygmalion 2000.
“Except when they are prescribed. Especially if they are essential to your continued well-being. Or it is a government-sanctioned research project and you get to fight Nazis in the end, just to wake up decades later to join a team of like-minded (most of the time) people, only some of whom have taken (partly government-sanctioned) drugs (others might have taken drugs for recreational purposes, but stopped (probably)(we are not including legal drugs because than we have a whole other discussion on our hands (drug policies are built around economic realities (which might not be a problem, but we are not doing PoliSci here))). As I said nobody is taking any drugs (except the one time we went to the spa and every time Steve got up from the treatment chair his robe was clenched between his buttocks and he tried to free it with a very awkward dance because the nice treatment specialists were looking at him inquiring if he needed something, and I just wanted to get a snapshot of it and didn’t look where I was going and stubbed my toe so hard on a fountain that I broke it, and I had to take painkillers for a week)).”
Clint apparently felt he was a few bad jokes short of his daily quota. “Why are you asking, Giant-Man? Thinking about a costume change?”
Maybe we should just take the damn thing away from Tony and donate it somewhere safe and far away. For everybody’s sake.
Then Steve heard it: the distinctive hum of repulsors powering up. “Tony?” he asked, voice breaking. What if he missed the mark? What if this is a supervillain, a shape-shifter, someone possessing Tony?
, the strange lightness pulsing through him, feeling the edges of his skin limned in joy as Tony bit the back of his neck, hard, the pain and intensity moving him past the edge of some strange horizon. His asshole gripped his lover’s cock as his balls tensed, moving what felt like his whole self through his pulsing, dripping penis, feeling rather than hearing Tony roaring his claim into his spine, clawing at the sheets as he heard himself chanting purifying blasphemies, coming and coming and coming.
Steve leaned back in his chair and watched Tony work his magic, so enthralled in the vision of an idealistic, progressive future that Tony wove for them, that he didn’t notice the very brief scuffle behind him until a rough shout startled everyone in the room.
“No, hey. Steve, it’s all right, he’s not paralyzed. I just don’t want him turning his head and twisting the stitches out until the wound has begun to heal,” Dr. Cho said gently, and Steve made a pathetically relieved sound as he sagged into the chair beside Tony’s bed. He reached up and brushed a lock of Tony’s hair back gently, his other hand curled into a tight fist.
“Jesus, Steve, I want you to wreck me, I mean it. Give me a bloody nose. Fuck me dry. Make cry for real.
“Are you really going to make me beg?” Tony said, and shivered when Steve gave him a half-smile that touched Tony as softly as Steve’s mouth on his body.
Their little evening of fun had started far earlier in the day. The team had a press event to attend, followed by a lovely dinner and dancing, with a live jazz swing band and everything. It was mostly political elbow-rubbing, and by the tail end of the evening, all the important people and press had left, leaving mostly the team, “Avengers by extension” as Tony affectionately called them (also known as his “super-friends,” courtesy of Happy, and hey, Matt Murdock could Lindy-Hop his way around a dance floor better than Tony, so of course he was invited), and various SHIELD staff that they hung around. It was kind of fun, actually, dancing and getting stupid with friends, without having to “behave.”
Steve looked at the neck brace again, then at Tony’s face, anxiety twisting in his stomach about how pale he was.
Tony couldn’t protest, he couldn’t make words with his mind or his mouth. All he could do was take it, but even then, he didn’t quite stop fighting. He struggled, making sure Steve had to fight to get what he wanted, but managed to kick his foot back enough that his heel caught the back of Steve’s head, knocking Steve off balance. Steve fell to the side and Tony got his knees under him, just in time for Steve to kick him in the gut just hard enough for him to roll across the floor and hit the kitchen island hard, unable to stop himself with his arms bound behind him.
“Tony…” Steve whispered between breathless kisses. “I think, I mean all this time, I wouldn’t let myself believe, I- I am. I mean. I do.”
“I’m sorry. I- no one else knows. I didn’t mention it. I just thought something seemed off at the party, and then I overheard him talking to you behind the curtain, and it sounded bad so I followed you home. I figured Jarvis would tell me if there was something wrong, but he didn’t answer, and then- Tony, god I could hear your screams down the stairwell, it sounded like you were dying, and it took forever to find which floor…”
“My usual pithy retorts currently escape me,” Tony whispered by way of thanks, eliciting snorts and exasperated eyerolls. A tired smirk played at the corner of Tony’s mouth as his eyes slid closed, and Steve stood so he could kiss Tony, peppering his face before finally pressing their lips together.
To have his ability to create, to be Iron Man, to build, taken away from him… Steve’s eyes burned at the thought, heart pounding in his throat.
“Tony!” he breathed. “What is- this isn’t my computer!” The casing was a silvery aluminum, rather than black, beat-up, duct-taped plastic. It was thin and light and bright and beautiful and Steve swore he could feel it thrumming with power. Tony tapped Steve’s nose with his index finger.
“A Kodak moment, without a doubt,” Tony said, nudging Steve’s shoulder with his own, before he got up and hopped that fantastic ass over the bar to help make drinks.
“Oh god…” Steve mumbled, stumbling to his feet and lurching to the bathroom, where he barely made it to the toilet before throwing up everything he’d eaten in the last year. He slumped on his knees when he was done, tears streaming as he spit into the toilet.
“Please, baby, I’m sorry, I’m gonna be better, don’t do this,” Tony cried, his voice hitching and helpless, but Steve ignored him, ramping up his pace again until he was fucking Tony so hard that when he finally
Steve half-dragged, half-carried him down a hall, opened a steel door, and threw him into a windowless, concrete room filled with pipes and discarded office tables, with two acidic yellow-green hanging lights that lit the room in harsh, sick tones with black shadows and blinding glare. Steve hit one with his shoulder as he went to a table, and it swung around and around, casting dizzying, disorienting shadows that created a threatening and dangerous atmosphere in the room. Steve yanked some thin cables out of a pile, and went back to Tony, who was trying to back away from Steve, until his back it the wall. Steve said nothing as he reached for Tony’s arms, pulling off his black brocade necktie from around Tony’s wrists, and ripping off the rest of Tony’s shirt with it.
love, so yeah, I guess you could say I don’t particularly love it. Writing gets in the way of what I really love.” Tony leaned forward a bit, interested.
“If I was offended, I wouldn’t be over here using an obscenely sweet drink as an excuse to talk to you,” Tony said in a lower voice that dropped straight to the base of Steve’s spine.
“And here I thought I was trying to woo a guy who was way out of my league,” Tony said softly, and Steve looked up in surprise.
Steve pushed the chair back and stood on shaky legs, bending over Tony and touching their foreheads, comfort flooding him at the scent of Tony’s skin and the humid warmth of his even breathing. Steve closed his eyes.
“It’s not rape when you’re a fucking whore asking for it,” Steve growled, and Tony heard the wet sounds of his fingers in his mouth, then before he could brace himself, Steve had plunged two fingers into Tony as far as they would go, and Tony actually screamed, a protracted, garbled sound that trailed off into helpless, broken noise. He wasn’t stretched, on purpose. He wanted the pain, wanted the burn, maybe even a little blood, but that didn’t mean he was fully prepared for it. And it hurt. A bad hurt, but not one that he wanted to stop. His body tensed and back arched as the tight ring of muscle in his ass was cruelly forced open, feeling like a whole-body leg cramp, multiplied by 100, that radiated from his ass like an inferno. He tried to struggle, but Steve held him fast as he plunged those fingers into him, over and over, only wet enough to get in, but too dry to make it feel like anything other than fire. And hidden under him, pressed against the cold stone floor, he was harder than he’d ever been in his life.
The ride lasted an eternity and the terse orders of the paramedics blurred into a wash of white noise around him, and all Steve could do was stare at how pale Tony’s face was. How his lips were bluish and slack around the ventilating tube that had been forced into this throat. He was frozen and silent until the paramedic pushed at him and he tumbled out of the ambulance. He followed Tony’s gurney into the ER all the way to the door to the surgical wing, before the attending doctor pushed at his chest and told him he’d have to wait until Tony was out of surgery.
“Good. And now that you’ve moaned all over my drink within earshot of at least half my customers, you wanna tell me what you’re writing in here, all day, every day?”
“All right, my darling. Four more times it is,” Tony whispered, smiling against Steve’s lips as Steve enveloped him in his arms.
“No, no way. Uh-uh,” he said, just imagining Tony getting it up and running and seeing all the erotica he’d written of Tony and himself. He imagined Tony reading the adventure story he was currently writing where Tony rescued Steve from a dastardly assassin, only to have to go on the run and fall in love in the process. He would actually die of humiliation. But more importantly, “I can’t afford it,” he said lamely. Tony smiled kindly.
“What?” Steve mumbled, tapping the keys, then hitting the power button, then banging the side of the computer, growing ever more frantic.
“Shh,” Tony said, and settling back against Steve’s hips as he moved lazily, so slow that moss could have bloomed across the freckles and scars on their skin, a network of life as lush as their hearts, as their blood. Tony let his head fall back, his lips parted and eyes closed, a strand of hair clinging to his forehead.
“Who knew that our wholesome Captain America had such a hedonistic streak? Honestly, the words coming out of your mouth. What an absolute scandal. We should definitely do it again sometime. Also… uh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know the utility rooms weren’t soundproofed,” Tony said, nuzzling into Steve’s neck when he laughed.
echoed madly in his head, despite Dr. Cho’s reassurances. She patted his shoulder and assured Steve she would be close by, and left him to his thoughts.
“I could hear you screaming for help, begging for him to stop, dammit Tony, why haven’t you told us? How long has this been going on?”
“Let me,” Tony said, his fingertips pressing into the soft chintz of the armchair, the fabric silky against his bare skin. Steve ignored him from his chair across from him, except to spread his thighs further. Tony was unashamedly lewd as he watched the movements of Steve’s hand, while Steve stroked himself idly, as though only to pass the time.
“Oh. Uh… Tony. Can I call you Tony? Of course I can, I call you Tony all the time… um, I didn’t mean to- I hope I didn’t cross a line, I- sometimes I just stare off into space when I have writer’s block and I-“ Steve was positively drowning in his verbal diarrhea, and Tony just leaned back in his chair and nodded along like an asshole, but Steve would have let Tony step on him if he wanted, for no other reason than because he was so gorgeous. Finally Steve slumped, defeated.
asshole. Look, I gotta get back to work, but you keep coming in and prettying up my shop, and there’s more where that came from,” he said, pointing at the drink, and was back behind the counter before Steve could say anything.
“I’m back, sweetheart,” he murmured, sitting again and taking Tony’s limp hand in his as he sat in the chair. This time, instead of praying, he spoke to Tony in a low, gentle voice, hoping his words would get into the fog that kept Tony from waking.
“Fuck you, get the fuck off me,” Tony spat, and deep inside took glee in the absolutely shocked expression on Steve’s face, before it turned thunderous.
“I can think of a few prettier things,” Tony said more quietly. Immediately, Steve blushed a deep pink, but he smiled for Tony, somewhat crooked and a little dazed, but special just for him.
Steve stared at the screen of his beat-up laptop like it had done him wrong. His brow furrowed and his lips turned down and his long, graceful fingers hovered over the keyboard expectantly, but nothing came to him.
“I love you more,” he whispered, pressing Steve back against the counter and kissing away any other words or thoughts that might interrupt them, much to their mutual delight.
“Fucking pathetic.” And then he bent, grabbed one of Tony’s ankles, and began to drag him to the elevator. “We’re going elsewhere. It’s too comfortable in here for you, and when I’m finished I want to come back and sleep in our bed and not have to listen to your fucking crying.”
“Who is that?” he said, voice shaking. “Don’t- Where’s Steve?” He thrashed, trying to rub his face against his shoulder to get the blindfold off, but the hands were there first, untying it and pulling it down, and Tony’s eyes went wide and utterly mortified to see Natasha looking back at him, a handgun sitting on the floor beside her and another in her thigh holster, visible through the slit in her long gown. “Natasha what the
“It’s not- I- Tony-“ he gasped thickly, but couldn’t get the words out. It wasn’t just that he cared for Tony. He
“Green,” he mumbled roughly, trying to pull himself up to his unsteady feet, realizing distantly that he’d lost his shoes somehow. “Green, green, green, neon green….” He didn’t get fully upright before Steve yanked him back by the collar of his jacket, pushing Tony face down on the ground and holding him there with a knee in the small of his back, and ripped-
A man yelled, his reddened eyes wild and streaming tears, as two guards tried to wrestle him out of the room. “You let my kids die, you rich, worthless piece of shit! You just flew right over them in your goddamned fancy fuckin’ robot suit! You could have saved them! You-
she said firmly, frowning at Steve in what she probably thought was a very authoritative manner. Steve wilted, fists clenching white.
Tony and Peter heard someone called him from behind. They turned around and found Jarvis who stood behind them. Jarvis who realize that Tony was holding Peter’s hand now kneel and smile to Peter.
The sky started to look orange and shade of purple, but it was still bright enough to see. Peter finished his ice-cream quickly and he wandered around again. Their picnic table was near the pond. Steve was quite grateful to find this place and planned to do picnic day here. Jarvis, who has already finished his ice-cream, was standing in front of them.
“If it’s about the meet and greets again, my answer is still same,” Tony said as he lied his back on the couch.
He knew enough about the blacksmith so that from the state of the sword it could be estimated that the sword was more than 5 years old. When he looked carefully at the sword, he could see an orange chain attached from the blade to the ankle of the man's body.
A blond man sat at the dining table on the kitchen, finishing his coffee and his breakfast. He wore a white polo shirt, a baby blue strips tie, and black lash pants. His black blazer was hanging on the chair beside him, with his case under it.
Sam was sure he could see pinkish loving aura from them as he saw Tony, Peter, and Steve on Steve desk. He remembered their message about them and sought a chance to capture the moment with his phone. After that, he sent the photo to the secret group of their friends as he wrote ‘I'm sure I can see pink aura from them'. Suddenly a lot of notification came up. Sam didn't need to check the notifications, he already knew where it came. He cleared his throat to reach their attention.
"Yes, even when he was with your friend too, with Dr. Banner. They didn't even stop talking about biology and science."
Sometimes she didn’t get his son’s mind to like that music so much. Suddenly the lady heard a knock from the front door, and somebody got inside.
“Care to lead me, miss?” Tony said with a glint of a smile. He was really like to join them especially being able to have science time with Peter.
“Hmm ... we have a field t'ip today,” Peter said cheerfully, “We're going to visit Stark Industry and see a lot of ‘obot,” He bounced as he finished telling his day's plans.
“Oh yeah, I remember that clearly,” He said and the Brunette hum winningly. “But Anthony, that’s not the way to treat someone,” Jarvis said sternly.
The man's body had such amazing muscle curves he had never seen. He pushed aside the thought and touched the man's neck. Faint but sure, he could feel his weak pulse there. He reversed the position of the man's body until he was supine and positioned his wings so that it covered the lower body. The man had golden blonde hair and sharp and strong jawbones, leaving aside the horns, wings, scaly tail, and a small portion of scales that appeared on his body.
Before Tony could reply, the blond man sent the photo of Peter which was taken earlier by him. Tony replied, ‘oh Steve, his smile is so beautiful.’
Suddenly Steve moved his hand to Tony's jaw and wiped the ice-cream on his chin with his thumb, and lick it. Tony didn’t know if his brain is still functional or not.
“Oh-oh, we go to fil’d tip today as I said this mo’ning, but I got lost and Tony found me with Mr. Jarvis.” Peter kept describing his experience as Steve move a glace from Peter to Tony to Peter. He could see a smile from Tony face watching Peter explaining to Steve. Tony didn’t do differently. He watched Peter and gave a glance towards Steve either and found Steve was smiling either.
Steve stumbled and fell into the ground. He looked up to a woman who had a disgusted stare upon her face toward him.
“Maybe you should just, uh…” Steve got quiet for a second, handing Clint a plate, “mind your business.” Steve smiled to indicate that he was kidding, putting everyone in the room at ease- he wasn’t exactly one to say things like that.
“Tony?” Bruce questioned softly. There was something about his voice that made people unravel and want to tell him everything. “Do you have feelings for Steve?” Tony ran his hand through his hair, which made it stick up and made him look disheveled. Tony laughed slightly, a sort of cynical laugh, sounding tortured somehow.
“Thank god,” Tony grinned at him, a hint of mischief in his eyes. Steve’s head shot up to meet Tony’s gaze.
“Captain?” Tony sounded surprised and confused but didn’t make a move to leave or even look up from whatever he was working on.
“Steven, you have arrived!” Thor’s voice boomed, making everyone smile. “We may start this film about pirates now!” Steve looked confused, but plopped down on the couch right next to Tony. Tony looked at Steve with confusion, but quickly it washed away.
“Of course I do, Bruce! Who wouldn’t? He’s Captain Fucking America. He’s America’s Golden Boy and he’s living in my house and he’s everywhere all the time being nice in his stupid white t-shirts and he’s a fucking Adonis destroying punching bags in my gym, Bruce, of course I like him!” Tony got more worked up than he intended, and took a deep breath. “Sorry. Um, yeah, I do. How’d ya know?”
Steve ignored it for weeks. After his conversation with Natasha, he started to realize just how much he really did want Tony’s attention, and that realization made him nervous. He didn’t know why- he and Tony weren’t friends. Acquaintances, maybe. Housemates. But they had nothing in common. Steve started to run longer and harder, and tried his very best to think about anything but Tony. After about three weeks had passed, he couldn’t ignore it anymore. He wasn’t sure what it was he was after, but he figured maybe just talking to Tony would do the trick. That being said, he couldn’t think of a valid reason to approach him- everything seemed forced.
“Nice impression,” Tony got out when he caught his breath from laughing. “Well,” he sucked the last of the milkshake out of the cup, tossing it into the trashcan, “thanks for the milkshake, Steve. I should probably get back to work. Good luck with Thor,” he laughed. “What’s the likelihood I’ll end up ordering in for movie night?”
“I just think it’s nice, you know? All of us here together. I know our lives aren’t really normal, but before…” Steve trailed off, and Tony was surprised by the serious turn the conversation took.
“Good morning, Bruce. Breakfast?” Steve offered him a plate, which he took. Breakfast carried on easily after that, Clint and Thor coming in and leaving as soon as they had eaten, as usual. Tony and Bruce filtered out as well, leaving Natasha and Steve alone.
“It’s best not to wake sir in this state, or move him far. I suggest you let him remain where he is, Captain.”
“Tony was fully awake and aware, and he went back to sleep in your bed, I’m assuming cuddling you?” Steve turned pink at that.
“J, heat it up some more,” he scooted closer to Steve, wrapping his arms around Steve’s upper body and pulling him close. Steve didn’t let the blankets go, but Tony held on. “Steve, it’s okay. Steve, I’m here. It’s me, Tony, I’m right here.” Steve’s breathing was still heavy and uneven, and the shivering continued, so Tony just held him. Tony was soon covered in sweat as well, due to the heat of the room added to the natural heat of Steve’s body. After a couple minutes of Steve repeating “cold” and Tony reassuring him, the shivering stopped and his breathing began to slow. Tony didn’t let go, and Steve leaned into his body rather than just being held. The shivering turned into sobs, and he cried into Tony’s shirt.
“Morning, Captain,” he took the plate and nodded in Steve’s direction. “Where is our mighty thunder god this morning?” He questioned to no one in particular, sitting down with his food and a far-too-large cup of coffee.
“Are you and Bruce…” he trailed off when he heard footsteps, and sure enough Bruce walked into the room.
“You’ve really been missing out, Stark. Cap makes a killer omelet,” Clint insisted before shoving a whole slice of bacon in his mouth. A small smile crossed Steve’s lips.
“I was embarrassed,” Steve admitted, looking at Tony with those puppy dog baby blues that made him melt.
“Not a couple yet, Nat,” he pretended to be annoyed but he couldn’t help but smile at that. “Thanks for your secrecy, Banner.”
“Nat…” he took a deep breath, looking at the ground. “Sometimes I have…panic attacks,” her face automatically looked concerned, so he didn’t let himself pause. “It’s honestly not a big deal, it’s been happening since I woke up. I just deal with them and move on with my life, but last night Tony happened to be there when it happened.”
“I’m not trying to be cold towards him, Nat, I just…” he trailed off, not sure what to say. Luckily (or unluckily) for him, Natasha was extremely intuitive.
“Sure, yeah,” Tony offered, heading back towards the bed and laying down. Thanks Steve.” Tony settled back into bed and was practically back asleep when Steve was heading out for his run.
“Yeah, I should. Are you going to bed too?” Steve felt slightly disappointed, but tried not to let it show.
“Mr. Stark ate at approximately 6:39 a.m., Captain. I have reminded him every four hours to eat, and he has ignored me.”
“Steve Rogers, does someone have a crush?” She smirked, happiness in her voice. “Does someone have a crush on our very own billionaire genius?”
“It was good. I mean, not that anything happened, Tony has been dead asleep since you saw him, but it was just nice to have him there, you know?” Steve felt like he was gushing and avoided her gaze, focusing on his cooking. Natasha said nothing and they enjoyed companionable silence for a few minutes until Bruce and Clint came in.
Tony felt himself slowly waking up, but willed his eyes to stay shut just a few minutes longer. He felt more well-rested than he had in ages. He felt incredibly warm, then realized he seemed to be laying on something warm- quite unlike the cold metal of his workbench where he usually ended up sleeping (typically face-down in a pile of papers or amidst a scattered mess of tools). He opened his eyes and realized what he was laying on was another person- Steve. Steve was just laying there, his arm around Tony, looking at him.
Clint said “So many things” at the same time that Tony said “Nothing.” Tony played the movie before anyone else could comment.
“I always have time for you, Stevie,” Tony smiled, gesturing Steve to the big worn out couch. “I’m just working on the plans for Barton’s explosive arrows and next up is an upgraded shield for you,” he continued working while he talked.
“Sure thing. Steve.” Steve left with a smile on his face that stayed there the rest of the night, and he didn’t let himself wonder why.
“Yeah, I was afraid of that. I’m a clingy sleeper,” he stood up. “I’m so so sorry, Steve, it won’t happen again, I promise.”
“Cold. So cold,” his teeth were chattering, yet his forehead was drenched in sweat. He had the blankets all wrapped around him, and it seemed that JARVIS had turned up the heat in the room.
“Steve, he doesn’t hate you. He doesn’t know how to talk to you, and he thinks you’re cold towards him, which isn’t completely untrue.”
Steve cleaned up and took off his apron once he put the lasagna in the oven, and headed up to his room to get dressed. He assumed it would just be like any other time, but once he reached his closet he got nervous, suddenly thinking about what Natasha had said earlier that day and wondering if he should dress up. He remembered what Tony had been wearing when he saw him- sweatpants that accentuated his fabulously round ass with a t-shirt- and decided against dressing up. He put on a pair of light grey sweatpants and a tight white t-shirt that he hoped would make Tony notice him. He made his way back to the kitchen about a half hour later and saw Natasha sitting there with a cup of tea.
“Steve, it’s okay,” Tony stroked Steve’s hair and held him tight. “Everything is okay, Steve. You’re right here with me. I’ve got you. It’s okay,” It took another little while for the crying to calm, and Steve took a few deep breaths, sat up, and wiped his face with his hands.
“Sorry, Captain Emotional!” Clint bellowed after him, after which Steve only heard Clint’s laughter and Natasha and Bruce’s scolding. It was good to know that they cared, and he knew Clint was just joking. He was mad at himself for letting it affect him, but nevertheless he couldn’t sleep. After tossing and turning and dozing in and out for a few hours, he got up and ran until it was time to make breakfast. Natasha was the first one to the kitchen.
Hey guys! I'm so glad people seem to be enjoying the story. Here's the next chapter, as promised! Let me know what you think!
“I don’t know, Bruce.” Tony let his head drop and sighed, bringing a hand to rub the back of his neck.
“Nothing,” Steve sighed. “I went to bed and he went to his workshop and that was it. I mean, not that I expected anything to happen, I just…hoped.”
“I sleepwalk. Last night it just happened to be into Steve’s room. It’s a non-issue,” he shrugged, blowing it off easily. Steve still looked mortified, even though it was just the three of them. “Speaking of noticing things,” Tony began to add, “what’s the deal with you and Barton?”
“You’ll come back, right? You’ll stay?” Tony felt a heat pooling in his stomach at that, and tried to resist the urge to grin, knowing it probably wasn’t the best time. Steve looked like he was embarrassed to ask but he couldn’t help himself.
“Don’t even act like there aren’t a lot of questionable moments in your friendship with Clint,” she rolled her eyes at that. “Tony wouldn’t ever go for someone like me. He was just being a friend.”
“In Tony’s workshop?” Steve looked up in confusion, which he still had a habit of doing on occasion when talking to the AI.
“Language!” she grinned at him, making him sigh and shake his head, but he couldn’t keep the smile off his face. “Steve, you can’t keep running away.”
“OK Peter, that's enough.” Steve didn't know what to do. He never knew that they were really obvious or maybe Peter is to observance. Steve knew that his son was a genius, but he had never known that his observation skills were so good, they were creeping him out. Steve had always known from the start that his cousin,
