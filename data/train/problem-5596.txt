“Custom-made Douglas fir wood paneling will do that,” Tony replied with a small smile. Steve gave him a crooked smile in return, his eyes dancing, bright and blue.  Tony reached out and took half of the chocolate boat, biting off the end.  “S’good.  You take the rest,” Tony said, nudging at the napkin Steve was still holding in the palm of his hand.
“Steve,” Steve corrected. “Please.”
The kiss turned hard, mouths devouring, claiming.  Tony’s hand wound into Steve’s hair, angling his head, and the other was wrapped around Steve’s shoulders, pulling him closer.  Somehow, Steve managed to get his hands between them and fumble at the remaining unopened buttons on Tony’s shirt. He couldn’t get the tiny damn things to cooperate, and he needed to touch Tony so badly, it was all he could think about, so he just pulled, sending the buttons pinging to parts unknown.  He felt Tony’s warm laugh echo against his mouth and smiled, then flicked his tongue at Tony’s lips until they parted again.
“About that,” Tony began, leaning forward so his forearms were braced against the table while he dangled his fork over his plate.
“I didn’t mean it like that.  I just meant it’s impressive.  MIT.  Not because of the…hooker thing,” Steve said around another grimace.  Damn it, words, come on and cooperate just a bit, he thought with a frustrated sigh.
“Who?” Steve cut in.
it.  God, that would have been amazing.  Steve would have felt like--he wanted to say a million bucks, but he was deliberately trying to make light of his thoughts, he knew, because otherwise, it just hurt that his ridiculous schoolboy fantasy wasn’t ever going to happen.
Steve heard in Bucky’s voice in his head, though Bucky had never actually said that to him. He swallowed the words back this time.  What did he care what this man thought of him? Or Brock? What did it matter?
“Not sure. I’ll get an alert as soon as any of those files are accessed,” Tony replied.  “But, if Obie has it, he’s smart enough not to open them himself.  Keep that plausible deniability going until it’s in Pierce’s hands. Don’t worry, though, it’ll happen. Just a couple more days of the whole marriage of inconvenience thing and you’re free to ride off into the sunset on whatever seven large will buy you,” Tony said, throat going tight all of a sudden.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Steve frown, then turn his neck to look out the window.
He smiled, soft and wistful, remembering a time when he and Bucky would scoop up the fat, black tadpoles that hugged the grassy shore of the river back home.   They built homes for them in the muddy bank with the finest furniture made of rocks, reeds and acorns that they could find, but, of course, the creatures couldn’t live like that, as they had found out when they returned the next day and found their charges floating belly up in the beautiful prison he and Bucky had created for them.  He still remembered the terrible guilt that came with harm caused by good intentions.
“Where’s Tony?” Peggy asked.  “I thought he’d be home from that school by now.”  Jarvis, sitting on the sofa across from her, looked down at the cup in his hands, still full, Steve noted, his expression carefully shuttered, which probably answered more than Steve really wanted to ask.
“I am given to understand that you expressed an interest in MIT during dinner the other night,” Jarvis said.
She was quiet for a moment.  It was an old conversation by now.  Why are you here? What could possibly have driven you to try this? What is it you came for?
Steve shifted his stance, bracing his legs apart and moving his hands to clasp together behind his back.  Tony recognized a military stance when he saw one.  “I know you didn’t plan on this happening when you came to SHIELD.  I understand.  You didn’t want to bond.  I’ve read your file.  I know about your life and…how you like to live it.  That’s obviously up to you,” Steve said, mouth flattening into a hard line that looked like disapproval trying desperately not to get out.  Tony stared at him blankly, trying to follow Steve’s line of thought and not how the parade rest stance made Steve’s shoulders splay a bit, stretching the t-shirt across the muscles of his stomach.
“She’s a right good ship you built, Shellhead,” Steve beamed.  Shellhead sniffed in agreement, but Steve could see a bit of color splash over his cheeks as he ducked his head.
“Told you it would be fine,” Steve said with a low chuckle.
“I think that you did exactly what you needed to do.  I think your mission was a total success,” Tony told him. “Thing is, no version of me would let you do something like that. Not alone. Not without me. Which means, whatever this future was, I wasn’t there. And we failed. We failed badly enough that you did something that stupid, trying to fix it.  So, what I think,” Tony said, his words coming out shaky, “is that you succeeded. You didn’t need the Tesseract to fix the future. You needed us. Together. Maybe the universe knew that. Maybe there’s some cosmic power trying to get us to get our shit together, I don’t know. But, I know one thing.  This—you and me—this was meant to be. I told you. I’ll find you. Across time, across space, whatever it takes, I’ll find you. And you’ll find me. I believe that with every fiber of my being. You found me, when you weren’t even supposed to be looking,
“He says they are nothing. Just a few notes on the keep and drawings of no consequence. He says you are welcome to look at them, if you like,” Yinsen told him.
“Yes,” Pepper replied.
Steve could hear Tony edging towards panic, running his hands through his hair, mouth opening and closing, clearly trying to find some explanation that didn’t involve…what was on the poster Steve was currently holding in his hands, and okay, ew, he really needed to put this down now, but he could only stare at it while Tony choked out a stilted attempt at an apology about how wrong it was, what Tony had been doing, and how sorry he was and how it wouldn’t happen again… Steve’s head was ringing with little more than the idea that Tony thought of him…like this, but he managed to finally focus on what Tony was saying when Tony called what he’d been doing physical thing, causing a fission of panic to spike through Steve’s belly.  If that was all this was…if he’d been wrong about his assumption about Tony’s reaction this morning…he had to know.  It was clearly killing both of them to dance around…whatever this was.
“How about—“ Tony started, because he was all about compromise.
The familiar walk to Tony’s chambers was largely barren, save for the guards outside his door and  a servant hurrying through one of the compound’s corridors with a stack of precariously-balanced trays in his hands, who jumped aside and bowed his head so as to lower his eyes as Steve passed.  When Steve reached the doors to Tony’s rooms, he hesitated, stomach clenching with nerves that he quickly pushed away.
“Of course, Sir.  Ms. Potts has already requested I monitor social media, and I’ve prepared several algorithms for maximum exposure,” the voice said.
“Maybe,” Steve said, drawing out the word then taking a sip of the champagne.  “Never really imagined something happening with you, to tell you the truth.  Just, you know, the dance thing. Get paid, get out. The usual. Didn’t really expect you’d be,” he waved a hand in the air in front of him, which Tony supposed meant a hell of a lot more than Steve bargained for in negotiating a lap dance. “I don’t know what I expected.  Not this, though.  You, me,
“It’s fine. Forget it.  I just wanted you to know. For the—the whole press thing,” Tony said quickly.  “In case.  I mean, probably not.  But, just let Dad know, I guess.  Okay?  I’ve got to go.  Stuff to do, you know?  Tell Mom I said hi.”  He clicked it off before Jarvis could respond, watching the screen go to black and then back to his homescreen.
Terror warred with a sort of eerie fascination.  This was first contact. He, Tony Stark, proud owner of the actual Captain’s chair from bridge of the U.S.S. Enterprise, which he definitely did not sit in and occasionally give orders, was making first contact with an alien species.
Steve leaned forward, bracing his arms on either side of Tony, then dipped his head and placed a kiss to the center of the disc. It was warm against his mouth, where he had expected coldness, heated from Tony’s body, and that thought made him grow even harder against the ties of his breeches. His tongue flicked out, tasting, the sharp tang of the metal, almost like blood, he thought. It was beautiful. Every part of Tony was beautiful in some infinite way that he couldn’t describe, but knew as he knew the stars and the moon. A man on the shore, holding the moon in his hands, Steve thought again, the refrain ringing with longing and the sureness of safety, acceptance. Home. Above him, he could hear Tony’s low, stuttering half-gasp that turned into a moan as Steve’s mouth moved down, tongue darting out again, this time over the raised skin that held the disc in place.
“Oh, dear Lord, that’s your whole fucking relationship in like seven sentences,” Clint observed, shaking his head in dismay.  “Muffin?” Clint offered hopefully.
“You—you could?” Steve asked, dumbfounded for a moment.  “You’d help?
“Steve,” Tony groaned.  “Alpha.
Right here was glorious, actually, Tony decided, feeling his whole body go limp.  Honestly, what were a couple of scraped knees, really?  He let his chin drop down to his chest and felt a low rumble of a groan in return from Steve, sending a fresh rush of warmth between Tony’s legs.  Tony brushed his hips back experimentally, feeling the hard length of Steve’s cock press into the curve of his bottom.  Steve’s arm tightened around Tony’s waist, holding him there, and fuck, yes, this.  More of this, Tony thought with a helpless moan.
“She’s going to have donuts, isn’t she?” Steve asked, pulling back a little and looking down at Tony.  “Admit it, you’re ditching me for donuts.”
“Because you’re perfect,” Tony replied quickly.
Steve.”
“Would you have coffee with me?” Steve asked.
“See? And you thought you didn’t plan accordingly,” Steve replied with a soft smile. “Sleep, Tony,” he urged, but Tony’s eyelids were already drooping closed, his breathing starting to even out against Steve’s chest.
Still, wasn’t like he hadn’t been playing digital Hardy boy when he had the chance.  Once you knew your way past the various firewalls and controls every operating system came equipped with, or had a handy Alpha passcode, whatever, the internet offered a rather gory history of the government’s endeavors with human experimentation, from injecting soldiers with cancer cells to radiation to mustard gas.  LSD.  Retroviruses.  Project Rebirth.  San Quentin.  The Guatemala syphilis experiments. Tuskegee.  The Stateville Penitentiary Malaria Study. Operation Sea Spray.  Project SHAD.  The New York Subway experiments.  The list went on and on.  And that was just the stuff they owned up to.  So, sure, it was possible the Army or SHIELD or some government whack-job dosed Steve up with a drug cocktail that made him go all by-the-powers-of-Grayskull when he got testy.  Could happen.
.  How do I go out into the light again without something?  Something between me and that happening again?  No answer came to him, not this thousandth time he asked any more than it had the first, lying there in that hospital, still tasting the grit of sand in his mouth while Steve cradled him in his arms and told him this terrifying thing Tony made burned like a star.
“You should find out what the King likes and do that,” Cam added.  “He’d like it, I bet. If you did.”
“Howard will realize there’s more to this thing than some random Army Captain deciding to Bond.  Believe it or not, I’m not in the habit of personally negotiating Bonding contracts,” Fury replied, giving Steve a sharp look under his brow.  “Shocking, I know. But, to answer your question, no. Your identity is still highly classified. I’m sure you understand why,” he added, eyes narrowing.
kept on changing.  He couldn’t seem to stop himself.  When he woke up, there was this buoyancy that followed him throughout the day.  He stopped measuring every, single word for correctness, stopped worrying that every action was going to lead to an equal and opposite reaction, and slowly found himself feeling like he was crawling out from under an invisible weight he hadn’t known he was carrying.  Sometimes, it would come crashing back on him, slamming into his chest with enough force to knock his breath out, when he said or did something he knew he shouldn’t.  Except…except, nothing.  Nothing happened.
“And don’t talk to
Just something to take the edge off, Steve mentally repeated slowly to himself, then let his head fall back against the wall behind him with a solid thunk.  He blinked up at the water stains on the ceiling, then let his eyes fall shut for a moment.   He could remember everything.  One of the serum’s blessings and curses.  He could remember how one edge of Tony’s mouth would tug up and his eyes would narrow, almost in speculation, and he’d roll his lips together sometimes when he was looking at Steve, and he could remember the way Tony’s hands felt on his neck and shoulders or combing through his hair, and how
“This was always what you wanted,” Bucky continued as if Steve had not spoken.
anything.  He’d come to that realization years ago.
Steve glanced guiltily at his phone sitting on top of a towel on one of the weight benches. Technically, he didn’t know if the number would even work. Probably, it wouldn’t. Did he want to do that again? He wasn’t ashamed, not exactly. There wasn’t anything wrong with it. After all, Tony had been the one… but, still. He was the leader. The one who was supposed to keep it together, and then this—this thing inside him wanted… no, needed this. Wasn’t that a weakness?
“Fair point,” Rhodey agreed.  “Anyway, no, never heard of it.  Since I’m assuming by now you know exactly what Romotive Group is, give over.”
“No sauce for you,” Tony said under his breath, leaning his head over close to Rhodey’s ear.
He sighed and switched his stance to lead with his left hand, letting the rhythm of the jabs echo in his head, trying to clear his mind to nothing but the feel of his hand hitting the bag.  It usually worked.  But today…today, it seemed like each strike, each scrape of knuckle across the hard weave of the bag just reverberated in his head with a chant of
“Guinness should talk to you about motivation,” Steve suggested, straightening up and taking a long look that dragged molten-hot over Tony’s skin.  He lined up the club, took a single practice stroke, then swung it back, over his shoulder, muscles moving and bunching around the perfect arc of his swing as it connected with the ball.  The ball shot high over the railing, disappearing into the sky.  Tony snapped the faceplate down and took off after it.  He caught it at just over a mile and three-quarters, as it started to fall back to earth.  When he got back to the deck, Steve was tapping the golf club against the rug, where threads had been torn out of the weave like a divot.
His hands were roaming up and down Steve’s chest, though Steve noticed his eyes kept lighting on the medal—
“Got it in one,” Tony said after a beat.  He looked across the table at Steve and waited.  “He supports more protections for Omegas after an Alpha breaks the Bond.  Financial support, at least.  Some kind of temporary stipend, just so, you know, they’d have some time to deal with things.  Because, it’s hard when you—they--don’t have money and can’t really work, so a lot of times, they have to Bond again or go back home to their parents, or—or other stuff.  That’s a—that can be hard,” Tony stammered as he twisted the tines of his fork around on his plate, making a dull, clicking sound that seemed to be the only thing he could hear over the pounding in his ears.
Be nice.  Be polite.  Be good.  Smile. Play along to get along.  Different verse, same as the first, Tony sang in his head with a frisson of bitterness racing down his spine and settling low in his stomach.  All his life, he’d been told that was the path to happiness.  Conformity.  The, the past few weeks, he’d been doling out these small shards of himself, piece by piece, until he almost felt like he was…existing?  No.  Present.  Here.  As himself, in a way he hadn’t been in, well, probably forever.
“You heard that?  Of course, you did.  That’s how...anyway, so, ah, I have questions,” Tony added, stepping into the room and idly tapping at one of the paneled screens.  It lit up, showing a star chart that he didn’t recognize and what looked like vectors and coordinates.
“Hey there, you,” Brock said by way of greeting.  “Give us a hand with this?”
“Did you not think I was serious?” Barnes asked, pulling an exaggerated look of disbelief.  “Steve, don’t get your panties in a wad over Estes, for Christ’s sake.  Tony, Steve thinks it’s awesome, he just needs a bit of time to get his head around it, okay?  People don’t usually do stuff like that for him, so he’s freaking out a bit.  It’s always him taking care of other people. Case in point, here. He’ll get over it.  Steve, please let the nice billionaire who is clearly head over heels do some crazy, rich-people shit for you.  Fight for your honor or whatever.  Jesus, Steve, you’re killing me with this fall on your sword thing, man.  Come on, live a little, would you? The guy had it coming, and you know it,” he finished, saluting Steve with a barbecued chicken wing.
“I...me, too, Tony,” Steve replied.  He let out a long sigh and wet his lips, looking away.
?  How is this even possible?  Captain America died.  Everyone knows that.  Like…seventy years ago.  Seventy years, Steve.  Is it…time travel?  The Einstein-Rosen Bridge?  You talked about that, at dinner that time.  Is that it?” Tony questioned, mind whirling.  It could be possible.  Theoretically, at least.  If he squinted at what they knew about physics.
Steve closed his eyes for a moment, feeling the familiar punch to his stomach that came with the memory.  It was too much. Too much loss. Too much grief. The scale of it was unimaginable. If Steve thought about it too much, he supposed he might go mad, though what was this last-ditch gambit, if not madness?  He sometimes wished he had gone with Nat, off to look for Clint, but he hadn't felt like he could leave anymore than she could stay.
“Maybe it works like Beetlejuice, and if I say it enough, someone will pop out and explain all of this to me,” Tony muttered, sucking in a deep breath.
“Run away, King’s
I like the stripper I’m faked married to.  The one I’m paying to be all handsy and adoring.
This is how I will show you my regard, with flowers and the heads of those who would hurt you, Steve thought to himself with a blazing sort of realization that stole his breath away.  I could love him.  This terrifying, beautiful man. I can’t.  I won’t.  But, I could. It would be so very easy.
“I—yes.  Once.  When I was a kid,” Steve replied.
Whatever Brock said, until now at least, it wasn’t as bad as the things he sometimes told himself, and so it had felt better than it had any right to feel, at least until someone showed him that there was a version of the world where it didn’t need to feel like that at all.  Maybe without that, without
“Fine,” Steve said after a long moment where he seemed caught between wanting to argue and begrudgingly agreeing with the logic.  “Thank you, Tony,” he added with a slight sigh.  He rubbed at his forehead with one hand, then gave Tony a lopsided smile.  “Do you always get your way?”
“Clint’s a hedonistic, self-centered, morally bankrupt, gutter-dwelling, sarcastic little shit,” Bucky said.  “And he hates what he does, Steve.  He’s wanted out for ages, but he’s been doing this since he was younger than he should’ve been, but it put food in his and his sister’s bellies when their Dad spent his Friday paycheck on booze and smokes by Sunday.  He sends money back to her, you know.  Even though he hasn’t seen her since he dropped out of school and got the hell out of that house.  She’s got three kids, another on the way, no husband, and Clint’s one of the last two good guys left in the world.  He’s been saying he’s going to get out of this for the whole three years I’ve known him, and here we are.  Everyone’s got a reason they got into this.  You gotta have a reason to get out,  and I see how you get when you go to see him.  If that reason needs to be me giving you a ‘hard time’ about it, then fine.”
“Nat-“ Steve started.
Even Tyber did not dare risk the power of the spirits.  But, he did insist that the Stranger was not to stay in their cave, and so Anto had led them here, to what he thought of as his cave, small and hidden behind two felled trees, where he had spent the time of his banishment.  It seemed fitting, in a way Anto couldn’t quite describe, to have the Stranger here, though for so long, he had kept the knowledge of his cave secret, even from Jhrvis. Even from Maara, before she walked with the spirits. He told her then.  He thought she seemed pleased.
“Want to tell me how come I’m sitting here and not headed back to Manhattan, crying on Rhodey’s shoulder?” Tony asked carefully.   Steve was quiet for a long moment, looking down at the bottle of beer he held in his good hand.
“Just some clean-up. He’s already clotting.  And did you notice the skin on the top staples?  Wound’ll be closed up by the morning, you wait.  I’d dose him with an antibiotic, but…” the doctor shrugged somewhat helplessly.  “This is highly irregular, you know.”
“As am I,” Bucky offered, keeping his gaze in front of him, into the treelline of the forest in the distance. Tony didn’t reply, but Steve heard him suck in a shuddering breath, and felt the warmth of Tony’s hand against his, not holding it, just touching.  Tony reached beneath his tunic and pulled out a small rock, cratered and pitted with a gleaming silver metal Steve would recognize anywhere.
Even if it wasn’t real.
“The one and only,” Tony smiled, ignoring the man’s proffered hand. “This is Ms. Potts and Colonel James Rhodes, U.S. Air Force.”
“No,” he said, surprising himself as the word actually
“Something like that.”
, yes.
“Sorry,” Carol repeated quickly. “The others wanted to leave soon, and Sam fixed breakfast.”
Tony stilled, his jaw tightening. He put the key into the door, turning it around twice. “I didn’t ask for details.”
Out of patience, he fisted his hand in her red hair, then pulled her up slightly and kissed her, breathing in through his nose as they both gasped. Letting go, he trailed his hand to her waist, then down to her ass to push her into his erection. They broke the kiss for a moment, moaned, and quickly moved back in, sucking, biting and consuming one another.
Tony echoed, and he sounded genuinely shocked. “What the
A low moan left Steve’s lips as he pressed his eyes closed.
Clint rose to his feet, stepping in front of Natasha and staring straight into Tony’s eyes. “Don’t you dare tell her she was only pretending. Don’t you fucking dare spit that into her face, asshole.”
“I…” Tony stopped, frowning. “You know, my sex-fantasies don’t usually ask that many questions. Come on, I’m
“Steve,” Tony prompted very gentle. He leaned in, then slowly, hesitantly, kissed him. “I love you,” he breathed against his lips.
“Not so bad for an old man,” Tony teased, his thumbs skimming the waistline of the pajama pants, dipping inside a little, brushing through the coarse hair underneath.
"Sounds dangerous," Steve teased. He loved feeling Tony's slow, languid waking, and he had the feeling Tony would've loved to stay in bed all day like this, but some things were pressing enough that it just wouldn't do. Breakfast was only one of those things, so Steve leaned over a little to press a kiss to Tony's lips and held him for a brief moment before rolling them over.
to know.
Barnes rolled his eyes that, and Tony almost didn’t trust his eyes when he saw a tiny smile rising to his lips. “He always was kind of a drama queen.”
Steve nodded, pulling Tony in again, when someone cleared their throat to their left.
. He ordered the parts on his private account. There was no need for Obi to know about this, he figured. It wouldn’t exactly be something that’d pique his interest.
Steve shook his head and straightened his back, glancing at his friend with a sardonic smile. "I try not to."
Totality. There it was. The black sun was surrounded by a celestial bluish orange halo—the solar corona.
of his boots landing heavily on the roof of their car.
The intensity of the lights around him left his retinas throbbing, black spots peppering his vision like falling snow. He clamped his eyes shut and, clutching the edges of the hard-packed cot in front of him, waited for the world to stop spinning.
Tony returned the smile as he let Steve pull him into a hug. “Looking for seconds?” he asked, grinning as he pulled them flush together. “Ian’s upstairs with Veronica. I’m game if you are.”
He nodded in place of words, tucking himself back into his boxers before he could grow hard again. With their scents lingering together, it was difficult not to imagine what it could be like. Every day like this. Hours in unending ecstasy.
“He wouldn’t take shit from anyone,” Bucky added, then grinned. “So yeah, he was you.”
“Kinda miss seeing you in that undersuit.”
"Shut up, Barnes," Steve retorted, finally, regretfully, pulling back. He turned to look at Tony as he did. "Lunch tomorrow?"
The covers were pushed aside and Steve urged Tony to let go of himself so he could take his place. "Tell me if you need me to stop at any point." He was stroking him slowly. There was no turning back for him now. If Tony didn't stop him, they were going to go all the way.
“James!” Natasha yelled, trying to get a grip on his shoes, but Bucky was out of reach in the blink of an eye.
“Where am I,” he choked, wretchedly.
“And what happens when the shooting starts again?” Tony snarls. “I won’t let you kill my team-members. Do you want Captain America’s blood on your hands?”
Agent Romanoff considered him, and whatever she found in his expression seemed to convince her. “It was a boat,” she said. “We sent a diver down to inspect the bottom of the ship. See if we could keep it afloat. He came across the hull of another boat… a little sailboat.”
Steve grinned, ignoring the fact that he was still buttnaked—not that his husband would mind, of course. He wrapped his own arms around Tony’s waist, raising him up a little, as he met his kisses with fervor.
you’re going to bring them
“The only specific I have is that they like to tinker with machines… There was nothing they talked about more. But that’s not exactly something I can write in that internet of yours and expect an answer, is it?”
“Was that a yawn?” Tony asked on an amused chuckle.
Steve lowered his gaze, a slight movement, eyes set on Tony's neck. He forced a small smile onto his face. "It's… not something you should have to carry, Tony," he said, not unkindly, wrapping an arm around Tony's shoulders, pulling him close. He didn't trust himself enough yet to pull him into a full hug.
. It was a simple word, unmistakable in its meaning, and yet… it echoed through Steve’s brain repeatedly until he could finally grasp it.
to make the decisions for Stark Industries in the future. Can you do that for me?”
told anyone about him before.
TS 2:55 A.M.>Also, sorry about the cute blonde comment
“I got heat signatures,” Tony told them.
Steve almost wanted to ask him not to shave—he had grown strangely fond of that beard, as unkempt and wild as it was, but he knew Tony would want to go back to normal as soon as possible.
A long sigh shuddered through Tony’s body as he rolled onto his side, facing away from Steve. “I’m not in the mood for talking right now. I’m tired. Good night.”
“Don’t say it’s too late,” Tony whispered once he drew back. “We have this moment, don’t we?”
“Steve.” Bucky’s voice was quiet, and he put a gentle hand on his arm. “You’re both going to be fine.”
“No, we broke up before we got to that point,” Tony explained calmly, as if reading his thoughts perfectly. “She didn’t design it herself, we hired someone for that and just…
Inside the office, Fury diplomatically offered to show Steve what the Intel was related to. Steve nodded his compliance and made to follow. There were no words. No exchanges. Talking with Fury these days always left Steve with a sour taste in his mouth he couldn’t fully comprehend. And his gut feeling hadn’t lied to him. Steve pursed his lips as he looked up at the new generation Helicarriers and their new weapon system.
When he walked out of the penthouse’s bathroom a good ten minutes later, JARVIS alerted him quietly of Bucky’s presence in the living room. Steve pulled on briefs and a t-shirt and slowly walked through the short hallway, only coming to a stop right before the last corner.
Tony huffed, waving a hand. “Well then,” he answered. “Do enlighten us.”
JARVIS was flashing him a notification that everything was already prepared and Tony forwarded it to all of his teammates:
He didn’t know how much time had passed before the car came to a stop. Tony groaned as Bruce nudged him gently. “Sorry, I need you to stay awake.”
“Do you think… when I’m back home, when the war is over… that we can meet in person?”
Tony’s eyes almost bogged out of his face. “M-married?” He released a surprised laugh. “No, I’m… trust me, I’m as far from ‘married’ as you can possibly imagine. I’m the least-married guy in the world right now. It’s… look, maybe I should tell you that I’m not exactly marriage-material. If there was a certificate for that, I’d have three.”
that it’s okay to use the arc reactor as an opportunity to bring weapons back in the picture. I’m done playing their golden goose. They need to learn to work for their money instead of trying to blackmail me.”
—he knew one thing beyond any shred of uncertainty: He wanted Tony to be his. To know that he belonged to him. He wouldn’t have dreamt of it before, but now…
He fidgeted a bit at that but said nothing. It wasn’t that easy, not by a long shot, but Steve obviously wouldn’t budge on this. And whenever his mind was set on something, Steve could be as unmoving as Mount Rushmore.
Wanda and Pietro were still standing side by side next to the cradle, looking down at it thoughtfully. Wanda had that determined, troubled look on her face, but she seemed otherwise calm. The two talked quietly from time to time, their words foreign to Steve’s ears, casting short glances at the team. They didn’t look exactly guilty, but there was regret on their faces, and Steve decided that it would be enough for now.
curious about the infamous workshop. After they’d talked about it, Tony had never mentioned it again… but maybe, once he’d set foot in there again, he’d find a few of the parts he’d lost of himself after Indries’ death.
“You’re not…” Tony echoed, but couldn’t go on.
“I know,” Steve said. “Believe me, I know, and I appreciate it. You took us in, gave us a home when you didn’t have to.”
“Yes,” Tony said. “I drove a car when I took Driver’s Ed, okay? Stop freaking out.”
By now, his mind had sort of caught up with the idea that he’d once more travelled to the future. He’d heard Bruce and Tony talk about time travel before, but it had only been a theory, something they’d joked about, nothing that could actually
Tony frowned, then tapped on the screen, and FRIDAY’s voice resounded. “The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within a day after your request, boss. He was met by this man.”
“And I’d be right not to!”
“What do you think will happen now?”
The idea was still a little too big to grasp. Sometime before this thing with Barnes had happened, when their lives had been a bit more peaceful, the thought had etched itself into Tony’s brain. That now that he had Steve, maybe he could think about all those things he’d never allowed himself to think of before.
Steve couldn’t sign the Accords, but he wouldn’t let Tony go there alone either. Too long had he allowed for all those political weights to be pressed down on Tony’s shoulders and his shoulders alone. No more. This was something they all had to deal with together. They might disagree on this now, but it was a decision they would have to reach together, and staying home in New York and sulking over this wouldn’t help the matter.
Sam and Natasha were shaking their heads in tandem.
“What is it?”
Steve nodded. Drinking, like so many things, seemed to be a new part of his life, as well.
of the news with his friend. And apparently, the guy was fine with it. “Yeah, sounds good,” he said eventually, looking back up at Steve. He still had his arms around Tony, keeping him near.
Tony nodded dazedly. “Yeah, I… yeah.”
Bucky stared at the ground for a long minute, then shook his head. “They put me in the cell, and… the soldiers weren’t there, it was just that doctor. He had a book with him. He… he said something to me. I can’t remember what, I…” Suddenly, his eyes were awash in remembrance, trained on his metal hand. “He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where.”
Maybe, Steve suddenly thought—maybe when all of this was over, they could be friends again.
Tony nodded, his face serious. “I sent you all the recent draft, along with commentaries on what changes I still plan to push through. Ross isn’t exactly helpful but the past weeks have shown that it’s something that can be achieved.”
Tony opened his mouth to defend their case, to smooth over the situation as he was used to do—but then something happened. Something that hadn’t happened in a whole long while: His mind went utterly, completely blank.
A stab of nervousness went through him that Tony stomped down immediately. It would all work out. They had put so much effort into this, it just
He was in love with her. He had only gotten glimpses of it in all the lifetimes before when love had seemed impossible, but he knew so now. It was warmth that came without fear or doubt. Nat was curled around him, naked and soft. He had thought he was too jaded to feel like this anymore, but he had been wrong. Nat had given color to a heart worn with blacks and grays. And yes, he loved her. Somehow, even while forgetting her, she had always had his love.
Tony followed suit with his own glasses, and his eyes were tense. His lips were pressed into a tight, straight line, the corners pointed with strain. “I liked it,” he said, as if forcing the words out.
“Sorry for that little stunt. I just… needed to know if you remembered.”
Steve’s heart was already beating ten times faster, infinitely excited about finally seeing Tony again. And when he did, Steve had to pause and just look at him for a moment. Of course, Steve had seen Tony at school, but never longer than a few seconds, so Steve ran rapid updates on his mental file: Tony sported shaded sunglasses Steve hadn’t seen before, skinny jeans and brown sneakers. His dark hair was shower-wet, and he was wearing a cardigan buttoned over an obscure-organic-coffee-brand T-shirt. He looked so…
“No,” Tony said with a gentle voice. “No, it doesn’t. I’ll tell you the whole story at some point, but for now, I really wanna touch you some more.” And then, because it was still
Truth, it seemed, was easy to overlook in the face of its overwhelming simplicity.
“With the right handling, the Oufros Alder can be quite helpful,” Thor said with an indulgent smile, but he reached into the chest and handed Clint a vial anyway. “Drink it all at once, the effect should be immediate.”
“Uh-uh,” Tony started, and let himself fall back into the chair, “And you know that I could just track your location, right?”
Steve let go of the claw when Tony moved in for a hug. He was laughing because at least Tony was self aware, and apparently his creation was already imitating him.
And with that, the next hour was a blur of easy conversation and Bucky let himself dive into this feeling of normalcy. It all felt surreal, all of them being together once more, and there was still a bit of a tension beneath the chatter and smiles, but he had a feeling that would fade soon enough. Vision and Wanda were talking quietly next to the stove, Bruce and Pietro animatedly discussed traditional apple pie recipes while Scott was busy nibbling at apple slices. Steve and Tony were standing so close to each other it was a wonder they were getting anything done and Sam and Rhodes were in the living room, playing hide and seek with Ian.
“Ask FRIDAY about him.”
“As I said, Mrs. Stark was a very unstable character. Rejoicing one day and distraught on the next. If she had her reasons… yes, I could see her killing herself.”
Tony sighed, but squared his shoulders. “I’m gay. I’m into… guys.”
After a few minutes, Steve’s finger slid into Tony with much less resistance, and Steve pulled off Tony’s cock to pour more lube on his fingers. He took a moment to commit the way Tony looked right then to memory. His skin was deeply flushed, his lips red from where he was biting down on it. His eyes were blown wide as he regarded Steve.
He caught Tony's lips in a quick, deep kiss, then grabbed hold of his hand. "Come on," he said as he led Tony to the bathroom.
Tony blinked and sat up straighter. He ignored the pain that jabbed abdomen for no reason other than it was there and wanted to be remembered. Steve was staring at him with such raw intensity that he nearly forgot everything else. “I wasn’t
“Groot loves me,” Tony objected.
TS 3:47 A.M.>Goodnight, Steve
It also made this ten times harder.
“Okay, first, I’m flattered that you trust me and I will love to do this for you. So. Much.” He cast Steve a warm smile and leaned up on his toes to press two reassuring kiss against his lips. “And secondly, you, Captain Muscle, might be able to fuck me against this wall, but I’m pretty sure I couldn’t even carry you in a life and death situation, and I definitely want to look at you when this happens.”
“I agreed to work with you on the Accords,” Steve urged.
But he shook them off and smiled. “Of course. It’s… too much, really. I don’t deserve any of this.”
Tony shrugged. “You choose.”
With that, Steve claimed his mouth, tasting him, leaving nothing to question, and the taste had Tony drunk within seconds. The full want of feeling—knowing and accepting that Steve was there, that he had not left him—had Tony’s nerves seeking physical verification. The softness of Steve’s lips against his, the full feel of him wrapped around Tony… it all quickly drove his senses into over-drive, and overwhelmed him so fast that he felt he couldn’t take it all.
,” he breathed.
He knew how he must look. With the bruises and cuts that the medics had stitched together but that were swollen nevertheless.
He could still feel it. The pressure of the shield jammed down right above his heart.
would do.
“And I need to close my eyes for that, because…”
“You can do this, Steve.”
Tony stared at the conference room video feed from his console in the workshop, the pieces of armor strewn about his worktable all but forgotten.  He should go in there.  Natasha and Wilson were with him, so it wasn’t like Steve was alone, not exactly, except that he looked at all of them like they were familiar strangers, and Tony hated it, this distance that had ebbed away so slowly that he hadn’t quite realized the loss of it until it was back.  Still, he should go offer to help, at least let Steve know he was working on it.  He had promised, after all.
Steve looked over at him, eyes slanted and dark as his face pulled into something so fragile, Tony wanted to hold his breath.  “Thank you, Tony,” Steve said, voice scraping out of his throat.  “I—” he started, then huffed out a breath and looked away.  “I don’t know why it matters so much.  That you like him, I mean.  Not like the two of you will really be hanging out.  I mean, you don’t have to like him, obviously.  It’s just a few minutes, right?  I know that, I do. Sorry, I’m just---he’s my best friend.  And everyone who meets him now just sees this person who I know he hates being, and it makes it worse for him, that this is how people think of him, and—I just didn’t want that to be you, I guess.”
“JARVIS, can you open the door please,” Steve called, unconcerned about the crowd of spectators that had gathered behind him.
“Do you think I’m ugly?” Steve asked, his voice gentle.  Tony shook his head. “You’re beautiful,” Steve told him.  “Beautiful Tony.” Tony flushed, warm and tingly. He wasn’t sure if it was true, but he
“Other than my houseguest and the club, it’s the only other number Steve has dialed regularly in the past six months,” Tony explained.
“You think that’s too much power for Rand to have,” Bruce guessed.
“See?  Everyone’s in agreement,” Pepper said, biting back a laugh.
“So...you know who I am,” Stark said, spreading his hands wide in acknowledgment. “And you are, let’s see…” he glanced down at his phone,” Steve Rogers, former Army Captain, two tours, honorably discharged, all kinds of commendations--very impressive, by the way--and recent School of Visual Arts drop-out. That’s quite the resume.”
“Yeah, exactly!” Rumlow added.  “Real nice.  You could use a bit of fun, right?  Hell, Cap, I hardly ever see you leave SHIELD.  It would be good for you. Get out, let loose a bit, you know? Live a little, man.  God knows, you could use it. No offense.”
“Yes, this is for you,” Tony said, holding up a long, thick metal phallus that curved slightly upward and had a strand of perfectly cut pearls, each as big as a large berry, on the end that swung down against Tony’s arm.  It was exquisitely crafted, with a rounded head and small slit, and even veins running up and down the side of the shaft.  He knew, of course, whose cock it was modeled after, and that thought, that Tony had ordered this made, knowing what he would use it for, wanting to use it, that was enough to make Steve’s cock swell against the cage around it.  Steve made a garbled sound in the back of his throat.  Tony hummed in response, coating the plug in oil until it dripped with it, then walked back over and stood at the foot of the bed again where Steve’s ass hung in the air.  Without preamble, Tony pushed an oil-slickened finger inside Steve’s hole, making him jolt with the sudden intrusion.
He dropped the knife back on the table and headed out the door.  Steve was standing over on the deck, staring out at the mountains where they rippled in the afternoon sun.  A part of him wanted to turn away, walk to the garage and shut the door.  A part of him always wanted to do that, but he thought it might not be the best part of him, just the loudest, sometimes, shouting down the rest until he could get somewhere he didn’t need to shout to be heard.  He hated loud voices.  He didn’t know why he listened to his own.
Nope. Not at all.
“This is weird,” Steve said after a moment.
“I heard he was so overcome with remorse, he even created a website where he confessed to his crimes,” Steve continued.  Really, Steve’s faith in humanity was one of his best qualities, Tony thought.  “What was that name again?  It had such a nice ring to it. Oh, right.
This is what bittersweet feels like, Tony thought, with a deep, aching tug in his chest where his heart tried to close that gap all on its own.
“Really?” Tony said, surprise echoing in his voice. “You listened to Will Rogers on the radio growing up?  That’s...were you in a cult or something?  Ah, sorry. Sorry, I didn’t mean...” Tony stopped grimacing as Steve winced.  Dammit. Dammit.  Why had he said anything?  Now Tony thought there was something wrong with him--something
“Well,” Tony shrugged pointedly, looking back down at his empty yogurt cup.  There was a single streak of pink still on the bottom of the cup, and Tony scraped the spoon tip against it, mostly for something to do that wasn’t thinking about how badly he wanted Steve to be okay with this, though he wasn’t entirely certain why it mattered so much.
“Exactly,” Tony replied.  “Are we done?”
“‘Cause you seem a little, I don’t know…” Brock said, trailing off.
Of course.  Of course, T’Challa had those things, and of course, Steve couldn’t very well carry the cartridge with him.  He made no move to hand it back, though, just stared at the letters and numbers on the pieces of tape, the way they curved and scrolled so neatly across the labels.
Tony kept time by the small circles Steve’s finger was tracing on his hand, each brush of contact soothing and calming, because it meant Steve was right there, so it was okay. He wondered when Steve would be okay to leave here.  Of course, he was willing to wait as long as it took for Steve to be okay.  This had to be rough on him.  Being stuck in a tiny room at SHIELD, overcome by hormones and trapped by his own biology.  Poor Steve, he thought sadly, glancing around the tiny room at SHIELD where he was standing.  Of course, Steve was handling it so bravely.
“From Hell?” Steve asked.
Steve stepped up to his team, looking around, as he checked to see if anyone had taken a hit. They all sat around the Quinjet, Sam, Clint and Natasha on the ground, with Thor and Bruce standing next to them, the scepter now cradled in Thor’s hands. Bruce looked the tiniest bit shaken after the last-minute Hulk-out, but when he noticed Steve’s look, he nodded and gave him a quick smile. Tony was still hovering in the air above them, mask down, staring at the HYDRA base impassively.
“I had an idea, yeah. Our current situation doesn’t exactly make it easier.”
Maybe if he wrote down how he wanted to say it…
Yesterday, they’d scouted the area together one more time, and apart from that: They hunted and fished, washed their clothes, they built and ate and slept. Tony continually worked on their shelter, improved it with tools he’d found in the penthouse, while Steve cooked over the fire. When they were not doing that, they were taking shelter from the storms that were slowly getting worse. And when they were not doing that, they were doing the rest all over again.
Tony hummed, rubbing a hand over his neck, as if embarrassed. “When I sold the Tower and moved to the Compound, I don’t know… I wasn’t in a good place, and I guess I didn’t want to be cheered up.”
Tony hummed in agreement. Yeah, it really was.
The front door of the farm house opened, and Tony stepped outside, looking a little frazzled. He turned around, then fixated Bucky with his eyes. “Got news for you, Frosty.”
“Noted.”
“When I’m home, we’ll meet with your lawyers,” Steve started.
Steve hadn't really had the chance, nor the interest, to look for anything that went beyond distant friendship with people; not since the army at least. He'd always preferred solitude. And this… well, this was out of his social capabilities by at least twenty miles.
Stroking a fingertip over his wedding band, Steve looked down on it. The vibranium seemed a bit duller than usual; maybe it needed to be polished.
“Exactly,” Pepper agreed. “And if you go on like this, you’ll also lose
Tony’s mouth dropped open. “He’s
They’d decided to ‘see where things go’. To be ‘casual’ about it. To just ‘text each other’, make a ‘real date’ out of it. They’d agreed to stay cool about it. To not overthink it. They’d both admitted they were interested, and everything else, well... time would tell.
“Come,” Steve panted. “Wanna feel you come around me.”
As soon as Tony felt Steve clenching around him in a vice grip, felt the wetness between their bodies, he gave his thrusts more momentum. He’d been close the moment he’d pushed into Steve for the first time, the flesh around him too hot and definitely too tight to not bring him close to coming right away. And with the way Steve tightened around him further now, encasing him in warm velvet, Tony knew he wouldn’t last another minute.
“You didn’t remember,” she said in typical Natasha fashion. They often came back to this—that he’d forgotten her.
“Tell me one thing that’s keeping me here.”
They drove for another twenty minutes, until they came across a huge road sign that read ‘Roadside America’.
At some point as he spoke, he felt Tony slide out, followed by a new, foreign sensation. Dribbling down between his ass-cheeks and along his inner thigh. God, he felt claimed in an all encompassing way.
“Blade,” Tony rasped, then groaned, when Bruce pressed a compression bandage further on the wound. “Still stuck.”
tractor,” Tony pointed out on a laugh.
Closing his eyes, Steve stilled himself with a breath. He wouldn't get jealous about this, he told himself. Tony was seventeen, and likely not a virgin, but he had to ask, didn't he? It was just practical. "First: Have you done this before?"
It wasn’t hard to see where Rhodey was going with this. “When he made me stop drinking.”
Steve huffed as he turned around, dropping both the lube and a condom on the bed next to Tony. Only when his eyes took in Tony’s now all-out naked form, he stopped.
Surprise was too inadequate a word. Tony didn’t understand it, and naturally, things he didn’t understand scared him shitless.
“We dreamt of each other,” Steve said.
Despair threatened to overtake him. Next to him, six men were leaning against the wall, tables or just standing there. Doctors, and a few armed guards. One of them edged closer—the small, almost bald man with huge glasses. “Sergeant Barnes,” he said with clear pride in his voice. “I knew you would make it.”
It was just… hard to stomach how good they were getting along now.
me? I should’ve known better than to close that door behind you.”
Once more, Steve’s eyes darted to the sea, noticing a few police boats next to the big ship. He frowned. “Are you searching for something?”
Tony sighed. “Oh God, fine,” he said, and with a wave of his hand, Rhodes rolled his eyes and took the next exit.
“Nat said they found you in the Atlantic,” Bucky murmured, not moving an inch. “How long were you gone?”
He pressed his forehead to Tony's shoulder and nodded against him as Tony—there was no other way to describe it—made love with him slowly. It was perfect, every moment of it was beyond anything Steve could've imagined. He felt tension building like it usually did when he topped, but it felt different, deeper, and he belatedly realized there was no stimulation to his dick. He reached the hand not anchored around Tony's neck between them and jerked himself off in time with Tony's pace.
Tony tried for a smile as he took a step forward. Steve stood solemnly, watching Tony with hooded eyes. “So, are you really tired, or did you want to… spend more time together? I mean, if it’s not a good time, we can set up another date…”
close. Another step, and his chest would be against Steve’s. And perhaps because Steve knew it was a dream, he didn’t fight or step back. No one saw them here; no one would know what he secretly wanted. So he didn’t attempt to regain the space Tony’d stolen. The cold he’d felt in the lonely, shady motel room was gone. Tony was standing right in front of him, and damn if he didn’t smell as good as any man Steve had ever fantasized about.
Tony groaned with how good it felt. “I’m pretty sure I should be putting up more of a fight here.”
“It’s some kind of recording,” Natasha said, pulling away just a fraction.
A beat of silence. Steve’s blue eyes were large, his gaze intense. Willing Tony to believe him.
Tony nodded his head in agreement, resting a steadying hand on Steve’s knee and Steve—despite everything that had happened in the last few days—could only lean into him. “I do.”
Tony pursed his lips. “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
He walked over to one of the benches and sat down on it. “How can he know that? He hasn’t contacted me.”
“I suppose you’re wondering why I wanted to have this meeting at the facility,” Ross started.
Steve sighed heavily. “Tony.”
, right. Wounded pride was a bitch, Tony supposed. That’s what Steve had come here for: To get the last word. To finally have Tony admit that he had been right all along.
There were at least thirty men fighting in there.
To Steve’s relief, Fury looked intensely unimpressed. His eyes narrowed and he read the small note one more time, then folded it properly and turned to Tony. “Is there any reason to believe your wife wouldn’t have corresponded with Mister Stane?”
The applause was instant and all-consuming. At first, only the press, the science department, and Tony’s friends stood up, but soon enough, the whole audience was rising from their seats and clapping their hands. Even the senior partners gave Tony a respectful nod as he passed them on the way back to his table. That was… hilarious in itself. Tony remembered the day he’d first uttered the words ‘clean energy’ in one of their board meetings. Remembered how Obi’s gaze had darkened and how most people had given him one of those ‘Oh, you naive little child’ looks that Tony had been pretty familiar with at that point.
that. But, you have to understand that this is the only way…
“For six months, yes,” he said, instead. “And you
Tony closed his eyes, shuddering.
“I like to feel it,” Tony explained with soft eyes. “Can you do that for me?”
There was something inside him, a bundle of heat and little electric shocks, that had him moan and gasp and whimper as he clung to Tony’s frame.
Tony stayed with the others for a while longer, listening to their excited babbling and strategizing, before he excused himself.
He was so fucking glorious and he didn’t even know it.
Chuckling, Steve shifted a little. "Sure, let's get the day started. I'm sure Jarvis will be happy for the chance to feed you." He slid from under Tony, careful not to jostle him too much, and stood up, stretching. He didn't care that he was naked now anymore than he did when he'd woken up from the nightmare. Once he and Tony had established that level of intimacy, he was relaxed about it.
got the serum,” Steve retorted in the same manner. “It’ll heal quickly.”
“We both got lucky,” Steve said as soon as he’d composed himself, and felt something very peaceful settle inside of him.
Steve’s hand pumped him smoothly, eyes absorbing him as Tony moaned and writhed.
work is truly a one of a kind moment even for such a venerable university as MIT.”
When Steve nodded, Tony leveled his mouth to his again. Meanwhile, he wrapped his free hand around Steve’s neck, pressing his brow intimately against his. And when Steve’s cock sprang into his hand, they both moaned for the feel of it all. His tentative fingers, so shy, so careful, running down the length of him in a way that turned him on more than anything else he’d experienced.
Natasha nodded her agreement, grabbing for the parachute with a quick movement. Steve had never doubted the probability of Natasha and Clint doing a few side missions for SHIELD while they were helping out in DC. He wouldn’t have minded, he
“I keep telling you. It shouldn’t be a surprise.” Natasha grinned and brushed a kiss across his forehead, before sliding into the seat next to him. “The twins are in the armory with Clint,” she told him. “Vision is… walking around, watching everyone. Thor’s staying close, for now. When Tony’s done, I think we’re good to go.”
“But… what about Ian? It’s too late to call Veronica.”
“No, don’t belittle it,” Steve said. “When we met, I wasn’t exactly fair to you. I don’t know… for the longest time I hadn’t figured out where the old Steve ends and where I begin. Things that I used to believe in had just lost all their meaning and I was…” He trailed off, frowning at himself.
“Sorry,” Steve whispered. He looked at Tony, into those brown warm eyes, and the thought of them being divided over something as the Accords had his insides churn.
And for a moment, Tony was awestruck that life could give them such breathtaking beauty. So many lights floating there, a universe of infinite worlds.
"Okay," he said, thoughtful.
“Kind of a plan,” Tony corrected from his seat.
The tower now loomed in the distance and Tony touched down on the roof’s landing pad a few seconds later.
When Steve and the others walked inside, Tony had already assumed a seat in the far back, his back halfway turned to them, leaving them to the larger sofa in the middle. He didn’t even look up when they entered, only rigidly staring down at his tablet with an intense focus that was probably faked.
“How do you feel?” Steve asked with a rough voice, moving closer and reaching for Tony’s hand.
And Steve loved him.
Tony glanced back at Steve, then closed his eyes and filtered through the latest news. JARVIS had an eye on every media channel, and more and more details began to emerge as the news reporters ferreted out the story surrounding SHIELD’s downfall.
“Yeah, we kinda can’t,” Clint drawled, though it was clear just how much out of breath he truly was.
Falling in love with Steve had changed his whole life, and even though Tony hadn’t realized it at the time, it had also changed his beliefs on family. He kept imagining how it’d feel to cradle a little baby in his arms, to see Steve kiss their kid’s face, to teach it everything he knew, to… well, to cherish it, to protect it, to
Tony’s eyes flickered over his face briefly, before his expression turned troubled. “Right…”
“What happens now?” he asked, resting a hand over Tony’s chest where the arc reactor hummed steadily. He’d seen it going dark today, and even before he’d known what it meant, he’d known that losing the light meant losing Tony.
“Still got one or two apocalypses in me I think,” he said, and felt Tony laugh in his arms. “But… quitting for a while… sounds like a good idea.”
Together, they joined the others in front of the rear hatch. It was surreal how big their team had gotten during those last two years—and all of this was Steve’s doing. Sam, Barnes and apparently now the Maximoff kids. Whether or not they’d stay with them when all of this is over… Steve united people. He got them to stick together, no matter how dark things seemed to be.
Next to them, Natasha stood up and looked down at the broken debris around them. Both hers and Clint’s face were ashen and smeared with black sludge. “We got to keep moving,” she said worriedly.
"Yes, I am," he said, hugging Tony closer.
Tony hummed, trying not to look pleased and failing. “There’s probably a few things I should explain to you first.” He slowly pulled Steve’s hand up, and placed it over his clothed chest.
She covered his hand with her own. “Thank you.”
Steve licked his lips and exhaled slowly. “Takes two,” he said, admitting, for the first time, that he’d wanted this just as much as Tony had. “I could’ve stopped you at any point.”
“So no results?”
“What is it?” Steve asked.
When Tony arrived at the common floor, Rhodey and Barnes were standing nose to nose, arguing loudly.
Hand in hand.
“Tony?” Steve prompted, worried.
* * *
But Tony was having none of it. He pushed gently against Steve’s shoulders, holding him at a bit of a distance, eyeing his chest.
Tony groaned a bit as he moved. “Thanks. Think you broke me.”
Steve raised his head, expression stony. When committing himself to a mission, he needed to disassociate all of these thoughts from his surroundings. “On our way,” he called into the microphone. Or better yet if Clint picked them up with the Quinjet.
Steve mulled this over for a long moment. “I see.”
“Ian’s fine. He’s a trooper, like his dads,” Pepper answered, rubbing her thin arms. “Veronica will stay as long as you need her. But you’re not the only one with an eating disorder.”
There was a woosh in the air, as Spider-Man swung by.
There were mingled pants between them after their lips parted again, Tony’s mouth taking chart down his throat, their thrusts gaining speed. “You feel so good,” Steve murmured into his skin, his other hand slipping over his thigh and skating between his ass cheeks.
Tony tried to sit up. “Steve—” he rasped.
“It’s crazy,” Tony said as he looked at Steve now. “That it’s over now. For the first time I think I’m seeing a future. For me… for us.”
A grunt left Steve’s lips when Rumlow’s enhanced hydraulic-gauntlet collided with his chest. He was admittedly a bit shocked when he felt himself being propelled into the air next, his back connecting with a nearby car.
“What is that?” Steve heard Tony ask. He turned around and watched as Tony walked around a dusty looking monitor. Steve forced his gaze off of Zemo and made to follow. With Bucky stepping up to them, they all stared down at the screen, where a video had just started running.
to you. Deliberately. And here you sit, trying to make me feel better about dumping your best friend when he needed me most.”
“I know,” he said as he walked around Tony’s table, looking at the room.
Steve sighed. “Can we take a different route?”
“He said he can’t help you.”
A cold, callous breeze filtered through the air. Steve matched his gaze with such intensity that Tony didn’t know if he wanted to hit him, scream at him, kiss him, or rip his head off. It certainly wasn’t the first time he’d felt this way and he guessed it wouldn’t be the last.
Apart they had always been strong, but together they would be undefeatable, Tony knew it in his heart. And there was one thing Thanos hadn’t taken into consideration: Life never stopped for death. Death was only the natural conclusion to life, despite how it came to pass. And at the end of the day, the universe would still be there—and life would be made anew.
Her voice was so soothing. He could almost believe her words. He was quivering and lost as he looked up at Natalia, losing himself in her familiar steely-green eyes. “Так не должно было случиться,” he said brokenly.
Barnes arched a brow. “Now you’re getting testy?” With cool dexterity, he slid the compress over his ears, and leaned back to look at his work. “There. Good as new.”
When Steve’s whole body suddenly started to tremble around him, Tony knew—if he hadn’t known before—that this, right here, would never be enough. That he needed to wake up with Steve every morning and fall asleep with him in his arms every night. He needed more time with him. More of that awed look on Steve’s face when he lost control. And he would do absolutely everything to make that happen.
. There were wrinkles around Tony’s eyes from how much he was grinning while pressing his lips to Steve’s, and his own form was fully leaning into Tony, his fingers softly caressing Ian’s head.
SR 1:32 P.M.>Saw your talk on Fox News
Pepper rolled her days. She turned to Tony. “Come on, you promised to reopen the workshop once you’re back home. I’m sure Steve hasn’t seen it yet, either,” she said. Over her shoulder, she said, “Am I right?”
There were the standard oddities of his life, and then there was… this.
Tony raised both hands into the air. “Here’s me, looking at the bigger picture. I say: let’s take our awesome plan and do what we said we’d do. We drive to Hopkinsville, we bask in the magical awesomeness that is the solar eclipse, and then, you can come home, find Carol, and spend the next billion years in bed, for all I care.”
"Bucky!"
“Forty days,” Tony said, bringing Steve out of his reverie. “You’d think they’d have found us by now.”
Heat rushed to Tony’s face, and he stared at Steve for a long moment. They hadn’t said it yet, though Tony had wanted to many times. Yesterday at his birthday. Three weeks ago, when Steve finally got his PhD. Or… seven months ago, when they’d gotten together. He’d loved Steve for so long now, it seemed ridiculous he hadn’t once told him so.
, a disembodied voice echoed all across the big hall.
TS 8:33 A.M.>Back in NY. W r u?
A shaky breath. “You were the one who pushed me out of it. You chose him, remember?”
“That thing with your eyes. I swear to God you copied Steve’s puppy dog eyes, it’s like they silently beg me to love you.” The tension that had been in her voice slowly lifted with her last statement and she even smiled as she looked at him.
“Don’t what?”
“Have the doctors talked to you, yet?”
“Well, when you put it like that,” Bucky agreed, grinning madly as he and Steve switched places so he could shoot two of Klaue’s guards, effectively clearing their way to the next level.
“Sweetheart,” Tony urged him softly—so softly he barely heard him. “Answer the man.”
He’d refused any calls, had locked down his doors, and faced the ugly truth.
Tony blinked slowly, and his expression hardened. He tried pulling his hand away, but Vision was having none of it, keeping it right where he was. “You
"Morbid," Steve commented, surveying the shelves along the walls. "Can you check if this place will hold?" he asked absently, and on a second thought, reached to grab something from the top shelf. He considered it for a beat, before letting out an amused snort and deciding that would
Slowly, Steve began to roll his hips—and it only took a beat for Tony to move with him, recapturing his length every time he slipped away.
long time, he’d never done it with a man, and more importantly: Never with someone he truly cared about and wanted to be with in the long run.
Saw his
“No,” Natasha said on a sigh. “But I think we should try to give the others a chance to get out of town.” Natasha finally dared to broach the subject that had been on everyone’s mind for hours. “Hide them until we can get negotiations of the Accords underway. It will give us a different ground to work on.”
The Impossible Thing.
Bucky’s first real error was one of timing. He took a stab at Steve when he was already moving away, and his knife got stuck in the handrail next to them. The sharp blade sank deep between the metal bars, and before he could pry it loose, Steve had pushed him away.
Barnes smirked a bit at that, and soon they were chuckling together. The kind of laughter that was disguised as much as possible. Like two boys giggling in church.
[F.R.I.D.A.Y.] [chat_server:46957]
“I just talked to a contact of mine,” Natasha said. “They’re heading towards Leipzig. To the airport.”
Tony took a moment to enjoy the sight of him walking away before he let Mark XLVIII materialize around his wrists and chest. Then, he followed, entering the Quinjet just behind Steve.
Steve balked, and again his mouth interfered with his better senses. “An
“You and… Captain Rogers?” Peter blushed slightly. “I thought he was your boyfriend.”
“Please…”
Tony paused. Blinked.
,” Tony said, voice dripping with sarcasm, but he made to walk to the exit anyway, followed by Pepper, Rhodes and Vision. There was a moment of hesitation as he stood in the doorway, the slightest pause in his steps, but eventually he left without looking back.
Steve pulled his uniform top on. Everyone else was preparing for their drive to Leipzig as well—and the fight they might have to face there.
Later, Steve would tell the story a bit differently, but to Tony, that was how Steve went from the insanely hot guy Tony randomly crushed on from time to time because it was fun and because it seemed to really piss Howard off, to Steve, the insanely hot guy who was kind and gentle, dryly funny and crazy smart, who might actually like Tony back a little bit.  So, dating ensued, because Steve was stupidly old-fashioned like that and thought they should
“Are you?” Tony asked, the hummed noncommittally and waved a hand in the air. “It doesn’t matter.” Steve rather thought it might matter a lot, but said nothing, just waited for Tony to tell him what to do, which was easier than arguing the point, especially when he wasn’t quite sure himself.
Except…
He rubbed the substance on his hand and then coated his cock, giving it a long stroke.  Then another.  Another.  He found a rhythm and worked his hand up and down his shaft.  The King got up and went over to the wheel, pulling out some kind of pin and tossing it aside before going back to the table and grabbing another, slightly longer pin and replacing it.  He didn’t look at Steve.  Steve stroked himself.  Long, slow strokes.  He was getting harder, his cock straining at the metal band that wound around the base.  He felt his balls draw up with a stinging sort of pressure where the band constricted around them.  His hips jerked a bit and a small, breathy moan fell out of his mouth.  He clamped his jaw shut and kept stroking.  His cock was growing painfully hard in his hand, straining up, red and thick.  The vein on the underside pulsed and throbbed.
“You know she was likely in love with him, right?” Tony asked with a soft voice.
“Staying like this won’t undo what happened,” Tony told him with an intense look, but he did pause at the threshold. Steve swallowed, then nodded and followed Tony into the room.
“You were always weirdly optimistic,” he said with a grin, drawing meaningless patterns on Steve’s chest. When he looked up, his eyes twinkled challengingly. “By the way, don’t think I didn’t notice. Thanks ever so for thinking I’d ditch you right after sex. I might be an asshole, but not even I’d pull off something like that.”
“I’m always ready to punch you.”
“How did you like it?” Happy asked. “Pepper and I were there right after our wedding.”
He knew he was overstepping certain borders, but the last time he’d had sex had been a while ago, and being horny usually made him lose whatever was left of his modesty. Anyway, the guy had seemed more taken aback than angry at Tony’s advances. And besides, MIT would rather burn down the science faculty than reprimand the ‘Stark heir’.
Tony gave him a disapproving look. “You fight dirty.”
“Aye, Captain.”
“Wake up, my dear. You’re dreaming.”
SR 3:48 P.M.>?
She lowered her eyes for a second, took a breath, and looked back at him with a smile. “It’s Natasha, these days.”
. Oh, wow, that was… impressive. And kind of not surprising at all.
Steve said, his voice as shrill as it could get. “Everything you said, everything that happened, all of it… it’s all—”
Of course Steve hadn’t kissed back. The way his hands had grabbed Tony’s forearms had been due to shock, or a try to shove Tony away, and nothing more.
“Couldn’t see what was happening,” Bucky whispered after a moment. He blindly flicked Sam off before brushing his thumb tenderly over Natasha’s cheeks where a light cut was already healing.
.” With that, Tony lunged, the shield still raised in his free hand. Steve winced out of reflex, but held his ground. The shield only touched his chest with the barest hint of strength, then Tony lowered it back down. And with it gone, Tony was suddenly very close, the determination leaking from his eyes.
A wicked smile crossed Tony’s lips as he looked back at Steve over his shoulder. “Thought it’d be the courteous thing to do, as I usually don’t bother with anything at all.”
It… it just wasn’t
Thanks for all your lovely comments and encouragements. We really appreciate it. Hope you liked this part, there's more to come <3
While Natasha waved Steve off, and Maria made some side comment on Steve calling them ‘ladies’, Tony fell quiet, wondering how much Steve had heard of what he’d said to Rhodey. As far as Steve knew, no one was aware of their plans yet, and Tony knew he wanted to keep it that way.
wrong.
Stane stepped forward, his eyes full with hate as a firm hand suddenly closed around Steve’s wrist. The next thing Steve knew, Stane pushed him towards the window. The
His heart-rate was still working itself back to normal, and Steve closed his eyes momentarily. He focused on the gentle touch on his face, Tony's warmth, the softness of the bed under him. He concentrated on the fresh air, clear of dust and moisture-stealing ruthlessness, letting himself lose the sense of displacement. This, he decided then and there, would never happen again.
“We’re not,” Steve said on an eye roll. “And they helped. Saved my life.”
Tony’s message arrived at noon.
“How would you know?”
But for now, they had this.
Steve frowned. “My what?”
She huffed against his neck and said, “Fine. As long as you never call me

“Stark, he can’t help you.” She shook her head as she walked closer. “He was very clear about that.”
anything unusual. And Tony and Bruce would want to have a chance to examine the scepter. They had made preparations for months, waiting for the day when they’d finally find the artifact and bring it home. That was all fair enough, Steve thought. Tony had every right to take that chance, since he wouldn’t have many opportunities to analyze an alien weapon up close. It was just the fact that he was doing it now, when he was so exhausted, so clearly shaken by the mission, that didn’t sit well with him.
Tony hesitated. “It’s stupid,” he finally said.
“Be honest with each other. I know,” Tony finished, sighing. “Look, when we come back home, we should—”
There was a heavy pause. “They found out about Barnes’ identity. They’re broadcasting it as we speak.”
cook, alright?”
“That’s what I thought you meant,” Tony said. “Now, shut up and eat the damn cake.”
The crying stopped, and Tony smiled, proud. At least, Ian still remembered Steve’s lullaby.
After everything that had happened between them lately, everything he had done, or failed to do, that Steve could still look at him with acceptance…
. I sat in my workshop, seething, drinking… hating her. Thinking about the mess of a life I’d allowed her to create for me. I remember that I thought… I couldn’t possibly spend the rest of my life like that. So, after my third or fourth glass of scotch, I was so drunk that I went down to the boathouse to confront her. But I never dreamed I’d do what I did… you have to believe me…”
He moaned when Steve put a hand on his ass, and one on his shoulders, and pushed him on his back, with Steve lying on top of him. Once they were settled, his eyes softened and he brushed his lips against Steve’s. “Okay, now move with me,” he whispered, and started to roll his lips up and against Steve.
“He’ll manage even if he doesn’t. You and your awkward stammering got me in the sack without much of a problem, too, didn’t it.”
. James, we could—get a clean slate. We could decide what we want to do with it, you just have to—”
He felt Tony staring at him and opened his eyes again. There was a long silence between them, but he could see the raw emotions in Tony’s expression, a mixture of gratefulness and pure amazement.
“Wow,” Steve breathed, not really meaning to, but it brought once of Tony’s truly wicked, delighted smiles to his face, so Steve guessed it was alright. “You’re something,” he followed up, voice reverent.
For a few minutes more, Tony listened with half an ear as Ross’ assistant ticked off the availability of the UN’s wetworks operatives and what they would do if Tony failed to do his job. The bulk of his attention, however, was on the hard copy reports of the Sokovia Accords right in front of him.
“The kid?“
Steve lifted both hands with mock apology. "No complaints here." He then let his hands fall to the sides and looked around at the space they were stranded in. He'd done a short sweep just after the collapse, but got distracted with Tony's attack and all that happened after that.
And Steve’s team—well, he had told everyone not to hurt anybody either, and thus, it seemed, they had made it through the day without any casualties.
“Don’t do that,” Steve ordered. “I want to hear you. Can’t be quiet all the time.”
“You wanna do this alone, or…”
Tony raised an eyebrow at that, staring at him with blunt astonishment. “And the rest of him was human? You’re sure?”
"I didn't think you'd be the kind of person to do that, that's why I—" Steve bit his tongue and shook his head. "It was a misunderstanding." His eyes closed and finally, the exhaustion that had been pushed back again and again this night would be held back no longer. The mission had been taxing, and then Tony had come over and that… well, involved considerable exertion of the best kind.
It was all a little dizzying. Steve was still reeling with sensation when the kiss broke. How had he ever thought he could refuse Tony's advances? It was so far from how he'd have dealt with this situation three years ago.
“Yes, thank you sir,” one said, and another: “Glad to see you home, sir.”
What are you talking about?” he asked.
“You’re not playing fair. I think Barnes is a bad influence for you, after all.”
Ross sighed tiredly, removing his glasses. “Stark—”
"I'm not other people, Tony," he said first, seeking Tony's eyes with his own. "And I know who you are, this is what I'm signing up for." He paused, considering his words. "You know who I am, too. If you sign up for it, I'll be expecting you to put in the effort." He reached for the fork and handed it to Tony. "Whatever happens, if I know you're in it like I am, we can make it work."
"I'll take the blame," Steve said, lips brushing against Tony's as he spoke, "but only if you take the blame for doing the same to me."
He felt a hand wander across his chest before slipping between them to tease the ache between his legs.
is your friend. I got the memo Steve, just—just fucking
“So you just told yourself there was no reason to try and that was that,” Tony concluded, sounding angry. He remained still for a long, pregnant moment. Then, something in his eyes shifted. “You said something about sparring the other day? Let’s do that.”
God, he already missed him.
Tony expelled a deep, shivering breath. “But if he doesn’t want this anymore one day, it’ll...”
“Maybe it just wanted a little time-out,” Tony said, as he leaned back into the sofa’s backrest. Then, he clapped a hand on Steve’s knee. “Or it wanted to get up and personal with our good Captain. We’ve ruled out sex-pollen, by the way.”
Tony breathed slowly—in and out. “Well,” he decided after a minute. “I’m glad you know now.”
They both stared into the distance for a moment, before Tony made a small gesture, encompassing the boxes in front of them. “So…” he prompted.
Tony frowned and ran a hand down Steve’s back. “You wanna talk about it?”
Tony paused, pointedly staring at the machine in front of him. Whenever Steve mentioned the m-word, Tony just didn’t know how to react. After he’d found out, they hadn’t talked about it again. Tony didn’t know how to behave around him—around a man who knew him better than anyone, when Tony still knew so little about him in return.
“For the past four years, you operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That’s an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate.” Another one of the senators walked closer and put a large stack of papers down next to Steve. “But I think we have a solution.
“Resolute.”
Tony could see the hope in Steve’s expression crumble somewhat. “Bucky,” Steve echoed hoarsely, hands coming up as if in surrender. “I know you don’t remember… but your name is
“Maybe.” Tony heaved a low breath. “I’m not saying it was him. For now, let’s just go with the option that someone wants to blackmail him to push the anti-superhero-movement, all right? We’ll see what’s what.”
“The girl tried to warp my mind,” the god answered with a grave voice. “Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I… am… mighty…”
Still, it might not be enough for what Tony was about to ask of him. Silence settled between them—silence between two people who had no reason to greet each other with anything resembling amiability. Tony didn’t know Bucky Barnes aside from the stories Steve had told him over the last couple of years. He did, however, still remember the tangible pain in his abdomen where Barnes had stabbed him.
He sat in the darkened kitchen, staring empty-handed down at the table, every now and then flexing his fingers with the blind expectation that Tony would appear at his side and he could take hold of his hand.
As if on command, Steve threw his head back, his hips lifting off the mattress. His body sizzled and exploded, doused so deep in rapture that he didn’t know how to ever breathe normally again. It lasted forever, and yet, it was over too soon. Sweat lined Steve’s brows and when he looked down, he felt all remaining breath leaving him.
Steve shook his head with conviction. “No. Army regulations forbid storing ammunition within five hundred yards from the barracks. If they rebuilt it, they wouldn’t have done it there.”
Tony chuckled and tugged Steve into his arms. “Breakfast it is,” he said, one of his hands slipping around Steve’s upper body and trailing downwards until he’d reached his lower back. He gave his ass a light squeeze, while simultaneously pressing a noisy kiss against his lips.
“Can you play the video from the kitchen camera beginning ten minutes ago?” Steve asked. A moment later, the video popped up on his television screen.  He could see Tony standing at the table, berating the team for eating the mini-muffins, watched as Tony’s head snapped up when Steve came in, heard them speak in circles at each other and then…and then…there.  That…right before Tony had looked away, the one to finally break their stupid staring contest, there.  A flash of pain, brief but undeniable, contorted Tony’s features for a moment as he dipped his head to look down at the table, his shoulders slumping ever so slightly.  Steve sat up straighter on the edge of the bed and hit the replay button, sure he was imagining or exaggerating what he was seeing at first, but no.  No, there it was.
“Relax,” Tony murmured.  The word reverberated through Steve like a dark, deep echo, seemingly making its way to some core inside him that connected the rest of his body to his cock, which pounded and stiffened with sudden interest.
“I know,” Steve acknowledged, glancing away.  His knee was bouncing underneath the table, and he forced himself to sit still.  “I mean, I don’t like it, but...I just think...we can’t pass this up. If he’s serious, then--then I think I should do it. There’s so much we could do with that kind of money.  Your business, Sam’s program...we could help Wanda with her brother’s immigration thing, and, I don’t know...a lot of stuff. I’m not--I’m not saying I
There was so much about Steve he didn’t know.  For the first time, it occurred to him that he might want to.  To know.  To know Steve.  The Risotto Revelation, Tony thought with a flash of silliness on the heels of a wave of satisfied relief, the kind that showed up when he solved an equation or fixed one of the ‘bots.
Steve swallowed hard and tried very, very hard to keep how that information felt off his face.  He had a terrible poker face, though, and by the way Ms. Potts’ expression softened momentarily and then regrouped, he supposed he didn’t do a very good job of it.
Tony stared at him for a moment, then burst into laughter.  No, giggles.  The man giggled. He swiped his hand over his face to try to stop them, but to no avail. Steve tried to stop himself from finding it adorable.
again.  Something more than what I let myself have.  I think I was maybe still punishing myself a little when I came home.  Maybe not a little, I don’t know. For Bucky, for the War, for—for a lot of things, I guess.”
“Hi, you, too,” Steve said, slowly closing the door behind him and dropping the shield down with a soft thunk.  They stared at each other a moment.  Steve was still in his uniform, though it was dirt-stained and streaked with something darker in a few spots telling some story that Tony couldn’t ask about.  A day’s growth of beard covered his cheeks and neck, and his hair was mussed, probably from the helicopter, but Steve even managed to pull off chopper-hair, because
“Your Highness, I was so pleased to get your message.  As you know, I strive to always provide the very best—“ Zola said, dipping into a deep bow and giving Steve a nudge with his hand as he swept it back behind him.  Right, kneel, Steve reminded himself, dropping to his knees.
,” Anthony assured him.  Warmth bloomed in Steve’s chest.  It was a lie, but sometimes, soldiers needed the lie.  Sometimes, that was the only way to keep going.  He thought it might be called compromise.
He let out a long sigh, then leaned over the box again, fingering at the rest of the odd assortment. There was a switch with wires hanging out of it that he was fairly sure he’d used on something, though he couldn’t quite place what it had once been intended to do. Two faded to nearly unreadable ticket stubs for a terrible movie they’d gone to see, though they'd spent the better part of the last half of it making out, so it could've been Oscar-worthy for all Tony knew. A bright, blue box of checks from a bank that was long defunct. A copy of his explanation for his thesis project that he’d handed to the professors during his demonstration with a fat, red A on the front. The Time magazine with him on the cover from a few years ago. A torn-edged copy of the Popular Mechanics article about his ‘bots. And a stack of envelopes with a large rubber band around them in the back corner that practically had a 'Read Me' sticker on the front.
Tony didn’t know why he was thinking about Steve so much all of a sudden.  Must be the alcohol.  Steve was a part of Tony’s past, true enough. An important part. But, it was a past that Tony was trying very hard to move away from.  Steve was the only person Tony had ever really dated, after all, and as he moved into grad school, he’d realized that he needed something new.  Something different. It had been nice.  While it lasted.  Of course, it was never going to last forever. Tony knew that. Eventually, Steve would have decided to leave.  Tony could feel him pulling away those last few months when he and Sam kept having to go off on work trips.
And familiar.
“I didn’t mean it like—I just—I would’ve—I would’ve helped, okay?  ‘S all I’m saying. I would’ve helped.  I think.  Probably.  If you could’ve gotten past Pepper’s gatekeeping, gold digger radar.  I mean, she’d take one look at you and imagine picking up your dry cleaning, which, to be fair, isn’t without some precedent, so,” Tony acknowledged, dancing his head back and forth and rolling his eyes.  “I’m just—I’m saying, I helped them.  The others.  Their—the families.  I helped them.”
He did, apparently, stare for far too long at the row of sheer stockings.  Long enough that one of the salespeople had asked him if he needed help with anything.  He almost laughed at that, but managed to choke out a ‘no, thank you,’ and moved on.
“You’re back,” Tony observed, then grimaced at stating the obvious.  “I was—“ waiting, Tony thought, then rejected it before the idea could grab hold.  “Looking at the stars.  Pin—pinwheel cluster,” he explained around a yawn.  “Guess I must’ve fallen asleep.  Everything, ah, go okay?  With your mission stuff?”  Mission stuff.  Honestly, just stop speaking until your brain decides to roll out of bed, Tony told himself in disgust.
“You don’t need to kno—oh,” Steve said, cutting himself off abruptly and staring at Tony.  “It was a long mission, Tony.  That’s all it was.”
“Sure.  Stay,” she said finally, tossing a look at Barnes.  So, clearly, they had not told Wilson about any of this, and had no plans to spill the beans that Steve still had a ring on it.   Ah, subterfuge.  Always works out so well.
“You realize that
“No idea what you mean,” Steve teased.
“The King’s Walk,” Rhodes said, looking over at Steve as he guided Steve through the labyrinthine corridors.  “Part of the original castle design, before all the renovations Tony’s grandfather, and then his father, took on.  Lets the King move between most areas he needs to be in private, away from prying eyes and the demands of Courtiers, and, of course, in the event of attack, gives the King and his family a way to escape,” Rhodey explained, in answer to Steve’s unasked question.  “Tony swears this whole thing was some ancient Stark’s attempt to keep his nighttime activities secret from his consort,” Rhodes said with a roll of his eyes, “but I can’t say it is without use.  We used to escape our tutors through here. Me and Tony,” Rhodes said with an air of fond remembrance.  “Disappear when it got too tedious, pop back out when it was time for dinner.”
The bedchamber provided for the King was far more well-appointed, Steve noticed right away.  A large, four-poster bed sat against one wall, draped in heavy, emerald green curtains.  On the other wall, a tapestry depicting a hunting scene hung, with two sconces set with bright candles. A stone hearth glowed on the opposite wall, flanked by a table between two plush chairs sitting atop a rug that looked new.  A tray piled high with food sat on the table. Next to the tray stood a large pitcher, two goblets, and a bottle of wine.  There was a large wooden bathtub in front of the fireplace. Small curls of steam still wafted from the edges.
“Yeah.  Yeah, that…that’s one way to put it,” Steve agreed, raising his eyebrows, then giving Tony a softer look, his voice going rough.  “But, then those guys jumped me, and I realized you were in trouble. I didn’t know what I was going to find when I got back here,” Steve told him in a harsh, scraping whisper.  “I ran through the lobby like a madman, and then got up here and that—that
“Tell me about your project. Energy? Like for ...for power?” Steve asked almost haltingly, like he was trying out the words.
“Hey yourself,” Tony finally responded, seeming to come back to himself.  “Looking good there, Cap,” Tony continued more evenly.
“One and the same.  Your work on Einstein-Rosen bridges is fascinating,” Tony said.  “Easily some of the best research in the field in the past decade.”
His voice sounded thin.  He swallowed, throat clicking with the effort, and coughed, trying to clear it, but the air sat cold in his chest.  He ducked his head forward, into Tony’s chest, and breathed in the warm, musky scent.  It helped steady him, somehow, and up was up again, the disorienting sensation slowly dissipating, as Tony’s warmth seemed to seep into Steve’s skin.  “I am,” Steve insisted, and this time, it sounded like it might be true.
“We put a lot of money into that school, you know?  Wouldn’t kill you to act a bit grateful,” Howard ground out.  “You see?  You see how he is?” he asked, glancing around the room as if searching for support.  “Ten minutes, champ.”
“Yeah,” Steve nodded, closing his eyes and letting his head bang just slightly against the table.  “I was.”
“How…terrible?” Tony tried uncertainly.
“Look at you, so ready for me.  You like that?” Steve asked, voice husky and warm against the skin of Tony’s neck.  “You do, don’t you?  You need more, though, hmmm, is that it?  Do you want more, Tony?”
“Please,” Steve groaned.  “Yes. Please, Tony.”
“First of all, I do not swoop,” Tony objected, too bitterly, he knew, and wondered what Natasha heard, though she just gave him a long look in return.  He pushed himself off the bar far enough to brace his hands along curved edge and return Natasha’s stare.  Involuntarily, he would swear, his gaze flicked back to the mirror above the bar long enough to see the tall, blond head he had definitely not been watching bend over to better listen to whatever inane remarks a woman wearing what appeared to be a cocktail napkin was saying to him.  Might be a generous interpretation of cocktail napkin, come to think.
For a moment, Steve thought of his first day in Zola’s compound, being cleaned and shaved and prepared for Tony.  How horrible it had been, how helpless he had felt.  Useless.  Immaterial.  Like he didn’t matter.  He blinked, eyes stinging, and repressed a shudder.  With Tony, though…Tony would be gentle.  Careful.  Tease Steve.  Barely touch him, but touch him enough.  Slide the blade across his skin while Steve was
Fantastic.   In the space of one entrance, he’d managed to convince the team he’d had a one-night stand, ruin everyone’s breakfast, and piss off Tony over…over…well…what?  That he’d slept with someone last night?  So had Tony…or…well, there hadn’t actually been an unfamiliar face at the table, come to think of it.  He’d been so focused on Tony and his rather hypocritical accusations that he only just realized that it had only been the team, heads swiveling back and forth between him and Tony as they did that thing where they didn’t actually argue but nevertheless managed to wound.
In fairness, Sam’s assessment was oftentimes not entirely inaccurate.  Tony’s penchant for providing assistance to his army was well known.  Less well known, however, was the identity of the helmed knight who sometimes rode out with Steve and his team brandishing all manner of weaponry, the likes of which no one had ever seen before.   It had been almost a full year before
“Tony wouldn’t do that…okay, maybe he would if he thought there was a problem,” Steve conceded at Bucky’s huff of disbelief. “But…fifty, really?” Steve stammered.
MCU Stony Discord Server!
“It’s like you don’t even know me,” Steve said with a lopsided attempt at a smile that fell flat.  Sam huffed out a short, caustic laugh, then scrubbed a hand over his face.  He nodded at Steve again, firmer this time, and turned back to the door.
what I wanted,” he said finally, his voice soft, almost too soft for anyone who wasn’t Steve to hear, but Steve heard.  Steve heard.  He watched as Tony peered down into the water where their reflections rippled over the surface, his face perking up with sudden interest.  “I could build a sort of fish-taser and stun the picky little bastards. They’d just float to the surface, and we could grab ‘em.”
In a few days, it wouldn’t matter that Tony noticed him, and he had to keep that in mind, or…or this was going to be a lot more difficult than he’d thought.  Tony was going to head back to California and his life once this was over, and while Steve didn’t really doubt Tony’s sincerity about helping out him and Bucky, that was just Tony being Tony, apparently.  He’d helped all the other soldiers out, hadn’t he?  Steve thought Tony probably hadn’t been too far off the mark about their shared guilt complexes, but Tony had the resources to assuage his guilt in ways that Steve didn’t.  It didn’t mean anything, he told himself firmly, other than that his initial perception of the man had been about as far off as possible.
“That’s fantastic!  Did you train him or…you said he learns, right?”  Steve queried, giving Tony a quick, almost bashful look.  “You said you thought of it, the learning thing, because of the fishing.  What I said about the fishing,” he clarified, then looked back at DUM-E who was, dear God, dropping the cloth and picking it up again.  Steve clapped delightedly.
solve a lot of issues, that was the whole point--but still, Brock’s excitement stung a bit, though Steve supposed Brock was just trying to put on a good front.  What else could he do?
“I knew that was going to come back to bite me,” Tony said with a smile.  “I don’t see why we have to do this every couple of hours.  That just seems like overkill, quite frankly,” Tony continued, as he reached to the bedside table to grab the supplies and rolled over.
“Three tours.  Two in Afghanistan, one in Iraq,” Steve answered.
Oh. Right.  Manners, Tony chided himself, shaking his head to clear the momentary reverie. He probably should have actually read some of those etiquette books his mom bought him instead of using them as the bases for his wheeled trebuchets during a particularly exhaustive round of Storm the Castle.  The irony had been beautiful, though.
“Never thought I’d be afraid of the dark,” Steve had said as he peered over the side of the boat at Shellhead that first night.  “You’ll stay, won’t you, Shellhead?”
“No,” Steve said quickly and looked down at the floor.
something,” Tony urged, his voice low and rough.  He was looking up at Steve with wide, dark eyes, his fingers digging almost painfully into Steve’s hands. “I don’t know what these stones are, but I know there is power here.  You feel it, too, I know you do. I think a promise made here, it isn’t something that can be broken lightly. Not without consequence. Do you understand what I’m saying to you?”
By the time Happy dropped him off in front of their—he’d just decided to go with their at this point—building, Tony was exhausted.  Exhausted and…freezing.  Fuck, it was cold, he hummed to himself as he took the front steps and pushed open the building’s front door.
Okay, so maybe no music, Steve thought a few seconds later as he jerked the earpieces out, staring down at his phone with a wince.  He stared at the screen for a moment, wracking his mind to be sure he had gotten the band’s name correct, then gave up on the idea of music.
“I know,” Steve said, mouth twisting into a grimace.  “I’m sorry, Peg. You know I can’t.”
The rest of the morning was spent fine-tuning strategy with Pepper and a yawning Rhodey, who was making an admirable, if vain, attempt to out-caffeine Tony.  He ended up with his head on Tony’s laptop, which he insisted was warm and made a pleasant hum.
“Now, Pepper, to your point…really, when have you known me to do things the easy way when there is an alternative that involves a far more personally satisfying, if somewhat dramatic, demonstration of throwing money at a situation with the hope it’s understood as a way of emotionally compensating for things I’m scared to say out loud?” Tony asked, raising his eyebrows in question.
“What does…” Steve broke off with a startled laugh.  He wiped a hand over his mouth. Anto knew that meant he was nervous.  He was learning Steve’s signals, after all. “I’ve waited my whole life to find someone, to fall in love, and when I do, he doesn’t even know what…” he shook his head, though he was beaming a bright smile down at Tony.
Yearning welled up so suddenly inside of him that Steve found himself nearly blubbering like a baby with the force of it.  His eyes stung, spilling hot tears down his face.  He should be embarrassed, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care. It had been so long.  So very long.  He wasn’t even sure what he meant, but the thought wouldn’t leave it, and with it came a stirring of longing so deep that he swayed with it, leaning forward, seeking, seeking something he couldn’t name.
“I ate before we left,” Tony replied.
“I’m fine,” Steve responded stiffly, staring at the glittering panorama without really seeing anything, as far as Tony could tell.
“I think I’ve been more than upfront with you,” Tony argued.
“I’m told he was a soldier.   In some war across the dark sea.  Guess he picked the wrong side.  If we’d known, we’d never have taken him, of course.  Those raider scum would tell you the sky was orange with a straight face if it got them a few more pieces of gold,” Rumlow told him with a grimace.  “He was practically savage when he first arrived.  Of course, there are ways of dealing with that, though, as you can see, there is little damage.  We’re very careful.”
“That’s it, that’s it,” Tony breathed out, hands coming up to wrap around Steve’s neck, fingers winding through the hair on the back of his head. Tony pulled Steve’s head down, licking into Steve’s mouth chasing the groan that came with the sudden shift of position as Steve seated himself fully, deeply inside of Tony.  He could feel Tony’s body shaking and clenching around him, Tony’s still-hard cock leaking between their stomachs.  He pushed himself up on his arms, bracing them on either side of Tony’s head, keeping his mouth pressed to Tony’s.
Steve rather thought Cam had the right of it.
, Tony, then, you called the wrong guy.  You’ve been happier the past week than I’ve seen you in—in I don’t know when. No, it isn’t smart. This thing with you and Rogers.  But, the two of you, you’re both more the run before you can walk types, you know what I’m saying?  Maybe this kind of crazy is just the right amount of crazy for you two.  Any sane approach and one of you would find a way to screw it up, let’s face it.”
“It’s… a long story,” Steve replied.
“Those are just leaves, but thanks for the thought,” Bruce said with a low huff of a laugh.
could’ve maybe—fuck.”
“Nooooooo,” Tony moaned and made a grab for the phone that ended up with him dropping his head to the table and laying there quietly.  “He’s going to make me miss class.  If I miss class, they’ll say it’s because I couldn’t handle the pressure or something. You wait. It’ll be, ‘First Omega at MIT Requires Sick Leave,’ or ‘Omega Stark Too Weak to Handle Rigors of College?’ or ‘College Omega Can’t Handle the Pressure’.  You wait.  They’re dying for me to screw up, Rhodey.  They’ve already gotten the tweets and headlines written.  ‘You Won’t Believe How Quickly Omega Stark Had to Take a Break from College.’”
“I’m headed back to the Tower with Pepper and Happy,” Rhodey said.  “They’re down in the car.”
Steve had wondered, this morning, how Tony would treat slaves who were not sharing his bed, and here was his answer.  He does not see, Steve realized, looking over at Tony, who was taking another cup of chilled wine from a girl who might as well have been invisible.  He cannot allow himself to look.  If he did, Steve knew, Tony was far too smart not to see this for what it was, so he simply did not see.  Trained to blindness from birth.  They all were.  Except, each day with Steve, Tony saw him, truly saw him, more and more, and that was what terrified Zola.  Not the collar.  Not the namesake.  Not the gifts or the status.  That Tony might see Steve and one day, not be able to look away.
“Fine,” Natasha replied.  “Do not upset him, Stark, or I swear to God…” she said, letting the threat hang in the air.
Calhoun was gasping and sputtering, spittle wafting from his lips in silent screams.  His legs pinwheeled out, knocking ineffectually against Steve’s knees, while his fingers clawed at Steve’s hand around his throat.  Out of the corner of his eye, Steve could see Rumlow and Rollins shifting a bit, edging closer, clearly thinking about intervening.  Steve thought that would be just fine.  He saw the moment Rumlow realized this and decided Calhoun wasn’t worth it.  Calhoun seemed to see it, too.  Steve’s grip tightened. The man’s eyes bulged.  Steve could see fear there, could smell the sour-sweet scent of it dripping from the man.  It smelled delicious.
The Board meeting took four hours.  Tony was exhausted, mentally and physically.  He wanted a drink.  He wasn’t going to have one, but he wanted one.  That, unfortunately, would probably always be true.
“Alpha,” Steve said again, the word seeming to sear a line from Tony’s brain to his cock. He reached out to cup Steve’s ass, massaging the cheeks in his hands a bit, then gently spreading him further apart. Steve’s skin was warm and fevered, glowing with a sheen of sweat that wet his palms. Steve’s hole wide and puckered, leaking a steady stream of fluid now. Tony traced the harder skin that circled it with his finger, then pushed inside the slick channel. God, Steve was burning up, Tony thought as he swirled his finger around the soft, wet passage. Steve sucked in a gasp of breath, then let it out in a long, low hiss, his cock bouncing insistently against his belly.
where it tapers to the corner, hoping for a glimpse when the ladies’ skirts’d blow up.  Police would come by and tell ‘em to scram, and they’d all make a break for it.  Twenty-three skidoo.”
“Oh, ah,” Coulson stopped, holding out a hand when Howard started to follow along behind.  “Just Anthony, Mr. Stark.  Agent Thompson here will show you and Mrs. Stark to a waiting area where I’m sure you’ll be comfortable. Snacks.  Drinks.  Cable TV.  We’ve got all the toys,” Coulson promised, though there was something almost challenging running under the words, nice as they seemed on the surface.
“I’ll have you know,” Tony said, leaning up and kissing Steve’s chin.  “I studied those a
“Boss asked me to see if you’d come down to his workshop when you got back,” Friday told him.
Fury steepled his fingers, giving Steve a long look, then pushed himself away from his desk and stood up, walking over to the wide bank of windows that made up the corner of his office.
a beginning.  This thing with Steve, it felt like it had always been there and maybe it had, filling the dark places that would’ve been empty otherwise.  Instead, they were full of longing and jealousy, bitterness and hope, and something that met in the middle of all that, a steady, constant beat of if-only that hadn’t been dulled by the years between boyhood and now.
“Yahtzee!” Tony shouted. He held up the screen for Rhodey to see.  “I knew it! And you doubted kismet. For shame, Rhodey-bear.”
“No.  Really.  Stay.  It’s fine. Really,” Tony said quickly.  “Honestly, it’s fine,” Tony repeated in a wavering voice, turning back to the railing and sucking in a deep breath.  It was fine.
In all honestly, Steve had, at least momentarily, totally forgotten about the money  until Tony’s mention of it hit him like a splash of cold water. He licked his lips.  Tony’s eyes darted down to follow the motion, and Steve felt his mouth go dry.  “I want…” he began.
Fine. Let's find out how it works, then, Tony countered silently.
“Don’t gloat,” Steve admonished with a low laugh, making Tony relax into a smile.  “You’re right. I can help, and I
Except that he hadn’t slept last night. His head had been way too full of memories that he hadn’t let himself think about in years, and on the other side of it this morning, the idea of Steve just dropping off a stack of papers at the Tower’s lobby desk, making nice with the receptionist, and everything being neat and tidy and
