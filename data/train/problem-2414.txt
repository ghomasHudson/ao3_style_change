John wanted to go. John wanted Sherlock to go too, and so instead of immediately dismissing the idea, Sherlock hesitated.
"You will not!" Mycroft snapped. "You have to stay here so that we can get a curse breaker to turn you back to normal!"
"I'm going to move now, love," John said. "Hold on to something."
He stared longingly up the stairs and his insides ached with how much he wanted to be up there next to John.
John didn't have to take a drink at all the next round, putting all of his darts in the bulls-eye. Anderson had to take four, and Lestrade three. Donovan also didn't have to take any. Sherlock stepped up the the board, urged on by John. This was definitely an idiotic game, but John was having fun, so there was that.
John's eyes widened when he saw Sherlock emerge from his room, and then got a rather intense look in them. Sherlock was suddenly reminded of what
"Yes," Sherlock said, already magnetized and moving closer.
*~*~*
Sherlock blinked and stared. "What was that for?"
"But... I'm not a detective," John said. "Will they even let me on the crime scene?"
I had to decide, and fast.
"I don't have to prove it," Sherlock snapped. "I'm an excellent actor. It's John you have to worry about. He's terrible at acting."
d) Investigate the rooms
“I guess we’re even now,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock did, and looked around. John had arranged all of his furniture and there was a pile of flattened boxes in the corner waiting to be taken out. It looked as if John had gotten everything sorted out already. He was a fast worker. Sherlock still had boxes that he hadn’t bothered unpacking from when he’d moved in at beginning of term.
Sherlock whimpered, and John claimed his mouth with hot, drugging kisses. It was euphoric. John began kissing along his jaw, and Sherlock gasped desperately, hands coming up to grasp at the front of John's jumper. His knees wobbled alarmingly.
“Ah, we should find a hotel worker to talk to first,” I finally gasped, skin tingling from our proximity. “They overhear everything in their line of work.”
Sherlock complied shakily and immediately constricted his ankles as John licked a line of wet heat up the underside of his cock. He whined and arched his back, heels digging into John’s back, but not letting go. He was all at once completely engulfed in John’s mouth, and at the first hint of suction, Sherlock keened loudly and stuffed his hand over his mouth, biting the fleshy part of his palm.
Sherlock looked up, slightly dazed, and said, "I want to suck your cock, sir."
"Well, get dressed," Sherlock said, waving a hand at him imperiously.
Sherlock, and Sherlock was too surprised to do much of anything in return. John was kissing Sherlock – Sherlock who was the most anti-social person on campus, who was certainly not a man in spite of their gender identity, Sherlock, who had terrible, lop-sided, rampant curls.
"Such a good lad," John said, patting his flank.
B) Pretend couple
*~*~*
"Oh," Sherlock said hoarsely.
"What?" John asked in confusion. "Latin? Now I'm sure that it isn't all Shakespeare. I'm knowledgeable in some Latin, obviously, but I have no idea what you meant."
He felt like all his feelings which he'd been holding back all this time had come to the surface and bursting through. He'd never felt like this before in his life, and it was almost startling.
“Excellent,” Lestrade said, shoulders slumping in relief. “The retreat is in Cornwall at a private resort near Newquay. Only the famous and rich can probably get in.”
Panting, they stared at themself in the mirror. Their hair was a mess still, although it was shorter now. It was surprisingly light not to have all the hair weighing them down. But without the extra weight of hair, their curls had gone on a riot. Their hair was everywhere, sticking out and fluffing out around their head uncontrollably. Some of their hair was too short to even put in a tie because they'd miscalculated in their haste.
It was a few days later that he heard.
"Don't fight them off then," John said. "Just let yourself be affected. Don't worry about it, concentrate on the case rather than trying to keep your reactions under wraps. I promise you that I don't mind them."
As they were walking back to the dorms, John said, "You know, your creepy brother keeps texting me. If it was any other creepy brother, I would mean things like dick pics and rude comments, but not your brother."
John didn't appear to mind that they were lost, and was actually sauntering along as if they had all the time in the world.
“We’re here,” John said in my ear. “Let’s go.”
Sherlock suffers a grievous injury.
Sherlock sighed as well, and nodded his large scaly head.
"Yes, well there is very little
But they couldn't help but think in anguish about how people would look at them now. Before all this, everyone had complimented their hair, even John. Their mother, strangers on the Tube, and every hair dresser they'd ever gone to, it was always, "Oh, you have such beautiful hair, I can see why you keep it long." Sherlock hated that, that they all saw what they wanted to see, and they'd come to all the wrong conclusions about why Sherlock kept their hair the way they did.
A search through his pockets revealed the culprit. Sherlock handed it to John, who immediately knew what it was.
"Strangely enough, I think your weird brother knew what was happening," John said. "He sent me the address to the tailor and said I might need it. I had no idea what he was talking about until last night."
He got them both totally unclothed, and then leaned down to kiss Sherlock's ridiculous mouth. Sherlock sighed as John made contact, and reached up to wrap his arms around John's neck, burying a hand in John's short-cropped hair. His arms were smooth and warm, and John turned his head to kiss Sherlock's bicep.
Without thinking, Sherlock lifted his leg and slid it up John's, wrapping it around his hip to pull him closer. He did it automatically, his body responding to impulse.
Now that they were looking, they could see where someone had previously moved it, marks on the floor which had been hidden in the gloom. Sherlock muttered under his breath about the differences between drag marks which were witnessed here, and marks for replacing the kegs, which were on the others.
“That's true,” Mycroft said. “He's here because I need him to retrieve our children safely.”
"Er," John interrupted. "Ignore that, he's lost a bet with Lestrade, has to say everything in lines of verse or something like that. I think that was Shakespeare."
"What happening?" Sherlock asked.
"You can relax your leg now, the tie should hold," John said.
"Come on Sherlock, time to eat," John demanded, putting two bowls on the table.
John went over and looked out. There was nothing to hang onto, no balcony or anything. They were three stories up and it looked as if a person who entered the window would also need wings. John sighed and turned back to look at the equipment.
"Yes, here's your keycard, map of the resort, and coupons for couple's massage at the spa," she chirped, handing them everything. Have a pleasant stay, Mr. Holmes!"
"What?" he asked in irritation.
Sherlock looked up at John hopefully, and John sighed in defeat and took Sherlock's hand in his, rubbing the back with his thumb. Sherlock blinked at him and stared down at their joined hands with a mix of surprise and apprehension.
"Oi, freak. You aren't allowed to bring pets."
John didn’t say anything either, for a long time.
“Not too bad for a bone-headed knight, right?” John said, grinning. His face fell a second later. “There's almost nothing that way. A small road, sparsely travelled heads that direction, and there's a distant settlement... on the edge of the Wasting Sea.”
Sherlock looked up, eyes gleaming. "Oh, yes. I think it's time we went down that avenue. Just think of all the new things to try!"
At least there was that. Sherlock hadn't a clue what he would have done if John had decided to go stay somewhere else. It was bad enough the first time around, returning after years of tracking down international networks of criminals only to find the only person he found important in his life had moved out, and more importantly, on. But after all this, after shooting Magnussen, nearly getting sent to his death in Serbia, solving the mystery involving Moriarty's return, and after Mary had turned out to not be pregnant after all, and also to be still working for Moriarty's network, after all that, John was coming home.
“I...” I finally managed. “John, the murderer!”
"Will you tell me about these?" John asked.
"It's not fair if you don't undress, too," Sherlock said petulantly.
Sherlock blinked at him in surprise and nodded slowly.
"Sherlock..." John said. "Come sit in your chair and let me deal with it."
“Thank you,” Sherlock said awkwardly as he tried to figure out if John wanted him to just leave now that he’d been patched up.
Maybe John would finally say, "We're together" instead of "I'm not his date."
Sherlock eyed Donovan speculatively and said, "I bet if John and Lestrade lifted you up, you could reach it."
"Yes!" Sherlock said, writhing.
"I was finished sitting here anyway," he said.
Sherlock yelled, "Ye Gods! And is there no relief for Love? On me Love's fiercer flames for ever prey, By night he scorches, as he burns by day."
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, and John's blush continued to suffuse his face, right up to the tips of his ears, which glowed like beacons. It was fascinating to watch, and it almost distracted Sherlock from the information he was learning from this.
“Come here,” John said, and drew his head down again.
John raised his hands to touch his face and hair. His hair was once again military standard length, as if he'd gone to the military barber rather than a posh bloke with expensive taste in shampoo. His face was smooth and tingled slightly from the aftershave Sherlock had slapped on afterward. He was clean and groomed once more.
"That's not Shakespeare," John said, frowning. "Not that I'm an expert or anything, but that sounds like something else."
He was a well-known news anchor and was attending the couples retreat as a guest with his husband.
John asks Sherlock what he wants for Christmas
John’s hands ran up the length of his legs, fingers catching in the soft, curly hair. Sherlock shivered and spread them further.
"Here, come and sit with me and we'll watch telly, take your mind off it," John said.
Sherlock was definitely already tired of Christmas, and it hadn't even started yet. There was so much worse to come in the following weeks. Why was Christmas every year? Surely it could come every two years? Or even five?
"Pink!" Sherlock yelled back, because they were certain that Lestrade hadn't even noticed that the lady's suitcase was obviously too conspicuous to hang on to for long.
John decides the sleeping arrangements
Sorry it's late!
"Hey," he said, voice husky. "That's my job, luv."
"On the other hand," Sherlock went on. "If I imagine our positions switched... well, it's not exactly a sexual feeling on it's own, but it's more appealing."
“I have essay’d, and in my mind there is a power to make these subjects to itself,”muttered Sherlock. He waved a hand at the screen and, in frustration, said, “But they avail not.”
Sherlock had expected her not to be, but he could hardly refuse to take her along with him after the service she had done him (however small – he would have figured out how to escape on his own eventually). But she had proved all of his expectations wrong, and he considered that possibly, if they had been married, it wouldn't have been completely awful.
John put his phone down and immediately turned around. Sherlock was in trouble, and he had to go help. He would have been a bit annoyed with the interruption, but this was something of an emergency. Not only that, but it gave him an excuse to go back.
"Wonderful," Sherlock said. "Just what I need, people tromping around the flat, disturbing my experiments."
"John!" Sherlock protested.
John and Gladstone go find 221b Baker street. Where could this lead them?
As he was getting up, Sherlock tossed him a fortune cookie.
Once away from the front desk, I started talking to John in a low voice. “I didn’t think that Xavier was involved, but I might have been wrong on that front.”
“It’s okay,” John repeated. “It’s okay to be overwhelmed.”
That was all John needed to push him over the edge, and he came all over Sherlock's arse.
"Of course I can," John said raggedly. "How did this happen?"
“Surely you know the stories of the White Wanderer?” said Mycroft.
“What about the bed?” John asked, blinking at me innocently.
"I'm not," John protested half-heartedly.
"Come on, I want you to wear that jumper," John said, pointing.
"Of course," Sherlock said, almost groaning in dismay that there was a vest underneath the jumper. Why did John have to dress in so many layers?
It was 6:06 when he knocked on the door.
We made our way down to the hotel lobby. The gay couples retreat apparently happened here every year, and our news anchor friend Malcolm Alexander attended with his husband Xavier regularly. He’d only missed the retreat once, when he’d been in hospital with a gall bladder infection.
“Molly is your friend,” said John flatly. “I thought you kidnapped her?”
Sherlock was setting up an experiment when John walked in and announced, "I'm thinking that we should have a Christmas party here at Baker street."
“You know, I think we were in the middle of something last night,” John said. “I think I might have to pick up where we left off.”
"Will you kiss me, John?" Sherlock asked softly.
Lestrade looked at him sharply. "You don't –"
He dragged Sherlock's upper body into his lap. Sherlock allowed this without complaint, humming sleepily and burying his nose against John's stomach.
There was a pause. "You've been avoiding me all this week."
Mr. Fielding had taken up a pencil and circled a spot on the map.
"That's the stuff," John said. "Now do my shoulder."
"Still okay being tied up?" John asked. "No cramps?"
to them, somehow.
He didn't even have a card, and so couldn't go through the self check out, having to brave the stern-faced cashier.
"I don't understand why people are frightened of things they don't understand," Sherlock said.
"Y-yes, Captain," Sherlock keened in desperation.
"Two of them, please," Sherlock said.
A few of the Yarders grinned as they watched John go by with Sherlock riding piggyback.
"Or art thou but a dagger of the mind, a false creation, proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?" Sherlock murmured absent-mindedly as he examined the body.
"Liked that, did you?" John asked with a grin.
He dramatically ripped the envelope in half.
There was a time, so long ago now, that Sherlock had never imagined anyone would accept them as they were, never mind love them for it. They looked down at their left ring finger fondly. The gold band there was polished and meticulously cared for – the state of their marriage obvious to anyone who knew to look.
"I do, too," Sherlock said sleepily. "I do, too."
And then, it happened. A case.
John must never know.
Tentatively, Sherlock checked his hair and clothes in the mirror before heading to the front door. John’s door was right next to his, and Sherlock raised his hand to knock. He hesitated.
"'Bumblebee' it is," John said, oddly charmed by his choice. "Shall we begin?"
It was the screaming that woke Sherlock up.
Before he could answer, one of the chemistry professors came in and asked after Sherlock’s graduate thesis draft. Sherlock glared over the professor’s shoulder as Wilkes hastily left.
“It’s okay, Sherlock,” he said. “We’re in this situation together.”
“I am the one doing all the footwork in this case, so yes,” John retorted.
That settled, John relaxed into Sherlock's embrace and simply breathed.
As Lestrade and Sherlock began discussing the drug situation in London, John took a closer look at some of the butchery equipment. There were several big knives of varying use hanging off a magnet on the wall, separate from the knives used in everyday cooking. There was also a drain underneath for cleaning.
“Let’s go,” I said once I was dressed, sliding on my coat.
"Shh," John said. "You'll be fine."
"You really don't want to know, mate," John said, shaking his head.
"Come on and help me," John said. "We have to get this up for tomorrow."
"Come on, finish the pint," Posh Bloke continued. "We have work to do tonight."
This is how he started drawing John.
Molly had a point.
He spanked Sherlock twice more, and Sherlock mewled and writhed on John's lap. Slick warmth coated John's leg as Sherlock came, and John rubbed a hand over his back as he shuddered with the aftershocks of orgasm.
John laughed and dropped the towel as he rummaged in his jean pockets for something. Sherlock hastily averted his eyes.
At first John thought that it was the ringing in his ears making the unhappy, high-pitched whining noise nearby, but a nudge with a rough, sand-encrusted nose indicated otherwise. John turned his head to find Bill Murray's dog beside him, snout covered in still-wet blood and sand. Bill likely dead then, if the dog was beside him.
The night that Sherlock called John with something like panic in his voice, John knew that there was something horribly wrong. There was a bit of a high-pitched whine behind his words, something that John had never heard before.
“Are you sure?” Sherlock asked.
The door banged shut, and John raised his head. He knew that Len was the owner, but the mysterious second voice was no one he knew. Len sure sounded like he was planning some dirty business. He frowned and patted Gladstone's head absent-mindedly.
It was almost closing time, and there were still patrons inside. John would never have considered going inside, except for the thought that something was actually happening in his life. John didn't know what he could possibly even do to help, he just wanted to be here.
Mycroft groaned.
"What are you doing?" Sherlock asked in confusion.
Before anyone could say anything, both Sherlock and Gladstone shot to their feet and rushed back out of the room and into the pub area. John followed, and saw Gladstone pawing at the trapdoor that lead down to the beer cellar. Sherlock hooked his hand around the ring and pulled it up and away.
John rolled his eyes. "That less so."
"Ex-military doctor," John said. "John Watson."
I decided that I should ask a few general questions first to try and put the hotel employee at ease.
“John…” he whispered pleadingly.
It was also at that moment when I realized that I was very close to John. Very very close, mostly because in my panic I had jumped even closer to him, and my hand was still over his mouth. Oh no. Already I could feel my heart rate picking up and my breath catching.
Sherlock injures himself, but John's there to patch him up, as always.
"Never have I ever owned a dog," John said.
"Come for me, love," John said.
"It seems that somebody replaced my vial of hormone surpressant with a placebo," Sherlock said. "And thus, I am now in heat, as some sort of revenge. Are you happy now?"
Sherlock did as he was bid and watched as John looked through the carefully labelled boxes for one that contained his medical kit. It didn’t take long, and John patted his injured hand dry with a towel, then started applying an antibiotic cream.
“Sleep,” he said, after a while. “I’ll be here to guard your dreams.”
"Mirrour of grace and Majestie divine, Great Lady of the greatest Isle, whose light like Phoebus lampe throughout the world doth shine," Sherlock said.
Sherlock heard John shuffling around, taking her shoes off and putting her stuff down. Even though they normally hated it when John went off on a boring date with a predictably normal guy, tonight it would be ideal if John would just go away.
He'd only meant to give Sherlock a quick peck, very chaste, and not at all unusual for an ordinary couple to engage in. However, even that seemed to startle Sherlock, who jerked his head back. John's lips ended up connecting with Sherlock's right ear.
They swirled their coat around their legs as they ran and grinned. Back when they'd first become a couple, Sherlock had bought a long coat and had worn it for years, until it was well worn out. John had bought them this new one for their birthday, and it still smelled new. It was a bit more posh than their last coat, that was for sure.
"Donovan."
“Sir John Watson, at your service,” the knight said helpfully. “In case it wasn't apparent?”
Since his marriage to Mary had ended, John hadn’t once looked in a woman’s direction, and Sherlock was optimistic that perhaps John would simply give up on women and stay with Sherlock at Baker Street.
Sherlock pinched his lips together, but didn't protest again.
"You will not be conducting experiments at all," Mycroft admonished him. "Your experiments are generally very destructive, and that was when you were human! I imagine that experiments involving dragons would bring about ruin to the kingdom."
"Lestrade's crew, I suppose, but we'll be there if I insist hard enough," Sherlock replied. "And I will. Haven't had a case this engaging for ages."
*~*~*
"Sherlock?" he said tentatively.
"Not what I meant," Sherlock protested, but no one was listening, too busy making up rules for their new game of drunken darts.
John sighed and looked down at himself.
They stayed on the front step of 221b until it started raining, and they both rushed inside again. John made them tea. John wasn't sure, but he thought it might be the start of something.
“Do… do you have a girlfriend now?” Sherlock asked tentatively.
"Down on one knee here, Holmes," Donovan said, pointing at the floor.
“Sherlock, are you alright?” his professor asked from behind him. “You look rather flushed.”
John nodded, if a little warily.
"Romantic?" Sherlock asked hesitantly. "You're just telling me this so I'll let you in."
"Alright," John said, and got up. "Are we using your bed or mine?"
John fiddled with his phone, and Sherlock pulled his coat tighter around his shoulders and pulled his scarf further over his face. It had rained earlier, and was a bit chilly and damp. John seemed anxious to get back to London, but that was very very unlikely unless Mycroft sent them a helicopter.
"Where did you even find an assistant willing to work with you?" Donovan sneered. "Is he really a doctor? Let's see some credentials, please!"
"I..." Sherlock gasped. "I haven't always felt this way, or even realized my own emotional state. But everything that's happened until now has lead me to this."
Sherlock made a wordless moaning sound and squirmed, unable to move far. John rubbed his face, five-o-clock stubble rough, against Sherlock's skin. A visible shiver ran up Sherlock's spine, and John used his thumbs to spread Sherlock open.
“I thought this is what I wanted,” Molly continued. “We're free, aren't we? Why do I feel so dissatisfied?”
“You all right, Sherlock?” asked John. “You look like you’re in a bit of a daze there.”
"Why not?" Sherlock demanded, twisting to try and get the paper clip just out of his reach.
"Okay, okay," John said. "You've been so patient. Good lad."
Sherlock rapped the side of the keg. "Still full."
"Yours," Sherlock murmured sleepily, head pressed to John's chest.
John's heart thumped at Sherlock's words, holding a hand to his breast to keep it from leaping straight out of his chest. What kind of reaction was
"You did win me fifty quid," Lestrade remarked thoughtfully.
“He could be anywhere,” Malcolm said. “I don’t doubt that he’d understand the situation, given a chance. But I’d rather not give hime the chance.”
"Uptight," John replied, smiling.
This one involved tying Sherlock's elbows together and then his wrists.
"Nevertheless," John said. "Put your hands up here."
A gentle hand under his chin urged him to look back, and he complied reluctantly. He was only too aware of how his body had responded to his sudden shame, painting his face a vivid red.
Sherlock, rather than answering verbally, came down and sat beside him. He unbuttoned the cuff of his sleeve and rolled it up. John looked, and then stared. The whole expanse of his pale forearm was scarred with needlemarks.
Lestrade stumbled off of the crime scene, apparently in search of more caffeine sustenance. John remembered there was a cafe just around the corner to acquire it. As he left, a tall, black woman came in, frowning as she set eyes on him.
Come to think of it, he'd stopped asking for anything after Redbeard had been hit by a car and killed. He'd never wanted any presents since then, not if they might be destroyed. Things were so easy to accidentally break.
OOooOO
"It's stupid," Sherlock said.
"Yes," Sherlock said, voice gravelly and interested.
"Yes, well... " Lestrade shrugged apologetically. "Your name is Sherlock."
c) Text Mycroft for help
"You can always have him stand in the corner like a misbehaving child," Lestrade suggested as Sherlock finished looking at the body and came up to them.
"Yes, and they're going to be quite put out that someone burned down their favourite dealer's business," Lestrade said with a sigh. "I should probably get narcotics involved in this."
It was sloppy, because he was jerking himself off with his non-dominant hand, but this still wasn't going to take long. Having Sherlock's mouth on such a sensitive area was only half of it, the other half was the thought of how filthy he was being, and how eager Sherlock was to participate in this act.
“Wasn’t... able,” John said.
"He can keep his fat nose out of my business," Sherlock muttered in annoyance.
Xavier was a chemist. Poison. He was an accomplice to the murders.
"Thank you," Sherlock said softly, squeezing her hand.
“Plenty of time for us to make our exit,” Xavier said. “We’ll have to act fast. I don’t trust the fact that detective showed up just in time for our plan to be carried out.”
"Git," John said, shaking his head. "Wait, I don't even know your name!"
“How much good luck do you need?” asked Sherlock hopefully.
"Shh, it's okay," John said. "Just let go for me, Sherlock."
The contents of a duffle bag were easy to pack up and to carry when he abandoned the bedsit for London's underbelly. He still had a good pair of combat boots, and he picked up an old sleeping bag from a thrift store. If there was one thing that John Watson knew, it was survival. He could survive anything.
“Fine, be that way,” Sally said. She turned to John and asked, “What does he want?”
Sorry it's a bit late. I finished it up and forgot to post it. -.-
"Yeah, I see that mate," she said. "What are you gonna do with it?"
"Oh, you delicious creature," John said.
The murders had not happened at the retreat, but over the course of years at various places in London. There had been nothing solid to connect the cases yet. All the victims had been men, but the age range was broad. Nothing connected them through jobs, hobbies, or any other event. The only reason that Malcolm was suspect was because he’d been in the same hotel as one of the murdered men, and had met him in the hotel bar. He’d had an alibi, but upon being pressed, the alibi had fallen through. Malcolm didn’t know that.
“It's a murder, your favourite thing,” Lestrade said, clearly trying to entice me. “Perhaps even... a serial killer.”
“Good point,” said John. “Hey beastie, maybe back off, eh?”
"To come," John clarified.
John pulled his fingers out. Sherlock cried out brokenly and squirmed again.
"Darkling I listen; and, for many a time I have been half in love with easeful Death, call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme to take into the air my quiet breath," Sherlock said.
"Shove over," John said.
“Yes,” I said.
"Yes, yes, yes,
There wasn't any change in John's demeanor, and Sherlock silently cursed his own pitiful sentiment in stashing his violin somewhere other than Baker street. How could he still be sensitive about that, when John had left Mary and was back at 221b, and things were back to normal? The song had killed him to write, but not only was the whole affair over and done with, he shouldn't let this incident affect his composing.
"Come on, get behind this bin, we've got to wait for Mr. McTavish to leave."
Sherlock left the morgue with a bag of fresh ears and some toenails as well. He planned to do nothing but set them on fire at home in revenge for John leaving him by himself when he couldn't talk. Burnt toenails had a very distinct scent, and he hoped John wouldn't forget it anytime soon. That would teach him to abandon Sherlock in the middle of a case.
"You tit," Wiggins said. "What have you been up to, Doc Watson? I thought I told you to keep your head down, not poking your nose into the first real trouble that pops up!"
John smiled against his hair and said, "I can work with that."
“That's pretty smart,” Greg said.
He nodded.
"Sherlock, he's gone. Will you please tell me what that was all about?" John asked.
"I know, sweetheart," John said, soothingly patting his hair. "Let me kiss it better."
"Good," John said.
"Chaps, he's been identified," Lestrade said. "And it gets pretty serious after this, and I'm not sure what to make of it. This guy was an undercover cop with the narcotics crew."
John waited until they were in a fairly deserted area of the castle to make his move. Without much effort, he managed to pin the person following him against a wall.
John looked out at the Wasting Sea from the edge of the cliffs overlooking the rough and dangerous waters. It was said that there were all matters of sea serpents and giant squid and other such monstrosities living there, but no one could say for sure.
John clawed angrily at the sheets under his hands.
Sherlock didn't even bother to ask why. John was in full-on Christmas cheer, and not even Sherlock's irritation dampened it. Sherlock collapsed in his chair and waited for the hot cocoa to be delivered to his hand from John.
They had both been rather more honest than first intended. Sherlock looked down at his folded hands, avoiding John's eyes. Mycroft had implied to John at one point that Sherlock was a virgin, and back then, John had dismissed this information as ridiculous. Reaching the age of 32 as a virgin was almost unheard of, and among their age group at least, seen as something to be embarrassed by.
“This knight is legendary!” said Mycroft. “Surely you have heard of him? Oh, I suppose you would only know the stories.”
Sherlock screamed. John thought he could make out his name in the garbled sound, and just the feeling of Sherlock finally giving in was enough to send John over the edge untouched. Then, Sherlock's cock pulsed, spilling hot release into John's mouth. Sherlock shuddered uncontrollably and kept coming, and John swallowed around his spurting length as best he could.
Well, there was one thing he could do. Try and find out what this Merlin Consulting thing was, and trace it to its origin. It had to exist somewhere if they owned the warehouse.
Sherlock glared around suspiciously, but there was obviously no CCTV network in the remote areas on the country.
John was a bit overwhelmed not only with the attention, but by the idea that he now owed this strange man something for his generosity. John hadn't asked for all this, and now he wondered if he was expected to do something in exchange for all this. He got a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach.
*~*~*
Sherlock held up eight fingers and tilted his head questioningly.
Sherlock didn't know how something could be so perfect without breaking.
“You looked disappointed,” John said, stroking a soothing hand up his back. “Don’t be. Just because we were interrupted, it doesn’t mean it was our only chance.”
How had John looked at Sherlock last night and still been able to...
He tried again. He tried for, "It's raining again today."
"Yeah, I think we're due for a little trip to the shower," John said ruefully.
Sherlock and Gladstone didn't give him much of a chance to retreat, both of them dashing off toward the crime scene. John rushed to keep up, his limp keeping him from catching up right away. The man from the night before, Lestrade, looked up at their staggered approach.
I've been a bit busy, and I had most of this written for a while before finishing it. Sorry everyone! I will be updating more regularly now, hopefully once a week. This might take a bit of a turn for the morbid.
"Sherlock!" John gasped. "That's amazing, where did you learn..."
He started of with light touches, just the gentle pads of his fingers and the tip of his tongue tracing little lines over Sherlock's thin, cotton pants. Sherlock whined and tried to convince John to apply more pressure with another upward shove of his hips.
"I..." Sherlock said again. "I'd rather not say."
Gladstone didn't mind. She didn't nag him to do anything, didn't condemn him for failing, didn't judge him for his alien ways. She knew them too, after all. They were both far from home.
"Captain John Watson, 5th Northumberland Fusiliers," Sherlock said proudly, as if knowing John were some sort of great honour.
Sherlock just shrugged and sipped their coffee. It was perfect, as always. John knew just what they liked.
John didn't try to pull away, and Sherlock relaxed a fraction. They'd seen so many disparaging comments on the internet about what people thought about being genderfluid. A lot of people seemed to think it wasn't real, that non-binary people were just making it up, to try and be special.
"So, is this okay?" John asked, slowly putting an arm around Sherlock's waist.
He couldn't go out there. Holmes had made him look like one of them, had taken away his street identity with his dirty clothes, long hair, and beard. He couldn't go back on the street like this, he would die. He didn't even know where his shoes wet, and his bare feet could feel the scritch of gravel beneath his soles.
"What do you think I should do to punish you, Private?" John asked, circling him in a predatory manner. "You've been awfully naughty. Gone AWOL. Wouldn't want a court-martial, would we? You're going to have to do a lot to make up for that."
Hey everyone! Sorry for the long long wait. I hope this update is worth it. I've been having a stressful time lately, but hopefully I can start updating regularly again. Once again, if you feel like following me on Twitter, I'm @TeaTestosterone
"Tease that I am?" John asked, amused, but did as he was bid.
John sighed. No one ever believed him. Without a word, he unslung his shield from his back. It still shone silver and white, no matter how much he used it. A gifted mage had once given it to him as a gift because the one he usually used kept getting dented. It was round and had a white tree in the middle.
"Maigret's," John said, and Sherlock frowned mightily.
That wasn't him.
“Well, let’s not give them time to solve it,” said Malcolm impatiently, let’s get moving.
"I'm just joking, Sherlock," John said, more quietly.
“Finding them would take months or years with an army,” Mycroft said. “Armies are slow. Need to move at the whim of a commander. This mission needs one sole individual who can find the pair without alerting them.”
"Which one?" Sherlock asked gleefully, knowing full well that Anderson was almost completely incompetent at the best of times.
He felt John at his back, and turned slightly to acknowledge him. John came to stand by him, close enough that the warmth of his body heat radiated up Sherlock’s arm.
But oh, how he wanted.
"You?" John prompted hesitantly.
"I already have photos of my own," Sherlock said. "Anyway, Anderson took them. They're probably crap."
John, whose whole body was still too shaky too move much, wasn't so sure. But he was certainly up to the attempt!
There was a strange muted quality to the atmosphere, as if Sherlock shouldn’t break the thick and meaningful silence of the room as they ate. Something was at work that he didn’t quite understand, and didn’t know how to navigate. It was wonderful, somehow awe-inspiring in a way, that someone like John would do something like this for Sherlock.
It's all that I can think, and yet all I can do is stare and take in his visage, as if I'm naught but a spectator and he a spectacular work of art.
As much as Sherlock generally hated shopping, getting a brand new attire made it worthwhile. They found some nice shirts and trousers, and Sherlock wore a set out of one of the shops, revelling in their newly remade image. They were already thinking about what kinds of combinations they could make, and how they could meld their masculine and feminine images. Not usually one for fashion, Sherlock was afire with the possibilities before them. But... it was still missing something. They didn't know quite what it was until they saw it.
What to do?
"That's a good pal, I knew I could count on you," John continued blithely.
"Well, well, well," John growled. "What have we got here, all trussed up and ready for the taking?"
"Um, no, not as – not as such," Sherlock said, trying to keep breathing as John reached up and stroked the ridge of his cheekbone underneath one eye with his thumb.
“Attempt?” John said, with a smile. “It seems to me like she got away okay.”
"Well deduced, Lestrade, but if we could get back to the matter at hand," Sherlock interrupted.
"The last person left standing," John said. "But you know, winning wasn't really the point. The point was to find out as much goss as possible about your mates to use against them in the future."
"You are back!" she said to Sherlock. "Do you want your usual order?"
Sherlock made sure to dress casually for the pub. While abroad, he'd learned not to rely too heavily on his bespoke suit and intimidating coat. Dark jeans and a button-up would do.
It was necessary, however, to put up with all these annoyances until he’d finished his MSc in Chemistry and could go on his way.
Having paid for the haircut and admired it in every store window they passed, Sherlock realized that they weren't heading back to the residences, but were heading further into the bustling centre. For the first time, Sherlock didn't mind that so many people might see them, because for the first time, they felt that their outside accurately resembled how they felt.
The real problem was that I had to pretend to be... John’s... I didn’t even want to think the word in my own head. What word would I even use to describe our relationship? Honestly, ‘boyfriend’ just sounded so strange in my head that I visibly cringed at the thought. Partner? That would work better and was closer to the truth.
"I love you," he murmured into Sherlock's hair. "I love you, so much."
"We're both covered in drying come, some of which is on your face," John said reasonably.
," Sherlock begged. "I swear I'm good. I promise."
"It's amazing, love, but I really want to see what you would look like spread out across a bed," John said honestly.
At the compliment, Sherlock preened and blushed.
Sherlock sulked on the couch nursing his wound and ignoring silly John and his terribly ignorant words. A papercut hurt enough that it might as well be a sword slash! His finger throbbed, and he curled up angrily around it.
"Oh, that isn't all," Sherlock said, not bothering to hold back the smirk this time. "I've also got late birthday present fellatio on the agenda tonight at around midnight."
," he hissed.
After a while, Sherlock realized there was a commotion going on downstairs and went to look out of the window. As predicted, John was facing off with the alpha. Sherlock smiled in satisfaction, and went back to his experiment.
First of all, Sherlock wasn't a girl. They glared at their reflection in the bathroom mirror between classes, fussing with their hair. They couldn't stand it. It was so long, and Sherlock wanted nothing more than to cut it off. It wasn't just that it was terribly annoying to take care of, but something deep inside them couldn't stand to have long hair. It didn't
Sherlock got off the sofa at 10:00 pm exactly and said, "It's time to start the experiment."
Sherlock threw his head back and keened at the feeling of the plug shifting inside him.
"How do you know it wasn't me?" Sherlock asked.
Sherlock is surprised.
“I’ll keep you warm,” John said, smiling.
They hated it. Every single time they went in to get a trim, Sherlock felt the overwhelming urge to just tell them to cut it all off, to give them a buzz cut even, just to get rid of it all. The hair felt like shackles, tying them to femininity.
"Don't be mean to Millie," John scolded them. "She's a nice girl. And one hell of a flanker."
“Come on then, sleepyhead, your brother is waiting,” John said.
"Ah, ah, Sherlock, I'm wise to your tricks now," John said. "Let's go find out about this matchbox maker, shall we?"
Sherlock could smell garlic and basil from down the hallway as he exited the stairwell of their crappy building. The stairwell had smelled of an unearthly mixture of wet dog and marijuana, so the change was definitely preferable. Sherlock had gotten rained on while walking back from the tube, and his hair was damp.
That was another thing. How dare someone mess with the only thing that he had for himself? Having a wonderfully working brain and being able to communicate his thoughts was all he really had. Maybe he would gain more appreciation from being silent and unable to talk clearly.
"Your limp," Sherlock said. "You had one earlier, and I know it was unaffected. You're too proud to pretend a limp for sympathy. But as soon as we broke into the pub, it stopped. And it hasn't yet made a reappearance."
Right before he left, he looked at John again and frowned. "I could swear I heard someone say something earlier about a man with a big dog, but I can't remember what it was."
Once he got up to Lestrade's office, he found that Sherlock had already abandoned him for the evidence room.
"A bit not good?" he ventured.
"Give a patient recovering from hypothermia a room with a faulty window?" Sherlock said. "I don't think so – and if you ask the nurses, I'm certain at least one would be able to tell you that it worked fine the last time they checked."
“You're Captain of the Guard,” said John, relaxing slightly. “Why are you following me?”
And then quivered silently as he came, pulsing onto his stomach in jets of white.
inscription.
"Alright, alright. No need to ruin the mood with something I will likely find alarming," John said, rummaging around until he found one.
"Sorry," John slurred. "Shouldn't be kissing you in this state."
"Well, obviously we can't expect the princess to marry a dragon," Mycroft gestured at him.
"Sherlock," he protested feebly, as he was shoved into a taxi.
“Wait, wait!” his captive reached up and pulled back his hood.
"Heart," Sherlock said, voice steady.
"This isn't the place for us, Gladstone," John said.
“Maybe she dropped it,” he offered. “I could take a look in the bushes.”
The spring-snap of the crop made a visible shudder run down Sherlock's spine, and John smiled dangerously.
"That's a big dog," the man said, nodding at Gladstone. "Have a leash for it?"
"I'm not exactly dressed for dinner," he said ruefully, patting his layered clothing self-consciously.
There was, however, a pressing matter at hand.
To be honest, he hadn't strayed far from 221b. He'd found all sorts of reasons to dawdle in this part of the city, hoping against hope that he'd be allowed back. Low and behold, a reason had emerged from the woodworks.
Somehow, John always knew that I have feelings. At first, it pained me awfully that he knew. It’s been so long, however, that it doesn’t bother me as much anymore, and is more comforting.
"It's okay," Sherlock said, trying to figure out how exactly he'd ended up here. "I'm okay."
"Oh, please, sir," Sherlock pleaded.
We got to the suite and just before I opened the door I realized that there would be only one bed. Of course there would be. We were supposedly on a couples retreat.
"We can solve it after we get a present for Molly," John said.
Once he reached John's closed bedroom door, he suddenly knew what was wrong.
"You mean me," Sherlock said.
“Okay?” John whispered.
b) Burst out of the closet and catch Malcolm by surprise
"I guess we'll see," John said. "But this –" he tightened his arms around Sherlock, "this I could get used to."
"Is it okay if I take this out, love?" asked John, stroking his tailbone.
He was wearing too many clothes! They both were, actually, in spite of Sherlock's shirtlessness. Sherlock was still in his trousers and John was fully dressed, clothes from the night before that were sleep-rumpled and felt too tight around Sherlock now that he was lying down in bed with John Watson.
"I'm coming," John said.
John won't budge, so Sherlock tells the truth.
John had just had a long day at work. The last bout of winter flu had just made its rounds of the clinic, and he was dead on his feet. All he wanted to do was fall into his armchair with a nice cup of tea and a good book.
"John, I was wrong!" Sherlock said. "Come back!"
"Shouldn't," Sherlock mumbled, and bumped his forehead against John's.
"It's Lestrade," Sherlock said. "He never calls, he knows I prefer to text."
"You mean he hadn't at the time?" Sherlock said.
"My darling," John said.
Oh dear.
"I know you said that I was all you wanted for Christmas, but I got you something anyway," John said.
John has some experiments of his own to try, and they mostly involve Sherlock being tied up, blind-folded, and at his mercy.
“I thought I saw a shape in the clouds earlier,” said John. “I wonder if Prince Sherlock is closer than we first thought?”
"If you fall, I'm not catching you," John said.
"Satisfied?" he asked, and Sherlock hummed happily.
"I don't understand," Sherlock said quietly, looking down.
But how was he to convey this to John and Lestrade?
"I can see that this bout of Shakespeare quotes hasn't yet worn off," John said wryly. "What do you want this time Sherlock? You've already ended up in enough trouble."
Sherlock wasn’t sure what he had expected. Fireworks, like all the silly romance stories had reported, or a deep urge to press John back against the wall and snog him senseless. However, all he felt was a soft press of lips against his own, warm and somehow fulfilling. A slight shivery feeling shot through him as their lips disengaged, and Sherlock blinked.
like way?" Sherlock asked, rolling his eyes.
“Greg Lestrade,” said the Captain. “Anyway, anyone who hasn't been living under a rock knows who you are.”
Sherlock made a throaty noise and curled closer into John, who entangled their legs even more.
"Irene Adler," John said.
"That was surprisingly coherent," John said.
"Not as much like 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' as you'd imagined, right?" John said, seeming to read his mind.
Sherlock nodded frantically.
He kissed me again, quickly, like a firework taking off into the sky.
“We’re a couple for this case,” John said quietly. “We can’t just go into this cold, we’ve got to practice being comfortable with this sort of thing.”
"It has a 'stan' ending too!" John giggled.
“You’re going to be late for class,” John said as he put a plate down in front of Sherlock and kissed him.
He lasted an embarrassingly short time, his peak cresting suddenly and without notice. He shook as he came, feeling John's arms tighten around him, and he lay there dazed and spent. John's cock still nudged against his thigh, pulsing slightly with the contact.
"Well, I mean it! No! Bugger off!" Sherlock said.
There was the news anchor to track down, his husband, and the daughter of the government official. Or, I could start easy and talk to one of the hotel workers. They overheard everything.
"T-twenty, sir," Sherlock whispered, face pressed to the sheets, flushed bright red.
Sherlock visits Mr. Fielding and discovers something important.
"The culprit is getting away, John!" Sherlock seethed.
He missed John. He missed him so much his insides hurt.
"There you are," Sherlock said. "Hurry and eat, we have a crime scene to go see."
He'd called it Redbeard.
But he was only taking his gun out from his waistband, holding it ready.
Sherlock simply nodded once, forehead bumping against John's shoulder. John slid his pants down over his hips, and Sherlock helped by shimmying them down around his knees and kicking them off. John shucked his as well, and then they were naked. The intimacy of the feeling was exquisite, and it almost hurt, the feeling that pulsed through Sherlock's body.
Sherlock puts up with a party in his flat.
"Me," John said. "Ah, I don't think we can carry on."
Sherlock blushed and turned his coat collar up, hoping that John wouldn't notice. It was dim light, and John wasn't the most observant of people. It was conceivable that John wouldn't see the flush on Sherlock's face.
He suddenly sat up, causing John to disengage and watch as Sherlock reached over to search in his bedside table until he emerged with a bottle of lube.
“I can fly us there, but then I have to hide while you go into the town,” said Sherlock. “You'd be alone.”
"Pinch me, John," they said. "I'm not sure this is real."
Lestrade turned to Sherlock and sighed. "Really, Sherlock?" He turned back to John. "Not that I'm surprised that Sherlock would do something like this, but what did he do to get you to come along with him, kidnap you off the street?"
"Come on then, arm around my shoulder, there's a lad," John said, quirking a smile at him.
John sat next to him on the couch, and to Sherlock's sudden surprise, put an arm around Sherlock's back.
"Help me get a foot up, John," Sherlock demanded.
They both collapsed together on the bed, too drained from the session to bother to get up to get a washcloth to wipe them both down. John bundled Sherlock into his arms and held him against his chest, whispering nonsense into Sherlock's hair. He petted his hair and told him how good he was until the little shakes that wracked Sherlock's overwhelmed body stopped.
“Sherlock,” John said, with some exasperation. “This is not about me. It’s about you.”
c) Refocus on the case
"Obviously not well enough," Sherlock said, and disappeared down into the dark space.
Hey all, John and Gladstone are back! Sorry the update took a bit longer than I planned. Finals week, you know. I'm done that now, so look forward to hopefully more regular updates. This is sort of the end of what I think of as Part 1. John is moving on to Part 2 of his life with Sherlock and Gladstone. Hope you enjoy!
Sherlock is ready to confess! Alas for him, things don't go as planned.
As if summoned by stray thoughts, Sherlock himself ambled out across the cliffs, and upon sighting her, headed in her direction. Very carefully, he settled himself next to her, shading her from the wind with one of his wings.
They really just needed to stop being an idiot about this and go back to treating John like normally. John wasn't that observant. She couldn't have realized how Sherlock felt about the hair, as unobservant as she was. But Sherlock still felt like John should have known somehow, should have realized it.
Sherlock shook his head and threw his hands up in the air. He couldn't even properly communicate his frustration, and how John was letting him down with this.
Sherlock's scientific brain wanted to cry out in terror, that adding John to the equation doubled the variables and made their path forward even harder to calculate. John's hand slid through his hair, and Sherlock sighed, shuddered, and closed his eyes.
John reached around, his fist closing around Sherlock's cock, which was slippery with precome. John jerked him once, twice, and Sherlock howled. He came in spurts all over the bed, and then collapsed in the circle of John's arms, too tired to move.
The party he'd agreed to go to even though it was going to be annoying. What did it matter to Lestrade and Molly whether or not he came to the party?
He applied just the tips of his fingers and his nose to the line down Sherlock's quivering stomach and finally let Sherlock have the tiniest of love bites right next to one jutting hipbone.
"Very good, Private," John said. "Now you get your reward, for carrying out your punishment."
John turned to go.
"That was excellent, John!" Sherlock crowed as soon as they were back in the flat. "You handled them all perfectly. I couldn't have asked for a better assistant."
Remembering, John searched around for the key and used it to unlock Sherlock's hands from the headboard, holding Sherlock's chafed wrists in his hands.
John let the crop rest just where Sherlock's crack started, but didn't dip down between his cheeks just yet. That would be for when he had Sherlock begging for it.
“No,” Sherlock said. “We need to think of something else. If only I wasn't a dragon. We could travel around the country in disguise and explore the Seven Realms.”
“Everything else?” Sherlock asked, feeling dumb. His brain wasn’t working properly, and he didn’t seem to mind it in the least. This was okay, even if he couldn’t think.
"Good," John said. "Tell me what I'm drawing."
"Could I come near your beauty with my nails, I could set my ten commandments in your face," Sherlock muttered to himself, thinking of Chantelle.
John smiled back.
“John,” I finally said, trying not to let the annoyance enter my voice. “What are we going to do about the bed?”
Another chapter! Not quite as long as the first one, but baby steps!
He knew that he shouldn't have called John. But he'd pressed the speed-dial for John's number before he'd even thought it through. It had been such a terrible idea, especially since it most likely had to do with Mary. She was the only one that had any reason to do something like this.
After a while of just sitting in John's embrace, Sherlock's eyes were closing. Apparently being anxious for so long was tiring.
"I'll just get you some things from Tesco, shall I?" John said.
Halfway through his lab, his phone trilled, and Sherlock’s heart leapt into his throat. He accidentally dropped his pipette on the floor, but was too busy fumbling after his phone to collect it. Sherlock held his breath, even though there was only one person it could be.
"It's not that many things," Sherlock said. "Anyway, you're paying me back with your crime scene assistance later, so it's fine."
"I'll see you later, then, Sherlock Holmes," John said, and he and Gladstone slipped out and into the night.
At first, Sherlock froze in silent alarm, but gradually relaxed into John's side. He had been right, John was rather more cuddly than he'd first imagined.
"Oh?" John asked.
a) Listen to the conversation and try to ignore John
monstrosity," Sherlock hissed in return.
"Oh, I dunno... drink it, maybe?" she said.
Wiggins shrugged. "Kid that won't stop scratching. Infected, but it'll probably clear up on its own."
John set two brown ales on the table in front of them, and Sherlock took a cautious sip. Nutty, somewhat sweet. It wasn't bad, he supposed. He finished it off a lot more quickly than he was expecting to, and John went and bought him another one.
He aimed a hit at the back of Sherlock's thighs, and Sherlock squeaked in surprise. A glob of stringy precome hung from the tip of his cock before dripping onto the sheets.
"You haven't told me what they are yet, but I imagine not," John said, smiling over the rim of his tea mug.
Sherlock's tightly wound body slowly unfurled like a blossom, spreading out to welcome John into their embrace. John seemed to know exactly what to do, where to kiss them, where to touch them, in order to get them unwound.
"We're together," John said. "As together as you want us to be."
His pension was meagre, and dwindling fast – between the rent, his food, and food for Gladstone, he hardly had enough to get by. He was told to go to a therapist, he even had one recommended to him, but the idea that anyone who hadn't been there, who hadn't had Afghanistan seep into their very pores, who hadn't seen their blood soaking into the dry earth could ever understand was impossible. The wilds of the desert, the unforgiving landscape, the glaring sun and heat and dust was looking out from behind his eyes, and someone from London would never recognise it for what it was.
One of the nurses, the tag on her lanyard reading 'Chantelle,' urged a patient before her.
"Ah, you're gorgeous," he said, leaning down to kiss one of Sherlock's cheekbones.
"Yes," John hissed, and sat up so that he could attack Sherlock’s trousers.
"Sir," he said. "I'm here to receive my punishment, sir."
d) Panic! At the disco
John would just need to be careful, that's all.
“Don’t lie to me, Sherlock,” John said firmly.
"Captain Watson," she said in accented English. "How are you feeling?"
John pinched his nipple again, hard, and he yelped.
"Obviously not," Sherlock drawled, but John could see his eyes following John as he sipped his tea.
"I'm not, I'm just trying to buy something," John said, but already he could tell that this was not going to go his way.
"You're gorgeous," he said, and Sherlock made a pleased purring noise in response.
Sherlock had been kissed before, but never like this. Not as if stars were colliding and galaxies were being born, and his whole world perspective was shifting on its axis. He had thought that kissing Janine was all there was to it, but this was more than anything he'd ever experienced, shared with another human being.
"It's not important, John!" Sherlock said hastily. "Just leave it alone!"
They came into a room and Lestrade added, "He was in this room, all hooked up to IV's. Hadn't woken up yet. There were nurses constantly checking up on him, there was a police guard on the door once we figured out who this guy was, and the cameras show us nothing of what happened."
His phone beeped.
Finally, John deemed it a sufficient amount of time and made his way towards the bedroom.
"Come on, you attractive git, let's go," John said.
And oh, I loved him, even then. It was horrible.
Sherlock went over to the table, picked up the second of the monstrosities, took it to the window, opened it, and tossed it out. There was a disgruntled yell from below, before Sherlock shut the window again.
On second thought, Sherlock shouldn't have implied that. John had stubborness problems.
Sherlock tumbled into the bed, causing the mattress to jump beneath them. John grunted again and told him to just bloody settle already. Sherlock quickly positioned himself, clenched up in a tight ball. John, who was quickly slipping off to sleep next to him, didn't make any other comment on Sherlock's unplanned presence in his bed that night.
"Issit okay?" John asked.
Of course he did. Sherlock picked up the man's left hand and pointed at the man's hand. John examined it, finding the lighter skin around his ring finger.
Which was actually a possibility in this building.
I definitely haven't been keeping up with writing this very well. Sorry, it's been a few months since I updated this. I do remember to keep writing occasionally. I hope you like riding crops.
I was back in that disgusting basement, chained and in pain. I had done my best to block the pain out at the time, but it hadn’t worked. If I had wholly retreated to my mind palace, maybe I could have ridden it out. But I hadn’t, because it’s impossible to make deductions when shut up in your mind. I would never have figured out how to make the man leave the room in order to be rescued had I simply shut myself up. So I felt the pain, every second of it.
He got home and found Sherlock waiting for him. Before John could say a word, Sherlock brandished the envelope at him. John sighed – he was right, this was going to end badly.
“Morning,” he purred.
“You never got counselling for it, did you,” John said with a sigh. I didn’t answer.
Sherlock's eyes visibly dilated at John's words, and taking that as a cue to continue, John stalked towards the bed, eyes on Sherlock's helpless form.
They got another cab to St. Bart's, Sherlock parting the crowded street with ease and John following after him. Lestrade was waiting in the hospital foyer for them, and he began talking as they all made their way to the lift.
"It can't be comfortable sitting there on the floor," they said. "You should just leave."
John drank and scowled back at him. "Unfair! Just because my first girlfriend had never slept with anyone before."
John raised his eyebrows and said nothing.
"Who said anything about fair?" John asked with a smirk, before he reached down to start unbuckling his belt.
Sherlock's attempt at communicating this to John were going very interestingly.
"Open your mouth," he said, and he felt warmth as Sherlock's breath exhaled across his balls.
Sherlock didn't know what it was, maybe it was just that much closer to the edge than usual, but something catastrophic happened.
John started drawing more complicated things.
John’s fingers brushed over his testicles, and Sherlock gasped. His legs trembled, and when John finally cupped Sherlock’s balls and rolled them gently in his hand, his legs wobbled alarmingly. Sherlock sagged against John and whined.
"You have such nice hair," John said.
An older woman bustled up to them, not at all unwelcoming in spite of the late hour.
He couldn't play the violin right now, but that didn't mean he couldn't still make music. His voice, while out of practice, could certainly produce something like a song. He didn't know many songs, so he sang something he had heard on the radio while he'd been taking a cab.
But even as I said it, I felt him tighten his arms around me and I stopped. What was he doing? I blinked in surprise – John usually didn’t get this close to me, especially not on purpose.
“I can make you dinner if you - “
"Oh no," John said in a low voice. "You're not anywhere near distracted enough. But you will be."
John tried not to feel too hurt that Sherlock was only accepting his help reluctantly. Of course he didn't want John around if his pheromones were making his heat worse.
Sherlock looked at his knuckles contemplatively and sucked on the one that was bleeding the most.
John turned to Lestrade and raised an eyebrow. Lestrade shook his head and waved a hand at them.
As if sensing his thought process, John pulled away, and Sherlock gasped for breath.
Once they got him up, the ambulance attendants took charge of him and whisked him off to the nearest hospital, which was St. Bart's. John shook his head. He could hardly believe that this was the type of thing Sherlock had to deal with on a regular basis.
"Ah, Sherlock, I see you've been getting into dusty warehouses again, tsk, tsk," Mycroft said. "And what do we need this time?"
“What stories?” demanded King Alendale.
"Are you bothered by my state of nudity, John?" Sherlock asked.
Bed-sharing, as he'd researched it extensively, meant a change in a relationship. The majority of the time, bed-sharing implied a romantic relationship, or at least a domestic relationship. It only ever arose in this day and age out of trust and strong mutual feelings. It was hard to pin down, because different age ranges had different reactions to bed sharing. But the combination of socialization by gender, age, social status, nationality, and past experience made it very hard to predict the outcome.
The people at the front desk of the hospital recognized him immediately, which was helpful.
"Picture?" John asked hesitantly. "Are you sure?"
It turned out that Mycroft could stop him, actually. He had a pet wizard named Anderson who knew how to do magic. Not enough magic that he could break the curse on Sherlock, of course, but enough to confine Sherlock to the castle. Sherlock was displeased, but there was nothing he could do. Mycroft tried to assure him that Anderson was working to break the curse, but as of yet, there was nothing.
"Are you okay, Sherlock?" John's hands stopped their massage.
"But without Sherlock, I wouldn't be here," John replied.
To their horror, Sherlock felt tears of anger and helplessness welling up in their eyes and dashed them away with a frustrated hand. This was no time for crying, they had to figure out what to do about it. Panicking had lead to this situation, and panicking was not going to help them now.
Sherlock's entire focus shrunk down to where John's mouth was pressing against his. There was no calculating or thinking his way through this. Sherlock thought he might die if John didn't just keep doing this forever. Breathing was less necessary than John's mouth on his.
As he spanked Sherlock, John felt Sherlock leaking and rubbing against his leg. By the time he reached twenty-eight spanks, Sherlock was sobbing with a mixture of pain and frustration. John stopped for a moment, and Sherlock rutted against his leg.
"Nothing," Sherlock said again, his tongue feeling numb.
So, either Posh Bloke had really wanted that information, or he didn't care how much money he threw around. Since he had literally thrown it, John thought it was likely the second option. However, he didn't have any room to complain. Nowadays, fifty quid might as well have been a thousand.
Right on his slightly open mouth, he kissed Sherlock, and Sherlock whined in the back of his throat and closed his eyes. His hands, still held in John's, curled around them, entwining their fingers. John kissed him and kissed him, first softly, then hard, like his life depended on it. Then he nibbled Sherlock's bottom lip, and that sent a cascade of sensation through him that he hadn't been expecting.
That didn’t exactly make me feel better, but I got ready for bed and climbed in first, edging as far away from John as possible.

Sherlock finds a mysterious ring.

"I –" Sherlock said, eyes still wide.
John didn't seem to mind. He pulled his jumper and vest over his head and threw them on the floor. Sherlock gulped as John settled over him, and tilted his head up pleadingly. John laughed and leaned down to kiss him again. Sherlock found it strangely addicting, considering that just a few hours earlier, his stance on snogging was that it was somewhat pointless.
