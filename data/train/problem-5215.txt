“So...” he casually walks over to the coffee machine and opens the cabinet above, looking frantically around the room as he goes. “You enjoying some alone time? Quiet breakfast?”
He got drunk as fuck in one of those posh, exclusive LA nightclubs because fucking Steve and his fucking pot roast.
Steve sighs and eyes the door for a second. Sam catches this little detail and quickly walks over there and closes it, understanding that Steve wants the conversation to be private.
, he looks like a vision. The military uniform makes his impossible shoulder-to-waist ratio all the more evident and he’s styled his hair like he used to back on the USO tours. The smile on his face is blindingly beautiful as he walks gracefully, helping Natasha down the main stairs like a chivalrous gentleman. He looks… incredible. And Tony needs a drink, pronto.
Tony is way too worried about taking down mercenaries to answer. He keeps eyeing Sam, who obviously doesn’t have repulsors in his hands to fight off the bad guys so he’s just sheltering himself with his wings.
It had started innocently enough, he recalls, just some good old team bonding. But then Steve would ask Tony to this bakery in Brooklyn that had miraculously survived all these years, passing from generation to generation of owners. Then Tony would invite Steve to a baseball game - although he hated it, but it made Steve smile in a childish way that warmed his heart - and politely pretended to pay attention as the blond would talk about the Brooklyn Dodgers and how outraged he was when he found out they’d moved the team. Suddenly, they had inside jokes and shared complicit smiles across the table while the team had brunch on Sunday morning.
The elevator doors of the Stark Tower penthouse open and they stumble into Steve’s floor, laughing their asses off.
Steve locks eyes with him. The anger and the resentment is still there and Steve feels the urgent need to shake the man. This is not the time nor the place to be having petty arguments, they need to focus. He ignores him.
Tony turns around and the minute he lays eyes on Steve, his heart melts. The broad, muscled blond is looking at him like a little puppy begging his owner to go for a walk.
Tony is an inch away from him and the strong smell of scotch reaches Steve’s nose. Tony’s clutching the front of his jacket, holding him against the wall and his eyes are wild and unfocused and Steve is suddenly a scared kid again.
A finger traces the wet path of saliva, coating itself in it and to Tony’s horror he feels his cock twitch trapped between the mattress and his stomach.
“I wouldn’t leave your side,” he assures him as he raises a solemn hand to his chest and the other one in the air, as if he were swearing an oath. He drops his arms with a loud thud against his thighs and smirks at him. “Is that a yes?”
“Tony…” Steve glances around, like the walls of the compound could provide assistance in making a strong argument. “He’s complicated, Nat.”
He looks at her as she sits down in a nearby bench, carefully, like she’s facing a scared animal that could run away at any moment without warning. She knows Steve keeps everything personal - especially feelings - to himself because he has the ‘I’ll deal with my own stuff because it’s nobody’s business but mine’ kind of attitude, so this has to be approached cautiously.
, he got mad because he thought Tony deserved more than meaningless sex? He frowns, eyes glued to the blond’s face and the small, alleviated smile there.
“Ugh. Ok, let’s get this over with.” He walks towards the super soldier, whose nose is wrinkled in disapproval. Disgust, probably. It hurts to see that look on his face, so Tony looks away. Swaying slightly from side to side, he finally stands in front of him and puts his hands up. “I won’t even fight back just-” he hiccups drunkenly, “just go for it. You want the jaw? Ribs are still not 100% there yet, I think...”
“You know,” her soft, slightly amused voice startles him much less than it should, “that’s not gonna help.”
Suddenly, they hear shots coming from inside. They both look at each other and Tony breaks the silence on the comms.
He finished his expensive scotch in one sip and looked around. He saw a guy through the crowd and his intoxicated mind linked the image of his broad back and blond hair to the sight that had greeted him in the compound’s kitchen a few days ago, so he marched down to the bar.
Tony is desperate. He needs to talk to him. He needs to apologize, to tell him- He doesn’t even know what he’s gonna tell him. He just knows he needs to be by his side and that’s when it hits him: this is the same feeling he got on the field that didn’t let him think straight. He takes a deep breath and leans back down on the bed, with a little help from Rhodey, who nods approvingly.
"Meaningless sex, yes. What if he just wants me to be another one on the list? And then just go back to being friends and nothing else?" Steve looks down at his feet and shakes his head, defeated. "I can’t do that.”
I wasn’t sure if you had eaten anything so I made you a sandwich. You know the one with avocado you like? It’s in the kitchen. - Steve
He’s not even looking at Tony, his gaze is sad and fixed on the floor between them. Tony thinks he’d rather have the punch than that, but instead of dialing things down, his smart-ass mouth moves faster than his brain.
It’s just jealousy and he knows it. Nevertheless, he needs to be angry at Tony right now. He needs a reason to justify snapping at him when he goes back down and tells him he’s leaving…
. There’s lounge jazzy music playing softly as the guests leave their coats by the entrance, everybody heading slowly but surely towards the big bar placed especially for the occasion by the end of the room.
Natasha and Steve ride quietly back to the compound in their issued black Audi. He suspects she just faked exhaustion to give Steve an excuse to leave and he’s ever so grateful for that. The minute he steps into the facility, he’s already asking JARVIS to give him access to Tony’s floor.
“At Hydra we’ve successfully managed to not only recreate the serum... but the Captain himself. We made the switch in the last op he ran with his SHIELD team. Rumlow helped set it up.” He licks Tony’s earlobe and the engineer winces in disgust. “We have him now. I was to replace him and infiltrate the Avengers.” He sucks down on his pulse point and Tony has to bite his lips to prevent a whimper. “I must say it’s been
. How was he supposed to face him now? Because he would have to face him, eventually. Steve swore he didn't have anything against Tony being bisexual but he sure as fuck would have some issues with Tony drunkenly throwing himself at him. He would probably want to talk to him in a very Captain America-ish way about boundaries and shit... or worse, he'd finally take a swing at him. Obviously the friendship was ruined, there is no coming back from kissing someone against his will. Tony feels suddenly sick to his stomach and he's pretty sure it isn't from the booze only. God, what had he been
The genuine, child-like smile that spreads over Steve’s face is so goddamn endearing Tony feels the physical need to hug the poor thing. “Okay,” Steve parrots.
‘Steve’ takes advantage of the fact that Tony’s mouth is still wide open, gasping for air, to shove two fingers in it, coating them with saliva. When he removes them, he lifts himself off to crawl down his body, knees nudging Tony’s legs open.
Tony nods to himself. Good, that’s good. All the gang together, impressing the biggest fish in New York. He hates playing nice to half of these assholes, but good networking means more projects for the Foundation, and that means more people getting the help they need. It’s not just about money - he’s got plenty of that - it’s about being in good graces with investors and CEOs of different companies in various areas and have them work together to create social and environmental projects. Even if the other companies only did it for the PR, Tony felt like this was his duty. He owed it to his mother to make sure this organization fulfilled its purpose.
“Oh, this?” Steve looks down at his uniform and waves a dismissive hand. “Just something I had lying around in the closet.
“He has to come up eventually,” Sam reassures him, squeezing his shoulder and rocking him. “When he does, just be upfront and tell him.”
has feelings for you and, to be honest, it’s quite painful to watch you both constantly push each other away because of your own inner battles. You deserve better than that.”
Of course what Tony didn’t know is that Steve had almost had a heart attack when the man had asked him about “
‘Steve’ is pounding into him, relentlessly hitting that spot, while jerking him off at the same pace. Neither of them last very long. Tony comes first, screaming Steve’s name, his orgasm hitting him so hard he sees little white dots behind his tightly closed eyelids. ‘Steve’ follows soon after, groaning at the way Tony’s clenching around him rhythmically, still riding the post-waves of his orgasm.
Tony leaving for Malibu, the guy in Tony’s room, the argument in the gym. Returning to the workshop, the talk by the bar, the guy at the party, the fight on the rooftop. He sighs, something heavy pressing onto his chest. If he could only be honest…
It takes a few seconds for Tony to process, this dominant behavior from Steve being extremely unusual, but he does what he’s told without complaining. He’s been trying to get him to do this forever, so now that Steve’s found his confidence, he’s not going to ruin the mood. He lies down on the bed while he hears rumbling sounds, but waits patiently until he feels the mattress dip by his side. Tony lets out a small gasp when he feels Steve grabbing his wrists and closing a pair of cuffs on them and around the top of the headboard.
“I- have you confronted him about it?” Rhodey asks, exuding calm and logic. That’s infuriating to Tony.
there. Tony wants to mentally kick himself but the thought occurs to him that he’s so fucking out of it, he wouldn’t be able to find his own ass if he had a map and two hands. “What else do I have to do to prove to you that I care-?” Steve sighs, gaze falling again, exhausted. “It’s like after all this time, you don’t even know me.”
“No, you’re the most stubborn of them all!” Steve quips, effortlessly holding the piece of metal. Tony is inches away from him and his eyes immediately follow the motion of Steve’s biceps as they flex.
reason for you to be angry at Tony, but feelings aren’t rational, Steve” she looks at him with a soft, empathic gaze. “I get it. I really do.”
He looks at Sam, blinking in confusion that quickly makes way for a blood-freezing terror expression as his friend’s eyebrows go up and tilts his head forward. It’s a ‘you
Steve’ fingers him rapidly. One, two, three fingers, easing the ring of muscles open and oh, Tony feels the most amazing mixture of feelings he’s ever experienced. He feels hot and needy and guilty and embarrassed and it’s so intense he’s convinced he’s going to pass out when he finally comes.
When ‘Steve’ removes his hand, he’s panting, neck uncomfortably twisted to look at the blond in disbelief.
‘Steve’s hands leave him for an agonizing moment and he can’t suppress the disappointed groan. Tony can hear the sound of a lid snapping open but his head hardly registers anything other than the aching need in his groin. He sighs, relieved, when the hand wraps around him again, the hot feeling of the flesh against his length easing his mind. A finger slips into his tight hole and he gasps. He’s so ready, so ready for this.
like Steve at all. Although his kinky ass had been trying to get Rogers to engage in some slightly more out-of-the-ordinary activities for as long as they’d been together, the answer was always a resounding no. Of course Tony loved doing all those things for Steve, but his cock twitched in his pants every time he thought about Steve tying him down and just having his way with him. He’d even suggested once that Steve topped and the look on his boyfriend’s face had been one of pure terror.
Tony loses his patience and closes the tiny little space between them. This kiss is nothing like the one on the roof. This kiss is heated, it’s wet, it’s passionate and deep. It's full of longing and emotions and secrets and pain. Tony's lips dance softly against Steve’s like waves and, after what feels like a lifetime, he pulls away to breathe in harshly, opening his mouth just a little to let his tongue poke out and slip past the blond’s parted lips. He tries to hold back and not ravish him, but when their tongues first touch, Steve
“Oh, honey, wouldn’t be that big of a loss, really.” He winces at his own comment. He’s always self-deprecating when he’s drunk and he knows how much Steve hates it.
Steve stares at the man’s back and shakes his head, tempted to just walk out, but ultimately decides against it. He can’t take anymore of this situation, so he closes his eyes and breathes deeply.
“Open wide, sweetheart, and suck it like you mean it.” The first thought in Tony’s mind is that he wants to bite it off and spit it out. ‘Steve’ must have seen it on his face because he adds “Oh, and I wouldn’t try any stunts if I were you. It might be the difference between life and death for your beloved golden boy.”
“STARK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” he hears Steve howl through the comm - he must have had it switched off before.
Steve feels a shudder run through his body. The fact that Sam is openly speaking about it, like it’s no big deal at all, it’s both liberating and… unsettling. He’s been hiding for so long, trying to
. Tony’s playing him his songs. He briefly wonders if this is a drug-induced delusion, given he still feels a little lightheaded from the sedatives.
He hears the metal bar creak and bend slightly under his grip. He forces himself to take a deep breath, trying to remember to remain calm.
Steve lifts his gaze to the large windows of the compound and stares into the dark of the night. “I don’t even know where he is right now.”
He’s gonna do everything in his power to avoid the bastard because he’s pretty sure if he runs into him, he’ll Captain-America-kick his tiny, irritatingly round ass into oblivion and he’s not sure how he’s going to explain
“Yeah...” Tony quickly backpedals as a defense mechanism in the face of possible rejection. “I mean it’s fine if you can’t, no big deal, it was just an idea...”
from your trauma, you’ve even forgiven your father, because that’s the kind of man you are. A compassionate man, a
He eyes their thighs, brushing together. He doesn’t want to lose his friend, he doesn’t want to face the rejection. He settles for playing dumb.
He resumes his work on Natasha’s weapon, stealing wary looks at the phone every couple of seconds, the frown on his face growing deep with concern.
A silent tear falls down as he slowly pulls back a little, bringing one hand to cup Tony’s bearded chin and tilt his face up. The damp, dark eyelashes framing a couple of unfocused chocolate brown eyes lift up as Tony looks at him silently.
The blond climbs on the bed again and straddles his shoulders, his large red cock dripping already, only inches away from Tony’s face. ‘Steve’ holds it in his hand and taps the smaller man’s lips with the bulbous head.
, you pretentious douche,” he spits out, his voice full of anger. “And yeah, I guess I should have known you were cool with it since you were so nice about it the other day-”
“JARVIS, be a dear and restore Colonel Rhodes’ ID card’s access to this floor, will ya’? And let him know.”
“You’re right,” he repeats with a sigh, looking out the floor-to-ceiling windows and contemplating the New York skyline "I haven't shared enough of me with you." He rubs his hands together, Tony notices, just like he always does when he’s nervous. There's a long silence in which neither of them speak or look at each other. The air in the room is dense and Tony keeps looking down at the glass in his hand, waiting, not knowing exactly what for. Then Steve takes a deep breath and speaks in a very soft, very low voice. “When my father lost his job, he started drinking heavily. Soon enough he lost all touch with reality and he would just sit in that couch, staring into the void and occasionally yelling at us. At first it was only yelling, name calling, that sort of thing. But it got real bad real fast.” He stops for a couple of seconds and it’s quite obvious he’s trying to keep his voice steady. “He couldn’t hold down a single job for more than a couple of days because he would show up wasted. Then one night, my mom was making dinner and they started fighting because he had been fired again, and he just.. snapped. Slapped my mom right across the face. Broke her lip. I was scared, so scared Tony, but I just ran and threw myself on top of her, begged him to stop. He took out his belt-”
“Then he doesn’t want to talk.” Natasha says softly as she puts her legs up and rests them on the cushions, eyeing him from the couch. There’s a silence that follows as Steve lets those words sink in, until Nat finally breaks it. “You kissed, didn’t you?”
Tony’s half-way through a bottle of scotch, splayed out on the sofa, the warmth of the booze spreading nicely through his body and numbing his brain. He needs the numbness now. He hopes that if he drinks heavily enough, the alcohol might be able to wipe out what had happened on that roof tonight. It's not just that he doesn't want to think about it, he needs it to be gone, erased from existence.
is unpredictable, Steve! Living is dangerous by definition! You can’t realistically treat your personal issues as if you were coordinating a STRIKE operation. Of
“Well, you know-” the blond lowers his gaze feeling his cheeks burning. He wishes he didn’t have to say it out loud. “That I’m… that I like...”
Tony reads his movements well enough and runs after him, catching him right before Steve can open the access to the roof and violently shoves him against the wall, using his own body to pin him down. Steve could easily break free but his mind is blank.
“Yes, you are!” She looks astonished, like she can’t believe Steve doesn’t get it. “All that strategic military thinking and you can’t see the obvious, vicious pattern you’ve both fallen into lately? You get close but not close enough, he tries to compensate with someone else because he thinks he can’t have you, you get mad about it, you fight.
Predictably, and much to Tony’s amusement and delight, Steve’s cheeks turn a bright shade of pink as he laughs and walks back to the couch. There’s a short silence as Steve settles back in his spot and Tony goes back to work, but then… “I guess it is.”
But the Captain had been quick to turn his head back to Fury even though he couldn’t help the clenched jaw that settled in and he still hadn’t been able to get rid of.
Tony shivers. Not so much at the touch of Steve’s hand against the warm, pulsing skin of his cock but at the unfamiliar grin plastered across the blond’s face. There’s something about that grin... teeth showing, eyes dark and narrowed. There’s something exciting but at the same time unsettling about it. Tony can’t quite figure out what it is yet.
So they went back to where they were before the whole gym incident. Even better, in Steve’s opinion. Somehow it felt like an invisible wall between him and Tony had been knocked down, so when the genius asked if he would ‘give him a hand in the workshop’ while his ribs healed, Steve couldn’t help flashing him a genuine, blinding smile of happiness.
“Oh, you do. You want it bad.” He speeds up his ministrations, relishing on the way Tony trashes around and pulls at the cuffs that keep him strained to the headboard. “Will you scream his name when you come on my cock, Tony?”
Steve feels his heart skip a beat as he raises his head from his hands and freezes on the spot, locking a wary gaze with Sam. He must be talking about the whole homophobia thing, surely.
“I thought you wanted me to give you a hand?” Steve reprimands him, “What good am I around here if you don’t ask for help?”
Tony gives him a small, tired smile. “What you are is a pain in the ass, but you already know that, right?”
He opens his eyes and he still has his faceplate on but the suit is rebooting. He lifts it off and when he looks around, he wishes he hadn’t.
Nat has turned his back against the counter, leaning on it as she eyes him silently and sips her coffee. Tony has never been more jealous of the woman. God, he
“It’s been an honor, Capt’n” he says with a cruel smile on his face and salutes ceremoniously towards the device.
Steve panics. It’s one thing to talk to Nat about this - not that he actually ever told her, she’s just that unnervingly good at reading people - but Sam… He feels like it’s so unfair to see him in a different light when he’s proven himself far more than worthy of his trust, but… he’s never talked about this with another man other than his priest back in the ‘40s. He remembers how that one went. Besides, Sam is straight, doesn’t he… wouldn’t he care that he was…
changed.” She half-sits over the back of the couch, standing next to him and crossing her arms. “That little stunt Tony pulled back at that HYDRA base? That’s not an Avenger worried about his teammate, that’s a man who’s in love letting the heart take over the brain. The team is
you do it, but you can’t keep hiding here. You’ve missed training, you’ve missed debriefings and you’re barely eating anything at all.” He walks towards the elevator and he only turns around after he’s pushed the button. “He’s not Howard, Tony.
Rhodey is puzzled, gaze lost somewhere in the distance. He keeps frowning in disbelief and this makes Tony’s blood boil. Why isn’t he outraged on his behalf? Why does he even doubt for a second that Steve would pull that kind of crap? The guy walked in that star spangled outfit like he had a huge metal pole up his ass.
The blond smirks in amusement, lazily stroking Tony’s cock and palming his tight balls, tugging and rolling them in his other hand.
And so Tony does. By the time he’s in his boxers, he really does feel exposed. He looks at Steve, although he can’t really see the expression on his face, and grabs the waistband. He can feel the other’s piercing glare on him as he steps off of his underwear and stands there. He hears the quick breathing coming from the armchair and after a while, he begins to feel kind of uncomfortable, so he starts walking towards Steve.
“Okay, I may have asked Romanoff, who - unsurprisingly, may I add - had seen you take the fire escape stairs.” He throws his hands in the air as a sign of defeat. “But, in my defense, I came up with the fake explanation on my way up, so-“
Tony’s just sitting there in his sad little wheelchair, working on some unfinished projects on his StarkPad, eyeing the blond every couple of seconds. He’s been trying to concentrate, but everytime he looks up and sees Steve something tightens around his heart.
“The reasons why I can’t tell him the truth haven’t changed, Nat.” He places his hands on his hips as his gaze falls to the floor. He remembers the desperation and the sadness in Tony’s voice.
A pathetic little moan escapes him, as well as a silent tear from the corner of his eye while he chokes on ‘Steve’s cock and his own shame.
in his bedroom.” Steve winces at that, shifting uncomfortably on the bench. “Why do you think that is?”
Steve had been okay with RSVPing yes to the Maria Stark Foundation Annual Gala since it was like… a month away. But November 12 came around a lot sooner than he’d thought.
“How many times-” Steve starts complaining with a tired sigh, extending his arms in an attempt to take it from him.
“Uh-” when Tony finally speaks, Steve’s suspicions are confirmed. He’s stammering. “Well- I just wanted to say hi, I guess.”
He doesn’t want to think about it. Yet it’s all he’s been able to think about since this morning’s meeting.
-, Black Sabbath playing in the background. His phone is sitting next to him on the table and on the screen there’s the face of a very annoyed James Rhodes.
The big, strong pair of hands grab both of his cheeks and spread him open, the cool air hitting his hole and making Tony gasp.
There’s a long silence and Tony doesn’t even realize he’s holding his breath until his lungs start burning from the lack of oxygen. Steve’s eyelids are barely open, he’s falling asleep again, but before he does close his eyes, he whispers:
“What? Do you want me to put on a show for you?” the smaller man says, halfway through unbuttoning his shirt.
Why?! Why did he have to have a stupid school-girl crush on Steve “I’m practically perfect in every way” Rogers? He was a grown ass man for Christ’s sake!
“Whatever they’re looking for, we can’t let them find it first.” Nat comes in to save the day, as usual.
“I- well, you never...” Tony’s mouth had gone dry, something warm and pleasant pooling just above his groin. “I thought you didn’t like that.”
but look after all of you-” his voice breaks. Steve’s color drains from his face as Tony tears his gaze from him and angrily walks away.
I'm sorry this took a little longer to go up, I took a break for my birthday. Hopefully this chapter makes up for the wait and don't worry, we're finally getting there between this and the next chap ;)
Steve pulls back at the same time he frees the top button of his pants and undoes the fly, slipping a hand straight under the waistband of Tony’s boxer briefs and grabbing his hardening cock.
, Cap?” It’s barely a whisper, full of loathing and revulsion. “Gonna make you feel all manly to punch the faggot in the face? Go ahead, do it. Be a good ol’ American
“Does he, really?” Natasha tilts her head and narrows her eyes, a soft smile on her face, like she knows something Steve doesn’t.
She steps between him and the full length mirror and adjusts his khaki tie. He’s wearing his dark green military uniform because Nat had convinced him it would be a nice touch, given there were going to be several vets and high ranked officials in the crowd. The silly amount of decorations and medals hanging from the breast of his jacket already makes Steve deeply uncomfortable. It’s so
Tony forces himself to look away and turn around. “Of course I’m feeling okay. Don’t be such a mom, Rogers. I’m
risk the lives of anyone in this team just because we can’t leave what’s happening between us outside the field. So just tell me now, because if you can’t, be damn sure I
“Does anyone have any questions?” Steve looks around and no one says anything else. “Very well, then. Get your stuff, we leave in an hour.”
Rhodey rolls his eyes as he shifts from foot to foot. “That is completely false and you know it. I’m not taking anybody’s side, I’m just saying, the guy tried to reach out! In his own way, but he tried. Just- talk to him.”
He watches Natasha approach him from behind in the reflection. She looks stunningly elegant and graceful, as usual, in an impossibly tight fitting red dress. “You look far from ridiculous. Everybody loves this look, Rogers.”
. He pulls away from the blond’s mouth for a second and takes advantage of the move to trap the full, plump lower lip gently between his teeth and pull. Steve moans,
She’s using that socratic method he profoundly hates because it’s always very effective. He knows there’s no fighting it though, Nat won’t leave it alone.
It's already on the tags and all but in this chapter, past episodes of domestic violence and alcohol abuse are mentioned and discussed so if this triggers you proceed with caution.
!” Tony throws his hands in the air as he practically spits out the name, like it’s venom drawn from a wound. He shakes his head in disapprovement. “I’m telling you, that guy’s head is still in the fucking 1940’s.”
Tony doesn’t really want to talk about this. He wants to move on, leave the whole thing in the past, but the question leaves his mouth before he can help it.
. It’s not Steve because his cheeks aren’t covered in that adorable pink blush that always creeps up on him when he’s fully naked in front of Tony. It’s not Steve because his impossibly blue eyes aren’t full of love and adoration, but dark with lust and a menacing glint. It’s not Steve because there’s an evil grin where his sweet, shy smile usually is.
Rhodey walks out of the other side of the flashy black Audi and stands uncomfortably next to him in his Air Force dress uniform, giving nothing but a polite nod towards the crowd cheering Tony’s name.
A hand flies to his mouth to muffle him. From the corner of the eye, he can see the man above him leaning down to whisper on his ear.
and this was so fucked up. Oh, how he would have loved Steve to get a little rough every once in a while and just use him, like this one was doing. He would have loved for Steve to talk really dirty and maybe even tell him what a cute little slut he was while Tony blowed him. He tried as hard as he could but couldn’t help his hips buckling up, looking for friction. This
... this inexplicable situation unfolding in front of him right now makes no sense at all and it's making his blood boil.
Steve’s hips roll against his and Tony’s head falls slightly back, letting out a loud, wanton moan that was by itself an answer. Steve seizes his opportunity and latches onto his exposed neck, licking and sucking and biting. Tony moans again but his brows are furrowed. What’s gotten into Steve? This is... so not like him.
public events where he’s in the spotlight because it reminds him of that time he was used as a publicity stunt. Tony sighs, mentally kicking himself for even bringing it up.
He feels his abused asscheeks being parted wide open and a warm, thick liquid running down his crack and over his hole. He’s spitting on him, Tony realizes in disgust.
He keeps chanting in his head, in a desperate attempt to control the physical reactions he’s having, because this
She snorts. “Tell me something I don’t know.” She pauses and lifts up a brow. “Besides, you’re no walk in the park either.”
Tony finally turns around, his eyes gleaming in the dark, ferocious, and he howls. “Don’t give me that
“Will-” the blond shifts his weight from leg to leg, clearly a little uneasy. “If I were to go, would you, uh- be around? I don’t really… I’m not very good at the big crowds stuff, you know?”
to stop what’s going to happen. Tony’s lips are so close Steve can feel their shape against his own even if they haven’t touched yet, a sort of warm weight on against the skin. Tony’s voice comes out harsh, in a whisper.
“Steve, if it’s not something you feel comfortable doing, that’s just fine. You don’t have to.” Tony’s smile is long gone and he’s looking at his friend with a firm, serious expression on his face.
. Me? I’ve just followed in his footsteps, repeating the same mistakes he did. You were right tonight” a tear finally escapes him “I am a mean drunk, just like him.”
“It could be,” Sam says, then falls silent for a second, but Steve shoots him a ‘don’t bullshit me’ look and he laughs loudly. “Okay, it probably won’t be, but at least you could be honest with him, get it out of the way...”
. But every time he picked up the phone, something had stopped him. It felt intrusive somehow. Yes, they were closer now than they had been before - not that that was a big accomplishment considering where their relationship had started - but that didn’t seem like a good enough reason to just call him out of the blue to ask if something was going on. So he would put the phone down, clenching his fists, resisting his urge to check up on him. Until the perfect excuse had presented itself: Fury had called an Avengers meeting, something about debriefing them on new intel they had acquired on an important arms dealing organization they’d been tracking for a while now. It was short notice, so they’d figured they would just video call Tony.
“I’m-” he backs away even further, horrified. “I’m sorry,” Tony says, avoiding his gaze as he shoves a very confused, very paralyzed Steve out of the way and rushes through the door.
“Yeah... you’re hating this.” He hears ‘Steve’ laugh softly in amusement and God he wants to die of embarrassment. “I guess that’s why you’re spreading your legs for me like a bitch in heat, isn’t it?”
Tony comes back to himself a bit after that, and the realization of what’s happened hits him as hard as a brick wall.
“Just because he likes fellas doesn’t mean he likes me, Nat. What if- what if I tell him how I feel and he just laughs in my face? Or
, you’ll get a chance to see your precious Stevie again. If you try anything or scream for help, he will die and it’ll be on you. Do you understand?”
Steve’s so startled by Tony’s anger he steps back a little and almost trips on a bunch of little trees. He’s fucked up. He’s fucked up bad.
When he wakes up, he’s in a bed at the compound. There’s an IV line attached to his left arm and every single muscle in his body aches. He tries to sit up and he groans as a blinding pain spreads through his chest side. He instinctively brings a hand up to were the arc reactor used to be.
“This thing.” Steve has a worried look on his face, his eyes searching for Tony’s. “Where do you want me to put it?”
for so long… And suddenly it’s nothing to worry about. He doesn’t have to pretend, he doesn’t have to fake it to be respected and taken seriously. A part of him feels amazing about it, but the other doesn’t really know what’s next, because he’s never been in this situation before. He feels his eyes tearing up a bit with the weight of it all and he’s mortified. His mind automatically screams
Weeks passed as Tony slowly recovered from his injuries - much slower than Steve, obviously. The super soldier was already out of the compound’s hospital bed and beating up punching bags in a little over a week. Tony, on the other hand, had to refrain from heavy lifting and any kind of exercise for four to six weeks and he was going out of his mind by week two.
He walks the red carpet like he always does. Tony’s a socialite, he’s been doing this for ages, so it’s easy for him to just hide behind the clown make up and put on a good show. He turns slightly to Rhodey.
He’s looking up at him, a terrible glint of victory in his piercing blue eyes. Fuck, he’s beautiful.
” he repeats sarcastically, brows flying up his forehead. “Sure, Cap. Wanna tell me what’s going on?”
“The truth, Tony. That what he said hurt your feelings. Hear him out, maybe he wants to apologize...” Rhodey explains as he sighs, the way you would when you’re trying to make your point to a five year old.
or whatever the fuck you think it’s right for me.” He’s sneering now, the brief glimpse of sadness replaced by anger. “Maybe you’re not even a homophobe at all. Maybe you’re just
. How did he not realize sooner? As if he could read his mind, fake-Steve kept going. “What’s your precious little boyfriend going to say when he finds out that you didn’t even
those were the words that had never made it out of his mouth. Steve would have never called Tony a...
She walks towards him. “You’re right, you are opposites. And sometimes that works to our advantage because what one might miss, the other spots. The skills one of you lacks, the other compensates for. You keep saying telling him how you feel would change things for the team, but things have
Tony’s shout is the last thing he hears echoing through the gym as he leaves the room. And it hurts, because it’s true. He really is a coward.
“It’s been a week, Tony,” he hears the man’s exasperated voice through the device. “I swear to God either you let me down and talk to me or I’m getting in the Iron Patriot-”
He starts walking angrily through the room, looking for an alternative escape route that doesn’t involve the front door. He sees a window of opportunity when security isn’t looking and he pushes the fire escape door open.
“Just promise me you’ll go easy on the ‘wine’ part, though.” And that’s enough to make them both break in laughter. Tony in bewilderment and Steve in relief.
Just a few minutes go by before he hears the elevator doors sliding open. He doesn’t bother to look up though, it can only be…
“Oh, I’m a changed man, Tony. I realize now how much I’ve been missing being so... uptight and righteous all the time.” He grabs him by both sides, sneaking his hands under Tony’s suit jacket, and forces his body flat against Tony’s. He hears his own surprised gasp when Steve’s cock rubs against his through the fabric of their suits. “Wanna have some fun, sweetheart? Looks like you do.”
Steve - the real Steve - does cry, though. He can no longer feel the cold floor of the cell under his knees. He can no longer master the strength to fight against the shackles that keep him secured to the wall behind him. What had previously been screams of agony and anger, muffled by the gag in his mouth, now turned into sobs of pain. When the live feed of his own bedroom cuts off and the monitor in front of him goes dark, he does. He cries.
, but you’re just like me, Cap!” He turns around quickly - bad idea, because the rapid movement almost makes him lose his balance - and points an accusatory finger at him. “Worse, even!” He shouts and, slowly this time, turns and resumes his walk towards the sofa, huffing. “After all these years, the most personal things I’ve learned about you is that you had a barbershop quartet - which I don’t even know if it was a joke or you were telling the truth - and your mother cooked pot roast. Everything else I know it's from my dad's stories and the footage from the 40's. Half of the time I have no idea what you're thinking... always standing there with a cryptic look and that permanent frown like your butt itches but you can't scratch it. How can I know you, huh? It's not like we hang out and do Feelings Friday, passing around a teddy bear and talking about our emotions and shit. So yeah, I know I'm not good at it either, but you don't get to play the victim here when you're exactly the same!” He lets himself fall heavily onto the large leather sofa, suddenly tired. “So
Her scrutinizing gaze and her spot on analysis leave Steve’s mind in a haze. He thinks for a minute, really trying to come up with something else, anything else. He finally gives up with a sigh - he might as well come clean.
A woman makes her way towards them. Steve backs away a little to politely make space for her to join them, as Tony awkwardly smiles, stalling while trying to remember her name but failing miserably. He settles for the ultimate life-savior: “Hey,
Tony races through the crowd. He calls Happy and tells him to get the car, not bothering to stop when a few people approach to talk to him. He needs to leave.
Natasha yawns as she stretches over the couch while Steve’s left gaping in the middle of the common living room.
“Ba- baby?” Tony tries to speak although he feels like all the blood in his body has gone to his aching groin.
Steve knows Tony’s landed in the compound. JARVIS warns him, just as he explicitly asked the AI to do the minute Tony announced he was coming back.
, because that’s what his father used to scream too. Men don’t cry, specially not in front of other men. Looking back on it, maybe Tony was right. Maybe there was something buried deep within him that was wired to hate this after all…
“I’m not disabled, Rogers!” Tony protests, offended, trying to shield the object from Steve’s grabby hands.
“Let me go,” he murmurs, and there’s a hint of sadness there that Tony will surely miss, because it’s Tony.
“Yeah, you got it.” Tony doesn’t even know what he’s agreeing to because his mind is somewhere very, very far away. And is that the Sleeping
“What do you want from me?!” The gritty shout comes off muffled against the collar of Steve’s jacket, where Tony’s head is buried, and he can’t take it anymore.
“I know, I know...” Sam nods and goes silent for a moment. “It’s just- he’s really having a hard time, you know?”
I can promise.” The words make Tony tremble underneath him. What? What the hell is going on? “Now, I’m gonna take my hand off of that pretty little mouth of yours and you’re gonna be a good boy and you’re not going to scream. Are we clear?”
“Tony…” Steve whines between hot, open mouthed kisses, but he’s decidingly pushing him off and Tony feels he should feel embarrassed by the whimpering noise he makes when they pull apart.
“No, I mean about the other day, in the gym.” Steve feels good, he feels ready to come clean. His head is flying high in the clouds… it weighs nothing at all… this feels
Rhodes looks at him intently, calculating his next move. Tony can see how he’s carefully constructing his next question - because of course there’s gonna be questions. He leans against the desk next to Tony, sticking his hands in his pockets.
It takes him a minute to register, but when he does he can feel his eyes tearing up in pure joy: he recognizes the sweet, deep, beautiful voice of Miss Ella Fitzgerald echoing softly through the room, telling him to
And that’s the last straw for Steve as he breaks down, silently crying, the tears finally running down his cheek. This doesn’t help Tony’s state, because he’s barely holding back his own. He glances at the bottle and his nose scrunches up, suddenly disgusted by the sight of it. He doesn’t know how to comfort him, what to say... because he knows well enough that nothing will ease up the burden of those memories. The only thing he can do is return the trust Steve has offered him.
Tony opens his eyes and watches the naked body before him. He can’t help being slightly aroused at the sight. It’s Steve but it’s not
“You could at least put on a robe, Stark,” Fury had said, unimpressed by the fact that Tony had answered the video call in only a tank top and underwear, sitting on the side of his bed.
“He left for Malibu,” she repeats, confirming the fact. “And a few days later, we contact him and there’s a half-naked
And right there, for a second, in a blink-and-miss moment, his eyes landed on Steve. Not on Nat, Clint, Rhodey or Sam.
He looks terrible. Dr. Cho has taken him off the sedatives, so now it’s only a matter of time before he wakes up on his own and the serum is healing his wounds faster than any human body could possibly recover, but still…
Steve is deep in concentration hanging from the pull up bar, barely breaking a sweat, when he hears his voice.
Steve purses his lips and furrows his brows sadly. “I’d be fine if you were around, though,” he says, half smiling and blushing a little, a hopeful expression on his face.
“Use your words or I swear to God I’ll spread your legs open right now and fuck you raw.” ‘Steve’s threat comes as an enraged whisper, which makes it all the more terrifying.
.” He looks seriously at the rest of the team. “We can’t let that happen under any circumstances. Are we clear on that?”
“No, the shawarma joint,” Tony says with a completely straight face which makes Steve throw a surprised look at him. The brunette rolls his eyes, amused. Steve can be
Steve nods very slowly, like he’s in front of a wild animal than could easily rip him apart at any second. “Yeah?”
“Hey, I’m gonna head to the bar, want something?” he says to Rhodey, turning around and forcing himself to tear his gaze away from the blond.
Steve had tried really hard not to eye the screen in a lustful way, keeping his gaze either on the documents in front of him or his own lap.
Tony is in a haze, the lack of oxygen and the absurdity of the whole situation making his head feel light.
Tony’s nowhere to be seen. Sam and Nat have tried to keep him company, but Steve’s figured out when there’s a couple of them together, people only spot them faster. Especially if Natasha’s around, she’s a frickin’ magnet in that glorious red dress.
His friend nods and his characteristic lopsided smile settles in his face. There’s just something so endearing in the way he keeps his head a little bent forward, like he’s expecting to get petted for being a good boy. Tony has to shake that thought away because it makes his mind go
He places his hands on both sides of Steve’s head as he deepens the kiss further, tongue exploring the welcoming warmth of Steve’s mouth, breathing heavily as they kiss. Tony can’t fucking believe it when he feels Steve kiss him back, a little shy and tentative, his hands running delicately but firmly up Tony’s back, like he’s holding onto him for dear life. He can feel the heat of Steve’s palms through the thin fabric of the shirt and,
“Huh?” The brunette swallows as he looks up and shakes his head almost, the movement almost imperceptible.
“Well, he tried to come down to the lab that same day- with the ridiculous excuse to bring me food or something.” Tony was starting to feel the anxiety building up in his chest, as he brought a hand up to tap where the arc reactor used to be, absentmindedly. “I mean, can you believe that clown?”
.” Tony blinks. This conversation feels so surreal that it borders on ridiculous. He wants to laugh his ass off, but Steve looks so exposed and vulnerable right now, he feels he might take it the wrong way if he does. He blinks again. “Okay.”
Tony blinks a few times trying to focus. His friend is sitting on a chair by his side in sweatpants and a t-shirt.
In the conference room of the compound, JARVIS had projected the screen where Tony would usually sit. Steve and Sam sat to his right and Nat, Clint and Rhodey to his left. Fury, as usual, stood across from Tony. Or in this case, the screen.
“Because Tony likes sleeping with everything that moves.” He can hear the bitterness and jealousy in his own voice, and he hates it.
He roughly withdraws his finger, making Tony pant in discomfort and easily grabs him by the hips, turning him around. The chain on the cuffs twists at the motion and pulls at his wrists and Tony winces, now looking up at the ceiling of Steve’s bedroom.
And Steve sighs. Deeply, like a child who’s just been held and told everything’s going to be okay. His shoulders relax, his muscles soften under Tony’s palm and the genius could have
, but well... he would get riled up even faster than usual once he’d had a few of these.” He wiggles the scotch in his hand and puts the bottle back down. Steve looks at him and frowns. His eyes are red and confused and even more blue if that’s even possible. “Yup. There were two things that the mighty Howard Stark, proud founder of Stark Industries and advanced futurist, could not tolerate: someone who was better than him at what he did and men who liked to suck dick. Sadly for him, his son was both.” Tony laughs bitterly, and it’s his turn to lower his head, gaze fixed on the ground between his legs. “What a disappointment I was... He was always talking about you, you know?” Steve shoots him a surprised look. “Hell, I even used to dress up like you when I was a kid. Fake shield and all. I wanted to be like the great hero, the great Captain America.” Tony lets out a sarcastic chuckle, the burn of unshed tears in his eyes as he glances at the bottle. “But see? This is precisely the difference between you and me, Steve. You’ve
trying!”. Well, he shouldn’t have been an asshole in the first place! That way he wouldn’t have anything to be sorry for, now, would he?
Tony had always had an irresistible charm and a witty sense of humor that had people wrapped around his finger in no time. This was no exception. He was pretty: blue eyes, strong features, broad shoulders and nice, toned muscles. Tony had to order more drinks every time what’s-his-face opened his mouth, though. Man, was he
“Forget I said anything, really. It was- I’m sorry,” he quickly apologizes, turning the chair around, ready to resume his tinkering.
“And tell him I have-” Steve feels the words die in his throat. God, he can’t even say it out loud to Sam, let alone confessing to Tony. “He- It would break the team up.”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he says as he cradles his left arm and stacks three of boxes of capsules against his chest.
Nat and Sam are hunched over something in a blue suit… and there’s whole lot of blood on the floor. He immediately tries to get up but his body protests.
“Exactly,” Fury agrees, his eyes hard on Tony as a form of warning. “Captain, coordinate the team and ambush them. If we can take them in, maybe we can find out who they’re working for.”
And Steve winces because that hurts. It hurts a lot. He’d been honest with Tony about his anxiety when exposed to big crowds and now he just used it as a poisonous arrow, aimed directly to cause pain. He’s angry, he’s disappointed and he remembers the young man at the party and his nostrils flare and it’s all too much. He feels his upper lip retract and he spits his next words like they’re venom.
“Sure.” Steve’s smiling and he’s too close and too gorgeous. A little, almost imperceptible frown appears between his brows. “Just… please, don’t… don’t drink too much, okay?”
“Look at me.” Tony reluctantly lifts his gaze, blue piercing pools looking down at him. “That’s it, baby. I wanted my last night with you to really be
She smirks proudly, closing her eyes and humming in agreement. Steve paces the room, trying to clear his head and
. “When you and Sam barged in, they set off a bomb to give them enough time to make an escape. You were too close. Steve shielded you from the blast...”
“Do you want to carry our friends’ bodies to the Quinjet, Wilson?” he practically shouts at him. “We’re going
He frowns when the blond lets go of his hand and leaves him in the middle of the room to sit in an armchair by the window. The lights are off so Tony can only make out the silhouette of the chair against the night city lights of New York.
Steve winces at the words as if Nat had just stabbed him in the gut. “I don’t- I’m not pushing him away...”
“You know? I know you don’t remember him like this, but my old man was kind of an ass too.” He grabs the bottle from the table and looks at the liquid. “He had a thing for this as well... He was never...
Steve feels like the room is shrinking by the minute. Every time someone walks up to him and starts chatting away, it creates a ripple effect and suddenly he finds himself helplessly surrounded by at least ten people. When his anxiety starts taking the best of him, he politely excuses himself and makes his way through the crowd as fast as he can, only to cross the room and hang out on a different corner. He’s been repeating the same procedure for nearly an hour and a half.
He hears the man hum in approval and the bed shifts. The sound of him fumbling with clothes makes his stomach drop. This can’t be happening.
Steve is painfully aware that if he acts hostile towards Tony, the other man is going to have absolutely no fucking clue as to what is going on, because the last time they saw each other they were having pot roast and sipping red wine by candlelight. It didn’t really make any sense for Steve to be suddenly pissed off at him, so he vowed to keep his cool.
Everybody leaves the room but Steve frowns following Tony’s movements and after a moment of indecision, he goes after him.
Tony’s protests had been quickly ignored by Fury, who’d moved onto the actual debriefing, clearly wanting to end the meeting as soon as possible. Steve had to use all his willpower to stay focused on the man as he spoke because the only thing he’d wanted to do was turn to his left and look at Tony. It had been three days and it was scary how much he’d missed the guy.
, Tony wants to play him like a violin and get more of that beautiful music out of him. He’s still pretty drunk so he stumbles a little as he brings a leg up on the couch to kneel on it and braces the other foot on the ground. He rises up in the air a little, roaming his hands all over Steve’s uniform jacket as he gently - but clumsily - pushes him back against the sofa.
He jumps in the air like a cat when he feels a big hand tap on his shoulder. When he turns around, he can’t believe his eyes.
“Tony had earned a reputation by the time you met him, yes, but he hasn’t been living up to it. When he was with Pepper, he didn’t fuck up a single time, and now that they’ve broken up and he’s been free to have sex with whomever he wants… he still hadn’t, not until now.” Natasha leans away and lifts a brow, knowingly. “Makes you wonder
“There’s only one thing I want, Tony. And you’re gonna give it to me willingly.” ‘Steve’ pushes his finger in and Tony clenches his jaw shut. “Just like every night for the past few weeks. You’ve moaned while fucking me, telling me how tight I always am... telling me how much
? He sighs. Nat’s words sting like a bee hive but he knows she’s absolutely right, specially about that last part. He remembers Tony’s damp eyelashes and desperate eyes, looking up at him in agony. '
Tony returns to his chair, trying to hide the wince of pain as he sits down. “Hey, by the way,” he adds casually “I already told everyone else in an e-mail but since I know you’re still stuck in the stone age...”
“He’s not just working, Sam. He’s actively avoiding me.” The blond closes his sketchbook and throws it along with the pencil on the bed, frustrated. He sits by the edge of the mattress, resting his elbows on his knees and running his hands through his hair. “How can I fix this if he doesn’t even get out of that goddamn lab?!”
me, Tony.” Steve shoots him a sad glance, even though the other can’t see it. “I told you this wasn’t easy for me, you said: ‘I won’t leave your side’...”
She stops pacing and looks at him, waiting. He understands he’s supposed to fill in the blank and so he does with a sigh, because he’s been over this in his head a billion times already.
He’s almost too distracted, playing nice to some wealthy clown in an insanely expensive tux, and nearly misses the crowd going wild behind the glass doors. He eyes the entrance and spots his friends walking in. Sam and Clint look sharp in their suits, and then there’s-
“I want you to be honest with yourself, Steve” she says, matter-of-factly. “I want you to be able to say ‘I was jealous and pissed off’ because you trust me, because we’re
. Trust me, if you keep waiting for the opportune moment, you will miss out on everything in life.” She sighs and looks away, like she knows what’s coming next is going to hurt. “Plus, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but your current brilliant
He grins, knowing exactly what the effect of his words on Steve is going to be, but going for it anyway. “Then it’s a date.”
Tony nods and makes his way through the crowd. It takes him a good ten minutes to reach the other side of the room but he greets everyone politely and holds their hands, offering his best smile. That doesn’t mean that by the time he makes it to the bar he’s desperate for a glass of-
He wants to snap at him, he really does, but he’s way too focused on this goddamn stupid mission and Steve’s hurtful words are still echoing through his mind.
He walks up the stairs, stamping his feet as he goes up. He shouldn’t even be here in the first place. He hates this circus of handshaking and taking selfies and smiling at people who are rude and entitled.
man, who let the sadness and the alcohol get the best of him, and that turned into a bad man. I don’t want to see that happen to you... and that’s why I hate that bottle glued to your hand. I hate it
Meanwhile, Rhodey and Hawkeye keep their position on top of the building; Tony and Sam are hiding behind a bunch of containers facing the facility south. If someone comes from behind, Clint will take them out silently.
Steve goes stiff as a board as Nat sweetly kisses him on the cheek and turns to leave the gym. He shakes his head, willing the thought away.
He’s thrusting into ‘Steve’s hands shamelessly now, desperate for release. His whole body shivers when he feels a finger slipping into his crack and teasing his hole. Without a second thought, he immediately bends his knees upwards, baring himself to the man.
Steve, who’s backed up slightly and is looking at him with that annoying puppy eye look, holds up his hands.
said. Luckily, he managed to pry it out of Tony before admitting to anything and immediately felt relieved. A drug-induced love confession wasn’t what he’d had in mind.
Tony, I made a fresh pot of coffee. Not sure if you have any left down there. Left you Fury’s files on those mercenaries we’ve been tracking. I hope everything’s ok. - Steve
“Ho-” his voice breaks down and he clears his throat, hoping Rhodey will think it’s from his throat being dry. “How is he?”
Sam frowns and his smile fades away slowly. “And you do a great job at that, Steve. Nobody would ever respect you any less because you like men.”
Steve finally lets go of the bar and his feet hit the floor with a loud, menacing thud. He turns around slowly and he instantly regrets it, because Tony’s just standing there awkwardly smiling and looking like a million bucks in one of his three piece suits. God, he wants to go over there and shake that annoying little man like a piñata.
Revulsion invades Tony as he slowly eases his mouth open and let’s ‘Steve’ feed him his cock. The taste, the shape, the musk... everything is so familiar and yet wrong. The minute his lips wrap around the head and his tongue swirls around it, he hears ‘Steve’ moan loudly and the sound makes his own cock twitch. He closes his eyes in shame. He’s disgusted at his own body right now.
Tony blinks a couple of times, like his brain is working on making sense of Steve’s words. When he does, he snorts angrily. “Oh, I’m sorry Mrs. Doubtfire, I didn’t realize I was being babysat tonight-“
Steve is trying to decide - or rather, overthink, as he usually does - whether or not to say those last words aloud, but Tony’s so close, and his breath is so warm and damp and it’s such a contrast against the icy wind around them. Steve knows he should move, he should pull Tony away. The smell of scotch is a constant reminder that the man in front of him is not in his right mind at the moment, but his lips are slowly parting on their own accord, unwilling to stop what’s going to happen.
Steve can feel every muscle in his body tensing up, like he’s waiting for a metaphorical blow that’s taking too long to land. When he finally speaks, his voice comes in a low whisper of disbelief.
. He’s laughing at him, he’s going to make fun of him, ridicule him. But when he’s able to actually listen to it, he realizes his friend’s laugh is gentle, soft and honest.
He feels every single ounce of dignity leaving his body and now there’s only pleasure. All he can think about is that huge cock breaching his hole, filling him up so much that there’s no space for thoughts of any kind. He moans loudly, throwing his head back on the pillow, mouth watering in pure pleasure. He’s chanting now, he can hear himself, far away.
Steve abruptly stands up and moves away from her, shaking his head. Natasha purses her lips, immediately noticing how her friend has just shut down. Walls are up, conversation is over.
“Wow! Careful there, genius!” Steve puts an arm around his waist, picking him up a bit off the floor like he weighs nothing. “Wouldn’t want that valuable head of yours cracked open, now, would we?”
He’s not angry or hurt, he’s... playful. Tony furrows his brows. Steve’s been acting quite weird lately. He’d been sent on one of his SHIELD secret operations a couple of weeks ago and since then, Tony’d been noticing some subtle but certainly out of character reactions and comments that made something in the back of his mind itch uncomfortably, but he’d just dismiss his thoughts rapidly. His incessant paranoia was something he was fully aware of, so he tried to control it every time he felt it creeping up on him.
Steve grabs his wrists to stop this madness and Tony reacts violently, trying to shove him off, free himself from the blond’s iron clad grasp and punching him in the chest, grunting. Steve feels his eyes water as he forcefully envelopes the smaller man in his arms and Tony finally gives up and starts sobbing.
“Mm...” the taller man looks around, a little uncomfortable all the sudden. “It’s very impressive and-- uh, crowded.”
there’ll be risks and things might go wrong, but you can’t possibly predict that. And in the meantime, you might be missing out on a chance to be
Nat’s smug smile against her coffee mug as he ashamedly disappears into the elevator. Damn her and her silent but highly effective interrogation techniques.
When Fury’s message had woken them up, the guy had asked if he could shower before he left and Tony has never been a complete asshole, contrary to popular belief, so he’d said yes. And then the goddamn conference call.
“When I couldn’t find you anywhere I figured you wouldn’t have left, since that’s rude, so you might have gone for some air. You wouldn’t have used the front door since-” Tony hiccups and looks around, making an outraged face, like he doesn’t know where that awful noise has come from. “Since there’s plenty of press there. So… the roof.”
Steve is sitting on his bed, legs bent upwards to serve as surface for his sketchbook. He’s very still, trying not to move a lot so he doesn’t scare the couple of hummingbirds hanging out on the branch directly next to his window. He looks down at the paper: not his best work. There’s a knock on the door that startles him and he shifts in the bed abruptly. He watches with sadness as the couple of birds fly away.
Tony lifts his head, concern and a growing horror plastered across his face as ‘Steve’ looks up straight into the surveillance cameras that hang from the corners of the ceiling.
. You ain’t exactly the most open person in the world, so don’t give me crap for not knowing what goes through that vibranium skull of yours.”
Steve glances up occasionally, keeping an eagle eye on the smaller man as he tinkers away, while he draws in his mysterious sketchbook. He immediately jumps off of the couch and rushes to Tony’s side when he catches the genius trying to lift a heavy piece of metal. Dear Lord, it’s like he’s babysitting a three year old.
! It was hurting the illusion, because Steve was actually really smart, so Tony had quickly asked the guy to get out of there and go back to his mansion.
and he’s getting angrier by the minute. Curse his stupid OCD. “I can’t believe you’re all taking his side!”
Why had Steve pushed him away? What had he done wrong? Wait, was he- did he read this wrong? But he had kissed him back! Tony’s head feels like it’s been hit by Mjolnir all the sudden. Steve must recognize the terror in his eyes because he’s quick to clarify.
feels like a punch to Tony’s gut and he feels a little lightheaded and nauseous all the sudden. He blames it on the booze, not the fact that Steve sounds incredibly sad and disappointed. He considers apologizing for a split second, but then his drunken mind tells him
“Are you telling him to come talk to me, too? Because offering food and coffee doesn’t count as an apology for being a homophobic asshole last time I checked.” He grabs every mug, trying to decide which one to use, but
“Where is he?” Steve realizes his voice sounds slightly aggressive but he can’t bring himself to care about manners now.
Steve stirs in his sleep and Tony doesn’t think twice about it, he leans forward in the wheelchair and places a hand over his arm to still him.
After what seems like an eternity, the blond lets go of Tony’s head and pulls out, a string of spit connecting his cock to the abused pair of panting lips.
Tony gasps, outraged at the blond, and narrows his eyes, a momentary distraction Steve takes advantage of to softly but firmly grab his arms and motion the piece towards his own chest.
Captain America watches his mouth around people, but in the privacy of his own thoughts he swears like a drunken Irish man.
Steve frowns and thinks for a few seconds. “I should wait until it all cools down, then try to approach him and talk to him, let him know he did nothing wrong. He was inebriated, and I was the one who should have stopped it. Of course, I have to be careful, I don’t want to hurt his feelings again-”
Some random, blond, tall, muscular guy in the background of Tony’s bedroom, stepping out of a door dripping wet, in nothing but a small towel wrapped low around his hips.
“If I say something and for some miraculous reason he wants the same as I do - which let me remind you, Tony Stark does
They had gotten back to the house and the dude had sunk to his knees immediately, taking his cock out of his pants and blowing him off. The room was spinning. He closed his eyes and tried to lose himself into the fantasy of Steve’s warm mouth, placing one hand on Steve’s strong shoulders and the other one on the back of his head as it bobbed up and down. He remembers moaning a lot - had he said Steve’s name at one point? - and coming with a loud cry. Relief and content had washed over him for a brief second, until he had looked down and his stomach had clenched in a nauseating way. He remembers pushing those feelings aside and giving the guy a quick handjob out of pure courtesy, all the time feeling completely detached from the situation, gaze lost in the darkness of his bedroom wishing it to be over as soon as possible. After what’s-his-face came, he wiped his hand and pretended to fall asleep.
“Mercenaries were discussing who was taking the intel to the boss and the argument got heated, a few shots were fired,” he pauses, apparently trying to decide the best way to go on. “Steve and Nat were hidden and had turned off the comms to avoid being detected, so when you tried to contact them, they didn’t hear you.” Tony frowns and closes his eyes. He didn’t… He didn’t think of that. He could have asked JARVIS to give him a scan of the room to check for Steve’s and Nat’s body heat signatures. He could have approached carefully and tried to get a visual on them. He could have done so many things - less risky things - but as soon as he heard the gunshots all he could think about was
Steve groans and picks up the pace to get to him and when he does, he takes him by the arm and turns him around. Tony tries to get away, an outraged look on his face, so Steve grabs his shoulders and traps him against the wall, blocking him with his own body.
Then he’d been apologizing over and over again for not being able to give Tony what he wanted and Tony had spent what should have been a perfectly good night of endless sex comforting Steve instead of fucking him. He swore to himself he would never ever bring it up again. He loved Steve more than he’d ever loved anyone and if he wasn’t comfortable with something, then that was off the table and he wouldn’t love him any less for it.
When Tony finally emerges from the workshop, he’s in desperate need of a shave. And caffeine. It’s around eight in the morning so he knows Steve is probably on his morning marathon - why does he run so much? He doesn’t even need it! But that’s beside the point: Tony needs supplies and this is a safe window of opportunity to get them and not run into the super soldier. He carefully tip toes his way into the silent kitchen, mentally crossing his fingers, and his entire body relaxes when the only thing he can spot is the back of a red haired head.
“Let’s review those reasons for a second, shall we?” Natasha says casually, standing up from the couch and walking slowly around the room.
So he’s just standing in his - eighth? - corner of the night, hoping the event will be over soon because frankly, he doesn’t know how much longer he’ll be able to keep this up, when he spots him from across the room.
“The change in the relationship dynamic could affect the team and jeopardize our duties as Avengers.”
This time, a string of harsh blows have him crying out in pain. There’s no comforting caresses in between, no time for the sting of the slaps to die down, no sweet words of love. This isn’t for his pleasure. Steve is actually hurting him,
that.” Natasha steps into the room and looks down at the mess, a sarcastic smirk on her face. Steve is careful to avoid her gaze while he grabs another bag from the floor so she takes that as permission to go on. “Are you gonna keep punching the shit out of those, or would you rather talk about it?”
Tony scrolls through his phone and snorts. Why did he have to sign all the texts? And what was it with the food obsession? That idiot. He has a feeling Rhodey would have had something to say about the texts, though… He can practically hear him: “Tony, the guy is
Steve just sits there, legs sprawled, elbow on the arm of the chair, hand caressing his own chin while Tony takes his clothes off under his intense gaze.
“But-” Steve sighs, something heavy floating away from his shoulders and something else settling in. “Don’t you think less of me? I- I’m supposed to lead this team...”
She gets out of her hiding spot and easily climbs the facility’s east wall, setting into position right above one of the guards. Steve circles the west wall and whistles. One of the guards walks over to inspect the noise and Steve wastes no time grabbing the man in a choke-hold, cutting the air off and leaving him unconscious, while Nat drops over the other guy and does the same with her legs. They drag the bodies out of sight, then Steve uses the code JARVIS has given him to open the door.
"I think we've established we don't know each other as well as we thought." It's more of a whisper than anything else but Tony's mouth parts in surprise and Steve is
She finally glances at him and gives him a ‘I’m sorry but someone had to say it’ look. Silence falls between them when Steve looks away, rubbing his face with his hand. Isn't that what he's been doing all his life, though? Waiting for
Tony’s lips come in contact with his own, parted ever so slightly, letting both their breaths mix between their mouths and then Tony closes them over Steve’s lower lip, barely applying any pressure at all. As he pulls away, their lips come apart making a soft, wet, almost popping sound that travels like a warm stream through Steve’s body and pools at his lower belly, sending a jolt to his groin. The sound of their rapid, shallow breaths is deafening in Steve’s ears and it only adds to his arousal. It’s like he’s
He sighs and Tony can see how his chest falls into a soft up-and-down slow movement. He’s out again. The genius can’t move. Steve didn’t get mad at him because he was with a
The order sends a shiver of anticipation down his spine. He doesn’t know what the fuck’s gotten into his boyfriend but he likes it.
They sneak around until they catch up with the mercenaries, silently following them from a distance.
He feels a shudder as the knuckles make contact with the punching bag and the sound echoes through the big, empty compound gym.
