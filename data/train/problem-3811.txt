He wondered if even a hunter would take him at this point. Or if…
It had been the worst kind of agony, standing outside the rift. Waiting. Hoping. Sam couldn’t see inside the blackness, he couldn’t hear anything.
and I just can't get the words out, naturally, I mean, I can
"What? Yeah, sure, I'm fine—Cas and I were just wondering how it's going. Y'know. With the vamp research."
He can’t help but think about what he just did.
Insults, he could deal with. Death threats? Even better. But compliments… honest to god compliments, not just cheap pick up lines? That was something new.
like?"
Dean bit his lip, stifling the snarky flirtatious answer that instinctively came to mind.
That's why Cas had seemed so…
SO LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK BECAUSE YOUR COMMENTS GIVE ME LIFE!!!!!
—issues extended far past John's close-minded opinions. Sometimes, he had to stop himself from reading a full section of Dean's thoughts, because delving into that level of pain…
The bar was crowded and rowdy, just the way Dean liked it. Even though it was only late afternoon, the dim lighting and musty atmosphere made it seem much later. There were already a few wasted drunkards slopped lazily over the bar's glossy wood countertop. Dean knew the feeling all too well.
“Who are you?” Dean and the mystery man say at exactly the same time.
“Hey, Charlie!” Sam greets the tired hunter at the bunker door. “I have some tea in the kitchen. Want a cup?”
"Okay now I just…" he carefully slipped the triangle off, and steadied his cue stick, aiming straight for the top of the pyramid. With a firm strike, the balls scattered across the green felt, ricocheting off one another with heavy thunks, a sound now both familiar and comforting to Dean.
"Oh you gotta be kidding me." Dean gave him a look and laughed. "Man, I guess you're the ghostbuster today, Sammy.
It didn't matter if Dean did not care for him in the same way. Dean was the only thing he had, along with Jack and Sam.
"yeah, sorry, I'm here."
Dean was almost surprised at how content he felt. It was the closest he'd ever felt to peace. Cas was here, and there was nothing to kill, nothing to run from; it was an unfamiliar feeling, having
“I like the sound of that.”
Love ya'll. I hope you're doing well.
Laughing, Dean grabs up his keys, plants a kiss on his angel’s apron-draped head, and heads out the doorway, his chest bubbling with laughter, with lightness and—and—
nooo,
He flipped it over and read:
"Ouch, okay. How do you know I'm homeless?"
Sam sat back in his chair and groaned, massaging his eyes. He'd been reading excerpts from Charlie's list for a couple hours now, and was starting to think that even fanfiction might be preferable to Chuck's books. Besides the incredibly creepy feeling of reading about yourself from an outsider's point of view, he also had to read his brother's thoughts. And since Charlie's list consisted of mostly Dean and Cas moments, he'd basically been given a front row seat to Dean's innermost feelings regarding the angel.
And so it goes. Cas and Jack begin what will probably be a
The bell above the entrance jangled as Cas pushed open the door to the video rental shop, and the sound sent a jolt through his stomach. It was all too familiar. The dim fluorescent lighting. The cheap tiled floor. The small square room, with the glass doors, and worst of all, the bell. An employee standing at the counter to his left greeted the newcomers with a vaguely bored, and obviously well-memorized, salutation. He was wearing a blue vest, with a lopsided name-tag pinned to the front, reading
“Okay, Dean, now start telling Cas to look for the portal!” Jack yells.
"Screw it,
"Cas, what—"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"ah, ha! See, toldja."
Charlie clapped a hand to her mouth. "
Of course, the noise had only made Dean happier, despite Sam's complaints. So when Dean had left to grab some dinner for a long evening of organizing, cataloguing and unboxing, Sam was more than ready to get rid of the monstrosity for good. That's when he saw Dean's last sentence, right at the top of the sheet:
couldn't even tell if you were in love with them, or just desperate for affection and too damaged to know the difference, and then you go on a lunch date together and said angel friend expresses his opinion of you and every word of it is like being simultaneously punched in the gut and kissed full on the lips because you can't believe he holds you so highly because you've done so many things that would prove otherwise and then you're alone and you want to kiss him but you can't because you DON'T KNOW IF HE FEELS THE SAME WAY AND DAMMIT—
It seemed love was happening to everyone but Sam. Charlie had found another hunter named Stevie on her evil-toy case. Claire had visited a week after they returned from the hospital, her sarcasm and snark only barely softened by the presence of her now-girlfriend, Kaia.
And then seeing Cas’s vessel, Cas’s
It was quiet for a moment, but more comfortable than any silence in a long time. Peaceful. Cas seemed to have that effect, at times.
—and then the panic sets in, and along with it, the realization that he may be a reckless fool after all.
But that wasn't why Dean would remember it. It happened so quickly, when Cas caught him looking over, when he smiled so softly, and Dean felt an involuntary smile tug at his own lips, and Cas didn't look away, just gazed at him, and even when Dean faced the front, he could still
PLEASE LEAVE YOUR COMMENTS AND JIBBERISH DOWN BELOW, because you have no idea how excited it makes Blu and I to read them all <3 <3
It was Cas's name he'd screamed in that warehouse. Even though Amara had been right there.
Cas frowned. "Yes, I am being serious."
Sam blushes. “It’s because I love you, that’s all.”
And sometimes, Dean wanted to escape his life, his thoughts, and occasionally, even Sammy.
As the fic is almost over, (god it makes me sad to think about) I want to particularly thank onloveslightwings2266, LovelyOtt98 and WantstoFlyAfraidToFall
Cas noticed his hesitation. "If you are not comfortable talking about it, Dean, I understand."
Her name was Eileen Leahy.
He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt this way with any girl. Maybe never.
Cas wondered how many things he would not understand, how many valuable elements of life he would be ignorant of… if it were not for Dean.
On the other hand… if Charlie had been able to figure out Dean and Cas's obvious chemistry by reading 'Carver Edlund's' not-so-popular book series depicting their lives, then maybe he
“That’s it Cas! You’re clearly in pain, and I don’t know why you’re being so damn stubborn about this car.” He got to his feet. “Get dressed—feed the damn cat, whatever else you need to do. Then we’re going to see this car.”
“Oh, ya know.” Flushing, he glanced in the rear mirror, avoiding Castiel’s gaze. Nice one, Dean. Tell the poor fiance that someone’s after his man. Though, he kinda thought she was.
It’s been too long since he last came home, but he hasn’t had time, what with The Project and his teaching.
“I did hear about that,” Charlie murmured, her eyes closing again. “Ellen was horrified he’d accused you.”
“I think
“Yeah. Not gonna happen,” Dean said, helping him up, with a hand to his elbow. “My treat.”
“Everyone else has family,” he repeated, dully, his eyes watering in the low sun. “I know. It makes sense.”
“That was Bobby’s place, when he first had the yard. Home for me an’ Sam too. Hard to believe now, seeing the place he’s got with Ellen.”
Castiel hurriedly drew his hand away. He swallowed, and stared through the windscreen ahead.
“Sit down then.” Dean nudged the chair under his legs and pulled Castiel into place by the elbow of his trench jacket. “Okay Sam, sounds like Cas has given me the floor. Nice surprise that, by the way. Couldn’t have mentioned it earlier, I suppose?” He rubbed the back of his neck. “Well, uh, you mighta heard us having a bit of an argument the other day, but we’ve uh, I think we’ve got over that now…” He glanced over, uncertain.
At that point the buzzer goes off in the kitchen. Getting to her feet and tottering towards the door, his mother beckons.
it has been a strange few days.”
Groaning he reaches into his back pocket for his cell-phone, but it’s gone. Fuck. Could his day get any worse? Well, apart from the sex stuff. That was pretty awesome. Suddenly grinning, despite everything, he peers back through the broken window, into the gloomy interior. It must have fallen out his pocket as he was wriggling through.
him, the others too.”
“Here, stick your head on your knees. You funny about blood or something?”
“Dean! You don’t have to get me—get us—an engagement present!”
After all, Dean’s suspicious instincts had certainly been right when it came to Castiel himself, even if the call from the hospital had temporarily muted his misgivings.
“You too, Jo,” Dean said, as Ellen hooked her arm around Castiel’s elbow. “I’ve just gotta check the oil. Don’t eat my pie!”
“You feeling better?” Dean turned and gave him a searching look as they reached the sliding doors of the blood clinic.
“Now we’re for it,” Dean muttered, as she strode down the path. “What the
like a lifetime for you, but it happened so quickly I couldn’t even get to you.”
Sam’s top of the range Iphone lay there, lifeless, and his beautiful coat was folded up at the bottom. There was also a satchel with some papers in, probably work files, and a brown paper bag.
Dean grins.
“We’ll pick some up on the way back to your place,” Dean said firmly, and Castiel’s mouth opened. “Oh yeah, I’m not leaving you to walk home. Sam’d kill me if I left you to pass out and fall in the river.”
He shook his head. ”No, it’s fine. Um, you didn’t have to come all this way out to see me. We could have done this on the phone.”
Castiel scrubbed his brow. He knew Balthazar in one of these moods. He was never going to get a straight answer so the best thing to do was get rid of him so he can turn his mind to how, exactly, he was going to tell the Winchester-Harvelle-Singer family that he’d been lying to them since Christmas.
“Yes… I suppose so.”
There was a gasp for Ellen, and Jo hid a chuckle behind her hand.
“I’ve been waiting all my life for a road trip,” he said, wistfully, crushing down a pang at the reminder. The deception was always easiest when he was out and about with Dean, only to be pulled back to reality whenever Dean mentioned Sam, his ghost, silent and accusing, between them.
“It’s an ice rink out there." Dean sighed. "I’m just lookin’ after you, for Sam.”
“But they don’t know!” She stared up at him, her lips trembling. “Ellen doesn’t want them to know. She told me yesterday that meeting you has kept everyone’s spirits up since Sam’s accident, and she doesn’t want to ruin that by telling them
He turned, and his jaw dropped.
“That’s true,” She looked him over for a full minute, frowning, before appearing to come to some decision. “I don’t really know what to say here.”
Sighing, Castiel closed the door. Below, in the hallway he heard the front door slam. Charlie, finally reassured that Ellen would remain in blissful ignorance of their deception, had gone home for a belated post-shift sleep. He rubbed his face. What on earth was he going to do now? The family wanted to invite him over for dinner again, and he’d have to find an excuse. The only way to get through this would be to avoid all members of the Winchester-Harvelle-Singer clan, until Sam woke up, and they could come clean. Charlie may have promised to explain it all, including how Jess and Charlie had railroaded him into it, but he had no illusions that that would help.
“She’s truly wonderful, Dean.”
Castiel glanced up from his form. “What?”
He gave her a small smile.
Bobby shuffled on his feet, before heading over to the drinks cabinet in the corner, and extracting two cut crystal tumblers and a bottle of Scotch.
Castiel turned from where Pamela was chatting away to Sam. His gaze met Dean’s, so green, so very hard.
“For pranging Baby?” Garth shrugged and watched alongside Castiel, as Bobby shook his head, his eyes soft, and laid his hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean glanced up, and over at Castiel, before ducking his head.
“Because of the panty thing?” Dean’s grin softened as he pulled off his jacket and laid it carefully over the sofa arm. “Sorry, Cas. It was just a bit of a surprise. You don’t seem the type… then again I probably don’t either.”
The front fender was bent and hanging half off, which would explain the scraping noise they’d heard as they mounted the drive. The chrome grille was dented, the hood above crumpled, though less than he had feared. Worst of all, the right corner must have been closer to the wall, because that side was folded in, like the corner of a cardboard box thrown by a disgruntled courier.
Dean frowned. “What ya mean? Why not?
Dean filled a tooth mug with water, and brought it over to him. “Here, take this. When did you last have something?”
Slowly, he recovered from his embarrassment enough to update Castiel on Sam’s progress.
She bustled off down the corridor, and Cas collapsed into one of the hard plastic waiting room chairs. He pulled out his phone and checked the time, barely visible through the cracked screen. Four o’clock, which meant Gabriel would have finished his shift at the ticket office. His leg was aching, and he’d have liked a lift home, but he wasn’t sure he had the energy to deal with Gabriel just then. Perhaps if he walked home, slowly, and took his pain meds first. A cab was out of the question, especially as he’d need to spend the last of his month’s money on his prescription.
“If Castiel needed to, I’m sure he could prove it.” Jo raised a sly eyebrow.
“Well it’s not good, honey. You’re anaemic.” She turned the device towards him. “That blood count should be at least 13, for a guy, and yours is 8.5. I’m afraid you won’t be able to donate blood, not today anyway.”
Shivering, for all the sun, Castiel stared ahead.
“One for each of us.”
“So… er, you gonna let me in?”
guy saved Sam’s life?”
“Hurry up! I’ll miss my train.”
Somehow, Castiel didn’t think it was a compliment. He spoke rapidly as he tested the key in the lock, thankfully opening it on the first attempt.
Castiel was squirming in his seat, his eyes on the roast chicken, refusing to meet Dean’s gaze.
“You. Out.”
”We’re not hiding anything, why would we be hiding something?” Dean crossed his arms in turn.
Flushing, Dean waved his apology away. “It’s all right. Nah. I guess I just never met the right person.” He crammed the rest of the burger into his mouth and then jumped abruptly to his feet. “So, we going?”
“That’s me.” Castiel held up his hand, suddenly relieved he was to go first. It gave Dean time to run away, if that’s what he needed to do. Because unless Castiel had misheard, this was about to get very embarrassing.
“Someone made you Warren Buffet, huh?”
Gypsum chirruped at him, and he turned to see her nosing around the box still.
“He ate a rabbit and vomited in the rose-bed earlier." She takes the pies and lodges them on the hall console. "They look amazing. But three, Cas?”
“Have you seen the snow out there? It’s turning into a blizzard. I don’t even know what you were doing trying to drive on a night like this.” She puts her hands on her hips. “Now, pants off, so I can check you haven’t nicked an artery or something. I’ve just had this flooring put down and I don’t even want to try to get blood out of blonde wood.”
Castiel shook his head. “No, I mean, Dean was kind enough to offer to teach me to drive a manual car.” He thought he’d better not mention the Lincoln, as it wasn’t the car Bobby and Ellen had offered him. Dean would have to explain. “
“Staff.” Cas sets his glass on the side table, and drops onto the couch beside Dean, the better to give some moral, if unspoken, support. “I wouldn’t have been able to document the effects on me, personally, and I doubt my coworkers would have opened up if I hadn’t been ‘one of them’. They would have regarded me as a conceited academic, coming down from my ivory tower to treat them as lab rats, and they’re already marginal—.”
“I gave him the internship that won him this job, but I knew him from LawSoc,” Crowley said.
“I wondered myself,” Donna agreed. “Especially when you said you’d been so tired. Two healthy young men like you. You’re very pale Castiel. You should see your doctor to get a full blood count done. It’ll be more accurate.”

Then Mr Novak
“I’m a nurse, honey.”
actually meant. “Oh—” she continued the doorbell rang. “That must be Charlie.”
“It’s the least I could do,” Castiel replied, seriously. “Apple pie is one of the few things I can make.”
“Didn’t Mom tell you?”
“But I’ve seen him, Castiel. I’ve
And talkin’ of Professors, he’d better call Cas. Not that he’s likely to be any use with a car—after the baking, Dean strongly suspects Cas’s skills are more cerebral than practical— but Cas will know where he is, can arrange a rescue truck when Dean’s phone inevitably…
“Oh yes, you all missed Christmas, didn’t you? Someone phoned to ask if it was okay to bring some food here, something about a celebration that Sam was on the mend.” Jess raised an eyebrow as she checked the monitor. “If you want to get to know Castiel, you should give him a ride over. He injured his knee saving your brother, and he’s still struggling to get around. Probably doesn’t help that he spends so long here every evening, sleeping in that chair.”
Ellen got to her feet, and laid her hand on his shoulder. “All we know, and all we need to know, is that you saved Sam, and you’re going to marry him. That makes you family now.”
to find your fiancé’s place?”
“Nah.” Dean swung the Impala down a smaller road, the muscles in his forearm straining as he gripped the steering wheel. The Impala would have pre-dated power steering. Dean patted the dashboard. “I prefer Baby. It’s an upside of the restoration work—I get to drive Baby over to Pittsburgh, or Kansas City, check out some old beaten up classic, decide if it’s worth redeeming, work out the costs. Then either get it delivered or even go over in the truck myself. I’ll often look at a few and then decide when I get back to Chicago.” He slowed, then signalled left, as they came up to a wide metal gate. “Here we go.”
invite you over. That’s just the kind of people they are. They adopted me because my own parents died, and you
It had almost been worth it, though, to see Castiel behind the wheel of Baby, those strong, sensitive fingers curled around her steering wheel.
Castiel stepped back from Ellen’s arms, and moved toward Sam, lying silent, but perhaps with slightly more colour than before, in the hospital bed. He patted him on the shoulder, unwilling to take any—more—liberties with an unconscious man.
“…he look like?”
“Yeah, that’s it.” Dean nodded. “Sam and me, we weren’t raised like that. You see Bobby and Ellen now, and sure, they’re pretty well off, with the garage business, but when our dad died, it was just a jumped up scrap yard. We didn’t always eat properly, and that was with Ellen looking after us and doing her best. Before that, with our dad… well he
that’s not how you were raised. This family made its money from a scrapyard and a bar where I started as a waitress, so don’t you go pretending you’re at some country club in the Hamptons.
“So you said, but it’s nearly eight.”
“Can you
Where was that bloody light switch?
Castiel stared at her. Hannah was always pleasant to him—as long as he turned up on time for his shifts at the CTA tollbooth in La Salle—but she had never invited him to lunch before. As she scanned the price list on the stall, he eyed her suspiciously, looking for any sign of what this was all about.
how Dean wanted to spend Christmas Eve, getting a close-proximity crotch inspection from Mr and Mrs Stepford, aka, his new boyfriend’s parents. With another death glare at Cas, he cups his hands over his package and waits out the examination.
“Uh… okay.” A little awkwardly, Dean shook his hand. “You a friend of Castiel’s?”
“Is what over?”
when Sam was lying unconscious in a hospital bed? He turned to sample the stollen as the conversation ebbed and flowed around him.
Gently, he disentangled his fingers from Missouri’s. “Oh no, ah, Missouri, this is Castiel, he’s uh, he’s
“We’ve been waiting for you, but there’s still time for Ellen’s eggnog before dinner,” Bobby announced, drawing them into the warm, bright hallway.
“But Bobby and Ellen–” Dean broke in, his face scarlet.
“Sam’s on 500k a year, might be any number of people who’d want to lay claim to him.” Dean shot him a challenging look. “If he died, they might be hoping for some money. Insurance or somethin’.”
Dean blinked down at him. Then he quirked a smile.
“After watching you all day in my kitchen, that what I thought.” Dean winks. Cas flushes, the sappy fucker. “I don’t know what you live off normally—except caffeine." But whatever it is, it’s working.
“And that was a man, yeah?” Donna nodded, signing the form. “All right then, we’re ready to take your blood. Hold out your finger, Castiel, it’ll just be a scratch.”
He must have blacked out himself, for the next thing he knew, he was sitting on the back step of an ambulance, and a brightly dressed EMT was examining his knee.
His own heart sank, every cell in his body protesting.

Castiel’s jaw dropped. “A
Castiel bit his lip. He should have been expecting that, but there was no help for it and so he tugged his cracked and ageing smartphone from his pocket.
He could see they were fairly well off, if a little rough around the edges. New middle classes, probably. Certainly a lot better off than
Subtle, that guy was not.
“Yeah, Charlie says that too. She knows, though she guessed rather than me telling her. She’s pretty surprised about Sam though, said she didn’t see that one coming.” Dean shook his head again. “Man. I can’t believe he was about to marry a guy and spring it on the family, assuming everyone would be cool with it. Doesn’t he have doubts and worries, like normal people?”
Sighing, Cas gingerly picked up the sandwich in both hands, and Dean watched as he took a bite. He was chewing so seriously, Dean thought he could've fit right in with one of those foodie connoisseur judges on cooking competition shows. "Well?"
The dead angel doesn’t know what to say.
Dean looked shaken. Hesitant."Sure you won't go fluttering off again to start up a new 'Revolutionary Parade for Rogue Angels?' Joking. Good.
The memory felt stiff. Resentful. Distant.
Cas turned and walked towards the entrance, but Dean could've sworn he saw the angel wink.
"I learned it from the pizza man," Cas quotes, and Dean bites back a grin.
It’s only been a few hours since Dean brought back the ring. Since he’d typed out the letter. Every minute of the movie had been happy agony: the excitement of wanting to show off the ring, and
OH! And i got a twitter account… :D
Cas smiled happily, and it reminded Dean of the day the angel had watched Looney Tunes for the first time. "I wanted to get you something new, and also unusual, since you've eaten explicitly burgers for most of your life, and it is high time you—"
awkward.
Dean let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding, and as he let it out, the tears began to fall once again.
“Do you remember when I said angels choose one mate for a lifetime? And that mate is referred to as a bondmate?” Cas smiles softly. “I would like you to be my bondmate, Dean. If you are willing.”
With every good thing comes the terrible fear that someday you might learn to live without it.
. So he shrugged, sneaking a look at Cas's focused countenance.
The comment received a strained laugh. "No offense, man, but I think I'm the last person in the world who deserves 'happiness,' whatever that means. The things I've done…" his voice cracked and he flashed a weak smile, fidgeting with the salt shaker. "Maybe I'm not built for happiness, Cas."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Cas,” Dean choked out, but there were no words.
She left as quickly as she had come. It made Dean wonder how many water glasses she'd spilled so far today.
"What
"Dude. Hey. Eating is not the time for deep philosophical contemplations, didn't I teach you that?"
Dean mutters, and reaches for his cellphone. He dials the number. She picks up immediately.
Friends or otherwise, I'd rather have you here, man, I-"
They'd share drinks in the evening, maybe a game night every once in a while. Jack would enjoy that.
Dean shook his head slowly. He didn't know. He just felt suddenly as if he never wanted to listen to any other mixtape ever again except
"And I suppose you would kill them either way," Cas added dryly.
Cas seriously hoped he was not considering purchasing one of
“Yeah, alright, understandable. You can take Cas’s old room, if you want.” Sam wrinkles his nose at the mud on the shiny floor.
Cas's eyes squinted at him in worry. "Dean?"
Dean stared. He had never seen Sam act this dramatic over something. I mean sure, the guy was a drama queen, but this… It was almost enough to distract him from what Sam was saying—in between the unintelligible huffs and jumbled complaints.
"Hello there, Sammm." The witches' accent sounded flirtatious and amused as always, if perhaps a bit more than usual. Sam knew why she was calling.
But now…
Dean was starting to get pissed. He hated being backed into a corner, especially a corner that dealt with…
“Uh—”
Then he feels a strangely cold wind drifting through his body, a warm
Thank you for your incredibly thoughtful comments, and motivation, and inspiration, and for giving us smiles, laughter, and sometimes tears. (in my case aha)

"Dean?"
He had tried calling Cas. Earlier. Even though he knew it was pointless. When he’d ripped through the mattress sheets, he’d found Cas’s cell phone, lying there innocently on the floor next to the bed.
So Cas had used Jimmy's hunger as a cover up for his own hunger.
Hesitating only for a moment, Cas bit into the burger and chewed thoughtfully.

It's an angel's prayer. His last hope.
Dean was grinning at him, and Cas knew. It didn't matter what had happened all those years ago. Dean was here
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean's smug expression. "Everything is going to taste better to you than it does for me, Dean."
How they'd like to wear his pretty skin and make him do ugly things.
"Cas, hey—" Dean insisted, and the death-grip on his chin finally loosened. Cas held up a finger. "Let me take your temperature."

He stopped himself, eyeing Dean hopefully. "Could I get a guinea pig?"
Dean woke up on the very edge of the bed, face turned towards his nightstand. He felt the morning light trying to seep under his eyelids, and pulled the covers over his face, squeezing both eyes shut.
"I thought we could try something new tonight," Cas frowned, and honestly, he looked so adorable Dean didn't have the heart to complain. So he just sighed, and sat down at the table, much to Cas's obvious delight.
Dean gently slipped the photo back inside the coat, his heart pounding, and for one foolish moment he wondered if Cas had left the coat behind on purpose, just so Dean could see the photo.
“But after all the crap we've been through…” Dean clears his throat, fiddling with their entwined fingers.
“Well- yeah,” Dean stammers, “I mean- if we’re doing this—” he grabs a plate and flips a few pancakes onto it. “—we won’t have much time for full-time hunting. And besides. We deserve it.
“Aw, thanks for the offer, but I should be getting home,” Jody’s voice is apologetic. “Long drive. Hope you enjoy it! Great to see you, Jack and Sam, and super glad to meet you, Charlie! I’ll see you around.”
"Hey, Cas, look."

And that was what hurt the most, because maybe Cas had finally been at peace, but Dean was the one left behind with all the memories of their arguments, all the times he'd
"No, man, not—" Dean huffed, and dragged a hand through his hair. "This isn't about that."
Pressing a hand to Dean’s abdomen, he’d thrust the blade upwards at the surprised entity. It wouldn’t kill the being, but he’d hoped the wound would delay it, and it must have worked, because somehow, he’d brought Dean Winchester into the light. Somehow, Jack had closed the void before the empty could retaliate. Somehow, they had gotten another chance to live.
That was the first time Dean had wondered if angels just didn't
of your other balls have been sunk."
“Hello, Sam!” Jack steps into the bunker, holding a foil-wrapped dish of what smells like homemade apple pie, and Sam is more than happy to let Jack become the center of attention, at least for the moment.
Dean can make out the typewriter words, a few smudges of chili mango juice on one corner of the parchment. “Did you… read it?”
Dean took another breath, shoulders shaking underneath Cas's hands. He listened, but his Dad's voice didn't answer. For once, his mind felt quiet.
"Cas, I don't know if you can hear me."
"Uh—yeah, we're
And of course, his nerdy brother couldn’t simply stop there. About two years back, he started a podcast exclusively for hunters, called ‘
?" Short, and breathy, and oh-so-different from his usually graveled voice, that Dean almost melted from the sound of it. Almost told him everything.
The waiter returned extra quickly with two plates, and set them down—carefully, thank god—in front of the men with a smile. She had given them each a complimentary side of fries.
"—but finally, FINALLY—" Sam jabbed a satisfied finger at the both of them, and Dean was amused to see Cas looking just as confused as he was. "—you're here, and he's here, and I'm here, all in the same damn place and you are going to TALK."
And then Sam heard his father say those words, those vulgar
Whispers echo in Cas’s ear, taunting him to realize his regrets, to think about what these notes mean. That Dean was in love all along, just as much as he had been, and how many years they could have had, if only—but he tries not to listen. This moment, intimate and quiet… he feels suddenly so desperately in love, and it is all at once everything and not enough.

Chris glanced desperately behind him, as if searching for help. No one was there. "Ugh man, just order something."

Sam began massaging his forehead. He could feel another headache coming on. "I already tried setting them up. I really don't want to do that again."
Cas squinted at him suspiciously, but decided to let it go.
"I think we should just forget about it," Dean muttered gruffly, his thoughts still catapulting around upstairs.
But God, Dean doesn't care. More than that— he loves these things. Because they are not ugly and they are not a part to be ignored. They are Cas. And they are his, to look at, and to remember.
Cas shakes his head, lip curling. “Not for years. Eons, maybe. But if you agree, I will go now, and I will go willingly.”
—well.
If you asked me three months ago if I thought about co-writing a whole 90k word fanfic, I would’ve spit on your shoe or something.
Dean's hand lets go, but doesn't leave Cas's skin. The angel feels warm fingers trail up his chest, brushing gently at his neck, then cupping his jaw, and Cas almost sighs, leaning into the comforting touch before he realizes that this is much worse than holding hands.
How many times had the angel saved his life, and how many times had the angel saved him from his own thoughts, simply by granting him reprieve from his own torturous self-hatred? Dean couldn't count.
He raised his eyebrows at Cas, who seemed to be rather conflicted about the choices. "Which one is
easy. He had plenty of weapons after all, and he knew which ones would bring death quickly. A pistol to the head was the best option.
Extra note from Jupiter:
“I know. But I’ve changed too,” Dean says. “And now- now I know that it is so good to worry, Cas-” he laughs at the sudden epiphany of it all. “It’s so damn good to worry because it means you have something worth losing.”
Sam frowned at Cas, obviously as surprised as Dean.
The angel turned to face forward, a small affectionate smile lifting one corner of his mouth. "As I said. Humans need to work on their complimenting skills."
very happy."
The tactic was recommended by Charlie, when she'd discovered his flashback tendencies. Of course, Dean hadn't used the word 'flashbacks.' It sounded too much like something a therapist or a doctor would say.
fucking pissed you, but tell me how to get Cas back.”
Dean finally grins, a full smile that makes Cas’s chest tighten uncomfortably. “That’s right. And then Michael— that son of a bitch is gonna pay.”
Dean whispers the next lyrics into Cas's ear, and they stand there for a moment, rocking slowly to the same song that neither are truly listening to, but both can hear.
Dean took a quiet, rattling breath. It was so early, and yet the
Cas smiles gently, pushing Dean’s wheelchair. “Yes, thank you, Liv, I really appreciate it. See you in a few weeks.”
And then he sees the blood.
"Oh, yeah. That's why it's best to chalk up your stick before each hit. Eventually, it'll just become instinct."
He flinched. Every moment. Every damn moment, poisoned by his own thoughts. Dean felt his contentment seep away, and tried to blot out the stain before it spread. Tried to hold back the onslaught of inescapable truths. Cas was happy right now. He couldn't ruin that. Not again.
tucked inside a single book, hidden inside a library of much thicker, older books.
“No,” Sam smiles softly, as if he knows something Dean has forgotten. “It’s not ‘just sex,’ Dean, and you know it. Can’t you just let me be proud of you without any snarky remarks?”
With that, Dean was left alone, leaning limply against the car, staring at the spot where Cas had stood.
It was him and Sam, the two of them leaning against the side of the Impala, obviously ignorant to the fact that Cas had been taking a photo.
Dean knew for a fact he could count on one hand the number of times he'd seen Cas smile.
But instead of slowing, his chest only heaved faster in thick, dry gasps, like a man suffocating to death. Slowly, tipping his head back, he slid down the doorframe until he was sitting on the bathroom floor, hands dangling between his knees.
Sam frowned. "the—plan? I thought this was the plan."
He didn't see the fallen angel gasp in agonizing grief, still sitting in the locked car, gripping his face with shaking hands. He didn't see the way Cas curled into himself, and he couldn't hear the strangled breathing, the hitching almost-sobs.
Cas was just the one who had woken him up.
But it felt
of material to get through. Charlie's list was long, and most of her notes took place in the later books. Still, Sam couldn't help feeling curious. He'd been watching Cas and Dean's staring contests for as long as he could remember, but he hadn't been around for their very first meeting.
Are you going to… tell anyone?"
"And…" Dean hated the quaking breaks in his voice, the way his heart wouldn't stop trying to burst through his ribcage. But he loved it all the same, because it meant
“I’m here.”
No one was paying them any attention whatsoever, whether from lack of sobriety or simple disinterest, but Dean couldn't help feeling slightly self-conscious standing with Cas around the abandoned pool table.
He’s interrupted by the rather loud sounds of Dean choking on his coffee.
Sam rolls his eyes. “She’s your
Castiel felt Dean's agony, and like a magnet being pulled towards a single source, Cas walked out of the room, and rapped heavily on the Impala's windowpane.
“Um—” but Dean is interrupted by Cas shoving a paper note in his lap.
Taylor came back with his credit card and an all-too-flirtatious smile. "So? How about it?" The dark eye-liner just under each eye made their ocean-gray color rather hard to ignore.
What are you to do then?
Sam had laughed at that, and Dean mimed a pair of scissors. "Seriously though. Your hair's getting pretty long, dude. Better hope whoever she is likes long hair cause otherwise she might just cut it off while you sleep."
"I would, huh," Dean teased.
"You know I was only joking right? About you and me, ya know, I didn't mean—"
"Yeah. So. A guardian angel—" Dean holds up a finger. "No, an
Dean strums the final chord, and waits for the next song to start up. There's no knowing what it will be. There's also no knowing when it will begin.
Silence. Sam fidgets awkwardly in the background, coughing into his hand. As usual, Cas and Dean ignore him.
And when his life seemed especially pointless, when Dean could barely look at him from anger, when Dean smiled at him, and Cas couldn't even enjoy the moment of peace for fear of death, he would make lists in his head, counting all the ways he'd come to love Dean Winchester.
sitting next to him on the same bed, dark lashes lowered shyly, fidgeting with the corner of his sweatpants.
“Sweetheart, you know they’re not getting here until two, and the guests leave at noon,” Cas presses a kiss to his husband’s temple.
Gentle hands twist the ring onto Dean’s finger, and he feels the dull hum of the Cas’s grace pulse through his hand. His heart swells just looking at it.
You know something is wrong when it feels too easy.
in the arms— that’s a lot.”
"Uh.." Such an innocent question. Such a difficult answer.
Dean almost walked away, then—
Dean was digging loudly through his duffel bag, spreading out an assortment of pamphlets, newspaper clippings, weapons and half-opened snacks across the mattress.
like the main character of a damn rom-com, and you're telling me you already knew??"
As the phone dials, Dean feels a sense of foreboding. That dream
The best friend he loves more than anything, the savior who raised him from perdition, the angel who sacrificed everything for him, the secret lover who thought his love would never be matched: this cornflower-eyed, wild haired human stands before him, this awkward, wise, dorky, ancient weirdo stands here with the audacity to
This. This, right here.
, no goodbye, no
lingering in the expression.

“Well, you asked! Why ask if you’re only prepared for one answer?” Dean complains loudly as he follows the dark-haired man down the slightly creaky steps into a sunlit dining room.
get their heads out of their asses and admitted their feelings, their future make-up sex was going to be destructive.
(—Nice timing Cas——can I tell you something if you promise not to tell another soul?——we're making it up as we go——I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition——I'll watch over you——I was getting too close to the humans in my charge——just so you understand… why I can't help——well last night on earth, what are your plans—)
“Because, because I’m lonely, and he was kind…”
Despite Castiel’s half-hearted protests, Dean insisted on paying the check. Thoughtfully, Castiel followed him out onto the icy pavement, and along the block to the blood donation clinic. Dean couldn’t have been more than a few years older than Sam, but he’d taken care of him, for years apparently, and hadn’t abandoned his responsibilities when Ellen and Bobby came on the scene.
Gabriel’s mouth dropped open, a lone candy cane dropping to the floor of the ticket booth.
“Dean!” Bobby cast an anxious look at Ellen, who had just returned from the kitchen, and Dean relented, a faint stirring of guilt in his gut as he saw Ellen’s face.
“Bites,” says Dean. And chugs the rest of the champagne.
Thanks to Charlie’s ingenuity, he’d managed to avoid any more awkward questions, though Pamela had been seeking him out for a gossip, he was sure, and Jo still side-eyed him from time to time. Thankfully the eggnog had gotten to her in the end, and she'd swayed upstairs bemoaning the fact that Dean hadn’t made it home. He was beginning to wonder whether there had ever been anything between her and this Dean, of it was merely a teenage crush.
“Shocked?”
Castiel stared at him. Balthazar was odd and probably had some kind of sexual addiction, but even for him, this didn’t make sense.
“I don’t think that’s how it goes.”
Did they really have to do this today, of all the days?
“Sam’s old friend from Stanford? He was here the day after the accident too,” Castiel confirmed, getting to his feet, ready to escape to the bathrooms if Jess started reading out Sam’s personal information. “He brought Sam’s effects over from the office.”
Balthazar lurched towards his pocket, the flush spreading deep into his v-neck.
is beautiful?”
“So so, my dad was a headmaster in a religious college, and my mom was a nurse. They didn’t have the money to pay for my in-patient treatment and I was too old for insurance. They had to remortgage. I’m reimbursing them. Not that they asked, but they’ll need it when they’re older.”
Fortunately it was the end of the day and the ticket booth was closed. All that was left for them to do was count up and pull down the shutters.
Castiel shivered.
Hoping that no suitable garage sites had become available in the few days he’d been away, he hurried down to the parking lot, and checked, as always, that Baby was unharmed. Making a mental note to himself to clean her properly the next day and wash all the road salt from her undercarriage, he pulled out his phone and demanded Castiel’s address from Ellen.
Having decided that, he shoved his hands into his pockets, and turned, reluctantly, away.
“Thank you,” he whispered, averting his gaze, as Ellen tucked a piece of paper into his fingers. “I—I’ll be there.”
Throughout the starter, there was an quiet unease in the room. It was awkward, with Jo casting him strange glances over Ellen’s Christmas centrepiece, and even Bobby’s grizzled face was contemplative, as he chewed his crackers and pate in silence. Charlie had turned the conversation to Sam’s recovery, but Dean didn’t miss the way her gaze switched thoughtfully between him and Castiel.
“You need rest, Ellen. You can’t take risks.” Charlie attempted a reassuring smile. “And Sam would kill me if he woke up to find you’d made your heart worse. Dean too.”
His father mimes a wine glass. “We started early, celebrating the end of your project, you know how worried we’ve been. But you look well, son. Happy. Is this new—”
Still wearing her fingerless gloves, Charlie wrapped her fingers around her mug, dipping her head and sighing as the steam rose into her face.
He gestured to Mrs Mancini's apartment below.
“Don’t worry. I was just popping in on my way to Sam’s, I need to feed the cat.”
It was probably the blood loss. Stood to reason anything that could make a man faint was gonna addle his brains a bit too.
“I didn’t know Sam had a cat.” Although Pamela couldn’t actually see him, her gaze was strangely assessing.
look good when the truth came out, but he’d also have to insure and tax it, and he just didn’t have the cash.
But then, Castiel wondered as he looked round at them, trying to force down the panic that was making his breath come quickly, what was the cat food for? There was only one obvious answer here—unless Sam volunteered at the Cat’s Home, and somehow he didn’t seem the type—so he doubled down. A family who didn’t know about the first, the
Castiel limped after her. “Are you sure I need an x-ray? That paramedic said it was probably just a bruise.”
“Is that any of your business?”
“That’s very impressive.” Castiel leaned forward to peer inside. “From a wreck? It looks like it just came off the production line, what, back in the late 60s?”
Her lips quirked mischievously, and suddenly he knew he wasn't going to get away with it that easily. “Yeah. They all had brown eyes, except…”
At least a month sounded perfect.
What are they going to do with the pies?
“You got a key?”
“Er…” Jo glanced at her mother. “I was asking what they were doing out here. It’s cold. They could catch a chill, and then they wouldn’t be able to go visit Sam.”
“Well this handsome chap’s never lonely,” announce a fresh voice, and they turned round as Jess swiped the chart from the end of Sam’s bed and flipped up the pages. “He’s had lots of visitors this morning. Ellen came around breakfast time, and then we had that English man again, the short one, with the beard.”
“Fluffy,” Castiel corrected as he wriggled out, doing his best not to strain his knee. He hoped it didn’t have a name tag, but it was unlikely, wasn’t it? A cat in a
“Bedbugs?” suggests Cas, his voice higher than usual, almost Jimmy-pitch, with suppressed mirth.
“Keep whisking, Cas!” Mrs Novak nudges him back towards the stove.
he’s got a fiance. She introduced us to him!”
“Hey, Castiel! I’ve been calling you.”
could tell—and aside from the bidding hub cap and the right wing mirror, she seemed perfect.
“He’s okay, really,” he told Gypsum, and she purred around his legs.
Jo’s jaw dropped. “I’m not
“My meds, Jo,” Ellen shoved her handbag towards her daughter.
“It was only the truth,” Castiel said, folding his arms and leaning against the kitchen counter. “And the longer we trick them, the worse it’s going to be when they find out. Dean and I got quite friendly last night, I’d hate to—I mean, when this comes out, I don’t want him to feel betrayed, or, or stupid for not having followed his instincts.” He shook his head. “I don’t think he’ll ever forgive me.”
He made sure all the doors were securely locked, and then stood on the sidewalk to take stock.
“Is that any way to greet your landlord?” Balthazar pushed past, leering as he scanned Castiel up and down. “Nice boxers!”
“Well, got to say, ramming Dean’s Baby into the wall isn’t exactly the best move.”
“Yep, and that’s about the best that can be said for it.” Dean shook his head. “What I mean, is, you don’t look like a pimp, man.”
-----
The sandy-hair guy nodded.
And he’s obviously forgotten all about… last night.
Flushing, and with a quick glance at Castiel, Dean returned to the reception desk. Castiel returned his gaze to his phone, where he typed a brief apology to Mrs Mancini’s earlier message, and promised to replace any washing Gypsum might have ruined—though how he was going to afford that, he didn’t know. Going by the last bill, Mrs Mancini had surprisingly expensive tastes in lingerie.
He really should have prepared for this, especially after Dean’s warning.
“Dean! Honestly, how do you ever expect to bring home a nice girl, with manners like that?”
“Balthazar, huh?” Dean’s gaze was suddenly alert. “Your landlord.”
He exchanges a look with his son, and a flustered-looking Cas smiles back. It’s kinda sappy, but it warms Dean, seeing Cas so loved.
“Looking for adventure?” Castiel asked, with added finger quotes.
? His heart was racing, his skin tingling.
A woman screamed on the platform, and a train’s horn blared, close—too close—as the rails vibrated under his feet. Castiel glanced up; strangely distant. It suddenly felt like he was floating, high above the scene, trapped in unreality, as time slowed and warped.
would be on Christmas Day. “Why would she care?”
“This your favourite?” he asked the cat, feeling he should probably make polite conversation.
What the hell was Balthazar doing with those? Not of course that it was his place to comment. Everyone had a right to express themselves. Just not in his closet.
Castiel stepped forward.
Relieved, Castiel stretched out his leg, stifling a curse as the pain shot through his knee. He reached down to massage the joint.
“I’m…uh. Sorry to bother you, Ma’am, but I’ve hurt my leg and I need a tow. My phone’s dead so I need to borrow a phone please.” He shoves his cell at her. Evidence, or something, that the rough looking stranger aint about to rob the house.
“What….” He said finally, and reluctantly, “Do you mean, ‘silky’?”
“Your hobbies are
Castiel smiled as he poured the boiling water into the mugs, sharing one teabag between both cups. “He’s extremely good-looking, even more so than Sam. But I have to say, I was more impressed by how he takes such responsibility for his family. He really seems to feel it’s his job to protect them all from harm.” He picked up the mugs and carried them to the little stained coffee table he’d picked up off the sidewalk, shortly after he moved in. “And that’s why we have to tell him the truth. This is a massive betrayal of his—or
Cas slumped a little in his seat. “No… I—it all happened so fast.”
“Not sayin’ you won’t need to pop round the garage with the occasional apple pie and beer, of course, for the emotional distress…”
He flung open the door, expecting an irate Italian lady.
?” She ended on a dubious note.
“What do you
“Our Grandmother.”
“It must have been an exciting place for two small boys,” Castiel said, leaning on the open door and avoiding putting too much weight on his bad knee, as Dean came round to lock up his side, trapping him between the car and door. “The only thing that surprises me is that you didn’t
“Yes but who should ask who in this case, Rufus?”
He opened the bag, expecting to find some curled up sandwiches.
A little breathless, Cas subsides into his seat, still with the death grip on the pie.
cook. Ellen, you should take Cas in, show him the pie.”
“Even if it’d make you happy?”
Castiel offered him a small smile, used to comforting other people for the death of his own father. “It’s okay. No… It’s, I mean, it probably sounds a little strange, but we never went, though I think my dad always hoped we would one day. It was just something we did for fun, to keep us entertained through the winter.” He shrugged, a little self-conscious from the considering look Dean was giving him. “I told you it was odd.”
And Dean looked… Dean looked angry, his brows drawn down in a frown, his jaw rigid. Perhaps he wasn’t as okay with all this as the others had led him to believe.
“Sam drives a Prius, what do you drive, Castiel?”
“You’d still teach me to drive, after I did
“It seemed appropriate.”
As they entered the ER, a pretty young woman in nurse’s scrubs appeared, brushing her blond ringlets from her face.
“Yeah. No trouble there.” Dean ran his fingers through his hair, making it stand on end. “And Cas is a darn sight better than his predecessor, let me tell you.”
“Sir! You have to wake up.” He shook him a little, hoping to rouse him.
Castiel regarded him in silence. “You won’t know unless you ask him. If it’s a side business, you wouldn’t need to paint out any names. You could cost it up, see whether you’d make better margins through restoration or repair work.”
She trailed off, blinking rapidly, and suddenly cold, Castiel dropped down beside her, and took her hands in his.
Following him, Castiel changed the subject. Perhaps Dean was upset at the thought of Sam having a child, when he clearly missed Ben. “So you’re saying this car’s more family friendly?”
something. Apparently
“Er, thank you.” Castiel glanced at the blood donation bag, which seemed pretty full. “How much longer will it take?”
Jesus, he couldn’t even come out properly.
“Dean,” breaks in Dean, before Cas can spin some nutjob story. Cos damn that boy’s got imagination. “I’m a student at Cas’s college.” He thrust his leg through the doorway, into the light. “I got driven off the road by some idjut.”
out of the door and leaned against the doorjamb, looking him over with heavy-lidded eyes.
Castiel’s panicked gaze met his.
Dean nodded, his ear tips a little pink, either from cold, or embarrassment, Castiel wasn’t sure. It was strange how Dean seemed to be looking to him for approval, and it warmed him in a manner he wasn’t entirely sure it should. If Dean wanted his approval, was that because of
“I should hope so.” Then she turned back to the hallway. “Jo, bring in the pie, everyone’s ready.”
Dean nodded. “At the ticket-booth, huh? I can give you a lift in my truck if you like. The sidewalk’s an ice rink out there and it’s freezing.”
“Interrogate Castiel about what?” Jo asked, passing a glass of eggnog up the table.
, too.
“Let’s go down to the canteen and grab a drink, while the doc’s in there with Sam. It sounds like you’ve a lot to tell me…”
“They were so silky!” Balthazar protested. “I was
“Thank you?”
“You had it all planned out, huh?”
an apple pie in the oven. Normally we have to put the child lock on, just to stop you burning your fingers!”
“Well I was gonna say Donald Trump, but I guessed you wouldn’t take it as a compliment.” Dean got to his feet. “So, whaddya think then?”
“I was…” Dean ’s eyes were hard. “I was lookin’ for Sam’s stuff, figured he’d be needing a shave when he wakes up.”
The man frowned, his strong eyebrows drawing together, as he scooped up the change, his expensive watch glinting in the winter sun, and headed for the stairs. Castiel didn’t know much about watches, but even he knew what a Rolex was, and something about the man’s attire and attitude told him it wasn’t likely to be a fake.
He could use a hand, not a lift—he’s not abandoning Baby in this weather—but the road is empty.
“Oh, thanks. I’ll, yes, I’ll take care of it.” He pointed towards the bus station. “I’ve um, I’ve got to head home now. It was nice to meet you.”
“Hello gentlemen. Can I call you that?” A cheery voice, Minnesota to its core, sounded above them. “You look like gentlemen to me. Come this way, boys, just a little blood test to do first.”
“You don’t know what you’re doing to me, Cassie. I have
to see you all!”
Castiel shook his head. “I’ve still got most of my stuff at home.”
“They should put that on their flyers,” Castiel suggested, winning a flash of green eyes and a grin that made him sit up just a little bit straighter.
He tamped down the flickering of hope in his chest. “Really—but, that’s not the point. I’d be going under false pretences.”
Jo snorted. “I wasn’t sure at first… He doesn’t seem like Sam’s usual type—besides the obvious of course—but I think he’s growing on me. Mom
might say. Sighing, he hauled himself from bed, shuffling across the floor as he pushed his hair from his eyes.
Not only had he accidentally wormed his way inside Sam Winchester’s family, causing no end of confusion, but now he was ousting another fiancee, with an extra ‘e’ this time.
“Oh come on, Dean! Hasn’t he told you enough?” Bobby slapped the car magazine against his thigh.
“What you tryin’ to say?”
“Oh,” he faltered. “I’m just Castiel. Not a doctor, or any kind of medic.” He suspected Jess wasn’t really supposed to let him in. “I’ll, um, I was just—”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “Seriously, dude? Yeah. If you want. The driving lessons that is. Reckon the adventure will be Sam’s job.”
It was another hour before he was given the all-clear, and he thanked the nurse, who had been chatting away non-stop, obviously trying to keep his mind off what had happened.
“Fluffy’s all fed. I’ll come back tomorrow with more food.”
“These aren’t yours, then?” Dean opened the cupboard door wide, and stepped back.
haven’t been there,” Castiel said, keeping his distance from the panties. “Those aren’t mine, Balthazar.”
“Oh Castiel, those are lovely!” Ellen was sitting by the bed, Sam’s pale, lifeless hand held in her own. Beside her, Jo scowled.
Castiel put him out of his misery. “Jimmy,” he said heavily. “He was the clever one, the one who could do the numbers. Jimmy was warm, and funny; he knew how to talk to people. I was always better at English and history but I was quiet and awkward.”
He sighed suddenly.
He stared at the catnip toy and a very familiar package with dismay. Three sachets of Top Cat fish soup. It was Gypsum’s favourite, but he could only afford to buy it for her adoption day dinner.
“Castiel?”
seemed to spring back to life, attempting to herd them all towards the house. “Just a minor prang, it can all be fixed.”
Balthazar was looking a little green. “Well, not used, as such, but, yes, well, I was certainly finding them inspirational.” He moaned a little. “You don’t happen to have one of those yellow hazardous waste bins?”
“That’s enough, you eejit. What d’yer think Sam’s gonna say when he wakes up and hears you’ve been crossing words with his fiance?” Bobby put a word in.
“Dated. I definitely said dated.”
Castiel walked past the Singer household for the third time that night. He was trying not to stare too obviously, but no one seemed to be looking out for him. Had they
Regarding the panties with frank loathing, Balthazar gingerly held them out. “Mrs Mancini’s
“Sorry. He’s at work.”
“I bet he gets to travel all over the world on his fancy legal cases.” He sighed again. “I’d love to travel.”
“Well, not immediately. But yeah, from about eight or so, I used to do little jobs, things people’d pay a few bucks for, here and there, shovelling ice, sweeping yards, even passing messages between the local big guys. Probably more like drugs than messages, but I didn’t realise it at the time. Later on I hustled pool, worked behind the bar in dives, that kinda thing.”
It was… interesting.
“I used to be able to see into the future, you know,” Missouri turned sadly to Cas. “But now they say I can’t even see into the past.”
She curved her little finger to a banana shape, then nodded towards his crotch.
“She’s a cute little thing,” Dean said, leaning forward and chucking her under the chin. “How does she get on with the hairless monstrosity at Sam’s?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“And the longer I lie, the worse it will be!”
“The flats allow for a high degree of customisation.” That’s what the brochure online had said. “Well, here we are. Home sweet home.” He stepped forward, feeling with his hand for the light switch. The room was dark and smelled fusty and unused. Wouldn’t Sam have a cleaner?
And he should probably be more concerned about that than he actually was.
“Oh no,” Castiel blurted, scooting his chair back with a screech. “I’m not very good at these sorts of things.” He flushed under Dean’s bewildered gaze. “I can help with anything else though, tidying up the room or something.”
“What are you boys doing? It’s freezing out there!”
He arrived on the platform, gasping for breath, and the crowd parted a little, showing him the way through to the altercation. The lawyer seemed to be holding his own—he was, after all, at least six foot three—but no one was stepping in to help him.
You can’t go round wolf-whistling at men, that’s harassment!”
But no, he’d messed that up too. They would just think he was a lunatic now. They might even think
“Yeah… I guess so.” There was a clap of hands. “It’s all right for Sam then, huh. Ditches his druggy fiancee, finds a ho– finds himself a new fiance, gets his life saved. If he wasn’t lying’ in that hospital bed, I’d be jealous.”
What on earth was he supposed to say?
“So you, er mentioned a car…?”
Well,
“It’s in beautiful condition!” Castiel exclaimed, admiring its glossy black paintwork from afar.
He was ignoring the little voice telling him that apparently they already knew. Jo had just been the one to point it out.
Somehow he got the door open, and bested, Balthazar stepped back with a groan.
Dean pulled up the handbrake. “You gonna be ok going in?”
Castiel tilted his head, considering. “Beer won’t mix well with some meds I’m on. Maybe a soda?”
Three shadowy figures surrounded a much taller figure, one in a billowing coat. As Castiel watched, his chest thumping, one of the smaller figures went to grab at his bag.
He shuts the door softly, not wanting to call attention to the car, and crosses round the front to let Cas out. Snow is fluttering, ever heavier, and with no chains he’d better get back to the garage before he gets stuck.
at him.
The journey to the General was short. Before the paramedic could reply, they had pulled up in the emergency bay, and the EMTs were jumping out.
What kinda name’s that? No. Sam didn’t tell me anything. I thought, well... I guess I never thought I’d see
“You are staying here,” Castiel informed him, pulling him towards the hall cupboard.
Talk about awkward. He was going to
“How are we going to tell them?” Castiel asked, his heart already sinking at the thought. “I don’t want to make Ellen ill with shock.”
He dragged on his hat and drew on his gloves, before turning.
Castiel crossed his arms. “He really, really isn’t.
His hands a little jittery, he went to fill and turn on the kettle, hoping all the while that Balthazar would keep quiet. At least Charlie would know he wasn’t cheating on Sam, but in Castiel’s experience Balthazar rarely left a situation without making it somehow worse.
“Well nothing’s—”
“It’s okay, Missouri,” Dean threw his arm around her shoulders, still strong for all that her mind had weakened. “We love you.”
So much for that idea.
how little money he had.
“Retired,” Dean said, firmly. “Maybe… maybe you saw us just as friends,” he tried, forcing himself to keep his face blank. Missouri would know, wouldn’t she, if something like that was going to happen? “Cas and I get on very well. That’s probably what you saw.”
, welcome!”
“Got your own man now too.” He glanced over at the bed. “And I gotta tell you, Sammy. That was some shock. Not,” he added, in case Sam could actually hear everything he was saying, “That it’s a problem. Just… not what I expected, I guess.”
“Oh,” said Castiel, as understanding began to dawn. “Well…” he temporised, still not one hundred percent sure what he was being asked. “I love her.”
Dean sent him a look of betrayal, as Cas turned to him with raised eyebrows.
“Space on the drive,” Dean announced, pulling the Impala into a wide turn and up the slight incline of the paved driveway, accompanied by a strange scraping noise. “Charlie’s probably still stuck at the hospital. At least,” he muttered, as he turned off the ignition, “That’s one less person in the peanut gallery.”
Ellen shook her head, as Castiel’s gaze flickered to meet his.
“Watch your mouth!” came an older voice from the doorstep.
“Photography. Another expensive hobby.” Castiel glanced at the Chevrolet, and then over to Dean’s black Impala. “You know, I’d love to take some pictures, you could use them on your website when you set up your restoration business.”
“I’m sure if Castiel needed to, he could tell me somethin’ only someone who knew Sam
“Hey, don’t look at me!” Jo shook her head.
“Why what?”
Cas’s mother, taking the rebuke, fires her next salvo with a smile.
“I promise you,” Castiel said, doing the Scouts’ promise, before undoing his seatbelt. “That I will manage to stagger the twenty feet to my door without passing out.”
Suddenly, the answer came to him.
“It’s good of you to come down,” she said, handing them two clipboard with forms and pens attached. “Most people’s blood is 90% eggnog at the moment, so we’re running short. Here you go, fill those in and bring ‘em back for me to check.”
Dean glanced over at him. “You don’t wanna hear this, it’s just family crap, not important.”
“Dammit.”
That was about the best he could hope for, given Gypsum seemed unlikely to make a confession.
“And Bobby won’t let you start up a side business?”
“You’d better come in,” Ellen gasped from her chair, her lips were a bluish-grey colour. “What did you say your name was?”
No one but Cas, he realised, with a sudden sickening lurch, deep in his stomach.
. He had sandy brown hair, green eyes and a stubbled jaw. Admittedly, he looked like he hadn’t slept in days, but he was still the most handsome man Castiel had ever set eyes on, with upturned lips and a smattering of freckles across his cheeks.
But it wasn’t Balthazar. Or Mrs Mancini.
All of a sudden, he could see another reason for Dean’s instant dislike of him.
“Well,” Dean said dubiously, with one last, lingering look of horror at the skeletal hellcat rubbing itself against Castiel’s shin. “Come along then, Alanis Morisette, show me Sam’s pad.”
“Yeah.” Dean stepped back alongside him to join in the admiration. He shoved his hands in his pockets. “I restored her myself from a wreck.”
was the car they wanted him to take? It looked like something from a Bond film, and he dreaded to think how much it was worth.
On the other hand, it frees up Cas’s hands to do what Cas’s hands do even better than his voice…
“I just might. It’s been weird, everything I feared, have worried about for years, and Sam goes and does it first—and in what a way.” Dean shook his head. “I’m almost bitter about it.”
“Pass Dean’s young man the gravy,” Missouri chided, as Jo helped herself. “He needs feeding up, Garth too, a skinny boy like that.”
Before him, on the upturned laundry basket, was Balthazar, his phone in one hand, the other in his lap. He had jumped at Castiel’s entrance, his face flushed and eyes dazed, before he hastily tucked his other hand out of sight.
“Sam doesn’t have a cat!”
He assumed Balthazar had been hoping to sneak them out and take them home. He didn’t want to think about what would have happened next.
Dean shook his head. “I never told Bobby and Ellen, didn’t really know how they’d react.”
“You’ve got to check the oil?” Jo sounded dubious, and Castiel paused. “Dean, you never leave your house without checking the oil. You’re like,
“I think you just promised you wouldn’t say anything to anyone else, actually.” Dean rolled his shoulders, the fabric of his T-shirt stretching over his muscles.
“Yeah, well. Sam’s pretty loaded, so reckon you’ll be flying first class, not that that makes it any better. But you’ll get to travel, man.”
“That’s no bad thing, Bobby.” Ellen pulled her cardigan further around herself, shivering in the draught that came in from the hall. “She could do anything, with money behind her, even be a corporate lawyer like Sam.”
“You can stay with me for the blood donation, and then I’ll drop you home. No arguments.”
Balthazar gave him an indulgent smile, his earlier embarrassment apparently forgotten. “It’s all right, Cassie, it’s 2020. There’s nothing wrong with experimenting with gender expression. We’ve all been there.”
“It’s Sam’s fiance!”
He held out his arm, and at her nod, he swung the dining room door open, and ushered her through.
when Sam came round—which he would, he
“He was injured?” Dean paused on his way to the door.
“I know Sam would do anything to belong. Hey!”
Dean covered his sudden agitation by snatching the basket of rolls, which Ellen had been protecting from a hungry Bobby, and shoving them under Castiel’s nose. “Here, Cas, try some of Ellen’s bread, she made it fresh this morning.”
Gypsum didn’t agree, or perhaps she was just hungry, for she was sniffing around the cardboard box of Sam’s effects that he’d left by the door the previous night.
“I didn’t know we had an employee of the month.” Castiel bit into his own hotdog, and whilst it was probably pretty unhealthy, the heat and spice were welcome on such a chilly day.
“It feels weird having a knob in my hand.”
He definitely didn’t have boobs, and that was something Sam was usually pretty keen on. That Ruby bitch had been going for a boob job and Sam was gonna
It was a good-sized house in an up and coming suburb. Smaller than his grandparents’ house had been, but a lot more welcoming, with the sparkling Christmas lights, and a carefully tended lawn at the front. In the driveway was parked a large van, with ‘Singer and Son Salvage’ marked on the side.
“Sam Winchester is my exception.”
Castiel slammed the door closed, and leaned against it, groaning as a motorbike roared outside, probably one of Balthazar’s new ‘toys’. Perhaps he’d decided to escape into the night before Mrs Mancini got wind of his interest in her underwear.
Left alone on the street, Dean rubbed his hand through his hair as he weighed up his options. That pretty nurse had said Castiel liked to hang out at the hospital after work. He checked his phone and came to a decision: Head home to Logan Square, have a nap, and then aim to be at the hospital early that evening.
“Well if it isn’t Castiel!” He leaned in as Castiel reached the landing, leering, his strong aftershave making Castiel’s nose twitch. “So, hey, Doc, I’ve got this burning sensation in my nipples. Would you like to take a look?”
Sometimes it was difficult to remember she was no longer the tough, no-nonsense Ellen they’d grown up with.
try something on with Jo. She’s—she’s practically a kid. And I don’t go for kids. Or, women much, these days.”
But Dean’s gaze was not on his trunks. He stared, his tongue darting out to wet his lips.
“Don’t need blood to make family,” said the man in the sweater. “Sam Winchester don’t have no blood family, ‘cept Dean, and he aint here. But we’re family all the same.”
Long cozy evenings by the single bar electric fire, travelling, if only in their minds, as they listed all the towns they would visit.
Biting his lip, Castiel glanced back at Dean, who was shuffling his feet.
“Oh my, you’ll be our holy guest! We always leave a spare setting at the table on Christmas Eve.” Mrs Novak explains to Dean, as she holds out her glass for a refill Dean suspects is more than her first. “It’s an old Polish tradition. ‘A guest at home is God at home’. We’ve never had a holy guest before.”
She eyed him narrowly. “Yeah, well, let’s check that out anyway, huh, I don’t want you passing out on me. Now, Dean Winchester I’m takin’ it. What about you?” She turned to Dean’s sheet and ran her finger down the page.
“She’s over-age,” Bobby put in. “But she shouldn’t have told them that.”
“Oh.” Castiel shoved his hands into his coat pocket and forlornly surveyed the damage.
Swallowing, he turned to inspect the door handles, unable to meet Dean’s gaze.
It had been some years since he’d driven but he was fairly sure that was ‘up’.
“Honestly, I’m fine. Just need to borrow a phone, or…” he pauses. He probably looks rough, with all the blood, and his torn jeans. “Actually, I don’t even need to touch your phone, if you could call this number for me my friend'll...”
“Champagne anyone?” Cas’s dad reappears, a bottle of some fancy-looking champagne, Angel something, held aloft. “You too, Dean, it doesn’t sound like you’ll be driving anywhere tonight, and any friend of Cas’s is a friend of ours, especially at Christmas.”
“Dean. It’s incredible! You wouldn’t believe it was the same car.” He glanced at the car, longing to run his hands over the paintwork, but not quite daring to. “Does she… work? I mean, is she drivable?”
His mom wipes her hands on a dish towel. “Whoever can that be at this hour, on Christmas eve too?”
“I agree,” said the paramedic. “And as you’re only walking wounded, you can sit on the seat in the back with me and him.” He pointed over his shoulder to the ambulance, where the injured lawyer lay with another EMT leaning over him. “But we need to go
“Audrey Hepburn was a brunet,” said Bobby, deciding
“Oh!” Missouri gasped and put her hand to her mouth. “And so I’m finally getting to meet Dean’s young man!” She peered at Castiel, her gaze approving, then she looked up at Dean, standing by his shoulder. “He’s just as handsome as I remembered.”
“Car this age, lucky to have ‘em at all.” Dean leant over him, smelling faintly of oil and leather, to point out the fittings. “We retrofitted them. It kinda wrecks the interior, and it’s not always possible, but Sam’s paranoid about the legal cases if someone got thrown through the window on one of our cars so we usually fit ‘em unless someone asks us not to.”
After lunch, they retreated to the lounge, where Charlie and Jo topped up everyone’s eggnog—all except Bobby, who was guarding his whisky from any attempt to get him in the Christmas spirit. Dean was trying to avoid the chattering group at the fireplace, but he didn’t want to find himself tete-a-tete with Cas on the couch either, not with the way the lunch conversation had gone down.
Castiel dropped his head to his hands. He knew he was pathetic, but he was being offered something he hadn’t had for a very long time.
“What’s the problem? Can’t they cope with her?” He couldn’t see what Jo’s college had to do with needling him non-stop.
“Merry Christmas!”
Bobby sighed. “Will ya stop with the wisecracks, and listen?”
“I’ve seen worse.” Dean shook his head. “Well, let’s head over to Ellen’s and we can take a proper look over there where there’s decent light. I’ll take her to the yard tomorrow and start work straight away.”
“A house-fire?” He opened his eyes.
He landed heavily, wincing as pain shot through his knee, but he bent down to tug at the lapels of the lawyer’s coat.
As he unblocked Baby, he shook his head.
“Let me think about this. I’m not so sure whether… Ellen Harvelle is very unwell. This is gonna be tricky. The slightest shock could cause her heart to fail.”
“I’ll be fine,” Castiel protested, thinking of his empty pocket-book. “I’ll eat when I get home.”
“Mine?” Balthazar dangled the panties between them with a leer that was probably supposed to be seductive. “I thought they were yours!”
Castiel swallowed. Aside from the—still putative—cat, he knew very little about Sam. Where he worked, certainly, a little about his education, but they’d all know he could find that out easily enough on-line. What did he know that only someone who had been, well,
“Found him a car. Offered him A Chevrolet Camaro but Castiel here went for the Pimpmobile. So, uh, sorry about that.”
But Castiel didn’t stay to hear what he wasn’t supposed to do. He ran, as quickly as he could, down the concrete steps, pushing grumbling and delayed passengers out of his path and ignoring the barrage of irate questions about the delayed service.
“It’s my pleasure. And I mean that.” Dean scrubbed his hand through his hair. “Look Cas, I’m sorry ‘bout what happened in Sam’s room earlier. I shouldn’t have accused you like that.”
“You don’t like flying?”
Her carer raised a questioning eyebrow, and Dean shook his head as they entered the hallway. Maybe it wasn’t one of her good days, after all.
“You got a bad leg?”
The glance Dean spared him, as he turned into the underground parking lot, was wondering.
Moving quietly, he gathered up the gifts he’d been surprised with the previous night. A new hat and glove set from Ellen, a bottle of whisky from Bobby, a framed photo of Sam from Jo. He’d almost cried when he saw the hastily-made stocking hanging next to all the others on the fireplace, his name, ‘Castiel’ tacked onto the fabric with broad stitches.
Dean suspected he'd be subjected to an interrogation later, but thankfully she seemed content to change the subject.
“I’m making you uncomfortable.” Cas cuts across his thoughts. “It doesn’t matter, I’ll tell them I met a new friend through work. They might wonder, but they won’t push it.”
“Cas, come quickly!”
“Who was it for?”
“With slippers like that, I’m not so sure,” he said, eyeing her feet with distaste, and happy to spar as much as possible if took her mind off Baby.
“Castiel was driving Baby,” put in Ellen. “Apparently Dean here was tryin’ to teach the boy to drive a manual, and Castiel drove Baby into the side of the parking lot.”
He broke off as Castiel eyed him curiously.
The entire family turned to stare.
Castiel nodded, his face still troubled, and Dean hit the stereo button before he could put his foot in his mouth yet again.
With scissors, he sliced through the brown tape holding the lid together, and peered inside while Gypsum stood up on her hindlegs, the better for looking inside.
“It’s not a problem with you, or Cas, or you liking men,” Ellen said, anxiously. “It’s more… well those other girls, Dean. You should see them, they dress different from us, they talk different from us. Jo just don’t fit in. I think she tried at first, and realised it wasn’t going to work—”
“I owe him a lot,” Dean said, gazing up at his old home, his smile fond. “And that’s why it’s difficult to turn him down when he wants to retire and leave me the garage. He was married once, but she died of cancer. Sam and me’s the nearest thing to family he had, until he married Ellen, and that was only a few years ago. And he doesn’t have any kids of his own.”
There was a gasp from the woman who’d said she was practically a mother to Sam, as she made directly for the bed.
“Wait a minute! Can I even give blood? I wasn’t allowed, before, with my dad…”
Clearly Sam just had the sense to know a good thing when he saw it.
“It was a crush, Dean. A full-scale teenage crush.”
“Yeah.” Dean chuckled as Gypsum rolled over and butted her head against his thigh. “Guess she does. I’ve never had a cat, but I can kinda see the appeal. As long as they’ve got fur…”
"Hello Dean."
Dean felt heat prickling at the corners of his eyes, imagining the look that would reside on Cas's face for who-knew-how-long. A look of pity, guilt, for not being able to return Dean's words in the way Dean wished to hear them.
It was more the fact that Cas had done it solely to please Dean. Trying on the boots would not save the world. It would not solve a case, or rescue a victim. It was nothing but an embarrassing joke, and yet, Dean had asked. And Cas had done it.
Jack’s face lights up. “Yeah! Can we watch
----------------------------------
Cas has always been so open about these things, and sometimes, Dean wishes he wouldn't be, because it makes him realize just how many walls are still standing in his own mind, and how much effort it takes just to be honest about the littlest thing.
"They're just USING you Cas, come on, man, you're not that blind are you? What, do you think Hannah appreciates you or something? She's just another a-hole, thinking she's on a holy mission, and she's got you wrapped around her damn finger—"
a hospital. Sorry man, what were you saying?”
Probably the cold.
She frowned. “The cat must be Ruby’s, and I don’t have a clue where she’s got to. Not that I really care; she was bad news, but I would like to know where she’s sitting on the chess board, so to speak.” She jumped in shock as Gypsum leaped into her lap. “Oh, this is a nice kitty, Castiel!”
“Oh yeah?”
Castiel suppressed a groan. He’d read somewhere, that once you start a lie, it only grows bigger and bigger until it implodes. But ever since he’d saved Sam and met Dean, the lies were not only growing bigger, but multiplying like horny rabbits and hopping all over the place, causing chaos in the vegetable patch.
“I told you,” Castiel said softly, as he sat down on the bed. “I won’t tell
He does a double take.
Going to lunch was probably a bad idea. A very bad idea.
“It’s not going anywhere,” he remarked after pressing uselessly at the button.
Once he had fed Gypsum, and tidied up, he sank to his bed, his phone in his hands.
“Well yes… Didn’t he ever tell you? That’s what killed his mother, and finished his father, though he struggled on for a while.”
“We went to feed the cat—you could have warned me, by the way—and—”
Gabe wrapped the blanket more firmly around his shoulder. “It only took seconds, I followed you down as I called for help. It may have
Even the frosty air felt tense.
.” Castiel reached over and hooked up his chin, to gaze into hot, embarrassed eyes. “Dean. You gave him
“Brings them back to you, like a puppy with a paper?” Dean raised a dubious eyebrow.
“Love is love,” put in Charlie with a smile at Castiel.
Castiel watched as he strode off across the forecourt, as pleased as a small boy showing off his first Dinky car. Hunching his shoulders against the cold, he stood back to admire the car once more. She really was expertly restored—at least as far as
“These electric cars, no heart to them.”
Castiel saw his opening.
“Holy crap man, that’s rough.”
This was worse. This wasn’t a date. They knew. This was a, a what did Gabriel call it? Oh yes, an intervention.
“Not yet,” he said cautiously, and sipped at his coffee. Sam’s brother Dean, he’d come to understand from the general chatter earlier, was off across country seeing some car he wanted to buy or something.
“Well that was me.” Jimmy had always been the successful one. So many times he’d heard Aunt Naomi—not really an aunt, just Jimmy’s Godmother—telling people about her clever, ambitious, Godson. Usually followed by a mournful ‘but poor Castiel, of course…’.”
“Yeah,” Dean blustered, “Well, they had brown eyes too.”
A slim redhead in doctor’s scrubs burst through the door, nearly knocking Castiel over in her haste to get through. She made straight for the bed, and scooped up the clipboard. “I heard he’d been admitted, is Dean here yet?”
He was dorky, and awkward, and liked
“Come on, Castiel. What are you having?”
“Dentist,” Garth said, sampling a handful of peanuts from the sideboard. “I work at a surgery downtown.”
He wondered if Cas still remembered that moment.
"Very well. I need one slice of pie. Any kind. I will consider the rest of my order," Cas replied with a smile.
question gotten us? I just want to go see if I can find more information before we give ourselves a dose of fake confidence and strut headlong into a nest of century old vampire trainers, okay? So—Cas, you ready?"
“Dean- no- just tell me, I—”
Dean nods, still nervous. But if anyone knows the limit to their powers, it’s Jack. The three watch as Jack holds out his hands towards the wall, golden grace surging at it. A thin line of energy appears, and it slowly opens to a dark void.
Dean takes a sharp intake of breath, and his next words come out so fast the former angel almost misses it.
Just knowing,
"By 900, I could do it without argument. Mercy killings, mostly.”
He can hear Sam shouting something. He sees a blurred flash of red hair swoop down in front of them, a small, pale hand drowns itself in dark blood, and Cas's head tilts lethargically to one side, his body threatening to fall on top of Dean's. Being in the Empty had drained his energy as an angel, now that he is out, the effects linger, digging into his weakened human-body without mercy.
“We’ll be off then, Jess,” said the nice EMT once he’d finished his handover. “And before I forget, cher, here’s the guy who saved Mr Winchester, jumped on the tracks and all, so take care of him.” He winked at the nurse as he lay his meaty hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “I let him ride along, but keep that under your hat. He’ll need an x-ray of his right knee as a precaution.”
Castiel sat in frozen silence, before cursing, and dropping his head in his hands.
“We’re keeping him sedated just now anyway, it’s better for his brain recovery,” she said reassuringly. “The surgeon is hoping that we can reduce the sedation next week, to see if he wakes up.”
lady?” He patted the Lincoln.
“Hannah?” he questioned, his tone suddenly flat when he recalled where
But she’d been unimpressed.
“I don’t feel like celebrating.” Dean flexed his fingers experimentally, keeping his gaze on Castiel. “This feels weird.”
“I can’t drive Baby!” Castiel stared at him. He knew enough to know that Baby was Dean’s pride and joy.
“You spent time with Dean last night?” She seemed to wake up a little at that.
“Where exactly is the garage?” Castiel broke in, and his thoughts screamed to a break.
This though, he couldn’t ignore.
“What is it that you do, Dean? I don’t think Cas told me.”
Maybe she
“How many times have I told you? I’m not interested, I’m—”
“Uh-no.” Dean shook his head, smiling a little as Gypsum kneaded his thighs. “You happy down there kitty? Nah. It’s for
“Oh God.” He groaned and dropped his hands to the table. “Look Charlie, I think I’d better come clean.”
“She told them she was going out with
“I’m not sure I can go through with this, Charlie. The deception, it feels very wrong.”
His cheeks red with transferred embarrassment, Castiel turned away.
“For what?” Castiel, cautiously inspected the rear view mirror for any obstructions, before opening his own door, having thoroughly learnt his lesson when it came to Baby.
“It’s been more than 3 months.”
There’s a rainbow flag next to the mailbox.
“Let her go, Dean. There’s nothing wrong in the kitchen.” He pulled him out of the lounge and towards the snug. “I wanted a word with you, in private.”
“You’ll be fine,” Dean reassured him, checking his mirrors. “It’s all clear in the lot behind, and it’s Sunday lunchtime, the roads will be as quiet as they ever are.”
Dean shrugged. “What? Don’t know why you two are gawping at me. Take it as a compliment.”
“You—you barely know me,” he protested, torn between longing for a family Christmas at last, and the knowledge that spending more time with Sam’s family would only make it harder, on all of them, when the truth came out.
The waiting-room was deserted—it was, after all, late the evening—and they settled quickly to fill in their forms.
“The family don’t even know about Ruby. I think Dean disliked her so much, Sam wanted to wait a bit before introducing her to the family. Honestly, I think they only got engaged because she was pressurising him.” She touched his hand again. “I’m glad you told me the truth. Given how on and off Sam’s relationship with Ruby was, there was always the slightest possibility that he had gone and proposed to someone else whilst they were on another break. And Sam’s always been pro-equality, so there was also a little bit of me wondering if perhaps he hadn’t always been
Dean was staring, jaw dropped, at the skeletal apparition, and as Castiel watched nervously, he blinked slowly, before meeting Castiel’s horrified gaze.
“Oh yeah.” Balthazar—and what kind of name was that, anyway?—arrayed himself against the shabby brickwork. “Cassie and I go way back. But I don’t mind sharing, as long as I get
“I don’t understand?” Castiel cast him a glance. Their conversation on the way over had been a little stilted, but Dean had unbent after a while, explaining to him, in terms only an idiot couldn’t understand, how a manual gearbox worked.
They all, Castiel included, turned to look at Dean.
of him. I don’t even care that he’s gay. I just think it’s strange, that’s all, that Sam never mentioned him.”
“Here Fluffy,” he called, waving his hands in the dark, hoping that something, anything, would switch on and provide light. “Here puss,” he cooed, in the high tone his sometimes used—strictly in private—with his own cat. “Fluffy’s din-din’s here at last.”
Cas, his eyes wide and panicked, shakes his head minutely. He looks like he might be about to have another panic attack.
floor apartment was hardly likely to go out for a daily stroll.
,” the voice trailed off, and Castiel, lying on the couch, squeezed his eyes shut.
“Bobby needs me here.” Dean sighed and rubbed his first through his hair. “That sign outside? Used to be ‘Singer and Sons’. Then Sam up and went to law school, and I painted the ’s’ off. Bobby needs me now, more than ever. I won’t paint out the ‘son’, not when he’s been the closest thing to a proper father we’ve ever had.”
“You must come to us tomorrow night, Castiel. We’re determined to have that Christmas after all.”
Castiel shook his head and set his bag of Christmas presents on the floor.
was the adult in the room. “Oh God,” he muttered, and swallowed the bile rising in his throat. It looked like this was on him.
“That’s just what we call a prolonged period of unconsciousness.,” she said, kindly. “We don’t know when he’ll wake up, but he probably will. The Harvelles—that’s Ellen, her daughter Jo, and her second husband Bobby Singer—are frantic with worry, especially as Ellen’s first husband died of a head injury sustained in a hunting accident. It’s got to be bringing back all sorts of bad memories, on top of the trauma of Sam being hurt. They’re broken and lost, just now, but you’ve given them something new to think about.” She smiled up at him, her eyes warm. “They’ve just met you, and they want to get to know you, both as Sam’s fiancé, and the man who risked his own life to save Sam’s. I think at this moment you are the only thing preventing that family from imploding with grief.”
Castiel sighed as he watched them pass by, so anxious, so determined to see Sam.
If Charlie was Dean’s best friend, then the game was probably up, and frankly, at this point, it would a relief.
in bruises! Get me an empty glass, Alan. You don’t have a stiff neck, do you, or a bad headache? These aren’t from the accident, these look like—”
“Your
Castiel pricked up his ears, and, subtly as possible, eyed them with interest.
Castiel scrubbed a hand down his face. “What did he look like?”
“Keep your voice down,” Ellen hissed. “She was embarrassed enough when the tutor called and we had to track her down.”
Trapped between Dean and the car, Castiel froze.
“Dean. We’re breaking confidences here, but we think you need to know. We only found out by accident when Jo’s tutor called us because Jo had missed a week of lectures and they had to run a welfare check. We didn’t know she hadn’t been going in, so we had no idea what to say. Then this tutor got worried, and started asking whether there was any boyfriend trouble—she mentioned she’d been concerned by what the other girls had told her about Jo’s boyfriend.”
“Sam told you about it, huh?” Dean tossed the car keys in his hand, clearly proud of his car. “This is Baby.”
“It’s important if it’s stopping you from going after your dream.” Intrigued now, Castiel leaned forward. “Is it to do with cars?” He took Dean’s distracted grunt as an affirmative. “What you’ve done with this one is incredible. You could make a career out of it.”
Cas gazed after the man as he strode quickly down the steps to the platform, everyone moving out of his way like Moses parting the red sea. He was tall, broad-shouldered too, his camel wool coat—probably cashmere mix—swung out behind him like a cape.
He ground out two words.
“Who you looking for?” The man had a strange accent, like a Brit who’d been in the US too long, and his tone was sultry.
Biting his lip to suppress his amusement, Dean waved him down. “There ain’t nothin’ to be ashamed of, Cas. You wouldn’t be the first to like panties, shall we leave it like that?” He trailed off, still a little red-faced.
Dean frowned, all his instincts bristling.
“So Castiel
Castiel nodded. “I’m sorry if I—”
“Dean?” He peered over the nurse’s shoulder. “I, um. Do you want me to—”
leave me alone, Balthazar. I’m having a bad time.”
“But you’re not sure whether to believe him.”
“He always said he’d have to be drunk to get one,” said Ellen, with a frown.
“Jesus, Balthazar, what are you
“Castiel you’d better sit between Garth and Jo, against the wall.” Ellen showed them to their seats. “Dean, I want you on this side so you can help carry the dishes.”
“Not in Baby though, surely?”
She turns to stir a simmering pan of cheesy sauce. “How did you two meet?”
Dean slid in at the other side.
Dean sank back in his seat, and rubbed his face. This was getting ridiculous. Had they really all known, all along?
“I’m not his responsibility, and I won’t be a kept man.” Castiel drew himself up. “I’m not with Sam for his money, Dean. Please believe me.”
“So, er, did you already use them, or were you just getting started?”
young men can cook,” says Mrs Novak, eyeing Dean approvingly. “Just not mine. You’d better stay for dinner, Dean, Alan’s calling for the rescue truck now, but on a night like this, I’m guessing it will take some time.”
“Who is it?”
“Yeah…” Cas pushes his fingers through his hair. Not helping, dude. “Guess I’d better…”
“You always said you’d murder the next person to hurt your Baby,” Jo mocked. “I take it was your fault, as it’s the front end. What are you going to do now, murder yourself?”
Balthazar shrugged and winked.
“That’s what I mean.” Ellen touched his arm. “That’s what this is all about. Jo… Jo doesn’t fit in with the girls at that college—”
“Well, Charlie isn’t exactly in the market for a boyfriend,” Dean said after a pause only Castiel would have noticed. He grinned, exposing his canines. “So it don’t matter.”
“That’s what
Dean flushed. “I forgot you knew about that.”
Castiel closed his eyes.
Ellen was bright red and flapping at herself with Bobby’s car magazine.
Castiel turned from Dean’s suspicious gaze to look around the parking lot, desperate for a diversion.
“You’re not taking it from our arms?” Dean looked hopeful, and Donna laughed.
Castiel glanced at his watch. “Not at eight am, no.” He had no time for this. He had the day off from the tollbooth, and although he hadn’t planned to go to the hospital until the evening, he wanted to meet up with Gabriel and ask his advice on how best to break the news.
Dean flushed under the security light. “Yeah, well. Look, Jo. We’re coming. You go get me a beer, there’s a good girl.”
“You’re—not what I expected,” Castiel began, because his brain had apparently lost control over his mouth.
Jess stepped over to the bed and checked Sam’s vital signs, before noting something in the chart at the bottom of the bed.
hard to believe.”
“Mr Winchester?” Jessica finished. “Well I’m afraid only next of kin will be allowed to see him, as he is really quite poorly. But—” she added, with a smile, “You did save his life, so I’ll see if I can find out how he is doing.”
Dean shoves him with the heel of his hand, still careful to avoid the pie. Because it’s pie, right?
“Aunt Agatha used to take antihistamines for
“Doesn’t matter.” Dean set his shoulders, before opening the driver’s door. “Right, I hope you’re ready for this.”
“That’s, er.” Dean coughed. “Sorry, TMI really, it bein’ my brother n’all. But, wow. OK. You should get checked out man. I’m sure Sam would help out, you know, if your insurance didn’t cover it properly, or… whatever.” He turned away, his face flaming red, and got to his feet. “I think we’re done here.”
“Ah. It all becomes clear, now.” She chuckled, and Castiel raised his gaze in hope. “Jessica Moore is a sweetheart, and an excellent nurse, but she is also
It wasn’t really something Castiel thought he’d ever forget, and that sudden realisation was probably what caused him to lose control of his mouth and blurt out the question he’d had even since he met Dean.
“Bit of a shortage, she said. Apparently it’s common around Christmas. People got better things to do than donate, I guess. Here you go,” Dean added, as a smiling waitress brought over the menus. “I’m gonna get a beer, same for you?”
“All right.” Dean nodded. “That’s a deal. See you tomorrow?”
and shit?”
Castiel licked his lips.
Castiel scrambled out of the car, twisting his knee in the process, and limped after him. Somehow this had gone very wrong.
“Mum’s comes from a bottle.”
“Yep. This side’s got one. Ah Christ. What was he thinking?” Bobby looked up, trauma writ across his grizzled face. “Dean, you
People actually do that.
It was just that he’d stupidly hoped, somehow, that if the truth came out early enough, and he made a clean breast of it, to Dean… to Bobby and Ellen, then there might be some chance he could stay in touch. In the best case scenario, the fact he’d risked his own life to save Sam’s might, with just a few days of deception, have allowed them to overlook his dishonesty, perhaps even understand how it had come about. But the longer it went on, the worse the betrayal when it finally came out.
Dean’s gaze softened. “And of all the families to land in, you land in ours.” He shook his head as he locked up the Lincoln. “We can come back for this another time. You’ll have to learn to drive it first, though.”
Castiel watched as he stroked Gypsum under the chin, his strong, calloused fingers strangely gentle.
Jesus Christ, there was something horribly wrong with it. It looked, at best, like a cat crossed with a domestic pig. Or like someone had inflated, then shrunk and subsequently skinned a mouse. Its skin wrinkled around its neck and ribs, a strange mixture of pink and grey flesh. The ears. Well dear God, the ears.
“Damnit, Sammy,” he said when they were alone, with only the beeping of monitors for company. “Even unconscious you get the girls, and that nurse is a looker.” He nudged Sam an unresponsive leg. “Maybe your nerdy personality comes over better this way.”
Still frowning he wandered around the lot, immediately dismissing the SUVs as far too expensive, and the fuel consumption would be something akin to a NASA shuttle. Not, he reminded himself, as he shook his head at a Jeep, that he was actually going to
“Hey,” says Dean, pressing a kiss to his icy cheek. “Personal Uber here. We’ll be fine, Baby an’ me. Sam and Bobby’ll be waiting.” Unless Sammy’s got revenge for his thwarted practical joke and is tucking into one of those pies already.
“Dead mailmen?”
Rolling his eyes, Dean stepped back. “Right, well, let’s head over to the blood department, or whatever they call it, and we can grab something to eat nearby. I doubt they’ll let you donate, looking like that.”
“Hard to say with an injury so close to the temple. Was he conscious at all, do you know?”
“And what about Sam’s brother?”
And that’s exactly why I can’t trick them like this, it’s not honest. And anyway,” he added, finally coming up with an unanswerable objection. “Dean might be there, and he’s going to know truth.”
He stared at her. “So what she do, punch them?”
Her blue gaze softened. “The last MRI scan showed that the swelling had gone down, and he is definitely reacting to stimulus. You’ve every reason to hope, Castiel.”
As they stared at each other, a shrill meow came from below. Gypsum stretched up, a paw against his thigh, as she tried to catch the swaying fabric.
“Harrison Ford?” Ellen looked bemused. “But he’s—” Across the table, Castiel winced.
“Castiel? Are you there?”
“I know,” she said, and slowly placed her cup on the table. “But I’m afraid we have no choice.”
He’s like some kind of giddy teenager. He’d better pull himself together because Sammy is going to rip the everlasting piss out of him, if he goes back like this.
“It’s that law firm. They’re all into it. Some departments worse than others.” Dean searched through his pocket for his keys. “Cocaine. I caught Ruby snorting it one night, on the coffee table at Sam’s old place, rolled up dollar n’all. She’s a skank. That’s one of the reasons I’ve not visited his new place. We, uh, we had a row.”
“I like him,” he said at last. “He’s a decent man. Very honest.”
“I know, and maybe you were right. But that doesn’t help us now. Jo… well, Jo’s been having a hard time from some of the other girls. Girls can be difficult, you know?”
. Sure, you wanted to run your fingers through it, though whether to smooth it down or mess it up even more, Dean hadn’t quite decided. But it wasn’t long.
“I’m sorry.” Castiel was contrite. “I won’t mention your little fainting episode to anyone, if you stop fussing over me.”
“I’m really not comfortable driving your car, Dean. What if I crash her?”

What on earth was that about?
“This is Pamela, a family friend.”
He hides his guilt with pie. “I’ve brought provisions.”
Warmed by that casual ‘Cas’, Castiel offered a small smile.
your boyfriend. And boyfriends go on dates.”
“Oh, Bobby, look at him, the poor baby!”
“Oh Dean, of course he’s Sam’s fiance! Why would someone lie about that?” Ellen shook her head.
.” She shook her head as though trying to clear it. “Sam’s unconscious, and we got here, and suddenly we found out about, well, him!” She pointed at Castiel. “He’s Sam’s
Castiel handed the next customer their little blue ticket, then rested his chin in his hands and sighed.
Castiel froze.
“She’s been a good friend to me.” Castiel leaned over to tickle her stomach, his bare arm brushing Dean’s leg. “Damn!”
What he got was Balthazar.
“It’d make him
Dean takes advantage to sign the universal signal for ‘have you told her?’
Then. “Huh. So, how did it go down, with folks. ‘Bout Sam being, you know…”
“He’s a lawyer at MacLaren, May and Mackintosh,” Castiel said, ignoring the offer. He wasn’t betting away his last ten dollars. “That’s one of the big five.”
“Just… er, welcome to the family.”
“He’s a mechanic,” Cas interjects, before the cat is entirely out of the bag. Because the things is, they’ve not had a moment alone. He has no idea whether Dean would be comfortable with his parents knowing all about them, about
for Sam…” He trailed off, looking horrified at himself. “God, I keep forgetting you’re his. His fiance, I mean. I’ve never seen you together so I guess the message hasn’t reached my brain. I don’t want him thinking I’m jealous of his success. Because I’m not. I don’t want his high flying job or his apartment, and I certainly don’t want that hell creature he calls his cat. I’m happy as a mechanic, or I would be if I could get my restoration business going. It’s just, I was freaking out about this for so long. And he then he just waltzed in with his life all sorted. He didn’t even have to come out to them. You did it for him!”
“I’m sorry to hear that,” he said. “And I’ll go tell them to stick their noses out of our business, if that helps, but it doesn’t excuse her behaviour today, and with Cas. What the hell kinda problem’s she got?”
“Jesus, Jo!” He turned on her, his jaw clenched. All he’d been gonna say was, Benny had blue eyes. “How d’you even know that?
“No, it’s… ah, it’s fine.” Flushing, Castiel stepped back from the bed. “Jess said that it was very important we speak to Sam, he may well be able to hear us.”
Dean shrugged. “Just figured he was born under a lucky star.”
“…jumped on the track, saved his life!”
“Not on your nelly, dear.”
“Which butt-cheek?”
“Both of us?” Castiel looked up to see a short woman in her mid-thirties, sporting a warm smile. She was dressed in nurse’s scrubs, and held their notes in her hands.
“Hello!” Missouri’s face lit up as everyone turned to greet her. “Merry Christmas everybody!”
A boxy design, the colour a sort of dull gold. He’d always imagined it was the sort of car a President would ride in. Comfortable and spacious. Imposing.
Garth slipped a bony arm around his shoulder.
“So, about that cat.”
Castiel shook his head. “I don’t think so. No, I got to him straight after he was knocked onto the rails and he was already unconscious then. Is—is that a bad sign?”
“Are we expecting company?” Cas’s dad holds out his hand, and Cas squeezes it, suddenly noticing how fragile it feels.
“Yeah?” Dean shrugged easily and clinked their bottles together. “We’re saving lives! I didn’t lie.”
Dean swallowed, but he had to step in, though Missouri’s eery certainty had him struggling for composure.
buttcheek, but—he bit his lip—he had an answer that might suffice. If he was brave enough to try.
Castiel froze once more, then, slowly he turned to face Dean, the door handle in his hand.
Sorry for the lack of update last Monday - I had a never-ending migraine. Hopefully this longer chapter makes up for it. As usual, it hasn't been edited or betaed. Do point out any mistakes, I'm not sure I'm with it enough to notice.
“She thinks you’re a doctor!” Castiel protested, scandalised, as she bustled away and returned immediately with a coke and beer.
“I’m glad you came,” he called, over the rising whirr of the kettle.“We’ve got to tell them the truth. I can’t spend another evening with Dean, without clearing things up. Not…” he added, “that he will want to spend any more time with me once he knows.”
“Did you hear what she did?” he snapped back, as Jo, with a quick glance at him, cosied up to Missouri, where he couldn’t get at her.
Dean recovered enough to grab his own spoon, because he wasn’t letting Missouri and Charlie get all the pie. “They wouldn’t listen to
“I’ll stay too,” said Charlie. “My shift’s just finished.” She shepherded the subdued little group to the elevator, before turning turned a bright but ominous smile on Castiel.
Castiel waited, breathing quietly and evenly, until the house was quiet once more, and he judged all danger had passed. He checked his phone. It was only seven; if he left straight away he could get to his morning shift on time, and hopefully avoid meeting Dean and the interrogation that would surely follow.
He sighed.
“You look like you’ve been attacked.” She wipes the drying blood from his knee. “Though it’s strange they’re only on your legs.”
“She’s beautiful! Did you restore this one, too?”
If it had been Ruby herself he’d have been wondering how, exactly, she’d tricked Sam into marriage. But this was Castiel, and this naive, slightly awkward guy, nestled into the bench seat, his hair ruffled like a flustered chick, was about as far from her Royal Hellness as it was possible to be,
“Ah,” said Castiel, his mind racing. This was getting worse by the moment. What if Ruby was pregnant? Oh Jesus, this was such a mess.
“Dean!” It came from all corners of the room.
“Lucky Hannah didn’t hear that.”
serious with Cas, they both know that this isn’t just a hook-up. There’s something here, something Dean doesn’t dare look at yet. But Christmas with the in-laws, when they’ve spent the entire day sucking each other’s mouths, dicks, and—his inner thighs somehow shiver—his legs. No, that’s a step too far, for anyone.
‘Jen’ winked at him. “Be right back, Doc.”
Dean scrubbed his forehead. “What do you mean, seeing me with other people? You haven’t seen me with anyone.”
“How do we even know this guy is Sam’s fiance anyway?” burst in Dean, frowning, just as Castiel started to hope the train of conversation had been derailed completely. “Something’s off. Too many things don’t add up.”
“I’m not surprised, if the only option’s men like you.” Jo grabbed the wine from his grasp and poured her own glass, as Charlie swung into the room, her scarlet hair snow-speckled and her cheeks flushed with cold.
He passed a hand over his face.
“Seven, for dinner. We’re going to midnight mass afterwards.”
“Yup, looks like it.” She ushered them towards the double doors and then followed her blonde ponytail through the corridors. “I’m Nurse Hanscum, but you boys can call me Donna. It’s good of youse to come down here when everyone else is partying. But I see you’ve ticked the friends & relatives box.” She opened the curtains to a cubicle. “I’m real sorry to hear that, but you are making a difference.”
? At eight am?”
“I wasn’t feeling like it.” That was genuine, anyway. Possibly the only thing all night that was.
“You’re telling me.” Gabe, his voice strained, was sitting beside him on the step.
“It sure is, but Ellen’s got a proper fire going, you just wait and see.”
“It’s true,” said Charlie, who had been watching him carefully. She dipped her spoon into the pie, alongside Missouri. “All Dean’s paramours have been brunets. But they’ve all had brown eyes.”
As if she could hear Castiel’s thoughts, Gypsum came over to chirrup at the panties.
“Original.” With a smirk, Dean strode across the concrete, towards a Prius and a sleek black muscle car Castiel thought looked like a classic Chevy. Going by what he’d heard at Bobby’s the previous night, he knew Dean was unlikely to be the owner of the Prius.
Thanks for the suggestions after the last chapter. This was drafted pretty quickly in response and I haven't even had time to check it, so let me know any issues. A scene with Dean and Jo will also be coming in the next few weeks.
“Come in!” She opens the door wider. “I’m a nurse, I can take a look at that leg for you.”
She smiled at him as she led him to a wheelchair and flipped up the footplates. “It’s better to check.” And then before he could protest again, he was being conveyed towards the x-ray department. Castiel subsided with a groan. He seemed to be on a conveyor belt he couldn’t escape, at least until the medics had satisfied themselves that he was all right.
It’s only been one day.
“Sure you don’t want to help?” Dean asked, glancing over his shoulder, his t-shirt rucking up as he lifted his arms—and Sam’s—high above the bed.
“Sam’s never mentioned you,” said Bobby, his arm tucked protectively around his wife.
“In other words,
“Sam doesn’t have a cat!”
an idiot—”
to knock myself out in the garage.” He leaned in. The leather was soft and supple under his fingers. “I don’t care if it’s the ‘wrong leather’. It’s still beautiful. Did you have to sew it together, to make it fit?”
“You have a blood count of 8.5.”
“My friends do, just not ones that know my family. My dates, my male dates, obviously knew, but they only usually ended in one-night stands.” Dean pursed his lips. “There was just one guy, I saw more than once. Aaron. We dated, but I couldn’t be open about it, and so he broke it off. Can’t say I blame him.”
“What, you think I’m gonna abandon you here?” Dean’s gaze softened. “Cas. Don’t beat yourself up about it. Yeah, I’m annoyed. But it wasn’t your fault, not really. You tried to tell me you didn’t know what you were doing, and I didn’t listen.” He gave one last look at the hood, winced, and then squeezed past the partially open passenger door. “But you should probably give
“I’m not your servant, Dean Winchester.” Jo stepped down onto the path, her pink fluffy slippers incongruous against her ripped jeans and grungy hoodie. “What’s up?”
Sam lay still and pale in the high hospital bed, his usually glossy hair dull and matted with dried blood. He was hooked up to various machines which bleeped and flashed in a way that was probably supposed to be reassuring but reminded Castiel of every medical drama he’d ever watched. At some point they’d all start screeching and nurses would appear with those paddles.
“Reckon you can get a pushchair in the trunk, not a massive one, but something fairly compact. At least Sam’s place has got an elevator, wouldn’t want to haul a kid up your staircase.” He paused. “I guess you’ll be moving into Sam’s after the wedding.”
Dean can't help smiling down at the blueberry-dappled pancakes, listening to the quiet sizzling of the griddle, and the graveled, jumbled lyrics to his new favorite song.
on the subject,
creepy?"
“I know.” Dean holds up a hand, and gives a weak smile. “I know. I gotta be honest, man- I… I'm not good with this whole, uh… love. And.. Love. Thing. But I do believe in us.”
"You never consider anyone else's point of view but your own," Castiel speaks quietly to the hunter's back. "I wanted to be here, Dean. But once again, I
and Sam knew he'd become
” Dean puts on a pouty face. “TINY BURGERS, Cas.”
Apparently, the inside of the lamp had been made from cooler colors: blues, greens, purples, so that now, the pile of shards displayed a rainbow of hues.
The atmosphere is good, so sweet, yet all of it is dampened.
“Dean? Something wrong?” Cas asks.
Dean thinks and it’s almost too much, on top of the very recent makeout session.
Listen to "Hold On" by Chord Overstreet for full effect :D
rotating him until he was in the correct position. The angel's dark head snapped up in surprise, but Dean was relieved to notice he didn't seem to have any remarks about the abnormally intimate gesture. Actually, Dean was a little surprised himself at Cas's lack of resistance. Cas was yielding to every small press of his hand, every correction, every nudge. He seemed a bit surprised, nervous even, Dean could tell, but it was almost like…
she was making the first move, which was rare, and
Yes, he’d always been reckless. No doubt about it.
But never had Sam seen his brother look so very scared.
"Oh." Cas sounded interested.
That was the guy he wanted to be, the guy he pretended to be, even though he knew happiness wasn't real. Good things didn't happen to him. Not to Dean Winchester.
"I'd prefer to just keep this between you and me for the time being. Just… for right now."
Dean Winchester had never been good with words, but that's what music was for. It meant more to Dean than most other things. Hell, he'd never even given
Los Angeles California.
Dean reaches up a blood soaked hand, gripping Cas’s shoulder. “Cas it’s-it’s over, I’m so sorry-
Dean. You don’t." Cas met his eyes, and Dean was shaken to see how very dead the angel looked. When he spoke, it came out in graveled rasps, but Dean recognized the determination behind each sentence. Cas needed this.
in his stead," Cas growls. "Take ME." The words clamp a weight to the inside of his chest, a weight he knows will never disappear.
Cas thought.
“Dean!” Cas pokes his apron-free head out of the doorway, blue eyes squinted in a puzzled expression. “Where are you going?”
in every way imaginable.
So while Dean packed his gear, Sam sneaked a look at the clipping. He was barely a couple sentences in when his stomach dropped.
breakfast—"
of fluids, especially soup and water, and to get plenty of rest, try not to move too much—”
HERE.
Sam smirked. "Dean, come on. I had help. I'm not the only one who's utterly sick of your guys' side-stepping nonsense."
ATTENTION: okay so the italics aren't working right now, I don't know why. I'm trying to figure it out, but my converter isn't working like it's supposed to. I'm hoping it'll work eventually.
And of course, the continuation of Dean/Cas's pool game. ;)
Maybe he deserved to die, but Cas didn't deserve to stay dead.
Dean sighed, his panting breaths slowing to a normal pace. Cas could sense that the hunter was not quite angry, just shaken and exasperated. Since Dean seemed to be over his shock for the most part, Cas turned to face the shape in the glass stall.
And I know—"
He suddenly wondered if Charlie pictured those things when she had read the books. Probably. It was kinda hard not too, with Chuck's overly-descriptive writing style. She also said she'd read a lot of fanfiction and—
He raised an eyebrow, giving the angel a mock-serious look, and began arranging the balls into a triangle shape. "and two: you can't be a part of the team without knowing how to play a decent game of pool."
“Yes, actually,” Eileen pats her belly. “If it’s a girl, Lucy, and if it’s a boy, Maxwell.”
So the items they did have, the ones that meant something… Dean's car. Cas's coat. Those were the things that mattered, in their own personal, strange way. Dean knew that Cas needed that coat, just as he needed his car. These things held memories, as well as mistakes; they acted as reminders of what they'd been through, and every time they'd died, or almost died, those things were still there waiting for them when they got back. So Cas cleaned the blood and the leviathan goo and the lake water from each thread as lovingly as Dean hammered back each dent in Baby's hood, replaced the toy soldiers in the cupholder and the Legos in the radiator.
Dean has heard that pleading, heavy voice, laden by all the things which cannot be changed, even by a changed angel. He knows the voice well, for it is sometimes his own.
Happiness. The word hadn't made sense to him as a teenager, and it didn't make sense to him now. Honestly, he kinda wished the word didn't even exit. Then maybe he wouldn't have to wonder his whole life what it meant. And why he'd never felt it.
Sam appears in the doorway a few minutes later, haggard and covered in blood. Cas lifts his gaze weakly, and tries, unsuccessfully, to pull his own weight as Sam helps him through the doorway. They move as quickly as possible.
"I’m serious. I have always forgiven you." Cas paused, leaning against the car next to Dean, their arms pressed flush against each other, a source of warmth in the cool evening. They looked up at the beginnings of stars, glinting out among the dark blue sky. "Life is too short to be resentful Dean."
The conspicuous attacks would of course attract hunters, but while the experienced vamps knew this, and were careful to hide themselves after the killing spree, they refrained from gracing the newborn vamps with the same knowledge. Hunters came. Hunters found. Hunters killed. And with everything matching up, an appropriate number of bloodthirsty vamp heads on a stick, and no other clue as to the existence of other vamps in the area… the hunters would leave. And the senior Dracula's would continue on with their pack's traditions, moving secretly throughout largely populated cities to avoid major fuss about missing persons. The higher the crime rate of the city, the better.
"Dean?"
Burning with fury, he'd asked his father why. Just to see what he could say.
What's up Bitches!!!
“Hey, bitch.” Dean snarks.
because that's what it was, it was his and Cas's, and he felt as if Led Zeppelin was better than he'd ever remembered. As if he never wanted to step out into the air, just wanted to stay there with Cas sitting shotgun, just
"Dude, he's not answering to me. I think you have to call him."
Dean would've laughed, but the weight of his thoughts had begun to flood back in.
"You think you're so very dull…. Like you're the back of some novel—
They'd both lied to him that night, but Sam knew. He'd known a while ago. It only took one hunt with Dean and Lee to see that there was something else going on. The way they looked at each other, private glances, coveted moments of contact that were entirely unnecessary. So Sam wondered for a while, but Dean never mentioned anything, and he'd almost decided to let the theory go, almost dismissed the idea. He must have just misread the situation. A simple misunderstanding, that's all.
Charlie gathers the crumpled pages in her hands and steps quietly out of the bedroom, attempting to not make any noise.
But he just shrugged. "Yeah, well… since when have our lives ever been easy."
Beautiful because it’s all he’s ever wanted to see. Beautiful because it was once considered rare, but now it holds a promise to become more frequent. Beautiful because finally, Dean knows this is a smile he can look back on with happiness. It isn’t a deathbed moment, and it isn’t a lie, and it isn’t a cover up for some hidden pain: it’s real. Real happiness.
The Empty steps closer.
Cas swallows back his anger, shoving down the memories that the hunter's words had awoken. Memories of
Oh. And one other person.
And then she'd said 'But I tell myself. Over and over again. I'm not there anymore. I'm not in the bad anymore. And somehow…. It helps.'
, it was
Cas blinked down at his coat, as if offended that Dean would dare insult its comfortability. "My trenchcoat was covered in blood and stains, so no, Dean, I didn't wear it at
Cas leans against the table, arms folded, glaring at the rambling hunter before him. "Or what, Dean? What could I have done to predict that Jack's powers would still be so weak, one year later? What could I have done?"
"Did I offend him?"
Both Winchester's turned towards the angel, who stood near the door. He looked tense. Unsure.
Once, these movies and shows were only distractions for Dean’s own life.
“As you wish,” Dean whispers.
OUR SPECIAL SPOTIFY PLAYLIST
"Dude." Sam looked up from his laptop. "That's the second shower today. And Cas left for
of keeping it in. And I know, I
true form, I suppose. But that’s not my point.”
Sam slumped heavily in his chair, breathing out a truly exhausted sigh before shutting his laptop closed. He felt his eyelids flutter shut, then snapped them open again.
Well, he hadn't known that. Dean's actions over the years had been contradictory, at best. Damaging, at worst. He wished Dean could have told him this a long time ago, a time when those were the words he dreamed of hearing, the words that he needed more desperately than sleep or food or air.
Simple, mundane tasks, but Cas had let himself feel almost happy. He'd almost gone over the edge. And so he'd left, that night. Quietly, and unnoticed, he'd slipped out the front door, leaving Dean in the kitchen where he'd been making popcorn for the both of them. Dean had been humming, and Cas remembered standing outside of the bunker's door, the seconds feeling more like hours, feeling Dean's happiness absorb their bond in a glow of warmth.
"—then why'd you leave so suddenly huh?" Dean retaliates, chest heaving. "I went to get you and you were
And in that moment… he could hardly recall a time when he had seen Dean look more terrified. So he had stuffed his own aching hurt as far back as he could, even though he knew he'd regret it later.
His lungs collapse and suddenly each breath is too short and too small and not enough—
Dean looked over at Cas, who was squinting at the back of the Heinz bottle.
(—But you're not hungering for food, or sex, or drugs, or booze, so logically, the only thing left would be—)
"Seriously, though," Dean held up a warning finger. "Don't mention it. Sam'll never let me live it down," Dean grimaced, imagining the look on his brother's face. The teasing would never end.
Dean watches in half horror and half amusement as the pickiest eaters in the bunker enjoy what must be the strangest mix of flavors he’s ever seen.
Cas's face, calm and cold, and that was the worst by far because even though it had been Lucifer who'd stabbed him, it was Dean who had to carry the still-warm body. Dean who had to place his best friend, limp and unmoving, on that table, and it had been Dean who sat there, by a dead angel's side for hours, staring into the face of perfect calm, and realizing it was the most peaceful Cas had looked in a long time.
“You were talking about Inigo?” Cas prods, curling in closer.
." Sam gestured at the both of them with a frenzied, almost hysterical, frustration. "THIS. This, this—EYE-sex, and the BICKERING and the—the—constant 'oh I just HAVE to stand two inches from his face' thing and—" he retreated into silent huffs and exasperated miming motions.
With Cas, however, the idea of sex seemed only to escalate the poor guy's stress levels. Honestly, he'd never seen Cas look more terrified.
He watched Cas do his dumb geometry trick, and sink the next shot with surprising ease. "Well, damn. You actually don't suck at this."
p.s. charlie and i are going to be starting a new fic after this one is done, so, watch out for that in the coming weeks!!
Cas nodded in understanding, and Dean continued. "but- truth is… love is just stuff like
"Don't you leave this room, Cas. Not again. You just got here." Dean felt a burning sting in the corners of his eyes, and his throat swelled.
This isn’t the first time they’ve had a deep conversation, but Cas knows how difficult it is, even still, for Dean to open up. No amount of time will ever burn away the skeletons in each of their closets. But at least now, those skeletons are no longer secrets.
Well, not
He remembered when Cas had labeled
--------------------------------------------------------
Cas feels a dark, fluttering feeling. He stutters as he speaks. “Well, we, uh, we still don’t know where Dark Kaia is. Or the spear.”
He dug out three twenty dollar bills—far too much for the two burgers, even including an extravagant tip, but he figured the waitress needed the extra cash—slapped it on the table and pulled Dean's cargo jacket off the chair, hooking it over his arm. Dean slowly got up, as if confused by the sudden hurry to leave, but Cas understood the meaning of human embarrassment. He also knew that a distraction, such as driving back to the hotel, would be a good time for Dean to think over their conversation.
like I'm doing?"
"Dean!" Jody sounds genuinely delighted, and Dean can't help a small smile. "How's that angel of yours doing?"

Piercing ocean blue, but they also contain volcanoes and distant births of stars and the deepest crevices of the most far-flung forest and everything that is superhuman.
"That was due purely to the effects of Famine—"
There are episodes twice a week, outlining the how’s and why’s of tampering with everything from demons to leviathan, but mostly, Sam considers it to be his own proud contribution to the Men of Letters legacy— passing on knowledge… only this time, in a global, and more modern-day approach.
"Why would you eat…barf-soaked intestines?"
Dean turns his head to look at Cas, not being able to do so with his torso. The stitches were taken out a few days ago, but the wound is far from healed. “Yeah?”

Don't even get him started on the

Dean returned the smile, feeling strangely satisfied that an Angel of the Lord found his clothes to be comfortable. "Toldja. If you want, you can keep em. I have a few more pairs at home."
and Cas standing on his toes, legs pressed against Dean's, and..
"Just think about what you want to do, Dean. When you think of Cas, how would you want to show him love?"
And it isn't that I
He almost laughed. He couldn't imagine Hannah ever being anything but bluntly honest. It was her most prominent trait. That, and an acute, but slightly antiquated sense of justice. Then again, who was he to judge? Before Dean, Cas had been just like her. Stoic, logical, 'a big picture kinda-guy,' as Dean would call it.

long debate about the pros and cons of a variety of pancake toppings and Dean smiles, listening only partially to the conversation and fiddling with the ring on his finger. Thinking.

Dean swallows, refusing to meet Cas’s eyes. “Maybe.”

Sam thought, as Charlie's mirthful laughs slowed to breathless wheezing. Not that he minded so much. It had been a long time since he'd seen anyone laugh that hard.

He looked down, fiddling with the set of keys. "Cas,
The empty tilts its head at the both of them, then speaks, as if amused. “You know he isn’t real, right Castiel? You know this is just-” it swirls its hands vaguely at the black nothingness, “-just another one of my concoctions, built for your personal enjoyment.”
Dean was biting his bottom lip, obviously holding in laughter, and Cas sighed. "I give up. I mean to say that I believe your brother may wish to participate in this conversation." Dean laughed and made a motion as if to shuffle Cas aside. The bathroom was rather tiny, and Cas could feel Dean's intense warmth seeping off of his skin as the hunter squeezed past him and towards the door. He turned the knob, but Sam wasn't there.
“I’m- good—I-” Dean coughs out, taking a raspy breath. “Yeah. I’m gonna kill him.”
"yes." Cas whispered in a low, focused voice.
Sam slumped on Dean's bed, fingers pinching the brooding ache above his nose that had begun a little while ago, but had now sprung into a full-sized throb of frustration.
"By the time he caught us, we hadn't done anything more than, ya know. Just—not much."
The GUILT, it slammed spikes of infectious lies into every moderately happy moment, until he couldn't remember the last time he had been
He smiled at the pseudonym, hoping she'd get the reference. He left the note at the same place they'd talked. And he followed his heart out the door, leaving the two trays of shots where he'd left them.
Problem 2: how to make them get past their issues?
"Okay, just—don't laugh."
He could still remember a time when Sam Winchester, the man now sitting across from him, was only 'the boy with the demon blood,' an abomination fit for destruction.
"Dean? What happened? What's wrong?"
Sam will plan a celebratory gathering, and this will be a planned pleasure, welcome and exciting: but meek in the presence of the public kisses that Cas will press to Dean’s cheek, and the quiet, sudden emptiness of the bunker’s library when everyone has left, and the sound of whiskey in clinking glasses, and the taste of whiskey on Cas’s lips: and these will be the unexpected, and the happiest moments of them all, the small things.
"—or you could've helped Sam translate all these damn Enochian scrolls, or—" Dean breaks off, stammering for words.
Cas doesn’t know how to answer. He’s too busy re-learning how to breathe.
He could have
Cas gestures in the direction of the kitchen, still wearing a happy grin that reminds Dean of the time he spent the day eating a few hundred burgers.
"Which one is it?" Charlie interrupted. "I think it's just up to preference, but Destiel is kinda the
the sounds Cas can make….
"Every time I try, it's like- it just sounds stupid."
"Nope," Dean rolls his eyes and drags both hands down his face, muttering criticism. "Way too cliché, what is wrong with me, get it together, Winc—"
Dean grabs a towel to clean up the spewed coffee and pats Cas on the shoulder. “Don’t worry about it. You’ll uh- well— you’ll find out eventually.”
"Okay, now try focusing on hitting the cue ball straight on, and with power, but aim it as if you were to directly hit that solid ball."
Sam grimaced in response, but Dean grinned at the memory. "
Smirking, Dean clapped Cas on the shoulder. "Damn right. Besides, tapes like that aren't exactly rare treasure. Zeppelin was around when my parents were first dating. Practically the whole reason they got together in the first place. Apparently, Dad used to sing a lot, before—" Dean felt his jaw clamp, and he took a sharp breath.
"The first 36 of them had to be killed by Naomi," Cas continued, speaking hastily as if that would make it easier. "She slaughtered them brutally, and made me watch, until I learned it would be better to try to kill them quickly without objection. Of course it wasn't that simple. She made you say things…. Do things. Just to make it worse."
THANK YOU GUYS.
Then again, how
Cas squinted, still staring at the screen. It was coming up to one of Dean's favorite parts, the infamous fast-draw showdown between Doc Holliday and Johnny Ringo.
The meal goes smoothly, but Dean can’t focus. Cas is chatting with the family, but Dean is quiet; he’s too excited. It’s been
thing
“I did,” Cas says softly, and Dean nods. He nods again.
Dean turned around, to where the angel was frowning at the miniscule Bible, which was kind a funny scenario, considering.
So many ups and downs, if their lives were turned into a rollercoaster, it probably wouldn’t even be legal to ride it.
"Am I the pizza man, Cas?"
-----------------------------------
"Don’t call me that," Janitor Boy snaps, which is not particularly angelic of him.
And so the questions and the doubts circled endlessly, and Dean had stopped counting the hours. Stopped checking the clock.
"I'm alright," Dean finally answers, concentrating on keeping Freddie to a minimum. He stands up to shake the dust out of his blue and pink flannel, then picks up his guitar and falls limply into a chair, strumming a few chords of Queen to appease the shapeshifting Voice. Most times, it helps weaken the onslaught.
Dean has always kept a lot of spare parts to the Impala, just in case. Even extra window panes, for those far-too-often occasions when bullet holes or monster heads would crash through his baby’s beautiful surface.
Taking a breath, Dean sneaks a glance at the doorway. He doesn't hear footsteps. "I- I have this problem. I can't- Cas is so good at being, well,
time of the day."
"You lookin' to get wasted tonight?" She asked, and Dean looked up. "Cause ya know, this stuff is pretty strong."
The nurse, Liv, rushes over and presses a firm hand against Castiel’s chest. He is dismayed to notice that her gentle pressure is more than enough to stop his weakened body from getting up.
keep his promise of staying around, in this line of work, it was always safer to assume you'd die the next day. He'd heard that saying, 'live like there's no tomorrow,' too many times to count, but the phrase was taken far more literally for hunters. It was almost more of a rule than a cliché piece of life-advice.
“I, erm, it’s been men, recently, though. There were women, years ago. But not, I mean, I’m not, they don’t really…”
“Your turn to drive, remember.”
“I’ll help.” Dean got to his feet. “Show me what to do. I’m a mechanic, it can’t be all that different from a car engine.”
“A knitter?” Dean raised an eyebrow, apparently unsure how to react to that information. “You mean you knit
“Bed-bugs don’t have wings. Let me take a look,” says Mr Novak, gently pushing his wife out of the way. “Entomology was my hobby, as a boy. I kept thirteen stick insects at one point, and I’ve been bitten by pretty much anything you could imagine.”
“I’m looking forward to it.”
“What’s it called?”
“Cas, you’d better come and help me with the salad, and I’d like your advice on the Christmas centrepiece.” And then as Cas hesitates. “I’m sure your father is capable of entertaining your friend.”
“Want the radio on?”
“Yes. Well, no. I’m not going.” Castiel stumbled. “What I mean, is, my cat—the one who ran away when you came in—she likes to steal panties, off people’s washing lines, you see, and—
She smiled sweetly at Dean.
Castiel cringed, but Dean patted his hand, lying on the white sheets between them. “It’s not your fault, Cas.” He sighed, his shoulders slumping. “No. If anything this whole mess is my dad’s fault.”
“Oh my goodness! Are you okay?”
Sauntering through his apartment, Balthazar whistled as he caught sight of the rest of Castiel’s boxers, drying on the heater.
“All right, all right. It’s a deal.” Balthazar raised his hands in surrender and stepped into the cupboard. “But just so you know, nobody keeps Balthazar in the closet. Not even you.”

They never did get to go.
He trailed off, leaving it open to interpretation.
didn’t think Dean was going to make a move. It was just… awkward. “So, tell me about the garage. I have to admit, I wasn’t expecting anything quite so substantial.”
Not just fabric. Electric blue panties, satin, with a black lace trim.
“Oh. My. God. What the hell happened to Baby?”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Well, uh. Bobby did some of the work on the chassis when I was out of town, but I did most of it.” He leaned past and rubbed at an invisible mark on the door. “And I came in to give her a quick polish this morning. She’s got grubby from all the slush.”
“I guess.” Dean chewed on thoughtfully. “I dunno what Sam’s told you, ‘bout us growing up. But, for the years before Bobby and Ellen took us in, I was basically his parent. I’ve been pickin’ him up and cleaning up his scraped knees since he was a tot. Kissed his booboos an’ everything.”
Castiel glanced apologetically at Ellen.
Cursing himself, Castiel shrugged.
“Kind of strange,” Castiel played for time. “An anti-possession tattoo. Some sort of pentagonal shape, I’m not sure what shape is is technically.” He’d looked up anti-possession marks on google on his way home from the hospital, the day he’d met Crowley. He wasn’t exactly sure what Sam’s looked like, but he had nothing to lose by making a guess at that point. “He’s a little embarrassed by it.”
Sorry for the delay, I had a rather chaotic return from my holidays.
“Got a what?”
“I’m sorry,” he said formally, juggling the shoes as he tried to untangle the knot in his laces. “But as you can see, I’m not one for formal wear, myself. Anyway, I—I should get going. My shift starts in an hour.”
“O-kay,” says Dean, at last. Because the only way out of this is to hitch up his jeans, and run.
Bracing himself, Castiel limped towards his apartment door, whilst various thumps emanated from the closet in the hallway.
Bobby rolled his eyes. “What Ellen’s trying to say, kid, is that Jo told them all she had a boyfriend, a big, strong, older, leather-jacket wearing ‘kick ass’ boyfriend.”
“Yeah? She one of those people who think all gay men wanna go all ‘queer-eye’?”
“It’s fine, Cas, just a car. Not like we don’t have hundreds lying round the yard. Not,” he added, “That it’s a wreck. It’s… well they’re in decent nick. I’m saying no more.”
“Yeah yeah, I’m fine.” Dean waved them down. “I can fix her up.”
Dean turned to him, his eyes lighting up at the sight of the cookies. “Here you go, make sure you get your share too.” He stuffed a chocolate chip cookie in his mouth, his cheeks bulging as he chewed. “Not the best, but it
Benny doesn’t answer. Nor do Sammy, or Bobby. They’re probably too busy talkin’, about Dean, and his Professor. Sammy still hasn’t gotten over that. Dean with an honest to God Professor.
he felt like an idiot.
“Whoops?”
Charlie took a long gulp of coffee, her forehead screwed up in a frown.
“Whisky’ll warm him up just fine.”
“Dean…”
then he wouldn’t be able to give blood, and at this point that was the one good thing he could do for Sam, and anyone else who needed it.
“Benny was blue-eyed, and brown-haired.” Jo was watching him, her eyes sparkling with glee.
The creature—he wasn’t sure he could ever accept it as a
Arriving in the neurology ward side by side, they bumped into Jess coming out of Sam’s room, pushing a medication trolley familiar to Castiel from his days at his father’s bedside.
“Dean, you don’t have to—we should just wait until Sam’s awake. Discuss this sensibly.”
She nodded. “He is. Handsome too, or so every straight woman in my acquaintance tells me.”
“I’m gay, Dean,” Castiel said, blinking at the sudden change of subject. “It doesn’t mean I don’t like or respect women. In fact, as a member of the LGBTQ+ community I feel I have an innate understanding of the structural imbalances in our society which have an adverse and disproportionately negative impact on—”
“It’s not all right, and if Jo weren’t eating herself up with jealousy, she’d know that.”
“You’d love it, Sammy. All sleek. A ’58 silver Corvette. Pretty good condition on the surface but it’ll need a lot of restoration. Rust damage to the chassis, needs new lights too.” He smiled, thumbing through his phone for photos of his new purchase. It was just the sort of car he’d have happily spent his whole life working on, if he hadn’t been needed at the junk yard now Bobby was getting slow.
Trouble was, Castiel was obviously an idiot.
“Well, as soon as you know how much it’s going to cost—parts
with his smile in the first place, Ellen.” Bobby retreated to hallway, muttering about ’stuck-up law school and that Crowley person’, and letting in a savoury aroma of turkey and roast potatoes.
“What Mom’s not saying is that she’s got an enormous turkey in the fridge, and at least six pies,” put in Jo, who seemed to have had a change of heart. “If you don’t come and help us we are going to roll into New Year.”
It seemed wise to change the subject.
Castiel turned his gaze to the bedsheets. “You’ve never told anyone?”
They spent the rest of the morning at the hospital, although Castiel refused to drive the Impala there, throwing the keys back to Dean and shaking his head. The ice-covered streets were busy and he didn’t trust himself to handle a manual gear shift, especially in Dean’s pride and joy. Still, he enjoyed watching Dean’s obvious pleasure in handling the Impala, his hands confidently curled around the steering wheel as he grinned over at Castiel from time to time.
“What on earth were they? It’s not mosquito season.” Suddenly Mrs Novak’s back between his legs, armed with more antiseptic swabs. “Something’s been devouring you.”
was he supposed to do with Sam’s stuff?
He’s gonna have to call Cas after all.
Groaning, Dean checks the clock on the dashboard. “What time did you say your parents were expecting you?”
She wrinkled her nose. “It has to be done, but I always feel it’s more dignified if we don’t have an audience.”
Cas returns to his task, beating the sauce with a… oh for fuck’s sake. The guy’s tryin’ to whisk a roux with a fuckin’ latte frother.
She trailed off uncertainly, and Dean stared at her.
“Jumping on the tracks, would you believe? He’s a brave guy, Sam’s lucky he was there.” She gave Dean a quick once-over. “Look, I don’t want to stick my nose where it’s not wanted, but you seem like a down to earth guy, and it might not even occur to your family…”
“It’s my brother, Sammy,” Dean said, apparently recovered from his earlier embarrassment. “He’s up in neurology—in a coma.”
Jesus, for a guy who’s got a fuckin’ doctorate, he’s slow on the uptake.
happy.”
After a long and necessary nap on Castiel’s recently vacated sofa—well-deserved after spending the previous few nights sleeping folded into the back of the freezing Impala—Dean dropped by the hospital to take a look at Sam.
“Who else is goi—” The door security light flared, illuminating them on the driveway. Dean glanced towards the house, and grimaced. “And… here we go.”
Castiel stopped at that. “Trust me. I’m usually awkward.” He shook his head. “Jimmy was the bright one, the one that would do well. A religious foundation offered him a scholarship on the other side of the country, and he took it.”
“Er, sorry.” Dean scrubbed his hand through his hair. “That came out wrong. I don’t, I don’t have a problem with it. Just so ya know. Just surprised Sam didn’t tell me. And in desperate need of sleep.”
Perhaps he really was a lightweight.
“Say thank you, Cassie.” He held out the bag and leaned forward, winking lasciviously. His hips were pressed close, though Castiel managed to manoeuvre the bag between them.
“Yeah. And it wasn’t news to any of us,” Bobby said. “So just you hold your horses.”
! But what was Sam even
“The hospital just called us. We were all together for Christmas Eve—”
you’re not hurt? You’ve got to be more careful, what would Sam say if he woke up to find
Castiel shook his head. “It’s a bit late for all that. I’ve been thinking though—”
“I hope I’m not putting my foot in it here, I do tend to do that.” She paused, then frowned again. “But what I’m really confused about is how Sam Winchester could have
“You don’t need to worry about that, Cas.” Dean glanced at Castiel’s legs, for some reason. “The insurance will cover the costs.”
“Oh, sure.” Dean turned a charming grin on the waitress. “A bit of sugar’ll help. Couple of cheeseburgers, please, er, Jen. Quick as you can, we gotta go save lives.”
“Hello, Baby,” Castiel said, gravely, walking around to inspect the hood. A quick glance at Dean showed it was the right approach to take, and in any case, he was genuinely impressed.
“What’s he like then?”
“I got all the time in the world.”
“Sorry Ellen,” was Dean’s automatic reply, and Castiel bit his lip at his submissive tone.
Dean clapped his hands together. “Jo says you’ve made apple pie.” He turned to Castiel. “It’s my favourite. Ellen is a
“You still here?” A bright voice interrupted his stumbling soliloquy and Jess’ curly head appeared around the door. “I’ve got to see to his hygiene needs now.”
Missouri patted her arm. “You go do your Christmas shopping honey, it’s almost that time of year.” She sniffed the cold air. “It’s gonna snow, maybe we’ll have a white Christmas.”
“Yes, yes, of course.” A little reluctantly, he held the door for her. “Come and sit down. Er, do you want a drink. I’ve got tea, but I’ve run out of coffee, I’m afraid. I haven’t had time to get to the store.”
He faltered. “You don’t need to do that, I’m the one who started this whole mess.”
“I’m so bad at this, Gabe.”
“It’s a beautiful restoration.”
Castiel got to his feet, and stretched, before remembering his lack of clothing.
at least there was something to come out of this shit-fest.
Cas shrugs, and his father shakes his head as his mom makes her way to the hall, her gait just a little unsteady, the colour high on her cheeks.
“He might be a nurse, Bobby,” put in the younger blonde woman.
"Whoa there. As much as I like you, I can't really let you go without paying first. You know how it is with getting drunk and being forgetful…"
It’s a simple job, really. A vampire hunt in some nondescript seaside town in California. Cas and Dean walk along the docks, jackets slung over shoulders in the July heat.
The room is quiet, and yet still so damn loud. Dean can hear a fly buzzing near a window. It's almost enough to warrant Hair-Tearing.
Cas is jerked into consciousness abruptly, awakened once again to black nothingness.
Dean frowned at his brother. "Sam. Come on, man, what the hell is this."

Rufus eyes the paper with distaste, which quickly turns to disbelief, and his eyes flicker from Dean to the paper, eyebrows raised.

is his first thought. Silver, with enochian sigils carved into the outside. Simple. Perfect. And then Dean notices a slight blue glow lingering inside each glyph that looks suspiciously similar to an angel’s grace.
Yes, red is the color of pain.
Dean whispered, and the angel swallowed, the fear trailing down his throat, settling achingly deep somewhere inside his lungs.
"That means you, Cas," Sam hinted, and he began packing up his things for angelic transportation.
relationships as temporary as girlfriends or boyfriends, but then realized Dean was just joking, and it didn't matter anyway. He sighed, and began shuffling through a movie bin labeled 'Classic Westerns.'
