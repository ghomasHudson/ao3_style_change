“Cas, it hurts,” he whimpers and his head lolls onto Cas’ shoulder. Cas has no idea how Dean even knows it’s him, but hearing his name warms him through for a moment before he remembers that time is of the essence.
“Yeah, smartass, I see. So, what you’re saying is that we should get together because it’s convenient?”
“Eh, Dean, no offense, but I’m not really into horses. You know, up front they bite, in the back they kick, and in the middle they’re just plain uncomfortable.” He declined at first, but one look at Dean’s face told him exactly how sad he made him by saying no. “You know what? I want to meet them.”
“Maps and schematics for the water facility. It could be helpful in determining the most likely nest sites.”
“BECAUSE IT’S NOT THE SAME!”
“Prepare
“So which part of my question was confusing then?”
“That’s the plan,” Dean waggles his eyebrow. Cas chuckles in response, but it turns into a low moan when Dean’s hand dips further down on his body, low enough to find that he’s not wearing boxers under his robe either.
“Too much information, Dean.” Castiel silenced him by pressing two fingers onto his lips. “You should finish feeding the horses now, and I’m going to go and take a second look at that office I was talking about. I’m pretty sure it’s the one I want.”
“I will use less fuel then,” the angel countered and strode out of the diner without waiting for a reply.
He was so focused on the burning stable that at first he didn’t notice Alastair sneaking up on him from behind, and by the time he did, it was too late. He felt the tip of a blade between his vertebrae, the shotgun was taken from him, and he froze to the spot.
“That was nice.” Castiel said when they reached the stable.
Jody must sense the sudden shift in mood, because she says a hurried goodbye and hangs up before either man could react.
“Okay. Thanks for letting me know who he is.”
“And yet you signed up to come with me, I didn't even need to ask.”
“The killer was definitely a vampire,” Castiel announced after Dean finished demolishing his order of bacon cheeseburger and fries. “The victims were completely exsanguinated, both their throats torn apart.”
Cas can tell that Dean’s smirking and he twists around just enough to kiss the smug expression off of his face. They get tangled up in a long, sloppy make-out session that only ends because Dean trails both his hands down Cas’ open pants, letting them rest right on top of his erection without any further movement. Cas makes an indignant noise and gives a shallow thrust at the same time, just enough to get a little pressure right where he wants it. “Stop teasing,” he hisses, but he’s not really angry, just turned on, and this time Dean actually chuckles out loud then buries his face into Cas’s shoulder, dropping kisses onto his flushed skin while he’s there. Finally, he dips into Cas’ boxers and runs his fingertips over his erection with a feather-light touch, eliciting a shiver from Cas.
As time passes, both the frequency of Dean’s prayers and the intensity of the Shadow’s interest in Cas decrease, and yet, he’s still awake. It’s tiring, and he is reaching a point where he craves the eternal sleep the entity seems to have given up on entirely.
“Don’t worry, you will hear every prayer, because I want you to hear it all," the entity continues, and Cas doesn’t need to see the twisted smile it forced onto Dean’s likeness to know that it’s there.
“Exactly like the demigod. Or, more like exactly THE demigod.”
“And now he begins the story with Adam and Eve, just great,” he said, rolling his eyes, but Castiel silenced him.
“Dean, look at me,” Castiel interjected quietly. When Dean did so, Castiel cupped his face between his hands, and kissed him. “I am here. I was dead, my body was badly damaged, I drowned, and now I’m here, next to you. And I’m permanent. I’m staying. Isn’t that enough?” He said softly, his breath tickling Dean’s spit-slick mouth.
“Well, you’ve got a bump there, but not a big one. Can you remember what had happened?” She inquired while checking his pupils’ reactions with a small flashlight.
Dean lifts his hands to cradle Cas' face so he could pull him closer, until it's just right, until it's perfect, actually; and he deepens their kiss then swallows Cas' faint whimper before pulling away, resting his forehead against the angel's.
“What?”
“Meet Judas, the horse-in-a-poke. Chuck didn’t even see him before he saved his life, and bought him. He was abused before, and he was in a terrible shape when he first arrived here. By the way, he’s the one I was out with, when you drove past us.” Dean added, no edge in his voice. Still, Castiel felt the need to apologize once again, and he even patted Judas’s neck.
“We’ll check out the other half of the building some time later, now I need some sunlight. Can we go to the pond you mentioned earlier?”
“How typical of you, being completely unable to accept that someone might actually care about you!”
“Great. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go, and cook up a kick-ass entrance scene for Castiel’s alter ego.”
The angel lifted his head, tear-filled blue eyes widening as he realised what was going on. “Dean?” he asked tentatively while he got to his feet.
“You mean, you kicked your brother out of his home. Or, was there blackmail involved?” Cas teases.
“No sweat,” she said, starting to hum along to
“Morning, sunshine!” Dean smiles widely. “Coffee?”
They stopped to trade a few good-night, sleep-well, and see-you-tomorrow kisses, and then parted ways. After a hot shower Dean all but collapsed into his bed. He wished Castiel was there with him, but soon he fell asleep. He dreamt of Tyler, she was scared and screaming loudly, running from someone and there was a little red bicycle buried in sand… Dean woke up panting. With a desperate sigh he turned around, trying to erase the memory of the depressing dream. He hoped the little girl was okay, even though he felt deep down that she wasn’t. He managed to catch a couple more hours of sleep before his alarm beeped again, telling him to get ready for yet another day.
“Did he reply to the message I sent him earlier?”
“Yes. He was frantic when we got back and it took hours for him to calm down.”
“They become clichés because they work, and I happen to think morning-after cuddling works perfectly,” the angel shrugged, his hand wantonly inching lower, “but I can stop if you're bothered...”
“Not really, but I think I’d like to see a little more of the countryside.”
“Fine, I guess.” She answered with a shrug, then she took a good, long look at Castiel, and she started squealing, jumping around in one place.
Crystal was the fastest horse in the stable. That was partly the reason Dean loved her most among all his ‘kids’, as he usually referred to the horses; but not the only one. She seemed to be able to read one’s mind, and usually she didn’t even need controlling, she just knew where and how to go, so Dean could just lean back, and enjoy the ride. The first time he’d let the mare take over like that, they had ended up on a gorgeous field of flowers, where Dean had never been before, but since then it has become his favorite place. When Crystal reached the field, she slowed down without being instructed to, trotted right into the middle of the sea of flowers, and let her rider get off of her back. Dean took the bridle off, and while he lay down on the grass, she started eating, sometimes nuzzling Dean’s neck with her nose in the process.
“Hey. What’s up?” Dean sat down next to him. “Can’t sleep?”
Dean continues sipping his own drink, and Cas eventually drags himself into a half-upright position. They caffeinate themselves without words for a few minutes until Dean lets out a quiet snicker. “I think Dad would have an aneurysm if he saw me right now. In bed with a dude and a dog…okay, that sounded less nasty in my head,” he concludes with a grimace.
. Dean can't get enough of it, of him, and squeezes tighter, allowing the kiss to fall into incoordination, because suddenly its importance is only secondary to holding onto Cas. He buries his face into the crook of Cas' neck, nuzzling the column of it, and Cas tilts his head to give Dean space to settle in, which he does, possibly for good. He babbles soundless, unsayable words into the angel's throat; breathes in his scent; sneaks a taste of his warm skin, because he can. Cas' breath hitches under Dean's ministrations, and it continues to stutter while Dean pops the buttons of the angel's dress shirt open, one by one, eventually freeing him from the cloth altogether, dropping it on the floor.
“Oh, the beeping fudge beep it, I don’t care if it’s God himself driving that beeping car, I’m gonna hack him up into tiny little pieces and fertilize the front lawn with him!” Dean cursed, angrily shaking his fist at the driver of the car.
“Dean…” Castiel sighed, but Dean stopped him.
With the mug in his hands, he sat down on a chair, and looked out into the night. The full moon’s light was bright, almost day-like, so he could see the yard quite clearly. Something flashed white in the shadow of a huge oak tree, near a garden bench, and for a moment Dean contemplated grabbing his shotgun and checking it out. Then he saw that it was Castiel, sitting on the bench, with his legs pulled up under his chin. He looked miserable and lonely, and it broke Dean’s heart to see him like that. He downed the rest of his milk, and walked out of the house. The night air was chilly, and the grass was wet under his bare feet. He shivered, and or a moment he wished he had pulled on a sweatshirt and maybe even shoes before stepping out, but Castiel had already noticed him, looking up at him with sad blue eyes.
“Fuck this shit, I’m not just going to sit around here and wait till I’m roasted like a pig!” Dean announced suddenly, and disconnected. His cell began ringing almost immediately, but he ignored it. Not caring about possibly being trampled to death by panicked equines, he went to open the stalls, allowing the horses to get a little farther away from the flames. Suddenly, he had an idea. He gathered all the fire extinguishers, along with the thick blankets stored in the stable to keep the horses warm in case of an eventual heating problem. The horses were running around in circles, except Devil’s Advocate. He just stood there, looking at Dean with sad eyes.
“Jesus, Cas, what’s wrong?” Dean blinked, blindly groping for the bedside lamp in the dark. Soon a bright light flooded the room, and Dean saw that Castiel was still asleep, probably having the mother of all nightmares. He shook Castiel’s shoulder, trying to wake him up. “Hey, angel, wake up. C’mon, it’s just a nightmare, wake up!” He was starting to freak out when Castiel didn’t respond, but a few seconds later he jerked awake, and stared up at him. His eyes were full of unshed tears, pupils blown in terror, black taking up almost all the blue.
“And you don’t have anywhere else to be, right?” Castiel asked, and by then Dean could see clearly what Castiel was playing at, so he shook his head.
“You're something else, you know that, right?”
“No. Winchester, like the computer part,” Dean answered, rolling his eyes, and then he laughed at Castiel’s confused face. “You know, the hard drive? It’s called a winchester.”
“Turn around, angel.”
Cas looks taken aback for a moment, then he seems to gather himself. “Do you want to say it now?” He asks, blue eyes wide and bright as he fixes them on Dean's. “I love you.” His voice carries the same warm, earnest determination it did... then, and for a moment Dean can almost hear the squelch of the Empty behind him, until the staccato beat of his wildly thumping heart reaches its loudest, trying to physically fit itself into Cas' palm which by now is resting right above it.
“You’re lonely, he’s lonely… you deserve a nice guy, he deserves a nice guy… you’re a nice guy, he’s a nice guy…. see what I’m doing there?”
“You scared the ever-living crap out of me!” She turned to face Chuck, and plunged her pointer finger into his chest.
“Oh, come on Scri. That is the very same fodder you got yesterday, and you ate it then. What’s wrong now?” He asked, playing with the pony’s mane.
“Yes?”
Castiel stared at him, blue eyes keeping Dean’s green ones captive, until they wandered down to the human’s mouth just for a fraction of a second, which was enough for those mile-like inches to halve themselves, and their noses brushed, then, suddenly lips were on lips, not moving, not asking or taking, just touching. Neither dared to deepen the contact, but equally, neither dared to break it. Then, Dean’s eyes fluttered closed, and he went for it, pressing closer, mouth sliding against Cas’, which seemed to awaken something in Cas, and he imitated the chaste, closed-mouthed kiss once, twice… Eventually, he lifted his hands and rested them on Dean’s jaw, cradling his face, while Dean’s fingers wound themselves around Cas’ lapels, softly pulling at them, coaxing the angel to follow him as he fell back against the pillow, continuing to trade butterfly-light kisses, catch, hold, release...
“They will be back soon, I can sense them.”
Dean shrugged and moved to the bathroom to get ready for the day.
?” Dean shot back.
“Thanks, I think I can safely say that we’re happy for ourselves too,” he said with a smile, and when Becky didn’t say anything else, he started walking towards the house. Once in his room, he changed clothes and drove into the town. The office he was planning on renting was actually more like a three room apartment on the ground floor of an old house, but it was nice and sunny, situated in a well-kept, but not too posh neighborhood, and before he knew it, he had the keys of his new office dangling from his keychain. Happily whistling he set off towards the nearest IKEA, intent on buying the necessary furniture. The store was almost at the edge of the town, halfway in the countryside already, and on his way there he passed a bar named HallowInn, which looked like a saloon straight out of a western. Wooden panels were covering the walls, and it even had a horse post. He made a mental note to google it once he got back to the Shurley Estate, because he was sure Dean would like it, but only if the place was decent.
“Hey, boy, calm down, it’s just a car, nothing to be scared of. You’ve seen things like that, my baby is louder and bigger than that one, and you’re not scared of her, are you?” Dean bent down onto Judas’ neck, whispering into his ear. For a moment the horse seemed to calm a little, but as the car got nearer, he reared up onto his hind legs, kicked out with the front left one, and all Dean could do was to shield himself from the fall. As soon as he hit the ground, he rolled over on his shoulder, this way he managed to get out from under Judas’ hooves. He felt blood trickling down his back, but he was more worried about the horse, which kept rearing and prancing in panic. At least Judas was scared enough not to run away, Dean thought, but that didn’t help much. He still couldn’t get near enough to calm him down, and the car was getting nearer and nearer, until it finally hurtled past them with a loud screech of its tires on the gravel, tossing the horse into another fit of panicking.
“Yeah, I know, and I will. If you want to talk about that project of yours, now is the time,” he grinned, and this time Sam actually started talking about it.
“Then go, and ask Castiel out for a date,” Becky said, pointing in the general direction of the guest room Castiel was staying in.
“Bobby said you and Jack erased the borders and my parents were nearby… ” Dean shrugs again, and he seems so intent on convincing himself he would have been okay with having such an eternity that Cas almost believes him. Almost.
“No, you cooked, I’ll do the washing up,” Castiel said, and it was evident from his voice that he wasn’t taking no for answer.
“No. I didn’t. Holy mother of all.”
“Dean, in case you didn’t notice, I have a huge beast between my legs and…” Castiel began to complain, but then he realized what he just said, and blushed. Dean chuckled, and stopped Gigette.
“Does he like it?”
“I don’t need babysitting,” Dean hissed, but he felt his anger evaporating.
“Earth to Castiel, hello? Los Angeles, you got your ears on?”
“I know. Jack has already mojoed the car home, he'll be back for us.”
“Oh, you’ll see, and you’ll like it. Now come on, let’s get some food, and then we can sit. We have to wait quite a bit for the magic to happen, but at least we’ll be able to watch it from good seats,” Chuck rambled.
“A rare moment of self-critique, wow. There may be hope for you still,” Sam teased.
“If you show me how, I can help you with that too,” he offered.
“You do that,” Dean muttered, and he began pushing the wheelbarrow toward the side exit leading to the compost heap. “Hey, Chuck?” He called after his boss.
“It’s two words,” Cas shoots back, and Dean groans once again. The heavy moment passes, and a few seconds later Dean surges forward to kiss Cas forcefully enough that his elbows give way and he falls back against the mattress. Without missing a beat, Dean moves to loom over him with a predatory grin and runs a hand down to Cas’ groin, skirting past his hard cock with a pointed raise of his eyebrows. Cas huffs, but Dean silences him by pushing his thighs apart and dipping his searching fingers into the space behind his balls, pressing against his taint.
“Cas, it’s your choice, and his. I’ll text you his number, and then you can talk with him about it.”
“I should tell him I’m sorry for threatening him.”
Sam’s head whips towards Cas, looking at him questioningly. “I thought Jack said he healed him?”
“Gimme your hand,” Dean instructs, and Cas attempts to move the hand which is still wound around Dean’s neck, but Dean pushes it back. “I like that one where it is. Gimme the other one.”
because I have the wrong parts for some of it, but that’s the general idea.”
“Okay, we’ll go then. By the way, you were great with Gigette today. Not everyone could have done what you did. Learning to steer a horse is usually hard enough on a practice track, and you had to do it on the field,” Dean said, and he patted Castiel’s back approvingly.
“Would you feel any safer if I sit behind you for a while?” Dean asked. He was sure that he wouldn’t make this offer to anyone else, but he just couldn’t stand the scared look Castiel had on his face the whole time. For a second he contemplated telling him to get off the horse and leave it be, but somehow he was sure Castiel would love riding if he knew how to.
“I think Becky knew from the beginning that eventually we would get together. When we had that barbecue dinner, she told me to ask you out.”
They ended up making love on the bedroom floor, with only Castiel's trenchcoat underneath Dean as the angel rode him. They rocked together in slow, sensual synchronicity, hands entwined and Castiel's wings still present, sheltering them from the outside world as much as they could.
“It’s perfect,” Dean nodded, and he lifted his hand to stare at the engagement ring gracing it. “Cas, just tell me one thing. How exactly did you manage to make me do something as chick-flicky as proposing to you?” he grinned.
“Call me a sap again, and you can wait till Judgment Day for the next breakfast in bed, made by me.” Dean grinned, and he reached out to take Castiel’s hand into his. “I hope the size is right. I wouldn’t want to exchange this one,” he muttered as he opened the small bag, fishing the ring out. It was a simple white gold ring, but with two tiny angel wings engraved into it. Dean took Castiel’s left hand, and pushed the ring onto his finger with a bright smile. It fit perfectly, and it looked great on Castiel’s long finger.
“Well, it’s true.”
“Yes, they did.”
“Sure thing, just give me a mo',” she smiled and went to deliver the pie to whomever ordered it.
After he was let go, Dean stood rooted to the ground for almost a minute, before he could move again.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel smiled, and captured his lover’s lips in a gentle kiss. That small touch alone was enough to make his blood boil, and suddenly the idea of going out didn’t seem that alluring, but when they parted, he noticed how excited Dean looked.
“It’s nice of you to fix it, but shouldn’t you be more careful with your powers?”
“Families, man,” Dean shook his head, turning his back on Cas while he prepared the equipment and the stencil. “Okay, I have everything ready. You want it on your flank, right?”
“She certainly has a mouth on her. I think, it if wasn’t for you, I would really like her,” Dean teased when he plopped down next to Castiel. Everyone was occupied with the smoking remains of the stable, like the firefighters, or was in shock because of the smoking remains of the stable, like Chuck and Becky, so no one had noticed Castiel yet. Dean had gathered the horses together, made sure that they were all okay, and only then did he go back to Castiel.
After he filled his empty stomach, Dean leaned his back against his pillows, and he almost immediately started blinking drowsily. After a week spent not-quite-like-sleep unconsciousness an hour of being awake was enough to wear Dean down, and even though he didn’t really want to sleep so soon after waking up, he had no choice. Sam helped his brother back under the covers, and when he made sure that Dean was comfortably wrapped up in his blanket, he turned around to leave.
“Finally, you're back!”
“I know… I’ll think a little more about this. Hey, do you want to help me clean up? Becky would appreciate if I did it for her.”
“Hey, guys, have we ever told you about how we met?” Becky asked all of a sudden, and Chuck groaned.
“Why do you even care about my state?” Cas straightens his back but remains seated where he crumbled to the floor. Jack’s standing over the Shadow’s shoulder, and for some reason, there is a half-smile on his face.
“Oh, okay,” Castiel nodded, and claimed his lover’s mouth in a chaste kiss. After they parted, Dean threw back the covers, intent on getting out of bed, but Castiel stopped him. “Dean, it’s raining.”
.” The wide, bright smile Dean got in reply affected him way too much for it to be part of what should by all means be a standard business transaction between tattoo artist and client, but he didn’t feel like prodding the issue too much.
“Becky, are you okay?” Castiel asked, obviously a little worried about the girl’s mental health.
“Are you ticklish anywhere else? I just feel like I should know about it.”
“I did, but I still feel a little bad about it. I was thinking, maybe we could go out for a few drinks tonight. My treat, so I can make up to you for the ruined night.”
It could be five minutes, five hours or even five days later when Cas returns to consciousness, finding himself face-to-face with the Shadow.
“It will take me, but not until I am truly happy – so happy that I forget about the deal.” It was finally out in the open, so why wasn't he feeling any better?
“Molested you? MOLESTED YOU? Okay, I may have molested you,” Dean admitted sleepily, and he pulled out an extra blanket from under his pillows, covering them both with it. With a small sigh he curled up against Castiel’s side, and closed his eyes. Castiel began caressing his lover’s hair, and when Dean’s breathing evened out, he shifted slightly so he could bury his face into the pillows, and fell asleep.
It took them the whole day to sweep the area, and they didn’t find anything. The other search parties weren’t any luckier either. There was no sign of Tyler anywhere, it seemed like she just dropped off of the face of the Earth. Becky was devastated by the news, or rather by the lack of news.
“I’m pretty sure I already won our little bet,” the girl announced after some thinking.
“What now? They’re comfy,” Castiel shrugged.
“Dean, you okay?” Sam asked, worry evident in his voice.
“Something you're not ready for yet.”
“Love you, too,” he replies quietly, sneaking a hand under Cas’ robe to roam all over his bare chest before Cas stops him.
“Yes, you do, you bastard.” Any potential attempt on Dean’s part to sound menacing or angry is thwarted when the sentence ends in a jaw-cracking yawn, and he burrows further into the pillows. “Alright. Both of you, get out. I need my four hours and I can’t get them with you two stooges staring.” Sam opens his mouth but Dean silences him with a lifted index finger. “Whatever you were about to say there will have to wait, Sammy. Okay?” Dean’s voice softens, and Cas watches the brotherly exchange that seems to be happening entirely with their eyes. It ends with Sam acquiescing and he stands up to leave. Cas doesn’t.
“They cut off my wings…” He joked with a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes, and in that moment Dean desperately wanted to repeatedly kick himself for being stupid enough to ask about them.
When he wakes, nothing hurts but it doesn't feel real. He's back in the Bunker, under the covers on his memory foam mattress.
Castiel sighed and dropped his gaze. “It barely took any effort. I have a perfect understanding of my limits, which means I will continue to use my grace when and as I see fit, and I’d prefer if you trusted my judgement.” He hoped his voice carried more conviction than what he felt; and looking at Dean, it did.
Before giving himself over to the afterglow, Cas makes sure to unsnap Dean’s wrist bindings and helps him to lower his arms, gently rubbing them.
“I love you too.”
He attempts to groan and he thinks he’s succeeded because the squeeze goes lighter but the voice grows more frantic, repeating his name and the words “wake up” over and over. It takes some time for him to gain control, and when he does, he forces his eyes open. Jack’s there, and it’s unmistakably his son but not quite. There’s the thrum of unfamiliar power surrounding him, and Cas’ stomach sinks.
“What could a little girl like Tyler have done to deserve something like this? What did Susan Thompson do to deserve losing her daughter like that? Or Becky? How is that fair?” He yelled, and slammed the saddle down so hard Dean was sure something snapped in it.
“Oh, fuck. That’s a pleasant image. For the record, I’m officially regretting any decision I made in the last minute or so,” Dean grumbles as he sits up and reaches towards his nightstand, from where he produces a pack of wet wipes, chucking a few of them onto Cas’ stomach with a thunk. “Gotta get clean, things are gonna get nasty otherwise,” he adds as he disposes of the used condom then cleans himself up. Now that they’re fully parted, Cas notes a hint of awkwardness in Dean’s tone, but as soon as they’re both semen-free, he plops right back into bed, halfway on top of him, curling into his side without any obvious hesitation. With a smile, Cas wraps an arm around him and presses a quick kiss into his damp hair. Dean shuffles a little before settling, and Cas tilts his head to stare at his beautiful face. His eyes are a sparkling emerald green this time; cheeks still pink with the flush of sex, and it makes his freckles stand out more than usual. Cas can’t help but murmur a barely-audible “I love you” into a forehead kiss, and Dean smiles a soft but radiant smile in response.
“You have to let me know the moment you’re uncomfortable.”
“No, I’m sure it’s not,” Sam concedes and takes a deep breath as he goes pale, tears welling up in his eyes that are firmly fixed on the limp form of his brother. “I nearly lost him. He was ready to go and I told him it was okay, why did I tell him that, it would not have been okay!” Sam’s voice goes more and more high-pitched as he continues, and even with his limited understanding of human emotional responses Cas recognises the beginning of a panic attack. He looks at his best friend - because truly, Sam is that, his best friend; Dean’s always been more than that -, and he tries to find the best words to say. Eventually, he settles on “Sounds like you told him what he wanted to hear. You’re a caring brother,” and it seems to ease Sam’s distress a little.
it is. So, what’s your plan?”
“I didn't want to burden you.”
“Okay, eggs it is then. But… you know, you should get off of me so I can go and actually make them for you, hm?”
“Sorry. How’s Dean? Did you find him?”
“Someone who kidnaps kids can’t possibly be sane anyway,” Dean remarked. “So it’s definitely a he?”
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
The moment the photo appeared on the screen, Dean stopped paying attention to the reporter, focusing on the picture instead. It showed a man in a rundown, dark room, in front of a dirty wall, tied to a chair in ripped clothes. One of his kidnappers was holding his head up, with his hand fisted in his victim’s hair. The lawyer was bloody and brutally beaten: lips split, face all bruised, one of his eyes was so swollen it wouldn’t even open, his left arm obviously broken, but that wasn’t what shocked Dean right to his core. It was the amount of pain, desperation and death wish in the man’s huge blue eyes that did the job. Shivering, Dean turned the TV off, and lay down, pulling his covers over his head.
When he was done with the dishes, he went up to Dean’s room to get his clothes. After some thinking, he took one of Dean’s shirts and put it on. With his clothes in his hand, he walked out of the house.
“I was just trying to let you know that it’s almost time to feed the horses, but you weren’t answering.”
“Dean,” Castiel greeted him, his bright blue eyes lighting up. “I am truly sorry I had to leave on such a short notice earlier. My brother Balthazar and I always talk on the phone at the same time, every day, and I was late for that time.” Of course, that wasn’t necessarily true, even though he did in fact talk to Balthazar after his hasty escape, but it wasn’t like he could just go and confess how disappointed he felt over Dean apparently being heterosexual.
“We all have those days,” Dean shrugged nonchalantly, walking around the reception desk. “And, who do we have here?” he smiled, leaning down to the child.
“You know close my house is to the stable. I can hear almost every noise the horses make, and believe me, they make lot of it after I turn off the lights and go to bed. Diamond usually starts playing around with his automatic water trough at that time, Maniac always lays down to sleep, and she keeps kicking the wall rather loudly with her left hind leg in her dream, it’s like a reflex or something… Mirage turns around approximately fifty times before finally laying down to sleep, and with every turn he hits the door with his butt. Beau usually whickers for a while, und urges the others to do it too… I consider those little noises to be their way of saying goodnight. So, I can’t sleep when there’s no noise, because I always start worrying about the kids, no matter if I am not even at home,” Dean said with a wide yawn at the end.
“That’s an unusual story, but nice. Maybe someday I will have a story like that on my own.” Castiel said, looking straight at his hands that lay folded in his lap.
Stopping in the doorway, Dean rubs his eyes, the corners of his mouth quirking up into a grin as he takes in the sight in the middle of the room - and it is a
He didn’t have too much time to think about Castiel during the morning, his routine kept both his body and his mind occupied. Somehow everything went slower, everything took more time than usual, so by the time he finished with cleaning the stable, it was almost one in the afternoon, time for his daily phone calls with Sam. Halfway to his house he already heard his landline phone ringing, which surprised him. He reached into his pocket to check his cell phone, and that was when he realized he had turned it off, so it wouldn’t by any chance ring while he was giving Castiel the stable-tour, and he had forgotten to turn it back on after it.
After they got back, Dean scrubbed Crystal down, and let her in to play with the others. He watched the ‘kids’ for a while, then he remembered that maybe he should do something constructive too, and went to clean out the stalls. On his way in he saw Chuck’s cat, a huge, gray – and in Dean’s honest opinion fugly – thing, that was just trying to hunt down a weirdly silvery mouse. At first it seemed like the little rodent could escape, but it ran out of luck, and ended up in the cat’s claws.
“Oh, come on, you weren’t supposed to be here yet,” he grumbled as he walked up the stairs. He came to a halt, and he smiled down at his sleeping lover. Castiel was laying sprawled on the porch swing, one of his feet dangling in the air at the end of it. The book he’d been reading was on the floor, completely forgotten, but his huge, black-rimmed reading glasses were still sitting on his nose. Dean almost reached out to wake him, but stopped himself before his hand came in contact with Castiel’s skin. Instead of poking him, first he pocketed his glasses, and then carefully he took him in his arms, lifting him off the swing.
“Now I’m gonna teach you how to sit on a horse, ‘cause what you’re doing now is about as enthralling and right, as a drunk man’s sprawl on a bar stool. First of all, sit straight. You’re not the Hunchback of Notre Dame, are you? Then don’t sit like you were, you’re too good-looking to be Quasimodo anyway,” he grinned, and Castiel immediately straightened his spine. “Okay, that looks better, but if you can, try to push your shoulders back a little too. That’s it. The only way you can actually stay on the horse is if you hold on with your legs… well, your thighs and knees, to be exact. Wait, it looks like the stirrup is way too low for you, let me just quickly adjust that,” he said, and without thinking, he grabbed Castiel’s ankle, pulling his foot out of the stirrup. “Pull up your leg a little, please.”
“Is part of that story that you were named after an angel?”
It wasn’t easy to come up with a believable story about Castiel’s return, but in the end they used the good old “temporary amnesia” card, and it worked. Or maybe everyone just happy to have him back, and didn’t care about reasons or circumstances…
“If you want to… Key’s in the lock, could you please bring it to me when you’re done?”
“I love you,” he whispers. The words are like a weight off his chest he didn’t know was there, and Cas’ wide, bright, beaming smile puts something warm like summer sunlight in their place.
“Like… that,” Dean lets out a long-suffering sigh.
“Hello, son,” he replies, then pushes Jack to an arm’s length of distance away to take a better look at him. He doesn’t need his grace to see that something has changed. “What happened?”
“Not necessarily the word I’d use,” Dean answered, and he had to bite his tongue to keep himself from telling Castiel how non-ridiculous he actually looked. “Come on, let’s get you onto Gigette’s back.” That seemed to push Castiel over his distress caused by the helmet, and he smiled at Dean.
“Yes, but he hasn’t had a case on his own yet. He’s working for the same firm you used to.”
Eventually, he called out. “Cas!”
“Jody tried to walk me through it over the phone. Dry ingredients are in that bowl, the yeast is in that one. And that one…” Cas grimaces, and Dean can’t help but laugh at the sight of his expression.
“We could, but we won't, unless you promise me that you will not rush into anything headfirst tonight,” Castiel replied sternly.
“Not here,” Dean growled, and he began pushing Castiel towards the stairs leading to his bedroom. Trying to walk without having to part was nearly impossible though, and after a while Dean ran out of patience. With a small, annoyed huff he picked Castiel up, and carried him up the stairs. “Don’t get used to this,” he added as an afterthought, and bit down on Castiel’s neck a little harder than necessary. He sat down onto his bed, with his lover in his lap. Slowly, he slipped his hands under Castiel’s shirt, craving more skin contact. They began moving together, following the quickening beat of their hearts. The kisses were becoming longer and longer, moans breathier, gasps louder as they rocked their hips together. The scent of Castiel was driving Dean crazy with lust and want. Eagerly, he pulled Castiel’s shirt off, and with one hand he caressed his lover’s chest while the other slowly inched its way towards his ass.
They stopped a few feet from the gate. It was closed, a massive padlock holding a thick chain in place, and there was a strip of virulent, waist-height weeds right in front of it. The whole thing looked like it hadn't been disturbed in years, and the conclusion was instantaneous.
“Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.” Bobby began.
“I've been advised by a reliable source that it's weird to watch people as they sleep.”
“Yeah, me too.” Chuck mumbled, pulling Becky onto his lap. “Dean, I haven’t seen you this focused on anyone, ever. And I think he likes you too. You should try and give it a chance.”
“The Roadrunner? No? Okay then,” Dean shrugged.
“I… I understand,” Dean said, and he went back into his room, with Castiel’s trenchcoat clutched tightly to his chest.
“You’re welcome. I’m sorry I haven’t talked about him earlier, I just didn’t think about you and him ever meeting, you know?” Becky smiled apologetically, and she stood up to leave.
“Just some quick reconnaissance. I mean it.”
When Becky spotted them, she began running towards them, and Chuck stood up to welcome his overeager girlfriend in a tight hug.
“Sorry, Dean,” Castiel smiled, settling down next to him, close enough to kiss, so he did, initiating for the first time. “I've wanted to do this for so long now,” he admitted in a whisper, caressing Dean's face with feather-light touches.
“You mean when you beat me to a pulp?” Dean's eyes went wide, obvious even in the dim light. “That was an epiphany for you?” He sat up, heart suddenly racing for a completely different reason.
“I'd rather not waste any of it. You know everything tastes like molecules to me,” Castiel shook his head and focused on twirling the utensil.
Castiel smiled, and kissed Dean again, licking his way into the other man’s mouth. The kisses were making them both a little dizzy because of the lack of air, yet they dived back for more and more, giving and taking, asking and granting. Every kiss felt a little bit better than the one before, yet soon they just weren’t enough. Dean shifted, and pulled Castiel into his lap, so that the other man was straddling his hips. Slowly he let his hand slide down his back, following the elegant curve of his spine. Castiel’s skin was hot even through the fabric of his t-shirt, and Dean wanted to feel, to touch without that cotton barrier, but when he tried slipping his hand under Castiel’s shirt, he was stopped.
They arrived at the old wash-house half an hour later, with torches and flashlights in their hands. Castiel eyed the half-rock, half-wood building with obvious distrust. It was indeed creepy, but as Dean said, it was also exciting at the same time. The wash-house was ramshackle, dark, and it reeked of sulfur.
“Dean?”
“Yes, Dean. I want you in me,” he repeats with a strong emphasis on the word ‘in’, and Dean nods in response.
“Winchester, like the gun?” Castiel asked, trying to stifle his grin, with not much success though. He enjoyed that for once he was able to ask a stupid question about the other person’s name too.
“You would do well to remember I was a strategist in Heaven. Something is not adding up, and it could mean the difference between a simple hunt and a suicide mission.”
“I know you didn’t, Dean, and there’s nothing to be sorry for. It’s part of my life, albeit a dark one, but I don’t want you to feel like you have to tiptoe around me, not even about that particular subject, okay?” Castiel said, and when Dean nodded, he pulled his head down to kiss him. “I’m not really sure how I got those scars, but I think it was when I was pushed onto the glass table in my living room. To be honest, I don’t think I want to know,” he continued when they parted, “I am grateful that those two scars are the only physical reminders of my kidnapping. At least I don’t have to see them every day. It’s not easy to deal with something like that.”
“We can’t keep doing this until the end of time,” he announced a moment later, trying to extricate himself from halfway underneath Dean.
“Okay, maybe I was. But your goo-goo eyes weren’t that subtle either!” Castiel retorted.
Sam walked his girlfriend to her car, and on the way back to Dean’s room he bought some food for his brother. Dean’s eyes lit up as he saw the ham-cheese sandwiches and the bottle of orange juice, and before he could think about quick movements after a week spent in coma, he got out of bed to grab the food. The dizziness came, and swept him off his feet in a heartbeat. Luckily the bed was still near, so he could lean back against it.
Jealousy filled Dean’s veins when he saw Jo pawing at Castiel, but he knew he had no right to be jealous, because he was too big of a coward to ask Castiel out and risk an eventual rejection, which meant that Castiel was free to let whoever he wanted to touch him. He forced a smile onto his face, and walked back to the table. His breathing got a little easier, when he saw Castiel gazing up at him like a drowning man at the last straw.
“You won’t be this cheery once we actually start with it.” Dean shook his head, but Castiel’s apparent enthusiasm was starting to have an effect on him too. “Boring work needs good tunes.” He grinned, pulled out his phone, and after some fiddling with it music filled the storage room.
“Maybe you fucking should’ve!”
“Well, Becky, not for nothing, but you tend be kind of scary sometimes,” Castiel interjected.
“You. Love. Me,” Castiel’s voice is rough as he says it, punctuating every word with a roll of his hips against Dean’s.
“I just want to ask you something, I’ll be there in a sec,” Chuck answered. He walked up to the door of the stall the other man was working in. “So, I know you hate it when I bother you with my novel…” he began, but Dean cut him short.
“Are you okay?”
“Working on what?”
Suddenly, the sensation of Cas disappears and Dean panics, eyes flying back open in terror until they settle on Cas standing still above him, intense gaze fixed on him. Cas is trembling, and if Dean thought having the wrath of God on him was intense, he had another thing coming in the love of an angel.
“You’re not the same as you were the last time,” it says, circling Jack like a vulture, obviously sizing him up.
Cas instinctively bristles at both the words and the patronising tone, but before he can say anything, all-encompassing pain rushes through him and he blacks out.
“Sorry…” Dean repeated, and he looked at his watch. “Damn, you’re right. I have to go and change. Just leave everything, I’ll clean it later.”
“If that’s what you want,” Cas chuckles darkly. “I will untie your legs, and you will wrap them around my waist, alright my love?”
After some thinking Dean pushed himself a little closer to Castiel on the bench. His heart was literally beating in his throat, drumming an agitated staccato. The other man’s closeness hypnotized him, he desperately wanted to close the distance between them, but he wasn’t sure it would be a good idea. So instead of doing that, he moved his fingers, brushing them against Castiel’s hand. He hoped that it looked as unintentional, as he wanted it to, but apparently it didn’t. Castiel entwined their fingers without as much as a second thought, and Dean was sure: from that time on, he would never have to fake anything just to be able to touch Castiel. He turned towards him, reached out and gently caressed Castiel’s stubbled jaw. The other man closed his eyes for a moment, leaning into the touch, and then pressed his mouth against Dean’s, his tongue begging for entrance. Dean’s lips parted, granting access, and Castiel immediately deepened the kiss. They still held hands, not letting go of each other for a second. Dean pulled Castiel closer and closer, until their chests were barely an inch away. He lifted their joined hands and placed it over Castiel’s heart, before burying his other hand into his hair, playing with the dark, silky locks. The kiss lasted for what seemed like an eternity, and when they parted, they both were gasping for air.
“Thanks a lot for the vote of confidence. I am so happy to have you on my side,” she answered, sticking her tongue out.
Dean and Castiel waited until the police bagged up all the evidence they could scour up.
“Am I too forward if I admit that I kinda want you to be forward?”
“Bossy,” Dean chuckles as he rubs both nubs into hard peaks then flicks them lazily, making Cas tremble. “Didn’t think it would be this easy to rile you up. What else do you like this much, Cas? Tell me.”
“She’s fine, considering. She has quite a few cuts and bruises, and she’s traumatized, but other than that, she’s okay. They have no idea how she got away, because what she said can’t possibly be true.”
Cas and Sam finally manage to get the still unresponsive Dean under the covers, and almost as if they reached an unspoken agreement, Sam settles into the chair next to the bed at the same time as Cas sits down on the gray-green couch. It’s a little further away than he would prefer, but he cannot find the strength to drag it closer, and he doesn’t want to crowd Dean by sitting on the edge of the bed.
“She does, doesn’t she?” Dean felt his smile grow wider and wider. “Now try sliding your hand up on her muzzle. If she lets you touch her between her eyes, you’re good to go. Horses have a blind spot in front of their foreheads, which means, they can’t see if something is there or not. They don’t see your hand under their noses either, but they can smell you, so they know you’re there,” he explained, but he wasn’t sure Castiel actually heard any of that, he was too busy caressing Gigette’s forehead and nose. She whickered, and pushed her head into the touch, making Castiel smile.
gonna regret asking this. Is it?”
“I’m having just the right amount of fun, thank you for your concern though. I am only alone for the moment, just until Dean gets back with his food.” Castiel answered reservedly, but Jo seemed not to notice his formality, because she actually tried to kick her flirting up a notch, and ran her hand over Castiel’s arm.
“That’s not what this is about.”
“Better?” Dean inquired. His mouth was so close to Castiel’s ear that his breath tickled him, making him shiver a little.
“By which action, you changed things,” Cas points out while he refills his mug.
Dean was walking around in circles in front of the stables. He wasn’t sure what his sudden need to have Castiel near was, but if he was honest to himself, he had to admit that he enjoyed the other man’s company, even though they’d barely spent any time together. When he saw Castiel walking towards him, his heart actually skipped a beat. Flip-flops or not, he looked great in his blue flannel button-down shirt and worn out jeans.
“I’m here,” he rasped, and tilted his head to provide better access for his lover. Searching for more contact, he pushed his hips forward, and when they met resistance, he started moving, rubbing his body against Dean’s. After a while it got to be both too much and not enough, so he wrapped his leg around Dean’s waist, trying to get more sweet friction. They were too wrapped up in each other to notice Chuck, who had just entered the stable.
“So greedy,” Cas smiles, carefully stretching his wings so that the feathers caress Dean’s whole chest at the same time. The room is not quite big enough for his full span, but he’s not about to let that hold him back. Lazily, he sweeps the air, alternating teasing feather-flicks with pressure, playfully inching lower and lower until the only noise Dean seems to be able to make are groans of pleasure interspersed with breathless gasps as he twists and writhes whenever Cas’ wing touches his erection through the panties.
“It’s usually like that. This is a popular event, I’d even go as far as to say the most popular one in this neighborhood, and soon you’ll get to see why. Dean hasn’t filled you in, has he?”
“We’re in the kitchen, Dean.”
“I love you,” Dean said, hands buried deep into Castiel’s hair, stroking the wet dark locks.
“Good,” Jack beamed, sternness forgotten. “Cas, I know it's not really my business, but... you and Dean, it's something different, isn't it?”
“What are you talking about, man?”
“When I heard you d-dying,” Cas falters and he gulps twice in quick succession, “I knew I had to fight my way back.”
“Yes. While I don’t think anything is gonna go wrong with you and Gigette, better safe than sorry. So, put it on.”
“Okay, now I’m really intrigued.”
“We all make mistakes.” Cas knows it’s a weak argument, but he doesn’t have a better one at hand.
“By all means, proceed, Castiel,” Dean's voice dropped low as he leaned back onto the pillow, and his lips parted slightly in anticipation. The angel wasted no time, propping himself up on his elbow right above Dean and leaning in, the tip of his tongue tracing Dean's lips before diving in earnestly, and it was so much better than anything he'd had before. It was intoxicating and maddening. A shudder ran through both of them at the same time, and it left them breathless.
“That doesn’t sound too good. Dean, please don’t be mad at me, but while that really does sound bad, you’re not really a person who feels bad enough about something like that to actually tell me about it, unless… Unless you feel like you hurt someone you like,” Sam said. In that second Dean began to curse the moment he let his baby brother get such an accurate profile of him.
“Jack, no!” Cas interjects.
“That was then. Now… it is now,” Castiel said, and Dean couldn’t argue with that logic. Instead of that he leaned forward.
“Dean,” he begins. Selfishly, he wants to push Dean into a conversation, or at least into being allowed to stay and watch over him as he sleeps, but his face is haggard with exhaustion, and Cas gives up before he’s even really started. “Get some rest. We’ll talk after.”
“We need to research, Dean, not waste time on simple hunts someone else could handle. We are up against God here, and we have no idea what Billie's plan is to neutralize him. We don't know how she wants to use Jack – don't tell me that doesn't make you uncomfortable!”
“So, waffles,” Cas begins with a vague motion of his hand towards the counter.
“The sky?” Castiel deadpanned, and Dean looked at him questioningly.
“I haven’t even seen this place before,” Dean said, and quickly he got off of Crystal’s back. “I have been living in this town for more than a decade now, and I’ve never been here. How did you find this?”
“No, I don’t,” Dean agrees and pulls Cas into a slow, indulgent kiss, all love, no heat. He gets to have this now - Chuck’s gone, the Empty deal was, well,
“Good morning, Vietnam,” the entity sneers, and it morphs from Kelly’s form into that of Naomi’s vessel. Cas assumes it’s to impersonate the angel though, and when it speaks again, his assumption is proven correct. “You know, the stench of what you’ve allowed yourself to turn into lingers.”
“So not the point,” Dean shot back, displeased.
“Look at them, Chuck. They are a couple. They just… haven’t realized it yet.”
“Old?” Castiel repeated. “You?”
“Cas, don't freak out. Close your eyes and take a deep breath, or whatever else you angels do when you're about to have a meltdown.”
“C’mon, Dean. You are actually a sap, so why do you try to hide that?” Castiel teased, and received a glare as an answer.
“And I offered to go with the entity right there and then if it left Jack alone.” Castiel was painfully aware that dragging out the confession was cowardly, yet he waited for Dean to prompt him again, like moves in a game of chess.
“Dean, sometimes I think you’re way too good with words to be a simple horse trainer/stable boy. I’m not suggesting that it’s convenient, I’m suggesting that maybe there’s more between you and him than simple friendship, or whatever the hell it is you think you have.”
“I think so, yeah. Why are you asking?”
“My love,” Dean echoes, barely a hint of a question in it, then fixes his mouth to Cas' for a lazy, drawn-out kiss. He fights the exhaustion creeping up on him as long as he can, but it wins out in the end, and Dean lets himself be pulled down on top of Cas, curling up into him in the process.
“That was unfortunate,” Castiel remarked.
“You mean, worth the hell of a cold we’re going to get after this?”
“Yes, I do. Let him finish,” Castiel said, and he pulled his lover closer.
“Jack –” the angel sighed.
“It is indeed beautiful.” Castiel agreed, admiring the careful handiwork on the weapon. He was strangely enchanted by the atmosphere of the Bone Chamber. He tried to imagine the life story of the people bound to rest in that weird cemetery, different scenarios playing in his head. The last flicker of his torch snapped him out of his reverie.
As the days got shorter, and the weather colder, the horses could spend less and less time in the pen, which meant that Dean’s workdays were shortening too. Ben didn’t need a teacher anymore, and Tyler’s horse therapy was going well too. Slowly but surely she was able to get through the aftereffects of her kidnapping, though Dean had to admit that in her case Castiel was a much bigger help than him, or the horses.
“It can be,” Dean grins, already scrambling for his laptop. “Let me show you something.”
“I don’t know Cas, I don’t know. But I don’t think anyone cares about it not being fair. If someone did, it wouldn’t have happened,” he said softly, pulling Castiel close and wrapping his arms around his waist.
“Dean.”
“Yeah, I guess I am. So, do you want to go on a date with me?”
“Thank you, Castiel,” Loki nodded, and continued, fixing his stare on Dean. “By any chance, do you remember saving a mouse, who then told you to be careful what you wish for, because it may come true?”
“Chuck, what is he doing?” Becky asked worriedly, trying to peek through the half-opened door and over her boyfriend’s shoulder.
Sam goes to bed after that, and Cas knows he should do so too, but he’s too agitated to settle, so he takes the liberty of making himself a coffee.
“I was trying to make waffles for breakfast,” Cas replies barely audibly, looking down, shoulders drooping.
“That clearly didn't happen.”
Castiel spent the better part of the afternoon in the store, wandering around between endless rows of furniture. There were moments when he regretted not letting Dean tag along with him as sometimes it was hard to decide which piece of furniture he wanted to buy, but in the end he bought two desks – a bigger, more expensive one for himself, and a smaller, feminine looking one for his eventual secretary -, four chairs, a filing cabinet and a comfortable leather couch. He scheduled the deliveries for the coming Friday, in the hope of opening his office on the Monday after that. For the first time since he woke up in the hospital after the police freed him, he felt like he was in control of his own life, and more importantly that it was good to be in control of his life.
“Dean?” Castiel looked around, but he couldn't see him anywhere.
“I can watch over him while you get your tattoo done,” Charlie suggested, but Castiel shook his head immediately, eyes way too panicked for the situation.
“You’re exquisite,” Cas murmurs, gaze roving over Dean’s mostly naked body. His eyes follow the flush that’s working its way down from Dean’s face to his chest over the compliment, and any reason to hold back suddenly becomes obsolete. He reaches for Dean’s hand to hold while the man steps out of the denim pooled around his ankles and pulls him closer, cupping his ass with his other hand. “My Dean. Let me look at you,” Cas continues, letting go of Dean entirely to slowly walk around him, appraising him like a piece of art.
“Sounds good.”
“I know, I look ridiculous.”
“I don’t know. People around here are really superstitious. They don’t really like this place, that’s probably why. And the existence of the Bone Chamber is not known outside the village and the estates surrounding it, so… but it is still a little baffling. I mean, that necklace alone must be worth a smaller house. I’m not saying I wouldn’t like to have that amount of money, but stealing from a corpse? So not cool. And I’m probably not the only one thinking that. Now, we don’t have much time, the torches are already flickering, so we’ll have to leave soon,” Dean explained, and he started pulling Castiel towards the back of the chamber. “So, this is the woman I was talking about. Look at that sword. It’s beautiful, too bad it’s so rusty.”
“Do you use this one?” He chuckled, holding up a huge mug, with little painted penises on it.
“Just another minute,” Castiel murmured, burying his head in Dean’s neck, clinging to him.
“I know I screwed up. I shouldn’t have yelled at him.”
“Did you just use your mojo on her?” Dean asked, already digging into the pie.
“This is a hunt, just like any other, nothing special, so what’s eating you?”
“I can help,” Castiel offered with a shy half-smile on his face.
“I should've said it back. But I froze.”
So, I disregarded all that, and focused on giving Team Free Will 2.0 what they deserve, retcon and Disney be damned.
“I don’t know how to do this,” he begins tentatively.
“I don’t know yet,” Dean shrugged, flashing a bright grin at his lover. “I’m hungry. Let’s get some food.”
“Hello, gentlemen, I’m officer Jody Mills. The crime scene unit will arrive shortly to see if there’s any evidence on the bike. While we’re waiting, can you please tell me how you discovered the object, and if you saw anything else?”
“Yes, Dean?” He answered finally, stepping closer to the hunter. If he'd been thinking straight, he probably would have realized how ill-advised that was, but with all of his blood, and, frankly, even the majority of his grace way down south, it didn't register.
“Hey Angel,” he rasped, “I think I'm overdressed for the occasion. Any chance you can spare some mojo to do something about that?”
“Why, what did she say?” This time it was Castiel who spoke. Dean turned his head to look at his lover, and a single glance was enough for him to know how Castiel felt. Soothingly he entwined their fingers, and Castiel pressed his body closer to Dean’s.
“I’m not sure yet. Chuck said I can stay as long as I want, and I like it here. It’s quiet and beautiful. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting to enjoy this as much as I do,” Castiel answered, sitting down next to Dean. “I always thought I was a big city boy. It seems like I was wrong about that. It’s no surprise, I’ve been wrong about a lot of things in my life,” he muttered absentmindedly after a long pause Dean waited silently for him to continue, but instead, he stood up, shoes still in his hands. “I kept you from your work long enough now. We should return to the estate.”
“Yes,” Cas says, rolling his eyes. Dean finds that his behaviour is not unlike Miracle’s after the dog got caught chewing Sam’s 3rd pair of slippers to shreds, and the comparison draws another laugh out of him.
He found Sam in the kitchen, obviously fresh from his daily self-torture session he insisted on calling a morning jog, an industrial-sized water bottle in his hand.
“Glad to have been of service.” Dean stretched his back. “What would you like for breakfast?”
“I am not sure I want to check out something like that.”
“Castiel, I’m sorry for the unusual introduction, but this is a masquerade, and taking the masks off would be breaking the rules, so… this is the Harvelle family, Bobby, Ellen, and their daughter Joanna. And this is Castiel Engelhart, a friend of Becky’s,” he introduced them. Firm handshakes and awkward, nice-to-meet-you hugs were shared, before another group of guests arrived, and the Harvelle’s had to go and greet them.
“You still haven't told Dean.” It wasn't a question, and Castiel really shouldn't have been surprised that Jack knew. He was a powerful half-archangel after all, and with their connection being the closest to a father-son bond, of course he would know. “You promised me you would.”
“That’s not unusual, for some reason I can’t get this kind to proof either,” Dean shrugs, poking one of the empty yeast sachets with his index finger. “Any left?”
“Yes, you’re correct, Joanna.”
“Are you telling me he’s… choosing to die?”
“Dean, I’m… not going to break. Come on,” Castiel urged his lover, and Dean obeyed. Soon both men were panting loudly, bodies glistening with sweat. Dean took Castiel’s erection into his hand for the second time, jerking him in sync with his thrusts.
“Then don’t act like a brat throwing a hissy fit. Yeah, the situation is bad…”
“Some form of amnesia almost always occurs after an accident, be it forgetting a few minutes, or a whole day. I’d say you have nothing to worry about. Do you feel pain anywhere?” The doctor asked as she removed the EEG’s electrodes from Dean’s chest.
“I don't think rushing into hunt after hunt is a good solution against the feeling of inertia.”
“It's okay.”
“It’s going great, we… wait, Dean,” He paused, and Dean knew he was made. “Are you asking about my work because you know I will bore you with details for half an hour, and won’t ask you how you are?”
“Cas, mice are not exactly welcome around here, you know. So, next time you take away the cat’s lunch, I expect you to consume it. It’s only fair.”
“No, I don’t think so.”
“You’re welcome. So, how did you two meet?” Castiel asked. Dean leaned back in his chair comfortably, fixing his stare on Castiel. He had already heard the story before, and with Castiel listening intently to Becky, he could watch the other man without being noticed.
By the time he locates the soft garments - they’re black and patterned with yellow Batman insignia - and changes into them, Dean’s asleep and snoring in quiet, rhythmic puffs. The noise should be annoying, and Cas reckons at some point it may become that, but right there and then it’s music. He slides in next to Dean with a drowsy smile and pulls up the covers all the way to his ears, not bothering to switch the lights off. Listening to Dean, he starts drifting off quite quickly, but not before he feels Miracle jump on the bed and settle right on top of his feet once again.
“Burden me,” Dean repeated with a scoff, leaning against his desk and staring at Castiel. “Yeah, I'm sure that was the reason, and not that you were afraid of how I'd react, you coward!”
worse. Because Sam lost people too, but somehow, his focus is suddenly on Dean's pain and only on Dean's pain.
“Shh, Cas. Don’t talk, just kiss me again.” He smiled.
“You do realize I actually like beheading things, right?” Dean voiced his disappointment, and Castiel scowled.
“It’s still better than saying nothing, and staring at her with big doe-eyes,” Castiel retorted.
“You know, guys,” Balthazar interrupted from the sidelines, “as touching and entertaining this is, you may want to vacate the premises of the Empty before the relationship drama and the following angry make-up sex…”
“That doesn’t look like he likes you,” Castiel observed.
“It invaded Heaven, looking for Jack. It was about to take him; I couldn't let that happen.”
“Dean, are you asking me out? Like, on an official date?” He asked, his eyes wide as saucers.
“Cas!” he called out. There wasn’t even an echo of his voice, no vibration in whatever passed as air under the circumstances and no reaction whatsoever. “CASTIEL!” he yelled again, taking a few hesitant steps away from the safe proximity of the portal.
Bile rises in Cas’ throat as he remembers the real Dean saying those words, and this time he does push the apparition away. “You don’t get to wear his face like this. You don’t get to use him like this!” he snarls.
“I’m going to go and see her in the morning,” Becky said.
With the source of fear gone, Judas slowly started to calm down, eventually letting the man near enough to gently pat his back. Dean grabbed the bridle, and he pulled at it until Judas began walking, still occasionally rearing.
~.~.~.~.~.~
“Cas, do you want to come over later today? We could make some popcorn, watch a movie or something.”
Then there was a rustle somewhere further down the corridor outside, and the muffled noise of footsteps followed.
it’s Dean before he even recognises him and dread settles in his stomach
“Son of a BITCH,” Dean swore, realization sinking in. The first vampire went straight for Castiel, like Dean wasn’t even there. The angel dodged her attack gracefully, and drew her out of Dean’s way who barely even had the time to untangle his blade from his flannel before the second vamp was on him, his fangs dangerously close to his jugular. He slammed his elbow into the creature behind him, but all it accomplished was a few more inches between teeth and skin as the vamp took a short step back. With his other hand, he stabbed blindly. The blade caught the vampire in his side, and the injury distracted him enough for Dean to gain the upper hand and push him to the floor.
“Don’t tell me to calm down, Becky. I’m not taking Judas on the non-used back roads for fun; I’m doing it because he’s not ready yet for cars or any other mechanized company, especially not ones racing towards him at 100 mph! He freaked, threw me down, and for the better part of an hour I couldn’t even get near him. He was constantly rearing and kicking. We’re lucky he didn’t injure himself in the process.”
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
Halfway through the work he stopped for an hour to eat and rest. This happened at the same time Sam had his own lunch break at the lawyer’s office he was working in, so they spent some time talking to each other on the phone. His brother was the only person in his family Dean actually wanted to keep contact with, so they were just as close to each other was they had been in their childhood. Sam didn’t care about Dean’s job, about him not fulfilling the promising plans their parents made for him, he loved his brother for what he was, and for Dean that was worth more than anything in the world.
“Okay, okay, no need to yell, big boy. A few years ago I stepped onto quite a few toes that I wasn’t supposed to, and...” He started explaining, but Dean interrupted him.
“I know. I know the basics of riding a horse, don’t I?” After Dean’s tentative nod, Castiel continued. “Okay, no further questions then. I’m going. Maybe I’ll just slow you down, but four eyes see more.”
“Okay, Dean.” Ben nodded, and he darted off towards the stable.
“Okay.” Chuck almost glowed. “So, I think an angel will grip your alter ego tight and raise him from Perdition, because God has work for him. Lilith wants to break sixty-six seals to free Lucifer from Hell, and it will be the Winchesters’ job to stop her.”
This time Dean’s apparition is already there, dressed in a denim shirt over a black t-shirt and gray jeans. He grabs Cas’ left hand with his right to pull him up; his warm, calloused fist curls around Cas’ fingers, and that simple contact breaks down any last defence Cas has.
“Thanks, bitch,” The elder Winchester murmured. He started eating, with an expression of ecstasy on his face.
“Come on, you can’t be that stupid. I’m a Trickster, but you can call me Loki.”
“Perfect, I’m going to pick you up at eight then.”
“We’re not doing this,” Cas shook his head and closed the distance between them, tilting his chin up slightly to kiss Dean, lips soft and gentle but insistent on his. “You said you loved me, so show me how you love me. Please, Dean,” he added after they parted, caressing Dean’s face with both hands.
“Is he a new one?” Castiel asked, nodding towards the horse.
The next evening Dean had a car accident: He hit a wall with his car, a black Chevrolet Impala from the year 1967. Weirdly, the car survived it with a few minor scratches. Dean was in a coma for almost a whole week however.
“Well, I wasn't prepared for any deals, much less for them to be upheld, and I should’ve looked for a way to get you back.”
“Do you miss the old times?”
“Come here, Cas,” he mumbles, and makes space for Cas to lie down. When he does, Dean props himself up on his elbow, leaning over him.
It took them a little over an hour more to get back to the bunker, and once they arrived, the three went their separate ways – the two Winchesters to their respective bedrooms to get some sleep, and Castiel to the library.
The spring turned into a hot, dry summer almost unnoticeably. The yellow cowslips and the purple violets slowly gave their place over to daisies on Dean’s favorite field, completely covering it in white, almost as if it was a bride-to-be in her wedding dress. Every time Dean took Judas there, the horse seemed to be just as mesmerized by the endless sea of white flowers as his rider was. They spent hours riding around on the rims of the field, not wanting to damage the plants more than necessary, and by the time the first flowers started withering, Dean was sure he had won Judas’ trust. After that, he started to involve Becky with Judas; because he knew she would be the one riding him most of the time.
“Bossy much?” Castiel grinned, but he did as he was asked to. Though he’d never said it out loud, he loved the effect his touch seemed to have on Dean, even after more than two years. The happy noises Dean was making were starting to get Castiel hot and bothered, so when Dean rolled over onto his back, the thin white sheet barely covering his half-hard cock, he knew that they won’t get out of bed any time soon. Before he knew what was going on, his hand was on Dean’s erection, jerking him off slowly, but firmly. It was hot and dirty, and Dean’s pants were getting louder with every sensual stroke.
As instructed, Castiel dropped into a crouch, which gave Dean a chance to behead the vampire who was trying to sneak up on the angel from behind. A minute later, when no one else attacked them and no noise came from behind the door either, Castiel tried to open it again, this time succeeding.
“Hamburgers it is then. You seem to be addicted to burgers. Should I call you hamburglar from now on?” Dean joked.
“Only if you want it to be,” Dean shrugged. “I just remembered I haven’t even kissed you today. That mistake needs to be fixed.” He smiled, and captured his lover’s lips in a short, almost shy kiss. Silently, they sat there for a while, before Castiel stood up and pulled Dean with him.
“Nope, not really.” Dean answered after he ascertained that it was in fact raining.
“I think it’s at least partially why you won’t stay asleep!” The Shadow’s voice raises into a screech by the last word. “Beings a lot more powerful than you obey the laws of this place so easily, but you, this weak, stained thing, keep defying me like it’s normal. I want you gone, and I want you gone permanently.”
“Where did you go, my love?” Cas asks, ruffling Dean’s hair, curling a longer-than-usual strand of it around his index finger.
“Thank you,” Dean whispers but doesn’t specify what he’s thanking Cas for. Instead, he runs his hands up Cas’ torso, brushing against both his nipples at the same time, and Cas arches into the touch.
“Oh, for Odin’s sake, you want me to pre-chew the food for you?” He lifted his gaze towards the sky, opening his arms exasperatedly. “You are both clever boys, you can figure something out. Can I finally let go of the time before holding it back drains my freaking Duracells? Thank you!” He snapped his fingers, and suddenly everything was alive around them.
The Shadow turns towards Cas. There’s cold calculation marring the delicate face it borrowed from Kelly as it lifts a warning finger. “Hush, little one, the grown-ups are talking here.”
“You know, Cas, a little help wouldn't go amiss here,” Sam turned to the angel instead of answering, and Dean's eyes flashed triumphantly at the first sign of surrender.
“I know, but… if we do that, I’m not sure I can stop myself.”
“What you already had? Of me? You had all of me, but I’ve only ever showed you the bad. I treated you like shit!” Dean argued.
“What?”
“But of course. Please, follow me, my lord.” Dean mock-bowed, and opened the gate to the stable. “This is my empire.” He smiled, waving around. “We have twenty stalls, but only thirteen horses right now. One of our mares is in heat, so our two stallions, Spartacus and Ben Hur are enjoying a little vacation over at the Harvelle’s Farm until she’s done with rutting, it’s just easier that way. Not all horses are actually Chuck’s, five of them belong to different people, but we get paid for feeding them, keeping them safe, and we can even use them for teaching if we want to. The problem is, we don’t want to, because I can’t imagine anyone who would want to learn riding on Mirage, Diamond or the others. Somehow they’re all a little psychotic and more than a little hard to handle, but I love them anyway,” Dean explained, and he did everything to keep himself from laughing when he saw Crystal’s head sticking out of her stall, slowly inching her way towards Castiel. Dean knew what was coming, and he hoped Castiel wouldn’t be angry at him for allowing it to happen. He started counting down from ten in his head, and by the time he reached zero, Crystal’s tongue sneaked out – almost like clockwork –, passing Castiel a sloppy, gooey horse kiss. Only then did he burst out laughing. Castiel made a disgusted sound, and he turned to glare at the mare, who did her best to look completely, utterly innocent, hanging her head and gazing up at Castiel from under her lashes.
“There could be some truth in what you just said.” Chuck admitted, because Dean and Castiel promptly proved Becky’s point. They lifted their heads, looking up at the exact same time, and after staring at each other for the better half of a minute they turned their looks back at their plates, not more than a second apart.
“I had a plan here, remember?” Dean remarks dryly, but he steals another kiss before giving Cas a chance to reply.
“We are aware of that. As I was saying, we found two bodies only. We didn’t have time to examine dental records yet, but we are pretty sure that those two were the kidnappers. We also found this.” She lifted her hand with the coat in it.
“Maybe these ones actually turn into bats,” Dean suggested jokingly, twirling the dregs of his third coffee. He was starting to get impatient, his interest in approaching the hunt with Castiel’s preferred caution dwindling.
“No surprise, seeing how those files you needed were made by me in ninety-nine percent of the cases.” Ruby tilted her head, and leaned against the wall, looking around in the room. “I guess you want to know about those recent developments too, right?” She asked, and when everyone nodded, she continued. “We found two bodies in the car wreck. One of them was shot pre-mortem, at least that was the opinion of the medical examiner. It probably killed him. The other, well… I don’t know how to put it nicely. He was burned alive when the car exploded. Honestly, probably the crash alone would have been bad enough to kill a person. Their bones were almost shattered by the force of it, they wouldn’t have survived it either way. Both persons were male, early forties.”
“I –” Cas’ voice wobbles. “I’m aware of that, but I can’t ease his pain. He’s strong, he’ll be fine.”
“Hey, Cas?” Dean murmurs into the space between them, his breath cool on Cas’ spit-slick lips.
“Fuck, yes,” Dean hisses, wantonly arching into the touch of the iridescent black feathers. “Gimme more, angel.”
“Seriously though, you've been wanting this for 10 years now?” he asked, fiddling with the corner of his sheets.
“Let’s get out of here,” Dean suggested, and Castiel nodded, letting the other man pull him towards the exit. They still held hands, but when they stepped outside the house, Dean let go of him, and Castiel didn’t reach out to reinstate the contact.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel finally lifted his head about 10 minutes later, looking up at the man, blinking sleepily.
“Short of them using the gap in the fence and going further in on foot, I don’t see how they would access the nest,” Castiel summarised and rubbed the bridge of his nose in a very human fashion, leaning back on the creaky chair.
“Am I dead?” Dean asks, because that's the only possibility, it cannot...
“I never expected any of this to happen. I never expected to be happy. I... didn't think you'd  want to make me happy,” Castiel confessed quietly, as if that explained everything.
The ride home was probably the most uncomfortable one they have ever had. The rain got freezing cold by the time they reached the estate’s gate, and the wind getting stronger wasn’t really helping either. Dean knew he was going to feel bad about not scrubbing the horses down, but lust was still cruising in his veins, making his blood boil, so he just threw blankets over the horses, and he led Castiel home. As soon as they were inside Dean’s house, Castiel started undressing his lover.
“Sewers!” Castiel exclaimed after Dean settled back into his seat.
“It’s not necessary… I just want to be left alone,” Dean mumbled, and even though the police officer obviously didn’t agree with him, she didn’t start arguing.
“I’m not saying I didn’t, because I did, but in the end, every time I wanted to leave, I realized that I belong here. Maybe this is not the best life, it’s far from perfect; but still, it’s exactly my kind of imperfect, if you know what I mean,” Dean answered, and when Gigette chose the exact moment of him stopping to start mouthing at his neck, it was almost like a subtle reassurance.
"I’m just trying to make heads or tails of what happened! I saw things... It was all very weird, but I thought it was real. I mean, I... settled into it, at least," Dean blinks, the corners of his mouth twitching downwards into the semblance of a frown. “I saw myself in Heaven. I spent some time with Bobby. Our Bobby. We were at the bar Ellen and Jo used to run before it burned down, but it was just him and me there. We had a beer - not even the good stuff, and then, Baby was there, so I drove around in my Baby until Sam arrived. I think he had a full life and I saw parts of that, too…” He finishes with a shrug.
“It's a milk run,” Dean objected, starting to sound like a child trying to get their parents to allow them just one more candy bar before dinner. Castiel's gaze bounced back and forth between the brothers, silently following their verbal table tennis. He agreed with Sam but deep down, he knew that one way or another, Dean would have his wish.
Once outside the room, Castiel allowed his self-imposed mask of cool to fall – it wasn’t good enough to fool anyone anyway, even before the argument. The rage coursing through him was such a Dean-like reaction that for a moment he wondered if it was his own or if it was just borrowed – learned, and that made him even more frustrated. He stormed off and walked aimlessly for the better part of an hour without even looking where he was going. Gradually, the anger subsided and gave its place over to a deep ache, which, at least, he knew for sure was his own.
The arrival of Devil’s Advocate was a welcomed distraction, but it was also only temporary. For a while, it was enough to take Dean’s mind off of Castiel’s disappearance, but the wonder of it wore off quickly, and soon the painful tug of worry and sadness was back. Trying to fight it took all of Dean’s strength, but eventually he lost the fight. He spent the better part of the day with tearing up the neighborhood, looking for any sign of Castiel. The bay where the accident happened was still busy, search parties, bay guards and the occasional police officers trying to scour up new pieces of evidence… or a dead body. The latter was something Dean didn’t want to think about, even though he knew that Castiel was probably dead. For hours he walked, looking everywhere for his lover. The only thing resulting from that was his growing frustration, and sometime early in the afternoon, he reached the point where he just couldn’t stop the tears of anger and pain.
Becky sat down on a chair, and looking at her hands folded in her lap, she began to talk softly.
“Castiel, right?” Jo asked, smiling widely at him.
“Oh,” he inhales sharply.
“Sexy?”
“Great. I have a lesson till six, but I’m free after that. We could meet at quarter past six here.”
With each passing day, Dean and Castiel spent more and more time together. The only times Castiel wasn’t near Dean was when he had horses around him. Castiel was still a little intimidated by them, but he was slowly getting used to them, especially because Dean kept nagging him to be friendlier with the hoofed beasts, and he even offered free riding lessons to him. Every time Dean did that, he had so much hope in his eyes, that it got harder and harder to say no, until one day Castiel finally gave in.
“I want the real thing, not this,” Cas grits out, and he finds himself in instant darkness.
“Can it be anything?”
The next morning Dean woke up earlier than he was used to. He tried to fall back asleep, but he couldn’t, so with a loud sigh he got out of bed, absently scratching at his stomach. By the time the alarm clock let out the first annoying beep, Dean had already showered, eaten his breakfast and checked the news and his emails on his smartphone. Moreover, he was actually starting to get bored. He didn’t want to disturb the horses’ routine and let them out earlier, and he didn’t have anything else to do, so he decided to go for a swim in the pool on the terrace of the main house. He changed into his swimming shorts, put on a black t-shirt, grabbed a towel, and walked out of the house. It didn’t take long for him to reach the pool, so he had plenty of time to enjoy the coolness of the water. He swam quite a few lengths before his muscles started aching. Not wanting to exhaust himself before a long workday he reluctantly climbed out of the water, and toweled himself off. Pulling on his t-shirt he started walking back to his house to change, but he ran into Castiel – literally, almost knocking the other man to the ground.
In the next few days Dean fell into a whole new routine, welcoming and integrating Castiel into his life. They spent most of the afternoons together, sometimes the evenings too. Mostly they were accompanied by Chuck and Becky, but other times it was just the two of them, talking, having fun, flirting. Time was passing quite quickly and before they knew it, it was the day of the Harvelle’s Annual Masquerade. Castiel wasn’t really in the mood for an event like that but Dean made him promise he’d go, so he did. Dean and Becky had to leave a little earlier, so it was just Chuck and him.
“Look at that, all of a sudden you’re in a hurry. Okay, watch. You put your hands here and here.” He pointed to the horse’s neck with one hand and to the edge of the saddle with the other. “You place your left foot into the stirrup, I’ll give you a little push. You just hold on, and try to swing your leg over her back.”
“That's not a good idea. Neither of us is going further in alone, so we would have to wait for the other to make it there,” Castiel argued. At first, Dean looked like he was about to disagree, but he refrained and walked off instead, wordlessly waving the angel along.
