John is halted by Sherlock’s sincerity, at the typically (when it comes to
John reaches up to grip purple hair, tugging Sherlock’s face into closer proximity to his.  “Sherlock, if you are toying with me…”
“You cheeky fucker!  Come ‘ere.”
While John mused, Sherlock twisted around completely, ditched his towel and straddled John’s hips.  He leant forward and placed a gentle kiss on the good doctor’s lips.  He looked earnestly at John.
Arms wrapped tightly, they move sinuously, together alone, rocking faster and faster, breath gusting, spiralling higher, shallow and deep until they clasp tighter than ever and...    just....    fucking...
John stands stiffly, staring at himself in the mirror while Sherlock circles him like a shark, humming and hawing.
“Holy fucking mother of hell!  Don’t you dare stop, Sherlock!”
Then Saturday night and Sunday arrived.  John felt like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but instead of hearing bells it was drums.  Sherlock, on the other hand, was fascinated.  He was pacing around the living room, hands steepled, index fingers stroking down and under his chin.
“Indeed,” he smiles.  He pets down Sherlock’s back as he closes his eyes and enjoys the feeling of his beautiful lover, quiescent in his arms.
“Hmmm?”  No direct eye contact.   Ratty smell getting stronger.
John possibly lost his humanity and went straight to full-on caveman.  He could hear those tribal beats in his head again – no hang on, those were
Sherlock grinned at him over his shoulder.  “Mmmm that’s it John.  You’re safe now.  Just stay hidden here forever.”
“Nope.”
“Holy fuck, Sherlock!”  John had found his voice.  He pointed at Sherlock’s crotch.  “Are those the…?”
“Oh how I love you, Sherlock.  You’ll drive me absolutely barmy one day, I’m sure, but I’m fairly certain it will be more than worth it”.  Sherlock hummed along his length and John smiled blindly.
It’s too much.  No one can take this much… this much… Ugh!  Enjoyment?Pleasure?Emotion?Sentiment?  Intimacy.
“I am bery much looking porward to inthructing you”.  Juan managed to make the word “instructing” sound obscene.
Sherlock could see the untamed glint to John's glazed look, the savage heat on his face.  He looked totally unfocused, unaware of his surroundings and Sherlock huffed a nervous laugh and struggled prettily in his grasp.
As they covered the rest of the distance I will tell you, dear reader, that pang of guilt was due to the fact that Sherlock had spent every hour John was away from the flat that week “preparing” those Speedos for today’s lesson.  The preparing involved utilising various results of experiments on lycra, and how the application of bi-carbonate of soda and hot water, along with various gentle acidic reactant agents would inevitably – yet invisibly – weaken the integrity of said lycra.
John prodded experimentally at the silvery trails of clear gel.  It looked like a demented giant slug had slithered across their kitchen in a very haphazard, drunken way.
Now John found himself and Sherlock alone on opposite sides of the salon.  John was sucked toward Sherlock like a puck across an air hockey table.  His view of the pantaloons was now uninhibited by the dress coat, as it had been shucked during the tackling.  John could see Sherlock's perfect lanky form from the toes of his boots through the charcoal waistcoat with dove grey fleur-de-lis, to the top of his gentle curls, drawn back into a dashing queue.  Breathing deeply to steady himself at the arresting sight, John drew up on his left, looking up at the painting that was consuming Sherlock's attention.
A soft wind fluttered the feathers of the pigeon roosting on the shoulder of the bronze.  From its vantage point it could see two rapidly moving heads – one sandy, one dark and softly curled.  Beneath those heads an inquisition was in progress.
John was stunned.  Sherlock was in a playful mood and had cracked another joke.  Never one to knock back a bit of nasty, his fingers whipped ‘round to deal with dressing gown sashes and was just reaching for the olive oil when-
“No.”
John helped Sherlock out of the sling and they wrapped themselves in towels and went to the cabana.  They’d been told to make themselves at home so John fished out some fresh fruit, nuts and other snacks from the compact kitchen.  They relaxed together on the chaise, John spreading his legs apart and patting the space between for Sherlock, who leant his back against John’s chest and sighed.
“Don’t worry.  I’m sure it will all become abundantly clear to me soon.  I just want to ask you – beg of you, really – please, whatever inane contraptions you’ve bought or invented or blow-torched, if it’s potentially harmful to my being could we perhaps leave it at home?  Do you think you could manage to just make this a normal day?  A regular day like normal people have where two people go out and one teaches the other something, without Holmesian mishaps like amphibians, or faulty stitching, or mis-tucked appendages.  Do you think we can manage that?”
Sudden splashing could be heard.  “Just a second, John...  OK, it’s open, come in”
“And John being a doctor?”
"I like this," he grinned, nosing the queue again.  "It's very dashing."
John let his sticky finger drag up a few inches of Sherlock, whilst simultaneously biting through the fabric to gently but firmly gather some scrotum between his teeth. Another gasp.
John’s mouth was hanging open in awe of his cutie pie.  He was having trouble computing.  He watched Sherlock take two laps of the room again before he continued with another deep breath,
"Is that the same bloke who did the ones we recovered?"
“God yes, SO yes.”
“Is this OK?”
Sherlock huffed.  "Obviously not.  They would have ruined the line of the fabric."
“Hngh?”
“Oh come on!  I can’t hear anything different in his playing”
“Sherlock Holmes get your beautiful arse out here. Right now!”
because it’s, well… I’m not interested in experimenting on anyone else’s semen, John, only yours,” he finished in a rush.  He looked up at his lover uncertainly.  “Does that make sense, John?  If I can’t use your fluids I just won’t do it.  It wouldn’t be interesting enough for me to continue.  But you can’t go giving it to anyone else!  It’s only mine, John.  Oh!  And yours, of course,” he hurriedly tacked on.
Too late now.
Sherlock lowered the red Speedos.
And as Sherlock told John about the case, the back of his tricky mind was already thinking about next Tuesday, wondering about the veracity of the claims on sex toy packaging, and just how waterproof ‘waterproof’ meant…
“How?  You’re not even reading a book or anything.  What the hell have you been doing in here?”
“Are you sure, John?”
“And how have we discerned this tidbit from his playing today?”
John took three deep calming breaths.  “I know I said it wouldn’t all be swimming lessons today but I did kind of want to get started with that.  That
It is impossible to think with Sherlock all up in his space.  His nearness, his focus, his warmth, his fragrance are intoxicating.   After all this time John is finally facing the very real possibility – it would seem, certainty - of intimacy with Sherlock.  He feels overwhelmed.  In the warmth of the cab Sherlock snuggles close, drifting that pierced lip over John’s neck, sipping at his skin, tasting and no doubt, cataloguing a million different factors, filing them away for future data mining.  A terrible thought occurs to John.  What if this is just-
Sherlock lowered his voice to his deepest rumble and pinned John with his gaze.  “Yesss, John.”
Mr Sherlock Holmes
Pushing off the doorway John drifted across the room to place his hands over Sherlock’s.  “How beautiful you are, Sherlock” he murmured.  “You’re always the dreamiest man in the room, my naughty little crumpet, but tonight you are just…
“Hang about.   How do you know so much about drums?  Do you play?”
"Oh, when you beg so nicely... Here, remove my glove for me, love."  John splayed his hand and placed the tip of his index finger in front of Sherlock's mouth.  Sherlock bit delicately at the seam until he could feel John slide his finger slightly down the leather.  The middle finger was presented and again, Sherlock carefully took the tip into his teeth and held while John's finger slid down.  After the ring finger was done, Sherlock re-bit John's middle seam-tip so that John might remove his hand from the glove.  John reached up and took the glove from his teeth.  “Perfect boy,” he whispered, lovingly stroking the soft kid across Sherlock's lips and down the side of his face.  Sherlock heard the gauntlet plop to the floor.
“But-“
“Sherlock, are you
“John, I have been waiting and waiting for you to make a move.  To give me some kind of sign.  To ask me if I’m interested.  To-“ he interrupts himself.  “John, do you know how frustrating it is to suspect your attraction, read your micro-expressions, see your lustful thoughts, and yet month after month, no bloody move?”
Sherlock’s expression perked-up.  “Yes John.  I won’t have to learn the whole time we’re there, will I?  Can we have leisure time too?”
“Of course not, John.  It’s obvious.”
A rustling sound emanated from across the room as John peered over his newspaper to see his dishevelled lover adjusting the focus of his microscope whilst peering into the eyepiece.  “Sherlock, even for you, that’s a bit apropos of nothing.”
“What was all that about?”
“No John.  No four-legged friends”
than as just friends.  There.  I’ve said it.”
ensued.
John had been waiting in the luxurious pool house for over half an hour while Sherlock bashed and crashed about poolside doing mysterious things.  It wasn’t like it was a hardship lying on the chaise sipping boutique beer but he was worried Sherlock was setting up another huge avoidance scheme out there in the vast, deserted country estate.
It took Sherlock only two days, six catalogues and three live frogs before formulating a plan for next Tuesday.
“What is it?  Ask me”
Sherlock preened, and like the drummer, he was only on the beginning of his roll.  “The left-handed factor took me until the second practice session of that first day to deduce.  Due to the nature of the set-up of a standard drum kit, the kick drum is played with the right – or dominant – foot, so it is placed in front of the right leg.  The other main drum used to make the main beats is the snare drum.  That is usually played by the left – or non-dominant – hand, and is set-up in front of the player.  That means if the kit in that particular flat is facing south, the louder, more pounding kick drum would sound closer to the western-facing window and the snare would sound further from it.  Those drums in this kit sound opposite to this, therefore the player is left-handed and has his drums set-up in a left-handed arrangement.  Simple.”
A beat, then, “There’s a sentence you don’t hear every day,” John muttered blankly.
John chuffed a laugh.  “I think we’d find it a bit difficult to get around to cases like this, Sherlock”
a bit frustrated, Sherlock.  Come over here and make gratuitous use of
John felt his ire deflate.  “I’m sorry, Sherlock.  I thought you were only thinking about the leisure time afterwards…”
Sherlock drags those long, supple fingers up John’s back, eliciting a shiver.  He feels his ridiculously tight shirt being dragged out of his trousers and the action being repeated, only this time from underneath the fabric.  “Oh Joohn.  I can feel the horripilation of your skin!”
The fingers are still twitching away as Sherlock stares through John, in his own world.  John leans to the side, soothing kisses down Sherlock’s jaw.  Little pecked gifts, dotting along his neck until he reaches twin freckles, spaced like a snake bite, the only thing breaking up the perfect expanse of ivory skin.  He licks over the marks, swirling his tongue over the tiny spots, thinking of them as the first items in his new Sherlock register.  As he’s filing them away he’s struck with a realisation: Sherlock’s twitching fingers are cataloguing data.  He smiles into Sherlock’s skin.  He’s going to make the gorgeous git build an entire new wing for all the things John’s going to do to him.  Starting now.
Sherlock turned in surprise.  “I’m not going in with everyone else, John?”
“Only under sufferance, John.”
John ran his hands down Sherlock’s chest.  “Mmmm.  Your skin’s so cool and smooth”
Having explained my own observations, I thank you for your prompt response.  I was gratified to find you saw something of interest in my letter.  I was also astonished by your knowledge of my past employment.  How could you possibly have garnered such data from a brief missive?  I have read and re-read it multiple times and am convinced I revealed nothing of neither my military, nor medical past, in my dispatch.
John looked up from his paper and waited for Sherlock to elucidate.  The silence persisted.  The detective was frozen in place but John couldn’t see his face from his angle.  He stood and approached Sherlock carefully, trying not to disturb him lest he was on the verge of something but when he glimpsed his face he could see it was stricken, frozen in shock.
“It’s
If John knew one thing about his little dumpling it was that if cases were slow and Sherlock wasn’t complaining it was because he had another focus, and John was fairly certain now that the great detective’s mind was focused on Tuesday.   John didn’t know what insane ideas Sherlock was cooking up, but things had gone far enough.  He wanted Sherlock to take that lesson and he wanted his boyfriend back.  It was time to get everything out in the open.  And if he didn’t like what he learnt when he opened that Pandora’s box?  He could always seal it all back together again with Sherlock’s silicon caulk.  He took a seat on the coffee table.
He moved on to Juan and blinked.  Juan was ignoring John and smiling widely at Sherlock, teeth parted to expose a bit of tongue, eyes raking up and down Sherlock’s body, eyebrows mobile as two randy caterpillars, cheeks pinking in arousal, shorts straining.  Deduction:  …
“I still can’t believe the DJ was in on-  Hang on.
"Jesus bloody wept," John whispered under his breath, eyes mesmerised by the buttocks straining the stitching of the pantaloons currently lovingly encasing Sherlock's magnificent cheeks.  John watched the gentle wobble of said cheeks as Sherlock strode ahead of him, hessians tapping out an echo on the marble floor of the National.
, from Les Misérables.  It gives Mycroft hives.
John, still in a man meat trance, obediently went to his knees like a zombie zeroing in on brains. “Exactly where would you like me to tuck it, Sherlock? I mean, these pants just aren’t meant for a man of your dimensions and certainly not for swimming in. Where on earth did you get them?”
"God, yes.  Delicious, tantalising, plumpened, fat, perfect Sidecock, Sherlock.  I'm naming it.  It's getting a capital letter and everything.  All I can see is Sidecock belonging to you and in a building full of fucking masterpieces it's still the prettiest thing I've seen all day."
“From the first day I was able to deduce that this was a left-handed teenaged boy with glasses.  Several factors led to this decision, the primary two being room selection and drum kit positioning.  The buildings on this street all follow an identical internal pattern.  The drumming is emanating from the front bedroom of the flat, which is inferior in size and privacy to the rear bedroom, which would, of course, be inhabited by the parents of the household, therefore the drummer is not of parental age.  Add to that the fact that the hours the drumming is heard are more in line with school hours and not work hours and you have confirmation,”  Sherlock paused to drag in another deep breath and resumed in the same speed and tone, “Knowing what we do about the position of the doorway in the front bedroom of these flats and the placement of the window, add to that the fact that the window is west-facing therefore gets bright sun in the afternoon hours – just after school when his first afternoon practice session begins – it is not possible that the kit would be set-up on the south side of the room where the wall is short and would have to be placed adjacent to the window where the sun would shine straight into his eyes while he’s trying to play.  That only leaves the space in the front corner of the north side of the room with the kit facing south-“
“Answer me!”
point in my head so I guess I was hoping you’d just take over…” he trails-off.
“I’m giving you a five second head start.  Now RUN!”
“Nothing to do with his drumming, John.  He’s a teenaged boy.  Enough said.”
Long, supple fingers inch around from behind his body toward John’s straining buttons.  John stares, unmoving, like a stunned mullet, hypnotised by the encroaching Fingers-Of-His-Fantasies.  Those looong, slender digits have been featuring in John’s rather heated nocturnal musings for some time now.  Upstairs, in his private moments – the very few Sherlock
“They’re what, John?”
“Yes, tea would be nice” he mused as he paced the floor.  John gave it about thirty seconds before Sherlock wouldn’t be able to help but show-off.  The kettle boiled.  Annnnnnyy second now… three, two, one…
“Hang on a minute,” John interrupted.  “Why couldn’t he set it up on the south side facing south?  Or at the rear of the room away from the window?”
Just as John was about to reach out to grab a handful of lusty arse Sherlock straightened up and casually wobbled his way toward the bedroom, throwing an audacious wink over his shoulder before rounding the doorway.
SHERLOCK… SHERLOCK?!!!”
“I don’t think I’m going to be able to last, John”
I feel like an idiot.”
“Relax, John.  I read this was the best waterproof lubricant, and I’ve tested it and it’s quite true.”  Sherlock scooped up a generous portion of shortening in two fingers.  John felt like a goose.  Like a big trussed-up Christmas goose that was about to be stuffed.
“You think it’s an act, but it’s not.”
To answer your question, there were several skilful observations that bounced around in my head.
“Sherlock, how many jazz artists were into cocaine and heroin?!  And why do you care?”
“John, he’s totally mastering it today.  He’s hitting every cue and gliding through sections he normally trips-up on.  He’s so upbeat and smooth it
“Yes, Sherlock.  Plenty”
“I know that, but we’re going to the store where I bought those Speedos to demand satisfaction.  I can’t believe the shoddy the workmanship on those bathers.  The company needs to know that the public just won’t stand for it”
“Huhngh!”  Hands clamp onto John’s head, clenching at his hair.  He pulls back to run his tongue over the roof of his mouth, savouring the elemental tang of Sherlock.  Before he can lean back in his head is dragged back to the job.
“Wait! I have plenty to say to you but that’s for another time, and there
pair of Speedos.  Flopping his head back to the pillow John swept his eyes down the luscious body lying in a state of dishabille beside him.
“Can it wait a minute, John?  I’m just looking for the acetone.”
“Well what ARE you after, Sherlock?”
and for the first time in almost three weeks, the little drummer boy two doors down actually made them SMILE.
John, having tasted fresh air in the hall, had every intention of doing just that but he wasn’t about to let Sherlock have all the control.  Without budging he demanded, “Reach up and take down the Speedos, Sherlock.  Expose that glorious arse for me, but only pull them down at the back.”
“Just two more minutes, John”
John swivelled.
“Are you working up to the point where you ask for some of my spunk to see if it floats, sinks or otherwise?”
“Down here!”  Sherlock yelled up at the window.  An outline of a figure could be seen behind the net curtain.  “We wanted to speak with you about your drumming”
“Package for Holmes!”
Sherlock took a deep breath and released it slowly over John’s chest.  “I love you, John Watson”
John blinks himself to life.  “Sherlock,” John protests, peering concernedly at the straining buttons, “that makes it look even
"Bloody hell, Sherlock: Sidecock!"
you do to me will feel exquisite.  Observe!”  He gestures to his straining chest.  “My body begs for your attention,” points to his ruckled nipple, “my skin craves your touch.  How can any touch you bestow upon me feel anything other than superb?” he chides.
“Mmmmm?”
“Why do you need that, my sexy pancake?”
Maintaining eye contact John moved his hand down to Sherlock’s thigh and scratched it upward slowly until he reached a rapidly hardening cock and gave it a good, firm squeeze.  The hand slipped around the back and grabbed a palm full of bounty and squeezed again.  Two very aroused boys panted in each other’s faces.  Fingers edged closer to crease and pushed Speedo into crack.  Sherlock pushed his hips away from the wall and into John’s heat.  John started rutting against Sherlock’s thigh.  He dipped his head and in his primal haze, sucked and bit at Sherlock’s neck, marking what was his.  He leaned back to survey his handywork, feral lust clouding his vision…
His voice came slowly, monotonically, “He’s like me, John,” he intoned.  “He’s got something big on his mind and he’s using music to get his mind to work.  That’s why he can’t concentrate on any one piece.”  Sherlock came out of his trance and swivelled to face John.  “John, we’ve got to talk to him.  We’ve got to introduce me to him so he knows he’s not the only freak out there.”  His eyes dropped.
John’s focus is such that he gets lost in his labour of love, investigating armpits, the dip of a waist, the hollow of the small of his back.  Everything is tasted, sniffed and kissed until Sherlock is a trembling mess.  When John moves down to the crease of his buttocks, his sweetheart squirms in anticipation.  He flutters a soft lick in the cleft, teasing his breath over the new moistness there.  Sherlock gasps and pushes his hips off the bed, bowing his back to chase John’s caress.  John gives it happily, licking again, deeper and longer, seeking Sherlock’s taste with his tongue.  He’s rewarded with captivating noises of pleasure, urging him on to further passion.  John sits back on his heels, freeing his hands to tenderly part Sherlock’s cheeks so that he might burrow closer closer, nose deeper into the most personal of intimacies.  John falls, without hesitation, astonished somewhere in the back of his mind that he has no objection to this most louche, private act.  He revels in Sherlock’s complete surrender, indeed, in his
“Ungh, if you insist, John“ he huffed.
A beat.  “Yes.”
John’s mouth clicked shut.  “Hnn-“
John, unused to a modest or grateful Sherlock, felt greatly moved.  He had to clear his throat a couple of times before responding.  “You’re so very welcome, Sherlock.  There’s not a lot I can teach you that you don’t already know, but this I can.  And now, I think we’re getting a bit pruney, so let’s hop out for a bit and have a rest and something to eat.”
He’s a doctor who heals.
“Nothing.  Don’t let me stop you”
LONDON  E9 6QT
under his breath.
"Didn't you wear any underwear under those pantaloons, you indecent baggage?"
After the debacle of last Tuesday’s non-swimming lesson, dear reader, John had determinedly gone out and bought Sherlock a pair of regular old Speedos.  In John’s mind, there wouldn’t be any way Sherlock could possibly derail his lesson with these in the way that he had last Tuesday.
A whimper escapes John’s throat.  Sherlock isn’t wrong about his top ten.  His confident attitude is indeed, making John crazy for him.  He wonders how far he’ll take it.  Knowing Sherlock, way past decency and beyond.  The thought inspires a smile.
“Oh that’s better.  Words of one syllable, now.  I’ll have you on straight noises, soon,” he teases.
Behind him, Sherlock huffs and fusses and knocks John’s hands away.
“That’s it.”
“Yes, John”
“Mmm.  It is, isn’t it.”
John hurrumphed and settled in for some two-fingered blogging.  There was a nice little case he wanted to post about an unfaithful husband, his gay lover and their unfortunately fatal sexual shenanigans in a yew tree.  He was thinking of calling it “BLATANT INN-YEW-END-O”  Sherlock had cleared the wife and solved the case in thirty minutes flat but it didn’t make it any less interesting, not to mention titillating.
"Shhh, Love.  I know.  Me, too."
He’s resuscitating under gun fire.
"Oh John, much more of that and I'll be ruining the pants further."
“Well derrr!  Look at me!  I’m a
“No John,” Sherlock murmurs, “I mean four.”
Sherlock’s eyes met his blankly.  “I don’t want to ever hear you say that again.  You are NOT a freak.”  John grabbed Sherlock’s face between his palms and moved his own right up into it.  “YOU… are the most incredible, luminous…
Sherlock swallowed, got up from the table and slowly approached John, hands out in a calming gesture, to kneel at John’s feet.  “I’m sorry, John.”  John’s eyes widened.  “Please don’t give anyone else your semen.  I-I…I don’t mean to lessen the importance of your ejaculate by experimenting on it, If anything, it’s the opposite – I only want to use
The crumpet arose and John opened his eyes and reached out to free it’s cock.  He pulled Sherlock close and took both eager erections in one hand, drawing one of Sherlock’s hands around to cover them too.  Together they stroked as they smiled at each other.  Things got a bit pant-y and giggly very quickly so spare hands lifted to cover each other’s mouths.  Hands were shuttling, bottoms were thrusting, noses were breathing very hard until finally, as John had demanded,
Sherlock’s eyes widened and he shuddered.  “I wonder if he’d like to come out with us to see something at Ronnie Scott’s.  We’ve got to steer him toward jazz instead of reggae!”
Sherlock had a bit of a think about that. John had been working on him for weeks to take swimming lessons and no amount of distraction (with naked bits) or cajoling (with tongues) or negotiation (with pouting) had swayed John from his path. So here they were at the local leisure centre. But Sherlock was not a Holmes for nothing. He still had one more trick up his sleeve.
“OK, that’s that.  You’re perfect.  I’ll just be a few minutes and then we’ll go.”  Sherlock whirls and strides toward the bathroom.  John stands rooted to the spot, stuck in stunned-mullet mode.
The boys were cuddling on the floor in front of the sofa, John stroking his cutie’s locks back from his forehead, when he recalled an unjustified deduction.  “What about the frequent masturbation and porn under the bed, Sherlock.  How could you possibly have known about that from his drumming?”
Next John re-took the crop in his left hand by the tip, and skimmed it down Sherlock's body.  He carefully lassoed the leather wrist loop around Sherlock's balls and cock, then reached up and tapped the keeper against his lips.  "Open up again, love.  That's it.  Perfect.  Keep that between your teeth until I say.  Now tilt your head back a little, I want some tension on your balls.  That's it, just right."  The riding crop was now vertical along Sherlock's torso, straining between his teeth and testicles.  It was an arresting sight.  "God, if only I could take a photo of this, you sexy piece.  If you want to stop, just tap me on the thigh and we'll stop immediately.  OK, beautiful?"  Sherlock grunted.
“John,” Sherlock whispers, slightly unsurely, “to be honest…well…I’d planned out everything up until this point, where it suddenly gets all kind of vaguely hot and sweaty.  I’ve imagined so many ways things could go that it’s all a bit of a kaleidoscope of limbs and lips, and that confident attitude you like would only get me to
“Would you like to go in to the Yard to see if Lestrade has any cases for you, Sherlock?”
“Of course I love you, you bloody great giraffe.  And you love me – you must, to have gone to all this trouble,” he laughs, touching the lip ring reverently.  “So come on – let’s get naked.”  He grabs Sherlock’s arse cheek and pushes it toward the giraffe’s bedroom.  “In here’s okay?”
) reticent man’s candour.  A dizzying flush rises up over him at the trust once again displayed.  He falls upon Sherlock, stripping the shirt away completely and running his palms over the smooth expanse of skin.
“But you had to have had them done only today.  They must’ve told you not to-“
“Only if you want to keep going.”
Sherlock covers the hand over his heart and slides it down his chest until it hits a little bump in the road.  A bump much firmer than a simple nipple could possibly be.  His breath stops.  Completely.
Eyes still on the screen, Sherlock waved his hand around imperiously.  “Yes, John.  Vegetable shortening”
“Sherlock, why do you-  no, forget it.  Sit down, please.  We need to talk”  John heard an indrawn breath.  “No.  I don’t want to hear it.  Just leave whatever you’re doing and come and sit down.”  John gestured to the lounge in front of him.
“But-“
John’s neck extended northward, indignantly.  “And just what is that supposed to mean?  Are you saying you don’t consider my feelings on the matter important enough to ask permission?”
“Oh John, it feels so good.  John I love your mouth on me John” Sherlock babbled.
Suddenly John felt a bit not good.
“Oh?  Pray tell?”
and yet Sherlock’s is thoroughly alluring.  In every possible way.  Like the man connected to it.  He looks up as Sherlock edges back to watch John’s hand.  Sherlock’s now rolling his hips in vertical eights and John is going off his tree.  He’s trying to keep hold of Sherlock’s cock and his own control but he’s losing the battle with the latter.  His gorgeous thing grinds and thrashes above him, tipping his head back to groan long and loud at the ceiling, and John can feel it in his fingers as he slides them up and over his throat.
Sherlock turned to John with widened eyes and an excited grin.  “See!  I told you.  I haven’t played my violin since they moved in and she knows, she
“Hmmm…?”
blood-red nail varnish that would make John’s eyes bug.  Such was Sherlock’s devotion to his task he found himself fervently fingering five inch fuck-me-they-can’t-be-legal velvet ankle-strap heels that even
“I know.  I know, love.”
heaven, and John is going to grab it.
“TEN?!”
He moves off to the side.  “Turn over, love.”
“Hmmm?”
“I’ll be very gentle, John.  I’ve been thinking about it for ages.  I’ve brought some toys we can use in the spa to help you relax…”  God, how the tables were turned!  Two hours ago
He stilled momentarily. “Is everything OK, my love?” Sherlock nodded vigorously and pushed back against the invasion. John groaned softly into Sherlock’s ear.  Soft, dark curls tickled his nose as he drifted it along that acreage of neck.
“And what would you need- no, once again, I’d rather not know… What about the Trex, Sherlock?  Are we thinking of making some kind of pastry treat to take with us?”
Poor confused John tried to breathe.  He checked his dumpling was fully dressed, grabbed his hand possessively and marched out of the change room slamming some notes down on the manager’s desk as he stalked past.
John opened the door to find his naked detective sitting all-too-innocently in the tub, hands resting in his lap and looking all delicious.  This required further inspection.
John starts to smell a rat.  “Sherlock?”
“Ack! Ah, even though I’ve been very bad, trying to get out of swimming lessons, would you consider bending me over and fucking my arse right now because I think I’m going to have trouble walking if you don’t and I’ll promise to come back next week if you do. Please, John. Please. Will you, John. Please? Ugh.”
gave them the finger, spun around and disappeared back into her room to resume her banging and crashing.
“John, how much room is there going to be in the car?”
Sherlock reclined on the lounge in Baker Street, stretched one long leg over the back and languidly enjoyed a moment of rest.  John was out getting provisions as they’d let the cupboard run down a bit this last week.  He let a hand drape across his chest and closed his eyes, enjoying the feeling of being thoroughly debauched.  John had really let him have it when they got home and he was in no position (well, many positions, actually) to refuse his bossy little autocrat after the way he let Sherlock take the reins at the pool.  Who would have known swimming lessons would be so rewarding.  He wondered what his reward would be if he got up to paddling…
“You know my methods, John.  I know there’s no need for protection.  What’s more, I have no wish to be separated from you.”
“Please, what, Sherlock?”  John watches from under his lashes as Sherlock pants, his chest straining for John’s touch.  “Hmmm.  Would you like me to…
John made a sound deep in his throat.  He hunkered down and licked around where his finger disappeared into Sherlock.
John reached out his arm and curled it around Sherlock’s shoulders.  No reaction.  He shuffled in close and placed his other hand on a still chest.  He could feel Sherlock’s heart racing under his fingers.  “Sherlock?”  John smoothed his palm down and around the chest as he hugged his shoulders.  “Are you OK?  What have you discovered?”
Sherlock looked up uncertainly.  “Oh.  A bit not good?”
"Sir Thomas Lawrence"
“…What?”
of all people who Sherlock chose to be his companion.
As John glances around, the thumping song segues into the next, a deep, pulsing heartbeat of a noise, powering up through his feet to resonate in his core.  It’s an Aussie’s song, well, a remix anyway.  He recalls hearing it live in Sydney when it was first released.  The singer was on tour back at home, and they were untangling an intrigue set up by a demented fan.  As her voice throbs lowly through the speakers, he remembers thinking she had the best belly laugh he’d ever heard.
“Well derr, it’s obvious!  Look at the fingertips of ya left hand – stringed instrument.  That, added to the fact that you’re left shoulder is slightly higher than ya right and you’ve got a bit of a darker patch of skin on ya neck where ya chinrest sits says it’s a violin.”
Reggae, however, emphasises the first and third beats of each bar, and is much more rigid and tight in its rhythmic structure.  There is a similarity in the use of syncopation, but it uses more snappy drum beats, staccato fills and has a fluid, soulfulness to it.  The drum beats often double or imitate the horn parts so there has to be more structure – no uninterrupted soloing like you get in jazz.  Reggae also uses a splash cymbal and a cow bell quite frequently, which is that horrible hollow sound you can hear every afternoon that makes me want to go over and offer to milk their cow” he ended with a growl.
and tumble into the waves together.
, John!”  He turned swiftly back to the window.
John did as he was told.  Amazingly, he
of dealing with this. One of those ways is to get Sherlock all lovely and riled up, and then just, well,
“Really, John.  Will you let me inside you?”
“I’m not going anywhere, I promise.”  John stroked his fingers gently in the water around Sherlock’s body, being careful not to make splashes.  He tried to distract his student.  “This swing of yours is brilliant.  I can only imagine what you have planned with it for later…”
”  John matches word with action and sways forward to tap his tongue lightly against his lover’s nipple.  The skin ruches tightly, bewitching him.  He taps again, forcing a small moan from Sherlock.  Oh.  What a lovely sound.  He swipes a lick with the flat of his tongue this time, hoping for a longer sound and is rewarded with a moan that John feels in his core.  “God, Sherlock.  Even the sounds you make get me hot!  Let me hear you.  I want to know what makes you feel good.”
“So yes, unusual genres not really natural choices for a white teenaged Brit.  Think, John, of the only introductions you got to music when you were a child.  Having no money or indeed, interest, in listening to a wide range of music in your formative years in order to discover your particular preferences you tend to absorb anything playing around you.  Living exclusively at home for the early years of their life, a parent’s musical preferences would be the predominant influence playing in the household.  Add to that small external influences such as anything taught in music lessons at school and these are the sum total of repertoire.  Until he’s old enough to choose his own radio station – or listen to songs on YouTube these days - or buy his own music.
John reached over and grabbed some pineapple and fed it to Sherlock.  As they chewed quietly a thoughtful kind of peace came over them.  John absently skimmed his hands over his love’s body and Sherlock hummed a gentle tune into the quiescence.  John couldn’t think of a time when he knew Sherlock to be so restful.
Sherlock brightens, “Mmmmmmm.”
That’s all she wrote.  “Sherlock, please, tell me you’re close!” he grits out.
“No, John, no frogs”
John stiffened.  His arms came down to his sides and his hands clenched.  He stuck out his chin and exhaled.  “Sherlock, look at me.  Look at me right now.”
“Aaah yes yes yes yes yes, John.  That is so very right just there Johnny.  Oh!”
“Oh. My. Bloody. God.”
“YES!  Fucking see-through, Sherlock.  How the hell can a brand new pair of Speedos go see-through in a week?  They haven’t even been wet!”  John reached out and pinched some lycra between his fingers to demonstrate his point and a side seam gave way with a
I would be more than happy to provide you with the opportunity to experiment.
He’s him.
After a bit of banging about again, Sherlock had the swing set-up over the spa.  He showed an incredulous John the extra long sling he’d made that would hang below the level of the frame and into the water below.  John blanched a bit when he saw how many toys Sherlock had stacked up in the sports bag at the spa edge – how much bloody money did he spend! - but when he looked over at the open excitement on his sweetheart’s face he knew he couldn’t deny him.
“Your tongue,” Sherlock felt faint, “please, I want your tongue in me”.
“No there are definitely late beats there.  He’s not rolling with his fills.  Must’ve taken an injury to his left.  He’s holding back.”
Sherlock’s eyes pop open.  A slow smirk curls his lips and John has the feeling his life is about to change.  Is this what it feels like to be on the receiving end of Sherlock’s sexual attention?  As if the entirety of his colossal focus has zeroed-in on you, at the expense of everything else in the world?  As if he likes what he sees and is gearing up to pounce?  A frisson of unease rattles down John’s spine.  Reality drips in with the water, cooling his ardour.  This isn’t real.  Someone is probably watching them, and Sherlock is putting on one of his superb performances.  Summoning some grit, John clenches his jaw, pushes back a half step, looks Sherlock in the eye and dances on.
John froze.  Sherlock's voice pierced the veil of fog, and he was right.  The thought of that lechy Lothario seeing an aroused Sherlock was the only thing that could bring him to his senses.  Chest heaving, he stepped back letting Sherlock’s arms fall, and let the cold water splash over both of them before taking two steps away to regard Sherlock.
“What?”
John let his head drop to the back of the couch in defeat.  “Just let it be.  He might be a career musician for all we know, practicing for work.  He’s good enough to be.  You can’t begrudge him his practice.”
Sherlock felt his fingers twitch involuntarily against John’s.
Tuesday:  “He’s in the school band!”
“No, this is not just an experiment, John.”
“No case.”
The spike lowers and a crease forms adjacent to it.  Plush lips form a moue of annoyance as Sherlock shakes his head and dances on.  John’s about to demand an answer when he realises they may well be being observed right now, and decides to follow whatever lead Sherlock offers.  He knows how dangerous it can be to fish for information out in the open: memories of a singed ear causes John to rub absent-mindedly at his helix.  Ad-libbing on the fly it is.
”What?!”
“What about Mycroft?”
“And I’m not whining, John.  Not at all.”
"Yes, John, it's the same
“Right.  Good.”
“I’ve observed all of your reactions to stimulus over a very long time, John.  I applied to myself, the top ten things that received the highest recurring reactions in order to maximise my chance of success.”
John chuffed to himself as Sherlock giddily jumped up and ran to his bedroom for a specimen jar.  Was there anything he wouldn’t do for this man?  It appeared not.  He looked up as his gorgeous, pink-cheeked lover returned, jar in hand, about to scrape jizz from his chest, and decided he wouldn’t want his life any other way.
“Is this what you imagined, John, when you heard that song in Sydney?  Did you picture me running my hands over my body, or over yours?”
"Yes, John"  Sherlock whispered meekly, shivering coyly.  “I never stifle natural talent.”
Monday:  “He had a bad day at school today, John”
He looked up at Sherlock with love in his eyes and beamed.
Sherlock posed patiently in the room, congratulating himself on completely overwhelming John.  With a bit of luck John would go all night and they’d oversleep in the morning.  He looked up to find John lounging against the doorframe regarding him in a rather too back-in-control-of-himself manner.
“Yep.  But I’m
“Yes John,” the crumpet panted, “I’m very ready for you.  Take it out, please.  I want your hot length in me.”
and give me some,” he growled.
– instructing, Juan.  I’m going to need to be there, too.  Yes.  Definitely.”
"What, the one with the-"
“I said ‘Oh right’”
Sherlock gazed at him levelly.  “I love you, John.”  John smiled.  Sherlock smiled.  “Now, let’s go throw some rocks at his window so I can show you how right I am”
“So?”  Sherlock asked.  John glanced at him.  He was staring up at the window as if transfixed.
“Um, I think… well, I know… Ah, would you consider…?”
Sherlock was still glued to the laptop.  “Well if you’re going to keep ignoring me all day I’m going out.”  John patted his pockets.  “Where’s my wallet?”
“Hmph.”
the bedroom.  The drumming stopped and the boy’s husky voice could be heard to shout, “What the bloody bollocking hell?  Who the crap is chuckin’ rocks into my room?”
Before he knew it was coming, John felt a tear race up and over his eye and down his cheek.  He tilted forward and pressed his cheek to Sherlock’s and linked his hands behind Sherlock’s neck
Sherlock slumps against his chest and John immediately brings his legs in a little more to stop from slipping out of him. He doesn’t want to lose the connection yet.  “Mmmm, John.  Indescribable," he garbles into John's neck. "It’ll take aaages t’ sort ‘n’ catalogue all that."
“Pfft.  Please.  Don’t insult my intelligence” and with that the little drummer
He’s a limping veteran.
“Yes, John”
They laughed as they got John naked and positioned in the sling.  It was a bit different to the floating one.  This one was more like a laid-back cradle with spots for John to put his feet that reminded him of the stirrups in the surgery.  He suddenly empathised with the many women he’d so casually ordered up into them.  To say he was feeling a bit vulnerable was putting things lightly.
“ENOUGH!” Sherlock’s face had purpled.  John’s eyes widened in surprise.  He was concerned he may have gone a bit far, as he’d never seen Sherlock work himself up, well, at all, really.  Except in excitement.  But in anger?  No.
Oh come on!  This was a bit much.  “Sherlock, my sweet. Do you need any help in there?”
“Take me home.  Now.”
John’s jaw dropped.
"Joooohnn."
John blinked.
“Ahh I can’t… somewhere in the back of my wardrobe?” It had taken Sherlock three shopping trips to find exactly what he wanted, finally unearthing the silky shorty shorts in La Perla. Going by the flushed look on John’s face and heavy mouth breathing, it was worth all the unwanted attention he got from various sales boys along the way and one very pushy matronly assistant who looked like she’d eat him for breakfast (in fact, she offered to). “John, I can feel you breathing on me. It’s having an effect on my modesty.”
John can’t understand it all, it’s too much, he’s too open, he’s whirling, he’s out of control, can’t comprehend, can’t centre himself .  He’s everything all at once.
while he had physical access to John’s sugar crumpet.  There was no WAY Don would be allowed to grope his sweetie’s bounteous gifts!
“Sherlock, my graceful little swan, why are there strings of silicon caulking all over the kitchen?  Are you going to re-seal the tiles?”
"Am not."
He peered carefully at John.  John was braced soldier-straight, leaning slightly forward from the heels, hands fisted at his sides, chin jutting out, eyes narrowed on Juan.  Deduction: John a bit not happy.
John whimpered.  Sherlock sat up slightly and twisted around to see John’s face.  He couldn’t handle the lack of visual data any longer.  John had tensed up but his cheeks were pink and he was breathing shallowly through his mouth: arousal.  Sherlock relaxed a bit.
Normal transmission resumed on Sherlock’s face.  “Oh thank god, John.  I thought-“ he shuddered. “Nothing.  I can’t even say it.  Just so that nothing happens to it you’d better hide it in here” he deadpanned, turning and bending over the kitchen table.
Filling his lungs with a few cleansing breaths John forced his brain to the fore and…
As he got half way down the hall he heard a low-level humming coming from the bathroom.  “Sherlock?”  he called through the door.
"Hhhmmmm, love?"
be okay with kissing you afterwards!”  More kisses are bestowed upon John’s grinning mouth, longer and gentler, until he finds himself tenderly sucking on Sherlock’s bottom lip, feeling the wee ball and ring click against his teeth.
“So?” he repeated.  John could see he’d be stuck on ‘so’ for a while.  Time to nudge the needle out of the groove.
Sherlock prowls closer to John, nudging in between his legs.  John grips Sherlock’s hips and leans forward to ghost his nose across the golden trail of hair under his navel.  He gifts a kiss to his belly before fumbling clumsily with the belt buckle.  “Shit!”  He hears a puff of a snort from above and mutters, “shut up.  I’m trying to be seductive.”
“Yes.  I thought you might have been.  Could the caulking and the batteries and all the mysterious packages be related to this impending event?”
“John, did you know that semen floats?”
.”  He bent close to Sherlock’s rear.  “Were I to blog this crime against my sanity I’d name it, ‘A Vision in Red’, my love” and pressed his rouged lips firmly to one cheek of that comely rear leaving perfect glossy lip prints.
“Oh no, I’m not finished yet.  I’m on a roll here.”  John waved his arms about, gesticulating dramatically.  “I could go visit the sperm bank, see if they need any donations.  How about I drop back in to Baskerville?  I’m sure they’d remember my face down there.  I could pop in for a quick wank in case they’re a bit short on supplies for their heinous and illegal doings.  What about-“
Sherlock’s shoulders lowered as his neck extended giving him an extra two inches.  He eyed John disdainfully.  “I never guess.”
“What!  Do you doubt me, John?” he gritted indignantly.
Afterward they shower lazily together, kissing and laughing, then get ready for the walk across town to the leisure centre.
John looked, astonished, at the living embodiment of Sherlock's deductions: dreadlocked hair, caramel skin, slender build, spectacles and bandaged left wrist, which was waving a set of drum sticks around like a baton and extending them perilously far through the window.  “I’ll tell ya then.  I’ve been thinking and thinking all night and day and I’ve had to face the conclusion that I like her
"Hmph."
The crop was in his left hand and he employed it to wiggle its way inside the placket.  John trailed the leather keeper down the left side of Sherlock's dick.  He could feel his gorgeous boy shudder in his arms.  John manoeuvred the keeper until it rested beneath heavy, full testicles, raising and lowering the crop's shaft to create a gentle bouncing of the balls sitting on the fold of leather.
John looks at Sherlock.  Agitated, he’d wiggled around until his leg was bent up on the seat and his gossamer shirt was worked up, exposing the abs that are heaving with his quick, panting breaths.  John places a calming hand on his stomach, another on his chest, over his heart.  “Look at me, Sherlock.”
“And what about the propane?”
Sherlock stills.  He stares intently, searching for something unknown to John.  After about a million thundering heartbeats, his face relaxes into something more open and vulnerable than John has ever witnessed.  “You, John.  Just you.”
He slid a hand up John’s thigh, thumb zeroing in on one of his favourite spots when he suddenly lost his rhythm –
“Grrrrrrrrgh”
Clothing launches over John’s shoulder as he complies.  He checks himself and pauses for a moment, standing patiently at ease before the bed, offering Sherlock a chance to study what he beholds.  Regardless of Sherlock’s impatience, John knows he will need to observe and inspect.  He holds for another breath before his body decides any further scrutinising can wait until later.  He circles Sherlock’s ankle, thumbing the hollow alongside his Achilles.  He sees the hairs rise on his shin.  “Goose pimples.”
Sherlock carefully adjusted the swing’s height in the water so that John was low enough to suck his cock.  He quickly stripped off his Speedos and got on the inner ledge of the spa and gently tilted John’s head back.
Sherlock fully meant to honour his agreement with John and go to his lesson, it’s just that he hoped to distract John well enough that the lesson would go by without anyone remembering to mention it.  He felt, given his tools, fairly confident he could achieve this, and if not, there was always the back-up plan he’d arranged with one of his homeless network…
“Calm down, John” Sherlock said cluelessly.  “Despite Juan obviously being extremely interested in my physical charms I’m not interested in him, if that’s what’s irking you.  I’m not into smooth.  Smooth is boring.  I like tetchy and bossy” he teased as they stripped down and changed.  Apparently this was not the time for teasing, or pointing out the obvious .  John’s simmer notched up to a rolling boil.
“What do you mean, John?” This said with raised brow and a perfect pout.
than one night?”
John moaned and let his head flop back.
“OK John” Sherlock said despondently.  He worried his bottom lip with his teeth as he obediently entered the store.  John placed a hand in the small of Sherlock’s back and led him past the racks of bathers and straight to the change rooms.
He thrust faster.  He wanted so badly to mark Sherlock as his own, his head nearly melted at the idea of placing his claim on his love.  And it’s that thought that had him shattering outward, ever expanding, pouring himself into his mate marking him as his.
“Yes.”
All week Sherlock had been measuring, mixing, heating, dipping, rinsing and (with the diligent application of a hair drier) drying those Speedos.  And that’s not all.  Just to be safe he took a fine grade rasp to the inside surface of the groin panel, gently teasing the fibres into surrendering their elasticity.  And lastly he used the edge of a nail file to threaten the integrity of the tensile strength of the side seams.  And as tickled with himself as that made him at the time, in the wake of John’s thoughtful announcement Sherlock was nervously second-guessing himself.
“Jooohhn.  I fancy you something rotten.  I simply can not go another day without my lips on you.  Can we please go home and shag ourselves stupid?”
He closes his eyes and draws in as much breath as he can, sampling the air for their scent, drawing the very marrow of their pairing out of the air and into his lungs where he can hold it deep within.  His eyelids fill with sparkles as his lungs beg for release.  He opens his eyes and sees Sherlock watching him.  Without a word, Sherlock leans in and covers John’s mouth with his own, coaxing it open, and takes John’s exhalation for his own.
“Listen to that reggae.  Remember last week’s Bob Marley?”
John positively lost sight of his own balls.  But when Sherlock teased into John’s vicinity,
John’s mouth hung fully open. No sound emerged. A fly might have flown by.
Sherlock tugged on the string and John ripped the waistband down as far as he could get it but his chest impeded the journey.  “Hang on and lift one leg for me”.  Sherlock huffed a laugh and cocked a leg up so John could stretch the togs all the way off until they hung around one knee.  “Thank fuck.  Now give me back your cock and tilt forward”.
John received a wink and a lowered voice.  “Coming, John...”
“He hasn’t played a jazz standard in over two days.  He’s had an argument with his father and is sulking.”
“John.”
“So… no frogs”
The weekend was a mishmash of heaven and hell.  Saturday morning had Sherlock convinced drummer boy had met a girl.
John leaves a goodly amount of spit on Sherlock’s hole and presses in a finger. “So we’re clear on this?” John asks in a low voice, eyes never leaving their mission . “If I fuck you now, next Tuesday you’re going to voluntarily leave the flat, without whining, with bathers I deem appropriate, and travel across town to attend a swimming lesson so that I don’t have to worry about you drowning next time you decide to jump in The Thames, hmmm?” John removed his finger and whilst watching the target carefully, pressed in two.
“Yeah, why wouldn’t he.  It’s all so evident.  Seriously, though, some of these other things are a bit of a guess, surely ”
“Look at me, John.”  John dragged his eyes away from the Trex.  Sherlock was flushed and his eyes were sparkling at John, begging him to trust him.  Suddenly John was right there in the moment with him.
“Well I guess I could have reached around and pulled on your balls…”
the bloody poetry, you know.  The way you were moving your body on that dance floor was poetry in every sense of the word”
types of piercings?  Surely you mean three.”  John points to Sherlock’s brow, nose and lip.  The git lifts one corner of his mouth, his confidence back in a big way.
John grunts and performs the miracle of holding on for another four thrusts before he blessedly feels Sherlock clamp down and keen.  He thumbs Sherlock’s cheek with a trembling hand, and watches as Sherlock spurts his climax across John’s chest, wide eyes locked on his.  Another two thrusts and he’s flying, muscles straining, chest heaving, hearing nothing and feeling everything.

LONDON  NW1 6XE
“A case I worked for my brother.  Mycroft knew he had a double agent passing secrets to Korea but couldn’t figure out how the information was getting out.  It was ingenious in its simplicity - he was getting the drummer in a jazz club he frequented to play an encoded beat for a Korean agent who was working behind the bar.  I was surprised Mycroft didn’t figure it out himself, frankly.”
“Oh that’s good John, because I needed to talk to you about that, too.  I’ve gained permission to use that pool and-“
So with a few nervous giggles, they worked together to get Sherlock into the swing.  John spoke soothingly to him when Sherlock tensed up and went to baulk or thrash in fear.
He looked over at Sherlock, who was pulling a familiar item out of the bag.  “Sherlock… why is the Trex here?  You’re

Sherlock had spent a lifetime pushing down and training away
“You want
“Sheer?”
“Oh, found a sense of humour now, have we?”
Sherlock starts to feel uncomfortable with what he’s done.  John was so wild for him last night, and so sweet this morning.  He really should make a call to stop Plan B.  The least he can do for his cutie is take the damn lesson.  Torn and undecided, the closer they get to their destination the more fidgety Sherlock becomes.
“Wot?  That’s it?  Have nothing to say any more?  I’m outa here.  I’ve got Les Mis to prep for so just bugger off back to 221b to your poncey violin, and take your bloody doctor with ya”
Needless to say Sherlock felt every single bit as sexy as he looked.  This was evident in the way he channelled Naomi Campbell, sashaying down the hallway in a Red Blaze (yes, it required capitals, believe me) toward a sadly unsuspecting John, whose eyes nearly bugged out of his head.  Twice.
bondage.  It appears your Tibetan throat chanting helped centre your focus, and allowed you to overcome both your televisual distractions and your captors.  I’m always trying to pre-empt any possibility of escape in my restraints and suspensions, and any little titbit of information that may help elevate the experience felt by my (completely voluntary!) captives would be much appreciated.

“Are you going to come to class next week?”
“Lift up a little, love, I need to get-“
Sherlock sidled up to his slack-gobbed captain, threw out one hip with a hand on it, leant forward from said hip into John’s panting space and…
rouge lipstick that would drive John wild, the
Sherlock reached beneath John’s body and lifted his love to him.  John wrapped his arms and legs trustingly around Sherlock as he backed up to the bench seat in the water.  Wriggling back onto the ledge, still deeply connected, Sherlock gathered John to him sweetly.  They stared at each other in the quiet lassitude.
Now this was not the first time these boys had kissed with lipstick involved but it was the first time they had
"How droll, John.  I
“How’s that?”
“Mmmmn?”  John stares at that little ball, nestled under Sherlock’s lip.  His tongue darts out to moisten his own lips.  Sherlock groans.
It’s a sacred dance, an inviolable connection.
“…Ahh… did you get the Trex?”
“Me too, John!”
“Listen, stop pacing and come back here,” John held out his hand toward Sherlock in a beseeching manner, hoping his pouting-John look would return him to his former position, and for a moment John thought he’d succeeded.  Sherlock dropped to his knees between John’s legs and grabbed both his hands and yanked.  Twice.
“But you said you were marri-“
Dear Mr Holmes,
As he gazed up at the window in awe, Sherlock’s smile widened into a full-on shit-eating grin.  He turned excitedly to John.  “Oh yes, YES!  The game has a new player, John.”
"Yes you are."
Lestrade.  And he told you the coppers can’t do anything about it because the bastard doesn’t play after ten at night and eleven on weekends.  And he also pointed out that you play your violin all through the night sometimes and no one has ever complained about you.  He probably has a valid point”
“But what’s wrong, John?  Why aren’t we taking the lesson?”
"Uh, oh John... well, the subject is King George IV, although at the time of sitting he was The Prince of Wales, Prince Regent.  The uh... John that's too... oh it's not... err, Lawrence was painting his profile, which was intended for a medal that was never struck, he... nnnf!  God I - ohhhh, Johnnn...  "
Juan posed before them in all his cocky caramel perfection.  John noted arms of smooth, muscled skin – were there only two of them? – legs that ended in a disgustingly perky arse, and a face made up of parts sensuous enough to melt pants.
eyes.  Silvery-green eyes rimmed with smudged kohl glint at him, peering down a nose decorated with a ring in the left nostril.  Seeing John’s expression, an eyebrow punctured with a spiked flex rises knowingly, as a mouth smirks up at one side: a mouth whose bottom lip is penetrated by a ring, a captive ball nestled lovingly against the plump lower edge.  Purple chalk slashed through his artfully messy locks, giving him a thoroughly debauched bedhead.  All in all, Sherlock is hottestfuckingsexJohncouldeverimagine-on-legs.
And seeing how he affected John made Sherlock…
John watches as Sherlock smirks and rolls onto his back.  Pink fills his cheeks as he sees the perfect ring of lipstick around the base of Sherlock’s cock.  Sherlock notices and chuckles deep in his chest.  “I’ve never come so hard, John.  You were perfect”.  He busses John’s nose with a kiss.
“John, do you know how many times I’ve regretted saying that?  About seventy five times a day, from three hours after I said it.  Running across rooftops with you was more exciting than ANYTHING I’d ever done with another living person until then.  I immediately wanted to take it back but I thought your natural tenacity would override the need.  Your fortitude and persistence with women, despite my every effort at sabotage, I thought, would mean you would try again, negating my need to retract that detestable statement, but no.  Your stubbornness worked against me, and thus, I am forced to admit I was an idiot.  A huge, ridiculous idiot!  I regret ever uttering that hateful statement that stopped you thinking of me as a sexual being, as someone who might want to be with you…..  As someone who might have a chance with you.”
Sherlock ducked back into his room before reappearing with said laptop.  “Here you go, John”
feeling.  He hummed a few bars as he rocked and swung into the gorgeousness prostrated before him, and both of them got their reggae on, thinking
He’s here in the pool.
“Actually Sherlock, scrap that request.  I think I just went off-grid for a second there”  He rubbed his palms up and down Sherlock’s thighs.  “It’s just that I miss you from our bed and I’m probably a tiny bit jealous of the time you’re spending on whatever you’re doing.  I’m actually really looking forward to Tuesday.  You’ve got my curiosity piqued.  As to the swimming, we’re going to take it nice and easy and there’ll be no pressure on you at all.  I’d like it if you could float by the time we leave but if that’s not possible then we’ll just take our time and revisit, and keep at it until you can. OK?”
“Interestingly, the lifespan of sperm can actually be extended when ejaculated into warm water, such as in baths, spa pools, warm springs etc.  You see, the proteins in the semen-“
“I don't know what that means Sherlock, but come and roll
, Sherlock.
“Then shove back so I can sit up.  I want to kiss you again.”
Sherlock caught his breath and opened his eyes to see John grinning up at him licking his lips.  It made him hard again already.  He leaned forward and kissed him, drew back and nuzzled him and breathed in deeply.  “Oh John, your lips smell like come”
“I may need t' research f'rther.  I could test out items eleven through tw'nty-five on you.”
“Look at you, Sherlock!  You’ve only got the sling strap under your waist now.  I’m so proud of you.  How do you feel?”
At John’s silence, Sherlock laid his head in John’s lap and clutched at his hips and whispered, “Please, John.  Don’t be upset that I want to float your spunk.”
Sherlock’s agenda demanded he lead this scenario but the delicious temptation to follow John’s order was too much for him.  Dressed in all his fiery finery he felt feminine and fucking gorgeous and he just wanted to please John in whatever way John desired.  He
“Ha!  Knew that’d snap you out of it!  Of course I don’t doubt you.  I’ve known you too long and have seen you solve too many cases to doubt you, you big idiot.”  He leaned in and pressed a sweet kiss to Sherlock’s indignant lips.
Things had gone quiet.  John looked at Sherlock and saw faint worry and what he thought may have been
John swiveled and bobbed in one dashing move, pushing his face into the opening of the breeches.  Before Sherlock could comprehend what was happening he pressed a moist kiss to said Sidecock, and dragged a slick line up it with his tongue.  Fuck he tasted good.
Before long, kisses turned to hard-core snogging, gentle touches became passionate stroking, clothing became history, and orgasms burst forth all over John’s chest and stomach.
- “John… ”
“Yes, John.  I consider myself ‘claimed’.  I am yours, lock, stock and barrel.  It’s only fair I inform you that you also, are similarly ‘claimed’.  By me.  To have and to hold, to scrutinise and inspect, to experiment on in the absence of a more stimulating subject…”
"Well I don’t know about Wickham, but I'm certainly feeling wicked, if that's close enough?" he growled against Sherlock's cheek, and gave a tiny nip to the skin of his jaw.  He could feel Sherlock's chest rising and falling rapidly, his hips shifting restlessly.  His beautiful little baggage liked being told what to do every now and then.  "Now, speaking of close enough, distract yourself by telling me what you know about this painting, Darcy."
“THEY’VE GONE SHEER, SHERLOCK!”
Sherlock laughs and moves swiftly into John’s arms, snuggling in, and it feels more right to John than anything ever has before.  This man was meant to be in his arms, was meant to be his to cherish.  He’s abruptly overcome with affection and tenderness for this brilliant, vulnerable being.  A being who is squirming in his lap, driving him to distraction.  He tries to lay still and let Sherlock explore as he wishes but the wriggling of plump arse cheeks over his extremely neglected cock is too much to bear.  He grabs the lovely handfuls and squeezes and kneads until a moan erupts from his lover’s chest.  “John, please, there’s lube in the second drawer.  Please put it to good use.”
It worked.  Sherlock smiled.  “Oh you have no idea.  I’ve been thinking about it all week.”  He paused.  “I know I’m not floating on my own yet but I also know I’ve achieved much more than I would have with anyone else.  Thank you for being so patient, John.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“As of this morning he wants me to go to Djibouti to see about some lady bug.  I told him to bug-her off.”
The fly decided the cavern of John’s mouth looked good enough for a summer holiday and tried to touch down on John’s bottom lip. “Spth! Ugh. Bloody hell, Sherlock. What in god’s name do you think you’re playing at?!”
He pushed a stunned Sherlock through a cubicle door and locked it firmly behind them.  He started shrugging off his shirt as Sherlock watched in surprise.
“John…” he hesitated.  John could hear the frown between Sherlock’s eyebrows.  He smiled.
Silence
John leant forward and laid a quick peck on Sherlock’s cheek before drawing slightly back to peer down at his own cock clutched in his hand. He marked time around Sherlock's entrance, ringing the pucker with his swollen head before marching slowly forward until seated to the hilt.
“Nope,” he responds, popping the ‘p’ in honour of his beloved.
Unexpectedly John feels an extra hand in his crotch.  His eyes spring open to find Sherlock lazily gazing at him through slitted lids.  Sherlock, seeing the Speedos still very much in evidence, mentally shrugs and decides to go with Plan B.
his man.  Does Sherlock realise this?  His fingers tighten around plush arse cheeks as he frets over this newest concern.  He hears a very put-upon sign.
“How?”
“I’m going to fuck you fast and hard now, Sherlock”, he murmured. “And I’m not going to stop until I fuck my come into you. Then I’m going to suck that stunning cock until you gift me every drop you’ve got.” John skimmed a hand up Sherlock’s stomach and across his chest. “Then, my tall tasty cake, I’m going to pull up those tiny little silky black shorts you so stupidly brought here to taunt me with, and I’m going to take your hand and make you walk home naked but for them under your Belstaff, with your cock hanging out the front and my come dripping out the back.” Sherlock trembled against John’s chest and his fingers clawed at the wall. John didn’t think either of them could get much more wound up.
that, he wondered.  He took his empty cup over to the sink and piled it in with all the others.
“I think I am,” John whispers.  “For being way too transparent.”  He pushes a handful of notes toward the front of the cab and looks at Sherlock.  “Come on, you.  Let’s get upstairs.  I want to unwrap my new boyfriend.”
“John,” he protested weakly, “you won’t like it if I go out there with an erection”
"But- oh, well it's all a matter of perspective, John.  Sir Thomas was criticised for being too flattering in his portrayal of the Prince, as he was known to be overweight and... that's so...  it was said to be too elegant a likeness but - uh – oh oh oh ohhh - the perspective of the artist is...the perspective, the perspective, John.  John.  Please."
“John?”  Sherlock teased his fingers over John’s forearms.
“What are
“Yes John! I will. I promise”
Bloody hell.  “Where’s my laptop?”
“Come up here and let me suck you then.  Let me take the edge off, Sherlock”
“OK John, you can come out now”
Sherlock sensed his sleeve may have contained a bigger trick than he originally thought. He was starting to deduce he’d shorted-out John’s brain. Time for a re-boot, perhaps. He put on his best coy look lowered his head and fluttered a lash.
Of course, where they were involved, nothing could be simple.  Just as Sherlock was starting to get that glazed look in his eye that indicated boredom - approximately four minutes after arrival - John noticed the detective's attention sharpening.  His distraction was such that John had to apologetically answer for him several times as they were introduced around by the host.  Having reached his limit, John excused them and steered Sherlock toward a quiet corner, only to be informed that one of the footman-dressed waiters was relieving the guests of their valuables.  Unfortunately his and Sherlock's idea of a 'quiet resolution' to this situation differed greatly, and now they were the only guests remaining after the boisterous tackling of the ‘footman’, the recovery and redistribution of the pelf, the formal arrest and giving of statements, and the trickling away of shocked and/or excited guests.
“Mmmm?”
“ ‘How much’ is a relative term, John”
“Sherlock,” he started, “we need to go to the office first today to meet the manager.  I’ve arranged a private lesson for you and she’s going to introduce us to your instructor before we begin, OK?”
“You said that two hours ago” John grumbled.
Sherlock’s eyes narrow.  The perceptive organs shift over John’s body quickly.  His mouth tightens.  Leaning forward, he drops his head down to John’s ear and with lips touching the whorls, murmurs, “It is, you know”.
“Think about what you were like at sixteen, Sherlock”
“Yes, John.  This is quite gay.”
“I’m going to fill you with my spunk, Sherlock.  And you’re going to rub yourself, but only on the outside of the bathers, and don’t come yet.”
“Don’t try to be bloody demure with me! You know exactly what I mean. Those shorts, they’re… they- they’re… "
Finding himself standing in a bit of an hypnotic Homer stupor at the display rack as he recalled his encounter with The Black Shorts of Sex, John found himself zombie-shuffling toward the counter with a pair of Speedos in bright red.
“Lay back against the headboard, John.”
“Sorry,” John pats a pale thigh absently, “just quietly having an epiphany.”
“Ya really wanna know?”  The kid pulled the netting aside and leaned out the window.  John gasped and Sherlock gritted out
Grey eyes popped up, and a toussled head swivelled toward John.  “It’s true.  Well, depending on your diet, that is.  Sometimes is sinks if it’s thin and watery.”
“SHERLOCK!  WHAT THE BLOODY HELL HAVE YOU DONE TO MY BOLLOCKING CREDIT CARD?!  TESCO’S REFUSED IT FIVE TIMES AND I HAD TO LEAVE EVERYTHING THERE AT THE COUNTER.  EVEN THE
whilst simultaneously swirling his tongue around and around inside the vacuum. Sherlock started panting and thrashing and squealing into the towel. John had trouble staying with him as his arse jiggled and wriggled against his face but he attacked Sherlock’s hips in a pincer move and relentlessly drove his tongue forward, never giving quarter.
“You, John?”
to feel his mark on his lover.  “Sherlock!” he panted.  “Quickly!  Get the fucking drawstring undone.  I need to touch you.  I need to feel
“A-about two hours after I observed your reaction to the one d-decorating that exotic dancer in the smuggling case last month.  John please…”
“Sherlock, is this leading somewhere, love?”
dressed to the left until I heard your breathing change as you watched my posterior earlier.  Your panting made my transport decide to re-dress itself northward, John.  It's your fault the line of my pants is less than perfect."
He’s Sherlock.
A moist mouth consulted his cock and found it in need of some major satisfaction.  Sherlock’s head bobbed gently giving John much, much pleasure.  John sighed again, dropped his head back against the cubicle wall and placed his hands on Sherlock’s head, caressing the soft curls.
“No case?”
Most children seek approval from their parents, but especially from their fathers.  The fact that he plays reggae in the early afternoon when mothers are more often than not home, and saves the more difficult jazz pieces for later in the evening when fathers are traditionally home leads me to believe his mother is the parent of Caribbean origin, his father is a British jazz lover and he plays music they love in the hope of impressing or pleasing them.
John reached up and pulled Sherlock’s head towards him.  He touched lips with the only man he’d ever loved and nodded.  “Come on, Sherlock.  I’m all yours.”
“In a bit, can we use the spa, do you think?”  God, John
“I need… please-" The towel must have been removed.
“Mmmm.  I’m going to be thinking about you in those Speedos while I’m waiting for you”
"It's lucky I love your pouty-face.  In fact, if you come over here and put that pout on me I'll cook your favourite dinner."
John placed his hands reverently on those luscious globes and gently pressed his thumbs inward to spread Sherlock’s cheeks revealing the sweet pucker within. Again John paused, this time just to reflect and let his brain absorb all that he was thankful for. How on earth was he lucky enough to be here in this tiny cubicle with this lanky angel, being momentarily in command of said angel no less? John thanked someone for small mercies, then stopped musing and like the good tiny tyrant we know he is, he
John thinks of Sydney.  “How on earth did you know it would trigger-“
"Huh," Sherlock panted breathlessly, "does that make you Wickham, in those regimentals?"
For science, eh?  Hmmm.
“Don’t be boring, John.  It shows-off the musculature of your chest.  If you’ve got it, flaunt it.  Now…” he claps his hands together and holds the fingertips under his chin, gazing speculatively at John’s hair.
“I can’t wait to see you on my cock, John.”
"Sidecock?"
John H Watson
He cocks one eyebrow at his cutie, “Oh Johnnnn…”  he teases as he tugs the Speedos languidly from John’s grasp.  “What fun we had with these. Are you looking forward to seeing me in them again today?”  Outrageously, Sherlock drapes them over his face and inhales deeply.  “Mmmm.  I can smell us both, John.  I think I might need some encouragement for my lesson, John.  A bit of incentive to attend, hmm?”
John had been staring so hard at himself in the mirror, so wrapped up in feeling out of place in the very tailored, very fashionable clothes Sherlock had left on his bed, that he had completely missed the fact that Sherlock himself was dressed to kill.  Skin tight, midnight blue, arse-hugging jeans ending in boots that look so expensive John can only imagine how many people worked on them by hand.  Polished to a deep burnish, the leather hugs his feet lovingly.  The tips are covered in pointed metal toes studded with spikes, while chains hang in loops between the top eyelet and the centre-back of the heel.  When Sherlock lifts his foot to pivot into the bathroom John spies a traditional Japanese samurai image embedded in the sole in colour.  How expensive do shoes have to be to have patterns burned into the bloody sole?!
The dreadlocks are more what I imagine you would consider a ‘guess’, John, but I have concluded that it is highly likely given the probable nature of his hair from his mother’s side, its ‘nappy’ tendency to kink readily, the fact that dreadlocks are a rebellious thing to get considering their relatively modern association with Rastafarianism and pot-smoking which would make them almost irresistible to a moody, hormonal, rebellious, teenaged boy who plays the drums.”
“I want to feel you come around me so badly, John”
John looked uncomfortable.  “No.  I’m sorry.  I should have thought it through a bit better before we started but I’ve fixed it and everything should go better now.  You’ll be floating and paddling in no time” John smiled hopefully.
While John is struggling with reality vs fantasy, Sherlock leans in, busses a kiss on his cheek, slithers around in front of him, grabs his hand and takes off for the dance floor.  Bodies snake and twist sinuously around them, pulsing with the beat like one, huge, swaying beast, each swept up in the collective rise and fall of the tide.  Dazed, John peers up at Sherlock, transfixed at the sight of the diaphanous fabric clinging to Sherlock’s febrile frame.  Sweat already runs down his body, forging a glistening path between his pectoral muscles.
“Run, Sherlock.”
“Unhg”. The curious fly did another lap past John’s gaping mouth.
“Oh shite” he mumbled.
The lanky, sinuous gazelle simpers at John over his shoulder.  He starts singing the chorus softly, running his hands down his sides, over the torn shirt back, stopping at his undulating arse cheeks,
“Sherlock!  Thank God you’re home – get in here.  This gear you left on my bed…..I can’t go out in this!  I look like a tosser.”  John tugs uncomfortably at his shirt, and tries to dig a finger under the centre seam of his trousers, which are trying to migrate up his arse, taking his pants along for the journey.
by capture, rather than
“John, please let me assure you that if it was only data I was after, I could have picked up any random for that.”
“Oh god yes, John.  Please.”
Sherlock’s neck swivelled.  “What?”
was relaxing
“No no no it’s not like that.  We’re not here to complain” Sherlock waved his arms about frustratedly.
“I was just too juiced-up on jealousy to put it all together”
there, together”.
“-ugh tell me to wear, John. I’ll wear arm bands if you want!”
Sherlock, touched by John’s thoughtfulness, smiled widely and grabbed his hand, lacing their fingers and pushing them into his coat pocket.  John felt the infamous red Speedos lining the pocket of the Belstaff.
“John.  You were doing quite well.  You were relaxed and easy, watching me move, running your eyes over me, thinking about running your hands over me.  Probably remembering a time you wanked over the same fantasy – Australia, I’d say, going by the song that’s playing and your recollection of our case down there – and you were having quite a nice shiver at the memory when that burst of water brought you to your utterly ridiculous senses and you tensed-up and (quite falsely) recalled this is all fake and that I’m not really looking at you with lust and desire, but am appropriating a mirage in order to fool some hitherto unknown criminal lurking out there somewhere in order to work a case.”  He draws in a much needed breath.  “A case which…” and here The Voice lowers even more, “…doesn’t…exissst”.
John made himself a cup of tea and wandered over to the window.  The day looked gloomy out there.  Absently, he watched some birds fighting over something on the rooftop across the street.  Nothing much case-wise lately either, although Sherlock, surprisingly, wasn’t being difficult about it.  Why
to be John’s beautiful bitch.
Sherlock, I just wondered what… never mind, I don’t think I want to know”
Juan flicked his eyes between John and Sherlock a few times.  “Oooookaaaay.  Bery interethting.  I thall enjoy to be inthructing you together, yeth?”
Sherlock, starting to panic that he hadn’t done enough to seduce the pants off John, renews his efforts at seduction.  Releasing John’s arse, he slides his hands to his hips and spins him around.  John flails his arms out for balance and Sherlock takes the opportunity to crowd him from behind, snaking his arms under John’s, thrusting his knee between John’s thighs, rolling his hips to the beat until his entire thigh insinuates itself up against John’s balls.
John’s head finally inches away from the mirror, following Sherlock’s progress down the hall.  His mouth falls open; what was Sherlock wearing?!  Or perhaps he should wonder, ‘what was wearing Sherlock’?  He’d thought his own clothes were close-fitting but this get-up was so tight it brought new meaning to the word.  If it squeezed him much firmer Sherlock’d transform to diamond.
“What, just…sating your curios-“
“That’s it, sweetheart; take what you want.  Make it feel good.”
From that moment on Sherlock’s attitude to the crashing and banging performed an about-face.  It was as if he’d taken the kid under his metaphorical wing, and waited eagerly for practice to begin to see what had transpired each day.
John gets to shucking his shirt, and sits on the edge of the bed to remove his socks.  He quickly undoes his belt and trouser button before beckoning Sherlock to him.  “Come here, gorgeous.  I want to finish unwrapping you.”
“Sherlock!  There’s another package arrived for you.  Why have I been taking delivery of packages all day?”
The cab jolts to a stop.  “OK lovebirds, who’s payin’ fer this?” grunts the cabbie.
Sherlock appeared in the sitting room with a piece of fur stuck to his finger.  “I need to dissolve this glue”
Sherlock, not used to quite this level of bossiness from his little despot, felt rather overcome.  He happily did as he was told and was rewarded with two fingers slipping right up deep where he needed them.
I was tantalised by your knowledge of knots.  I have a personal interest in the topic, and find a prusik knot particularly useful for certain… types of restraint.  I will agree that a handcuff knot is a competent tie to use, but would put a vote in for the simple column tie.  Sometimes the classics are classic for a reason.  Of course, rope type would have a significant effect on security of restraint.  A silk rope wouldn’t hold a column tie as well as jute, for example.  And a surgeon’s knot would just be gilding the lily with anything more serious than say, hemp.  It would also depend on whether your subject wished to have the means to escape their bonds or not, wouldn’t it.
John, I know that
He reaches up to stroke Sherlock’s nipple, licking his other palm and wrapping it around Sherlock’s beautiful cock.  He’s never thought of a cock as beautiful before.  It’s not a thing he’s even associated with the phrases
Sherlock shivered and trembled in his embrace.  John was feeling a little vulnerable himself.  It was as if the complete trust Sherlock had given him in the pool was still in effect and John was humbled.  He felt as if they were as intimate and open to each other as they’d ever been.
when Sherlock’s voice went all rumbly.
“Trex?!”
“Umm… well-“
In short order he swivelled and headed them off across town.
John shakes his head.  He is aghast at himself for staring so openly and lustfully at Sherlock.  Surely the detective would be noticing by now, the fact that he was acting like a besotted, drunken idiot.  They were here to do a job, and that was-  Shit!  While he was caught up in the intoxication that is pierced and kohled Sherlock, he’d completely forgotten to ask him what case they’re working!  He tilts his head to enquire only to find hooded eyes quietly intent on his face.
I never wear clothes this tight.  This is much more
“Ugh.  Tyrant.”
“Hmmmm.  Perhaps…”
“Head in the fridge.  Livers in the crisper.  A bag full of fingers.  Syphilitic-“
Moved, John rolls his sweetie over again until he’s on his side facing so that John can spoon him.  He runs a hand up and over Sherlock’s chest, pressing his palm firmly over his heart.  They fuck leisurely in the morning sunlight, tending to each other in ways only two people deeply in love can do.
“When you started babbling in the manager’s office you confirmed it for me”
“John, I read that listening to soothing, familiar music can put you at ease so I bought a waterproof speaker that will allow me to hear Bach while my ears are under the water.”  He turned it on and popped it in the water.
John lowered his head.
But all this is nothing compared to the shirt.  Oooooh the shirt.  Innocuous enough from the front – if you ignore the fact that the fluorescent lighting emanating from the bathroom renders it sheer – the back is a ladder of lateral rips and tears that shows more skin than it covers.  Waaay more.  The creamy skin of Sherlock’s endless back is there for John’s eyes to feast upon, for his imagination to
“You heard me.  Here, hang them up.”
“Maybe”
on his face.  He peered into his eyes and saw a sheen of moisture there and suddenly felt like the biggest heel on earth.
John tenderly removes his fingers and pats Sherlock on the bum.  “Hey, love, time to move.”
"Is one of those directions 'north', love, because that's how you appear to be dressed at the moment?!"
“Holy hell!  Get up here in my mouth, now.”
“What do you mean?”
“agh!”
.  He raised his hands nervously.  John grabbed them and using one hand, pinned them up against the wall as he grunted and hip-shoved Sherlock’s back to the tiles.  The other hand fell to the top of Sherlock’s head and slid lazily down over his ear and neck, shoving around to grasp his nape.  John’s face moved in close until their lips touched and whispered menacingly, “I can be smooth, Sherlock”.  Sherlock shivered.
“Don’t ‘But John’ me! I am tired of waiting out here. I’m cold and, quite frankly, starting to look weird lurking around in a change room in a pair of trunks with nowhere to go so, please. We’ve been through this again and again, and you agreed to come-"
gives John the confidence he needs to continue.
“But they’re-“
to be a paramour.”
Sherlock blinks a few times before peaceably rolling and settling, turning his face to the side.  John straddles Sherlock’s thighs and smooths his hands over the acres of perfect skin before him, before letting his lips meander a lazy path from neck to buttock.  He mentally maps the occasional freckle, marking the little beauty spots with a lick and a kiss, each too important to gloss over.
Gasping, John reached into the Belstaff and drew out the ripped, red speedos.  “I think it’s rather fitting that we clean up with this rag you created, don’t you, Sherlock?”
“FUCK.  ME!”  John roared, as he stared bug-eyed at Sherlock’s crotch.
“If you don’t get your brilliantly luscious arse over here right now, my little pancake, you’re going to miss out on the best rimming of your life that I will be administering to said arse right after you finish off what you started here not thirty minutes ago AND, NO, DO NOT SPEAK YET because I have deduced while you have been talking, that the no-doubt dreadlocked bugger two doors down has ceased drumming while you were postulating on his parentage and I would like to take advantage of the silence to get you reacquainted with your rhythm before he gets reacquainted with his.”
“Oh god yes, Sherlock”
"Look!  There's your pouty-face there right now.
“That’s great, Sherlock.  I’m looking forward to it, but-“
John's pupils widened as his breath hitched at the undulations, recalling the red-hazed moment of jealousy he'd felt as those buttocks sat atop the 'footman', Sherlock's tan-clad thighs and polished hessians straddling the fellow’s waist as he had a pair of handcuffs slipped onto his wrists by the detective clad in sartorial splendour.  Where Sherlock had those cuffs stashed was a mystery to John, as his skin-tight pantaloons, and similarly form-fitting shirt, waistcoat and dress coat left no room for anything but essentials - and even then such things as air for breathing, didn't always make the cut.
“Now, let’s pick up that lovely silvery-grey pair of Speedos that perfectly match your eyes that I spotted on the way in, and on the way home I’ll tell you all about the private lesson
To him, Sherlock’s body was like a beautiful and complicated instrument.  John had tenderly and carefully been studying, observing and nurturing his knowledge of it and now that he had mastered it he had no trouble bringing to life all the little dynamics no one else would be able to coax from it.  John acknowledged this was because Sherlock’s instrument would only ever be mastered by someone
He’s everything everywhere and it’s the combination of him and this glorious man beneath him who’s made him that way.
Facts and data were all that he needed to get through life in a semi-acceptable way.  But now that John was here, now that wonderful, accepting John was here to be patient with him and show him how to let himself feel things again, and to keep him a bit in line (which he secretly thrilled to, just a smidgeon), life was infinitely more than just semi-acceptable.  It was glorious.
“And no other amphibians of any kind?  Or llamas?  Goats?  Cheetahs, wildebeest…?”
“Sure, Sherlock.  In a bit” he murmured lazily, absently stroking.  The silence stretched comfortably.  He didn’t want this peaceful feeling to end.  Eventually Sherlock cleared his throat.
“Oh no, John.  That’s what the silicon was for.  I’ve loaded everything up with fresh batteries and reinforced the seals with caulking.  I’ve tested it all in the bathtub.  It holds under hot and cold conditions”
It seemed they were destined to always be on duty.  Tonight was supposed to be a thank you party in honour of Sherlock and himself, for the recovery of two stolen paintings.  A wealthy collector was about to place two valuable paintings on permanent loan to The National, when they had taken an unexpected detour en-route to the gallery, and the boys had been engaged to recover them.  The grateful owner threw a party in the private salon where the paintings were to be displayed - what wonders money could achieve! - and John spent the past fortnight convincing Sherlock it would be rude if the guests of honour weren't in attendance.  Admittedly, it wasn't quite as difficult once it was revealed the guests (befitting the era of the artworks) were to wear Regency period costume - Sherlock loved a good excuse to look fabulous in a tailored outfit, and off he hied to his indefatigable tailor.
Blink.  Blink.
John’s eyebrows were up in his hairline by now.  He’d never heard Sherlock use ‘sorry’ and ‘please’ in one breath, unless he was faking sincerity for manipulative purposes, but right now John could detect nothing but sincerity in Sherlock’s visage.
Flat 8C
“Ooh. I need you to fuck me, NOW”.
on my laptop?”
“I told you I was coming here to
“Agh!”  Sherlock went to jerk upright.  John was having none of it.
complexion?  I’d be interested in seeing for myself, one day.
But poor John was on overload, experiencing a whirlwind of emotions and had tuned-out Sherlock’s voice.  The cave man club beat was pulsing away harder than ever as he continued to stare startledly at Sherlock’s half-exposed cock.  But heaped on top of that was a maelstrom of feelings: relief, for one, (at not having to let Don Juan near Sherlock again) embarrassment for another, (at being about to walk out on a booking for the third week in a row) and sheer, bloody anger (what the HELL was wrong with the manufacturing industry these days, anyway?!)
Whilst begging Sherlock had started gripping John’s head and thrusting against his face and to tell the truth, John couldn’t take much more of his sweetie’s gripping and thrusting without wanting to jump him, so it was no skin off his nose to surrender to Sherlock’s request. Without standing up John grabbed Sherlock’s hips and spun him about face. He slid his thumbs into the waistband of the little black shorts and dragged them down to just below the crease of Sherlock’s buttocks. John indulged one of his cutie’s little kinks and employed his best army voice, “Bend forward and put your hands on the wall, Sherlock. Now.” Sherlock shivered all over and immediately complied. “Do you want me to lick your arse? Do you want to feel my tongue in your hole, Sherlock? Or should I spank that naughty arse for all the time it’s wasted today?”
“Ah, John… I’m almost ready, but I think there’s a thread hanging down on my bathers. It’s annoying my sensitive skin. You know how sensitive my skin is, John. Can you come in and remove it for me? Please.”
John’s brows shot to his hairline.  “Livers it is,” he deadpans.
John demonstrated his skill by drifting his fingers up and over Sherlock’s nipple.  The left one was the weak point, the chink in his armour, the one that always made him squirm.  He placed his lips on Sherlock’s neck where they felt most at home and bit his sweet spot just under his right ear, double-stopping his tongue against the flesh pinched between his teeth.
John took a small step back and fingered Sherlock’s crease to discover the sparkling end of a red-jewelled butt plug.  “Oh Sherlock.  You are soooooo wicked.  Have you made yourself ready for me, hmm?”
.  I don’t know why I didn’t think of it first-off.  We just have to find someone who can let us use their private pool”
John reaches out and gently runs a hand down Sherlock’s arm, grasping his hand and pulling it in, centring it on his chest.  “I know you’ve orchestrated everything that’s happened so far tonight,” he soothes, “but from here on in, we’re going to work as a team, OK?”  He watches Sherlock, contemplating his reaction.  If he doesn’t start-off on the right foot, Sherlock will walk all over him ‘til the end of time.
John sighed.  “No.  It’s all fine.  Go get your specimen jar.”
The good doctor was never one to look a gift horse in the mouth, and pardon the pun but that was pretty near the mark.  John licked and sucked and nibbled and slurped his way around everything he could get that mouth on until Sherlock couldn’t stand it anymore and fed his cock deep into John’s throat.
“Bloody amazing”
Yep.  “John…”
“Except my digits.  They’re all crepe-y”
Sherlock tried his very best to look shocked, but he knew from the look on John’s face that the game was up. They both also knew Sherlock wouldn’t be going out to his lesson today. The trick was played and Sherlock was about to drag in the winnings. He swiftly morphed his shock into a look of seduction, lowered his voice to a rumble and raised his hands to John’s shoulders, gently pushing him down like the unfortunate victim of a stage hypnotist. “Just how much is hanging down, John? Perhaps you can tuck it in for me?”
“Oh, that was for the blow torch”
“Hang up our coats, Sherlock,” he instructed.
So it was not too surprising that Sherlock’s plan to avoid Tuesday’s swimming lesson, which he had promised to attend without whining and in an appropriately attired manner, involved extraction from said lesson via other…
“Jesus, Sherlock.  If you can still think of words like that then I’m not doing my job properly.”
him – they roam and map John’s skin as if they were committing it to memory for future sculpting, they touch as if John’s skin were braille poetry, his elegant fingers sensitively skimming, reading the words of yearning on John’s body.  Right now, however, in the real world, as he stares so hard he goes cross-eyed, the Fingers-Of-His-Fantasies are about to make contact with the tiny pieces of plastic currently holding his modesty together.  Target acquired, Sherlock fastens the button over his collarbone, knuckles brushing his suddenly damp skin.  John shivers.
“Okay, Sherlock.  Baste me” he grinned.  Sherlock leaned forward and kissed him, touching his fingers just behind John’s balls and rubbing in slow circles.  The groany sound that came out of John was slightly embarrassing.  He was so wound up he was already halfway there.  When Sherlock’s fingers slid back and swirled around his opening he moaned into the kiss and lifted his hips in the sling.  He could feel Sherlock smile against his mouth.
For three Tuesdays now John had been pushing (and Sherlock had been pulling, like some demented tug ‘o’ war) his love into swimming lessons at the local leisure centre but to date Sherlock’s toes had failed to make contact with the water.  John was determined today was the day.
“John!  How could you be so ignorant?  Have I taught you nothing?”  Sherlock took one of his deep pre-explanation breaths before launching in at top speed:
He presses his lips to the centre of Sherlock’s chest, tracing little nips and licks across his skin.  He drags his mouth across the ivory column of his neck, stopping to nuzzle into the corded muscle as Sherlock tilts his head in encouragement.  Sweet sounds fall from his lover’s lips as he blindly reaches for Sherlock’s hands and places them on his hips, encouraging him to reciprocate.  “Touch me too, Sherlock,” he gasps.
Sherlock did a little mental happy dance.  He had never heard anything more welcome.  Under the guise of wrapping himself in the towel he lowered his head and allowed himself a small secret smile.  His little despot was reacting perfectly.  Lesson averted.  He looked up with his most innocent expression.
“Therlock, ith it?”  Sherlock froze like a deer in headlights.  Oh no, this was soooo not good.  Juan had a Spanish lispy inflection to his English.  He couldn’t imagine this was going to improve the situation any.  In fact, John was going to go ballistic.
"Beautiful.  God, I'm starting to understand why women go ape-shit over this gear.  You look like Mister fucking Darcy."
“It’s no good, John.  You know I can’t concentrate on my rhythm when there’s an alternate one – and syncopated at that – going on two doors down.”
at the moment.”  And that’s just what John

“You want…a relationship?”
"Well you'd know, Sherlock.  You're good at sulking."
“It is.  Real.”
“You look perfect, John.  I want to kiss your splendid red lips”, he whispered.
"Well I'd better help you stave that off for a bit, hmm?"
"It's hardly method, John.  Haven't you heard of gentlemen having to choose a direction in which to dress?"
Sherlock fidgeted in his chair and turned back to his microscope.  “Don’t be stupid, John.  If I wanted some of your semen I’d hardly have to ask for it.”
beats from two doors down!  As John wormed another slippery finger into the bounty before him, twirling and scissoring, receiving a decadent moan, he recognised the song and came to the conclusion that he might just be able to work
“John!  What are you doing?  And who’s Don?”
Sherlock looked down innocently, swivelling his head this way and that, making out like his cock wasn’t hanging about three inches down past the bottom hem of the black silky shorts. “What aren’t they covering, John?”
John was mesmerised by Sherlock's wantonness.  He marveled at how openly Sherlock displayed his desire so unashamedly to John, obeying his commands, trusting him unreservedly, throwing himself into the scene wholeheartedly.  It threw John into a tailspin, his breath catching, his emotions welling...  John suddenly couldn't think straight, his arms full of twisting, heaving perfection.  He babbled.
“John, home is that way” Sherlock hesitantly pointed out.  John looked determined, and a determined BAMF Army captain (even one seconded to the Navy that Tuesday) should be interrupted at the interrupter’s peril.
“-here so that we can improve the chances of you surviving the next time The Work finds you spluttering around somewhere between the surface and the depths of The Thames. I will not watch you almost drown one more time. Now come out of that change room before I come in there and drag you out.”
“Ah, John,” he started carefully, ”do you think we should explain that I only need to learn the very basics – floating and a bit of paddling – just enough so that I don’t drown John.  John.
A soft exhalation chuffed out in the silence of the gallery.
Thursday:  “Oh dear.  Medical problems.  He’s injured his hand, could be from a fight.  Possibly a fall.”
"Keep going, love"
Slightly startled at this, Sherlock faced the bed, spread his legs and bent forward whilst sliding his arms outward until his torso touched the bed, supporting his weight.   With his head turned toward John he brought his hands around to his arse cheeks and gripped, then slowly slid them down the backs of his thighs.  “Come touch me, John” he whispered in invitation.
“Where…”
He’d had a bit of a think about Sherlock’s resistance to the lessons and felt a bit ashamed when he realised that sticking an adult consulting detective in with a bunch of screaming kids was insulting to Sherlock.  It was no wonder the man held on to his pride in silence, choosing to formulate alternate methods of avoidance.  He felt terrible that he’d just barged on ahead with his plans without considering the bigger picture so he’d mentally revised and booked Sherlock into a private one-on-one lesson.
I also can’t help but wonder at the length and breadth of experience you might possess when a reverse cowgirl is considered, ‘simple’.  This intrigues me.  Greatly.
“’Please’ what, Sherlock?” John hummed against his arse, continuing to plunge.
with the tight clothing and music and everything, but it was all in aid of a desperate, final attempt at cracking your resolve.  To attract you to me.  To see if you might…want me enough to…to go for it.  Uggggghhhh!”  Sherlock tugs at his own hair in frustration.  “John, you’re making me crazy and there’s only so much a man can take!  Of course I want a relationship!  I just don’t want to push for more than you want to give and I’m frightened I’ve misjudged and I’ll scare you off completely!”
“Yeah?  Well you can both piss-off.  Tough luck if my drumming’s bothering you.  I live here now so you’re gonna have to get used to it, yeah?”
“FUCK”
One perfect set of puckered lip prints in the same rouge lipstick lay like a brand on an otherwise exquisitely white nether cheek.  John’s cock sprung to full attention.  His eyes glazed over and his mind drifted back to last night and just how those lip prints got there…..
“Oh JohnJohnJohn just a tiny bit
John takes one last, long suck and smiles as he hears a soft whine.  He gently pushes Sherlock back enough to stand, grip his hips and reverse their positions.  “Lay back on the bed, gorgeous.”  Sherlock reclines languidly, throwing one arm above his head, running the other down his stomach provocatively.  “God, you’re a picture.  Look at you," he marvels.  "You’re fucking enchanting.”  He reaches under Sherlock and peels his jeans down the endless legs, stripping his socks too, until his sweetheart is completely bare.  He eyes the piercings glinting in the ambient light, winking at him in invitation.  “I’m dying to kiss you, but I don’t want to hurt your mouth.”
The thought forces a growl from John’s throat as he lunges to capture the head between his lips, suckling gently and running his tongue across the slit.
ever know.  You’ve just spent a week telling me about the life of a kid we’ve never met just by listening to him play the drums, for god’s sake.  I mean, it may all be rubbish…….”
“John.  Get those trousers off, then get down here and kiss me
“Oh God, John.  It's so…” He tips his head back down to ensnare John in his gaze.
“Really, Sherlock?  You want to…”
yours (quite yet),
“Mmmmm?” John shook his head like a dog trying to wrestle away a bone and gave a little growl.
“Sherlock.”
Negotiation time. “Hmmm.”
There was a tense silence, where only the soft sounds of their panting could be heard.  They stared at each other as they slowly calmed.
John smiled to himself, and dropped his head to hide it.  As he tried to control his breathing he caught a glimpse of movement out of the corner of his eye.  He cranked his head to the right almost imperceptibly and nearly lost his shit.  His eyes almost bugged out of his head before quickly looking up at Sherlock's face to search for a reaction, but the man was stalwartly staring at the Lawrence.  John let his eyes drop back to the slack hanging placket of Sherlock's breeches, the lax opening allowing a delicious visual of tantalising Sherlockian Sidecock.
Without looking up Sherlock said, “If you stay like that for much longer, John, I’ll think you’re broken and may have to trade you in for a less defective model.”  He finally looked up and smirked, “Although I can think of some interesting things to pop into that mouth whilst it’s open…”
in the water.
“Ooooh John.  That feels pretty”
Sherlock hesitated.  He wanted to be able to last inside John and at this rate he’d blow before he got half way in.  John made a little whimper again and that was it.  Sherlock slowly worked out the toy and tenderly worked in the new, bigger one.  John squirmed and opened for him.  The toy popped in and he started it humming on a low speed.
“At all?”
“Petrified, John.  Don’t move away!  Stay with me!”
“Uuuuhh…”
A lovelier, more alluring cock John has never seen.  Long and generous, blushing with distension, the rosy head cradles a lustrous drop of essence.  For the first time in his life John finds himself aching to taste.  It seems Sherlock is destined to claim so many of John’s firsts.  No!  Not firsts -
person before, John.”  He leaves a beat.  “That may preclude any non-living thing…”
“Sherlock, that looks like a sex swing”
The drumming had been an at least twice-daily occurrence since new neighbours had moved in two weeks ago.  It was annoying, to be sure, but it seemed to bother Sherlock more than himself.  He was working on tuning it out, although as he’d said, the playing was quite good.  It’s just that, in his opinion, it would be a bit less like banging and more like music with a couple of other instruments participating.  If he couldn’t talk Sherlock around somehow he was going to have to resort to slipping earplugs in when he was distracted, or possibly slip on the ear hat.
So Monday evening saw Sherlock leave John at the kitchen table, plugging away at his two-fingered blogging while he quietly slunk down the hallway and shut himself in their room.
“Jesus, Sherlock.  Could you have used another method?”
“What on earth’s happening here?!” John laughed, looking up at Sherlock.  His laughter died a slow death.
“Sherlooock” John warned.
“Ha!  Sherlock, I doubt anything will last long in the water”
“Oh John.  Between us and our immediate families where else is she going to find more people to talk to?” he whispered, without taking his eyes from the window.
“Jesus, Sherlock.”
Over the next hour John got Sherlock to let his head tilt back until his chin was up and his ears were under the water.  His hands being busy under his beautiful boyfriend’s body, John gentled him verbally, urging him to listen to the music, deliberately calling the piece by the wrong name so that Sherlock would correct him.  Eventually he relaxed enough for John to encourage him to let his legs bend at the knees and sink slightly so that John could remove his hand that was under Sherlock’s hip.  They celebrated that milestone with a five minute sub-aquatic feel-up, just gentle fingers drifting over pearly skin at leisure.  After another twenty minutes and lots of petting and reassuring, Sherlock agreed that John could remove the hand under the base of his neck.
for Sherlock’s words to come. Sherlock’s training in this was coming along nicely. It didn’t take too long today. No more than about nine seconds.
“Oh God”
"Yep, the one with-
“Oh God.”
“Your fucking cock, Sherlock! Your beautiful, gorgeous piece of man meat, my graceful little swan. It is hanging down the leg of those utterly improper shorts and you know it”.  John still stared, transfixed, at the offending appendage poking out of its aperture.
“John? John!”
“I could tell you were going to take an early bow, and I wasn’t sure of your thoughts on encores, so I forestalled you with distraction.”
“Yes,
John gazes at newly-minted boyfriend.  He’s never heard Sherlock dwindle-off.  Sherlock always makes Statements with a capital S.  To see him unsure and slightly bewildered is disconcerting, but to know he feels comfortable enough to expose that in front of
“Ah well, that’s the beauty of a lock, stock and barrel arrangement, Sherlock," he grins gently as he strokes.  "It means you can experiment to your heart’s content, love.  Or at least until you run out of stimulus.”
"Ooh…"  Sherlock panted and shook as he felt John gently unhitch the wrist loop from around his balls.  He heard the crop clatter against the floor.  He felt John's hands smooth up his stomach and over his pectorals, coming to rest over his heart, cupping the thud under his palms.  He could feel John rest his cheek between his shoulder blades then, after a while, press a kiss to the nape of his neck, nosing his queue out of the way.
“Oooooooh John.  That feels even prettier”
Sherlock beams at John before slithering from the cab, leaving John to follow dazedly in his wake.
had trouble putting under the bed until the time was right.
“I listen to you John.  And I never delete anything to do with you” Sherlock sung out from the bedroom.
“John?”
“Won’t be long now, John”
I find myself fascinated to learn how you escaped
Sherlock is burning up inside, John’s finger snug in the tight channel, his other hand petting along Sherlock’s back.  He cautiously pulls out a little before pushing back in, deeper than before and draws a shudder from his beloved.  John works his finger slowly, slowly, never giving too much, keeping it easy until time floats by and Sherlock starts to grind back against his hand.  When he’s up to three fingers, it gets a little difficult to keep the angle right, and Sherlock is getting more demanding with his undulations.
He crooked his fingers and turned his hand so that only the backs of his knuckles skimmed Sherlock's delicious Sidecock.  His right hand rose to run through curls, tugging until a few spilled from the elegant queue.  "Look at you, you juicy thing, you!  Looking all wanton and dishevelled for me.  Your cheeks are all flushed, your-" he bit down on the tendon standing out on Sherlock's neck, "-neck is straining, you're absolutely panting for me to let you come, aren't you," John whispered against his ear.  Sherlock groaned around the leather keeper and ground his hips back against John.
He took himself in hand and pushed gently into the pinch of his lover’s skin.  He slipped in smoothly until he was buried to the hilt, groaning at the exquisite welcoming warmth.  “Oh god oh god Sherlock.  There’s nothing in the world like the feel of you.”
A soft
“I need to hold you, John”
Just then they arrive at the centre.  Shrill voices emerge from inside.  As they’re about to step up to pay a small boy runs gleefully under the turnstile, chasing after something moving so quickly it’s just a green streak.
As breathing calmed, two sets of eyes stared down at the white mess of John’s torso.  Silence reigned as two mouths pursed thoughtfully.  You can guess which mouth’s silence broke first…
doing with it?” he asked, checking he had enough cash for Tesco’s.  “Why’s my credit card not in here?”
Sherlock nods, meekly moving through the door, arse-wiggling abandoned for now.  John follows, closing the door tight, and turns to find Sherlock kicking off his shoes.  He removes his quickly, too, before stepping into Sherlock’s sphere.  “Here, let me…”  John skims open the buttons fastening Sherlock’s cobweb-fine shirt, holding his gaze.  As the last button slides free John ever-so-slowly peels back the left-hand side, and allows himself to glance down.  He draws in a sharp breath at the sight of a snug, glistening little bar piercing.  John smiles to see it’s not just any ordinary bar, but a custom job; a wee striped bee at one end, six tiny off-set honeycomb hexagons at the other.  Pouting between is Sherlock’s rosy nipple, raised and proud, begging for attention.  “How long have you had this?” John croons, touching his little finger to it, mesmerised at the skin’s reaction to his caress.
“More stimulating!” John squawks.
Sherlock hissed around the crop as John continued to run the backs of his curled fingers up and down the side of the now leaking cock.  "Come on, Sherlock.  I know you're close.  (kiss)  You're going to come for me soon.  (kiss, kiss, stroke)  I want you to ruin those bloody breeches for me.  I want you to come all over my fingers and the crop handle.  (kiss, stroke, grind)  I want to see you lose it here in the salon of the National Gallery, with me kissing your neck and barely running my fingers up and down your delicious Sidecock.  (kiss, grind, grind, stroke)  Come on, baby, show me what you've got.  When I say, you're going to lower your head so we can give your balls some slack, and then you're going to spill everywhere for me, aren't you?"  Sherlock nodded frantically.  "OK, love, slowly now, (stroke, stroke, grind, grind) there you go, lower your head further, that's it (kiss, stroke, stroke, grind, bite)  Agh!  Oh, that's it, now come for me, gorgeous!"
“Sherlock Holmes, get your beautiful arse out here.  Right now.”   Weird.  Why did that sound like déjà vu?
Sometimes John has trouble getting his little dumpling to communicate with him during sex. Sometimes Sherlock’s brain has trouble shutting down for pleasure. Over time John has formulated
Friday:  “Well we’ve either discovered alcohol or pot.  My money’s on the pot”
John was totally in the moment.  “God yes.  I feel like a bloody tart and I love it”
John reached up and grabbed the ropes above his shoulders that lead to the frame above, causing the cradle to swing slightly in the water.  He felt wanton and floaty.  It was a very seductive feeling.  He cracked open his eyes and saw Sherlock preparing another, slightly larger toy.  Sherlock turned and startled when he saw John’s open eyes.  He paused, waiting for communication.  John pressed his feet into the cradle and lifted his hips toward Sherlock in unspoken agreement.
How quickly situations can change in the blink of an eye, dear reader.
“Mmm John?”
Sherlock got excited and wiggled on John’s lap.  “Oh that’s really quite good, John.  I glued fur to a diving glove to see what it would feel like under water and it’s wonderful, John.  You’ll like it”  He looked at john expectantly, with such hope, like a little boy waiting for Christmas.
“Well done, John.  It’s just too sloppy, not up to his usual standard.  But there’s a bit too much control for alcohol.  I’d say it’s more laid-back stoned.  Wonder if it has anything to do with dulling the hand pain from yesterday or just youthful caprice.”
John clutched at Sherlock’s arse and could feel his own dampness through the fabric of the Speedos.  Suddenly he
John slid his left arm diagonally over and across Sherlock's heaving stomach until his hand settled over the centre of his chest.  "Now listen carefully to me, Sherlock.  First, I want you to loosen that gorgeous cravat so that I can suck on your beautiful neck.  Do it."  Sherlock immediately raised his hands to fumble with the length of linen, drawing it down and to the side, and undoing the collar button of his shirt, exposing the left side of his neck for his John.  John rewarded him with a soft kiss and a lick.  "Perfect.  Good boy," John murmured against Sherlock's neck.  "Next, I want you to place your hands on the backs of my thighs and leave them there until I say otherwise.  Do you think you can do that?"
Sherlock gulped.
John straightened and stepped in close directly behind Sherlock.  The heels on his boots gave him a little more height than he'd normally have in this position, and he could hear Sherlock panting as he rested his right cheek on Sherlock's left shoulder.  He slid his right hand around Sherlock's hip until it splayed against his belly and the crease where belly met thigh.  He placed firm pressure there, pushing Sherlock's plump arse back against his groin.
This elicited a disdainful verbal response.  "Back on, John?!  But they’re ruined.  Why would you want me to put them back on?"
"Sherlock, Sherlock, what are you doing to me?  My beautiful boy, my gorgeous marvel.  You're being so good for me.  So perfect.  Look at you.  You want me to see you, don't you.  You want me to see how affected you are, how much you want this.  You get off on me knowing how much you get off on me knowing.  Oh God," John groaned into Sherlock's neck, pressing kisses up and down the length.
“Sherlock, wait!”  Too late.  Sherlock was only pausing by the door to grab a fistful of little rock chips from around the base of the succulent Mrs Hudson had left on their hall table,
“Uh, Sherlock…”  Sherlock raises a spiked brow.  John leans in to shout, “What’s the case?”
"Hnnnngh, Jesus."
“Sherlock, I don’t think that’s a ver- Mmph!”
upon.
So he reached up and slipped the waistbands of the trunks and tights down to unveil his bottom, until the drawstring pulled tightly across the base of his cock.  Feeling sexily laid bare to John’s gaze he reached right down to his ankles and trailed his fingers up his stocking clad legs.  The height of the heels made a pretty shape out of Sherlock’s calves.
“Christ.”
“Bollocking hell that feels good.”  Two hands landed in Sherlock’s dark curls urging him on.
Whilst John had been reminiscing, Sherlock had danced them over to one of the four columns on the dance floor supporting a large frame high above the crowd, that sporadically releases a fine mist of water over the undulating, fevered bodies.  With his eyes closed, wrists crossed above his head, fingers gently curled, Sherlock writhes sinuously against the column, making John think his spank bank had bought a projector and was screening a session of his Top Five.  Shoulders and wrists pressed to the column’s shaft, lower torso making lateral figure of eights in John’s general direction, the mist drizzles its way through the air to kiss his lovely, toned belly where the thing passing as a shirt has ridden up to expose a fine trail of damp hair, disappearing into the inky depths of the jeans.  “Fuuuuucck,” John whispers.
from John signalled the end of any chance at satisfaction.  “Sherlock, please don’t go off the deep end again.  It’s just drumming.  Can we please try to ignore it today and perhaps get back to what we were doing?”
“SMOOTH?!” he yelled in the thankfully empty change room.  “TTTHHHMOOOOOOTH?!” he mimicked nastily as he planted his hands on Sherlock’s chest and pushed him forcefully toward a shower someone had left running.  “Why don’t we just pop in here and I can show you
John brushes a kiss to the sticky slit before dampening his lips and sliding Sherlock’s length inside his mouth.  He can only make it about half-way down comfortably, at first.  The feeling of being so full of Sherlock is a headrush.  He gentles his twitching lover with soft strokes over his hips as he slides almost all the way back, before sinking down again, a tiny bit further.  “Mmmmmn.”  He can’t help himself.  Muffled sounds emanate around Sherlock’s cock, buzzing his lips and fuelling his ardour as he undulates rhythmically.  He can hear Sherlock’s breath catching, feel his body fluttering as John coaxes his pleasure forth.  Ironically, he feels more masterful than he’s ever felt with a lover.  Probably because he’s never felt as wanted, as desired as he feels right now with Sherlock.  Sherlock’s guileless, uncontrived reactions speak directly to John’s heart which seems currently linked to his libido, and it’s all rushing in to crowd his thoughts with,
Deaf to John’s pleas, Sherlock froze.  His mouth still full of John, he tried to calm his ire by taking three deep breaths through his nose, but you try doing this with a mouth full of doctor and see how calm you get.
John slipped his hands from under Sherlock's and moved to stand in front of him, holding his face in one gloved and one un-gloved hand.  "You're not, you know," John hummed quietly.  "You're not as shit at feelings as you think.  I know what I just saw.  I can tell what you want me to know, and that's what's important, isn't' it."  He smiled encouragingly at Sherlock.  "I know you love me, right?"  Sherlock nodded.  "And I know you know I love you, right?"  Another nod.  "And I know you love what we just did, yes?"  An enthusiastic nod.  "And I know you're going to let me take you home, strip those pantloons off, turn them inside-out, put them back on you loosening the lacing on the other side, then let me at you again, aren't you."
Startled, Sherlock jumped and wiggled said arse in John’s face. John nearly passed out from its juicy, bouncy perfection.
The moment the pair are through the door, John takes a deep breath and tries to settle his nerves.  Just the thought of getting his hands on Sherlock is mind blowing, so he’s going to have to put his libido on lock-down in order to focus.  He wants this to be something more than just fucking, just lust-filled sex.  More than something Sherlock could get from anyone in that club.  More than something
“I’d like us to try something different.”  A beat.  “I want you to let me come to you.  I want to know how you feel when you make yourself a part of me, and I want you to know how it feels when I lay myself open to you becoming a part of me.  Do you think… could we… perhaps-“
, very, very
Sherlock finally released John's thighs and reached up to place his hands over John's.  "John, I..."  He swallowed.
“I know, but perhaps I should have specified that the alternative to jumping wasn’t pushing the nearest copper in to retrieve it for you.  Anderson’s still got Thames water dribbling out his ears and I’m the one getting the gruesome pictorial evidence in complaint.”  They crossed with the lights and continued on their way.
The absurdity of the whole conversation suddenly dawned on John and a snort-giggle burst forth from his nose and mouth.  He dropped a hand down to pet Sherlock’s hair as the urge to laugh grew until he was shaking with the effort to hold it in.  Sherlock peered up at him for a moment, before tentatively smiling.  John opened his knees and Sherlock shuffled forward to get closer to his John, who was now openly laughing.  All felt right in Sherlock’s world when John was happy.  “Come here and give me a kiss, you git”
“There,” Sherlock rumbles in his ear, satisfied with his adjustment.  “That’s infinitely better.”
His experiments with the sex toys had certainly paid off.  And speaking of paid off, he had to remember to go put money on John’s credit card.  He would have used his own but the toy sites were so engrossing and John’s wallet was right there within reach and he’d have them paid before John would know anything ab-
“Can I come out yet, Sherlock?”
This was the moment Sherlock had been preparing for all week, but unfortunately for him it was not exactly happening in the calm, controlled circumstances he was counting on.  John had gone almost
John sensed something afoot. Sherlock asked way too prettily, and since when did he start saying ‘please’ unless he was begging in the throes of passion? He probably had some cockamamie plan he thought would distract John. Well his little sweetmeat had much to learn. John took a deep breath and steeled himself before pushing open the door and coming to an abrupt stop.
“Sherlock!  I’m the one in control here this time, so you don’t need to worry about being put off your rhythm.  I’m quite capable of performing,  drum beat or no, so just lie there and enjoy,” he threatened.
“He’s frustrated.  He’s playing his most difficult jazz piece before his father’s even home and he’s rushing through it, bashing it out with no finesse, skimming over the mistakes instead of stopping and working on the difficult passages.  And he’s making gratuitous use of the crash cymbal.  It’s not going to improve like that.  He’s just playing to get his frustrations out.”
“Shut up and hang on to the table, love.  I’m feeling
Sherlock continued his ministrations to John’s behind, relaxing him as the warm water bubbled around them.  He closed his eyes and slumped back into the cradle, thrusting up onto fingers, curling his head aside to invite nibbles to his neck.  Oh he felt sooo good.  Sherlock backed off for a moment, and then he could feel something other than fingers stretching him open.  It was snug but not too big, giving only the tiniest burn momentarily.  He relaxed, allowing it to be pressed in and out of him without resistance.
John knows that Sherlock often guesses, but the guesses were based on other, more sound deductions so he never squabbled with him.  Ignoring the hairy eyeball he asked, “Well what about the mixed parentage and the dreads?  Explain those!”
“Yes.  It’s all yours.  Float it, sink it, burn it, whatever.  Mi semen, su semen”
Sherlock’s eyes bulged.  He needed no further prompting.  He backed John up against the wall and reached down for his belt.  John closed his eyes and let the tensions of the morning wash away as he sighed and whispered to Sherlock,
God.  He’d forgotten the lyrics.  He remembers now how appropriate they were to his one-sided obsession with Sherlock.
“Be buggered if Don’s going to see you like that!”  A towel was hastily thrust at a red, transparent groin.
“Then come to me, Sherlock.  I’m ready” he panted.
He was plonking away at the keyboard an hour later when he heard strange noises coming from Sherlock’s room.
“Well, just shut your eyes and listen, John”
Sherlock wedged a hand between himself and the bed and whimpered, rubbing as hard as he dared, while John settled in with a steady rhythm.  As he fucked and ground his hips into his beloved’s hind quarters he ran his hands all over that expanse of back, and down those endless legs revelling in the beauty before him.  John is a smart man.  He could see that all that beauty wasn’t just physical.  What he was witnessing was a man of pride and strength, who was willing to trust him enough to lead him to places of pleasure without fear of humiliation.  John’s chest swelled with pride that it was
John was busy grinding his very impressive erection into Sherlock's arse, grinding in small circles as he pulled Sherlock as close to him as two men in Regency costume could possibly be.  John's brass buttons were pressing into the back of Sherlock's waistcoat like hard little conkers, and his white gloved fingers were probably leaving imprints on Sherlock's hips.
Oh God.  John’s brain is caught between Sia’s throaty voice and Sherlock’s rolling hips.  This
Now, my little voyeurs, I must drag you back to the present, to early Tuesday morning, where John, cock in shuttling hand, last night’s Speedos clutched in the other, eyes squinched shut, is still lost in memory, whispering fervently,
John bent to push the offending shorts all the way off and removed his own trunks. He kicked them away and gave his cock a few swift strokes. “Sherlock, turn around and suck me” he ordered. “Make me nice and wet”. Sherlock dropped to his knees and deep-throated John. So desperate was his need he pushed right to the root. Worried for his sweetie’s throat, John retreated slightly but Sherlock grunted and followed, producing copious strings of saliva.
“Problem?”
“Aaaaaaaaaahhh Jawn, Don’t.  You.
While he had been speaking, Sherlock had edged closer and closer to a stupefied John, slipping his hands onto John’s arse, pulling him close to his undulating hips.  John edges his shoulders back to focus on Sherlock’s face.
“God John, you look so beautiful, so perfectly trusting, so utterly abandoned.  I can’t believe I’ve made you look like that.”
“Wholly and completely, John.”
Sherlock thrust his hips back against John and circled, pulling him closer with fingers that were still wrapped around the backs of his thighs.  John grunted into his ear and Sherlock saw stars, coming and coming almost untouched, but for the gentle stroke of John's knuckles down the side of his cock.  John's talented artistry inspired his subject to paint himself with his own undoing.  He'd never been so seduced by words, by feelings, been so wrapped up in the web John wove with his words and commands and...  God he was still coming, still jerking and grinding into John - John!  Had John...?  Yes, he could deduce from John's breathing, not to mention a certain warmth pressed into the seat of his pants, that John in fact, had.
“John, please!” he admonished, “we’re in a change room” the little hypocrite had the audacity to murmur.  The fact hadn’t bothered Sherlock one iota a fortnight ago.
John had to draw on all his reserves not to smile. He rose to his feet and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s Cupid’s bow. He finally grinned and Sherlock allowed himself to look relieved. John nudged Sherlock’s head to the side so he could nuzzle that glorious length of neck giving it a good long lick and a suck, drawing blood to the surface. They both had a little kink for this. They quite enjoyed marking each other territorially. It was fucking HOT. Sherlock groaned languorously, his head hanging forward.
see-through they can get, John?  You can tell me how many dicks I’m holding up… “  Sherlock continued to babble, seriously worrying the weakened seams had overplayed his hand.
to master it and to date there was only one virtuoso.  Only one man was permitted to reach every high note, bow such trembling vibrato, coax every grace note from its anima.  For John’s touch, even Sherlock’s open strings would sing as sweetly as any harmonic ever would.
“Obvious, John” the grinning idiot said.
John emerged from the cabana to face a maniacally grinning Sherlock with his chest all puffed out.  He was in his silvery-grey Speedos, standing proudly next to what John was pretty sure was a sex swing – on steroids.  John felt frustration brewing in his gut, as if the yeast in the beer he’d been drinking was reacting, frothing and bubbling in there.  Sherlock couldn’t possibly be doing this a fourth time, could he?!
“Nobody.  Nothing.  Just get that towel around you, will you.  We’re going out there, getting dressed and going home right now.”
Sherlock paced the living room, agitated and rattled.  “I’ve tried going in to The Yard to complain about it to Gary but he doesn’t want to know about it.  After all the help I give him.  Ingrate.”
“Bossy,” he sniggers, gusting his breath over the head of Sherlock’s lovely cock.
John just smiled to himself.
The crop was permitted.
“No, no.  I insist.  I want satisfaction and I may need you there for that to… back me up”
"You hardly had to go all ‘method’ for fancy dress"
“Do I have to, John?” is pressed into John’s neck.
“Nah, shut up, right!  I’ve had a fight with my dad because of a black eye from a fight at school, then I fell off my bike and twisted my wrist when I had a brand new stupid piece to learn for the school play.  I went to a party to try to mellow out a bit, if ya know what I mean, and met a girl I thought I could be friends with only I’ve stuffed-up even that now!” the ghostly voice wailed.
“Good?
“Don’t worry.  It must be around.  Do we need anything at the shop?”
“You’re not that quiet, John.  I had the adjacent room.”
“Hmmm…”
“Really?  How can you tell?”
John.”
“Oooh, yes, that’s it, John.  You set the pace”
“Nothing, John.  A walk sounds lovely.  Just give me five minutes to get ready”
"Who painted this one, love?"
John felt a mixture of emotions rush up and hit his chest.  Bottoming wasn’t something he’d done before and the thought of handing over all control was quite alien to him.  But if he was honest with himself there was also excitement bubbling there, and keeping in mind who this man was to him, and how Sherlock had put his trust in John today he thought perhaps the time had come to open himself to this.
He slides the button through the slit and lowers the zipper – not an easy feat on jeans this tight – and hears Sherlock sigh in relief as his cock falls out, heavy and full.
I was also impressed at your dedication to research.  How delightful that you have studied all 243 brands of lipstick.  Is L’Absolu Rouge 191 particularly complimentary to
tyrant.”
He pats Sherlock’s hip softly.  “Turn onto your tummy for me.”
“Sherlock”
“It’s way too hard.  I think a bit of stroking will fix it.”
The contents of Sherlock’s slide seemed to be fascinating.  “No, John.  It’s just that once you place your bodily fluids into my body I consider them to be my property, and I can therefore do what I like with them,” he calmly murmured into the microscope stage.
He’s sprinting after Sherlock.
John’s gaze dropped again. There was now an extra visible inch. His eyebrows rose and his eyeballs glazed over. “Although we did have fun in the cell, as I recall… " John’s voice drifted away…
another time, many of them.  For now, just tell me - how did you know I play the violin?”
“Yes, John” Sherlock coyly murmured, as he leaned forward to receive John’s affection.
John snatched it and walked to the lounge, muttering about errant laptops and absent boyfriends.  Nobody listened to him anyway.  He might as well be deleted.
Wednesday:  “Domestic unrest, John”
John returned to the action at the front line. He could see Sherlock was nice and relaxed now and he was able to slip his tongue back in quite easily and wiggle. He spread Sherlock’s cheeks even wider and made a seal around the pucker with his lips and
Sherlock stood staring at an unfinished portrait of George IV, hands clasped behind his back.  The private room of The National Gallery still held a few traces of evidence of the lavish party held within but a few hours earlier.  Most of the napkins and stemware had been removed, along with the host, guests, staff and police.  A few stray side tables and empty champagne bottles remained to keep the two handsomely clad boys company.
John retrieves the lubricant, grabs Sherlock’s hand, and squeezes out a generous puddle into his cupped palm.  He dips two fingers in and swirls them about in an attempt to warm the gel slightly.  “Keep that steady,” he whispers, as he draws Sherlock forward to lean against his chest.  He reaches around to touch his fingers to where he’d been lapping earlier, circling and swirling against the tight furl until he feels Sherlock relax.  He reaches back to re-dip his fingers, only to find Sherlock’s arm slumped against the headboard, lubricant rivulets streaming down his forearm.  He smiles and runs the side of his finger along the pathways, gathering as much as he can and returning to the warmth of Sherlock’s cleft.  He circles again before softly pushing in a little.  Sherlock just moans, utterly still and pliant against John’s chest, the fluttering around his finger the only movement he can feel.
Sherlock tilts his head, darting his eyes over John.  John waits, allowing Sherlock to process whatever he observes.  Slowly, Sherlock’s hand comes out for the coat and he hangs them both on the rack.  His arm drops and he settles in front of John, waiting.
Caveman instincts clubbing their beat into his head, John puffed up to his full five foot seven, fists clenching and unclenching he jerked his head at Sherlock’s Speedos.
The two men stopped for traffic.  Two police cars sped by, lights flashing.  John watched Sherlock gaze longingly after them as they sped off into the distance, no doubt toward some grizzly crime.
"At your command, Captain..."
“Is that what you were buggering around with all week?!  Oh god, what was the fur for?”
“… wh-… how the bloody hell did you get all that?  Have you seen him in the street?”
Agh.  Now he remembers tossing off that night to the thought of running his hands all over Sherlock while the detecting angel danced in front of him.  Droplets of cold water suddenly sprinkle down on John’s face, making him jump guiltily at his carnal thoughts.
John lined himself up and pushed home.  Two sets of tears nearly fell from the relief.  It was impossible to say who needed the friction more.
Sherlock was still running when he decided he’d need lots of hot water, bi-carbonate of soda, a rasp and a nail file to avoid the next lesson.
, Sherlock?”  John hadn’t felt this riled up since Afghanistan.
He’s them together.
All quiet on the Baker Street front.  No whirring.  No grunting.  No deliveries.  No home improvement injuries.  Sun was shining, birds were singing.  John decided he was due some quality time with his love, taking a walk and some lunch in the park.  He phoned downstairs for some takeaway and went in search of Sherlock.
… nothing.  God only knew what he was getting up to in there.
“It’s amaaaazing, Jawn.  You’re amazing,” he whispers fiercely.
So after rallying the troops, John resettled his stance, allowed Sherlock a few quick breaths before slipping his hand back over his mouth and FUCKED. HARD. And as our John is a man of his word he did exactly what he said, fucking and slamming and grinding and sucking Sherlock dry. And as Sherlock stood in that cubicle looking bewildered and well-fucked, John lovingly pressed his lips to dazed ones, gently bent down and threaded Sherlock’s feet into those tiny black shorts. He stood there as docile as a lamb as John pulled them up his thighs, eased his arms into his Belstaff, threaded his fingers through his and then followed John out of the centre and across town without a single murmur.
Knowing how Sherlock hates to repeat himself, John doesn’t bother asking if he’s sure.  “Run that sticky hand over me, gorgeous.”
5th July, 2019
“The only thing stopping me from killing you, Sherlock, is knowing you planned it all before I told you about the private lesson –
Juan, John fumed.  In John’s head the enemy was attacking via water, and he was the bloody idiot who’d sent him the co-ordinates.  Well there was nothing for it – bugger the Army, under the circumstances he was going to have to commandeer the Navy.  He was going to have to marshal some subs and a pissing bloody periscope to keep an eye on this
hear a difference.  The playing wasn’t as crisp, as articulate as usual.  It was much more laid back.  He told Sherlock what he heard.
John just stares, mouth agape, swaying to Sherlock’s lead.
John simmered with bile.  He wondered if this guy could make speaking sound any more like a sex act if he tried.  He couldn’t believe he was paying for this.
In short, ‘early distraction’.  John, as we have mentioned, was very partial to Sherlock in red so Sherlock purloined and trawled through various catalogues with the avid obsession of a devotee, pinpointing the
Sherlock grins and shuffles on his knees until he’s hovering over John.  John holds his lover’s hips steady as Sherlock guides John’s restless, twitching cock against himself.  John watches, hypnotised, as Sherlock lets go and places his hands on John’s shoulders, arms quite bent so he can lean in to buss John quickly and nuzzle their noses together.  John can feel the piercing rub coldly against the edge of his nostril.  It’s oddly erotic.  Sherlock rests their foreheads together as he ever-so-slowly, lowers down down down to make them one.  They’re both panting like mad; dotted with sweat.  John experiences the exquisite clutch and heat of Sherlock, and thinks it’s all going to be over in seconds.
Four things remained in the small office: three people and an atmosphere bigger than Jupiter.
"Well don't let me stop your enjoyment, John."
They were borrowing Molly’s car overnight so they could drive out to the property tomorrow and John was about to cab it over to Bart’s to pick it up.
Sherlock’s eyes widened.  “I think I may be able to help there, John.  Did I tell you about the media mogul I once helped out of a tricky situation?  One of his newspapers was involved in a phone-tapping scandal.  He had this amazing property and told me I was welcome to use it any time…”
“-I’ve noticed an increased level of preoccupation in you this week.  Is it all to do with Tuesday?”
, matching or perhaps surpassing Sherlock’s, considering John’s usual, orthodox sexuality.
“YES! I’ll wear whatever you-“
John had been gifted with Regency regimentals - how fitting - that made him feel quite the thing.  A gorgeous uniform coat with buttoned back lapels, snowy white waistcoat, starched frilled shirt and regimental sword hanging from a shoulder belt, made him stand taller and straighter than he'd stood in a long while. The heeled boots and white leather gloves completed the outfit that must have set Sherlock back quite a penny.  He held Sherlock's brown leather riding crop, the loop of thonging around his wrist.  There had been a small argument over the crop - Sherlock insisting it wasn't a part of an officer's uniform, John firmly stating he wanted to be in the cavalry and besides, carrying the crop made him think of how he wanted to swat Sherlock's generous offerings every time he got a peek at them as Sherlock's frock coat swished, splitting the tails just enough to whet John's appetite.
“I can see that, my gelatinous handyman.  Would you like me to take a look at that eye for you?”
could get from anyone in that club.  He wants to start as he means to go on.  And he means to keep Sherlock.  He means to keep that gorgeous, wild thing in a constant state of bloom.
A consulting detective may have swallowed in alarm.  “But John, we did have lots of fun in them last week.  Can’t we just call it even?”
“It’ll fit.”
“Sherlock that’s extraordinary.  I can’t believe how interested you seem in learning now, after avoiding it for so long.  What’s going on?”
The morning sunlight lay across John’s nose and cheek like a slash of paint.  The warmth prickled his skin until said doctor’s nose twitched.  A hand arose to scratch, eyelids flickering open to espy long, tapered fingers tipped with blood red nails lying palm-down on the bed beside him.
Sherlock swung his head around and grinned at John.
Juan?  Juan?
“Oh yes, I am planning on using it later too, John!  I’ve made another special sling for that but for now it’s a floating aid” he smirked.
59 Well Street
, inadvertently waving the red Speedos at John as if he were a bull.
The stricken man raises his eyes to John’s.  “I’m not easily scared-off, Sherlock, just in case you hadn’t noticed.”  He sighs.  “Did you really set up that song in the club?”
Was Sherlock complimenting him?!  At the thought, John shivers again.  “Are you OK, John?  Are you cold?  I can assure you, this fabric will feel all too hot when we get to where we’re going.”  Sherlock reaches out and runs The Fingers through John’s hair, elegantly mussing it in a way that John wouldn’t be able to manage with a mirror, product and half an hour.  John stands there submissively, overawed at all this Sherlockian attention.
John's breath was quite stolen away.  The lacing was so slack John could see that Sherlock's cock was firming, but not yet so firm as to be stiff.  It was John's perfect, most favourite state of Sherlock's cock - thickened, so as to have heft, yet not so tumescent as to be stiff beyond pliability.  John loved nothing more than taking Sherlock's cock in his mouth in this state, where it was fattened yet supple enough to mold against the roof of his mouth with the flat press of his tongue.  That exact perfect state of cock was now visible through the slack opening, and if Sherlock was throwing down his gauntlet then John was absolutely picking it up.
John smiled and let his eyelids drift shut again, dredging up vivid vermilion images from last night.  Itch soothed, the hand slid down, down over his chest, coming to rub lightly back and forth across his belly.  Mmmm it was all coming back to him.  He could still smell the visceral fuck-scent they’d produced, as if the heat was still vital between them now.  John nuzzled his face into the pillow… Ooops!  Scent in the air, no.  Scent on the pillow – yes, very much so.  The good doctor raised his head and drew out from under his cheek a pair of very, very
“John, do you think my bum looks big in these?”
Hmmm.  “Do you have anything you need to tell me, my tasty cake?”
“Huh?”
John must have briefly gone off-line, because the next thing he knows, he is standing in the foyer of a club.  Sherlock is behind him, relieving him of his coat and handing it to the rather menacing-looking attendant.  As he blinks his way back up to the surface, he feels Sherlock’s hands either side of his ribs, sliding smoothly upwards, until they curve around to cross over his chest.  John goes to turn his head to see what the bloody hell the git is up to, but is arrested by said git’s chin dropping onto his shoulder, and a rumbling baritone purring, “What shall we induuulge in first, Joooohhn?”
“Are we absolutely sure?”
Perhaps he hadn’t quite hit the surface, yet.
First step required a bit of dexterity and lube.  Done.  Next, he drew a chair up to his mirror and circled his mouth with the sticky gloss.  Then his nails – in retrospect, probably should have done those earlier as they need a bit of time to dry… damn.  A quick crack of the door to check on John:  “
before clambering down the stairs.  “What are you going to say?  Come out, little drummer boy!  We want to see if you’re everything Sherlock says you are?!”
John moaned deep in his throat sending vibrations all along Sherlock’s length.  Overcome and overwhelmed, Sherlock dropped one hand to cup John’s face and looked at him and cried, “I love you, John!  Take everything... everything I’ve got to give” and you can bet that that great man lying underneath all that beauty going on above him heard and saw all that vulnerable, unconcealed rawness and did indeed take it all – every last drop.  He took it all inside and wrapped it up in his own heart and swore he’d protect it with his life, if it came to it again.
“That would be helpful, John, yes”
From now on, Sherlock will be his
The taller man shook his head slightly, as if to clear it and meekly responded, “I know, John.  I know I need to learn but you know I’ve kept my word – I haven’t jumped into the Thames to retrieve evidence for over a month.”
