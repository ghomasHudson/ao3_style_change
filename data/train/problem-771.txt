“Okay,” John whispered. Suddenly, he didn’t have much breath left to speak.
“Yeah,” John whispered back, leaning in to enfold himself in Sherlock and never let go. “Forever, and beyond.”
Sherlock took the opportunity to tug him up slightly and push the pants down off his hips, throwing them aside and leaving John fully nude before him; completely bare, vulnerable, trusting. The heat in John’s abdomen flared up through his chest now, wrapping itself warmly around his heart – it was here that John felt safe, always, knowing Sherlock was protecting him, keeping him happy, adoring him.
“Um.” He glanced up at the calendar hanging on the back wall, and did some quick mental maths. “Two years, seven months, three days and…I suppose, what, two hours?”
John laughed, maybe a little too brightly, and Sherlock flashed him a rather radiant smile as he joined in.
Sherlock pressed a kiss to his temple. “I love you.”
But still, there was never any way to mistake that wavering, radiant smile.
Sherlock broke off briefly to catch his breath, and then kissed him again, softly, deepening it slowly to let it stretch on as long as possible. John's lips were warm, his movements unhurried, his fingers twined solidly with Sherlock’s like a balm to his aching chest. And the way he nipped gently at Sherlock’s lips, the way he shifted minutely against him to pull him closer, the way the steady rise and fall of his breathing flowed through every point of contact between them, let Sherlock know that John was here, that he wasn’t going anywhere, that he still was and would always be here with Sherlock, no matter what forces in the universe tried to tear them apart.
"So you wouldn't mind telling me what you saw, then? I'd really like it," Sherlock grinned at her, eyes slowly raking down her body.
Sherlock set two steaming cups of coffee down on the kitchen table and sat, indicating for John to do the same. "I suppose we should. It was rather a big deal."
Sherlock inhaled sharply, looking down at their point of contact. "Of course," he finally muttered, eyes flitting up to John's nervously. "I've logged your bathroom routine in my Mind Palace. Comes in handy."
Barista:*laughs* A little personal, huh?
Next he put some on his fingers and pet Sherlock's tight arsehole, bringing an almost inhuman moan out of the detective. John stuck his first and middle finger into Sherlock and groaned. "You're so tight, love. Are you sure you're ready?"
King Artoria Pendragon: I’m not really much of a king anymore.
John crawled onto the bed and over to Sherlock, easily popping the first three shirt buttons open with only one hand. Perhaps John was more versed in seducing men then he'd let on, seeing as the shirt buttons would be opposite for women and thus it would take more practice to open men's?
John shook his head eagerly, reaching for the lube. "No I'm not. It's long and thick, but not too thick. I've seen blokes with twice your ego and half your size. Anyone would kill to fuck a cock like this."
"What?" Sherlock breathed, voice an octave too high.
Sherlock Holmes: Oh. Well, I guess that's what I was going for...
"I am very angry at you, Sherlock."
John woke up with a pounding headache and a faint sense of regret. He laid in his bed, eyes closed, for several seconds before heaving himself up to a sitting position and cracking his eyelids open to the bright morning sun streaming through his window.
For some reason this made John shudder. He’d talked to the Forensics major before, sure, they shared the same class… but something about him made him uneasy and rather frightened, actually. “I know what you mean. Excuse me-” John shuffled around the thin man, noting his tight grey shirt and jeans. Obviously he was trying to impress someone by his appearance. He stepped into the elevator, beyond relieved when the doors closed. He closed his eyes as his pulse slowed into a more steady rhythm.
I'll be gone all next week and therefore unable to update, but I will add another chapter ASAP.
Sherlock Holmes: I just talked to one Regina George, who was in highschool, and she needed my assistance.
"Want me to really fuck you properly?"
Sherlock nodded his understanding, not trusting his suddenly dry mouth. Yesterday had been different, more frantic and raw. They hadn't even bothered to turn on the lights, so it had been rather dark. For a moment Sherlock feared that upon taking off his pants, John would laugh and tell him the whole thing was some big joke. The thought made him queasy so he pushed it away quickly.
John was immediately lead up a flight of stairs and into the living room of 221B Baker Street. Holmes passed through the room and the kitchen quickly, hardly giving John a chance to look around.
Sherlock Holmes: Hell-*hic*-o.
Sherlock Holmes: Sherlock Holmes, by the way.
Sam and Dean: *Dean puts the gun away* Sam; Dean doesn't really enjoy being deduced *offers a apologetic smile*
He bobbed his head and I yanked his hair, head falling back as the world tilted in sheer pleasure. My hips were moving of their own accord, and I held his head still as I thrust, hard and deep and rough, into his throat and my tip skimmed the back of his throat, did he have no gag reflex? and then he was swallowing around me, again and again, and with one last thrust and something that was either a grunt or a sob or something in between I came, hard and long.
"I want to feel you from the inside. I want to fuck you like an animal!-" Sherlock shoved John onto the couch and straddled him, like a private lap dance in his very own living room.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: What I see in his eyes is a depth that cannot be easily defined. Like there's something just below the surface, that under the right circumstances you might be able to see.
Once again, he ran his finger around Sherlock's arsehole. This time it only twitched, but stayed relaxed. John made a sound of approval.
John chuckled, pecking Sherlock on the lips. "Night, Sherlock."
Still thinking about Jim as he got into his car, John set off for 221B Baker Street, too preoccupied to worry about what was about to happen.
"-I want to fuck you like an animal-"
Sherlock Holmes: Depends. Is it Twingings Breakfast?
"We'll have a- ahhh- fish and chips and- mmm- a OH MY GOD- b-burger," Sherlock stumbled over his words, finally crying out when John turned the vibrator to it's highest intensity. John closed his eyes to refrain from bending him over this counter and having him right here in front of everyone.
This is a conversation between Hiro Hamada and yourself, Sherlock Holmes.
"I want to see you touch yourself before I do anything," John breathed, gently sucking on the spot just above his collarbone.
Some drops hit his eyelids before John could fix his aim, targeting the detective's open mouth and tongue, also splattering his cheeks and chin for good measure. Shit, how did he still have any semen left after the shower? Sherlock was really turning up his libido.
His middle finger joined his first, wrist relaxing back to a normal position and moving frantically in and out of himself. From several feet away I could see lubricant streaming over the edge of his sphincter and down into the mattress and I longed for my mouth to be there instead of his hands; a revelation that made my eyes snap shut and sweat bead on my forehead. Okay, so I was officially admitting to myself that I had feelings for Sherlock, then.
John opened his eyes and was surprised to see Sherlock staring at him, eyes unguarded and full of adoration.
John let out a small moan, running his thumb over his already leaking tip. This wouldn't take long at all.
As soon as the door swung shut, Sherlock began to nuzzle John's neck and jawbone.
This is a conversation between wolowitz and Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock Holmes: Someone stole her 'burn book'.
"Any vomiting or diarrhea?"
"Oh," Sherlock gasped, jerking back a bit. "John, no."
John felt his cock dribble just from Sherlock's response alone. "You're going to make me soil your sheets. Do you think you're ready?"
"Now, for my real job."
Sherlock Holmes: Well, I say fantastic...
Hiro Hamada: Not my fault you're old. *crosses arms* I also won the world wide science fair for adults when I was five. Invented a chip they use in most cellphones today to keep power.
Sherlock Holmes: Good. Even ordinary creatures deserve the false sense of accomplishment.
"First, you are going to lean over the bed so I can discipline you. Then, I will tease you and edge you until you are aching to cum for me, and I will leave you tied up in this room while I finish my blog post. Once you've had time to think about what you've done, I will fuck you. This will not be for you, this will be for me. You will not cum. You will not be able to touch me. Do you understand?" John's voice was quiet and deadly and slow and painfully sexy. Sherlock's knees weakened just listening.
John's smile widened and he flexed his hands.
John Watson: Yeah...same here
Sherlock's mouth was softer than it looked, John discovered. It was minty and tinged with the taste of John's salty cum and one hundred percent Sherlock.
Maybe it was the booze running through his system. Maybe it was the fact that he hadn't so much as held hands with anyone in over three weeks. Maybe it was because he was relieved that his feelings were actually reciprocated. Whatever the reason, John leaned forward and, without thinking, pressed his lips firmly to Sherlock's.
John's hand twitched up slowly, slowly, getting closer to the source of Sherlock's problem by millimetres. Sherlock squirmed against his restraints, just wanting John to touch his prick.
"Because I want to try it. With you. I want to see if I can cum just from you... stimulating my prostate," he finished, flushing.
“I’ll be out,” he yelled, not sure if his dorm mate Mike was even here. Anyway, it wasn’t like he’d call Scotland Yard if John was gone for an hour or so. He opened and shut the door quietly, walking to the elevator and waiting for it to come.
John whipped around unconsciously, breath hitching. Jesus fucking Christ, Sherlock had his eyes open and he was staring at John, mouth curved into a sexy sneer.
John hefted up his bookbag as he stood from the cramped desk, glancing at the clock. 12:00; he had enough time to catch up on the latest Dr. Who episode before his next class. This thought in mind, John Watson rushed down the steps of the lecture hall and was nearly out the door when an all-too-familiar voice called him back.
Sherlock pulled back, coughing, immediately. "What, did I do something wrong?" he managed hoarsely. "I tried to do what you did but I couldn't quite remember- I could try again, if you-?"
John gulped. Fuck. Fuck. Fucking bollocks. Shit. “M-My future?” he managed to gasp, somehow not blurting something stupid in his panic. If this conversation was going where he thought it was going, he likely wouldn’t have a future to talk about. He’d be homeless, out on the streets begging. Oh, Christ, he’d have to go to soup kitchens and accept charity and shit, what would his mum say?
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: Ok, Well I'm Castiel Novak
"Fuck," John hissed, his orgasm hitting him like a freight train. He let out a long, keening out moan, leaning his forehead against the tiled wall as his legs shook with the sheer force of it. Less than five minutes ago he'd been fully clothed. Jesus, what was Sherlock doing to him?
Sherlock Holmes: Did your subjects know?
Holmes cocked his head. “Alright… John. Wait right here.” He walked back over to his desk (John relaxed a bit; he had been getting pretty close to him) and grabbed a small stack of papers and a pen.
"I-" thwack. "Said-" thwack. "You-" thwack. "Are-" thwack. "Not-" thwack. "Allowed-" thwack. "To-" thwack. "Cum." THWACK.
By the time Sherlock had taken his full length in, John's mouth was a perfect O of pleasure. "Love, you feel so good. Jesus Christ, you're tight."
John tried to tune out the singing, he really did, but then eight words were breathily sung into the microphone and the doctor dropped the can of tomato soup he was holding.
"How does it feel?" John asked gently, still rubbing Sherlock comfortingly.
teen!nerd!wearing lingerie underneath clothing!Castiel (Destiel, jock!Dean?): Kansas.
Sam and Dean: Sam: yeah I’ve read ALL of your books
Before Lestrade could respond, Sherlock turned and walked away. John followed, trying not to laugh. This'll teach the prick not to accept a challenge just to have a challenge.
Sherlock inhaled sharply, pressing his bum into John's hands. "S-sluts," he cried out finally.
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something, but John beat him to it: "Stop thinking. For once, just feel and go with the flow. I promise, I won't hurt you."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "No, I've only just narrowed it down to twelve possible scenarios."
Sherlock stuck out his tongue, inviting John's hand. He obliged, sticking three sticky fingers in and moaning as Sherlock sucked. "Fuck, Sherlock."
Sherlock's entire body shuddered. "Oh, God, yes. Please suck my cock. John, please."
John ran his mouth up Sherlock's spine. "Of course I did. I wouldn't lie to you just to get you out of your pants."
Sherlock Holmes: So when did your mother abandon you?
John leaned forward and mouthed at Sherlock's half-hard cock. "What do you want?"
"So hard even after that blowjob I just gave you?" John asked, a huff of warm breath on his cock making Sherlock shudder as John leaned forward. "Don't worry, love. I'll make you see stars in a few minutes."
The only other man in the room, the man who'd walked in on John and Sherlock, sat at the bar. He was smirking into his cup of tea as he sent out a quick text:
Holmes smirked at John. “Piss off. Now, come on, we have work to do.”
“Good boy,” Sherlock breathed, looking at John’s exposed body with undisguised lust. “Now turn around and grab your ankles.”
Barista:*nods* Yes, yeas it is. In about 5 minutes you will start to feel the room spin, I can tell you it won't really be pleasant.
Sherlock Holmes: True.
Sherlock's back went ramrod straight. "I don't..." he began slowly. "Up until last night, I'd never actually..."
"Ye- ahhh," he cried out, voice getting higher. "Fucking- yes!"
The second one came just as swiftly, landing on his other cheek. Prepared this time, Sherlock bit back a moan. It stung a bit, yeah, but more than being painful, it was pleasurable.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: I'm just a girl, who spends far too much time thinking about a certain criminal. That's all you really need to know.
Sherlock Holmes: Oh, one of THOSE types. *hic* Don't accept themselves so they can't hear about themselves from others.
Sherlock licked a stripe up my shaft with his hot, wet, wicked tongue, swirling around my swollen head. "Tell me. What do you want?"
John shrugged. "Guess you'll never know unless you do it."
John followed him up the stairs obediently. “Work?”
“Yes. Here and now. On my desk.” Holmes’ voice was nearly hypnotic, and watching his eyes darken with lust was enthralling. God, this was fucked up, but John wanted it so badly. “Fuck,” his professor swore suddenly, closing his eyes in irritation.
Sherlock Holmes: A computer? A human? A war hero... or a criminal? Oh, sorry. Wrong role.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: I'm no reporter, sir, we've never met before...But, to answer your question, it is a lot of things about him that I like.
John Watson: WHA.....I....I....UH....
A T-Rex Who Speaks Human: but needed
John pulled back, an absolutely predatory look in his eyes. "Bedroom. Yours. Closer," he managed as they fumbled backwards, surprisingly not bumping into anything.
Sherlock's mouth popped open and a blush slowly crept up his neck. His pupils dilated ever so slightly as he sucked in a deep breath. "Ohh." It was an almost indecent moan. "You wouldn't...?"
"Oh." John cleared his throat, quite pleased with himself. "Right. You said you knew I would walk in on you. Why-?"
-and I was spiraling, spiraling, my mouth opened and maybe I made a sound, but maybe not; hot, wet semen all over my hand and down the front of my trousers, knees wobbling-
Sherlock was wanking in the shower! Sherlock bloody Holmes, who found emotion so appalling and had never shown interest in anyone, was getting himself off.
John felt his cock leaking and he hadn't even touched himself. He hadn't been hard so many times in twenty four hours since he was in college. "Stop. Stop," John growled, pinning the younger man's arms above his head. Sherlock's eyes snapped open, wild and dark. He had been closer than John had thought.
Sherlock Holmes: Hello.
Sherlock Holmes: A teenaged girl with an obsessive type personality, probably an ISFJ personality.
teen!nerd!wearing lingerie underneath clothing!Castiel (Destiel, jock!Dean?): Oh..
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: Yeah
Jim Moriarty: Because I can be. I could ask you the same question.
For several minutes all that could be heard in the bedroom was Sherlock panting. John had taken a step back, watching impassively as Sherlock slowly accepted the fact that he would not reach orgasm today.
Sherlock Holmes flopped dramatically onto his couch, seemingly unaware of the almost full cup of tea in his hand. "John."
The last word came out as almost a moan as John pressed the button to increase the intensity of the vibration.
John padded over to the toilet, grateful that Sherlock never put the lid down. Not that he had any reason to; he didn't have a girlfriend or a fiancée or a wife. He quietly unzipped his trousers, glad that the water pounding on the tile floor was so loud.
He said it so simply, as if reading off a shopping list. John cleared his throat.
King Artoria Pendragon: They never questioned me so.
“If you would be willing, I don’t see why not. We’re both consenting adults.”
"That was my first kiss."
Sherlock jumped, crying out at the sudden bite of pain that jolted up his body. John had grabbed the riding crop from the wardrobe while Sherlock had been turned away, not giving any warning before his first blow.
Sherlock Holmes: World famous consulting detective, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
King Artoria Pendragon: I never quite understood that either.
Sherlock Holmes: England? That's where I live, yet I'm not at all familiar with you.
This is a conversation between Barista and yourself, Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock Holmes: So your name is Castiel? I'm Sherlock. Obviously.
"But you're not tight ob boney. You've gone full tibe at the surgery and just got a raise. You've never used the carb before. You're too stubborn. You always pay. So either you're out on boney, or you're saving up for... oh."
"Fuck! John," he cried out, hips thrusting.
After several minutes John pulled away, breathing heavily. "You git, if you would've continued I wouldn't have been able to do it."
"Oh. OH," I gasped. "Sherlock, wh-?"
Sherlock's head fell back, sharp cheekbones going pink in his arousal. "No."
"Yes, sir," Sherlock breathed. "Please, just... take me." He sounded so open and vulnerable, and John nearly decided to slam into him without lubing up. However, his brain was only a split second slower than his dick.
Sherlock racked his sex-addled brain, trying to think. What on earth was he expecting? Oh- "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," Sherlock gasped, clenching around John.
John rubbed a hand over his face. "Do you liked getting sucked off then?"
"Oh," he rumbled, head tilting back. "You meant it?"
John made quick business of Sherlock's shirt and trousers, pausing briefly on his pants. "The more aroused you are, the easier the beginning will be," he explained (as if he needed an excuse to touch Sherlock.)
"Bend over again," John commanded, and Sherlock obeyed.
The Woman: *opens a cabinet* Got it! *takes a box out and puts a bag in a mug*
Sherlock Holmes: I'm from London. 221B Baker Street, to be exact. If you ever find yourself in a rough situation, call on me.
He slowly drew out of Sherlock until only his head was inside of him. "You can toss yourself off, but don't cum," John warned. Immediately one of Sherlock's arms left the tank and went to his cock.
John rubbed his thigh comfortingly. "Shh, it's okay, just breathe."
Sherlock Holmes: Do you have a name?
John snorted. "That poor bloke has no idea what he walked in on."
Barista:*nods* That's pretty good that you remember that from memory
I nodded tersely as he slowly slid the drawer open and dug around in it, obviously relishing the attention. Finally, with flourish, he procured a small tube of lubricant and-
John knocked hesitantly at his ex-professor’s door. He heard what sounded like an elderly lady call something and a second later footsteps. Only a few seconds later the door was opened and there stood Holmes. He smiled, opening the door wider and allowing John to enter.
It was
Until what? Sherlock shook his head violently, trying to clear it. “No, no, I should call her.” He drew out the phone and tried to pull up her number. “She’ll be furious if…if something happens and I didn’t tell her right away. I’d better call her.”
He would let it, though, obviously. It would be worth it.
“Fine,” Sherlock said. He moved off towards the bed to unbutton his shirt.
John sighed, and his hips hitched again, rutting half-heartedly at the sheets beneath. He could barely move them, though, what with Sherlock’s weight pressing down on his lower back, and
He huffed out a small laugh as he moved back through the crowd toward the kitchen with his empty tray. Maybe he should just go to America. He could pull there in a heartbeat, surely.
“Not really, Mike.” Sherlock’s voice was a still a bit stiff. “Christmas is a time for those with someone they love in their lives.”
Sherlock shrugged, half-smiling. “We usually do.”
“Sherlock…” John said suddenly; his heart had lodged in his throat.
Sherlock, so suddenly it surprised even
you, so you’d never been able to talk about it, even though you might have wanted to…"
Harry’s Christmas Eve party was going to be a nightmare, like it always was. There would be hordes of people John didn’t know, prodding him about his love life and asking him all sorts of questions that would just make him want to shrivel up and die. They didn’t know it, obviously. But that didn’t help.
“I won’t.” John’s eyes shone with mirth. “It’s gonna take a lot more than being shanked by some bastard in a back alley, believe me.”
“Hello!” he shouted up the stairs as he stepped inside.
“You don’t deserve that,” he said, and it came out sharp and bitter.
Eventually, John realized dimly that he’d just been
much unlike Mycroft’s was his handsome sharp jawline and light blue eyes, with long eyelashes that a shade lighter than the soft blond fringe they sat under. He wore a light blue button-down underneath a grey jacket, with his hands clasped behind his back, seemingly ready for orders.
John gave a little nod, but his expression slipped a bit. He looked unsure of what to say next.
mine,” Sherlock muttered, bitterly. “And no, he’s English, but his dad’s got a new job so he’s moving there, and that’s the end of my life as I know it.”
The ache in John's side - most likely, though it could have been the headache or the dry throat or the stiffness in his joints - was what pulled him out of sleep.
He’d abandoned the mug and was following the pages, hurrying down towards the pond.
as he took a step back. It was a man’s body, a tall man, who’d just come round the corner.
He trailed off. Harry was already talking again. Doing his best not to look at Sherlock, John shuffled off of his lap and swung his legs over the side of the bed, facing away from him.
he bent down to check the passenger’s shoes, Sherlock
“Sirius can. If you know where to look, you can see it on virtually every night of the year, no matter the weather. Why do you think it was so important for marine navigation?”
Through a sitting room, another ornate hallway. He spread his arms, raised them above his head, shook his head back and forth with abandon. He swayed his way into the second-floor ballroom, and gracefully sidestepped past pillars and danced around a claw-footed chair.
“But I’m really glad to see you now,” he whispered.
Sherlock could hear his blood pounding in his eardrums. He clenched his hands in his lap, then folded them across his chest, fiddled with the buttons on his coat, smoothed away the dust from the windowsill. He couldn’t seem to find a comfortable place for them, or keep them still long enough in any one position. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the fingers on John’s hands – John’s beautiful, strong, nimble hands – drumming out patterns on the seat between them. Out of necessity, he laced his own fingers together and clenched them, needing to physically stop himself from pulling John towards him by the hand to snog him right in the back of this bloody cab.
Janine stared over at him too, looking amused. “Probably. I think it all hangs on the next song.”
By the door, Carol-Anne brushed her hair out of her eyes with a deliberate sweeping gesture.
“I just thought I’d pop back in and see if she was better.” John tossed his coat on a nearby chair.
Sherlock gave another sob that was halfway to a laugh, and kissed him again.
And now Sherlock’s heart explodes in panic.
John couldn’t breathe, couldn’t speak, could barely see – any moment now, it was all going to burst out from him and drown them both.
“You’re sure you don’t mind me going without you?” he asked again, moving toward her to grab his wallet from the nightstand.
John, however, moved to the table and set his own tray down on it. “So, I thought maybe we might check that video thing out?”
After a few more fruitless passes over a page so filled with jargon he could have drowned in it, Sherlock dropped his pen on the coffee table and rubbed at his temple. Maybe he should just call it a night. Get one of his secretaries to give him a Cliffsnotes version of it on Boxing Day.
John kept glancing up at the map on the screen in front of his seat, watching the little dot get closer and closer to his destination, and tried not to think about Sherlock’s parting words as he’d left his flat that morning.
John’s face had managed to stay mashed against his weakened fist, and he raised it – slowly, because a massive crick suddenly made itself known in the left side of his neck. He groaned a little.
“Boarding pass, madam?” the attendant asked the next customer.
They were on a case, they couldn’t do this, they absolutely couldn’t do this now, but they were so close,
That’s it. It’s over. Moriarty’s body tumbled off the cliff, the ghost of a laugh still on his upturned lips. Again. Sherlock didn’t stay to see it fall.
John grinned back as a he felt a small weight lift from his chest. “Perfect,” he said, and reached across the table to thread his fingers through Sherlock’s, hoping to coax that remaining anxiety out of him, hoping Sherlock would let him shoulder some of it. Sherlock’s brow smoothed into contentment as he brought the phone up to his ear and let it ring, but somehow John didn’t feel quite as relieved as he thought he would.
He brushed one last time over the very centre of him before drawing his fingers out, and was prompt in reaching for the lube again. John watched his eyes fall closed as he gave himself a few indulgent strokes, slicking himself well thorough; the last lingering bit of caution.
The radio in the car was broken, so they drove in total silence. But it was a different silence then back at the villa. This felt emptier. Like they
Now, as Sherlock stepped out of the lift and into the glass-panelled conference room that the force had given to him as a makeshift office while he was here, the nerves and irritation that he’d been feeling constantly throughout this case began to ebb slightly. He knew it was down to the wire and he needed to concentrate – there was still vital information to find out about the suspect and strategies to finalize for tonight – but the thought of John at his side once again made warmth bloom in his chest. In just four hours, John would be here with him, smiling and saying things and being amazing, brilliant
With shaky hands Sherlock rubbed slow, soothing patterns across John’s back, smoothed up his neck and threaded fingers through damp strands of silver-blond hair, until John’s breath evened out and his pulse slowed to a steady, firm beat. He lifted his head sluggishly, eyes still closed, seeking Sherlock’s lips without coordination, and Sherlock leaned forward to offer them. John’s mouth was warm and wet, his lips swollen red from kissing, and Sherlock pushed his tongue gently past them to stroke broadly along John’s own, licking softly and slowly into that inviting space, and John responded in kind, angling his face to kiss Sherlock deeply, if a bit clumsily, one strong hand coming up to sweep gently along Sherlock’s jaw.
“You on a break already?” John asked, sitting down next to him.
Sherlock pushed his tongue greedily past John’s lips, and John moaned lowly as he responded with enthusiasm. The heat of his mouth was warm and inviting; he tasted like coffee and biscuits, like 20-year-old Scottish whiskey, like
He straightened up just as quickly, looking around the street to see if anyone was around, but it was empty. He cleared his throat, took one last look at the door and, grinning broadly in a way no one else needed to see, set off.
Sherlock thought about his father when he’d been very young – he remembered him as sandy-haired and full-bellied, always keen to take Sherlock, Mycroft and Redbeard on adventures. Pretending to be the monster when Sherlock was a pirate on the high seas, or his second-in-command when he’d been flying above the highest mountains. He’d been the one to patch him up when Sherlock had come home dirty and bruised, and the one to sneak the boys extra portions of dessert under the table, with a mischievous gleam in his eye and a gentle laugh. Dad was thinner now, and had aged so much, but Sherlock wondered if he could still laugh like that.
A powerful jolt shot up John’s spine as Sherlock scissored his fingers slightly. John cried out softly into the mattress. God, he loved those fingers, those long, deft, gorgeous fingers. They could draw pleasure out of him as if it were a science, touch him in ways that he never knew were possible. They felt so incredible inside him, John felt he was going to lose his mind if Sherlock kept teasing him like this.
“I started this thing years ago, you know?” John said, vaguely in Sherlock’s direction as he pulled the newest sheet from the typewriter and set it on the stack. “But then I didn’t really have time for it when I was in the army, and I was a mess when I got back.” He stabbed at the keyboard again, writing mostly by muscle memory. “And I just kept putting it off.”
“The tumor has shrunk since the previous x-ray – quite a bit, actually.” And now Dr. Moore had pulled out a dark translucent sheet and was looking over it, like he might look over an interesting curio at an auction. “And it looks like the ongoing treatment is going to make it
Sherlock fiddled with the phone in his hands, going over his footage in his mind again. He’d probably replay it tonight, watching that look on John’s face. That smile. His eyes closed as he danced.
“Oh,” he said, gently.
. The fact that it wasn’t something new wasn’t the best sign, but it was better for her than just absorbing mindless stuff from the television screen. This was good. This was okay.
The relief that crashed over him was painful in its intensity. It struck him in the centre of his chest and spread out like pins and needles over every nerve. It flooded over the wasted mechanisms of his mind and washed out hours of built-up anxiety and terror and left him light-headed, whirling.
Come follow me on
husband wasn’t anywhere
“You…can’t know that.” Sherlock’s words were hoarse, bitten off. “You could still be at risk…exerting yourself too much. You…” He let out a breathy moan as John nipped gently below his ear. “You could…tear your stitches, you could –
,” John said with fervour. Only once the words were out of his mouth did he realize how smitten they sounded, but Sherlock looked pleased to hear them.
“Actually, I
John glanced at Sherlock, whose brow was furrowed. John gave a breathy chuckle.
Sherlock’s movements slowed a bit, his lips parted slightly in surprise.
“Don’t be such an arse.”
Sherlock had opened his mouth in indignation, but John spoke quickly before Sherlock had the chance. “Fine.” He was giving Lestrade a satisfied grin. “Quickly now, we need to get there before dusk.”
John liked to remind Sherlock that events like these were good opportunities to repair some of the bitterness towards them that went around the Yard because of their notoriety and virtual free reign over any case Lestrade gave them – but he was also smart enough to know that it was probably best not to make Sherlock do it himself. In fact, John was charming enough to wipe out any bad feelings in one conversation or less, so it may be worth it to hang around a bit longer. For the sake of next year’s cases, anyway.
“Oh, Sherlock…”
This was it. The moment had come, and suddenly John’s mind had quieted down into calmness, too.
Sherlock tried to smile. John was looking politely confused.
“I will never doubt again,” said Buttercup.
“Good,” Sherlock said, kissing at the hair above John’s temple.
Sherlock smirked, pushing the covers away and pulling John to his feet. “If I did, you know you’re not allowed to have it yet.”
The feeling of excitement that had been bubbling in his chest for weeks now seemed to have congealed into a solid mass. His mind was still stuck on confusion, unable to process anything that was happening.
The house was quiet on Christmas Eve. Just a bare-bones staff on tonight, the rest were at home with their families. Even Mycroft hadn’t been able to escape dinner with Mum and Dad, though they’d graciously let Sherlock off to do his duty to his country. Sherlock imagined he wouldn’t be hearing the end of that from his brother any time soon.
The water’s up to his neck.
He grabbed a kebab from the plate and bit into it. Dad turned the page of his newspaper, looking fond.
, Sherlock. And that’s because of you – you saved me, you brought me back. You took care of me.” John offered him a weak smile, his heart soaring when he saw some of the tension in Sherlock’s brow release in return. “You were with me through everything – even when I was the world’s most awful patient, you stayed with me.”
Sherlock swallowed, pinching his lips a little. There was something about the way Magnussen said it that he didn’t like.
Without a word, Sherlock moved away from the telly and stood behind John’s chair.
, especially when it was just the two of them here at home, where he was more comfortable showing it.
John paid the driver and hurried inside. The bell clinked as the door swung open, and he planted himself at the nearest barstool, dropping his bag beside him.
“Yeah,” John replied. He struck out for something else to say,
Sherlock’s smile was eclipsing everything else in the world – it was brighter than the sun, brighter than the entire

been unwanted – that maybe it had been John who’d begun it, who’d
– but afraid to move at all for fear of shattering the moment.
It was one of those cheap, overly springy mattresses. The duvet wasn’t exactly soft, but the sheets were clean and pressed. John tugged off his jumper and his jeans, and the relief was immediate – a kind of insignificant luxury you can only feel grateful for after an especially long day, when suddenly even a shoddy hotel room feels like a relief.
“You mean that?”
John reached up to thread his fingers through the hair at Sherlock’s nape, feeling how soft, how beautiful, how
just…get pissed and watch the Christmas specials…”
Something like panic rose up in Sherlock’s throat, and he saw John’s eyes widen in turn.
He hadn’t planned on
“Sherlock!” Lestrade greeted him jovially as he rounded the corner. “We were just talking about everything – nasty business, isn’t it?”
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson, a noted paragon of taste,” Sherlock grinned back at him. “Almost as much as you.”
“You’re gonna be my husband,” John gasped out, incredulous because it felt like a dream, a wild desperate wish, but it was
Sherlock flung himself into the passenger seat, almost throwing his violin into the backseat as his dad started the car. They had long lost sight of the car John had been in by the time they got out of the car park, but Dad pressed the pedal to the floor and began weaving in and out of the traffic, flying off to Heathrow at a breakneck pace.
“I promise I won’t look,” John said, turning away. Sherlock smirked.
John gave a little sigh into his mouth, kissed him again. It was nice, having him pressed this close, having to hold him so tightly to keep them both in place on the narrow mattress. They laid there, sharing indulgent, blissful kisses, and John expected to let them carry them both off back into slumber. But now, he actually didn’t much feel like going back to sleep. This was too lovely.
He pushed the front door open, and a familiar face spun around to greet him. It was David, their next-door neighbour, stood in the kitchen.
Sherlock’s eyes were locked onto him. The way the lights were shining down on him made his outline glow, like
John giggled again. He let his legs tangle with Sherlock’s. “Are your feet hanging off the mattress?”
“Uh –” Sherlock stammered out. “No, I’m not.”
“Well…” he said, and halted. He felt suddenly tongue-tied. Everything he could possibly say felt like too much and yet still inadequate – but he couldn’t just leave without something,
he knew, that Sherlock understood him perfectly.
Eventually, he felt Sherlock shift above him. He was moving to get up.
John chuckled, but decided against further comment. If playing in the band really
“E tua digitação muito lento,” he said.
in this freezing, lifeless hellhole of a city, which had even less London-esque vitality than Sherlock had dared hope, was bad enough. To be here without John was intolerable. They hadn’t been separated so long in all the time they’d been together –
John was looking from Sherlock to the cards, but otherwise not moving a muscle.
He’s going to die here.
This was mental.
Over Lestrade’s shoulder, Sherlock caught Mycroft grinning softly up at him; he offered a weak smile in return, and Mycroft inclined his head ever so slightly, as if to say,
He signed his name, over and over. Papers were sprawled out all over the table, the stack still to be signed piled up on the next chair over. It never seemed to end.
John gave him a little nod, and began to press in lightly with his fingertips, moving them in slow circles.
“Some more than others,” he muttered.
All the blood in John’s body seemed to rush to his cheeks, and he turned his face to the side.
“Yes.” She paused for a bit, then added. “Um – I might be able to dig out an air mattress from storage –”
“Who invited him anyway? Prat!” came another.
“Hey, Sherlock.”
“That’s – that’s good. It’s
Silence fell over the stage. Sherlock stood next to the bass player, his bow perched on top of the violin strings. Beside them, on two rows of bleachers, stood the choir, all seemingly holding their breath.
His footsteps gradually faded away, and John let his shoulders relax a bit. He turned toward Sherlock tentatively, afraid of what he might find in his expression, but all he could see was his own relief reflected back.
It sounded terrible, even to his own ears, and Mrs. Hudson must have thought so too, because she was giggling lightly.
“There’s a very strong feeling in the party that we must make it clear that we won’t allow anything like the disrespect we received from their last administration,” Alex said.
But the thought made him feel less than content. He stepped back and sat at the wooden desk, which looked directly out the doors and into the beautiful grounds. Perfectly inspiring.
“More,” Sherlock crooned into his mouth, and that low baritone shot straight down John’s spine, making his toes curl.
“This was –
“Yeah,” David said again. It looked like he was clenching his hands in his pockets.
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded his recognition.
“But wouldn’t it be great,” Sherlock went on, resting his chin on his steepled fingers next to the microphone. “If the number one song this Christmas wasn’t some smug teenager, but an old ex-cocaine addict searching for a comeback at any price? Come Christmas, those young popsters will be half naked throwing back tequila shooters, and I’ll be sitting in some flat with my manager, John,” he nodded towards the door of the booth, “fucking miserable because our fucking gamble didn’t pay off.”
“Deep and crisp and even.” Sherlock sang with him, thrown and casting around for the right words. “Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel…”
A soft “oh,” was all he could get out, overcome as he was. But neither of them seemed to mind.
“Sherlock…”
But the last bit of restraint in him snapped at the sound – the sound of his name in that beloved voice, simple and earnest. John surged forward, seizing Sherlock with both hands by the nape of his neck, and kissed him.
But he could hardly be blamed, could he, when Sherlock's miles of legs were naked and splayed like a common whore's, his neck and cheeks pink and blotchy, his hair-dusted chest heaving as his oiled hand tugged at his prick.
His hand, which had been working quickly, slowed as he reached down with his other hand to his puckering hole, lifting his knees and planting his feet closer to his body. It was quite a nice view.
John pulled out his fingers. Sherlock sighed at the sudden emptiness. John gripped his cock and put it to his entrance, slowly putting the very tip in. Sherlock whimpered but didn't move.
Sherlock sniffed, unable to conceal the rush of blood to his face (but thankfully the rush of blood to his crotch was undetectable.) "You're just saying that to make me uncomfortable."
"Relax," John breathed as he gripped the end of the prostrate vibrator. This was always Sherlock's least favourite part.
John jumped, broken out of his reverie. "So what?"
Sherlock Holmes: And I said that I haven't smoked in months, but the cufflinks on my dress shirt says otherwise.
Suddenly, John's grip tightened almost painfully around the detective's cock and he was tugging, up and down and up and down and fuck, Sherlock was cumming-
Sherlock stood and turned, his neck to hairline red, probably from the blood rush. Between them stood Sherlock's dribbling cock, the head red and swollen. John stroked his cock, bringing it back to attention. "When we get home we'll have a proper fuck and I will suck that pretty cock of yours, but now is not the time nor place."
"Oh." Sherlock wasn't sure what else to say. John had seemed so... vanilla. He supposed everyone must have their own thing.
Sherlock Holmes: John?
Sherlock cried out at the sudden intrusion, but lifted his hips up for easier access. John grabbed his hip and pushed him back down forcefully. "Not for you, remember? Don't say a word, not a single word, Sherlock."
The last one was the hardest blow of them all, landing just at the root of his cock. Sherlock cried out, hips bucking into the mattress as a dribble of pre-cum leaked from his aching cock. He rut into the mattress, not caring that it was pathetic.
This is a conversation between teen!nerd!wearing lingerie underneath clothing!Castiel (Destiel, jock!Dean?) and Sherlock Holmes.
"What do you want me to do?" John asked, slightly embarrassed by the breathlessness of his own voice.
"Are you ready?" John finally asked, going to Sherlock's bedside stand and opening the drawer.
Sherlock moaned, loud and long and completely out of his mind with lust as the skinny pole went deeper and deeper into his cock. After about five millimetres, John pulled it back out slowly, leaving just the tip in.
"The one who is about to fuck you senseless," John murmured into Sherlock's ear, and the detective sucked in a deep breath.
Slowly, his first finger traced Sherlock's arsehole. To his embarrassment, it closed up like a clam in its shell.
Jim Moriarty: No, you're not.
He repeated the action a few times until Sherlock seemed comfortable, then he slowly pressed in his finger to the first digit.
Sherlock swallowed, Adam's apple bobbing nervously. "Feelings? I try to avoid feelings at all cost..." He paused, eyes vulnerable and open and bottomless. "Of course I have feelings for you, John Watson."
For several minutes the liquid gushed into John’s colon without complaint. But then, the cramps started. The worst cramps he had ever felt. It was like his abdomen was swelling and would burst at any moment.
Sherlock Holmes: I- oh. OH. I didn't realize fellatio was a laughing matter.
“What’s your favourite book?”
Sherlock Holmes: I admit that during our brief conversation you've went up 100 I.Q. points. You've now in the positives.
“Are you ready for your enema?”
Sam and Dean: Dean: You are one fucked up dude *walks away*
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: People can't choose who they love.
John felt his arousal wilt. The word seemed vaguely familiar, but it caused his balls to shrink up inside his body. “Why the hell would I know where you live?”
John collapsed sideways, next to Sherlock. "Jesus. Jesus Christ," he painted. "So eager... God. Can't wait to fuck you properly."
Sherlock groaned again, spreading his legs further. "Toy out. Rimjob," he grit out, the hand not assaulting his poor prick fisting in John's hair (he knew there was a reason he didn't want to cut it, Jesus fuck.)
"What, this?" John gently brushed his prostate again, grinning when Sherlock's back arched off the bed.
Jim Moriarty: So aren't you going to ask how I did it?
a troll: HOW YOU DOIN
"I told you last night. Giving oral sex and receiving anal sex. But last night's activities proved more than satisfactory."
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: Who are you?
Castiel can be found on Tumblr under the name SuperWhoLockTime99.
A T-Rex Who Speaks Human: Can you figure out how I can talk?
"I've been ready for the past ten minutes," Sherlock huffed, squirming violently. "Just do that again."
His mouth opened silently, face screwed up as he twisted his wrist again, plunging the toy in and out of himself. He cried out, his legs stiffening as he held it deep inside himself. Obviously he'd found his prostate, and then his hand was flying over his cock, making an obscene sound really, skin on skin and wet, his hand was a blur as his hips lifted off the bed once, twice-
Even he knew it was an awful lie. Sherlock barked out a laugh, lifting his feet and turning so he was laying on the couch. "That's the best lie you could come up with?"
Sherlock Holmes: Fantastic, that.
Hiro Hamada: I don't even know what I am. Fourteen. Don't like anybody really. And you wanna go there? I'll go there. When I was six I built a super computer out of steel wool, bubble gum, tooth paste and an iPhone charger.
John was nearly positive that he was joking, but it was hard to tell over text, and especially with his professor… well, it was hard to tell if Holmes was yanking your chain while having a face to face conversation with him (or rather his face to a hundred of his students’ faces.) Just before John could reply with something equally biting, the elevator came and opened.
"Yes," Sherlock replied, voice strained. Even without stimulus, his cock had not flagged or softened. From where he was laying, Sherlock could not see what the doctor was doing, but judging by the sound, he was searching for something small and relatively unused.
“I’m sorry?”
Without thinking, he gripped his now painfully hard cock and squeezed it gently, running it back and forth along his shaft. Shit, it felt good.
His nose was red and his eyes watery; it looked like the lymph nodes in his throat might have been swollen but it was hard to say without feeling them. He certainly did look sick.
"Does it have to be on the mouth?"
Sherlock Holmes: Most people are. Who are you, then?
The drawer closed and John turned back around, holding a small plastic case and a bottle of lubricant. Sherlock's cock twitched as John came closer, opening the case and pulling out the small, ribbed metal rod. It was about as thick and long as a coffee stirrer straw.
Jim Moriarty smiled back easily with a shrug. “Eh, happens to us all. I’m one of those guys who just slips into the background.” His Irish accent made him sound dreamy and quaint.
Sherlock Holmes: See, he thinks that because we're a couple that it means I need to stop being a "self-righteous dick" to him and start treating him with "love and respect". But I can't help being a dick. And every time I tell him that, he says "You are what you eat," and then laughs but I don't get what's so funny.
"Why the hell would I want tobato soub?"
"I'm cumming-" John managed before thrusting one last time (surely that would leave a bruise) and then stilling as he came deep inside the reeling detective.
Feeling about three hundred times better, John opened the door. Sherlock was indeed at the end of the hall, reading a book. He looked up. “Everything alright?”
After several seconds, John pulled back, eyes closed and breathing heavily. "I thought you'd never say that."
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: Why would I?
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: *Glares*
John Watson: Sherlock...
"Right then. Tea, then we'll talk. Put on your robe."
John choked on his cup of tea, quickly setting it back in his saucer. "What?"
Sherlock slowly climbed onto his bed, spreading his legs a bit and resting his head against his pillow. He rubbed his hands together, spreading and warming the lube until he was satisfied. Slowly, he pumped his stiff red cock, mouth opening in silent pleasure. "I like to think... About you... Gagging me with your..." His eyes opened as he gasped, hips bucking as he jacked himself off. "C-cock- and cumming- God... on my face-!"
"Well, it would be slightly more pleasurable if..." Sherlock blushed. "if... I could be more rough with it. I want to... fuck your mouth."
A T-Rex Who Speaks Human: Yes
Without another word, John popped his prick into his mouth like a lolly, bobbing on just the tip. Swirling his head in his mouth, enjoying Sherlock's moans.
He pushed his fingers in further, stilling only when he could go no further. He spread his fingers into a V, getting a muffled cry from Sherlock.
Slowly, John pulled the purple toy out of his lover's arse, the other hand kneading his cheek and his mouth teasing the other.
John felt the blood rush to both his cheeks and his cock. Jesus, it'd only been ten minutes since he came in the shower. "Unless you're trying to get me to take you right over this table, I'd suggest you stop talking about that sort of stuff."
“Jim Moriarty rattles you?” Holmes asked with a smirk. Before John could even ask, he held up a hand to explain. “He approaches me almost daily trying to get my affection. I know his cologne, unfortunately, and he’s the only one I’ve ever smelt it on. But here you are, with Jim’s cologne on, so I deduced you walked by him, at the very least.”
Sherlock Holmes: Books? Jawn's blog has been *hic* published? DAMN IT NOW EVERYONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WILL WANT A PIECE OF MY FINE ARSE
"I want you to suck my cock," I grit out as Sherlock peeled down my pants. Finally.
"You know what," John grit out, eyes squeezing closed and mouth gaping as he got closer to the edge.
Sherlock moaned, relaxing his sphincter. John hummed appreciatively and teased his tongue in and out of Sherlock.
Hiro Hamada: ...okay, maybe you get that. But of course I did, that's, like, step number one. And I know what's wrong with it. This. *hold up my hand and it's glowing underneath the surface* I was trying to think of a way to avoid getting my stuff stolen again, considering the world almost ended last time that happened, so I built a chip that controls all my bots and put it in my hand. I just didn't consider the fact it would /hurt/. Therefore, over load.
-fin-
Sherlock Holmes: What were you doing?
Sherlock Holmes: If you'd like, but I promise I won't care at all.
John huffed indignantly. "Shut up, Sherlock. You're such a prick. It's not like I have... feelings for you. It's a natural reaction."
Sherlock Holmes: Dean... Winchester?
John cocked an eyebrow. Slowly, he leaned forward and ran his lips gently along Sherlock's jawline, trailing them up to his mouth and parting his lips ever so slightly. Sherlock did the same, his body practically melting into John's as his hands found the ex-soldier's cheeks.
Sherlock nodded tersely.
Sherlock whimpered his agreement, arm working furiously at his own cock.
“You can stand up now.”
I couldn't help but chuckle at his voice. "Chicken noodle or tomato? I'll need to run down to Tesco either way."
Sherlock looked up from his laptop matter-of-factly. "Have you ever ejaculated without physical stimulation to your penis?"
"Don't pull something like this again, you twat," the doctor finally snarked, standing and walking out of the bedroom to fetch a wet flannel.
John was staring at the floor. "Sherlock, your pants and trousers are getting wrinkled, love. And if someone comes in, wouldn't it be odd to see trousers laying on the floor?"
Sherlock Holmes: Common mistake. And I know the feeling of the world nearly ending... although I'm always the one who saves the day.
No one, not even Scotland Yard, would know about John's little game.
a troll has left the chatroom.
John gaped at his mobile. Holmes was so blunt… what the hell…?
John sighed as he got out the pan, hoping it sounded irritated instead of relieved. Even if Sherlock knew John had heard him, they weren't having that discussion. Yet.
Jim Moriarty: I think your brother would disagree.
Sherlock Holmes: The fact that you keep up this conversation about stereotypes even though you believe them to be untrue.
"Ready for another finger?"
The Woman: *chuckles* I know, dear.
“My… what?” John’s mind was spinning. Was he wearing a watch? He couldn’t remember. All he could focus on was the proximity of Holmes and the heat quickly building in his naval and oh God, maybe he did like cocks?
‘If I hadn’t known what an enema was before now, I would certainly stay away from you’ John typed in response, smirking at his own wit.
"Fuck, that was good," Sherlock moaned, locking gazes with John once again. "Come on, John. Let me see you cum. I want to lick you clean."
a troll: Wow congratulations to me. I sure feel like a winner today. Thanks to myself, that is, and not to you.
Slowly, slowly, he pressed himself into Sherlock, exhaling only when he was completely sheathed. "You're so fucking tight. Jesus," he breathed. "Alright?"
"I'm going to close the stall door, then take out the plug," John stated.
Sherlock Holmes: I do tend to stretch the truth sometimes, but that's entirely beside the point.
He opened the kitchen door and ducked in, not bothering to say hello to his flatmate. To be fair, the detective had still been in his room, sleeping, when John had left the first time to take Rosie to Molly Hooper's. (God bless that woman for looking after his daughter so often.)
Sherlock's eyes opened his eyes suddenly. They were now dark and promising. "You're-" he began, voice rough with arousal. He cleared his throat. "You're welcome."
I sniffed once, turning with his near-boiling bowl of chicken noodle soup. "No more deductions about that."
John laughed. “Well, I’ve always enjoyed The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkein.”
Sherlock Holmes: I apologize. One of those assumptions is wrong.
"It's okay," John mumbled, stroking Sherlock's limp cock again. It twitched. "I know it's strange."
"Well, there's a first time for everything," John smirked, rearranging so his mouth was over Sherlock's prick and vice versa. Without so much as a word Sherlock took John's entire throbbing cock into his mouth. His throat constricted as he gagged, but impressively he didn't pull back, just sucked. "Fuckkk..." John moaned, trying not to thrust into his mouth.
This is a conversation between A T-Rex Who Speaks Human and yourself, Sherlock Holmes.
John’s head snapped up as an automatic apology sprang from his mouth. “Oh, shit! Sorry. I-” He froze midsentence, staring at the man he had almost walked directly into. His chocolate brown eyes were kind enough, but below the surface he could see a stare so blank that it made his skin crawl. “…didn’t see you there, Jim,” he finished with a strained smile.
a troll: Good job on not sensing my sarcasm there, but that's okay. You do you.
Sherlock Holmes: *smirks* When I was 8, I solved my first murder. Bloody Scotland Yard wouldn't listen, though. And it's okay to be homosexual.
John Watson: SHERLOCK! YOU’RE STILL SMOKING?!?!
“John,” He blurted. Holmes seemed a bit taken aback.
Sherlock Holmes: Although his goals are often bad...
"St-!" Sherlock started, then snapped his mouth closed.
“Mr. Watson, a word?”
Holmes tilted his head, indicating that John was dismissed. Once assured that he hadn’t done any irreparable damage to his phone, John cast his now-former professor a glance. “Okay.”
Hiro Hamada: Dude, know the feeling. Superhero here. Remember the big Callingham incident? Yeah, I solved that. The battle bots going to take over the world? Yep, me. I saved everyone. Every other major superpower and or tech battle; Big Hero 6 to the rescue.
They were in the perfect place, too- the middle of a busy crossroads where a perfectly healthy man had dropped dead. Noise from cars and tourists milling about would cover up the slight buzzing sound of Sherlock's plug.
John snorted, stumbling over to his chair and plopping down. "What about you? When you're reasonabon- reasonable? Because that's NEVER."
Sherlock took a step closer to John, shutting and locking the door behind him and pinning John against the door. He leaned in close to John’s ear. “Because that’s why you came here, John. You want me to fuck you. You’re already hardening just from my voice. Can you imagine what it will feel like when I’m pounding your tight little ass? Because I can. And fuck, it feels good.”
a troll: One? So which, may I ask, assumption do you believe to still be true?
Sherlock Holmes: WOAH THERE MR. SASSY-PANTS.
"Keep the change," Sherlock said, voice dripping with lust. John shuffled as his cock stirred again.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, popping open the top button to his trousers. "I'll say it again: I didn't calculate the effect coffee would have on the paracetamol."
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: Yeah
“Ex professor,” John mumbled to himself just as Sherlock re-entered.
"Help me, I broke apart my insides, help me, I've got no soul to sell, help me, the only thing that works for me, help me get away from myself-"
Sherlock Holmes: If I don't notice you leaving the flat, I'm sure you could say whatever you like without me processing it.
"We need to talk to witnesses, get firsthand accounts," Sherlock muttered to John.
John Watson: I'm still mad at you, you know...
"Say it and I will," John smirked, eyes going impossibly darker. Bloody hell.
Sherlock moaned in response, his higher  brain functions having abandoned him for the moment. His hips thrust up and into John's hand, bringing him closer and closer to orgasm.
John cleared his throat, closing his laptop and setting it aside. "What do you mean?"
teen!nerd!wearing lingerie underneath clothing!Castiel (Destiel, jock!Dean?): Nice to meet you, Sherlock.
Hiro Hamada: *Huffs, crossing arms and pouting* jerk. Still bet I'm smarter than you. One thing I've got going for me, my head.
Sherlock's tongue went between his first and middle finger before he pulled back and said quite mischievously, "Oh, I plan to."
Three...
The right side of his face pressed into the duvet. It was soft, made with goose down and satin. It had been a gift from a client, given to him after he had solved the-
“So, clearly you understand my concerns, Mrs. Williams?”
And, even better, Sherlock knew John loved him back.
“Thank you for all your help, Sherlock. Really.” There was a soft, genuine quality to his voice. It made Sherlock want to collapse. “Just a bit longer, and this will all be over.”
A rough, harsh scream ripped itself from Sherlock’s throat, and he slammed his fist into the concrete wall nearest to him. It hurt. He didn’t care. His knees gave out, crumpling him to the ground. A man laden with shopping bags behind him started backwards in alarm. Sherlock barely saw him. He could barely see anything.
He pulled the first card away and dropped it near the CD player, revealing the next one.
Sherlock chortled. “And you say
But of course, John couldn’t hear him. The glass was sound-proof, obviously.
He felt Sherlock’s fingers ease their way out of him, gently, and his hands rubbing up and down his back, grounding him, bringing him back to his body. And oh, John’s every cell was sated with pleasure – his limbs were heavy, his mind utterly blissed out. It had been weeks since he’d felt this good.
“Do you think
His shoulder sagged a little, and he shivered. He was working outside today, on the little table out by the pond. But although the sun was out, there was a chilly breeze, and John’s jumper wasn’t warding it off. Still, it was a good place to write – he’d done quite a lot today. Or maybe his troubling thoughts were just good creative fuel.
At last, John opened his mouth – his lips were trembling a little – and let out a shaky laugh.
Sherlock sighed, sitting up and opening his blue grey eyes. "John, you're drunk. We can talk tomorrow when you're reasonable."
“Yes, sir?” John turned to his Forensics professor. John hadn’t ever really seen him up close; from the way he talked and acted, he would have assumed that Professor Holmes was in his forties. However, the man standing before him seemed hardly older than he was- 26, tops. He must’ve been some sort of prodigy to already have gotten a doctorate and secured such a stable job.
King Artoria Pendragon: No it wasn’t.
"You know, you can say the word 'fuck'. We're both adults," John smirked.
This is a conversation between a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty and yourself, Sherlock Holmes.
“Have you ever considered being a doctor?” Holmes smiled, blue-grey eyes lightening in amusement. As if he knew the internal conflict John was experiencing.
Sherlock was laying in bed, sprawled out with piles of used tissue on the floor beneath him. "I'b sick," he humph'ed.
"So?"
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: I'm sorry if my interest in Mr. Moriarty offends you.. I would like to be your friend, not become your enemy because of it.
For someone who didn't have much experience in anal sex, it seemed to me like he was moving much too quickly; a third finger was added, and they spread apart and back together, stretching him out enough for his toy. His hand had stilled around his cock, instead letting his hips snap up and into his fist. His head was red and swollen, a steady stream of precum dripping down over the knuckle of his thumb.
Sherlock Holmes: *downs them all in one go* What's in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name, would smell as sweet.
John exhaled out his nose as way of a laugh, pushing the rest of his first finger in. Sherlock's mouth opened and his fingers gripped the sheets, but he stayed impressively silent.
John Watson: So I can say whatever I want and you wouldn't exactly process it?
"Well, the dead man just looked at his watch, glanced around as if he was looking  for a cab or something, and he just collapsed. Bloody weird."
The Woman: *thinks for a second* I think we have some, if that's what you want.
Sherlock smirked, running his forefinger along the rim of the cup. "What, 'every time  I orgasm I picture you pleasuring me in various scenarios'? I think that might have been a bit too strong of a come on."
a troll: Even other ordinary creatures deserve to apologize for their many failures.
John removed his blazer and undershirt first, blushing as he bared his chest. He was glad that he had some muscle at least. Next John pulled down his trousers. All he had left was his boxers now… Sherlock was smirking at him and oh God, those eyes… and that voice… Almost without thinking, John removed his pants and set them hastily in the pile of discarded clothes.
The doctor climbed onto the bed and kneeled between Sherlock's legs, eyeing his cock. Sherlock threw his head back, eagerly waiting for what he knew was coming.
John Watson: Sherlock....
As if reading my mind, one of Sherlock's perfectly sculpted eyebrows went up, but he didn't comment. Instead, he stood and slowly pulled off his trousers, gracelessly kicking them off. They landed in a heap on the floor, and I kept my eyes determined trained on them instead of my now half-naked flatmate.
"Just as good as your's was yesterday," John replied rather boldly he thought, clearing his throat.
John reached into his pocket and pulled out a small tube of lube. "Do you feel stretched enough?"
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: I thought he only kept files on people of use or interest to him?
No username given this time either.
"Yes," he replied breathlessly. "I'll try. Just... enough of this." His hand fluttered, indicating to John and himself. "I just want... want..."
"Want you to rip off your clothes and jack off. Better yet, I'll rip off your clothes and jack you off. Or, I could give you a prostate orgasm?"
a troll: "THOSE"? Whatchu implying here Holmes?
"Touch-" he managed, voice low and gravelly and Jesus, how could a voice be so arousing, another few words and he'd have John cumming in his pants like a randy teenager; did Sherlock want John to touch him or touch himself, or was it merely a statement, yes John I am touching myself in our shared living space, feel free to start the kettle?
"You're ordering for us," John muttered to Sherlock.
Sherlock looked sheepishly up from his mug. "I don't have enough data to make that judgement."
That's when Sherlock shifted, slipping down in his chair and legs raising into the air. John only got to appreciate the view for a second before he noticed it- a handle of some sort sticking out of Sherlock's bum. John's entire body convulsed when he imagined something considerably more fleshy and personally satisfying being lodged up the detective's arse.
Barista:*laughs* Well, that might work for maybe a few hours, but not as long as he hopes for romance.
Sherlock Holmes: iPhones weren't even a thing when I was 20, let alone 6. Or that would've been me.
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: Oh, that
Sherlock Holmes: You haven't happened to have heard of Jim Moriarty, have you?
"Alright, you win," Sherlock mumbled, neck and cheeks going pink. "Just don't stop doing whatever that is."
John Watson: What...Jesus, Sherlock.
The last words came out as a high-pitched keen as Sherlock flung his arm over his eyes, thrusting into his fist furiously.
I wrote this as a birthday present to myself. Sherlock practices karaoke. John gets uncomfortable.
John blinked. "So you use your imagination?"
Sherlock Holmes: Hello, Your Majesty.
So, on Christmas Eve morning, I grabbed a step stool, a nail, and a bunch of mistletoe, and hung it over the door to the second floor of the flat. Pleased, I went back upstairs before Sherlock woke up, and continued my morning like normal.
"Do you agree that you deserve to be punished?"
"For God's sake, John, are you really going to stand here while I rub one out?" Sherlock sighed, running a hand through his black curls.
Sherlock's mouth fell open in a silent gasp as John sat up and reached for the lube. He coated his hands, using one to pump his own shaft and the other tracing Sherlock's arsehole.
Buzz. ‘By the way, don’t be frightened. Many people find enemas quite enjoyable. Arousing, even. -SH’
Sherlock blinked once at John before looking back down to his computer screen.
Sherlock Holmes: And Charles Augustus Magnussen.
The detective could hear John moving about behind him, could hear the slither of ropes, and he had a good idea as to what the doctor was doing. He rolled his neck, steeling himself for a long afternoon.
Very, very slowly, his third finger slid into Sherlock. He took in a sharp breath and held it until his face was red, finally puffing it out.
Sherlock Holmes: Aren't you the one who designed that space toilet?
Sherlock rolled off of John, collapsing onto the couch. After several minutes of heavy breathing and shock, Sherlock reached under himself and pulled out the microphone.
Pleasantly buzzed, Sherlock and I stumbled up the stairs to the second floor, laughing at something that neither of us remembered. It wasn't until Sherlock looked up at the doorframe that I remembered.
Sherlock stepped back. “Good. You may climb into the bathtub and take the doggy position. You are familiar, yes?”
Sherlock Holmes: Is Cas a *hic* top or bottom? I'd be either for *hic* you... but don't tell Jawn...
"It was for an experiment!"
Holmes let out a snort. “Point well made, Mr. Watso- John. Here’s my number.” He pulled a phone out of his pocket and typed a few numbers. John patted his jacket, trying to find his.
His toes tingled and warmth spread up his legs, his cock was twitching, God, would it be worth starting over just to cum?
John laughed. “Yes. This will be a… new experience.”
Sherlock Holmes: Oh. Sorry. I thought you might be an old friend of mine. Making tea?
Sherlock was laying on the couch, hands steepled as if in prayer. He glanced up at John before closing his eyes again. "One too many Jack Daniels?"
John stiffened his tongue and poked it in slowly, only stopping when his lips touched the sweaty, musky skin around his arse. He thrust it in and out, eyes closing as he focused. Thank God he had done this before or he would be completely clueless.
King Artoria Pendragon: Hence. *Motions to herself*
Finally, they made it to Sherlock's bed. John pushed the detective onto it, quickly taking off his jumper and trousers.
The kitchen was just as it was last night (clean, for once, which is the only reason that I knew it hadn't been disturbed.) Bathroom door was open. Which left-
I cleared my throat, cock stirring. This was going to be harder than I anticipated. I tried to remind myself that he was mentally unwell, but deep down I knew that this afternoon wasn't really a suicide attempt, just a mistake on his part that had serious repercussions.
Sherlock Holmes: Yes, John?
Sherlock reached up and began to unbutton his shirt, but John stopped him. "Ah ah, that's my job."
Sherlock's hand was getting erratic around his cock now. "Fuck- John, I'm going to cum- fuck!"
Sherlock Holmes: Ah! Now that's a name I recognize. Although I wasn't aware you were real... or still alive.
"Suit yourself. There is a reason I do this, you know," he continued conversationally as he squirted a fair amount of lube onto his palms- water based, I expected something more posh- and warmed it. "Check for lumps or other signs of testicular cancer, bulging or swelling in my prostate, consistency of my ejaculate."
Sherlock smirked knowingly up at me, watery blue eyes alight with joy. Even sick and half-dead looking, he was breathtaking. "Gold? Silver? Titanium? Or sobething bore unusual? I've always liked Tungsten. One of by favourite elebents." He blew delicately on a spoonful of the soup, cautiously placing it in his mouth.
He closed his eyes and pulled up all the porn he'd watched. It seemed to him most people enjoyed being vocal and that the rougher the sex, the better. Sherlock felt himself shudder at the thought, whether in excitement or nerves he wasn't sure.
"Joh-" Sherlock cried out, eyes flying open. His expression was reminiscent of a man who had just seen the face of God.
This chat was with -loki.holmes- who was Jim Moriarty.
John heard a shift of leather in the living room. He went to the door, one hand clutching the baby bottle and the other raised in greeting, but he quickly lowered it, shutting his eyes and turning away.
"He'll do anything, just for kicks," John added, watching Sherlock out of the corner of his eyes. His hands, neatly clasped behind his back, were turning white from him holding them so tightly. His lips were parted and he was breathing shallowly, struggling to keep his eyes open. A rather pretty pink flush was climbing up his neck.
Sherlock Holmes: Your head? Unless you use a Mind Palace, your head is full of useless fluff.
Sherlock Holmes: Obviously I know how you did it, but that's hardly relevant.
-and he cried out, high and keening, head thrashing as cum spurted out of his cock, trailing the sticky substance down his knuckles and shaft and down his perineum, and my hips were snapping into my fist, seeking friction- and I was getting closer-
The bottle of lube opened with a snap and the cool gel dropped onto the head of the detective's cock. John rubbed it in, paying special attention to Sherlock's slit.
Sherlock Holmes: Moriarty was wrong. He said I wanted everything to be clever... but my opinion on his eyes isn't clever at all. It's factual. You're letting your emotions cloud your judgment as so many people do.
John stood, grabbing Sherlock's hand and pressing his mouth tenderly to the detective's. It was a slow, passionate, almost shy kiss (considering it was one of Sherlock's first kisses, this was understandable.) John ran one hand slowly down Sherlock's back, letting it rest just above the curve of his buttocks. The other hand wrapped around his black curls, tugging ever so gently. Sherlock moaned, breaking away to gasp for air.
"If you're going to apologize, don't bother. I'm sure you won't make the same mistake again."
John stumbled up the last step, narrowly avoiding falling on his face. He grunted, slowly making his to the living room door and pulling open the door.
John chuckled. "Whose is that, anyway?"
'bloody fag should just get it in the arse and stop wanking on his keyboard, that's the only way something this bad could be written'
Barista: Heya Hun, what can I do for ya? *smiles*
Somehow John had ended up right below Sherlock's impromptu stage, close enough to see how dilated the detective's pupils were.
Sherlock Holmes: I have to get back to my case now. It was mildly not-boring talking to you.
John Watson: You know what, Sherlock....and I'M NOT ADDICTED TO PORNOGRAPHY.
Sherlock Holmes: You're familiar?
John's eyes were dark and predatory. Sherlock's heart skipped a beat as John slowly sauntered to the detective, not breaking eye contact. He could feel the anger radiating from the older man, the heat from his gaze pooling directly in Sherlock's abdomen.
Sherlock thought she looked immensely pleased with herself, and felt an annoyed twinge in his gut at the sight of her striding up the aisle. But then, he supposed he wasn’t exactly the most impartial onlooker here.
“Oh, yeah,” he let out, in a low whisper. Sherlock’s hands were warm on his shoulders as he lovingly worked down towards John’s collarbone, still thrusting against him oh so slowly.
“Right,” John muttered, defeated. “Silence, then, I guess.”
He kissed him again to stop himself from saying it.
“Oh – yeah, thanks,” he said weakly. He took the napkin Sherlock was holding out to him, which held a few brittle crostini with what looked like salmon laid on top of them.
John knew, and Sherlock had lost.
“You alright, mate?”
The moment stretched on into an age. Sherlock allowed it to, their eyes locked. The unsaid words were louder than anything he could have ever spoken aloud.
he’d told the driver.
He’d tried to shout, but the stone barely echoes back the whisper that comes out of him. His face is wet now too – warmer though, tears – and his throat is closing up.
, John.”
“Very well.” Mycroft gave an exasperated sigh. “Just remember what I said.”
Sam looked sideways at him.
“You’re going to be alright.” Sherlock swept his fingers tenderly over John’s. “The doctors say you’ll recover quickly as long as you take it easy for a while. They’ll likely keep you in for a week or so, and then you can come home and we’ll stay off cases until you’re better. You’ll be back on your feet in no time, you’ll see.”
“Devo voltar ao trabalho,” he said, lowly.
“Well,” he gestured toward the conference room, his voice resolutely stiff. “You may as well come have a look.”
“Mr. Holmes,” said Dr. Moore, in his usual, curiously inscrutable voice. “And Mr. Watson. Good to see you again.”
Despite himself, he gave a little smirk at the knowing glint in her eye. There was really no getting anything past her.
important.”
He couldn’t tell what time it was, or how long he’d been awake. Time seemed callously unreal at this hour, discarding each precious second behind it like so much dirt.
24. “And later, you’ll drive me home?”
John kissed him, and Sherlock pushed in further, seating himself within John inch by perfect inch – until John was moaning low into Sherlock’s mouth, full of him, surrounded by him, whirling with pleasure as Sherlock buried himself slowly up to the hilt.
“I love you, too.”
“Good,” he said, quietly. “I love you.”
“Christ.”
“Oh, bingo,” John said, softly. “That looks
“I need to be sure,” Sherlock whispered.
And then Sherlock crooked those fingers inside him.
A swelling in the back of Sherlock’s throat halted the flow of his words. He shifted his grip on the scarf, reached down to brush the hair away from John’s temple.
Sherlock nodded again, but didn’t offer anything else. John ushered him in the direction of the house.
“Well, I’d have to be, wouldn’t I? Given that I’m the only one who knows how to navigate?” Sherlock swivelled around to face John completely, walking backwards through the snow.
John’s breath was coming in ragged, sharp gasps of emotion. Sherlock felt like he was breathing for the first time in weeks.
Her lip twitched a little at the corner, like a tiny spasm. “You look distracted.” She said it evenly, but there was an undercurrent of accusation that flowed through it.
Sherlock clung to him desperately, wrapping both his arms around his shoulders and holding him in place, kissing him with deep shuddering gasps. John’s lips were gentle and slow, his mouth opening warmly and readily over Sherlock’s, balancing out Sherlock’s franticness with quiet reassurance. The hand that had been stroking through his curls came forward to thumb tenderly at Sherlock’s cheek, and John started with a sharp breath when he found tears there. He leaned forward and kissed them away, first one side, then the other, and then gathered Sherlock close and pressed a hard, closed-mouth kiss to the base of his hair.
“Hey!” Sam shouted, laughter undermining his indignation.
“John.”
“It was
John could only offer him a sheepish attempt at a smile in return.
“Absolutely.”
Sherlock returned it. John
As John drove back to the villa, the only thing he could see was that vision of Sherlock on the dock, bare and determined, ready to leap.
how awkward he sounded even as the words left his mouth. Sometimes he was so stiff at this parenting thing. It had always irritated Sarah, when it wasn’t amusing the hell out of Sam.
Dad reached out and tried once more to slick Sherlock’s hair back to lie flatter. Sherlock jumped backwards.
“I do.” Mycroft stared past Sherlock and down the hallway towards the double doors. “John once promised me that he would look after you. He hasn’t yet finished his required term, and I shall be
“Right,” he said. “Uh – buongiorno…” he made a wild gesture with his hand, unsure of what he was even trying to communicate. “Molto bueno…”
“Not at all.” Despite himself, the weary DI managed a smile. “Thank
“Yeah, yeah, Sherlock…” John’s voice rasped out, heavy against Sherlock’s neck, his hips rocking steadily, tension building along his spine under Sherlock’s touch. “Come for me, my love, my Sherlock, come for me now.”
“Probably,” Sarah shrugged.
“Yes,” John said. His voice was absolutely steady over that one.
“Yes, I was,” John returned. “You were just too good to notice.”
He followed Sherlock’s mouth as he shifted slightly above him, giving himself room to stroke John slowly from base to tip. A desperate little moan pushed its way out of John’s throat as Sherlock thumbed over the slit, still so slowly, and John felt his hips rise up instinctively into the touch, craving
“Sherlock!”
It took Sherlock great effort not to recoil at her words, ringing hollow as the barest echo in his ears. With a deep breath he pulled back enough to give her a curt nod – hardly able to look her in the eyes – then released her to let her move toward the Lestrades.
John blinked, then tried to smile in return.
“Okay,” he said. He sounded breathless. Sherlock felt exactly the same.
“Hello?”
“What do you do, Nancy?” John asked.
“Fantastic.” John’s voice was low, still cautious, but simmering with unrestrained fondness just below the surface. “Where do we start?”
“Sure,” John breathed out, still reeling. He crouched over his bag to find a fresh set of clothes while Sherlock slipped out through the door and back to his own room, and felt that pit of dread grow darker.
Sherlock hadn’t moved; he stared off in the direction of the entry doors, his back to their quiet conversation. Distantly he heard Molly filling in Mrs. Hudson of all that had happened – all that
Sherlock’s eyes softened even more.
“Well, boys love musicians, don’t they?” he asked.
“He’s done it,” Sherlock muttered. “It’s official.”
An unmistakeable hitch sounded in John’s breath, and then he was kissing him again, slowly and sweetly this time.
Here and there, people were still trickling in. From the corner where he stood near one of the food tables, John saw Sarah and her husband over on the opposite wall, chatting to a group of people from Marketing. In the middle of the room, the dance floor was looking pretty thin; John guessed the alcohol hadn’t been flowing for long enough yet.
“John, I’m back!” A voice at John’s elbow piped up suddenly. Sherlock released John’s hand with a start.
Sherlock stared back at him in disbelief.
“John, please…”
They both got out of the car and circled around it, standing in front.
“No, thank you,” Sherlock cut her off. He looked back at John. “Fine. We’ll manage.”
ing around through it, and farther off, between the stone buildings beyond the garden.
“Love is all ar- oh, fuck-wank-bugger-shitting-arse-head-and-hole.”
“I know, love.” John reached out and took Sherlock’s hand, stopping his anxious train of thought before it spiralled out of control. Sherlock let out a sigh of relief and squeezed back, gratefully, meeting John’s soft, reassuring eyes and feeling his mind slow down instantly at the sight.
He rolled over, following his first instinct to curl into John and warm himself with his comforting heat, but he blinked his eyes open, blearily, and paused. John looked to be sleeping soundly, breathing even and peaceful. Wearing a t-shirt, not feeling the chill. Sherlock would startle him awake with his cold hands if he moved closer. No, that wouldn't do.
John burst into a low chuckle, and the sound made Sherlock’s heart feel lighter than it had been all day.
Because they
“And –” Sherlock hurried on, desperate for something else, for him to stay just a little longer. “You live with your – wife?”
The song played on, brash and inappropriate. Maybe that’s what she’d wanted. John had never really understood why – but then, he’d never understood a lot of things. He moved off towards the casket, and took his position.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed. “What’s awful about Susan?”
,” Sherlock said animatedly. “It’ll write on anything, even glass. So, say, for example,” he turned towards the poster on his left. “You’ve got a framed picture, like this one of Blue Carbuncle, you can write directly on it! Look.”
He stumbled to a halt, only just avoiding crashing into John. He was out of breath.
Sherlock braced himself for the next line.
She laughed, properly and without shame. Mycroft looked uncomfortable and directed Sherlock to the last person in the line.
He pulled open the door to see John standing on the other side.
Sherlock said nothing.
“What were you doing when I called?” she asked.
Sherlock drew his finger halfway out, and John nearly cried out at the loss before a second one was teasing at his entrance alongside the first, and as it breached him even more slowly John let out a high-pitched moan and let his eyes slide shut, seeing stars flickering behind his lids.
But no sooner had he flung it open, he jumped back in surprise – Sherlock was there on the other side of it.
“Um, sure,” he said, stepping aside. He was still trying to figure out why John had knocked, when clearly he had let himself in through the front door.
newspaper that Sherlock had seen this morning with the advertisement for Blue Carbuncle’s album marked up in angry black ink with the same crude speech bubble.
John convulses once more, then steadies, pulling in deep, uneven breaths.
John scoffed. “Don’t tell Nancy.”
. He seemed to know absolutely everything about subjects that interested him, and he saw the world in ways John had never even considered. He was unique, and he was unfairly beautiful, and John grew more entranced with each day.
“Yeah.” John’s breath left him in a rush, his brow relaxing. “I mean, you know, we’d had a few, and –”
Sherlock finished the song, letting the final note ring out long and clear. John inhaled deeply, took in the sharp tang of rosin blended with the airy softness of Sherlock’s shampoo, let it wash over him like a gentle, soothing breeze.
“Just try to spread some reassuring feeling around, alright?” Sherlock said, moving toward the door of his office. “You can do that, can’t you?”
Sherlock blinked, eyes flicking up and down while his mind raced.
“Well, um,” John finally looked directly at Sherlock, his lips pursing briefly before evening out into something beautifully genuine. “Last night meant a lot to me.” His eyes were deeper than Sherlock had ever seen them. “And, I guess I’m just trying to say thank you.”
“No, you don’t.” There was a smile in John’s voice, but he still wasn’t looking at him.
“– but is this
But then, who knew what was right anymore? With her gone, and Mycroft off at Uni, and with just his Dad left, who Sherlock wasn’t sure had the answer, he just didn’t know how to think about anything.
, maybe none of this would be real. Maybe it wouldn’t have happened, and he would never have to look at John’s face when he turned around or hear whatever he might say – but he couldn’t move. He couldn’t be the one to break this cacophonous silence, to acknowledge what John had seen. What was now hanging in every staggering breath, every thunderous heartbeat.
It wasn’t so much a dance that they were doing, really, as just gyrating in place. It was all so unnecessary.
All your comments are appreciated :)
The hesitation in John’s voice was different from what it had just been. Sherlock looked back up at him to find his brow raised, almost shyly.
Sherlock paused for a second. He was listening hard. The woman at the counter was now apologizing as she emptied her pockets out onto the counter.
He waited, but Sherlock didn’t turn around for another retort. He just stared out the passing cars, not looking at him. John’s smile faltered a bit.
John turned his neck, so that he could feel Sherlock’s warm breath on his face.
But no, no – Sherlock couldn’t let him leave with even the slightest possibility that he might believe that, or deserve that. He had to say
Should he kiss him?
Sherlock thought quickly - his eyes darted around the studio, finally landing on a poster out in the foyer. “Sam Smith.”
The laughter doubled. Jonathan was looking dubiously amused.
He closed his eyes, trying to calm his racing mind.
Everything was still. Sherlock’s world narrowed to the stage under his feet and the violin resting under his chin.
“He’s right, John. Best not to rush things, you know. Play it safe.” Molly’s smile was sympathetic, but her voice was even. “You’re lucky you’ve got Sherlock here to look after you.”
There, on the table, his phone was vibrating in even pulses.
She sat down, and gestured for him to do the same.
That was it. Really, there had been no reason to believe that John had felt anything for him at all. He was just showing respect for his boss, for his Prime Minister.
Stacey hummed in agreement. John nodded, dazed, and tried to look interested.
They stood for a moment, unmoving. Sherlock was meeting his eyes, evenly. He didn’t seem keen to leave.
“It’s not worth it, you know,” John shouted back, shaking the water out of his ears. “It isn’t bloody Shakespeare.”
“Where is Sherlock?” came Mr. Holmes’ voice beside him.
Sherlock blinked at him, his brow furrowing as John came to stare at the Wall beside Sherlock.
” Sherlock whispered pathetically, his mind a whirl, unable to articulate anything further.
it was him?” Lestrade asked, looking bemused.
John hadn’t taken his eyes off Sherlock, and now they clouded over with concern – or possibly guilt. Sherlock
John smiled, his body slowly sinking further into heaviness. “Tomorrow’ll be your turn,” he muttered. His words were a bit sloppy, pressed into Sherlock’s skin. “I’ll make you feel that good, too.”
“I have come here,” John stumbled a bit over the words, but his voice was clear and certain. “With a view to asking you…to marriage me.”
John did, nodding as he reaffirmed his grip across his back and held on tight. Sherlock shifted and John cried out softly as his thrusts deepened even further, then his voice gave out into a harsh breath as he felt Sherlock’s fingers wrap around his cock once more, stroking in time with the movement of his hips
Sherlock’s mind was buzzing, whirling in all possible directions, but that look made one emotion fight its way to the forefront and overpower everything else – cold fury.
He sighed. “Well, I suppose I could…”
He felt Sherlock smile against his neck, and his brow smoothed out. He was soft and contented, his warmth blissful and beautiful. John let it drift over him like a gentle wave, and carry him off into sleep.
Where on earth was he?
Not quite managing to stop his hands from trembling, he lifted one and slid it, so, so slowly, into John’s where it rested against his side.
John paused. There something off in the way he said it – almost nervously.
Now though, she didn’t show any sign of repeating her earlier advances. She just stared straight ahead, looking through the dancing couples and landing on John and Mary in the middle of the floor.
“Oh, really?” Sherlock replied, sardonically.
Sherlock didn’t bother muffling his footsteps as he headed downstairs. He made his way towards the sliver of light shining out of the just-barely cracked door to the office. Sherlock knocked softly, and pushed it open.
His Dad gave a sudden burst of breathless laughter. “Aren’t you a bit young to be in love?”
and it was a whole big mess but he was part of it now and he hadn’t wanted to leave –
Sherlock thought to himself.
Beside him, Sherlock was breathing in quick, shallow gasps. “I don’t understand,” he was saying.
His face split into a grin, and he began to laugh lowly. Sherlock shoved him in the arm.
Suddenly, a flash of panic screamed to life inside him.
Sherlock huffed out another exasperated breath. “No, fine, we’ll be in tomorrow morning.”
“Brilliant,” he said, almost too softly for Sherlock to hear. Still, the praise he’d gone so long without made colour rise in Sherlock’s cheeks, and he had to tear his gaze away again.
“I know.” And John’s voice was a low, exhausted sigh. He finally looked up, and Sherlock almost started at how worn he looked, at how deep the creases of his brow were. His shoulders were sagging, and there was no trace of that sparkle in his eyes.
Sherlock blinked back a fresh wave of tears as they lowered the mask over him.
the other day,” Sherlock said in a knowing voice. “Nearly choked on it.”
“I mean –” John looked briefly up into Sherlock’s eyes, wide with something like pity. “What we did last night – well, it was…”
“Sherlock…” he was able to get out, weakly.
“Still alright?” Sherlock whispered, heavier than usual.
It was a few days before the landlady came by. John was surprised – last year she’d come right away to introduce herself, quite enthusiastically too. She was an Englishwoman, but she’d lived in France so long she had a unique pseudo-accent that lilted her voice with unusual tone patterns, and nothing seemed to give her greater pleasure than to have someone staying in her villa, at last.
John nodded, and Sherlock hurried towards the bedroom. His fingers were still shaking as he stabbed the eject button and took hold of the CD, but he was breathing easily again by the time he’d returned to the sitting room and fed it into the stereo on the shelf.
“Sorry?”
“Bonjour, John.” Sherlock gave him an uncertain smile as he shook his hand. The way his accent curled around John’s name made a shiver run up his spine.
“Best shag you ever had?” Mike asked, looking hopeful.
The next morning found John awake early, earlier even than Sherlock, and he rolled over carefully so as not to wake him. He winced only the tiniest bit as he settled himself onto his wounded side and scanned Sherlock’s face in the shadows; his brow smoothed of the day’s worries, his eyelids fluttering with the hint of a dream, his sleep-mussed curls tumbling softly over his temples.
“I love that word, 'relationship',” he said, evenly. “Covers all manner of sins, doesn’t it?”
“No, ‘m fine,” John mumbled, shifting against the pillow and letting his eyes fall closed against his will.
“Oh, God, it’s half the book,” John groaned, watching them being carried forward on the wind. Most of them had already landed in the water.
Lestrade opened his mouth and closed it again, looking stunned. Molly was silent, but Sherlock swore he saw her lip wobble.
John could only nod, lips brushing Sherlock’s feather-light, and he clutched him closer in a silent plea for movement.
His eyes glinted, brilliant. “Traditionally, no,” he said, leaning in slightly. “But in this case I think perhaps I might like to keep you up all night.”
Sherlock grinned, more slyly than usual, as he looked down at him. He was bouncing rather quickly now.
“Nothing,” he muttered.
He’d known for a long time that it never would be.
Sherlock lowered his arms to wrap around John’s body and pull him impossibly closer, needing more, still more. He curled his tongue against John’s, inviting him deeper, and let his own rumbling moan of pleasure escape from his throat.
he whispered, desperately. “Yes, yes,
20. “Kind…or…or…”
John shook his head – they hadn’t planned on an overnight trip. She nodded, and led them down a narrow hallway to a room with a green wooden door, told them what time breakfast would be served, and wished them goodnight, with hospitality far cheerier than what they were in the mood for.
John’s breath was coming in sharp bursts. He walked along with a confident stride, stepping over the cobblestones and through narrow side-streets, but his heart was hammering harder than it ever had before.
“Would have gotten to anyone.” Despite himself, Sherlock felt the ghost of laughter rising in his throat.
“Yes,” he said, breathless. “That’s – that’s great.”
He took a deep breath in, and expelled it, resigning himself. It was alright. He’d said what he’d needed to say, heard what he’d so desperately wanted to hear. They’d find some other, less magical night, to carry on from now.
Sherlock squeezed his hand, then tugged off his jacket and headed inside. John collapsed onto the bed, and pulled off his shoes.
The sitting room was bathed in silver half-light from the moon. A few stars twinkled out against the black night.
John’s face lit up with a wide, bright grin, and he gave Sherlock an exuberant double thumbs-up.
Sherlock felt his heart kick up in his chest. He should say something, just a greeting, or an apology for that joke earlier – had John heard it? – but all speech suddenly seemed to elude him.
He felt Sherlock smile fondly at his forehead, and a small rumble of laughter echoed from his chest into John’s.
“Actually,” Sherlock whispered, slowly. “I don’t
John’s brow furrowed, wondering if he had just heard that right and if
John drew him in for one intense moment, then broke off with a series of smaller, chaste kisses to his lower lip, hoping to urge him forward a little. Sherlock took the hint, and sat back a bit to snap open the bottle and slick his fingers liberally; his eyes never left John’s, something unfathomably tender in them that knocked the remaining breath from John’s lungs.
“Right, yes, that’s what I should be doing.” Sherlock’s speech was suddenly rapid, the words struggling to come out in the right order. Had Mycroft called her too? No, he wouldn’t have – only the people who could help Sherlock. “She’ll want to know, I should call her.” He fumbled in his pocket for his phone, then froze.
“…perfect.” Sherlock’s voice was as light as the whisper of his thumb stroking over his cheek. “You’re perfect.”
John stood there stunned, for a second or two, his eyes roving over Sherlock’s wrecked face.
In one fluid motion, the latch clicked and the window was wrenched open. Sherlock leapt out of his hiding place and onto Orlova just as John stood up and fired.
“Oh, no,” he said, as the void in his chest swallowed him up again. “Oh, please, Harry, don’t…”
And then, inch by inch, the corners of Sherlock’s lips turned up – and his face lit up with a wide, brilliant smile.
Sherlock looked up at him.
It seemed like ages before Sherlock finally reached the base of his spine, and then his hands grabbed two fistfuls of his bare arse. An involuntary groan barked out of John’s throat. Oh
He turned back to John, eyes dark and deadly. “Are you ready?”
"You talk too much," Sherlock said simply as he let me fall out of his mouth, a thin line of drool breaking off onto his chin. "Shut up and let me suck you off."
Sherlock's eyes twinkled as he leaned back in his chair. "I'll hold you to it, John."
John Watson: Don't. EVER say that...please. you know how I....
Sherlock ran his long hands down John's back before reaching between them. His nimble fingers fumbled with John's fly before he finally got his trousers open.
John quickly retreated, nosing at the detective's cock instead. "Soon, love. I want this as much as you do, trust me." He ground his pained cock against Sherlock's calf to prove his point.
Sherlock Holmes: Hello...
After a several second staring contest Sherlock stood and yanked off his dressing gown and pyjama bottoms, thankful he'd gone commando. "There," he huffed, crossing his arms over his bare chest.
John had to close his eyes and breathe deeply through his nose to refrain from doing just what Sherlock was describing. "Jesus... What else?"
Sherlock Holmes: It's part of my job. I be a 'rude smartass' and the world continues to be idiotic and tasteless.
Sherlock grinned. "Well, I said that you should make pancakes, and I heard no dissent. Therefore-" He waved his hand impatiently in the general direction of the stove.
John pressed his mouth desperately to Sherlock's, his hands curling around Sherlock's black hair as they both came down from their orgasms. He pulled up for air, gasping, and rested his forehead on Sherlock's.
“Oh,” John replied simply.
John froze. "What? Shit, sorry. I thought..."
Barista:*chuckles* I figured, I've seen you in the paper a few times, I'm Jenah, I'm a low life bartender *turns around and starts to pour a few shots* Why do you want to get drunk, darling'?
It took all of his resolve not to fuck into his own hand, he was so hard. The only thing that kept him from it was knowing how much better Sherlock would be, how much tighter and warmer-
"Have you ever sucked a cock before?"
Just as the door was closing behind him, John could swear he heard Holmes say, “Sorry about Dr. Who.”
There was some sort of snare drum or something involved, a deep, sensual rhythm. Not exactly a Sherlock-type song, John thought as he opened the door. There weren't enough violins.
Barista:*furrows eyebrows* If I had to say, I'd probably say a few shots
Sherlock Holmes: Magic?
John nodded, bowing his head in a desperate attempt to stay completely still. Christ, it was difficult...
John stopped once he was all the way into Sherlock. He rotated his hips slowly, bringing a high keening noise out of Sherlock. "I nearly took you then and there at that counter, Sherlock. You're so fucking sexy when you squirm. God, you're tight," John growled.
The exited the bathroom together, heading straight for the door and leaving their uneaten food at the counter. The cashier began to call them, but instead he shrugged and popped a fry into his mouth.
a troll: OH
Sherlock Holmes: You're a stranger to me. For all I know, you could be Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
Finally, John ran his fingertips lightly up the underside of Sherlock's shaft. His index finger caught a bead of pre-cum, spreading it over Sherlock's glans and head.
Hiro Hamada: Wait, case? What case? It...oh shoot. *Laughs nervously and starts backing up* uh, I, uh, you don't happen to know a Yama do you?
Slowly, very slowly, John put in his first and middle fingers. Sherlock grunted, throwing his head aside, but lifted his hips to grant easier access all the same.
"I went to uni," he shrugged. "Next time you want to kiss me, just do it."
"Yesterday."
Sherlock Holmes: What's your name, sexual orientation, and *hic* occupation? No, let me guess.
Sherlock Holmes: HAHAHAHAHA HE THINKS I DON'T *HIC* KNOW
John grabbed his coat and stormed out of the flat, not sure if he was more embarrassed or angry. The arrogant cock was just pushing John's buttons and he'd had enough.
(See the end of the chapter for
John looked up in astonishment. “Oh… er… I saw someone in the hall on the way over and it just rattled me a bit.” He decided to leave out the part stating that he had just remembered why he was here and was feeling slightly nauseated.
"Well, what do you think about when you're getting off?" John asked exasperatedly. This was much more of a production than he'd expected.
Sherlock Holmes: but that's none of my business...
Sam and Dean: Sam: no but I guess that's you?
Sherlock Holmes: We disagree about many things. I'm usually right.
"Close," Sherlock gasped, twisting in his bonds.
Sherlock Holmes: My fingers and eyes are the only things engaged in this. My brain is hardly registering the words you're typing.
"Fuckkkk." The single word, a breathless groan, in Sherlock's deep baritone voice. John felt a jolt go up his entire body and his cock twitched uncomfortably.
"You mean you need to talk to them and I need to be quiet and go with it," John corrected.
"I very much enjoyed it. More than I would have liked. But I'm willing to try again," John admitted. "Well then, are you ready? If we sit around talking much longer I might pull out my hair."
They laid like that for several minutes, panting. Then, just as Sherlock's hands began lazily exploring John's lower back, the doctor broke the silence.
Barista: Well, I think it's something that should be praised
He reached over to his nightstand and took out a small bottle of lube, squirting a generous amount onto his fingers.
"I could do it. The bondage and stuff. One of my girlfriends was really into that and I got quite good at it," John stated. "We could try it... When you're more comfortable with the whole thing, that is. We'll go nice and slow the first few times."
Barista: Did- Did you just quote Romeo and Juliet? *chuckles*
"Such a good little pet... begging for my cock... taking it like a slut," John groaned, continuing to fuck Sherlock's arsehole.
John Watson: Hey there, Sherlock
John smiled as he turned the knob on the tap next to Sherlock's. "No, love. In fact, if I wasn't already in the middle of cumming, that would've tipped me over the edge."
Sherlock placed his hand on John’s abdomen and rubbed gently and slowly, easing some of the discomfort. “Only another five or ten minutes, then I’ll be done injecting the serum.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock Holmes: Was the pop white-ish and excreted from your erect penis?
Which made sense, seeing as he had procured a microphone (a rather expensive looking one, John thought) and a large speaker.
Professor Holmes smiled. “I wanted to be a pirate when I was a boy, and yet…” He gestured down at himself with a small laugh. “Things change. Interests change. People change, Mr. Watson.”
John smiled, pulling back again. "And that was your second. I don't want to take it too fast with you. Besides, I already have enough to regret when I wake up."
John mouthed gently across Sherlock's neck, pausing to nip gently at his collarbone. "Let's go to your bedroom."
He looked up at me, disgruntled. "I hab a cold, Johb. No."
Sherlock had his eyes closed, focusing on the music. The microphone was held loosely, comfortably, at his side as he swayed.
John froze, stomach sinking. Oh shit. He knew he hadn’t done well on his exam- all the rubbish about DNA analysis and blood spatter- but from what he had heard, hardly anyone had. The dozen or so students left in the hall brushed past John as he turned back to the professor, the door clanging closed behind him verbalizing the sense of being trapped.
Sherlock Holmes: Merely that you're stubborn and unintelligent.
Sherlock Holmes: I know almost everyone.
Sherlock Holmes: For what reason?
He didn't mind that his writing was criticized but the derogatory language was upsetting, let alone completely untrue. He obviously liked girls, how many times did he have to say it? Yeah, maybe Sherlock tossing off earlier had him a bit hot, but he didn't have any feelings for his flat mate... he just needed to get laid.
Without permission (wasn't that rich), John yanked down his denims and pants, taking the few remaining steps to Sherlock and dropping to his knees.
Sherlock's walk was almost undetectably off. His legs were several centimeters wider apart than usual, and his knees didn't bend quite as much.
John stood on his wobbly legs, hands reaching out and taking Sherlock's shoulders. The way Sherlock looked up at John from between his legs was almost enough to get John ready for round two.
Sherlock Holmes: If you like people with dead eyes...
John marched into the nearest cafe and stood at the counter. Sherlock was close behind, and now that he was out of earshot his breathing was ragged and uneven.
I'm a bloody pervert, John thought with surprisingly little disgust, for not leaving as soon as I realized what was happening.
When I nudged open his door and set the glass down, I was amused and slightly endeared to find that Sherlock had fallen asleep again already.
Sherlock Holmes: Oh. How dull.
Sherlock chuckled breathlessly. "I've said it in all ways but actual speech."
Sherlock Holmes: Oh, yes. Sorry. I do forget how touchy you are when it comes to my supposed death.
Sherlock perched himself on the edge of his bed, flipping the end of his belt out of his trouser loop. "Of course that's the logical assumption. I just got out of the hospital after suffering a self-induced- and may I add again ACCIDENTAL- drug overdose and you're unwilling to let me leave your sight. So, when I request in a moment that you leave my room for nineteen minutes and forty-two seconds, I am reaffirming the fact that I am not going to 'finish the job' and off myself, rather, perform my bi-weekly check and tune up."
John groaned, slowly standing and making his way to the door. The hammers inside his head were insistent this morning. He hobbled down the stairs and into the bathroom, running a toothbrush over his teeth before starting the shower.
"I was gone for over an hour," I smirked. "I've been too busy to go out and get groceries lately, so I took the opportunity. I knew you wouldn't miss me."
Sherlock Holmes: *sighs* Emotions. Who knew they could get so... emotional.
John was pulled out of his quick reverie when Sherlock, ever the fast learner, swallowed John's cock. "Fuck!" John cried, giving half a thrust before remembering himself and stopping. "Oh, shit," he groaned, very close. "Stop, stop."
Barista:*laughs* Well, he is referring to when you give him a blowjob that well, you are what you eat
“Yes. All women?”
"I'm not leaving," I reaffirmed. I widened my stance, eyes shifting finally to Sherlock's face, suddenly and intensely glad I had worn my slightly baggier jeans today.
Sherlock Holmes: That I'm not sorry.
Sherlock Holmes: *hiccups again* Well, thanks for the advice and the liqueur, Jenah. *reaches in pocket and pulls out twenty pounds* Will this cover it?
