,” Sherlock tossed the word out in frustration. “I can’t think clearly with it in my head." He motioned to the book and teacup floating past between their boots. "Look at this!”
“But please don’t make me do that. I’m not as patient as you are, you know that. I need you to wake up, and I think you will, because since the day we met you’ve been there when I needed you and you’ve done what I’ve asked. You’ve been my flatmate, my blogger, my doctor… the only friend I’ve ever—the only person…”
Sherlock ignored him. “My hypothesis was that you’d be better off without me—I mean obviously you’d be devastated at first, but, you know, better off in the long run, and I had to know—”
With some amazement Sherlock realised John was kissing him like he looked at him: protectively, admiringly, devotedly, and defiantly at the same time. Those looks gripped his heart. This kiss threatened to burn him from the inside out.
“Here.” Sherlock handed him a mask. It was a skeleton face with fabric that would cover his whole head. “Put this on.”
“Now that’s not fair, Sherlock, how did you know I was going to ask you for a favour?” Mrs. Hudson looked put out.
He couldn’t hear. He couldn’t see. His eyes had fallen shut and were not interested in opening again. John was pushing back against him, walking him backward, and Sherlock let him, trusting in a way he could never trust anyone else.
"So tell us, Hannah, do you have us up at six on trumped up claims as an excuse to meet your favourite blogger and take a 'selfie' in our flat, or is it possible you've actually brought us something interesting?"
John gave Sherlock what he hoped was his best obnoxious grin and Sherlock in turn told him to shut up.
Sherlock shifted his hands on John’s back, pulling him closer, though John hadn’t thought it was possible:
Reaching back further, John remembered the fog; he was surprised to find he remembered the coma dream with vivid clarity. It wasn’t like other dreams where the details slipped away with consciousness, leaving only remnants of vague impressions. He remembered everything as though it were a memory and not a dream. The voices—Sherlock’s voice: “You are everything to me.”
Now he realised he might have been wrong, because Sherlock reached out his hand for the phone and said, “Please.” The effect of the word was to deprive John of any choice in the matter. Sherlock pocketed the phone and remained immersed in studying whatever was under the microscope that day.
“Blacklisted, you understand?” the guard said roughly. “Come here again and you won’t be walking when you leave.”
He was like BBC News if BBC News were a bad-tempered flatmate who stole your chips off your plate and occasionally burned the curtains.
“And how do you suppose I’m going to distract a prostitute? Hm? I don’t suppose they have Scrabble there, do you?”
hadn’t escaped him. But Sherlock had promised himself after John’s wedding that he wasn’t going to bother him with these sorts of ex-flatmate problems (e.g. where are the towels? Is it possible to fold a fitted sheet? Are there significant consequences for not doing so correctly? How does the heat work? etc.). He wasn’t going to interrupt John’s new married life with such trivial problems that he himself found too boring to properly consider. So asking John was out of the question.
“Thanks, dickface,” John grinned, flipping him his middle finger as they made their way back toward centre field.
“Don’t be absurd, John. Life is not a game”—Mycroft stood and re-buttoned his suit jacket—“And anyway, I intend to win.” Mycroft arched an eyebrow as he gave him a half-smile and John wondered if what he’d just witnessed was as close to a real smile as Mycroft Holmes ever came.
“Mycroft, please,” Sherlock said, tears rolling down his cheeks. There was no continuation of the sentence, no complete request. There couldn’t be. There was nothing Sherlock could ask of him that would make any logical sense. But Sherlock was nine years old; he was on the floor next to Redbeard, looking up at him and asking him anyway.
She started to speak but hesitated, pulling at the cuff of her sleeve. “Do you think,” she said slowly, “that John divorced Mary because he’s in love with you?”
John shook his head, thinking of the cameras and the security guards and the money paid. “That's not how I want to be kissed.”
He gripped John’s hips, feeling the narrow firmness of them at the band of his jeans. He ran his hands up under his jumper as he kissed him, fingers feeling the sturdy form underneath—a map of flesh and bone Sherlock had memorised long ago—the strength in his elastic muscles. The water was threatening to rise above mid-calf and Sherlock held the sides of John’s face. He paused for a moment, just taking it in. John’s face: so familiar and so pleasing, smooth planes of honey skin, several shades darker than Sherlock's, the mouth that smiled or tightened in accordance with his moods, lips that shouted reprimands at him or pressed firmly against his own. There was nothing he wanted more than John Watson.
Lestrade sighed, “Because, Sherlock, you are so nearly mad I’m afraid one day you’re going to go round the bend and I won’t notice.”
He wasn’t aware of the extent to which John would be affected… Was it true then? Did Sherlock really not know? Was it possible he really didn’t realise…
"Don't worry, dear, you just need a little more practice," she said when the dance finished and John apologised again.
Despite appearances he truly did care about Sherlock, only six years old and already the only person clever enough for Mycroft to speak to without having to feign interest. He would help him by counterbalancing his parents’ spoiling and endlessly forgiving manner by preparing Sherlock for the real world. He invented stories about The East Wind to tell him at night.
“Scotch, neat,” John said. He knew it would probably be better to order something he hadn’t been consuming excessively the night before, but his hangover had been his fault, not the whisky’s. Scotch was by far his favourite drink and he wasn’t about to let one bad morning ruin their relationship.
They rolled over and over again, slamming each other into the ground, until finally Sherlock got John in a chokehold.
“Well, this should be interesting.” John took a drink. “You sure you want me to come? It seems a bit awkward—”
Lestrade put his hands on his hips. “You can either tell me here, now, why you were harassing Tony and Kathleen Bauer tonight, or we can go to Scotland Yard and you can tell another officer who won’t have my talent for being patient with you.”
Still he wasn’t thrilled about it. John let his gaze travel over the living room, thinking that he didn’t understand the concept of heaven. How could you be happy anywhere if your consulting detective isn’t there with you? To play the violin or burn holes through your tables; to play Cluedo with you or to wake you up in the middle of the night with questions about cirrhosis; to help you on with your coat or follow you around the flat complaining about everything; to push you out into the night after murderers, running at your side?
He’d walked a few blocks already; there was a main road up ahead. A black car screeched to a halt and someone leaped out. John stopped, watching the person running. Was he running toward
Because he was there, standing in the doorway with a duffel bag across his shoulder and a suitcase at his side, and that’s what he did say.
“Sherlock?” The detective rolled onto his back. “I’ll be in the living room tonight if you need me.”
He straightened his posture, as if the lift of his shoulders could force any lingering emotion to fall away.
— But John was here, saying it now, the intensity of his stare boring into Sherlock’s eyes. And he knew it was true the same way he knew John. He wanted to smile. Because he felt the same. Exactly the same. They were two soldiers with an intolerance for peacetime; they were meaningless, purposeless, without the war.
John handed the phone back to her. He wanted to tell her she was right, that she'd done well, but he knew without question to follow Sherlock's lead. The detective sat silently gazing at her over the tips of his fingers.
Mycroft glared at him. “As I was saying, when Mary came to pick him up she was absolutely furious with you, and John was none too pleased either. Nine days being poisoned by a bullet he took for you, and you didn’t notice? I can’t say I blame him.”
"What happened?" John asked when his giggling subsided. "I started out the night as an undercover agent watching topless strippers. Now I'm wearing lip gloss and playing Candyland."
Mycroft remembered watching Sherlock through the sliding glass doors as he played in the garden one day. Sherlock was running and looking behind him he noticed Redbeard struggling to keep up. Sherlock stopped abruptly. The look on his face suggested he almost, but probably not entirely, grasped the importance of the moment.
“Might have to remember that one for my blog,” John said mirthfully. “'Scotland Yard baffled, calls in Mr. Sulky.’”
The cold crept up and tightened across Sherlock’s chest. Of course that’s what it must have seemed like to John. He and Mycroft had structured it that way, hadn’t they? The plan had been for Sherlock to jump off the roof and the world (and John) would believe he did it because he felt worthless—his detective skills faked, the world against him, no reason to live. Newspaper headlines:
“John!” Mrs. Hudson breathed. “That temper of yours! You really ought to see someone about it. My friend Rose goes in for anger management groups; I could ask her for the information if you want. She’s been going every week since she ran her husband down with the car. He’s all right now, thank god, but—”
He moved past Sherlock, but he stopped and turned back just as he reached the hallway. “You invented an antidote for a poison that had none. You saved my life.”
Mycroft, he was told as he stepped out of the limo in front of the Diogenes Club, was waiting for him in a private room. John quietly made his way there. Once he’d safely closed the door behind him he turned toward Mycroft Holmes, who was sitting in an armchair reading a newspaper, one leg crossed over the other. Hair: immaculately combed. Suit: expensive.
He looked at his friend now, in his dressing gown and bare feet, not nearly as tall or intimidating as he seemed when prowling the streets of London in that coat. But still, he was Sherlock Holmes. A unique kind of potential energy radiated around him. John would feel it if he were blindfolded. And even slouched against the kitchen doorframe in his pyjamas, no one could mistake those sinewy muscles, that aristocratic delicacy of bone structure and air of entitled superiority, those bright eyes flecked with such an unlikely array of colours, reflecting a mind as dazzling as the universe.
John heard his own words rough by comparison. “Not a doctor right now, Sherlock. Soldier. I’m not letting you go until you agree to eat something.”
Right. Sherlock was going to stay in and eat pasta tonight the same way he’d gone to the shop for milk all of those years ago. John couldn’t believe he’d fallen for it again.
The question died on his lips as the detective’s burning eyes raked over him. John barely had time to breathe before Sherlock kissed him. Hard.
Sherlock’s eyes flew open. Daylight was flooding through the windows of Mycroft’s flat. What time was it? He checked his phone: Two p.m. What day was it? Saturday. John would be at rugby practise.
“Shame about being blacklisted,” John said, doing up the last of the buttons. “They had a good Scotch.”
He was going to have to summon a lot of self-discipline if he was going to remember to be mad at the infernal detective tomorrow.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched at the memory. John wasn’t afraid of Moriarty. So what was it?
Interesting. Besides the few weeks following the pool there had been no nightmares when John lived at Baker Street. Why had he lied?
Their parents, who frankly were too old for a challenge like Sherlock, burned through the local agency’s list of nannies in record time, nearly despairing of finding any help at all when finally one arrived who was surprisingly resistant to Sherlock’s antics, and who Sherlock seemed to tolerate in return. Their parents had given up on disciplining him themselves, preferring to comply with his every whim rather than endure a tantrum when he was younger or try to win an argument with him when he was older. Mycroft was the only one who could win an argument with Sherlock, and Sherlock resented him doubly for it.
“It was necessary to… remove him from your room. He was very much in the way of the medical proceedings.”
There was John, about five years old, on the beach in Brighton smiling shyly at the camera, parents kneeling on either side of him. John, about ten years old sitting in the grass in a rugby kit, looking up at the camera, the picture taken before he was told to smile. John, about fifteen in a white t-shirt on the front steps of his old house, leaning against the railing, glaring at the camera, etc.
Each time Sherlock was jolted awake at the sight, sweat prickling his temples, his unmistakable sexual arousal seeming wildly inappropriate in the face of what he’d interpreted as a threat to John. The first time, he pinned an explanation about mistranslated concern for his flatmate’s safety on the dream before shoving it in the closet and promptly forgetting it. He repeated the action each time the dream recurred. But here it was now, resurfaced and swept out at him: John on his knees, pink tongue against thick metal.
Information acquired John retreated to the living room. Sherlock would probably sleep for a while. When Sherlock did sleep, and on the rare occasions he slept in his bed (as opposed to kipping on the couch), he slept late. Sherlock was simultaneously the fastest, most energetic man he’d ever met and the laziest: His endlessly enigmatic flatmate.
In the past John’s presence had been enough to stave off any lingering temptation the idea of synthetic supplements might offer. He didn’t need chemicals when he had his blogger, through the cases and in between. But things were different since he’d come back to London from his previous mission. John didn’t live here anymore. And now—now there wasn’t any question about what was necessary. Because he knew what it meant to say goodbye to John. He’d done it once before. And he wouldn’t—he couldn’t do it again. At least not sober.
Sherlock either ignored him or didn’t hear him. Probably both. Sherlock had perfected ignoring people to the point that he was actually able to block them from his sensory awareness. Lestrade retaliated by glaring at the top of his head. He immensely disliked that Sherlock never seemed to remember they were
John kept his feet moving in the right steps. Eventually he broke the eye contact by dropping his eyes lower—not to their feet, he was being good about that—but just to the level of Sherlock's mouth. And then to his neck.
Redbeard had originally been a birthday gift for Mycroft the year before Sherlock was born. His name was Charlie then. But Mycroft, six years old at the time, hadn’t been interested. The puppy was messy and chaotic and dumb and he didn’t really understand how to play with it, or why doing so would be desirable. The puppy, probably sensing his disinterest, had never taken to him either. But Charlie fell in love with Sherlock right away, sniffing and licking the baby, and wagging his tail when Sherlock laughed. Mycroft remembered the dog used to sit by, watching like a concerned nanny while Sherlock crawled around the living room. In Mycroft’s memory he had always been Sherlock’s dog.
"Oh, I've got it," she said brightly, digging into her purse again and pulling out an envelope. "All three bodies." She read his blog; of course she'd come prepared. The dubious legality of such a transaction was something John ignored with practised ease. To operate strictly within legal limits would defeat the purpose of a consulting detective altogether.
“Nothing,” he managed eventually. “I just don’t think we’ll be getting a Christmas card from the Bauers this year.”
Sherlock had redesigned his entire mind palace to be able to do this, and that meant more than any affirmation he could ask for.
“Are you all right?” Sherlock demanded, palpable urgency in his voice. He scanned the room quickly. No sign of intrusion. Where was the bloody light switch? He fumbled for it against the wall, but stopped when John moved, sitting up fully into the light slanting through his bedroom window, running his hands through his hair.
“Ok,” he said slowly. Patience. Always patience with Sherlock. “Is there a reason you’re awake at six o’clock in the morning and attacking my things? Or does this one get chalked up to ‘general insanity’ too?”
“To incorporate the emotion I have for you.” Sherlock blinked, steady. “Now that it’s integrated into the structure of the palace it’s no longer a threat to its integrity.”
John pushed his hands through Sherlock’s hair on either side, pulling those soft curls back from his face. He stopped, just for a moment, and opened his eyes. Sherlock’s eyes were still closed and he nudged his face forward at the sudden absence of John’s lips. When he didn’t find them, his lashes fluttered slowly open and John was struck speechless by the open warmth and transparent need in his eyes.
He meant today, at Scotland Yard, he had missed him. He meant the past few days John had been sleeping. He meant the coma. He meant the past year John had been living with Mary. He meant the two years he’d been away from London. He meant every weekend, every conference, every Christmas, every night since they met that Sherlock had opened the door to 221B and John wasn’t there.
But often the appeal of evenings at 221B was just sharing the space. Out of all the hair-raising, life-threatening, bizarre and incredible events they had been though, interestingly the clearest memories—in his years away from Baker Street, the memories that came back to him with the strongest sensory power—were an array of seemingly banal moments from the 221B living room: Watching Sherlock’s intense concentration on a microscope from over the top of a medical journal; Sherlock leaning over his shoulder to look at something he’d found on his laptop; Sherlock proudly announcing a pleasing experiment result or flinging a disappointing one out the window; Sherlock berating the telly; Sherlock laughing out loud at his comments about certain members of the media or Scotland Yard; finding new places to hide Sherlock’s cigarettes; Sherlock’s stunned expression when, after whinging on for an hour, John threw a packet of biscuits at his head.
Her next sentences were a rush of words. "It's probably nothing. You're right, I just thought it was—I don't know—I've probably spent too much time on the blog and I thought—I'm so sorry for waking you up and then wasting your time, I'm sure it'll be best if I just leave—"
In the end he did neither. He looked like he was about to say something, but he didn’t. Without a word he had turned on his heel and run out the door, forgetting his coat and scarf on the hook. Further evidence: Sherlock must be off his rocker if he could forget the beloved coat and scarf on a cold night. John had watched him jump into a cab from the window, briefly wondering whether he should call Lestrade to warn him that the mad detective had really gone mental this time and was loose in London with kitchen knives.
The sun was setting by the time he’d found enough cheques to assume there might be only one or two still missing. Considering he’d turned the place upside down looking, he was satisfied with his results. He’d found multiple cheques being used as bookmarks, some among the piles of newspapers, two between the couch cushions, one under the rug, one in the spice cabinet, and one stuck beneath a bag of fingers in the crisper in the fridge. The amount written on the cheque from the spice cabinet made John’s eyebrows shoot up under his hair. Sherlock must have put it in the cabinet for safekeeping. With the parsley and thyme. John shook his head. Sherlock was absolutely hopeless.
It wasn’t out of pity, Sherlock knew that much. John had started to look at him that way—a doctor’s concerned eyes on his neck—but Sherlock had stopped it in its tracks. He’d flattened his palm over John’s shoulder, reminding him of his own wounds. Sherlock was not one to be pitied and John knew that. He had understood when Sherlock touched his shoulder, touched the cut on his cheek. They were both damaged. John understood. And that’s when he’d kissed him.
“We’re looking into a few details,” John said. “We need to be certain we have the record straight for her file.”
When she continued her voice was more even. “It’s hard enough to find happiness in this hellscape,” she said, glaring out the window facing the main street behind him. “Don’t make yourself an obstacle in the way of yours. Life is too short.”
She set the knife down and picked up, John was surprised to see, a tube of lip gloss. She applied it slowly, set it down, and walked back.
“You!” she heard Mary shout from the other side of the door. She threw it open in time to see Mary jumping up to block Sherlock’s path. “Stay away from him! This is your fault!”
All of these instances had been manageable individually. He had locked each one away in what had been an airtight stronghold, but now… There was a rushing noise in his head; his mind palace was flooding; he couldn’t think... John’s clear eyes were watching him inquisitively, waiting.
A few strokes at the keyboard revealed the website he was looking for. Sherlock spun his laptop around so John could see the page for Monroe’s Gentlemen’s Club. “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Riley and Bauer were at a strip club the Friday night before he died, do you?”
John’s gaze was locked on a kitchen window he wasn’t seeing. That’s right, much more convenient for Mary to shoot Sherlock than to tell John the truth.
; the weight of John’s body, pinning him to the ground on the cliffs; John standing in the living room wearing the tuxedo;
“She left a few years after he started school. I’m sure our parents would have kept her on longer”—Mycroft scoffed—“I’m sure they would have kept her on through his university years. But she had made arrangements to return to the Czech Republic. He cried when she left. He spoke nothing but Czech for a week in protest, believing our parents were responsible for sending her away. I was the only one who could talk to him then. I hadn’t spent much time with the nanny, but as a precaution I learned the language as soon as Sherlock started to speak it.”
Could that mean—did it mean—It must, mustn’t it? Sherlock had lay down in his bed, held him. Even for someone as enigmatic as a consulting detective, a gesture like that couldn’t be ambiguous.
His eyes were heavy but he was prying them up. Blurring, blurry, sharpening image: Sherlock. Not a child. His eyes were shut but his arm was around him and John’s hand was tangled in the back of his hair, like it had been a moment ago in the garden. The warmth he’d felt had been real. Sherlock was here, lying in his hospital bed, holding him, radiating body heat.
He lay back on top of the bookcase, holding the wet book to his chest. He could wake up now, but he didn’t want to.
It was a long time since he’d had any cocaine, but he remembered the frankly dazzling speed at which his brain could work when stimulated with the drug. If nicotine was good for brainwork then cocaine was truly excellent. Short-term brainwork, of course. Sherlock also remembered the rather unpleasant crashes coming down from the high, but that was no matter now. He was not going to rest until he found an antidote. It could take days and he would need the drug to keep him going. But no, he didn’t have days. John could be dead tomorrow—Sherlock’s eyes slammed shut as the thought seared his brain.
The club was an enormous space, darkly lit and alternatingly illuminated by neon lights. A sleek, modern bar stretched almost the length of the place. Dotting the area were circular platforms featuring silver poles. They served as miniature stages for the strippers, who, topless, were performing their routines to their respective audiences: a ring of chairs around each stage filled with hollering, note-waving revellers.
Lethargically, with none of his usual exactness of movement, Sherlock produced his phone from his pocket. He typed and John’s phone chimed.
Lestrade almost choked in disbelief. Here was the same man who strode arrogantly around crime scenes, intimidatingly imperious; it was easy to forget he was only twenty-five years old when he was commanding police officers or berating a forensics team. Now, crumpled on the floor, he looked even five years younger—black hair hanging in his eyes, his body curled into itself—he was skinnier than Lestrade had ever seen him. For a man who stood six feet tall it was heartbreakingly easy to lift him in his arms. The paramedics were going to be too slow. He’d meet them down on the street.
John closed his eyes, relaxation spreading through his own body as he held Sherlock like he was everything in the world worth holding on to.
“It begins in an hour and a half,” Sherlock said. “You have plenty of time.” He plucked at the violin strings absently as if deciding what to play next.
“You know why we’re here.” Sherlock’s voice drifted lazily from beside John. “You wouldn’t have let us through the doorway if you weren’t going to tell us what we need to know. So let’s be quick.”
“Anytime you’re finished,” Sherlock said in a clipped tone, “you may remove yourself from my Nilsen shelf.”
John stopped abruptly as Sherlock flipped the other knife from his pocket and cut his own, left, hand and filled a second vial.
“The thought had occurred,” Sherlock said. “Anything out of the ordinary could signal his next move.”
Moriarty’s ideal employee. Moran had evidently proven himself worthy of controlling England’s drug trade in the master’s absence.
“And I’m doing the best I can!” Lestrade snapped. He took a breath and continued more calmly. “I do trust you to get the job done, you know I do. But if you’re going to be pulling guns on people and getting emergency services called on you, then I’m going to have to keep showing up here.”
true.” Sherlock’s low voice was barely a step from a growl. “I did want you to come with me. The other thing wasn’t true.”
“Ah, good to hear you’ve got your voice back.” John gave him a small smile. Nervous. Probably thinking about last night. A sensory memory of John’s lips on his flashed in Sherlock’s mind and he turned away, focusing instead on their impossible landlady.
In holding up the victim’s arm Sherlock’s coat sleeve had slipped down and Lestrade was surprised to see some angry bruising around the detective’s own wrist. Sherlock noticed his sightline and glanced involuntarily at John before tugging his sleeve back up. Odd. Maybe John wasn’t as patient with Sherlock as Lestrade thought.
John was already undoing the buttons on his. The wet material had suddenly become sticky and heavy and uncomfortable against his skin. “As a doctor I can’t allow you to sit there in a soaking wet shirt all night.”
John bristled, silently daring Sherlock to tell him he should be at home resting. He could let Sherlock know just how fun it had been to be at home resting the past few days in an empty flat with no goddamn sign of the person who was supposed to live there with him: the person who had kissed him and then apparently changed his mind and didn’t feel it necessary to give any kind of explanation.
He pulled back on Sherlock’s hair and Sherlock groaned just slightly against his lips. The sound sent a wave of pleasure through him that pooled in his lower abdomen. He drew back just enough to breathe—to steady himself—he needed control if he didn't want to wind up shoving Sherlock backward onto the table. John kissed his lips, kissed the corner of his mouth, the edge of his jaw, the hot pulse point on his neck, the beautiful, porcelain skin of his cheek, tenderly, making the message clear with every kiss:
It was a painfully long cab ride back to Baker Street but Sherlock felt he bore it heroically, considering the circumstances. The cabbie, however, did not seem to agree, practically tossing him out at the kerb.
There were ten other men in the chairs around the platform. Some were cheering and clapping and talking animatedly amongst each other. A few sat sipping drinks, an unpleasantly predatory look on their faces as they watched the woman gyrating in front of them.
“No. He’s a successful lawyer in his mid-thirties with no history of anxiety or depression. I searched his flat this afternoon. There’s nothing there to suggest hidden angst.” Sherlock scoffed the last two words.
Sitting. Sitting and drinking from the sound of it. They could be here a while, and John was not keen on staring at the weird skeleton skull hovering just inches from his face. He started to pull off his own mask and when Sherlock didn’t stop him he assumed it was ok. Then he took hold of the fabric at Sherlock’s neck and pulled it up, gently pushing it back off of the detective’s face.
“Sherlock,” John said, never more certain about anything in his entire life, “I will never leave you. Not if I have a choice.”
This was right, exactly right, and his body only confirmed it as his nerves sang with every touch that burned in the best way. It made sense. They fit together. They balanced each other. They could push each other as easily as they could restrain each other. They could get through to each other when no one else could. They needed each other. John could see it now in Sherlock’s eyes as he ran his hands over his flatmate’s bare chest: the hazy, needy, heart-wrenchingly clear want that had him more aroused than he’d ever been. He was going to give Sherlock everything he wanted and more. Always, he hoped. He hoped he would always be able to give Sherlock everything. Because he fully intended to spend the rest of his life trying.
Curious, John walked to the gate. He looked out to where the path disappeared into the fog. He felt a pull from within him. Sherlock was right. He was supposed to go this way.
"That's, er—"Sherlock pushed his hand back through his hair—"that's good. Erm, for future reference you don't have to look directly into your partner's eyes. You can, erm, look out at the dancefloor... Technically you should look left, over your partner's shoulder, to, erm, avoid collisions…"
John slid his phone back into his pocket and returned his attention to Sherlock. He marvelled at the dexterity with which his fingers flew across the strings, never hesitating, never faltering, even when at times the notes came in flurries at seemingly impossible speeds. Sherlock had the hands of an artist—pale, slender fingers with a delicacy that was entirely missing from John’s own hands, which were thick and rough and sturdy. John supposed it wasn’t surprising that Sherlock controlled the violin with the same agility he used to pick locks or handle fragile vials of dangerous chemicals.
Sherlock had let go of John’s arms and John surged upwards, catching the detective off guard and flipping him over onto his back, straddling his waist, reversing their positions.
“I believe Mary said she’d take him back to her place. She is a nurse, among other things. She’ll see to his recovery.”
An echo. Sherlock felt pain in his jaw and realised he’d been clenching his teeth, apparently hard enough to be clenching them in the real world, outside of his mind palace.
He leaned back in his chair and rubbed his hand over his brow. It was almost one o’clock in the morning and he still had a lot of work to do, but Sherlock’s call gave him pause.
How could he not have known? How could he have been so blind not to see what even strangers seemed to pick up in a glance? He’d been stupid, so stupid—
It was well after midnight and Sherlock was pacing the living room again. One problem solved another arises. Of course he was glad John was back; he hadn’t wanted him to leave in the first place. But it was more complicated now. When Sherlock had left London, and John had found Mary, he had reasoned that Mary was what John needed. She was John’s chance for at least half a normal life. True, she’d turned out to be a former assassin, but
Initially he was surprised that it was John Watson whom his brother deemed worthy of his affection when for twenty-seven years no one else had been. But after just a moment’s consideration he realised it wasn’t all that surprising. A soldier encompasses an interesting combination of obedience and willpower—an ideal personality for his brother, who would require a certain amount of submission to accept his domineering personality, but also a significant amount of backbone to win his respect. Factor in John’s addiction to danger, his bravery (or the right kind of stupidity), the speed at which he’d become fiercely protective of Sherlock (Mycroft had tested him), his cynical sense of humour, his patience and his loyalty, and he was in many ways the perfect companion for Sherlock. Even his shorter height and lower intelligence were necessary, due to Sherlock’s disdain for anyone taller than himself and his proven tendency to clash, sometimes violently, with people of equal or higher intelligence.
Sherlock looked up at the doctor and Lestrade caught a smile on the detective’s face before he turned his head back toward the body.
John heard his teammates shouting as he neared the goal. An opponent was at his heels but there wouldn’t be enough time to catch him. John dove over the line, landing hard on his stomach with the ball firmly on the ground. A successful try.
John’s head was spinning; the situation was surreal. His brain was automatically sending him signals to interpret the angle—Sherlock beneath him on the bed, Sherlock’s hand on his face—in the only way it knew how. He wasn’t quick enough now, here, at three o’clock in the morning in Sherlock’s bed, to come up with an alternate story, a rationalisation. Beginnings of ‘doctor/patient’ or ‘concerned flatmate’ related nonsense fell apart even as they formed.
John took out his wallet and handed him a fiver. Five pounds was nothing. He would have paid considerably more to watch Sherlock do this.
“How well did you know your brother’s mate, Brandon?” John cut in. Sherlock looked over suspiciously. That had been his next question.
“Interesting business technique,” John muttered. If the drug enhanced sensory awareness, the clients would leave feeling like they’ve never had better sex. But the dose would be small enough that combined with the effects of natural sexual stimulation and alcohol the clients might not realise they had been exposed to a drug. Sober sex comparatively feels dull, and they keep coming back.
“My best wishes for a quick recovery,” Mycroft said with a smile that did nothing to warm his freezing eyes. And with a swing of his umbrella, he was gone.
“There are different kinds of rain,” John insisted. “Some are better than others. And what about you? Telling him to hurry because there’s special lip gloss to be examined?”
Her breath shuddered as she tucked the envelope back into her purse. She turned, rubbing the tears out from under her eyes as she walked toward the door.
average.” He dropped the tea bags into the mugs as if to punctuate this point. “I don’t know what you were expecting having me back here, but I’m still a goldfish, and I won’t be any less boring than I was the last time.”
a medication to reverse a reaction from an entirely new drug on which there was no research, no data, and no information available. And he had to do it in the time it took the demand for oxygen in John’s body to outweigh the supply, which could happen any moment. The slowing of the circulatory processes was gradual but the onset of shock would be sudden. Lack of oxygen. Loss of consciousness. Nothing to stop the progress of deterioration and total shut down. The impossibility of the situation was almost laughable.
“John’s playing rugby; he should be home shortly.” He stepped around her, dropping into his chair and pulling his laptop onto his knees.
He checked his phone and stuffed his hands into his pockets, exhaling a cloud of cold air. 4:35. No response from the doctor whose shift had ended at four. The cab ride from his surgery was twenty minutes in current traffic. He tried to analyse the probability of whether John would show up, but the numbers were unclear in his head. Frustrating. He could deduce whether a complete stranger would buy earrings or a necklace for his mother, yet still be uncertain about John, of all people. Words and numbers blurred around John in his mind. Irritating.
The nurse lifted Sherlock’s arm and gave him another injection just as he began to wake. His eyes dropped shut again and the nurses pulled him out of John’s arms and onto a gurney that had been brought in for the purpose. The doctor needed the space to work, to stabilise John, and this was not the time or place for Sherlock's antics.
The door burst open and two security guards rushed in. John’s arm was forced around behind his back and he was pushed forward, Sherlock in the same predicament at his side. They were taken swiftly down the corridor, down the back stairs and held in front of a back door. A third guard arrived with their coats.
“Because I don’t do bollocks like graduations and funerals and weddings, and I know I’m better out of your life than in it, but believe it or not I do care about you.”
Why did it have to be tonight? After the conversation he’d had with Mary earlier, he couldn’t. He had chosen to try to repair something. Maybe one day. He hoped one day…
John raised his eyebrows at her increasing vehemence and she checked the rise in her voice, taking a breath. Clearly she had strong opinions on the subject. She’d been living the controversy herself since she was fifteen.
John was hoping for more of an explanation, but Sherlock merely hummed his agreement, tilting his head as he slipped off on another train of thought.
“Or what?” one of the courser boys challenged him. “What are you going to do about it, toff? I’ll fight you!”
“She also said she left something of hers here… John works in her office, so he can return it to her tomorrow. But what was it? John do you remember?”
. Sherlock was not going to ponce off to Switzerland and expect John to spend the time cleaning the flat while he was away. On the other hand, the mess was grating enough on John’s military sense of cleanliness that he knew he wouldn’t be able to ignore it. Solution? Simple enough; he’d hire a cleaning service with Sherlock’s money.
“Right.” Lestrade knew this was a polite request for him to leave. He started to turn away but stopped. “Has Sherlock ever…” he trailed off for a moment. “Is this the first time this has happened?”
Into the woods again. Into the dark. Like with Moriarty, when it had ended with a fall, and he was dead for two years. Like with Magnussen, when Mary killed him, and he was dead for six minutes. He wished it would be as simple as dying again, but this was different.
“No,” John cut him off. “I’m not leaving. I’m going to ignore him, and we’re going to finish this game.”
“I wasn’t laughing at you,” Sherlock repeated. “That phone call,” he said looking at John’s chest because it was easier than looking at his eyes, “it wasn’t just part of the trick. It was the only way I could say goodbye. I knew the mission I’d accepted would take years, and I didn’t know if I’d come back.” Sherlock cleared his throat. “It was—the phone call was—for me, the very least enjoyable part of the plan.”
Sherlock thought, even closing his eyes at the profundity of his mistake. John should have smashed his head into the ground a long time ago. It would have saved them the agony of a two-year experiment that Sherlock thought they both needed but realised now they never did.
When he came back down wearing a faded t-shirt and a pair of jogging bottoms, which felt extra cosy compared to the wet denim he’d traded for them, he found Sherlock sitting back at the table. He was wearing silk pyjama bottoms now and a silk t-shirt
“Yes, the flat across the way”—Sherlock pointed out the window indicating their victim’s flat—“Were they moving furniture recently?”
Granted ‘hopelessly in love’ would look different on Sherlock Holmes—Sociopathic Mad Scientist—than it would on anyone else. To the average observer Sherlock’s behaviour toward John wouldn’t appear much different than it was with anyone else, merely that he allowed John to remain in his company for far longer than he would anyone else. However, to Lestrade the evidence was overwhelming.
Sherlock stopped as well and took a step back toward him. “Tell me, John, after you’ve killed someone what's your most pressing problem?”
“I’m afraid it’s a rather posh affair. Black tie, you know how these things are,” she looked worriedly at John as though he might back out.
He realised all of this before his seventeenth birthday and he was determined to teach it to Sherlock. He’d been through hell and back but Sherlock didn’t have to. He could avoid all of it, all of the pain. Mycroft had always been level-headed and stoic to the point of unnerving his teachers. Thinking about what loss had done to him he knew he couldn’t allow it to happen to Sherlock. Because if it hurt him that much, he was certain it would destroy his more sensitive little brother.
Quickly John shot the cameras blocking his path to the doors. He moved swiftly, stepping over Moran’s body and punching the button for the lift. It was empty when it arrived and he hit the button for the lobby.
"We got Parker’s body in yesterday,” Hannah said, “and I just—I thought it was odd to see the scars again. Especially since they weren't related to the cause of death in either case.  I've prepped a lot of bodies and I've seen some weird stuff, but never twice, and in two separate cases, on two unconnected people..."
“By making the necessary inquiries I discovered that there was one woman who had appointments with all three of our dead men on Friday, October ninth. Her name is Karina. More likely
Sherlock began walking up the block toward the Bauer woman's house. There was the sound of an engine. A car door slammed.
John cleared his throat. He knew it must have been as unpleasant for her to come here as it had been for him. “Fine.”
Sherlock turned in his chair to face John. "Either directly or indirectly, yes. The pattern of scarring is too unusual. It would be a considerable coincidence if it was entirely unrelated to his murder."
“Severe blood-loss is only one cause of shock," Sherlock said dismissively. "The victim didn’t lose any blood before he died. I'm certain. But bacteria or chemicals could induce it. The autopsy will show us if there’s a foreign substance in his blood.” Sherlock leaned back in the seat and drummed his hands on his knees impatiently. “Give me the details from his file.”
She and John had never been close. Apart from the occasional Christmas or birthday do the only times she saw him were when Sherlock brought him to the lab. She remembered the first time Sherlock brought him in. She’d been shocked. Sherlock existed in a world of his own, practically oblivious to the people and voices around him, often not knowing or caring who he was talking to or even whether other people were still in the room. So when Sherlock brought John to the lab she was stunned to see that Sherlock
John: alive, awake, moving, breathing, shifting, small expressions and gestures flitting through his body with the energy that animated him. Warm blood, warm skin, strong pulse: life-force, real, overwhelmingly present. He had come back.
“Mycroft Holmes,” Mycroft Holmes said, stepping forward to shake the doctor’s then Lestrade’s hand. Lestrade took one look and estimated that the man’s suit might cost more than his car. “You must be Detective Inspector Lestrade. Please accept my apology for the trouble my little brother has caused you tonight.”
“And you named our imaginary dog ‘Waffles’?” If he ever thought he had reached a point where Sherlock could no longer surprise him, he was proven wrong time and time again.
“Fine.” John straightened his uniform jacket. “I’ll go.” He walked toward the door. “Food and rest tonight; that’s an order.”
Lestrade had grinned at the confirmation. So he’d been right. The socks must be important if Sherlock was willing to fly in from Ireland for it.
“Forgive me?” Sherlock asked, stuffing his hands into the front pockets of his trousers and posing two questions at once.
Sherlock pulled a key from his pocket as they reached the door to the room. “Relax, I had them bring up a spare bed.”
“The poison is new," Sherlock said, tilting his head to admire John's ability to look defiant in a wool-knit jumper. "My theory is they’re testing it and they don’t want anyone looking too closely before they’ve had a chance to get it right. A stabbing rules out the need for an autopsy completely and they think they’re safe.”
Mycroft would shake his head. “You’re a very stupid little boy. How disappointing for Mummy and Daddy.”
Now the wrist was throbbing with the rapid beating of Sherlock’s heart; so full of life and energy he could feel it fluttering wildly against his palm. John sucked in a sharp breath at experiencing the sensation his brain had only simulated in dreaming—willing a heartbeat into veins that had been devastatingly still.
“Right,” John panted, “I kiss you back and what? I see you again in another three days? I don’t like your
“I guess I’m going as well then.” Out of the corner of his eye Sherlock could see him flexing his hands the way he did when he was anxious.
How could he have fallen for such nonsense? In what alternate universe did Mary’s distaste for being honest with her husband justify her shooting Sherlock through the chest? Sherlock-world. Apparently Mary-world too.
“Then you couldn’t possibly be wrong, considering your record for your incisive and percipient assumptions.”
If it hurt, Sherlock gave no indication. He remained motionless and John watched as his eyes cooled and his breathing evened. The wind lifted his black curls back from forehead. He finally broke their eye contact by turning his head to the side.
“Is he?” Mycroft’s indolent sarcasm snapped John’s awareness back to centre and he felt a slight flush in his face. He'd forgotten who he was talking to.
John stretched, creating a gap between his t-shirt and the top of his pyjama bottoms. "Lie down," he said.
John raised his eyes to the ceiling. On the one hand he wasn’t aware of giving Sherlock any look, but on the other hand his mad flatmate had just blatantly deemed cancer research unimportant.
He sinks to his knees. Graceful, always graceful. (He must have spent hours walking round with books balanced on his head when he was a child. It’s the only explanation.) His long, delicate fingers move nimbly over the body, never fumbling; undoing buttons, turning up sleeves—a smirk: a theory of his confirmed—turning down the collar, pulling shirt free from trousers. He hikes up the shirt to inspect the stab wound. A wider smirk, he knows what’s happened here.
And standing there, holding on to each other in the living room of 221B as though it were just the two of them, as though there weren’t eight million people rushing through the city around them, John knew he had never been happier. His wedding day didn’t come close to this—just this moment, standing here with Sherlock pressed close, and the promise of more, the promise of everything. Everything from the way Sherlock would look when he let John take him to bed and take him apart, to the new cases and clients and gunshots and blog posts: their life. It would be their life as it always had been but now without bars and barriers—enhanced, free to be all it could be: research and experiments and fieldwork and Barts and bickering and the violin and sex. Whenever Sherlock didn’t have a case John fully intended to make his head spin in a different (but he hoped no less enjoyable) way. (He hadn’t earned a reputation over three continents for being just mediocre in bed.)
Sherlock reappeared in the living room fully dressed. John gaped at him, still sitting on the floor. Was Sherlock Superman? Could he have lived with him this long and not known?
John hesitated, unsure, almost deciding on the truth, but then Sherlock looked up at him. John fumbled with his words. Sherlock stood and walked around the table, still looking at him like that. He was too close, and then he took a step closer. The smell of that expensive shampoo combined with the unique scent of his skin—something like the cold metal of lab tables and the electricity of adrenaline—it was as heady and overwhelming as it always was whenever Sherlock got too close and John chose the lie.
John looked down at the mugs and suddenly did not feel like making tea for Sherlock. But on the other hand he’d already prepared everything and to not give Sherlock a cup now would appear to be a passive-aggressive move, which could add hostility to what had been a very mild (for Sherlock) exchange of words. So John settled for simply giving the contentious scientist one sugar rather than the two he preferred.
Harriet was five years older. The age gap was too big when they were young. From the day they brought him home his parents had made her the babysitter.
In the fourth week the nightmares subsided and they didn’t return. Even after The Woman’s case there were no nightmares of American agents with guns at his neck, and after Baskerville there were no nightmares of gigantic hounds in secret labs. John wasn’t afraid of dying. That wasn’t it.
Sherlock had been functioning and reacting well enough that John was willing to take him home, but he was going to watch his symptoms closely. At the first sign of deterioration they were going straight to a hospital.
No, Sherlock was not a child anymore. And of all the lessons learned, this was the one Mycroft had hoped he would never have to.
John scoffed in the sort of half-amusement Sherlock had come to associate with what John considered to be abnormal social behaviour, and Sherlock reaffirmed his decision that John couldn’t leave. It was an anomaly in the universe that such a thing as a John Watson existed, and Sherlock would never give up anything so valuable or rare.
Sherlock was as strong as any man, stronger even, sure, but he was graceful; he was antisocial, but fashionable and cultured; genius, but entirely impractical; domineering, but helpless in so many ways… John remembered the flutter of fondness in his chest the first time Sherlock had called him from the hallway: “John! What’s it doing?” he had asked blinking with large eyes at their washing machine. John had to reset the machine to clear all of the buttons Sherlock had pushed. He remembered Harry’s words to him at the café not so long ago. Perhaps she had had a point…
Until now his awareness had been narrowed to the attacker and then to Sherlock. Now he noticed the two chairs a few paces off and the handcuffs that had been dropped behind one of them. And further toward the back of the space were two bundles of black mass that looked disconcertingly like dead bodies.
John felt distinctly satisfied as Sherlock crossed to the game cupboard. There may be only one consulting detective in the world, but he was fairly certain there was also only one person who could handle him.
Or perhaps not entirely without warning. Sherlock, considering his specific skillset, would have been hard-pressed not to notice John’s weight loss, his stress levels, his exhaustion from sleepless nights over the past year and especially in the last few months. The signs of an unhappy marriage were all there. Sherlock had just preferred not to officially file them, because John was supposed to be with Mary. There had been a wedding. He’d said goodbye to his flatmate and embraced Mr. and Mrs. Watson. He’d known it was for the best, and all evidence to the contrary had been ignored. Yet here John was, standing in the doorway with suitcases and looking at Sherlock and being entirely un-ignorable.
But it didn’t prevent her from following Billy out into the corridor the next time he appeared, cornering him against the door and demanding to know why he was giving Sherlock drugs.
It seemed like a year that it was just Mary’s voice. She was telling him she loved him. He wished she would stop. He couldn’t hear the entirety of what she was saying but certain sentences came through clearly.
John slowly moved his hand out from under Sherlock’s. He tucked his phone away and wrapped his arm back around him. He looked out the window at the streets of the city they both loved, the city that tried to kill them on a regular basis, giving them the danger they needed to survive.
“Hi John, I’ve got this new case in Switzerland, would you like to come with me?” John said to the empty seat across from him.
“Didn’t,” Sherlock corrected. John nudged him with his knee and Sherlock wished his capricious flatmate-assistant would make up his mind about whether or not they had to be polite.
John didn’t bother wondering why Mycroft hadn’t asked for the reason he wanted to know. With Mycroft it was always safe to assume he already knew.
Molly knew Sherlock appreciated her help, but he was working like a bat out of hell and she understood that any politeness or display of gratitude (normally a struggle for him) would be beyond his ability at this point. So she gritted her teeth and did what she was told, making excuses for missing work and only going home to sleep for a few hours at a time. Each time she arrived back at the lab it was as though Sherlock hadn’t noticed she’d gone. There was no greeting, and often he was already halfway through a sentence as she walked in the door.
“Why are you asking me, Mr. Shag-a-Lot Homes?” John returned, referring to one of the many headlines that had come out in the tabloids the week Janine had taken her story to the press.
“Say it,” Sherlock repeated. John knew better than anyone there was no deterring a curious consulting detective.
Sherlock smirked. The art of bollockspeak was not lost on John. “Tell us what you remember about the last time you saw Amy.”
kiss each other. Except when Sherlock needed to test a method of drug transmission for a case. Then apparently it was all right.
Sherlock pulled his eyes open and found himself face down in his bed, fully clothed except for his shoes. Stiffly, he pulled his phone out of his pocket and did his best to bring the symbols on the display into focus. Six p.m. Wednesday.
Window. Ledge. By stepping on an empty crate he was able to pull himself up onto it. Kneeling on the ledge he looked into the dimly lit space. He could see a large man crouched on the floor, and beneath him—
“And no running off,” John said. “It’s incredible you haven’t already fainted; I don’t want to get a phone call saying you’re passed out in a gutter somewhere.”
John knelt over him. He felt his forehead, checked his eyes. In the soft mixture of street and moon light John could see Sherlock’s pupils dilated to the correct level in the dark. The heroin had worn off. His eyes ran down to the detective’s neck. Sherlock swallowed and winced. John knew the pain must be considerable if the detective wasn’t able to ignore the complaints of his transport the way he usually did.
When John left he'd taken all of the magic with him. Now when Sherlock dropped his coat on the floor it stayed there. Now when he put dishes in the sink they were still there the next day. It was horrible. Where there had always been an assortment of food and body parts in the fridge, now there were only body parts. Sherlock’s jaw clenched as he looked around at what even
, Mrs. Hudson!” It was maddening to speak words and have them go so entirely unheard, despite speaking loudly, clearly, and even in the correct language.
"You’ve been my inspiration throughout the cases and a reason to live between them. You’ve saved my life in more ways than I would have thought possible. You’ve always been everything I’ve ever needed, and now I need you to be awake.”
come back? John dismissed that train of thought. There was no understanding Sherlock’s motives until he explained them. No use guessing.
Mrs. Hudson left the flat and Sherlock dropped down into his chair. He had a message on his phone from Lestrade:
There was a flash of something in Sherlock’s eyes and he grinned. “Good,” he said. He dropped John’s gaze and John was surprised to see him hesitate for a moment. He looked back up at John for a second before turning away.
And it wasn’t. Mycroft liked to make everything about him (at least Sherlock had thought the solar system revolved around the Earth. Mycroft believed it revolved around himself). Prison might have been the trigger, but the truth was Sherlock would have found drugs anyway. His brain was like a rocket trapped on a launch pad, tearing itself to pieces, and the distractions that the world had to offer—school, research, experiments, even the violin—would have lost their effectiveness with time. He was young, but even then it was inevitable that he would discover the euphoric effects of the chemicals that could save him from himself.
In contrast to the ultramodern club, the upstairs décor seemed an attempt to mimic the style of an old Parisian brothel. Chandeliers lined the hallway ceiling and ornate doorways led off to, what John assumed, were the bedrooms.
John balked. “Sherlock,” he said, stepping over to where the detective was standing with his back to him. “Look, you’re a very, er, attractive man, but you can’t expect—I mean, you don’t think—”
The hesitancy, the uncertainty, the sincerity in the voice he’d come to need as much as its owner made him sink to his knees. Sherlock was here; he must be standing right beside him. But John was nowhere. It was like a nightmare where he was right where he needed to be but couldn’t get there. Lost at home. Desperate to find the person whose voice was all around him. He was with Sherlock now and there was no way to get to him. He wanted to scream in frustration.
Sherlock had almost forgotten what it was like to come home to a flat that wasn’t empty. He regarded John, who was curled on the couch wearing a long-sleeved shirt and pyjama bottoms. He took a step closer and John stirred.
She was crouched in an empty room down the corridor so Sherlock wouldn’t hear her. The precaution was probably unnecessary. She didn’t think he had noticed she’d left.
something at the back of his mind shouted and Sherlock reacted like a switch had been flipped. He grabbed John’s arms and pushed him back, propelling himself off the table.
Sherlock arrived in the kitchen only to turn back around for the living room. Mycroft was not home. Sherlock had known he wouldn’t be. He rarely used this flat. When he wasn’t out of town on business he preferred to use the rooms he had in the centre, closer to his office. Breaking in hadn’t exactly been easy, but then Sherlock didn't require easy when it came to breaking and entering. He never let Lestrade forget how fortunate it was for Scotland Yard that he found solving crimes more interesting than committing them.
Oddly, the temptation to contact John was strongest when Sherlock was cold. Huddled in an alleyway in Helsinki waiting for his target, eavesdropping on a fire escape in Moscow for hours waiting for one pertinent piece of information, tracking terrorists in Syria through freezing desert nights… In those coldest hours he went back to Baker Street in his mind palace. He opened the door and it was warm and John was there, moving around the kitchen in one of his jumpers, usually making tea.
“Couch,” John had announced definitively, shrugging off his suit jacket and starting to work at the buttons of his waistcoat.
He felt his airway cut off. He had roughly fifteen seconds left of consciousness. Two minutes until death. He wouldn’t have minded nearly so much if it wasn’t for that persistent problem of desperately wanting to continue to live a life that had John in it.
John flinched and Sherlock stepped toward him. “Sorry,” he said using the same concerned puppy-eyes he’d used in Dartmoor when John figured out Sherlock had tried to drug him. No wonder Sherlock was so successful at manipulation; anyone who could manage puppy-eyes like
Lestrade shrugged. “There aren’t any other consulting detectives. If we lost you then who would we have to annoy us at crime scenes?”
While John might seem like Mr. Sociable next to Sherlock (Ivan the Terrible would seem like Mr. Sociable next to Sherlock), the truth was he’d always been a bit of a loner. He accepted the people he was thrown together with, but never made the effort to gain new friendships or found the motivation to maintain established ones. This was partly the reason he’d come back from Afghanistan with no one to call.
Sherlock found himself standing at the side of John’s bed. He didn’t remember getting to his feet or crossing the small hotel room. Automatic actions. No conscious thought required. In his sleep John turned onto his left side, facing him, and Sherlock tensed. He could see the tightness in John’s jaw, his closed eyes squeezing shut harder as if he could prevent himself from seeing what was not visible.
“You haven’t been listening,” Sherlock growled, grabbing John’s right arm and jerking him towards him. “I told you I fixed it.”
He channelled his anger into his movement, allowing it to push him, strain his muscles aching with the need to fight. Sherlock thought he could do that? Sherlock had kissed
It was all very childish. The best Mycroft could do then was to remind Sherlock of the lesson he’d learned a long time ago.
“Because of his socks,” Sherlock said, his bright eyes already running across the posh flats in front of them.
“Ok, Sherlock,” John sarcastically repented, shrugging his shoulders and lifting his hands. “Forget my suggestions then. I’m just saying that even people with average intelligence find ways to entertain themselves. Since yours is slightly above average”—Sherlock made a strangled noise—“I figured you’d be able to think of
Sherlock didn’t come home that night, or the next, and eventually John got tired of waiting around to die.
John slatted his eyes at his suddenly chipper flatmate. He did not like that tone on Sherlock one bit.
"There are many unknowns in this universe,” Sherlock snapped, “including how you manage function on a daily basis with such a miniscule store of knowledge in your brain.”
There was a hesitant knock at the door. Odd. Mary wouldn’t knock like that. A second later Molly was standing in the doorway.
Upon initial inspection the murder appeared to be a mugging. Victim was male, early thirties, dressed in a smart suit. He’d been stabbed in his left side; blood soaked through his shirt and suit jacket, staining the pavement where he lay sprawled on his side. Wallet and phone not found on the body, evidently stolen.
