you. It’s just I don’t want to see you with anyone else because it should be me!” Well. That’s one way to say it.
Castiel frowned, clearly picking up on Dean’s concealed distress. “Dean, please believe me. You are a really good--”
greeted Dean first. After an agonizing beat, he finally glanced towards Dean, and with an even more monotone voice than normal, said, “Dean.”
When they finished eating, Sam and Eileen glanced at each other and without a word stood up. "Thanks for the meal, you guys. We can handle the dishes tonight," Sam said.
Dean shook his head. "I’ve been wracking my brain for days and can’t think of anything. I think we just need to hit the books. Surely, somewhere in this bunker is something that will help."
Dean was interrupted by Castiel pushing him up against the wall. He was even more furious now. “Don’t tell me what I mean, Dean. You taught me to think and feel for myself, and I
This seemed to piss Sam off. “Can you for once just drop the macho act and be honest? You have nothing to prove to me--nor to Cas!”
One night, several hours into his drinking binge, Dean was thoroughly drunk when he tried to get off his bed to go to the bathroom. He fell, hitting his head against the desk, and he cursed loudly. By the time Dean stood back up, Sam had already opened the door to his room.
“Hey!” Dean protested though he knew it was true. “You can’t be much better at it than me, you only just started feeling them.”
Maniacal laughter broke the silence and Castiel looked back up to find the Empty wearing Meg’s face. "You really thought it was going to be that easy to leave? I don’t think so. We made a
Good question. There was a twist in his gut that intensified whenever he imagined Sam and Castiel together, but he didn’t know what it meant--or rather, he didn’t want to look too closely at it, because he suspected he
Once safely in his room, he took a quick shower before opening the bottle, drinking until he no longer saw Castiel’s face whenever he closed his eyes.
Sam flinched, as if he had been under a trance--under a trance because of Castiel’s eyes and, oh God, this had to stop, this was so wrong--and glared at Dean. “I know you’re curious too, Dean, don’t deny it!”
Of course he did. The more often, the better. Dean said instead, “Yeah, buddy, if that’s what you want.”
Dean awoke to knocking at his door. He slowly sat up on his bed, then cursed as the roaring headache set in. "What?!" he shouted at the door.
Soon enough they were all seated at the table, Sam and Bobby on one side, Dean and Castiel on the other. While eating, they all got caught up in a lively debate over the best way to kill vampires.
? Dean couldn’t believe his eyes, but it was true, Sam had a little more color to his face now. “Thanks, Cas. But if I had kept kissing you, would you have woken up?”
This time Bobby practically growled into the phone and Dean jumped despite himself, not expecting it. “I’m sorry, princess, did you want some quick and easy solution? Tough shit, this is what we got so suck up your pride and deal with it, Dean.” Dean was stunned into silence so Bobby continued in a calmer tone, “I’ll let you know if I find anything else, but don’t call and whine again.”
“Shit, god, yes,” Dean hissed before catching Cas’s mouth and doing his best to taste every part as his own hands dropped between them. His hands were trembling enough that it took two tries to unbutton the other guy’s jeans.
The guy gave them both a wounded look and practically ran off. The group had moved on without them, but he didn’t go their way either.
This was the song he really got to sing in Benny’s pauses, their voices overlapping perfectly, even better than practice. Dean was sweating and flying and he loved this part where the music throbbed down to his bones. He kept glancing near the door, but that damn white kept catching his attention. The eye is naturally drawn to light colors, he seems to remember his obnoxiously smart brother pointing out when looking at album covers.
“Nope, not here to attend. Can you pass this on to him?” He held out the flyer and kept the receipts.
After the burgers were gone and his ice was melting in pale brown droplets, Dean let out a satisfied sigh. His appetite felt sated finally, at least until he checked his phone.
“No, I don’t attend public places commonly. I have been to at least one house on each and every block we’ve passed. See, that is where Mrs. Montgomery had me bless her husband’s picture after he passed away. And the yellow house at the end, the Coleman family had a fire and St. Michael’s helped raise money to replace their kitchen.”
, Dean. And most law schools like seeing an undergraduate in Liberal Arts, it shows their students are well-rounded. When is the rest of the band coming in?”
This was a subject Castiel was still passionate about, even after sitting and listening to many, many people pour out their vices. “Any so bad that it can destroy the grace of your soul if left to fester. Begin with the ten commandments. A man may blaspheme in shock or anger, and that is a venial sin. But if he does so often and willingly, knowing how wrong it is, then that has is damaging his immortal soul.”
“C’mon Cas, quick, your fuckin’ house is burning down!” he barked, nearly jumping as Cas’s hands rose to grip the sleeves of his leather jacket.
Pleased, Castiel picked up the delicious food and ate the rest of it. When his plate was empty, he swiped his thumb along the surface of the plate. He sucked the ketchup off.
Dean made sure a beer was waiting for Cas when he arrived. it must have surprised him, because he stared at the seat next to Sam with some hesitance.
It was the number one thing his father warned him against. Always be on the case, even when you’re not on the case.
Before either of them could speak, the ever-present background noise of screams and wet, darker sounds intensified. Black-eyed creatures poured into Dean’s space, moving past him to claw at the angel.
Cas knew Dean didn’t exactly have a home growing up, and Dean knew that Cas had good parents who worked hard on their charities and philanthropies.
Castiel was walking back from the bathroom, brow furrowed as he stared at his phone. A tad dangerous to do in a crowd with little coordination and drinks in hand, especially wearing white.
Dean chewed on his lower lip as he looked at the last bite of pie. Should he, like, ask Cas out? Did he even have to?
He grabbed a few twenties out of his bag, palmed the key and double checked the perimeters. Because he was a paranoid bastard he always sprinkled salt on the sills and entrances so he’d know if someone entered his domain besides him.
The Roadhouse was ran by a no-nonsense woman named Ellen. He had only spoken on the phone with her before, and she showed them everything they needed to set up immediately.
All he knew for sure was that Cas’ mouth was on his. His lips were softer than he thought a guy’s might be, a hint of barely-there stubble against his chin, the scent of honey and bite of alcohol filling his senses.
“That’s what I want to do,” Cas said quietly as they watched a man demonstrate a prosthetic hand that he controlled with his thoughts. It was still in development, the speaker hastened to say, but the technology was well on its way to being a reality.
After he was set up in Sam’s room, which certainly was not a dingy two twin bed shoebox, he pulled off his boots and checked his phone. He ignored his little brother’s knowing look.
Jo blushed a bit and poked around her roast beef sandwich oozing with cheese and onions. “Good, good. I’ve been working a lot lately though, so hardly any fun time for me.”
Messy black hair and that familiar white hoodie. Shame burned in his stomach as he devoured him with his eyes. It was safe, nobody was looking his way. The other guys were wearing white jackets and...and Sam was standing right next to Cas, laughing with his huge paw on the hoodied arm.
Castiel stared at himself in the mirror. He would’ve been able to heal this wound instantaneously before, now he had to monitor it for a week or more as his newly human body healed itself at a glacial pace. Then he felt a new pain originating from his stomach: hunger. He hadn’t felt hunger in
She was a little startled at first by his sudden appearance, but quickly relaxed. “Yeah, that’d be great. I’d love a Long Island.”
"If you were able to make me fall asleep all by yourself, you would’ve done it already. But I’m still here, talking, so that means I’m actually the one in control. And I’m not resting until I’m free," Castiel said confidently, while internally not feeling very confident at all.
. But Dean didn’t know how to address why hearing that made him feel so cold and hollow. “So… you’re not interested in Sam?” he asked instead.
Sam’s eyes widened as he stepped forward to break them apart. “Okay you guys I think we’re getting off on the wrong foot here, how about we just talk about the case?”
Dean was more handsy than usual, frequently leaving his arm around his shoulders, taking his hand while showing him how to do something, or leaving his hand at the small of his back as he guided him somewhere. Castiel desperately told himself not to read anything into it, but it was causing all kinds of havoc in his stomach. He only hoped that he would be able to actually eat the food they were cooking, as it did smell amazing.
“Nothing happened, Sam,” Dean stalked back to his bed without a glance back, so he missed the surprise on Sam’s face.
version of Dean was horrifying enough, but seeing how close he got to killing the real deal was even worse. Only when Dean reached out to him, saying "I need you," was he able to stop.
Whenever there was any downtime, Dean ruminated on what he would say when he saw Castiel again. However, one night while driving to their latest motel, it suddenly dawned on him that it had been almost three weeks since he had heard anything from him. A longer absence wasn’t entirely unusual for Castiel, but there were usually at least a couple of text messages in the interim. This time, he had gotten nothing at all. It didn’t take a genius to figure out why.
"Maybe so, but I know how much you value silence. So I won’t shut up." Castiel thought a moment about how to approach it, before starting. "Dean Winchester was born on January 24, 1979, to John and Mary Winchester. He is the older brother to Samuel Winchester, born May 2, 1983. When Sam was six months old, the family lost Mary to Azazel. Afterward, John turned to hunting full-time while seeking Mary’s killer. Dean spent his childhood bouncing from motel to motel while told by John to look after Sam at all costs."
Dean’s jaw dropped again. A few feet behind them, Sam laughed nervously. “I think I’ll go and... get some food... be back later!” He ran out of the motel room and the door slammed behind him, but Dean didn’t hear any of it.
“That is true,” Castiel admitted, switching to a much more serious tone, “but at least I know and accept what I feel. Tell me, Dean, what do you feel?”
Dean watched from a moderate distance as Sam knocked on the door of the room Eileen was in. The door opened, and Eileen appeared, a huge grin stretching across her face at the sight of Sam, whose own grin matched hers. They conversed briefly in sign, both saying hello, before Sam leaned down to kiss her. There was nothing brief or simple about this kiss; it grew more fervent as they wrapped their arms around each other in a tight embrace.
"People don't need to pray to me or to sacrifice to me,” Jack explained, while Dean and Sam simply watched and listened. "They just need to know that I'm already a part of them and to trust in that. I won't be hands on. Chuck put himself in the story. That was his mistake. But I learned from you and my mother and Castiel that... when people have to be their best... they can be.”
He couldn’t even enjoy his burger as much as normal next to Cas’s quiet intakes of breath and mmm’s that vibrated deep in his throat. Not that he was annoyed, it was just...just…
Dean finally got off his knee and hugged Cas tightly, uncaring of the clapping or whistles or a few happy cheers around him. He hooked his chin over Cas’s shoulder and was just happy for a moment.
Yesterday was a hiccup. Today he would focus on the case and getting the hell out of here. So kidnapper didn’t go to the upstart church in a broken down building. Dean bet if the guy was so devoted he’d march his ass to that Catholic church with its overcompensating steeple.
.” Dean squeezed the erection trapped between them, making a crude pantomime against Cas’s hip. He liked ‘Cas’ better, stopped him from getting too excited about this being an angel.
The next looked promising, though he knew by now that was a lie. Colorful, he gave it a nine. Smelled good, he gave it an 8. It wasn’t greasy or runny so he jotted down 6. By the time he scooped up a tiny portion he was feeling better about this and life in general.
“No, there is a wood slot beneath that just for this purpose.” Castiel reached for the small stack of papers next to his other thigh, realizing how badly his fingers were shaking when he almost dropped the whole pile.
The same thing happened at the church later. Resigning himself to being there the whole week, the Great Pipe project began. The place sorely needed it, whoever had worked on it before just replaced busted pipes and didn’t do it properly to boot. He’d need to take out all of them in the tiny, cramped space of the utility room standing right next to the hot water heater.
Oh, was it like that? Not that he’d judge his own flesh and blood, Sammy was a big boy. Dean did throw a wink their way as the next song started, Sell Your Soul.
Dean loved feeling the strings under his fingers. His callouses had formed long before he ever picked up a guitar, so the new ones blended right in. He warmed up on stage, some curious eyes turning his way from the early drinkers. It wasn’t their first gig or anything, but he always got hyped up before a performance.
He followed her little car further into town and down an old road to a rather picturesque house. Two levels, blue scalloped trim, and a neat lawn lined with oranges, yellows and more blue flowers. He grabbed his duffel bag and came around to lean against his passenger door.
But it was either let Sleazy McGrabbyhands go to the gym with his brother or not be alone with Cas at all before he left. Selfishness won out. “I’ll see you after your workout.”
Dean grabbed the flyers and ran his thumb along the slightly raised print. “Don’t worry. The worst they can do is say no.”
“He gets weird when I come around.” Dean barely realized he is completely invading the guy’s personal space, but there was no reaction so it must be fine. He’d had his arm around his shoulder a bunch, but it felt different facing him.
It was plucked from his hands, and he stared as Cas whirled it around his shoulders and pushed his arms through the sleeves.
When they finally backed up and slunk away, he turned to face the angel. Keeping the blade handy, even though it was as effective as holding a limp dick.
Dean paused. “Uh, yeah. You did great.” He shut the door and ran his fingers through his hair as he walked down the hall. Damn. Any better and he’d have forgotten everything and started actively plundering that honey-tasting mouth.
Now that Dean knows the extent of Sam's duplicity, he can plot his death accordingly. But first he has events to plan, parish to greet, and one foredained meeting.
Dean frowned. He knew Cas hadn’t dated in high school or in college, which made Dean incredibly nervous about what that said about Cas's experience, but shouldn’t parents just know this stuff?
After Sam had a meeting with his frat brothers, Dean puts his plan into operation. He double-checked nearby places on the computer that was lowkey. Sam would need alcohol and a quiet atmosphere.
Gabe was still in Sam’s personal space, boundaries!, and saying something about getting sweaty or whatever and Dean had enough.
“Was I bold enough?” Cas stood by the door so Dean could, and did, get a clear look at his concerned expression.
“And then,” Dean took a hand off his shoulder and reached to brush those long lashes, just the tips against the pad of his thumb, “these would be the first thing you lose. Not the last, because you’ve just seen the results and never been in the eye of the explosion. Hot oil will consume and destroy everything you own."
Dean couldn’t say exactly what it was, but heat shot down from his face, straight into his stomach to much lower. Then Cas backed up and opened the backseat door. Dean remained exactly where he was, staring at the lower half of Cas and the white hoodie curled in one arm.
“I didn’t mean I was the one being hurt, sorry,” Dean murmured, lifting Castiel’s hand and wetting the palm with his tongue. “Next time, Cas, should I confess this?”
It was a job that skirted the line of legality often, a line their father taught them how to avoid getting caught crossing. He was gone now, but Dean didn't know any other life and his brother didn't trust him on his own.
It was easy to find Taylor’s Market, especially since it was right next to a plain square building claiming to be the Town Hall and a shop actually called ‘
Apparently the process was going to be that any person could have a bowl of chili while they chatted with their neighbors and returned their scorecard after. The Judges would be receiving numbered bowls and writing down their thoughts without knowing who it belonged to.
Cas took it stoically though, not even showing he was perturbed. “He did say good night. He has class early in the morning.”
“Ah. I’m afraid our Daily Mass has already ended.” They both had that staring thing down pat, but Castiel wasn’t quite so...judgmental seeming. Also, he must be the only person in town who didn’t know who Dean was. But then there had to some townspeople who didn’t attend church.
Dean gets a little extra something-something for the chili cook-off. It may or may not go over well.
One, that enough people watched his televised kiss with Cas that he was recognized on Sam’s campus. Second, that Cas made the world’s best Burnt Sugar Caramel pie in the goddamn world.
At this Cas gasped, no amount of tightening or wriggling could dislodge the hand pressed against him.
A buzz immediately went up like someone punted a bee’s nest. Shit, they thought both were dropping the honorifics because of some religious pissing contest. So Dean pasted on his best smile and held out his hand.
He knew where it was, at the Arena, and which time the College of Engineering would have their commencement, in the evening. One of Sam’s frat brother promised to save him a seat as close to front as possible.
Even though Castiel stood up at the podium regularly and was well-known, he felt it remiss to not return the introduction. “Father Castiel Novak.”
Wasn’t Cas jealous?! Didn’t he care this arrogant jerk was hitting on Sam? Before Dean could shake off the firm grip, Gabe opened the door.
“A chili cook-off on Saturday. How fast do you think you could get word out and pull in at least a dozen participants?”
“There's incest in the Bible!” Dean yelled at the phone, but the call already clicked off. He chuckled as he finished packing the last few important items, his gun and his wallet of aliases.
"I knew from the beginning, Dean. He made the deal to save me, after all. But he asked me not to tell you, so I didn’t. I’m sorry, Dean. I truly am. But I can’t help," Jack said.
That much information was still enough. Moments later, Castiel was walking over to the bar and sitting on the stool next to Dean’s. “Hello, Dean.”
Castiel’s smile deepened. “I’ll keep them for today. In honor of…,” he paused, then said in a deadpan tone, “Dr. Sexy.”
"I’m sorry but I can’t tell you, you need to figure it out on your own," Jack said with a frown. "But know that I am rooting for you. For all of you."
After putting the mixtape back, he was able to find the comb which happened to have some of his hair on it. He took the comb and returned to where Sam and Eileen were waiting for him.
Any hope Castiel had left him. Dean didn’t want to let him down easy if it meant Castiel had to live with that for eternity in the Empty. But Dean still wanted to free him. And Castiel was never very good at denying Dean anything. He had to take a moment to think. "I don’t know of any spell on the top of my head that can free anything from the Empty."
know what it meant. So he went with the safe answer. “Cause it’d be weird as hell to see my little brother dating you.”
Dean pulled the hair off the comb and put it in the bowl with the herbs. "This is it, right?" Dean asked.
Bobby rolled his eyes. “Son, we all know you like him. That you like each other. You broadcast it every time you look at him.” He paused in thought. “In a way, it reminds me of how I used to look at Karen.”
All of his freak outs distilled into two words: “gay panic”. He couldn’t really deny that had something to do with it. But-- “It’s not just that, Bobby. When I kissed him and he woke up, that meant…,” he in particular really didn’t want to admit this, “That meant I’m his true love. But I can’t be. Surely that’s a mistake, cause look at me! I’m a terrible person. I did awful things in Hell. I don’t deserve to be anyone’s true love, much less his.” This Dean knew, deep in his bones. He didn’t deserve love. Especially not from someone like Castiel, who was so much better than him it was laughable.
Castiel hesitated, clearly also realizing that this was unusual for them. Then he seemed to make up his mind and gingerly sat down next to Dean. He didn’t leave much room between them, a couple of inches at most.
"I can’t do this in here, Cas. I promise, once we’re both back home, we’ll talk," Dean said softly. "But you have to help me make that happen. How can we get you out of here?"
The TV was currently in the middle of an episode. Dean filled Castiel in on what was going on. Unconsciously, he pulled Castiel even closer to him, so that their entire bodies were touching, and his arm remained draped across his shoulder. As his fingers slowly traced patterns on Castiel’s shoulder, the lingering tension seeped from his body.
Dean paid the bill with several more crumpled bills and made sure to tuck the receipt in his glove compartment to give to Charlie. He’d probably send a copy to Sam as well to get reimbursed twice. Nothing wrong with that, the money from the client only went to two people anyway.
The image the ashes of her mother’s body billowing about made her physically ill. She took an extra long drink of the italian soda.
Dean touched the blade to the bright red line travelling down to his jaw. “That was your first mistake, wasn’t it?” He pressed the tip into the stupid white shirt it was wearing, like it was about to pop into the office or some shit. He sliced all the way down to where he stabbed moments ago.
Dean hastily shoved the bottle in his pocket out of instinct, turning to see an older man with more trimmed hair on his face than head. Soft, pouchy skin under his keen eyes, but he wore a suit and that was a first since arriving in town.
He grinned back at his brother and took another huge bite. Should catch up to Cas at least, if nothing else to show he wasn’t a complete pansy.
The angel hardly reacted through the brutal motions that thudded against his chest. “I came to bring you out of Hell.”
Sammy would have been a better fit for this, but he was still tied up in a dogfighting ring bust. It would take an act of God, no pun intended, to pull that bleeding heart from abused animals.
Another long silence was his reply, so Dean resumed getting the pipes off without stripping the threads. He’d just take them down to the hardware store and see about replacing these for now.
A loud knocking interrupted his cleaning of dishes. He looked skyward, hoping against hope it wasn’t Crowley again. The man made his skin crawl, not with fear but disgust. Little men in little places who thought they knew what power was.
He searched for a plastic bag and threw the pipes in them. He could hear the excited patter of her feet behind him like an excited puppy.
Dean stopped stretching, pulling down the bottom of his shirt automatically. “If you’re sure. I don’t want to be accused of corrupting the priest.” He made himself chuckle.
Shoot. He rubbed his forehead. He should think it’s great news, but he kept hoping and hoping that he could be out of here by Sunday. Nothing was working out the way he wanted.
Dean sat in the backseat of his Impala alone, trying to glare holes into Sam while the bastard drove. He couldn’t believe it, it was barely even midnight! If he needed a dad...well, that time had long since came and gone. Dean even had to insist Cast sit up front with Sam, not that he’d blame him for being put out with his brother.
He made sure to stock up because the other store with a decent amount of food was on the other side of town. Which made it all of twenty minutes away, but clearly being able to walk anywhere was affecting his sense of distance.
“Shut up,” he gasped as he angled down just right to create pressure against the spot that would unravel them. “There’s nothing left for you to save.” Heat boiled under his skin, centering from where he violated, where he’d been violated any number of times.
How Dean knew what the creature was, he couldn’t say. He didn’t even believe in angels. But that didn’t stop him from rushing the creature and plunging his knife into its chest.
Cas saved her from another two minutes of additional explanation. “I appreciate the offer. I’m afraid Mass begins at five in the evening.”
A memory came up of last Sunday Mass, on that Father Gabriel led. In the back had sat several new people. On the right was an older man, which he doubted was sitting beside him now.
Cas blinked, somewhere between embarrassed and intrigued. Clearly he needed the advice if the thought was practically making him blush. It was too bad he wasn’t chasing a more aware person, because naivety like that should be coaxed out slowly.
So Dean found himself in Middlepoint Park early on Sunday, setting up tables and taping down paper banners Charlie made up at some point. She really was like a human dynamo, he wouldn’t know how to do half this stuff. Nor want to.
That hope was dashed when a woman peered around the corner, holding a phone to the side of her head. “Oh! Oh Glen, hold on.” She practically ran down the hall.
Dean squeezed his hands tightly. “I’m a sure thing for you. If you change your mind, fine. But I…” Damn, the words stuck in his mouth. He tried, he really did. “I need you. I need you.”
Jesse, if that was his name, looked up to Dean in a way that reminded him uncomfortably of Charlie when she was confiding why she chose him. Or perhaps it was the look of a child who’d been dragged across state lines?
“Well...doesn’t the Mayor sign off on it? What strings do you have to pull?” He was genuinely puzzled by this conversation.
“Thanks, looking forward to my turn on Thursday,” Sam called and looked so dang pleased that Dean made a sucking sound with his tongue against his teeth. It wiped the smile right off Sam’s face, he hated that sound. “Look Dean, this isn’t that type of fraternity. They enacted the Men of Principles program a few years ago and I wouldn’t have joined a fraternity like that anyway.”
Sam raised an eyebrow, staring at the bag like it was gonna carry itself out with or without Dean. “Yeah...I guess. So...you two doing okay?”
“Actually I meant the impressive array of beer and liquor bottles hidden in your cupboard. Planning on dumping it outside of city limits?” Crowley had a way of talking that was both pompous and knowing, when he didn’t know anything at all.
Dean climbed over one person and nearly missed another in his haste. “Hey, I’m sorry. I’m an ass. At any point, at all, have you liked Cas? Like in a dating way?”
“Oh, was I mistakin’?” Benny somehow looked even more pleased with himself. If his grin got any bigger the top of his head was going to fall through that shit-eating maw. “I never did make it as a wise man.”
“Celeste is here for the long haul. She’ll keep fighting no matter how hopeless the cause. But you’re not that type. When the going gets tough, you get going.”
If that wasn’t a gauntlet thrown down Dean didn’t know what was, and he never backed down from a fight.
The door opened and Gabe walked in with four beers, slowing as he approached the awkward tableau. “Good timing?” he joked.
Dean cursed and resisted the urge to suck on his thumb after it pinched between two pipes. But not knowing the last time these were cleaned stopped that impulse dead in its tracks.
Both Cas and Sam quickly picked up their beers out of the way, smart boys. Finally they were drinking. If they were both shy, that was going to make this a little trickier. The next round was going to give them liquid courage posthaste.
It wasn’t until the weight lifted that Dean realized he was offering whiskey to a friar. He stared owlishly at Cas, who was reading the label carefully. Offering a teasing grin, Dean gestured. “Not against the church, remember?”
A burst of sound happened behind him, and Dean caught the movement of feathers out of the corner of his eyes. Full, thick, and beautiful. But before he could crane his head to look, he felt two fingers press against his forehead.
It took him a moment to notice Dean was watching him intently. It sent a throb of heat through Castiel, which was alarming.
She noticed his sudden stillness. “I’m not trying to pry. I’m sure it will be great. I know some get it all written out weeks in advance, but you couldn’t do that, could you? I used to cram the night before because my thoughts are always jumping all over the place.” She let out a breathy chuckle that was more nervous than amused.
Cas plucked them from his palm and carefully smoothed it out of his knee. He was in all black again, with just a band of white along his collar. A reminder why he wasn’t affected by earthy things.
The overblown sympathy was immediate as Bella nodded. “I’m sure I missed your visits, but I remember seeing your sisters and brother. It’s so good to see a family that cares.”
Dean finished brushing his teeth and cleaning up before looking in the cupboards for cereal. He stopped by the grocer again since their odd showdown, but it was a chatty little blonde behind the counter.
Sam was desperately searching for his headphones, which were on the other side of the computer. “C’mon. I don’t do that to you.”
Castiel? What sort of name was that? But he didn’t want Sam to get all butthurt, so he leaned over to shake the other man’s hand. It was surprisingly firm and the skin not exactly rough, but not lily-soft like Percy or Roland. “You drink?”
Blue eyes filled his vision, the priest in question was kneeling beside him and reaching a hand out.
Percy grinned at him, eager to share. “Every year we have the Monster Apocalypse, where different teams can build a machine and battle. We didn’t do it last year because most of us were on Men of Principle duty. Do you know how many Chapters have closed in just a few years? The Gamma Chapter is killing it and they wanted us to give speeches.” He high-fived the other guy, Roland or something.
Dean busied himself with wiping the pipes down so he could transport them without having to clean Baby’s interior. “Nothing. He just stopped by to talk.”
Dean let out a hoarse breath to cool the burn.“I wanted to see if you’d do it.” He held out the bottle back to Cas and jiggled it to let the liquid slosh loudly. He chuckled as the weight lifted and the sound of deep swallow filled the air.
That was Grace’s fault. But now that Charlie knew who Bella was, she affected a look of sadness. It was in her blood to navigate the shallow waters of egotistical women. “Thank you so much for saying that. It’s been really hard these past several weeks.”
Confirming through text Benny would be at the church tomorrow, he didn’t have much going on that night except sleep. And thinking. Sleep it was.
He didn’t dare ask if Benny saw Sam to not give away the fact he hadn’t, in fact, spoke to him at all. But when Benny wasn’t looking Dean crept to the curtain and parted it with his thumb to peek through.
To the far left were three men he did not recognize. One listened eagerly the whole time, a fresh-faced teenager. The other two were mature, late twenties or early thirties perhaps. One of the men had wavy hair to his shoulder, and the other had light brown hair cropped to about an inch or two.
Jo was quiet for a moment. “Did you have to stop by the gingerbread house?” That was her clever way of calling Charlie’s mom a witch.
“Why don’t we let Cas pick?” Dean said generously. It was fair, Cas seemed like he’d be the dominant one in the relationship. He was quiet, but not weak. He exuded this air of surety and self-confidence that wasn’t arrogance. It was just...there.
Right. Right. Shit, he was telling him how to hit on Sam. “Yeah. I should probably get some water.” His own voice was husky, aching just as much as he was. Cas hesitated then moved off his lap, luckily none the wiser that Dean was hard enough to cut glass. He stood up, turning quickly to make his escape to the kitchenette.
He glanced over his shoulder and gave her his most winning smile. “The more of a feel I get for the place, the more I know what I’ll say.”
“I’m just saying. If you need anything, come to me.” Crowley nodded and spotted someone he waved to and left the table.
Yes, it would be at the church. No, it was not still covered with thorny vines. The flowers did bloom, they were beautiful.
Dean tilted his head at the picture of Cas. With two people hanging off him. At least Cas wasn’t smiling at the camera, looking irritated instead, but the guy had his fingers curled around his waist.
Dean wasn’t completely oblivious. He looked between Cas and Sam who were on the same side of the table but didn’t hold hands or even brush knees. Hell, Dean’s calf touched Cas’s on accident more than those two were touching.
“Just take a seat. It’s just the two of us, unless you got a problem with germs?” Dean twisted the cap off and waited for Cas to shake his head before drinking straight out of the bottle. He’d never had Jack Daniels Honey. The sweet smoothed out a lot of the bite he normally associated with the stuff.
Seriously though, he understood the parallels. Their own mother died when Sammy was just a baby, leaving their retired cop turned private dick father with two boys and one way to support them. It wasn’t an easy life, but Dean couldn’t complain. They helped people.
“I know your kind,” he said slowly, considering his words. “You put up a good front, son. But I know.”
Another image popped up in his head for a moment, of sunny stairs and the round curve encased in grey jeans. He shook his head and got to typing.
“Of course, Father.” Edith looked between them as if unable to decide which to settle on. “Thank you Pastor, but only if it’s not too much trouble.”
Against all his finer minded instincts, Castiel turned his head and leaned close to the holes angled so he couldn’t see past them. He stared at nothing and waited.
Once Dean paid, and he did pay this time by snagging the check first, he debated on how to do this as they left. Should he say he had to do band stuff and leave them alone together?
His eyes rose and met Cas’s and it was hard to breathe. Damnit, he knew that hot, trembling feeling in his lower stomach. Clearing his throat, he toyed with the empty bottle. “I think I’ve embarrassed myself enough for the night. I think I’m about to go.”
“No, I was just asking because...I’m not really looking for anyone right now. I’ve got my hands kinda full.” He thought of a mouth that was maybe softer than it looked and lingering stares. “Are you coming to the cook-off?”
“There, that’s your Complimenting 101.” Dean grinned. “Feel free to add new parts or change ‘em up when eating something different. Cooks love compliments, you see. It soothes the pain from oven burns and seared eyelashes.”
Attending Bowling Night had been a tactical error. A massive lapse of judgment. His own. He forgot most of these people had known each other their whole life.
The other two judges and the prize would be a ‘surprise’ and it would be, because he had no idea how to answer either question yet. He reached the middle of the street and saw someone else had already placed yellow flyers all down the other side of the street.
Since they walked to the exhibit, Cas made his goodbyes on the stairs of the event center and left on foot. Sam and Dean turned the other way, and one of them had a mission.
“This isn’t right.” It felt great, but something was nagging at the back of his mind. “If you’re mad at Sam…”
“Not in that order, I hope,” Sam mumbled, hiking both duffel bags on his shoulders after emptying all the trash they accumulated over the car ride here.
The clapping the suitably loud and a few cheers went up. More than a few people in the crowd were drinking from beer bottles or holding small plastic cups with ice and amber liquid.
Dean stared at his chili. It was meaty and just a tad bit greasy, not that he was complaining. As a kid grown on restaurant food, he was sure he’d had enough different types of food to not embarrass himself. He just never judged it before.
“Gross!” Sam made a face and took a sip of his vegan gluten-free iced tea or something. “Why are you so gross all the time?”
Dean prepared himself by putting a harmless smile on, but she didn’t look like a concerned mom. She looked like a furious one, and it was all for Dean.
“Well, one person got it loud and clear.” Benny glanced over his shoulder and Dean followed his gaze.
The whole back of his neck felt hot, looked like the layman did get all shy and missish before a priest. Dean deserved to be ridiculed.
They went through eleven different chilis, which made it even more insulting when Charlie stood up with the counted scorecards to announce the winner. “We actually have a consensus on which chili is the Judges’ Favorite and the Town Favorite! It’s number three, Miss Dovie Grayson’s Rainbow Rocket chili!” Charlie happily read off and everybody cheered and had a great ol’ time.
“Perfect.” Dean grinned and checked out Edith’s cookies again. He should have mentioned how much he liked pie several more times if she was that good. He was always searching for the perfect pie.
And when they weren’t talking? Dean was looking forward to hearing his little flip phone ring again.
Huh. It sounded like Greek, or Latin as it were, to him. Dean set aside the pipes and shifted out from under the sink, very careful not to brain himself again. He wiped his sweaty forehead and stretched. “Well hey, if you ever want to go to the ‘cinema’, I’ll for your ticket, okay?”
It was silent. If Castiel couldn’t hear the soft, measured breaths from the holes in the panel between them, he would have thought he was alone.
Dean looked at his scorecard finally. Yep, it did have five categories, Color, Aroma, Consistency, Taste, and Aftertaste. Great. This was like school. He sighed and made a note at the top reading ‘1 thru 10’.
Thoughts were hard. Everything was hard. Literally, because he was sure that wasn’t a gun digging into his hip.
Dean and Cas are stuck at dinner together. Stuck is really a strong word for what's going on though. Bonus points to anyone who knows what the chapter name is from! :D
Dean spoke low and conversational, certain words slightly garbled as his tongue and teeth brushed around the tips of Castiel’s fingers.
She gave him a look to rival his brother’s best bitchface. Her chest expanded like a fluffed up bird, but then she deflated with a desolation.
I know, I'm trying for every two days! D: I hope I can make up for it ^.~ Thanks so much for all the reviews last chapter, I absolutely heart you guys! I'm so glad it's being enjoyed!
“I had a pleasant evening, Sam, thank you. Good night Dean.” He looked in the backseat with his amazingly blue eyes, catching Dean’s attention for a long moment.
Gus threw him an amused glance over his shoulder. “I can’t say I do, but if you’re looking for a date we have some nice homegrown boys.”
Though he couldn’t move his arms, or his legs, Cas leaned his head forward to bump softly against Dean’s as he moved. “Then why aren’t you hurting me?”
Those blue eyes dropped to the knife as Dean back up, the angel’s fingers curling over the handle and pulling it out. The knife fell with a clatter.
“Really? Those did have the best burgers, I’ll admit. Fine, I won’t shove him under the table at any point screaming about the machine revolution. I guess.”
“He already spends so much time with a variety of organizations, he’s a good man. He wants to help children and makes lots of lives better.” Dean kinda liked them, but he also wanted them to know what kind of man they were missing out on.
. Not when it might hurt someone nice.” He couldn’t help but glance at Cas's parted lips again, something in his stomach swooping and leaving him breathless. This was about the time he looked away. He had to stop eye-fucking the guy.
Even though he had to leave Cas, and couldn’t quite work up the nerve to get some before he left, the idea boiled in the back of his head.
He watched as Cas opened his mouth and pushed it into the V he already made in the burger with his silverware. His jaw moved as he bit down, lashes fluttering closed. With the clear and colored juices smudged against his chin, Dean had to admit that was lewd and suggestive all at once.
Both waited until a shiny white Lexus passed by to the huge parking lot across the street before sighing in relief.
“Oh! I know who you’re talking about! Oh man..” he looks off in a way Dean didn’t like at all. “So brilliant...I know all the engineers are good, but that Seraphim was awe inspiring. That was
Dean climbed out of the car in front of the closed shop, noticing the bright green papers already all in place. Damn that woman worked fast. What did she have at her disposal, a veritable army of flyer-placing elves?
Dean gently grabbed both sides of his face and kissed Cas deeply. He didn’t care about the buzz of voices around him or the gasps or ahhs. He only cared that Cas was responding in kind. Dean licked his lips and nuzzled the other man’s mouth, the scratchy feel sending a funny thrill through him.
The bright yellow was easy to see and he placed the flyers on steps and wedged at the opening of fences whenever someone didn’t answer the door. The fourth house, however, flew open the second his knuckles grazed the wood. Two young women opened the door, both dark haired beauties who undoubtedly were the belles of the town. They certainly held themselves in a way to suggest put-upon sophistication.
The tiny house he pulled up in front of was somehow even more gentrified than his boarding lady’s. A handcarved sign reading ‘
As an added precaution, Dean made sure to get all his blasphemy out long before he ever reached the Kansas border.
A leggy blonde turned, the laughter on her face freezing once she saw him. And her hand was on some guy’s arm.
“Yeah, but don’t be gentle.” He leaned forward to really flash the classic Winchester charm her way. Not out of interest, but you just did that with pretty girls.
In fact, Charlie hadn’t wanted to become a nurse at all. She wanted to go into computers. Being a nurse was a fulfilling job though, and one of the only choices that Stella accepted.
Feel free to check out 'Confession' in progress. It has another Priest Cas! But a very different Dean :D
Heck, maybe he'd give her a little attention if he had time. If he didn't see anything better that was. Cracking another beer, he took a big swig and looked for the message button.
“No time!” Dean turned and went the way he saw the coordinator taking the teams. He headed toward huge octagon with sturdy metal walls on the bottom and a chain link fence on the top.
Dean finally has to do some Minister work. It doesn't go badly. And he really, really can't resist Cas.
Dean choked a bit. Not because he had no idea people thought that, everybody thought that. Still strange to be asked it straight-out, no pun intended. “I do have an eye for the, uh, men, yes.”
The first thing Dean had done that morning was remember everything that happened the night before and considered crawling in a hole and dying. There were things he could blame on the alcohol, but a man absolutely did not touch his bro’s...crush. That was thoroughly off-limits.
As if drawn, his gaze went down to the Father watching him. He was late twenties at best, couldn't be any older than Dean himself. His dark hair looked rumpled as if someone had a great old time running their fingers through it.
“Okay, but what happens when you’re in the situation? Close your eyes.” Dean stopped walking and turned to Cas, grabbing his shoulders lightly, trying to avoid wrinkling that robe thing.
Dean should kick Sam’s butt for treating a patient dude like that. That was rare to find anyone nice, Dean knew for damn sure that he’d have fled by now to find someone more attentive.
“Good?” Castiel spat, glaring at him. “Why is it good that I am not interested in Sam when you have already rejected me? Are you trying to control me again?”
“Maybe the water wasn’t warm enough!” He said with glee as he went to grab the bucket. Sam just sighed and followed him.
It took Dean a moment to process what Castiel meant, but once he did, he saw red. He was so angry he didn’t think for a second about what he was saying. “Are you saying that it’s actually possible?! But
Dean was foolish to think he could keep this from Bobby forever. He just knew that Bobby wouldn’t put up with his bullshit. He took a deep breath to calm his nerves. “We tried your suggestion. Kissing him like he’s freaking Sleeping Beauty. And well,” he gulped, “it worked. I kissed him, and he woke up.”
Castiel smiled. "I first met Dean when I pulled him out of Hell. I had never seen a human soul so bright or stunning before, and have never since. I quickly grew fond of him, and tried to warn him about the apocalypse, but Heaven rewired me. Even after the rewiring, his heartfelt plea for humanity convinced me to fight on his side. Even though we were too late, we kept fighting together." Castiel took a second to feel the grip of the tendrils around him, and found they had already slackened somewhat.
Sam rolled his eyes, not rising to the bait. “I’m just saying, we should be trying everything we can to wake him up, or he might be like this forever.”
"You heard Jack, he’s hands off now. And he never said he got rid of monsters. So the world still needs us," Sam explained, while Eileen nodded in agreement.
Sam, who was well-versed in reading Dean’s mood shifts, noticed something was wrong right away. “Well uh, that’s certainly interesting, Cas,” he said delicately, “but that’s not really important, is it? What matters is the here and now. Dean was able to wake you up right away, so…” Sam trailed off.
Jack shook his head. "I agree with you. He shouldn’t be in the Empty. But I, personally, cannot intervene. It is however possible for you to rescue him."
, and paused. That would start a conversation over text. That was definitely not what he wanted. He wanted to see him face-to-face.
He couldn’t get it out of his mind. The warmth of Castiel’s body against his. Staring into his eyes, on the verge of a kiss, He kept wondering, what would have happened if they had kissed? In the dead of night, he couldn’t hide from the truth: he had wanted it to happen. He… wanted Castiel. Maybe, deep down, even loved him.
This was it. She was definitely interested. Now he just needed to close the deal. Yet… he looked at Casey again, and for a moment he only saw Castiel. His mind started to run with it. What would happen if he were to go to a bar with Castiel? Would their conversation only be a prelude for sex and nothing more, like this, or would they just drink some beers together while Dean painstakingly explained whatever sport was playing on the bar TV…?
Dean was weirdly satisfied by that answer. At least Sam and Castiel weren’t carrying on a secret friendship behind his back. “No, I haven’t,” he grunted.
Sam was the one to let out a laugh. "I know, and yet, I don’t know. It just seems surreal. I thought I lost her for good."
Sam rolled his eyes. “Shut up, Dean, I’m serious.” He sat up from the bed and stepped away, giving Dean ample room to take his place. Dean gulped but walked over anyway. He could kiss him and get it out of the way, and then Sam could continue kissing Castiel until he woke up and they could live nerdily ever after.
Dean was overwhelmed. They definitely butted heads sometimes, but he wouldn’t have it any other way. Wouldn’t want Castiel any other way but exactly how he is.
The Empty sighed. "Fine, you utterly pathetic human-loving filth, you’ve won. I had better never see your face again." All the other tendrils holding Castiel in place vanished, causing Castiel to collapse onto the ground. The Empty then vanished as well.
“Another angel? Like... like Gabriel? Aw hell no, Bobby, I don’t want to deal with that douchenozzle again.”
Dean sighed. "Fine, but you might as well just keep the robe on. I have another one I can use." Dean stepped away to don the robe.
The mention of Jack made Dean see red. "He also said that he wasn’t gonna help us with Cas! But sure, let’s just find a case, and leave him to rot in there!"
Dean couldn’t breathe. He should be saying something pithy right now, but how could he, with that bomb dropped on him? “How... how can you say that, Cas? You can’t mean that. You’ve
The words and the gaze made Dean feel a little hot under his collar for some reason. He cleared his throat and changed the subject.
Dean went silent again, still staring with wide eyes, which were starting to grow wet. Castiel became alarmed. "Dean, are you crying? What’s wrong?"
Yet somehow it was enough to capture Dean’s attention. He looked up and his eyes widened. "Cas!" he yelled, jumping out of his seat and running toward him. He stopped right in front of Castiel, leaving very little room in between. "Cas, is that really you?"
Four days later, Castiel was still lying motionless on the bed. Before, Castiel had just looked asleep, but now all Dean saw when he looked at him was death. He knew he wasn’t dead, but Castiel was supposed to be up and staring at him, getting all into his personal space, and growling at him. He wasn’t supposed to be motionless on a bed. The more time passed, the more he couldn’t handle it, so he called Bobby. “Got any news?”
Dean showered and quickly ate some cereal before heading to the war room. When Eileen looked up from her laptop to see Dean, she signed good morning, which Dean returned. "So what’s going on?"
He took a deep breath. “Cas, you got your ears on?” He paused, still feeling a little hesitant. “I.. I was hoping we could talk. Face to face. Please, it’s important. I’m at Bobby’s place, on Baby.”
Dean and Sam reached the motel that Eileen was currently staying at several hours later. As time passed, Sam grew more agitated, bouncing his leg and wringing his hands. At one point, Dean caught him and wanted to laugh. Instead, he asked, "What’s wrong? We know she’s alive. Everything’s fine." Well, not
Suddenly, Castiel’s eyes opened wide, looking directly into Dean’s. “Holy shit,” breathed Dean, his heart beating like crazy.
When Sam stepped away, Castiel turned his attention to Eileen. Eileen signed "welcome back" and Castiel also responded in sign, saying "thank you." At least Castiel still remembered some ASL, but it remained to be seen if he could carry a whole conversation in it, like he could’ve back as an angel. Eileen then hugged him as well.
Castiel thought that he was giving up his life forever when he went to the Empty to save Dean. He never could’ve imagined that one last sacrifice becoming the beginning of a whole new life with Dean. For as long as he could help it, he would never leave his side ever again.
“Angels can be affected by spells? Well, I’ll be,” Bobby said gruffly. “He’s just unconscious? Nothing else wrong with him?”
"Dean. When I got here, I immediately fell asleep. I’ve been asleep this entire time. This is my first time awake in the Empty. If you hadn’t awakened me, I would’ve never had the opportunity to do this. So thank you, Dean, for not giving up on me."
Dean was sitting on one of the motel beds, TV blaring at nearly full blast. Sam yelled over the noise, “Would you turn that down? I’m trying to find a new case!”
Notably, Dean and Castiel were left alone in the kitchen while they cooked. Castiel did wonder where Sam and Eileen were, but he was enjoying this stolen time with Dean too much to complain. They didn’t breach the topic of Castiel’s love confession or Dean’s response; instead, Dean caught him up on everything that happened in between instructions.
The conviction in his voice tied Dean’s stomach into knots. He didn’t deserve it. He wasn’t good enough for Castiel. It must’ve been some kind of mistake that he was his true love. His hand fell from Castiel’s shoulder as he looked away briefly to compose himself. He didn’t want to ruin this, so when he turned back to Castiel, he had a forced smile. “Whatever you say, Cas. We need to start actually watching the show, you superfan.”
let that happen. “No, I’m staying. Everything you tell Sam, you tell me.” Sam shot him a weird look, but Dean was too focused on staring Castiel down.
It had been years since all of that happened, and all that time, Dean had allowed him to believe that he didn’t love him. Not platonically or brotherly—he had already told him as much—but romantically. That could no longer stand.
Sam put his hands up in a placating gesture. “Nothing, Dean. I just think it’s more likely that he’d respond to someone he knows. Like...,” he gulped, “Like us.”
Dean and Castiel looked at each other, communicating without words: should we tell them? Dean hesitated, then nodded. In for a penny, in for a pound. They didn’t say a word, opting instead to hold hands.
The next two weeks follow the same pattern for Dean: wake up with a hangover, spend the whole day reading with only short breaks for food, then drink until passing out. As each day wore on, Dean drank more and more, both from developing a higher tolerance to the alcohol and from the growing sense of dread that they were never going to find anything.
This was nothing like their first kiss when Castiel was comatose. No, this time Castiel was a very active participant, opening his mouth and tangling his tongue with Dean’s. They wrapped their arms around each other, pulling their bodies flush against each other. Dean’s hand dove into Castiel’s hair to cup the back of his head, whereas Castiel’s hands roamed all around Dean’s back.
Dean flinched. "You… you knew of his deal? Why didn’t you say anything?" Everything about his last moment with Cas came flooding back to him, as it had nearly constantly since he watched Cas disappear in black goo and he started to choke up.
Castiel sighed. Had Dean really not understood him at all? It would be so easy now, to backtrack, to save himself the pain and suffering of rejection, but he couldn’t lie to Dean. Not about this. "Yes, Dean. I’m in love with you."
Instead, he found himself wanting to spend more and more time with Castiel. Maybe that way he could figure out via osmosis, and then he could stop worrying about it. It wouldn’t hurt, right?
Things appeared to go back to normal after their conversation. No one brought up the topic of the curse or true love. It was almost as if it never happened.
Dean wasn’t stupid, he knew what Sam was implying. He just wasn’t in the mood to try to tackle that problem at the moment. He took a swig from his beer and turned on the motel TV. He could worry about it later. Or never.
It was one thing to talk to Bobby about telling him or think about telling him. Having him standing before him now, looking fond but curious, made his throat close up. “Hey, Cas,” he croaked.
The next morning, Dean and Castiel headed to the kitchen for coffee. To their surprise, Bobby and Sam were already there, making bacon and eggs. They also looked surprised to see Castiel.
Dean suddenly felt rage flowing through him at the mention of Castiel. He had been so relieved that Chuck was dealt with and that everyone came back, he almost forgot the most important thing of all. "But what about Cas, huh? You resurrected every last person on Earth, surely you can bring Cas back! After everything he’s done for you, he’s earned it!”
Dean grimaced. “Thanks, Bobby,” he said sardonically. To be fair, he wasn’t sure he had handled any of this particularly well. “What I meant is that I think we almost kissed again the other day,” he paused, not wanting to say this even as it was coming out of his mouth, “And I think… I think I wanted it.” His stomach immediately clenched. Now it was out in the world instead of just in his own mind. He could no longer deny it.
“I don’t know, girly fairytales are your division Sam, not mine.” He aimed for dismissive but only hit disturbed, as images kept flashing in his mind--Sam, as Castiel’s True Love, getting married and having weird angel babies. The thought made him sick.
Dean beamed at him. “Hey, you made it! Come sit down with me.” He scooted over to the other side of the bed and then patted the empty space he left behind. He belatedly realized he normally didn’t do that. Castiel could see the screen just fine from the other bed.
Suddenly, the vision of a blood covered Dean vanished. Castiel gained awareness of himself and remembered that the Empty took him. But why had he woken up? Had the Empty finally decided to torture him in a more direct way?
The next day, the three of them headed back to the bunker. Dean was all alone in the Impala, since Eileen was following him in her car, and Sam decided to go with her instead of him. Dean had grabbed one of his cassettes and played it during the entire trip on the highest possible volume to drown out his own thoughts.
In the middle of the meal, Castiel suddenly placed his right hand on Dean’s thigh under the table. Dean startled at first, but then carefully covered Castiel’s hand with his left hand. They shared a private look that promised more to come later.
Castiel’s expression turned sad, and he tilted his head. “You do deserve to be loved, Dean. But if that is what you wish...,” he trailed off and stepped back. He looked away. “I should return to my search.” He fidgeted awkwardly--such a painfully human gesture, and it just reminded him of minutes earlier, when Castiel was out cold to the world.
Dean looked away so Castiel couldn’t see his face, which had gone completely red. “It’s the boots,” he mumbled, barely audible.
They didn’t speak a word as they made their way to Dean’s bedroom. Once they were both inside, Dean closed the door and locked it. He then turned around and leaned against the door, letting out a sigh, before making eye contact with Castiel, who was simply standing in the middle of the room, in front of the bed.
Castiel looked at Dean and frowned in confusion. “Multiple people in the course of a person’s life have the potential to become their true love. Who that person turns out to be is mostly a result of circumstance. If events had played out differently, it might not have been you who woke me up.” Castiel didn’t spell it outright, but the meaning is clear.
They didn’t speak again until they arrived at the motel. It was perfectly average, like many of the hundreds if not thousands of motels they had stayed in over the years. But Sam definitely finally perked up, jumping out of the car immediately after the car was parked. Dean followed behind a little more slowly. He didn’t want to interrupt their first moment together.
Bobby started laughing. “Straight out of a fairytale, you two. You’re his Prince Charming! When’s the wedding?”
It was a week after that incident—a week in which nothing else changed—that Sam suddenly exclaimed "I found something!"
Dean’s mind blanked out for a moment at the thought of kissing Castiel. But then he realized Sam also included himself, and he couldn’t miss that opportunity. “Aww, Sammy, is this a confession? Do you looove him?” He really, really hoped that he was wrong.
Their latest case was near Sioux Falls so naturally, they had to take a break from the motel life to drop in on Bobby for a few days. It should have been easier to fall asleep on a good bed, but Dean still found himself tossing and turning.
Dean stomped toward him. "What a stupid cop-out, you son of a—," Sam pulled him away from Jack and Dean was shocked into silence, settling on a glare.
. Distressingly, Castiel wasn’t laughing it off (or whatever Castiel’s equivalent would have been)--no, he was tilting his head, looking thoughtful.
Bringing up Sam had also brought to surface all the toxic thoughts Dean had had lately in regards to Sam and Castiel’s relationship. This was why he suddenly lashed out. “But that’s what you’d really prefer, right? You might as well just go talk to him then since he’s apparently a potential true love! No need to waste time on me!”
Clearly, so did Sam, because he beat him to the punch. “Hey, wait, Cas, stay, I have something to ask you anyway.” He said the last sentence hesitantly, which made Dean instantly worried about what Sam had in mind.
This was yet another sleepy little middle American town, so there weren’t many bars around. But one was all he needed. Dean flashed his trademark charming grin in the rearview mirror as a warm-up before walking inside.
They entered the bunker together, both Sam and Dean helping Eileen with her things, as it had been quickly decided that Eileen was going to move in. They took everything straight to Sam’s room and helped her unpack. Dean was once again glad that his own room was a good distance from Sam’s; there were just some things he didn’t want to hear about his brother.
Bobby’s words weighing heavily on his heart, he knew what he needed to do. An urge to grab a beer to boost his courage nearly overcame him, but he forced himself to relax. Castiel deserved to hear this when he was sober.
When he approached Castiel’s room, he had to stop and take a deep breath. He hadn’t looked inside once since Castiel was taken. But then he opened the door. What greeted him was a truly sterile, impersonal environment. It was like Castiel never lived there at all. He swallowed down the lump in his throat and began searching through his drawers.
Castiel sat up and looked around to be sure that the Empty was gone, then he watched in wonder as the rest of his grace flowed away from him. It almost hurt to look at, such bright light contrasting with the sea of darkness. At first, it was a continuous stream, until it finally ended. As the grace moved further away from him, Castiel looked down to see his body flickering, then he was conscious no more.
“But you want to be, and it’s scaring the pants off you, am I right?” Dean just stared at him, which Bobby took as a “yes”. “You forgot I practically raised you, you idjit. Of course I know when you like someone. So what, you’re having gay panic? Well get over it, princess, because I can tell that angel of yours is good for you.”
Dean felt Bobby’s words like a physical blow. They cut right to the heart of the matter, and worst of all, he was right. “Fuck, Bobby,” he breathed. “I don’t know how to do this.”
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean mumbled. He looked back to Castiel lying on the bed. Even with not exactly encouraging news, the phone call eased some of his anxiety, so Dean didn’t see death in Castiel’s face. His face looked peaceful, a look he had never seen on his face before. It... suited him. If you looked past the fact that he was an angel, a dude angel at that, who shouldn’t be sleeping, he was almost... beautiful.
She already remembered his name, which was a good sign. But… Casey, really? That was so similar to “Cas”. Just what exactly were the odds of that? She even had a nerdy job! He was a little disconcerted, but he once again shoved the feelings to the back of his mind.
