John brushed his thumb against his gun to remind himself that it was available if needed, and began to walk around the left hand side of the building. Sherlock took the right, and upon seeing that there was no one hiding behind the barn, they returned to the front.
For the second time in as many minutes, John noticed Greg glancing at his vibrating phone. He pointed at it questioningly.
“And I was second,” Sebastian repeated. “Not all vampires care to follow the Van Helsings, John. Neither do all humans, for that matter.” At this, Sebastian readied his fist and launched it directly at John, landing on his cheek and immediately breaking his orbital bone. The next few hits landed just as efficiently, bringing John to his knees. His gun fell, forgotten, into the sand beside him. Sebastian returned to loading up his Panther with the help of several vampires who seemed willing to obey him.
Sherlock was caught off guard. Did he still have -? No, he was fine. “Yes, of course.” Sherlock said, as his scattered thoughts attempted to come together into their usual uniformity.
The vampires immediately looked up, and the slight release of their hands allowed John to pull the dagger from his back pocket again and slash an opening in front of him. He turned and grinned.
“That sounds about right,” John said, feeling slightly more optimistic. “I guess we’re going to Scotland.”
Moving in the dim light of his bedside lamp, John laid out the map of London on his sparse desk and, with a red pen, marked down locations, some that were crime scenes, and some that were new.  When he finished, he crossed his arms and looked down at it.
“In my other pants, sorry,” John shouted back, as he swung and missed the vampire in front of him, taking a few steps around it.
“Correct,” Sherlock said. “Like I said, this map has been altered. But I’m quite certain it was the original, and the vault that was filled in likely still exists.”
"Yes," Mycroft answered stiffly. “I wasn't aware you were home. Hello, Inspector.” He nodded at the man, who had made his way to an armchair, and wondered if there was a way to warn the doctor.
After what seemed like five minutes, the door swung in. A tall man stood before them, and didn't say a word.
Closing the laptop, he stood. John offered a “sorry,” then stood as well, reaching for his clothes over the back of the desk chair.
“Stop,” John said, commanding the vampire before him to cease moving as he raised a hand. “Who created you? Who are you?”
Speaking only in gasps as he tried to free himself from Mycroft's grip, he replied, “How long do you really think you'll be able to hide this?”
Almost hungrily, Moriarty paced among the men and women. “Well done,” he said excitably. “I’ll need to borrow some of these guys.”
“I'm getting there,” John assured him. “As legend has it, Van Helsing came from a family that hunted the very first vampire. Thousands of years of years of contact with the undead, rewriting the DNA of Abraham's ancestors, adapting them to the task of hunting vampires. The surviving four families involved in the death of Dracula changed their names, as a way to gain back some level of anonymity, and let them continue to hunt the undead;  my family was among them. We've been using Watson for a few generations now, since it attracts less attention, but for years before that it was something else.”
She looked through the pictures; most were of bodies, none particularly remarkable, but a few with the telltale signs of a vampire attack.
With a sharp snap, the door flew open and John walked towards the main control panel overlooking the courtyard. It had been a longshot, but John was pleased to see that the control panel was still functional - it seemed, for this section of the emergency systems, some part of the generator was still working. Acting quickly, John pressed an inconspicuous red button near the far right side of the board and distantly, he could hear sirens across the base sounding. If anyone was missing the fun, as he had been, they were awake now.
“I’ve read a lot of more-extensive, less-believable theories. It seems to fit,” John said, unconcerned. “It’s meant to be a how-to guide for all sorts of things: immortality, shapeshifting, raising graveyards of the recently dead. That general idea.”
John looked away, trying to keep his temper under control, at the figures in the shadows. He knew who they were, in spite of never having met them. He made eye contact with Jonathan. “You’ve recruited Old Ones. Vampires who never integrated with society. You know you’re at opposite purposes, don’t you?”
mystery, and his alone to figure out. It didn't help that John felt a growing sense of guilt about knowing who the murderer was, although whenever that thought came into his mind, he pushed it away. He hoped that the longer he ignored what he had seen the night prior the less real it would become.
For a moment, John thought he saw Mary - human, as he usually remembered her, and smiling - standing in the corner of the room. She smiled softly at him, neither condemning him or encouraging his actions either way. Vision clouded by tears, John looked down at Sebastian, whose teeth were bared in the characteristic expression of any trapped animal. For a moment, he saw Sebastian as he was when they first met. Young men, fast friends. John’s constant companion before he ever met Sherlock. He remembered every battle they fought and won, and he remembered the moment Sebastian betrayed him.
“And all this is without even mentioning your right breast pocket, which is clearly holding papers.”Sherlock reached quickly to the vampire's jacket pocket and pulled out a handful of crumpled pieces of thoroughly marked up notebook paper. “Dull. You're just giving yourself away.”
“It seems like every other one I've had the misfortune of coming to,” Sherlock replied, leaning in closer to hear John. “No sports at this hour, though, so overall it may be winning.”
hang out. I feel like we may get more information about the recent deaths if we go directly to the people who know what's causing them.”
“I’m in no mood to do that again, so,” John said, and pulled two flasks out of a hidden pocket in his jacket.
“Not a clue,” he said, crouching down beside the body and pressing down on its chest gently. The grey skin sagged and then collapsed inward. John removed his hand. “Not a vampire, not a human.”
Powered by the blood he had so recently drank, John bared his fangs and stood, preparing to lunge at Sebastian again, when a young vampire pulled him backwards into the fray. By the time he was able to get out of the tumble of humans and vampires, he saw Westenra was engaged in combat with Moran. John hissed, and began to stalk across the vault once more, when he was stopped.
“The other deaths?” he said, puzzled. “I'm not responsible for them. I don't know who killed them, but I'm afraid I'm not at fault.”
“I don’t see a park,” he said, reading the signs on the shops across the road, which all seemed to indicate that they were closed for business, or for sale. “Anything green, really.”
John himself knew where Sherlock was, but he didn't intend to disturb him or demand he come inside. He felt guilty enough about the burden he had put on his friend, but hadn't yet managed to string together the right set of words that would fully express what he was thinking. He didn't even know if Sherlock
The vampire that was attacking him was a young man in jeans and a t-shirt, dirtied from his underground slumber.
John looked at him doubtfully. “I’m glad my complete inability to label anything correctly has come in handy. You know, we don’t know that Sebastian’s involved here at all.”
“Why the hell was I just attacked by four newborn vampires and their caretaker?” He began walking forward, picking up his knives and glancing from left to right while he gestured for the men to follow him,  as he continued speaking. “And you refer anything like that to me. That was the agreement. I'm sure there's someone in the network who knows what's going on.” He paused as the person on the other line spoke, and began to cross the quiet street. “When you know, call me back. I'll be over tomorrow.” He ended the call and put the phone back in his pocket, turning his wrist gingerly and grimacing as he looked down at it.
With the knife in his left hand, Harker cut into his right-hand palm, watching the blood pool. Walking into the sea of graves, he extended his arm, and turned his cupped hand over. He spoke a few words quietly in an ancient language, and the echo in the chamber magnified his voice. “Rise.”
“Book of the Undead,” John said, equally indifferent. “Virtually no one has seen it, much less tried to read it. Most vampires sincerely believe it was written in the hand of Dracula.”
“Yep,” John answered glibly, then clapped Greg on the shoulder as he made his way to the door. “Welcome to the club.”
“Traffic accident on the road, couldn't get to the Chinese place you like,” John said. “And on my way home I ran into Sarah. It was awkward.” He hoped that explained his behaviour.
John knew he could fight her, attempt to secure her in the midst of the chaos that reigned on the ground below, but he had done this too long. He knew the power a maker had over his progeny and he knew she had reached the only valid conclusion for this problem. This part of John’s memory, the bargaining, the pleading, and the constant refrain of “no, god no,” was scattered and filled with blank gaps; however, the end of it was blindingly clear, permanently carved into his mind. This part of his life, the part of his life where he felt content in his marriage and career, ended with a gun pointed at Mary, her body falling from the edge of the building and landing, unnoticed, in the fray below. Fangs bared, John stood. He was certain, more than anything else at that moment, that when he grieved, it would last years and be truly terrible to behold. He felt certain that the man who walked onto that rooftop, and the man who would leave, were now irreconcilably different people. For the time being, however, he had business to take care of, and he wouldn’t cease until his hands were drenched in blood.
John glanced at him, then ran a hand over his mouth. “Right then,” he said. “Tonight. Fuck, Mycroft couldn’t have sent us a little more information. What’s tonight? Whatever all this has been leading to, obviously, but what?”
She wasn’t quite sure when she would see John and Sherlock again. The vampires she and Greg had met were polite – very informative, and very to speak with John. However, as soon as they had reassured the humans that they weren’t a threat, Molly and Greg were quickly shuttled off in separate directions – Molly to the heart of their information centre, and Greg back to Baker Street. She was still a bit startled by how abruptly everything had begun to unfold, and tried to reflect on her last few hours in order to settle herself.
John smiled for a moment at Sherlock's chuckles, then added, “Oh, I got that vampire in the morgue sorted out.”Sherlock gave him a strange look. “Speaking about... pleasant surprises.” He paused. “That was not my best segue.”
“Right, sounds good,” John said, though the prospect of another wet and bloody corpse was about as far from 'good' as he could imagine. At least Sherlock would be excited, which would terrify Donovan and make his morning a bit more humorous.
Sherlock pulled out a photograph that had come loose from the pile. Taken from above, it was a group photo of John and a dozen other men and women loosely assembled together in the forest. In the background, a farmhouse glowed in the summer light. Some of the group had their arms hung around each other’s shoulders companionably, while John himself was laughing with a tall blond man - Sebastian, Sherlock presumed. John’s loose scrawl on the back of the photo listed Calimani, 2002 by way of a caption. Sherlock heard John stepping back into the room, and immediately slipped the photograph back into the folder, trying to appear casual as he walked over to bed.
John paused, and glanced at Sherlock. Overall, they were unharmed, though they were a bit dirty. “Fairly quickly, why?”
“It’s good to see you, Doctor,” the woman said with a slight Dutch accent. She did not tolerate hugs from very many people, but made an exception for John, whose fondness for her seemed to be contagious.
John looked at Jane, then to the inspector. “As far as the army's concerned. They declared me dead after I was involved in a certain... encounter.” He had chosen the word carefully, and still it tasted wrong in his mouth. “I never corrected them. I moved, started using 'Watson' again, and got on with my life. It seemed safer for the rest of my unit that way.”
Greg stared absently at the upholstery of his seat until he saw Mycroft shift around. Their eyes met and Greg offered a smile and a nod. Mycroft, whose eyes were focused on Greg but didn’t really seem to be
She looked back at him, her smile fixed on her face. Without raising his voice, she knew he had issued a challenge.
Twenty minutes, one hailed taxi, and an uncomfortably close ride later, the four men – one of whom was at a total loss about what they were looking for, and another under the mistaken belief that he wasn't – were dropped off by the water and began their walk along the road. Against John's unexplainable protests, Lestrade had alerted his own team about his whereabouts, but left out any details about what he was investigating. Sherlock focused his flashlight on the beach, but seeing nothing, continued to walk with the group.
“Ah,” John said, nodding. “Yeah, well. Consider this my area of expertise.”He walked back towards the bar, where Mycroft couldn't see him, and returned with a bottle of water.
Sherlock nodded. “Certainly. It feels as though we’re coming towards a conclusion, but the particulars aren’t there yet. Tomorrow, I’d like to go walking across the city.”
He watched as the vampire fought against his restraints, and felt a cold fear creep down his spine. By any standard, undead or living, the vampire before him was far too enraged, far too uncontrollable. It felt, in a way that John could only sense at his core, unnatural. It was something he had never seen before – not even in war.
“Yes, the case you mentioned. Clearing up that politician's scandal,” John answered without any seriousness.
“If I told you that, dear John, I'd have to kill you before we had a chance to catch up with one another,”he answered, an edge of malice in his voice. “Or, I could just kill your friends to impress upon you the importance of what I'm currently a part of.”
Greg looked up and down the street surreptitiously, then inserted the crowbar next to the curved iron door handle. “I’m a police officer,” he said quietly, reassuring himself before he broke into the closed vaults.
“Yeah, there is,” John said, smiling gently. “You find a partner – a human – and you drink from them. It doesn't have to be romantic, but I imagine you'd feel a whole hell of a lot more fulfilled coming home to someone who cares for you after whatever it is you
Distracted, he wrestled with the creature - a heavyset woman of about sixty, more muscular than John would expect - finding himself unable to pin the vampire down as she gained speed and confidence in her newly powerful body. Reluctantly, as he felt himself pushed onto his back, John pulled one of the thinner chains of silver and wrapped it around her neck, garroting her and allowing him to turn her over. Being so recently deceased, when John watched the consciousness leave her eyes, she didn’t dissolve or turn to ash - she simply looked human once more, freed from the hell of immortality under a cruel master.
“And the man who killed him took his crown,” Moriarty said, mockingly.  “He’s not one for advertising himself.”
Sherlock seemed pleased. “I tried to isolate the damage to the southeast corner of your room. All flash, nothing substantial – just enough to alert the Met.”
Slowly, he lifted a shovel up that had been left beside one of the graves. Harker had used it, he imagined, when he was burying his progeny. John considered that he could use one of the existing graves, but decided against it. Sherlock deserved his own, proper burial. John spent the last of his energy digging a long hole deep in the wet soil, considering Sherlock with every shovelful of dirt he threw to the side of the grave. Eventually, when he had no energy left to spare, John stepped out of the hole and walked to Sherlock’s lifeless body, cradling him once more as he carried him towards the grave, lifting him in carefully.
The intruders to the base seemed to be exclusively vampire. That was strange enough - most vampires were, to a fault, antisocial. They didn’t - wouldn’t - organize themselves into large groups for anything, much less battle. Not since Dracula held sway over the Carpathians, anyways. More worrying still, they seemed trained, and foreign; these were not just local vampires causing havoc. John wouldn’t have been surprised to learn he knew some of the attackers by name.
“Dracula. He said they could bring him back. Do you imagine he was serious?” Sherlock was not particularly frightened by the thought of hunting another vampire, but as he traced the back of his sharp, smooth teeth, he did admit to himself that he had a certain professional interest in the first of his kind.
Avoiding eye contact, the pair went to their separate tasks and started readying themselves to leave. John, still more on edge than usual, readied his gun and packed up the rest of his weapons. Glancing at himself in the mirror, he deemed himself more or less presentable – if perhaps a bit flushed – and exited the room.
Sherlock, who had remained soundless for the duration of time following the vampire attack and Mycroft hailing the cars, now spoke.
“Afraid so,” Moriarty said, practically humming with excitement. He turned on his heel to face Sebastian, and leaned back on the desk. “Such a pleasant surprise, having witnesses. And here Mycroft thought they were still in London.”
“Greg is having Anderson come by with a case for you. Apparently he’s annoyed you’re insisting on only meeting him after dark. Thinks it’s just another one of your quirks.” John put a hand behind his head and leaned back, amused.
John walked over to one of the crates and reached inside, pulling out his everyday gun and brushing off some of the dust that had gathered on it during transit. “How did the police here take things?”
“So, what I think I’m trying to get at, is yes - I do genuinely believe that every legend about that book is true. I believe Dracula wrote it so that one day he could be brought back. I also believe, more than anything else, that cracking it open and trying to use it to obtain power would bring a darkness into this world that could never be fully eradicated.” There was silence, and John attempted to bring the mood up a bit. “Anyways, I think that’s what Sebastian was looking for. It seemed to come up in conversation between us unusually frequently. He had a feeling it was being kept on the base, but was never able to find out where.”
“He’s a double agent,” Sherlock said, making the connection, genuinely pleased for the first time that morning. “Oh, that’s terrific.”
Mycroft and Lestrade waited at the door, which Sherlock reached before John, stepping in quickly and making his way to the stairs. Lestrade, who still kept an eye trained on the army doctor, entered next and followed Sherlock. Before John could enter, he felt a cold hand rest on his elbow, stopping him.
Glancing at each group of people, he analyzed faces and posture, before settling on a group in the corner. “There.”
Sherlock pulled out his phone and started typing. “Hm,” he said. “They pull up a park. That’s hardly helpful.”
“What are you doing?” John asked, horrified. He understood the wisdom in never meeting your heroes, but this was a betrayal he couldn’t have expected.
“It's always different. Always unique to the person, I've found.” Sherlock waited for him to continue. “You're hard to describe. Kind of like 221B. Not the tea, or Mrs. Hudson's biscuits, or anything like that. But, the smell of something in the kitchen having exploded, smoke and chemicals, the creak of the stairs - the way all that feels, that's how you taste; does that make sense?”
The pair surveyed the land before them, the hills leading up towards Arthur’s Seat. Five hours until sunset.
John shrugged. “Undead Corps has a different structure. Converting to regular army rankings would shift me up a bit.”
“Hm.” Lestrade was silent. After a moment, he spoke again. “You seem to be accepting all of this a lot faster than me.”
“The key to these murders isn’t in Romania, Charles,” John said, growing firmer in his convictions. “I would know if it was.”
“And so far, the only one. Unless you would prefer to wait for something to happen to us, passive players in whatever we're now a part of.”
“I’m not quite sure where to start,” John said, still caught of guard. He waited a moment, eyes lingering on his notepad, before starting to speak.
Once Charles was assured that she had settled in to the room comfortably, he left her. His directions were simple, requesting that she stay in the library and remain on call for the rest of them. She did not attempt to protest this, knowing well enough that her strength lay in gathering information, not in killing vampires. The more she thought about it, the more she was grateful she had been given an easy way out, a chance to be helpful but not at risk.
Some part of him knew that he was supposed to lead his team in protecting the base, rather than meet with his wife, but a feeling of unease continued to gnaw at him. Protecting the base and seeing why Mary had returned now, in the middle of a war, seemed to be two sides of the same coin. Running up the stairs towards the rooftop passed in a blur, and very shortly he was heaving himself through the heavy door to the outdoors. From above the crowds below, the night almost seemed pleasant. The skies in the desert were spectacular even on an ordinary night, but it was especially breathtaking without the light pollution that usually emanated from the camp. Mary’s pale body seemed to glow with starlight.
“Oh,” John said, pondering his answer. “It was fine, I guess. Fine. I mean, you tasted nice,” he said. Noting Sherlock's smirk, his eyes widened as he repeated the words he had said back to himself. “That... may not be something I ever thought I'd have to say.”John flushed; partially from embarrassment, partially from the feeling of strength that was flooding him. Fresh blood was not something he indulged in often, and his body didn't protest it.
“My mother’s there, Sherlock,” John said abruptly, stopping as he looked down at Sherlock. He was angry with no one in particular, but prickly nonetheless. “When George said everyone was in Romania, he meant
Molly looked at John, who was glancing around the room, wondering if anything else was going to jump out at them. “A vampire?”
In seconds, John found himself pushed against the wall, pinned with Mycroft's forearm against his throat and his nails digging into one of his arms. “Do not dare to even think about telling my brother.” He pushed forward, seething as he stared down at John's face a breath away. His fangs came out and the edges of his lips raised enough to make them visible.
Finally, John pressed his luck too far, and with supernatural speed Moriarty moved forward and grabbed John’s neck between one of his hands like a vice. Sebastian trained his rifle on Sherlock, ensuring John wouldn’t fight back.
“You still think I can't see you when you come in through that door,” the detective stated, and if John had had the strength, his head would have snapped to the left to look at him. As it was, he turned until one of his eyes was visible, and looked at the other man. Sherlock had crept to him quietly while he hadn't been looking, and was sitting with his back against the coffee table, leaning towards John.
“Every story has some truth to it,” John said, shrugging. “Some more than others. The story was published by a hunter with the right connections.”
A bit off-kilter, she replied, “I’m afraid I’m not certain - they closed down for repairs last fall, and their reopening keeps getting pushed ahead. New custodianship, I heard.”
John looked away from the men staring at him and stepped over one of the bodies by his feet as he pulled out his phone, pressing a few numbers.
Obediently, Sherlock sat on the edge and waited for John manoeuvre himself beside him, his body twisted to face Sherlock. Sherlock exposed his neck once more, his hands lightly balled on his legs, but growing more tense by the moment.
John raised a finger. “That,” he whispered. Sherlock could now hear it too. In the distance, coming towards the door they had left open, was the scraping noise of a single, sharp point dragging along the steel panels of the hallway. A fingernail.
The blood in Mycroft's veins – John's blood – left his face and he appeared even more pale than usual. “I'm sorry, I didn't know.”
“Agreed,” Greg said. Molly gave the next address, and they continued on. Much to Greg’s disappointment, the following three locations were equally disappointing. Two had buildings on them, but they were unguarded and appeared to house only the ground. The plot of land that didn’t have a structure on it seemed promising, but wound up being just as pointless as the others.
John opened his mouth, then closed it. "We didn't fall asleep that way - you sleepwalk. Check your map.”
The group’s thoughts were interrupted by a loud ringtone, and Greg nearly jumped as his coat pocket began to vibrate.
“No,” Sherlock said, his eyes going dark as he snapped at Lestrade and stared him down. “Do not finish that sentence.”
“I don't suppose you have any silver bullets, do you?” Mycroft called, as Lestrade fired shot after shot into the monster that crawled toward him.
“Molly?” Sherlock asked as the timid pathologist lowered the crossbow, which appeared comically oversized in her small hands.
Lestrade tilted his head, his expression one of confusion. "It's not a full moon tonight. Or a new moon, for that matter."
Greg read the message, then handed the phone back without a response. Mycroft returned his gaze to the window. The sky was just beginning to lighten – the faintest hint of purple and a slight pricking along the surface of his skin let him know that dawn was fast approaching. They would be at their destination shortly.
He would finish taking inventory later. For now, Sherlock expected more. John would rather face another set of vampires than try to get out of the car without Sherlock's consent.
While enemy fighters were racing out of the compound, ignoring John in their midst, John couldn’t see the shape of any of his own men. Hoping against hope, he assumed that they had retreated to one of the underground shelters in the central courtyard. That was his instruction, always - structures can be rebuilt, objects can be repurchased, but your lives - undead or otherwise - are paramount. Still, though, John saw bodies lying in the dirt; bodies he recognized as friends. Far too many to turn, if he were even capable of such a thing; he had never tried. Assuming everyone went to ground, as directed, he would have no help from any of the vampires under his command in that regard.
Granting his wish, Sherlock nodded to the inspector and ducked under the tape, immediately making his way towards the centre of the crime scene, where markers and flags had already been set up around an opaque, plastic sheet under the victim's body.
John shifted in his seat and flicked through some of the papers laid out before him. He pulled out a piece of paper and slid it towards Sherlock.
What John saw in his peripheral vision, before he could even form a scream, was Sherlock pushing him aside. He felt the stake vibrate through Sherlock’s body and slow his heart long before he saw the blood pooling around a hole in his chest.
“That's enough talking about how fun murder is for one night, yeah?” John said, pushing himself away from the kitchen counter.
“Time to go, apparently,” Sherlock said, and made his way to the door. John waved to the still-chained vampire, and followed Sherlock. The pair opened the door, smiled quickly at the club employee who was waiting outside, and began to move as quickly to the exit as they could. Fifteen seconds later, before anyone in the bar was quite sure of what had happened, John and Sherlock were out the door.
“When I was thirty-four, I met Mary. Christ, I thought I was so lucky,” John said, laughing disbelievingly and looking up at the ceiling of the train compartment, doing his best not to break down. Sherlock, likewise, appeared grim for the sake of not letting his emotions get the best of him. He had expected, perhaps naively, that John’s past was more straightforward.
“Fair enough,” Sherlock replied, and walked to the desk to open his laptop. John left him, making his way to the bathroom, and Sherlock opened up a few files. Brushing up on what they knew so far, he felt confident that he wouldn't be too lost with John that evening. Not so lost, at least, that he couldn't fake some kind of brilliance. He glanced quickly at the lunar calendar he had bookmarked, then closed the computer. Not long after, John exited the bathroom, wearing a dark button-up shirt and a pressed pair of jeans that he didn't normally use. He noted that John looked much like Sherlock himself. His hair was neatly brushed, though he hadn't combed out the blood streaks. Sherlock glanced at himself in the mirror as he stood; he was pale, more so than usual, and appeared tired. The red smudges on his neck, and the dark stains on his shirt didn't add much to his appearance.
John kissed him, then slowly pulled himself away. “By the way.”. Sherlock rolled his eyes and carefully nipped at the doctor’s neck.
“Must have been kicked out by his wife again, no other reason for him to take the morning shift,” he muttered, and pulled on his other glove with a jerk.
“We’re running out of time,” Greg said as Sherlock glanced at his watch, adding, “less than an hour until sunset.”
“Hold that there,” John said, as he stood and quickly walked over to the desk and began to uncap a bottle of water. He poured it into a glass, managing to spill half of it on the table, and returned to Sherlock, concern written on his face.
Sebastian snorted. “Come on, soldier. You’ve sewn up plenty of people. Can’t handle it when the needle’s turned on you?”
John agreed. “I’ll call some friends who might be able to come up here and help us. If we start early tomorrow, we’ll have enough hours of daylight to put a plan together if we find anything.”
. She wouldn't rise to it; she was, after all, more than twice the man's age, and sure that the young vampire had his own reasons for keeping his condition secret. “Mutual,” she said, taking his hand firmly. Only the petite woman to Mycroft's right remained. Jane's eyes met her's.
“I know that,” John said, still irritated but quickly gaining composure as he quickly developed a plan for the future. “Getting them all here will have to wait, and I’ll need you three to deal with getting everyone back from Romania as soon as possible. But, I can get military men, good ones, like I was. They’re in Britain, and they’ll come in the meantime.”
John’s fangs popped out, and almost by instinct he leaned closer to Sherlock. On cue, Sherlock twisted to the side and urged John’s mouth closer; pain mingled with pleasure as John drank from Sherlock once more, climaxing as he did so. Not long after, Sherlock followed suit between their warm bodies, tired from the exertion. Slowly, John pulled away, much to Sherlock’s distaste, but quickly returned to his side.
“This is the real map,” Sherlock continued, grinning as he pointed at a second, black and white elevation plan. “Edited, to be sure, but correct.”
John assumed that the lines on his face, and the unmistakeable look of someone whose mind was focused on other things, could be credited less to the two – now three – dead bodies on his hands, and more to his impending divorce. Though the pale band of skin on his ring finger was less noticeable as his tan faded, the meaning behind it was not. The doctor could only hope that Sherlock didn't feel the need to point this out.
John nodded, and began to head towards one of the bookcases in the kitchen, opening a drawer and pulling out a stack of candles and candlesticks, lighting them and carrying them back into the sitting room. He could hear Sherlock coming downstairs.
“Pity,” Sherlock said, a genuine smile tugging at the corner of his mouth as he looked towards John. “Well, anyways, thank you for all your help…” He trailed away, and the waitress supplied her name. “Alice, great, thanks so much.”
Mycroft walked towards the table and glanced down at the papers Sherlock had stacked in some sort of order. The word vampire didn't appear anywhere – he wasn't surprised. As the other men in the room quietly read through case notes, Mycroft paused and allowed his mind to focus. Having fed on John so recently, he felt as though every part of his body had been retuned, with every nerve on fire, and his skin electrified. As the outer edges of his thoughts went silent, he could see the world around him with infinitely more detail than he ever could in life. He could hear the softly beating hearts of the detectives – Greg's slow, Sherlock's faster – and see the blood pass under the thinner skin of their wrists and necks. The hunger was still there, and he couldn't imagine it would ever disappear completely, but the edge was gone, and he no longer felt like a threat to the humans before him. Overhead, he could sense another person, who gave off an entirely different scent and life force. Not unpleasant, exactly, but not as rich and vibrant as Greg or Sherlock's. It was completely unlike theirs. When he payed close enough attention, he could hear John's breathing. He heard the sound of metal on metal – a safe? - and the movement of fabric. Seconds later, he heard quick movement, and then the sound of feet hitting steps. All eyes turned towards the door frame as John, out of breath, appeared behind Mycroft, looking down at the crossbow he was fiddling with. “Tonight. The next murder is going to be tonight, south side of the Thames somewhere.” He looked up and was met with the wide eyes of Lestrade and an expressionless Sherlock, whose head had snapped up the second his flatmate's foot hit the last step of the stairs. “Shit,” he murmured.
Slowly, he added, “Oh, and I’ve got the police detachment here on speed dial. What?” Sherlock had narrowed his eyes at him.
"An absolutely useless excuse for a nightwalker, tried to turn his grandmother, the bloody idiot, and The Council had to sort him out. Never mind that. So I confront him, and he hasn't the slightest clue what I'm talking about, he just wants to get back to selling overpriced cocaine to public school kids, or whatever the hell kind of racket he happened to be involved in that day. So he's annoyed, trying to get me off his back, but he does say that he's heard about all the real estate purchases, and keeps hearing the word 'army trio' tossed around. Now I know that rings a bell, doesn't it?"
“We’ll help him out,” Gabriel said, bruised and bloodied, but still living, gesturing at himself and Arturo. Together, they lifted Sebastian by either arm and followed Greg out the door. Gabriel paused before exiting entirely.
“The murders aren't going to end now that you've killed Thomas, are they?”Lestrade asked, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“I'll see what I can do,” John said, glancing at his phone as he pulled it out. Over the doctor's shoulder, Sherlock saw that he had received multiple texts from numbers he didn't recognize. He shut off the mobile and turned.
“John,” Sherlock said, then again more firmly, “John!” He was beginning to feel frustrated, not for the first time, with his best friend’s inability to listen to him.
Before Greg knew what was happening, he was shuffled unceremoniously into the bathroom to have a quick shower, while John gathered up every weapon in his room that had not been damaged in the earlier blast. Sherlock collected all of the case notes he presumed he would need, and within an hour the group was on the way to the train station. Fifteen minutes after arriving, the train was in motion, and their private, locked carriage was stacked with as many guns, stakes, and crossbows as John was able to carry out of the flat.
Thrown by the emotion that the Holmes was displaying, John put his barely touched water down and gave himself a moment to catch up. He leaned on the back of the chair.“You ate your bank teller.”
Sherlock and John grabbed  a quick breakfast at the hotel and immediately set out for the city core. Walking west, they headed in the general direction of Edinburgh Castle, looming over all. As usual, Sherlock’s brisk strides across the sidewalk left John rushing to catch up.
The pair began to walk up to the door, both glancing down the street to see if they were being observed. It was early morning, and the area was already beginning to become populated.
Moriarty laughed at this, in his usual, vaguely unsettling manner. Sherlock’s skin prickled – it was a laugh that lasted just a fraction of a second too long, so slightly unhinged that made Moriarty’s other unusual qualities more visible. There was silence, then Moriarty spoke abruptly. “Oh, darling. If all we wanted was an army, I wouldn’t have bothered playing with you two.” He winked at Sherlock. “Well, that’s not completely true. I would have played with you a little bit.”
“Coordinates for what?” John asked, quickly taking the paper back and trying to scan it for anything he could recognize.
“This way,” Sherlock said quietly, conscious of the echo in the small stone room. He gestured at an arch ahead of them. There were few doors in the vaults, but every so often they would have to wait for Greg to pry one open. Some rooms were wide, but the group had to traverse across them hunched over. Other passageways narrow, and they had to progress single file. At one point, Sherlock had to stop and consider two forked routes; trying to transpose his map onto the reality in front of him was not as easy a task as he expected.
“The man himself,” Moriarty answered, a fire burning deep in his eyes. At saying this, he came closer to Sherlock, who was still restrained - John could see Sherlock trying to pull back as Moriarty eyed the taller man’s neck, barely a breath away.
The other man continued to pace. “Even if I brought every seismic charge we have, it still wouldn’t be enough. We have no idea how many of them are down there!”
Sherlock pondered this. “As exciting as it would be to irritate Anderson, Mycroft was planning to call us with an update tonight. I’m sure you don’t want to miss it.”
“Sorry,” both men said quietly, and at the same time. After some time, and a fresh pot of tea later, Sherlock finally looked up.
John sat back, pondering. “I think we are,” he said, finally. “It all leads here. After the war…” Sherlock stopped moving, making sure John knew he was listening. “After the war I didn’t think I was suited for doing this anymore. It’s been… I don’t know. A mental block, I couldn’t sense things the way I could when I was in my twenties. But for the last couple weeks, I’ve been able to. I’ve tuned in to the city, and whatever is happening, it’s happening here. And soon.”
She finished off her glass and sat back, closing her eyes and feeling the group that was walking towards her come closer. They opened the moment a hand started to press on the door, creaking in the silence of the room. The bar was empty, as were the tables around her – she had arranged for privacy, and she was sure none of the employees here would be foolish enough to disregard her request.
During their last case, the pair had spent the day chasing after a criminal who had stolen paintings from one of the city's museums. It wasn't Sherlock's usual kind of project, but the detective inspector was unusually desperate, and the consulting detective had taken pity on him. He had, of  course, made sure that the pictures they were looking for weren't forgeries – after the last incident with stolen artwork, the fake Vermeer, John had decided that both of them had suffered enough for the sake of London's art community. What was supposed to be a simple deduction about the whereabouts of the paintings had stretched into a day long journey, requiring John and Sherlock to run back and forth across London, getting caught in rainstorms every so often, trying to catch the surprisingly fast thief. It was an absolute miracle that neither of them had slipped and broken a bone or caught a cold; John imagined that only death would have kept Sherlock from finishing the case, though even that wasn't certain. Twelve hours later, tired and wet, they had returned home, a bit worse for wear, and in need of some tea. Unfortunately, because he hadn't been particularly interested by the case, Sherlock's period of satisfaction following its completion was very brief.
Sherlock took a long, slow drag on his cigarette. The sun rose lazily, chasing away the darkness of the streets below. '
The pair was rarely completely silent together, but at that moment, they only watched the rain fall, shimmering before the orange streetlights, and running down the windowpanes.
“Good timing, Richter,” he said to Gabriel, taking the pistol the other man offered. The pair turned to the vampires around Sherlock and helped get the detective some space. He gave Sherlock back the gun he had taken earlier.
He paused, and could hear footsteps approaching his room. By the time Molly’s first knock had only just made contact with his door, he was already welcoming her in. Slightly flustered, she entered, and looked back to welcome Greg in as well.
By the time Molly had stopped running, Lestrade was already panting for air, and seemed as though he was one breath away from total collapse.
“I do this professionally, you know,” Greg replied with a hint of defensiveness. “You’ve lost the dark circles under your eyes. Seems like we’re all getting our bearings again.”
Molly and Mycroft scanned the boarded up windows of the nearby buildings. Everything seemed to be quiet. With a grunt, Lestrade managed to open the lock, and pushed the door forward gingerly.
Taking their final chance to get away, the vampires rushed forward. Unphased, John and Gabriel took them on in their own ways, but with the same result; in fewer than ten seconds, the vampires were staked.
“What worries you about going?” Sherlock asked, stopping in front of John at the end of the street as the pair waited for the distant lights of a cab to come closer. “You know it is the most logical decision, but you're reluctant. Why? Surely you've been worse places – and I have no doubt that we could handle ourselves.”
“This is alright with you?” Sherlock asked as he looked down at John intently, very reluctantly pulling away. He was desperate to get this particular piece of human interaction correct.
“It’s holy water,” John clarified. “Spread as much of it around as you can. I’m not sure if these things are following vampire rules, but it can’t hurt.” Sherlock followed John’s instructions, and took the interior of the building while John poured drops of water around the perimeter, making sure to soak the ground by the entrance.
"Is there something you're not telling me?" Sherlock asked, projecting his voice across the flat, and wondering if he should perhaps readjust his opinion on casual humour during cases.
“Excellent. We only have so many hours before dawn, and the streets are vampire-free. Let's make the most of them.” He tilted his head to the side and crossed his arms.
expect when she came into her lab that morning was seeing London's greatest mind perched on the edge of a metal slab, holding a tape measure up to a corpse.
Harker, watching the scene unfold, didn’t express any emotion one way or another. John imagined he expected that the numbers were on his side, and he had little to worry about. Indeed, the old vampire leaned back against his desk, arms crossed, as he surveyed the crowd, occasionally muttering directives to his progeny.
In the chaos, John noticed Harker slipping out through a narrow archway on the side of the main cavern.
“So,” Jane said, changing the subject and looking at the people who had arrived with John. She rested her head on her hand, gently tracing the jagged scar that ran across the dark skin of her cheek as she spoke. “Who are your friends?”
The first time John thought he was going to die, when he was shot, his life didn’t pass before his eyes. He thought of his mum. Nothing important, no great moments, just his mum. The way she would kiss him goodnight before she left in the evening, and how the smell of her perfume would linger in the room for a few minutes afterwards, like she was there when she wasn't. The lunches she would make him for school when he was a kid. The summer she took him fishing with jelly worms, because he couldn't bear to hurt any real ones. That was the summer she told him he should become a doctor. She said he was happiest when he was helping people, and the Van Helsings
“Come on, come on, drink,” John murmured, feeling only the slightest response from Sherlock. He was unsure how much of his blood was making it down.
“You were bleeding out in the sand,” Sherlock said, never one to accept modesty even in the least emotionally charged of situations.
“Oh, they were,” the waitress answered cheerfully, excited to converse with the great detective. “I’m afraid they’re closed at the moment. If you were hoping to do a tour this afternoon I could suggest-”
Molly started up the PC in front of her and opened up a map application and a lunar calendar, not sure if she would need either. She double-checked that the heavy, old rotary phone to her right was functional, and prepared herself to examine every book title in the room in order to learn what she kind of information she had access to. She was ready.
“Look closer,” Sherlock said, circling a black space below the lowest levels of vaults, meant to signify rock. The longer John looked, the more he realized that the particular section of rock that Sherlock was pointing at seemed to be filled in with a slightly lighter shade.
“Back again?” Sherlock asked as he walked up the stairs from Mrs. Hudson's, followed by Lestrade, tossing another notebook to the stack of books at the base of his desk.
“Poor choice of words, maybe - you are dead - but it's not the end of everything. You're brilliant. And one day you're going to be terrifying, brilliant, and immortal. And things will be better."
“I didn’t know. I was hopeful,” he said, honestly. “You had come to terms with your past. If ever there were a time that this could happen, it was now.” He held his breath as John exhaled.
As Molly typed, she added the notes, Googling the locations for additional information in the brief silences where no one had anything to contribute. So far, nothing was coming up – the list of warehouses and abandoned buildings really did seem to be just a list of empty spaces.
“We should go back,” Molly said, verbalizing what the detective inspector had been thinking from the moment they left the warehouse. “Mycroft could need our help.”
John glanced up at Harker, whose attention had finally landed on Mycroft and Moriarty. The pair was locked more in a battle of wits than in brawn, with Mycroft attempting to back Moriarty into the wall.  Moriarty would occasionally dodge forward towards Mycroft, who seemed stable and control of his stake, to the extent that he didn’t notice Harker coming up behind him. John walked back towards Sherlock and borrowed his gun, firing a shot towards Harker, but missing, as a vampire came towards him and grabbed him.
“Yep,” John said, standing up and shaking his jacket out, covering the sidearm on his waist. “Is the map still open on your phone?”
Mary smiled, able to conceal her fear for the most part. “Darling, I can barely hold back now. Every muscle, every impulse in my brain, is telling me to obey my maker and destroy one of us. Please, John.”
The group made their war to the vehicles, with Lestrade and Mycroft in one car, and Sherlock and John in the other. For the first time that night, the buzz of adrenaline in John's ears dissipated and he finally found the silence oddly comforting. He leaned back, moaning softly in pain and squeezing his eyes closed as his back shifted against the fabric seat.
John raised an eyebrow at his subordinate’s choice of words, and smiled tightly.  “Can’t take the boy out of Texas?” He offered.
John turned the pair over with firm hands, and slowly began to ease Sherlock open with his hands. A muttered “mmh” into John’s ear assured him that he was on the correct track. Pausing in his ministrations, he pulled out the lubricant and Sherlock heard the click of the lid opening. Sherlock, both excited and startled by the noise, moved his hands up from John’s arms towards his shoulders, giving himself leverage as he tilted his own hips forward. John hovered over Sherlock’s mouth, and gently traced the shape of his cupid’s bow with his own lip, before capturing the opposing mouth in a kiss. Carefully, more carefully than he had ever done anything in his life, John slid into him.
John sighed. Even years later, he recognized the man’s Lancashire accent the moment he heard it. Across from him, the fourth vampire grabbed Sherlock’s hands, and roughly pulled them behind his back.
John let out a short laugh, and without further delay, tilted the first bag upwards. Sherlock watched with fascination, not saying a word, as promised. The first was followed by a second, then a third. As John rubbed the back of a hand across his mouth, he glanced up at Sherlock awkwardly, and was greeted with a smile.
His destruction of choice that night was darts, which he directed towards a series of decorative milk bottles Mrs. Hudson had placed on the counter behind the sink. As she had put them there John knew they would wind up becoming victims of Sherlock's target practice, but didn't have the heart to inform his landlady that her homemaking would not be appreciated.
“We can give a vampire blood that will fill him with rage, take away his will, control him from afar,” he said, spreading his hands. “We can create them in whatever way we like.”
“Of course,” Molly replied. “You’re sure you’re going after them tonight? You can’t postpone? I haven’t heard back from anyone else. We need more time.”
“Why?” Sebastian repeated, coming closer. For the first time, John could see a hint of insanity in his old friend. It was well-hidden, to be sure, but in this moment the mask fell entirely. John had always caught glimpses of it, but wrote it off; smiles that fell too quickly, battle plans that were always a hint too sadistic. Now, he realized what a mistake he had made.
“Oh,” John said, and laid his hand flat on the table, brushing a thumb over the picture under it. “No one,” he said, before correcting himself. “No one important.”
The remainder of the afternoon was spent the same way every afternoon the previous few weeks had been. John would analyze crime scene photographs, and Sherlock would stare at slides of blood and fibres found on the bodies; occasionally one or both of them would add a theory to the running list that currently covered seven pages of a notebook, which lay in the middle of their breakfast table. Sherlock, more than once, described them as 'unusually inefficient' – a phrase he had directed only at his doctor, but John had expanded to include Sherlock as well.
“Obviously I don't,” Sherlock replied, scowling at John. “Don't be ordinary. No – this is simply the basic shape of the weapon that we should be looking for. Consider that all of the murders have occurred after dark, and all of the victims have exhibited remarkable blood loss.”
“You made it a little easier to silence the terror,” he admitted. “‘Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once.’” When great-great-great-great granddad said that, I can imagine his intent behind it was ‘who the hell cares, let’s kill some vampires.’ It has to be done - so let’s do it.”
The sight before them didn't so much surprise Sherlock as it fulfilled the image he had of it in his head. Loud bass, unheard from the street, filled the dark, smoky room, and groups of people throughout the crowd talked loudly to one another. Figures occasionally leaned over to the people they were with (their humans, Sherlock supposed) to bite at them or pull at others nearby. Tables scattered throughout the room were filled with cards and chips, and crowds around those groups would occasionally let out a cheer. John closed the door behind himself, and made his way to the counter with Sherlock, meandering through the many bodies in his way. He didn't intend to order anything, more than half of the clientele in the building wouldn't either, but the area was slightly less busy. Sherlock stood close in front of him and looked around, taking in his new surroundings. One exit, no windows, and a few back rooms; nothing out of the ordinary. Almost immediately, a hand reached out to grab at Sherlock, who was still weak enough from losing so much blood that he fell to the side, leaning towards the vampire that had grabbed him.
Sherlock grinned. “No, apparently not.” He pulled a small flashlight out of his jacket and clicked it on, the light illuminating only a small area of the barn. Sherlock directed it at John, trying to follow the sound of his coughs.
John felt propelled more by instinct than anything else, aware that he had a job to do but still mentally far away. He found as he walked across the courtyard to the armory that he was not attracting a great deal of attention, in spite of the fact that he was fairly recognizable, and any vampire going through the effort of attacking his military installation would know who he was. Nevertheless, only a few of the younger, wilder enemy vampires made any attempt to attack him, and even then they were quickly intercepted by one of John’s soldiers. The battle was truly in full-swing, with the soldiers - now all present and accounted for - spread out in a semi-circle, shooters taking a step forward after every round they shot. Others, armed with stakes, paced between the sharpshooters and waited for a rogue vampire to branch out and try a solo attack.
“I'm a terrible doctor, sometimes,” John said, shaking his head as he remembered Sherlock's current state. “We should try to find someone who isn't here for the entertainment. What do you think?”
It was past midnight by the time John and Sherlock began their final walk back to the hotel. John felt a bit disappointed - the sense of disquiet he had gotten when they initially arrived in Edinburgh was replaced by more of a dull sensation that something was wrong, but without any particulars. Once they slipped into their hotel room and accounted for half of the luggage, John felt like he had enough of a handle of the situation to talk to Sherlock.
John Watson had a headache. He was beginning to feel as though he always had some kind of throbbing in his head, though he was usually better at tuning it out. As he read through the stack of documents on the table before him, he quietly chastised himself for being surprised that his flatmate was trying to drive him insane, given that it was becoming a regular occurrence. Sherlock, without a case for a week, had begun what was quickly becoming known to John and Mrs. Hudson as the first phase of boredom: senseless vandalism. Sherlock, of course, would argue that there was some sense to it, but he would also occasionally state that he did not know how to use the vacuum, and for that reason alone was not considered a paragon of sensibility by his housemates.
“You said you were in the military for twelve years, correct?” Sherlock asked, analyzing every line of John's face, remembering ever scar on the doctor's hands. Perhaps he didn't know where each one had come from.
“Thank you,” John replied. “For what you did. I wasn't expecting anything to come for us this close to dawn. Was that the first person you've ever... killed?” He was unsure if implying that Molly was a murderer was quite the right approach to take.
“Are you the only one here?” Sherlock asked. The day had just begun, and the pale orange light that streamed through the windows at the far end of the empty office suggested that the city was not yet awake.
John looked warily at the entrance to the caves. “Psychological blast,” he said, a bit shakily. “Some vampires, not a lot, can create them. It temporarily imbues an object with a memory, or a sensation.”
John grinned, for the first time in the long trip. “Not even close.” He recalled that being the very first question he asked after he was found, following the massacre. Even then, he had known the answer before he had been told. “All that trouble, and not one person got to the lowest level of the vaults.”
“Now,” Sherlock replied, turning up his coat collar and looking at his companion, “we have some experiments to do.”
John rolled his eyes and let him go, feigning interest in his phone, checking the time for the tenth time in as many minutes.
Sherlock and his brother weren't close – they had had many disagreements, some of which were serious enough to cause a permanent rift between them. But they were also related, and cared deeply for one another, proving so by their actions, if not by their words. While he was aware that Sherlock would never claim to be fond of his sibling, he also knew that he would take the death of his brother harder than anyone.
“Where are we going?” Sherlock asked, and John looked up at him. “You seem to have a plan, or you wouldn't have sent the others off to look at the warehouses. What is it?”
He rummaged in the stack of papers and handed a couple of newspapers to John. Circled on the inside pages of both were news articles about murders that had taken place in the city - some with what were called “bite marks,” others that were bloodless.
He unfolded the paper and read the page of addresses. Sherlock glanced over his shoulder at them. “This is...”
As he read through the list, Sherlock had done some quick mental math. “How are you only a captain? Years of service, number of soldiers in your command. It doesn’t add up.”
“Hope you guys weren’t taking a nap,” he said, cheerful, “I’ve got Edinburgh and London working together. Everyone’s thrilled to see another piece of the puzzle.”
With Moriarty being backed into a corner by Mycroft, John was able to turn his attention to the back shadows of the cavern, towards the Old Ones he had seen earlier. He had expected more trouble from them, but evidently they couldn’t be bothered - upon noticing John watching them, they slipped out with the subtlety with which they came in.
“Good,” John said. “That’s one thing sorted, then. It’s nice to see someone else has a plan. So, why did you call us back?”
“Maybe you should take a look at these,” the doctor said, turning around to face his friend. “Could be interesting.” He ignored the unamused look that was levelled at him before he had even finished speaking. “Just... for me, all right? And I'm sure Molly'd appreciate it, after what you did with her toes.”
“Don't bother,” Lestrade replied. “Just meet me down at the water. You may as well get him to take a look at the crime scene itself before you see the other bodies. This time the body was near the Thames, around where you found the security guard last year. You should be able to spot the team on the beach, if you look far enough along it.”
"I was just speaking to Sherlock about a case that may possibly occupy your time, now that the pair of you have been so...
John began walking towards his right to make sure that he closed off all possible exits for the two vampires in front of them. “No one woke me,” John said, flipping his stake from side to side.
“I know what I saw,” John stated firmly, his posture reminding Mycroft of the defiance the man before him never seemed to be without.
John’s left hand began to shake. He had run into Tom plenty of times before in Romania, Moldova, Spain - wherever a vampire of some significance was recruiting followers, Tom seemed to turn up. He was an enemy, to be sure, but very low-level. Until the moment Mary spoke his name, harmless.
“Quite right,” Sherlock said, glancing up from his phone. “It’s possible no one knows we’re here yet. If there are more traps laid in the vaults, and I’m positive there are, then all we’d do is warn them. One can only hope Mycroft has been successful in getting caught - I’m certain that in his interrogation he would find a way to suggest we’re still in London.”
A crowd had started to gather just inside the door, as those near the commotion in the back of the bar began to take notice of John, Sherlock, and the other man.
“You’ve killed a lot of people trying to make vampires,” John said, unamused. “Haven’t seen much proof that you’ve made any good ones.”
“You know I can't do that,” John answered, his eyes scanning the room briefly. No windows. “Because forgetting this won't keep anyone else from dying.”
“Oh, fine,” Greg said, reluctantly taking charge of the conversation while glancing at the other two men. “Just talking about murder. How are you?”
John looked at him and started laughing. Lestrade - as usual, amused at the pair, but still out of the loop - smiled.
“Ever the soldier, Doctor Watson,” Mycroft said, the feigned politeness he had used up until that point disappearing. He set his untouched glass on the table beside him. “Are you positive this is a war you want to enter?”
As the clock struck seven, John stood from his chair and stretched, yawning as he turned slowly from side to side, trying to will the feeling back into his limbs. Shrugging on his nearest jacket, he slipped his wallet into his back pocket and turned to his friend.
John pulled his eyes from the road to look at Mycroft. “I'm going to find out why I haven't heard about this, first of all. Next I'll try to figure out a plan of attack to get this under control.”
Sherlock turned his gaze on John, nearly baring his teeth as he spoke. “'Makes sense?' Being thrown off the case we've spent weeks on because someone has decided that
Sherlock, with a gloved hand, pulled out a small piece of paper. On it, in neat, red script, was the number fourteen.
As they pulled up to the curb outside 221B, John took out his phone, glancing at it and slipping it back in his pocket. “I'm going to grab a few things and check some maps. Shouldn't take long.”When he turned to look at Mycroft, he found the seat empty, and his own door being opened. By the time John slid out of the car, Mycroft had already made it to pavement and was striding towards the door. “I'm never going to get used to you being that fast.”
John ran a hand over the back of the chair he was standing beside, looking at the frayed threads as his jaw moved. “Thomas is – was – someone I knew years ago. I thought he'd died a few years ago, the last time I was in Romania, tracking a group of vampires who had killed most of a small village. I was wrong. I think the feeling was mutual, actually,” John said, a smile at the edge of his mouth disappearing as soon as it was formed.
Greg spread a hand across the folders and stacks of photographs on the table. John recognized some from 221B, when he and Sherlock were still privy to official case documents. “Getting Scotland PD on board is the plan today. Take a look at this.”
Mindful of this fact, the pair received a knock on the door from Lestrade a quarter of an hour later, just as Molly exited Sherlock's room. By the time the sun had fallen, she and Sherlock were fully engrossed in the results of his more recent testing on the blood, and were comparing it with the notes on her own laptop that she kept about the bodies she analyzed in the morgue.
“Jonathan Harker. But, you, you’re not…” He looked back and forth between Sebastian and Moriarty, who was smiling broadly. “You were the greatest hunter of your day. My parents named me after you. You died.”
John shrugged and turned back to the advancing crowd, and glanced at Sherlock - he seemed to be in high spirits, holding some silver netting and slipping a gun and shoulder holster across his body.
Absently, rearranging some of the photos that were still on the table, John said, “he never said that I couldn't push anyone in the river.”
“You look as though you have a plan,” the other man said, adjusting his tie. “I couldn't resist the opportunity to see what you're going to do.”
“You... That's not possible, Mycroft,” John said, straightening up and crossing his arms again. “Someone had to have turned you.”
Almost simultaneously, John and his old friend sensed something, turned in the opposite direction, and shot at two vampires who were slowly coming up behind them. John aimed for a non-integral part of the body; Gabriel aimed for the head.
The trip back to the warehouse seemed to take much longer than the run from it, and as they drew closer, neither Greg nor Molly was quite confident they knew what they would find.
“That you can see,” she replied, uncrossing her arms and opening her mouth just enough that her fangs could be seen.
“Yes, I know you are,” Sherlock said pointedly, narrowing his eyes as he stared at his companion. “You could start now.”
,' recited a dull voice from the depths of his memory. He was always surprised what his mind chose to remember – he distinctly recalled deleting the musings of poets. Evidently it hadn't worked. It seemed to be developing into a problem in recent months, and when he thought about it – when he had time to – he worried that he would lose room for more valuable thoughts. Nevertheless, despite his conscious protestations, in the middle of a case, he would find himself suddenly contemplating the shape of the moon, or a detailed recipe for scones. A math equation, the Canadian national anthem.
"John has my request under consideration. Has the detective inspector taken pity on you and allowed you back on the case?"
“A call,” George said. “As we were flying west, Jane was flying east. By the time we landed, she had left a message on Caroline’s phone – she had tracked Tom to Bistrita. In light of that, we have assembled our forces, and hope to end this once and for all.”
Slipping through the door to the central command building, John started running. He had been reticent to do so outside, for fear of attracting attention to himself, but here all bets were off. “Sebastian!” he yelled, rounding the corner towards the stairwell. At the top, he glanced out the window, and got a better handle on what was happening below. By now, most of his soldiers were on the ground and fighting, but with a flash of unease John noted that the munitions building was surrounded heavily by enemy vampires. John was well aware that the building was not marked, nor was it named on maps - someone on the base would have had to point out where it was.
Greg glancedup at Mycroft, then began to type a response back, far slower than Mycroft had been typing.
“My apologies,” Mycroft responded uncomfortably, suddenly self conscious. He didn't notice any blood on his own person – John must have cleaned him up. “How long were you waiting?”
From where he stood, he could clearly see the back of a tall man, who was pinning a well-dressed young woman to the side of the tunnel, her neck twisted to the side unnaturally. From her neck and along her slightly shaking arms coursed a trail of blood, which snaked along the pale tiles below her. After a space of time that John could not measure, a sickening crack was heard, and the body of the woman collapsed on the ground, limp and unmoving. The man knelt down beside her, leaning forward to look at her. John took a step forward, his shoulders now free of tension as he faced the man.
Sherlock glanced up finally, looked him over, then answered, waving the question away with his hand. “Another murder, a few hours ago.”
Grumbling and rolling his eyes – the closest John had seen his flatmate get to admitting defeat – snatched the papers back and began laying them out on the workbench beside his microscope. Satisfied, John stood, and took his tea into the sitting room, leaving Sherlock to his deductions.
“Are you sure, John?” he asked. “No one would blame you if you killed him.” Sebastian didn’t bother looking up, as though nothing registered for him beyond his failure.
John himself began loading up gear, tending more towards hands-on combat weapons - blades, stakes, and what Sherlock thought was a sai being slipped into a custom-made slot near the back of John’s cross-body holster. One gun made the cut, along with several dozen silver bullets. Once zipped up, the group could pass as ordinary, if slightly uncomfortable-looking, visitors to the city.
Sherlock gasped, apparently involuntarily, and grabbed at the sheets of the bed. As though by natural reflex John brought a hand up to Sherlock's face, a thumb pressing against his jaw, and pulled him closer. Blood filled his mouth, and John was immediately struck by a feeling of overwhelming desire, wanting at once to drain him of blood, while at the same time wanting to keep Sherlock with him, and alive. It was with a certain amount of reluctance, and a great deal of guilt for feeling reluctant, that John released Sherlock and reached for a towel. He pressed it to Sherlock's neck, trying to cover the puncture marks as best he could.
“Yep,” said a voice across from him. He looked up, opening his other eye gingerly and blinking, trying to see the smaller man better.
“Not until recently,” Jane said, glancing at John before continuing to look through the rest of the photographs. “And I haven't seen pictures this detailed. Definitely vampire attacks, then,” she said as she came to a particularly gruesome image of a woman whose neck appeared to be very nearly severed. One of Mycroft's victims, John knew, but he intended to keep that fact secret a little longer.
John walked forward slowly. Hand outstretched, he moved towards what appeared to be a solid stone wall. However, his hand seemed to pass through it entirely. He glanced back at his friends. “Another illusion.”
“Harker’s left you behind,” John said, full of rage and unexpressed pain. With the benefit of being above Sebastian, he landed a punch squarely in the other man’s jaw. “It’s over.”
John glanced up and put his pen down, surprised that Sherlock was willing to delve into the topic in the enclosed space of the train carriage – an aggressive tactic even for the consulting detective.
Molly Hooper had assumed that she would start her Monday the way she usually did, with a cup of coffee. She would fill out paperwork for a while, check what bodies had arrived overnight, and maybe grab lunch with one of the girls upstairs. What she did not
John shrugged. “No one really condemns them too much, as long as the humans stay alive, and quiet about the existence of vampires. Just keeping one person, and feeding off them... It's a relatively new thing in the culture, considering the thousands of years that vampires have existed. There's a lot less death involved when the human half of the partnership is given time to recover before being fed off of again.”
Charles moved towards John abruptly, correctly recognizing this as a challenge to George’s authority.
John, mouth open, came closer to him, and pulled away. He considered reassuring Sherlock once more time, but decided against it. He pulled down Sherlock's collar a bit further, and brushed a stray curl out of his way. Giving himself a moment to wonder how his life had managed to go so off-course, he paused above Sherlock's neck, his fangs barely brushing the pale skin of the detective's neck. He breathed in the scent of the man before him – was Sherlock using his shampoo? No, not important – and bit down.
!” John said, exasperated as he turned to face the window, arms crossed. He tried not the flinch as he pressed on his broken rib.
Lestrade heaved a sigh as he left the room, muttering about 'all the damn vampires,' followed by Mycroft who nodded at John. Although he would never say it, he was thankful that the doctor had been so discreet about his condition.
“John Watson, Sherlock Holmes,” John said, looking directly into the figure's eyes. He opened his mouth and allowed his fangs to become visible. Though the man remained silent, he stepped back, and watched John intently as he guided Sherlock down the hall, to yet another flight of stairs.
John recalled the first and only other time that he had pressed that button. He was still young, new to the base that had just been established. Every rogue vampire created during the war that the humans were waging had come running, and John was more than willing to set his corner of the world in order. He had set off the sirens, announced to the base that “ladies and gentlemen, we are at war,” then proceeded to win the briefest, bloodiest, and most orderly battle in recent memory.
Jane's eyes flicked to Mycroft, and took in his well-pressed suit and tie, and – more striking than anything else – his absent pulse. “You're -”
“No, I guess not. Might as well get going on the coordinates while it’s still light out, though, eh?”
“Government technology,” Sherlock said dismissively. “I should have attached a tracker to him. Actually, Mycroft should have done so himself. Rubbish big brother,” he muttered, sliding the laptop onto a side table.
Lestrade glanced up from his phone. “Oh, just the, you know, ex,” he said, sending off a text and slipping it back in his coat pocket awkwardly. “Today was supposed to be my weekend with the kids. Obviously this is a bit more pressing, so we’re going to have to postpone.”
“Sebastian said he was going to get you,” Gabriel said, taking his own chance to glance at John. “He was in the courtyard when they came barreling through.”
For all the skill Mycroft had at making travel arrangements and faking the information necessary to get him where he needed to go, he had nothing on Sherlock’s ability to act quickly to resolve time-sensitive problems. In the present situation, Sherlock had managed to call in a favour from a school companion of Mycroft’s who worked for the transportation minister. However reluctant the friend may have been to get involved in what Sherlock was planning, he was more than willing to provide him with an empty train compartment so long as no questions were asked.
John was not particularly emotional - ‘showing only as much as needed’ was his go-to response to most situations - but at this moment he sobbed with a vigorousness that is known only to those who feel as though they have lost everything. Eventually, he felt empty - tired and aching in both body and soul, adrift in the wake that his grief had left him in.
An old man walked forward, cane in hand. A younger man holding a gun flanked him, as did and a tall, blonde woman in a pristine white suit.
As Sherlock came through the door, John immediately turned and said, “more vampires!” brightly, trying to set the mood.
“There,” John said, more to himself than the other men, as he directed the group to a large alley, directly between two abandoned brick warehouses. The atmosphere had become so dark that, though there was a streetlight in the passage, the end of it could not be seen.
John pushed at the heavy barn doors, to see if they would give. Not feeling any movement, he began to throw himself into the door with his shoulder. After two solid shoves the old door gave way, and John fell in to the building.
“Something irrelevant,” he replied, shaking his head. “Not something you need to know now.” Out of habit John wandered towards the window and looked out, glancing up and down the street. A war was building, and there was not even so much as a whisper to be heard on the deserted street. “I'm not sure where to start,” he said quietly, speaking towards the glass.
Sherlock, whose arms were crossed across a fresh shirt – John imagined the other one, unsalvageable as it likely was, had been tossed right in the bin – looked down at John with narrow eyes and an expression that screamed 'danger.' “Are you going to explain, or are we going to stare at your gun until
Without another thought towards him, John immediately fell back to the floor, bit his wrist, and held it up to Sherlock’s mouth. The healing properties of John’s own blood had always been suspect, but John didn’t have time to experiment and make sure it was optimal. Even as he tilted Sherlock’s head back and guided the blood down his friend’s throat, he knew that it likely wouldn’t fix a mortal wound. He had never had to push its limits.
He managed to follow Sherlock along, vampire in tow, until they reached a large door, which Sherlock hoped lead to an empty room. In luck, John's instructions for unlocking it worked, and once opened revealed an empty room, bare, save for a heavy table in the centre of it. In the moment it took John to watch Sherlock enter the room, one of the vampire's hands became freed, and struck him under his eye, momentarily blinding him. Before he noticed what had happened, Sherlock grabbed hold of the vampire and shoved him to the table, holding him down by the neck.
Mycroft, taking advantage of his superhuman speed, reached Sebastian’s rifle and pried it from his grasp. Eyes widening in uncharacteristic surprise, Sebastian tried to pull it back and was met with the butt of it in his jaw. The moment he staggered back, John lunged for the vampires on either side of Sherlock. Even without weapons in hand, he was a force to be reckoned with, particularly when he was full of fresh blood.
Sherlock cut her off, still bright and happy. “Oh, no! What a shame. And here we came all this way. When do they open again?”
The pair could overhear Lestrade speaking to one of his colleagues, presumably a superior, to whom he was attempting to explain his extended absence from the office at the height of a serial murder crisis. Eventually, however, he returned to the kitchen and put the phone in his shirt pocket. “No one’s seen her at work today. Apparently she’s taken a couple of days off to go to a funeral in Edinburgh.”
“Oh.”John wasn't sure what to say. He wasn't quite prepared to unpack Sherlock's words – he didn't even have the time – but he knew that his friend was all right. Seemingly unscarred by the event, in any case.
George pulled a map from his bag, and handed it to John. Sherlock came closer to John and peered over his shoulder as he unfolded the map. On it, different cities in Hungary and Romania were circled. John raised an eyebrow and looked at George questioningly.
“Oh, that,” he said, laughing and placing it on the table beside him, ignoring the question. “Right, then. Silly theory anyways, shall we go?” He asked Mycroft, and made his way for the door.
Molly was by no means unfamiliar with libraries, but it was not often that she had free time to spend in the British Library examining its extensive collections. It was an even less frequent occurrence that she was allowed access to the magnificent rare book collection that the library housed. During her present visit, she had bypassed the rare book section entirely when she was brought to the basement of the building through hidden doors and false walls.
The darkness that crept into his mind, willing his muscles to move against his own will, slowly overwhelmed each of the man’s senses. As though in a dream, he watched as his hands clawed against the dark clay of the floor, pushing him upwards until he stood. His eyes blank and his expression slack, Mycroft looked out of his bodily prison into the darkness.
It didn’t take long to get Greg up to speed. Like John, he went through his own version of the stages of grief - first denial, then panic, then rapidly to acceptance. Reaching the last step was likely due to the devil-may-care attitude of John and Sherlock, who seemed to embrace going to their deaths with a compelling sense of relish. John directed them all back to Lestrade’s room to itemize their weapons, and Sherlock detoured to the hotel’s business centre to print out yet another map, this one showing a detailed layout of the vaults’ many levels.
“Don't you dare apologize to me,”John said, interrupting. “You couldn't just kill her properly, could you?” John raised his voice and took a few steps toward Mycroft. “I thought she had died – I could have saved her.” Mycroft flinched and looked up at John. After staring down at him for a moment, John regained his composure, unclenched his hands, and spoke softly but dangerously. “A woman died and it's my fault. I just left her there. Who was the first? The woman from the bank? Did you give her a peaceful death or did she die screaming too?”
Molly touched the blood on her lab coat and rubbed it between her fingers. “What should we do about this?” She asked, looking down at the body.
“No,” John said, “Vampires don’t decay, and they don’t generally bother burying the humans they kill.” He ran his flashlight over the ground once more. “If there were a body here, we’d see it.”
John glanced over at Sebastian, who still held his rifle, ready to shoot at any moment. In the silence following his words, John attempted to reconcile what he hoped was true and what he knew. Accepting the most likely possibility seemed impossible.
“You really don't want to do that,” John said, his voice rough from being choked, gritting his teeth against the pain that flooded every nerve.
“A friend of mine, Gabe, just saying he got my message. He said he’s going to try getting some people over here as soon as he can. Aiming for tomorrow, he said. I gave him Molly’s number at the library so she could get us all organized.”
“No luck,” Molly answered. “Unless we’re searching for werewolves, which I’ve been readily assured do not exist. Or witches, apparently they’re big on moons, too. How are we feeling about witches, John? Do they exist?”
Without a second's notice, a dark shape moved out of the darkness, coming towards John from his left. Reaching behind himself, under his jacket, he pulled out two previously unnoticeable silver blades, unhooking them from a hidden pocket.
On the other side of the room, Lestrade chuckled and put his own gun into its holster. “I’ve been trying to avoid thinking about it. So far I’ve managed to get them to lay off me by telling them I’m following a lead, and doing it on my own dime.”
“Extract of, yeah,” John said, taking another sip of the drink, and tossing the used piece of cloth to the side table. “Never leave the house without it.”He pulled a small bottle from his pocket and held it out far enough for Mycroft to see it. A small amount of the liquid moved around in the glass.
John smiled mildly, knowing better than to interrupt one of Sherlock’s tangents. When he was particularly cross, everything became Mycroft’s fault. Especially, however rare it was, when Sherlock was worried about him.
“Not much of anything,” John answered, taking the crumpled paper out of the desk drawer. “Here.” He handed two folded sheets of notebook paper to Sherlock.
the voice at the back of his head demanded. Shaking the thought away, he remembered that he had to give Sherlock some kind of explanation.
“Our species are incompatible - you made us work with them. Work for them." Sebastian said angrily, lowering his rifle as he marched forward to John. “How could hunters trust someone whose mother is a vampire? Who is a vampire?”
“Are you feeling anything?” John asked. “Not the weird supernatural bullshit. Do you feel any deductions coming on?”
John leaned back in his seat and began to fiddle with the paper sleeve of his coffee cup. Sherlock was already surprised, and beginning to question whether he was prepared for the answers he would receive.
John barely managed to keep from burying his head in his hands and ignoring the world for a while. He vacillated between trying to impress upon Mycroft the magnitude of his actions, while at the same time trying to comfort a hopelessly lost new vampire, if not out of empathy, then because he was a blood relation to his best friend. He considered whether his current situation would be any easier to navigate if Mycroft were a stranger, but came to the conclusion that it most certainly wouldn't.
“Is that really what you want?” Mycroft's silence gave his answer and John sighed. "No. I've lost too many people already. It's not a death sentence, you know, all of this.”
The vampire turned back to them, pulled a handkerchief from the jacket of his suit, and wiped the dust from his hands.
“It’s safe to say there’s nothing in Romania,” he said, anger rising as his cheeks began to flush. His eyes were unable to focus on anything in particular as he tried to grasp the implications of what was happening.
Standing in front of what appeared to be an empty field bordered by a cheap chain-link fence, Greg was the first to break the silence.
John glanced up at him briefly, then back down quickly at the paper. “Good as new, you’re just a bit pale. Want to have a shower? I’ll get some proper coffee and meet you outside.”
“Brilliant,” he said, looking back at the corpse on the floor. As John realized what she meant, he looked up at Sherlock, who added, “In the worst possible way?” To the end of his exclamation. He was beginning to predict when John was about to mutter 'not good.'
