He sighed and went to the bedroom. The bottom drawer in the dresser held the only forms of clothing he could stand on his skin when he was like it. He stripped and put on the silken garments that brought some cool relief from the heat that was radiating off his skin. He put on the cotton robe that was hanging on the back of the closet door trying to keep from shivering.
“I texted her but no reply. Signal strength in the morgue itself is not the best,” said Sherlock.
“I am glad that we can provide you such amusement.”
“This is one of the concoctions that we talked about at this afternoon’s session. It will allow the subject to feel but not move.”
I shuttered at that thought. How many times had I lost him without knowing that I had?
I shook it and noticed a slight tremor in the shake. I looked at his wrists just poking out of his shirt cuffs and noticed scars that seemed to ring them. There was a story there to be told.
I did as I had been ordered and went to my room.
He led me to a door which was slightly ajar and led out into a formal garden. He found another gate and we fled into the woods getting as far away as we could from our captors.
“Maybe put something in his mouth to keep him quiet?”
He cried out in frustration but the torment continued to beyond where he wanted nothing to ever touch him again. His brain was on overload from the sensation of his nerve endings being hit over and over.
“Come on up,” I said.
I rolled over and found Holmes looking at me with such adoration I felt myself blush.
“Another fucking word Anderson and I will promise you I will castrate you without anesthetic,” roared the omega, “And that goes for the rest of you lot. Now were the fuck is HE!”
It was if a light dawn and he said, “Shirley, you saw Shirley. Jim’s personal slave. Jim is the only one that gets to touch her. If you try, you will find yourself missing a hand or something more important.”
“Watson, I fear that something dire has happened,” said Holmes, “I have never known my brother to be so insistent on our return. I guess our holiday will have to wait again.”
He helped me under the bed clothes and then I felt him slide naked behind me gather me up in his arms.
They set up it up again with the knife at John’s throat and shot it.
“But for how long will I be with you?” He tapped the side of his head, “Who is to say that when you wake up it won’t be with me but someone else from inside my head.”
“Come,” I said.
It was heading towards winter when I found myself in my surgery staring at the figure in front of me with my mind not believing what I was seeing.
I followed him to the bedroom and was introduced to Winston.
“I present to you William Holmes heir to all that entails.”
He opened his eyes and look at me on the cot sitting with my back against the wall in the straightjacket. I had Holmes dresses in his nightshirt and robe that Mycroft sent. I was wearing my khet partug that was given to me by the Chief. It allowed for my bandages to not be rubbed against by tighter clothing. The straightjacket had been set up so I could get out of it if I needed to.
John moaned and kissed Greg while Sherlock brought him to orgasmic completion.
Sherlock smiled and nodded demurely. He crawled to the bed but hesitated to get up on the bed.
“Mary and you can raise the children John. I would not interfere with that but there will come a point where if it becomes apparent that one of those children is Sherlock’s issue…”
I saw Moriarty hold up her hand and he stopped talking.
We heard the dogs howls and the shouts of men as we ran for our lives.
I remember what Yama told me about playing along with the personality.
I kissed him on the lips, “I wish to be your most abject slave in all things.”
Hope you enjoyed this section. More action adventure is next as Watson flees with Sherlock and his hostage.
“I must thank you for the demonstration brother. I do see what you see in him. He Is perfect for you and so…”
I dried him off and helped him into clean clothes that magically appeared.
comments are loved and encourage me to continue writing this.
“John…” he tried to find the words.
John Watson had never expected to find himself in the position that he was in. When he had been typed at the time of the beginning of his hormonal changes, he was decreed a Beta. Due to an experiment with his insane flat-mate, he had become an Omega. In short order he had been mated to his flat-mate and then found himself in the unusual position of being an Omega to two Alphas when the Detective Inspector was added into the mix by his Alpha deciding that they needed the DI as part of their family.
“Now Toby go play with Basil.”
I tried to ask questions but no one would talk to me. Moran finally put a leather bit gag in my mouth.
He pulled it out and tapped in John’s code.
John took Jim’s hair and stroked it lovingly, “See my boy, I told you that Daddy would make it aaaaalll better. The mean old man wouldn’t hurt you anymore.”
“How did I end up here?”
“Hey,” he yelled as loud as he could, “Hey!”
“I know you are owned John. It is obvious to anyone who is part of the Marketplace. Mycroft Holmes told me why he put you with my entourage. And you have not only served me but Mother Russia as well.”
I picked the lock and we found ourselves looking out onto a courtyard of the manor.
“I saw him,” I said.
“I do not know but I do know that I find her very interesting. There is something….off about her,” he said to me.
“I hear a ‘but’ in that,” I said even though I knew where this was going.
At some point tea appeared at my elbow. I drank and ate what was put next to me.
Character Death
“No, that’s John call as much as I want to,” said Sherlock, “put them on ice and await further orders. Someone come pick me up and get me to the hospital.”
“Besides, he likes to watch and I am sure we can give him the sort of entertainment that he likes and introduce him to things he didn’t even know existed.”
“No,” said James, “It is done. Take him to his new owner.”
I found myself back in the desert with the heat and my clothes sticking to my body. I saw my first Master get shot over and over again. Each time I was just too late to save him or at least take the bullet for him. Somewhere in this Lord Baron morphed into Holmes and I could do nothing to save him either. I could see Moran take the shot and the body go down hitting the rocks hard. Blood everywhere.
In the dark we whispered to each other. Trying to keep something of ourselves alive but each day became harder and harder. Eventually the whispering stopped for the most part. It was replaced by moans and sounds of pain as we were ‘taught’ our lessons well.
“Read the document Mycroft. We both know what happens to him next.”
“Shir…” she started to say but I took my right hand and strangled her into unconsciousness.
His Pet started to insert the cock in front of him into his mouth.
I watched as he absorbed the information I had given him.
John saw the bag and said, “Really?”
I was given robes like the other monks to wear and led to a room that looked very European. There was a large desk and a number of over stuffed armchairs around a very large fireplace. There was a large set of bookshelves with lots of books on various subjects in various languages.
The next couple of days were hell. I could barely move. Holmes wasn’t moving much and the longer that went on the more concerned I became.
“What did you say?”
He tried to slow his breathing again and sort through what he was going to do to the people who put him in this situation.
Dislocating his thumbs was not John’s favorite activity. Dislocating someone else’s thumbs was much more fun in his books. He managed to get his wrists free of the zip ties and was about to attack the tape holding his arms and chest to the chair he was sitting in when the light went on in his face.
"Sherlock, two little girls!"
He turned his head towards me, his lips brushing against my cheek.
It was terribly empty.
"Well, what did you find, Mycroft, where are we going? America? Germany? Where?" Sherlock rattled off.
"I don't think…I'll be here, sissy."
"So you're going to talk to me now?" I asked, sitting on the bed.
"Indie, sweetheart, it's alright, it'll stop soon. I know it's scary, but I promise it'll be okay, just keep your head bent forward." I said to her.
How could I destroy my little girl's world?
"Sherlock Holmes, why is your tongue blue?!"
He rubbed his hand up and down her back gently and watched her long eyelashes flutter closed.
"Daddy, you're home!" River said, running to him. He caught her in his free arm and picked her up, kissing her on the cheek.
"It means perfect and you are both my perfect girls, the most beautiful, intelligent, and loving girls in this whole world."
"Now wait, River, we must help Papa and wash the dishes."
"I don't think either of us blokes know even how to have children," I laughed, just as nervously.
"Papa?" the voice whispered.
Instead, he got up and walked out the door. I quickly apologized to Lindsey and the tech and followed him. But, he had long gone.
Our greatest adventure, indeed.
That's when John noticed something he never thought he would see from the great and seemingly invincible Sherlock Holmes.
Our guests applauded, Greg throwing in a few whistles. I turned to give the microphone back when Sherlock's voice echoed throughout the room.
I lumbered down the hall with the squealing and laughing girls still on my legs. When we got to the kitchen, they got off and scrambled into their chairs. Sherlock was at the stove, frying bacon.
"You and Daddy went out of the room a lot, you both look so sad, Uncle Mycroft looked sad, all of the doctors looked sad. I'm very sick, aren't I, Papa and Daddy?"
My heart breaking and tears pricking at my eyes, I laid aside of River as Sherlock crawled next to Indie. We joined arms over our daughters and cuddled them, as we had countless nights before.
"John, you know I was near the brink during this hospital stay, the doctors said so. I simply want you to be taken care of, for River and Charlotte to be taken care of." He said, pulling the navy blue blanket over him, "we always knew I would be first, I wasn't kind to myself in my youth, and now I'm reaping those rewards."
I ended up in the doorway to an ornately decorated room, dark wood paneled the walls, plush red carpeting lining the floor, pictures of royalty hung on the walls and sat on tables.
"Papa, look I drew a picture of Jack!" River said, running at me, waving her paper in the air.
"Don't you dare cover her face!" he growled threateningly.
The room clouded around me, only Indigo clear in my vision. Please, God, bring her back to me.
"The best day! Can we go to the park, Grandpapa?" she giggled.
"Ha, ha, very funny, I'm still bigger than you silly girls and I say let's get going! We're already going to be late!"
I picked up the glass of water Indigo had been drinking from and brought it to her lips, but she immediately shook her head. She looked at me with big eyes and a frown on her face.
She suddenly squirmed out of my arms and started to run circles around me, shrieking with laughter.
He came over to me and curled up next to me and put his mop of hair on my shoulder. I took his hand and brought it to my lips.
They had just settled into bed, Sherlock wrapping the nasal cannula around his ears and placing the prongs into his nose. He had to sleep with oxygen at night now, his lungs weak and struggling to provide him with enough oxygen on their own.
Once we were in the hallway, I asked, "So what did he say, Sherlock?"
The front door shut downstairs, River's cheerful voice echoing through the floor as she shouted her usual greeting to Mrs. Hudson. I heard her race up the stairs, plastic bags banging against the wooden steps.
I felt myself shaking, I turned to run away from whatever hell I had walked into, when a deep voice moaned,
"Maybe the extra time has given him a chance to solve this dreadfully simple case." He said, kissing us goodbye, before sweeping out the door and down the stairs.
She squirmed against my arms and I set her down. I held her hand as we walked, slowly, to the patch of grass without snow where the ducks gathered, waiting for someone to throw a piece of bread or two.
"Did you see her again, John?" Sherlock asked, matching the direction of my gaze.
"So, my little astronomers, what have you learned this evening?"
John's heart skipped a beat. Sherlock thought he was going to hit him.
And that's how we remained until morning.
"They are, Mrs. H, they are."
"I look ridiculous, John."
The two men and their girls slept soundly, wrapped warmly in blankets, the excitement and joy of a new day together waiting beyond them.
Yeah, I'll get right on it.
The time came for all those attending to get a turn looking in the massive telescope of the observatory. Luckily, it was a full moon and our girls could get the best view of their kingdom.
Damn him, he promised.
"That's…that's my girl," he said between laughs. He scooped up our giggling little girl and held her tight to him. She clung to Sherlock, her laughter joining his.
River had been staying in our room with us ever since we had said goodbye to Indigo. As I could not sleep, I spent most nights with her after she woke up screaming from nightmares, wiping her tears away and rocking her until she fell back to sleep, desperately wishing I could answer her pleas to bring her sister back home.
"Yeah! That was Indie?"
It was the first of many pictures without our Indigo Rose, that picture with the freshly painted lavender walls behind us, John smiling with a haunted look in his eyes that would never quite leave, River radiant with the sunflower in her hair, and I, my lips turned up in a mask-like smile.
"I'm nurturing their already vast intelligence, John, and you will nurture their noble hearts-"
"Yeah, let's do that! I have lots of those!"
"Thank you, Molly, we truly appreciate everything. Well, I think we're here, by the looks of the impatient little girl I see ahead of us." Molly laughed as we hurried to catch up to the others who were already waiting by the door of the dress shop.
River and Indie sat together on a bench with floral cushions. They were dressed in matching lilac dresses with puffed short sleeves that had frills of lilac lace at the collar and along the bottom of the dress. They wore white socks with lace at the top and shiny purple ballet flats. Both of them were wearing a wide brimmed white sunhat with a lilac ribbon tied around the middle of the hat. White satin gloves extended up to their elbows and their pinkies were out as they sipped from white teacups. The corners of their eyes were crinkled, the only indication they were smiling behind their cups of tea.
"Do you know how flowers get their colors, River?"
After we had washed all the dishes, we sat in the front room and listened to River read her book. Once she had finished, she stood up and sat in John's lap.
"I so enjoy seeing you blush, John," Sherlock said in his deep baritone, flashing his wonderful, smug half-smile. John laughed, tracing his fingers across the back of Sherlock's hand.
But soon, four would be three and our laughter would become quieter, our arms would be emptier, a little girl lost without her best friend, and fathers desperately trying to hold onto the memories of blonde ringlets and shining hazel eyes, alabaster skin and tiny dimples, the happiness, love, and dreams of a 6-year-old girl nicknamed Sunshine.
It was peaceful in 221B that night. Indie didn't wake up at all, for the first time in a long time. I woke up the next morning, nearly panicking when I realized I had slept through the night. I was ready to dash upstairs when I heard deep laughter and high pitched giggling coming from the front room. I found Sherlock and Indie in there, Indie running around the room in a long sleeved maroon dress as Sherlock blew bubbles for her.
"Sherlock?" John said, as gently as he could.
"Papa! Hurry up! Daddy's almost done cooking!"
One morning, John found himself at the bottom of the stairs, staring up at the door that he hadn't gone through in years. He crept up the stairs and opened the door, its hinges squeaking loudly.
"And I'm all better for Daddy's birthday!"
Two girls.
The noises were coming from our bedroom, the door locked and barricaded. Things were being thrown inside, the sounds of glass breaking and wood splintering mixing with screaming.
River delivered a healthy baby girl on a bitterly cold late November day. Michael came out of the room, shouting that he had a perfect daughter. Sherlock and John smiled, remembering their own shouts of joy when their girls were born. They held their new granddaughter later that day, her deep baby blue eyes wandering all over the room. They whispered to her, telling her how loved she was.
I picked the book back up and she continued to read to me, her curly pigtails bouncing as she enunciated each word. She was already reading at a Year 6 level and her pronunciation of difficult words was better than most adults. We had just started violin lessons and she played her scales and little songs without error. My little girl was an absolute genius.
I could feel Sherlock's chest tremoring behind me, as if he was trying to keep from laughing. I shoved my elbow into his bony chest and he seemed to compose himself almost immediately. He sat up, held his arms out, and said, "My, my, what a beautiful breakfast!"
"River!" She said as she struggled to get out of Sherlock's arms.
He walked quietly into the room, beds still neatly made, Indie's side still full of the trinkets and toys she had held most dear. Mrs. Hudson, Molly, and Greg kept the room tidy all of these years, knowing that it was too much for John or Sherlock.
Sherlock grumbled and settled himself into his seat, crossing his arms.
"Say astronaut!" The director shouted.
I kicked the door all the way open and crouched next to him.
"Daddy? I think I have to go to heaven and be an angel."
The girls would…River would be waking up soon. My heart dropped into my stomach and I swallowed back the intense nausea that overcame me. I stood up, my knees trembling slightly, and clumsily made my way out of the room.
A few minutes passed before he finally spoke coherently.
My heart began to race, the panic closing in on me as I collapsed on the edge of the tub, grasping onto the edge for dear life, tears running down my cheeks. I was already forgetting her, my sweet Indie.
I nodded against his head, pressing my cheek against it. I glanced at the corner of the room, catching a glimpse of Indie twirling in her dance outfit and tutu.
He groaned again, reaching his arm up to flip on the light next to him. I rolled over and draped my arm over him, kissing his ear gently.
They made their way back over to Indie, both gently placing kisses on her forehead. She reached her arms up and hugged Greg around the neck.
I hesitated, not wanting him to see me in such a state.
Papa, help me, help me Papa, please.
I shook my head after him, switching the telly to the news. An hour or so went by before Indie began to wake up.
"What have we got here, my darlings?" Sherlock asked, his hair blown back by the sea breezes.
I gently carried her down the stairs and placed her on the sofa, wrapping her in the pink blanket I had tucked her and River in with at the hospital all those months ago. Jack jumped up and laid at her feet, his customary spot these days. River appeared in the kitchen doorway and ran to her sister, smothering her with hugs and kisses. Sherlock was a few steps behind, a smile plastered on his face for our little girl. He bent down and kissed her forehead, running his hand along her hair.
"Sherlock! SHERLOCK!" I shouted into the phone. When he didn't answer, I threw the phone onto the floor and held onto the still seizing child in my lap. Indie's face was turned towards me, her jaw clenched shut, blood and saliva trickled out of the sides of her mouth, staining the Peter Pan collar of her white blouse, her limbs still rhythmically moving back and forth.
The details of the discussion were lost as a mind numbing word kept circulating around in my head.
"I love you!" She cheerily shouted.
"She's been doing great actually, she was a bit tired today, but that's to be expected sometimes, I suppose. We're just trying to keep everything as normal as we can, you know? She's going to school as long as she's able. We keep their bedtimes the same. River is doing well, running around, talking all of our ears off. They're both doing so well in school, I'm so proud, Sherlock is too, keeps saying we have two little geniuses on our hands and that we should enroll them in a higher grade so they don't get bored like he did. Sometimes he gets in one of his moods, and I'm always sure it's because of Indie's illness."
She nodded her head and held her arms out to me. I stood and picked her up, cradling her against me. It took less of my strength to pick her up each day as my little girl seemed to fade away before my very eyes. It was absolutely heart breaking. I had never hated anyone or anything so strongly as I did those cancerous cells that were sapping the life out of my Sunshine.
Sherlock handed the snail to River and turned to John, who sat with a bemused look on his face, and asked, "What do you think, John? Do you think we can add a sea snail to the family?"
"What happened last night is of no concern, John," Sherlock quickly cut off.
I turned around and kissed John, our lips moving tenderly against one another, our hands pulling each other close. I felt the warmth radiating off of John, warming my cold, thin body. He smelled of pine and peppermint with a hint of that wretched hospital still lingering.
Stopping in the doorway, I scooped Indie up in my arms and walked over to the couch, placed my cup on the coffee table, and picked up River in my other arm.
I laid down, holding onto her blanket that still smelled of lavender and strawberries, setting my head on the pillow where stray curls lay, curling up next to the space on the sheets that still held her shape.
Molly joined Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson came to our team.
But Indie's leg seemed to get better, Sherlock and River seemed to return to normal, and the whole thing was nearly forgotten. I chalked to whole thing up to a sprained ankle, an overprotective father, and our daughter simply copying her father's behavior.
After a time, the girls fell asleep in our arms and we took them upstairs, laying them in their beds and kissing them on their foreheads.
"I don't want Indie to stay here anymore, Daddy!" River said, with a kick of her foot against the bed.
"Alright, girls, off to bed I think, almost bedtime."
The case was out in the countryside, green rolling hills flying past them as they sat in the cab. Sherlock sat far away from John, his body tensed and his hands sitting on his lap balled into fists. John couldn't help but stare at him, and for the first time noticed the small details that held a world of secrets. The nose he always thought was perfect was slightly crooked. Sherlock's left arm was just a bit shorter than his right, as if it hadn't grown quite right. His right foot was turned in as if someone had twisted it. A scar peeked out from the bottom of Sherlock's hairline where a gash once was.
"I haven't looked at mine yet, John, I promised River I would wait."
I could smell the strawberry shampoo in our daughters' hair, feel the strong arms of my husband around me, and hear the giggles of our world between us. I never wanted to leave this moment, after all we had been through, we were happy and had the life we never imagined having, but could now not live without.
"You girls have the loudest little dog I have ever seen," Greg laughed.
"Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, Indigo's heart is failing. I believe all we can do at this point is keep her as comfortable as possible," the doctor stated, her sad, brown eyes fixed upon us. I searched for some semblance of hope in them, but I could find none.
"I didn't know what they would like," he answered, very quietly.
"And then the guy says to me, Greg, why'd you sign your name as 'Gavin'? Bloody Sherlock Holmes has me forgetting my own bloody name."
"Look, there's the butterfly!" she shouted. The men looked up to see the yellow wings hovering near them.
John flipped the light on and was shocked by the flood of tears running down Sherlock's cheeks. His bloodshot eyes were rimmed with red, his nose red from where he had been rubbing it.
The rain drummed hard against the windows, making winding trails down the glass that flashed brightly with the passing cars below. The flat was quiet, Molly had taken River out shopping for the evening, giving us our first night alone in quite a while. I had gotten us Chinese takeout and lit a candle, reminiscent of our first night together so long ago. Sherlock and I spent time in each other's arms, lying in our bed in the dim room, talking about those far away days that didn't seem real anymore.
Sherlock grumbled to himself, his knees cracking as he stood up from the chair. He ran his hand through his greying curls and went into their bedroom.
She ran over to where Indie was playing with a few dolls and sat. Content that the girls were occupied, I walked into the kitchen and found the world's only consulting detective standing at the counter, holding a bag of frozen peas to his bottom.
"Calm down, John, they're the most beautiful girls in the world, their pictures will be impeccable." I said as I stood the girls up in front of me and fixed their dresses where they had been mussed.
"And another thing, Sherlock, how incredibly rude of you to just bolt out of that room without even a goodbye or thank you. You missed seeing one of your daughters…"
River nodded and went upstairs, Sherlock following soon after, Indie falling asleep in his arms.
"Daddy, can you play our song for us?" She eagerly asked, feet swinging against John's legs.
I remember the nurse handing you to me wrapped in a pink swaddle soon after you were born, your hair peeking out from the tiny pink hat Mrs. Hudson had knitted. I looked at you, and you looked at me, your newborn eyes squinting in the light. That day, I saw the world in those big beautiful eyes and I knew then that you would change the world, you would move mountains, you would be amazing.
Cancer…cancer…cancer.
The silence between us was broken by little feet padding down the hallway as River came back from using the bathroom. "Is Indie okay, Papa?" She asked as she climbed into Sherlock's lap. I sat down in my chair. "Oh yes, she's just having a bit of a nap, I'll get her up when Aunt Molly gets here so we can go shopping."
They buried John next to his Indigo Rose, underneath the willow tree that grew so green in the summer sun. River wheeled Sherlock close to the black granite that rose from the snow-white ground. He placed a single sunflower and a long-forgotten aluminum cane on the grave. River Grace and Charlotte Indigo stood quietly on either side of Sherlock, tears tracking down their reddened cheeks, their curls blowing in the harsh winter winds.
"You should try to take a nap too, sweetheart, it's been a long day and you don't want to be sleepy during your party do you?" I asked her.
“It is going to be uncomfortable for you,” he said.
“But at what cost?” I sobbed.
I came back to reality to find myself tied very tightly to a straight back chair with my legs spread wide and my arms rather uncomfortably tied behind on the open slats of the back of the chair. I was still naked.
All this time tight around his waist was a corset, which pushed his chest up giving him the slight illusion of breasts. It was so tight I was surprised he hadn’t passed out for lack of breath.
“I was coming to get Doctor Watson to examine a body that was found apparently shot to death in the house across the street from yours.”
I took both of his hands and led him to the bedroom where I laid him down on the bed and proceeded to start with kissing his long fingers and then worked my way through the pattern of scars on his body murmuring words of love and admiration as I did so. He responded with moans and groans of appreciation.
By the end of the first month, he could be sold as a valet and body slave to either sex. He had learned the ins and outs of dressing men and women. Mary had been very pleased with his abilities for brushing hair and massage. Those long fingers of his turned out to be very talented as did his tongue much to her delight.
“Shall we go see what my brother has sent to us at no little cost?”
I shook my head hard, “NO!”
Suddenly they vanished until the bodies had been found by the local constable who had gotten complaints about the smells that came wafting down wind. Not only had the owners been found but the bodies of eight other men and women had as well. Mycroft managed to get the names of the slaves and we got the bodies to the families or what remained.
I sat back on my heels at the tirade coming from Sherlock’s lips. It didn’t sound like him at all. The voice was modulated higher than his rich speaking voice. He squeaked in a falsetto that tore at my heart.
I could not move. I could not speak. I just lay there a shivering lump.
Sherlock shuttered and whimpered.
“Not a sound,” came a voice that I hadn’t heard from Holmes before. I had no idea who I was dealing with.
Yes I am waiting to hear from my beta about the next bit which we are going back and forth on because of adult content and how far is too far. I want you to enjoy this not be reviled by it.
Holmes gave a big yawn and rubbed his eyes. Mary and I met each other’s gaze and settled down with one of us on either side of him. The three of us drifted off to sleep not knowing what was to follow.
“I am sorry Watson. I am so sorry. I should release you from your contract considering how I behaved. I am not worthy of owning you.”
“You speak their lingo?”
He shook his head, “No Mary, you are anything but. I just…I just can’t…perform the way you both wish me to.”
“Oh Watson, what you do to me,” he said taking my hand and placing it on his crotch.
The Boy at the sight in front of him came onto the Tiger’s back and buttocks.
It took us almost two weeks to get to Rampur. After a day of Moran yelling at us and making noise that could cause us problems with other tribes, I gagged him. That left him with just glaring.
“Mycroft agreed to the names Mary. They will always carry you with them. I shall miss you.”
I shook my head, “No, Mycroft has it.”
My arms were released as were my feet and I almost fell to the floor when I was caught and led over to a cot. My backside was tended to almost lovingly. I lay there just enjoying the silence in the room and in my head.
“Don’t or Can’t Doctor?” he growled at me.
I groaned and looked at my watch. Half past seven, which was late for me.
I gestured to my body, “This? This is nothing.”
He stepped aside and I saw Moran enter with his right arm in a sling and right behind him was Moriarty dressed as a proper English woman and being dragged on a leash behind her was Sherlock.
A blindfold went over his eyes and a pair of thick headphones emitting white noise over his ears.
“I have an idea,” I said looking at Holmes and the straight jacket.
He proceeded to half drag the man out of the room with Seb following holding the hood leaving Sherlock and John alone with Sherlock’s pet.
I tried to move but found that I was a mass of pain in a man’s body.
John woke up and propped his head on his hand, “Hi there.” He leaned over and kissed Greg on the mouth with gentle pressure.
I watched as the light vanished from her eyes and I knew she was no more.
John was totally knackered. Between fighting the restrains, Sherlock’s insane behavior, and his release by Sherlock, his body wanted, no, demanded sleep. He found himself drifting as Sherlock stroked his body lovingly.
“I will deal with you later,” he said.
“You may remove the blindfold,” he said in perfect English.
“Yes Ma’am,” I said.
At the sight of John restrained on the bed, Greg tried to pounce but found himself pulled short by the leash attached to his collar.
Delek walked in at that point, “You did Mr. Holmes. You tried to tear him from limb to limb.”
He could feel that itch starting in the back of his head, which had become his warning that he was about to go into heat.
Yama helped him to the pallet he had been lying on and held him while Holmes came apart.
“No and you haven’t answered my question.”
Moriarty was in Northern India in Rampur awaiting Moran’s return with the drugs and some new slaves that he had brokered.
Toby shivered remember the visit from John in the night.
“They hacked the security camera,” said Sherlock, “Dammit.”
“You lads are becoming almost more trouble than you are worth,” said the older man leaning heavily on a rather ornate cane, “Now I want you to hand your clothes over to Sam here so we don’t have a repeat of your previous escape.”
I smiled and took the bottle of oil we kept for our intimate activities. I let him watch as I used my fingers to finish preparing myself for him. I placed myself with the tip of his cock just reaching my entrance and slowly sank down on him allowing him to feel every inch of me. I slowly rode him to orgasm as he expressed his appreciation with language only a sailor could truly appreciate.
“Yep,” said William who was intently looking at two men who were walking towards our vantage point but stopped at the village line and turned back.
I remembered meeting her briefly at some point during my preparing to find my Master. I hadn’t even thought of her looks and mine but he was right that he picked a person that would make James look like his mother.
“And I you Watson. Probably one of the reasons we are so suited for each other.”
“Good. I’ll tell them we are attended their soirée.”
I put my hands behind my back and closed my eyes as Holmes rubbed me through the cloth that covered my genitals.
“Did you find out where the party was this time? I need to get my cock into some warm wetness to keep it from freezing off?”
“Being raised with yours.”
He pulled me into a hug, “My faithful servant.”
“Ah John, not going to have you cock up the experiment since it seems to be going so well. So I will help you.”
He got up from the pile and said, “Go take a shower and come to my bed. You all deserve a reward for your good efforts.”
“Oh it is not me who’s a berk John. It’s you. I took a sample of your blood and discovered that you were meant to be an Omega. And given circumstances, I believe you were meant to be MY Omega.”
“All right, let’s try another question, where is Sherlock Holmes?” I removed the head scarf and showed him my face.
“Get ‘em off Sherlock now or you are going to be losing some buttons and possibly you shirt.”
Sherlock pulled out his phone and dialed a number, “Brother, apparently we need to see each other again today. Meet me at the flat in 20 minutes……I don’t care who you are talking to. No, it has nothing to do with that matter. 18 minutes and counting.”
Moran pulled out a knife and ripped off any cloth I had left on my body.
As we started to sweat, I outlined to Holmes the plan that Mary and I came up with. His objections were what I expected.
The effects were swift and Mycroft succumb to the drugged arms of Morpheus.
“Better?”
She gripped my hand very hard as a contraction passed through her body.
The chief of this group had great loyalty to Mycroft and the Marketplace but none for England who he saw as the oppressor. I had to say that he did change my thinking about why the English were there. He gave me use of one of his body slaves to both take care of me and give me some standing among his men. After a few knife fights, I had earned both his and his tribes respect. He made sure that I had the pick of the horses he had bred. I found a good mare I named Lucy who was not the biggest horse but she was one of the fastest I had ever seen.
“What if this isn’t directed at Mycroft?”
That stopped Holmes in his rant. He regrouped quickly, “Come along Watson. Don’t dawdle.”
But there were times, while I was trapped in this nightmare, that I heard other voices speaking in strange languages. I could feel cold water being put to my lips and the encouragement to drink. I did what I could for the voices but it was very hard. I tried to tell them that I could hear them. I tried to get up only to be restrained.
As he felt himself being pulled under he heard Sherlock say, “I do love you brother mine, but you can be such an idiot.”
I nodded and shut my notebook and went to pack. Not even thinking about how we were going to be gone and there at the same time. I figured my Master had a plan and I best to follow his lead.
“English only you pig. You know the rules and I am not getting tossed out because you can’t follow them.”
“I never thought I would have a child. It was not in my nature. John you have given me a gift I thought I would never have.”
I shook my head, “Holmes you do not know what you are asking of me or what you are getting yourself into. I have lived this with every fiber of my being for what seems my entire life. But you, you are so use to be in total control of the situation and slavery is a total loss of that control.”
By the looks of it Sherlock was trying his best not to scream but his willpower gave out after a while and Mycroft watched and listened as his brother pleaded and screamed his name.
We spent time with our Uncles and learned much from both of them.
Father brought him home for dinner that evening and we questioned him about his adventures and his life and our Uncle Sherlock. I watched him very carefully and noticed something that I had seen before in the behavior of others in the house.
His brain put the sound together rather quickly since he had been on the other side of this scenario more than once.
I found out through a fellow slave that the Baron had made an offer for me that Moriarty had refused and informed the Baron I was not for sale. The Baron decided that this was a challenge and kept using me in his demonstration but he started adding pleasure to the pain. He would watch my reaction to things very carefully. He seemed to be cataloging me.
“Nothing!” he exclaimed.
Mycroft and Sherlock worked out the rest of the details of our charade. The role we were to play was ‘Johan’ previous owners who had fallen on hard times so we were selling our best asset.
“I honestly don’t remember much of the past week. If I did something…”
I watched Sherlock dragging his left leg and hunched over follow Yama through a door that I had not been through.
“They were abducted by four men in a dog cart. The stable hand saw what was happening and tried to raise the alarm but was killed before he was heard. I am afraid that the boy that they used to lure the boys out of the commons room is either the son of one of the abductors or dead at this point. The longer we sit here, the further our sons are being removed from us. I asked Mycroft to think again about who might want to do him harm or something that would be a detriment to his job….” his voice trailed off.
“It won’t work Sherlock. I’m a Beta. I can’t smell any of your Alpha pheromones.”
I knelt up and placed my hands on my knees.
We waited while the cart covered with a tarp went past us. The man driving it did not look familiar.
“Do you want him to suck you off?”
“Then what good are you?”
“You feel your lungs closing up, you get up and wake me,” he said.
“I highly doubt it since he came by the flat to drop something off for John and was astonished he was not there because he said he would meet him at the flat.”
“No Mistress”
“So Hamish, by the look of you, you have been in service for quite sometime. Do you want to escape or are you one who will tell me that you like where you are?”
I giggled, “Mycroft said the same thing to me about you.”
“I understand Watson and I release you. We will void the contract when we get back to London and you will find someone who can take you in hand the way you deserve.”
It was then he really looked at me and saw me for who I was.
By the end of the second month, I felt that he had succeeded to a point that he could be sold.
“You’re with child?” I said in astonishment.
He kissed me on both cheeks and sent me on my way. I spent most of the rest of the night with his slave giving him the finer points of oral sex for both sexes since he also serviced the Chief’s wives.
They entered the sitting room.
“Yes,” I said through the tears that would not stop falling down my face.
“A little more myself than I have been,” said Holmes.
“You will be asked to do things that you find pointless but yours is not to question why but to do the task given to you to the best of your abilities.”
“Sherlock Holmes,” I said.
He crossed to the bed and knelt down so his face was at my level. He took my offered hand and with tears in his eyes, he let out a string of apologies for what had happened.
“Gentleman, this is an extreme spanking demonstration,” said John, “That is why we have the kidney belt in place to keep the subject from moving and possibly doing themselves injury.”
At some point Holmes woke up and I fed him through the bars of muzzle which half way through I gestured for Yama to leave which he did reluctantly.
‘So the other man is in charge,’ came the thought.
“Since I found you? Almost two weeks. We were in Verkhoyansk for about a week before we could move on with the tour to here.”
“Then why isn’t my Uncle Sherlock here?” he continued.
I was asked about his valet skills and what he had done for my household.
“Arms out,” came the command.
I watched as he breathed in and out. His rib cage expand and contract. I watched it pick up as he tried to figure out what was going to happen next. He knew I was in the room but he was listening hard to hear where I was.
I nodded.
He whined and backed up a bit.
He dropped to his knees and pulled my cock out of my pants. He proceeded to lick and suck me to hardness then got up on his knees and swallowed me down using his tongue and mouth to add pressure to my cock. I yanked back from him. And he dropped to the ground and said with such fear in his voice, “Please Sir! Please! What did I do wrong? Please correct my bad behavior.”
He looked at me very carefully and then said, “So it is over?”
He went home to find that Sherlock had left him a note that he was off on a case.
I composed a cryptic letter to Mycroft that read like I was catching him up on my travels and what I had seen. But the underlying message was giving him the information of where I was and where I was going.
“I think that might be a good idea,” she said.
“Have you called him?”
“Oh don’t underestimate yourself Tiger. You have a very devious brain,” said John.
He responded to this and seemed to relax.
I took a sip of the water and then a few more.
It was the perfect solution.
There was another sharp tug of the hair, “Get out of your head. Talk to me. I know you are worried about the wager. But you have to TELL me why you are so scared of this task. I have honestly given you harder.”
“Gentlemen,” said Yama, “We have some news for you that came by caravan.”
And then there were the boys. Those two beautiful babes that would grow up not knowing their mother’s kind hand. I would not know my son except at a distance. He would never know that I was his father.
I laughed, “Oh be careful Mycroft or I will end up owning you.”
Zaram pointed to the cave entrance, “This is only going to buy us a little time.”
The hood obscuring my view was removed and I found myself in what look to me to be a medieval torture chamber with various pieces of apparatus that I could only guess the purpose of.
Sherlock let John help him out of the sling and over to a waiting cot.
“You listening to me?”
I learned quickly which set of words seemed to set him off. I couldn’t call him Sherlock or he would have a fit. I couldn’t form my mouth around Shirley without my stomach wanting to exit through my mouth. So I worked my way to Sherl which didn’t set him off and I could say it.
I shouted as I was taken down the passage and stopped once we went around the corner. A monk slammed a heavy door with a sound that reverberated through the hallways.
The man leaned it as if to help him with the menu, “Your property, fine choice of words. His mouth looks absolutely luscious. Tell me what is that mouth like moving on your cock.”
William came into the world first with James following quickly behind him. They both gave strong cries after entering the world. The nurses cleaned them up and swaddled them efficiently.
“But what can be done?” I asked.
I took his head in my hands and kissed his forehead, “I wish for your touch.”
I hope you enjoy this chapter. There is a lot of information and hints given as to what is going to happen next.
“What did you say to me?”
“Lessons?”
Mary was most helpful in this. She had him grow his hair out a bit and stop putting anything in it. She also got a hold of some henna and put that in his hair bringing a red tinge to it. Which, surprisingly, matched the beard she had him grown. I showed him how to maintain it and trim it. Between that and forcing him to eat regularly, he didn’t look like himself any more.
Jim felt the pressure ease off his neck.
“I have no plans to end my life. At the time my wife died, my children were taken from me and my master was presumed dead. Now I know my master lives and I will see my children when I go back to England. I have so much to live for.”
“James, where are we?” he asked sounding very confused.
John nodded.
Seb went around the block to find the back entrance to the place and let Sherlock off there.
John Watson felt like a lucky man indeed.
Lord Willingham was there and he sat next to me supporting me through out.
Getting to Kabul took much longer than I would have liked. It took me almost two months to get there. My fear was that Moriarty’s moving feast would have gone onto it next stop or that Moran was sent there for Moriarty’s sick plan and Sherlock was in France or Germany or Turkey or G-d knows where.
Hope someone is still reading.
John smiled, climbed on, and started to ride Greg’s cock. Sherlock reached around and stuck his finger in John’s hole then put it near Greg’s lips. Greg opened his mouth and started licking the slick off his finger.
He steeled himself and resolved not to move no matter what they do.
I feared for Holmes and was afraid of Holmes at the same time.
“Apparently this was a special one from the elder Mr. Holmes sent for Holmes the younger.”
“Mary, do I need to take him in hand?” he asked.
After Sherlock’s knot released John, the two men got dressed and hurried back to Baker Street for the rest of John’s heat.
He whispered, “I don’t want you to be disappointed in me.”
“Can I see those boys that were in the room when the note was delivered?”
I walked back to the room and much to my horror I didn’t see Holmes in the room.
‘Watch me’
He leapt up from the mat he was on and went to take me in his arms only to be stopped by Yama.
“Please remove your clothes and lay down on your stomach on your cot,” he said.
“Well you made him what he is today,” said Seb tipping his glass in tribute to John.
After a while, I helped him sit up on the footstool and poured him a glass of water from the pitcher on the table.
The two looked at each other and then back to Sherlock and shook their heads.
He didn’t give Toby time to adjust but started dragging him to the door. As Sherlock put his thumb on the pad to unlock the door, Toby righted himself and followed Sherlock to the elevator.
He picked up the stack of papers and tossed them into the fire.
John could see him work out what John had figured out.
“We found a thorn in your thigh. We think that is how it entered your system.”
Three days later he could feel his mind clearing finally. He looked at his swollen belly and felt Sherlock’s cock still in his ass. He could hear that light wheeze that informed him that Sherlock was deep asleep.
“Hold it,” cam the command and a plug was inserted in my ass fixing the contents with in.
“Watson,” I heard and opened my eyes to see Holmes looking back at me.
Sherlock was curled up on the floor but I could see that he was peeking out at me.
“Your willing and abject slave.” I said.
He heard the front door slam and lock. Two sets of footsteps came up the stairs. He recognized the tread.
Sherlock unwound the leash from the cage and said, “Come on boy.”
“Yes Sir, “ came the reply.
“No, you are not safe right now,” he said with grave concern in his voice.
They parked in John’s spot and put up his parking pass.
He ate the rest of his food and declared that he was tired. I helped him settle back into the bed and he slept for the first time unrestrained.
I knew that if I didn’t everyone would lose. I was trying to think of a way out.
Jim looked at him in incredulity and pulled at the restraints holding him to the bed.
Holmes had serious trepidation of leaving the monastery until Delek was sure he was not a danger to me or anyone else.
I sighed. I picked up the blacking brush from the floor and returned to the short stool I had been sitting on. I adjusted the tools I need for the task at hand around me, picked up the shoe that I had rescued from Holmes’ wrath, closed my eyes, and proceeded to clean, blacken, and polish the shoe without opening my eyes once.
He shuttered, “Enough and not enough at the same time. It started out which what seemed to be a normal Marketplace sale but then…”
And his attention I did have.
“Oh if I was going to poison you…..oh wait I did poison you but not this time.”
I muttered apologies all the while. Trying to find the right words that would satisfy him and stop the punishment. But also knowing that I deserved every blow that was raining down on my body.
Holmes seemed in pain.
‘Quiet!’ came the command in German from a second voice, ‘You do not get to decide what YOU want to do so you can bloody well clean it up for the Master. I will attend to the other two. Get it ready and put it in the blue room.’
Eventually my legs gave out and I fell managing to drop Sherlock before toppling over as shear exhaustion took over.
Seb nodded. Jim glowered at Sherlock unable to say anything due to the gag in his mouth.
The man untied me.
He shook his head. I sighed and got the collar that was on the table and buckled it around his neck.
Haven't forgotten it or you.
John waited to see the reaction. If there were empathy or sympathy then he would be out of here in half an hour. If they decided to play tough, it was going to take a little longer. Also he would have to dislocate his thumbs and he hated doing that.
“How am I going to do that?”
“Let me see the hair,” said Sherlock.
Toby heard the door open behind him.
“Well at least one of you remember your manners,” said Molly with a dismissive wave.
John sighed and went limp. Better to have Sherlock get over whatever bee was in his bonnet than fight him when he was acting like this.
I took two steps towards and found myself with my hand back to hit her. She sat up properly and awaited the blow.
The body moved before the mind could follow. Arms went behind the back and legs spread a little more than shoulder length. He grabbed the Boy’s cock and put the ring around the base threading the balls through with a rough tug.
He grinned an evil grin and looked at his iPhone. He decided the man on his far right was not uncomfortable enough. He took his finger and up the ‘volume’. The man tried not to groan around his gag.
I should have seen it coming. I should have known.
It was the missing stable hand that had been bludgeoned to death and then garroted for good measure. The look of horror on his face was not one that I would soon forget.
I watched Holmes come back to himself as the sedative wore off. They had doses him with his opiates while he was unconscious to keep his withdrawal symptoms at bay while we gave my idea a go.
Toby jumped at the sound.
“For what?”
“How so?”
“And who might you be my lads?”
She grabbed his head and kissed him then forced him to his knees.
We left the palace and headed off quickly to the north.
I hope you do too. Comments and Kudos are greatly appreciated. I think I am not moving this along at a glacial pace other than my ability to post it in a timely fashion.
Sherlock grinned. It had worked. He settled in with his pets. Greg now smelled ‘right’ to Sherlock. Oh the plans he had for them he thought right before he followed them to slumber.
“Master! Master!,” he said. The affected voice broke my heart, “I didn’t come willingly. They kidnapped me! Please don’t punish. Please don’t….” and he was reduced to sobs and choking sounds as Moriarty grabbed the collar around the neck and pulled up on it bring Sherlock to his tiptoes.
“Well, well look what the cat dragged in. Good work Tiger.”
I tried to relax and settle my mind.
I looked at the hand on my crotch. Then my world came crashing in.
He struggled to his feet.
“Yes, you will indeed,” he said closing his robe and snapping his fingers.
They got back to Baker Street and Greg pulled his placard that allowed him to park just about anywhere he wanted.
“What’s wrong Sherlock?”
We continued on our way. I had a rough idea of which direction I was going and it was away from help. Interestingly enough have Moriarty with us kept Sherlock calm and easier to managed. I tried tapering off the drugs but after the second seizure I knew this was not the time or the place to try.
Sherlock looked in horror and was about to jump himself when I grabbed him and wrestled him to the ground. I knocked him out and slung him over my shoulders.
My whole world collapsed and I found myself on the floor.
I felt William nodded in agreement.
William tapped me twice on the shoulder in acknowledgement of what I had said.
Then it struck me. Those dreams might not have been dreams.
“William,” I said in a low voice.
He gestured to his tent, “And I think I have a treat for you as well.”
John handed Sherlock his mug and sat down in his chair. Sherlock stood to go to his place by John but John put up his hand to stop him.
“Watson?” came the voice from the other side of the room.
“Great,’ said John, “let me dry off and we will eat. Why don’t you set it up Greg?”
John sat on the arm of the chair and pulled Sherlock in for a hug, “There, there. It is over. You survived. Your brother will survive. You have earned his life. And I think he has learned his lesson.”
He opened his eyes and found that Sherlock had put the chair back at the table and gone into the kitchen. From the sounds emanating from that room, it seemed that he was doing something to keep himself occupied.
Giving up all pretense for stealth, we ran for the woods and kept running trying to put as much distance between ourselves and the manor we had found ourselves in.
I went in and kissed her forehead.
“John Watson,” he said very formally, “slave of Sherlock Holmes, I order you on the behalf of your Master to do as we say and take charge of your Master’s health and happiness.”
Seb stepped into John’s line of site.
He put back on his disguise and I wondered how I hadn’t seen him underneath it.
When one of the hands touched his balls he almost came. But he managed to get himself under control. He remembered the rule ‘You cum, we stop’. And stopping would be bad at this point.
“HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!” yelled our jailor upon seeing me, “Smith, go get the governor and be quick about it.”
“You have questions,” said Delek in rather accented English.
“Forfeit my dear,” said a voice.
I keep winding this around in my brain and I am hoping that I am getting my story across.
“You have an idea,” said John, “I know that look. What is turning in your head?”
I went to the sideboard and poured him a measure of scotch and presented it to him like I had to Mycroft. He took the glass and looked at me, “We will find them and bring them home. You have my solemn oath on that.”
“It’s a place to start,” said Jim, “Sherl, you going with us or going to go off on your own.”
“Who are you?”
He put his Tiger on all fours and ran his hand lightly on the marks that his Boy had made on the flesh, “Nice grouping Boy.”
As the coffin left the church, I walked out with it to people expressing their sympathies at my wife’s passing and the loss of my children as well.
Greg helped him out of his top and Sherlock placed a hand in John’s crotch just stroking his cock gently and lovingly.
And I found myself relaxing in his arms after cleaning us up.
That was the turning point for both of us. I started to heal from my injuries. And Holmes healed from his both body and soul.
I shook my head, “It wasn’t you.”
“How many strings did you have to pull for that one?” I asked with frustration.
John signed again ‘not your fault.’ He smiled weakly from under the oxygen mask.
“I do apologize for the restraints but they were necessary so you would not hurt yourself or others. You were in a bit of a state.”
“Pardon me?” Yama asked.
Yama and I stepped out of the room.
“If you don’t want to talk about it…”
“One year 2 months and 3 days before I found you the first time,” I said.
“It was Mary’s last wish Mycroft. You said you owed me a debt then pay it by honoring the name she gave him on her deathbed.”
Even though he was forcing it, I did not like the sound of his lungs at all. There was that rattle which was a precursor to an infection. We did need to get out of here sooner than later.
They were seated in overstuffed chairs in what Seb called the playroom.
Sherlock’s mouth snapped shut.
Shortly there after other slaves entered and gave the slaves to be sold something to eat and drink. Some were lead off to relieve themselves. Others were taken care of.
I lifted my hand and he didn’t react.
She was right but it was a lot to take in.
Wilson took the first babe and put it in my arms. I looked at the face and the nose and knew I was looking at the next Lord Holmes. He was the spitting image of my beloved Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you have that note?” asked Holmes.
“You are dead according to the world. You and your companion were unfortune victims of a gas explosion at the warehouse. There was enough DNA evidence there to ID you. No one is looking for you. You have been mourned and buried. I will bring you a snapshot of the lovely headstone they had carved for you. You don’t exist. If you happen to die, then I promise you I will put you under that headstone.”
“BASIL!” John shouted harshly.
As spring came to the mountains, Holmes and I started planning our trip back home. Or rather I was planning and Holmes was coming up with reasons why he couldn’t go back.
He sat back on his haunches and asked, “If there is anything else I can take care of?”
“What did you do?”
She held out a hand to me and said, “I am afraid we were never properly introduced, my name is James Moriarty and I have gone to a lot of trouble to get you right where you are slave.”
The two men looked at each other uncomfortably and then back at Holmes, “We honestly don't know. All of the servants have been questions and none have shown any sign of lying. Their fellow students have no inkling of where they are. The only clue we have is a note that was delivered to the boys,” said the Head Master
I saw Yama walking towards me with a look on his face that told me that he did not have good news for me.
Moran did as he had been ordered.
Seb nodded and looked at her with such love and adoration. I had a feeling that is the way I looked at Sherlock when in the same position. He was her abject slave in all things.
“I know you are trying to keep me safe. But we are fine here.”
Pure light smut that does not push the plot forward but I thought the boys deserved it.
“That cart has a rather distinctive wheel making it stand out a bit from the normal comings and goings. We now know that they took off towards the north and I believe that if we take some horses to the crossroads, we can still find some evidence of the direction that they took.”
John grabbed a hose and made sure everything on the floor went down the drain.
Sherlock shrugged and removed his shoes putting them into one of the lockers on the wall. His clothes followed leaving him naked except the dark brown collar permanently locked on his neck.
“At this juncture I do believe that you are innocent in John’s abduction.”
“We have been recreating all the lovely terrible things that you did to Jim. I do admit you are quite creative when it comes to torture. I even learned a thing or two.”
This chapter has been written and rewritten about eight times. I would get into it and realized it wasn't working so I had to back out and try again. This is where it landed to continue the story.
“As what? I don’t see either of these men as studs and we do have a level that we pride ourselves in as to quality. Only one of them might qualify as a bear and we would have to feed him into it.”
“Are you insane?” he yelled, “A dead slave is a useless slave. This one is too important. He is the key.”
Contrary to popular believe a masochist does not enjoy all forms of pain. There is the pain we find erotic that can send us sailing on a sea of pleasure. But there is other pain, which is not fun or erotic. There is a world of difference between a fine beating and stubbing ones toes. There is the pain of discipline, which can be pleasurable, but more often than not is teaching. And there is pointless pain. Pain that just hurts and confuses and makes one very pliable.
We sat with our minds going to darker and darker places.
“Which you have done an admirable job of,” said Mycroft, “I found that I didn’t have to worry about my brother knowing he was in your care and that was a great relief indeed. Thus another debt I owe you.”
“I know that better than most,” I said.
I turned to Sebastian and said, “You are going to get my horse and two others ready to go. I want supplies along with clothes, the drugs needed for Sherl, and my medical kit back and repacked with extra bandages and the like. We will ride out of here and you will not follow or Moriarty does not survive the day.”
As I read between the lines of the telegram my stomach fell to my knees.
“Shirley, I need you to get back in bed for me. Can you do that?”
And they did it again and again. Each time John asking if Sherlock was done and Sherlock denying he was. Mycroft felt a cold sweat break out across his body as he wondered what damage this was doing to his brother. He had lost count of the number of times that Sherlock had been doused. How could he lose count?
He watched the window across the street for a while and then had us draw back and observe the room.
Holmes pulled two keys out of the envelope and handed me one of them. we unlocked the trunks and found that Mycroft had resupplied us for the journey home. There was clothing of various weights, under garments, a gun for me, medical supplies, money, and carefully packed in Holmes’ trunk was his precious violin.
John pinched his nose to collect his thoughts. He said very carefully trying not to let the frustration he was feeling into his voice, “We have talked about this. I am a Doctor who has a job that I like and brings in income so I can pay my share of the flat and the rest of the bills.”
Sherlock sighed and picked up the envelope and menu and gave it to the man. He quickly signaled that this was the second guy.
No one seemed to be looking at us. They seemed much more interested in making deals quickly and getting their purchases. There was a lot of rapid talk and shouting as there is in any market place.
“The situation is different John. You know that somewhere in that silly head of yours. You have seen how far he has come.”
“What has my brother been up to that might irritate someone so much that they would seize his children?”
I hope you will stick with it and the outcome will work for you.
He placed one finger in and quickly followed it with two then three. I moaned my pleasure for his ears to hear.
John had the driver park the car in the garage. This allowed Sherlock to take his pet up in the elevator that was installed there.
“Now,” he said as he stroked Shirley’s hair, “What are we going to do about Moran? I would like all my property back.”
“What is wrong?” Yama asked.
The trip to Bart’s was rather tense.
The pounding at the door woke all of us up from a sound sleep. We were pulled from our beds and dragged into the street. Moran was half asleep when he realized what was happening and he came to full wakefulness or as much as his brain would allow because of the drugs we had been using to keep him docile. He started shouting that he was being held against his will and he wanted to press charges for kidnapping and assault.
“It’s all right. I am glad to see you here again.”
“Who’s Leslie?” I asked.
John snapped his fingers and Mycroft watched as Jim crawled over to him on all fours and then knelt up looking at John with adoration that would done a Saint proud.
“Good. Glad to see you back with us Doctor Watson. It was touch and go there for a while.”
“Who was here?” he asked with concern.
He helped me off of him and said with a chuckle,  “Good thing we are in a bath house.”
“He doesn’t have a name yet,” I said, “he hasn’t earned it.”
In short order the two men entered the room. The Camera man was holding a portable male urinal.
That there was a carriage and escort waiting for us at the dock informed us that something terrible had happened. We were rushed back to London and the Diogenes Club in what I considered record time.
“To feed my Master the food he likes. That is all. It is helpful that you will be doing the cooking because I have many tasks I have to do each day as his valet. Right now I need to put out his clothes for this evening and set up for his daily shave. Do you have a pitcher I can use to bring some warm water up for that?”
Sherlock typed, “Yes”
While he was doing that, Mycroft read the letter aloud.
He took my shaft in hand and started stroking it with what I would call a rub and tug method.
The next day I found sitting a bit of an adventure but it allowed me to concentrate on what was happening around me.
“Mostly the property and mine owners in the north of England. It closed loopholes allowing fair wages for the workers who were under a system that was basically serfdom. But it allowed for the owners to sell to new markets that would only be open to them if they abided by the new law. It also cut off some markets that they were selling to illegally since there is now a legal means of trade in place,” said Lorna.
“Watson this is not…”
“As in the real Mafia Seb,” she said handing the papers to Sherlock, “Apparently something went missing and they want Sherlock to find it for them before time runs out.”
They restored his hearing first. He would react to sound but did not seem to understand what was going on around him. The only reaction that he did have was to my voice and it was not a good one. I said his name and he had a fit to the point that he almost dislocated his shoulders from thrashing about. After that I didn’t say a word around him.
"Daddy?"
The sting of a belt came down on the little boy's back. He couldn't help but cry out.
Sherlock abruptly stood up and crossed towards the front room.
Nothing.
"Well that's what I want to be, and I already read lots of books about it so I think I'm ready." She said proudly.
I gathered her into my arms. Her cheeks were pink with the cold and she was breathless, but her eyes were filled with joy and she had a silly grin on her face. I pulled her hat down over her eyes, her laughter ringing out. She pulled the hat back up and set her nose against mine.
"Oh, it's giving me a bit of trouble, but nothing I haven't managed before."
We stopped at the entrance of their classroom and River dashed in with a hug and kiss.
She picked her head up, her eyes puffy and red, her sweet face so sorrowful.
I felt for a pulse again and looked at my watch through a haze of tears. Finding none, I pronounced her.
"Just for tonight, girls, then back to your beds tomorrow."
I whispered, "Now where would they get such an idea?" He replied, "When we visited Molly, she was talking on the phone with her mother and said she was planning on making breakfast for her father for Father's Day, I'm assuming that's where they conceived the idea."
"Sherlock, it's alright," John tried again. This time he sat back on his heels and waited for Sherlock to move. He had evaluated countless victims of abuse and he knew that they needed to make all of the moves. They needed that control that had been viciously taken from them.
Sherlock and I laid with her throughout the night, both of us wide awake. Indie's breathing was labored and her O2 saturation continued to drop, no matter how much I turned the oxygen up.
"Sorry, love, we were just having a bit of a chat. Let's head in, shall we?" I opened the door and off they went to the back of the store, where the girls' dresses were. Mrs. Hudson laughed and said, "My, those girls never stop do they!" I took Mrs. Hudson by the arm and led her into the shop, "No Mrs. H, they love living life too much for that." She patted my arm and leaned her head into my shoulder as we continued on into the shop, following the shouts and giggles of the little girls we all loved so much.
"Good morning, lovebug," I said, trying to give her a small smile.
The festive mood was shattered by an ear-piercing shriek and a cry of "Daddy, Papa!" from the front yard. Sherlock and I immediately jumped up and ran out the front door, everyone else following close behind. The bikes were tipped over in the yard. River was kneeling next to Indigo, who was sitting on the snow-covered ground, red spread all around her. I thought her ribbon had come undone and sat next to her, until I realized it was blood.
"Yeah! Indie, what do you think, is that what you want for breakfast?" River said, spinning around to face her sister.
"River will be home shortly, shall I take Indigo upstairs, John?" Sherlock finally spoke.
She wrapped her arms around my waist when she reached me. I picked her up and swung her onto my hip, brushing her flyaway hair out of her eyes.
Just in case.
"John, I'm…"
"Go after them Sherlock! You already have your coat on!"
"River, sweetheart, I need to talk to you, come here, love. Come sit with Papa." I said, pulling myself up.
Where are you, Sherlock?
She waved to Sherlock and Indie, shouting goodbyes and get better soons at them, before taking my hand and pulling me towards the door.
"Well I suppose that's our cue, love," I said, kissing the top of his head and rolling to the side of the bed.
"Baby shoes?" Sherlock whispered to himself, his face visibly paling.
"John, Sherlock, call me immediately if you need anything."
"I love you, you crazy, wonderful man."
River began to cry again, "I'm sorry, Daddy!"
She laughed and jumped out of Sherlock's lap, running over to John and taking the bear from him, hugging it against her chest.
And then he was twenty years younger, watching his two little girls run around the room in tutus and sparkling dresses, the sunshine bright on the yellow walls.
She continued on, listing all of the people she loved and her various wishes for them, she wished for Greg to take a vacation once in a while (he always says he should go on vacation, especially after dealing with Sherlock on a particularly difficult case), for Molly to finally get the little bulldog puppy she's always wanted, and for Mrs. Hudson to get her own housekeeper.
We were having two little girls.
"What are you doing with my laptop?" I said, marching over to him to snatch it away, "you have your own you know."
"Her fingers had that brown paint you put on the kitchen table when Daddy made a bunch of holes in it!" River said from Sherlock's lap, hands on her hips and quite proud of herself.
"I promise, Sunshine."
Lestrade had come by to return Sherlock's scarf he had forgotten in his haste to leave Scotland Yard when he heard the ear-piercing screams coming from 221B. He raced to the flat, running into the bedroom when he realized where the screams were coming from.
"Well, I want to be a doctor for puppies, and maybe cats if they like me." Indie chimed in.
"I'm taking some home for Daddy, fish and chips are his favorite," she said with a grin.
I let myself go then, a thin shoulder my only support, a motherly voice and hand on my back keeping me in this reality I no longer wanted to face.
"I got an A on my science test! Daddy, can we check on our worms tonight?" She said, turning her head to where Sherlock sat.
"Yes, Papa! You can be the princess!" River called back.
Did she get out of school early? Did I forget to pick her up? Did someone take her?
The years flew by, a toddling little girl soon standing in place of that newborn baby. She had inherited her mother's raven curls and high cheekbones. She had her father's nose and slim build. Her eyes, however, were a different matter entirely.
"Papa, you'll make me all better before I have to go to heaven, won't you?"
"Alright, Daddies, we're going to be looking to see what gender these little ones are, are you ready?"
"Sometimes…sometimes, these things just happen, love. No one did anything wrong, it's not anyone's fault. It just happened." I said, my voice faltering.
"Well, are you coming? Don't just sit there with your mouth gaping like you've seen a ghost, John," Sherlock finally said, his mouth quirked into a smile.
"Thank you, Molly, I do hope he knows what's happening though, I have a feeling 'surprise birthday party' didn't make it into the mind palace files." I laughed. She laughed and nodded her head.
He laid next to his daughter, the red light from the baby monitor shining from the bedside table. Her wispy blonde curls were beginning to dry and fanned out across the pillow. Sherlock kissed her forehead and pulled her onto his chest to sleep.
She opened the large, heavy black door as quietly as she could, her small arms trembling from the weight. The butterfly flew out, but hovered at the bottom of the steps, seemingly waiting for her new friend.
"And thus Sherlock, the snail is being returned to the ocean, where it belongs."
"Oh! Papa, Daddy, I have something for you. I saw it and just had to grab it for you both." River said.
He released my hand and placed his head in his hands. His back began to quake.
"River Grace, how lovely to see you, did you and your sister get the dolls I sent from Russia?" He said, patting her on the head.
As if on cue, Sherlock waddled back into the room and the girls roared with laughter. Sherlock continued to dramatically waddle around the kitchen, opening and closing each of the cabinets. His act made the girls laugh even harder and they fell to the floor and began to roll around.
I looked at him, my husband, my partner, my friend, and saw the strange mixture of pain and happiness, of loss and hope that he had in his eyes.
River looked up from Sherlock's shoulder and nodded her head morosely, swiping her sleeve across her dripping nose and dropping her head back down.
I braced myself for whatever ridiculous object was about to come through the doors.
He stood for a few more moments, looking at all of us.
River arrived home from school with Greg and Molly around 4 o'clock that afternoon, Mycroft arriving soon after. Mrs. Hudson had made us a roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and green beans for dinner. We sat around Indie, who had woken up feeling a tiny bit better, for dinner. She sat up in bed and took a bite of the mashed potatoes I fed her before pushing the plate away with a tired look on her face.
He looked bloody awful.
I woke up leaning forward with my head on a pillow on Indie's bed, her hand still clasped in mine. I straightened up, cracking my neck and back along the way. A blanket that had been draped over me fell to the floor.
"Coming, Indie!" Molly said, giving me another quick hug before heading over to the girls.
"But, I'm not real, Daddy" she said, the ground beginning to tremble, "you have to go home."
So much more was said silently; fatigue, bruising at a light bump. She was getting a little worse, a little bit sicker.
I felt tears forming in my eyes as I watched the man I loved fall completely apart in my arms, his heart wrenching cries echoing throughout the room.
"It’s probably better this way... Do they really need you, James? After all, they’ve been doing fine without you for four years."
"Where is he? Where is Lestrade ?!" he asked, shouting at Anderson who seemed as lost as himself. "Where is he ?"
"Here, it’s about two hundred. The damage is less than in MI5 or Piccadilly, but we have more deaths than in MI5. St Barth’s is permanently blocked." said Greg. "We have no record, no way to trace the people who did this action so far. "
Mycroft watched them walk away.
"Don’t care, I don’t trust them." added Eggsy before getting up from Harry’s knees. "We'll see how the arrival of their agent will happen, but .. "
"It’s good to see you here, Mr. Holmes."
"It’s Latin," Eve replied. All turned to her as if she had done something stupid.
Eurus was not wrong. Mycroft was obviously concerned about everything that was going on in London right now, he didn’t really have a choice but he was calmer than anyone else in this room. He was just worried about it.
John and Sherlock were already a few meters away when a last sound was heard, the two looked at each other before turning back to the place from which the sound came. John opened his eyes and looked at Sherlock, who, the second he crossed his eyes, began to run. John followed him and the two stopped where they came from, Scotland Yard had been the victim of the last explosion.
But that’s not the point.
"What’s going on?" he asked the small group.
It was an extremely hard blow to swallow. The number of dead and wounded had been shared by a Prime Minister under pressure in the press and knowing that the operation had caused 409 deaths and about 520 wounded, 170 of which between life and death had only made things worse and the collective frenzy. For Mycroft Holmes, it was a picture of a situation he was increasingly unaware of. Even though, as Sherlock liked to say; he is the British government. He was so busy that he hired another assistant. Plus, he had another problem to deal with, his siblings.
The detective got up and looked at the terrorist one last time before heading towards the exit of the room.
At last she arrived at the station where everyone started to get off in an instant, she looked after her child and rushed like all the other passengers. She left the subway station and looked at her watch. It was 10:28 am, she looked at her daughter and smiled, they would have to hurry and cross the square if they wanted to get to the pediatrician in time.
"Quite sore, I'm afraid, darling. John, can you come in here?"
"Oh good, John, can you hold this? I need to stain these livers before the chemical wears off."
They said, almost simultaneously, "We wanted to make you and Daddy breakfast, just like Aunt Molly was going to do for her Daddy!" I smiled at both of our princesses and looked at the tray they were proudly presenting to me.
Lestrade whipped around and nearly collapsed with relief at the sight of the little girl running towards him.
Thankfully for Michael, John and Mrs. Hudson came teetering into the room just at that moment.
"I should have known, this is my career, solving puzzles, and I couldn't solve the one that mattered the most in this world," he moaned.
But, I was growing more and more angry with him. I couldn't go to him with our shared grief, we couldn't lean on each other for support. He had left me stranded in this cold, dark sea, struggling against the current. His state broke my heart, but I hated how selfish he was being.
"I have no doubt in my mind, John," he said, his thin fingers brushing gently across John's, "do you think that's why I am the way I am? Monsters beget monsters after all."
He threw himself onto me, thin fingers wrapping my shirt around them. Guilt and grief overcame me and I grasped at him just as tightly and we cried into each other's arms.
"Daddy's alright, he's just in the other room, River, shh, he's here, he's here," I said, trying to calm her down.
And that is how we found ourselves here, at a 20 week scan for our twins.
"Indie, what happened to your leg?" I asked.
"Ah yes, water is quite dull, Sunshine. How about we get you a popsicle from the freezer, would you like that, darling?"
She kept screaming, struggling against my arms, hitting at me with small fists. But I couldn't let her go and dash into the mess Sherlock was in, letting her see him in that state. I took out my phone and texted Mycroft telling him to get Sherlock out here, to drag him out if he had to.
After Mrs. Hudson went back downstairs, I switched the telly onto one of the morning cartoons the girls inexplicably enjoyed. Indigo snuggled herself into my chest, her eyes drooping.
"I promise!" She shouted, tucking the bear inside of her denim jacket.
River sat and told her about the children in the ward, those who were recovering and those who were not.
John held Indie close to him, bursting into tears with relief at having his little girl again, but in sadness as he realized what all of this meant.
Sherlock and I sat in front of the fire after she had gone to sleep and flipped through the photo albums I had made, smiling at the picture of the girls with cake and icing slathered in their hair at their first birthday, laughing at the picture of Indie dressed in Mrs. Hudson's old dress with her high heels on and strings of pearls hanging from her neck, and weeping at the last picture we took with her, her pale face and sunken eyes nearly hidden by the beaming smile she held onto until the day she died.
River, meanwhile, had gone over to Indie and shook her awake, whispering to her about the party and about all the fun they were going to have with their friends. She sat up groggily, but became more awake as River talked and talked about the party they were about to walk into. I picked Indie up and kissed her on her forehead, checking for a fever. Satisfied that she didn't have one, I spun her around and set her down, picking River up in the same motion and kissed her forehead too.
"No, let's start now, Papa! I already have one to write about," she said, the pencil beginning to mark the paper.
"And then the dragon…Papa! Here's your card!" River stood up on the couch waving the card in her hand, practically bouncing off the brown leather. I could see Sherlock holding his in his left hand, dutifully drinking from the pink sippy cup in his other.
"Good thing there's two of us, eh, Sherlock, one for each of them?" I said one morning as I fed River, delirious from the lack of sleep the night before.
Indigo was feeling much better by evening. She had decided to wear a tutu over her Elsa and Anna nightgown. Mrs. Hudson brought River to spend the night with us. She was an absolute mess being away from us and with what we knew, we didn't want them to spend another day apart.
"Coffin, Indigo, flowers, dead…" A trail of nonsense streamed out of my mouth, interjected with hiccupping sobs.
"That's alright, love, I'll wrap it up for later," I told her, rubbing the back of my hand across her cheek.
I couldn't keep tears from springing up in my eyes as I turned to Sherlock. He sat, mouth agape, staring at the screen.
I looked over to see Indigo sitting in John's chair, my phone held to her ear.
"Oh, I'm sorry, love," he sighed, "I was just thinking about your sister. What color do you think she would have made her pumpkin?"
He gave me the tiniest of nods before placing his lips on my forehead and murmuring, "I promise, John."
"I'll get sunflowers on my way home from Scotland Yard," He said, his eyes still distant.
"John, why does she have a fever?" He said, panic on his face.
The girls laid on the soft grass, naming what they saw in the clouds.
Greg had also come by after work and brought the largest teddy bear in all of London, possibly the universe, and a giant cluster of pink balloons for his "Little Miss Sunshine." (His nickname for River was "Squirrel").
"Am I very sick, Papa?"
"I not only see things, but observe things, John, I can tell you a stranger's wife is cheating on him, or that a boy is struggling to ask a girl named Kayley to a dance. I can tell you anything about anyone. How couldn't I see that Indigo was so ill, John? I should have seen something, I thought something was wrong when she injured her ankle, but I knew it was most likely just a sprain like you said, John, little girls get sprains and "ouchies" and "booboos." Little girls don't have cancer! Our little girl wouldn't have cancer! I missed the most important observation in the universe…and…I…I killed her, John, this is my fault, I should have seen something and we could have taken her to the doctor and made her all better and I…I"
"I love you, Nana Hudson."
"Papa…"
A rope swing with a wooden seat hung on one of the trees in the field and he had taken pictures of the girls in it. There was one of River, grinning mischievously at the camera, her blue eyes as deep as oceans, and her hands gripped the ropes like she was about to take off. Indie sat on the swing with her feet crossed, her head leaning against the farthest rope, and a small closed-lipped smile on her face. The sun reflected off her eyes, making them look almost green.
"I need help, Sherlock. We need help. We just need to be her parents now; she just needs us to be her Papa and her Daddy."
"Mrs. Jones wants us to write about our favorite part of the summer, but I can't pick just one, Papa."
We had the girls in matching dresses, as we usually did on Christmas. They were white satin with a silver embroidery and a red ribbon tied 'round the middle with a big bow in the back. A red bow sat on the left side of the girls' hair. They also had insisted that Jack have an outfit for Christmas, so I found a collar with a red bow tie on the front. The girls loved it, even Sherlock gave his half smile that I loved so much after he saw our little pug.
"Give me the thermometer, please, she feels much warmer than that."
"Goodnight, dears," she said, taking them both into her arms.
"Brilliant, as always, Sherlock," I said, kissing him on the cheek, "and yes to the shops. River and I'll be going to find you something for your birthday. I've already asked Mrs. Hudson to watch Indie for the afternoon since I know you were planning on going down to the Yard for a few hours."
But we had no reason for why her sister was dying. It was a cruel hand of fate, dealt at random to our beautiful little girl. There was no logic, there was no understanding. It just was.
"May we be excused, Papa?" River asked, her body already halfway out of the chair. "Of course, darling. You both did very well eating lunch today." I said. They smiled at me, put their dishes in the sink, and ran into the front room, chattering away. I began to tidy up when I heard Sherlock step into the kitchen.
"Sherlock, please come back to me. We can talk about whatever these are, I can help you."
"I am perfectly capable of being alone for a few hours, John." He said, setting Indie down after she had given him a goodbye kiss.
"This is ridiculous, John, I am perfectly healthy," Sherlock muttered as they waited for the doctor.
She nodded and I went back into the kitchen, adding the plate to the stack of plates in the fridge from last night's dinner and lunch today.
"We put it away for now, love," he said, a forced smile on his face.
Indigo, on the other hand, had sandy blonde hair like mine used to be that also fell in ringlets, just a little longer than River's, with bright hazel eyes from her mother (our surrogate, we can never repay that lovely, wonderful woman for what she gave to us.). Indie, as she's known, was wearing a light blue version of the nightgown her sister was wearing. Smudges of what appeared to be maple syrup were present on her sides, as though she had wiped her syrupy hands on her nightgown. Indie had chosen a bright orange polish for her fingers and toes during our makeovers last evening. She was our quiet thinker, with a heart of gold, always smiling, and never cross.
I took the paper from her and studied the brown and black blob she had created. Her blue eyes were large, expectantly waiting for me to critique her work.
"My sweet girl, how are you, how are those precious babies you're seeing?"
Sherlock studied him for a moment, his eyes locked onto John's. His breathing was growing rapid, more shallow. The panic in Sherlock was rising, he hadn't told anyone his secret for nearly 25 years. Now he was about to tell everything, to the soldier that would keep him out of harm's way. He licked his lips, his mouth had become exceedingly dry.
He laughed and picked her up, letting her chat happily to him as he bounced back with her into the kitchen to show her the most recent (kid-friendly) experiment he was working on.
"Papa, I want to become a chef when I grow up," River said as I flipped the first sandwich over.
The timer on the oven buzzed from the kitchen, its loud incessant tone piercing the air.
Her bright blue eyes peeped at me and a sleepy smile crossed her face.
They told him to look through the telescope and directed him where to look for the constellations I had pointed out.
"And you're my silly Sunshine."
Suddenly I felt a chill and shuddered, something felt wrong, I hadn't felt this much dread since right before, well, Sherlock's fall. I glanced at the quote again and shook off the feeling, silly getting so upset over a quote from a calendar. Sitting at my desk at the clinic, I straightened the picture of my little family and smiled. I remember that day like it was yesterday…
"Sweetheart, last night," my voice cracked, "last night, Indie got very sick." I watched her cheerful face fall and I swallowed back bile as I continued, "She fought terribly hard, but this morning, lovebug…this morning Indie went to heaven, I'm so sorry, love," I said, each word tearing at my heart.
I forced a small smile onto my face, "Oh, I'm alright, as long as I keep busy, I'm alright."
Once the food was gone, Sherlock stood up and carefully picked Indigo out of the highchair.
"Are you my happy little girl? My most beautiful Indigo Rose," Sherlock said.
"Sherlock? Get dressed please, River and Michael will be over soon," John said tiredly as he came into the room.
"I love you too, Sherlock. Goodnight."
"There you are, darling, your favorites."
Gunshots and screams echoed around me…the sand was hot beneath my bare feet…not again…not again.
"I know, why don't we play a bit of charades! River, come here with me and I'll tell you what we're going to act out." Mrs. Hudson said with a clap of her hands.
"What are you doing, Sherlock?" I asked.
John chuckled and got up from the sofa, grabbing the pile of lavender colored blankets and following her with a limp.
"Of course, love."
Happy 27th birthday, my darling Sunshine.
"What time is it, John, it gets earlier and earlier every year."
"Thank you, sweetheart, that will be a most welcome snack for later." Sherlock replied, a bit more awake this time.
He stood in the doorway, impeccably dressed as always in a gray and blue suit, silver watch chain disappearing into his pocket.
She raised her other hand into the air, beckoning to him.
River sat in Mrs. Keaton's lap, still screaming, my ears had begun to ring from all of the noise in the little car. My arms ached from holding Indie on my lap and trying to keep her from flopping onto the floor.
Seconds became minutes and soon it was quarter to four.
A fond smile crossed his face as he nodded. I pulled a chair up for him before I headed upstairs to put Indie to bed.
John frowned as he crouched down to help Sherlock, "It's alright, love, no harm done. I have plenty of mugs." He was horrified to find he was using the same tone he used with victims of abuse or other terrible crimes.
"Papa, Indie won't come back to visit, will she? Lily told me that angels have to stay in heaven and that even if she visited we couldn't see her."
Her scream snapped him into action. He ran to us like lightning, pulling us both to the floor, all of us crying. Sherlock's bandaged hands grasped the back of my jumper and River held onto him with a vice-like grip. I wrapped my arms around the both of them, the empty space where Indie would've sat like a gaping wound.
"A marvelous day, John."
"Sir, what I'm saying is that putting your little girl through chemotherapy and radiation would prolong her life by maybe a few months, but would severely reduce the quality of her life in the months you have left with her. It is yours and your husband's decision ultimately, but it is my duty to you and Indigo to tell you the facts." She gently replied.
"Yes, Papa!"
"Well how about I make you your favorite macaroni and cheese for lunch today, dear?"
"You are welcome anytime, my little scientist." Sherlock said warmly, a soft smile crossing his face.
When the evening was finished, we asked the director to take a photo of us in front of the massive telescope.
He glanced over at the picture that sat in the middle of the mantle, a radiant River standing at the altar in a white, sparkling ballgown, her raven hair pulled up into an elegant bun, a white, jeweled veil draping behind her.
He rolled his eyes and continued his pout for the rest of the walk and into the school.
"There's nothing to worry about," he said, and with that he was gone, his brisk footsteps echoing up the stairs. John sighed and grabbed his jacket, following Sherlock.
She grabbed onto his hand and pulled him back into the park.
Sherlock's voice continued through the story, as deep and as strong as ever. But if you looked, very closely, you'd see the drying trail of water down the right side of his face, from the only tear he had and would ever allow in front of his daughters.
Among the officers who seemed to want to recover from the blast, others were trying to root out the wounded. John had begun to examine and heal and protect those they saw in his path. Sherlock watched him go off while trying to find a familiar face, he fell well one of them but surely not the one he was hoping for.
Sherlock sighed, it was hard to know what Eurus really thought because of the cold tone of her voice, but most of the time even though she was meticulously controlling her facial expressions, she was happy.
