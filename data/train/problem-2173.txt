"Right. And how do
John nodded. The cabbie opened the door and stood aside to let them enter. “It’ll be nice to get away from that madman for a while.”
Plenty of Mike's company were already plastered, and if he had had a chandelier, Sherlock found it difficult to doubt whether someone would have been swinging from it. He took the drink John handed him as a girl Sherlock recognized from class stumbled through and latched onto someone dressed as a matador.
Wilson looked at him, puzzled. “What?”
“Sherlock, please. I’ve taken all I can handle. Can’t we just call it a night?”
John was terrified despite himself. He’d been in sticky situations before. Hell, even if he hadn’t been shot in Afghanistan, Sherlock had taken him on plenty of ridiculously risky and potentially fatal adventures since his return. But there was something on the horizon here. Sherlock was on his way inside, not knowing what he was walking into, not knowing that John was here for nothing more than to be used by Moriarty.
Also,
Which was how he heard someone crying as he passed a deserted side-road.
"Sherlock, you've always liked John."
"Do I? You know, I was worried about the faux leather..."
(See the end of the chapter for
John’s smile dissolved the suspicious, confused look on his face in an instant. “That’s a great idea, Sherlock. But I wouldn’t want to go unless you and Molly came, too.”
“No it’s not.”
“I’d say so, yeah. What about you?”
“Yeah, probably. Why did that happen, though? Why did I catch fire on the bloody Quidditch pitch?”
He trailed off when he spotted the picnic. "Oh. Sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you on your date."
Sherlock looked as though he wanted to say something else. His mouth opened and closed three times before finally, he said, “Do you want to work on Potions tonight?”
“You’ve have to figure that out on your own,” was the only reply he got before his parents walked away, leaving him glaring after them.
"...do take you, William Sherlock Scott Holmes, to be mine."
“What, I can’t do something nice?”
“But if you’re sitting around with me while I’m eating, then…couldn’t you use that time to eat something yourself?”
“Sherlock,” John huffed, checking his watch once again. “You can’t do this.”
“You’re wearing that?”
The look of terror on John’s face as she said it told him all he needed to know about John’s preparedness. He turned to Sherlock and whispered, “Thursday?”
“Jesus. Come on.” John grabbed Sherlock’s hand and ran, for once leading the way.
“My what?”
“Do most people have a favorite poison?”
John jumped awake. "What, what's wrong?" he grunted.
As the pageboy--John's young cousin--came forward with the rings, Sherlock risked a glance at his parents and saw, of all things, his mother passing a handkerchief to Mrs. Hudson. John's mother sat proudly beside them, her tears close to falling, but still sparkling in her eyes.
“Please, it would’ve been worth it if we
"Mycroft
No sooner had John accepted that Moriarty was not going to back down, and that Sherlock was going to be forced to either do so himself or kill them all, than a tinny ringtone echoed from the tiles and the water. He furrowed his brow in confusion as Sherlock glanced around. Moriarty closed his eyes in frustration, much like a manager after receiving news that one of his employees has screwed up. He pulled a mobile phone from his pocket.
Their mother swept into the room. "Come now, boys, you'll be late to school," she said, handing them their book bags.
On the walk from Gryffindor Tower to the Great Hall, they ran into Molly, whose dress robes were quite different from her typical casual attire of high-buttoned blouses and homely cardigans. In fact, if John hadn't had Sherlock, he might have given her a second look, but as always, he had eyes only for the ridiculous boy over whose arm he'd draped his own. He still said, "You look brilliant, Molly," and just barely refrained from commenting on the way Lestrade had stopped dead as he'd turned the corner and seen her.
“John, I—”
"Of course he would, he's David Bowie." Sherlock fiddled with his wig. "You should've been a goblin."
McGonagall stared at him for a long while. He stared back at her with something in his eyes that John had never seen before. It was almost a plea, but Sherlock Holmes didn’t truly plead. Finally, her head tilted back and she glanced at John before replying. "Alright. But be careful. If anything like this happens again, the matter—this 'case'—is out of your hands, Mr. Holmes, and into mine." She turned back to the door and was halfway out of the room when she added, "And don’t do anything that might get you another detention tonight, gentlemen. Good night."
"What now?" Sherlock said.
“What would you say to a tutor?”
“Who’s first?” Sherlock’s father asked from his plush armchair as John took a seat next to Sherlock.
“No, I
“Sherlock,” John whispered, and it was a much more gentle sound than he would have thought possible, with the pleasure unfurling intensely throughout his entire body. “God, Sherlock,” he murmured again as he came, a little more hoarsely as his voice cracked. Sherlock tensed above him and cried out, his own orgasm drawn from him at the sound.
Greg was the only one left standing. "Okay, rules: you have to kiss whoever it lands on. No exceptions. Also, nothing dirty. There are children present," he joked, glancing at Sherlock and Molly. Sherlock scowled. Greg walked over to the portable record player in the corner and put on a Tears for Fears album.
Sherlock didn’t break eye contact, but he didn’t say anything either.
"Later, boys," Victor hollered after them.
“Not a good one, or it would be more secure. Besides, if we get caught it’ll be worth the detention.”
"Mhmm," Sherlock hummed, shrugging himself closer to John and closing his eyes.
“Mason didn’t really seem to mean it ‘all in good fun.’ Not for Sherlock, anyway. In fact, Sherlock gets enough of that at Hogwarts. He doesn’t need it from his family.”
"Veterinary doctor?"
“Er…Sherlock…” John couldn’t look at him. “Er, thanks.”
“Yeah. And I’ve learned to expect at least four from every date.”
“John,” he heard shortly after he arrived. Sherlock was crouched in a nearby corner. His whisper startled John.
“Could you shut up now?”
"No."
"But no photographs!" Sherlock barked, snatching the outfit away from his mother and pointing a threatening finger at John as he went upstairs.
you do it?"
“No, I meant
"Or make you worse." John chuckled. "You know, I don't know that either of us really has any say in it. It's in your DNA."
"Seriously? Of all that, t
"Shall we?" John asked, holding out his arm--the one without the wooden shield attached to it--in Sherlock's direction.
“Well, perhaps it wasn’t
He appeared from the pantry, primly closing it behind him. “Yes, brother dear?”
As Sherlock was too young to cause much trouble late at night, he and John drifted off rather quickly, feeling the toll of the busy day they'd had, out and about in the city. Sherlock's nightlight eased the anxiety of his open closet door, and made it easy for the both of them to slip into drowsiness, then sleep.
"And who else should you kiss? Not a little girl in your own year, that's too
"Sh-sherlock, get away from the door. Get back under the blanket."
John took the knife and directed him to the pot, where the pasta bubbled away inside. "Stir that a moment, would you?"
The two of them were quiet for a full minute.
He hadn’t caught a single glimpse of Moriarty since that night, and whenever he spoke of him to Sherlock, the boy clammed up and told him to drop the subject. He wished Sherlock would talk to him about the case—he hated being in the dark almost as much as Sherlock did, although Sherlock would have scoffed at the thought. Still, he limited his mentions of Moriarty to once every few days, because even though it was alright when it was unintentional, he couldn’t stand Sherlock
"I was--I was just--"
In all honesty, John had been dozing off. He jerked himself awake. “Yeah. Yeah, sure.” Sherlock helped him to his feet.
“Oh, come on, Sherlock!”
had been.
There was a startled gasp from somewhere to his right, and in a flash Wilkes had disappeared. In his place, on the floor, there lay a single red brick.
When he stepped off the train, John instantly climbed into the nearest carriage, joining a tall, dark-haired boy he recognized as the Ravenclaw Seeker and a fellow fifth year, Sherlock Holmes,as well as a severe-looking teen with a Head Boy badge and vaguely similar features.
It was as he passed a bench that he vaguely registered as occupied that he heard a voice shout his name in surprise. Surely it couldn't be meant for him, so he kept walking, until the voice said, loudly and clearly, "John Watson!"
“Why would that idea even appeal to me?” He made a face, imagining all of those girls with their muddy kits and long hair and soft chests.
Because if John was afraid, then at least he wasn't alone.
Mycroft nodded and led him into the sitting room. “What finally convinced you?”
31 Dec--Chapter 22
“What do you think I’m trying to do?” John shot back.
Everyone filed from the room rather more quickly and silently than usual, except for Mike, John, and Sherlock, whose weight John still supported against him.
in the
You're fondling each other in the presence of a
Mycroft was beginning to look uncomfortable under the scrutiny of his aunt. It was rather bizarre, seeing Mycroft look that sheepish, even if it was simply a shadow lingering behind his eyes. John was overcome with the urge to help him, but was completely unsure of what to say. Meanwhile, drunk Uncle Andrew was still occupying all of Sherlock’s amused attention, Mr. Holmes was conversing animatedly with Molly’s father, and Mrs. Holmes glared down the table at her sister.
"We've only just arrived."
“SHUT UP!” he roared, and everyone was silent. “Can we all just shut up and listen to Greg, please? Sally, you’re being sloppy. Harry, you’re goofing off. Don’t you try to deny it, I saw you over by the Hufflepuffs!”
“Oh, this is…say, how old were you there, Sherlock?”
The boy, who Sherlock realized was older than him--he really should think him a man, but one of the things he'd noticed was the difficulty of calling other students 'adults'--looked sleepily down at his half-naked form and shrugged. "S'pose not," he muttered, then grinned at Sherlock. "But at least it's easier for me to keep my bits covered."
John soon found that this particular exchange was full of gag gifts more than anything. By its end, Sherlock was surrounded by about fifty toy cauldrons that he would surely melt if he were to actually use them. John and Wilson had spent most of the previous half-hour laughing more and more heartily at the expression on Sherlock’s face as he’d pulled cauldron after cauldron from three different bags.
There was a small stone next to the curb. He told himself it wasn’t a good idea, but the alcohol convinced him otherwise. He picked it up and threw it.
There wasn’t a response until hours later.
The others in the carriage stared at him, the Head Boy with pure mistrust, Sherlock with heavily masked curiosity. “Mind if I ride up with you?” John asked them, wondering at once whether he even wanted to. Head Boy nodded coldly but casually, as though he were used to being in charge. The other scoffed and turned away to watch the invisible thing that pulled the stagecoach.
"Everyone loves you. You could have anyone in the whole school, boy or girl. Why did you pick me?"
Sherlock didn't understand why John wanted
It was becoming increasingly difficult for John not to raise his voice. "Why are you doing this, Sherlock?"
Being much more experienced in the art of getting by his elders than the twelve-year-old he’d stopped, the two were able to get to the Restricted Section of the library without raising suspicion or being told off.
I have returned. More in the end note.
They found Sherlock's mother just where they'd left her, listening to a violin concerto in the parking lot. When she spotted them walking towards the car, she reached around to unlock the back door. "No luck?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“No.”
“Ah, that’s what you think, Morstan. Watson’s plenty good at bullshit. Remember that excuse he gave McGonagall for hitting Wilkes with the club in the Ravenclaw match last year?”
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine.” Sherlock was pulling the bomb away from him now, more panicked than John had ever seen him. “I’m fine,” he tried to reassure him, no matter how untrue it was. “Sherlock.”
"You saw the pool! It's indoors. Heated with an enchantment of my mother's invention."
"What, 'no more rendezvous in coat closets'?"
"Is that so?"
John rolled his eyes, but smiled. "Seriously, Sherlock, we’ve already got one detention," he protested weakly.
"Hmm," John agreed.
“I’ll never understand why McGonagall made him a Prefect.”
John was halfway through his steak-and-kidney pie when he heard Harry’s voice. “What’s up, little brother?” she said, clapping him on the shoulder and helping herself to some chips.
“Why on earth would you want to start up the Dueling Club?” Harry asked him that night when he’d mentioned it in front of the common room fire.
"I could get them from a classmate, Sherlock."
"I have to find something nice for Sarah."
Sherlock was walking out of class when his phone began to vibrate. He stopped when he saw an unfamiliar number and stared at it for a few seconds before answering.
“For a wedding? A tuxedo is the wrong armour for a wedding?” John said incredulously.
," Lestrade would say incredulously.
“You don’t eat much, do you?”
John was about to ask how Sherlock had determined that last bit when he noticed a young man approaching them.
, but that's hardly everything."
He was cut off by a scream as Sherlock's elbow bumped the pot, sending boiling water to the floor. John knew he was too late when Sherlock began hopping from foot to foot, whimpering.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Why do you encourage them?" Mycroft muttered.
John studied the knife. He found that it had not gone very far into the flesh of his leg, but knew better than to remove it.
When the album’s supply of stories was exhausted and Mrs. Holmes rose to retrieve another, John used the chance to say, “You’re trying to distract me.”
As soon as he'd said it, there was a hum of dying electronics throughout the two rooms that made up the cabin. John gave him a look.
“No, it’s fine,” John said, returning his attention to his Charms essay.
“You’re kidding.”
“Yes, John?”
The thought of Sherlock with children made John grin. Maybe Sherlock was so great with them because he acted so immature himself, sometimes. John thought it was something else. Whenever he observed Sherlock with a child, it was more the way he treated them that earned him a gap-toothed smile; he didn't condescend to them any more than he would a typical adult, and when they did something wrong, he told them why it was harmful instead of simply scolding them. He treated them like little grown-ups, John realized, as he watched Sherlock ranting about the broken wheel of one of the trucks and saw Lucy and Amelia nodding sympathetically.
"Chocolate Frogs are surprisingly innovative, for a sweet," Sherlock muttered.
"Might as well be."
“MYCROFT!” Sherlock roared as he entered the house. “GET DOWN HERE.”
John found himself reaching down to tug Sherlock’s shirt out of his trousers and let his thumbs rest against the bare skin beneath it as he laid his hands on Sherlock’s hips and continued to work his lips against Sherlock’s in earnest. Sherlock finally did the same, though he didn’t stop with hands on hips. Instead, he began to loosen John’s tie and unbutton his shirt. The layers of the top half of John’s school uniform were soon discarded to a pile a few feet away. John made sure Sherlock’s were quick to join them.
“What? Why do you care if I can produce a Patronus or not?”
"Are we--?"
“I was—flirting.”
of your dressing gown.” John closed his eyes and sighed. “Fine. I’ll get them, then.” He snatched up his own from the hook on the door and tugged it around him without a backward glance.
"You could've said something, git," John laughed.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock replied, shaking his head with the same sarcastically casual air, never lowering the gun.
“Well, yeah. Couldn’t have blood on your team’s hands, could you?”
Before he knew it, Sherlock was covered, practically from head to toe, in the apple juice that had inexplicably fallen from Wilkes’s tray.
“No. We found out the hard way last year that, as it turns out, the driver of the Knight Bus does not know where a Muggle park might be located.”
eat a big lunch. Besides, Mike says he saw you. You had a few chips and then left to work on this bloody thing.” He gestured toward the orange mess the explosion had made of the cauldron.
Just a couple things.
that?"
By three that day, they were stepping out into sunlight. When Mycroft saw them hand in hand, he put his fingers to his temple and groaned, because although he'd seen it coming, and he was glad Sherlock found someone who kept him at least partially tamed, he knew that the two of them together meant trouble that even he would have problems containing.
“Oi!”
"Go away, Mycroft."
“I like this jumper!”
"At least you can dress yourself just as well." Sherlock nearly clapped his hand over his mouth as soon as he'd said it, but maintained the clever air he'd just regained.
"Then it's a good thing I accepted his invitation to your party."
Sherlock muttered angrily, but did as he was told. John was just packing up their sandwiches when Sherlock came around the corner into the kitchen. John stopped dead and had to stifle a laugh.
It had been ages since Harry had come round, and although John couldn't say he was looking forward to it, he was certainly not going to let that stop him from enjoying time in the kitchen with Sherlock.
"Poor Bill."
"Sherlock kissed me. And I shouted at him."
He wished he could look away.
“Actually, he’s already told me that one,” John said defensively.
"I know I'm being dramatic. Leave me to it, you prat."
"Then what am I?"
getting into, I suppose."
“Dinner?” John begged.
"Forget what Dad says. Dad's an idiot."
He looked at Molly and shrugged again. “I’ve got nothing on. I suppose we could stop by,” Molly answered.
Sherlock opened and inspected the crystal vials Mycroft had given him before Mycroft unwrapped a black umbrella and a rather large box of Cauldron Cakes which, although the gift wrapping had been anonymous and out-of-place, even John could deduce were Sherlock’s idea of a fun gift for his brother. His suspicions were confirmed when Sherlock’s attempts to hide a snicker fooled no one and his mother shot him a dangerous look.
John yawned. "I wonder when Mycroft will be by to pick us up."
“Sherlock!”
“There’s nothing you can do to ‘fix’ me,” Sherlock spat.
Sherlock laid his head on John’s shoulder. “Doesn’t count.”
was the idiot. Not you."
“Don’t you dare go pinning this on Greg. Moran just got a little out of his head.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "And how d'you propose we do that?"
"Shut up, Honeybee," John hissed.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sherlock, just put on your pants."
Sherlock wasn’t used to feeling much of anything but disdain. So, naturally, he couldn’t bring himself to reciprocate John’s obvious feelings toward him.
He shook his head.
"Is there something you aren't telling me?"
"Pyjamas are laid out. Amelia has to have her giraffe to sleep. You've got my number."
“But John…do you really want to spend the night in the same room with a boy who was almost an accessory to your murder?”
"We don't know what happened, no one saw. Greg found her in the alley behind The Three Broomsticks--"
John was more frightened than ever at that prospect.
"She is," Teddy sighed, then remembered who he was speaking to and composed himself. He coughed. "But, you know. She's also, you know." He clearly didn't know what else to say. John grinned. He knew how long Teddy had carried a flame for Victoire, and it was perhaps longer than he'd even known him, them being childhood friends. "Yeah." He pulled on his cloak and coughed again.
Sherlock giggled.
Molly's brow furrowed. "Sherlock..."
Clearly this was a sore subject, because John felt he’d missed something.
“Third time’s the charm, I guess,” John murmured when he finally broke it.
“Yes. And I want you to explain it to me.”
“Paul!” Mr. Holmes said, reaching out to shake Mr. Hooper’s hand. “So glad you could make it.”
“Well, just this morning I was talking with Sherlock Holmes. Poor bloke’s bored out of his mind, and Potions is his best subject. He practically begs Gregson for a challenge every class.”
20 Dec--Chapter 16
“What?”
Sherlock scoffed. "You brought him up. It better not happen next time."
“Well, I can see it didn’t keep you from getting here on schedule,” Mrs. Holmes replied, a certain indication in her voice that she most certainly would have preferred if the weather had caused them to miss dinner entirely.
“Yeah, like you have
. And I will continue to go after him. He's interesting. I'll admit, my first attempts at investigating him were a product of my fascination with his methods and his persona. And in a way, that's still the case. But I realize as well as you the danger we're both in as long as he's at this school, you in particular. What does it tell you that despite every failure of mine to expose whatever it is that he's doing, I keep at it? What does that tell you? There is nothing I would not do to keep you safe. I'm sorry if logical reasoning is the only way I know how." Tears bit at the corners of his eyes, and through the whole of his speech there was the threat of his voice breaking, but he had at least managed not to fall into a heap at John's feet.
“Sherlock,” he heard from a few yards out. He looked down and saw a blond head peeking out of the dark water.
At this, Sherlock drew himself up to his full height. "How do you
They ordered one pepperoni and flipped the television to some science fiction film. John stretched out on the sofa. “Make yourself at home.”
Sherlock tugged at the hem of his polyester tunic, but was otherwise the embodiment of calm and collected. "Hello, John. Your costume is..." He didn't know what to say. Nice? Lovely? Well-fit?
"That doesn't actually work, John."
was something he could get behind.
, he'd had you so brainwashed that you shoved me on the playground for kissing you. Your entire life has been a messy attempt to keep your loving relationship a secret from your father. Congratulations, you've succeeded, and now you can get on with your life. So I'm sorry if I'm not too torn up about him being gone."
"John," Victor said in surprise. "What are you doing here?"
"Hm?" Shit.
want?"
He jerked away from her, jostling the injured arm and crying out.
John looked back down at Sherlock’s face, surrounded by wild, dark curls and half-covered by the bandage that was wrapped around his head. When he did, he saw Sherlock’s eyes open.
“I insist. You put the idea in my head, now it’s going to stay there until it happens.”
It was on his way to Gryffindor Tower that he spotted Sebastian Wilkes headed in the opposite direction. He rolled his eyes and avoided the older boy’s gaze, but it was a trend in John’s life that he was always noticed when he didn’t want to be.
Mycroft nodded. “John.” Again, he glanced at the towels, much more pointedly this time.
“Fine,” Sherlock huffed again, grumpily picking up his bag and clearing the cauldron with a sweep of his wand.
“Mycroft! What are you doing here?” Sherlock demanded.
“You just hit a Bludger
That night, when it finally hit John that he had almost been a murder victim, he went to the cabinet and took a long swig of vodka.
He turned stoically.
"Jacket."
Sherlock shook his head.
"But what about the others?"
“Yeah, I’d say so,” he replied.
John cocked his head as a small smile crept around the corners of his mouth. Somehow, Sherlock’s nerves were giving him more confidence. “You’re sure it’s not something else?” When he put a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, the younger boy sucked in a sharp breath through his teeth.
Moriarty answered with a sighing “What do you want?” He mouthed “
"At first, yes," Sherlock answered, leaning forward to wrap his fingers around John's tie and yank him down for a heated kiss. "But that's not all I want from you, John Watson." His voice had reached the sultry rumble that elicited something of an innate response in John.
“Well, I don’t really care what kind of impression I make on you anymore. You’re obviously not interested.”
. "Come here." He hugged John to him. Didn't kiss him, just wrapped his arms around him, clutching at his robes with sweaty fingers.
to care. You've got to be a
Suddenly, John found himself being pushed face-first against the wall. He struggled, but the arms that held him captive were strong, and he remembered with a sigh that Moran had always been able to hit a Bludger much further than he could. Sherlock made no move to help him, so he assumed that Moran had drawn his wand as well.
"Jesus, John, you couldn't find somewhere else to get off?" he muttered, but the corner of his mouth turned up in a smirk as he walked to his own bed two down and began rummaging in his trunk.
"Oh." Mike hung his head. "Sorry."
“I’m sure Dad and Mummy will open their present from you along with those from Mycroft and me. Mycroft and I will open your gifts to us, and you’ll open our gifts to you.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "And you call
John narrowed his eyes. "It better
Harry narrowed her eyes at John's tone, his badly-suppressed laughter puzzling her. "The bathroom?" Without so much as a warning, she rounded the corner and, when she spotted Sherlock perched on the edge of the tub with his feet propped under the tap, barked out a laugh.
we can take them off?"
“Sherlock, I’m warning you…”
"At least clean up your experiments. And clear it with Mrs. Hudson."
“Hmm?”
"So?"
On the ride to school, Sherlock turned to John in the backseat. "Have
Sherlock nearly pulled his arms out of their sockets trying to get off his coat and explosive vest. “Sherlock!”
Sherlock pursed his lips. "Fair point."
John stuck a toe in to check that the water wasn’t too cold. He felt his face go red as he waded in after Sherlock and looked up to see him staring. “What?”
“Well, for one, I don’t want you getting attacked by a Dementor.”
"John?" Sherlock murmured, and his eyes shot open.
It occurred to John as he entered, adjusting himself discreetly in his trousers, that this was his repayment for before. Then it occurred to him that he ought to be surprised that the thought of Sherlock in a lacy pair of knickers would turn him on like this. He glared at his boyfriend, who raised an eyebrow innocently. And he realized that anything to do with Sherlock would turn him on if he let it.
"I wanted to thank you again, Mike. I don't—"
He also would have been able to stay out of hot water.
quite extraordinary).
“Precisely.”
“Traichan Holmes. He was known to torture people beyond repair.” The level of disgust in Sherlock’s voice was something John had never heard before. “Countless people. He didn’t even torture them for information. He was the worst kind of Death Eater, one that tortured for fun.”
"It can't hurt. We'll still use your coat, don't worry."
“For God’s sake, Sherlock, we almost got blown up. You could’ve called for that.”
“You ‘fell asleep on top of the astronomy tower’ with that weirdo, huh?”
"Sherlock why'd you have to bring that up?"
He took a seat in the same spot he’d occupied the night before and sat patiently next to Sherlock until Mr. Holmes joined them, yawning and stretching as he collapsed into his armchair. “Go on, boys, take a gift,” he urged them.
By far the most confusing thing that arose from the whole school’s revelation that Sherlock and John were an item was a look he got from one of the Slytherin sixth-years. It was an appraising look, calm and calculating, with a glint of mischief near the surface. If it hadn’t been for the feeling it gave him, John might not have noticed the boy standing there at all.
"Of course I am. Although, I'd clear out before Moran gets back, if I were you. He's not too keen on John's being so close with you."
"Lost? I won't be lost."
Something else seemed to occur to Greg. “I also don’t want to know what goes on up there. At all.”
say she does, then I'm not gonna doubt it." John took the box from Sherlock's hand and headed to the checkout. Sherlock followed him, a package of John's favorite jelly babies in tow.
When he arrived, he found John sitting on the bench and laughing, holding his wrist against a bag full of ice. Sherlock glanced from John's smile to his arm and sighed with relief and exasperation.
"You're to follow me now," he said, his lip trembling.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, just gave him a dark look that held in it the threat of walking away and letting his cut get infected if John didn’t drop the subject.
to coconut?
“Okay. Sure,” John replied, startled by the abruptness of the answer. Sherlock was straightforward, but not normally so straightforward that he didn’t even glance at John disdainfully.
All Mycroft could say was that they were lucky Halloween was on a Saturday, or Sherlock never would have made it out of the house.
. I finally get to spend some time alone with you, even though it’s
Sherlock hesitated, before finally assenting. It helped that his sleeping bag and a set of pyjamas had taken up permanent residence in John's closet, so he didn't have to pack for no reason.
When they reached the flat, Sherlock finally let go of John’s hand, leaving him with a sort of relieved emptiness as he stepped out from under the coat and threw himself down into his chair.
"Right."
“His name is Moriarty. I’ll tell you more about him tomorrow. For now, you should get some rest.”
"That means nothing."
“John. What the hell…?”
Between the two of them, ‘Third Date’ had become a euphemism for sex. Which they still hadn’t had. And never would, if Sherlock didn’t take care of himself. When John pointed this out for perhaps the hundredth time, Sherlock marched past him up the stairs as though he’d been sent to his room. John took this as compliance, threw his bag over his shoulder, and followed all the way to the Great Hall.
Sherlock sighed rather dramatically. “Fine. A waltz, then. Take this foot...” Sherlock nudged it. “Go back.”
“Come, John!”
John froze in the process of pulling the duvet back.
He was still shivering a few moments later, and John asked, "You alright?"
"Fine," Sherlock sighed, pulling away from the mark he'd left on John's neck.
"Regent's Park is fine. It's all fine."
She shook her head and returned to her task. “You boys,” she muttered good-naturedly.
“You sure?”
"No. No! Let's just...er..." Sherlock was starting to breathe too quickly.
"Snogging first, of course."
"I--yes, I was. But this is so much more interesting than class, anyway, John! Listening to those miserable idiots trying to drill the periodic table into my head even though I've known it for five years--it's tiresome. Let's put my skills to better use, shall we?"
"I didn't know, I noticed. You've had minor cuts and burns attended to recently. Your wand arm is slightly more tense than the other, and your walk has acquired a slight...swagger that it didn't have before. All the signs of an Auror-to-be. So tell me, when did you begin training?"
John smiled and nodded, remembering those school gatherings during their first year together, how they would agree to sneak off together after "one more dance" that always turned into five. "Of course."
John raised an eyebrow as he was led over to the monkey bars. Sherlock sat on the ground, and urged him to do the same.
Just put clothes in the wash, headed upstairs for a bit of leisure before studying. Exam tomorrow.
"Oh." There was a wall of snow packed into the shape of the door. The wind could no longer be heard.
“Yes.”
"Well, that, and fantastic sex."
John laughed. "Yeah, okay. That one's easy. Two drops of Lethe River Water, two Valerian sprigs, two measures of Standard Ingredient, four mistletoe berries."
“Yeah?” John responded, rounding the corner into the sitting room.
"Make that two."
"Just because--"
"Oh, really."
“Me and Molly, yes.”
"Then it means everything. Budge up, you need another pin."
"Where was it?"
Before he knew it, Sherlock was blurting, "Exceedingly dull."
“Sherlock, I can—”
Sherlock took it sheepishly.
Wendy’s tinkling laugh filled the room in an unpleasant way, making the back of John’s neck prickle. “Oh, John, you haven’t seen these two at it. They’re constantly calling each other names. It’s all in good fun.”
Before he could stop himself, John snorted, “Does he ever?”
They walked in silence, sharing the same coat and squeezing each other’s fingers for support until John finally said nervously, “Now they’ll
"I...I, um..." He felt his cheeks burning.
"Besides, you have to go on a date first," John pointed out.
“Let’s get these clothes off, yeah? I’m not sleeping in my jeans.”
“What?”
“Right, right. Potions, I mean.”
“Of course. A good friend of mine. Anyway, I’ve got the upper hand, here, Sherlock. There’s no way for you to get him out of there without me.”
Sherlock cursed himself. He'd forgotten about Halloween. Of course John had plans, he actually had friends. And what had he been thinking anyway, that John would want to spend time with him? That he would want to go on a date with him?
He snaked his arms around Sherlock. "If it’s any consolation, I’m not completely opposed to the idea."
“I was worried about what would happen to you!” Sherlock said indignantly.
Sorry about the impromptu hiatus. I bought the entire Hey Arnold! series on DVD.
"John!"
"Look at her bookbag. Brightly coloured in the fashion of someone unaccustomed to carrying it around the city. She's also got sunglasses on her head that doing match her outfit, probably the only ones she brought with her. I'd say she's an American student, in London for a month or so."
the jumper.”
"I thought you'd been killed!" John nearly shouted, catching himself just before he'd done so. "Or something," he added halfheartedly, realizing how dramatic that had sounded.
"Don't you have friends in your class?"
Mycroft glared at his father, who stood at the sink chuckling. "That's none of your business."
“Hey, Molly,” John replied.
“Of course,” John replied. He craned his neck and turned to kiss Sherlock’s jaw, the only part of his face that he could reach.
“What?”
“John Watson,” he said, and John tensed.
!" Sherlock pressed, impatient.
He had to fight the urge not to laugh with delight at the sight of Sherlock in his element, bent over his broom, determined, tongue sticking out in concentration.
Sherlock had never seen John angry, so he wasn’t sure if he was actually upset with him. He actually seemed more confused than anything. “Fine. Alright. I do have an explanation, but it’s pretty unbelievable.”
It was a lot longer walk down that aisle than he remembered, with everyone in his immediate vicinity staring at him. He tried to block out their fond smiles as he walked, and nearly tripped over his aunt's handbag that was sitting in the aisle.
"That was completely different!" Sherlock protested.
I apologize for my lack of activity. Life got in the way. But I am back with episode 3, and episode 4 is coming very soon--it is this week's episode, after all!
They made their way carefully to the sofa and sat on opposite ends.
John, I just wanted you to know, I don’t care that you think you’ve moved on. I know you’ll come around. I just wanted you to know that I’ll be there ready to return when you call. I know it may take a long time. Weeks, months. Years, maybe. But you’ll come ‘round, there’s not a doubt in my mind. Even Mary thinks so. (She’s a good woman, John. You chose well.) I’m prepared for you to take as long as you need  to forgive me. But I’d appreciate it if you didn’t take
He was lying forlornly on the sofa when John approached with a sheet from their bed and laid it over him. "Are you going to eat anything?"
Sherlock looked confused. “We are...acquaintances now. I assumed that is what acquaintances do when one is to partake in a rather dangerous sporting activity.”
If John had been drinking something, he would have choked. Instead he stumbled over the shoe Sherlock had left in the middle of the floor.
“Of course.”
At the park, John amused himself by watching Sherlock studying beehives and the devices Muggles constantly used to communicate with each other (which John had to admit
“Yeah, I know.”
John's steps faltered, as though he were about to come to a halt. "How on earth could you possibly know all of that?"
"Alright," John chuckled. "The goal is to keep your head long enough to speak without stuttering."
“What I meant was…It’s going to take time, but…I could learn to love you again.”
“But why not?”
“There aren’t any…” He felt around the curtain before throwing it open to the rest of the small, tiled room in frustration. “…towels. We forgot towels.”
It didn't look like Sherlock had an answer, but regardless of whether he was about to reply, he didn't get to.
“No you won’t,” he replied dangerously.
Taking his perch on the couch, Sherlock looked annoyed. “I’m sorry, Sherlock. Keep it elevated,” John mumbled somewhat exasperatedly.
"How is it you're so ill-equipped for high altitudes?"
"Ah, but that's after a drink. At least I don't have the gall to get handsy in the back of a cab."
John grinned. “Why do you all of a sudden care about butterbeer?”
"I, John Watson..."
“Bet you never saw this coming.” He could hear the malicious smile through the earpiece. Still, he repeated the words, eyelids fluttering rapidly.
“Excuse me?”
John shook his head, smiling. "Of course you would overthink something like that." He kissed Sherlock, then drew away just enough to rest their foreheads together. "You're wrong about everyone loving me."
"Yes," John replied curtly.
“No, that’s not—I didn’t mean—it’s just, you like men.”
“Wouldn’t dream of it.” John smirked.
At first, he was silent. He just stared at John with wide eyes, looking shocked that he had been betrayed by his own arms. A moment later, there were tears streaming down his face, sobs racking his whole body, and he was clutching the left one, wailing in pain.
They were both silent.
“Yeah. ’Night Greg.”
“So I’m bisexual! What of it?”
"Do you still have your old suit?"
, did you say?"
“Sherlock? What are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be studying with—?” His father was cut off by a shriek from John.
Sherlock stepped back. "What?"
Sherlock’s breathing began to slow. “Sleepy, are we?”
John shuddered at his tone, then cleared his throat. "Well. Alright, then."
The officiant stopped and glared at him.
“I’d rather avoid accidents, yeah?”
“He and Mycroft don’t get on. They’re worse than Harry and me, if you can believe it.”
"You'll be alright with the grey tights, I'm sure."
Sherlock's face went red as he turned away, back towards his bedroom. "I look ridiculous."
"Family and friends, we are gathered here today to witness and celebrate the union of John Hamish Watson and William Sherlock Scott Holmes..."
John shook his head. "Forget it. It's late, we should get to bed."
"What happened to all of your doting concern?"
John heard Lestrade's voice from his mobile, but couldn't answer, too focused on keeping his breaths regulated.
His hands did not shake, his gaze did not waver. The bird of prey that flew overhead nearly went unnoticed. Still, he grinned to himself at the sight of it, even peripherally. It carried news too wonderful for words.
"A...a pirate? Why do
"Oh, I didn't do this," he muttered, cheeks going red.
“M-mum-my,” Sherlock sobbed, and then, when she tried to touch his arm, “NO!”
"I thought I'd keep Sherlock company while he was stuck outside," John countered, an eyebrow cleverly raised.
“Felix felicis.”
A few boys dropped their own stones as they swept away, cautiously mocking once they had gained a fair distance.
"Want to dance?" John pretended to suggest it casually, nearly laughing as he did so.
“Hey, Donovan.”
When he walked into the dormitory, he unconsciously glanced at Moran’s bed, just as he had every night since he’d been kidnapped. Increasingly often, Moran didn’t even make it back to bed. John hadn’t thought much of it when the behaviour began at the start of term, but it now forced him into a constant state of panic as to when his former friend might come up. He rarely got any sleep anymore, for fear of the psychopath coming in late while he was vulnerable.
“Of course. I called him a child.”
John bit his lip. "Say, why don't you find something for Molly? She seems to really like you."
“What happened there?” John asked, still trying to force his breath to catch up with his heartbeat.
“All or nothing, huh? Really?”
"John, John, John," Sherlock kept muttering weakly against his shoulder, smearing blood on his coat.
Sherlock’s head snapped around.
. John patted his chest absentmindedly, realizing with a sigh that he’d left his own brand-new Prefect badge in his trunk.
"Do you wanna watch telly?" John suggested.
"Why don't you go back to your mother?" Sherlock said.
"Hey!" John barked, and his friends started, alarmed at his tone. "Leave," he said dangerously.
John: 9
When Sherlock came, it was with a loud thump on the wall as his arms stretched out and his hands--now joined into a ball of fists--hit the headboard. John looked up at him in surprise. He could feel a bit of come about to drip from his chin.
“Sherlock, I’ll see you tomorrow,” John said, putting a consoling arm around him.
"Will I?"
“Be my guest.”
"Hi, Harry."
"Yes," Sherlock replied immediately.
“Come here,” he said. When Sherlock obliged, he pulled him in for a bruising kiss. “It’s alright.” He kissed him again, longer and deeper. “But, for the record, let’s not get threatened again. Because it seems to always be me that gets the bad end of that deal.”
"John. Where's Sherlock?"
It was a delicate dance, kissing Sherlock.
John snorted. "You and I remember that night very differently."
Violet stopped, then knelt down to Sherlock's level. "Are you worried about sleeping over?"
“Well, your brother thinks we’re shagging,” John sighed as he stepped into Sherlock’s private bathroom and handed him a towel.
At the sound of John in the doorway, Sherlock jumped and threw his arms over the parchment in front of him.
“John, I don’t see what this is going to do. I can’t make one.”
It was nice of Greg to invite them to his pool party, Sherlock knew, but he still wasn't overly fond of the stares he got from the older kids there. He'd only because John and Greg were rugby friends, and Sherlock and John were
"Oh, fuck, I don't know. Everything. But, considering we don't have lube, the options are a bit limited at the moment."
"Yes, thank you," Sherlock finally piped up, lifting his head dazedly as he finally decided that there would be plenty of time for nuzzling against John later, because he was not in any immediate danger, and they were relatively safe at school, and he was never going to let John leave his sight again, anyway.
me help you.”
John narrowed his eyes. “What kind of experiment involves a blowtorch in my bedroom?”
"How about chocolates? Everyone likes chocolates."
Sherlock: 11
"Oh, I already know I’m brilliant, and that you’re particularly attracted to dangerous situations, but I’m ‘attractive’? Really?"
“What?”
“John Watson, I am very disappointed in you.”
“Good.”
,” John said, appearing behind them, and Sherlock froze, his cheeks rapidly darkening to meet the shade of Molly’s.
"I don't remember agreeing to this," Sherlock muttered.
"Morning," Sherlock said shortly, without looking at him.
“Sherlock, what’s this?”
“Likely because they think the matters of children are petty. You’re only asking to avoid embarrassment with your peers,” Mycroft clarified.
Sherlock shrugged. "Something utterly boring, I'm sure."
John sighed. "Been abroad."
“What if I was to shoot you now? Right now?” Sherlock said, raising the gun a bit higher.
“Hush, now! I could just go to the pub and leave you here.”
“Yes, Sherlock, that’s exactly what we’re doing.”
make him want to either smile uncontrollably or shove him up against a wall and—
"Then why do you always look at John that way?"
“I suppose we should break for some pizza,” Sherlock sighed.
“It is, though,” John insisted. “It’s like when I met you I didn’t think you could be any different from any other new student.” He stopped, then looked at Sherlock, confused. “I don’t know why I just said that.”
“Yeah, I…it was nice,” he repeated lamely.
24 Dec--Chapter 18
“It’s lucky you aren’t able to seal your spells just yet,” Mr. Holmes remarked as his wife went about performing the necessary magic.
"Of course I do, he's my best friend."
Sherlock froze. "What?"
“Really?”
John looked up at the metal bars. “I don’t think you can, Sherlock.”
"Care to sit? Or are you in a hurry?"
“Of course. I’ll talk to you later.”
“No?”
“Sherlock, I know you hate not being able to do things, but that’s why you can’t give up now!” John grabbed his wrist before his wand made it to his pocket again. “Maybe you just need a stronger memory. What were you thinking of this time?”
“What?”
They stared at each other.
"They do?"
Molly sat down in the circle and raised her eyebrows. Sherlock sighed and sat next to her. John grinned as he sat, too.
"Yes, it would seem so."
“People do little else,” Sherlock muttered, then looked at John, a smile creeping at the corners of his lips and eliminating John’s insecurity in uttering something so absurd.
John waited until that night, after Sarah had fallen asleep, to check it again. There were three messages from Sherlock and one from Lestrade.
“Well, I was wondering if you might…”
The looks he got as he entered the school ranged from startled to confused. He sped through the halls, searching desperately for any sign of his mother or father. The whole way, John chirped and clapped. At one point, he grabbed ahold of Sherlock’s hair and pulled, hard.
Sherlock huffed in irritation.
Sherlock hesitated. "I...he....I can't talk about it, John."
“For what?” Sherlock asked, taken aback.
“Sorry, Mum.”
"Say, now my heart rate's gone back to normal, I'm getting a bit cold again."
“I cannot believe you got us into this mess.”
"Could've fooled me."
John just sighed in resignation. “Fine. Just make sure you actually wear those over your eyes, I don’t want to be called back here because you’ve blinded yourself.”
"Well, she always raises her hand, even when she doesn't know the answer. And she's rubbish at maths."
“I suppose not.”
"John?"
Thirty-two.
Sherlock sighed. "I suppose I'll wait, then."
“Mind if I sit here?” John asked.
Sherlock bit his lip. “Well, yes.”
“Well what do you expect, experimenting with those bloody potions all evening and neglecting your poor boyfriend?”
“January the sixth.”
"Would you mind...that is to say, do you want to..."
“What do you think it means?” John winked.
“So where do I play into that, exactly?”
"Well, I wasn't mistaken for a woman."
"Let's go!" he replied, not wanting to mention to Sherlock just how stunning he looked before he'd had a chance to bolster his own confidence.
John looked stumped. He looked like he was questioning everything he'd said up to now, wondering why he'd said used those particular words and kicking himself for not sounding more clever, and it struck a dangerously hopeful chord in Sherlock, one that was quickly drowned out with the voices he'd heard every day since primary school, the ones that told him he wasn't good enough, that he would never be normal enough to have friends, and that no one outside his family would ever love him. He hadn't heard those voices since starting at uni, but he hadn't experienced anything to the contrary either, save Victor, and so he took those voices as gospel.
"D'you want to talk about it?"
John was taken aback by Sherlock’s intimate knowledge with the location of the Gryffindor common room, but he couldn’t say he was incredibly surprised. He shook his head in resignation. “Sure. Fine. But you’ll have to hide around the corner or the Fat Lady won’t even speak to me.”
Mycroft seemed to be resisting the urge to wrinkle his nose as his mother said, “Well, it’s settled then. On Sunday night, we’ll have shepherd's pie. And for dessert?”
He smiled knowingly at John, who punched his shoulder again and said to Sherlock, "Drinks?"
going to do karaoke?" he asked skeptically.
. You and me."
Each day when his lectures ended, he would take the lift up to the third floor of his building, take the long walk to the end of the corridor where his room was, and slam the door on the world. The only people he saw outside classes were his roommate and the people he unfortunately had to endure being trapped in the lift with. He had taken to passing those few moments by deducing them. By the end of that first week, no one wanted to risk taking the lift, for fear of the new student with the piercing gaze.
“Where have you been?” Greg demanded as John scrambled into his scarlet robes.
Another memorable breakup was that which occurred on Shaftesbury Avenue in mid-June. Emily, her name was, which was surprisingly the most memorable thing about her, aside from the way she ended it. When Sherlock had come up with the absolutely mad idea to pose as fictional terrorists in order to expose some actual terrorists of the kind that speak the language of business and wear suits much more traditional than the typical villainous garb, John hadn't realized that the plan would require him to be dressed in that 'typical' garb at eight o'clock in the evening outside a restaurant in Soho--the very same restaurant where he had been planning on meeting Emily half an hour earlier. She would have ruined the effect of he and Sherlock dressing up as comic book villains and performing a scene if John hadn't insisted they step around a corner. Still, he couldn't keep her from causing a much more realistic one before storming off and shouting, "Don't bother phoning. Whatever it is you want, just let Sherlock
John's eyes widened. "Erm." He coughed. "Er, I--I...maybe..."
"You've never been stupid, Sherlock."
Sherlock opened his eyes. What he saw was the last thing he expected to see.
"Yes, I'll go with you."
Sherlock sighed dramatically. “I have to have
“Oh, God, draw the shades,” he groaned.
John sighed. Life was difficult when your boyfriend was a petulant child. “Good night, Sherlock.”
"Well, go on then, how the bloody hell'd you learn how to dance?"
“I don’t know, that’s the problem.”
Sherlock shushed him. "You're causing a scene." He looked around at the restaurant's other patrons. "Besides, it wasn't that funny."
John sighed with relief. “Is that what this is? A ‘relationship thing’?”
“Of course.”
“Not enough.”
These were precisely the reasons Sherlock liked spontaneity, and his moans only sped things along. Before they knew it, John was sinking down to sit on the floor next to where Sherlock still knelt, slack-jawed and wobbly.
"What if I want it to?"
“I know, it’s all in good fun. But if anyone catches you, sorry mate, I’m not sticking my neck out for that.”
John smirked. "Still bored?"
“I’m trying to find a simpler antidote to the Draught of Living Death. I’m so close. The bisnap beans are just giving me a bit of—”
“Why do you say that?”
“And what do you expect me to do about that?” Sherlock countered, the slightest trace of panic weaving itself into the words.
His blush deepened, but he didn't say anything. He thought about all the times he'd wondered whether they
“There’s a phone in the changing room.”
“What, ‘knickers’?”
“You’re just…pretty! You’re
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock didn't hesitate. "Befuddlement Draught."
The first Quidditch match of the season was to pit Gryffindor against Slytherin. In the days leading up to it, John was confronted in the typical ways by banter and hostility from both houses, hearing everything from the somewhat frightening “You better not fuck it up, John,” to the astonishingly playful “Are you ready to be annihilated, Watson?”
“Hello, Sherlock,” she said shyly, clearly trying not to look at John too closely. “Hi, John.”
"I'm glad Harry meddled."
the pot?"
"No?"
"And that concerns you
"What? Why?"
Sherlock was puzzled. What on earth could make Molly think he was keeping something from her? "Why would there be? What would I not tell you? I tell you everything."
Sherlock rolled his eyes and took it.
“I’m not wearing that thing,” Sherlock mumbled.
Sherlock hesitantly complied. His fingers were slight at first, but quickly grabbed onto John’s thumb, vicelike.
“Yeah, when I get back and he wonders why I haven’t been answering him from the next room.”
Sherlock quirked an eyebrow. "D'you have anything in your trunk that might be of use to us?"
"It didn't?"
This was preferable to dinner at Harry’s anyway.
"You'll be okay missing
"Thank you. Now, let's eat so that we can get back to your house and fall asleep on the sofa."
“What does this have to do with Polly Winston?”
"Please, I don’t need 'socially acceptable.'"
"Good night, Mrs. Hudson," Sherlock said. It was almost a command.
"Yeah, alright. If I trick or treat next year."
Sherlock shrugged as noncommittally as possible, but the truth was he had nothing else to do this evening, and the thought of John in a muddy kit…now
Harry looked at him with mild concern, but there was no trace of a desire to stop him. “Alright. But make sure you’re up early for first day of term tomorrow.”
“When is Sherlock’s birthday, by the way? He’s never told me.”
John didn’t know what to say. He’d never heard Sherlock speak that way, but he didn’t want him to stop.
"Can anyone tell me what I might have here?" he asked the room at large, and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
"Do you want to sleep in Mummy and Daddy's room?"
“Look, I don’t know what you’re on about. Sherlock and I
"Not at all."
Mycroft’s prim perch on the stiff armchair was met with Sherlock’s graceful flop onto the sofa. “Once you’ve eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable”—Sherlock took a deep breath—“must be true.”
“It’s working.”
"And what would he see?"
Late that night, John sat in the tiny apartment he was guaranteed to vacate before long, nearly tearing his hair out, he was so bored.
Shortly after John rang the bell, Lestrade was at the door.
If Mycroft’s jaw could hang any lower, it would have hit the floor already. “Junior Undersecretary?” he said incredulously, and the tension of the unspoken competition between the two cousins--an obvious extension their mothers'--was overshadowed by the sight of Mycroft actually incredulous.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Thanks. Is Sherlock ready?"
“Well, right up until Anderson came up with Flitwick.”
“Oh, hello, John,” Molly said brightly.
He could've
Sherlock nodded. Molly rubbed her shin where his heel had connected with it.
Without so much as a bubbly warning, the substance inside the cauldron exploded. Sherlock, almost on impulse it seemed, pushed John behind him. The smoke was thick and brown, and smelt of rotten cabbage.
, if you haven't heard it. It's sort of my pride and joy. (Shameless self-promo.)
“Come here!” John commanded. It was the only thing that seemed to reach Sherlock sometimes, and as John suspected, he did as he was told. “Sit,” he said, and gestured to the submerged stair beside him. He took a seat as well.
He sensed rather than saw Mrs. Holmes's beaming face. She tousled his hair softly and whispered, “Thank you, John,” softly enough that Sherlock couldn’t hear. He nodded minutely, smiling himself.
He paused briefly on the stairs and shook his head. He never would have missed an opportunity to turn down Potions before he met Sherlock. Christ, had Sherlock turned his life upside-down.
"Of course not," John replied. "Nor the time after that, nor the time after that."
"Well, sir, I must congratulate you on a somewhat clever murder scheme. I mean, it might have been good to get the poison off the premises. But as it is, I've got the Yard on call."
Don't misunderstand, he was over the moon about it. When John had taken his hand in the corridor and asked, "Is this alright?" his heart had leapt like he didn't know it could. But there was a nagging sensation at the back of his mind. Why had John taken his hand in the first place? Why him?
“The Black Lake,” he said to himself, and he was out the door in a flash.
“Didn’t your definition of ‘date’ include going out?”
“Holmes!” Stamford called, and John spotted the boy at the end of a row, sitting on the floor with a leatherback book covered in ominous stains. He looked up from the page, rolled his eyes on sight of his fellow Ravenclaw, and continued reading.
Sherlock felt his wide eyes and stiffening spine betray the calm he wanted to convey as he glanced hurriedly down to make sure his towel hadn't shifted in some indecent way.
Sherlock blushed. "I mean. You're not a drug."
He heard Molly sigh in frustration behind him, but as soon as he lifted his head to look at John, he knew he'd done the right thing. John's eyes shone with grateful tears, and he patted Sherlock's knee. "Alright, your turn, Jack," John said suddenly to the boy on his right, breaking his eye contact with Sherlock.
John sighed. “Yes, it’s him. He…I don’t think he even knows I’m gone.”
John smirked and turned to him, his hand still on the door handle. “You’re working on experiments. I know how you are, you’ll be at it for hours.”
Sherlock looked down and saw he'd taken only two bites in the time it had taken John to finish his own sandwich. "Right."
As soon as Uncle Rudy was gone, Sherlock followed John upstairs to his room, smirking to himself. He’d done everything in his power to fluster him throughout the visit, suggesting things with his body language and alluding to the things beneath his trousers—which admittedly,
“Sure, it’ll be dangerous. That’s why I need a
“What?”
John sat at the end of the sofa and pondered Sherlock’s confession for far longer than it had taken him to spill the beans. When he finally spoke, Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief just because he would no longer have to wait for his reaction.
“What happened?” his father asked urgently.
"Right. Sorry, Mike."
John offered a hand for Sherlock to shake. Sherlock blinked and took it.
"I suppose. Lestrade should thank me for mentoring them."
“Good evening Sherlock. And good evening to you, too, John. I hope you’re doing well in this drafty old house.”
This is cheating. I am fully aware.
“Can I get a blue cast?”
"Touché," Sherlock muttered, then, "If you must know, I was going to tell you what exactly I want to do with that waistcoat."
“Obviously.”
"Because fifth years aren't supposed to be able to make it."
Walking into the shop, there were stares. They were used to it by now--over the summer, John had matured quite nicely, and Sherlock, with his school uniform and the braces that made his lisp inescapable, looked juvenile next to him. So it was nothing new for them to go somewhere hand-in-hand and get a few disapproving stares. But most people who knew them just laughed at how deceptively large the age gap looked.
Sherlock froze as the rest of the class nodded. He hadn't much thought about his fears, but at that moment, there was only one that came to mind.
He rubbed his eyes. “I will be as soon as I get some sleep.”
“No, he doesn’t,” John answered before Sherlock could, enjoying this new line of questioning much more than the origin of their relationship. “I can hardly get him to eat half the time, and when he does, he mopes about it.”
John's eyes widened. "So it's
“Hello, Wilkes,” John responded in as polite and subordinate a tone as he could muster.
“Holmes, I wanted to introduce you to someone. This is John Watson, he’s—”
"Shut up and get over here," Sherlock demanded, chucking a pillow at him.
"She will, too. You're so sweet to think of her, but it'll blow over as long as you don't make a big deal of it."
"I don't! I don't like anybody."
John hesitated. "I used the wrong incantation for the jelly-legs jinx. Sorry." The look in John's eyes told him something else. He glanced at the other students surrounding them, and Sherlock understood: someone had interfered in their dueling practice.
“Ministry worker. Sent here on official business with the Headmistress, probably something to do with the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
“She was fine on the plane. I don’t know what—” He cut himself off and turned to Sherlock, who smiled one of his rare, bright smiles.
John stared at him, disinfectant in hand. “You mean you’re…you’re ticklish?”
"We won't be young forever. What about when I'm fourteen?"
The day was almost over by the time he’d managed to find a toilet, and his bladder was screaming for relief, so he was close to crying when the little man on the door appeared before him.
It took him all of five seconds to make up his mind. He stood, then dragged Sherlock to his feet as well.
"Yes, but there are people to take care of the roads there. Not to mention actual roads to take care of. And getting snowed in at home is very different from being stuck in a tiny cabin with a frustrated Sherlock Holmes."
“Any plans for this evening?”
When he popped back into existence, Wilkes looked around in bewilderment. He saw Sherlock and froze. “What did you do to me?”
“Come on, John, can’t we just forget it?”
Suddenly, Sherlock drew away, holding John at arm’s length as the swarm slowly faded.
“I hope so. You know for a genius, sometimes you can be unbelievably thick.”
“Nothing, John,” he replied, quickly folding up the parchment and stuffing it into his jacket pocket.
The strangest thing about starting at a new school was the lack of reputation to live up to or—as was more often the case when it came to other students—live down. No one knew his family, no one knew his past, and he was certainly grateful on both counts of ignorance, however short-lived they were likely to be.
He glanced over Sherlock’s shoulder just as his head fell forward to nip at John’s ear lobe and saw something that would have made him laugh out loud if there weren’t clever fingers running along the length of his clothed prick.
I'm down on my knees in an explosive tube carriage, begging for forgiveness. You have until next week to tell me how you feel.
John slapped his shoulder, half angry, half amused. "You git. We could've been doing this for months."
Sherlock looked up as John entered, then immediately looked away like a shamed puppy. “I needed my dressing gown,” Sherlock said quietly. “I was cold.” John couldn’t tell whether he was studying his foot that closely or if he actually felt foolish. It was a foreign thing for Sherlock Holmes to back down, even when he was wrong.
When Sherlock finally got his blue cast, John was the first to sign it, and none of the stickers that anyone put on it were allowed to go anywhere near his stick-figure pirate drawing.
“You’re supposed to wear them over your eyes, you know.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened. “Well. Fine. Then get out.”

“Really?” Mycroft replied skeptically.
“Jim? From the hospital?” When Moriarty moved, Sherlock raised his other hand to steady the gun. “Oh, did I really make such a fleeting impression? But then, I suppose that was rather the point.”
have. Why would I want to be a goblin?"
(You guys stopped leaving comments. What happened? It makes me sad. With such a momentous moment as the Moriarty reveal, I better get to see a reaction to that...)
They sat in comfortable silence for a few moments until Sherlock said quietly, “You said something earlier about your parents not being around anymore. What did you mean, exactly?”
John took a quick look at Sherlock's feet, instructed him to stay, then went to greet his sister.
The man went on, and as he did, Sherlock's nerves were put on ice. He was amused by the looks John gave him in response to some of the things the officiant said, and all uncertainty drained out of him.
“Sherlock?” When he reached the landing, Sherlock’s bedroom door was open wide, and Sherlock himself was sitting at his desk, quill in hand and scratching away at a piece of parchment. “Sherlock—”
“You’re ignoring me, Sherlock,” Jim said. He twirled his wand between his fingers while his other hand rested casually in his pocket. John almost asked him where he’d come by the audacity to act as though their last encounter hadn’t held the potential for murder by giant squid.

Sherlock shrugged. “You’ll learn in time. Now, shall I wait next to the painting of the Fat Lady all night or will you get Lestrade to come out and talk to me?”
It was surreal, being back in the city, even for as short a time as he'd been in Afghanistan. Nothing was different, but it all seemed that way.
“That’s probably for the best. Wouldn’t want your crazy sister scaring him off.”
Sherlock shook his head. "They say he fell as if faint, and a few people saw him frothing at the mouth as his horse trampled him."

"And?"
"John," Sherlock said suddenly, breaking him from his reverie, but still never breaking eye contact.
"Oh, not this again. Sherlock, you are not a bloody detective. You're a

“Perhaps you could give me an assignment like winning the next match, or—”
bad. There’s no shard in there or anything.”
Sherlock nodded, still unable to speak, fearing what he might say to offend John.
“We are literally stuck together.”
"You're hardly an authority figure, Lestrade. Not yet, at least."
John shrugged. "Decided I wanted to help people?"
When he finally came back, Sherlock clutched something close to himself. When John tried to catch a glimpse of it, it was immediately concealed by Sherlock's jacket as he put it on.
"To the market, then. For a nice box of chocolates."
“Stop.”
Sherlock stared at him in disbelief. “Cute?” he said finally. “I’m cute?” He practically spat out the word as though it tasted awful on his lips. John rolled his eyes.
"Well, you see, I was—"
Just outside the room, Sherlock pulled John back toward him and hissed in his ear, “Are these the trousers I put on when you were in the room?” Then he slipped past him into the sitting room, leaving John red-faced and wide eyed.
"Whatever you say, John," Sherlock replied, diving in to mouth at John's throat. Then he stopped. "You know that I'm not going to actually do it, right?"
“You said a bad word!” Harry piped up, and Mycroft rolled his eyes.
"What do you mean?"
John looked amused. "What?"
He noticed she didn't ask about Sherlock. Frankly, he was glad she didn't.
John scooted over in his sleeping bag, and Sherlock joined him.
Sherlock shrugged.
"Nor do I," John replied, equally as bitter.
"How did she get in?"
Still, his bowstring drawn back, Sherlock kept his arrow aligned with the man’s heart, if he had one.
John nodded as they boarded the Bus and disappeared.
Slowly, a warm smile returned to John’s lips, and he slid his hand across the table to grasp Sherlock’s. Sherlock jumped a bit at his touch, but quickly adjusted and smiled in return.
“Molly!”
"Sherlock?" John prompted at the look on his face.
"Sherlock, you know Madam Pomfrey’ll have our heads if she comes in here tomorrow morning and finds you over here."
"Sherlock, what did you see?"
“Christ,” he muttered, trying to no avail to stifle the small flame. “
“And you can’t control your powers.”
“Because Muggles fascinate me,” Sherlock clarified before John could ask, paying no mind to the fact that John was literally on top of him. “They’re so strangely intelligent, non-magical people. Have you seen some of the technologies they’ve developed to cope with the absence of magical abilities? It’s truly extraordinary.”
John stared at him. "I got shot."
"Sure. Mike?" John indicated the door with a tilt of his head, so that Mike would follow them. Sherlock remained silent, breathing in the distinct smell of John, clearing out the horrible stench from the boggart.
John shook his head. He could practically hear the eye-roll.
The best way to keep track of any suspicious activity among students, Sherlock decided, was to continue attending lessons as normal, if not more often than was typical of him.
John smirked. "You think so?"
“Sherlock, I’m leaving.”
“Would you like to go to the cinema with Molly and me Friday evening?”
Sherlock glared at him, but he knew better than to argue with the opinion of someone who’d just been given magic truth-chocolate. “Fine. But you’re not to say a word about this to anyone.”
eat?” They turned onto a deserted side-street.
John hadn’t slept a wink the night before, and so an empty compartment had been welcome onceClara had come to find Harry and drag her off with some other sixth years. John had been left to lie down across one of the seats and let himself drift off. He had expected Moran or Mary or maybe even Stamford to come in and disturb him, but miraculously the door had remained shut and no one had bothered him.Changing into his school robes, he left his tie loose around his neck, not wanting to tighten it until the very last second.
“What’s wrong, mate?” Moran said, walking up behind and clapping him on the shoulder.
"Regent's Park, I was thinking. Right down the street and all." John entered the sitting room with the small picnic hamper he'd been loading. "Unless you've got a better idea."
"Is there anyone else I need to worry about?" John said, smirking.
"I know, but…perhaps this was a bad idea."
Sherlock's face may as well have been a radish at the memory, and John couldn't help but smile at the image produced by Harry's initial story, the one that had spawned the idea of a ball to begin with. As he'd waited for John in what had been the empty Gryffindor common room, Sherlock's boredom had gotten the best of him, and he was well into what Harry described as "a performance of epic proportions" when she came to the bottom of the stairs.
A few electric minutes passed before either of them spoke again. “So why is it that you go chasing all of these mysteries? Why do you risk being expelled?” John asked softly, more curious than accusatory.
“Not if you listen to it the way I am.”
"I miss the summer holidays when we got to be together all the time!" Sherlock whined.
Sherlock rolled over to retrieve his wand from the pile of robes on the floor and silently swept their mess away. John was too content to protest the use of magic for something so simple, not to mention his eyelids were becoming heavier as the minutes ticked by. Before long he and Sherlock were wrapped up in each other and breathing heavily in sleep.
"Too bad. It makes me feel safer," John countered.
“I’ve got a present for you.”
First, it was the explosion he'd caused in the lab. Then, the report he'd forgotten to write, followed by a call from Mycroft to tell him that their mother was ill, and a letter from the university reminding him to get his tuition fees in on time right on its heels. There was no reason for Sherlock to be happy, and so he had no qualms with sulking around the flat all evening, still fully dressed but for his shoes and jacket.
“Mycroft!” Sherlock hissed, sticking his head into the kitchen. John was sitting lazily on the sofa in the sitting room, commenting on all of Sherlock’s father’s questionable design choices.
