Warning: very light humiliation (mostly due to Dean's perception), downtime, kissing
Dean had to sit up for a bit, balance his bearings before starting again.  Castiel's hand rested reassuringly on his shoulder as he sat, waiting for his stomach to settle, for his head to stop spinning.  When Dean leaned forward again, the hand remained, sliding naturally down his spine and onto his rounded backside.
“Dean, good to meet you.”  His grip was firm as he shook hands behind Castiel's back.
“Would you like to go to bed?”
Dean released a small noise that could have been a whine and his eyes became sad.  Castiel wondered if Dean wanted to end their playtime; after all, dinner was technically over.  He gave Dean the choice.  “If you want to, you can stand and I'll know that means you're ready to stop.  If not, go be a good kitty and lay by the couch.”
Castiel dragged Dean into his lap and Dean saw his favorite gummy smile spread over Castiel's face.  “I'd swoop over your village, grip you tight, and burn down the bastards that tied you up in the town square.”
Sticky, sweet, warm.  Dean's lips tasted like hot apples and cinnamon.  Castiel licked into his mouth, moaning his claim.  He laid over him, his legs straddling one of Dean's.  Feeling his sub warm and pliant beneath him, Castiel knew he'd done well.  “Apples are your favorite, huh?”
Dean had called him before his shift started, thinking he could get it out of the way and ease the nervous twist of his stomach.  Instead, the failure of a phone call left the mechanic in a rotten mood for the rest of his afternoon.
“Does, uh… Is Cassie there? Can I talk to him?”
Castiel considered it; glancing at his watch he noted how late it was getting.  “I will take your preference into account.  Would you rather I finish this massage, or I can stop and we will have downtime now?”  He pulled his hands away to wait for a response.  His palms itched in the silence, wanting to return to their ministrations. Dean's body squirmed beside him; it seemed like he wasn't ready for Castiel to stop either.
Dean used the time at Castiel’s feet to eat more carefully than ever before, to show his Dom that he could turn on submission even after having a taste of control.
Dean sighed and pushed aside his other thoughts temporarily.  “It doesn't.  It's... just don't ask me to call you Daddy, OK?”  Dean was conflicted.  Although he thought it was sweet when Castiel referred to himself as the kitten's daddy, calling Castiel Daddy felt very wrong.  He didn't want a father; fathers let you down.  He wanted someone stable and predictable, someone he could depend on.  He wanted a boyfriend.  And beyond that, Dean admitted to himself, he wanted a Dom.  He wanted to belong to Castiel.
Dean's eyes widened for a second before he leaned in with obedience.  Castiel's kisses were more intoxicating than the sting of whiskey and Dean lost himself in his thirst for more.
Whatever the reason for their silence, Castiel felt that he owed it to himself and them to explain his motives.  He knew the spirits had seen his books, but maybe they didn’t understand the hunter life.  Maybe they thought he was out to get rid of them.  He wanted a chance to clarify that he wasn’t interested in sending anyone away.  Not, of course, unless that was what they wanted.  He had never thought that maybe the spirits with him would want to enter a final peace.
“Yes, Sir.” Dean held out a few options so his Dominant could choose.
“Thank you, Dean,” a quick glance at the paper gave him a name to go with his freckled face.
He could smell the lemon dish soap on his hands.
His antics drew a low chuckle from Castiel as he brought his hand back to his side.  “
Dean does not tie Cas down.  Cas has near full mobility and is wrapped in rope around his arms individually and then his body separately.  His legs are not bound until he expressly tells Dean to do so.
Dean knelt with feigned patience, watching Castiel's thumb with jealousy as it dipped into the bowl.  Castiel carded his free hand through Dean's hair and Dean brought his face closer, letting the moist heat fill his nose and warm his face.  It smelled even better than the night before, the ingredients having had time to get acquainted.  His mouth watered imagining the new depths of flavor.
“Of course I didn't tell him about the pie.”
Gabriel smiled, “Cannot believe that I’m a Dad.”
“Correct.”  Castiel knew the contract by heart and did not need to look at the specific paragraph to verify.
“Watch it,” someone grumbled.  A pair of rough hands shoved him hard from behind and Dean stumbled into the mass of brain-washed drones.  Their arms flailed about as they spazzed to their sorry excuse for music.
It had been years since Castiel's last relationship, but that fact was quickly becoming easy to forget.  With the regularity of his visits to Alistair's, Castiel had grown accustomed to fantasizing about a certain pair of hazel-green eyes.  The exhibitionist took on such a prominent role in his thoughts, that Castiel no longer felt single, alone.  Castiel's favorite fantasies were of his attentiveness to the sub, giving him just want they needed after an intense scene.  He imagined the sub collapsing into his arms, allowing him to provide the praise and comfort he craved.  Rarely was aftercare featured on the stage; and so Castiel's imagination ran wild.
Dean rolled his shoulders, “So, dinner...”
With an amused shake of his head, Dean took the fabric from Castiel. “It’s a baby wrap.”
“I am utterly indifferent to sexual orientation,”  Castiel stated plainly.  “However, to clarify, Anna and I did not have a sexual relationship.  She preferred to be kept as a pet.”  Castiel watched as Dean's eyes lit up.
“Couch or bed?” Dean asked as they dressed in their nightclothes.
The air in the pizzeria was warm, thick with the smells of melting cheese and tomato.  They stood, holding each other in a quiet stare for a long moment.  Dean felt he could lose himself in Castiel’s brilliant blue eyes.  He felt safe, in a way he probably shouldn't feel in the presence of a stranger.  A voice came from the kitchen counter, startling them both. “Winchester?”
Finally, Castiel spread his fingers and weaved their hands together.  “I thought I might get to spend some time with my little cub.  Do you think you are feeling up to it?”
Castiel almost laughed in surprise.  "Wow, already?  You must really have a sweet tooth,“ his poor attempt at light humor.
consider this a date, Castiel wanted to make the best impression he could.  Castiel’s heart fluttered in his chest at the consideration that Dean may truly want to date him.  During their first conversation at Bar A, Castiel understood that Dean would probably be open to the idea of Castiel teaching him more about the D/s relationship.  But Castiel hadn’t truly allowed himself to entertain the hope that Dean would want to be in a relationship with him.  Castiel paused a moment, acknowledging the way Dean has burrowed into his life and altered his routine so easily.  Of course, Friday nights at Alistair's were focused on watching his sub.  Actually dating the man?  Yes, that was worth a change in routine.
They fought a bit and it became part of it, part of the fun, part of the build.
Dean hadn't moved from his spot, still curled around the pillow, asleep.  Castiel hesitated to wake him, but there was no reason why Dean should miss work.  Castiel sat on the edge of the couch and dragged his forefinger down Dean's nose.  He did this a few times before Dean twitched under the ticklish touch.  Dean scrunched his nose and swatted at the annoyance.  “Time for bed,” Castiel informed him.
When customers started requesting him by name, Alistair’s interest in Dean became more of an obsession.  He approached Dean with the promise of unlimited earning potential.  The idea of performing hadn’t appealed to him right away.  But after watching the other employees on stage and getting to know the staff personally, the atmosphere started to seduce him.  Alistair allowed him to audition as a Dom and a sub, although now Dean realized Alistair knew he would hire him as a submissive all along.
DW: yeah?
“See you soon.”  Dean pushed the hair from Castiel’s forehead before giving him a brief kiss.
When the doorbell rang, Castiel nearly jumped out of his skin.  He hadn’t eaten anything.  He should have eaten something.  They’d be out for hours, possibly drinking.  He really hadn’t thought this through.
Castiel looked up at him with eyes of the brightest blue.  Dean hadn’t ever seen him look so pleased with himself.  “What did they want?”
“Sorry,”  Dean began, his voice soft once again, “it's just...”
Scooping up the bread with his hands, Dean placed them in a cloth-lined basket. “It's fun.”  He peered over his shoulder at Castiel, “And when I'm kneeling, I can't see you make the faces.”
Their tongues warred feverishly for a taste of each other.  Dean lifted his arms, trying to pull Castiel on top of him.
Castiel felt the urge to recoil as Dean lashed out with forked tongue.  He didn't want to gag him.  He wanted to know what was going through Dean's mind that would cause him to react like this.  Instead of backing down, Cas stood himself tall.
“I thought I might wait out morning here,” Castiel's response was met with Dean's noncommittal shrug and a glance toward the bedroom. “On the couch,” Castiel clarified.  “Like you said.  Wandering the city at 2AM is not something I look forward to.  Unless it would be an imposition.”
He read through their latest entries before sending them each an email.  Castiel wrote about his and Dean's relationship, what had transpired thus far, and asked if they thought his leniency was creating a disturbance in the dynamic between him and Dean.
Dean wagged his eyebrows and laughed.  “I have plenty of ideas about the sexual aspects of our relationship.”
Meg raised her eyebrows in a way that said,
“Yes, sir!”  Dean rolled out of bed to make them a fresh pot for the morning.  He'd emphasized the 'sir' to let Cas know that he hadn't forgot about their schedule.  Today he was back to being his submissive for the weekend.  It was something Dean found that he was actually looking forward to.
“Well, no. But he's wearing your socks and, I bet, your underwear.”
“You can’t know that.”
Dean furrowed his brow and waited for Gabriel to continue.  He was pretty sure this was some kind of apology for post-birthday arguments and awkwardness.  And Dean had no intentions of making it any easier for the guy.
Clinking his cup against Dean’s, Castiel giggled.  He wasn’t sure whether Dean had called him angel or honey, but either one was lifetimes better than buddy.
With a crooked smile, Dean rolled his eyes.  “I had hoped this was a date.”
Sexual situations - of the oral persuasion.
Sam’s laughter carried over the speaker, “Surprised you can keep up, Jerk.”
“I apologize if I’ve offended you in any way.  I’m afraid I am a bit out of practice.  If you have some way to answer, please try.  I don’t… I’m truly hoping that I have not imagined your company. I’d like to help you, if I may.  You have lent a hand with much on my behalf.”
“Ha. Do you like it?”  He smiled nervously at the buzzing crowd, but Castiel seemed used to the pre-race commotion.
Dropping down to a knee, Castiel took Dean's face into his hands.  He carded his fingers through Dean's silky, wet hair in farewell.  “I'll see you tomorrow, Kitty.”  He placed a soft kiss to his forehead.  “Can you find Dean for me?  It's time for him to get dressed and to help me make breakfast.”
“For doing what I wanted without permission.”
Castiel nodded, but it was never that easy.  He felt guilty for dragging Dean through this with him and he tried his best to deal on his own.  Castiel allowed Dean to fix his shirt and knot his neck tie.  When Dean tightened it against his collar, Castiel felt a little closer to human.
They never lacked for conversation and Dean was always eager to learn more about Castiel.  After a few hours, Castiel excused himself and thanked Dean for his hospitality and company.  Dean didn’t think he could have asked for a better night.  Their interactions were marked by an undertone of Dominance and submission, without stifling Dean in the process.  He wondered if this had counted as a date.  “Can I give you a ride home?”
Dean turned at the touch, his hands going immediately to his ears.  “Cas!  Jesus, buddy.  Don’t sneak up on a guy like that?”
The drive home was too short.
They received their running bibs and start time before being invited to mingle at the park.
“He needs fluids.”  Castiel answered and granted Sam closer inspection.  “I suspect he’ll require hospitalization if we don’t act quickly.”
Dean had assumed correctly regarding the food.  After feeding Dean three slices of pizza, Castiel was able to put down all of Dean's crusts and nibble through a slice of his own.
Dean took that as a cue to stay put, though curiosity threatened to get the best of him.  He sniffed harder than before which only led to a snorting, coughing fit.
Castiel shoved his hand into Dean’s and pulled him along until they were standing in the dark parking lot.  His breathing came in uneven huffs and Dean heard him stutter for the first time, “I-it’s going to f-fall on me.  Those idiots screwed up and it is g-going to fall on m-me.”
Dean nodded his head, disappointed he was missing out on whatever had made Castiel so proud of himself.  “Yes, sir.  Did you make dinner?”
At first, Dean thought that Sam would clear his throat or drag Cas away or do something that would indicate that he was not OK with his friend being all touchy-feely, but time passed and Sam didn’t mention it.  The brat was smiling at them instead.
Sam laughed again.  “So he’s all prepared for a relaxing jog and checkered blanket lunch date, and you’re going to throw him into a post-apocalyptic nightmare.  So romantic.”
“Oh, yeah?”  Dean teased, “What was that?”
For Castiel to speak would be to break the spell, so he remained silent.  He could understand how Dean would give pause before sealing his fate to Castiel.  He only hoped that the spirit would make his decision before their chance was lost.
They took the long drive with the windows open, Castiel checking the rearview mirror every minute to check on Dean and to ascertain directions from Sam.  Sam led them over the highway and through the back roads to the house he said belonged to their uncle.  Every now and again, Dean would wake enough to drink from the bottle of juice and Sam would carefully tip the drink into his brother’s mouth.
Dean squeezed Castiel’s knees in his arms, wrapping his hands underneath.  He hated to hear Castiel talk like that, like spending time with him could be anything less than amazing.  But now Dean understood a little better why Castiel was so insistent on honesty and downtime.  Castiel didn't become hostile or passive aggressive when Dean expressed his feelings about the scene.  Instead, he seemed relieved.
But Dean did see and he was there and he wanted to help.  Staring at Castiel's slumped shoulders and bowed head, Dean over-thought every word and action.  He knew he had to stop pressing Castiel to talk.  Biting down on his tongue to keep from asking, again, if Castiel was all right, Dean followed Castiel into his home.
Dean blushed and turned his face into his plate.  He didn't hesitate to start shoveling fork-fulls of food into his mouth and had gone through two whole pancakes before taking a break to breathe.  “What did you dream about?”
The last command sent a chill down Dean's spine.  He was sure Castiel could feel the hairs sticking up on the back of his neck.  “Yes, Sir.”  Even hearing himself say those words stirred up feelings of desire.  Cas had never kissed him or touched him sexually during their D/s time and Dean's excitement began to grow at the thought that tonight could be the night Cas would finally decide they were ready for more.  The kiss on Tuesday was wonderful, but not nearly enough by Dean's standards.  Dean thrilled at the idea of being grabbed by the hair, bite marks bruising on his skin, Cas's mouth forging an assault on his.  He wanted to know what it would be like to watch Castiel finally lose control, to see his lips swollen from kissing him fast and hard.  His eyes glazed over as he sank deeper into the fantasy.
Dean lifted himself to his knees and pressed his thighs against Castiel’s upturned ass. As he thrust into his fist and rocked against Castiel’s body, he could imagine he was balls deep inside Cas. His hand and hips worked in sync and quickly brought him to the edge, but Dean wasn’t sure if he was really supposed to shoot his load on his Dom. “Sir?” His hips stuttered and Dean gripped the base of his dick hard.
Dean took another big bite of his sandwich and smiled.  He wondered if he could trick Cas into thinking he really had asked the women upstairs.  He chewed until he could swallow and then smiled some more.  In the end, he thought better of it and came clean.  “C'mon, man.  You know I'm just fishing for information; the least you can do is play along.”
Gently, Dean maneuvered Castiel to the bed.  Pleased to see Castiel’s eyes remained shut, Dean kissed his partner’s wrists and eyelids.  “That’s it, Baby. Just breathe.  Let go for me.”
Castiel tilted his head in curiosity.  “I make you nervous, Dean?”
Dean felt his pocket buzz with an incoming call.  The unnamed number could have been anyone, but his breath caught in his throat at the thought that it might be Castiel.  “Hello?  This is Dean.”
It surprised Castiel to find that there was already a crowd gathered in the front seats near the stage.  He did not recognize the performers.  A Domme he had not seen before moved around the stage with arrogance.  The submissive was covered in a latex suit - not leaving much by way of identifying features.  Castiel took a private booth; his preference was to view the scene from the side.  It allowed total view of the submissive as he knelt before his Domme.
“Yes.  I wasn’t ignoring you or zoning out on purpose.  Before dropping you off last night, being fed by your hands was the closest thing I had to that.”
Sam huffed into the phone, causing irritating static to crackle over the line.  “Jesus.  I guess I'll just go fuck myself.  You know, I haven't heard from you in a week.  And in case you forgot, last time you called me you were crying, asshole.”
“Duh.  She's into this raw vegan diet so I signed us up for a class on preparing raw meals at the farmer's market.  After that, I was thinking we'd go to a local park for a hike and picnic.”
With Dean out of the way, he was able to sneak into the kitchen and set the pie to bake.  Not preheating the oven was definitely some kind of blasphemy but they didn't have time for that and Castiel didn't think it mattered.  He covered the edge of crust with foil and set the timer for 50 minutes.  Castiel estimated that in half that time the entire apartment would be smelling like hot apple pie.
Dean kept his eyes on the floor, “It can wait.”  Running a hand over his face, Dean took a deep breath.  “You should eat, Cas.  We'll talk after.”  He hoped Castiel wouldn't be too offended by his criticisms.
When the nurses stepped out of the way, Kali welcomed them with a look of exhaustion and pride. The baby was a purple-red color; her dark hair was striped with amniotic fluid and she looked like her skin would feel sticky. Dean stood shyly at the foot of the bed while Gabriel and Castiel flocked to Kali’s sides.
“I’m sorry.  When he came in tonight I thought I recognized him from the club.  I could have given you warning, but I was… distracted.”
“Shh,” Dean stroked Castiel’s neck, running his thumbs under his line of stubble.  He wasn’t sure what the audit would entail, but it sounded bad.  Seeing Castiel so shaken set Dean to action.  He wished he could take Cas away from this place to where everything was better.  He kissed Castiel’s forehead, “Let’s go home.”
Castiel raised his voice as he stomped around the apartment 'in search of' the cub.
“You don't have to stay,” Castiel said with more energy in his voice than Dean had heard all day.  “I won't be much fun today.”  He stood a step or two further from Dean than they were used to, but his posture was open.
Castiel turned his mind from analyzing the silence and sent himself to bed.  He was reminded that things were good, really good, between him and Dean; there was nothing to worry about.
From personal practice, Dean could tell Castiel was slipping into the floating dream-world of being bound.

“He doesn’t answer when I…”
An unspoken promise passed between them and Dean released Castiel’s arm.
Dean pulled away, his plump mouth red.  He nodded, accepting Castiel's instruction and walked past him to the bathroom.
“You look hungry.  Let's eat.”  Castiel brushed past Dean and pulled out a stool for each of them at the counter.  “Sit.”  Castiel rewarded Dean with a bright smile when he complied, seating himself in the stood beside him.  Even thought they were in Dean’s kitchen, he felt surprisingly comfortable being led around by Castiel.  He even noticed his body was responding in sparks of arousal whenever Castiel gave expressions of gratitude or praise.
Castiel's mouth twitched, but he couldn't find it in him to smile.
“You'll want kids of your own someday, yes?”
1 Text Message from Unknown Caller
Castiel let out a light chuckle as Dean walked away with their dishes in hand.  His boyfriend’s ass taunted him until it disappeared into the kitchen.
Dean couldn't agree more.  Sam explained 5-K is just over three miles and Dean was confident he could make it happen.  Eventually.
A short groan escaped Dean's lips as his body responded to Castiel's touch.
“You train and then you participate.”  Castiel kept his face front as they completed another lap.
As the page came together, Castiel included a little blurb about how he started his business.  Anyone who read the newsletter would be able to tell the beekeeper was somewhat of a self-made loner.  Of course, the only one who would ever see the article was Dean.  And maybe Dean would understand that it was lack of practice in conversation that had ruined their interaction.  Maybe Dean would understand he hadn’t meant any harm.
Dean's mood only got worse as the day went on.  As he helped Garth remove the dashboard of an older Ford, he grumbled about working on the weekends.  And when Garth tried to engage Dean in some controversial small-talk about Chuck Norris and Clint Eastwood, he wasn't having it.  Instead of debating with Garth, citing movies as evidence to support his claims as he usually did, Dean snapped.  He told Garth that, in no uncertain terms, Eastwood could blow Norris away without sparing a thought about it.  Point blank period.  End of conversation.
“That sounds agreeable.  How would you like to explain the cubs absence?”  Castiel reached out to run his fingers through Dean's hair, curling around his ear.  “Has he been hiding in the apartment since the weekend, or maybe he ran off to explore?”
A whine crackled within Dean's throat as his fingers released the button of his pants.  The swollen head of his length bounced free of the fabric, already glistening with precum.
Castiel didn’t call him ‘Sir’ and Dean was ambivalent about putting that responsibility on his Dom-now-sub.  It wasn’t a stipulation outlined in their new contract during bondage play, but Dean still wondered if it was something Castiel would prefer.  Then again, if Cas wanted to address Dean as ‘Sir’ or ‘Master’ or even ‘Mr. Winchester,’ he could easily do so without direction.
“Of course.”  Dean thought back to their nap when he woke to find Castiel’s hand blue with cold.  If Cas had told him what he needed, Dean could have tied him properly.  Cas’s sloppy work could have easily resulted in serious injury.  Communication was key.
Castiel’s brow drew together as he witnessed the man stumble and stutter.  Maybe the heat had done a greater number on him than he thought.  Either way, the awkward banter left Castiel with a feeling like butterflies in his stomach.  He watched until Dean turned around, snuck a peek at his butt, and blushed when he was caught by a quick glance over his shoulder.
“Once more.”
The man blinked up at him with a grimace.  “Ow.”  He turned onto his side and covered his face with his hands.  Castiel froze.  The man gave no indication that he was uncomfortable in the lap of a stranger, so Castiel was careful not to startle him.  His hands hovered awkwardly where they had been carding through the man’s hair.  He didn’t know how long the man laid there, but it was long enough that Castiel had to remind himself to breathe.
“Yes, sir.”  Dean washed the dishes thoroughly to prove that he could complete his assignments well.  He could be good, even as a sub.  Dean set the last plate in the drying rack and then walked to where Castiel was sitting on the couch.  Castiel was sitting back, his left arm draped along the armrest.  His expression was eerily calm as he directed Dean to face the wall beside him.  Castiel stood up and arranged Dean how he wanted him.  “Bend at the waist and lay your palms flat against the wall.”
They had the rest of the weekend and Dean wouldn't let thoughts of Michael sour their time together.
Dean nodded, that wasn’t really news to him.
Guilt flooded Dean's veins as he remembered the bible full of cash on his bookshelf, but there was no way in hell he would bring that up now.  He tucked his whole money situation into a neat little box, duct taped the shit out of it, and stowed it deep in the closet of his mind.
Seeing Cas linger in the doorframe, Dean smiled and sang aloud.  “Baby, if I think about you, I think about love.”  He kept his head down as his smile grew.  His heart leaped with hope that tonight would be better.  “...  I would give you both night and day of satisfyin'.  Feel like makin'... Feel like makin' love.”
He reached out to him, with his hand that had once been flame, and felt for the spirit’s energy.  He expected something like the shock of touching a live wire, so infuriated his friend had been.  What he felt instead was a pleasant surprise; Dean’s spirit had returned to its former chill.  Dean no longer gave off waves of anger and disappointment, which Castiel took to be a blessing.
Castiel continued, “Do you- Could you give Dean a message from me?”
There was no heat to it, not initially.  As the flame curled and twisted around his arm, the last of the bowl’s ingredients smothered to ash.  Castiel examined his hand before holding it outstretched before him.
Gabriel snuck into the bed beside them. “Make some room for me? I want to get some gooey baby time before they whisk her away.”
Castiel flinched at the contact and Dean's throat went dry.  He dropped his hand and swallowed before turning away.  “I'll be right back,” he said with a soft promise.
work, that they were still ironing out the wrinkles.
“Babe!” Dean exclaimed, “This is my disgusting undead brother, Sam.”
“You have me,” Castiel agreed, but the line of his mouth revealed his uncertainty.
While they ate, Castiel asked questions about Dean's week at work to which Dean gave honest answers.  Castiel gave varying statements of praise and remarked at how smart Dean was to be able to diagnose and treat so many different kinds of vehicle.  Dean didn't feel like his skill as a mechanic was anything to brag about, and it felt weird to have Castiel describe his work like he was some doctor that could heal machines.  Doctors and lawyers made a real difference in people's lives, not a grease monkey like Dean.  That's why everyone was always so impressed with Sam, anyway.  He got himself into college and was making something of himself.  He expressed as much to Castiel.
Castiel doesn't feel the passage of time but for the change in water temperature.  The steam cleared and with it went the warmth.  Shivering in the tepid bath, Castiel finally rallied himself to wash up and drain the water.
“Are you alright?”  Castiel's eyes were clear of the fog that had settled over them the past two weeks.  Dean could tell something had changed for the better, for now.  It broke his heart to know that his first thought was to wonder how long it would last.  Navigating Castiel's depressed mood was like walking on broken glass and Dean was tired of getting cut.
Dean gasped as Castiel dragged a finger underneath his scrotum.  He had to say something, but there were no words.
Dean saw the title screen for Discovering Dragons, or some such thing, flickering on the television in a blaze of fire.  He was pretty sure it was another mockumentary, like the mermaids and sasquatch, and he wondered what it was about mythical creatures that Castiel found so captivating.
He locked the shower head back in it's stand, turning the spray against the wall.  With his hands now free, Castiel stripped off his outer clothes so they would not ruin.  Dressed in his undergarments, he stepped into the bathtub and squatted beside Dean's shivering form.  “Shh.  I'm right here.”  He held out his arms and waited for Dean to accept his touch.  Dean melted into his arms, savoring the kind of warmth that he hadn't realized he had been missing.  It was not only the body heat he craved, but the embrace disclosed Castiel's deep concern for him.  Dean couldn't remember a time when he had enjoyed another person's touch like this.  He had become used to drunken hook-ups and one-night-stands.  Strangers using each other for counterfeit intimacy.  Dean didn't want to think about it.  Didn't want to consider how so much of Kitty's story mirrored his real life.
DW:  Not doing that kind of thing anymore, man.  Thanks.
“Dean?  Is Cassie with you?”  It was Gabriel.  He sounded more breathless than Dean.
Dean's hands pressed into the cool tile as he waited at Castiel's feet.  The man standing over him prepared their dinner dishes separately – a plate of thighs and kale for himself and a bowl for the pet.
“So, what about today?”  Dean asked sincerely.  He had finished with the plates and now leaned back against the counter-top as they spoke.
“Cas! What did you…”  Dean moved quickly to free his hand and tossed the rope aside.  As he massaged the life and blood back into Cas’s hand, he couldn’t decide if he was angry or just scared.  His hands kneaded Castiel’s muscles from his shoulder to his fingertips.  Cas cringed as blood returned to his fingers; his skin prickled and ached.
Castiel was a man with a rather strict routine.  Monday through Friday he worked as the office manager at a moderately sized pediatric practice.  He juggled the chaos of clients, doctors, nurses, assistants, billing, charts, and payroll in meticulous order.  And for the past nine months, Castiel closed the office on Fridays at 8 and headed straight to the bar.  The cook usually had his order ready as he took his seat at the end of the counter: beef burger, cooked to medium, double cheddar, double bacon, dash of hot sauce, toasted seedless bun.  He always ate on the main restaurant floor, washing down the meal with a glass of iced water.  After, he flashed his ID and made his way down to the club.
, Dean's brain suggested helpfully.
Dean was still behind the door, but his posture had relaxed from fear into a guarded interest.  He watched Castiel return to his spot on the bed.  With a timid squeak, Dean crawled to the edge of the door.  His eyes never left Castiel, studying him for signs of danger.  Noting Dean's small show of trust, Castiel slid to the floor and sat cross-legged.  He rested his hands on his knees and voiced soothing sounds, encouraging Dean it was safe to approach.
“Yes, my pet?”  Castiel's recently clean fingers played in the bowl like a pallet of finger-paint.
The computer screen blinked and turned black as he shrugged on his coat.  His watch read nearly 12:30AM.  Castiel walked with purpose through the nearly empty street toward his apartment complex, headphones still snuggly fit to his ears.  He was able to effectively block out most thoughts of the weekend until he neared his block.  The familiar smells of greasy bar food and cigarette smoke were enough to stir up the burning ache in his chest that he had been trying so hard to suppress.  Even his stomach betrayed him as it sounded a loud protest at going home without his Friday-night burger.  His nose led him the rest of the way as he shoved his phone and headphones into the pocket of his coat.
Catching his breath, Dean apologized again and closed his eyes.  They had become dry and scratchy, trying to watch Castiel's reactions all evening.  He rubbed at them with the heel of his hand and curled onto his side.
On the porch, Castiel sat with his head in his hands.
“K,” Dean said simply, firm in his resolve to help his friend.
“Oh, I, uh, don’t think that would be wise.”  It was Castiel’s turn to blush and he did so with gusto.  Color spread from his cheeks and he hid his face in his hands.
“I don't know.  He's been kinda

“Yes, but how-”  Castiel guessed Michael's next sentence before it was spoken.
Only a few hours ago, Castiel had practically told Dean that he was falling for him and the entire time, Dean probably thought it was a lie.  After the way Castiel had emphasized the place of honesty in their relationship, Castiel could start to see Dean's perspective and the pieces of the day began to fall into place.  “You shouldn't have done that.”
Dean gave his best bitch-face, as if to say
“Yeah, maybe,” Dean said unfolding the waxed paper to free his own hero.  “But I've done so well so far with just insults and a wink.”  He tucked into his lunch with gusto, opening his mouth wide to accommodate the tall stack of meats and cheeses.
“Wait!  You never told me if you went through with it.  Did you really quit that bar-tending gig?”  Sam thought that Dean depended on the tips he earned at the bar to help pay his bills.  He had no idea of his work as an on-stage submissive.
Castiel continued to stare at the ceiling wondering what he would see should his gaze move toward the window.  Perhaps he would see a child and his heart would break for the loss of such a young life.  Or maybe it would be a wrinkled crone of a woman, mourning her lover’s death and forgetting her own.  His heart pounded in his throat with anticipation and he closed his eyes to reduce the temptation to look before he was ready to accept what was before him.
“Not tonight.”  Dean wanted to stop talking all together.  He wanted to roll over and pull Castiel on top of him.  To crush their mouths together and forget to breathe.  Instead, he let his limbs go limp and allowed Castiel to assemble them at his will.
Dean talked about the fun he had helping out at Ambrosia and how he was thinking of accepting Kali's offer to work there part-time.
In the kitchen, Dean fumbled with the coffee filter and can of breakfast blend.  He was never much of a snob when it came to a simple cup-of-joe, but all of the sudden it seemed important to measure how many spoons of coffee grinds for how many cups of water.  He smiled to himself, aware of how ridiculous he was being.
Cas knew Dean wanted to revise the contract and agreed to look it over during downtime, because yes they had not made it half-way through the month, but even Castiel would have liked the freedom to worship Dean's body in whatever way he chose.
Castiel sat beside him with a bowl and a spoon.  Wisps of steam carried the scent of apples in the air.  Dean's stomach growled in response.
Cas looked up to find Dean smiling at him and his heart throbbed, feeling much too big for the space it was given.
Kali gestured for Gabriel to jump in, but he remained silent and pouting.
Subject: Re: Apologies
For Dean, the gesture felt better suited for a mother and child.  He pulled away from the touch.
Garth let him ramble until he stopped on his own.  “Sounds like Castiel is really working hard.  How are his moods?”
Dean's own apologies came quickly even as Castiel assured him that it wasn't his fault.  Dean blamed his own inexperience for their struggle and tried to argue that it
There was no way that Dean was going to let himself interrupt Sam's schoolwork because he freaked out and quit his more lucrative job.  Besides, things were going well at the garage and with Castiel.  It wasn't like Sam sleeping on his couch and eating all his food was going to help the situation any.  And if Sam was over, then the thing with Castiel might have to end, or at least be put on the shelf a while.  None of it appealed to Dean and he insisted Sam stay put in California.
Starting from Dean's fingers, Castiel swept his hands over his body.  They dragged along his sides and down his legs, as Castiel praised him for the pose.  “What beautiful lines,” he cooed.  “Just like that.”  His fingers wrapped around Dean's ankles.
Castiel observed the differences in those familiar eyes.  Up close, Castiel could see his face was red and raw from tears, not just flushed with the heat of the room or his suit.  The security guard pushed harder until Castiel’s feet began to move again.  Without breaking eye contact, Castiel mouthed one last plea, “Safe-word.”
At first, he was just himself preparing props for the scene.  It was mindless work, tearing holes in the fabric until he started to get into character.
Sam gagged, “TMI, dude.  I get it.  He’s dehydrated.”  He adjusted his grip on his brother, though it didn’t seem to help much.  Dean was clearly favoring Castiel’s support over his.  “We’ve got some sports drinks in the trunk.  He’ll be fine once we get him home.”
“Thought Kali was superstitious about that kind of stuff,” Dean raised an eyebrow.
Dean looked between them, feeling like this whole thing was a set up.
“Hey, Babe.”  Dean had his hands above his head, toweling off his hair as he answered the door.
Dean watched Castiel’s lips to keep himself from looking into his eyes.  “What was that for?”
“I’m so proud of you,” Dean said as he untangled the trailing ends of the braid.  Dean laid his design vertically on the bed next to Castiel and separated the 12 lines – 6 coming out of the top and 6 from the bottom.  He would bind Castiel with the piece, creating a second spine of woven silk and nylon.
“You look awesome, but mostly gross.”  Dean gathered him into a bear hug and complained at the smell of his makeup.
Cas turned his hand and admired the slip of aluminum.  He laughed as it caught the light from the kitchen.  “Gabriel is an idiot.”
With a sigh of relief, Castiel inhaled his coffee.  “Thank you, Dean.  Very good boy.”
“Yes, sir,” he answered mechanically, but Dean didn't think that kitty would hide after destroying the sneakers.  Had he ruined his Master's shoes out of separation anxiety or anger, to teach him a lesson: don't leave me alone.  Dean thought that either way, kitty would not hide.  He'd either sit by his destruction with smug satisfaction, or be found still nervously tearing the laces.  Dean didn't argue with Castiel this time and wracked his brain for a way that he could reconcile his understanding of kitty's actions with Castiel's command.
Dean gave his winningest smile before heading to the kitchen.
Castiel's eyes shone as he added a pinch to the corresponding nerve on the other side of Dean's neck.  He blinked back tears as Dean curled in on himself.  “You will address me as Castiel or Sir.  Is that understood?”
By the time Castiel was counting down from ten, Dean was shaking.  His muscles spasmed from being held in sustained tension and his knees buckled.
Castiel had kept his head down, for the most part, gently smiling at the foot traffic, his heart doing little flip-flops as strangers approached his display.  A few people took his jars in their hands, commented on the label’s mascot, informing him that bees do not have feathered wings as if he was somehow clueless to this fact.  He did his best not to roll his eyes, instead sharing with them a good-natured nod and running a mantra-like prayer in his head for them to leave quickly.
“That is inaccurate.”  Cas entered from the back, tugging on the hem of his shirt.  Bobby had kindly washed his clothes of the night before.  “You had fainted on the dance floor.  I took care of you until Sam found us.”
Dean cleared his throat and mind, “So... I thought, tonight, no alcohol.  I got one of your favorite dinners from a restaurant I know you like.  Dinner music is your choice.  And we can do an activity of your choice.”  He placed his hands on Castiel's shoulders to help satisfy the urge to pull him in closer.  “I was going to say movie, but I'm getting the idea that you don't really watch much television.  So, if you want to read, talk, play charades... just name it.  This night is completely yours.  I am happy to accommodate you however I can.”
He hadn't brought anyone to meet his family before -  not even Markus, especially not Markus.  To see Gabriel hit it off so easily with his boyfriend had been breathtaking.  Of course Castiel trusted that his brother would be considerate of his choice, but he delighted in the way Gabriel seemed genuinely impressed.  Expecting jokes and an invasive line of questioning, Castiel had braced himself for all kinds of embarrassment before bringing Dean into the shop.  Instead, something had happened between the men when they talked alone.  Some kind of understanding or mutual respect had blossomed in their short conversation.  Castiel didn't ask.  What was said between Dean and Gabriel, he did not need to know.
As he rounded the shoulder and travelled to Dean's chest, Castiel adored the wide expanse of muscle.
“If you can't stay quiet I'm going to have to find another thing to do with that mouth.”  His mouth turned up in one corner, “Do you need help being quiet?”
before.  It’s just that, one day, maybe, if we ever get to that point… I thought I would be the one presenting you with a little box.”
Cas licked his lips, already missing the pressure of Dean's mouth.  He blinked up at Dean, “Why do you ask?”
But there was a hardness in Dean that prevented him from acting out, that didn't want Castiel to see him lose his shit.  Not like that.
Castiel's brow gathered in a deep scowl, his eyes still adjusting to the light.  As he laid eyes on the man before him, Castiel thought he had to be dreaming.  He squeezed his eyes closed and cleared his mind of its clouds, but when he opened them again Dean was still there, bouncing on the balls of his feet and dressed in the most ridiculous get up.
Dean looked down at Castiel.  The full lips glistened with their saliva, inviting him in for another kiss, and Dean found that he couldn't resist.  When he moved to bring his hands up to Castiel's hair, Dean was met with resistance.
The entrance to the club was moderately lit and clean.  At his first visit, Castiel was pleasantly surprised to find that the club did not give off the seedy, grimy vibe he'd experienced at other establishments.  The walls were white with hardwood floors and potted plants adorned the hallway.  There were four visible doors (one on the left and three to the right).  Castiel had never been in the smaller rooms, choosing to spend his time at the main stage.  A private man, such as himself, should probably feel more comfortable having more intimate meetings.  However, Castiel found that he preferred to lose himself in the small crowd of club members.  He walked through the hallway to the solitary door on the left, opening it without hesitation.
“How's the night treating you?”  The man reached over the counter as he spoke, helping himself to a bottle of beer.
Dean slipped his arms around Castiel's waist from behind.  “When's the last time you saw him?”  Castiel breathed a sigh and turned in the embrace.
Castiel couldn't finish his sentence.  Speaking took too much time away from mouthing at Dean's neck.  And Castiel couldn’t afford to waste any more.
Still there was no answer.
“Please…”  Castiel’s hum and turned to a whimper.
Dean launched himself over a rotted trunk and took the time to get a good look.  The zombie approached quickly and, as it closed the distance, Dean could see the guy was huge.
He saw only one set of plates and silverware as he walked around the peninsula to his chair. “Will you be joining me?”  Castiel nodded toward the cushion that had been propped against the stool.
Dean learned that Castiel ran about three miles before work to get his day started.  Then, on months working up to an event, he trained a little differently, going to the park to strengthen his arms and core.
“I already switched the detergent to the baby stuff. It’s down in the laundry room.” Gabriel offered as he worked alongside Dean. Dean really appreciated the extra set of hands.
Castiel reached out slowly to cradle Dean's head in his palm.  “We have much to discuss.  I thought you would like to eat first, but maybe I was wrong.”
“Does this make you uncomfortable?”
Through the week he took pictures of the insects he felt he knew by personality and had fun coming up with their names.  He wrote an article about the baby bees who had recently stolen his heart.  It was cutesy, but actually pretty informative about the nature of beekeeping and what it took to run a healthy colony.
“Hello.”  He started, his voice squawked like a pubescent child.  How long had it been since anyone called? Since he’d spoken aloud?  Shaking his head to rid himself of pitying thoughts, Castiel cleared his throat and tried again.  "I do not wish to be an imposition, so I will only interrupt briefly.” He felt so silly.  But it already felt rude to have intruded on this home – on purpose, no less - and he really wanted to continue in harmony with the others.  "I would like to open up the windows a bit, let the sun in.  May I?”
Castiel pet the side of Dean's face and rubbed his knuckles beneath his chin.  “Good kitty.”
The closer they came to dessert, the antsier Gabriel became.  He couldn’t keep his eyes off Dean’s pocket nor keep the smile off his face.
Castiel had been watching him from the bar.  His breath had caught in his throat each time the guy had surged closer.  His heart fell every step he had backtracked, swallowed up by the crowd.  The young man had been like a leaf on wave, coming in and going out, but never quite reaching the shore.
He caught up to Dean easily, his friend fumbling through his pockets at the end of the line.
Dean's expression softened and he pulled Cas's legs onto his lap.  “I ain't mad at you, Cas.”  He rubbed the chill from his boyfriend's feet.  “Not for a minute.”
In the bathroom, Dean found his dirty clothes in a pile near the sink.  He fished his phone out of his jeans and without hesitation thumbed a text to Sam.
Castiel shook his head, but sputtered out a few words despite himself.  “An audit.  It’s too much.”
Dean gasped and his hips thrust up to meet Castiel.  Castiel's weight pressed him back into sofa and drew out another moan.  He rolled his hips, his erection straining against his boxer briefs.  Rubbing along Castiel's own hardness provided little relief to the ache of Dean's arousal.
“Tell me you understand.”
got him pissed.
Dean shook his head and dipped his hands in the flour to help.  “He’s overworked and overtired.  But it’s almost over, I think.”
“Well, no.  OK.  I got off work at quarter-after seven, because Garth is a butterfingers and I had to fix his mess.  And then I called my good friends at Pizza Rustica and asked them what you liked to order.  Then I bought it and asked them the best way to keep it warm.  So now it's in the oven, waiting to be devoured by my wonderful, gorgeous, you.”
Castiel pressed a chaste kiss to Dean's forehead and adjusted the pillows behind his back so he was seated upright.  Dean's head found a familiar, natural position in Cas's lap.
Dean wished Sam had said this in front of Cas so he wouldn’t have to bring it up on his own.  Sam had this uncanny ability to drop ideas in a person’s mind and then change subject. It left his victim with a seed of doubt, curiosity, whatever, that grew even while the person was distracted by his next thought.  It was one of the reasons why Sam would make a great lawyer.  The more Dean thought about his vacant apartment across town, the more ludicrous it seemed.
His hand grabbed at the first book it landed on and he opened it to the middle with a huff.  The sound and feel of it's spine cracking was satisfying.
Cas nodded at him before heading to the back of the shop.  “You have 5 minutes, Gabriel.”
Dean nuzzled against Castiel's thigh and looped an arm around his calf, finally satisfying his desire for physical contact.  It wasn't quite the embrace he would have asked for, locking arms around Castiel's shoulder and burying his face into his neck, but it was what Castiel could give and it was enough.
He pulled the car into the driveway and cut the engine.  Their uncle’s house was kind of in the middle of nowhere and Castiel began to wonder how he was supposed to get home.  Even if they could get Dean stabilized and into bed, Castiel couldn’t, in good conscience, let Sam drive under the influence.
It could have been an invitation for affection, but Dean didn't want to read too much into it.  Castiel had always been upfront about what he wanted and expected.  So although Dean's arms ached with the urge to pull Castiel closer, he waited for direction.  The last thing he wanted to do was to make Cas uncomfortable.  It was best that he feel safe in his home, in Dean's company.
Bobby slapped a frozen bag of peas against Dean’s neck and shook him until he was conscious and blinking about the room as if waking from a dream.  “You take any drugs, son?”
Dean was so worked up after his shower that he wanted to yell at Cas:
Thursday came and went and Dean didn't even blink at the thought of losing Zachariah's money.  He had the garage and a prospective job at Ambrosia.  It would work out.
The room fell silent for a while and Dean was almost pleased with himself for having such power over them in his weakened state.
After sitting with Dean through an early dinner, Castiel placed the journal on his bookshelf.  He tucked it next to the thick books of lore and never referenced it again.  It seemed Dean had trusted him with it, not presented it for destruction.
“Anji, say ‘hi’ to Uncle Cassie.” Kali moved the baby’s hand in a tiny wave, just brushing against Castiel’s fingers. Anji stretched and wrapped her tiny fingers around Castiel’s pinky. Once she had him in her grasp, she held on as tight as she could.
Castiel placed his hand over Dean's at his shoulder, holding it there.
Dean wasn't stupid, he knew Castiel wouldn't want his pet to break the fantasy by using his hands and fingers, but it was difficult to bend himself enough to eat from the bowl.  As it was, on the floor, Dean needed to double over his knees with his ass in the air.  And even then, his weight rested heavily on his hands as he brought his mouth to the shredded mix of meat and vegetables.  The position brought the blood rushing to his head and made him giddy.
“What do you want?”  Castiel’s question came like a growl through clenched teeth.  He didn’t want to waste time with some jerk-off.  His new friend needed care and Castiel considered that it was about time he called that ambulance.  The guy could have suffered a concussion from his fall or God-knows what from whatever drugs and alcohol he took that evening.
Dean tapped Cas on the head to get his attention, but Castiel’s focus was elsewhere.  “He’s here, Gabe.”  Dean bit on his lip and breathed heavily through his nose.  “’Sup?”
Castiel's mouth against his shoulder felt nice, great even, but it was a distraction and Dean hated for the pancakes to burn.  Dean shimmied him off, playfully asking, “Me or breakfast?”
“Goodnight, Michael.”  Castiel hung up the phone and tried the doorknob.
But Dean surprised him with his next question, “What else did you want to see?”  His voice was hushed in Cas’s ear, like he understood what lie between them was delicate.
Dean held his gaze and gave a small shake of head.  His mouth curled in a gentle smile and he kissed Castiel's wrist, which happened to be the closest bit of exposed skin within reach.  “It's OK.  I'm OK.”
“Well, I was wondering,” Dean scuffed his toe against the gravel, stuffing his hands in his pockets.  “Maybe you could find a bee-bee sitter and come out with me?”
The dining room table was covered in loose papers – thank god Castiel had the forethought to label and number them.  They had been at revisions for hours, but it didn’t seem that long.  Castiel squinted over every line and hummed happily as he toiled away.  Dean tapped his red pen against his chin as he outlined his hard limits.  Lifting his eyes from their work, Dean could see that Castiel was having fun.  His eyes had a spark in them as he compared their notes with the outline. The corner of his mouth twitched upward when he discovered a better way to phrase an article.
No missed calls.  No messages.
Later that night, Dean sat with Castiel on the couch to negotiate the contract.  Dean agreed with mostly everything, pouting only a little at the exclusion of his own exploration into the role of the Dominant.  Castiel assured him that if the trial month went well, there was no reason why they shouldn't negotiate a new contract for a longer period of time.  Dean smiled at that.  He hadn't committed himself to a serious relationship in a while and he liked hearing that Castiel was already thinking about staying together beyond the one month trial.
Despite Dean’s numerous attempts to break through to Cas, he was silent the whole ride home.  Dean drove his usual route – the longer route, the one that avoided Bar A – and found parking in front of Ambrosia.  His eyes lingered on the dark storefront.
Dean's question came across as innocent enough and Castiel had no problem speaking about his past relationships.  “I have been in three d/s relationships.  The first only lasted a few weeks and mostly served as a learning experience for both of us.  That was the first and only time I scened as a submissive.”  Castiel shook his head, “I took a break from the BDSM community for a while.  Tried dating vanilla guys and girls, but I couldn't make it work.  That was when I believe my Dominance became fetish.  My next d/s relationship lasted several months but ended mutually when she left the state for school.  We kept in touch for a short while, but both moved on rather quickly.”  Castiel took a break for food and drink.  “Any questions so far?”
“Morning.”  Castiel shuffled into the bathroom only half-awake.  He looked freshly fucked for a walk of shame.  Dean blinked to keep from staring and slipped out of the bathroom.
“Stop.  What does that even... No, I don't wanna know.”
It was easy in the winter, to live in perpetual night, but with spring fast approaching Castiel found himself getting restless. He longed for the sweet scent of spring and the warm breeze.  But before he did anything, he decided to consult his roommate(s).  He wasn’t sure how many spirits shared his home, but it felt like a few.  No matter where he was in the house, there was always a cool presence beside him.
“He did seem to take on a strange urgency for our runs.  I suppose this was part of it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, what happens now? Do we finish the race?”
Dean accepted the strip of fabric and circled it once around Castiel’s elbow.  He created a criss-cross pattern down his partner’s arm and over his wrist.  The knots were simple, but tighter than Dean had used on Cas before.  When he was done, Dean held the arm securely in his hands and checked in with Cas.  “Let’s go inside now.”
Dean smiled.  “And how you came right over after work.”
With another blush, Castiel brought their mouths together gently.  He reached up to cradle Dean's face and placed slow kisses to his nose and forehead.  “I'll take care of you,” he whispered into Dean's hair, holding him tightly around the middle.  “You just need to talk to me.”
Dean smiled as if it was all he could do to refrain from leaning in and kissing Castiel.  His heart thumped in his chest, anticipating the first touch of his lips against his own.  Instead of a kiss, Castiel dragged his thumb across Dean's lips again.  The touch was both slower and more rough than the first time.  Dean's eyes grew dark as his mind filled with dirty images.  With a mischievous grin, Dean winked at Castiel.  His teeth chomped the air, in mock threat to Castiel's fingers as they made another pass over his mouth.
“As in business?”
Dean had been lying awake for a while, enjoying the weight of Castiel as he slept.  He tried not to think about much as his hands traced lazy lines over Castiel's shirt, starting at his spine and trailing out over his shoulders and arms.  The image of wings still fresh from the night before, Dean fancied that he'd caught himself something more precious than a dragon.
Trust
Gabriel was quiet after that and helped Dean chop root vegetables for roasting while he dressed the pasta in three ways and smashed the potatoes.  Dean had just whipped the potatoes into fluffy peaks when Kali waddled in, one hand atop her belly, the other rubbing her lower back.
Like this was just another day.
They ate dinner in an uneasy silence; Dean opted to sit at the counter with Cas and feed himself.  Then the pair settled on the couch where the silence continued.
“I don't like alcohol.”  Castiel made a face like a child refusing broccoli.
Castiel held an odd attraction for Sunday food markets.  The open air markets of stands and tents were a flurry of activity and noise, which typically he would avoid during the mid-day rush.  But he had been there since early morning, setting up his first table of jars.  His hand-painted, wooden signs propped against the tent poles, advertised his newest stock of jams and honeys.
He tried again, “Are you there?”
Castiel was happy to provide Dean some relief and massaged his scalp and neck until his fingers were sore and Dean had fallen back to sleep.
Castiel's movements in the kitchen were far from quiet and the smell of garlic hung heavy in the apartment.  Dean ventured to the breakfast counter to see if there was something he could do to help, to keep busy.
“You!” He pointed at Dean, “start boiling water.  Castiel,” he held out a vegetable peeler, “get to work on those potatoes.”
Benny looked excited to see Dean and wrapped him up in a strong embrace.  Dean started with small-talk and transitioned to ask how work was going.  Benny let him know that things were mostly the same.  Alistair was still on the look out for more male submissives, but business on the whole was good.  Dean tried to be casual as he asked about his regulars, the men and women who paid extra for private sessions.  Had anyone been interested in him? Was he missed?  Benny knew he wasn't asking out of concern for their patrons and admitted that there were a few that requested to schedule a private session with Dean.  He described the people he remembered;  Dean didn't know their names and Benny wasn't supposed to supply them.
Dean was still standing beside the table, lost in his thoughts.  He shook his head to focus.  “I ordered it as take out, before I heard back from you.”
Castiel grunted and grabbed the plates from the drying rack.  He set their places across from each other and watched Dean flip the last of the pancakes.  “Did you sleep well?”
“All right, Cas?”
something.”  Castiel snapped at Dean and he didn't meant to.  But he sure as hell doesn't want to apologize.  The words came to his lips automatically and Dean flinched at their tone, “I'm sorry.”
He glanced toward the couch and was surprised to find the living room occupied, a book resting on Castiel's lap.
Dean wrapped his arms around himself, scratching an imaginary itch on his shoulder.  “I thought this was... I mean, you look...”  Dean sighed, “and you smell so good.”  Dean snapped his jaw shut as his face flushed in embarrassment.  He didn't mean to admit that out loud.  He wasn't demonstrating what a good submissive would.  He shouldn't have pulled Castiel toward him.  He should have thanked him for noticing he had cleaned.
As Gabriel passed furniture and baby essentials down to his brother, Castiel accepted the items greedily. He scurried back and forth from the hallway to the nursery, making piles of items that seemed to belong together. There were a few unmarked boxes that Castiel wasn’t sure where to place, so he left them off to the side. By the time the attic was cleared and the nursery was nearly full, the three of them were yawning and rubbing their eyes.
Dean offered the key to his own apartment instead, but Sam laughed.
Dean helped him create a new menu and was careful about how he voiced his concerns.  After Castiel’s birthday-not-proposal things between them had been awkward.  After a particularly bad morning at home, Dean had blown up at Gabriel and said some things he probably shouldn’t have.  Since then, they didn’t joke as often, tried to limit the sarcasm, and rarely spoke about Dean’s relationship with Castiel.  Of course Gabriel asked how his little brother was doing and invited them over to visit the baby, but other than that things were oddly professional.
The sound of his name spoken so softly from Dean's lips sparked his arousal, which settled heavily along his thigh.  It felt like all his blood abandoned his brain, leaving him lightheaded and dizzy.  Castiel didn't say anything for what felt like a long time and his silence started to make Dean uncomfortable.   Dean let go of the jacket, misreading Castiel's silence for disapproval.  His stomach twisted with confusion and anxiety.
“Sure, of course.  Newsletters every Friday.” Castiel feels the nagging urge to smack himself on the head.  What the heck is he talking about?  Mailing lists? Newsletters?
“No.”  Dean shook his head slowly.  “You come later.”  With another deep breath, Dean continued.  “The trainer tricked him, brought him to a circus.  And every day he was allowed out of his cage, but only to be humiliated.  A tiger was supposed be grow big and strong, you know?  A fierce hunter.  But the trainer did something to him.  Kept him small, weak.  He was scared when the circus got shut down.  It was a good thing, probably.  The circus had been cruel and not only to him.  But it was the only home he ever knew.”  Castiel rubbed Dean's hand between his own, watching the lines of his face reflect the desperation of his voice.  “He wandered the strange city alone, abandoned.  Performed petty tricks for scraps of food and a place to sleep... until one night he was found by another man.  The man lifted him off the cold cement and sheltered him in the warmth of his trench coat.  The man asked permission, discovered what he liked, and gave him what he needed.”  The words hung in the air until Castiel brought their hands to his lips, kissing along the knobs of Dean's knuckles.
Cas had said he was up for a walk, not a mile run.
“Right.”
There would be a music festival at the end of the month.  It wasn’t the typical dance music that his friends liked to listen to, so he felt discouraged even before asking them if they’d want to join in.  He wasn’t sure why he would hesitate.   He’d followed them to more than a few festivals that were not his normal speed, gotten himself into some mighty awkward situations with strangers and DJs who he’d rather have never encountered.  Surely his friends wouldn’t turn down the invitation.
Castiel used three fingers as he tried to fish out a gooey, sloppy wedge of apple.  “This will be rather untidy,” Castiel mused with a hint of laughter.
Dean plucked at the knots to loosen them before reaching for the braid at Cas’s neck.  “Going in to work early,” he said, voice tinged with regret, “But I’ll be back this afternoon. Want me to pick you up or meet you at Gabriel’s?”
“Late,” Castiel stated. “Or very early.”
“How the hell did you get so fast?”  Dean asked his brother, cleaning leaves and dirt from his clothes.
Castiel felt his sub's arms slip through his fingers.  He leaned forward in an effort to prolong the touch even as the man pulled away.  The gesture was met with a rough tug on Castiel's shoulder, a firm reminder to keep his hands to himself.  Shrugging off the guard's grip, Castiel watched as his sub continued to retreat, disappearing behind a corner.
Chasing Castiel down the hall, Meg noticed him making dreamy eyes at Dean.  “Looks like you did damn well for yourself there, Clarence.”  Meg laughed as she nudged Castiel into the lobby.  “Go get him, hot stuff.”
“Cassie!”  Gabriel's voice was nothing like Dean would imagine of a Novak.  It was bright and jovial, higher in pitch than Castiel's.  As he spoke, he seemed in a constant state of delight.  Such a contrast to the dark, serious tone to which Dean had become accustomed.  “Kali had a feeling you might stop by this weekend.”  He outstretched his hand to Dean, greeting him while still embracing Castiel.  “And you are?”
Castiel nodded in response and turned his attention back to his basket of fries.  He forced himself not to watch as Dean left.  If he had allowed himself a glance, he would have seen Dean linger in the doorway for another look back at Castiel.
“Castiel?”  Dean used his full name knowing it was acceptable even as a sub addressing his Dom, though he seriously doubted he would incur punishment tonight.
With a raise of his own eyebrow, Castiel admonished, “In regard to the contract, please.”
“What?”
When Castiel rose in the early afternoon, he went straight to the mirror.  He could feel a pleasant ache in his muscles and thought that maybe there would be some evidence of their play left on his skin, a mark, a bruise, or a rash.  There was none.  His hands roamed his body as he turned in front of the mirror.  They pressed into the tenderest flesh and Castiel mourned the loss of his marks.  The marks had been a claim on him, he had been gifted a physical reminder that Dean had chosen him.  It didn’t feel right to be without them.
Castiel came back, as promised, five minutes later with Kali in tow.  But Dean didn't need saving.  He held up his hand, signaling the need for another five minutes.  Kali and Cas shared an amused look before busying themselves with the glass cases.  Waiting for the men to finish their member's only meeting, they rotated the cookies and made up boxes of what would go stale if left out another day.
“Child labor,”  Dean suggested as Cas worried they'd have to hire less-than-qualified ranch hands to help tend the crops and livestock.  “We can put the kids to work.  They're cheap and, if they wanna eat, they'll do as their told.”
“So, if I wanted to, erm, take initiative on some things...” Dean twisted his napkin in his hands, no longer hungry.  “You would be OK with that?”  He looked up, eyes full of hope and uncertainty.
In the kitchen, Castiel placed the pie on the stove top to cool.  He tossed the ball of aluminum into the trash.  He had meant for Dean to smell the pie as it was baking, but he hadn't counted on Dean's nose being out of commission.  “Trying to guess what I baked?”  Castiel approached Dean from behind the couch.
“Dean?” He hoped Dean could come around and tell him what was wrong,
The fog shifted and Dean could see the scene more clearly.  It was the main theatre of Alistair's club and the house was packed.  Dean knelt centerstage as Alistair and Michael circled him like vultures too long without a meal.  Panic set in.  This wasn't right.  He shouldn't be here.
They made a full lap of the block without much more than a “Wait up” between them.  The second lap, Castiel increased his pace and Dean wished he had thought to bring his headphones.
“Rock 'n' roll is an essential part of my thought process,”  Dean insisted.
Dean thanked him with a small kiss, grateful when he didn't shy away from the public display of affection.  Close to his ear, he whispered, “Is this a Dominance thing?”  Dean quirked up an eyebrow, only half joking.
Dean rubbed his back and told Castiel it was taken care of, that they could try again in the morning. “Rest a bit. Before you know it, you’ll be holding your little niece or nephew. Then we can call Michael together.”
When Castiel's hands forced him against the door with a shove, Dean thought it may work even better.
Twice during his shift Dean sneaked over to the lockers and checked his phone.  Sam had called again so Dean sent him a quick text letting him know things were good and that he was busy with work.  He begged Sam to relax and focus on his studies, insisted that he was back to his old self and doing well.  Sam actually apologized and promised to lay off.  Each time his phone binged, Dean hoped for something from Cas.  He couldn't get a kiss after lunch, but Dean felt like he would settle for a kiss-face emoji at this point and was bummed that Cas wouldn't even give him that.
He felt Dean's cold hand graze his arm as they walked.  Being with Dean was different than what Cas had had before.  Dean didn't blindly follow Castiel's demands and he didn't cover up his feelings.  As far as Cas could see, Dean wore his heart on his sleeve.  Dean openly admitted that he didn't like how he was being treated, giving Castiel an opportunity to make it better for both of them.
“This OK?”  Dean whispered before flicking his tongue along the edge of Cas’s ear.
It wasn't a question but Dean answered all the same.  “Yes, sir. Please, sir.”  Dean wanted to squirm, to feel a brush of cotton against his now prominent erection.  He resisted temptation, but only just.  In an effort to remain still, Dean clenched his jaw and locked his knees.
Since receiving Dean’s text that morning Castiel was feeling pretty good.  He didn’t think that he was acting in a way that would suggest upset, but around mid-day Meg came over with a different perception.
Gabriel pulled back and wiped his face on his sleeve. “Come in, come in.” He gestured to the door of the delivery room and led them inside. “Kali wants to show off her miracle.”
With a devious grin, Dean decided to answer the phone.  “Yes?”  Dean kept his hand over the microphone as he struggled to catch his breath.
Dean snorted.  It had felt like a long time since there was any knot tying going on between him and Cas.  “Yeah, Gabe.  We’re ready to tie the knot alright.  Hangman’s noose.”
After finishing at the garage, Dean headed home to shower and pack some clothes and sneakers for the rest of the week.  He dropped off the rent to his landlord, ignoring her probing questions about his recent company.
“Why?  Is something wrong?  You want to talk about it?”  Garth pulled himself out from the hood and leaned on the truck’s bumper.
Subject: (No Subject)
They were taking their dessert in the living room when Dean reached into his pocked and pulled out a small package.
“She is not gooey,” Castiel stated as he continued to caress her arm.
Castiel dropped his voice as well.  “You didn’t say anything.”  He thought that if she had known about the sex club she would have mentioned it earlier, or at least cracked a joke at his expense.
“Yes, sir.  I believe that virgins are to be cherished, not eaten.”
Dean smiled at Cas’s response, feeling encouraged that the guy seemed in no rush to leave the car.  “That new Avengers movie came out.”  His hands gripped the steering wheel more tightly, to keep from shaking in his nervousness.  “I heard it’s good.  You wanna see it?”
the smell of cinnamon and apples lingered in the rooms for hours.  He could close his eyes and image a pie baking in the oven.  Dean loved pie, but he found it impossible to master.  After dozens of frustrating, soggy, burnt, rubbery, sour attempts, Dean had finally given up trying.
Castiel dragged his hands over his eyes and turned the faucet on cold.  Filling the sink, he brought handfuls of water to his face.  After a few minutes he was feeling more like himself.  He dried his face before finishing up and heading out of the bathroom.
The thought surprised and stung.  Dean wondered where it came from, wondered why he was consumed by such bitterness.
Grateful for Dean's hesitation, Castiel gathered him in his arms.  With a sigh of relief, Cas tucked his face to Dean's neck and breathed him in.  “Thank you.”  Castiel caressed the back of Dean's neck and held them together another moment. “Lunch with you was... a welcome surprise.”
Dean brushed his fingers over Castiel’s cheek, wiping away the look of indecision.  “You think Gabe and Kali would mind him tagging along?”
Dean dropped his gaze to the floor and felt heat rise under his collar.  He couldn’t keep track of how many times he had broken some of Castiel’s most basic rules.  Castiel had been right to bring their attention back to the contract.  If they were to play like this, their expectations for each other needed to be laid out with clarity.  Their contract needed to be up-to-date and thorough.  Dean didn’t think either of them knew what merited praise or punishment any longer and so he took the opportunity to speak candidly.
“So you still have your own apartment?”
Returning to his seat, Castiel reached a hand out to rest on Dean's head.  A soft purr rose from Dean's throat as he nuzzled into Castiel's touch.  Castiel chuckled.
Castiel removed his hands from Dean's shoulders and the two entered a stand-off:  Dean refusing to play by the rules and Castiel too hesitant to offer punishment or comfort.
Sam accepted the hand and got himself to his feet.  “Good to see you, Cas.  Can’t believe you got him off the couch and into sneakers.”
Dean came home from work with a chip on his shoulder.  Saturdays at the garage were usually hectic, but today it wasn't just customers or faulty replacement parts that got under his skin.  Nudging the door closed with the toe of his boot, Dean let out a frustrated sound.
Castiel stood from the counter abruptly and every muscle in Dean's body tensed.  Everything had been going so well.  They had agreed upon and signed the contact the night before.  Dean was a good submissive all night, curled up at Castiel's feet while they watched TV.  Castiel accepted and played along with Dean's improvised kitten play just this morning.  They were complimenting each other already, working together better than either of them would have thought possible.  Of course Dean knew he would be the one to screw it up.
“It's OK, Dean.  Talk to me.”
Dean shook his head, “He wouldn't run away.”  His mouth twisted while he thought; Castiel could see the gears turning.  “Maybe he's been living with you this whole time.  Getting used to having someone look out for him.  Maybe he acts out because you had to stay late at work and he was scared you weren't coming back or something.”
Castiel sat stiffly on the couch with his hands folded in his lap.  The skin under his eyes looked darker than before.  He blinked up at Dean, “Sorry, what?”
Hope it's OK. to call you Cas. I don't know how you spell your full name.
He stopped breathing at his release. Come pooled in and around his belly button as his body trembled. “Come for me,” he said quietly, his body still working through the aftershocks of his orgasm. Then, louder. “Come for me, Dean.”
“What faces?”
“Cas won’t leave the office until six,” Dean explained, “but still he bitches about taking a ‘half-day’.”
“Dean!  Cut it out.  I really am calling to see if you're alright.  You said you'd call.”
The bible tight in his hands, Dean rushed upstairs to deposit the money.  He figured it'd do well to sit on the shelf above his bed and tucked it in between The Lord of the Rings and Dune.  His phone alerted him to another text as Dean stepped back to see if the book looked out of place.  He smirked at the thought of adding a holy text to his collection of science fiction, but actually laughed out loud when he saw that on the shelf directly below the hollow bible was L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics.  Still a laugh on his lips, Dean saw a text from Zachariah.  He wished to schedule another session next Thursday, same time same place.  Dean agreed to it and got himself ready for his shift at the garage.  He took a moment to straighten up the living room quickly in preparation for Castiel's visit and then headed to work.
A/N:  Can't believe it is already December!  I apologize for my hiatus.  There were some personal issues that needed attention and it kept me busier than I anticipated.
Castiel felt terrible knowing that Dean was still waiting in the car.  The meeting had run over an hour long, made even worse by Mr. Milton’s shameless flirtations.  When the focus is on work, the talk is mostly legal jargon that Castiel can’t follow, but the few phrases he does understand leave a hollow feeling in his stomach.
Finally, Castiel felt Dean step toward him.  His energy made contact with the flame and Castiel’s hand jumped before it was able to grab hold.  The flame drew life from Castiel, searing his hand to Dean like a brand.  For a moment, Dean’s form flickered.  Like an old reel of film, his image blinked in and out.  Dean looked younger than Castiel had thought.  Ruggedly handsome with his crooked smile.  Castiel stared on in wonder, willing the curse to take hold, eager for his image to stick.
Castiel’s answer was a simple, yet forceful, “Yes.”  This wasn’t the time for debate, not with Dean half-delirious and stinking like burnt motor oil.  “Did you eat?”
Castiel nodded, “What would you like to include?”
I'm seeing someone.  Not sure how serious it is, but... Yeah.  Whatever.
Castiel held him closer and listened quietly as Dean talked about his favorite types of restraints.  Instead of categorizing Dean's preferences and trying to read between the lines as he spoke, Castiel allowed himself to relax into their easy conversation.  They traded questions and experiences back and forth until their eyes grew heavy and they drifted off to sleep.
“Ex Machina had caught my interest,” his response equally soft.
Ducking his head around the other side of Castiel's face, Dean licked at his throat.
It wasn't worth the fight.  No.  That wasn't right.  Cas was worth it, worth going through this fickle purgatory.  But Dean saw that arguing with him over anything at this point wouldn't solve their troubles and would likely make them worse.
an issue.  To them it seemed that Castiel's
Dean did as he was told.  The thought passed through his mind that he could prolong Castiel's touch if he positioned his body the wrong way.  He knew Castiel would need to touch him again to correct his stance.  But beyond the desire to feel Castiel's hands on him, Dean wanted to be good for his Dom.
Castiel nodded and finished the sandwich as Dean carefully removed his socks.
Dean recognized immediately that moving in with Castiel would solve his financial problems, at least temporarily, as he looked for another mechanic job or worked with Bobby to increase his hours.  But as Castiel had mentioned distaste at the thought of sharing his home, Dean saw that Castiel placed great value on his independence.  For now, Dean resigned to building up his bank account with a few weeks of work at Zachariah's.  Hopefully Bobby would find a way to make him a full-time employee before Zachariah got bored of housework and started asking for additional services.
“What happened?” Gabriel asked sincerely.  He had already filled the remainder of the pie tins and started the lattice work for the top crusts.
Dean started toward the cashier, but Castiel held up his hand.  “Sit.  Allow me.”  Castiel turned, disallowing any protest from Dean.  Dean caught on immediately.
he thought.
Dean's boots slapped the cement clumsily, but Cas?  He seemed to glide on top of the uneven sidewalk.
Warning: symptoms of depression
“I don't know, Dean,”  Castiel grumbled with annoyance.  “Feathers or leather... We could watch the show and find out.”  He gestured to the TV with a sigh.
Dean decided to just go for it, give Cas what he said he wanted.
“Might as well.  I’m still on zombie duty for a while, but maybe we can grab a late lunch?”
Dean admittedly had limited knowledge on what real life Dom/sub dynamic should be, but he had spent the past week reading everything he could on the internet.  After a quick assessment, he wondered if he was being too aggressive for Castiel to see him as a worthy submissive.  And damn if that thought didn't pack a punch.  Since when was he actually interested in being submissive for real?
When he was satisfied that all knots were secure, Castiel drew in a shaky breath. “Do you have more rope?” Dean could tell Cas was trying to sound calm and in control, but the tremble in his voice gave away his hesitation.
The sound of Castiel snapping at his ear brought him back just long enough to hear Cas explain how he was using ties to restrain Dean's arms behind his back and another tie to blindfold him.  He worked deliberately, binding Dean in such a way that the fabric braided around his forearms and secured at his wrists.
Castiel grew acutely aware to the feeling of Dean’s emotion and became accustomed to his company even more so than before.  There was an intimacy shared between them in their relative silence.  The energy between them spoke volumes that could not be expressed in words alone.  Because of this Castiel noticed an immediate change when Dean started to shut him out.
“How are you?”  Castiel used his sleeve to wipe Dean's slobber from his face.
Dean drew himself up and sat back so he could warm Cas properly.  But when he brought his hand forward, Dean’s heart thundered in alarm.  Castiel’s fingers were turning blue, circulation interrupted by the rope strapped around his arm.
The prosecuting attorney found ample evidence of malpractice and the insurance company called for an audit of their charts.  Castiel thought back on all the overtime he spent rewriting the doctors’ messy script and filing forms that his medical staff hadn’t bothered to complete.  He did his job to the best of his ability, but that doesn’t mean something hadn’t been overlooked.  It doesn’t mean he won’t be found to blame.
Dean held out his hand with the box in his palm.  It was wrapped in brown paper and finished with twine.  It looked very
There is a more detailed description of the sex-type warnings at the end note if you are concerned about the dub-con or any other aspect of it.
Gabriel looked horrified.  He set the pie plate on the counter as he considered their reaction.  Then: “Ew! What'd you guys do with the pie?”
He recalled his last relationship, how he struggled to reconcile their differences before the inevitable and painful breakup.  In the beginning, Markus did everything as Castiel instructed, but he ended up being into more pain than Cas could possible inflict in good conscience.  Purposely causing arguments and defying Castiel's direction, Markus incited Castiel to punishment.  True, the young man became putty afterward, soaking up Castiel's care with unquenchable thirst.  But the constant fighting left Castiel emotionally exhausted and he wondered how he could ever think he was in love with someone like that.
Castiel stared at his phone like he couldn't believe that another human could actually expect him to move, let alone depend on him for something as essential as food.
Castiel continually pushed kitty off of the couch and eventually resorted to using his legs to block Dean from coming near enough to try to climb up.  “Sleep, kitty.”  He pointed at the ground in aggravation, refusing to look at him.
Cas gripped the edge of the mattress until his fingers ached.  Dean had him leaning forward and he felt like he would fall.  “Dean,” he cried out before his feet felt the carpet.
The song faded out and Dean parked the car in the crowded lot.  People were milling about, some forming lines at the ticket booths and others pushed toward the festival gates.  Dean was up and out of the car in an instant, leaving Castiel behind with their trash.  He gathered it quickly, stuffing it in the paper bag and went to follow.
“Mmm,”  Dean licked his lips with a pleased smile.  “You'd still protect me though, right?”
In the silence that followed, Dean held his breath.  He was nearly shaking as he mentally prepared himself for rejection, but the rejection didn't come.
Dean suspected Castiel had seen the documentary before, especially as he went on and on about hollow bones and methane sacs.  When Castiel started listing minerals that could collect between a dragon's teeth and effectively cause a spark, Dean grinned at the fact he was dating a certified nerd.
With the intensity of the last week, Dean could hardly believe it had only been a week since they signed the contract.  And it felt like a lifetime had passed since their first conversation at the bar.
Dean nuzzled himself deeper into Castiel's arms because what was on his mind felt far too cheesy to say aloud.  He felt Castiel's lips graze the top of his head and lifted his eyes to Cas's.  There was still something
It was another twenty minutes before Kali had fallen asleep and Gabriel made his escape. He found Castiel and Dean in the waiting room, talking over coffee.
“So he's a dick,”  Dean said without looking up from their hands.
“Wait… so you run five miles each morning?  Like,
Dean helped Cas through a few minutes of breathing exercises until he was ready to face his coworkers again.
Castiel placed his hand on Dean's shoulder, feeling the man still under his touch.  He gave the shoulder a firm squeeze.  He wanted to tell Dean that it wasn't his fault, that he should have been better informed, better cared for.  Submission wasn't something to fear.  He felt Dean relax in the silence and gently removed his hand.  “Did you enjoy it?  At first?”
Gabriel grinned, already shoving chocolate candies into his mouth by the handful.  Regardless of Castiel and Dean's plans, Gabriel had already claimed the box of assorted junk food as his.
Dean undid his fly and swept off his clothing at the command.  It had been weeks since Castiel had looked at him like that, Dean worried he wouldn’t last long.  After escaping confinment, his dick throbbed in relief.  There was a new hunger in Cas’s eyes as he watched Dean's cock twitch and drool against his belly.  Castiel's hand moved within his own pants.
Castiel pushed aside the tacky colored tissue paper and pulled out his gift. At first he thought it was a scarf or a blanket, but the fabric just kept coming – yard after yard of soft cloth.  He had to bundle it up to keep it from dragging on the ground.  “Um. Thank you?”
The day before the race, Dean bounced around the garage with renewed vigor.  Castiel had placed some limits at work and was coming home earlier.  Finally, he had the interest and energy for some play which was doing them both a world of good.  And, of course, there was the 5-K.
Kali hummed around a spoon of mashed potato.  “You certainly know your way around a kitchen.  Doesn't he, darling?” She smacked Gabriel's arm.
Dean broke the seal and placed the box open on the dash.  “Yeah, I stopped there on the way to grab dinner.  You've been there before?”
Dean yawned with a lazy grin, “Good.”
At half-past five Gabriel left Dean to tend to dinner while he went to liberate his brother from the office.
Castiel couldn't argue, he always enjoyed playing with Dean.  “My birthday is September 18th.”
He pulled up next to the gold Trans Am Cas pointed out and apologized for monopolizing his Saturday.
Smiling, Dean clapped his hands together once and loud.  “Who's up for a lap around the block?”
Gabriel shrugged and they shared a smile, easing some of the tension that had lingered between them.
Dean didn't mind so much that Michael blew
Chapter 5
The arm beneath his hand trembled, but Dean made no sound.  Without ability to see the man’s expression, Castiel could only guess that he was laughing or crying.  From what he head read in the entries Dean had written, Castiel wouldn’t have been surprised to find the man doing both.
“Is he OK?”  The taller man peered easily over Castiel’s shoulder to survey the one on the ground.  “Shit, man, what happened?”  He moved to come closer and looked surprised to feel Castiel’s hands against his chest, pushing him back.  “Dude, what the Hell?  Who the heck do you think you are?”
“I did.”  Dean breathed heavily.  Distracted by lust, Dean answered more honestly than he intended.  “I read the titles of a couple articles and skimmed through Reddit.”
They came upon Castiel's block, walking on the opposite sidewalk from the house.  Dean saw the building grow as they approached and his response caught in his throat.
Dean looked up at him and pushed himself to his feet.
Dean placed their order at the drive-through window and paid with his own money.  “Put your wallet away, man.  I got it covered.”  He patted Castiel’s hand for emphasis.
Dean wrapped him up in a hug and pressed his face into the warm skin at his throat.
It turned out, getting Castiel up and dressed and out of the house was the worst of the battle.  Once Cas met the pavement, he broke into a light jog and it was Dean who had to worry about keeping up.
“Hey D, Cas.”  He received their tickets and let them through.  “Have fun guys.”
Castiel nodded.
He gave soft pressure to the pucker of Castiel’s ass and listened to his Dom groan for it. Cas wasn’t begging, not yet, but Dean could barely keep his hands off his own dick at the sound.
Having had a little of his own experience with prayer recently, Dean did the same. Clumsily talking to God, or whatever powers that be were listening, he asked for the baby’s safe delivery. Dean’s lips moved as he said his silent prayer. There were awkward silences as his mind tripped over reverent phrases until, finally, Dean settled into it like conversing with an old friend. He paused after a mumbled ‘amen’ and peaked at the quiet room with one eye open. He saw Cas’s eyes drifting over the empty chairs and Dean could guess what he was thinking. Family. Michael. Luce. Rafe. They should be here. Their parents should be here.
“Are you having fun?”
“Good kitty.”
Castiel looked up to see the security officer and the greeter from the club’s entrance.  Castiel steeled his expression before acknowledging them.
Physically, any part of Dean felt much like the rest.  A cool buzz of energy that seemed to penetrate Castiel’s flesh to the bone.  There was little difference in ‘feel’ between Dean’s hand and his mouth.  But there was something about being able to look down and see Dean’s full, pink lips wrapped around his cock that took Castiel to another place entirely.
Leaving Dean in the living room, Castiel recalled their day.  Dean, he thought, was doing very well.  He seemed to be using his kitten persona to work out some deep-seated neglect, but that was fine.  Castiel had confidence that Dean would eventually open up about the roots of those feelings.  It was Castiel who felt like his control was slipping.
Gabriel shrugged.  “He should’ve taken a knee.”
Dean was seconds from sleep but lifted his hand in a thumbs-up and gave a weak grunt.  His head rested on a pillow, arm dangling off the couch and onto the floor.
“Sorry, I know.  Look.”  Gabriel pursed his lips, considering how to approach the subject.  “It may not seem like it, but that little ball of awkward is my favorite person on the planet.  I wouldn't let anything happen to him that I could avoid.  And if that means entering awkward conversations with his boyfriend, I'll go there.”  Taking a breath, Gabriel pushed aside a handful of potato skins.  “Now, you guys have been together awhile right?”  He waved his hand through the air as if erasing a mistake.  “Of course you have.  Sorry.  It's just that Castiel has
“Wha-?”  Dean's question came out muffled by a mouthful of food.  After a hard swallow and a helpful drink of water, Dean tried again.  “What'd I do?  Why the frowny face?”
Anxious by the loss of Castiel's touch, Dean chewed harder at the inside of his mouth and brought his hands together to pinch the nerve between his thumb and forefinger.  He grimaced and breathed heavily as he fought for lucidity.
Dean's face lit up like the fourth of July.  “Yeah, OK.  But I've got a
Warnings: Foul language, Dean in a foul mood
Novak: I understand.
Dean nodded along, genuinely interested in the conversation.  The way Castiel spoke about his past was matter-of-fact, with little emotion conveyed in his voice or body language.  He asked more specifically about Castiel's first time Dominating.  Castiel shared openly about Anna and her penchant for rope.
the dragon
With a slight grunt of ungratified arousal, Dean tried to ignore his erectio and swallowed around the cool flesh of Castiel’s dick. He looped his fingers through the rope at Castiel’s hips to brace himself and to keep his hands off his own cock. Between his thighs, Dean’s member twitched and leaked with interest. It begged for friction, but Dean was going to deny himself that pleasure until Castiel was the one who provided it.
With a hop to his step, Dean walked them down the street to a door between a small café and laundromat.  “I'm just above the coffeehouse,” he explained.  They traveled up two narrow flights of steps to a small landing.  The smells of detergent and fresh coffee warred in the stairwell.  Castiel crinkled his nose in distaste.  Dean laughed, noticing his expression.
Castiel moved slowly and pushed himself up from the bed.  “You're OK, little one.”  Castiel spoke softly as he slipped out of the bedroom to the front door.  He took his coat from the hook and shrugged it on.  With a brief stop in the kitchen to put away the food and turn off the preheating oven, Castiel made his way back to the bedroom.
The next morning Castiel woke to an offensive amount of noise coming from his alarm clock.  It was certainly not the orchestrations he was used to hearing in the morning and he cringed as old-school rock 'n' roll blared from the speakers.  Castiel's arm swung out with purpose but instead of smacking into the plastic frame of his clock, it collided with something else.
Dean truly wanted to roll his eyes at that one, but he closed them instead.  “Yeah,” he admitted through clenched teeth, “but you're giving me a massage.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Trust
Dean crawled at his side while Castiel washed his hands at the sink and put the pizza in the fridge.  His neck ached from looking up at Castiel the whole time, but Dean felt like it was important to keep an eye on him so he ignored the cramping.  And there was a brief moment, while Castiel swept the kitchen floor, that made it all worth it.
With a blush, he quickly brought his eyes back to the knot he was tying. He reminded himself that although he was doing the tying, he was still trying to give Castiel his control as Dominant – and that meant, no eye contact unless otherwise specified.
Definitely not a date, then, Castiel thought as he opened his own door and let himself into the car.  At least he had a friend with which to go to the festival.  Only, when Dean pulled out of the driveway, he wasn’t going toward Singer’s field.  Castiel kept his eyes trained on the road, to figure out where he was being taken.  A tiny seed of panic planted itself into his gut, ready to sprout at any further sign of danger.
Tyring to be helpful, Dean offered to look some up – which really meant that he was going to ask Sam to do some research.  Dean even agreed to train with Castiel for his next race.
Dean crouched for a better look as he skimmed over the titles, pulling on albums and journals to read their covers.  There were a lot of how-to and self-help books, but their bindings were stiff.  Dean pulled out a thick, grey text book and turned it over in his hands.  The bold initials on the cover didn't make much sense, but Dean leafed through it anyway.  Page after page of text.  No pictures, no diagrams, no tables.  Not helpful.
He didn't know how it could be only a few weeks since they'd been introduced, but something clicked when they were together and Dean felt like Castiel was the only person who could understand.  His eyes glistened as he watched for Castiel's reaction.
“No.”  Castiel's command rang out deep and imposing.  He stood tall in the exit and nudged Dean back into the room with the side of his foot.  “You're in time out until I decide what to do with you.  Stay in here until you learn to behave.”
Dean laughed at first, feeling a bit ridiculous that Cas would spend so much time just kissing him.  He wanted to tell Cas that he's not some delicate thing, he's not going to break.  But as he started paying closer attention to the hands framing his body and the whispers that passed over Castiel's lips, he wondered if he'd been lying to himself.
Cas moved into the chair next to him and the laugh lines were replaced with those of concern.  “Do you feel OK?”  There were those hands again, this time feeling his forehead and cheeks as if for fever.  It was almost like Cas was looking for any excuse to touch him and Dean was surprised to feel he didn’t mind.
“Yes,” Castiel answered.  “I understand.”
“I'm not asking for you to approve of me.”  There was only one person he wanted to please.  And as Michael's curt laughter carried across the globe, Dean realized he couldn't give two shits if the guy liked him anymore.  Gabriel was right. Michael was a self-important ass clown who doesn't deserve Castiel's adoration or consideration.  Maybe it
“Wha- no, it’s… Ahh.”  Dean hissed and his shoulders slumped forward.  He didn’t fully comprehend why Cas felt so entitled to lay his hands all over him, but it felt too good to protest against.
“Fat Kids' Club,” Castiel says with a sigh as he opened the bag.  “Gabriel and I were the stand outs growing up.  Youngest and heaviest.  We created the club as a joke so we wouldn't feel so bad when our brother's picked on our weight.”
“Yeah,” Dean remembered calling Sam when he was upset.  The week he decided to quit Alistair's was intense, but he certainly had not been crying.  “I gotta get back to work.”  Dean's thumb hovered over the button to end the call.
Dean's legs straddled Castiel as he stood.  His hands lingered on his thighs while he waited for Castiel's hands to make their slow journey up his arms and to the nape of his neck.  He thrilled as Castiel pulled him forward.
“What can I do for you, Winchester?”  The lilt to Michael's voice made him sound very important and it didn't seem like the name struck a chord with the man.  Dean almost felt guilty for interrupting whatever was going on halfway around the world.
Coming up to the storefront, Castiel caught sight of Dean.  He watched the sidewalk from a small table near the entry.  He appeared nervous, excited, drumming his fingers on the windowsill.  Dean smiled as he saw Castiel approach.  He stood up to extend a greeting, but was unsure whether shaking hands would be appropriate.  He tucked his hands in his pockets and nodded instead.
As Dean dressed and readied himself for work, Castiel laid quietly. He held himself tighter, missing the feel of Dean’s rope already.  He hadn’t known being bound like that could be so grounding, feel so safe.  Now that it was gone, Castiel felt vulnerable and alone.  He ran his hands over his ribs, sinking the tips of his fingers into the impressions left behind by the rope.  He traced Dean’s design until exhaustion took its toll.
“Since when have I ever enjoyed our little heart-to-hearts?”  Dean walked to the corner of the garage to try to move out of his coworkers' earshot.  “And on the rare occasion we do sit down for a chick-flick moment, am I ever at work?”
Gabriel's hands fumbled with the potato peeler, but it was something to do, a way to keep his mind occupied by anything other than thoughts of his brother losing his grip.  “He gets into funks sometimes.  I don't know if it's like, capital D depression or whatever, but...”
When he returned, the bowl and ingredients were laid out on the floor and Dean’s static hovered at the doorway.
Dean smiled, “You know what I was thinking today?  When you were kangaroo-ing around with Anji in your pouch?”
“Just a bit.  We wouldn't tell Castiel if you said 'no'.”  She rubbed her belly.  “If you haven't noticed, I'm gigantic with child and it would be a great help if we had someone we could trust... Four nights during the week?  Three?  We'd pay you, of course.”
These hits were barely enough to register, compared to last time.  Dean huffed in frustration and curled his toes into the floor. His nails digging into the hardwood hurt more than Castiel's palm today.
Dean seemed intimidated and uneasy in the warehouse and, somehow, that helped.  Castiel knew he had to hold it together for Dean until they made it to the cashier in one piece.
Castiel did his best to keep calm and quiet, not wanting to disturb the natural order of things.  He kept the house dark, shades drawn at all times.
Castiel enjoyed a few minutes of this before he caressed Dean's face and patted the couch beside him.
“Yeah?”  Garth peeked out from under the hood of the truck he was servicing.
The music seemed to have a healing quality on Dean's soul as he bobbed his head and mumbled along with the radio.  It definitely helped the time pass and Dean actually found himself laughing when Garth started dancing to Charlie Daniels.  His gangly limbs flailed all over the place.  Dean stopped his work to watch, afraid Garth might hurt himself.
There was plenty of time to spare before Castiel would be home from work, so Dean went to Ambrosia to check in with Gabriel.
“You sure?  I have some money saved up.  I thought I'd come visit over the holidays, but I can come up earlier.”
“Breasts are for feeding babies,” she reminded them both with authority.  She corrected her daughter’s latch and greeted Dean.
Cas recognized the tune from the night before, but instead of associating it with the soothing hum of the lullaby, his mind stuck to the lyrics about sex.  He felt offended rather than flattered.
Castiel gestured for Dean to join him.
Castiel blinked slowly and opened his eyes.  They looked out at Dean in front of him and softened.  With effort, Castiel lifted his hand to Dean's face and rubbed behind his ear affectionately.  “Missed you, Kitty.” he mumbled into the pillow.
Castiel let free a feral sound – hungry and wild – before pushing Dean up against the door.  He placed his hands against the wood on either side of Dean, boxing him in.
While he waited for the food, Dean figured he could run an alternative idea by Benny.  If he couldn't come back as a bartender, then Dean didn't want to work for Alistair at all.  But maybe there was another talent he could put to use.
Dean's eyes had adjusted to the dim light enough to see Castiel look impressed.  “You translated Vonnegut?”
Castiel fell asleep on their way back to his house, so Dean took the opportunity to stop at the apartment for supplies. Cas had already left a message at work, letting the office know he wouldn’t be coming in. Dean wasn’t so lucky and Bobby expected him at the garage to open, with the understanding that he could cut out early in the afternoon.
Are you still interested in dinner?
Gabe covered his mouth to hide that it had come unhinged.  Was Castiel going to reject the proposal?  Seriously?  Didn’t his little brother have any sense in his thick skull?
Dean scooted himself further up Castiel's side and tucked under his Master's arm.  Castiel placed a kiss to Dean's hair and was rewarded by the sound of a low rumble from deep in Dean's chest.  The purr vibrated between them, tickling and soothing all at once.  Castiel pulled Dean closer and his fingers curled around the short hairs behind Dean's ear.  He couldn't resist kissing him again.
He couldn't figure this one out.  Was it a game?  A lesson in patience?  Was the punishment in the waiting?
It was easier to get Cas out of bed the second day, though certainly not without it's challenges.  It seemed Castiel had found some internal motivation for the exercise and his efforts toward that objective got them up and out in half the time as the day before.
“Says they even do full special effects make up on the zombies.”  Dean could hear Sam's grin in his voice.  “Dude, you're gonna love this!”
In answer, Castiel crawled over the mattress and burrowed under the untucked comforter.  Dean came in close behind and Cas was glad for the company.  He had been too long home alone, assaulted by the negativity he fought so hard to ignore.  But Dean returned, despite Cas's failings.  Waiting, perhaps, for the Castiel he knew, the Castiel who had told Dean that he would always take care of him.
Dean pushed through the swarm of bodies, not putting up any effort to ask for pardon.  He doubted anyone would hear it anyway.
Dean ended his conversation with Zachariah and agreed to meet on Thursday for their first session.  Dean recorded the address in his phone and stopped by Ellen's counter to pick up the burgers on his way out.  Baby was loaded with dinner, dessert, and a wool blanket – all that was missing was Castiel.  Within minutes, Cas was in place as well, sitting in the passenger seat looking fondly at Dean.
Knowing Cas had had a long day, Dean took him gently in his arms.  “Almost done here,” he said, lowering the grill’s flame.  “You want your first gift?”
Dean took even breaths, trying to emulate the calm confidence that Castiel had demonstrated while practicing his Dominance.  With a simple suggestion, Dean was able to coax Castiel into the apartment and through to the bedroom.
He wasn't.  Not really.
Picking the inseam of his jeans, Dean cleared his throat, “It's getting late, no?”
Castiel followed close behind; his words of concern drowned out by the music.
“Cas.”  His voice was soft and deep, rolling out of his throat and into the space between them.
“Yeah?”  Dean sipped from his beer, sucking foam off his lip.  “Me too.  So, you never told me, why does the bee have angel wings on your jars of honey?”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Sam.”
Gabriel shuffled toward the last few boxes and sighed. “I picked out a bunch of decorations. Kali said she wanted a theme for the room, but I don’t know if it’s too much.”
, Dean thought,
Under Castiel's touch, Dean's breathing evened out.  Castiel reached for his glass of water and urged Dean to drink at least half before he was allowed to sleep.  With Castiel's assistance, Dean finished the water and settled back down to rest.  Castiel positioned Dean's head on a pillow and covered his nudity with a blanket.  He folded back the blanket carefully, exposing only one limb at a time.  On his knees, he took his time to massage Dean's legs, feet, arms, and hands.  When his hands came to Dean's neck and shoulders, Castiel noticed that Dean was still awake.
Castiel narrowed his eyes at the paper-wrapped sandwich in his lap, wondering yet again if this was a date.  “Dean?  May I ask you a question?”
Dean shook his head and swayed only slightly forward.
“Dean,”  Castiel brushed the stray hairs from Dean's forehead, “you are far too pretty to be a prince.”
That was how Cas had addressed him when he woke from Gabriel's couch.  Dean could do that, be that, for Castiel now.
Castiel shrugged like the promise meant nothing, like he couldn’t remember making it.  “I had to get out of there.”
Castiel nodded, his face breaking into a small smile.  “I haven’t been out on a date in so long.  This night has gone better than I could have planned.”
Castiel breathed over Dean’s dick, cooling the smears of precome and causing Dean to shiver.  He took Dean’s length into his mouth and to the back of his throat in one quick motion.  There was no need for pretense and Castiel was in no mood to tantalize and tease.  He sucked with earnest and rode Dean’s cock with his mouth like it was a race to the finish.
Castiel stood back and watched as Dean doubled over with mirthless laughter.  This was just another example of what he couldn't understand about Dean.  After punishment he seemed fine.  They had played and touched and kissed.  Castiel had admitted things to him that he had never felt for anyone before.  He thought that they were reaching a new level of intimacy and hadn't been prepared for it to dissolve into this.  It was almost as if the aftercare made Dean worse and even just considering that scared Castiel.
“Don't touch me,” Castiel croaked, pushing himself onto his feet.  His face was blotched red and he turned from the kitchen without so much as a backward glance.  “Eat something before bed,” his voice was worn as he shrugged on his coat and stepped out of the apartment.  He wasn't planning to be gone for long; he just needed some distance.
Castiel finally made his way inside, following the wet footprints along the tile floor.  He sat at the table, taking the chair beside one that was already pulled out and presumably occupied.  Castiel reached out into the space and found that he could feel… something.  It wasn’t solid, but the space was not empty either.  His hand lingered just above where he imagined Dean’s arm to be, feeling the cool tingle of paranormal energy under his palm.
Dean's phone chimed with more incoming messages. “Says he was feeling tired after work and didn't see the point.”  Dean frowned.  “He's kidding, right?”
“Two things actually.”  Dean absently uncapped the bottle and handed it to Cas.  “First, you're birthday is in, what, like three weeks?  Second, you're younger than me.”
Between the phone calls and research he had to make in assistance to other hunters, Castiel skimmed through the pile of rejection and failure that Dean had amassed.  It was there that he found a common trend and began to understand for what it was that Dean was looking.
A slow smile spread across Dean's face at the sound of Castiel's voice.  He blinked himself awake and squirmed his way into a seated position.  “What time is it?”
Dean looked, really looked, at Castiel and his irritation began to deflate.  Castiel stood across from him with an open expression of acceptance that seemed to say,
It felt dangerous to lose control like this, but Dean couldn't think about anything other than betrayal.  The feelings were no longer a fantasy of
When Castiel entered to announce that dinner was served, he found Dean kneeling in quiet meditation.  He cleared his throat.  “Kitty?”  Dean perked up at the greeting.  “Come eat.”
Dean wanted this.  He needed this as well as kisses, and if Castiel didn't give it to him and he couldn't take it for himself, what was Dean to do?
Castiel gave it to him as he asked for it.  “This is what you want.”
Dean joined Castiel under the gentle spray of water, massaging soap into Cas's skin and frothing shampoo in his raven hair.  He leaned into Dean with a low sound of comfort and rested in the embrace of arms and steam.
Castiel
Castiel started hinting at how late it was and Dean heard his cue to turn up the charm.  He hopped out of his seat and jogged around the Impala to open the car door for Castiel.  Butterflies swarmed in his stomach as they walked up the brick steps together.  Dean looked over to see that Castiel was smiling just as he had in his daydream and the temptation to kiss it from his lips grew with each passing second.
Castiel entered the new contact information to his phone before logging out and locking up.  With the security alarm set, Castiel brought his phone is to his ear and called Dean.
In the kitchen, Dean set a pot of water to boil for tea, one for rice, another for pasta, and a fourth for potatoes.  He worked efficiently, quickly refrigerating the perishables and leaving the rest of the grocery unpacking for later.  He prepared enough starches for at least a week of lunches and dinners.
Dean slowed as they approached the block.  “Say when.”  But as Castiel lifted his hand to point out the white building with red accents, Dean realized he should have known.  He pulled up to the curb and set the car in park.  “This is where you live?”  Dean couldn't stop staring at the front door, recalling the image of Castiel and their children.
“You make faces when you watch me eat.”  With one hand carrying the bread basket and the other supplying the dish of eggplant, Dean made his way across the kitchen.
Castiel shushed him and rubbed placating circles into Dean's back.  He nearly choked on his words as he struggled to scrape together the strength to go through the motions of the day.  “It's fine, Dean.  This sort of thing happens.  We'll figure it out.”  He proposed that they set aside time to review and revise the entire document together later tonight.
When the glass was empty and the collar of his shirt soaked with melted ice, the man groaned but did not wake. Even unconscious, the man’s forehead was lined with worry.  Castiel wondered what could trouble someone so young, so deeply.
Dean whipped his head from side to side, scanning the audience for Castiel.  But when he laid eyes on the man in the trench coat, there was no comfort to be found.  Castiel approached the stage and his blue eyes held nothing but bored amusement.  The scene continued as Alistair and Michael endeavored to strip Dean of what little self-worth he clung to.  All the while, Castiel watched without comment.
“Yes, I am quite aware of my brothers,” he said seriously, any trace of panic wiped clean of his tone.  “What I don't understand is why a
Dean quickly got the hint and apologized.  “I was reading about different types of BDSM relationships and came across one that I'd like to explore.”
“I can't feed you if you're lying down.”
He moved up Dean's arm, licking at the ticklish area inside the elbow and up the underside of his arm.
When he had finished, Castiel stared toward the horizon.  But his eyes didn’t see the storm clouds rolling in.  He didn’t feel the drops of rain upon his face.
Castiel glanced at the wall clock, “I suppose it is.”  His eyes lingered on the time as he wondered where the day went.  He turned back to Dean slack-jawed in awe and newfound appreciation for his friend.
Dean pulled Castiel closer and held him loosely by the front of his jacket.  He looked up through thick lashes and bit his lip.  He whispered, “Is this a date, Cas?”
Dean turned into the touch and allowed his master to wipe the shine of grease from his chin.  They continued this game until Dean had managed to clear every piece of chicken from the bowl.  Dinner was pleasant and had passed too quickly.  In an effort to drive home his willingness for submission (and to prolong the feeling of Castiel's hand on his ass) Dean licked the bowl clean as Cas watched.
Dean arrived in the early evening with a nervous smile and grocery bags in his arms.  Gabriel thrilled as he noted the absence of birthday gift.  He grinned maniacally at the thought that his little brother would soon be engaged.
Dean chewed his lip with a frown.  He shook his head and tentatively reached for the document.  Catching himself before grabbing the paperwork, Dean looked up at Castiel patiently.  Castiel warmed at Dean's unsolicited act of submission.  “Please,” Castiel encouraged Dean to read through the paperwork.  “This is only a draft, an outline of what a contract could include.  When you are through, I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.”
“I don't know,”  Castiel turned to focus on anything other than Dean's face.  “It's nothing”
When Dean made it back to the kitchen, Gabriel was sitting at the table, sorting through the mail.  The groceries were still in their boxes strewn over the tiled floor.
“I had a good dream.”  Castiel said as he served himself, then Dean.  He poured generous helpings of the apple topping over their pancakes.  “If this tastes as good as it looks, I may have to stay for breakfast more often.”
A/N: Another big THANK YOU to everyone who keeps coming back for more!
There wasn't much Dean could say to that.  If the past week was any indication, Dean knew that he had no grasp on what tomorrow would bring.  “We could still have downtime thought, right?”
As his fingers swept over Dean's neck, they slipped under the collar of his shirt and squeezed the muscle of his shoulder.
Reaching behind the bar again, the man snatched up a bottle of water and unscrewed the cap.  He placed his hand over Castiel's to hold the glass steady while he poured.  The touch of his hand sent a pulse of excitement over Castiel's skin.  The hairs on his arm stood on end.  The man pressed into his personal space, causing swirls of excitement in Castiel's chest.  Typically, Castiel only felt at ease when he could delude himself into feeling some semblance of control over a situation.  With his companion driving their interactions, Castiel scrambled to pull himself together.
“Where are you?”  Castiel kept asking as he came around Dean's front, seeing his sub's awareness drift in and out of the present.  There was fear and confusion in Castiel's questions as he wondered what switch had flipped to create this change in Dean.  “Where are you going?”
Without the ever present buzz of Dean’s energy, Castiel felt alone.  He hadn’t felt loneliness that way in longer than he could remember and he found himself frightened for his friend. He feared Dean was losing his grip. Or worse, that Dean felt the need to hide his dark-ward turn.
Toe catching on a raised stone, Dean stumbled and swore, but Cas turned with an arm out to steady him and slowed down a bit.  Sure-footed again, Dean smiled in gratitude and aimed to jog beside Cas instead of behind.  Although, he was giving up a great view by doing so.
Dean snuggled closer, tossing a leg over Castiel's thigh.  “Got you, babe.  Whatever you need.”
“Phew.  I would have been castrated, I think,” he forced a laugh.
“Mr. Novak, we know you are familiar with our policies.   At absolutely no time is it appropriate for any guest to approach the stage as you did.”  Security spoke in monotone, bored as if he had recited these lines often.
Slowly, Castiel turned to face him.  He cautiously expressed that he felt their contract was not working for them.  He was apologetic and specified that while he had no desire to end their relationship, serious changes need to be made in the contract.  The contract, the contract.  If Castiel could only keep his focus on the contract, then maybe Dean wouldn't see what was really happening.
, Dean was missing the point.  For all his hunting for clues and meticulous observation, he was blind to the fact that
Novak: Dean, I have not been able to concentrate on anything but thoughts of you and when I might see you again.
“Oh, hold that thought, dude,” Dean reached for the radio knob, turning up the volume.  “This song’s my favorite.”
Gabriel nearly jumped out of his seat.
Castiel rested their foreheads together and, though he was still frowning, some of the hurt had faded from his eyes.
Despite Dean's attempts to lick them clean, Castiel's hands ended up a complete mess of grease and sauce.
“It's what Dean calls you,”  he said matter-of-fact.
“Why, thank you, Doctor Novak.”  Dean sat up so they were facing each other.  “So, back to the subject of wings: feather or leather?”
Gently spreading Castiel’s legs apart, Dean knelt between his partner’s knees. His fingertips tripped up Castiel’s muscled thighs and drummed on his jutting hip bones as he considered his next move. Dean wanted Castiel to feel good, but he didn’t want to startle him either. He licked his lips as he traced the curve of Castiel’s stomach.
It was answer enough for Bobby who swapped out the sludge for another sports drink and gave Castiel a look.  “Make sure he drinks that.  I’ll get his pill.”
Castiel reached for a truffle and used his fingernail to break it in half.  “Gabriel doesn't really like to settle anywhere too long, but he made a home with Kali in the suburbs.  I thought I had mentioned it.”  The inside was a thick caramel-colored cream that smelled like brandy.  He placed it back inside the box and grabbed another.
Dean saw himself offer submission freely in the gesture and appreciated how Castiel's hand immediately dropped to his head, petting him.
he made a face, but what else was he supposed to say?
Castiel seemed to read his mind and stroked from the top of Dean’s head to the base of his spine in one long movement.  “We can do both.”
The man beside him gave a small chuckle.  “Need a refill?”
“I'll finish dinner,”  Castiel walked to the stove just as Dean turned off the flame.
Raising an eyebrow, Castiel sighed.  “When we started you weren't even paying attention.”
“I told him we’re going out to the park for a run and a picnic.”
Dean’s eyes locked on his with frenzied worry.  He pressed his mouth to the palm of Cas’s hand, kissing it twice before answering. “Don’t do this again, Baby.”  His breath was warm as he spoke, but his voice was firm.
Sometimes they would work for hours in frustrated silence, other times a vibration of hope filled the room.  On occasion there were days when Dean had gotten so deeply into his research that all would be still.
The festival was standing room only, but even that wasn’t really an accurate depiction.  Their bodies pressed together among a mass of sweaty strangers.  The music was loud, energy sparking up and filling the crowd with every guitar solo.  Whenever the singers shouted into the microphone, the people dancing threw their fists into the air and screamed along.
Dean read the race bib more carefully and took note of the event.  It seemed like a positive memory and Dean was determined to have Castiel focus on happier times, while hopefully creating more of the same.  Placing the album on Castiel's dresser, he saw a pair of trainers peeking out from beneath the bed and his mind brewed with a plan.  He was cautiously confident that Castiel would benefit from running again, but for now, Dean knew he had to get him through the night without inadvertently pushing Cas away.
Dean hung up the phone and got out of the car to stretch.  It was almost nine and still no sign of this bozo.  He was just about to call again when he received a text from Zachariah.
Castiel spanked him harder, his hand coming down on Dean's ass again and again in quick succession.
“A friend.”  His lip still curled in a snarl, Castiel glanced between the two men.  “And you?”
“Huh? Oh. No.” His older brother scoffed. “Don’t even worry about that. Kali was superstitious, not me.” Gabriel slipped past them into the hallway and pulled on the drop-down stair hatch. “I got everything we need in the attic, but if my lady starts asking questions we’re going with Cassie’s story about the 24-hour Wal-mart.”
For the first time in a long time, Castiel felt like he could trust someone else to take care of him.
“Castiel, are you happy?”  Michael's question came from a place of genuine concern for his brother.
“We do.  Mostly.”  Dean took a dust cloth to the tables and counters.  “He hasn’t asked me to move in and I haven’t pushed it.  We’re happy.”
Castiel needed a moment to soak that in, “You know?”  Michael had never been particularly interested in Castiel's romantic life; to hear him speak so casually about it now was encouraging.
Dean squeezed another half lemon into the small saucepan for tea and stirred in a large spoon of honey.  “He did not tell you that.”
Cas: I am glad that you are alright. I hope you have a nice day.
Jumping to his feet, Dean grabbed a mangled shoe and moved quickly to the bedroom.  Once there, he resumed his angry work with trembling hands.
“What?”  Dean’s face does a little frowny thing without actually dropping its smile that Castiel has seen already once today.  “No, buddy, it’s tonight.”
“But during pet play you called yourself Daddy, remember?” Dean chewed at his lip, a habit Castiel found equally attractive and displeasing.  He liked to see Dean submissive, not uncertain.
