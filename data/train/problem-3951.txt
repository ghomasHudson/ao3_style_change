Dean was silent. Castiel couldn’t stand to see the embarrassed hurt all over Dean’s face; surely,
“I agree,” Castiel sighed tiredly. The fire was no more than smoldering embers and the emotional whiplash of the past few hours had drained him. “We will have to figure out a path forward—” Beside him, Hannah slumped forward a little, looking as bone-tired as Castiel felt. “—but it can wait until tomorrow.”
Unfortunately, there was a fair amount of risk in seeking out the one person who might be able to offer guidance, especially if it turned out that he and Hannah would need to marry regardless. But the thought of Hannah, sobbing against him and asking for forgiveness for her lack of affection, was still fresh in his mind; it was worth the risk, for both their sakes.
So at ease, in fact, that he walked for two hours before realizing he really had no idea which direction he should be going.
Dean sheepishly approached the reception counter for the fourth time in fifteen minutes to grab a few more tissues. The woman behind the desk smiled sympathetically at him.
Tan skin stretched over strong calves and thick thighs; Castiel was a runner, Dean was sure of it. Sharp hip bones came into view and the camera lingered at Castiel’s crotch, drawing wolf whistles from the crowd. He had no tan lines and a cock that Dean was certain could put several alphas in this room to shame. Eventually, the camera continued its journey upward over a toned stomach, sculpted pectorals, and broad shoulders. Despite his bound hands, the flex of his biceps was clearly visible. The camera stayed put at Castiel’s fabric-covered head.
“A couple of Jody’s friends were hurt during a run-in with this guy,” Dean answered, keeping his gaze aimed at the bedroom window. “I don’t think they were turned, but Jody asked us to make sure, so Sam is with them at the hospital.”
Dean glanced at him again, assessing this time. “Of course I can,” he said, “Nothing fancy, mind you. Enough to get by on my own in the tower.”
“Apologies, I—you had—” He turned and all but threw a few pastries onto his own plate. “I should bring these to Hannah before they go cold,” he finally managed, not waiting for a reply before making a hasty exit, avoiding any further eye contact.
"Thanks, Charlie," he said, pulling on a clean pair of gloves, "Go ahead and clean up the counters some, I'll take orders for now."
Sam called it "the food version of having hundreds of pet pictures on your phone."
If Dean were honest with himself, he was being a goddamn coward about it. Anytime he found himself alone with Castiel, he found some excuse to high-tail it out of there. He could barely look Cas in the eye without feeling horrible about all the times he and Sam should have remembered to check on him. Cas had been there for both of them so many times, and they repaid him with…next to nothing.
Cas' mouth opened in shock and stayed that way, the halo and wings bounced slightly as he sat up straight.
"You can't just 'perform manual stimulation' while I'm right next to you! Dude, we share the fucking bed!"
"Uh, thanks", Dean muttered, almost kicked Cas accidentally as he felt warm hands wander from his chest downtown, "what the hell are you doing Cas?"
"Yes, Sir", Cas breathed out as Dean's hands found their places at his nipples again. He clawed into the mattress as he felt light kissing trailing a way down his body.
"What happened?", Bobby asked, Sam hurried from the kitchen with a first-aid-kit. "I fled from a fight and miscalculated the landing in the hurry", Cas shuttered, whinging when he tried to sit up, so Dean pushed him back down, "and fell into a bush nearby."
Cas' mouth was open but no words came out, he just looked up to Dean in disbelief, "I do", Cas whispered distressed, "I would much rather stay down here with you, Dean. I hate leaving you behind but I have to do this."
"I'll perform manual stimulation to 'take care of my boner'."
"Really?", Dean's eyes lit up in excitement, he jumped off the bed, "perfect, perfect okay", Dean had to calm himself down for a second and lick over his dry lips, "can you uh- undress yourself and put it on? I'll grab the lube!"
"I'm fine, Dean!", Cas shouted annoyed, leaned casually against the car door of the impala while Sam destroyed all evidence. "Yes, because Sam and I saved you just in time! You can't just zap right into a vampire hideout!", Dean answered, pressing him against the car, "you are being way to reckless the last couple of weeks!"
Cas squinted, not only because of the sudden nickname but also because of the word 'Dom'. "Uh...", he licked over his lips, "a D-Dom? I don't know what that is."
In the end Dean just lay next to Cas, pulled the short one close to his chest and stroked his back softly. Fixing a few lost hair strains.
"It sure is", Dean agreed, "but hair pulling isn't by far the strongest sexual feeling. If you get so worked up over hair pulling you'd probably faint after an orgasm."
"I-I'm-", Cas tried to apologise but was cut short when a sharp snap appeared and his right cheek began to burn. He flinched and whined into the cushion. That was so not what he had expected but better than being stabbed right?
"Yeah and he's heavier than he looks", Dean murmured and got into his car, "I hope he wakes up soon."
Cas squinted confused and just wordlessly held the eye contact trough his glasses. "You have such pretty eyes", Dean muttered fascinated and seemed to be in his own thoughts for a moment while Cas just wanted to release some of the enorm lust he felt. After he realised that Dean didn't seem to say something he just broke the eye contact silently and went back to work.
"Dean, it's annoying."
Dean actually smirked at him, looking pleased before pulling back and going all businesslike, "ground rules. You do as I say. If you have a wish or a question you say something but you always call me either sir or master. If you want to stop or pause you tell me. If you disobey, I will punish you and you will thank me for it. Do you understand?"
Cas huffed embarrassed but also positive affected by the attention, he looked down onto the mattress but Dean quickly grabbed his chin und pulled it upwards again.
Cas felt the excitement bubbling up as Dean let him go to open his pants and push them down to his ankles. He could barely contain himself when Dean's boxers followed and his hard dick was finally right in front of him.
"My true form can't be processed by your human minds. I have multiple heads the height of your Chrysler Building."
"Dean, you wear a lot more than me currently and I don't think that's appropriate", Cas murmured in between little kisses. Dean snickered quietly, one hand stroking softly trough Cas' hair, "I think so too", Dean admitted with a big grin, "but I feel like you should help out a bit."
Cas on the other hand was a mess. Dean almost snickered as he sat up and appeared in the mirror, hair shaggy, the tie lose, a few buttons open. He was flushed red, breathing hard and had this disoriented, wild look in his eyes.
"U-Uh...", Cas gulped, "Can we... can we continue now?", he asked shyly, still in a desperate need to come after he calmed down from the shock. Dean eyes widened again, "you want to continue the session?"
"Uhm...", Dean scratched his neck, "so you should do it when the person is awake first of all. And when you are alone I'd say."
"Show me your wrists baby", Dean purred, the pet name made Cas whimper and comply wordlessly.
The angel nodded, "I understand. You need a certain time and place before doing it."
Cas got home late the next day because he agreed on assisting Uriel with a task that was way to big for the two of them to handle normally. Gabriel's words still stuck to him and okay, maybe he really was a people please.
But then again, Dean strictly didn't want to tell Sam -even though it was clear that he already knew- and didn't want to show any affection towards the angel outside of motel rooms or the Impala but he made always sure to make up for it afterwards because he felt bad for it. Cas calculated that they were in this complicated situation either because he was in a male vessel and Dean had a really twisted mindset when it came to that. Or because it was because of his true entity as an angel. Maybe it was both.
Dean just pressed his lips together and didn't replied which was good enough of an answer for Sam. Meanwhile Cas just sat relaxed in the backseat with a small, satisfied, dorky smile on his face.
"Sure", Cas answered already, gaze still on the Tv. Dean hesitated, watched him a moment and then walked over to his duffel bag, "do you remember the theatre club we helped out two weeks ago?", he asked his... his whatever he was.
Cas' eyes went wide while Dean just leaned back with that damn cocky smile, "w-what...", he couldn't continue because he was too shocked when Dean suddenly grabbed him by the upper arm and practically dragged him towards the couch to push him over the armrest.
Dean stood up again but was stopped by Cas' hand on his arm, "please don't go", Cas begged, hated how desperate he sounded. "I won't, I won't", Dean assured him and stroke his hair like he did before, "I'll make sure that you are fine before I'll leave. And we'll have to talk about it more."
"Guys?", appeared Sam's voice from outside, "I uh... I've waited like ten minutes already and I don't want to be the downer but it's freaking freezing out here."
"Y-Yeah I uh... I understand, Sir",
If Dean didn't knew any better he'd say Cas was pouting at that statement.
"Dean", Cas moaned and that drew the line to Dean's patience. With his hands in Cas' hair, le leaned forward pressed their lips together. Cas muffled into the kiss and reciprocated immediately as if he had already waited for it. Dean almost instantly felt that Cas had no kissing experience but the way the angel desperately tried to imitate Dean's movement were more than enough for the hunter.
"God, that was perfect", Dean groaned satisfied. Cas flinched and nudged him, so they fell on the mattress, Cas still on top of him, "don't pray to my father while we have or shortly after sexual intercourse."
"God, you wouldn't believe how crowded-", Sam stopped as he looked over to the red faces of his brother and friend. His gaze went down to the empty bottles, "seriously Dean?", Sam sighed and placed the boxes on the table, "stop trying to get Cas drunk."
"I'm feeling rather fine, thank you Sam", Cas answered kinda wanky, sank deeper into the seat back. Sam just looked at Dean with raised eyebrows but just got a shrug in return.
"It's uh-", Dean gulped, "it's an angel costume. I thought it was uh... cute and maybe we could use it during sex."
"What did you thought, Castiel?", Dean asked, voice suddenly hard and impatient, his eyes gazing at him intensely. Cas gulped, "t-that you were maybe a... prostitute? That Gabriel had booked for me? He like kinda mentioned that I need to get laid again yesterday."
He really didn't knew what to say so he just continued to stare and tried not to slobber over the sight.
Damn right he did and that damn human knew that all too well. "You're manipulating me", Cas mumbled offended but really turned around again so he could face Dean. "I'm just reminding you of what you like", Dean defended himself with a cocky smile, placed a sloppy kiss on Cas' lips, "you gonna continue to pout or do you finally let me prepare you, angel?"
Cas nodded and looked down onto the blanket. Dean rubbed his chin and seemed to inspect the other one closely, thinking about their next step, "lay down comfortably, okay?", Dean decided in the end and stood up from the bed again, "I won't tie you up again. We are gonna start slowly and if you don't like something, say something", Dean continued while Cas leaned back again.
"D-Dean I think I'm about to ejaculate."
"Take care of it how?"
Dean's heart stopped for a second because he thought Cas meant his funny comment but felt relief after Cas asked, how he could get rid of the erection.  "Cas", Dean finally turned around to look at his friend, who had a very confused look on his face. And multiple wounds from the hunt but nothing too serious, "you are as old as dirt and you don't know how to handle a fucking boner?"
One thing was a pair of small, white wings that were connected to an elastic band. The other thing was an Alice band with two wires that hold a fluffy, yellow halo above it.
"Doing so good, angel", Dean commented, voice lower and rougher than before, Cas whimpered at the new pet name, "wanting to please me so much and doing it so well. Such a good boy for me."
"S-So is it over now?", Cas asked nervous, gripping his blanket. Dean looked at him again and nodded, "yes it is. I'm sorry for putting you into this."
Maybe it wasn't a killer. Or it was a very seductive killer. He wasn't so sure right now.
"Here", Dean placed both his hands on Cas' ass and pushed Cas closer -of course not before squeezing it a bit just for fun-. "Now, you can- you know-" Dean was cut off as Cas already understood and rolled his hips forward so that their crotches collided. "Oh", Cas gasped and did it again, this time faster and harder, Dean had to bit his lip.
"Use it?", Cas repeated curious, "for what?"
"Cas", Dean sighed, "I told you enough times already. Me saying things like 'cute' don't mean that I don't acknowledge your powers. I know you are badass and that has nothing to do with me saying you are cute."
"You-", Dean stopped and closed his eyes as he fully understood Cas' words, "you were trying to get me off?! While I was asleep?! Dude, that's way too weird even for you."
Dean wanted to kiss him so badly.
"Dean?", came a quiet whisper from Cas after some time. "Yes?", Dean answered in the same tone, smiling down on him. Cas gulped and licked his dry lips, nuzzling deeper into Dean's warmth, "what happened?"
"Can we get to the sexual intercourse now?"
"We just got caught up talking and the heater was still on", Dean lied and wiped the steam off with his hand so he could at least see something through the front window. "Course", Sam muttered a bit too fast and looked behind him to Cas who just finished fixing his tie but still looked absent and overwhelmed.
His free hand reached for Cas' cheek and cupped it carefully, turning his head more into his direction so that their noses were almost touching themselves.
Cas knew they didn't have the normal kind of relationship but he was glad about every secret little kiss he got. He read a few books about relationships and how to take the next steps but the most tips didn't really worked out. Like showing up with a bouquet of flowers while Sam and Dean were currently captured (which Cas wasn't aware of to his Defense) by some very confused vampires. Or the one time he called Dean 'sweetheart' in front of Bobby and Sam which caused Dean to choke on his beer and constant teasing from the other two.
"So... Cassie?", Dean asked as they were alone in the motel room while Sam spent the night in the Impala at the victims house to make sure they were safe.
Cas went back to work as soon as Dean let him go again and his stiff neck payed off when he felt Dean's realise dripping from the corner off his mouth. He swallowed his come and tried to lick the remains off around his lips since he couldn't clean himself right now.
Dean seemed to be satisfied with his reaction and went back to his bag. Cas just stood in the middle of his living room and didn't know what to do.
Cas slightly shook his head.
Dean continued to stroke trough Cas' dark hair and watched the boy for a moment before looking around again and finding a specific thing laying on his dresser.
A gang member that will stop when Cas said so? That wants Cas to thank him if he'll be punished?
Dean never saw Cas' blue eyes open so widely -and never realised just how pretty they were when he didn't squint them so much-, they stared at each other, mouth open in shock, even Sam was speechless. The hand stayed in Cas' hair because Dean was thrown off so much, he had never heard such a noise from the angel and the reddish tone on his cheeks definitely said that it wasn't from pain.
"That really sucks, man", Dean answered honest, looking down on him worried. That's when he noticed the small branch in Cas' hair, so he decided to pull it out, but it seemed to be stuck so Dean used one hand to hold his head in place, clenching into Cas' hair to finally get the branch out with the other one.
"I want to get rid of it."
"Dean, I can't", Cas looked down to his fingered, his voice full of sadness. Dean gulped, his throat still burning from the alcohol, "you never want to stay."
"So what would you describe as a convenient time any place?"
"Dean I killed most of the vampires, can't you just appreciate that?!", Cas huffed and pushed the taller man off him. "Sure, next time I'll appreciate it after I burn your dead body!", Dean growled back, gripping the collar of his coat. "Dean, you're overreacting!", Cas huffed and grabbed his wrists.
"Y-yes, yes", Cas cleared his throat and fumbled with his keys until he finally could open the door before some of his neighbours could see them.
The room felt quiet again besides Sam's nosy snoring that Dean didn't even notice before. Dean was thinking about just turning around and getting some sleep but Cas still looked at him intensely.
He was really glad that he had put the good ones on this morning and not the yellow one with bees on it that were just so damn comfy.
Showing anger was just way easier than showing affection.
The third time was just a drunken mistake, really.
"More?", Dean teased him, "want to get your ass spanked more?" Cas shook his head wildly and pushed his hips forward, "m-more pleasure, S-Sir please."
Cas started to moan louder again, so Dean started kissing him again, letting his tongue drive into Cas' warm mouth. He only got a suppressed whine, then a bite on his lips before Cas came all over Dean's boxer. "Fuck, Cas", Dean groaned, held Cas' hips and rutted against him till he came with a silent moan.
"Yes, Dean?"
"Cas you are too loud", Dean hissed at the angel, reminding him of the poor third person in the room. "I-I apologise", Cas whimpered, Dean had to keep it together at the breaking voice of his friend, "I'm not used to these sensations and it is quite demanding to stay quiet."
"Now?!"
"That's the best I have felt in a long time", Cas confessed breathless from laughing after a few minutes, "the war really gets to me. I never wanted to fight my own brothers and sisters."
"I do", Cas answered so sincere, it flustered Dean a bit. "Shut up and let me sleep", Dean muttered and closed his eyes.
The angel looked over to Dean, then back to the Tv and back to Dean again, "but the documentary-", Cas pointed out, sounding seriously offended, "it's about bees and how the threatened environment affects them."
"Don't do this", Cas just huffed, avoiding Dean's gaze, clearly embarrassed. It was so weird seeing Cas so affected by such a simple thing as hair pulling. Maybe it was because Jimmy/his vessel was sensitive about it. Or maybe Cas was just more kinky than Dean would have thought.
"So it's not a mistake", the man interrupted him and walked past Castiel to put his bag on the couch, "my name is Dean", he finally introduced himself and Cas' gaze flickered down when the man loosened the tie, "but you are supposed to call me either sir or master", Dean said calmly and completely serious while opening his bag.
Dean smiled at him again and it made Cas feel proud which was so bizarre and insane but Dean looked so warmly and pleased, Cas just shivered, his dick twitching.
"That's good", Dean moaned, squeezing Cas' butt just because he could and helped a bit to lift him off his lap, "you should do that more often, Cassie, but I can't look at you like that."
"You are so on edge, brother", Gabe sighed, "you so need to get laid. And you should stop being such a people pleaser. Be egoistic for once man."
Cas had to close his eyes and calm down a bit because he was so not into thinking right now and damn Dean for making him think in this situation right now. "I uh...", Cas stuttered  for a moment, Dean waited patiently for him, "to thank you?"
"Oh yeah", Dean was reminded of the sexy costume the angel was wearing, "no problem, I had a position in mind already", he reassured him and moved Cas around like a prop before he lay down on his back with Cas straddling his hips.
"Jesus Cas, you need to learn better dirty talk", Dean chuckled, licked over Cas' bottom lip, his hands still on Cas' butt, kinda directing the pressure, "but yeah, me too, Cas."
Dean hummed again, Cas really started to like that sound, and when he looked up again he saw that Dean had his head pulled back a bit and eyes closed pleasantly. Feeling motivated due to the sight Cas kissed and licked more enthusiastic, opened his mouth wider and enjoying the sounds he could get out of the man.
The pleasure increased and so did the heat. His thoughts began to fade, completely submitting to the scenario around him, submitting to Dean and his actions.
Cas licked his lips and looked up, leaned into the warmth of Dean's hand while looking at the man, "sh-shaky", he answered honest, "but-but good. Feeling good." His eyes fell down to Dean's obvious tent in his suit pants.
Dean grabbed both of them suddenly and turned Cas around, his chest pressed against the wall. Cas gasped as he collided with it and turned his head to the side so his nose wouldn't be squeezed in.
His boxers were slowly pulled off his, the cold breeze hitting his hardened dick. "Such a pretty cock too", Dean praised him, thumb rolling over his tip, "so desperate to come, am I right?" Cas nodded so hard he felt his head spin but he still held his body as still as possible, just taking what was given to him.
"Cas-", Dean said, gripped the angel's hair and tugged on it roughly so Cas had to look at him. To everyone's surprise, Cas' reaction was instant. He let out a deep and loud moan, everyone went silent.
"What?", Dean breathed out, "you wanna have sex with me? That's what the whole 'I'll touch you while you sleep' thing was about?" Cas nodded, "you pulled at my hair a few times and because it's a gesture of pleasure I thought you were initiating sexual intercourse but I didn't know what you would consider as pleasure so I decided to investigate a bit."
"I... have no fucking idea", Dean muttered, the sound repeated itself in his head for the rest of the night.
"Dean, I'm in the middle of a war!", Cas repeated for the millionth time already, Sam sighed loudly, "I can't leave whenever I want."
"Are you sure that you want me to come in your mouth?", Dean asked clearly. Cas tried to nod as best as he could and hummed shortly. God yes Cas wanted nothing more than that and he might actually scream if Dean wouldn't give him that in the next five seconds.
"Off?", Dean asked gulping and walked over to the bed, "I... you know- I thought that you could wear them throughout the sex."
"You know what?!", appeared Gabriel's voice from outside, "you are drowning your daddy issues in work! Anna and Balthazar think so too!"
Both breathed heavy and just lay in each other's arms there for a good amount of minutes.
"God, you're such an idiot", Dean couldn't contain his smile, the weight on his shoulders finally gone, his angel still there. "I know", Cas whispered back with an amused undertone and a slight grin on the lips, "I read that an outburst of emotions can end up in lust."
"When I say 'come', I mean 'come to me right now', do you understand that?", Dean explained harshly, Cas nodded, the air pushed out of his lungs. "I understand sir", he squeaked, couldn't keep his eyes off of Dean's.
Dean nibbled at the flushed skin, "was gonna keep you tied up and blindfold you. Just concentrating on me. Completely at my mercy and taking everything I would give you. But you are still doing that, huh? Just taking everything from me without questioning?"
Without thinking Cas leaned forward and pressed his warm, wet lips against Dean's crotch. He immediately felt Dean's hand gripping his hair tightly but not pulling him away so he decided to continue and lick over the clothed boner.
A very handsome, tall person in a black suit and a bag in one hand. The man turned around when he heard Castiel approaching him and looked looked him up and down calculating before nodding slightly. "You are late."
Dean motions at the wonky scarf, the mismatched yarn, and the rough edges. “Well, clearly I can’t. You made it look a lot easier than it is. I watched hours of tutorial videos online, but it’s just so damn complicated.”
Cas pauses for a moment before the combination of Dean’s smile of reassurance and the impatient grumbles of their fellow travelers convinces him to go on ahead. Dean watches him walk through the ominous looking metal detector with ease and begin gathering their items on the other side.
Cas blinks several times in quick succession, like he’s remembering where he is, and glances down at the scarf. “Dean. I didn’t know you could crochet.”
Dean looks up from the research he’s been unsuccessfully trying to focus on for over an hour to find Cas standing by his side. He’s holding a small brown parcel in his hands and his eyes are firmly glued to the floor of the bunker.
The thought makes Dean’s feet move a little faster.
“I thought you’d never ask,” he says, his hand still laced through Dean’s, warm and soft.
“For me?” he hears himself mumble. “I don’t understand.”
“Cas? Do you like it?” Dean’s unsteady voice asks.
He holds onto this feeling as Dean starts the engine and the hills outside start to pass once more before them.
Dean shakes his head as he tries to find the words. But how can he? How can he explain the way he feels now as the pain drains away from him in ways so real, he can practically see them?
Behind him, Dean notes the filthy looks being thrown his way as people nudge past him with their elbows. Cas seems completely oblivious as he watches him intently. “I’m fine, Cas. Now, would you sit down before somebody tries to kill you.” Cas peers at him in confusion but stows their luggage overhead and flops down into the seat beside Dean, his hand finding Dean’s knee and, causing a ridiculous blush of red to creep into his cheeks. He doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to that, the easy contact he spent years craving.
“No, I didn’t mean-”
“I think this might be the best birthday I’ve ever had.”
“No.” And maybe Cas is just worn out from this whole trip, but the answer seems to come a beat too quickly. “How about at the same time?”
“I don’t know. Do you want me to?”
All Dean can do is nod as he tries to drag his focus back to Cas’ eyes. Which honestly, is no less distracting.
She opens the door and nudges him gently on to the street. “You don’t have a choice. Now get going, I’m sure you’re missing him already. And anyway, I have to get home before my own love starts to worry.” She winks at him and shuts the door in his face. Dean stands with bewilderment in one hand and a beautiful bouquet in the other as she clicks the lock and disappears from sight.
“Why?”
Cas has literally held Dean’s hand throughout the entire flight, which meant he had to eat one handed, not that he minded. In the aisle seat, Harold is just regaining consciousness. He looks as Cas in the middle seat before looking down at himself now sitting in the aisle seat. “How did I-?”
Cas smiles at him, sunshine and blue eyes. “I know.”
Cas watches curiously as he digs out a tiny blue giftbox from his jacket pocket, a red satin ribbon tied neatly around it. “Ah, the ribbon got a little crumpled, but here,” he shoves the box hastily into Cas’ hands “this is for you.”
A drive sounds so unbelievably good right now that he almost hears himself say yes. But no, he’s not backing out of this. Dean smiles at Cas and takes a deep breath. "No, I can do this. I've fought things that would make most people run screaming for the hills, I can handle an airplane."
A note of curiosity creeps into Dean’s voice “Yeah?”
“Is there an echo in here? Yes, dumbass, for you. I made it for you. For today. Now, will you just open it already?”
Ah, row 29, finally. His eyes flick down to the row of seats but they’re already full. The three adults seated there stare up at him, their eyes glassy and blinking. For a second, he almost wishes there was a demon on this plane, for the simple possibility that it might inject a bit of life into these weary looking souls. An image of the plane speeding towards the earth flashes through his mind and yeah, no, he definitely doesn’t want a demon on this plane right now.
Dean grins and flips the parcel back to the less Frankenstein-esque side. “Better?”
Almost.
“Because I’m right!” Dean can feel his blood racing through his veins, hot and dangerous. He knows he needs to pull back, needs to leave the room and cool off, but the hammering inside his head won’t let him. He needs to win this fight. He needs Cas to understand. “Because you just do whatever you want and the hell with everyone else!” His eyes flick across the room, looking for something to destroy, something to break. “Because you’re a selfish dick!” A glass he doesn’t remember picking up smashes to the floor between them, the shards scattering like diamonds.
Cas scratches his chin and actually manages to look embarrassed. It’s a look that Dean finds horribly endearing. “I, uh, wanted to ask if you would like to go for a walk with me.”
“Socks,” he eventually hears his voice croak out.
Cas tilts his head in consideration, and Dean knows he's only doing it because he finds it so endearing. And damn, it really is endearing. "I suppose it is. Just a couple of old creatures, forgetting stuff." He leans forward to press a kiss to Dean's temple that makes him go weak at the knees, and Dean wonders for the millionth time when he let himself get so damn sappy.
The words visibly throw Dean for a moment, just as Cas knew they would. He watches fondly as a tint of red creeps up Dean’s neck and his eyes flicker to the floor. He shuffles on the spot and wipes his hand across his mouth in a futile attempt to hide the smile tugging at the corner of his lips.  “This is serious, Cas. Listen up”
“Uh, yeah, a little.”
“I meant it.”
“Well, to myself, I guess. But it helped me, just a tiny bit. Just saying your name. I know it’s dumb, but it felt like an anchor, a weak one, but something. And I needed that, to stop me from slipping under completely.”
Cas manages to tear his gaze away from the floor he seems so fascinated by to look at Dean and, damn, is that nervousness in his eyes?
He’s with Dean.
“Yeah, everything’s fine,” he assures him. “We’re about to head back.”
“Fine! Have it your way, but don’t say I didn’t warn you!” He lets go of Cas’ wrist abruptly and jerks his shirt up to his neck. A blast of cool air hits his exposed skin and his wound simultaneously, making him winch.
“To me?”
“Can I help you with something, sir?”
“Can you- can you check the wound?”
“You said you would switch with me.” Cas offers with a smile.
Cas sighs and reaches for the pile of wool. From it he manages to untangle a blanket, thick, and large, and expertly constructed. “It’s a work in progress.” He swallows. “It’s for you.”
Dean steps forward, the door clicking closed softly behind him. Locked in now. Entombed. A second ticks by. Then another. The smell of the interior begins to inch up his nostrils, clawing along his throat, and making his head feel muzzy. It's sweet and strong and it seems to grow in strength with every passing second.
Something stupid, and brave, and dangerous, and terrifying. He put himself in harms way. He got stabbed. He almost died. He healed himself. He didn’t die. He lived. He’s alive. But it doesn’t matter because Dean can’t seem to stop yelling at him about it.
Today is one hell of a day for maybes.
“Dean, please, tell me why you’re crying,” Cas asks, his voice thick with worry.
Always & forever.
Cas blinks away the tears welling in his eyes and hugs Dean even tighter. Time begins to stretch on but he doesn’t want to let go.
“Crocheting?” Dean asks, trying and failing to keep the grin from his face.
Cas takes a step closer but his hands remain firmly attached to the little parcel. “I just- I know it’s not very aesthetically pleasing. The tape kept rolling away from me and I couldn’t seem to cut the paper evenly. Angels can do a great many things, but wrapping gifts is apparently not one of them.”
It’s 8am, forever 8am, as Dean shuffles down the aisle, his arms pushed to the front of his body as his duffel bag knocks continuously against his knees. Geez, could they make this thing any narrower? He tries to remember his seat number. Was it row 28 or 29? He cranes his head to look at Cas for confirmation but he’s been sequestered by an elderly lady with enough luggage for the entire plane. With his help, she’s trying to miraculously make all of it fit into the tiny overhead compartment. His eyes flick to Dean but are drawn back by the woman pushing more luggage into his arms and gesturing like an eccentric conductor. Dean can’t help but smile to himself. Hey, no better guy to ask.
Cas’ smiles at him softly and a part of Dean wants to shut himself closed like a clam. A part of him wants to jump back from this cusp of honesty he’s teetering on. But he can’t, not now. This is important. “So, this one night I was drunk and stumbling around some city. I don’t even remember which one. And I was talking to you, or myself, whoever. But I came across this tattoo parlor, a real seedy looking place, and I felt drawn to it. So, I went in.”
The woman regards him for a moment longer before deciding to trust him with her own name. "I'm Agatha."
“I, uh, thought we could try listening to pop for a change. I know how much you like it. I tried to pick songs I’ve heard you humming around the bunker.”
It terrifies him.
“Wait.”
Cas folds down the corner of his newspaper to peer at Dean standing in front of the stone fireplace, a beam of sunlight slanting across his features. Cas lets his eyes trace the spatter of freckles lit up across his nose as a familiar wave of affection washes over him. “What is it, my love?”
“Dammit, Cas! Why are you being to difficult about this?” He listens for footsteps, hoping Sam will round the corner and intervene. Praying that he does.
“Yeah, you wish for something and then blow out the candles.” Cas looks perplexed but Dean just shrugs at him. “It’s just how birthday cakes work.”
Cas raises his eyebrows in surprise, opening his mouth to speak before Dean cuts him off. “I’m not blaming you, Cas, of course I’m not. But you always get ripped away. Every single time. So, I kept it. To remind me that we don’t have forever. We only have right now. And it’s fleeting.”
Dean nods and shuffles back towards Cas.
It takes every ounce of Dean’s strength not to laugh at the grim expression on Cas’ face. Only he could imbue something so ordinary with the seriousness of a heavenly mission. “I used to wrap gifts in newspaper, Cas, it’s fine.” He reaches forward and gently removes the gift from Cas’ reluctant hands.
A prickle of anger starts to ignite in Dean like a lit match as he reaches an obvious conclusion. Cas isn’t going to let this go, because when has he ever made things easy for Dean? This is Castiel, angel of the lord; the most caring being he’s ever met, and by far the most stubborn.
Cas shoots him an acidic look and Dean absolutely loves him for it. “Yes, Dean?”
“Geez, it’s nice to see you too.”
It’s 5pm and Dean’s watch is ticking again.
“No, you go ahead. I’ll be through in a minute.”
“A walk?” Another thump to his beating heart.
Names are good. Names build trust. Maybe he can still salvage this.
Agatha steps from behind the counter and gently loops her arm through his. The tenderness of the gesture only makes Dean’s smile grow wider. “I think I might have a few suggestions.” She leads him towards one of the many shelves packed into the cramped shop. Every shade, size, and scent of flower Dean can imagine sit in wait before him.
Dean smiles fondly but when he looks at the page again Cas notices that his hands are shaking. “Number four. I hate how close we live to the farmer’s market because whenever you go there alone, a part of me believes that you won’t come back. I have this horrible voice in my head that tells me that this is all too good to be true, that I don’t deserve it, and that tomorrow I’ll wake up without you.” A small sniff escapes Dean and Cas has to curl his fingers around his seat to stop himself from rushing over and planting gentle kisses all over his face. His own heart his thumping so loudly in his chest he’s almost sure Dean can hear it and he can feel the tears still lingering at the back of his lids. Dean sniffs again but keeps his eyes on the paper fluttering between his fingertips as he continues.
“Um, this is for you.”
Dean stills, an unreadable expression flickering across his face and Cas’ hand still held in his. “You could never be a burden on me, Cas. I love-” He hesitates. “I love having you around. That’s never gonna change, angel or not.”
Dean tries to focus but finds his eyes flicking downwards. He’s never been able to stop himself from doing that, even before he was able to admit how badly he wanted to feel those lips against his. How Cas never clocked him is, honestly, a complete mystery. A smile creeps across Cas’ face and into his eyes as he lets go of Dean’s chin. “Earth to Dean, try and focus.” Dean feels himself smiling in return and for a moment he forgets where he is. It feels like it’s just him and Cas. The only two people, well not people, but the only two beings in the entire universe. It’s a feeling that should scare him, the whole world disappearing and shrinking around him, but he feels perfectly blissful in this breathless void. Those blue eyes become the sky and the ocean, the sea and the earth, the beginning and the end and everything in between. In an unimportant corner of his brain, he knows that he’s staring silently at Cas as Cas stares back. Just two weird peas in a pod. That’s actually something else they used to do. Something that Sam recently admitted drives him completely crazy.
The stranger squints at his words and it reminds him of Cas in an instant. The thought sends a wave of butterflies flitting through his uneasy stomach.
“Sit down,” Cas orders gruffly as he releases his hold on Dean’s arm.
“Good.”
Why does he have to stare at Dean so earnestly? And is it warm in here or is it just Dean’s face? “Yeah, uh, you made a blanket, I made a scarf. Gift exchange. It might not look like much but it’ll keep you warm. Not that you ever really get cold, but still. Just in case.” Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Cas recrosses his legs and glances at the night sky again. “It’s late. You should get some sleep.”
“For me?
She shrugs but uncrosses her arms. "I don't work here." Dean raises a questioning brow. "I own the place. Have for the past twenty years."
blanket. As in, the blanket belonging to us.” He throws his hands out, gesturing to the sheer quantity of material. “Look how big it is! You could fit three of me in here.”
He takes another deep breath and starts towards the entrance, Cas close behind him. He reaches the glass door and pulls. It doesn’t move. He tries again. Still nothing. Cas reaches an arm over his shoulder and give the door a gentle push. It swings open easily. “It’s a push door, Dean.”
Dean blinks and drags his mind back to the flower shop. Back to the present. “Yeah, I’m fine. That rose just reminded me of something. I used to let all these perfect moments pass me by. I’m just- I’m glad that there were still some left when I finally pulled my head out of my ass.” He gestures at the floral setting surrounding them. “I never would’ve come to a place like this before. Hell, I almost made a run for it a few times today. But here I am, ripping my skin open like a jackass so I can buy flowers for the love of my life.” Agatha smiles and it feels like he’s receiving absolution. For reasons he can’t explain he wants to tell her everything about Cas, about their story. He wants to tell the world. “I’m just glad I finally found my voice, y’know?”
Cas peers at him, eyebrows drawn together in confusion. “Dean, I need to look at the wound.”
She reaches for a handful of fiery red flowers from a shelf to their right. “Well, I think some of these geraniums would be lovely. They represent friendship and they smell divine! Plus, the dried leaves can be used to make herbal tea!”
“If we end up on a desert island, that woman has enough supplies for at least a millennium.” Cas appears at the mouth of the row of seats, stretching his arms in the air and providing Dean with a flash of pale skin beneath his Hawaiian shirt. “I didn’t even believe this was possible, but I think I hurt my back.”
“Great.” She grabs two more handfuls of flowers, one blue and one white, from a nearby stand and holds them under Dean’s nose. “Periwinkle and tulip, what do you think?”
He looks towards the source of the voice. Behind a low counter opposite him stands an elderly woman with wild tendrils of silver hair and ruby lipstick painted on as thick and as dark as blood. She’s wearing a mustard yellow floral dress, and a cardigan so horrifically pink that Dean can already feel the headache it’s causing. A frown pulls at her thinly penciled eyebrows as she regards him curiously, waiting for a response.
Dean looks over to where Cas is standing by the entrance doors, exasperated and painfully beautiful in his floral blue shirt and shorts, sunglasses pushed back into his fluffy hair.
The woman’s smile tightens. “Sir, I have to insist.”
Before she can finish, Dean grabs a single white rose from a nearby display, catching his finger on a thorn in the process. “Shit.” He pushes his scarlet thumb to his lips as a pinprick of blood pools there.
A smile Dean wishes he could trap in a bottle for rainy days lights up his angel’s face as he turns to look at him. “I’ve never had a birthday before.”
“Hey there! Are you wearing a belt by any chance?”
Dean peers at the page opened before him on the oak countertop. “Three cups of flour? That seems like a lot.” He shrugs to himself as he opens the cupboard door and begins rummaging around among the novelty egg cups and mismatched plates. He lines up three cups in front of him, each one displaying a slogan or picture from a different tourist trap him and Cas have visited in the past six month. “I wonder if it matters that they’re different sizes?”
He’s considering getting a sandwich to go with that milk when something wraps around his ankle, almost pulling him to the floor. He jumps back, yanking a knife from the waistband of his pajama pants. He blinks rapidly, peering at the source of the attack. There’s something on the floor. Something long and slender, like a tendril. Stooping, he cautiously pokes at it with his knife and breathes a sigh of relief. Not a tendril. He chuckles to himself softly; glad nobody was here to witness that. It’s just a thread of yarn. Bright yellow. But why is it here? Curiosity now perched on his shoulder, and milk forgotten, Dean follows the trail like it’s the yellow brick road. It seems to keep going forever and ever until, abruptly, it stops. He looks up from the yarn trapped beneath a closed door to find himself standing outside the door of the DeanCave. He pushes it open curiously and can’t help but do a double take at what he sees inside.
“I’m not naked, man.”
Everyday.
Dean seems to final solace in his gaze as he takes a final shaky breath before continuing. “I hate that when I come through that door, I can’t call you Mr. Winchester.” Dean’s voice cracks on the final words, their departure long overdue but painful nonetheless. “I want to be with you, Cas, forever. I want-”. He pauses again. “I want to marry you.” He swallows visibly but forces himself to keep his eyes locked on Cas. “You’re the one thing I want. The only thing I’ve ever really wanted for myself. And look, if you don’t want that too-” but Dean’s words are cut short by Cas launching himself at Dean so abruptly that he causes his head to thump gently against the fireplace.
“What? Uh, yeah. All sorted.”
“Did that hurt?”
“Dean, what are you doing?”
Dean chuckles. “See, this is why I love you.”
Dean feels panic begin to mount inside him as a million lame excuses zip through his head. He tries for cocky “At least buy a guy a drink first.” Cas rolls his eyes and starts to pull his hand free of Dean’s grip as another wave of panic gushes through him. “Just let Sam do it.”
Untying the apron from around his waist, Dean gingerly lifts the weighty cake and makes his way unsteadily to the living room. Cas is stretched out on the couch, a blanket over his legs and a nature documentary on the television. He sits bolt upright when he sees Dean wobbling towards him and a look of confusion crosses his face as his eyes dart to the sliver of kitchen visible over Dean’s shoulder. “Dean, what’s going on? And what have you done to our kitchen?”
Dean leans back in his chair and pushes the hefty book away from him, relieved to have a distraction. He looks at Cas curiously, feeling a smile tug at the corner of his mouth “What, you mean like a gift? You know it’s not my birthday, right?”
“Wait, don’t tell me. Carnations, right?”
“Horse-a ponytail? Really? Oh man!” Another bought of laughter erupts from the other side and the awkward presence dissolves like ice cubes in front of a roaring fire. Cas smiles and lets his stomach perform its usual somersaults, knowing he could happily live in that sound forever.
Dean’s mouth drops open. He’s knows it’s rude but he can’t seem to help it. He always has this same, ridiculous reaction. “Wait...so you’re...”
Dean looks at the paper in his hand and feels like an idiot. Of course.
His eyes snap back to her. “Sorry, I wasn’t talking to you.” He reaches over and tugs the plastic blind up again. “Sorry about that.”
Cas nods.
He leans forward and smells them both in turn. “Wow, yeah, put them both in as well.”
“Cas, I know that, it’s just-”
Cas drops his hand and Dean misses it the second it’s gone. “You regret it.”
Dean nods and he can’t keep the smile from his face. Damn, Cas is adorable. “Yeah, buddy. I would love to go for a walk with you. But first, close your eyes.”
Cas peers at him. “You never told me that.”
This is the beginning.
He looks out the window again, watching the luggage being loaded onto the plane with an alarming lack of care. He’s suddenly glad that their items are all carry on, although he still feels a bit uneasy travelling without weapons. Cas assured him that he would protect him from any danger that might occur on this beach getaway, and honestly, who better for the job than him?
The TSA agent reaches him, a middle-aged man with shocking red hair and a clownish grin to match. Disconcerting, to say the least.
A red flush creeps across Dean’s face as Cas removes his hand and he can only pray that the dim lighting hides it. He clears his throat conspicuously and gestures at the yellow mound. “Uh, what are you making?”
“I’ll always remember that,” Cas answers sincerely, his eyes finding Dean’s in the quiet closeness of the impala. Right now, at the side of this road, without another vehicle in sight, it feels like the two of them are the only creatures in the entire universe.
He raises the flowers to his nose and breathes them in. A smiles flashes easily across his face as he turns towards home. Cas is gonna love them.
A smile pulls at the corner of Cas’ mouth as he remembers a movie he watched with Dean about teenagers who did the exact same thing. “At the same time?” But, weren’t those teenagers in love?
“Can you stop holding hands in my lap now?” Harold demands. Dean loosens his seatbelt with his free hand and leans forward so he can see Cas. He smiles at him and nods once. Cas smiles back and leans towards Harold, tapping his forehead with two fingers before Harold has time to begin to wonder what’s happening. His head rolls back against the headrest and Dean can’t help but laugh as Cas grins back at him.
Cas grins at him and leans towards the cake. As he does, his knee catches on the table, causing it to jolt upwards sharply. A second of frozen terror passes between them as the cake begins to fall apart, it’s layers no longer able to retain their structure as one level and then another slides across the table in comical succession. Some of them reach the end of the table and flop onto the floor, the icing working like a Slip N Slide for Dean’s creation. Cas lifts his hands to his mouth as the disaster unfolds before them. “Dean, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean-”
He said it.
So, he doesn’t.
“Dean, would you just let me take one of the bags? That’s the third near collision you’ve caused and we’ve only been here for five minutes.”
His tone snakes under Dean’s skin as he observes Harold’s extremely punchable face. “Look, can you stop being an asshat for two seconds? A seat is a seat.”
“So, tell me about the cardigan. How nerdy did he look?”
In the silence of the impala and the warmth of his arms, that’s all that he needs.
“Bye.”
Dean smiles again and gestures to his own vacation duds. "Absolutely. We've already got these hideous matching Hawaiian shirts; it would be a shame to waste them."
“That’s what I thought!” Dean sits back against the couch cushions, pulling Cas with him and looping his arm around his neck. He kisses the top of his head, feeling not for the first time like the luckiest man on earth. “Happy birthday, Cas.”
“Not too late to switch seats pal” Dean shoots back as he retreats to his side of the row.
“No, that’s not what I meant.” Dean tries desperately to unscramble his thoughts, but it’s incredibly difficult when the Pacific Ocean is staring back at you. “When you died...when Lucifer killed you, I was in a dark place.”
A moment that seems to last for eternity follows, before Agatha’s face cracks into a wide, genuine smile. She rests her hand lightly on Dean's arm. "Oh dear, why didn't you just ask me that at the beginning? I thought you were trying to rob the place or something."
“I saved your life, Dean! Why are you acting like such an ass about it?”
“Well then, it was a success. Besides, I’m honestly not sure how good it would have tasted anyway. The measurements were way off. They had me using three cups for the flour alone.”
“For today?”
“I just- you’ve helped me so much since I fell. And I don’t want to be a burden on you, Dean.”
“Are you alright, dear?”
Dean runs an arm over his eyes, ignoring the strangers staring as they walk past. “I know, Cas. I’ve always known that. I think it’s just taking my mind a second to catch up.” He sits up and gestures at the waves crashing gently against the shore as he intertwines his hand in Cas’. “We’re actually here, angel. Toes in the sand, matching Hawaiian shirts, I even saw a stand selling cocktails in coconut shells. We actually did it.” The words catch in his throat as another wash of tears threatens to unleash itself.
An image of Dean feeding the chickens and chatting to them earnestly flashes across Cas’ mind. “They are very good listeners”.
“Uh sorry,” he mumbles “is this row 29?” One of the humans' nods but says nothing. Dean can feel a prickle of sweat on his brow as a youthful elbow connects again with his back. “Yeah, hang on a second!” He puts the duffel bag down, its moment of contact with the aisle floor coinciding perfectly with a dramatic sigh from his new enemy. He reaches into his jean pocket and digs out his ticket, scanning it for his row number. “Ah, row 30. I was close.” He flashes a smile to his captive audience who nod blankly in return as he moves on to row 30. Home sweet home. He shoves the duffel in the overhead compartment and squeezes into the row, placing his hands on his knees and trying to relax. Where the hell is Cas? He could really use that dorky dude right now. He glances out the tiny window and feels a drop in the pit of his stomach. They’re already such a long way off the ground and they haven’t even taken off yet.
Cas squints at him suspiciously but sighs and lets his eyes slide closed. And maybe Dean stares at him like this for a little too long, and maybe his eyes flicker down to Cas’ lips, perpetually chapped and slightly parted. And maybe he even wonders what those lips would feel like pressed against his. But then again, who’s to say?
Dean stops his frantic pacing, and turns to Cas, his anger locking on to the angel like a missile. “Those risks aren’t for you to take, Cas!” His voice is loud and cruel, a reflection of his father’s. The thought makes him sick. The thought makes him furious. He needs to make Cas listen. He needs to make Cas understand. “You were wrong to put yourself in danger like that and you were selfish to risk your life. Stop being so pigheaded and just admit it!”
The overhead speaker crackles on and Dean jumps in surprise, causing Harold to roll his eyes as he clicks on his seatbelt with ease. The captain runs through the flight path, the weather, and the onboard menu before handing the speaker over to the cabin crew who begin to run through the safety precautions. One of them positions herself at the end of their row and demonstrates the correct way to put on an oxygen mask and lifejacket. Dean can feel his heart beating faster as panic starts to build once more in his stomach. The thought of needing either of those items terrifies him. As if sensing this, Cas turns to him, concern etched into his face. “Dean.”
Cas considers this for a moment before turning to Dean again and looping their hands together. He stares at him with an intensity that makes Dean’s heart feel like it might hop out of his chest and run away at any moment. “I wish for this.”
A stutter of his heart. Home.
Dean’s stomach drops at the assumption. He knows that he should correct her but the words feel like they’re lodged in his throat. Sharp. Painful. Important. “She’s- I mean, they-.” He takes a shaky breath. “Cas is everything. He is everything.” Relief, and fear mingle together as the words leave his mouth. He feels ridiculous for caring about the opinions of a stranger but he can’t help the heat rising in his cheeks or the way his eyes want to slide to the floor.
For a second Cas doesn’t answer. For a second, he can’t. There are things he wants to say to Dean. There are things he wants Dean to say to him. Maybe if he just? No. Never mind. He can’t do that.
Dean ignores him and keeps singing until he reaches the final words which he sings with as much passion as he can muster while still cautiously inching his way closer with his rickety masterpiece. He places it on the coffee table with gentle gusto and sits beside Cas, a wolfish grin on his face. The cake sways before them, the structure of its ridiculous number of layers struggling under the weight of the batter. Dean looks at Cas who seems utterly mesmerised by the cake before him. “Well, whadda ya think?”
“We’re gonna watch a movie in our new blanket. Take it for a spin.”
Dean lets out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. "I don't think there's enough money in floristry for that."
Cas shrugs and leans back into the couch. “It gets boring. There’s only so many reality television shows with emotionally constipated individuals I can handle. Tell them you love them or move on; I don’t understand how that could possibly take ten episodes and twelve breakdowns.”
Cas frowns “I should have measured you first.”
"Questions? About what?"
Cas says something in response but his words tangle themselves together until Dean can’t understand a single one. He looks at him hesitantly but Cas is smiling at him with so much love and understanding that he feels blinded by it.
Screw it, Dean thinks. It’s now or never.
“Trust me.”
Shit, Dean thinks. Did he forget to unpack all of his weapons before they left the house? He can see by the look in Cas’ eyes that he’s thinking the same thing.
Dean shrugs and swallows past the dryness in his throat. “Oh, you know, ” he gestures vaguely to their surroundings, trying desperately to control the sweat he knows is glistening on his forehead "just a few questions about this place."
“Alright, you’re good to go!” Steve announces abruptly, a forty watt smile still plastered across his face.
“You what?”
Dean chuckles softly as he surveys the evidence of his disastrous attempt at baking.
It’s not a question.
Cas hesitates for a second before walking over and sitting on the end of the bed. He’s as far away from Dean as he can possible be, without actually sitting on the floor. Dean sighs and pulls his arms out from beneath the duvet. “Cas, I don’t have x-ray vision.” He pats the spot on the bed beside him and tries to ignore the butterflies skimming along his skin. “Come over here.”
And then he opens his eyes, and gets ready for the drive back, and hopes that one day he might be brave enough to make that wish come true.
“Just shut up.” Dean mutters through his teeth as the plane dips again and his hand tightens in Cas’. Good thing Cas is superhuman, he thinks to himself. His death grip would probably break a normal person's hand. They stay like that for what seems like an eternity, Dean counting slowly backwards from ten and concentrating on Cas rubbing methodical circles on the back of his hand and speaking words of comfort he can’t quite hear over the roar of the engines. Eventually the plane levels out as they reach cruising altitude and Dean feels his heartbeat begin to slow again.
Perhaps he could have chalked it up to his long-seated skepticism about falling in love with a stranger, except that referring to Hannah as such now, even in his own head, felt wildly insulting. So then, why had he felt no inclination to pursue her in the ways a lover might?
“Yeah, we’ll be there in a few hours. Okay…okay, got it. You too; bye.”
he thought grouchily as he burrowed into bed,
A sinking feeling settled in the pit of his stomach. Gabriel must have sensed his apprehension, because his next words came out quickly, pleadingly.
Castiel brought his hand up to his own mouth where he pressed the flat of his tongue against his palm, wetting it so that when he took hold of himself once more the slide was slicker.
“What’s—“ he paused to clear his throat, and tried again. “What’s wrong with your wings?”
Abruptly, her eyes widened and she sat up, forcing Castiel to step back lest their foreheads collide. Princess Hannah laughed breathily, watching as she wiggled her fingers and smoothed her palms over her own frock and the velvet bedspread.
“We’ll extend an invitation to the ceremony,” Castiel said, decisively, “If you give me a list of everyone you or Dean might like to have present, I’ll see to it myself.”
“Hey Cas, got a second?”
Gabriel stumbled on the last stair, eyes wide.
The metal was cold but the shame that accompanied it burned over Castiel like fire. Humiliation and regret made him grind his teeth so hard his jaw began to ache. Some rescuer he was; unable to protect the Princess from even a single blackguard and therefore perfectly deserving of what was surely his imminent demise.
Missouri had passed away a few years after his father.
Castiel looked like he wasn’t sure if he could believe it. Dean tried again.
Dean was, like everyone else, under the assumption that he and Hannah were terribly in love; Hannah had not relayed any of their conversation to him.
Maybe if he were still an angel, he could have helped Sam resist Lucifer. Maybe if he were still an angel, he could give Dean a fighting chance against facing Lucifer in Sam’s body. He could heal the wounded, gather supplies more quickly, scout, and just generally do so much more to help Dean than he was able to do now. Maybe if he were still an angel, still useful, Dean wouldn’t have turned from him.
His gaze did not go unnoticed by the shifter, who brought a hand to his face to feel the damage. There was really no need; his hands were peeling too. He heaved an annoyed sigh at his own physiology, and addressed Castiel again, holding out his hand as evidence.
The thing that irritated him most, Dean had decided, was that Castiel wasn’t acting any differently towards
“Castiel, you’ve already met Dean, of course,” Hannah said as she approached him again, this time with Dean in tow. “We grew up together; even as a boy, he was overprotective. You must be well-versed with a sword, to have bested him.”
“Anything I want. Anything that’ll fetch a pretty penny.” His smile became a devious smirk. “Sometimes, if someone pisses me off, I’ll steal from them just to be a jerk; those kinds of people have it coming.”
“The Djinn manifestation of me stated that your feelings were not reciprocated, but—”
Castiel watched them now, but did not appear before them. From a distance, he saw Amara’s gentle fingertips brush the back of Dean’s hand, saw Dean’s hand turn to cup hers. She spoke to him and he turned to face her— turning his head first, then his shoulders, hips and feet last; even this insignificant movement Castiel could recite in his mind’s eye—and Dean brought his palm to her cheek and bent close, pressing their foreheads together.
Castiel brought one over and watched as the cue ball sent everything else sliding around the table. Dean considered the resulting layout for a moment before taking aim and sinking two solid colored balls in one shot.
“Magnificent,” Castiel said, voice slightly muffled around a second bite, “These make me very happy.”
Anna watched calmly from the edge of the room, out of the doctor’s way and not obscuring the present family’s view. She was young; most prophets did not become active until they were at least well into their second century. But after the untimely death of her predecessor, she had taken up the mantle after little more than eight and a half decades. Despite her youth this was not her first birth, and the mother’s howls of agony did not startle her as they had the first time she heard them.
The punched-out groan had heat rushing to his cheeks because it was one he’d heard through thin motel walls when Dean was being intimate with someone. When his vision cleared, the sight before him was equal parts confusing and very,
A low, sleepy
“Whenever I think of home, I wonder if I miss things because I truly miss them, or because I long for an idealized, distantly remembered version,” she elaborated. “I went to sleep a child and woke up ten years later a woman. Looking at myself in the mirror, seeing someone who is recognizable in many ways but wholly unfamiliar in many others, is still a little jarring. I’m reminded then more than ever that the world carried on while I slept.”
very glad you shared that with me. I’ve been feeling so guilty—” His voice cracked and to his surprise, he found his own eyes stinging; a result of the incredible pressure he had placed upon himself, unaware of its immensity. He turned his face into Hannah’s warm hair as a tear fell, clinging to her tightly. “—wondering whether all the stories are just horribly exaggerated, wondering if I had done something wrong, because I…”
There was no point trying to placate him; Dean had been inside other people’s Djinn hallucinations and therefore knew quite well that Castiel had seen everything Dean had. Before Castiel could think of anything useful to say, Dean rose and in three stiff, punctuated strides was tugging open his door harshly and disappearing around the corner.
Hunts never went exactly according to plan. “Extremely fuck-up-able,” Dean had declared them once.
His hand came up to the top of Castiel’s shoulder again and repeated the motion, his other hand coming up to do the same on the other side. For a few minutes they stayed that way, Dean lazily petting Castiel’s body and Castiel indulging in the physical contact, wondering which part of this training exercise was meant to be difficult.
All his life, he had relied on the old stories, passed down through generations, that spoke of the unity between then eastern and western kingdoms and how it had been sustained. Castiel accepted them as unerring recounts of the divinely chosen path his ancestors had journeyed down in an unbroken cycle of seeking a sleeping lover, waking them, and releasing their combined grace back unto the creators. It must be true because it
He was not even remotely ashamed of the growls and whimpers that spilled from him when Dean’s weight suddenly disappeared, leaving him open and unsatisfied.
When at last they reached the top of the steps, Dean set his torch in the empty bracket beside an unassuming wooden door. He produced a key from another pouch hidden in the folds of his clothes and inserted it slowly, reverently. The wards clanged dully as the key was turned, and then the door creaked as it was pushed open.
Castiel exhaled roughly at the first glide of his hand over his swollen cock, his head tipping back against the tree as his eyes fluttered shut. This time, when his lust-addled mind offered the vivid recollection of Dean’s naked form, he accepted it greedily.
It was done.
Cas had only ever revealed his wings—sort of—at the peak of battle, the great shadowy outlines arching away from him in a threatening display of dominance and aggression. It didn’t surprise Dean that other creatures turned tail at the sight of them. But this was different; the shadows behind Cas kept coming in and out of focus, sometimes clear enough to make out a few of the outermost primary feathers, and other times mostly resembling transparent amorphous blobs that shifted around as he moved.
He sighed. Thinking of the dose of medicine tucked away in his jacket pocket back in the office, he reached one hesitant hand out towards the cat, nerves on high alert in case he needed to make a hasty retreat from scratching claws or chomping teeth.
—gently, unaware of his audience, "I'm a little late tonight, but who's hungry?"
Castiel took stock of himself for the first time and was surprised to find that his cock ached between his legs, fully erect and rubbing into soft covers that offered no real friction. He longed to cant his hips backward against Dean’s fingers but wasn’t sure if the motion would earn him relief or another slap.
Even so, it had been years since Dean had stood across from the cold, calculating version of Castiel in that barn. So much time spent with the Winchesters had made Cas malleable, each new human experience molding him (usually for the better) away from his original staunch loyalty to his orders or mission. And of course, Castiel
Again the prophecy soured unexpectedly, unsettling Anna and causing her to stop short. But just as suddenly, it had subsided. She frowned, forgetting that the family could see her face. No one spoke, for interrupting a prophet was unheard of, but the silence became tense.
On shaky legs, Castiel moved closer to the foot of the bed, unable to look away as his counterpart spread Dean’s cheeks and gave a wide lick across his hole, followed by a series of teasing flicks with the tip of his tongue.
“Friends, families, people of the western kingdom, I welcome you.” Her voice was pretty and lyrical as it poured over the now silent crowd. “It is truly a heartwarming thing, these opportunities we get to recognize a divinely chosen pair. As legend tells, we celebrate the union of this pair by joining grace from each person. This is a sacred act, one that signifies not just the union of these two people, but also the continued unity between our vast kingdoms.”
"Why don't you eat?" Dean asked. The cat, of course, did not reply. "Do you really just not like this kind of tuna? What a choosy beggar."
,” Dean whispered reverently, runnnig his hand through Castiel’s hair before cupping his cheek, “I’ve never known anyone to react so strongly.”
When Castiel didn’t answer him immediately, the shifter held his flashlight up so that is shined directly into Castiel’s face, causing spots to burst into his vision and his head to throb. He squinted in an attempt to make out the shifter beyond the light.
Castiel opened sleepy eyes to study Dean’s profile. The candle had long since burned out, leaving only the moon as a source of light. In that brief moment, as he stroked the pad of his thumb along the freckles that dotted Dean’s cheek, it occurred to him how miserably this entire scenario could have played out. In a different life, in some other universe, a version of him was aching and miserable, longing to feel what he felt now. Loving. Loved. His eyes burned suddenly at the thought, but he blinked the wetness away.
Dean’s skin felt so
He’d give this up—the drugs, the women, everything—if Dean asked him to. Dean never did.
less adventurous than any of the old fairy tales made it out to be.
“The stories might be wrong,” he rushed, urging Hannah out of her room with a gentle tug on her wrist. Although clearly a little alarmed and confused by his outburst, she followed him easily.
The doctor smiled, and just like that everything intimidating about him dissolved away. Dean always found it a fascinating transition to watch.
A cat crouched low to the ground, tucked partway behind a stray glass
“Good, isn’t it?”
“What?” In four steps, both Sam and Castiel were on either side of the bed.
"Right," Dean agreed, for lack of anything more meaningful to say.
, he'd think now and again, but next week would come and with it a new set of highs and lows, and the thought would slip from his mind as effortlessly as it had materialized.
Cas’ brow furrowed, and he looked confused. “You…think she should have taken the effort to kill me?”
Sam watched anxiously as Jack’s hand passed over the length of Dean’s torso and back again. “Anything?” he asked, but Jack shook his head regretfully.
He found Dean’s eyes. “Yes.”
However, the reason for his distraction was fresh enough in his mind to give him pause. Hannah would know nothing of Castiel’s experience at the oasis, of course, but the knowledge that he had been lusting after another—Hannah’s
“Look,” he said finally, forcing his vocal cords into action, “I don’t know what I did to piss you off so bad Cas, but can you just be straight with me? Sammy’s right, we can’t go after the Darkness with our—“ his mind flailed about for the right words, and he made a vague gesture with his hands, “team dynamic, or whatever, all out of whack.”
“Perhaps I should learn to make it,” Castiel said as Dean tore off a bit of dough and flattened it into a vaguely triangular shape on the counter, “So that I can make it for her someday.”
Dean gasped and growled, pounding fast and hard into Castiel until his knot finally caught. Castiel hissed as Dean pulsed and throbbed inside him, spilling warm and sticky. Dean kept his hips rocking upwards through his orgasm and then Castiel was coming with a shout, painting pearly white streaks across Dean’s heaving chest.
After a moment he pulled back slightly, resting his forehead against Princess Hannah’s and wondering what was meant to happen next. Before enough time could pass for him to grow worried, Castiel felt her breathing change as she stirred, returning to consciousness at long last. In an effort to avoid startling her he put more space between them, watching dark eyelashes flutter briefly.
For the rest of eternity, Castiel wept and ached for his righteous man. He would give up his wings, his grace, his angel blade, anything at all to be with Dean again, but the profound bond was no more.
A choked gasp left one of them once Dean was fully seated inside him, and Castiel circled his hips against the sizeable intrusion, appreciating the stretch and press of Dean’s thick cock. Dean pulled his hips back and pushed in again, slow and methodical. Castiel grit his teeth against the covers, irritated.
“I will craft a soul to match hers!” Darkness exclaimed, desperate to prevent Light from snatching away the King and Queen’s newly bestowed joy, “Do not strike her down. Let her sleep while I work; when her complement is ready, I will send them to find her and rouse her from slumber.”
"Hey, Dr. Novak." he replied, feeling his reflexive customer service smile relax into something more genuine, "The usual?"
“Castiel will be a playful and curious child, excited about the world around him,” she relayed to the family. There were murmurs of approval before she continued.
“Do you suppose the creators made a mistake?” he asked jovially, reaching into his breast pocket to fish out an embroidered handkerchief, which he offered to Hannah. He was likely meant to feel much more sullen at that thought.
He should have asked for a specific number. What constituted "a few" anyway?
He cared for Hannah deeply, he knew, but he did not yearn for her the way he might have expected to, given that they were a divine match, and the knowledge left him feeling underwhelmed and disheartened.
“It’s not—” It came out as a croak. Dean cleared his throat and tried again. “I don’t want to...to
It took some getting used to, but over the next few weeks, Cas’ wings became a familiar presence. They usually didn’t directly get in the way of anything; most of the time the shadowy outlines fell straight through anything they touched. Despite this, sometimes Cas’ wings would cast shadows over a pot or book, or a stack of loose papers, and Dean would jolt as if to catch the falling object that wasn’t actually falling.
.” The last word was said slowly, deliberately, and the meaning behind it was obvious. Castiel finally met the shifter’s gaze, ready with a withering response, but his words died on his tongue. He hadn’t realized how…difficult wasn’t the right word, it wasn’t difficult because he knew with absolute certainty that he was looking at a shifter. But seeing Dean Winchester’s eyes peering back at him, hearing Dean’s voice fall from Dean’s mouth, having Dean this unusually close to him felt surreal.
“Yeah, but I mean,” Sam gestured vaguely, “usually people give us
“Besides,” Dean added, winking easily at Castiel over the top of Hannah’s head, “someone should really teach your Prince to use a sword properly.”
it, man. You pulled me from Hell, you pieced my sorry ass back together so many times even though I didn’t deserve it, how could you think you’re expendable? All the times I’ve thought you were dead, it
Damn Gabriel and his stupid soft spot.
Naomi looked to her, and the rest of the family followed her gaze. Those in Anna’s path shuffled to make room for her as she approached the mother and child, reaching out to take him carefully from Naomi. There was silence in the room now, expectant and anxious, as Anna looked into the baby’s face for the first time.
“Then stop waiting,” he growled back, delighting at the way Dean’s nails dug harshly into his skin when he pressed back against his cock.
At lunch, High Priestess Rowena ran through the proceedings with them, showing them where they were to move and when, and giving them a brief overview of what would be said.
The voice was grating. To his left, a lanky man with grease-slicked hair and a slimy grin offered him a large, unlabeled binder. Dean cleared his throat to dispel the biting laugh that threatened to escape him; something about the juxtaposition of the employee’s stark white gloves at an event so crass was truly hilarious.
The lunch rush was finishing up, judging by the slightly chaotic state of their workstation and the flushed but relieved look on his temp worker's face.
bested
“Dean—”
Briefly he looked up, intending to ask Dean for privacy, only to find that Dean had already respectfully faced away. Placated, he returned his attention to the sleeping princess.
His voice had risen with each word, and he was near yelling by the time he was done. Castiel glared back at him, and his wings, which were becoming more and more visible, snapped about sharply behind him.
you.”
She wrinkled her nose good-naturedly. “I am Princess to nearly everyone,” she said, pushing the canopy aside and stepping properly into the room. “To you, I would very much like to just be Hannah.”
Game #1: How many references to canon sooperboop can you spot in this story? Several times, both my beta and artist commended me for a cool bit of symbolism or a meaningful nod to something in canon. I find this all very hilarious because I am fairly bad at literary analysis and did only about 20% of these things on purpose. So, please help me find all my easter eggs! I have no idea how many I dropped! Most of what you find will be news to me!
“Bullshit,” Dean retorted. “Look, I don’t know what’s going on, but it’s clearly wearing you down. And that’s concerning because angels aren’t
Within forty-eight hours, Simba—so named by Gabriel—had not only proven that absolutely no surface was safe from cat hair, but that Dean's efforts to keep him off the furniture were cute at best.
That said, he also liked the current atmosphere very much. There was something meditative about the kitchen so early in the morning, when the only sounds were his own footsteps as he went from the prep table to the fridge and back again and the
This particular tree’s twisting, low branches often served visitors well as a sort of vantage point to look out at the view, and that appeared to be Dean’s intention now. Cautiously, he navigated himself along the trunk, stopping at the furthest point that would reliably hold his weight. Another branch crossed in front of him—more spindly but still reasonably substantial as a support hold—and he wrapped his hand around it lowering himself down to the wood. Now that he was seated, his support landed conveniently at chest height; he crossed his arms and let them rest on this second branch.
But Dean’s eyes were blank, and the only words that came out were “Lucifer is riding around in my brother’s meat suit, Cas. What do you want me to say?”
suitable?
Hannah walked between the tables of a classroom, correcting students’ stirring techniques here and there, and helping one young man contain his overflowing cauldron.
“Besides,” she said lightly, “what are your crowns good for, if not suggesting a change in tradition now and again?”
Castiel, eyes wide, blood burning with anticipatory arousal, could only nod.
Castiel had, in fact. He swallowed. “Did I pass?”
Only once Hannah had been safely escorted back to her room did Castiel allow himself to press close against Dean and let his hands wander freely. One palm smoothed around from Dean’s waist to the dip of his lower back, cataloguing the roughness of his outermost layer of clothing; the other came up to trace along the cold metal of the familiar chainmail that hung halfway down his chest.
“Feel free to rest anywhere you please. The back of the cave is the least windiest, though.”
“Omega, what kind of beast do you take me for?”
It was the most comfortable he'd felt in days, and despite his instincts screaming at him not to, his eyelids shut once again as he let his body be overcome with sleep.
