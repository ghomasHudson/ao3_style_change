Tony: Also, not right now. Gotta go.

Tony: I was pretty flabbergasted to realize it, but it's true, and what can you do.
And yet, he was making an effort, Tony had to admit that. Cap was trying to be nicer to him; Tony should probably try back, he thought guiltily.
For a moment, Tony drummed his fingers on the bed next to the book. A coldness sneaked into Steve's stomach, settled.
This earned him more laughter, but of a brighter, more heartfelt variant.
What did he mean it like?
I had to rein my emotions in, somehow.
Tony: Yeah.
He didn't even

It took them nine whole days to find Steve, wet and shivering from being repeatedly dunked into a freezing stream. His ropes were cruelly tight and he was pretty badly beaten too. The Pengwernian raiders had been after information, it seemed, and had no idea who they had actually laid their hands on. Needless to say, Steve had told them nothing. And paid for it.
"Good," she said. And, "Is it worth creating yet another timeline, though? What you mean to do?"
But we also reconnected with our friends, many of whom had drifted apart, wrapped in their own, individual cocoons of grief.

What I'm trying to say is, when it exploded, it really exploded. We'd been together for a few months already – seven, to be precise. I don't know why I'm even pretending I don't remember the exact dates; that day turned out to be quite memorable. Ridiculously enough, I can't for the life of me remember what the fight was about. I'm pretty sure it was benign enough to begin with, and then it just escalated. It lasted for hours. Everything, everything was coming out. We screamed, literally screamed  into each other's faces. There were occasional lulls, and then we would start shouting again. We went from room to room yelling at each other on top of our voices. I was about to start punching walls. Tony was shaking from rage. And, hours later, as the fight was finally beginning to peter out, what was left in its wake was coldness in my stomach. I was at the point when you have to fight to keep yourself angry, because that's easier than actually having to think:
– later, but Steve thinks she can tell everything there is to tell.
Tony: With Bruce gone, and all of you gone, I'm pretty much the resident expert on this. And, technically speaking, I'm now the head of the nonexistent superhero force in the U. S. And thus, Ross now kind of falls under my jurisdiction, by right, or as good as.
It sounds to easy.
"Cap?" he said. His voice was choked with – he realized – pure, undistilled hope that had suddenly surfaced from the emotional mess roiling in his guts. Because together they could maybe figure something out, if only... And then the dread was back again. "Are you real?" he asked; it rang stupidly in his own ears.
Tony: Because when I say shitty things to you, with your probable depression, I go wondering what's going on, what's going through your head afterwards.
Two steps towards Steve, like in a  haze. The coldness in the pit of his stomach and the scorching need in his cock finally met, and mixed, and the results were... interesting. He felt his eyes finally drawn to Steve’s, fixed on them. The passionate, stubborn intensity of Steve’s gaze couldn’t be replicated, no matter how much Tony started at the photos sometimes. His eyes were boring into Tony’s, face still frowning as he tried to get a read on him. Steve’s breathing was audible, or perhaps Tony’s mind was zeroing in on anything of Steve’s.
"How can I thank you for the ride?" Steve asked, seemingly reluctant to touch the door, as if the door-handle would burn him, as if that act would disperse the last of the magic. Or... no. That was all in Tony's head
"Now it's not fun any more," Tony grumbled. "Oh, all right, just go ahead then. Not as if you can do anything about it. No, wait, I want to sit down first."
Nerves and anger... That was a lethal combo for him. A highly volatile chemical compound.
Steve snatched a canapé like he would a lifebelt, and sighed.
"Well." She pursed her lips. "Not before we win."
Tony: See, I can hear the lack of judgment in your voice as you type that.
Upon startling awake, the feeling of frustrated longing, of angry melancholy, still permeated every organic cell, every plastic molecule in Tony's chest.
“Hello,” Tony managed. His own voice sounded coldly irrelevant to him. The lying bastard of a voice.
"You know what?" Tony finally stood still and spoke up. Steve raised his eyes in inquiry.
"Blood pressure dropping," Friday informed him. At the same time Steve took a long breath – so okay, thank god, at least he didn't drop dead on Tony, which wasn't unknown to happen after a rescue from ice water. But: "I detect faint arrhythmia, boss."
Tony: The battle between you and me, I mean.
in this situation.
What about Rhodey, what about the authorities –
"I'd like that," Steve said, just as softly, but his stance wasn't changing, he wasn't relaxing. Which – understandable, Tony thought, but he nevertheless felt a trickle of sadness in his heart. He wanted Steve to trust him. He wanted Steve to trust him unreasonably, inexplicably, completely, even though he didn't know Tony and even though Tony had been lying to him, or at least concealing the truth. "I know all about waiting too long. Trust me," Steve added.
Tony had no idea where he was going with this. Still, the only way was forward.
Tony: Would you?
There was nothing Tony wouldn't have done for Morgan, especially because it was Christmas and also her birthday. This was doubly so this year, while she was still struggling to understand the practical meaning of divorce. She was supposed to stay with him on Christmas Eve, and then, come Christmas Day cum her birthday (she dubbed it 'birthmas'), they would join Pepper in the city, and all three of them would go and eat horrible food that Morgan picked and then they would visit a theme park. Morgan still had to decide which one it would be; she kept changing  her preferences daily. Hell, Tony would have
It's stupid to have your heart beat like that in your chest, isn't it? He drummed his fingers against his suited thigh and tried for casualness. He failed even before he began, because Steve was so blue eyed, and somehow the mouse-gray top flattered his complexion even though it would have made anyone else look drab, and because, when he reached Tony, Steve stood for a moment, obviously at a loss for what to say. That was just too much. His obvious chagrin was too precious. Tony had a ridiculous urge to touch his fingertips to Steve's cheek. Just that.
Tony: No, Rhodey's here, I'm really okay.
knights. "I could teach you sometime, if you like," she said sweetly.
"The temptation is real," he'd told his reflection in the mirror as he watched it shave a few stray hairs from his left cheek. Then he proceeded to try and pick a T-shirt to wear, which helped him kill 45 minutes. It was a black one. Really, he could say nothing else about it.
"We should get back inside," Steve said crisply, and just like that, he seemed to relax. His whole body changed. And something sharp that had been there disappeared from his face, his eyes.
Then he raises his right forefinger, showing it to Steve.
, but he really, really didn't want to. It felt so good to finally

be on crack.
Tony meets Steve's eyes, apologizing silently in advance. More pretending. He should have thought better about this beforehand, but needling Steve had seemed like such fun at the time.
“No, but you seemed...” Steve thought for a moment, as if every word mattered. (It did.) “You seemed so
Tony: And for fuck's sake, use a condom.
do. Who knows what I might try."
At this, Steve turns his head and looks up. Looks back down. Says nothing.
Tony: Pep's tough.
"Crap. Fitz?"
The corridor was indeed blocked, a little way in. The equipment lockers along the bulkheads had broken open. Crates had floated from a side storage area and then crashed onto what used to be the ceiling and was now the floor. It was lucky, Tony thought, that the gravitational field from the deck above was weakened considerably, or else all this equipment would be ruined. Still, the field was still strong enough to cause some considerable smashing, and the grav-strips turning off and on and off again had made the stuff bounce around, which hadn't improved the situation in the least.
"Not... exactly," Steve said, and Tony tried not to let his heart sink, because it had been a stupid notion, of course it hadn't been like that, not with everything that had happened between them. But: "I got some anonymous info," Steve went on, seriously, earnestly. "I analyzed it, picked it apart. Found some contacts. Found more info." He snorted. "I knew it could be a trap, but I thought I was being so smart."
Tony: But we’re talking now. We're better now. We'll sort it out, yeah?
He wasn’t sure how to deal with this either – how were they supposed to behave now, what were they to each other, what were the rules? (
"If you think he's worth considering, I'll consider him " Steve said slowly, as if it pained him. "Sir."
"Yeah, we're collecting info," Tony told him. "That could all be the drugs at work. What made you think they gave you a serum suppressant?”
to. You can't stop either.
to the full G. Like in slow motion. But it  must have happened lightning fast, because the red hot signal barely had the time to reach Tony's brain and already it was over, and Cap was drawing back.
Steve gives him a slow, steady look. "I don't want a safeword."
(he had always been  prone to swagger and bravado, really); but Steve had insisted they should continue king Arthur's legacy, and a well-known and well-honored name should be the first step. The two of them had gone on arguing about it and yelling at each other even though they basically agreed, until Thor came up with the compromise.
This made Tony peculiarly affronted for some reason. “Aw, come on. I don’t know when anyone’s birthdays are, and even if I do, I can never remember to even send an e-mail. I can’t remember to tell Friday to remind me. I never know what’s going on in anyone’s head. I don’t know what people
He'd considered going down to meet Steve – to be completely honest, he'd considered standing by the main gate of the Compound since 5 in the morning. That would be the time he'd woken up, had he actually slept; he suspected that the short, tossy, turny experience should probably be called something else and not sleep. Besides, eagerness was one thing. Doing a Pluto the Dog impersonation by the gate was quite another.
a chance to back out if he wants? Or did they misunderstand each other, back in the elevator? True, not much was said, but...
letting this shit ruin surfing for me.”
Captain let the towel fall to the floor with a tiny splash, then looked at Tony and sighed. "At ease," he said.
, really?"
Natasha placed a hand on her friend's shoulder-plate, silently telling him to calm down. It would do no one any good to have a hysteria-afflicted Avenger causing distress at this time.
The moment of closeness had effectively erased all the thoughts from Tony's head, and now all he was was capable of was a resentful:
Steve is not there when he enters. Tony is assaulted by the sight of Natasha instead; he prefers not to see her, usually, because that way he can pretend he forgot how much he misses her.
Tony: I promise I won't pressure you further.
Tony: I know that too.
And this is how it ends, Tony thinks. In a few hours, Steve leaves for the West Coast. As the leaders of two Avenger groups, they will have to work together; who knows, maybe their little night together and this subsequent talk will help keep their professional relationship on a decent level. Maybe they needed to vent all that UST. Maybe they needed to air out some of their issues too. But now Steve will leave, and Tony will stay, and the world will be grayer for it, just like the skies, and Tony's life will lose yet another bit of warmth and color and...
Tony: Yeah, I know.
Tony: Are you guys safe?
Tony: Steven Strange wanting to mend us
He nodded.
Tony: Listen, the curiosity almost did win.
.” Amidst all the pleasure and happiness, there was too much pain seeping out through Steve’s words. And Tony pressed himself against him, all the way, and held him close, and leaned his head against his. It seemed to help.
Perhaps relentlessness wasn't always a virtue, he figured. Perhaps you
"It's me, buddy," he said as clearly and soothingly as he could. "You fell through the ice on the lake. I found you and brought you back to the cottage. Didn't seem like such a good idea to try and get you to a hospital in this weather..."
, and that wasn't even a complete lie. He
"Steve.
Tony: Look, don't worry about it now. I'll push through. Everyone knows I can't do anything else right, but press conferences, I'm born to do press conferences.
Steve seemed to focus on Tony’s words. “Oh. It passes on its own. I’ve tried a hot water bottle, blankets, things like that, but really, it’s all in my head, it’s nothing to be...”
, the hands on his cock – both gone, and Steve groans in frustration.
"Not terrible," he says, because he doesn't want to be unfriendly, but he'll be damned if he admits he hasn't had so much fun with friends in a very, very long time. "I kind of missed certain aspects of this." He waves his hand vaguely.
Tony: More or less. For the time being. I'll deal on the go. Don't worry.
. "Let's say they never tell each other," Steve goes on, doggedly. "You think that doesn't count? You wouldn't say they love each other?"
"You okay?", Tony whispered again, sliding his fingers in and out, opening him up, not ungentle but hurried. He couldn't help but rub his cock against Steve's ass, craving contact, craving
This wasn't like Rhodey. What did he want, details, ice-cream, sleepovers?
Tony: neocultural sublimation

, the idea of Tony... fooling around, he supposed... with other people... That made his stomach curl into a fist and there was this tightness in his chest he couldn't stand. What was he supposed to do, how did people do this? Was he just old fashioned? No, he wasn't, he was simply wired that way, that was all.
, he told himself. This didn't amount to enough. The evidence was inconclusive, the symptoms, as Bruce would probably put it, still subclinical. He couldn't be sure.
have crazy eyes, stop that already, what's wrong with you?"
"Oh, and here I thought you went hunting for fowl. How disappointing."  Tony took the cup and sniffed. Hummed appreciatively. Took a sip, then another. "Well, this doesn't taste like grass, at least."
"Is this a kidnapping?" Steve asks placidly, and Tony has to resist the urge to stick his tongue out at him. He just snorts instead.
Steve has got the gauntlet, and the world stops. It keeps stopping for him a lot, lately. It barely even manages to move, honestly; it's got no reason to, now.
In any case, it took him a while to get out of the urban areas with no money for transport and no ID. He did it mostly on foot in the end, because hitchhiking left a trail of witnesses behind. That was several months ago.
"It's good to know, you know," he commented after a bite. "That somewhere out there I beat you to it." The show of impudence was barely holding together, but Tony was giving it his best shot. His hand was frantically toying with the salt shaker. Here, his nervous ticks were showing way more; either he didn't care to hide them, or this was all too much for him. It was almost too much for
Sneaking a look over the man's shoulder, Steve spotted Logan, chewing on a cigar, nursing a tumbler of something amber-colored and trying to look as unapproachable as possible. Someone wasn't so good at reading the signs – a person, pushing forcibly in front of the guy, sticking out their hand like a lance.
Tony meets Natasha's eyes as he and Steve break apart. Natasha deadpans. "Whatever," she tells him. "Just don't break Steve."
, was what Tony
generally benign, but occasionally his eyes would glint more keenly and a remark would cut deep. Then he would be back at being his whimsical self, but there was always something sharp and distant about him. Steve couldn't tell what exactly, but it was very much like the way he was in the classroom. One moment he was explaining something patiently and quite kindly, the next he was making wisecracks about 'dumbing things down' on the side.
going to be cold," Tony said, his tone accusatory.
And then Tony is behind him. Several flicks of the flogger at his ass rekindle all the minty warmth from before. The hot tendrils of sensation are humming through him, aiming straight for his hole, hiss cock. Then pommel in the cleft of his ass jerks him from the dreamy state.
), he convinced himself most of it had been in his head. The almost shy words, the sudden smile. Tony had seen what he'd wanted to. Steve was obviously making an effort to push past the awkwardness and be nice, that was all. He was the commanding officer here, it was his place to set this right. Pretend as if nothing had happened. Tony decided that the decent thing to do would be to ease up on him. Ease up with expressionless looks and curt answers. In the end, they were forced to be here, indefinitely, together. They should aim for civility.
Tony: jus thnkgn about it
Steve shrugs. "Honestly? Should have told you long ago."
"I know," he whispers. "I always knew." In any other circumstances, this might have been a happy moment.
“I know you need some time off,” Steve was saying. His eyes had gone soft, as he studied Tony’s face. “I was just...”
me," Tony spoke over him, "that you didn't approve them? Who holds the rights to your merchandise, anyway? Don't tell me it's still SHIELD."
On the third day, Tony found inspiration in Bruce's words from the first morning. He recruited Scott, Luke and Quentin Quint to come with. The idea was to go to the gym for an hour, get really sweaty and gross, then go for a run around the tech deck as a group;
– made things highly bearable on daily basis.
Feeling faintly embarrassed, as if he had been eavesdropping, he tapped Rhodey on the shoulder. A mixture of annoyance and relief crossed Rhodey's face.. "What's up, Cap?"
"You can call me Cap; I don’t mind," Steve said kindly.
Tony: Rogers, are you all right?
"Pretty crazy, yeah," I admitted.
Tony: Well, isn't that just hilarious?
grabbing Steve's upper arm,
Flying economy class is a deeply scandalous experience in itself. The tiny sandwiches are apparently produced from cardboard and glue, but at least there are drinks. Tony decides to make things more fun (for himself) by ordering for Steve before the man manages to open his mouth. "Red wine for me – something romantic, please – and a coffee and a glass of apple juice for the stunner over here." He waves an unconcerned hand in Steve's direction, then he winks at the flight attendant, and in stage whisper he adds: "Lover is lightweight, you see."
"I'm fixing you a sandwich to tie you over until dinner's ready." There it was again, that puddle of warmth, that strange feeling that he could be safe here if he wanted. Not that he normally felt unsafe, which made it all the weirder.
Tony: Well, fuck you, I'm throwing your fucking phone away. I don't need this shit in my life.
Tony: They are not supposed to magically cure you of sadness. They power you up so that you can deal with the root of the problem, among other things. They kick your ass into gear.
"I'd wanted to. I didn't think you'd want to talk to me."
"We never did friend things."
This was when Steve's eyes popped open, his pupils huge, dilated. He looked at Tony without recognition for a second, and it unexpectedly, unjustifiably, broke Tony's heart in ten million little pieces. "Did I crash my plane?" Steve whispered.
happy to see me. I know that. We can work with that. We can build from that.
Tony felt a surge of nervous energy, like a thousand ants advancing up his knees and thighs. He wanted to at least
"That's what I just said," I said.
, with no way to tell them apart. Fresh air stifled him. Hilly horizon made him claustrophobic. He'd left his soul somewhere among the Art Deco skyscrapers and that was that. In the country, Steve felt like an alien, but there wasn't a place Steve
"Rogers."
As if doubting Tony's words, Steve moved to the wall next to him. He
Tony: It's too much, and I don't know how to handle it. I don't want to rain on your parade, honestly, not right now.

Steve smiled and nodded. "I know, I remember," he said. He wasn't looking at Tony as he went on. "You did a lot of saving tonight. It's always been your jam. You just can't resist, eh?"
Tony startled, turned to look at him, gave him a frown. "Why do you ask now?"
Tony: Hellyes, I'm yawning already and we've barely even started.
Tony: The fact that you fucked up doesn't mean you OWE it to me to be a pushover whenever I feel like pushing, for fuck's sake.
"I can't play these games, Nat. I'm no good at this."
"Not that one!" both Valkyrie and Barton crowed shrilly as Banner approached an unoccupied bed. Tony rolled his eyes. They could at least try to think of something else. These people were going to give him a headache, but, if nothing else, they were marginally more lively than all the Daves and Gales.
"No. Never." He didn't. He'd been listening to Tony chatter like a machine for years, and he wanted to listen to him chatter for many years more, and he should say something, shouldn't he? He just needed a moment to compose his thoughts.
"Or," Steve said very matter-of-factly, ignoring the butterflies in his stomach, "we could just read together." He pushed the book to the side so that it was midway between him and Tony.
"I'm not." At his skeptical look, she relents. "Okay, I am. Doesn't mean it's not valid."
," Steve said, and Tony may have been trying to have a semi-serious discussion, but Steve of course had to turn it into banter, damn the man, and he was irresistible while doing it, to booth.
. I just...” He took a sip of his chocolate. It was richer and sweeter than Tony remembered, or his tolerance had dropped with age, but Steve seemed to have absolutely no problem with it. He hummed appreciatively. “So good.” But as Tony still stared at him, he added: “I mean, the roads have probably been cleared by now. Will they... Is it going to be okay? That you invited them over and then blew them off?”
"The journals are yours," Tony said. "Do what you want."
Missed.

Halfheartedly, Tony rolled his eyes.
No one seemed too surprised to see him. No one had the
Tony: No, dummy. It's a game of chess. Come on, indulge me, I'm so bored I might spontaneously break into constituent particles.
Tony: because hell, Steve, with all the dick jokes and all, it was really beginning to feel like you were actually flirting, or flirting back, or whatever.
Tony touched him on the shoulder, just for a second, then let his hand drop. “See anything you like?” he said in a very soft voice, just to say something. Steve actually turned to look at him, which was, yes, a definite improvement.
Tony: You went on the second date?? Like, what, breakfast?
"Would you like me to do it some more?" The query is deceptively mild, but Steve jumps to answer without much thinking, because he doesn't have much thinking left anyway.
"While I'm sure the offer is sweet to the extreme, what the fuck would I do with your socks?"
And Steve put two and two together and remembered Tony's comment about how the ship is a freighter, not any kind of fighting ship, and so he asked:
"I missed Thor," Steve said, and Tony noticed his eyes had gone serious. "I miss..." He trailed off.
They lay like that for a little while, Steve’s head resting on Tony's chest.
And then Tony was there, smiling genially, kissing Sharon on the cheek, chatting politely for a minute. And Steve could do this, he could. They were... Give or take everything else, they were friends, and he couldn't let his unchecked feelings ruin that. But then Tony sneaked a look at him, one of those searing hot looks under his eyelashes. Steve's stomach clenched painfully. The anger surged back, then, because what business did Tony have, looking at him like that. Let him look at Peter Quill like that. (Steve didn't have a problem with Peter, he told himself, repeatedly and not as convincingly as he might have wanted; he had a problem with
"Oh please," Tony shot back. "Look who's talking. Also, if I hadn't gone to find the dog, you'd never have let it go."
"What happened?"
in return.
Coming to think of it, I might look like a crazy assassin, about to pull out a gun and take a shot.
Steve was crap at acting and they both knew it. This was why, as the tray was slid through the kitty door, Tony started yelling and begging
Silence stretched.
In the first row, a cadet improbably named Quentin Quint raised his hand, and Steve pointed at him.
"Well," Tony commented. "There
"Rhodey'll come for you if he gets the message," Steve had said, very reasonably. And yes, yes, of course Rhodey would, but...
BACHMAN: ...so with this I give the floor to Mr. Tony Stark, the CEO of Stark Industries, the most famous weapon and technology company in the U.S. of A., an Avenger, and our own Iron Man. Mr. Stark?
Tony: The asshole never told me they were talking!
Tony: Nope, and he's not going to either. We talked about it a little, in 'ifs' and 'maybes' and 'at some points'.
following the rules, because if he was seen waving them off, everyone was going to wave them off; and the situation they were in, it was in a precarious balance, and sometimes following the rules was what actually kept you human when it would be so easy to break down and become something less than that.
Tony: I know you said you can't talk to anyone.
Tony gave him a sidelong look that lasted for a few seconds too long, then went back to staring through the windshield. "That might have been the core of the problem. But tell me, my dashing highwayman, how did someone so young get so wise?"
She stopped at the door, raised her eyebrow quizzically. "Yes, Steve?" she said sweetly, and he suspected again she was making fun of him. Which was... okay in his book, he didn't mind, really.
Tony: Are you actually trying to stall? Because this is barely the beginning.
"We never were friends," Tony says instead, thoughtfully. "Not really, you know." It comes out wrong. Well, of course it does.
, Tony tells himself firmly.
Rhodey arched an eyebrow. "What's with
“As in, really call? Not just a leave me a voicemail?”
you, you see. I suppose you can consider it a philosophical matter or whatever, but for all intents and purposes, for me – you're you. If we did a DNA check now, it would show it's you." I just sat there, wondering if he were right, but in my heart I felt he wasn't. "And yeah," he went on, "I know our timelines diverged for some reason, but it doesn't necessarily have to have anything to do with something you and I did. Statistically speaking, it probably doesn't. You've probably lived a very similar life to what Steve had here. See, you even had the Civil War – which, by the way, why bring it up now?"
I hummed something noncommittal, but I couldn't stop smiling with my eyes.
Tony: So, she cute?
Cap had expected a nobler motive, perhaps. He frowned, and then nodded.
"Good to hear you're already talking

, he told himself, uselessly.
Tony: I know what you meant.
"I thought," Tony said, "that was painfully obvious by now." And then, just because he suddenly felt like this was too much – what's Steve thinking? Tony couldn't see his face, and it worried him – he added: "You know, I kind of thought you'd be a stuck up asshole."

close to Steve and grabs him by the waist. "Is that so,
Tony: I haven't laughed like this in ages.
"Go back to bed, you two!" someone muttered, and yeah, maybe they weren't being as super quiet as Tony thought.
It's a voice I haven't heard in a very, very long time. Suddenly, I realize I hadn't considered all the implications of alternative timelines, no matter that I've lived in one and then another and should be experienced at this.

That was the second lie, and, as these things happen, not as easily discernible.

Tony: Just organizing the cupboard. You didn't expect me to actually eat that shit, did you?
"So, do we, ah, do we know where he went?"
Tony's voice was muffled over the comm. His constant companion. Steve didn't mind one bit. He was now helping clear the wreckage, carefully, so that the precarious balance wouldn't shift and possible survivors underneath end up crushed. For the tenth time that day, he regretted not bringing more people with him, not calling in the marines, anything. But – the time had been so scarce and they hadn't known what was going on.
Tony: But yes, I guess, with time. He should be able to.
See, there was something they could agree on.
"That's... my shield," Steve says, and then, "...made from styrofoam?" He laughs.
And then there's the cold pressure against his anus again. It's not hesitant this time at all, and Steve gasps sharply as Tony slams his index finger all the way in, filling him. "Back to work," he announces. Steve can feel his prostate ache for contact, thirst for the touch, but the angle is completely wrong. Then Tony pulls the finger almost all the way out, and pushes in again roughly. He sets a pace, not too taxing, but hard – he slams it in and rips it out, missing Steve's prostate on purpose. It burns and it's too much and it's
too much, and then more. And then, on the up-slide, Tony's thumb strokes roughly over the head of Steve's cock, just once, over the most sensitive spot, and at the same time, he presses hard against his prostate with his other hand. The burst of pleasure is so intense Steve sees white for a moment, and he shouts incoherently, and he thinks he's going to come, now, right now, just a...
making? I don't know, and Strange would probably tell me it's for the best that I don't. I sort of agreed to it tacitly when I came here, didn't I? He strongly implied that Tony needed me, and I jumped. I had my misgivings. Still after seeing them spend some time together, today, I'm beginning to think perhaps Strange did it simply for Tony. To comfort him. And if that's the case: hell, I'm game.
Tony: It's five in the morning, your time. What are you doing up?
“What else?”
at what you’re doing, so of course you’re having a good time. Not the same thing as having
"You hurt?" Tony asked before Steve could say anything, because there
"Want to go over the mission details now?" he asks instead. Anything else would be too crazy.
The door opened, the light flooded the chamber for a few seconds, and then it was all gloom again and the bluish flickering of the control panel in front of him. He didn't turn around.
"Well, short of sneaking out with the dirty laundry, I don't see what we can do," Steve said anyway.
Steve. Looking out for Tony, as always. But, then again, Steve was simply like that; he'd try to protect everyone, anyone. That was one of the reasons Tony just couldn't possibly look away whenever he was in the room. That, and the way his hair fell into his eyes; but just a little bit. Really. You'd have to be crazy to think this was about looks.
I found my earliest journal. It was from the time we all lived in the Tower, a bit after the battle of New York. I thumbed through it until I found the first, lovingly detailed sketch of Tony's face. I used to sketch all of my friends, on many occasions, mostly when we were all sitting together. But this one I'd done partly from memory and partly based on a group sketch I'd done earlier. On it, his smile was startling, unguarded, the way it was sometimes in those days. I'd caught the moment perfectly. I always liked that sketch, even though my style has changed considerably over the years, hopefully for the better.
"Paranoid, Natasha," I chide mildly.
Rhodey shoved a hand into his pocket. "Oh, good," he said, and seemed to have forgotten what he was about. Carol sneaked a questioning look at Tony, who shrugged helplessly. Something seemed to be the matter, but it didn't seem particularly serious.
he actually cared, how
"Isn't it just,
The next inescapable question was... "So, echoes of the multiverse or an overactive imagination, what do you think?"
Tony: That's a hard no.
Something crossed my mind, then. Or I can say all the details fell into place.
Tony couldn't smile. It was as if he'd been hit with a spell, his muscles wouldn't obey; and all he could do was stand there with an expression that, at best, looked impassive, and at worst like fear. He felt a stone in his mouth, pressing his tongue down.
hurt, and Steve didn't care. Let it hurt.
STARK: And if the Earth is ever in a global danger again, our present disagreements aside... If Earth is ever endangered again, I promise you we will come together, to your defense, for your protection, and we will do our best, and die if need be, and do whatever is necessary to keep you safe if we can. And it sounds far fetched now, because we are human, we forget. New York was just four years ago. But we forget and we deny, it's... it's how we work, right? Otherwise we'd all go crazy and run for the hills. Never dare to look out the window ever again. I have PTSD, did you know? We try to forget, and we move forward, and we look into the future, and hope. We, as a nation, as a species, we still send probes into space. We still look up and see, not the scary hole in the sky, but a thousand, a million shining stars, and maybe other planets, and maybe other options, a vast, galactic expanse of options; and we still get excited about the future. Why? Because being scared is no fun. Because we need to survive and move on.
Very intensely, Tony didn't want to say it back all of a sudden. Because missing someone was wishing for them to be
He shot a look at Tony, as if expecting a laugh. Tony's eyebrow shot up. "Feel free to refresh my memory, Pete.“
Tony: So, Rhodey just stopped by.
Tony: I think I'm still just really, really angry with you.
want."
"Are you hurt?" he asked.
"Only, we don't know that anyone's coming," Tony had argued, because the thought of cooping themselves up made him feel jittery and he'd almost rather have charged into the enemy with his guns blazing than sat on his ass and waited.
"Synthesize new eyes for me?" The dryness was back in Steve's voice; that was better.
Steve smiled at him. "Sam
He turned the simulator on. Tried to picture what it would feel like to be launched into space and
Steve resigned himself to this, bit by bit. The work on the Accords was limping along somehow (Steve gave his – very thoughtful and careful – suggestions to Clint to pass along to Natasha, who gave them to Tony even before they started the so-called talking). He went for a hearing with the U.N. Some countries abjured his fugitive status, some didn't. Nothing was finished yet, but there was work being done in that department.
The aftermath was a bit of a haze, but the sight of Tony arriving in his oil-smeared suit definitely brightened Steve's day. Tony's hair was in total disarray when he pulled his helmet off. He drew Steve's gaze like a magnet and Steve couldn't stop himself from smiling.
"There's something I can do for you," she said then. "But you will have to do the rest yourself."
"You," I said, because now we were where we were, and I relished in my new freedom to say it aloud. "But I thought you needed space."
, he'd asked the first time this night time conversation took place, and every time after that he enquired:
It's good to have Tony by his side. Suddenly, there is no resounding emptiness inside him, no hollow echo; a part of him had been torn out, and now it's back, and it feels so right that it hurts.
been right in front of that damn window. Which means Steve saved his life. Which is
But it had been over a year since that night, and they'd been too busy or too awkward to do anything but text when they weren't organizing and coordinating. What Steve now wanted, what he craved, was some quiet time with Tony for a change, without a million other people around and a million things that needed doing the-day-before-yesterday-don't-we-have-a-time-machine-yet-dammit. A silly chat, about clothes, about movies, like when they texted, but in person, because to Steve it made a world of difference. Even if Tony didn't see him – he faltered, searching for an expression – in a romantic light, he supposed. Because of course Tony didn't, it was just Steve's wishful thinking. And yet... Did he imagine the hints? Because the what-ifs wouldn't leave him alone and hope was unavoidable. There was nothing he could do about that.
Tony: My what?
Tony: Relax. I can do headaches in my sleep.
He tore his helmet off, tossed it aside. Okay. Easier.
Tony: Only, as a thumbnail it almost looked like...
Tony just sighed in acknowledgement.
Tony: He offered to show me the world; shining, shimmering, splendid.
Tony: I wish I were better at this.
be called; a sadness clawing at his chest from the inside. But that was all the other half consisted off, pretty much.
That Look. Also, a dry comment that still couldn't mask the hurt in Steve's eyes. And then Steve up and left.
Tony raised his gun, and, from too far away, he shot.
It was as if a set of harp strings stretched from Tony’s heart to the tip of his cock, and Steve was playing that harp, perfectly but mercilessly, simply by existing.
the epithets, in his head he'd said:
It was so awkward. Almost as if... but no, that was impossible, Tony thought. Still, his curiosity piqued, Tony found himself unable to peel his gaze away. It didn't have anything to do with how those fair eyelashes rested against those cheeks, although Tony could sure as hell appreciate the esthetics. No, after that one conversation, Tony had gotten that notion out of his head, firmly. He was just curious. He kept glancing at the Captain every ten seconds or so. And Cap – he very pointedly never even looked up. His cheeks seemed faintly flushed.
"Makes you feel helpless," Tony said slowly. "All of a sudden.
, he'd ask then, as per usual, and:
Tony: No, actually no, I really don't. But all the other options were way worse. I literally have no one to put in charge, I have no one who is both capable and, you know, trustworthy. So, yeah, shut up. Knight to c3.
Instead, Steve looked stubborn. "I thought that was why I came here. I thought that was the purpose."
"Okay, but please don't start talking about letting off some steam."
He also thought:
? You need to give me coordinates..."
, Steve." And then he bends his head and takes the tip of Steve's cock into his mouth; gently.
Tony: because, see
Tony: yes

Tony: So, what do you want to do about it?
"Did you..." he began and shut up, because he really had no business asking questions.

Tony: So I'm sending you cereals.
He was hot from standing so close to the fire, sweating uncomfortably. The flames danced  furiously in the fireplace, making shadows cavort around the room, casting Steve's face in unnatural red light, making the angles sharper, making him look older and almost gaunt. The sight nearly broke Tony's heart in an instant somehow. It became clear to him now that Steve had been ruminating on Tony's words all this time, torturing himself. And Tony had... meant them. At that moment in time. For all of five angry, hurt, over-exhausted minutes before he fainted.
Oh, of course Tony had to mess it up royally. And of course he'd made Steve think this was something that it really wasn't.
Tony: Okay, listen.
"You're fucking crazy," Tony bit off, but his voice was hoarser than he'd expected it to be.
Tony: No, please forget I said that.
Rogers looked away. Hurriedly.
He shrugged. "I ended up donating a bunch of money, so we announced that. No biggie."
Tony had said few words; Steve had said fewer.
And then:
Again.
THE END
Steve gave him a sharp look, more focused than anything in the last ten minutes. “Are you crashing down from the stim? Tony?”
Tony is still now, bent over, both palms on Steve's torso, leaning on him slightly. "What if I told you you need to pick a safeword?"
"Yeah, like that." Steve's eyes were used to darkness, and he could see a sketch of a smile on Tony's face; it looked sad, even if Tony didn't sound it.
, Tony had said. Well. Maybe he just wanted to kiss someone – anyone – one last time before he died. Steve had witnessed people do stranger things on the eve of battle.
But Stark, who was sitting right next to Quint, started rolling his eyes practically at the very moment Quint opened his mouth to say 'in order to'. Stark started talking over the kid: "It's designed for both space flight and to be able to withstand various types of atmosphere, that's basic, come
people, all of them. Probably better than me. As people, I mean. I'm just more handsome and charming, so you like me better.
Tony: Is this a close-up of your leg?
"Because... If you'd wanted to, I think you probably could have, in all these months. Or at least you'd have found me. And, anyway, I just don't think you'd do it."
inside him. And the sex had been exactly like that too, thrilling and intense and risky, like Steve had always imagined it would be with Tony.
with Tony and what was the matter with all the mixed signals? He needed his signals seriously straightened out.
"I wish we could still get pissed," Steve sighed, looking at the cocktail waiter somewhat wistfully. "Do you sometimes wish we could get pissed?"
, he thought inconsequentially.
that, you two?"
Tony: You're an idiot.
Tony: What's going on?
"I don't know about you guys," he snapped, "but I'm in no mood for delay. I'm off to find my stupid fucking idiot of a king."
He let me do what I wanted for a few minutes, and then, as if he'd had enough of my fumbling, he pushed me back against a closed door, and proceeded to kiss me thoroughly, now nipping at my lip, now tilting my chin up so he could kiss a trail along my neck. I just closed my eyes and let him. Fireworks in my chest. Mist in my eyes. I'd never been much good with metaphors. But I, inconsequentially, remembered reading a book called
Well, all right, so the chaos part was still true.
Then, on an impulse: "Tony?", he ventured softly.
you. Like getting a truckload of something dumped right on top of you; well, of course you couldn't breathe like that.
"You're staring."
Tony: No.
So, why does that feeling taste of pickles and betrayal?
"Oh no you don't," Tony said sharply. "Keep your eyes open." Steve complies, to find the slits of the helmet staring directly at his face for a second.
And hearing that from Peter Quill, whom he'd spent half the night resenting – it changed something. Steve opened his mouth. Closed it. In the end, all he could think to say was: "You think?"
Tony: So what did you say?
our past, to build our future on. Let a part of us remember what happened, and how, and who were the
“I...” he swallowed. “Up there on the trail.” He made himself look directly at Steve. “I got scared.” It was nothing, really. Just cutting his gut open and spilling the contents onto the wooden table between them. Anyone could do it.
He himself made an honest effort with his disguise. Then he asked Rhodey what he thought about it.
In the labyrinth of corridors, they managed to avoid the pursuit for a little while, and they barricaded themselves in a room. Tony had enough ammo to load two of his semi-automatics. That wasn't going to last him very long.
In the middle of the road, in between the two extremes, lay honesty, undistilled and unspiced with sarcasm, and more naked than Tony was comfortable with. So he rushed to get it over with.
Tony, still in his suit, grabbed him before he fell to the floor. "Friday," he snapped, snatching up Steve's bare hand – he'd lost his glove in the water. "Life functions!"
Natasha let the air out of her lungs with a huff. "You're messing with my counting," she said. "And aren't you always the one going on about the pilots presenting a united front? Was I at 15?"
Tony: No. Forget I asked. I didn't just ask you that.
Steve obeys, shuddering, blushing, and Tony starts pumping it lightly. Just an inch in, just an inch out. It's not even especially uncomfortable, except perhaps for the woven leather of the handle dragging across Steve's lips with a bit of roughness. But the fact that Tony is fucking his mouth with a handle of a flogger makes his cheeks redden, his cock twitch. The sudden coldness on the tip of his cock means precum is trickling out, and his insides contract with a mixture of shame and pleasure at the thought of how incredibly turned on he is by this.
"That's Stephán," Steve says, "actually."
Still, at the sound of gunshot, Steve was already diving behind a barrel, and the man on his knees missed as well.
Tony: you can probably find all of the drawings online, in a higher resolution
a planet, really. The desert itself was huge, to start with, let alone everything else. But, if you traveled through
Tony: Never mind.
Tony: The drinking?
As Tony broke into a run, his bare feet thumped against the floor in the rhythm of
"All right, true, but do you want it?"
Tony: So, what's she like?
"I..." Tony started; stopped. "They probably changed the design over the years. I don't want to..." He trailed off, made an abortive gesture with one hand, as if imploring Steve to get what he wasn't going to say.
"What I
"What?" Steve asked. He must have felt Tony stir and stir again.
Tony: And – yeah, see, you're interested already – and, in any case, I'm standing here and I'm thinking how much you would love it, and really, you gotta see this.
Tony: By which I mean cutting off gangrenous parts while you still can, the way I was given to understand.
Also, sorry about that."
else, Tony would have ascribed this to the darkness around them. But this was Steve fucking Rogers, and thanks to the serum, he had not only superhearing and a wide array of other goodies, but also a type of dark vision. Tony had always been a bit envious of that. Now the memory just made him feel worse.
Tony was distantly aware of Hammer finally moving away with the rest of the techs, but Tony didn't pay him any mind now; he lowered himself back onto the gurney next to Steve – a spot he felt he'd deserved – and watched the medic put the dressing on the wound. Some kind of clear, plasticky material clung to Steve's arm like a medusa and shaped itself around it until it practically became a part of it.
"I just wanted you
"Why d'you want to get rid of it?" I ask him, and that elicits a small smile from him.
Tony: Rhodey's walking so well, now. If you don't know the prosthetics are there, they're practically invisible.
Tony: I was actually wondering about depression and enhancement. How you have way higher pain threshold than a regular person, which is, I suspect, due to some sort of serotonin inhibition process. Which then factors in with your depression (low levels of serotonin, I mean, or a lack of serotonin receptors, whichever; that'll augment depression, basically).
level below ground it turned out leaving the lab techs alive, or at least conscious, had been a mistake. Not that they could have done anything else, really, since cold blooded murder wasn't exactly their style. Tony and Steve had taken and disabled their phones and any other visible ways of communication with the outside world, just like they had done with the goons in the cell, but they must have missed a silent alarm or something like that. Because this many heavies suddenly advancing into the building couldn't have been a coincidence.
"The other Steves and Tonys in the multiverse—" Steve hesitated. "Do you think they have people out there who love them?" And there, normal people could apparently say that word aloud. Well, cheers to them, he supposed. All he could do was plant another little kiss in the corner of Steve's lips.
Tony'd always wanted children. I'm not sure if he even knew it, consciously, before we first visited Clint's farm, that long-ago day in 2015. But I still remember the fierce wistfulness in his eyes. They seemed to say:
that already. He didn't need this asshole towering over him, yelling it into his face.
Tony looked tired and serious all of a sudden and he was in no mood for nonsense.
But today wasn’t about safe, or about pushing, it seemed, so what he said instead was: “I let them know I’m not feeling so well. I’ll drop by the resort tomorrow. No biggie, Cap. Don’t worry about it.”
Tony: In any case, there won't be cheering, but there won't be booing. And I think they are going to raise hell over the media blockage. They are already getting shit over this, Christine has received threats from the state top, AND THEY ARE GOING TO REPORT ABOUT IT, HOLY HELL.
After they finally put an overexcited and overtired Morgan to bed, Tony is out of there like a lightning, before Pepper can offer him a cup of coffee out of politeness or habit, just because that's what they always used to do. Touch base at the end of the day. That used to be the highlight of his evening, the few moments when he finally relaxed and recharged his batteries, because having a child is an exhausting full-time job, but having Pepper there made it easier, at least at first. But gradually, invisibly, the ritual became something that would only drain him further, at best. They kept at it because Pepper thought it meant so much to him, and he thought it meant so much to Pepper.

Okay, maybe I'm wrong. I was, after all, the one insisting we weren't the same people across the timelines. Maybe his Steve had been indifferent, like he seemed to think. Still, it would be easier to believe just about
. There would be group lectures. Personal instruction. Tests. It was going to be intensive, and it was going to be hurried, but Captain Rogers indented to put them through the basic flight training just as if they were at the Academy. He'd pass them if they deserved it, he'd flunk them if they made one mistake too many; there were going to be no leniencies just because they were possibly the last remnant of the human race, and the supply of new cadets was therefore somewhat limited.
I've been to
Did Fury, of all people, have to be the commander of the only gunstar ship that survived the jump? The thought was petty. No, it was horrible; he'd been overjoyed to find out how many people from his old life had somehow survived this disaster. There was Rhodey, previously stationed on
And yet. What if he was wrong? Like he'd been wrong to wait this long, to never say anything and assume Tony would make the first step. Tony was such a riddle. One moment Steve thought he could read him so well, the next moment he had no idea what was playing around in his head.
He was giving me that sharp look of his, so I said it before he could: "There's something I haven't told you."
Tony: Then do what you want.
The moment came and went too quickly, and the reason we were on the street came back to us. He wasn't going to get any help here; no one would open a handy portal and send him over to be a dad to a little girl in need of a Tony Stark. I knew I was supposed to dissuade him from that course of action anyway, but my heart ached for him instead. Let's face it. Whatever he decided to do, I was going to be there for him.
It was all surreal, since he woke up, but perhaps most surreal of all was running into Howard's son in a car by the roadside on Christmas Eve. Steve was trudging back home after
Tony presses the cold, metal pommel onto his hot nipple. The contrast itself is too sharp for it to be soothing at first; it's as if the sensation jolts straight to Steve's cock. Still, he doesn't come, he can't, he needs more. He bites his lip in frustration.
Steve shrugs defiantly, as much as he's able too. He's not going to defend his choices.
He apparently decided to drown his feelings with words. No one was surprised. "Steve? Do you believe all that bullshit, by the way – grief and doom? What's it supposed to mean anyway? It sounds like a couple of second-rate villains – Mr. Doom and Dr Grief." He was obviously babbling in order to hide his own Dr Grief, but I smiled nevertheless.
different. It's really obvious only now. Of course he would be different after a lifetime spent with one person or another, even if there weren't for other variables we can't know anything about. We change each other. Thank god for that. Still, he is still Tony, my Tony,
"The signal is bullshit. Who made these anyway? Were they on sale?"
"I'll go see what's going on down there," Steve was saying, "and you go put on some..."
The door did open, in the end.
"I think you were at 16," Steve said, not that it mattered.
was enough to jar Tony out of his reverie, to make him take a step back and collide with the bulkhead. (How he'd love to have Steve press him against that bulkhead, but that just didn't bear thinking about.)
"So we would set things right first?"
"Well, now, I wouldn't say without clothes, you would have
Tony glanced towards Steve, still behind his barrel, and Steve was still holding his gun at the ready, intent on something, aiming. Alive, so perfectly alive. Everything else lost importance in comparison to that. Tony laughed out, waved his hand recklessly. "Relax," he  almost sang. "These are
Steve got up and joined Tony by the counter. "Basically, I'd be doing you a favor?" he asked, amused.
“Don’t you want to fuck me?”, Tony said, deliberately enunciating every word.
Together with the train of touching and bumping and what have you. He pinched the bridge of his nose for a second, took a deep breath, shook his head at himself.
"Bullshit."
, Tony thought. He didn't think: S
And then, underneath:
The lines, oh so straight; and the angles you could cut your finger on...
Tony: Our zero day, yeah
At this injustice, Tony bristles and glares at Steve.
Tony closed his eyes for a moment, trying to concentrate on his work. You didn't take on Roxxon like that, and live. Or Fisk. Not like
And yet, I couldn't go back to the present and just live on, in the world where he wasn't. I wanted to at last be in the same world as him. Just the fact he existed would make it easier.

Still, "Nope," he said.

This, Tony decided, was going to be quite a ride.
the dragon. And they had no free will whatsoever.
. But Steve was getting tired, and couldn't get close enough to hit anyway, and Tony had just a little ammo left. And besides there were too many of them; he couldn't blast his way out of this, and he had neither time nor the materials to cook something decent up.
Before they can turn around and run, she's already waving at them excitedly. There is a definite recognition in her eyes. And, instead of running away like a normal person, Steve manages to blush and walks over to say hi. Because that's the polite thing to do. Of
Okay, hate was probably too strong a word.
, an inner voice of reason told him.
Tony: clint? really?
Tony: Look, on a different note, I've been thinking.
"Aren't we already?"
Tony stepped towards him, heart hammering. Before either of them could change their mind, he put his hands on Steve's shoulders. "Let's say I wanted." His eyebrows did their little twitch all on their own, out of sheer nervousness.

At least he owed him an explanation.

"...what if he doesn't get it?"
Tony: For my peace of mind, and yours, I'm now choosing to believe you would have told me eventually, and we would have sorted it out. I would have understood. The circumstances in Siberia, they were... tailor made for disaster. Literally.

, after years and years of suppressed longing. He wanted to devour him. He wanted to laugh.
Tony: Me too, pal.
"Just get to it," he says, trying to beat his own impulse to hesitate, and it almost comes off as gruff. (Almost as if they were just talking.)
Tony: Listen, yeah, a part of me was afraid you were going to think I was selling out for power or position or whatever.
isn't so shabby, but it's for later.
Tony: I'm just shitscared, Steve.
Tony: Steve
Tony: Why, what are you on?
, he thought, but he had an impression that wasn't something Tony wanted to hear right then. All that saying those words would accomplish would be to unburden Steve himself, and thus it would be an innately selfish act. Besides, Steve had tried apologizing about it, before; never worked.
biased, either. It was his friend, asking the hard questions, like she tended to. Steve leaned over and kissed her on the cheek. "That's something to think about. Thanks, Natasha." She seemed a little surprised, but just shrugged.
"You do keep lagging to the left."
He shoots a defiant look at Steve, but Steve is just smiling at him indulgently. And then, the extremely annoying person that he is, his blond companion says: "Well, we
I'd always imagined that their relationship, whatever it was, had this air of casual physical intimacy. I'd obviously imagined wrong, as per usual. What I'd taken for ease in Tony's manner , right then, was probably deliberately done. It can't have been easy for him either to ask for intimacy. I know that sometimes, even later on, I had to convince myself to touch him, not because I didn't want to but because everything in me still had to get used to the idea that he also wanted that. From me.
. Put some Berger waves to a good use for once in his life. And all of a sudden, Steve's lips were on his, hot, insistent, desperate, scared. And there was fervent hope there, and a whole burning sea of tenderness, and to tell the truth, he had no idea what was his and what was Steve's any more, but if just kissing was going to feel like
"No, really, where's Darryl? He's not in his office, I looked," the big guy commented, leaning against the makeshift bar. Everyone knew Thor around here, and absolutely no one was surprised to see him. "Gimme a drink," the blond pilot demanded and the requested abomination was dutifully poured as a few voices of the Gale-Dale think-tank explained that Chief was most probably in the storage area, working doubles in his free time.
Skiing was the first time Tony, as a kid, had experienced something akin to flying. He remembered it vividly – how he’d left the expensive instructor to glare after him open-mouthed, his sentence unfinished, as Tony took off downslope, in and out of the powdery snow like a dolphin.
"Two weeks what? Two weeks since..."
Tony: No. What are you doing there, compiling a medical file for me?
Pause on Tony's side is minuscule, to his credit. "You're in New York," he breathes, but that's all of the surprise he allows himself to express. The very next second he's all business. "Where?"
, surely? Isn't that the point?"
"So," Steve said, somewhat bravely, when the waitress finally went away, "what's your gripe with Christmas, then?" In the yellow light, Tony finally had a chance to study that face for longer. Earlier, Tony had assembled a jigsaw puzzle from stolen glances and vague reflections in the windshield. But now he didn't have to pretend he wasn't looking because Steve was looking right back. It was the face Tony knew, all right, but on war propaganda and in history books Steve had looked noble and elevated and practically made from plastic. And hot plastic is still plastic. This was the reason Tony had stolen a few photos he'd found in Howard's desk, very many Christmases ago. In them, this man here was less of a Captain America and more of Steve Rogers, shy or serious or even goofy. The expressions, not the features, were actually the reason Tony was positive this was really him. And now the sadness in his eyes hadn't melted away, not exactly, but a certain warmth had found its way back there, and there was something so amicable in the curve of his lips that Tony didn't mind him asking questions. What's more, he didn't even mind answering.
"She didn't think it was funny," I guessed.
"It's all true, isn't it?" Steve said in a voice somewhat less shocky than Tony had expected.
Steve's hands traced the waistline of Tony's pants, pressing into his skin, at the same time wanting to prolong this and to feel everything
Because it was true, all of it, insomuch that Tony had dreamed of Steve dreaming about it. Repeatedly. Sometimes it was Peter taking a bullet for Steve, but Tony had a feeling that wasn't the one that worried Steve so much. In that one Peter looked different, older, and Steve did go on blaming himself afterwards, but...
Tony: Because of the career assassination, you mean. Well, that was the big idea.
was one of them. The cruiser Tony was on ended up badly damaged. And all of them were, as far as he knew, in an unknown sector of space. Uncharted. The other side of the Red Line. So far away from the known areas that it was possible no human ships had passed this way before. Could they go back? That was the million dollar question. Was there anything to go back to? An even bigger question still.
As Steve ate – the soup was excellent, hearty, with some spice to it and a lot of vegetables – Tony kept moving around the kitchen restlessly, opening and closing the fridge, the cupboards, the drawers. He was turning something over in his head, Steve could tell, and any moment now it was going to burst out of him.
Steve realized he was throwing about for a good reason to say no to what was basically a perfectly nice offer. No. Not perfectly nice. Way more than that. The offer was making him way too happy, and he'd learned to be leery of things that made him too happy. "Isn't Morgan going to come over tomorrow, or one of these days?"
"Hey," Steve said. His voice sounded a bit watery. Tony nodded to him, because voice was just a distant possibility at that point, and in some part of his brain that wasn't completely clouded over he figured he wouldn't want to sound all high-pitched, would he now. That would be totally humiliating.
He felt caged, more than ever.
I grabbed the ring with my shield on it. I also grabbed his left hand in mine. "Tony," I said, trying to burn my way into his head with my eyes, "do you take me as your husband?"
Tony was frowning at him. "You okay, buddy?"
"Like you wouldn't believe."
Thank you for all your wonderful reviews. I'm terribly behind with answering them, but RL is crazy, and I'm able to post this right now only because it was already written and just needed some editing. But here, have some hearts instead <3 <3 <3 Your feedback means the world to me.
He was all the way across the room, then; he didn't even know how that happened. They weren't touching, not yet, but they were standing solidly in each other's personal space, and the not-touching thing was more like having your favorite ice cream right in front of you. You could dig in right now, but you want to savor it for a moment longer, to finally taste the longing, because earlier it was too painful and you kept it at bay, but now that you're just seconds away from fulfillment, you can allow yourself to experience your feelings to the fullest.
Tony: Oooh, symbolic!
"It's not a romance type of book," she said.
Tony: People can be heady. It's like crowd-surfing, only you don't have to really move, and no one has to touch you. Thankfully. But I like people! On general principle.
promise to take me clubbing some time, show me how it's done, all that."
Tony: Okay.

awkward between them, but perhaps
Steve's hand flew to his own face, for all the world as if a strange alien life form had sprung up on his face. And the beard didn't look
"Tony, could I talk to you?" Steve seemed subdued, very collected, his voice soft. Tony could almost believe the humiliation from ten minutes ago never even happened. But it did, it
"What? I don't even get bridal carry?"
And then, seconds later, his body was pressed against Steve's, gently rocking to the tact of a sweet, folky tune Tony thought he recognized from somewhere, but couldn't rightly put a name to. Everything felt unreal. He could feel a part of him drift away and, instead of having that overtired impression of looking at himself from the outside, his consciousness focused on the lyrics for a moment.
Steve's face closed up. He was reading Tony right, Tony was sure of it.
"I know what you mean," Tony says quickly. He hasn't looked at it that way, and also, he's desperate not to let the conversation die. "If one person is in love with another, but says nothing. And that other person is in love with the first person, and also says nothing..." He wants to hit himself on the head, because his words are falling out of his mouth without his consent and, especially, without thinking.
Every day, Tony gave lectures. His teaching time was squeezed in between physical exercises (pretty tasking), combat tactic classes with Rogers (pretty interesting), and flight instruction, held one-on-one in the only flight simulator aboard the ship. The cadets' days were filled from dawn till dusk, but Tony always ended up teaching for at least four or five hours a day. There was a lot of ground to cover, too quickly, so he pretty much took a funnel and poured knowledge into heads, hoping some of it would stick to the sides.
Tony: Look, I'm only deflecting because I don't know what to say.
Tony: Ya-huh, right, when pigs fly
I think it was a barest whisper, but he must have heard me. I saw his eyes snap open. He tore the sunglasses off, staring at me for a barest second, and then he was jumping to his feet. Getting into my face.
At that moment Stark seemed to remember the Captain was there at all. A flicker of an eye back at Steve, barely perceptible; and then he wrapped up the sentence and turned back. Twisted a corner of his mouth up, at Steve, in a manner that didn't seem quite mocking, but didn't seem quite
Tony: But generally, screw people. I was thinking more on the lines of, right now I'm at an on-loan exhibition of Picasso's rare drawings
Steve pulled out, relatively slowly, maybe a quarter of the way, then pounded back in. Tony felt himself sliding perhaps two inches across the bed; he grabbed onto Steve’s upper arms for purchase and held on with all he had. Something clenched in his stomach as he stared up into Steve’s face from so near. A keen hunger mixed with tenderness so fierce it could be expressed only by digging his nails all the way in; and Steve took hold of his shoulders in turn, holding him firmly in place. Pulled out, again not too far, then in, all the way, to fill him, to fuck him, to give him what he wanted.
Despite all his efforts to the contrary, though, on the inside it still
In this timeline, my age is finally starting to catch up with me. The joints creek and ache and tend to predict weather. The stairs are becoming an enemy. I finally remember how it feels to be breathless after a run. And while I try to run on, months stubbornly crawl by.
Tony: Look, I'm probably just playing devil's advocate. I don't even know.
They worked well together. They always had, as long as it didn't require actually talking to each other.
"Is that a good idea?"
He grabbed a shovel and cleared out a path to the main house and the driveway as much as he could, even though it was still snowing with crazy enthusiasm.
me it was not how wars worked," Fury corrected gruffly. "And I never asked for your pearls of wisdom, just your skills as a mechanic."
Tony: I KNOW.
Tony: Get laid?
“I took a Cortolan shot this morning.” He shrugged defensively. “So that’s that, it’s done already. Hate to see it go to waste.”
Tony: I’m not holding a grudge here, is what I'm trying to say. I just still feel like shit about it and don’t know how to stop.
Tony: As established previously, if all of us had talked more, lots of this could have been avoided.
The gauntlet works just like Strange speculated it would, on the way here. It's sapping Steve's strength away, sucking all the will out of him. It's a vortex, trying to pull him apart. If not for the serum, he isn't sure he'd be able to withstand it even for a second. Even as it is, his time is exceedingly short.
Tony: I don't understand.
history.
They escape towards the elevator, and as soon as they are out of the lobby, Tony hisses:
"See, even you saw it coming. It was only me that was too self-absorbed to notice anything."
And then: Is it possible he survived the last battle
No, not like that, that's too laid-back.
At that, he shook his head mutely, and I could read every ounce of grief in his face for a moment, before he wiped it like a blackboard. "Do you want something?" he asked noncommittally.
"But, we're pilots," Cap went on. "Like it or not, Stark, people look up to us. And the situation being as it is – it's actually important, right now. We need to present a united front. No shows of disrespect. No insubordination." Rogers paused. "I know you already know all this."
Tony definitely didn't feel like sleeping. He desperately needed to do something with his nervous energy. Had he had a horizontal bar, he might have tried to do some honest-to-god chin-ups, pulled a regular Sarah-Connor-in-the-asylum. Wasn't that a prison tradition of sorts? "Wish I knew how to do push-ups with this leg," he grumbled softly.
Tony: Sounds like it. You tell me, big guy.
Tony: I'm juggling like a hundred balls right now, but everything's working fine.
, even here, even under these circumstances, if only he thought Steve actually wanted him. He meets Steve's eyes, and what he sees there catches him by surprise. Steve's pupils are shiny, dilated. His breathing faster. His gaze keeps flicking down towards Tony's body. "You kind of like the idea, don't you?" Tony thinks, and is surprised at the sound of his own voice actually saying the words. He wants to backtrack, backpedal, but Steve swallows visibly and nods.
Their eyes locked for a moment in a silent battle. Different impulses fought for dominance inside Tony. Stubbornness and a wish to cut this nonsense and
Tony: I've taught you well.
Tony: Steve? Won't you come to my room now?
. And if I’d had a sliver of empathy, I’d have known not to drag you through snow and ice all day,” he added. By what Tony could see, Steve was hugging himself under the blankets; and all Tony wanted was to get closer, wrap his arms around him and hold him until it all got better. It wasn’t even about this crazy chemistry thing that seemed to have sprung up between them. At the moment all Tony wanted was to make Steve warm again.
Tony: There are other things going on in the world besides from you.
Tony laughed, more in relief than anything else. “Oh, that’s okay, you’re okay, Rogers, don’t worry.” And he wondered at his own sense of relief, and he wondered at his own overly dramatic reaction to every word Steve said, as if they were all pregnant with emotional meaning, as if even the most innocent comment was a missile they shot at each other. And he knew, he
Very quickly, the convo turns from

"Aw Christ, don't
, Tony.”
Tony: No, I didn't.
"I actually have to do this, you know," Tony said, gesturing with the package the medic had given him.
"It's not..." Steve paused, sighed. "Look, I don't want to talk about this, all right? It's nothing. I miscalculated. That's all."
" Tony asked. And: "Got the sprinklers now. They were just offline because of the... And there, I extended the range, this should work like a charm. Cap?
Now he'd enticed the mild-mannered doctor Banner too. Dragged him down here because he apparently needed a
"What?"
I take another deep breath. I have to go talk to him, but it's like I'm glued in place. I have this vague idea I'd try and show him some pictures as a proof because suddenly my own life story sounds thin, unbelievable. How can I get through this conversation, if he's going to look at me like a stranger, like an impostor?  I stand there, my hand halfway stuck in the hidden pocket of my jacket, where I keep my wallet and the photos.
But – no. He knew me. He wouldn't be getting into my face  so aggressively if I was just a random stranger. "Answer me," he ordered. He was... moving, breathing, bristling at me, and it was a miracle.
"It's not your fault," Steve says, obviously seeing his semi-words weren't enough, but despite his best efforts, he sounds half-assed. "We got our signals crossed. It's not... I'm not mad at you."
"You know," he said conversationally a moment later. "I'm going to tear this place to the ground. I don't know where exactly it is or what it is, but I'm going to fucking tear it apart stone for stone. Oh," he added lightly, "and if anything's left, I'm going to burn it to ashes."
At some point – he loses the sense of time completely – he hears Tony's voice, seemingly softer than ever, almost a whisper through his voice filters. "It's okay. Relax into it. Ride it out. Let it happen, big guy. You're almost there. Let it happen."
I lived on. I still live on.
Or, not exactly want, but something that, left unchecked, could and would become want.
Tony: Well, he brought good coffee, but he kind of slammed it on the desk before me, so that I wouldn't read too much into it. And he gave me the mother of all sourpatch glares.
And before Steve could digest the flood of words properly, Tony was already turning away, somewhat clumsy on his crutches, and hurrying off. Steve caught up to him in two strides, so that they walked side by side. "I can see a bit better now," he said quietly, because he needed a moment to figure out what to do, what to say, and because he thought Tony would want to hear this.
Tony: To prattle about how, according to his findings, the rift between you and me, as well as the Avengers splitting  apart,  is unraveling the fabric of this universe around our ears?
Steve takes a moment to untangle what Tony is saying. Mostly because he can't believe it, Tony figures. He frowns. "You are failing at... not loving me."
Tony: Also, now you get to legit be unnecessarily jealous over Christine fucking Everhart, and I get to be jealous about you going on dates and things, right?
"You call this not attracting notice?" Steve hisses at him reproachfully as soon as they are done and away (as soon as Tony has gotten his way, that is).
do it, and it was all there was to it, this had been a bad idea from the start. The apologies had been politely exchanged, there were a few polite voice messages, and he should have kept it at that. Politeness was good. Closeness wasn't. (Closeness was pain and dread, closeness was a million tiny needles stuck in your heart.)
Tony: Maybe a bit.
"Oh, good. Mack? Eric and Billy?"
"Despite what the Ancient One told you?"
"I can pretend to explain the science I don't totally understand yet, if you want me to, but..." Steve didn't, it seemed. Not right at that moment, at least. Tony felt him shift, and a firm hand sneaked around Tony's waist; Steve  glanced at him from a corner of his eye. Still, all he said (quite nonchalantly, Tony had to give him that) was: "The alien mist, then?"
He pauses. "You know what," he says. "We actually are. We really are. Aren't we?"
it wasn't. He wanted
Steve shivers.
“I told you you would catch a bug if you stayed in that cabin,” he murmured. He knew his voice was choked up. “You always think you can’t catch anything. But you caught a case of feelings, so yeah.
I want to bite my tongue in half, and  that unparalyzes me. I take him in my arms, burying my face into his shoulder, and let out just one violent, silent sob.
Tony used to be angry at Steve for what happened between them, in Germany, in Siberia. He's not any longer. Now he's just... resigned to the fact that Steve doesn't care one bit. That's what used to hurt the most, before Tony made his peace with it. It doesn't, any longer.
They all, as far as Steve understood, used to belong to this government agency called SHIELD, but when they discovered  the sort of thing their agency had been doing, experimenting on people, they changed sides in this huge interplanetary war, and very soon after that, Tony's ship got shot down and he ended up here.
," Tony said bleakly. "Holy fuck, I'm getting a cardiac arrest from laughter, over here. Listen, when we get out of here..."
Tony fought a smile, gave up. "Not bad," he commented. They were still leaning against the railing, side by side, shoulders touching, and it was so
Tony: Okay, letting that go.
? Into the fire?
“Dammit, Cap...”, he gasped.
He, defiantly enough,
STARK: What? I wasn't even joking.
SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE (KOSTOLITZ?): Could the battle of New York have been avoided if not for the interference of the former Avengers? We know what you did, Tony, it was heroic. But what about the others?
He has no idea what he's going to say to Steve if he finds him. Still, finding him, talking to him is crucial.
It was like a revelation.  “You’re afraid of fear.”
Tony: I don't have time.
Tony approaches Steve, clears his throat. Startled out of his reverie, Steve almost jumps. He looks at Tony, then, blushing an even fiercer red, looks away quickly.
Irritation surged up in Tony. "Fine."
Besides, in the darkness and the loneliness, it was easy to slip into their old patterns, bickering and occasionally fussing over each other; he could almost forget those other times that hadn't been so good and not nearly so amiable as all this. He pulled away and hissed with poorly controlled pain.
The red details of Steve’s onesie flattered the sudden crimson of his face wonderfully. His voice remained admirably steady, though. “The snowboard,” he said with patience. Then nodded, as if to himself. “Yeah, the snowboard. I’ve never tried it before.”
Tony: Yep.
the announcer intoned from the top of the stairs, and Tony's gaze wandered over for a moment, and focused; he caught himself smiling suddenly, almost imperceptibly. It will be good to see everyone again, especially Peter.
Steve decided to play his game for the moment and act as if he didn't know who he was. "May I offer you a drink of wine?" he asked and offered him the wineskin.
Which was... well, one big fat lie, but he kept telling it to himself in case it worked. He sneaked a look at Steve, at the familiar way he moved, the life he was bringing to everything around him. Tony couldn't decide if this kind of liveliness was a sacrilege or exactly what this place needed right now. But it was disturbing Tony's melancholy and he wasn't sure how he felt about that.
), and Nebula is saying "I will end you all", and he is teamed up with Natasha, sheltering behind a snow drift that is now a provisionary fort.
"Did she let him down gently?"
"No," he admitted, as if something had cheered him up an infinitesimally small but still noticeable amount. "I don't think so. I think we didn't love the correct parts of each other.
It's heavy and cold and metallic. Steve sucks.
Steve, who usually had patience with people, for some reason kept snapping at Tony. Maybe because he was so hyperaware of his presence. He turned to Tony – Tony, who was fussing over Louis, obviously concerned. Tony who had been snippy and smart-mouthed, but obviously wasn't a coward. Everyone had their own way of dealing with nerves, and Steve should have been more understanding. Still, something in Tony's attitude needled him so. It seemed they always got off on a wrong foot, in any situation. Steve remembered his flustered cheeks when Tony in a towel started invading his personal space. Whatever foot they started on, it turned into a wrong foot in a very short span of time.
Tony: Oh, surely you remember, a checkerboard, 64 squares, things. You know.
Steve had given him a Look. That look made Tony feel tiny; lower than the lowest of all the despicable politicians.
Tony: Also, copying a bit of my style here and there, not that I can blame him.
"Yes, Steve?"
"Let's see how you do," Rogers said, and there was a bit of challenge in his voice, and it made Tony's foot go straight to the accelerator of its own volition and
Bruce muttered something unintelligible, in the vein of, "Do that again and I'll
"My Tony and I, we... weren't all that close," I said wretchedly. "Well, in the end, we were, I suppose, kind of. And it would have gotten better, I think, but..." I swallowed. I never forgave myself those last five years, really. I kept telling myself it was his decision and not mine, but I suppose I'm cursed to forever wander: if I'd tried to talk to him earlier, tried to clear the air, would he have let me be a part of his life? I wouldn't have wanted anything
Tony new perfectly well where it was. He's held it in his hands a thousand times, wondering how things went so much to shit between them and where he went wrong. But Steve's face is also getting pensive, so Tony has to do something about that, and being obnoxious was his safest bet. After all, the advice you most often hear is
Tony: So where does that leave us?

he wants.
When we started the whole thing Tony hadn't been exactly young. The medicine did advance considerably, and thanks to it and to his own crazy sharp will and mind, he stayed spry almost to the end and he kept his mind to the last. He did worry about it quite a bit, but he was never in any real danger. Practically to the last day he still read complicated classical novels in six languages and kept working on new inventions. Me, I had the serum. As time went by, I started hating it more and more.
Tony clicked his tongue. "We'll be in our bunk."
Rhodey, however, seemed so weird and fidgety and uncharacteristically distracted, that Tony almost forgot his own hurt for a moment. "What's with you tonight, baby?"
Tony: How are you doing, though, are you okay?
Tony: Maybe a bit.
"We can't just turn the grav strips back on," he told Hope, now that they actually
Tony: And then there's a part of me that thinks Ross was at least a known evil, and I've no idea who will come to take his place.
Tony's come and the leather tails hit him at the same time. Exhilaration and pain wash over his groin, swipe him away, and then he's coming himself, gasping, yelling. And yet, that feeling of almost-there-but-not-quite is still present. He
He looked tired and overstimulated, so I dragged him off to a nearby park and made him sit down on a bench. It was early evening already, the air was warm (it was early June there, I found out later), and I had Tony with me; for the first time that day I thought: I could do this.
, but the stupid comm seemed half-dead, so he got back to his work.
"Let's get started."
"Oh, good," Tony said. "Who else is there? Whom can you see?"
A tux, really? Just.. no. It wasn't about looks, not so much. You wouldn't stick Han Solo in a tux, would you? It was simply unnatural. Still, Peter seemed perfectly self-assured and completely and blessedly unaware of any out-of-placeness, which was a part of his charm.
Never in his life had Tony gotten out of his clothes so quickly. Steve followed suit, and soon they were both standing there completely naked, and almost at a loss for what exactly to do. The urgency had abated a little bit, now that they weren’t touching; it seemed they took a moment to really look at each other.
Since then it had become even more screwed up. Almost every day, almost every night, he would find himself there at some point, on the inside of Steve's head, looking out. And although he didn't see how any of that could possibly be real, he let himself taste Steve's mind, bit by bit, sliver by sliver; Steve's emotions were big and all-encompassing as the ocean –
Tony breathed out. "I could have lost you," he repeated. And it was probably too much, but in the grand scheme of things, so what? So, Steve would know Tony cares about him? He could imagine worse things; for example, Steve falling through the ice and never coming out. Steve thinking Tony was indifferent to him, Steve thinking Tony never forgave him; that was
Tony's silence in response was telling, likely as much as Steve's.
“I thought you wanted to kiss me”, he heard himself say.
Steve gave her a helpless look. "I don't know, " he said, fibbing a bit. He rubbed his forehead a few times. "That's not the... Look, the fraternization rules are there for a reason."
Yet, other times, when he tried to sum up their relationship, he got a different result. He, himself, was guilty of always standing too close to Tony, leaning on the bar right next to him as he delivered a lecture on the evils of drink (he meant it, too), invading his personal space; and Tony never moved away, never withdrew. He invaded Steve's space right back. Elbows on the bar, unabashedly touching, feet under the table; sometimes, Steve suspected, Tony pretended he was far drunker than he was, so that Steve would have to help him home; sometimes Tony made a ruckus on purpose (Steve suspected) in front of the Sheriff's office so that Steve would have to come out and take him into custody for the night. Steve was happy to – and then they would talk and talk, and suddenly Tony would seem far less rowdy than five minutes before. And there was that one time, when Tony genuinely was black-out drunk, and Steve had to put him to bed, and Tony held Steve's hand so hard and just wouldn't let go, and so Steve sat with him until Tony fell asleep, still holding his hand. The next day, neither mentioned it. Neither of them
Tony: I'm aware of your opinions.
Tony: In a non-nice way.
We did all this in a mostly platonic manner. We did touch more than friends usually do, and infinitely more than I ever did with the Tony from my timeline. If one of us grew sad, hands on shoulders became a staple. While we watched movies, we'd sit quite close together. Still, all of that came gradually, and it took time. It began with our elbows touching on one of our movie nights, and then, suddenly, it was the knees too. It was magnificent. Flustered, I tried to apologize and scoot away. Tony just rolled his eyes at me and said, "Whatever you want. But don't try to tell me it doesn't feel nice."
," Steve shoots right back, and what he doesn't have in cute nickname invention department, he sure makes up with sugary voice and big heart eyes directed at Tony. Suddenly, Tony is extremely happy Steve had ignored him earlier in the day. Had this game gone on for longer than a few minutes, it could have slipped out of hand
"I didn't say affection," Steve said quickly.
"Yeah, get into the simulator. Turn it on, get warmed up," Steve told him, still not looking up. "I'll be there in a minute."
Tony: I'm serious. I know you won't talk to me now, but you should talk to someone. Talk to Nat. She's been through shit. She'll understand.
Tony: I'm fine.
Then he found himself pressed to the big chest, wrapped in gentle and a little desperate arms, and he let himself bury his head into Steve's shoulder for a moment and just held onto him, just breathed in the warmth. And this moment of contact seemed to break the final seal, and his own mind was suddenly tightly enveloped in the spacious, abundant affection that was all Steve; slowly bubbling joy finally dared rise it's head and peer out from the snow, blinked twice and said:
"I'm fine. You?"
Yeah, trying not to think about it wasn't exactly working.
Steve's voice elbowed its way into his thoughts. "Tony, is it possible that there was a hull breach?"
As if it was that easy, eh? He felt himself suddenly get irritated. He didn't need hand holding and pep talks. He forced a smile. "I'll do that, won't I." Believe me, he thought, annoyed. "Captain." His voice sounded rehearsed, and fake, and that was all well, but he still felt his throat constrict at the next words. "I was going to apologize," he said curtly.
"Oh, for fuck's sake," Tony muttered and limped over, wincing at the shooting pains with every step. "Are you actually cold yourself, since you keep insisting?"
"You don't owe me anything, Tony," Steve added, and he sounded infinitely sad, and now Tony wanted to bang his head against the window he was leaning his forehead against.
" he said very pointedly. "Just in case you were wondering. This is not checking you off a bucket list or anything." This made it all sound so much worse. He should just shut up, really, once in his life, just shut up and not say anything for the next three days.
, was Steve's first thought. The answer was easy. You really didn't have to be a genius. He'd been too pushy, too impulsive. It had all been too much. Steve had been horrified when he realized it was Howard Tony was talking about. Parents have such power. They create the best or the worst memories that follow their children for the whole life. And here was Howard, responsible for this hoarseness in Tony's voice, and now Steve felt angry at himself for even

Tony: Which is a risk when you do what we do, granted. But in the cases where the risk is controllable, I’m going to fucking control it. Zemo did his best to undo me personally in order to take his revenge on the Avengers. And you.
Steve was giving him quick instructions
He was glaring at me, but he wasn't extremely serious about it. "Why are you evading my question? Why are you
I shook my head
Tony nodded. He could already tell this was not going to be a reprimand, and he was mildly puzzled now. He inclined his head, studying Cap. He looked almost like in the days before he'd decided he was done with Tony, only even more self-conscious. Tony had to resist the urge to say something semi-provocative just to see him blush.
Right now he wanted to see Steve like a drowning man reaching for a life buoy. Just a minute would be enough. Just to touch him for a briefest second and rest his forehead against Steve's shoulder. Just that. And when did
Cap was suddenly much closer. Tony wasn't sure when that happened. The man seemed about to say something, but Tony beat him to it. "What's a pretty guy like you doing at a place like this?" The question fell out of his mouth of its own volition and hung in the air like poison gas. He had this tendency to spurt whatever words crossed his mind at any given time; especially when he felt the metal walls pressing down on him this intensely.
I spot Morgan first. The familiar face, two decades or so older, just jumps at me out of a hundred small scenes around me.
was looking. Still, when his gaze strayed towards Rogers, Cap started. He looked away too quickly. Blinked a few times. Hurriedly started pretending he was doing something else.
Somewhat before 3 p.m. the signal briefly reappeared, and he got a text from Pepper. Apparently, they'd tried to get through to the lake house, but they promptly turned back. Since it was impossible to actually make a call, Tony texted Steve to tell him not to bother and apologized for wasting his time. Hopefully he wasn't on his way yet. He would hate the weather. The forecast was subpolar.
about it at night. But, intertwined with that, there was also a giddy feeling regarding Cap himself. Over and over, he caught himself picturing how he could tease Rogers that day, imagining all the perfectly explicable touches, there and not there, a barely perceptible brush of a hand against hand. They always sent a sharp thrill through him – only because he fancied that, in response, he detected a tiny tremor in Cap's hand too, felt a sudden heat radiating from the man's body. As if his own imaginings of how Cap must be feeling gave him a strange kick, an electric charge straight through his gut.
"You miss her?"
Tony: Gee, thanks.
"Wow, cheeky," Tony commented, his voice a hoarse and dry whisper, barely audible. He could do nothing about it, yay, new levels of humiliation there.
"I already got an analgesic," Steve remarked, resigned.
"I'm going to..." Steve drew in a sharp breath, stilled himself, regained control. "Just
They were brusque with each other, but Steve could see an underlying affection there – easily spotted in Tony, because he knew Tony well, and he knew Tony had bucketfuls of secret affection for nearly everyone he chose to have in his life. But Fury, too; Steve could see he
Tony: Not an excuse, Steve!
Bruce tried to hide a smile, unsuccessfully, which was a win.
"...Smuggle shit..." Steve supplanted with a smile, because it was happening, it was really happening, Tony was actually inviting him along. To go away, the two of them, together. Like in a ballad (but without anyone tragically dying in the end).
I offered my hand, palm up on the table. "Give me your hand," I said.
, he told himself, but it wasn't really working.
. I did wish for a bit of quiet, in the past, but what I'd had in mind wasn't the kind of quiet I would enjoy
Tony: Honestly, my main problem is... Look, I'll happily pay for anything, but if I really have to pay for someone to listen to me rant, then I don't want it. If that's the only way I can get it, I don't want it.
to. You took some remedial classes. You worked harder. You tried again. That was that. The pool of possible cadets was very limited, and their own sad bunch was crème de la crème.
While the medic was finishing her work, Tony and Steve let the silence stretch. Just sitting together. What was going on in Tony's chest right then could perhaps be compared to petals slowly opening, one by one. It felt warm, and red, but not like fire (he shuddered at a thought of fire). Because, up until then he could try telling himself that he didn't know Steve for real, didn't know what he was like; was he selfish, perhaps, or a coward? Tony couldn't know that. He'd seen him act kindly towards others, yes, but that didn't have to mean anything.
"Oh, you're going to California?" There was a certain wistfulness in Steve's tone.
"Not particularly enthusiastic," Natasha shot back coolly, but she went, and Carol said "Yes. There has been enough violence already. It's enough."
He wondered if he should invite the new cadets into the pilots canteen that evening – all of them. As the captain, he could break the unwritten rules. Still, it was never a good idea for the ranking officer to interfere with the ranks' traditions and small games. Like the hazing, for example. You didn't step in unless it really got out of hand – unless it turned to outright bullying or if real aggression was springing from it. This time around it didn't happen because the nuggets had diverted the effort into the war with the tech. No-interference policy was sometimes for the best. The guys needed to find their own balance, their own dynamics. Things seemed to be working too. Both Clint, Sam and Natasha thought it was all going well.
"We taking the car?"
Tony: Yeah, with you. In private. At one in the morning. When I'm too fucking exhausted to worry about showing vulnerability, ffs.
Tony: Get your head out of your ass!
," she said dryly. "I've never seen anything like it in my life. Strip, mister. Stop wasting my time. If you're all right, don't keep me from the people who aren't" Then, to herself, she muttered something that sounded suspiciously like: "Fucking pilots."
"Will you undress for me?" he asks Steve when he's done, and Steve swallows, nods, starts taking off his uniform. Tony watches him peel it off his body with quick, practical motions. Tony would tease every inch of that body with his lips and teeth and hands, and the fact that he mustn't touch is a sort of torture on its own.
"Nope, but now I got you." Tony's mouth quirked. "Maybe you can't kick through these walls, exactly, but you can sure be useful."
Tony: Okay. Remember how I talked to you for an hour and a half two nights back although I'm pissed as all hell at you. Well, I'm going to need you to reply to me now. No matter how much you're whatever at me.
Tony: I just cleaned out your shit from my house.
"I've known you to do some foolishly brave things when you didn't have it," Steve countered.
Desperately mortified, he crossed the small distance between them. Expecting to feel hands on his chest any moment, pushing him away, Steve threw his arms around Tony stiffly, awkwardly, as if he'd never used arms before, as if the purpose of limbs in general mystified him. And he plastered a stupid, dry, wooden kiss in the middle of Tony's forehead of all places.
Tony: Black knight to f6.
"There's a time and place for everything," Steve deadpanned, or tried.
is what makes Steve's cock dance and weep.
Was that what this was? He did seem extremely pissed at Steve earlier. Now he was sweet and pliant, all gentle touches and soft kisses. The darkness wasn't a problem for Steve with his dark vision. He studied Tony's half-lowered eyelids from up close, and he wanted to kiss them, one and then the other – and maybe he should, now that he had his chance. So yes, let's do that, he thought, let's do everything I've wanted to do. Still, he chickened out halfway through and just rested his lips against Tony's cheekbone.
, he wanted to say. He filtered it, though. Brain to mouth filters
There she was, sliding through the crowd.
Tony’s heart skipped a wobbly beat.
Tony snorted. "Yeah, I bet everyone's dying to know." He turned to Peter, raised an eyebrow. "You're being pretty cool about this."
"Tony, I almost..." he croaks.
"What I
, Bruce had said.
"I guess." Steve smiled back. And seriously, he had to stop doing that. How was Tony supposed to have any kind of conversation while Steve did that?
It sends a sudden thrill through Tony, and there would be nothing wrong with it, only, a) he's not going there with Steve, honestly, it would be a stupid thing to do on top of everything, and b) it's not
When Steve first moved into the Tower, he was surprised to find out Tony tended to fuss over people. To bring them smoothies. Check if they had everything they needed. Cover them if they fell asleep on the couch. Steve was even more surprised – and embarrassed – to admit that he actually liked it, deep down. At first he thought he just missed someone taking care of him. Later, with something akin to alarm, he realized he actually, apparently wanted to be fussed over by
Must be my birthday." She turned back to Steve. "Captain, please. I don't have all day."
Tony: Good night.
In the beginning – this new beginning – there is a bit of a celebration and a bit of mourning, all wrapped into one; there are friends reunited, and there are reconciliations; hands shaken, hugs exchanged, glasses clinking against glasses. There are even some speeches. As the evening progresses, these get less boring, albeit a bit slurred. Because, in this instant that is a beginning and also an end, there is a big party taking place at the Avengers Compound.
That was the dormitory effect. Put a few adults in a dormitory, they'll start acting as if they were in school all over again. Nothing to be done about it. He made an over-the-top contrite face at Valkyrie. "I didn't know," he said, picking up the bag from the bunk he'd previously chosen at random. There were ten bunk beds in neat rows and Tony looked them up and down. "They all belonged to someone or other in the past, though," he continued. "Which means I can pick none of them." And then, flash-fast, he produced his most charming grin and turned to Thor: "Maybe I can sleep with you instead?"
Tony: I know. You told me.
He was silent for a time. "Steve?" he said then, quietly. "Why are you here?"
I'm in love with!"
"Do I get a love story?" Tony asked suddenly. And then, when she frowned at him, almost as if she had no idea what he was talking about: "In your novel? A romantic subplot or something?"
Tony moves now, if just to cross his arms across his chest.
"Drink?" someone offered, and Tony nodded.
And then, out of a corner of his eye, he saw Steve finally being released from Thor's grip. Tony half expected Thor to propel Steve towards Tony or something equally horrifying. All Thor did, however, was mouth something at Tony over Steve's shoulder. It looked suspiciously like
Another day, another dormitory, Tony mused. Hazing was a part of this, he knew that much, but he was too old for that shit. At 18, sure, he'd gone through it. He'd grinned, partook in a few prank wars, won more often than not. Now all he wanted to do was sigh. He hadn't slept last night. He'd never been too good with excitement and waiting, so he'd spent the night in the landing bay – again – saying good bye to the engines and sorting the repaired and salvaged parts in a more comprehensive manner in order to kill time. Waiting for the results of the test. The feeling was same as 20 years ago; he didn't particularly like it. And now the hazing again.
that obviously wasn't Steve, how could he be.
“You could have stayed and had fun. It was a great house.”
“You had fever yesterday. You can’t just go skiing.”
But now he was unusually out of sorts. It was just that kind of night. He went through the conversation on autopilot, not even cursorily trying to be charming.
, he wanted to say, because this wasn't okay, that kind of looks, of body language, and then nothing again, nothing. He hated himself for caring. He hated himself for dancing to it, like a fish on a string.
Tony: it devaluates responsibility
"The what?"
Things he'd left at the Compound: his post-its, all over the place; Steve's stupid office with his stupid art; his feelings.
Tony: Did you butt-type all the exclamation points or was that on purpose?
“It’s like... No.” Tony thought for a moment. “It’s like, I get scared that I’ll panic. Like, I know I tend to panic in situations like that and...”
," he said, realization dawning. "I fell into the lake. Didn't I?"
Steve gave him a grateful look, though. Nodded. Because sometimes it's a relief to have someone put your own thoughts into words so that you don't have to.
Tony: Oh look, it can talk.
Tony: pawn to f3
"Smoke," he said at the same time Steve said: "Something's burning." And then, sharply: "Stark, I'll go first, you keep behind me at all times."
Tony: Bishop to e3?
And that was that, really. How could Tony say no to that? Heart reeling, he put the sweater on, and then he did his best to put one foot in front of another as he got out of the car, and to breathe. Steve gave him a once-over he must have imagined to be subtle. The guy nodded happily to himself, as if to say
"I'm off to find the crapper," Bucky announced, deliberately crude, and disappeared into the crowd, not fooling anyone as to the purpose of his escape. Natasha rolled her eyes, but her gaze lingered on his retreating back for a moment.
Because, of late, he really didn't. After the demerit and with the relations with the tech getting into the whitely heated area, he'd stopped going to the illicit bar. Since the cadets still weren't welcome in the pilots' R&R, he didn't even drink. Unless Rogers was going to lay into him for the war with the tech, in which case... okay. Tony'd handle that too.
for surprise. Using a hand-operated lift, Darryl and two techs were pushing the viper up, up, ever so slowly. Smoke was sloshing around their shins like a ghostly gray ocean. At normal gravity, it wouldn't have worked. The craft was too big, too heavy and unwieldy.
“I told you, I’m not sick,” Steve insisted through chattering teeth as Friday checked his body functions, “I can’t get sick”; and, as Tony was bringing the water to the boil, for coffee, Friday confirmed it: “I’m detecting elevated heart-rate, boss, and periodic muscle cramps. But definitely no fever.”
Barely two minutes passed. Then a small, muffled sound from Tony's direction and: "So, how far are you?"
No, that's not right either. Tony just stood there like a log. Now he wishes he'd said something –
“Tony are you all right?” Steve’s voice sounded worried, somewhere out there, both far away and tantalizingly near.
Tony gave him a grateful look, for some reason. "You think? Hm." He seemed lost in thought for a moment. "Well, I suppose I can talk to Pepper about it." He seemed to change the focus back to the food. "In any case – a lot of this stuff is more or less perishable. It needs eating up."
We were still tentative around each other. It was hard for us to accept this gift we were given – having each other back – as something normal. I used to wake up, drenched in sweat, from dreams of being back in my reality, and all of this being just a dream. I woke to see his sleeping form beside me, and then I would reach out and caress his temple with my knuckles, run fingers through his hair. Usually he wouldn't wake up. He would just roll over to his side, groggily, so that I could spoon him, aware even in his sleep of what I wanted.
I nod again.
"What did he mean, I was just bait?" Tony insisted as they climbed another set of stairs. Steve's breathing wasn't exactly belabored, but for Steve it wasn't natural. He was getting tired. "Put me down," Tony said. "I can manage for a little while. Put me down."
Tony's steps were heavier, now, but Steve's hip was pressed so close to his own, and Steve's head was inclined so that it was touching Tony's as they walked, and really, it should all have been more awkward than it really was.
," Tony said emphatically, catching both Steve's hands in his own. Which might have been a mistake, since they were so big and warm that Tony had to suppress the urge to hug them both to his chest.
, this was where it got
"What, the Stanislavski maneuver again?" Tony said. It wasn't a complaint. More like a gasp for air, honestly. He had to pull himself together, he had to focus. Should he ask for a breather? No, that way he'd have to get up, walk right past Steve in this confined space, and... no, just no. Bad idea.
Since people have definitely noticed them, continuing with the game looks like the only way to go. Sighing inwardly, Tony smiles and snuggles closer to Steve. And just because he's aware that, for him, it's not just a game – well, not exactly, not with being this hyperaware of Steve's solid torso right next to him – Tony is beginning to feel self-conscious and ridiculous. With him, that never ends well. He's pretty sure there's a wave of hysterical babbling coming on, so he strikes a preemptive conversation with a guy in front of him, the one wearing a super-dentist T-shirt. With a Superman 'S' on the back.
But then –
And they weren't, they couldn't, didn't know how to – not to each other, at any rate. When Tony tried to joke around, Steve would draw back or take it the wrong way. When Steve forced himself to try chatting, it sounded stiff and unnatural, and grated on Tony's nerves. Steve wasn't socially awkward otherwise. He had friends among the pilots. He was sometimes downright cordial with  other cadets. It was obviously just Tony he had a problem with.
my heart wanted nothing at all.
Tony: You getting angry again?
The musicians were playing something soft and unrecognizable and vaguely Baroque-like, a violin concerto or other. The people around Tony, even his friends – progressively more relaxed with one another now, joking, laughing, forming and reforming subgroups in a curious, almost observable rhythm – suddenly seemed pale and, to Tony, hard to concentrate on. His mind, his gaze, kept slipping away. It was all happening around him, not
For a moment, Steve suppressed the amusement, then gave up and let it show. He shook his head. "Shouldn't you be in bed, though?" He walked over and put a cup on the desk in front of Tony. "Want some?"
, Tony decided then and there, trying to interpret the look in the blue eyes staring down at him. He wondered how long exactly the man had been there, and how many of Tony's semi-crude remarks he'd overheard. This last one about Hammer was like a cherry on top. Tony was determined not to give two fucks, but the nauseating feeling in his stomach belied this.
He stole a glance into the throng of people, in the direction Steve had disappeared in, but he was not there. Of course he wasn't, what did you expect, he told himself. The crowd in that spot seemed particularly empty and cheerless to Tony.
"No," Tony cuts him off again. He lets Steve rub his head against the handle for a few moments, then it's away from his reach once again.
resentment was growing weaker and more pathetic by the minute, however. So – Steve didn't trust him. So, what else was new? He didn't have to. Sometimes Tony didn't trust himself either, so that was perfectly understandable, wasn't it?
, Tony thumb slides up the slit of his cockhead, and a violent shiver passes through Steve, but then it's gone, the sensation is
, he mused – and gave up. "I already did borrow one. I'll go get it." He hoped he didn't sound too eager, but in the end, there was no helping that, he supposed.
fucking day of skiing and not
Tony: But listen. I've been thinking
Steve felt like he was balancing at the edge of a knife. What he wanted was to get closer to him, get to know him. What he felt he needed to do here was keep his distance. He imagined he managed to fall somewhere in between, a middle of the road, but after what happened today, he thought he was more like a pendulum, swinging wildly between the two points. He wanted to just bury his face in his hands and stay like that, but there lay another road to darkness, so he didn't.
The irregular meals were pushed through the tiny flap at the bottom of the cell door. That was all the contact he had with the outside world. So far, no one had required him to do anything, no one ordered him to make weapons, make the suit, make a bomb, make love not war, make a fool of himself, whatever.
Thor just grinned and sprawled on the bed. The bed squeaked unhappily. "There's enough love here for the whole department," he said. Tony rolled his eyes and laughed together with everyone, and that, he hoped, was that for now. Up until they chose to put itching powder into his sheets or something equally mature.
he thought. It was easier when Steve pushed him away, when he was cold. This was
His legs bent at the knee, Tony lay back. He closed his eyes, drowning, sinking into the feeling of Steve’s lubed up fingers ghosting their way from the sensitive spot at the root of the spine, through Tony’s cleft. They lingered at his anus, circling it once, twice. Then just  the tiniest of pressures; on the verge of sinking in, but no, they were on their way. They reached the spot just behind his balls, and decided to stop there, massaging, harder now. Tony felt the burning echo of the touch
Rhodey frowned for a moment. "Well, at least you got it in the open, finally?"
"Yep. Are you telling me..."
Tony: Eventually.
Tony hadn't come here again since the day they died – not until now. In this place, it hadn't been 25 years.
"Whatever you're making, make it for two."
"You're an ass, Tony," she says. "But you brought food, so I suppose that cancels out."
And yet, and yet, their time seemed unfairly short, and there were so many things left unsaid, and all of a sudden Tony had this urge to say everything he ever wanted to say to him, and had no idea where to begin.
Tony: Look, I even admitted I'm exhausted.
Nine days of Tony's never-ending fretting and snapping and pacing up and down whenever they stopped for the night. Nine days of Clint's incessant sharpening of his throwing knives and his arrowheads, as well as endless adjusting and readjusting of the fletching. Nine days of Bruce alternating between staring into his scrying bowl (yes, even on horseback, not that he'd been a particularly spectacular horseman to begin with) and softly playing ballads on his lyre. Natasha normally thought his music sweet and soothing, but right now she considered strangling him with a string if she heard
"Aw come on. I
Tony: What do you mean 'is it prudent'?
, he thought sternly at himself,
STARK: So, this is... I am really happy to be here with all of you today. Thank you for showing up in such large numbers.
Steve's eyebrows going all the way up. Also, the slight grin in his voice. Tony thought the banter may have been a tad forced, but he had to respect the effort. He was surprised to detect relief in his own heart. At least it wasn't so awkward now. Perhaps they'd waded  through the awkwardness, all the way to the other side. Perhaps that was the easiest answer: to fall back into their old patterns. (Tony had lied; he
Tony: I'm not in any kind of danger, don't worry.
"Private war?" Steve felt a small burst of laughter begin to build. "Wait, that's not the same as
He makes himself open his eyes, unaware that he's closed them. Tony is sucking – very softly – on the head of his cock. Steve can see the side of his face – it tugs at his heart, painfully, the way Tony's sweaty hair is falling into his eyes as he begins his slow descent.
"It's just... time." And then a sliver of uncertainty in his face, something hesitant about his movements brings me back to 2023, and something metallic catches in my throat. I almost wait for him to say it:
, exactly. I
Tony: Steve?
He mustn't pressure Steve.
Tony started listing semi-understandable technical terms, but Steve stopped him with a grunt and gestured to Darryl to tune in to their frequency. In seconds, the channel was overrun by techno-babble. Steve relaxed marginally. He spotted another rescue team, clearing out a huge pile of rubble, calling names loudly.
", Steve repeated, more insistent now. He was still breathing hard, still not moving an inch.
"Did he say something like that to you?" I asked quietly. "Your Steve? Something that made you think it was just a way for you to... to comfort each other? Is that the reason you guys never talked about it later?"
. There was something primal in him that wanted to wrap Tony in a blanket like a burrito and sit him in front of the fire and feed him soup. There was also another part of him that shrugged and thought: It's a common cold, it doesn't make your tongue dysfunctional. You drink a cup of tea, you walk it off. This was decision, not incapacitation.
Darryl regarded him with apparent apathy. "Sir, if you feel like giving him back, I'm perfectly happy to have him."
Tony: I really didn't mean what I said.
Tony: So, Christ, Steve, just try to pull through.
been gun shots in the hubbub, and even though he didn't think Steve had been hit, you never knew.
Tony: I honestly think I should go. This is not good.
Tony: Do you have a handler? I mean, who are you consulting with about the missions, who gets you information?
and he will, just....
"My foot's fine, forget my foot," Tony retorted. The fluttering in his chest was an unwelcome companion. He'd never admit that he liked being fussed over. He wanted for Steve to keep fussing over him while he himself unsuccessfully batted it off. As an impulse, it was completely despicable. "But, eh, thanks," he said, sounding forced even to his own ears.
“Yeah,” Tony confirmed. “A serious, full-fledged case of feelings.”
There is coldness in my stomach, and I'm now becoming aware that, in a way, it's been with me ever since I came here, quietly eating at me. The civil war. We never really talked about it, except to figure out it happened more or less the same way in both our timelines.
“You all right?”, he asked.
Bruce snorted in amusement, though, which was good, because it meant his resistance was being eroded. "We're in a
"Will you tell me what you find out?"
"So, why are you here?" he asked. And his voice wasn't harsh. He wanted to grab Steve by the shoulders and shake his stupid ideals out of him and then kiss him silly, but his voice wasn't harsh.
Tony: Hey yourself. How are you feeling today?
"Okay," Steve whispers, understanding. "Okay, then."
A stab in Tony's gut, that had everything to do with how he was
Before he leaves, Steve observes Morgan with Tony, Morgan with Pepper, for a few moments. He notices the way Pepper's lips tighten when Tony jokes around with the little girl – some adorable Tony nonsense about whom she loves best and inventing a scoring system. He observes, also, how Tony's hand twitches when Pepper starts to reprimand Morgan about the impolite way she greets Steve, and also when Morgan knows what her Mom is about to say and corrects her behavior almost too quickly. Already, Morgan is two slightly different people, one for each parent. But perhaps that would have happened regardless of the divorce. Perhaps there is some super secret father-daughter space where mothers are not invited; perhaps there is a certain mother-daughter wordless symbiosis in which everyone is a third wheel, even Dad. Maybe things even out in the end; or, then again, maybe not.
Tony: Natasha knows how to contact me, Steve.
, Tony wanted to say,
But this, he thought, this is easy. All he needed to do was find Tony and tell him the truth.
"And I," Steve replied, "have come to regret mine. So I'm asking you to stay."
he told himself.
there any light to see in here?"
He stops, breathing hard. Opens his mouth to say something else, but instead he tastes rain on his tongue and waits.
I've seen different explanations and, so to say, conspiracy theories as to what took place. And, the way we used to do this was... You know the drill, some things are state secrets, some things are state secrets of other countries, so you are even less allowed to talk about
The dildos on display in the third cupboard wouldn't be so bad, perhaps, if there was a drop of lube to be found anywhere. There isn't. Together with the fact that there is not one vibrator in the room, no wand massagers, nothing meant to simply give pleasure – just pain – only one conclusion is possible: this is not someone's fun room. This is a torture chamber.
When Steve was sick as a child, his mom would sometimes read to him, when she had time. This wasn't like that at all and it was a silly idea. Firmly, he stomped on it. Stared at the page. Sneaked a look at Tony, who had now turned around and seemed to be blinking at him. In the firelight, his eyes looked huge.
He needed to talk to Tony about that kiss, because it had made Steve's heart swell and expand and float like a gas balloon, in those few seconds it had lasted. And now this... nothingness.
"I kind of made you say it, didn't I?"
, Tony thought at himself furiously.
Today. Today he'd let himself go. He was careless. It was as if he turned his rational self off and a stupid brainless Steve had taken over. A disaster almost happened. No, a disaster
"I want..." Steve began hoarsely, trailing off mid-sentence as if he couldn't be bothered to finish it, as if there was no point. And then his
He arched an eyebrow. "Yeah, you mentioned it," and then. "Or – you know,
All the legalities of having Steve back in the U. S. have, when prodded and string-pulled into submission, taken shorter than anyone would have thought, but it still seemed long.
"I can manage prep", Steve said indignantly. "Natasha trained me. I can follow instructions."
Tony: Is someone hurt?
And sometimes the world was so horrible he just wanted to bury himself in Malibu sand and stay there forever.
the voice of the gala announcer drifted languidly through the half open door of the waiting room where his group was assembling.
And then he looked at me for a moment. He must have misinterpreted my morose silence, because he said: "Are you leaving?" It wasn't exactly a small voice, I don't think Tony could do small voice even if he wanted to.
"Okay," he whispered. All the objections he'd been going to voice suddenly seemed irrelevant. Someone might hear? Who cared. If they opened the cell door, he and Steve could probably kick their ass. Even if that wasn't the case, virtually anything was better than idly sitting here.
Tony still doesn't know how Fury talked him into this.
"Oh god, I can't," Tony grunts, and then his other hand is opening his own zipper. He fumbles, pulls himself out frantically. Steve's gaze is plastered to his cock, red and swollen. Tony grips it, strokes himself roughly, once, twice, fighting for breath.
The receptionist squees with delight. "You two are
Tony: It devastated you.

Tony: It's strangely cathartic. Having actually talked about it. Don't you think?

Tony told himself what he felt was impatience. Definitely not jealousy. That would be ridiculous. Daisy was a very pretty woman, though. And it seemed everyone
This surprised a laugh out of Tony. "Oh you don't
Of all things in the permeating sense of urgency, Tony really didn't have time to worry about the uncalled-for stab of hurt at this. Thor turned to the right.
Tony: You. Nat, Clint. Bruce. Mostly you.
And then, for a moment, the sun disappeared from the sky and they were cast in a giant shadow and everything in the world changed.
Tony: You know, I keep thinking how I should have found this out earlier. About the super-soldier serum. About the experiments. Technically, I had all the data. And I KNEW how awfully invested Ross was in having a superpowered team at his back and call, essentially. That was what he wanted, that was what he tried to make happen. By any means necessary.
Tony: It used to be unbearable. But I got years of experience on you, buddy.
Rhodey's eyes seemed to have wondered off, back to Carol. He made a visible effort to re-focus, but evidently missed the point completely. "Good for you," he told Tony with an encouraging nod.
Tony’s chest swelled with unbearable feelings. How much could four words ache all of a sudden, he wondered. And another part of his mind, the one that was usually on its merry way, analyzing this or that, produced another thought. Lust made people do weirdest things to you, wonderful or possessive or filthy. It made them kiss you and bite you and touch you and claim you and even hurt you a little. But only someone who loved you ever wanted to simply pet your hair.
"I'd... not be opposed to the idea of having sex with you." Steve manages to sound strangely formal, even though his voice has gone even more gravelly. "But only if you wanted it," he adds quickly. "Only if you would have wanted it
With no hesitation, Tony starts to pull it out then,  but not as slowly. All the way out to the first knuckle, than the little twist again, and it's back in, sharper now, more resolute. He sets a more relentless pace, then, in and out, in and out, not bothering much with subtlety. And it's on the verge of being too much, that cold finger invading Steve's insides, poking, stretching him, carelessly, twisting this way and that. Steve squirms and gasps and feels the
This makes her roll her eyes. She peers over the edge of the fort, surveying the situation, then ducks back. Tony gets the impression her heart is not really in the snowball fight. "You could have dropped by anytime before, you know" she says. "Even when you weren't screwing Steve."
, it erased all the other thoughts from Tony’s mind, and he ushered him inside.
Tony: Hey?
Tony: That was you, wasn't it?
The phone on the back seat was ringing, but Tony was obviously ignoring it. Steve didn't ask.
ed thoughtfully.
He hesitated in front of Captain's office before entering, took a breath, tried to brace himself.
Tony: You know what, I'm sorely tempted to say: You asshole, ONLY NOW??

"Tranquilizer gun," he said. "In the end."

Steve thought secretly, so secretly that it was almost a secret from himself.

As in many other things, we were far too similar for our own good. I put my arms around him and pulled him onto my chest. He tucked his head under my chin. That was all I could offer: a silent comfort.
Steve refrained from shrugging. "Sir. Thank you for your recommendation, I will consider it."
"Okay, let's try to find out when the divergence was," I said slowly. "You went to space after Thanos. We lost. You came back, with Carol and Nebula. Right?"
"Aw, come on,
"See, you do know how to teach," he commented off-handedly, because that just meant he didn't care one bit, didn't it. "Don't know why you even have me doing it when you're good at it."
at Steve that he let this happen at all. Tony knew that was completely irrational.
Tony: I really hate you.
But no, the time didn't slow down. Some of the last guests lingered to watch – the two of them, always a spectacle, whether they were fighting or making up. Still, the people had mostly left, and now it was only their closest friends and teammates, waiting for them. There were cries of "Now, really? As if they didn't have the whole evening," and "Hush, Barnes," and "No, seriously, I can never figure out if they like or dislike each other," and "Let me quote facebook for you, Scott: It's complicated," and "They love each other, really," and "I'm telling you, it's Kyrumption!".
Those words, coming from Steve, warmed him like sunlight. And they shouldn't; if they came from someone else, they wouldn't have. They'd have rang empty and Tony wouldn't have given a fuck about them, but from
winter gear, but with a different function in mind. A function of hiding his face. Only then did Tony notice a gun. It was so out of place in the whole Hallmark movie setting that its presence simply couldn't fit into his head.
Tony was faster. Almost automatically he interposed himself between the robber and Steve, raising his hands as non-threateningly as he could, at the same time planning half a dozen moves that Happy would have called dirty. "Stay there," he hissed at Steve, and to the robber he started saying: "Okay, okay there, buddy, we can talk about this. Let's talk about this. What you want to do right now is..."
"Yeah?"
Tony: Tentatively, unwillingly okay from this side too. Since I have to.
"And you're here," he finished for me, gently. That seemed to give him another idea, though, and in that he was also exactly like my Tony – one moment he could be pensive, and all of a sudden, an idea later, he was all action, all at once. He lit up with a sudden onslaught of inner energy.  "How
Tony: Did you think I dropped this into the conversation to guilt-trip you for not telling me? Really?
Tony: Are YOU?
Natasha snorts. "I'll have salad."
And then the finger inside him twists slightly, pressing inwards, as if Tony is screwing it into him. It's an all new sensation then, all new places being touched, stretched. Steve can't help it, he gasp sharply. And he is sure the whole finger must be inside now, but when he looks, he sees it's only in to the second knuckle, which seems impossible, at this moment, seems impossible that something that feels so unwieldy and unyielding inside him could go any further in. Tony gives him a short look, maybe checking on him, so Steve nods, just in case. And then it's pressure again, one quick slide, one burst of discomfort, and it's in.
He drummed his fingers on the tabletop for a moment, staring at them. "Some families celebrate together," he said slowly, "and they love it, and it's great. Or I suppose it is. A family holiday and all that. And some families are too broken for that, so they don't bother. But there are families that pretend they work, for one reason or another, and then they go through the motions, painfully, once a year, until the torture becomes unbearable; and you're a kid, and you know it's all fake, but you have to be there, you've got no choice, and you have to say all the correct words and, all the correct phrases, and you have to have the correct expression on your face, and you can't mess it up, otherwise you're unleashing hell. So, yeah. There you go.
it to turn out that way. I...”
Tony frowned. Once he'd spotted Steve in that ice hole, he'd stopped paying attention to the animal. He'd forgotten about it completely, as a matter of fact. "It was... alive," he said, unable to remember anything else. They stayed like that, for a moment, staring into each other's eyes, holding onto each other's arms; not quite hugging, but not quite...
. Then he pointed out of the huge ballroom they were in, in the direction of one of the smaller drawing rooms... And Steve didn't really hear the rest of the directions, because he was politely interrupted by T'Challa, hand in hand with Storm, and then they all had to chat for a while. Rhodey still kept sneaking glances at Carol. Steve wondered what that was all about.
Tony: Not rubbish. And you weren't bothering me.
Had he been cured from the thing, he wouldn't have ended up nearly so hurt and enraged. How dare Steve do that? How dare he... crush Tony's idealized image of him and prove to be
"I... miss not being on my own," Tony said after a minute's thought,  "which is, as you can imagine, not the great romantic statement one's partner longs to hear." He sighed, seemed to shake something off. "I don't really want to talk about my divorce." Okay, well, that was that, then. "Take some soup, Steve. Hell, take
"And then you came to rescue me," Tony said slowly. "All alone."
Tony: So maybe I just wanted to hear you say it wasn't on me.
Chances are, he probably didn't know how Tony felt about him. It's a fact that took me months of talking to
Tony: Do proceed.
Steve opens his mouth to say what he's always longed to say, what he now came here to say.
The familiar thrill that ran through him, so intense he almost shivered physically. He opened the one from Tony.
With what?"
The idea had snuck up on him at a weirdest moment, after he woke Bruce up and went behind the outhouse to throw up for a bit, for fun. And he couldn't start to explain to himself how come he never thought of
Tony: I'm still reeling with a ton of different shit coursing through my brain, and half of it I didn't even know was there.

Tony: And he wanted the government to have a superpowered army, so he gave it a one-man army.
Five years, I thought. Everything else aside – because I had to put it aside, I couldn't deal with the question of them having sex right then – that meant they made up five years earlier. This Steve had had five years more with Tony. Or, well – maybe not
She cocked her head in thought. "Nah, you're more like the bad boy the heroine fools around with before she picks the good guy for good. Or it'd be like that if I
STARK: No. Not as far as I know. God, I hope not. I miss him. I wish he'd come back.
