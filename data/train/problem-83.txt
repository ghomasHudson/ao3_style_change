Gods, he loved parties.
“Course you are,” John murmured, closing the distance to the detective and shoving him onto the exam table. The motion caused Sherlock to release a loud belch as he sat. The usually fierce detective was watching John with wide eager eyes.
The detective beamed, nodding wildly and extending his hand for John to put the ring on, then tugging the doctor up by his coat, the seams audibly straining, and pulling him into a crushing, passionate kiss
He heard John's resultant sharp intake of breath and smirked. Then he stripped out of his pajamas, leaving only a highly strained pair of pants left, digging into soft hips and causing perfectly squeezable love handles to bloom over top. Sherlock stepped onto the scale and heard it whir and spin wildly. John was at his side, bending around his mass, one hand stroking along the detective's round gut, his thumb pinching slightly, forming a roll that he could grip and knead.
God... if the detective knew that he hadn't taken an actual run in over a month. If he knew that John had instead spent that time eating and stuffing himself full at a shop of his choice... He crunched into more toast, humming softly. He snuck a glance at Sherlock. He was pleased to see the man eating as well. He like watching actually, that elegant neck bobbing, the jawline moving softly... It made him look less severe, more approachable.
The swelling in Sherlock’s tummy starts to go down, his thighs thickening and ass rounding out further underneath him. The detective blinks back out of his submissive, fuzzy state. He blushes again, darker this time, and clears his throat.
"You mean you..." Sherlock reached out, heat rushing southward as he rubbed a hand over the dome of John''s belly.
Sherlock turned over in bed.
"My Sherlock Holmes. I think I will rather like being your John. Shall I take your last name? Or come up with my own. I rather think I would like to stay." He grinned. "As long as you can feed us both."
Sherlock came with a cry.
"Maybe I should go run. I did eat a bit more for breakfast than usual."
This chapter and onward is nsfw. Here be smut.
The question was met with silence.
"Well that's good to hear, though I don't know why you hang on to that terrible job," Sherlock teased, rising to get a second cup of tea, "And yes! Greg has known Mycroft almost as long as he's known me, and my brother has held quite the crush on him since their very first meeting. Of course what with Greg's marriage and subsequent divorce, I assume my brother was just...just giving Greg a little...time"
He grinned, grabbing the ocean of vanilla that was his gut with both hands. He wobbled it against John's own caramel Dream, purring with nothing short of lust.
He'd stripped off his shirt, hunting about in his closet for the tiniest pair of shorts he could find. He put them on and laid back, reveling as each bite brought his bulging gut closer and closer to bursting the button - a massive sphere swelling out of his otherwise skeletal frame.
When he woke the next morning, John felt positively massive and hardly any less full than when he'd gone to bed. He grunted and rubbed his belly slightly. Then he remembered his plan and got out of bed as quickly and as quietly as he could. He turned on the light in the bathroom to make it seem like that was where he was. He climbed up the stairs to his old room where he had stashed the costume and put it on. He eyed himself in the mirror, rubbing a hand over his much, much rounder middle thoughtfully. It was actually looking a touch tight!
He felt so good, so full, so...
. Everything about this house is so
"Hm... I think so yeah," he murmured, kissing him gently, "I like having a bit more weight I can throw around. And if you like it... well. I think I can gain as much as I like."
John was watching him, rather slyly. Sherlock stopped rubbing and withdrew his hand, blushing.
He turned around. "Jesus..."
“Good,” the ex-army doctor rumbled, kissing and nibbling at Sherlock’s neck, “Have another doughnut.”
"You like eating until you're a great fat hog, a real squealer, too," John murmured, before he drew back his hand again to slap the voluptuous globes that were starting to grow slightly pink at the treatment.
"This was... Oh John, this was amazing. Brilliant," he complimented, kissing the doctor's...
Sherlocks lips tingled, as if the kiss was happening. His fingers were lost in John's sandy hair, teeth nibbling playfully at the man's perfectly round, soft jawline. Biting those fatty chins.
"Sure you won't crush the desk, fat arse?" John asked, though he rather liked the idea.
The footage began with someone holding a photograph of a tanned, blonde, remarkably fit man in a tiny bathing suit bound to a chair, smiling, eyes hungry. Then a voice faded in, the photo being pulled away to reveal the same, now clearly former, model. Skin paled, blonde locks slightly shaggier, a small dusting of hair around what was now a prominent gut, which spilled into the once-fit man's lap, oozing across his chunky thighs, bathing suit straining over his wide, voluptuous hips
Sherlock let out pleased squeal as he was crushed, moaning as he felt John's weight settled on top of him. He nodded, a little shyly, blush on his cheeks.
The detective looks at John again and laughs.  "John, this has been... I nearly popped... I ate a bed... I’m fat and... and I think that-"
," he teased, murmuring and panting in Sherlock's ear.
A video - specifically a distinctly kinky video, had caught shadows of their suspect through the windows of the couples' flat. The camera over the man bound to a dining room chair revealed a tall figure in the flat across loading items into a bag, and the gentlemen had been kind enough to give said footage to the police.
“Greg.”
“I’m afraid my dear Gregory is much the same,” Mycroft adds fondly, now striding towards the DI and cupping his chubby cheek in his fat fingers. “Such a plump spoiled thing you’ve become.”
“Naughty,” the taller man growls, his eyes alight with a spark of danger, a smirk curling his softened features. He should look cherubic with those round plump cheeks and a thick ring of chins around his jaw, but somehow he only looks more dangerous, his dark curls like the halo of some dark prince of gluttony; a heavy rhino about to charge. Unstoppable.
' Theres a round of laughter from the group, the boy has obviously flexed. "
He’s not hungry, he’s not hungry, he’s not hungry.
"Is Chismas," he giggled.
He squinted at his mobile, confused. Was this.. Was he trying to flirt or invite him over?
"John, you are wearing far too many clothes." The chubby noble grinned. He rolled his wide arse, daring to puff out his pudgy middle.
"It was...I'm impressed," Sherlock stammered, "And it’s just one day, John.Plus, I managed to finish mine too.”
He tramped up the stairs and pushed the door open. Well. Best to go all in. He let out a resounding jolly laugh.
"Alright. I do," he admitted, surrendering himself to soft sighs and gasps and moans as John fully worshiped his over sensitive middle. It was difficult to determine which of them was getting the bigger treat tonight.
Sherlock noted the flush in his flatmate's cheeks when he returned and cast an eye around, wondering if there was an officer who'd imbibed a few too many doughnuts around. That seemed the most likely solution. He then lazily told Gavin the solution that had been so very obvious and turned to John.
though," Sherlock giggled, his fingers tickling at the doctor's six-pack abs beneath his red suit.
"A-and if I...if I did?" He murmured, "Would you...what would you do?" Sherlock bit his lip, arms slipping out to squeeze at the fattened solider's prominent love handles.
"Lucky me," John purred, kissing his way down the man's chest and belly as the buttons sprang free under his fingers. He paused to nuzzle and nibble at the soft flesh of the man's middle, careful not to pierce his skin. Not yet.
“So fucking rude, Sherlock,” John rumbled, jabbing at his bloated belly, and the detective shivered and nodded.
Sherlock's gaze flicked back to the truly jolly man before him. Thick, meaty arms framing a set of fattened pectoral muscles, shelved above a massive gut, one that arched out of the shorter man's frame and truly shook like a bowl of jelly when the man laughed.
"You may call me... John. I think. " The demon mused. "Just because I like you."
John swallowed, looking up at his detective, at his lover, at his Sherlock, his life. The question on his lips was all at once so simple and so profound.
Moriarty leans his arms back to stretch them above his head, his chair creaking noisily. The eyes in the wall focus in as every button on his white, buttoned, shirt goes flying without the master criminal even noticing.
There was a rustle of shopping bags as John entered 221B. The ex-army doctor strolled past where his flatmate turned lover lay sprawled over the sofa. John smiled as he noted that for once, Sherlock was asleep. The consulting detective's mouth was open and he was snoring just a little, a crumb filled plate beside him signifying the new change in opinion on food the lanky man had developed recently. His position also highlighted the tiniest pinch of softness that was clinging to the area around Sherlock's navel, creating the softest of roundings under a still quite apparent ribcage. Though that seemed to be slipping under new flesh quite nicely as well.
Greg moaned.
"Hm..." he mumbled, looking at the piece, "That's... that's what did it then?"
"Sorry, boys! Change of plan! Greatest weakness you know, but I like to think it can work well in certain evolving situations!" declares a bright cheery tone with only coldness behind it.
"I...I did," Sherlock responded, shifting lightly at the prodding, arching his gut against John's fingers.
John purred, groaning softly as the man folded into him, as if his touch were the most perfect thing in existence. He pressed his soft plush pillow of a belly into Sherlock, leaning but not following as Sherlock stepped back. He cocked his head slightly, his triple chin folding and squashing under his jaw.
John squeezes Sherlock’s hand warmly, comfortingly. "I..." his voice trails off. He still can't say it. "I
"It doesn't... not at all. Sherlock... God, Sherlock come here," he said, almost launching himself across the bed, belly jiggling with the swiftness of his movement. He kissed the detective hard.
It’s a hallway and, while there's a definite clicking and shuffling at the end of it, Sherlock just can’t move anymore. The detective pants breathlessly, sobbing very hard, stomach feeling like he has swallowed a dozen razor blades.
“John… You know there is no one else on this entire planet that I want to plow me besides you,” Sherlock continued lazily.
"Well, well, Dr. Watson. What's the meaning of this?" a cold, gruff ,voice drawls, "Attention!" The room falls silent as the patients freeze, arms still outstretched, but now motionless as string-less marionettes.
Shit. Okay. So Sherlock is here. He's alright. He's moving. John feels a rush of relief and makes his way over to another doorway. As soon as he crosses the threshold the door slams shut behind him and John sinks back into a crouch. Lights flicker and come back up.
"Fuck," he grunted, then realized he had said it quite loudly.
"How many questions? Shall we make an amendment to your deal? For each question, you will owe me one course of a meal. I do hope you have enough to feed me, enough questions to give me a feast. And then yes. I will gladly take your body..." His eyes roved the mortal's hungrily, eyes shining blue.
"Take me, take me please" He moaned
Sherlock fared no better, having settled down beside the man, their fat sides quickly squashing further and further against one another. His buttons had flown off rapidly, one after the other, after the finishing of his ninth helping. His wide, pale gut billowed out in front of his, pants button long gone, and zipper snapped by the surge of flesh that occurred so quickly. His chest had ballooned out in soft, supple breasts, which rested lightly on his massive gut.
holiday full of lies perpetrated by foolish parents and stupid elder siblings."
"You okay?" he pants, still feeling rage burn through him, "Let's go. Don't you fucking eat another bite. Got it?"
He hurriedly re-did his pants, grabbing a copy of the tape and wandering toward the restroom in search of his flatmate.
He crept down the hall as quietly as he could, making for Greg's office. And oh.
"And only getting fatter. What with
"Good, piggy," John praised, feeding Sherlock more and more, rubbing at the mans' huge belly, still amazed that it was there.
Sebastian Moran gave the door another hard shove with a massive shoulder and felt it surrender. He tugged down the ball cap he was wearing and flicked his cigarette onto the sidewalk that was the signal. Sure enough, a sleek car soon slid up along the sidewalk. He glanced up to ensure he hadn't missed any of the security cameras earlier. Well, they'd need to be quick. The prissy older Holmes would throw a fit as soon as he learned his brother wasn't being monitored.
"Sherlock?" He breathes, voice barely above a whisper. John’s hand goes automatically to his belt. He’s surprised, but relieved, to find his gun there.
This area is brightly lit, colorful to the point of being nauseating, and there's happy, childish music playing over some sort of loudspeaker. The "bean-bag chair" in the corner looks to be an enormous cinnamon bun. The happy-face clock on the wall, a sugar-cookie with icing. The table - made of what seems to be fudge - has small bowls filled with gummy bears and peanut-butter cups. Something flutters in the detective’s heart, a sense of childhood he’d never allowed himself. Then something gurgles in his midsection. The stomach he had denied all these sweets growing up wanting just a taste of all the happy treats around it.
John’s belly aches. But he finishes a full baker’s dozen of the sugary, fatty, bacon-covered things.
Sherlock bobbed faster and faster on Greg's cock, moaning and squealing in agreement as John thrust into him. He felt his fat body ripple and jiggle around him, knowing he'd never be back to the size he was, and honestly thinking he might want to get even large
He stiffened however as Sherlock's question struck him.
"HUUUUURP!" John replied, sighing with utter relief and settling back against the cab. Sherlock stared at him a moment, then both men collapsed into a fit of giggles.
"Oh yeah? Maybe he's my long lost twin. Sounds like a handsome bloke any way," John said, taking another swig of his drink, "I'll direct him to you if I see him."
"How's that look?"
Darkness consumes his field of vision
"Mm too," Sherlock grunted, breathing rather shallowly, his fingers trembling as they cupped his overfed middle. He felt ready to explode. He looked over at John and found him smiling lazily at him.
"You're... Christ, how did we get so big?" he murmured.
The detective smirks at John’s  light blush, then grabs his hands and moves them to his fat, slightly bare ass.
Sherlock struggles but it’s of no use, and once again his nose is pinned, so he is forced to open his mouth to the faucet.
"I..." Sherlock started
John jiggled his
He was getting hard. Fast. And so full. So very full. He shifted carefully, but accepted the pizza as it was offered to him, eating it and pretending to watch the movie. He could feel his shapewear growing tighter with every bite.
"I don't need-"
Sherlock holds out his hand to John.
John growled and spun around, pressing his tits and belly at the man. His belly squashed to either side.
He brought it up to his room and hid everything under his duvet, crisps, little wrapped cakes, biscuits, soda....
"Did you ever get anything out of that tape?" he asked, the thought striking him for the first time since... well. Wow. The kink discovery had completely driven that from his mind. "I didn't see anything unusual."
******
Sherlock rolled his eyes and sipped at his own water. "You could have opted for a soda or water. As I have done."
"M-Maybe, over the desk? I-If Greg g-got on the other side I could...h-have you both at once." The massive detective stammered, blushing wildly
He hoisted the box again, shutting the door with his non-existent, bony arse
"Make myself an attractive suitor. Yes. Though, I admit, I'm rather glad
"You're fucking beautiful like this," Greg panted, looking down all doe eyed and soft at what he could see of Sherlock around his own big jiggly belly. Somehow that fact only made him hotter. He moaned.
So was this treacle. God, how much toffee was in this sticky thing?
"Oof! Watch it," John warned, "Christ, I'm full..."
static
John chuckled, moving closer, trailing a hand along Sherlock's sleeve.
"Tease."
He sipped at his tea. It was delicious, but didn't taste much like tea. He smacked his lips lightly and offered his friend more toast. "Here, care for another?"
"No! I told you,
"You three relax, I'll get the table cleared," said Mrs. Holmes, standing and starting to collect plates.
Sherlock follows the trail of breadcrumbs a bit farther. He hears a voice come over the intercom and actually smiles.
"You're gorgeous," John purred, "And all mine now. Mine forever,
“But-“
Oh God. He needs to get out.
Sherlock steps into the new room.
And so she did. Before long the refrigerator at Saint Bart’s hospital was well stocked and practically overflowing with Sherlock’s favorites. Little cakes and packs of biscuits or crisps were stowed here and there, ready to be seized and shoved into Sherlock’s mouth as a reward for following her directions. Soon it seemed almost as if Sherlock had become an overlarge puppy, eager to please Molly and get a treat for his troubles. That impression was rather confirmed when one day, the detective’s stomach started to growl the moment he set foot in Molly’s morgue. He was hardly rude anymore and was far more polite when it came to asking for organs or blood samples. Oftentimes they perhaps went a little over board. Molly was willing to give Sherlock another pack of biscuits if he asked politely. That was part of his ‘training’ after all so she didn’t see the harm. Although nowadays, Sherlock often left the morgue burping softly with a hand on the swell of his stomach.
"No shifts today?" he asked, feeling companionable. The angry, rude Sherlock seemed to have vanished under so many layers of soft cream, with the detective admitting to not only having friends, but needing them
John feels his mouth go oddly dry at that, his fingers pressing into Sherlock’s softened flesh as they squeeze out of the door and onto a green hillside.
"Oh, yeah. We can try. And Yeah... Greg could come," said John, feeling slightly concerned. Well... he could surprise Sherlock in the morning then. The others were bound to notice. Harry would have a field day if she came and saw her brother gone all soft like this.
“You seemed like you were having a good time,” John says, still feeling tetchy. It comes out a bit more accusatory than he intended.
He’s in Sherlock’s bed, a tangle of fluffy bedding wound around his feet. He’s naked and very much alone: Sherlock is not in the bed, and John feels immediately certain that he’s not in the loo, either. He’s gone.
Sharon perks up. “Is that the one in meeting room 3B? I’m in that one, too!”
Sherlock switches off the engine and gets out. “Let’s have a look, then,” he proposes. The fields on either side of the road look innocent enough, stretching out in either direction with little to break the horizon save the slight roll to the land itself. There are no hedges or trees bordering the narrow lane, just open field. “Whoever received the parachuter must know this territory well,” he comments. “Obviously it would have been faster to make their escape in a vehicle, yet they must have walked.”
They’re too close; John will feel his heart beating at this proximity. “Okay,” Sherlock says unevenly.
John gives her a hard stare, silently ordering her not to even
“No,” Sherlock begins, and John looks at him and takes over.
“I thought I was going to be late,” Linda tells them. “They couldn’t seem to decide which workshop to put me in for this session.”
Sherlock appears in the doorway of the kitchen, though, leaning against the frame of the sliding doors, his arms crossed over his slim frame. “Something decaffeinated, perhaps.”
My breath comes out in a rush, my heartbeat doubling. “Do I know… them?”
“Aha! Therapy’s working, then,” Andrew says, sounding triumphant.
Sherlock comes out of the loo and joins him, crossing his arms. “I never asked if you if you have a preferred side,” he says, his voice sounding almost conversational, but John can hear the tension still there underneath.
Sherlock goes quiet, thinking. After a moment, he says, his voice low, “I’m clean, John. If that’s what you’re worried about.”
John scowls and takes another long sip. “I wasn’t about to let her drug Rosie, for fuck’s sake.”
“Do you want me to go first?” Sherlock asks, but John shakes his head.
(Avoid nodding, definitely.) “Yes,” Sherlock says. They’ve stopped moving, which makes it feel much more as though John is just standing there with his arm around him. It’s dangerously pleasant. Sherlock leans into it very slightly, though this is also becoming a necessity. “I’m doing my utmost to keep her as safe as possible,” he says, aware that his speech is still slurring.
, was only half a life, and that included the part involving Mary. He’d really thought that John was only hiding the truth from himself, that whatever existed between the two of them was the core of both their lives. He almost made reference to John’s action having been something of a mere gesture the day they went to Magnussen’s studio as they discussed his own ruse concerning Janine:
Whatever it meant, Harry drops the subject. “It smells divine up here,” she comments instead. “Are you two actually cooking?”
John gets up and comes around the table and inserts himself into Sherlock’s lap in a manner which is anything but submissive. “I really must,” he says, smiling into Sherlock’s eyes, and it’s the last they speak for a goodly while after that.
Sherlock is lying draped over him, heavy and relaxed in sleep, his back rising and falling steadily, the fluffy blankets halfway down his long back. His head is lying on John’s shoulder, and John’s heart gives a fierce throb of feeling as he remembers that Sherlock proposed last night – rather casually, but in absolute earnest – and he said yes! They’re going to get married. Somehow this rather spectacular detail just seemed to blur into the rest of the amazing things that happened last night as just a natural occurrence amid all the other talking they did. Of course they should get married; it just makes sense. But thinking of it now, it strikes John with renewed wonder and a thrill of joy so poignant it takes his breath away. After everything, Sherlock not only still wants him, but even wants to
The kettle comes to a boil and Sherlock points toward it and retreats to make their tea. “Covent Garden,” he calls, pouring hot water. “The condo he’s renting is close by.”
But then, when John had recalibrated and asked about a boyfriend, he’d only said
affect your friendship?”
“Who was fired last?” John asks.
They’re in the kitchen now. Sherlock wanted to examine the perimeter of the building first, looking for tracks, prints, and probably the specific composition of the soil or something, John doesn’t know. It’s been two hours and Sherlock has made them go through several rooms in great detail, detail which so far hasn’t turned up a damned thing. Now they’re all in the rather nice kitchen of this rather nice Hampstead Heath place and Sherlock is going through the cupboards and drawers, occasionally uttering a single word, as though to himself, but John is duly jotting them down in his little notebook, just in case.
“Yes,” he says, and that’s all that needs saying for the time being. They lie there in each other’s arms, their bodies coming down from the high, and eventually, they sleep.
Sherlock feels for him. “Over the past few years, on occasion you’ve had a couple leave during the week,” he says. “All of these leavings are now being considered potential abductions. There was one this week: Jeremy Davidson, from our group.”
“Turns out they were the remains of a boy named Matthew Grant, who had gone missing about a month prior,” Sherlock is telling Desmond. “Molly estimated the time of death to have been about three months after the fire and our relocation.”
Eric takes Colin’s head with both hands and holds it in place, then begins to thrust into Colin’s mouth, deeply, groaning as he does so. “Fuck, that feels so good – ” he gets out, and on the other side of the circle, Sherlock notices that one of the men he doesn’t know is sporting an extremely visible erection, sweat shining at his temples. Brad and Doug are grasping one another’s knees in manly silence, but there’s vein straining in Brad’s temple.
They’re facing the Plaza Hotel and Sherlock turns to him. “I went ahead and booked us a room here,” he confesses. “Thinking about it, I didn’t really want to go back to our hotel. I hired Aston to pack up our things and have them sent over. Do you mind?”
Sherlock’s laugh comes out his nose. “Definitely,” he agrees. “We’ll do some shopping. Meanwhile, all of the hotels I looked at will have more than enough of the basic amenities. Though we may want some… supplemental materials.”
And so he goes to the Landmark to meet John. He must.
Sherlock studies him. “Sure?”
“I accept,” Sherlock says promptly. “What else?”
He gets everyone’s attention again, then says, “Now: Sherlock and John have been very clear about the fact that they don’t want too much talking. If I may quote our famous detective, ‘speeches are boring, Kyle. No one wants to listen to half the wedding party bungle some half-arsed, badly-written, probably-insulting nonsense’.” He stops and grins as everyone laughs.
! This is more than fine!” John pants, his fingers in Sherlock’s hair. “I mean – do you like this? Do you want – ?”
He’d tossed the phone away, opened his arms to the void, and let himself
His eyes go to Sherlock and linger, and John thinks he looks rather melancholy and doesn’t understand why. Before he can ask, though, Mycroft goes on.
The silence between them is intensely awkward, neither of them looking at the other. After an agonisingly long time, John speaks. “If you want – if you think I should leave, I’ll… understand,” he says, his voice sounding like an empty husk of itself.
Mycroft clears his throat, obviously uncomfortable. “We did the best we knew at the time,” he says, quietly. “It was a terrible time for all of us. For our family.”
Sherlock takes another breath, but stops and looks down at his hands. “We hadn’t… acknowledged that it wasn’t the first time that that had happened. To me, I mean. Waking up like that.” He grimaces, still looking down. “It was humiliating. I was already painfully cognisant that the planned-for month was – is – coming to an end, and I knew that I was dreading it. I knew that people would probably say that I’ve grown dependent on you to be there with me, to stave off the nightmares. I knew that anyone, possibly including you, would probably say that it was unhealthy, and I was dreading having to have that conversation when the month ended. Dreading having you leave.”
Sherlock makes a derisive sound. “Oh, please,” he says. “You’re probably right, though. They’re so funny when they try. Now: to deduce where he wants us to go. Do you expect he thinks we’ve cottoned on by now?”
new experiences. I’ve never done what we just did before, either. I can’t tell you how – how much it made me feel, too.”
“Demanding, aren’t you?” he says mildly, trying to ignore his budding arousal beneath the covers. It’s hardly appropriate around an infant.
John looks both amused at this, but also concerned, looking back at Ella and waiting for her to answer. “It’s a large topic,” she says. “Have you discussed the particulars of what you would like to try together? What positions, activities, and so forth?”
“How many people reported this one?” John asks, evidently determined to keep up a steady stream of case-related conversation.
Sherlock makes a thoughtful sound. “Which hospital was she taken to after the shot?” he asks.
Mycroft shakes his head. “I’m sorry, Sherlock,” he says, and it’s as humble as John has ever heard him. “We didn’t know what else to do for you. It was one of the doctors’ suggestions. Our parents were in no state to make any sort of decision, so Rudy and I made it in the end. I didn’t know it would take so much from you. I’m sorry.” He shifts his weight. “But you see, then, this is why I’ve always maintained that you couldn’t possibly have a memory palace. I suspected that the damage was too great.”
"There are still some empty seats, why didn't you buy the..."
A telephone rings in the kitchen and the woman gets up, apologizing automatically. The doctor loudly sighs, as if this heavy atmosphere had led him to forget how to breathe, and falls against the sofa's pillow too, turning his head toward his friend who explains immediately:
It's a matter of pride of course, but when his thumb slides on the screen of his mobile, it's of the hospital room that he thinks about and the way Clara made him understand that she, too, could take care of the elder Watson. And, really, John always knew that. But years to undergo the pressure to be the
And this time, the air returns and the music chokes. John stands, fists tightened against his thighs, eyebrows furrowed and his mouth pinched. He looks at Sherlock and
John sits down a bit farther and bends over the rail to look at the scene below him. Automatically, his eyes go to the only empty chair next to which sits a music stand and a horn. It's not the one Sherrer used to play, of course. This one rests, covered with blood, in Scotland Yard's basement.
As some of you may already know, I'm publishing this story on FanFiction too -- but I soon will stop. Here are the reasons I wanted to share with you too, this concern the fanfiction world in general :)
“No way, pull over.” His voice is firm, Afghan spices tickle his nostrils.
"You're from Kosovo?"
“It's called a cigar-lighter, but yes. Why?”
He watches the long white body -
"And that you'd watch my legs."
, you say something... But of course, you are like that."
"Yes."
10:20 PM
Sherlock. Sherlock
Moriarty shrugs in his turn, seeming to say 'No big deal' when he takes off the safety and John screams without any sound coming out of his mouth. His head is spinning and that has nothing to do with high. Sherlock is so far away and Moriarty's gun so close, it should be the other way around. Something needs to happen, anything, a bloody miracle but they haven't told Mycroft nor Lestrads they were coming here. Since one year John thinks he's slowly coming out of that pool, while everyday that followed only were a hateful echo to what happened over there: John on the ground, Sherlock pointed at, Moriarty controlling everything.
"Wait, what do you want me to do?"
"Sherlock, how were you able to come and take my ties while I was in my room?"
"About Elisa? Because it's a problem that I know her? Sherlock, what's going on between her and Greg?"
10:06 PM
"That the bullet touched the back of the skull, of course we saw that ourselves. But if Sherrer wasn't looking at his score, he wasn't looking at the conductor either. John, what do you see in the horn?" asks Sherlock, pointing at the instrument. Even if this time the detective speaks with a clear voice, it's enough to stop the doctor's heartbeat, only one second.
Of course he's not listening to the doctor, he's struggling on the sofa on which he eventually stretches out, John on his knees near him, hands mixed with his to try to unstick the fingers. If the blond haired-man doesn't manage to completely close the screen, at least, he prevents his flatmate from opening it enough to see the video. Good thing their shouts are muffling the groans of both actors.
"Delighted to hear that. And may I know why?"
when Sherlock’s teeth close on his bottom lip. It feels like a punishment and John lets himself be pushed around.
"Well, I didn't want us to stay too long... There might have been other firings and a widespread panic over there. Ben has difficulty walking, we had to get out as quickly as possible."
"Ah, you g-go horse-riding?" asks Benjamin.
"... Yes."
This was without counting on Mike Stamford and his own need to find a flat, before he had to go back to East Barnet due to a lack of money. It was now a daily occurrence that he was losing his breath during the chase of a black coat at the pursuit of a criminal. But that wasn't the worst part, of course; the adrenaline and the madness of the moment were always creating a primary and vital need to run, catch, and
John sticks against the wall behind his flatmate and puts a hand over his own mouth to prevent himself from making the slightest noise and it's crazy that the reflexes he learnt in Afghanistan can come to life in this apartment in the center of London.
"It's just that..."
"He said so, however."
“Don't wait for me.”
Benjamin briefly shakes his head to make them understand he's okay, has a half-smile which he gives to his mother reassuringly, and John takes advantage when Lestrade bends to see him to turn toward Sherlock. He wants to murder him only with his look and to promise him all at once with his eyes that Sherlock will pay for it, but the attitude of the detective is sufficient enough to make him understand that he has already understood his error.
John winces. “Yeah, I know,” he says. “Far too long. Six years too long.”
John disentangles himself gently, successfully this time. He smiles at Sherlock in the dim light of the room. “I don’t mind.” He looks past Sherlock to the red digital numbers on the clock on his night table. “It’s past five,” he says. “No wonder you’re tired. So let’s sleep. Mrs Hudson will take care of Rosie. She already said.” He doesn’t point out that she’s also bound to notice John not being in his bed when she comes, but with a bit of luck, maybe she’ll think he’s just in the loo or something. Otherwise, that could make for an awkward conversation that he’d really rather not have. He nods in the direction of Sherlock’s pillow. “Go on, then,” he directs. “Get yourself comfortable. And I’ll just – be over here.”
Sherlock nods quickly. “Right. Okay.” He pauses, his pupils dilated visibly. “How would you signal that?” he asks, touching his tongue to his lower lip.
this and hoping for it just as much, because I
The flight is long, but John is genuinely excited. He’s never even been to America before, never mind New York City, and he’s prepared to have his senses fully assaulted. They are, immediately so, almost the instant they set foot in JFK and ramping up as their cab speeds along through Queens, passes through a long tunnel beneath the East River, then emerges into the full blare of Manhattan on a summer afternoon. It’s Monday at half-past two local time, though John’s body thinks it’s evening. One might expect that people have jobs to be at, he thinks, all but pressing his face to the smeary cab window, but the pavements are full. Are they all tourists, then? He checks the map on his phone to see where they are: somewhere in east midtown, now in standstill traffic, but inching every few minutes west in the direction of Times Square. He checks the address of the hotel for the dozenth time. Forty-third between Seventh and Eighth. Surely he can memorise that.
Sherlock’s lips twist. “I can see that now. I suppose it’s the same error I made with you and Mary.”
The silence that follows them is rather poignant. John seems to be breathing with some difficulty. “You didn’t want me to marry Mary?” he asks, his voice suddenly very quiet.
“I think we will,” Molly agrees, making her tone a little firmer than she meant. Which of them is she trying to convince? The question asks itself before she can suppress it, and she shivers.
John stares at her, feeling hostility rise in his throat in spite of himself. “No,” he says forcefully. “Sherlock is my colleague. And good friend, yes. My best friend. He was the best man at my wedding.”
Mary exhales. “No,” she says shortly. “Can’t you take a hint, John? I know you’re not the sharpest knife in the drawer but when someone fakes their death, it might just be that they’ve decided they don’t want you in their life anymore. It’s happened to you twice now. I wonder why.”
His anxiety rises as Molly dawdles, but finally she says it back, two seconds remaining on the clock. He can see how much his feigned statement means to her, and he feels terrible. In a rare moment of exacerbated empathy, he imagines himself in her position and hearing John say this to him over the phone. He would believe it, too. The heart defaults toward hope, no matter how unlikely… and to find out it was all a ruse, later… rage rises in Sherlock’s chest and for a few moments he loses control of his temper completely.
John nods. “Okay.” He crosses his arms. He wants to kiss Sherlock more than anything. And then stay down here with him, curl himself around Sherlock from behind and go on touching his incredible body all night long, make him feel new kinds of pleasure that he’s never felt before, never allowed himself to feel before. But this can’t happen: Corey gets to do that, be that. Spend whole nights with Sherlock. John’s the one laying the road to allow it, as he agreed to. God knows he owes him that much, considering some of their history, particularly on his part. No: it’s good that he’s helping Sherlock to have this, if that’s what he wants. He doesn’t regret it. “Good night,” he says, and if his voice comes out a bit tight, Sherlock doesn’t comment on it.
John raises his eyebrows, facing him, their heads on the same pillow. “Yeah?”
“Point?” John still can’t manage coherent speech.
John nods. “Yeah. We’re good now,” he says simply. No need to rub Corey’s face in the details of how disgustingly happy they are.
“Yes – completely!” John says emphatically. “I mean – we can talk about dependency versus support, but honestly, I don’t care. I don’t care at
Sherlock watches him carefully, still wary. “I understand your concern,” he says, still a bit stiff. He blinks a few times. “Was that… all right, though?”
“What is?” I ask, holding my breath as he runs his nose up the length of my shaft.
Sherlock looks at him for a long moment. “I’ve still never told you all of it, from start to finish. I will. Soon. You have a right to know.”
Sherlock silently nods toward his room. “It’s only ten…” he says, meaning that there’s still time before the room check.
to falsify my own suicide in front of you? And then live on the run for two years? And what would you call standing by and watching you marry someone else, when I – ” Sherlock stops, aghast at his own words.
Sherlock walks them to the door. “Have you got everything you need? I think one of Rosie’s bottles is still in the fridge.”
The pizza they order comes from an Italian restaurant a few blocks away, boasting gourmet toppings and unusual sauces. They choose a fairly tame-seeming one compared to some of the options, pepperoni and sausage with tomato, pesto, and several different cheeses, and it comes on a crust thin enough to practically melt on one’s tongue. They eat with their hands, sitting on the sofa and drinking another bottle of non-alcoholic cider that they picked up at the shops, their legs and elbows touching. Later, Sherlock gets up to dispose of the (empty) box and wash his hands, so John discreetly shuts himself in the loo, washing his own. When he gets back to the sofa, Sherlock takes his hand and pulls him down next to him, their mouths meeting before John’s arse has hit the cushions. They kiss and kiss and it’s phenomenal. John’s dizzy with it, absolutely over the moon that this is working, that Sherlock actually does want him this much, that he’s allowed to have this, do this.
He said that aloud, didn’t he? Yes – he remembers the briefest shadow of something coming over Sherlock’s face at it. And then Sherlock deciding that he’d rather turn away from him for the rest of it, John entering him from behind, unable to see his face.
John is kissing his throat, Sherlock’s head tipped back to allow it. “This okay?” John murmurs against his pulse point.
“Deal,” he says, his own voice coming out lower than usual, and Sherlock takes hold of his face and kisses him breathless all over again.
“True, but dogs are not people.” There, that should about do it. Sherlock sets the lamp on the floor and reaches for the end of the extension cord he set up to test it. Gingerly, half-expecting it to blow up, he plugs it in. No sparks. He switches it on and the lamp lights up.
Margaret shakes her head, smiling. “That is a
It feels good – it feels
John opens his mouth and inhales, unsure as to what to say – he and Sherlock haven’t so much as thought of discussing their cover story. Sherlock beats him to the punch, though.
He’s already turned away before John can respond to this, striding ahead. “Hello?”
Sherlock chances a look at him, but John is looking straight ahead, at Sherlock’s bed. “When you’re ready,” he says, as courteously as possible.
He waits for Sherlock to turn back, blinking wide-eyed up at the ceiling. “Was it the same as before?” he asks.
Enough moody reflection. He takes out his phone, thinks for a second, then texts Sherlock.
He stops, heat suffusing his face, his entire frame rigid with anger. Mycroft has been listening impassively. “You’ve worked yourself into a complete state, brother m – ” he begins, but Sherlock cuts him off.
Ella looks at Sherlock, her eyebrows raised questioningly. He swallows. “I would… prefer to… for John to be the one – inside,” he says, barely audibly.
Sherlock shakes his head. “I wanted to let you choose,” he says.
Instead, they find themselves chatting with the business man who likes espresso, asking for the nearest Starbucks locations, which involves the man pulling up the map on his phone to show Sherlock. John busies himself by gazing around at the other people who just left the talk. His eyes fall on the sallow-faced woman who asked the last question. Pamela something, the one who wonders why gay people are proud of themselves for existing in their perversion, or however she put it. She looks to be in her upper forties or early fifties, with limp, straggling hair that keeps escaping from its tuck behind her ear. Wire-rimmed glasses slide down her nose now and then, and she seems to be on her own. She’s wearing a pink cardigan and brown trousers that weren’t meant for her particular cut of body. John wonders whether he’ll be paired up with her at some singles’ event later this week and devoutly hopes not.
Sherlock smiles for the first time since he got home, and the amount of tenderness in it nearly shatters John’s heart. He crosses the space between them and puts his large, delicate hands on John’s face, cradling it in his long fingers. “Don’t cry,” he says gently. “Everything’s going to be all right now.” He bends slowly and kisses John with every ounce of intention that he’s kept hidden away before this point, communicating it in full, and John is helpless to do anything other than throw himself headlong into it and kiss Sherlock fiercely, his arms coming around Sherlock’s long back. After a bit, Sherlock puts his around John’s shoulders and they stand there in the sitting room and kiss and kiss and kiss, mouths parting, breath and tongues in each other’s mouths, and John still isn’t sure that he’s not going to fall apart completely.
John is left with nothing to do but make good on what he said he’s there to do, so he shaves and brushes his teeth, taking his time but trying not to be too obvious about it. He’s just rinsing off his toothbrush when Sherlock sits up, the water moving noisily. John glances at him through the mirror.
Her honesty takes him by surprise, and John blinks. He nods, and turns his head to face front, where the speaker of the hour is taking her place at the podium. “Good for you,” he says firmly.
With that, they go their separate ways and John feels a bit lighter now, knowing that that’s not a cover he’ll have to carry on anymore. He goes into the dining room and looks around for Sherlock. He spots him across the way, having just come in by one of the other doors, and their eyes meet across the crowd. Sherlock smiles, just a little, and John’s heart squeezes in his chest. He smiles back, then hastily looks away. What he wouldn’t give to ditch on dinner and take Sherlock somewhere really nice, on a proper date. By this point, they’ve eaten dinner together thousands of times, at home at Baker Street and in hundreds of restaurants of every possible budget range. But never like this. John resolves to suggest, the next time they’ve got a moment alone together, that they do actually stick around for a few days longer and have themselves a proper holiday. Go and watch the Pride parade, maybe. Perhaps Sherlock’s newfound determination to champion being who he is and the fact that they’re finally together will lead him to want to do something like that, and since they’ve also saved the parade from being bombed (or so John devoutly hopes), maybe he’ll feel a measure of propriety pride on their part in that, too. And then, John thinks, pulling out a chair at a table he’s chosen entirely at random, they’ll go back to London and he’ll move out of Mary’s flat and back home to Sherlock and Baker Street, Rosie in tow. They’ll make it work. Somehow. Sherlock will go for this, won’t he? John feels sure that he will. There’s still so much to talk about, but –
He looks faintly pleased with my reaction, which causes a low glow to start in the pit of my belly. “Check her throat,” he instructs me. “I think you’ll find what I’m talking about.”
“Ah, but does that mean he leads in everything?” Todd asks him, sounding thoughtful. “I wonder. Besides, John’s got a bit of a swagger of his own, if you look closely. It’s subtler, but that may actually just sway me more toward John.”
This is almost further injury. Sherlock looks at him. “You made captain on your third tour, right?” he asks, a faintly teasing hint to his voice.
Sherlock nods, absorbing this. “You’ve done well,” he tells her. “I’m going to go and let the police know. We’ll take you back to the police station and get you something to eat while you’re waiting for your parents.” He ducks out of the room and goes to speak to Lestrade.
“Right, yeah, but he’s still your brother,” John says. He pauses for a second, not wanting to come off as insecure, but he’s curious. “And – there was no hesitation at all on your part over which of us you would choose?”
Kate bites her lower lip a little, like a character in a third-rate novel. “Look, it’s not my place to say… I don’t know what’s going on between you and John, but… well, I can see this is very important to you. You don’t have to say, but… I get the feeling you might be in love with him. And if that’s part of this, part of why you’re not able to talk to him directly… ” She winces a little. “I’m probably barking up the wrong tree altogether.”
Sherlock looks at John. “I’d like to see her,” he says firmly, with a look that warns John not to protest this, so John keeps his mouth closed.
I get my arms around him and pull him in close, craving that skin-on-skin bond in the aftermath of one of the most powerful orgasms I’ve ever had. Sherlock hugs back, his arms tight around me, and a moment later, I pull his mouth back to mine and kiss him for a long time, our tongues and legs twining around each other’s in tandem. It’s so fucking brilliant, this. I’ve never had anything like this before in my life and God knows I don’t deserve to have it with him, but he’s just that amazing that he still wants me, still wants this from me, after everything that’s happened. I love him so much. I take his face in my hands and kiss him over and over again, letting some of the words slip out over my lips in between, and he absorbs it all and says some of it back and I can’t think of how I even got so damned lucky, because life just got pretty fucking fantastic.
“I hate seeing you like this,” Sherlock says quietly. “Would you just – come here?” He holds out a hand, and John looks at it and sees the hand Sherlock offered him the day he thought he was being sent back here to die. He could have said so much that day – about having saved Mary (and him by extension) from Magnussen, about Mary’s shot, about John’s unconfessed feelings. He could have professed his own and let John wallow in the discomfort of it. But he made a joke instead and let John off the hook yet again. He just keeps extending John new chances, undeserved as they’ll all been. And maybe he was wrong to believe Mycroft that the right choice was to refuse taking yet another one, that it would be better to leave Sherlock behind, hopefully to one day find someone better. Maybe Sherlock doesn’t want someone better. Maybe all he wants is for John to take his hand.
“Perfect,” John says. “All right: let me just change into something warmer and then we can head out into the hills.”
“We didn’t even make it to the bed,” he points out, some time later.
However, the next time she goes over, Mary greets her at the door and tugs her over to the sofa to show her the results of some tests she had. Molly looks at her in surprise. “You should have told me,” she says. “I would have gone with you!”
The room falls into almost complete darkness, the curtains open just a foot or so to let in a bit of the streetlight, which Sherlock always prefers. John looks over, but can’t see him in the dark. “Good night,” he echoes, and it’s the last either of them speaks.
Sherlock blinks and smiles at me, a long, slow, lovely smile. “Same,” he says, and it warms me.
John growled and moaned. He fell upon Sherlock with hunger and lust, finally kissing him. Taking him.
"You want to leave out Father Christmas's favorite cookies so he'll come visit and bring you a present," John reminded him, smiling at his lover. He fetched a plate and laid several cookies out neatly on the dish.
John knows that voice. He grips my gun a bit harder.
John huffed in frustration and called back, "Just give me minute!"
"Okay, let’s move on,” John murmurs.
"How much do you reckon you would wiggle and shake if I fucked you like this?" John asked, his hands wandering down to smooth along Sherlock's flabby sides, cup his chest.
Looking closer it becomes clear these aren’t photographs... they’re paintings. Paintings made entirely out of... Sherlock moves a finger across the sky in the background of the solders image, and his finger comes off purple and blue....entirely out of frosting
John does. He can allow himself just this once. It’s been ages since lunch and he took a good run just last week. He crunches through the mass of bacon, butter, and fried tomato until he reaches Sherlock’s fingers. His eyes are closed as his tongue slowly and carefully seeks out every last bit of butter and bacon grease from Sherlock’s fattened fingers.
Sherlock simply grumbled, turning to face the back of the sofa.
“Sherlock, Sherlock, are you okay?” John wraps hard at the door again. Thank God he’s okay, and hungry? Something… something’s off. He pushes into the door again and this time it lets him in. He stumbles but catches himself, watching in some sort of horrific fascination as Sherlock keeps eating.
Sherlock ate with a hunger matched only by the old gods when they feasted.
John felt all the blood coloring his cheeks rush down to his lower belly instead, filling his cock to hardness.
Sherlock smirked. “Whatever you don’t manage to feed me first.”
“Was it Gavin?”
"Magnificent. Oh fuck, I knew you were special, that you were different, that you were the very epitome of want."
"That makes two of us, posh boy," he growled, then kissed him hard, hungrily, pinning him against the wall with his own huge round middle. He stepped back and tore off his waist coat, his belly spilling forward, the buttons on his undershirt gaping. He toed off his shoes, kicking them across the room, before turning around and marching towards the bed, dropping his trousers as he went. His wide soft arse jiggled and shook, thighs rubbing together richly. He flung off his shirt with ferocity and his belly at last hung free, wobbling and bouncing in the open air. It settled into his lap as he sat back on the bed to tug off his socks.
John was three burgers and four chip baskets down. He sat back with a burp, giving his belly a good pat. God, it was all so good! But so tight!
“JOHN.”
slim stomach pressing into John's lovely pudgy one.
The two, younger officers brought their prizes to the staff, break room, handing them to two others. All four men smiled, brewing up a pot of coffee, they fit bodies on full display under tight, pressed uniforms. They laughed and joked amongst themselves - talking of football and rugby
Then he clears his throat and answers, "I love you too. Now lets get out of here. We need to find you some new trousers I think."
"Sherlock! I hope you're ready to make good on that promise. Oh, you're in a shit ton of trouble, soldier! What you put me through all day," He said, smirking and looking around for him. He frowned and dropped the act, calling for him again. But he wasn't there.
John looked up, his eyes still hooded and his hair a mess.
“Maybe I can teach you some manners,” John continued, his tone crisp and firm and deep. He walked past the dark window of the door Molly was watching through but didn’t see her. He was shirtless, the fluffy jumper discarded to reveal nothing but strong lines of hard muscles under tan skin. Molly felt her mouth go a bit dry. John picked up a box from one of the lab benches. It looked rather like the big box of doughnuts leftover from the break room.
He pushes against the door but it doesn't seem to shift.  He tries pulling. No avail. John taps on the glass.
In a flurry of movement, Sherlock sweeps down the stairs, tails of his coat swooping dramatically behind him, purple shirt clingingly tightly to his bony chest and tight, toned stomach. Thin, stork-like legs arms wrapped in their usual tight, black trousers, long arms swinging dramatically as he announces, "Case, John! Fourty-three year old bachelor found dead in the tub from an apparent drug overdo-"
"Not when I'm interested." Sherlock offered, smiling.
“What are the sexual fetishes of Archibald Icemoon and Yzram Frozentundra?" He asked, trying to focus on the victims of his case instead of the pure pleasure of John's lard flowing over him
“Sherlock, we’ve talked about this,” said Greg, his tone colored with just the right amount of disappointment, “How are you supposed to question friends and family of the deceased?”
"Stuff it you old hag. I didn't hire you for your opinion."
Sherlock hungrily swallowed the doughnut down, the flavor exploding into his brain
"The war is over John, I’m right here. You've got me. I’m safe."
"Jesus!" John mutters, shivering at the thing. Whatever it was. He has a strong urge to just fire a shot so that it stays hidden. He catches Sherlock’s gaze.
“Home.”
"You smell gud, like cookies," he babbled, giggling.
"Oh yes, frightening stuff for a mother to read. Sometimes I'm glad I don't find out about those cases until they're over," said Mrs. Holmes, doling out fried potatoes onto her husband's plate. "Tuck in, boys. You must be starving."
"Oh, Sherlock Holmes, you are a marvel."
"Alright, thanks, lo- that would be nice. Thanks," he said, hurrying up the stairs. He kept his shapewear on, but switched to track shorts and a t-shirt and trainers. Then he went out.
"N-Now without sound," he said, not looking back to either man, simply watching those guts jiggle and shake soundlessly, hearing some breathing in the room go ragged, most likely his own.
." There's a laugh, and someone in the background shouts,
She was just planning what to say to John to excuse her rapid retreat, when she heard a loud bang and clatter followed by a smack and a moan that sounded like- oh crumpets! If Sherlock had gotten hurt in a lab he wasn’t even technically allowed to be in, Molly could very easily loose her job. She shuffled quickly up to the lab door and was about to push her way in when she heard something else that made her stop dead.
John poked his head into the kitchen and his eyes went wide.
"Good to meet you, Sherlock Holmes. Questions? Questions are so..." He sighed, his belly expanding, blowing outwards a bit further, almost perfectly spherical, “... tedious. Get in the way of other things... why not just enjoy... the moment." He was shorter than Sherlock but suddenly his lips were only a whisper from the human's shapely mouth.
He smiles, reaching up and pulling the detective down to his mouth and kisses him hard.
He slid his own hands around to grab at Sherlock's arse. "Bedroom?" he suggested, smirking. "Then I was thinking we ought to go out for a big Sunday brunch at that new place round the corner."
“That’s my good piggy,” Sherlock murmurs, and John can feel him smirking.
" There’s a small huffing of breath and a hard thud, then the sound of a small cry as something holding a tray falls over.
"Gorgeous, yes! Fuck yes! Oooooh Sherlock, Sherlock you prince among men," John groaned, feeding them both, his cock hard and slick with precum between their bloated bellies.
"Fuck off," John mutters, turning away from the wall and looking around the room again. A door, which looks like solid chocolate, catches his eye. He steps towards it and his foot nudges a small box that rattles.
Sherlock swallowed hard, "A-An excellent idea, John! But we need to check for any sort of radiant noise, the windows in both flats' are open, so if anything was dropped, or if the burglar was humming to himself, we need to hear it. Play it again, Lestrade!" he said, shifting his coat over his legs and watching the man before him swell and groan
“I’ve tried to,” Sherlock answers, reemerging from the kitchen with a truly massive cake and setting it down on the coffee table with a grunt amongst the other treats piled high there. He meets John’s gaze and adds, “Captain Watson is just too much of a hog to be taught much of anything. Besides eating of course. And napping…”
John keeps his gaze steady and confident even as his heart pounds. There's another scuttle of bug feet nearby.
"Good day, John?"
"Wait," Sherlock suddenly says.
Both flatmates turn their heads at the same moment and look at each other without a sound. Yesterday evening was rather unpredictable.
"Maybe it's trendy."
“To meet up with Moriarty?
"Hello there," answers John, turning to his friend to give him his cup, with extra sugar and a smile on this lovely morning, and for the first time today, their eyes meet.
"Hi, John," she smiles, passing the back of her hand on her forehead, to remove a curly lock. "What can't you find today?"

The smile of Clara gets stiff, but Harriet doesn't even sketch one ounce of embarrassed grimace. It looks like she doesn't care.

John raises his nose and observes the projectors aiming at the stage, covered by the musicians who are waiting. When he came here months ago, he didn't realise how much the smell of the surrounding wood breathes out a sort of warm and comforting aura where he feels he could take root in any of the beige armchairs. It's because back then, all that John saw was the extremely expensive suits in front of his own completely common person. It's not really the kind of things he notices anymore.
how to obey orders. With tense muscles and a mouth wetter than ever, John rolls up in his tongue both fingers which are coming and going between his lips in a movement that he doesn't have the naivety to believe has any ulterior motives. And when John imagines sticking something else other than Sherlock's index finger against his palate, his heart makes a leap in his already dancing rib cage; but seven years of medicine aren't sufficient to know if this particular beating betrays fear or haste. Then John acts as his most primary desires have taught him: the unknown, he
John hides his mobile in his pocket and curses himself for not being able to hide this easily with his cheeks blushing, before quickening his pace to the stairs of the desired entry. His feet pressing the soft carpet, John goes up and up again before facing a young brunette with an ambiguous shirt on, who checks his e-ticket before pointing out his seat. He slides on the first of the three rows and politely apologises to the people seated who are squirming their legs to give him space - and if even ordinary people are already squeezed in, John can't wait to see how Sherlock can fit in here.
"He is the Second violin."

“Can I check out?”
“You'll understand, John. You want to know who I'm talking to every night? You'll know.”
"I quit," John corrects, throwing to his feet the file from which the paper clip breaks and let's fly away the hundreds of papers that he has filled for weeks.
"Yes, he saw nothing either, if that is your question."
“Unnecessary. Could you pick up my mobile?”
John, you are going to open your eyes and finally realise that by trying to control everything, you are going to end up killing yourself."
He seems to understand the doctor's haste but his movements are reassuring. With his right hand he surrounds John's jaw and makes him get back on his feet. The doctor's legs are killing him, he doesn't have time to spread them before Sherlock is already pressing a hand to the middle of his torso.
helped me so much, once again, and the case!fic gains so much in credibility thanks to her. Lots of love, dear
"I am John Watson and this is the detective Sherlock Holmes," the blond is obliged to specify by pointing at his friend, before starting again. "It won't take long, could we go to your office?"
More hot water on his fair hair covered with some cheap shampoo and John finally turns the creaking faucet off. Cursing the coldness which crawls like a snake on his wet skin, he skips outside the shower of the first floor and wraps himself in the towel he prepared on the edge of the sink. With a hand, he quickly removes the vapor on the small mirror and inspects himself - blurred, of course - before ruffling his hair with the towel. He heard Sherlock coming out of his room approximately ten minutes ago and now, according to the noises he hears at intervals, he can deduce the detective is in the kitchen.
Benjamin smiles and comes to catch the detective's free hand, which he shakes with energy before coming to greet the doctor. John takes him back to the staircase and returns to the lounge, his heart always catching at the vision of this room which must be mentioned in the dictionary under the definition of the word
He goes back to his room while pulling on the sleeves of his jumper.
"Tell me, Sherlock, what was that like to follow an empty lead? I mean, all those people you suspected, when did you realize that something wasn't right? I wonder... In a way, I think you immediately got it and you pretended to believe one of them could have been the murderer, to surprise me. But I also think you might have really believed it and that... that would be dramatical, Sherlock. Do you agree? You know, Sherrer wasn't supposed to turn his head. He was supposed to be hit on his forehead, on the left. As my man was sitting right behind you, you would have been suspected, just a tiny-mini-bit, just enough to see you defend yourself to the police and justice. That was my plan."
“Yeah, sure.” He grabs it all, leans in, inspires to give himself some guts, and writes.
"I told you we would see each other again, Sherlock," and there's something in his gaze close to a real emotion that makes him look human, for a split second and it's enough to make John feel sick.
"Yes, I'm here willingly," he says ironically, looking above him at the neon lights covered with dust.
That lasts one minute or maybe ten. It's useless to know exactly the number of seconds which are passing by, anyway. John feels good. Worse, John feels brave. He waits while Sherlock tidies up his instrument in his case silently before asking him, in a very quiet voice:
. And to see it every day and to face it, it's not something that he can do. Because John Watson's worst enemy is on John Watson's body.
"No."
Benjamin swallows a big breath of air and puts his right hand on his mother's forearm, who gets up automatically. She jumps when she notices his horribly white face, murmurs to him

"Yes, something like that. And what are people going to say? 'Sherlock Holmes and John Watson together', that's absurd."
In front of him, Sherlock seems to check John is okay from the tip of his eyelashes, before he lets go of his arm. Sherlock walks toward Moriarty who's leaning on the guardrail, looking at London. The sky is dressing itself with black coming from the East and on the buildings are reflecting the last sunbeams. It looks like the towers are in flames. It must pleases Moriarty.
If you can make a man hard by speaking like this, tell me so I can sign you to Britain's got talent. -J
The doctor approaches with his eyebrows furrowed and discovers piled videotaped representing the back-scene of the Royal Hall festival sitting in the center of the living-room. Seven small silhouettes cut from cardboard are put there, on which are glued the photos of the witness's faces. The doctor catches Anna Sanchez's copy when Sherlock explains:
Why are you alone at home a Saturday night? Where are your wife and daughter? -SH
"The appendicitis," comments Sherlock, the hand a few centimeters away from the scar on the right side of the doctor, now that he dared to get up.
08:36 PM
"Harry," sighs John, pouring the water out of the jug into a small plastic cup which his sister catches, not without a grimace because of the pain.
"In which position was he before you touched him?" asks the detective, facing the man whose stammering incoherent words before collapsing on one of the chairs.
"Wouldn't you rather want us to buy you sudokus?"
The fact that Baker Street's first floor needs to be tidied up, that's a sine qua non constant that no reasonable human being would come to question. But the fact that what needs to be cleaned are wineglasses and empty snacks wrapping, that's rarer.
"I will say nothing more."
"It is extremely naïve of you, but I will take a look at it."
"No ring. Spinster," starts John, fixing on the hand of their target who is dancing in some oriental gestures.
"Don't speak to me like that, I am your boss, Watson."
"I've already told everything to the police."
"That would be a very good id..."
That was weird, John. -SH
"I believe you have the proof that Benjamin couldn't be the one who brought out a weapon."
"It's a bit vulgar, but essentially, yes."
"If I go through your bedroom, I think I'll find a few."
. It's in the shivers traveling the naked body, in the muffled groans, in the way the fingers are hanging on the detective's hips. John Watson
10:47 PM
Clara said that he thinks being weak is shameful. There's no proof more concrete, more red and swollen than his scar, to prove that John Watson had real moments of weakness in his life. The trembling knees when the most beautiful girl in school kisses you, that doesn't count. When the heart beats so widly that it seems to want to go back up into the throat, to tear away from the veins, to take support on the molars and to appear far from this sweaty body - all this because you have no strength to press the trigger and it's the enemy's bullet that implants in your body, there is no stronger moment of weakness than that.
. But how many times should he repeat this?
’s hand.
"And the two hearts here, what is that supposed to mean?" asks John, putting his forefinger on two read hearts on the left side of the paper.
Sherlock very ironically smiles one second more before relaxing his face muscles. On the bench where he's seated, he crosses his legs and puts his elbows on the table before catching one of the two beers John brought back and inspecting it meticulously:
"Do you mind if I get that?"
"Well, here is our quite small, and strangely walking suspect," he comments in a powerful voice, quoting the words used by Craig Jennings in the parking lot.
"You help me out to lay the table?" he asks without even looking at John.
Sherlock doesn't even turn around, he just disappears between the dancers in a morbid silence where all the unsaid things and the questions between them seem to be so heavy that it's John's respiration, short and oppressive, which suffers the consequences.
"Who says he has never tried?" smiles Sherlock, and this time the doctor can only do the same.
"Couldn't you take a day off?"
John half-opens his lips, but his Adam's apple seems to mistake itself for beef because it's so big that it stops any attempt to reply. Not medically possible but bothersome all the same.
I can hear (or 'read') everything, trust me. -J
who is an amazing beta and a wonderful human being.
John grins, frowning. It's good, even half-dead his silent
Sherlock raises his eyes to John and in his dark pupils is roared a booming
The doctor doesn't even have the time to let the hair on his arm ruffle when the forensic team, accompanied by Sherlock, come to meet them. The brunet is still wearing his coat even though it's not cold and John pertinently knows he's keeping it to differentiate himself from the rest of the inspectors around him. The ex-soldier doesn't really know why this coat has a space so big, but when Sherlock puts it on, the mouths go silent and the eyes open wide. It's like a super hero costume and even if the detective has nothing to do with Batman, at least they share the sense of the dramatization and they both provoke snobby fear. It's both completely ridiculous and totally effective.
“I know it's hard...”
"Which is a good thing."
. For the love of God, Sherlock, who could raise a man like that?"
"Doris Cox now: Doris is a real mystery. And say that the newspapers make serial killers appear as human beings difficult to understand, in comparison to fifty-year-old women, they are easy as pie," Sherlock pursues without noticing that he interrupted John, one more time. "I've followed her for several weeks and searched her home because I didn't understand her need to overprotect her son, Benjamin."
A man no one sees. Nice and maybe a bit transparent. A man they didn't even investigate before they were done with the seven innocents. A man who turned his head to look at himself and who broke, by this simple gesture, all the power and the stageplay of a murderer.
"Perfect, John, good boy. Open your mouth, wider, do that for me."
Sherlock looks terribly young, his eyes are opened wide, the skin of an infernal paleness. His lips are half-opened, wild; the man with the ceaseless retort has nothing to say anymore.
“Hi, I'm John Watson, this is my friend Sherlock Holmes and we're coming for...” “Oh, yes, of course, they told me you were coming,” answers the man seated behind the desk.
instead of
"John!" Sherlock eventually barks, "Your fly is opened."
"Yes, precisely," specifies John, arriving in his turn in the living-room, drying his hands with a cloth which he then puts on the back of his seat.
"Sherlock," he calls up, coming back to the living-room to show the object he's holding in his right hand. "How many times do I have to tell you not to put your riding-crop on the table where I eat breakfast?"
"Why?" John smiles to hide any other terrifying emotion growing in his belly.
"No, Sherlock, I wasn't trying to have your sympathy, I just wanted to tell you so, that's all."
"Wednesday evening, Giuseppe Denosa leads the London orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall. They'll be playing Bruch and Liszt's
"I shouldn't say anything, then?"
"Doctor Watson, I am glad to see that you could find some time to meet with me."
to do with all of this murder thing," smiles Sheri awkwardly, obviously trying to calm the ambient tension.
"Go get them."
"A damned courageous one to put up with Sherlock's bullshit, that's for sure. In any case, don't be embarrassed with Elisa or me. We'll just keep to ourselves that Sherlock told you everything and it'll go well. And if you ever feel like you were a bad boy who needs a spanking one day, you know where I live."
"I understood, you know..." John confesses with a husky voice.
With an annoyed gesture, he pushes away the papers to make space on the coffee table of the small waiting room of the hospital's 7th floor and sighs heavily. There are C-08 forms everywhere, enough
01:18 AM
Moriarty rolls his eyes and lets his head falls backward, apparently offended someone dared to say something stupid in front of him. He flaps his tongue against his palate two or three times but it's so annoying the sound is stuck in John's eardrums. He sighs, almost disgusted and nonchalantly shakes his hand above his shoulder.
11:13 AM
09:06 AM
No, intuition doesn't exist. It’s a lazy way the brain uses to form an idea without understanding it's founding its thoughts on a accumulation of knowledge and olfactory, auditory, visual, tactile or thermic stimuli.  -SH
The word cracks in the air like thunder and John knows he must go back inside to protect himself before being messily hit. But he explores the hurricane by his gaze for a few more seconds without getting to express all those things he knows a friend should be able to say. But he just can't do it. He turns around, puts his seatbelt back on and says with a neutral voice:
"It's a b-bit offending," sighs Benjamin.
"Not yet. It's already hard enough to make her take paracetamol... She says medications are poison."
"Yes. Yes I understand," answers John, nodding.
11:13 AM
"It looks like you want to interrogate me, sat like that," the ex-soldier laughs pointlessly.
"High heels. She came here in a cab: rich."
"Sherlock..."
10:20 PM
of his phone brings him back to the so-calm order of his doctor life. He turns off his screen before his next patient comes in the room. Gastroenteritis.
They then find a plastic pocket in which are pictures of the musician: some taken during a show, some taken in this same flat during what seems to be a birthday or Christmas. On the photographs, Sherrer clashes due to his impeccable suits and his grey hair so delicately brushed, while the rest of the guests and his flatmates seems more comfortable in their jeans and sneakers. John smiles, noticing that the age difference is blatant in these pictures while he had never thought of it before. At 37 years old, Sherrer would have been able to be married, to also have a child on the way, why not, but the life in London is so out of sync that it's with flatmates who were ten years younger that he spent his last years. And that would not be sad if John isn't realising at this instant that he was the same age as Philipp. He doesn't blink and slides the last photograph back into the yellow plastic pocket.
The repetitive tone that burns his eardrum is clear: big brother hung up. The noise behind him is clear: Sherlock just closed the door. He pulls out his shoes in the darkness, slightly hesitates, and John stops his torture.
Because everyone forgot that Sherrer existed.
“Can we talk about it later?”
. The doctor has never been gifted for foreign tongue, but this one, he's starting to really like it.
, one of the most known suicides of the theatre. And this costume of Hamlet, the most iconic tragic character: even in his roles Sherrer was morbid."
"Some people find pleasure in loss of control, domination or pain, sometimes. Of course, it's frowned upon by society, hence, the members of these kinds of relationships are extremely discreet. So sometimes, a polo-neck is enough."
"I can go make us some tea if you want," Sherlock proposes with a smooth voice, sliding his hand on the doctor's skin.
“Yes.” Sherlock sits down, too, opening his laptop. “Why Jeremy, do you suppose?” he asks.
I can’t even laugh so much as just stare up at him in frank wonder. “Me what?” I ask, my arms still wrapped around him.
John seems to be having difficulty breathing. “Do you – do you mean that – the way it sounds?” he asks, the words coming out jerkily and awkward. “I mean – I don’t mean to be dense, but – just – ”
“All of you, Sherlock,” John breathes into his neck. “Every inch of you. You’re incredibly attractive, you know. I always thought so. You could have been a model for a Rodin sculpture.”
“No problem at all,” Paul says. He steps closer. “And if things continue to be tense between you and Doctor Watson… I’m always around if you need someone to talk to.”
Scott recites it obediently and John puts it into his phone, then texts the contact info to Sherlock as Sherlock knew he would. “Okay,” Scott says uncertainly. “Does that mean you think Jeremy
Marjorie nods. “Yeah, this is a second time round for both of us, and neither of us really liked our first wedding, so we thought we’d have a look at the options out there.”
, Sherlock. Not for as long as I live.”
Sherlock nods, turning the words over in his head and attempting to digest them. “All right,” he says. “Then once you’ve narrowed it down some more, just… keep me posted.”
“I know,” Sherlock says into his hair. “But understanding doesn’t make it any easier.”
John glances at them. So far only Kimberly, Aliyah, Marjorie, and Jim have arrived, but they’re all busy chatting with each other. He hesitates. “Er…” He’s not sure what to say.
Sherlock eases John down into it, then straightens up. “I’ll just put the kettle on, get the paracetamol, then run down and get the bags.”
. Mary had hated that shirt, but Rosie nonetheless got enough wear out of it for there to be a small orange stain (probably strained peaches) on the upper left side. Ridiculous choice of colour for an infant, but Sherlock had been privately tickled by the text and it hadn’t come in any other colour but white, so he bought it anyway.
Even in the moment, he can recognise it as the signal of him having actually relaxed and recharged during his long sleep, and it feels good. As fantastic as last night was, it’s nice to get to do this without the edges of shock, exhaustion, and even his relief at having found Sherlock and fixed things between them in the background. Now they can do this without him having to work at shutting the rest of it out. The night’s sleep has given it some distance. Now he’s distracted by Sherlock twisting around, reaching for something behind him. “What are you doing?” he asks.
Sherlock swallows, then swallows again. “I don’t – want to be traumatised,” he says, with evident difficulty. “I just want to be – normal.
Margaret looks confused. “But why?” she repeats. “Why put him through that without telling him?”
“Don’t ‘Harriet’ me,” Harry says, scowling at her. “Answer the question, Sherlock!”
“No more recriminations.” Sherlock is adamant, though he undoes some of his own firmness by running his fingers through John’s hair.
“What?” Sherlock frowns. “That’s ridiculous. You’re the best person I’ve ever known.”
“What was so creepy about it, apart from the obvious?” John asks, a bit dryly.
“Jesus,” John groans, once they’re gone. “This is ridiculous!” He lifts his face, which is red possibly both from having been lying face down as well as from embarrassment.
Sherlock makes a sound that could be taken as either affirmation or negation. “I realise that the rest of this is evidently not equal in worth to my vaunted virginity, as it seems to be the only offering of myself which you would consider adequate, or perhaps it simply fails to balance the depth of my failings with regard to you sufficiently to matter, but – ”
Vee sets out the silver, which Des has just finished polishing. “How much longer do you think they’ll be?” she asks Mycroft, who is typing something on his phone.
“How’s Rosie?” Sherlock wants to know.
Sherlock nods again, his lips slightly parted as though he’s thinking of saying something about this, qualifying it somehow, but whatever it is, he doesn’t say it. “Yes,” he says instead. “It was good. And he seemed to like my – erm, my – what I did. To him, I mean. It was very much the way you showed me. At the same time. I preferred it that way – I was less self-conscious.”
“Here,” he says, nodding toward one of the information tables.
It’s about damned time, he thinks.
“Yesterday.” Sarah’s voice is very small.
Sherlock stifles a smile that attempts to escape. “No, you did,” he says. “I’m just… checking.”
John gives a dry laugh. “Aren’t we a fucked up pair,” he says, to no one in particular.
, he’d said, meaning Mycroft, not the man they were allegedly discussing. Mycroft had grown defensive.
“Oh, God, are you – ahhhh!” John’s words cut off as Sherlock’s tongue presses into his crease him without preamble or warning, to Sherlock’s satisfaction.
and Molly bites her lip and grins, glancing around to make sure no one saw it, but the lab is still empty. There are the cadavers in their drawers downstairs in the morgue, but they hardly count as company. She texts back
“Please, Mr Holmes, you’ve got to help me!” Horace says, suddenly looking anguished. “It’s got to be you!”
“He drove me,” Sherlock says. “He’s rented a car. He sent his security people home for the night and said he would drive me. The restaurant has a cloak room, though, and when I told him there weren’t any cameras in it – there was one over the entrance, but not inside – he kissed me in there. It’s actually sort of fun, avoiding the cameras. You and I are particularly adept at it, but he’s also pretty good at keeping himself from being spotted.”
“Soon,” Sherlock says. “About now.” He’s the one to close the distance again, his mouth on John’s before John can move to do so, but John recovers and begins to lip at Sherlock’s mouth, and this time there’s no nanosecond of adjustment on Sherlock’s part – he’s right there, in sync with him.
The restaurant he finds is delicious, reminiscent of Angelo’s. He orders gnocchi in pesto cream with roasted chicken and I have tagliatelle in rosé sauce with prawns, and both dishes are fantastic. He orders half a bottle of the house white with it, and it feels like a feast. We talk about the case and he explains, linking the thumbprint to the thief’s jealousy and resentment, and the undercurrent of boasting/wanting to get caught. It’s a familiar enough theme by now and it all makes sense. Under the table, his shoe is touching mine. The server comes by and asks hopefully about dessert. We decline and Sherlock asks for the bill.
Sherlock cuts his gaze to Lestrade. “Who would rob a house between nine and ten in the morning, even in Knightsbridge?” he asks, a bit pointedly.
He understands completely; he always used to wake up from his PTSD nightmares in tears, too. Sherlock’s witnessed it more than once, which John always hated – he hated anyone seeing him like that. He doesn’t want Sherlock to feel even worse, being seen this way, but having seen John that way so many times will help, hopefully. “Let me get you some water,” John says, which is what Sherlock always used to do. He doesn’t wait for a response, going into the loo to run the cold tap, wanting to give Sherlock a slice of space to collect himself, but not wanting to go too far, either. As he knows so well himself, just having that time to remember where he is, that he isn’t wherever the nightmare took place, to let the nightmare fade and start feeling less real, less present, is so important. He pours a glass of water and goes back into the bedroom, perching carefully on the edge of the bed.
Sherlock closes the door behind him with haste, his fingers shaking in both anticipation and probably far too much adrenaline. It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters but this: John is finally all in. Triumph is also trying to establish a foothold, but until it’s happened, caution still has a role to play here. They’re inside now, dragging each other up the stairs by whatever piece of clothing or the body part in it that either of them can grasp, stopping on the landing for several breathless, long seconds of frantic, hungry kissing, then John makes a sound that propels them both up the last few steps, pushing into the flat.
As he’s tuning Betty out, John lets his gaze drift around the dining room, careful to avoid looking at Sherlock. His eyes happen to fall on Pamela Blake, who is sitting by herself at a table where four other people (couples, possibly? John wonders) and eating a bowl of cornflakes with a glass of milk. John has always loathed cold cereal. Of course someone like Pamela would choose cornflakes when there’s an entire buffet of hot breakfast foods and other better things to eat available. He excuses himself from Betty and Keith’s joint monologue and goes to get himself some more bacon and to have a better look at Pamela from here. Sherlock is almost certainly right if he thinks that Joe Biggs is their suspect, but John can’t help but feel that Pamela’s thinly-veiled wrath has some merit, too. He didn’t notice Joe at the lecture at all, but Sherlock showed him a photo… he takes a long look around the dining hall as casually as he can manage, then spots Joe two tables over from Pamela. He’s sitting entirely alone, drinking coffee and eating a plate of sausages – nothing but sausages – and doing what appears to be a sudoku puzzle. He doesn’t look particularly friendly and John isn’t surprised to see that no one else has joined him. So, what then? Has he got the makings of a bomb stowed under his bed upstairs or something? John studies him covertly for as long as he can manage before getting back to his own table.
“He… touched me. My face and chest, and he kissed my neck,” Sherlock says, speaking quickly and sounding miserably uncomfortable saying it out loud. “And that was – it went on for a little while and I was trying to – do the same sort of things in return, but – ”
“I know,” Sherlock says, his eyes still closed. “I love you.”
John lets go after a moment to find Sherlock’s cock again and finds it flat-up against his body, leaking profusely and fit to burst. He rubs
John could have objected to this, but instead, he’d said, “I suppose I could sell the flat. That would give me something. Only it’s not even in my name. I don’t own it.”
Hi! Sorry it's been so long since my last update but here's chapter 16 - tadah! Many, many thanks for the last kudos and subscribers (is that really a word?) and if you want to leave a comment after your reading, you'll make me the happiest girl in the neighbourhood
"You've never heard about Sherlock Holmes?" John cannot refrain from asking with a small chuckle always totally bewildered to meet people like him.
“You were found in a Wembley wasteland, so I’ve been told. What were you doing there?”
," spits Sherlock without considering John's proposal. "We were able to establish that Sherrer was following Denosa, thus neither Sanchez nor Steele were able to be the shooters. Of course, I suspected Craig Jennings at first. I couldn't believe a man that dull could exist without faking it a bit, but it turns out that this man is truly and profoundly stupid - he even began a hunger strike to try to get back custody of his son. Benjamin Cox was also in my sight, but seeing his reaction when I pointed John's weapon at him, it is obvious that he would have never had the notch to kill a man in cold blood. And then, there was only one shot, perfectly targeted, the killer is a professional. John thinks it is Angie Walsh. She is young, but her family is used to the venery. Angie Walsh, thus, is used to handling firearms since she was a child - but I'm missing the mobile."
"Gregory, wait. You can... well, Elisa can come too, you know."
“Go. You have other things to do…”
“Thank you.”
He moves back from the wall as if he has just been burned and finally realises that he's the author of the noise. It's simply his beating heart.
into it. It's also what Sherlock is teaching him, to see in spite of the darkness, to vibrate in spite of the coolness of his sad bloody life. It's been that, since the beginning, since these messages:
That has the effect of a slap to John, who sits down again immediately. Against his feet bangs the horn which he catches more by reflex than by real desire, before putting it on his knees. He watches his own reflection in the copper of the instrument, and seeing himself gives him the concrete proof that it's to him that Sherlock spoke. And even if the words were very clear and were pointing to the musicians, John can only feel in his flesh the echo of this sentence in their own life, on his own control, the one that he gave to Sherlock. The one that he
"Oh, I especially know Sherlock," answers the DI, very serious.
“Yeah. I’ll give you a lift to Baker Street.”
"Yes this is why I told you, that has
like this. You're incapable of letting someone else have control."
"Because you are ready."
“Everything is alright, Mrs. Hudson.”
" the DI bawls.
The window closes automatically and the car starts to roll in the light traffic during the middle of day. The skirt of the new Anthea is so short that John's eyes lay on the unveiled skin one second too long. When he crosses the offending (and offended) look of the young woman, he quickly turns his face to look through the window.
, launches for the eighth time the animation and decides to change his wallpaper. He passes from the black and white landscape to the zoom of a green frog. Which is not particularly interesting.
"Even though..."
"We asked for the names at the reception desk sir, we should have them in under 48 hours. And sir, the spectators who stayed are waiting outside to be interrogated, sir."
"Sh-Sherlock," John sighs, raising his head by reflex when he feels the hand of his flatmate settling on his cock.
Sherlock turns his head and plunges his piercing gaze on his friend's. Evoking the past time of detox always dives John into an opportune silence. Sherlock knows it, that's why he said it. He focuses on the road again and from the corner of his eye he sees the doctor's nimble fingers moving over his phone. No matter what Lestrade thinks, everything
The doctor opens his lips, ready to answer, but nothing comes out of it and he frowns when Sherlock resumes:
06:18 PM
“Sherlock? John? Is everything alright?”
They're on a swaying metallic construction and John finally understands what is in renovation at the observatory: the dome balcony. The footbridge they're walking on has small holes on it, through which he sees the yellow and purple flowers below and the invisible hand which is holding him by the stomach pulls even harder. He jumps in surprise when he feels fingers (real ones this time) closing around his forearm. It's Sherlock and he stares at his smile and gaze.
His voice breaks and his mouth clasps shut. John looks at his face, ribbed by blood and ignored tears. And suddenly the memory of Sherlock's voice in the other bedroom and in the park resonates.
08:23 PM
I'm some-cool-name on Tumblr :)
“Sherlock made me swear I’d bring you back as fast as possible. The hospital isn’t secure enough, which means you’ll get a nurse to care for you at Baker Street.  Aren’t you a lucky chap?”
"What are you playing at, Sherlock ?" he exhales in a husky breath.
Their bodies are shivering still since they nearly hit the car -and the truck- but it's the first time the detective's damn mouth is finally closed. They stop on a motorway rest area, complete with picnic tables and never-emptied outside bins, but John barely notices them, he's already out of the car. He turns around and forces the opening of Sherlock's car door. He’s still sitting, his gaze looking at his feet like a guilty kid.
The door of the office opens suddenly and Sherlock walks out of it, cheekbones red and his gaze wilder than an animal's. He gives no gesture to John but the blond-haired man is already on his heels anyway. He turns around just in time to see Lestrade, in the same physical state as his flatmate, tidying up some files furiously. He waits until they are out of Scotland Yard to ask Sherlock:
"To discover new things," he answers as if out of breath, his hands imprisoning his face, which is white as sheet.
“So?”
John jumps with surprise, moves back awkwardly and stands up quickly on his feet. With his shoulder resting against the open doorway is Sherlock, arms crossed against his torso. He has found his bottle of champagne, after all.
"Stop thinking about him."
It shines and sparkles, it's invading the lounge of the ground floor with red, green, and gold, and it makes Mrs. Hudson smile like the child she was a long time ago. Baker Street is dressed for Christmas with the garlands which smell stuffy because they haven't brought them out for a year, and with the balls they put on the small Christmas tree near the fireplace. It smells like curry, even if it's not very traditional, because in a magazine for mature women there was a new turkey recipe which intrigued Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock and Lestrade are fed up with her chestnut turkey, though they have never told her, but she sees how the oldest one forces himself to eat it and how the youngest hides his leftovers in his pockets before throwing them in the neighbor's trash can so she can't see it.
08:21 PM
John closes his eyes just for a second. And faints right away.
John's eyes raise to the sky.
. John had already seen Mycroft being the origin of this expression, but how he feels pitiful for being the reason right now.
"Coffee?"
"Pictures of Sherrer disguised on the occasion of theatrical shows? Inevitable."
“And what?” John whispers, breaking up his syllables as if he was biting air.
That makes John choke in outraged laughter, and the fact that his flatmate doesn't even deign to look at him any more isn't helping. That makes him lose his mind, he who wants to roar since he left the clinic (which he retained in a very impressive way in the Tube), and now he doesn't see why he should hold back anymore.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow, not really impressed by his friend's repartee, and lets him clink their drinks together - which has probably a great meaning for the doctor but which leaves impassible the detective - before they both bring their glasses to their lips.
put your riding crop on the table where I eat, it's disgusting! You hit dead people with it!" he yells pointing at the crop, lying like a simple harmless feather in the middle of cups and scones brought by Mrs. Hudson.
. Oh, John," sighs Sherlock with a groan.
The detective sergeant makes a sign to tell him to follow her and guides him to interrogation room number 2. She says Lestrade is behind the two-way mirror before letting him in.
"Sherlock!" he exclaims, jumping in his chair, his hand already in his pocket to take out his telephone, which he turns back on immediately.
Sherlock, for Heaven's sake, what's the point in knowing all that?" John moans, pushing away the letter and seeing his flatmate's mouth devouring his left nipple, which is only making him harder.
Sherlock has a frank smile (because it's obvious that he, too, laughs at the doctor's clumsiness) but he says nothing and straights up a bit more on his knees. He raises his face at the same time as his hand which, this time, is approaching what changed everything in John Watson's life.
"He was... He was an excellent musician. His horn, h-he..." stammers the youngest, breath obviously short under the pressure imposed by the detective.
"And because I
"My name's Sherlock."
"Of course, John."
"Ah, no, no problem at all. It's hot in here, don't you think?"
John's eyes open wide again and after the peak of tension, he explodes in laughter, leaning against the wall nearby.
"Maybe," echoes the youngest, jumping on the most grilled one that he savors without waiting.
It's absurd, really, that Sherlock uses this word and John doesn't even know if he speaks about the way he lets go, or about him, or about something else. They're looking at each other without daring to blink (because everything comes back to their damned pride, as always), but John knows that he will not hold any longer, not like that, not while his flatmate moans and while his own stomach becomes ardent.
"Bill Hendrik?" calls Sherlock after glancing at the notebook shown by Lestrade.
Five minutes is enough for them to reach number 4 Dean Bradley Street; the building which they enter is of neo-classic inspiration, nevertheless, completely recent. Leaned on the reception desk, John lets Sherlock present them to a young woman in a blue dress who tells them to follow her. She doesn't seem more surprised than that to see them and doesn't even bring out the traditional phony excuse of, "Mister Jennings is not available at the moment, may I take a message?" Maybe her boss expressly told her that she could bring him every person relative to the investigation, but the fact remains that this proof of accessibility shows the doctor that the lawyer is nicer than John thought.
"Clara," interrupts John with a disarmed voice.
Merry Christmas. -J
"I... called Molly concerning that budgerigar theft - it was the gardener as I told you. I finished my experiment on the head I put in the fridge and you'll be glad to know I threw it away as you asked me to do. I changed the battery in the remote control so you don't have to complain every time you get up to change the channel directly on the television. And I might have used the jumper your sister offered you, as a mop, when the experiment I did on the head went...
Anyway, he doesn't have to think for very long because a black sedan with tinted windows stops in front of him. The back left window opens and John leans forward to discover an Asian woman with hair cut so short that she seems bald, her eyes painted with a deep black, which he could see better if they weren't fixed on the phone between her hands.
. You don't have to take care of everything, you know. Let me handle certain things for you, all right?"
"Really, John? Oh what a wonderful thing you are, letting me come in your mouth..."
"Your jumpers are in my bedroom's cupboard."
"Good," answers John, nodding unconsciously, before coming back to himself thanks to his friend's hand, which leans against his shoulder.
“I wanted to see the trout.”
"You came in my room?" John asks Benjamin, his eyes wide open of surprise.
Lestrade opens but immediately goes out of his office to greet the newcomer. He explains, lowering his voice:
“Is it any interesting?” asks John, vaguely stretching to crack his back.
"How did you meet him?"
"According to the angle of incidence of the bullet, neither Sanchez nor Steele would have been able to hit Sherrer's skull, because he had his head turned up."
success. No one cares to go hear Philip Sherrer plays, when Denosa conducts. Everybody always look at the maestro. Even you, Sherlock.”
The magnificent
"Yes, about ten minutes ago. Holmes told me to tell you that he's questioning Angie and that you have to take care of Sheri."
," Sherlock spits, as if both notions were totally antithetic, and Doris gives an outraged laugh.
But no Viola Reichenbachiana. John can close his eyes.
"Sherlock, what are you doing?"
Bottom line: you have no idea. -J
John agrees. He knows that he doesn't have to answer this time so he keeps his face lowered. Sherlock's still looking at him. He
"For me to touch you. I understand."
I don't understand what he’s doing at the ministry. -J
"John," Sherlock mutters, tightening his hand around the badly shaved chin. This time, it's because of the grey look that the doctor confesses the number he wanted to keep silent for as long as possible.
You've got really no one? No one interests you, no one that "stimulates" you, as you say? -J
"Always," Moriarty answers, pride stretching the muscles of his face already sick in the first place. "Is it hurting him?" he suddenly wonders, looking at John's immobilized arm and shoulder.
John straightens up, pulls a face when he feels his back cracking, and catches his tank top off the ground to wipe on his stomach to clean himself briefly.
Hello! First of all, thank you so much everyone for your lovely comments. The fact that you took time to read my first chapter and to post a review really proves that you are the best! Enjoy your reading on chapter two :)
Molly starts to ask precise questions to which John didn’t have time to think about so he makes up a story that seems credible and tries by any way possible to not think about the taste of dirt which invaded his mouth when he felt in the wasteland. Mrs. Hudson comes out in her turn with bakeries she did. They all talk about her cooking now and if it reassures John the first minutes, it soon tire him. He lets them talk and sits on his chair, absolutely washed-up, but incapable of closing his eyes now that they’re staring at the leather armchair in front of him.
"Her ex?" asks Lestrade, carrying the plates which he puts on the still bare table. "They are getting back together?"
Noon. Well, that hadn’t happened in a long time. No need to ask John; he’s ready to jump in the Auxhall Fiesta in a sec. Sherlock nods to make him enter his bedroom and leaves him there while he's getting dressed in the bathroom. To leave this well-proportioned bathtub is heartbreaking. So that's what mothers feel when they abandon their child.
She swallows and nods. She has a light in her eyes that makes John shiver. She's thinking about the body spread in his own blood and even the consultant detective's assistant can guess it. It's by reflex that he lowers his voice and slows down his flow of words.
For all those who don't review, please, consider to do it, especially if the author tells you she/he loves/needs it. Even a simple "thank you" at the end of your reading can brighten an author's life. I'm not the first author who stops to publish because of the lack of feedback and as much as I LOVE fanfictions and the idea of sharing writings about my favorite shows, I have no energy, and worst, desire, left to publish.
"Why?"
"Of course
John is breathless. He closes his eyes, shakes his head, his jaw can't move anymore. It's his subconscious which is protecting him and refuses that he says out loud words too painful to be confessed.
He locks the doctor's hips with his thighs and pulls the dark blanket around their bodies. In between his long musician's fingers he catches some of the blond hairs to help John to quit looking at their hips pressed close together.
