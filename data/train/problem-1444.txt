I composed it for you.”
“Move!”  Sherlock orders, and John does, picks a rhythm that has Sherlock squirming, and thrusting, and begging in no time, and Sherlock forces himself to focus, to look down at John and take in everything, the way his eyes look bright, and focussed, and wholly free of care, the way the slump in his shoulders has straightened, the strength in his grip, on Sherlock’s hip.  He glances up and catches Sherlock looking, and grins.
“Yeah.
If the sea swallows he and John alive, who would notice?
I’ve never posted a video before, and I have no idea how to edit one, so I guess that this might turn out a right mess.
John smells strongly of rubbing alcohol and antiseptic from work.
Mum wasn’t really affectionate that way.
John answers.
Quiet.  Finally.
“Do you want to be?”
Sherlock starts to shrug out of his coat and jacket as the trail ascends a small hill, and John smiles at the line of sweat soaking through the fine, white, silk-cotton blend of his shirt.
A small, exasperated “I know!” echoes back down the hall, and John smiles and shakes his head.
But the way he’s looking at Sherlock is…
Loved it.
“I was raised Catholic,” John brandishes the toothless claim like a weapon.
He’s not mentioned it to Ella because—well, it’s just not the sort of thing she needs to know.
Sherlock had been correct about everything that mattered.
“True.”
“You want to share a lasagna?”
“Do I at least get wedding night sex?”
And John wants to touch him, he thinks.
Spring in January.
“Yes, I think we have it handled, Mrs. Holmes.”
“Come by the office, Sherlock.
She sets it down again.
You’re hot.
“John…”
‘Night.”
He moans, and watches Sherlock’s hips arch up off the bed.
He turns and stares down at John’s scowl, at his head of still sleep-mussed hair, at the way the t-shirt he’s wearing stretches across his chest, revealing nipples peaked from the cold.
Sherlock murmurs, pitching his voice low, all the way down to that octave that seems to always register in John’s body like a throbbing pulse.
God, I—I need—I need…”
He winks.
Let me say this.
“So it seems.”
John huffs out a laugh.
He feels a little giddy, ridiculously giddy for a man of his age.
He’s exhausted.
John grins.
“Most likely the truth, Boss.”
John sets his tea down, walks over, and slides onto Sherlock’s lap, leaning back to press a line of kisses along his jaw.
John waits.  Sherlock says nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  No words, and the absolute worst time for this to happen.
A wrinkle forms between his brows, and Sherlock reaches down to smooth it away with his finger.
I’d not anticipated being so responsive.”
That would be my advice.”
Breathe until your head stops spinning.”
“Sherlock?”
If it’s crossed some sort of line then forget the whole thing.
Across from him, John sets his plate down and gets to his feet.  “I’ll just…”  He jerks his chin in the direction of the loo, and Sherlock nods his head in acknowledgement.
The man props his umbrella up against his chair, and leans forward, elbows on the table, fingers steepled in front of his mouth, and John almost laughs at the familiar gesture.
I just—I want you to know that you can trust me.
“Shut him up, Roz.”
John rolls his eyes, but comes, sits, dips a biscuit in the tea, sloshes a little over the side of his mug onto the table when he finally takes a sip, hands unsteady, head clouded.
I-N-V-A-L-U-A-B-L-E
“You’re fit enough.
His thumb trembles, and he scrolls down to the last text he’d sent Wiggins, opens it and then squeezes his eyes shut, and tosses the phone onto his bed with a sigh.
Now that Donna is dead I imagine you will find him dead as well.”
“Still hands,” he admonishes.
Sherlock just rolls his eyes.
It’s Sherlock who tilts his chin, and presses them together properly, just hovers there, between awake and asleep, holding his breath, full, dry lips pressed to John’s wet, thin ones.
he finally admits.
His face is flaming.
“Slowly, in and out.
John laughs.  “Sorry about the sentimental display.  What would you say to dinner at Angelo’s in a couple of hours?  Too much?”
“Yes, I do.”
They’re for you.
Touch which John allowed.
John sighs and lays down on the floor, stares up at the shadows the flames in the bedroom hearth cast on the ceiling.
“I love you.”
There is an edge to Sherlock’s voice now, and it surprises John.
“A yes or no is sufficient.”
That’s familiar territory, but the rest…
“Check your phone.”
It’s empty.”
I keep telling you, I’m fine.”
Fine.
John does.
Alien birthing pod this time?”
He wants her out of their hair almost as much as Sherlock does, and Sherlock thinks there is no way he could possibly love John more.
He has invitations to a hunting weekend at his lodge outside of Edinburgh.
John leans against the door jamb.
It’s more for affect than anything else.
Right, well then, I’d be plenty grateful, but there’s no rush and no pressure.
John shrugs.
There is only one of those things he has any control over.
Better.”
Lestrade shows up Thursday with a case.
“Lucky thing them turning this parlour into a bedroom.
Of you go and get it then.
God, yeah,” he breathes without thinking, and then Sherlock’s mouth is crashing back against his, and John is straining against the hold Sherlock has on his wrists, and the weight he has on his thighs, and he burns.
Sherlock’s voice says.
John smiles, and then opens his eyes and lolls his head to the side.
“Yes.”
Sherlock hears the front door slam, hears Mrs. Hudson’s small exclamation of surprise from the foyer, and then suddenly he is on his feet, down the stairs and out the front door before he even realises how he got there.
He’s actually grateful he indulged earlier, it means his body isn’t so quick to respond, no matter how stimulating the fodder.
“I can’t deal with that, and all of this.”
“I’m okay.
Well, to him it may be something considered unforgivable.
Concussion too, and some flash burns on the back of your neck.
“Lemon grass and vetiver, or sandalwood and vanilla?”
Ella looks at John, scribbles something on her notepad, and returns her gaze to Sherlock.
We probably shouldn’t even be going.”
“That’s good, John.”
It’s barely a whisper.
Sherlock opens his eyes, looks down at the top of John’s head, waits for him to glance up and catch his eye.
The well-dressed man who had, until now, been hovering silently by the window, turns and speaks.
“He told you things.”
“Come here, and bring your book.
“Yes, I know.”
You know about my profession, and you clearly already know that I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet.
He wonders if she’ll be characteristically angry with him when he finally reappears.
He settles.
“Sorry.
Sherlock’s mouth has parted, and he is leaning in despite his earlier resolve to not be touched.
John’s eyes snap up to his, and Sherlock holds them, like he used to in the old days, the look that could make John drop everything and do anything, go anywhere.
Won’t start the hour until you get out.”
John reaches under the covers, and takes his hand.
I just feel like.”
He takes a screenshot and sends it to Sherlock.
John smiles at him when he finally looks up from his plate.
Have been feeling a bit better, been out a bit more.
“Oh, Christ.”
Sherlock’s stomach knots.
“And that’s not your fault, okay.”
I think it went well for a first time.”
Something else.”
I—I’m sorry.”
He sucks on John’s neck.
You work as a team.
_______________________________________
“Thought we were meant to be looking for Jack.”
He feels less warm.
But don’t worry.
John reaches down and runs a hand through Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock lets his eyes fall shut.
“Was a bit worried I’d got the time wrong, or thought maybe you’d changed your mind.”
He sets it down on the table beside his chair with a metallic clank.
You’re home.
Sherlock only nods, and then settles the full weight of his body atop John’s with a sigh.
“Come, let’s help your father.”
He hesitates.
“What are you doing here?”
“I imagine these things take time.
Okay, we are definitely watching this.
He seems to catch himself, or perhaps he is just taken aback by the vehemence of Sherlock’s reply.
And John doesn’t obey him this time, not exactly, but it’s alright, because his hips stay still, while his hands slide down Sherlock’s thighs, and back up again, slow, soothing strokes, and it helps, helps Sherlock relax enough to take John more easily.  He knows John must feel it, the moment his body lets go.
John realises.
He reaches out and lays a hand lightly on John’s thigh, for the briefest of moments, and then lets go again.
But then I saw you.
“John, please.”
He thinks Sherlock is still sleeping.
And so they do go back, and wonder of wonders they do find their cabbie, still stuck in traffic.
“Take your clothes off,” he says when his eyes finally come back to rest on Sherlock.
The man asks, clearly quite done himself.
Imagine you’ll get more use from it than she will.”
Sounds mad, but I just wanted to do something he had no say in, wanted to take something back somehow.
John chokes out a whimper.
I browsed other ASMR videos.
Okay.”
“Leave it.”
It was a stupid idea!
“Yup.
“Where?”
“Guess so.”
“So—some of this has been—frustration?”
“Listen, whatever it is, I—I won’t get angry.
John’s eyes snap open, and Sherlock’s brow knits.
John sits and stares at the floor.
“Listen, I won’t charge you for the full session.”
And valued.
“Yeah?
“Is that the sort of thing we’re up to now?”
Sherlock braces himself.
“Now I think about it, I’m rather glad they don’t want to keep you.”
“Nothing.”
“Yes.”
There is his father smiling softly, still somewhat befuddled that it’s a man Sherlock is finally marrying, but never one to begrudge his child happiness, he is glad, all the same.
“Yeah.
To get out while the getting is good, to avoid tying himself down to a Watson, because no good can come of it, and he’s always going to be broken, and he’s always going to be a mess, and he’s always going to let him down.
He’s covered in gooseflesh, head-to-toe, and his nipples are tight and peaked.
Sherlock takes the plate from the tea table and starts to eat the fried eggs, and toast John’s miraculously procured.
“Was proud of you tonight, too, you know.”
I was purposefully difficult.
Okay.”
John jerks his chin in the direction of Sherlock’s plate.
Sherlock breathes into his hair.
Sherlock nods.
John winks.
“You gonna tell me what’s going on?”
“Bit of an anxious bloke.”
“Okay.
Don’t do that.”
“Sherlock, I don’t want to feel like an experiment.”
“Didn’t get an invite to the party on the weekend, but she’s still my niece.
I’ve heard back from the airline and hotel.
“John,” Ella tries carefully.
Well, um, she said she could probably come round to take a look at it next week, see about getting it listed asap.
He shakes his head, and sets the tray down on the floor beside the bed before sitting down on the edge of the mattress, and carding his fingers through Sherlock’s curls, fisting them, giving the gentlest of tugs.
There’s an issue with my hearing.
John’s cheeks somehow manage to grow redder.
“You don’t know, because I never told you, but I worked for my brother for several years in my early twenties.
“Over here!
And I tell you what, that same person was, and is, the most human human being I have ever known.
“Just hold on, now.”
“Yes.
There is a small wrinkle forming between his brows.
But Sherlock continues to hold his gaze, as he chases his pleasure to it’s zenith, and John can feel the moment when he starts to topple over the edge, the way his balls draw up, and his body coils tight, and his eyes grow wide and then squeeze shut even as his mouth drops open.
Fantastic.
Sherlock’s head snaps to the side of its own volition at the words.
John takes a few long deep breaths, and then drops his hand.
“What else?”
The mist clears.
“That’s enough.”
Sherlock swallows, and then suddenly lunges for the car door, nearly hitting the car beside them as he spills out and vomits all over the carpark floor.
bad, and Rosie is sound asleep by the time they pull up in front of the flat.
She asks some minutes later, popping her thumb out.
“Yes.”
Little cafe.
In that case, Heidegger’s death was probably unplanned collateral damage, making whoever is really behind Arthur’s disappearance, now an accessory to murder, as well as abduction.
“It’s time for your antibiotics.
Deep, serious, all business.
This results in even more huffing and slamming, but Sherlock simply focuses his attention on the book in his lap.
What more is there to discuss?”
Sherlock just shrugs but his face is slowly turning scarlet.
It’s ludicrous.
“Yes, well, we can’t all be budding apologists.
It’s not like I have a lot on at the moment, and I’d be more than happy to help out."
“When will we conduct the first session?”
I thought that was what we were, but if it’s not, then…”
John stirs a little a that, makes a small sound like a whimper at the back of his throat, and Sherlock tightens his hold around his waist on instinct until John settles again.
“Mmm…”
They said suicide, but…”
She’s bruised about the face, her eyes red-rimmed.
“Sorry, must have missed that between you turning up unannounced, telling me my bum leg is all in my head, and labelling me a whore.”
Sherlock’s eyes look suspiciously red-rimmed.  John smiles.  “I love you, you know.”
John is radiant, beautiful.
You stop.
“You tell me.”
Her brows knit as she looks from him, down to Rosie, and back again.
And isn’t that appropriate, Sherlock thinks, because John has worshipped him since the moment they met, until he had mistreated him so many times he’d lost the faith, and Sherlock has never believed in a God, in anything higher than himself, not even as a boy, but he has believed in John Watson from the very first moment he laid eyes on him, believed in him, protected him, tried to ease his way even if he so often got it all so terribly wrong.
“We’ll need to go see Holdernesse in an hour or so, and then I thought that we might head home.
Doesn’t feel like talking about it at all.
I did want it.
“Oh yeah, well you would, wouldn’t you.”
“Jesus.”
It feels awkward to say, but it feels like something that needs to be said, none-the-less.
“Maybe stop trying.
And the sound just makes John fall in love all the more.
Don’t think I didn’t notice.
You were on that fence, and when I knocked you over…”
“You know what I allow you to know.
John lets go, one last surge of wet heat in Sherlock’s mouth, and then he goes limp beneath him.
I left her, and then she couldn’t…”
Sherlock is just as broken, and he’s hardly the one to try and stitch anyone back together.
“So, when I—when I ran over to you, that was really you lying there?”
“Mm, yeah.
He reels back a little, jaw twitching and eyes filling.
The rules.
But don’t get me Pad Thai.
He attempts to sober.
He clears all the books from the shelf and stares at the now familiar cypher, takes a few photos, and then carefully re-shelves the books in the same order as before.
You know I’m here with you because I want to be, because I just like being with you?”
Maybe Sherlock’s right, maybe there is something about the place that sets him right.
“You’re hardly the blushing bride.
We don’t have that kind of food in, and I’ve not even thought…”
He opens his mouth and breathes John’s breath, and when John's forehead presses against his, when his nose brushes against his, it isn’t a surprise.
“And scoot over.”
“Yeah, but I didn’t expect…”
“Yeah?”
He doesn’t know if Sherlock’s mum is right, and he has no talent by the ridiculous standards his family no doubt adhere’s to, all he knows is that it is possibly the most beautiful thing he has ever heard, and there is something so achingly moving in the fact that Sherlock is gifting it to him—him,
He just walks back to the flat.
Sherlock only stumbles once on his way up the stairs.
They had been tracking the threads of Moriarty’s criminal web for years, without knowing who was at it’s centre.
A week ago he would have at least gone through the motions of pretending he needed or wanted to go back, but tonight he hasn’t.
It’s totally unexpected, and Sherlock lets out a sound that would be embarrassing if not for the fact that his whole body has just lit up like a tree at Christmas and his brain gone totally offline.
“Long enough that I think you’re well caught up.
Right.
It’s a lie.
Finally…
Did you think he’d be able to let that slide?
John looses the third button down and licks his lips.
“It was wanted.
“Papa, this book?!”
Sherlock makes a small sound at the back of throat, brings his bound hands down from over his head, like he wants to touch his cock, and then seems to catch himself and puts them back.
Sherlock nods.
“Under the covers, come on.”
“Won’t slow you down.  Promise.”
Sherlock briefly considers shutting the conversation down, but he wants to know, he wants to hear John say it.
He whispers, because there is something about the atmosphere between them that seems to warrant it.
“So you’ve said, but you need to sleep.”
John wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist, and relishes in the enveloping warmth of his body.
Oh, don’t mind her.
But you have to promise me that I’ll get to make love to you sometime tomorrow.”
They pick up their pace due to the cold, and the warmth 221b’s foyer is welcome respite after the biting wind down Baker Street.
“Mm, I’ll remind you, you said that.”
“Wash that knife before you use it.
Jesus, I thought you were lying dead in a ditch somewhere.
“You want the Chinese chicken in the paper box for supper?”
“Finish the tea, then bed.”
“Maybe.”
Must have forgot that was today.”
Remove your trousers, if you will, and then lay down, make yourself comfortable.
John reaches out and meshes their fingers together.
It’s barely a whisper.
Please.”
John takes a sip of coffee and runs a hand through his hair before replying.
John huffs out a small laugh.
Do you know why?”
“Just tell me.”
He sits down across from him at the desk, takes one bite of his food, and frowns.
It’s raining again by the time he gets back to his flat, and he curses the bloody weather, and just wants to get back upstairs, and, and—fuck.
God!”
“Yeah well—next time carry your own fucking bag!”
This is Sherlock giving him space and time to settle.
“So you think he just ran away?”
“No you don’t.”
John has a fierce need and desire to protect, but on some level he resents having to.
A man who can’t be bought, who won’t agree to be his spy and puppet.
John’s head snaps up.  “About me?”
“Oh thank god.”
Quite.”
John gives him a shrug and a crooked smile.
John nods, but Sherlock is looking at him like he might get up out of bed, slip into his clothes, slip out of the room, and do something stupid like give John space.
It is a Saturday.
It’s supposed to get up in the mid twenties this afternoon, and here you are plodding around the back country in a full suit and wool coat.”
“Imagine, Sherlock.
He nods.
So, you two are here to what?
Fantastic.”
He’s got a bluetooth in his ear, and he’s got his instructions.
Sherlock’s fingers stir at the base of John’s spine.
“Get the lube.”
Sherlock takes it and grins.
“Yes, I rather overestimated my appetite.
Moriarty mimics the old Jimmy Saville show in a sing-song voice, and then sobers.
If you didn’t want…”
He knows it, he’s learned to embrace it, and yet here is John Watson, a near stranger, and he seemingly wants this, wants Sherlock’s closeness, the warmth of his body, the strength of his embrace.
“Am I a suspect, then?”
But if he wakes to find Sherlock gone he will know something happened.
“I’d rather not have the first time we do this it be because you want to prove something.
The pushchair does come in handy, as Rosie starts off strong, skipping and practically running to Regent’s Park, but has all but worn herself out by the time they finish standing in line, and get through the front gates.
John cracks an eye open.
“Thank you.”
“I’m not.”
Tell me how to make this right.”
He’s bungled the whole thing.
“Yeah.
You said, ‘married to my work’!”
John smiles, and then presses his forehead to the centre of Sherlock’s chest before huffing softly and looking up again.
“We’ll discuss it in the morning, Son.
The bath.
The rims of Sherlock’s eyes fill, and glisten.
John chuckles.
John sits up a little, leans over, and kisses the other side of his neck, presses a kiss to his chin, reaches up, cards his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and pulls his head down until their lips meet.
There’s required transition when you get back.
John’s hand moves, pulls again, and Sherlock is coming with a shout, and explosion of sensation so powerful he can feel his muscles tense, tears squeeze from the corners of his eyes, can hear himself making sounds that should be embarrassing, but which seem to be spurring John on to previously unforeseen heights of arousal.
Yeah, well, it was appreciated.
“But it’s cold, and mine’s threadbare and itchy.
“Sometimes, when we used to live together, I would hear you.”
Things will probably go back to the way they were now, and that’s alright, he supposes.
John shrugs.
John chuckles.
“Why did you want to die?”
You can spend more time with me and Rosie.
Sherlock presses his nose into John’s hair, breathes deep, and John reaches back and gives his hip a squeeze.
John doesn’t know why he says it.
“But…?”
“How’d I get so lucky, hm?”
And when the Moriarty situation presented itself, I knew by the time we got to the pool, I knew that I was marching swiftly toward a fate that could not be avoided.
His forehead presses against John’s, their noses brush, and John’s heart races in his chest.
“Thank you.”
John scowls.
“Come here,” he says, almost too late, as there’s nowhere for Sherlock to come to.
“Indeed.
“If it’s what she wants, I—I guess let her.
Felt that way a lot.
“Nothing’s going on.
From somewhere in the flats above he can hear the muffled strains of violin music floating down.
When you’re sober.”
“What?
“I met someone.”
“Ooo.
John chuckles, low and warm.
He holds his breath, and then lets it out in a long, loud sigh of contentment, when John folds his fully clothed body against his.
“It’s different!!”
But what…?”
“It has been six weeks, and I have promised to endeavour to be more careful in the future.
He’s barely repressing a smile.
This is Sherlock luxuriating in it, in John, and he just keeps on…
John can be so many things—fierce and tender, wild and contained, nurturing and violent.
“What do you mean?”
Sherlock kisses him, and John’s finger slides from his arse, his whole body losing all coordination as Sherlock teases his prostate.
John actually manages to eat his full half of the lasagna, as well as a salad, bread, most of the antipasto, and two glasses of wine.
The thing grins through the mask of Sherlock’s features.
Forgive me.
Are you…?”
Sherlock kisses him, chaste but with conviction, and feels the tension drain from John’s body.
He turns and looks back down at Sherlock.
Sherlock sits back, peels back John’s pants and looks at him spent, and vulnerable, at the mess he’s made.
He sees the words strike, sink in.
“Right.
Sherlock sits down, reaches out.
“So, you mean it?”
Condom sooner rather than later, then, just to be safe.
“Why is my brother here?”
“‘Cause I couldn’t not be here.”
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock pouts.
It’s not completely true, I don’t think.”
“When you’ve finished eating, I want you to get up, go take a shower, and then get undressed, get into bed, and wait for me.”
“Did you?
generous.”
“We can slow down.
So how’s she supposed to explain that to her friends, her teachers?”
He takes his phone over to his desk and sets it up behind his laptop, as usual.
Maybe then.”
And John laughs, and pulls him closer, kissing the top of his head with a huff.
Sherlock swirls his tongue and then sucks him into his mouth.
John’s voice strings out into a gasp as Sherlock moans around him.
“No.”
Kate.
He pushes his face mere inches from Sherlock’s.
Christ, you have no idea how much I did, but, it’s harder when you…”
But Sherlock has no words.
Sherlock sighs and rolls his eyes again, making absolutely sure that Lestrade knows just how incredibly boring he’s being.
Sherlock pushes past her and dashes out onto the street, stops at the kerb, glancing this way and that.
“Not anymore, but—I think maybe I did that night.”
John had years enough of his own ptsd-induced nightmares to know what not to do.
“I wad the labender thig.”
Don’t say sorry.
John hisses.
James Sholto looks down at him with sea glass eyes.
Kind of feel it in my body, like it gets into my cells somehow.”
Someone is nattering away about a lost Vermeer painting being found, and John’s attention drifts to the shelves behind the counter.
Sherlock sighs heavily, stretches out and pops out of the bed, stark naked, to go to the loo and get it himself.
“So, you want to what?
He presses his hand against the wall by the door, listens to the distant, muffled sound of boys changing classes, and wonders if time and memory can haunt a place, can be absorbed into the very physical fabric of the place somehow, all the emotional energy of over a hundred boys, times nearly 100 years…
“Oh don’t look at me like that.
John’s head drops.
He was ex-military, working a government contract of some kind in aeronautics.
He goes over to his bed and gets his pillow, brings it back over and sets it on his desk.
Something softens in Sherlock’s eyes.
“Excellent observation, John.
Perhaps it will still send anxiety coursing through his veins, or perhaps it won’t.
Lovely.
“Of course.
Not faulting you.
I love you, too.
John finally grows weary of the pointless chase, and slides off the ice to untie his skates.
I’ll bring you a surprise.”
Sherlock huffs and pouts some more.
Sherlock gives his wrist a gentle squeeze.
“Oh.”
Perhaps the killer carried the dispersal unit with them, whatever it was?
“It scared me because of what it made me feel.
He rakes his fingers through it and leans against the back of the futon.
“Soft and snug.”
Why his heart is racing, and the corners of his eyes pricking, and his body swaying, almost imperceptibly into Sherlock’s orbit, closer, and closer until he can feel the heat of him, the living, breathing reality of him, and he feels something inside him break.
Sherlock is honest.
Sherlock nods, and swallows dryly.
“Don’t.”
“Yes.”
He’s living it true.
You wanted to tell me about going to see Sergeant Donovan at the Met today?
It had very much been Mary’s space, and John had let it be.
Sherlock nods, because it’s all he can manage, but he can tell by the way John’s brows are knit together that he isn’t buying it.
“Not at all.”
“Can you look at me?”  John still sounds angry, he realises.  He hates it, tries hard to school his tone for what he wants to say next.  “Just—look at me, okay.”
John pushes down the panic he can feel blooming in his chest, a deep-seated, feral thing, born of childhood warnings from his nanna, and stories of exorcisms from the local priest who had been a bit of a nut, and had been shipped off to the northern most tip of the Hebrides by the time John was in second form.
“I thought perhaps you preferred to rest, or to be left alone.”
I’ve called him already.”
“Listen, I’m not leaving here without him, so you either get out, or you’re stuck with me.”
“Not good?”
“You have to believe me, if I’d had any idea all the cards were about to come tumbling down, I never would have—I would have kept my distance from you, I wouldn’t have dragged you into my life, into all this.”
I’ll be back.”
Even now the flat is filled with Rosie’s things, and Sherlock’s things, but beyond a single mug in the cupboard, and a paperback novel on the table by the hearth, there isn’t a single thing of John’s here.
“John, all through the Victorian era public baths were very popular in Europe, and co-bathing in the nude was hardly considered…”
And it’s not just the heat, John thinks.
The house does turn out to be a waste of time, the crime scene having already been thoroughly investigated, and the police having destroyed anything useful. The local constabulary also proves most unreceptive to help from ‘
At the sound of Sherlock’s moan, John’s body relaxes, takes his finger in.
I’m sorry, I just—you mean the world to me, this means the world to me, and I don’t want you to think that I’m just using you for…”
He sees the words sink in, sees John’s eyes grow wet, before flitting away.
Sherlock huffs out a laugh, that almost sounds wet.
She leaves, and they’re alone.
I did.
He jerks his chin in acknowledgement, and then turns away.
“Not sure I should have even come today, actually.
Sherlock gets to his feet.
“You’re really good with her.
“Can I get you anything?”
He wants this.
“Come to bed.”
It doesn’t take long with that voice in his ear, the phantom sensation of Sherlock’s hands on his body, each whisper of fingers over paper echos against his skin, each susurrus of fleece like fingers ghosting through his hair.
“I’m not sure they would have been much different.
“God, Sherlock.”
This is Leona St…”
But it’s best to avoid lasting damage, don’t you think?”
it’s starting to get unsettling, and he hopes to heaven that he hasn’t inadvertently brought William Edwards home with him.
I’m sorry, Sherlock, but I can’t guarantee his safety.”
He stirs a little, to let John know he is awake, and John sniffs, and grows quiet, but doesn’t pull away.  His shoulders still shake.
It might ruin everything they’ve so carefully reconstructed in the last year.
Was pleased to hear from you.
I—I don’t know how to talk, to do relationships.
“Mmm?”
A dispersant of some sort.
John switches the video to full screen, and watches, rapt, as those hands start to stroke the pillow softly.
It’s all there for anyone to read.
When I was in Afghanistan, sure you’d do anything to protect your men.
But wha…”
Right.
John fails at biting back a grin.
He slides his lips down over John’s jaw, down his neck, back behind his ear, and John can feel him grin any time John’s cock gives a throb or twitch of interest.
He likes spark.
“Christ these are good.
“Mm-hm.”
He’s all the way out to the kerb when he realises that he’s not paid the cheque.
“Are you okay?”
“Look at me.”
It’s becoming harder and harder to do, the longer things drag on.
“Ashamed.”
“And so you should know by now.”
Something like a hunger that John knows Sherlock can’t possibly feel.
“What is it?”
He’s practically vibrating with irritation, and Sherlock wants to—to—to stop, and swoop down, and kiss him—quite thoroughly.
He stares down at his lap, and carves a groove into the desktop with his fingernail.
John shakes his head with an exasperated smile.
“Sherlock wait.
“But, you don’t!”
Both videos are long, and thank god for that.
“Better late than never.”
Safe enough to trust, and thus let go.”
Proud to be your partner.
It’s not so easily ignored now.
“John…”
John’s hand stills.
“Unavoidable.”
“Yeah, you should.”
“Didn’t even hear him crying,” Clive adds.
Sherlock sees the words hit John with almost physical force.
“What do you see?”
Sherlock chuckles.
Sherlock sighs.
The words, predictably won’t come.
Rubs the fabric of Sherlock’s jumper (
“A feeling?”
He reaches down, brushes a single curl from Sherlock’s forehead with one finger, and then pulls away again, just as quickly.
His shampoo, his toothpaste, the cheap soap he always insists on buying from boots even though it dries out his skin; clean but just a little stale, wholly human.
“Not good?”
Looks relieved.
Christ, if you don’t let me say this now, I’m not ever going to say it.”
“Donovan.
Sherlock is grinning.
She is a challenge, yes, but she’s a joy.”
Were you good for Aunt Harry.”
“Last night, it just seemed like maybe—talking got difficult for you after awhile.”
“His tie has flowers.”
He sounds a horny little devil and hates himself a bit.
He jumps and stares down at the paper envelope, before craning his head around to look up at Sherlock in question.
“Most of the time.
“Imagine you did a good job.”
“Shh…”
Sherlock sighs.
What use would she have with a quaint little cottage in the country.”
“I would like.”
In another time and place she might be the sort of woman he’d date, he thinks, but not here.
“I solved it.”
“Wherever did you get that idea?”
That he’d wanted me to come with him, and I said ‘no’, and I should have known, but I didn’t see, and I—I loved him, and it killed him.
Sherlock briefly wonders what his blood would look like against John’s skin, under his nails.
His hand is a blur against his cock.
The way I see it is, if we have any purpose at all, it’s not some grand thing.
“You have me.”
John clamps his mouth shut, the minute the words are out.
They’re Papa’s books.”
Where would be better?”
Maybe we could let it again in the summer.
“Okay.”
I did.
“I do, you know.
“Yes.”
“You going to be okay if it turns me on?”
“Kind of lonely out here.
John huffs out a laugh.
“Patience, okay.
to leave,”
John is sweating, his body sticky in some places and slick in others.
“I know that’s more difficult for you, but you need it.”
Work has been monotonous lately.
In the end Leona Sterndale does nothing more interesting than walking to Mrs. Roundhay’s residence, pacing outside it for some time, and then finally returning to another cottage a short way down the lane from the Tregennises’ house.
“Good.
“Rude.”
He weaves toward the kerb, a little, and Sherlock’s grip around his waist tightens with a chuckle.
“I’d move back in with you.”
His breath smells mildly of Sherlock’s arse, which should be off putting, but oddly, is anything but.
His Grace is very traditional.
“You fell out of bed.
“Indeed, but perhaps when the sun comes up.”
He hadn’t come the night before, and now it seems his body is twice as eager.
John swallows and licks his lips, his eyes dragging the length of Sherlock’s body, as much of it as he can see anyway.
He needs to say something.
And it’s partly the wine, partly that, but it’s mostly something else, everything else.
His cheeks flare as he lifts a hand to pinch at his nipples and snakes the other around from beneath him to give his cock a couple of long pulls.
And then Sherlock blinks in surprise as John’s face flushes scarlet.
John remains mute, and when Sherlock looks up at him, his face is blank and his eyes distant.
But still—John is dying.
Sherlock palms him, sudden, unexpected.
“Sherlock Holmes does not
There have been times when I’ve found myself quite—overwhelmed with how much I want you.”
“What?
“But, I wanted it.”
Don’t do well with surprises, I guess.”
Sherlock must hear something in his tone, because his mouth forms a small, sheepish O.
“I am not!”
A still, heavy, white blank of a space, and Sherlock is peripherally aware of John’s mouth moving against his, slow, hypnotic presses, and pulls, the brief sensation of John’s tongue teasing along the seam of his mouth, not pressing, just ghosting there, sending Sherlock deeper, and deeper.
A dark, raw reminder of everything that lies between them.
“You.”
“I’m going to turn on the lamp, alright.”
Y-O-U
“Sorry.”
James was the rock upon wish our marriage was repeatedly dashed.
That’s probably going to seem slightly clinical and weird at first, but over time it becomes habit, and you won’t notice it so much.
“Yeah, soon.
John drops his other hand into his curls, and fists them lightly.
The glide of it, the wet, tight heat.”
John stares, holds his gaze until it hurts, but Sherlock doesn’t look away.  Finally John swallows dryly, and jerks his chin once. “Then I’m glad you didn’t find out until later, because—meeting you has been the best thing to ever happen to me.  And yeah, I wish this didn’t happen, but, well, these things have a way of happening to me. My lot in life, I guess. I’ll heal. I’ll move on from it, and you—you’ll still be here.  I hope?”
“I suppose you’re going to want to
He gives it a squeeze, and Sherlock tilts his head down and buries his nose in John’s hair.
“Mmm…
He just wants to be in the moment, because he’s just had the best sex of his life, with the one person, he suddenly realises, he loves more than he’s ever loved anyone.
“You know, you just sit there all day.
John sighs and stares down into his mug.
I had everything laying out, and I hadn’t been expecting company.
He swings his legs over the side of the bed, and stares down at his pants and t-shirt.
Sherlock clarifies.
“Don’t you dare say a thing about money.”
almost be a whisper.
He’s had a decent number of partners, he knows what it’s like to be looked at through a cloud of lust, but this is different.
“Right.
“Mine or yours?”
He looks well sated rather than nauseous when he’s done, and Sherlock is glad to see it.
“Stop it!”
So, for the sake of brevity…
The water.
John insists on stopping for lunch at the Kirkham Priory ruins.
“He’s wearing pink.”
“You want me to know you love me.
Sherlock freezes, seemingly remembering himself.
“You’ve had a series of these ‘suicides’ around the city the last few months.
He’s restless, itching for something, anything to happen.
Stop!”
“And you think that I’m not?”
The man had scribbled notes and left again.
Go ahead.”
“I’ve no doubt.”
“Jesus…
You have to believe me.
“I didn’t come last night, John.
“It doesn’t have to be.”
Appears there’s people just as mad as you ‘round here.”
“It’s so good meet you.”
Sherlock stares some more.
“What?”
“Yeah, well, you still haven’t told me what it is we’re doing.”
“Good.
“Why?”
“She’s afraid of something, and not just her husband, I think.”
Right.
“You two’ve met?”
“I’m an idiot.”
Oh, you like them then, do you?
“Come here.”
Sherlock is different.
“You’re sure?”
The world goes still.
John lets out a small sound, somewhere between a sob and a giggle, and Sherlock pulls him tighter.
And then he wouldn’t let me out of it.”
Sherlock regrets his lack of readiness, his panic, then.
You’re everything to me.”
John shakes his head to clear it.
Sherlock shakes his head.
Sherlock feels all the oxygen go out of his lungs.
“Sorry.”
John hardly gets a chance to look, but he can still feel his cheeks flaming.
They’re together.
To share breath, to let your tongue slip between the seam of their lips, to enter them—that is something altogether different.
“Okay.
“And you believe that has to do with your father?”
“What?
The fire Sherlock is stoking in John’s veins doesn’t take long to reach its peak.
He’s hardly anything to look at, and Sherlock
“Maybe.
There are paintbrushes inside, a scrap book of pressed flowers, and on the last page of that, a newspaper clipping of an obituary.
If that was too…”
John sighs and rolls his eyes.
He’s going to scare Sherlock away.
You want to take this in there?
You deserve to know it was a choice, not a mistake, not a regret, not a last resort, and that night, if we’d…
“Really?”
“Soon.
But this isn’t.
It lights him up.
“I’m happy to be with you.
He smiles into John’s hair.
Best left unsaid, definitely.
In truth, Sherlock is not fond of taking Rosie to the park.
So quiet he almost misses it.
Sherlock winks down at him, and John feels his cheeks pink with more than the cold.
It was the start of everything new, and mad, and wonderful in John’s life.
“Go lock the doors to the stairs, and then come here.”
“What I have to give.”
He nods.
The functions are fairly limited on his phone, but it will at least allow him to edit out bits where he comes off as a right prat.
He’d had a playful girlfriend in med school, and he never quite knew how to respond to her either.
John is relieved beyond measure, when they leave the country roads behind for the brightly lit motorway on the outskirts of London, and more relieved still when they finally get into the city proper, to familiar streets, and finally park the car in the car park a street over from
“I’m sure.
John sounds as weary as he looks.
He’s never felt like this: desperate, wild, willing to do or give anything if only he will touch again—there again.
John grabs a spoon and a set of chopsticks, and curls some rice noodles around them.
Sherlock thinks about it.
Desperately trying to win back some sense of purpose, when he’s simply a waste of space, now, and he knows it.
I just…
Yeah.
He smoothes a hand over Sherlock’s hair, and feels warm all over, feels a heavy, contented sort of peace settle into his bones, as Sherlock’s eyes slide shut.
Sherlock nods.
“We should try to sleep again.”
“That you refusing?
John’s eyes snap up.
“Suit yourself.”
There were a few years afterwards where I thought it was the worst day, but still—still, deep down I knew that I was better for having known you than not.
Sherlock regrets the words the minute they’re out of his mouth.
What’s this made out of?”
“I did.”
“Mmm, if I couldn’t be an era defining genius like my brother, she hoped I would be a prodigy and go into the arts like her mother.
Blessed relief for their mothers, he thinks.
An oil diffuser, auto-shutoff feature when the water level gets too low.
“That’s what I’m here for, remember?”
It’s deep, and warm, the sort of voice that seems to envelop you like a blanket, make your blood sing and drain all the anxiety from your veins with a single syllable.
“I thought you would ask if you wanted to meet.”
“I just wanted to say some things that I…
I—I would be grateful if you would come.”
“Good.
Outside the wind is howling.
John takes a deep breath.
Late 19th century, wasn’t it?”
“Well then, I would think that you would be clever enough to see the value of love over ‘in love’ whatever that means.
alright?”
“It was a good idea, this.
I see.
“This going to become a regular thing, you borrowing my things.”
“That things don’t—
His intention had been to impress John with his
The big, lumbering, wall of a man is dressed in a grease-smeared pair of dungarees, their state likely due to the motorcycles he appears to be working on in the shop behind him.
“You’re too drunk for that.”
That didn’t end well for him.”
He sees the moment John understands.
He’s just poured, and added milk to John’s when John appears back in the kitchen empty-handed.
Things seem to go more smoothly after that, because John and a completely clothed Rosie are back downstairs and eating breakfast by the time Sherlock gets out of the shower.
No John.
“Oi, no need for that.”
“Umm, their place, I guess.
“God knows why, but to you I do.”
And it—it surprised me, I guess.
What…?”
It’s cluttered, and warm, almost eccentric.
“Mmm?”
Sherlock nods, and draws closer, lets John tangle their limbs, pull him close, run his palms over the muscles of Sherlock’s shoulders and back, down over the rise of his arse.
This was a good idea.
Would never know there had been snow and ice a few days ago.
He spits out the word like a pejorative.
John balls up his fist, and stares back down at the chipped and ageing floor.  He chews at the inside of his cheek.  It’s a perfect opportunity.  Probably not now or never, but he’s getting awful, bloody tired of now or later.  “Happy Anniversary.”
“My marriage.
“Do you want me to bring you up some nibbles?”
He sets their bags down at the entrance to the lounge.
But auditory-tactile.”
“Did we make it?”
“You’ve just surprised him.”
“He knows I come to therapy.
“Take my car.”
“There you go.
“Right.
He slides a hand down his thigh, back up again, dips down, and John spreads his legs for him, lets his fingers find their way between the damp heat of his thighs, behind his balls, and when he strokes a finger, gentle yet firm against the muscles of his perineum, John lets out a sound like he’s been punched, startled by the pleasure of it.
For maybe the first fucking time in his life—safe.
A little louder this time, and that seems to do it.
“You won’t hurt him, and you can’t hurt me without hurting him, so here we are…
John looks relieved.
You going to explain?”
It started on our honeymoon, and just…”
The lack of success John experienced with his cuddle business seems to make more sense the longer Sherlock knows him.
“Hayes.
he picks up his tea cup, stares into it, and then sets it down again.
His mouth is watering.
His legs are shorter and he has to walk twice as quickly.
“And what about this, hm?
And isn’t that just the way these things always seem to go.
His eyes are riveted on John, and John can feel the responding awareness in his body, the warmth and tingle of so much concentrated attention.
“She’ll like that.
Sherlock seems furious, and John is downright worried now, worried to speak up, to explain the truth, but…
I think she’s hopeful you will move in and keep the flat better than I do.”
“What’s this for then?”
Perhaps I should.”
“It happened off and on that whole quarter.
This is ludicrous.
“As much as you’re able.
“Sorry.”
He sniffs, his fingers trembling slightly against Sherlock’s skin.
John’s brows furrow a little, but he doesn’t ask anything further.  “Mmm. Bit small, but nice. Big enough for us.”
Simple chatter.
“Of course, whatever you deem best.”
All of this.
Have you ever participated in a professional cuddling session before?”
“I’d rather stay here.”
John knows he loves Sherlock.
He’s not sure he’s ever had something dedicated to him before.
They kiss, and kiss until Rosie’s soft stirrings sound over the baby monitor.
“Yes.
John is sitting across from him.
Christ, he needs to get more fit.
Let’s get back to it.
And he feels Sherlock plump further against his palm.
“The sexting maybe.”
There has been a lot of travel and visiting lately.
“What about you?”
Gentleman farmer, and all that.
“Just wait.”
He chuckles when he hears him grumble about Sherlock leaving his dressing gowns strewn about.
“I’m giving the orders here.
“Perhaps, a little.”
The sun sets early this time of year, and John doesn’t really want to be caught in the woods in the cold come dark.
John frowns.
“Sod Mycroft.
“Yes.”
“Hey bug.”
“Feels good to have a change.”
“Perhaps it’s best to cross that bridge if you come to it?”
He shuffles through the few papers on the desktop, and in the desk’s two small drawers.
from the lounge when he finishes.
He dips his head in once to check on Rosie, who is already asleep.
There is a small stone ledge tucked just to the right of where the water is pouring over the edge of the wall, and Arthur is there, drenched to the bone, shivering, body pressed as close to the stone wall as he can.
“Right.
“Odd?”
Sherlock leans back and lets his eyes slide shut, lets the breeze tickle his eyelashes, and lift the curls from his still clammy forehead.
He does as ordered, long, slow strokes through his hair with his fingers.
Do better, Dr. Watson.”
He should think of unpleasant things, decidedly off-putting things. He thinks of necrotic lungs, of his brother prattling endlessly away about politics, about Molly Hooper talking about having copious amounts of sex with her boyfriend du jour.
John is up there somewhere, sitting alone in the dark.
“That you chose to honeymoon in a house owned by your ex.”
“I’m an open book.
“Oh, so now I’m stupid?!”
True, but unexpected.
And in any case, it would be counterproductive with you.”
“Ah well, that’s our doing, not nature’s I imagine.
“Mmm.”
John finishes piling up some books on his desk, and props his phone up on top of them.
She take a sip of tea from the cup John’s just handed her.
And so Sherlock is able to catch himself, to correct without the usual pang of guilt and irritation.
It’s quiet.
“That doesn’t make any sense.”
“Lovely, isn’t it.”
“Let me just go get a comb.”
A puff of a breath explodes over Sherlock’s neck, cool against the damp of John’s tears smeared against his skin.
Sherlock takes the mug, takes a sip, and then breathes deep through his nose in appreciation.
I would rather you ask.”
“I’ve embarrassed you.
“I think he’s gotten under both our skins, yeah?
“Mr. Holmes, if you are suggesting…!”
It doesn’t move, just stays there, a warm weight.
“What you should have done was not left me.
Sherlock blinks.
“Mind you eat that.”
It’s really quite ridiculous.
“These are Greek.
“Alright.”
John balks when told they’re leaving London, grumbles about never getting a say, and how some things never change, sniffs, and slams things, and tells Sherlock to pack warm, and bring extra blankets, and ‘oh, don’t forget your favourite tea,’ when it all comes down to it.
He stopped coming to the library.
His words run together, loose tongued, loose limbed, a lock of hair has come loose and is hanging over one eye.
The train pulls into the station in York and Sherlock sighs, bone weary at the prospect of hiring a car, driving to Malton, and then trying to find a place to stay before he heads for the school.
He keeps touching him, keeps him teetering on the brink, and when John’s eyes find his again, he holds them, telegraphs what he’s asking, as clearly as he can in that strange way they seem to have of almost reading one another’s minds.
“Yes.
It takes John’s breath away, and it helps him make a decision he’s been mulling over on some level or another, for months, whether he’s realised it or not.
Sherlock wants him here at his side, he’s made that amply clear, on more than one occasion since John moved back, and that’s enough.
I think we need to.”
“How are you feeling?”
“You have to feel this.”
“God,”
“Forgive me.”
You okay?”
“Of course.”
John shakes his head.
“I know.”
“Right.
“Yeah.”
“Yeah, okay.
It looks like the latest model iPhone.
I didn’t realise that then.
She scratched something in German into the floor while she was dying?
Suddenly desperate for the scent, the weight, the taste of him against his tongue.
“Always thinking of your stomach.”
She wrings one side of her cardigan in her clammy hands, and trembles everywhere.
Their more erotic explorations the last couple of weeks have been something altogether new, and John is still trying to adapt to the idea that they might be branching into new territory, and so this familiar coming together is a comfort of a kind.
Let that excellent landlady of yours feed you both up.
“I—I don’t…”
Then there’s the curly-haired brunette with the sea glass eyes.
“Mmm, there’s a large pond, or small lake, depending who you ask, in the middle of Friston Woods.
“Said I made a mess of you, probably.”
I—I want it.
“I was there, interviewing her.
They tell me things.
I’m capable of that.
He suspects that John is not naturally a side sleeper.
As you wish.”
“Right.
“I love you, too.”
“Was kind of grateful for the case, though.
“Yeah, I told you, they didn’t have duck.
Thunder rumbles outside, retreating into the night again, the rain slows to a sprinkle.
His eyes travel over every inch of John’s face.
Not like you’re ever just staring at the back of your own neck.”
He suddenly realises quite clearly that there is something he hopes John is thinking, and that this thing he hopes for flies in the face of all evidence, and all logic.
He turns around and leaves again, hopeful that perhaps John still hadn’t caught on.
He imagines those too.
“Did she give a name?”
You okay?”
“You’re worried about him.
The next morning breaks crisp and crystalline.
Basic Training.
John rubs a hand over his eyes, trying to wipe away the headache he can feel coming on.
“I’m sorry.”
“He may be a suspect.”
“Of course.
Have to dash.”
John hasn’t acknowledged it yet, but he will.
It’s little moments like these, where the words drop so easily and casually from Sherlock’s lips, that still take him by surprise, and please him to no end.
Her son’s cheeks flush and his eyes flit away.
Ella offers.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say.
Might do.”
He has a fire going in the hearth.
He’s missed something.
“Then no.”
He doesn’t know if it’s okay—if
Just stop worrying, okay.
He means everything, all of it.
“‘Course I will.
“Have you ever been high?”
He gets up and grabs his phone and earbuds with microphone.
“He’s been letting me help him on his cases a bit.”
After fifteen minutes have passed he gets up and wanders back to the loo.
He presses his nose against him, breathes, and hears John gasp.
Sherlock hates the easy way John and Lestrade seem to find an instant rapport, when it took Sherlock months to be sure where he stood with the man, and even now, almost two years on, he still finds himself sometimes wondering.
When he gets back to lounge, Sherlock is standing in front of the hearth, holding his hands out toward the stove.
It’s not what he thought their first kiss would be.
“I’m fine.”
John—always so buttoned up, always so careful, held in tight, and now his hands have dropped (his walls have dropped), and he is standing before Sherlock, almost shy, waiting…
Afterwards, he decides to walk the rest of the way since the weather is fine.
You have my word.
“What?”
He takes a deep breath, turns back toward the flat.
Sherlock wracks his brain for ways he might break the ice, but comes up empty handed.
They sit in silence listening to her until she settles again.
“Just come out!”
Shut yourselves away for at least a week, and then maybe—go on holiday somewhere, until all this blows over.”
He’s late.
John shifts, turns in Sherlock’s arms, and surges against him, a riptide of need, dragging Sherlock under, overwhelming him in seconds, and Sherlock lets him.  He seems to need this, this flurry of tongue, and teeth, hands everywhere, frantic pushes and thrusts that can find no purchase, as he tries to get close enough and fails again and again here in the middle of the room.
Shirt first.
“Feels—feels like…
“That happened before?”
“Fine.
They all pause, and then a few seconds after the last of the clattering dissolves into silence, the distant voice of a child echoes in the darkness.
So, there was no phone on the body or in the case?
He sees Sherlock’s shoulders drop with relief, and his hand dips lower, knuckles grazing over his chest, over nipples peaked and hard beneath the thin fabric of his shirt.
“What is this, we’re doing?”
John stands up and spins around, and Sherlock takes a small step back as he advances on him.
John looks over at his suspiciously acquiescent patient, sitting and sipping his tea innocently, and narrows his eyes.
take a break, Sherlock.
She said it was all very discrete, but she could tell, and it had worried her something awful.”
“I don’t know.”
“Christ, you’re so bloody tall.”
But now he just finds himself curious, and hungry for any little glimpse he can catch.
“Come here…”
John lays back down, rolls onto his back, and pulls the blankets up under his chin.
“Think Holdernesse is a colleague.”
You can say it.”
The line clicks dead, and Sherlock stares down at his phone and then hurls it across the room.
“You will never improve if you don’t apply yourself.
Get on with it!”
“So what?
No one has looked at him like that in such a very long time.
He sets the bath bomb carefully in the water, and sniffs appreciatively as it spins across the surface, releasing a scent that is somehow simultaneously erotic and homely.
Holdernesse looks up.
Sherlock sits down beside him, and does the only thing he knows to do, the one thing that has been allowed in the past.
John goes silent, glances over at him, and then…
He didn’t even recognise when he, himself, craved touch that wasn’t sex.
When he opens his eyes again Sherlock’s bare chest is flushed scarlet at the praise.
He still doesn’t know how to process his responses to John these last couple of weeks.
He has no doubt of that now.
And it’s nearly time for supper.
Sherlock goes around the side of the bed, and crawls in.
John puts more and more of his weight against Sherlock’s hands, lowering himself slowly, slowly, but Sherlock doesn’t think he can hold him much longer, and…
“Is it?”
Be right back.”
Sherlock.
Well, the locals can relax, because the gays are only back until next weekend.
John squints at the small screen in the dark.
“Not sure that’s entirely…”
With a strangled cry that sounds more like a sob of relief than pleasure, he spills between their bodies, and then shudders, and collapses against Sherlock, totally still.
I need sex, and I’m not a slag, so no romantic relationship, no sex.
“Don’t be a dick.”
“Alright.”
“You want me to tell you what I’m doing?”
“Thank you,” Sherlock offers for them both.
Dr. Carlton sighs.
“John…?”
I think it’s about a case.”
Sherlock goes because the thought of not accepting the offer is utterly unfathomable.
People say these things to each other every day, and there’s no reason he should be the bloody exception.
Somewhere in the back of his head he wonders why now?  Why after everything, after he almost lost John, after months of careful dancing around one another, followed by tension, followed, again, so swiftly by disaster, are they here now, doing this like they’ve been doing it all along, no months of nothing, no fear, no hesitation, a relief, almost, a joyful thing.
It’s not like that.”
Carry on.”
“Is that good news?”
Sherlock’s eyes snap up to John’s face, and John smiles—that crooked, fond, slightly sad smile that only seems reserved for Sherlock.
“Why?”
It looks warm, and inviting, and…
Still doesn’t feel real, but…
After a few minutes of pacing the kitchen, he sits down and tries not to panic (
“Christ.
I didn’t think of how it might look.
John picks up, speaks before Sherlock can even say his name.
“Fine.
Sherlock starts to shrug out of his coat and jacket as the trail ascends a small hill, and John smiles at the line of sweat soaking through the fine, white, silk-cotton blend of his shirt.
“Clear?!”
Back then it had been clear it was part performance, but this—this is raw instinct, this is vulnerable.
It’s long enough for him to start to feel cold.
Sherlock sighs and stands up suddenly.
“You were a child.”
“I do.
But all things considered, I believe I’ve faired rather better.”
“You said it was warm.”
“Right.”  John begins to eat again, a little more quickly than before.  His movements are precise, measured.  There is a tension there.  Anticipation.  Arousal.  The eagerness to move on from one order to the next.  Sherlock can’t help but feel the tingle of anticipation himself.
Sort of like it cleans away everything that seems so raw and unbearable in the light.
Why not last week?
“Oh yeah?
“No Bun, clothes for Daddy.”
It’s kind of early.”
“A bit.”
I’m okay.”
He does it proper: soft boiled eggs, toast with marmalade, tea.
John removes his hat, and sets it on the nightstand.
The cab pulls up in front of the flat, and John gets out without a word, just walks straight for the door, through it, up the stairs, and into the loo.
“Not because he wasn’t interested.”
“Yes.”
I know a woman at the morgue.
And I stood there, and I stared at this pathetic, unkempt grave, and I just—I don’t know, I just felt so fucking angry.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything.
Ridiculously so.
“Would you like to leave it here for today?”
I need to blow my nose.”
“Yes.
“Yes.  Figure things out as we go.”
“And you’re right, for what it’s worth.”
I didn’t mind, you know.
“Not much, but warm at lea…”
This is his cluttered, dusty, homely flat.
Mycroft’s lips press into a straight line and then stretch into a wry smile that doesn’t reach his eyes.
“I paid for an hour.
In bed!”
What are you…?”
Sherlock looks down at her, at her eyes clouded with genuine concern, and her blouse stained with icing, and some strange toddler yanking at her trouser leg, and he smiles.
If you hurry you can probably catch him.
“Just
There is nothing but sensation, breath, pulse, and the low, warm thrum of slowly building arousal.
“I wanted to avoid that.
There’s something missing?
But a gift is something like a teddy bear, or tricycle, not a free ride through Oxford.”
There’s time for us to go to bed for a bit.”
But there’s no need to rush.
He stops, rests his chin on John’s abdomen and stares up at him, waiting.
“Brought a gift.
John’s eyes flit away from his, and he clicks play, and then sets his laptop back on the small tv tray he’s set up in front of the futon.
It’s something John doesn’t think he’s ever had before.
You’ve got a couple of broken ribs I think.”
“I see Ella tomorrow at noon.
“Come on then.”
He’s shaking.
When they arrive, the pub is closed.
“Come here.”
“This better not be you having second thoughts.
John’s heart sinks.
“Best to hurry, though.
John’s face does something strange.  Sherlock isn’t sure if it’s a grin or a grimace.  And then, suddenly, he’s laughing, really, properly laughing for the first time in months, and Sherlock can’t help but laugh a little too.  When John finally manages to pull himself together, he shakes his head, and takes a hearty bite of his supper.  “So all this time, she’s been texting you to see if we’re fucking?”
His stomach is twisting in knots, and he’s more glad than ever that he didn’t eat at lunch.
Yeah, it’s just—still hard sometimes, realising that I’m not what I was befo…”
The closest surgery’s probably in Eastbourne.
“Mm.”
God, I’m—I’m…”
“Right, well that might be—okay, actually.”
“Look at me!”
John’s left it in his court now.
They’ll valet the car.”
“John.”
“Does this qualify as our first row, do you think?”
“Well, good.
John’s legs feel like jelly.  He slides down into Sherlock’s chair, comforted, somehow, by the warmth left behind by his body, and stares down at the screen in front of him.  He shouldn’t, he knows, but he scrolls up in the conversation for context.
Sherlock grins like the utter bastard he is.
John lets him.
All his deductive skills seem utterly useless here.
It seems unlikely.
He swallows dryly.
“Buckingham Palace.”
I’m telling you I want to be here.”
“You do realise that saying stuff like that is going to rile me up, right?
He refuses care when they ask to attend to his bruised and bloodied knuckles.
John takes another long pull of scotch, and grimaces.
Sherlock pouts.
He moved out less than a month after you…
Yeah.
“Alright.”
Sherlock shrugs, but his cheeks are red.
“So good.”
He shouldn’t.
He traces a finger over the texts they had exchanged earlier that morning, scrolls up, hesitates on:
John’s eyes snap to his, and more tears squeeze from the corners to run over his temple.
Sh-Sherlock!”
“Get back in here.
“And I want you to know that I don’t regret a minute, not a single thing we’ve said, not a single thing that’s happened between us.
It’s remarkably vulnerable and honest.
“Wait, you were in the nutcracker?”
And John takes him into his mouth once again.
Sherlock tightens his grip, eyes still shut, feels John’s breath wafting against his eyelashes, his lips.
He smiles fondly.
“It will kill you, you know, that stuff.”
But mostly just incredibly full of—something, something indefinable.
“I didn’t know.”
He shivers and feels a familiar hum whisper across his skin, pool warm, and sweet at his centre.
Maybe this was even their bed.”
As I’ve said, nothing need change.
He needs to sit down for this.
Multiple layers of armour, a myriad of masks, layer after layer of hidden secrets, fears, loves, appetites.
“What if I say
“I’m armed.
It’s raining outside, the sort of all day drizzle that alternates back and forth between fog and fine sleet, and makes everything dismal and grey.
We’re fine.”
“And you’ve never…?”
John just shakes his head.
“Not good?”
He jogs up behind him and takes his arm, sees the way John’s whole body goes instantly tense and alert in the split second before his brain registers who it is who has grabbed him, and then relaxes again.
“Until you texted me this morning, until I came over here, and saw you again, and you knew how I take my coffee without me even having to tell you, and you were inviting me to run off on some adventure with you, and then—god help me, I…”
It could.
He reaches up and rubs at the back of his neck, takes another step away.
“Not drunk now, though, am I?”
John looks down at the questions, and takes a deep breath.
You were much more responsive than I anticipated.”
JOHN!”
Sherlock obediently parts the unfastened placket of his shirt with one finger, allowing John access, and John leans down, presses the cup over his heart, and leans down to listen.
Sherlock has never seen him like this in all the time they’ve known one another (
John turns in his arms, and stares up at him.
With Rosie’s birthday, and…”
“Just breathe, okay.
It’s logical that she wants to find a way to categorise me that aligns with how she sees her peers categorising their adult caretakers.
Sherlock Holmes in a nutshell.
“An early start might not be a bad idea.”
“This wasn’t your fault.
“You don’t have to tell me, John.
He hates himself, but god help him, he doesn’t want to stop.
“Don’t know—this feels like something, like maybe the first good lead we’ve had.”
“Shite.
, “Ffff…
He sits back on his heels.
“How do you do that?”
The video is only shot from his chin down, but he’s wearing the purple shirt John loves, and he cradles the violin like something precious and dear.
“I have notes from John’s other therapist here, she says that John’s said that he disarmed you, but then he let his anger over Mary’s death, and other unresolved issues between you come to a head, and he acted on that anger, and took things much further.
Sherlock shivers, aches, thrills, despite the pounding in his head, and the nausea starting to build in the pit of his stomach.
Warm, and pulsing, and it just washes over you in wave, after wave, after wave, and it doesn’t stop.
“A proper chat?”
“Keep talking,” Sherlock pants.
“You’re not.”
Sadly, the video is over all too soon.
After what we just shared, not bloody likely, and for the record, never have done, not once, so you can just wipe that whole idea from that great brain of yours.
Just to wipe the cobwebs from his brain, just to help him find his next distraction, and to quell the unceasing ache and longing in blood and bone.
“Hey,” John says a little quieter.
“Oh, alright.
When he does his eyes look full.
“Do you want to ask for clarification about what John was talking about before?”
It’s the sort of elicit, slightly dangerous thing that John lives for, and that is probably making his situation all the more precarious, which is, in turn, turning him on all the more.
He clicks.
Normally he would fear the coming of day, fear that it would mean John getting up, going, returning to his tiny, spare flat, his clients.
The world was a cage of his own making and everything and everyone had to fit or Christ help you…”
“Yeah, well, people are idiots, remember.”
“Perhaps not.
John nods toward the risotto.
John drops his head and smiles at the sound of Sherlock’s voice, before dashing across the abandoned road, and climbing gratefully inside.
“No, I don’t think I will.”
“You’re right.
Presses his lips to the base of his cock, his eyes sliding shut, his breath escaping through his nose to waft against Sherlock’s shaft, and Sherlock’s breath hitches, his head goes light, his eyes prick, and he lets out a moan so loud it surprises even him.
“Saved his life, probably.”
“Thought you’d be bored to tears by now.”
“You.
He’s hot, except for the back of his neck exposed to the cool breeze wafting in through the window.
“Your first male—this?”
John says with as much conviction as he can muster.
He orders his drink and food, and settles into a table near the back.
He can feel his cheeks heat at how needy it sounds, at how much it reveals.
When it finally releases him, he lies panting and dizzy, tears squeezing from the corners of his eyes, the metallic taste of blood against his tongue, and realises too late that he’s forgotten all about the tissue, and has soiled the sheets and his t-shirt quite thoroughly.
He sighs with relief.
If somehow, in that infuriating way of his, he knew.
“Yes,”
It’ll set some sort of precedent, make him beholden, but Christ if he doesn’t need the money.
Tell me what you want.”
Last night he’d…
I was very close with the Tregennises.
John’s fingers stir near his spine.
In past relationships he’d always started off burning hot, and then felt that diminish a little more with each passing day, until the thing he’d thought was love finally guttered and died.
“I know.
“Do you?”
“Tell me.”
“Well, I’m sure they got on fine.”
“Let me see.”
Perhaps the resident gentlemen before us had your penchant for holiday frippery.”
It’s not that he isn’t aware of some of the eyes that have flitted to their table and quickly away again, when it became apparent, mostly due to Angelo’s boisterous greeting, that this was a date, rather than two men simply sharing a meal.
Soup?”
I’m only here for moral support.”
Sherlock nods in agreement.
“Oh shit, the bags.”
Perhaps the owner might still like to use them some day.
“You got a key?”
“Yes, or repetitive, soft mechanical sounds.”
It’s a morning like any other morning, but it feels significant, somehow.
“You’re not sending this to your mother!”
He tucks the end in more firmly and starts to root about where John directed him.
I’ve wanted you for so long, I…”
I still remember the day I woke up and couldn’t remember the exact colour of your eyes.”
He sucks in another breath, and then another and another.
I composed a great deal while contemplating your nape.”
“Mmm?”
She announces.
To stay very still and let John settle, let him decide.
John stirs, whimpers softly, and Sherlock reaches for his hand without thought.
Hope that’s okay.”
Wrapped in a fine paper that looks like something you’d see on the walls in an old Edwardian cottage.
“Uhuhh…
You just look—different, that’s all.
When he looks up, to his chagrin, he can see that Sherlock has stopped to study some truly ugly jumpers, something he knows John would never wear, and John suspects he’s doing it on purpose.
“You weren’t okay.”
Good lord!
Pick up your phone. It’s me.
“Oh?”
John holds on a little tighter.
Don’t remember it being like this since I was a boy.
He does so love to be dramatic.”
“Alright, go ahead.”
Sherlock nods.
“Ah, and here to answer all your questions is Ms. Sterndale.”
“Good.
Sherlock shakes his head vigorously, eyes wide, almost desperate.
That has been one of the most pleasant surprises in all this, the way that Sherlock has warmed to their physical intimacy, just a taste, and suddenly he was all in.
You want to do that again?”
Today has been a lot.
Give me a minute.”
Sherlock glances back over his shoulder with a roll of his eyes.
But, what on earth were you thinking?!
He will text in an hour to discuss supper.
“You know why we’re here, yeah?
Sherlock sighs, crawls over, turns around, folds himself in half and shoves his arse in John’s face.
Just getting started.”
“You okay?”
He’s too tired to make it up tonight.
He’s trembling with the effort of holding back.
“Come here, then.”
“Doesn’t have to be sex, I—I just want to touch you.”
It lights Sherlock up.
“Well…?”
I’ll go with you.”
He’s just being greedy now, and it’s almost cruel to bring up everything that happened after Sherlock’s return, but he wants to hear it, and he needs Sherlock to know that it was something John had chosen to do, take himself away and out of Sherlock’s life.
“I was difficult.
I know about that.
Or perhaps…”
“Figured it was yours.”
He’s floating.
“There’s no one there to buy milk, and Mrs. Hudson’s shepherd’s pie is an embarassment.”
“You started this nonsense.”
“I’m not perfect either, Sherlock.
You, you feel hard, and hot.”
He reaches down, and places his hands over John’s knees, guides them slowly apart, and then slides into the V he’s just created between between them.
Seems a decent bloke.
He shouldn’t bother him.
He sits down the edge of the bed the second they get there, and lets John push him back down against the mattress, and drown him in a flood of messy, desperate kisses while he grinds relentlessly against him.
Yes.”
“Oh, and Sherlock, if this new little distraction of yours is another of those things that is going to end with me tracking you down in a dosshouse minutes before you succumb to overdose, do do me a favour and end it now.
Something behind John’s eyes shifts from rage to fear, and for a moment Sherlock considers stopping, but they’ve been teasing the edges of this thing, whatever it is, ever since John moved back in, and they can’t keep going on this way.  It’s a dangerous game they play with one another. It’s always been. That will likely never change, that toying the edges, walking the razor fine edge between healing and utter obliteration. Best to press on.
Sherlock just stares.
“Come here.
“Where the fuck are Lestrade’s people?”
It’s fine.
“I don’t.”
After what seems like an age, three police cars and an ambulance screech to a halt at the end of the alley, and John shouts over the rush of the rain to the paramedics running down the pavement toward them.
Rosie is trotting across the sand toward them, red bucket in hand, and what looks like a squirming starfish held aloft in one hand.
“He’s in emotional shock.
It’s my job to keep you busy, and I’ve been neglecting it.”
Baker Street.
I just saw your bloody brother a few minutes ago, can’t believe he’s run tattling already.
“The less you know, the safer you are.”
He can hear the bemusement in John’s voice.
“Nonsense.”
Just so.”
Liked when you did.
He finally looks up, and Sherlock is looking at him, just looking, in that way he has, that one look that undoes John every damn time, because it’s just so…
Sherlock is standing in the middle of the lounge, naked, shivering, and John’s sure that if there’s anyone in the flats across the street they can probably see him.
“I don’t know what you want me to say?”
“And you say I’m the romantic one.”
Isn’t it evidence?
“Unfair.”
Obviously.”
“Stop thinking, I can hear you all the way in here!”
“In our first interview you said you would check-in, a lot,” Sherlock reminds him.
“What?”
It’s nothing.”
It doesn’t take long at all, and then suddenly John’s tongue is filling him, not very deep of course, but it’s enough to make stars pop in front of his eyes, to draw a gut-deep groan from his throat, and to tip him precariously over the brink.
“Yeah, well—give me a few minutes to get used to—things.”
Both Sherlock and Rosie’s eyes snap up to him, instantly at attention.
Sherlock will wait.
“Skiving off.”
“What happened to her?”
“Stop holding back.
“It’s not…
It’s fine.
“I think you might be a bad influence.”
The rain outside is pattering against the huge windows beside him, and the central heat is whirring warmly overhead, and all around him is the soft hum of pages turning, and people whispering, and the distant soft beeps from the checkout counter at the other end of the library.
You’re angry at yourself.
Sherlock does, watches a small red bead form where he has sliced of a chunk of his skin.
“Thought I was smarter than I looked.
Wanna see you come.”
They gave you a sense of belonging, of camaraderie, and perhaps even tightened the bond of your friendships.
“Don’t want to come too soon.”
“Hey…”
“Doctor Watson, with all due respect…”
Jesus Christ, you’re…
“You okay?”
You can’t—you can’t put that on yourself.”
“Right.
He looks a little like a well-dressed librarian.
“And might you be feeling that need right now?”
He removes the shards, cleans the cuts, stitches John up.
And then he remembers how things began to change, and how he would see a look in Victor’s eyes, sometimes, a look like the one he’d just seen in John’s eyes: shame, fear, avoidance.
“What.
“Oh.”
“You stay out of this.”
Well—John feels spoiled beyond belief.
John waits for him to say more, but it seems as though nothing more is forthcoming.
“Problem?”
Sherlock moves to a nearby rock and sits down on it to don his skates, and John joins him, nudging him a little bit with his shoulder.
He waits for John’s shout of release, before pumping a few more times, and coming himself, all over John’s belly.
And now all the confidence, the commanding presence of before is flagging, and he sees the Sherlock he only very rarely gets to see, the one he likes to pretend doesn’t exist—unsure, afraid.
Sherlock can see the weight of that one word settle into John’s bones:
I stay separate.
“How?”
John squirms a little in anticipation.
No central heating?”
“Yeesss…”
“Handling what, exactly?”
John grins.
“What?  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, I’ve been here since they brought you in.”
“I’ll text you at my lunch break.”
John smiles against Sherlock’s neck, and slides his lips up close to his ear.
“I’m here.
“And how am I supposed to know that?”
How many friends do you imagine he has?”
“Can a bit, actually.
Finally Sherlock moves.
I realise that I haven’t had opportunity to prove my resolve in that, but none-the-less, I do feel it somewhat early to write me off entirely.”
Letting go—of everything.
He’s always been a markedly un-sexual being.
Sherlock makes a feeble attempt, but eventually drags himself far enough off that John can roll over to stare up at the ceiling, effectively smearing his own come all over his hip and back.
“She made it up.  A bit of revenge, I suppose.  Can’t really blame her.”
“I suppose it’s my turn to talk, isn’t it.”
“Right.
I wanted it.
The tears in Sherlock’s eyes spill over, and John reaches down to thumb them from his cheeks.  “Come on, then.  I’ll even let you use my sandalwood bathbomb.”
Really.”
“Fuck.”
“Of course.”
Sherlock replies, as he looks back up.
And Sherlock just—doesn’t do that.
“But you’re scared.”
“Toys?”
Things have felt different lately, you’ve seemed—anxious that perhaps you’ve outworn your welcome, and I worried that—that we were reaching a place where something had to happen, and so I suppose that behind it all was simply the hope that…”
The cottage is growing dark, even though it is only three in the afternoon.
“It was—transcendent.”
And he thinks he knows John well enough by now, to know that it might be difficult for him.
“Then, what…?”
“Alright.”
People are staring.
For you.
“Yes.
A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N
Sherlock’s face is an unreadable blank.
“Go away…”
Sherlock moans, and John smiles against his skin.  “God. Sherlock. Missed you so much.”
“Can’t argue that.”
And John smiles against his shoulder, and presses, waits, and feels his own cock twitch when Sherlock takes him in with a small
I’ve never—I’ve never been that way with someone before.
We’ll drop by the station tomorrow to wrap things up.”
“You just saying that?”
“Did one of them die in it?”
You don’t have to do it again if it makes you uncomfortable.
John shifts atop him, leans down a little.
He’s panicking, clearly panicking.
“Mmm, too soon perhaps?”
The room is still and quiet, except for the sound of Sherlock dropping onto his arse on the floor beside him with an odd, strangled sound.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, but it’s true, probably, he thinks.
“Seems fair.”
He glances over at the sliding door Sherlock has just disappeared through.
But why?”
He is going to cry.
Ready to do all the things that no one ever did for him.
And John lets Sherlock touch him, for the first time this way, lets him slide his hands down his back, over his arse, lets them settle there, warm and large, lets him pull their bodies closer, lets their half hard cocks settle and press bare against one another.
When John’s head finally snaps up Sherlock can’t read what he sees in his eyes at all.
John waits for a look of shock, or discomfort, or surprise.
I always told him he had nothing to worry about with me, to lay off.
But do remember we’re both adults.
He clicks the lid shut and slumps back.
“Not sure I’d characterise it like that.
John sighs as though horribly put upon, eyes rolling to the ceiling, and shifts a little in his seat.
John whispers.
Something has to happen.
I’ll talk to you later.
“It’s alright, Mrs. Roundhay.
“People rarely disappoint when it comes to being horrible, John.
“Information. Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you’d feel ... uncomfortable with. Just tell me what he’s up to.”
“Yes.
“I’d rather stay here.”
He reaches between them and lays his hand over both of John’s, where they’re tucked up by his chest.
“The scotch?”
John feels his cheeks heat.
He sighs and rubs a hand down his thigh again.
“Stuff?”
Everything narrows to the sensation of John sliding and clenching around him, seemingly tighter with every thrust, and to the sounds John makes, wild and uninhibited.
‘Course I would.
“What is it we can do for you.”
He was—lonely, I think.
John pulls in, and stares out the windscreen at the brick dwelling in front of them.
You didn’t come last night.
And he wonders if it’s Santa Claus himself, because he has no idea who else would come out in such weather, and it would only be with a sled and reindeer that anyone could traverse the mess of the roads.
The ‘Fuck, fuck, oh Jesus, fuck,’ as the orgasm strings out, seems to last longer than Sherlock imagines an orgasm could, wrings John dry.
‘Course I did.
“Yeth.
“Yeah?”
“Always
He reaches out and presses a finger between Sherlock’s eyebrows, and then grins when the furrow there only deepens with Sherlock’s confusion.
He insists on going to work the next day, and comes home at noon.
Don’t ruin it.”
And when John says nothing in return.
“And you have work that you love—
“Last night was—nice.
“Too fucking right.
Sherlock’s body is a weight beside, and over him.
They can’t eat takeaway five days in a row anymore, they can’t pull all-nighters without a headache the next day, and they can’t chase shadowy figures down damp cobblestone streets for miles without feeling it for days afterwards, apparently.
Not a good night.
Stop it now.”
Then explain it to me.”
Stop it.
John sniffs derisively.
“Yeah?”
“Now shut up and let these blokes do their thing.”
Sherlock strides over to glance over his shoulder.
But this is bigger than her, bigger than John, and there’s no use fighting so hard against the inevitable.
John wears masks the same as Sherlock does.
Sherlock breathes against his lips
“Clearly.”
“Sherlock?”
One of John’s hands is at his hip, it inches down, between their bodies, and Sherlock thinks he can deduce its intended destination.
He pushes past him.
Bracing.”
The boy sounds desperate and hopeful
Sherlock moans again, and John feels his balls start to pull up.
It’s medicinal, almost astringent.
Okay.
So you’ll forgive me, but I don’t know you well enough to know that your judgement can be trusted.
And then walks off without another word.
He’s always been a solitary boy.
We off then?”
Sherlock doesn’t answer his texts anymore, doesn’t answer his calls.
You’ve been burning the candle at both ends since all this started, and I think you need to take a step back now.
Well then, yeah.
After everything, they were so close.
“Mmm.”
Bond.
“Went home tonight, and realised I don’t want to do this without you.”
We got on.”
Not sure it’s set in stone at this point, but…”
“Sterndale.
Or maybe it’s Sherlock who needs to.
It’s early, and it’s a surprise.”
He rolls away, and gets out of bed, and Sherlock whines again, which just makes John laugh outright.
Without turning around.
“Sherlock, you have to try.  Remember what Ella said.  Now, why?”
“I do want you—all the time.”
“I love you.”
“Let me?”
“Yes.
“No you don’t.
She shakes her head and turns to John.
“That okay?”
John’s fingers stroke through his hair, ease his head back.
“Yes.”
“Tell me.”
“Of course I’m sure!”
John’s hand darts out, as though reaching for Sherlock’s cheek, but then drops to his shoulder, instead, giving it a brief squeeze before he sits up and swings his legs over the side of the bed.
Sherlock hears the small intake of breath, the way John holds it, and then slowly lets it out again.  He sniffs.  “For her and me?”
Just you.”
“For everything.”
“Yes.”
John sputters out a laugh.
And Sherlock’s fingers are scrambling up John’s ribs, around his back, pulling him down into his arms until he can breathe again.
I meant to tell you, so many times, but...
He leans in and squints.
That’s enough now, okay.
“Yes, well…  You didn’t seem all that keen on being tended to by my brother’s minders.”
London is aware.
Something clenches tight in his chest.  He feels like he’s drowning.  His eyes bite and burn.  The texts go back months, well over a year, and that is when Sherlock had gotten a new phone, so it’s possible they’d chatted for longer than that.  Months and months of words, and always his name is there, in the middles of it all: john, John,
I’ve told you I want it, it’s just—this is my first time since…”
“God, I’m…
He’s injured trying to protect his mother, and she dies anyway, abandons him, and his father remarries, and then suddenly there’s a wife, and a baby, essentially taking his father away too, and Jack is left alone, wholly alone.”
He pulls back and stares down at him.
“Suppose it would be for a Duke’s son.”
Bloody ridiculous, but here he is…
“Yeah, well—we can’t all be a posh git.”
I will but, but not…”
John hears the playfulness come back to Sherlock’s voice.
Mrs. Hudson has been and left, leaving tea and biscuits in her wake, but Sherlock doesn’t have time to offer John any, because John has reached out and taken hold of the cuff of his shirt, and is leading him back into the kitchen, into the chair he had only vacated a few moments prior, pushing him down into it and stepping into the V of his legs to stare down at him.
Sherlock sighs, hot and long into his hair, and John hears him fiddling about with the lube again, and then his hands return to John’s arse, and his fingers
It’s not cold.
“I want my—I want my best friend back.
“What?”
Sleep now.”
That is how I would define it.”
“Champion Jack, perhaps?”
He watches John’s eyes droop, and slowly close, watches the tears squeeze from beneath his closed lids to trail down his temples.  Sherlock reaches out and thumbs them away, and John turns into the touch, and then drifts with his head cradled in Sherlock’s hand.
“Mmm…”
He can feel the adrenaline drop.
“Do you know why?”
“We were at Bart’s together.”
John’s growing hard already, a hot, hard line between them.
He’d given his notice to his landlord, packed up all his things, and been mortified that everything he owned in the world fit in one large suitcase.
And if you never want to act on them, or you do want to act on them, then that’s fine, but I never, ever, want you to feel as though…
Go ahead.”
“Yeah.
He takes his hand out of his pocket and keeps walking.
For my birthday.
It always happens.
You must be having me on.
“Feel good?”
No. This is a job for Dr. Watson, not me.
It helps to clear his head and quell his anger as he marches down the street to the park.
“You okay?”
“Might?”
John sets his book and glasses down on the nightstand, rearranges his pillows, lies back, and pats his chest.
They are a strange family, the Holmeses, the whole lot of them.
“What did you have in mind?”
And John wonders how it is that this tiny drop of praise from Sherlock’s lips can make him blush like a callow school boy.
He breathes through his nose, and lets it build.
I know who killed her.”
“Listen, if this is going to be a business call, maybe we should bring it inside.”
What journalist?
I mean it, Sherlock.
“Most probably.
She shrugs.
“You killed Mort Tregennis.”
He should be embarrassed by that, but Sherlock’s arms just hold him tighter.
“You don’t need to nurse me.
Even if that meant never seeing you again.”
“I’m lost without you.”
“I’m an idiot.” Sherlock whispers into his hair.
Sherlock smiles.
John Watson is going to be one of those people.
Rosie yanks on his trouser leg.
“On well enough for him to loan you the family seaside cottage at a moment’s notice?”
Sherlock nods.
John huffs.
John whispers like he’s in church.
I quite obviously and undeniably want you, and I…”
When John’s hand lifts, and his fingers weave into Sherlock’s hair, he pushes his face into the crook of John’s neck, and breathes in the scent of him, until his heart calms, and the image of John lying in a pool of his own blood fades from his mind.
John feels his cheeks flare.
John just nods.
Finally he settles, thinks about other nights lying alone in the dark under this same roof, far away from home, his room, his dog, everything familiar.
“If you want.”
“God yes.
“It’s different.”
“You wanted to know why I’ve been pulling away the last few months?” he offers after draining the glass.
It is his fault.
They were trainers that had belonged to—to a friend of mine from school.
Sherlock wants to tell John that he knows, but he’s smart enough to know it might derail things, and so he keeps quiet, waits, barely dares breath in the fear of stopping John now.
Yeah.
Sherlock squeezes his arm and gently nudges it toward his chest.
It’s slow building, but it always is.
Nothing more.”
Forgot I had that set.”
Sherlock looks up, waits until John finally manages to look at him.
He pulls away from the kiss panting.
“No.”
John sighs.
He tries not to think about what he’s just done.
Don’t you dare.
“Speaking of.”
Sherlock sucks in a ragged breath, wills himself not to make a sound, but John hesitates anyway, slowly retreats, hands returning to his lower back, and then suddenly squeezing, firm, kneading the muscle either side of his spine and pulling their bodies achingly close.
And then Science starts to read.
Sherlock sounds careful, like he knows he’s overstepped.
“There you go…
He can feel his cheeks heating much to his irritation.
Clearly one John’s pieced together using some pre-set template.
“John.”
So, he wants to give off the impression of having money, but is, at least at present, somewhat hard up.
“Good?”
Sherlock swings his legs over the side of the bed and rubs a hand over his face.
“You want me inside?”
They sit like that, Sherlock’s body cradled by John’s, John’s fingers carding slow trails through his hair, his breath slowly guiding Sherlock’s back into a more regular rhythm, until the water starts to cool, and every, single one of Sherlock’s muscles has gone to jelly.
“John…”
“I think we’ve got it all well managed.
It’s his own fault, all of it, everything his fault—always, and what right has he to cry about any of it.
“So it seems,” Holdernesse agrees.
Don’t go, okay.
“Listen, I—I know you saw her as a friend, and I think she saw you the same, she loved you in her own way, but…”
John laughs and hopes he doesn’t sound anxious.
“Bit busy.”
Sherlock smiles rather drunkenly, still too sleepy to hide.
Sherlock looks at him, for a moment, flushed, and plump, and twitching.
You look a little feverish.
No, John is scarred, and soft, and fiercely, impressively strong (in so many ways), and Sherlock can read whole stories written on his flesh.
Sherlock squirms a little in his chair.  His trousers are becoming uncomfortably snug.  If he doesn’t do something he will be too distracted to focus on John as he should, and that will never do.  He gets to his feet, starts stripping out of his shirt before he’s even through the kitchen.  He tries not to think about it, just to act.  John can send him off again, if the surprise isn’t to his liking, but John seems to like the unpredictable, the slightly dangerous, being kept on his toes.
He pulls gently at his hip, urging him to turn, and then looks up at him and smiles.
Well…”
Sherlock just shakes his head.
John doesn’t resist.
John makes more tea.
“I know you’ve never…  If you want to take time to get used to the idea, that’s okay.  And if you never want to…”
Sherlock winks, and to his delight John’s eyes drop away with a pleased smile.
But for me…”
I’ll be okay.
“Yeah?”
“It made me feel safe.”
After a moment he rolls onto his side to face him.
It takes Sherlock a moment to realise that he’s the one who’s said it.
John starts awake, tears his hand from Sherlock’s, eyes wild.
“But, you’re okay?”
“Alright.
Yeah, just—come up here.
“I know you well enough, and I’m growing quite bored of continually having this conversation, as I said last night.
“I do.”
But he stops short.
John races after him, and when he finally catches up, Sherlock reaches back and takes his hand, in the middle of the crowded street, he takes his hand, and just keeps on running.
“I—can I?”
“Yes.”
He jerks his chin in the direction of the street.
Silence descends on the garden, save for the soft clicking of the oak branches in wind.
“Sorry she ruined your surprise.”
He hesitates, looks up.
John turns to look at him instead.
John can hear her on the baby monitor beside the bed.
“Hoped.
“Was good then?”
“Wasn’t.
He looks desperate.
John is a dead weight atop of him, heavy, grounding, panting against the bruise he’d just marked into Sherlock’s flesh, and there’s something about the warm, delicious weight of him, that stirs the pool of pleasure building in Sherlock’s belly, makes it heat, and build, and throb, until he feels heady with the steady, aching tension.
“It will be fine, John.
“Though, speaking of, aren’t we leaving for your mystery destination bright and early?”
He nods.
The tub is as full as is advisable if two people are going to crawl in, and so Sherlock shuts off the water and does just that, settling in with a sigh.
It feels good.
“Shh…
“You want me to touch you?”
Sight for sore eyes.
Sherlock nods.
You don’t just fix people, Sherlock.
This isn’t meant to be—amorous.
John tries to reassure him.
My personal physician will be there, and at your service, and I believe we should also inform the police of Hayes’ escape?”
Really, you are the most exasperating patient.”
He looks up from his lap.
“It’s most likely withdrawal,” he murmurs low enough for Rosie not to hear.
There’s no reply.
“I see.”
“Sherlock, I—It just always feels unwanted.”
Here?”
Five pips, and a photo of Mrs. Hudson’s basement flat.
Wake up.
John huffs, and looks away.
Can catch a football match maybe.”
Sherlock makes a mental note to make room in the dresser, and to get a second wardrobe.
John actually sounds angry, and it’s rather encouraging.
He presses a kiss into Sherlock’s curls and feels Sherlock’s breath puff against his neck.
But hollow, reaching, tugging, like the whole of his body is this great empty thing that only John can fill.
John’s eyes find his and he relaxes again.
And so Sherlock does.
This case is getting under his skin.”
Last night had been bad.
He does eat it, though he swallows each bite as though it’s dry as sandpaper and he’s unaccustomed to food tasting like anything but.
It’s not an option.
John’s cock fills and twitches with interest.
Looks like you, and it says, William S. Holmes.”
At least—no one of importance.”
All there is is the tension building in his belly, the white hot, curling ache that builds and builds as John’s mouth works a kind of magic around him.
“Could probably say the same to you.”
There are things that can make you touch averse.
“Do you think that the environment in which you met had anything to do with the depth of affection you held for one another?”
John walks close to him, as they stroll back to Baker Street.
It’s…”
John looks up at him, holds his gaze for the briefest of moments, and then drops it again with a shake of his head.
He’s gone pale, and Sherlock wants to get up, to reach out, and pull him against his chest, but he doesn’t know if it’s the right thing, if it would make this better or worse, so he doesn’t move.
It’s good when it happens, and he’s content.
When he sways on his feet, John pulls back and nods toward the bed, and Sherlock goes willingly, slides onto the mattress on his back, and stares at the ceiling for a moment before screwing his eyes shut.
I can’t explain it.
“It was my honour.”
When supper is ready they spread a blanket on the floor in the lounge, and have a picnic in front of the television which thrills Rosie.
He dashed.
“Thought maybe I’d got there too late.”
“I would never work with someone against you.
“She asked and it seemed a good idea.”
I’ve known for a long time.
I’ve made some tea.”
Just a quick trip.”
Rosie is up soon after, and then Mrs. Hudson and Margaret who seem to have a penchant for lying in.
They’re in West Sussex, and Sherlock had swore up and down that morning, that Jack Ferguson would be somewhere in these woods, and yet—here they are, and there’s nothing but birdsong and the soft rustle of leaves.
John tries not to feel disappointed.
“John is my colleague.”
It’s hot and it scalds his tongue.
Bit like being a bartender, which I did in uni.
“I want to see you…”
Does it bother you?”
He’s practically keening.
“And why are you here?”
“Yeah.
“What helps?”
“I don’t think you want to know all the things I want to do to you.”
On the fourth day, he’d got up, and sat in his chair, and stared at Sherlock’s like he was trying to will him back into his rightful place.
“Maybe so, but this flat wasn’t, and that’s just setting yourself up for failure, yeah?”
I was being an idiot.
Won’t happen again.”
Always have, probably.”
You’ll feel better tomorrow.”
This was perhaps even more difficult for him than it was for John to be the one to break the ice and finally say the things that needed saying.
“That’s it.
After a moment she reaches over and pours herself some tea, seemingly satisfied.
needs to do.
Perhaps he’s been holding back all this time, because he thought it was what John wanted?
“I love you.
Go easy.”
“Do you think we should get up at some point?”
I’m going to get undressed.”
Peel, wash, and then use the mandolin.”
Of course.
Sherlock gently prises John’s hand from his wrist, looks down at him, small, and terrified, and coming apart at the seams.
He should have done it the day after Sherlock came back from the dead in a flurry of ill-timed theatrics.
“Spoke to the neighbour down the lane.
The corner of his mouth twitches, but to John’s credit he damps down the grin threatening to escape.
“Seems a bit better than he was right after the Missus died.”
He stacks his bowl with Sherlock’s, gets up and takes them to the sink.
Thus indicating that the good professor was up quite late.”
John feels warm all over.
“‘Night.”
“I don’t know.
Sherlock blinks up at him, cheeks flushed, eyes red-rimmed, burning with shame and gratitude all at once.
“Yeah.”
“No.”
John looks up at him, eyes bloodshot and red rimmed, long lashes still wet and clumped together.
He tosses his new, claret, silk dressing gown over shirt and trousers, and makes his way into the kitchen for tea.
he presses a little more firmly at the spot he’s teasing inside John’s body, and John exhales, surges against him, his cock growing harder.
“I have no intention of going anywhere in this weather.
“Requesting, that you commit all your energies to this.
He leans his head against the cool glass of the window and stares out at the near empty street outside.
“God!”
He’ll pretend nothing is wrong, but then he will sigh deeply, look up from the book he’s reading, or the television show he isn’t really watching, and he’ll speak.
It’s a boring explanation.
They’ve been here before.
“Glad that’s cleared up.
And as for last week, if you feel I’m forcing your hand, please know that wasn’t my intention.
Sherlock closes his eyes, and counts to keep himself grounded.
Sherlock arches his hips up again, and then again.  They are small, shallow thrusts, but John has his full weight bearing down on him, and he’s already buried deep, it’s enough.  It’s enough to stoke the flames of his pleasure afresh, almost to the breaking point.
He sees another scarf, a dark purple, made of some rayon blend that has the weight of wool, but the feel of silk.
“Well yeah, but that doesn’t mean that…”
A little miracle of evolution.
It was clearly a bad idea coming to the Met, but then they had to come eventually, didn’t they?
It’s becoming quite painful really, and somehow even that is turning him on.
“Oh yeah.”
There is so much about this surprise that could be ill-received.
John gets to his feet, and goes to stand beside Sherlock, who presses his shoulder almost imperceptibly against John’s thighs the minute he draws close.
The epiphany lights up inside him, and ignites every cell.
Sherlock leans over and looks.
John looks relieved at that.
But that was ‘before’.
I think I would have married her anyway, Sherlock, and…”
Take care of yourself, John.
He steps forward.
And this is Sherlock doing what he always does.
Well, not the same ring, obviously, but if you can bring yourself to accept platinum over plastic…”
Another note to add to the perfume he has brewing in that special room in his mind.
John is close on his heels.
Right.”
He swallows again.
Has been for months.
He sighs.
“I’ll always wait for you.”
He shakes his head.
He takes a step forward, his tongue sliding out to press against his bottom lip, as he lifts a finger to the front of Sherlock’s shirt, and presses it against a single button, slides it down to the next.
He knows from experience that indulging it will not solve the problem.
“Maybe…
“What things.”
"When he took the first hostage, one of the clues he left me was a pair of trainers.
Sherlock inches his fingers beneath the hem of John’s t-shirt, presses them to the soft, warm flesh either side of the base of his spine, strokes there with his thumb.
“You know why.”
One or two sessions, and it will be out of his system.
“It wasn’t everyone else.
And he can feel all the anxiety rising up to suffocate him once again.
It’s army issue, looks like the one John has back at his flat.
“Yeah.  Later.”
“My brother came here today, after you left to get your things.”
“You can stay.”
“No you can’t!”
Sentiment.
Okay.
There’s also a superficial bullet wound to your right arm.
“Now!”
John cocks a brow.
Sherlock’s hand slides down John’s spine and stops just short of his arse.
He does, takes a good bit between his fingers and pulls hard.
“Then you have to tell me, John.
“Yeah?”
“Yeah, okay.”
And Sherlock hopes he understands, hopes he can see the sincerity, the commitment to building something new, something better than they had had before Sherlock had died, and John had grieved, and the world had fallen apart around them.
Can we start there, maybe?”
He still isn’t entirely sure why he’s here.
“Alright, then…”
Sherlock shuts the door to the wood stove, and weaves on his feet a little.
“Because I find you exceptional?”
What would it feel like skin-on-skin?
Sherlock’s arm tightens around his waist.
“Might go back to bed upstairs for awhile,” John finally offers.
John sniffs and cuts into his chicken cordon bleu.
When John wakes the next morning it’s to Sherlock’s sea glass eyes gazing at him from beneath sleep-heavy lids, a soft smile on his face.
John sighs.
Sherlock gasps, feels his nipples peak, and his hair follicles tingle, and his balls draw up tight, and then…
“The love took a few weeks at least.”
That’s good.
He wonders if John has forgotten she’s there.
“Well, that would rather defeat the purpose wouldn’t it?”
“She’s right, John.
“I admired her for that.  Later, when you had stopped talking to me, I sought her out for insight.  She grew up with you, I assumed that meant she may have knowledge I did not.  She was sympathetic, but couldn’t offer many solutions.  She saw the Culverton Smith case on the news.  She came to the hospital to see me.  We have only texted occasionally, since.  We are acquaintances, possibly friends, that’s all, John.
He chuckles, and then turns back to Sherlock, rolls on his side and slings an arm around his waist.
“Well, it is.”
Sherlock’s mouth clamps shut.
The god damned, bloody tease, but didn’t John ask for it, and isn’t he, on some level, in some weird way even he doesn’t understand, loving it, even now.
“You like that?”
“Friends dangerous?
Sherlock tries to school his features into his most innocent of looks, but the sheepishness is woefully transparent.
You know this isn’t just some holiday.”
And he just leaves it hanging, because what do you say to that.
John lets his arm slide away from his eyes to rest on the pillow behind his head.  He looks scared, Sherlock thinks. But if there is one thing he knows about John it’s that he’s brave as well, and if he wants this, really wants it, then…
He does.
“Missed this.
Sherlock sighs, and unfurls.
He hates himself so much he feels ill.
Still, it’s impressive.
“But not with a man you plan to have sex with.”
But silly as it seems, the surgery job is a difficult thing for John to give up.
He wishes, for the briefest of moments, that John wasn’t so fastidious.
Sherlock shouts and then moans, and moans, and pants, and whines.
He’s struggled with all that from the start, and it’s hard not to feel inadequate.
Sherlock’s whole countenance brightens.
A spot where we used to shelter cattle, but their location and general layout would be familiar to James.”
“You don’t have to do this.”
I don’t think...
“Gorgeous even.”
“Now is not a good time.”
I think I’m gonna…
Right.
I guess.
“You sound better.
You mastered it’s basics years ago, and now you can perfect it.
“He’s…”
Like that.”
“We?”
“John…”
Done.
(See the end of the chapter for
He rolls onto his side, and pulls a pillow against his chest, thinks about how it’s a pity his flat is clean, how he would do anything for a hit at the moment, tries not to think of how much John would disapprove and fails.
“I’ve done it to you too.”
Sherlock looks down at Watson sucking on her cherry lolly, eyes drooping with exhaustion, and then looks up at Greg, willing him to understand:
“John is still ill from his concussion.
Professional cuddling.
He’s giving him the look that means he wishes John would just quit the surgery altogether—an all too familiar look, of late.
John shakes his head.
“John…
“Good?”
It seems horribly intimate, and John has to fight off a sudden wave of jealousy.
This seems to spur the boy into action.
I’m afraid there’s been a mistake.
He belonged only to John.
He turns one of Sherlock’s hands over in his, pushes his sleeve up over his wrist, strokes his thumb over the pulse point.
“Okay,
John’s head turns, he stares down at Sherlock’s fingers plucking at the knee of his own trousers.
John takes the bottle from him, and dispenses a little, reaches around and takes Sherlock’s cock in hand.
“Yeah.
That all it helps?”
“Do your thing, will you.”
“No.”
“Yeah?”
“You aren’t alright.”
He shrugs into it, moves the laundry from the washer to the dryer, and goes to check on the mattress.
Sherlock’s eyes drop to the mattress.
“It’s nice when houses have history.
“Listen you probably can’t understand this, but I—it’s not that I didn’t know, that I don’t know.
“But you won’t, will you.”
Sherlock curls into the foetal position and turns his back to John.
He shrugs.
And yeah, tit-for-tat, my experience is fairly minimal, but what’s really worrying me here is the fact that you don’t seem to want to talk about this.
He sighs, and reaches behind his head for a throw cushion, plopping it over his groin, just in case Mrs. Hudson decides to make an impromptu visit.
“I thought we might.”
Sorry.
John stares down at the number.
We don’t have to talk about.
Sherlock hums, and reaches down to remove the photo from the pile in John’s hand and place it on the arm of the chair.
“Said I don’t need your help.”
It will be quick, and as it curls tight in his centre, tighter, and tighter, drawing his balls up until it’s almost pain, he strokes in long, langrous pull, and he lets go, wholly lets it come.
He hands the tea to Sherlock, who takes it, gratefully and without argument.
John’s face does something strange, and Sherlock wonders, not for the first time on this fine, crisp November morning, just what on earth has gotten into him.
John smells Sherlock before he sees him.
I’d do that.
Find anything useful?”
Sherlock tosses the two bags at him, and John reaches out and catches them on instinct.
He doesn’t want to think about what it all could mean.
And John doesn’t waste time.
Sherlock nods.
If he waits too long, Rosie will wake up, and then everyone will be up, and their day will begin whether they like it or not.
His arms tighten around John’s waist.
Sherlock holds his hands up, unfolds his legs to kneel before him.
“Piccadilly is mad this time of day.
“You’re talking like a man in love.”
Sherlock decides to be efficient.
He scans through his text history and stops on the text he’d received from John earlier in the day saying he was running late.
“Hope so.”
“What?”
Why not last year?
“Imagine if they fell out on the floor with water and blood like the elephants on that docmentry.”
John smiles, and lifts a hand to the front of Sherlock’s shirt.
If anyone had told him the previous morning that in less than 24 hours he would be in bed with Sherlock Holmes, he would have told them they were mad.
Mycroft’s eyes drop.
After all this time, Sherlock still doesn’t know.
John pulls him closer still.
It’s not who they are, but this is…
“And everyone is happy,” she finishes.
It’s unexpectedly frank, almost filthy, somehow, and Sherlock loves it, he suddenly realises.
Still, there are things
This thing they are is a battle Sherlock has been losing from the start, and he must be exhausted and terrified.
“He can be a bit much.
Papers are signed.
“Thought it might be nice.
“Seem to remember someone in our house liking these.”
“Sherlock.”
“Well,” John grins even wider.
“Mmm?”
She thinks you’re good for me.”
“Hey.”
“It’s fine.
John rolls his eyes and smiles.
John’s eyes go red, but Sherlock sees him consider it, weigh it, accept it.
He walks a little farther away from Sherlock, but Sherlock can see the tension and alertness in his body, the way his eyes scan the aisles for anyone who might notice Sherlock and judge.
John looks surprised even as the words are coming out of his mouth.
Sometimes he doesn’t know why he doesn’t.
“Don’t.”
The gate creaks open.
Wanna feel human again.”
Who’s dead.”
John walks close, his hand occasionally brushing against Sherlock’s, making Sherlock’s fingers twitch and itch to reach out and take John’s hand in his.
“Safe.”
Not much it seems.
I’m killing you.
“Maybe.
I knew you’d be back once you noticed.”
“They should have done a better job.
“Yeah, I’m here.”
“Oh, so you’re saying I might have already figured it out.”
It’s the idea of it.
“You know I need to take it easy, though, nothing too strenuous for at least 24 hours.”
John’s eyes are full.
John isn’t coming back because he’s angry.
“Where were you?”
Sherlock wonders if maybe they should.
“No.”
I just—you’re acting very odd.”
You can’t hit me here, and you know it!”
John nods, but he doesn’t look entirely convinced.
John’s hands are everywhere.
“Not leaving all the domestic chores for me or Mrs. Hudson might be a start.”
I do believe this next method will do the trick.
Sherlock almost wonders if he’s fallen asleep, but the cadence of his breathing isn’t quite right for it.
“Alright, Dear.
But he’s reached the point of no return, the point where he’s going to become utterly monstrous if can’t have some peace and quiet.
He swallows tightly, presses his nose deeper into John’s hair.
“I need you to leave me alone.”
It was obvious by the state of his clothing, and the way he was constantly checking his phone.
Don’t lounge about too long.
“Alright.
“Yeah.
He’s embarrassed by it, really, but not enough to step away.
Can we go back to our room, now?”
John laughs a high, slightly manic sounding thing.
He moves his fingers, just the tiniest slide deeper, and then withdraws.
“Oh, you have nothing to worry about.
And yet the only thing anyone seems concerned about is reputation!”
They lie still and quiet, and Sherlock almost thinks John is asleep, when…
mistake.
The cell around him dissolves into the half dark of a slow-encroaching dawn.
This is Sherlock baring his throat.
All of it.”
Yeah.
Inconvenient.
This isn’t you.”
“Yes.”
Sherlock hums and then lets out a soft snore, and John stares down at him, and smiles.
But when it comes to…”
Nowhere does it say that both parties have to be awake.”
Sherlock is pacing fisting his hands in his hair and pulling hard.
Not lying dead—“ his voice breaks.
A muscle in John’s jaw jumps.
“Are you angry?”
“Sherlock…”
“Right.”
Sherlock looks stunned and grateful beyond words.
They’ll be alright.
He reaches over, shuts off the light, shifts a little, and pulls Sherlock closer still.
Sherlock opens his eyes again, blinks up at the sun shining through the top of John’s hair like a sterling halo, at the heavy bags beneath his eyes, and the greyish pallor to his face, and the deep blue sincerity of his eyes.
“Oh yeah?
“Trousers off.”
But Sherlock cuts him off with another kiss.
Just give me a minute.”
Okay.”
You’re not the only one with deductive skills, you know.”
John seems relaxed, and happy.
Bit of a thing related to a case.
“Okay.
“You.
John jerks his chin toward his shoulder.
Very generous of you.”
“Will you be?”
John grins briefly, and then looks down and blows on his coffee, before taking a tentative sip.
Why me?
Sherlock hears him suck in a sharp breath.
But for tonight, yes, of course you can stay.”
It shouldn’t be.
Did we come all the way out here just for a morning stroll?”
“Alright fine, I’ll help, but really John it’s quite easy to…”
His hands are resting lightly on John’s shoulders (which is most certainly not where they should be, is it?), and they are trembling.
“He owed me a favour.
Sherlock sits up, swings a leg over, and settles on top of him, all in one smooth motion.
“As you are to me.”
“You want my finger in there, or…?”
“Can I keep kissing you?”
I missed living with you.
She waits in silence.
“In a way.”
You’re safe.
His cheeks are flushed even while the rest of him is pale as a ghost.
John’s thumb glides over the top of Sherlock’s knuckles in a soothing gesture.
He watches it sink in.
Sherlock realises his hand is resting on John’s knee.
She has bigger things to worry about at the moment.”
He doesn’t even want to think about what Ella will have to say.
Let’s.”
John blinks, and the tears that had been gathering in his eyes spill over.
Appropriate.
“Mmm?”
I’ve had time enough, more than enough, so…
John watches Margaret wrap an arm around Mrs. Hudson’s waist, and then turns his attention back to Rosie.
He winks, his fingers seeking out the placket of John’s shirt.
But if you would prefer I not…”
Just—don’t look.”
Sherlock blinks, a small wrinkle starting to form between his brows.
“Yeah.
“Oh yeah?”
John reaches down and drags the blunt of his nails over Sherlock’s ribs.
If Moriarty hadn’t…”
“How do you feel about it being something other than professional?”
“I would think you would be a little more concerned about this case.
“Of course,” Sherlock snaps.
He hovers for a moment, arms trembling, and then lowers himself slowly down.
It could hardly be considered your fault.”
The first stair squeaks (still; just as it always has).
Sherlock informs her.
You’re doing everything right.
Sherlock grins.
Sherlock’s eyes shift, drag up the length of his body, and return to the task he’s doing a very poor job of pantomiming.
Somewhere in the back of his head Sherlock knows this is John stalling, not wanting to give up control just yet (not ready).
“The surrender.”
There is one particularly large shard of a teacup embedded in John’s right knee.
Like you did for me.
But I’m—I’m not allowed to want you, it seems.”
Are you at work yet?
We’re allowed to need each other.
He fumbles about in his bedside drawer for lube.
Mrs. Hudson and Molly are saying our good-byes.
“Lift your hips for me.”
John just stares.
I have wanted—I do.”
“As I’ve said—anything.”
He has the cab change routes on the spot, but is still unacceptably late, which means that the nursery has called John, who no doubt had his phone turned off because he was in therapy, and when they get no answer there, are obliged to stay late.
Sherlock cocks a brow.
What do you mean?
The dreams have been bad lately, remember.
You’re going to be okay.
“Yes, you would.”
He’s gotten himself worked into a proper state, then.
“Umm, not sure what there is to tell.
Just…”
Sherlock must hear it too, because he cocks a brow, the corner of his mouth twitches, as he continues to loose his buttons, painfully slow.
“Sherlock, you are not some trained monkey.
John’s face does something Sherlock can’t interpret, and then he is opening the cab door, ducking inside, and Sherlock’s heart plummets.
“I may, however, stop talking.”
“Do you only take female clients, or are there male clients as well?”
“We’re compatible, aren’t we?”
John huffs the way he always does when Sherlock says this.
Indulged?
“Possibly.
“Yes.”
Just an email and mobile number.”
Sherlock murmurs.
He really was hungry, and it tastes wonderful.
Now tie me.”
“Homely.”
Yeah.
“I can’t!”
John reaches out to hold onto his hips, brushes his thumbs over his hip bones with each rolling motion.
He frowns, but steps closer.
A warm hand closes over the one John has resting on the bed.
“Come here,” he murmurs.
He fumbles blearily for it, and waits a second for his tired eyes to adjust.
“I invited you over.”
Sherlock is about to grab their bags and go, but John yanks him back into the warm backseat of the cab, as he turns to the cabbie.
He feels useless.
“Sorry…
“Right.
“Yes!”
“It means it was more than good,” Sherlock reassures him.  “It means I have never previously had an experience quite like it, and I would very much like to see if I might have another again, sometime very soon.”
Somewhere in the back of his head (back of his heart) he knows that he needs to be the one to initiate, that Sherlock won’t force the issue now, no matter how much John reassures him that it was fine, that it was wanted.
“I missed you.
Wilkes has the sort of limp, clammy shake John expected, and he has to fight not to recoil.
It doesn’t go as he expects.
Sherlock just wraps himself more tightly in the blanket draped over his shoulders, and stares into the flames.
Things have been different this last year, since he came back to Baker Street, since he came home.
He breathes deep, and feels his whole body relax.
He’s being irrational, and he knows it, but he feels blindsided by the whole bloody thing, the house, and Sherlock being Sherlock, and fucking Janine, and he’s thrown off kilter, angry as hell, and…
Why build up this Network?
Tell me.
But don’t experiment on me.”
I’ve been on the receiving end.”
Sherlock’s eyes comb the room.
We were never intimate, John.”
Why?”
He whips it out, and takes a few steps forward holding it out to John.
She grins crookedly.
But if I tell you to go off somewhere so I can get you something, you’d better do it.”
John glances back toward the lounge again.
I’m not used to anyone caring if I live or die.
It takes John a minute to catch up.
You agreed to move back.
Sherlock inclines his head briefly downward.
They lie in silence for some time.  When John finally sighs, and Sherlock speaks.  “Would you let me…” He thinks for a moment. “Would you let me decide, John.  Could you trust me to do that? With the option of stopping whenever you wish, of course.”
Only—the truth of what happened that day.
He gets to his feet.
What?
“I have to tell you something.”
John’s lips press against his, warm, and dry, and almost chaste.
John huffs, the corner of his mouth curling up.
Always vigilant, always watching.
“Thank you.”
John is in his chair, sitting there, waiting.
I’m his…”
His brother sounds amused, a little incredulous, but Sherlock thinks he can hear the fear behind it.
Huhhh…
“Not yet.”
I… Jesus.”
Sherlock assumes he’s referring to the bubbles.
You need to know.
They had parted ways, John to the loo for a shower, and Sherlock to the bedroom to prepare for bed.
I dreamed of your shepherd’s pie.
He looks up, and it’s hard to tell in the dark, but his eyes look wet.
Sherlock’s eyes flit up to John.
Sherlock waits for an explanation, but John doesn’t offer one.
“I just mean, I think what you’re feeling will pass.
John’s eyes drift up and to the side.
Why, he doesn’t know.
John’s head snaps up, and Sherlock smiles softly.
Why not you too?”
This kiss is different, more heated, and though it sometimes takes them a little time to warm up, that is not the case this morning, it seems.
John almost looks apologetic.
“I know.”
“You were bored, restless.
Told the whole world about it in one of your blogs, as I recall.”
It doesn’t take them long to reach the twin villages of Friston and East Dean, And John turns left off of the the A259 at a small, country church, and onto a gravel lane.
It’s the juxtaposition of softness set over steel that Sherlock finds so pleasing.
“Liked that did you?”
He steps forward and slides his jacket over his shoulders, laying it on the end of the bed, before starting to unbutton his waistcoat.
“Good-heavens, Holmes.
“We don’t talk about anything.”
In the beginning he was more careful.
“Just do it.
The tears in her eyes spill over, and she wipes them away angrily.
“Sherlock.”
John’s eyes fill.
He holds up the disk for Sherlock to see.
“Now is perfect.”
“What do you see?”
“Dear Jim. Please will you fix it for me to get rid of my lover’s nasty sister?
Sherlock shakes his head at the great mystery that is John.
John sounds near tears, but there is something in his tone that makes Sherlock think it’s safe to proceed, and he hopes he knows John well enough by now to be right, because being wrong could be disastrous.
Don’t you see?!”
That it was essential you reach them, that if you didn’t it could all end very, very badly.”
“Oh, get out!”
It’s grounding.
John says, casually, nodding toward the man’s neck.
Let’s begin then, shall we.”
When he finally pulls away, John is hard all over again.
“Bored.”
John’s face softens.
“The night we…”
“It’s her, isn’t it.”
“You’re mad.”
John stays perfectly still, but trembles, and trembles, and grows impossibly harder against him, and Sherlock aches at how much he wants, how much they both want, and yet…
Sherlock pulls off and rolls out of bed.
“I started it.”
“Come here.”
He should…
“And just what is it that you do, Miss Adler, mmm?
We’re safe.
Didn’t bring my bag.
feel wrung out, and sated, and properly fucked.
Are you hurt?”
He’s always been.
“Oh god.  I—Sherlock, I need…”
“Think I might sleep, if that’s okay.”
Maybe I would have been the one putting the breaks on.
Mycroft takes a deep breath, lets it out slowly.
It’s a world all its own, a world of Sherlock’s making, and John wonders how long Sherlock will leave him teetering here, and why he wants it, why it feels so fucking good he could cry (
“No time left today.
He makes himself small in a home, makes himself fit easily, makes a half-hearted effort at insisting on cleanliness, but beyond that, doesn’t bring any of himself to a space.
Not even—fooling around?”
“I’m sorry.”
“No, I’m fine.”
Sherlock just stares, but John continues on anyway.
“Why?”
I’m sorry.”
He forgot to book a room.
“Noth—nothing helps.”
“You expecting something in the mail?”
I promise.
It had been strange, and a little terrifying at first.
“Still?”
To Sherlock’s surprise, he turns and addresses him.
Near Brighton.
It’s just a birthday like any other, and by that age, usually one you would rather forget.
I told him he was being a bore.
He’d never been the same after that.
He smiles, and hums, and even praises Sherlock once, or twice over an old deduction or a miraculously solved case, which is so unexpected that Sherlock finds himself blushing like an infatuated school girl and has to look away yet again.
“Under the covers.”
“John, I…”
We—we’ve been—intimate, in a way.
Ella smiles at him mildly, as always.
She’s a piece of you, and she—she’s quite remarkable in her own right.
Growth spurt?”
Though, If you can manage to behave yourself, there’s a rather substantial reward in it, so I hear.”
“You didn’t bring a single warm thing.
Some of the anger seems to be fading now, but John’s hands are still shaking, almost as much as Sherlock’s.
Not now, Rosie!”
It’s still snowing.
He takes a deep breath and lets it out.
“John, will you forgive me for all the hurt I’ve caused you?”
As I’ve said, I would very much like to keep doing what we’ve been doing.
John just nods, and then sits down, and pats the space beside him.
He hears John’s swallow.
John stands a little straighter.
At least I did before…”
Sherlock had clucked like a mother hen over the sad state of the beehives, and John had laughed, and said that he could get some of his own for the roof of 221b if he was so keen.
the way they should.”
And when he gets no response:
It’s a revelation, this: John’s desire for him, to be so wanted.
Sherlock tucks his knees up and hugs them to his chest.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything, but John feels the tension drain from his body.
“Is that so?”
I’ve thought of at least three potential solutions already.”
I know those nights.
Did you know that?
“Well, you would know.”
“Oh.”
John feels a momentary twinge of fondness, a fondness he’s been allowing himself to indulge in more and more, of late.
You have no idea.
“John…
Said it’s good I can be myself around you.”
Christ.
“So, I decided I’d prepared enough.”
Sherlock whimpers.
“She got the Watson temper, then?”
“Good.
Please don’t…”
Beautiful.
Not worse, just—different.
“Excellent.
“Harry, Clive, this is Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson.
John looks up.
Sherlock can feel it through the mattress.
“Sure?”
He winks and John smiles.
Every day a new mystery to solve.
Something subtle shifts behind John’s eyes.  He sits a little straighter. “No.”
“I think I could spend a lifetime plumbing your depths, and never come close to unravelling your mysteries.
John winks as he moves into the kitchen to get a drink of water.
“Yeah.  We can figure things out as we go.”
