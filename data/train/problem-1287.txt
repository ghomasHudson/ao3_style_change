John's eyelids snapped upwards, his eyes hazed and – mm, yes, frustrated. Certainly this was one of the occasions that Sherlock was pleased to be proved eternally right.
John opened his mouth to speak, but William got there first. "No," he said, baritone voice offhanded as he turned away from them both and picked up a single bottle of red wine from the table. "He's all yours."
Moment? What moment? "Y'know, I still have no idea what you're talking about. You chastise me for being vague and you're not even communicating to me what is
Grasping the wrist tightly between his fingers and dragging it further over his shoulder, Sherlock felt a fierce rush of exhilaration surge through the tension as John's body was pulled against his own, the sound of a sharp intake of breath crawling into the whorl of his ears and the feel of potential energy being pushed aside making him want to hiss with the sensation of every moment. "This." His long fingers spread out over the area of skin they had commandeered, feeling new skin and new heat. He watched with ferocious attention to detail as John's lips separated and his eyes widened, oh, he was so addicted to all of it, every second. "Push aside your wretched ignorance for one moment, John, and acknowledge your symptoms. Accelerated pulse." This time it was his index and middle finger that brushed over the skin of John's wrist, his thumb staying put on the rapid pulsing of blood through veins. "Heightened body temperature." He shifted even closer to John, his own breathing starting to flow out in staggered gusts, betraying his own enjoyment. Resolve was a thing of the past. "Dilated pupils." His stare was as intent as ever, willing the truth of it to be transferred over the pitiful distance. "This, John,
Sherlock let out the mother of all sighs from between pursed lips. “Don’t be pedantic, John. My point is that no matter what came from the situation I am well aware that most likely you found
"So..." John picked up the bandage again, not really focusing as he started to wrap it over his hand once again. "You... no. Right. I'm confused. And tired. But mostly confused. We were talking and he was getting carried away. Nothing compromising about it. So what exactly did
John's cheeks flushed. Christ. This was just... it made no sense. "Believe me, Sherlock, nothing about that situation was enjoyable. I can't see what could possibly be enjoyable about you going off on a power trip and taking advantage of me when I'm -"
John still did not look at him as his fingers slowly pried the lid from the top of the dark bottle. He left it a few moments before responding, smile gone but tone still casual. "Call it what you want, it's still going to taste better than anything you've ever eaten."
"Nah," Lewis said with a wave of his hand, shrugging it off as if it meant nothing. "The wife looks after me, you know. She's a good girl."
Sherlock let a moment of hesitation stretch out between them. "I... what are you scared of, exactly?"
The two of them stared at each other for a few moments before she raised her eyebrow, looking at him as if he'd quite lost his mind.
"Sherlock!" Greg held the card up so that it faced the unimpressed-looking genius. "You're new to this: take a drink!"
Greg walked slowly into the room, raising his hands to gesture above him. His eyes were questioning, not so much as curious as just completely and utterly bemused – and John was right with him. The last few minutes had seemed to fly by in a mess of confusion, drama and tension and John was so far beyond comprehension that he felt a very huge urge to storm up those stairs, crash through Sherlock's bedroom door and demand an explanation.
"Oh, have I said something amusing? Does it, I don't know, does it make you laugh to think that I spent the last two hours trying to come up with reasons why you bothered to take care of the cut on my hand? Or why you agreed to bring me back here?" Sherlock's eyes flickered back up to John's face for a moment before darting back down to his left hand; he had to stop clenching it, now. He was going to do himself more damage. "I know, it's
John's eyebrow shot up of its own accord, his feet kicking at the sand lightly as he walked. "I never thought I'd hear those words out of your mouth – 'I wasn't going to argue'. Speaking as someone who has experience of how much you
John nodded, though he was slightly distracted by the tiny amount of warmth currently emitting from the boy whose hand was now next to his leg as he shifted to get a better view at the country road. "Yeah, I'm... I'm up for an adventure."
The silence that met Sherlock’s words was altogether different from the silences of before; it was no longer full of sentences that neither of them were willing to say, no longer empty and stale. The silence that filled the room as the two brothers stared across the fire at one another was a twisted mixture of truth, of understanding and, most prominent of all, pity. For the first time in his life Sherlock Holmes understood what people often described about the aftermath of speaking something achingly true: a pressure had lifted from his shoulders at the mere vocalisation of it. Equally true was the fact that before he had said the words he hadn’t even been sure of it himself. But he had said it now, and as he had often quoted to himself in the dark of his bedroom, ‘when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth’ – and this was the truth. It was improbable. It was utterly, undeniably improbable. But it was not impossible.
Wanda took him for his word. They'd filled about half an hour with mindless chitchat, Tim telling him random bits of information about the area, commenting on the houses they passed and somehow being able to spout every name and add a little factoid about each person as he reeled them off; Wanda rolled her eyes every few minutes and shook her head at John, though he never once took it to mean that she was actually bothered by it. The truth was that he was sort of fixated on their relationship, unable to stop a small grin spreading on his face as they verbally sparred in the sweetest, gentlest way he'd ever experienced and somehow feeling, not that he was outside of their sphere, but that he was somehow involved in their little jokes. It was refreshing. He was undeniably glad that he'd come with them.
“Sherlock.” Mycroft’s voice was uncharacteristically gentle, eyes less judgemental than they had been before. “You are falling apart.”
John swallowed hard, his mouth suddenly dry and palms beginning to sweat. He tried to match Sherlock's volume. "If the person you saw is
"Okay, no problem, we can meet there." Mike's smile faded somewhat, eyes carefully taking in John's pale face. "You don't have to come, y'know. You look exhausted."
John's hands slowed on the bandage and eventually came to a stop; he forced himself to think about what Greg was saying, feeling the exhaustion starting to creep into his body and making him feel very much like he wanted to tell Greg to bugger off and leave him alone – but then again, maybe it wasn't exhaustion at all. His eyes raised to meet Greg's honest gaze, trying to understand. Because maybe exhaustion was cloaking something else.
The fact that he'd tried, on more than a few occasions, to envision a future where John's existence within Sherlock's life led to a good outcome spoke volumes for how worrisome the whole situation could become.
John could not wrap his head around it for love nor money. "We were just talking, Greg. Sherlock was getting carried away with this big power trip after I said some thing I shouldn't have and he was the one who -"
“Hmmwhassat?” Sherlock’s voice mumbled sleepily through the darkness, still clearly at least half-unconscious; John looked at him for one moment more before he quietly made his way over to his bedroom door, sliding back the lock and pulling it open, the light from the hallway spilling in painfully bright – he squinted out at the two currently indiscernible shapes and forced his eyes to adjust.
John's mouth dropped open, eyes widening as he absorbed William's words. Wasn't this the man who had encouraged him to come, to relax and have a good time with his friends? "I'm sorry, have I done something to offend you or angered you in some way? Because four hours ago you were telling me to come and have fun and now you're berating me for doing just that."
As soon as John said it he wished that he could take it back, knowing as he did far too late what would happen; almost as if reacting to the constant use of the word the energy around them shifted and sharpened, a contradictory mass of intensity both binding them and separating them in continuous, undulating waves. John had to take a few moments to recover before he could force his hand down mechanically to the plate in front of him, scooping up what essentially was just creamy sauce and putting the paltry mouthful between his lips, chewing despite not needing to, anything to distract himself. Sherlock had resumed his gaze upon John, a mild flicker of interest sparking behind his eyes as he watched the older man's pointless pretence to eat.
, Sherlock. Not some other man. Not any man. I didn't kiss you because you're a guy, I kissed you because you're... you."
John and Greg shared a look, battling for the right to respond appropriately: they stared it out stubbornly until John eventually gave in, shaking his head. Let Greg be the bad guy.
He recognised the silhouette behind the frosted glass before he'd even unlocked and yanked open the door.
With a questioning smile and a gentle shrug, John picked up the bottle of wine and held it out to his friend. "The wine?"
This was impossible. Harriet was impossible. "No, I'm not taking drugs. Look, if you're really too busy to talk to me I'll go."
Mycroft seemed full of pregnant pauses this evening. "Might I ask... what is it that keeps you here?"
Sherlock's long fingers picked at a loose thread on the arm of his chair. "I'm relatively certain that would be considered unprofessional."
Sherlock lifted his fingers to his lips, his teeth finding the edge of a nail and starting to wear away at it; it was a habit he had not indulged in years. “What about me?”
The thumb shifted lightly against his wrist again – it was still there, John hadn't realised – but it was clear to the both of them that this wasn't an intentional move, rather an instinctual one; the tension predictably rocketed, John's face flooding with heat again and his insides doing an odd tremble as Sherlock's hand tensed against John's skin – he could almost hear the silent, racing war in Sherlock's head as he tried to ascertain the situation and deal with it accordingly, difficult when even John had no idea what was going on and what to do.
take care of him if this is where he wants to be, I’m more than capable. I’m not going to force him to leave just because you want him to, even if it
John couldn't help but give a short bark of laughter – god, poor Greg. Living with one Holmes brother and being under the thumb of the other probably wasn't the most pleasant experience… but, still, he lived here for free. There had to be
Sherlock had already taken off his shoes and left them by the door, throwing his keys onto the kitchen counter and shrugging with all the nonchalance of his father's natural state of being. "Absolutely nothing, John. You've done nothing at all."
Sherlock's gaze burned, silent as he let the words settle between them. "You don't need to say that."
As Mycroft and John drifted away from a rather heated discussion about gas versus electric, Mycroft did not even attempt to beat around the bush.
… is okay… is beyond me. After last time. After Barts." And he finds himself looking up again, meeting a gaze that is certainly the rawest thing that John Watson has ever seen in his life and is so agonising to witness that John can hardly believe either of them are still standing. "Can you please, just for a moment – one moment, Sherlock, you can give me that much – imagine if I had found this out…
"I can see that," Sherlock noted with a smirk. "The receptionist is practically chomping at the bit. Kept going on about how she asked you to get here five minutes early."
John realised too late that he had been scrunching his face up in confusion. "William..." He shut his eyes for a moment. "Sorry. Sherlock." He glanced up at him, a small nod offered his way in return. "I'm still your friend, I just need to remember that you're... you're..."
Greg stared at him, seeming a little irritated himself. "I just told you! That he's falling in love with you! That Sherlock, our Sherlock – well, no,
“So.” John rubbed his palms over his jeans, surprised to find his hands were clammy. “You want me to go alone.”
His body tensed at the curse from behind him, reacting instinctively as he turned to see what had inspired a rare swearword from the genius who had once mocked John for how idiotic he had sounded when overusing them; his eyes found Sherlock and the problem instantly, a hand cradled to the taller man's chest as the fingers below it rose to catch the droplets of blood that started to trickle over his skin, the offending knife cast aside with a small stretch of crimson arching its edge.
"So." John pulled the duvet cover across the bed and looked pointedly at the door. "Goodnight, then."
It was bloody confusing. How did girls know this sort of stuff? "Well from what you've said the two don't have to be inclusive of one another. You don't have to ever fall in love with someone to love them, right?"
A gentle prod to his shoulder jerked him back to the room, his head whipping around to face a very smug looking Wanda.
Ah. Still defensive. “You've already considered this, I assume. Is that why you're being the way that you are?”
"Right, that's what I was talking about." It was so easy to become distracted with Sherlock; it was one of the reasons John liked him so bloody much. "If we do try, it's going to be difficult. Obviously Greg and Mycroft are on our side, and suffice it to say that your
Actually, no. I don't apologise. I have enough to be dealing with, which you CLEARLY know already, and apologising to people like you who live to inflict misery on people who already have far more than their fair share to be getting on with is just not that high on my list of things to do.
John was momentarily overwhelmed. "Mm, yes… oh, yes, me too. Absolutely. It sounds wonderful, Mrs. Holmes, thank you -"
." She gave him a forced smile, supposedly to make him feel at ease. "But talking to me now is imperative in order to -"
Instantly John grabbed the laptop, pulling it up to his face and staring at the screen – sure enough the conversation window was up, a microphone icon flashing in the top right-hand corner.
Sherlock's responding grin was just as smug. "So technically she would still be younger or older than you are."
, John told himself heatedly, undoing all of the good work he'd done whilst Sherlock was gone, thinking of the things he'd determinedly ignored in the hours of Sherlock's disappearance,
She didn't like that, didn't like having her words thrown back at her; her lips pursed unattractively, leaning back on her chair and clearly starting an attempt to analyse him. "Do you often find yourself acting defensively when faced with an uncomfortable situation?"
A silence fell over them as the smaller of the two set to work on preparing dinner, darting between one side of the small space to an array of vegetables and back over to the beef; Sherlock watched intently as John put a frying pan and oil onto heat, his small hands throwing in the deep red chunks of beef, creating a comforting sizzling noise the moment the meat hit the hot metal; the older man started to hum as he poked and prodded the beef with a wooden spatula, an unfamiliar tune which threaded its way through the kitchen and made the whole experience of standing in the kitchen whilst John cooked for him infinitely comforting.
At this, all eyes swivelled around to rest upon Mrs. Watson, who was now visibly shaken and clearly out of her comfort zone. As if she hadn't been already, with her alcoholic husband, lesbian daughter and her now self-confessed depressive son surrounding her. It hit John, then, that although he
"Calm down, he's getting a glass just as big as yours." As if to prove it, Greg slammed a glass full of something clear in front of John. "Sambuca and lemonade. Enjoy."
Ah yes, the elusive ‘everything’, the unnamed period of time in which they weren’t speaking… but the reference to it was somewhat surprising. Was Sherlock still feeling guilt over everything that had happened before now? It would certainly seem that way, if he was bringing it up in relation to emotional turmoil – John was unsure how to approach it, knowing as he did that Sherlock preferred not to speak of it and not wanting really to bring up the specifics himself, but would it really be fair to leave his best friend to mull around in guilt for the entirety of their knowing each other? As far as John was concerned that was far behind them now, unimportant in the face of what had been born from it.
John rubbed his hands down his face, realising too late that his palm felt as if it were on fire and that it was, in fact, bleeding – just as Sherlock had said. He sighed and untucked the material from its place, starting to unwind it. "I've just spent an evening musing over the words and actions of a man who is possibly
John’s hands reaching forward, hesitating for just a moment before resting upon the solid plane of Sherlock’s chest.
He glanced up with a frown, unsure he'd heard correctly. "You're asking me what my favourite colour is?"
"Don't worry, I'll be there in fifteen minutes – I'm sure we'll get a chance to argue it out then." John leaned over and grabbed his keys from his desk, slamming his hand on the door handle and pulling it open. "Feel free to bugger off before I get there."
Joanne walked around the desk, slow and calm as she spread her fingers out wide in front of her as if in some sort of attempt to keep him from bolting from the office as he so clearly wanted to do. “That's good. I'm glad you want to do that. But I think we're both overlooking something here, and I really think that if you -”
Greg broke the silence again. "Right. I was just..." he pointed towards the kitchen with a finger, eyes still not knowing which man to look at, "...going to get a glass of water. Heard voices."
"No. No, not that." God, they were a terrible combination of awkwardness and inability to communicate. "You, William... were the
Oh, the man was bloody ignorant to his own talent, so bloody ignorant. "Okay, remember what we talked about the last time we were at Alessandro's? About the whole... intensity thing?"
"Sherlock?" He could hear the distaste in her voice and, just as when Lauren had called him a weirdo, he felt the same lick of fiery protectiveness shoot up his spine. "What sort of name is Sherlock?"
“Sherlock.” Mycroft pulled his front door open fully, eyes narrowing as he took in the tense teenager standing in front of him, eyes avoiding his. “What a… pleasant surprise.”
"Oh, well, you haven't had sex then. Is he a virgin?" Harry was still happily babbling away, clearly intent on fulfilling her threat. "Gotta take it slow and steady if he is. Has he ever come before? He has to at least have masturbated, I've never met a man before who hasn't -"
A surprised chuckle, quickly replaced with a frown. "That's an image I didn't need to see before bed."
Greg raised John's empty glass, eyes sparkling. "Brilliant! Awesome! Always wanted a third housemate, kind of like a buffer – just hoped it would be a woman, but..."
Mycroft followed his father's gaze out to the conservatory. "As much as it pains me to miss a family outing, I really must do some work today. Heaven knows how they usually manage to function without me, but regardless, needs must."
So. Sentiment was coming. He forces himself not to turn and face it head on. The adrenaline may think it knew best, but he was slowly learning to trust other instincts. Like the one that told him he wasn’t quite ready to face John.
"Oh, get on with you," blustered Mrs. Holmes, nudging him with her elbow as she passed. "And don't lose his suitcase! He's a forgetful sort, my Tim," she said quietly to John as she continued to practically drag him towards the front door, "so he needs reminding every now and then not to accidentally misplace things. After all, what would you do without your suitcase?"
"Yes," Brooke replied, her voice carrying clearly across the hustle and bustle and reaching John without having to raise her voice even slightly. "Wanda and I go rather a way back."
Sighing, Sherlock leaned back on the front of the chair and stretched his long legs out in front of him, crossing them at the ankle. "Thank you. Was that so difficult?"
He sighed again, his fingers idly tracing over Sherlock's slender hand. "I don't know. I was kind of planning on going straight back to uni as soon as I'm finished here, but as I don't have a place to live yet that might be a bit impossible. So, probably, yeah."
"Heh," the man barked out a laugh, "yeah, I know. Cheers." He took the envelope within a dirty, meaty hand and shoved it unceremoniously in a pocket. "And here's yours."
were completely dependant on John either. They'd both survive the fall if their friendship didn't last through this emotional insanity.
"Yes, true," John mused, nodding. "But I vaguely recall a moment where you were suddenly grabbing my hips -"
"Please don't touch me," Sherlock warned quietly, still not looking at him, avoiding his eyes with every intent to never look into them again. "It would be of great detriment to my respect for you."
change it, even if it were possible. I love women, love everything about them and I wouldn't take that away from myself even if my life depended on it. It's not a choice, but even if it were, I'd still make it.” Her voice had taken on a quality John had only heard a small number of times before, mostly at times when she had been discussing his feelings for Sherlock with him –
"No," Sherlock agreed quietly, leaning against the door frame and staring at the dark shape in front of him, "I'm sure it doesn't."
“As it turns out, brother dear, I…” He laughed, an utterly fractured noise which had no place in the room whatsoever, “…I am just as weak. I am just as foolish. I have allowed myself the frustration and oddity of a relationship and it was not my choice, I did not openly make this decision to invite -” he spat the word, the sound of it shaping almost visibly in the air, “ –
He turned on his heel – no need to say anything to Neil, he didn't owe him that, nor much else – and marched into the hallway, taking the stairs two at a time and throwing his door open. He strode resolutely over to his almost completely untouched travelling bag, sitting exactly where he had left it at the foot of his bed, grabbing the few pieces of clothing folded neatly over his desk chair, throwing them unceremoniously amidst the rest of his clean clothes and took one last journey over to his rumpled bed to pluck his mobile phone from its place on his pillow.
The two of them shared a gaze: Sherlock, defensive; Mycroft, amused. “And do you not think, perhaps, that it would actually be beneficial to actually put your own emotional well-being first?”
John's stomach twisted to the point where he genuinely began to wonder if he would be sick, acid rising to his throat tasting like wine and intense discomfort – he began to reach out for his friends arm, an odd gesture considering his usual disregard for any form of physical comfort or affection, but Sherlock jerked away as if being threatened by a live wire. "Sherlock -"
His vision was hazy but he could see perfectly well enough to note how the tall genius was kneeling beside him, head bent to watch his own hands moving over the bandage he was wrapping around John's injured hand; he looked very focused, utterly determined. His face was impassive but there was something behind the look that John hadn't really seen before – or had he? In the restaurant, the flash in Sherlock's eyes after John had joked about Jim and speed-dating. It was like that. Fierce. Yes, fierce, but not just that. His mind fought against the fog and tried to find the right word but it was hiding just out of range so that he could not quite reach out and pull it down to rest on his tongue, which was frustrating when he was genuinely certain that it was an important thought to process -
John grinned again, barely even conscious of his sudden lift in mood. "Oh please, by all means compliment me."
By the time he had turned eleven and started at secondary school he was already taking it upon himself to use the exact same mechanism to keep her from derailing. Where his friends would go to after-school activities – as well as Harry keeping herself out of the house as much as possible – John would rush home to tell his mother all about his day, helping her cook dinner and do housework and coming up with all sorts of questions and stories in order to give her the opportunity to take a break from the whirlwind of thoughts which most likely plagued her through the day. He would walk through the off-white front door and offer her the most sincere smile he possibly could, trying to ignore the puffiness of her eyes as he offered her a brief kiss on the cheek and hung his coat on the wooden hooks within the porch, already regaling her with details of every class he had participated in and the various shenanigans his friends had got up to that day. She would smile in response, nodding and making all of the right noises, the two of them working in tandem to ensure that neither of them had to see the half-empty bottle of gin sitting by his father's arm-chair and the pile of brown envelopes stacked on the microwave from monder-lenders demanding repayment.
John paused in his investigation, face turning slightly towards the tense boy on the bed. He waited a few moments, awkward silence lingering between them for longer than was necessary. "Sorry. I didn't mean it to come out quite as… well. I didn't mean it the way it sounded."
Greg grinned, but this time it was smaller, kinder. He extended his hand out to John. "Good luck, all right? And, y'know... I'm your mate too. If you need to chat, text me. Or call me. Whatever."
No, his eyelids were too heavy. He felt as if he should apologise. The voice sounded very concerned.
Triumph flitted across Sherlock's face. "Ah, how right you are. Well, I'll just head back up -" He turned to leave but John had already anticipated his move, reaching out and grabbing Sherlock by the arm.
Mycroft cleared his throat, nodding and cracking open the front door. “Yes, of course. My apologies for keeping you up so late, John. I very much appreciate you putting your opinions of me aside to come here tonight.”
. Something about that didn't sit quite right with John. "It's not like..." He broke off. Greg eyed him closely.
John stared at the door. "Right. Thanks." He forced himself to take a step towards it, legs stiff as his mind raced and he wondered which of the three doors he was currently passing belonged to Sherlock. "I'll, uh… come down once I've settled in."
John's hand slid down the lemonade bottle, desperately searching for something to hold onto – the edge of the work-surface was good enough, giving him something to lean on...
too much these days, constantly overwhelmed with sudden waves of panic at what he had yet to process and understand, it's not as if he was suddenly at peace with feeling quite so much in concentrated bursts, and quite so little in the moments when his mental health restored its power over him, but he was adapting. He was becoming accustomed to it. This place, this house, this family... barring Harry, at least... it was like returning to a cell after a few months in a sprawling villa.
Sherlock was unable to stop himself from taking a few more steps into the room, close enough that he could make out the shine of John's eyes; the nudge his chest interrupted his train of thought for a moment, temporarily focused on the slight shimmer directed wholly towards him. He jerked his head forward slightly, forcing himself back to the conversation at hand.
"You weren't exactly withholding anything," Sherlock insisted defensively, his eyes now determinedly focused on John's slowly darkening ones, "you were all…
and now you'll get to hear him at the village ball!" Her face was practically splitting in two she looked so happy.
A gentle clipping of feet on the wooden floor, a rather bored-looking Mycroft wandering into the room and revealing a suit very similar to Sherlock's only with a mossy green as the additional colour as opposed to the smoky, silvery blue; he noticed with a start that Mycroft's green was almost identical to the colour Mrs. Holmes was wearing, and that Tim was wearing colours very similar to his youngest son.
Mycroft raised his eyes to the ceiling, turning from his little brother and stepping outside. “Let me assure you that there is very little in this world to which I would succumb to out of desire for pleasure.”
needs are frustratingly hard to ignore. It's a constant battle, and although the former is currently winning, I'm not sure how long that'll last.”
Before Sherlock had a chance to bite back, a retort already freshly curled on his tongue, a loud crunching noise signalling the opening of the garden door interrupted them both and bathed them in a flood of light, Greg's well-built silhouette blocking out any view of anything behind him.
cooking, not to mention this lot have been on at me to do a proper roast for the last few weeks. I tend not to do them when the weather gets a little warmer but, as it's a special occasion..." She glanced up at him and gave him a big smile. "Sherlock should be here soon – Mycroft, did you tell your brother that dinner was ready?"
It turned out that he would do it not once more, but twice – a group of girls came in (a totally wrecked, overly-affectionate Molly included), screaming for a challenge; Greg masterfully took over, pouring shots out for everyone in the vicinity (and apparently for the fridge and the sideboard too judging by the sticky mess slowly spreading out across the surface) and demanding that they do it in record time. By this point (other drinks having been consumed in the form of a crowded game of Ring of Fire and another of simply 'whoever claps last has to drink') John was feeling the affects of the alcohol big time, heat and confidence spreading through his body like flames until he no longer remembered what it was like to want to hide away. Why hadn't he realised this before? Alcohol was
Not for the first time that evening John found himself staring at the screen in sleepy confusion, even leaning forward to look at the words from a closer perspective. What had William been typing for a full minute before? Surely it hadn't taken him that long to write
William's awkward attempt at empathy was both surprising and something distinctly unfamiliar that John couldn't quite define; in his current state of mental being he wasn't sure he would be able to regardless of how much thought he gave to it, so he let it slide and instead began to type slowly back, determined to phrase his thoughts correctly.
By the time Sherlock had finished speaking, John was both in the throes of drowsiness and utterly involved, eyes wide open and body frozen in its sheer exhaustion. He had absorbed every word and knew that it would take some time to process it all, so many details to think over… christ, his mind was a mess of information. There were only a few things that floated with some clarity to the surface, breaking through the mulch and making him want to ask questions despite nearly all of the questions he’d originally had having already been answered – and he didn’t want to have to ask questions. The curly-haired man’s voice was already cracking from use, Sherlock’s body leaning forward in sheer exhaustion as his fists clenched and his eyes closed slowly and opened just as slow.
“I'm not the one who has issues talking about sex,” she replied sagely, looking far too superior for his liking, “I was just trying to make it less uncomfortable for you.”
The silence around the table was awful, awkward, unwanted. Not for the first time, John wished that he hadn't spoken, hadn't come here, hadn't even entertained the idea. It was the wrong time, both to have admitted his weakness and having thought he could actually return home and find comfort in it.
"No," John insisted, dropping his phone onto the cushion next to him and leaning forward, "tell me. What do you mean,
Not that it made sense. Not when his fingers had started to tremble against the strings and his heart had started picking up speed to the point where he wondered if the sheer force of adrenaline had ever been known to kill a man.
John eventually managed to push out some words, though whether they made any sense he was completely unaware. "The question... I wanted to answer the question."
Another tiny chapter, but I reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally hope you like it! -massive grin- Bet some of you guessed what was coming... MORE TOMORROW! Comments and reviews appreciated! <3
His tongue slipped out and across the smooth surface of Sherlock's kiss, his breath hitching ever so slightly in his throat as he tasted the remnants of toothpaste used three hours ago; he knew that this was the point where he should pull away, let them catch their breath, let himself believe that he had some sort of discipline enough to stop himself from continuing but that was impossible when suddenly Sherlock was allowing his lips to separate and opening up John's world into the deep, heady aroma and sensation of being able to dart a curious tongue into the dark warmth and feel the slick, very much alive curling of a tongue with no knowledge of which direction to take. He knew that Sherlock had never done this, he knew that he had never experienced the sensation of another tongue against his but that made it all the more intoxicating to know that he was Sherlock's first, in everything. He used every ounce of willpower within him to take it slowly, to slide his tongue against Sherlock's and then pull it back and focus on the movement of the kiss rather than progress with his desire to taste more, go deeper; it wouldn't have been inaccurate to say that trying to control the motions of his tongue was battling against the inordinate willpower it took not to let his hands dip down to Sherlock's waistband and find their way to the skin that waited there, tantalising and teasing him, but somehow he was managing it. Somehow he was still in control, despite feeling utterly without it.
right? To wonder why you did something so... so human? I mean, the best reason I could come up with was guilt. You felt guilty for dragging me along to your enigmatic little meeting with Leroy -"
Sherlock snorted, fingers tightening slightly on the bunched material beneath his grasp. "Emotional maturity counts for a lot."
"He's so intelligent," Wanda said somewhat wistfully, shaking her head back and forth as she took a giant step over a puddle, "just like his brother. I have no idea where they it from."
There was truth in that. For the first time since Greg had spoken of this insanity John was finally starting to realise that he hadn't considered Sherlock's actual feelings in any of this, just what
"The new rule is..." The boy thought about it for a moment, leaning his chin on his glass. "Hmm. Oh! All right! Everyone has to add
into my world. It is clear as day to you, I know that – just looking at your face it’s obvious that you knew what would happen and you knew how it would crawl and fester and grow within my mind… as you so accurately said earlier, you did warn me. And him. You warned us both. And I should have listened.” His head shook back and forth slowly, eyes glassy as they stared blindly into the fire. “I should have listened to you for once in my life.”
Sherlock met John's gaze for a moment, his eyes narrowing ever so slightly as the cogs within his head whirred and his sensational observation skills began to kick into gear; John could almost see the myriad of thoughts that settled and sparked in his eyes as he re-played the sincerity in John's voice, reading the expression of his face and taking from it what John hoped was the knowledge that, yes, he had found the music beautiful and, without a shadow of a doubt, had loved every last minute of his performance.
"Oh, well." Sherlock leaned back, crossing one leg gracefully over the other. "It's not your fault. I was in denial right from the offset. Disregarding the fact that I'd never chosen to tutor another student in the entire year and a half that I was a part of the PAT program and miraculously I decided to tutor you, I was quite determined to maintain a professional distance from the moment you sent me that delightful rejection e-mail."
So, just to throw it out there: I'm carrying on. I'll need to stretch my writer-y legs a bit - it really has been a rather shameful amount of time since I've tried writing anything even mildly creative - but I'm gonna give it a bash. Goodness knows if the fandom has died down or not, I would be the last to know, but I'd like to give this fic a shot at actually one day being completed.
A laugh escaped John's throat, remembering as he did how hesitant he had been to even speak to her, let alone ask her out. His last relationship had messed with his head in a big way. Yet another roadblock he was beginning to realise had probably impeded him in realising his feelings for Sherlock. "Ha, no, definitely not. Just... a bit of flirting. What do you want to know?"
Slowly Sherlock tucked the edge of the bandage into the layers beneath it, not looking away from John's hazed, confused eyes as he did so.
"Do whatever," Sherlock replied curtly, his tone still low, body still tense. "If it'll stop you from staring at me like I'm a dying puppy."
He slid out of the door without turning his back for a single moment, closing the door quietly after him and speeding off so quickly that his shoes squeaked audibly on the flooring all the way down the hallway. Joanne stayed standing for a few moments, listening until the squeaking had dissipated, her mind instantly cranking into gear and turning over the possibilities. What she wanted to do in response to her growing concern was to contact the university counselling service and put through a recommendation that he be contacted – after all, he had agreed (albeit hastily and probably with no intention of actually seeking support) to the idea of help – but she was well aware that if she did this she would no doubt push him away; young John Watson was clearly someone who did not want to face up to whatever he was going through, and she would not be responsible for making it worse.
Shit, he was running late. He was running so late. By the time he got to the Wyatt Building he was practically sweating from his insane journey there, his shin definitely bruised from smacking it onto the bloody bench that had come out of nowhere and his head starting to hurt from having to get up, get dressed and get to his introductory appointment within ten minutes. All in all it wasn't an auspicious start, yet John had to admit that at least because he was running late he hadn't been panicking about what he was going to say in there to whatever man or woman he found himself opposite. As a wise (arrogant, arsehole of a) man had once said to him,
John nodded, relieved. "Yeah. Yeah, no point keeping the charade going when there's no need to exaggerate the situation anymore."
"No, it sounds... great. It sounds really great. Party at Greg's, Friday." John forced another smile. "Fantastic."
This is the view from the top of Greenwich Park at the sort of time that this chapter is set, so this is how you can imagine it!
Against his will, the youngest Holmes seemed to be wavering at Mycroft's words. He began to pick, seemingly without knowledge, at his left thumbnail. “Yet I don't want to cause damage to John's already delicate emotional balance. As a friend, whatever we are, it's my duty to allow him freedom from my high-handed presence. Even if it's not instinctual, it's still necessary.”
John dabbed at the his lips with a napkin, determined not to be antagonised. "You aren't my mother, Sherlock, and I'm eating fine."
John raised his hand to signal the waiter, ignoring Sherlock. "Yeah, hi, excuse me? Yes, we'd like the bill please."
Silence at the other end. A small sigh, Mycroft clearing his throat. "I'll get a car. Don't worry about phoning Gregory, I'll do so whilst on my way."
Leaning back slightly but somehow managing to fight the urge to claw Sherlock's tight grasp from around his arms, heart thumping a little erratically at the sudden burst of adrenaline that shot through his system, he forced himself to meet Sherlock's intense, somewhat manic stare with his own calm, steady one. He saw the mania in the man's face, saw his desperation and he found he could not turn away from it, couldn't back away. With an inward sigh and a not-so-inward curse, he finally nodded.
Leaning over to grab the bottle of wine, Tim gave John a small smile, noting his need to be rescued from his enthusiastic wife. "So, John, Mycroft tells us you're studying to be a doctor?"
“Y'know, John, I had no intention of coming to terms with my feelings when they first began to surface; that night when I took you back to my home after being injured was the first time I actually acknowledged, in my mind, that I had feelings for you beyond any realm of friendship and it was, to be absolutely truthful, the most terrifying moment of my entire life. At that point, at least.” He let his icy stare burn against John's softer gaze, not wanting the man opposing him to miss a single word. “Whilst you were drifting in and out of consciousness, murmuring to me words of utter nonsense on my sofa and bleeding over my floors, it began to take hold before I even had a chance to consider what was happening to me. I took your hand within my own and began to see to your injury, stubbornly attempting to simply take care of the wound and leave it at that, cleaning away the blood and perhaps putting in more effort than I would have with anyone else in order not to increase your pain with my ministrations... but generally just allowing myself to settle into a routine of ignorance whereupon the only thing that mattered was cleaning you up. I was a fool.”
He gave up on the fist, groaning quietly as he moved his head to one side and tried to open his eyes. His eyelids were so
A thrill of apprehension wrapped itself around John's spine as he caught out of the corner of his eye the tiny grin that flitted over Sherlock's full lips; oh, christ. The last thing anyone should do during a drinking game is give Sherlock power – no, scratch that, you should never give him power of
“Then, yes.” Sherlock tilted his chin up slightly, pointedly defensive. “I am finding it difficult. I'm finding it difficult if only because he's currently attempting to reconnect with complications rooted far too deeply within his past, and I am not there to read his mood, his state of mind. Instead I'm forced to accept texts, texts which are few and far between, as my only method of reassurance that he is maintaining a hold on his exceedingly delicate sense of balance, all the while knowing that – limited as I am in person – I am now rendered completely unable to do anything of any merit or use from so many miles away. It is... frustrating.” His gaze was piercing, so honest that it took everything within Mycroft's resolve to maintain eye-contact. “And I am finding it difficult.”
have the ability to... form a relationship... well, it doesn't matter to me whether it's with a girl or not. The fact that he's capable is enough of a relief to disregard any sort of
John hesitated awkwardly, hands shoved into his pockets as he stepped away from the kitchen side. "Well..."
The melody of a pop song that John had once known all the words to floated across the distance between them and perfectly underlined the words he had been saying all along.
Desperately needing a distraction and not knowing where to look (why the hell hadn't be brought a book or something with him?!) he found himself reaching towards the end of the bed, dragging the jacket he'd thrown haphazardly over the edge over to himself and fumbling through the material to find the pocket which contained the black iPod that Sherlock had so 'generously' allowed him to borrow; maybe music would lull him into early sleep and calm his racing thoughts. Slowly he slipped the earphones in, laid back and closed his eyes.
Rolling his chair back to the centre of his desk, Jim steepled his fingers together and rested his chin lightly on top of them, casting his eyes over John for almost thirty seconds before he spoke. "Y'know, a lot of people feel that way when they come to counselling for the first time; honestly, I think it's the most natural reaction to it. Let's face it, it's telling someone you don't know the most intimate, personal details of your life and knowing that you have to place every inch of trust you have within this one, unknown person. It's putting yourself out there to be
"Yes, yes," he quickly said, not wanting his 'mm' to seem like an agreement of what William was suggesting. "I completely understand, and it's not... like that. I don't think." He forced himself to stop chewing at his lip, knowing from experience that he would subconsciously do it for so long that it would end up splitting and bleeding. "Although, of course, if I hadn't been depressed we probably wouldn't have spoken in the first place."
"I don't need to," John breathed back, finger trembling as it slipped against the bare skin once more, their lips still touching, "it'll be instinctual, just..."
"You're going to make me say it. Right. Well." He took a deep breath. "Sherlock, I… care… about you. Too. I care about you too."
John's hands trembled as he released their fists. He pulled his phone from his pocket. Found the number on his phone without even glancing down. Dialled. Brought it to his ear.
"I can bring him down here and show you his arms if you'd like," Mycroft said breezily, continuing to stare at him in a way that made John feel remarkably exposed. "Yes, John, my brother has a taste for opiates. Absolutely ghastly when he needs to take any form of pain medication, he's built up such a resistance to them."
"It's all right. The more we talk and the more open you become, the closer you'll be to understanding what I mean. But that's unimportant anyway," he contradicted himself with a wave, "we're not here for me to give you my opinions of you. I want to hear what
More rolled eyes – damn it, why was Greg so fucking casual about this? WHY?! "I dunno, it's not like I've really had time to think about it! The first question, really, is do you, y'know, think that maybe you might -"
"That's because there's nothing even remotely romantic about that book. And your story WAS romantic. Him making the effort to call you to tell you you're a git, his surprise entrance at the party, going for a candlelit dinner -"
Mycroft suddenly stood, ramrod straight and instantly with his back turned to both Greg and John; he faced the bay window, staring out at the empty and dark street whilst allowing John to sit stewing for an infuriatingly long time. It wasn't until Greg cleared his throat for the third time that Mycroft finally spoke.
The inflection on the ‘you’ was odd, should have made John feel uncomfortable but – almost as if proving what Sherlock had said – instead he felt a surge of warmth through his veins, a gentle tingling where there would usually be discomfort at the implied intimacy. A thought crossed his mind, a small chuckle escaping his throat; Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, body visibly tensing.
She shrugged, a 'what are you gonna do' sort of gesture; he'd seen John do it many a time. Ugh. John. Always John. "But at least you've stayed true to what you promised. You opened yourself up. You did it for John."
understand and to realise that it was never a case of not knowing and all just a simple desire to not allow things to change… but there was always change, and John was still waiting, John was still perched on the edge of his own admission and devastatingly sure that he would be left to collapse in the wake of it –
"I'm not meaning to be disrespectful by any count," he assured them all in those well-spoken, silken tones, "quite the contrary. I'm merely trying to respect
Sherlock leaned forward, face still impassive but his eyes… warm. So warm. "As you sit here opposite me I find myself looking upon a man of immense kindness, understated empathy and a seemingly irrevocable regard for me that no human being before you has ever had the grace or courage to even attempt. Certainly I have never allowed such a person to get close enough to try. It would be fair, I think, for me to return the word you so generously allocated to me and say that, in fact, it is not me but rather
"I must do," John half-whispered back, smile twitching on his numb lips, "I'm your friend, aren't I?"
And with that she was out of the room, humming gaily to herself as she creaked merrily down the stairs – he heard now, with his door open, the rumble of voices from below, not so loud that he could hear specific words but enough that he could differentiate between the different timbres. He found himself with a little ball of warmth slowly spreading through his stomach at what he was about to be a part of, still embarrassingly caught up in the feelings of being considered a part of this odd, wonderful little family – he found it was not too much effort at all to slide out from underneath the covers, stumbling slightly into the bathroom and plucking from the back of the door a navy dressing gown that smelled of clean cotton and lavender. He slipped it on and tied it quickly at the waist, glad that he'd at least put on a t-shirt with his boxer shorts last night so that he wouldn't have to face the Holmes family whilst feeling bare and exposed.
"Not that you two have to stay with us," Wanda interrupted, her eyes flitting between John and Sherlock with a familiar flame of determination within her pale eyes, "you can go about and do as you like, we won't mind."
Still bleary-eyed from his sleep, not to mention still in a state of shell-shock from the obscenely loud attack on his ears that was his alarm tone, John pulled his laptop from the chair and settled it on his lap, shaking his head violently back and forth in an attempt to wake himself from his post-nap stupor.
"Quite the contrary, John," Mycroft's voice was as steady as ever, "you're a depressive who is leaning on Sherlock for emotional support whilst side-lining the rest of your social group. Clearly you value him more than anyone else close at hand."
John gently put the fork down and put his hand around his own glass, iced water with lemon. Up until the food had arrived he had been finding it almost too easy to enjoy himself after Sherlock had left the lecture hall; he had of course been berated by the student-lecturer, practically told off for distracting him during teaching, but they'd kept up a steady stream of banter the whole walk around campus. By the time they'd reached a point of silence that couldn't be filled it had started to get dark, leading the curly-haired genius to suggest walking down into Greenwich high street to find somewhere to eat, a suggestion that John had taken him up on despite feeling no real desire to eat. He knew he wasn't fixed, nor was he ready to start making outings on a regular basis, but the day had been such an easy one to enjoy that he hadn't quite wanted to go back to his room and end it until he was absolutely ready to collapse.
"Speaking as someone who's only heard what you've said, so I admit it may not be totally accurate, this Sherlock fella sounds like someone who wouldn't just freak out over something that's not really there. He'd just disregard it."
He certainly wasn't trying to be endearing. Was it his ignorance? Usually ignorance was an unattractive trait, but perhaps if it was in relation to physical affection it changed somehow, making him go from irritatingly naïve to adorably innocent – ugh, no, that wasn't preferable, not at all -
"Sherlock…" John sighed, leaning forward and resting his weight on his forearms and elbows. "Sherlock, you care about me. It's all right to admit that."
Because either you're just a fucking genius at guessing games or you've hacked into my blog, either of which make you the biggest dick in the history of dicks. APOLOGIES if none of this is what you want to hear.
“Still,” Sherlock said, x-ray gaze as piercing as ever, “you will at some point. You may as well stay here. We can go over all of the studying you haven’t been doing later today.”
Bloody Sherlock and all of his bloody drunken deducing and gazing and touching his knee, deliberately brushing against John's arm (which, as he had told John later, he had done on purpose
. They didn't hug, didn't shake hands for longer than was necessary. He didn't need to be a genius to work out that blatant similarity in their personalities, and in all honesty it was actually a bit of a relief to know that he wouldn't have to go through all of the awkwardness forced upon him by people like Mike and Molly, connoisseurs in physical affection. He and Sherlock didn't have to do that if they didn't want to, and he had no doubt in his mind that
“That’s not what I’m saying,” Sherlock argued, thrusting himself to his feet and pacing to the other side of the room, clearly aggravated, “I’m not at all saying that I
John felt his head shake, though in truth he was feeling a little numb. "My guess is as good as yours." He walked hazily towards the sofa and let himself fall back onto it, his eyes out of focus as he stared in the direction of the fireplace. "I have no bloody idea what the hell just happened and I was here the whole time."
"Because Greg hasn't done anything wrong and you're acting like an arsehole. Just let him go and get his water."
John threw his hands up in the air. "Oh, well if we're doing this now – why the hell would you tell me your name's William if your name is Sherlock?! What, you were playing with me? What else don't I know, are you married? Have three illegitimate children? A time-share in Dubai?"
John stepped into the house and raised an eyebrow as he made his way straight to the kitchen, calling his words back to his friend as the tell-tale sound of carrier bags plonked onto the kitchen counter made its way back to where Sherlock still stood with the front door open. "Still Lauren? Are they actually…?"
I don't doubt your intelligence – the marks that I found by hacking into the staff university portal (an easy feat, I assure you) are proof of just how well you withhold information and the skill you possess to put it across into clear, concise prose. You work hard for the marks you get, yet now you see no reason to work hard whatsoever as your mind is so very proficient at making you feel that any effort would be wasted, that you would fail regardless of how hard you try.
Sherlock's fingers closed over the base of the violin, a warmth in his fingertips simply from touching it. "Lauren would be the one to ask."
“Perhaps I could have escaped it, simply attended your injury and left you alone to sleep, but then you did something remarkable that, before now, I haven't informed you of – it fell from your dry lips like a secret, like something that only you and I were supposed to hear... that is, my name. You just mumbled it once, my name, whether asking for me or half-dreaming of me or any other possibility you could lay before me but either way you had said it and it... reached out for me in the darkness and grasped a hold of my throat like a vice. I swear for that moment I lost all sense of reason and logic and instead was gripped by sentiment with such fervour that I felt as if I were drowning from it... because in your weakest moment, a moment where you barely knew who you were or where you were you
"No, this is way out of my league," she cut across, sounding genuinely apologetic, "never even heard of something so... so...
Sherlock finally brought his gaze up to meet John's, though the reluctance behind it was obvious. John could barely stand to look at it.
“Wrong.” Mycroft laid the newspaper beside him and lifted his hands slowly to steeple beneath his chin. “I am your older brother and your state of mind is something of importance, whether you choose to believe it or not. If you'll cast your mind back, you'll recall that the last time another human being cast such a weight upon you, you ended up in a hospital bed with no assurances that you would ever fully recover. This isn't just about you, Sherlock.” He cleared his throat, glancing away. “It's about all of us.”
Sherlock stood too, glaring imperiously across the table at his short friend. "We aren't done here! You have work to do!"
John could not stop. Peals of laughter shot around the garden, loud enough that eyes from the kitchen began to peek outside, so loud and long that Sherlock began to look concerned for his friend's sanity, reaching out with a hand but not quite touching him.
The sound of his name should have brought him back to reality; instead it drew him into this hazy moment even further. He was useless.
"But, fine. You thought it was necessary. You thought it was necessary to kill a man to ensure mine and Mary's safety and security. I
"Mm. Probably better if I don't try, I'll just end up confusing the both of us. But you clearly already understand the emotions behind a friendship, you mentioned earlier a best friend."
"No," Mycroft said casually, slipping his hands inside his pockets and turning slowly to face the interior of the house once again, "but unless you plan on missing Sherlock's performance we should probably make our way back to my parents."
Even the suggestion of it still made John's head spin. Though that could have been the champagne. "Well, obviously. I know it's not important to everyone else, apparently, but I'm still not gay.
Mycroft’s eyes narrowed slightly as he refined the information given, his gaze flickering momentarily in the direction of the bed and back down to John; his lips twisted into an odd half-smile. “Sleeping! I see. Do you and my brother often spend the night in each other’s beds?”
"I could say the same about you," he said sincerely, meeting her pale eyes with all the warmth he could muster. "You look absolutely radiant, Wanda."
He didn't want to see William's response; the fog was already so heavy it was suffocating, his own sense of failure and worthlessness so cloying that he barely had the vision to shove the laptop onto the mattress beside him before he slid his body down into the mass of blankets and covers, his nest, his safe-space. He lay flat, eyes open so wide they began to sting, dust particles and air settling against the shining surface without a care in the world; he ignored the discomfort, letting them water, blinking away the moisture and staring expressionless at the ceiling above his head as the familiar blanket of numbness embrace him tenderly and settle against his chest.
"Welcome, ladies and gentleman, to the annual Goring Spring Ball. My name is Benedict Londonderry and, for those who are blissfully unaware, I am your host for this evening!"
"I could live a thousand lifetimes, John Watson, and there would not be a single one not worth giving up for you."
A dialing tone met his ear; he didn't judge her for it. It had never been easy to be sentimental with each other – hell, it was easier being sentimental with Sherlock.
As he sat there on the eighth day, wearing a fresh hoodie (because he had literally found no clean clothes by the fifth day) and ratty jeans, he actually started to worry. So he picked up his phone, hesitating only for a moment, before calling him.
that you find a way around this academic block you seem to be facing! Believe it or not I do care about your future, and unless you give me something that I can take back to your seminar leaders I just don't know if I'm going to be able to help you get a concession for your most recent work.”
reading of them. He seemed to come naturally to the belief that I would judge them harshly which, I admit, is probably correct, as I am unable to be objective in the matter...” He pressed his lips together into a hard line, seemingly to collect himself as his rapidfire mind glazed over deductions he'd already made simply from knowing John as he did. Mycroft couldn't deny inwardly to himself that it was fascinating, watching his brother be mutually analytical and emotive. It was foreign to him. To Sherlock. “So it became necessary for him to partake in this journey alone, without my overbearing presence. And that is precisely why he is there, in what is undoubtedly an incredibly dysfunctional familial presence, and I am... here.”
"Like this, like this," John urged quietly, a hand leaving the shirt and rising to press light fingertips against Sherlock's lips; instinctively Sherlock formed his lips into a gentle moue, John leaning up instantly to brush his lips against both the gentle pressure of his own fingers and the shape beneath it, removing his fingertips and instead letting them take rest upon the top of Sherlock's arm as he encouraged Sherlock's progress with the unexpected softness of his oddly tender insistence. The hand left on his chest was now moving, trailing down to momentarily rest on his stomach – intimate, very intimate, perhaps
John was momentarily struck by Sherlock's words. "Your… hang on, your desire to talk to me? That's a pretty strong way to put it, and not at all how I would've described it."
Sherlock's lips pressed lightly against John's, a heated frisson akin to electricity sparking between them.
“Oh, for goodness sake,” Mycroft snapped, throwing his head back in pure frustration. “Must I deal with this now? Can neither of you see that I am requesting this change of venue purely out of necessity? Sherlock, you simply cannot stay here. I’m well aware that John probably hasn’t the
them hire it for me, I was practically forced," John argued, the heat from the pan mixing with the heat of his irritation, "though for the record I'm grateful to them for even bothering when it's obvious that this is a complete and utter waste of time. It's not like I could turn them down when they seem to be under the misapprehension that I'm somehow going to be of some use to you by being here."
"She's proud of you, y'know. Mum. Tells me all the time I should try and be a bit more like you." She didn't sound even remotely bitter. "She's probably right, to be fair."
He swallowed hard, feeling his heart hammering beneath his chest and knowing that it was impossible to try to concentrate when this man, this man who before had been his friend and was now so infuriatingly impossible to define in all his newly overwhelming magnetism, was just inches from him and so close that he could taste the tart edges of orange juice at every word breathed against his lips. He could not understand it at all, this feeling of want, of need, something that had seemingly sprung up overnight and was now so condensed and tangible that it was incomparable to everything else he had ever experienced and made all the more addictive knowing that
"I wasn't planning on it," Sherlock responded with a tiny smile, shaking his head. "I... well. I'm still awake. So you might as well stay and... entertain me."
There were a few moments of welcome silence before John spoke again, slightly hesitant in his tone as he seemed to shift the tiniest bit closer. "It's a lovely violin, Sherlock."
Those words did not belong to Sherlock. If John was willing to be overly critical, he would go as far as to say that it was entirely possible that Sherlock had created that tension in order to push John into saying what he’d been mulling over all day… because surely the genius knew that John, regardless of how he felt for Sherlock, was not ready for more than they had already experienced. Surely the lesser-experienced of the two was not prepared to offer himself up in such insinuating terms and gestures so soon after they had first begun this entirely new experience. Not when he’d been so cautious with kissing, so nervous, so inhibited. True, Sherlock had started to come around to a point where he wasn’t quite so embarrassed, taking significantly less time to reach out and place his hands lightly upon John’s waist or hips or arms, an act that tended to cascade heat through John until he could bear it no longer and had to pull away and deflect from the fact that he was millimetres too close to getting carried away, but he was almost certain that Sherlock was not ready for more than that.
" His voice echoed slightly in the darkness; John could feel the tension roll through his body like lightning, adding fuel to the adrenaline he was already experiencing and making him feel as if his skin was vibrating over his bones. "Don't joke. Don't pretend it's not a big deal. Just
"Really, Mother, isn't it enough that I'm going?" He did not look happy in the slightest as he stabbed a piece of chicken with his fork. "I don't see why it's necessary -"
Sherlock stared down at the food intently. "I know it had something to do with putting it in the oven. I'm sorry, John, I got distracted."
If John had been breaking before, he was certainly broken now. "You would have died and I would have known,
within the parents who couldn't be more unlike him if they tried – it was odd to see them rounded in concern, warmth emitting from them like a hot water bottle. Sherlock had looked at him with a
you're here for a reason but as of yet..." She opened her hands out, a veritable shrug; he watched her rub the side of her finger with the tip of her thumb, pressing her lips together again. So he was making her nervous. Good. "Well. As of yet I have no real idea of why you're here."
, and Greg, and probably anybody else who could possibly get involved that don't understand what the
So desperate to escape this situation as he was, Johns head began to nod, words falling out of his mouth before he could stop them.
The sound of Sherlock’s voice startled him out of his wonderings and brought him back to the moment at hand; John forced a smile, shaking his head. “I’m fine, sorry. I just want you to be prepared for what you’re walking into.”
"You'll have to be... more specific." Sherlock's voice was a murmur, barely audible; the low, velvety tones were so ridiculously deep that John could feel the vibrations of them against his skin despite their lips still separated by an infinitesimal distance.
"Just to him, I hope," John teased, reaching out with a socked foot and nudging Sherlock's shin with his toe. "Besides, I'm feeling fine. I haven't needed to talk to him."
The man fell into step by his side, large hands shoved into his pockets as his shoulders raised in a casual shrug. "But you're here, aren't you? That has to mean I'm doing something right."
Sherlock’s voice came from behind John before the shorter man could argue, deeper than usual and quite obviously still exhausted:
The words were dragged from him like molten fire. "You should have made me leave," he breathed against Sherlock's lips as his fingers reached up to tangle themselves into Sherlock's messy curls, "you should have physically forced me out."
, of nothing, of thoughts I can't even grasp hold of whilst my body is so needlessly rejecting itself?" His hands reached up, grabbing his own arms again so tightly that John could see the intents on his skin where the fingertips were digging in. "I thought it would all right to come here, that you would somehow
"He..." Greg sighed, suddenly looking as exhausted as John felt. "He's a bastard. If he'd just told you what I'd actually said none of this would have even happened and he -"
A smile flitted across her face. Smug. He wanted to psychoanalyse her until she wept. John was off-limits. "Is he the one who encouraged you to attend counselling?"
Greg closed his fingers to his palms slowly, his eyes becoming terribly sympathetic. "Come on, don't make me say it again."
I understand how you feel, but at some point you're going to have to sit down and properly decide what's going on not just in your head, but in your ol' ticker too. Because you love him, and you've
John did not waste a single moment; he tore his wrist from Sherlock's grasp and found himself taking three, four, five unsteady steps back until his legs hit the edge of Sherlock's armchair, struggling to keep his balance and remain upright. The light in the room brought everything into startling reality, the shock on Greg's pale face and the all too familiar indifference smoothing out the creases and edges of Sherlock's previously taut, intense expression – he found he could not look directly at his best friend, instead finding his eyes flitting to the ground and focusing on the patterned rug beneath his feet. The silence was deafening, worse than the thoughts currently shouting at him from every corner of his head... and there were a lot of them. They were racing and his heart was still pounding and he still had no idea what the hell had just happened and what was going on in Sherlock's brain, or maybe he had some idea and no desire to even consider it – christ, he was just confused. He was confused as all hell and now Greg was looking between them with his hand still on the light switch and he had no clue what he should say.
"Fine," the genius interrupted coldly, looking away from the both of them and towards the doorway, "if you won't leave then I will."
It was a challenge and Sherlock had no intention of recalling it; he knew that John would latch onto it, would react to it, would in the very least feel that familiar rush of frustration at being called both stubborn and ignorant in the same sentence – two things that Sherlock knew very well to be traits that John associated with the genius currently holding a grip that fell beyond the physical and stretched into... well. Whatever this was. He had the control, he held with within his fingers and he was challenging John to take it back. It was the only way.
She blinked, lips opening; he saw the glistening tip of her tongue as it dried out quickly, too quickly – yes, she was most definitely not comfortable with him. Her outward actions and words said otherwise, she had been doing this a long time and knew what she had to do, but the little things were giving her away. Not that she was aware of this. Nobody ever was.
And Sherlock was suddenly moving away from John and grabbing the camera from his victorious mother, Mycroft even cracking a reluctant smile at the situation as Wanda laughingly gave the camera to Tim and told him that this was the only moment they'd probably see such a sight and to quickly take a photograph of her and her boys, her arm reaching out and beckoning for John to join them and to accept that he was, now, one of them. As he stood beside Sherlock, with Wanda reaching behind her youngest son to pull him further into the photo and ensuring that he was more or less pressed against Sherlock's warm side - "we don't want to cut you in half, John!" - he wondered how it was possible to actually feel happiness in such concentrated doses, all in a continuous pulsing stream.
His response was awkward – there was no other way to react to any show of fondness from the sister he tended to not think about. They'd never really got on. This was the closest they'd ever come to any actual real semblance of sibling-related affection. "Yeah. Okay."
Stretching his arms out so hard his back gave a worrying 'crack', John let a blissful yawn escape his lips as he leaned partially forward to make the most of the moment; he let himself flop back down with a sigh of genuinely contentment, his eyes drifting to gaze out at the rain and finding himself completely entranced by the sheer velocity at which the water droplets crashed to the glass. He'd always loved the rain. He couldn't really explain it, particularly when people were obsessed with heat and sun and summer – ugh, summer – but there was something infinitely calming about the skies opening. Better yet would have been a storm. He loved a good storm.
He cleared his throat, the sound reminding him of John in an awkward situation. He'd heard of people who shared a close bond starting to mimic the other. Perhaps that was what he was doing. Fool. "I believe he is… ignorant to the situation."
“He wanted me to inform you that we are… friends. And nothing more. He wished for me to -” Sherlock was struggling to find the right words, enough that he wasn’t even aware that he hadn’t yet spoken the man’s name, “ – to assure you that it was only my wish to irritate you which led to our pretence at being… sexually involved and that there is nothing further than that currently… happening.” He ground his teeth together again, fully aware of the lame conclusion to his explanation. “He wanted me to tell you that.”
"...not really," she said apologetically, sounding further away again. "Sorry, John, but it sounds like a really complicated situation. He's not at uni anymore?"
Wanda and Tim both laughed, the former pink-cheeked and clearly in high spirits. "Well, we'll just have to take you into the village and see what we can rustle up for you."
"I'm sure I don't need to tell you that he is absolutely furious at me for inviting you here – he was rather explicit." Mycroft couldn't seem to suppress the urge to roll his eyes. "Needless to say he was rather dramatic about the whole thing but, I suppose, under the circumstances it's not too surprising."
Mycroft observed his little brother for a moment, seeming to consider his words. The moment stretched on, their eye-contact prolonged to the point of discomfort, until finally he let his lips separate and he forced out the words he quite ardently did
“Not that you’ll be alone next term,” Sherlock reminded him, hands gathering in his lap, “you’ll barely have a moment to yourself living with Greg.”
that John was shocked at even himself... but it didn't matter. It didn't matter. The teasing skin and the sudden awareness of Sherlock's slightly staggered breathing ripped him back into the moment and he found himself practically slamming his lips back down onto Sherlock's with such fervour that the most pathetic, delightful whimper vibrated from Sherlock's throat and tore away any remaining self-control that John had been holding onto and rendered him utterly useless to resolve.
Confident he was not being watched, John slid into his room and quickly shut the heavy door. He turned.
I am buzzing ~so hard~ after writing this chapter. I don't think I even care anymore if people review, I am having TOO MUCH FUN! :P (Okay, but I still love reviews. I love them. I need them. I love you...no, that's creepy.)
Sherlock doesn’t realise he’s spoken aloud until he sees reflection-John fold his arms and shake his head; damn. He’d failed. This was
"And enjoyment," Sherlock replied in a low voice, his fingers reaching out and brushing against the glass. "Don't deny it, you feel more alive right now than you have since you started university. Possibly even before."
She nodded slightly. "I think we should stop for today. You've been very forthcoming and have shared a lot with me, which is good, but I only expect you to go so far. I think you've reached your limit for now."
Gritting his teeth, John decided that he'd had enough. He'd bloody well go down there. He strode towards the shoes discarded by the door, stuffing a foot in roughly. "Forget it. I'll find out for myself."
John pulled his phone from his pocket, raising a finger to the still-shouting Mike and reading the text quickly:
, Sherlock, and I don't think that's asking too much after last night! There's no need to be such a... a...
A muttered 'damn' and the tiny sound of a lock being jimmied. "They've changed the locks since last time, this bloody thing won't go in -"
"Please, Mummy, don't bring me into this," Mycroft grumbled with a sigh, meeting John's eyes with a 'don't you dare mention this revelation to me in public' look, "I haven't played the piano for at least two years, I've practically forgotten."
John could not help himself. "You're doing fine, William. Better than I would be under the same circumstances."
They'd come across a little Italian place, the smell of garlic strong and the restaurant itself almost completely empty – Sherlock had given the nod, the two of them ducking into the dimly lit warmth and being taken to a large table more suitable for four and immediately served drinks. Sherlock had ordered a bottle of red wine before John could stop him, his desire to avoid alcohol of all types for at
“Thanks,” John muttered, raising his eyebrows as his mind fought to - pointlessly - defend himself, “and offence totally taken.” He let his eyes drift over to her, trying to recognise the pain-in-the-arse, rebellious and endlessly selfish sister he had last seen over fourteen months ago within the ally he had now come to consider her as. Even if she hadn't hated him whilst they were adolescents,
John stared at him incredulously, not at all paying attention to the game anymore. "What's it all about? What's in it for you?"
John reached out for it without even thinking, moving on pure instinct, but Sherlock was too fast; it was behind his back in a fierce fist and he was backing away before John could even touch it. John's legs followed. "Give it to me."
"You need to be aware of his current mental state, John," Mycroft pressed, eyes darkening in his obvious concern, "it's not as simple as either you or I could hope. It's not simply a case of being rejected -"
"How the hell did you get away?" John was gasping for air, wondering how the idiot was still standing after their mad dash from the observatory. "He was twice your size, he had you in a headlock -"
“Why would I ever want to do that?” Sherlock, despite having seemingly made the decision to leave the room, allowed his body to turn slightly further inwards to face Mycroft. “You know perfectly well that it wouldn't do either one of us any good.”
“On the contrary, the fact that you are here to talk about something which is blatantly bothering you is indeed of great consternation to me when you seem to already have a live-in sounding board… not to mention your intent to foray into the world of psychological therapy as of 2pm tomorrow.”
"John." Greg was suddenly earnest, looking intently at the man who quickly glanced away and was now looking hard at the bandage as if it were a life or death situation to get it positioned just right. "You were
"Mikey?" The moniker escaped before he could stop it, a grin twisting his lips up as he looked towards the now death-glaring Mycroft and let his amusement show without a hint of regret. He quickly schooled his features into a more appropriate smile as he forced his attention back to Mrs. Holmes, however, a strangely powerful determination to be liked by her welling up within his chest. "Mrs. Holmes, it's so good of you to welcome me into your home at such short notice, can't thank you enough."
"Oh, right." Mr. Holmes wandered out into the dining room, leaning down over something and clearing his throat. "Well, predictably it's labelled 'HolmesWiFi' – the passcode is -"
friends – and all these things combined allowed John to have the deepest, most uninterrupted sleep he'd had in the last few months. When he woke up six hours later it was a natural and gentle awakening where, rather than staring at the ceiling and deciding to just fall back to sleep (because what was the point in waking up?), he let out a satisfied groan as he stretched out his arms, pushing the blankets from his torso, turning on his side and finding himself facing a cup of tea steaming on the coffee table in front of him.
being Wanda and a vaguely agreeable Tim – chose a charcoal grey tuxedo jacket and trouser ensemble with a silvery tie and grey/silver waistcoat; Wanda was so complimentary as he turned in a reluctant circle for her that he actually started to feel good about it, catching his reflection in the misted mirror and finding himself genuinely surprised at just how much it suited him. On his third turn – spurred on shamefully by Wanda's constant remarks on how handsome he looked – his eyes glanced out of the window and found themselves meeting the icy, narrowed gaze of the young man who was now holding a brown envelope to his chest and staring intently at the scene separated only by glass in front of him; Sherlock was watching him with all the intensity of a hawk watching its prey, and for a moment John could focus on nothing more than the sheer fervour behind the gaze. It made his spine tingle.
John's eyes looked over the e-mail address again. "All right. Once a day? Does it really have to be that often?"
Sherlock opened his eyes very slightly, eyes hidden beneath long eyelashes. "If you'll cast your mind back -"
Something passed over Mycroft’s face; it lasted just a moment, and was gone before Sherlock could notice it.
As the idea settled and spread across John's awareness, a slow smile crept across his lips as realisation dawned. "You're suggesting a covert affair?"
, I..." He floundered a little, grasp on John's back tightening in his self-irritation for a moment. "If you could just show me?"
"Yes." Well, he'd said it now. He might as well carry on. "Yep, I had a very nice phone call with my sister about it, actually. As it turns out I had a
He couldn't call it an 'emotional rollercoaster' as that was to imply that his emotions were out of his control, and that simply wasn't the case; his emotions, despite his embarrassing little display in front of Mycroft, were very much in check now. Certainly the journey back in the cab was helping – he'd cracked the window a little, and the almost-warm breeze that was filling the back of the car smoothing away any edges that were threatening to cut through his resolve and ensuring that his mind was back to its sharp, concise processes. It was important that he stay lucid. It was important that he think this through rationally, logically, without the irritating haze of emotion that had so nearly made him demand that John Watson see sense.
They were a team. No matter how unhealthy it was to use the tactics that they were it made them closer, gave them a bond which was lacking between any of the other members of the Watson family. By the time age sixteen rolled around, Harry already showing signs of rebelliousness as she stumbled in through the front door at 11pm and rushing up the stairs two-at-a-time to brush her teeth and hide the smell of cheap store-brand alcohol, Sharon and John had perfected distraction to an art and – within their continuous cycle of pretending that nothing was amiss – had come to an unspoken agreement that the reality of their situation was never to be discussed.
. Your reaction – that is to say, your enjoyment – of our physical contact earlier is hardly going to be the same now as it would have been were you mentally sound."
Slowly, so slowly that the room became silent but for the breaths of the two men seated within it, perhaps edged with the slight squeak of his chair, Sherlock turned until he was facing John. He allowed himself a moment of avoiding eye-contact, gathering his wits together and enforcing within his mind a gateway to which he would allow the words he would unleash to fall from his lips without resistance, before he finally met John’s apparently all-knowing gaze and began to speak:
"No... mm... god, did I really say that?... oh right, yeah, there we go. Blimey, he's a bloody mind-reader..."
"And then I went back, torn between telling John the truth and waiting for him to come to the realisation himself. He and I spoke. He inferred something that affected me and I temporarily lost control of my actions. I made him feel threatened. I made him feel confused. We were… very close. Physically. It was my doing, not his. But he enjoyed it." This he said with certainty. "I
It was John's turn to shoot a murderous glance, this one aimed directly at Sherlock's smug-looking housemate. "How much sambuca did you put in this, Greg? I thought I said last time that under no circumstances are you to pour my drinks for me ever again."
“You say that, but the whole reason you’re here in the first place is because you wanted to be anywhere other than where I was.”
Greg continued as if Sherlock hadn't spoken, “ - but she kind of needs to meet you ASAP. Our new tenancy agreements start in a couple of weeks and she wants you to sign at the same time – simplicity and all that. Makes it easier for her, means that she doesn't have to sort out deposits and everything at different times.”
John knew before it happened that the blood was rising to his cheeks again. "Yes, well, of course... it was brilliant. He was brilliant."
thing that John couldn't even sleep on it to better prepare himself for the next morning. He'd stayed awake for hours just staring at the ceiling, staring at his phone screen, staring at the laptop, his mind darting between increasingly confusing thoughts until finally he'd sat up, shoved his feet into the trainers cast untidily next to his bed and gave up trying to think of anything whilst cooped up in a room that might as well have been a prison cell.
Without warning Sherlock turned his body to face John properly, legs moving to push roughly against his and face coming close enough that John could smell the lemonade, feel the heat of his breath and taste the vodka; Sherlock's wintry eyes did not move from his face as his knee slid between John's, shoulders bumping lightly against one another.
William hesitated, the pause almost audible. "You said that I would prefer our relationship to be purely academic."
John's sigh wrapped around him like a blanket. "I'm just as bad at this stuff as you. I can't just... come out with things. You'll have to be patient."
after he'd noticed the reaction it was getting), holding his hand and, finally, forcing him to ask himself a question that he didn't even have an answer to. And why would he have an answer to it? There was nothing to be gained from any of it. John had simply put up with it all because he was having fun with his friends and was actually enjoying watching Sherlock attempt to be sociable.
“Of course you do.” She leaned forward, resting her elbows on knees and tilting her head to the side. “Come on, we haven't ever talked about this shit. Do it. Get it off your chest. You've been suppressing it for years, god knows what it's done for your psychological well-being and I'm pretty sure we can both say with confidence that you -”
the same thing, Sherlock. You can't even compare the two. Sex is... yeah, no comparison. Sex wins. Criminal activity... doesn't quite cut it."
Barry faded out on the radio and was replaced by a very emotional-sounding Whitney Houston. Sherlock did not move.
"So, John!" They were making their way over a stile, John hopping over easily and waiting as Tim helped Wanda. She landed beside them and blew a strand of hair from her lips, barely stopping for breath as she began to walk again. "Seeing as everything we've learned about you so far came from Mycroft, I have to ask – how did you and Sherlock meet?"
Sharon's eyes skittered over to John, seemingly unable to comprehend the idea. John's jaw locked, preparing himself for what he assumed would be an emotional barrage. “I... that's absurd. You're just... no, John, as much as I've always tried to be an understanding mother -”
Her lips twitched at the corners. "Your appointment. Next Tuesday, midday." Sherlock forced a curt nod. "All right then, next Tuesday it is! How are you feeling?"
'. In other words, your actions and reactions to other people, what you say and do in their presence, they're what will bring you one step closer to truly knowing yourself. It's so easy in our lives, so busy and demanding, to forget to truly look at ourselves; the only thing most people really tend to do is consider how they're perceived by others and how that affects them as a reaction. You, on the other hand, seem to focus more on what you think of yourself
"All right boys, time to get the food into the dining room!" Wanda floated to them with a smile that was far too smug, holding a tureen full of sausages – were they having the entire village over for breakfast?! - and a pile of plates, winding her way through the space between them and the counter and heading towards the dining room. "Tim, make sure you're not over-cooking that bacon!"
Ceasing his curiosity, he brought the cup of tea to his lips and looked back towards Sherlock who was, rather than staring intently at the laptop, looking straight at him. He smiled awkwardly. "Very nice. Warm."
The hockey-player's eyes shifted from man to man, attempting to read the situation between them with a drunken, unsteady gaze.
Sherlock looked genuinely stunned, eyes blankly staring at John as if seeing him for the first time. "That's... no, it is, it's blackmail!"
Never before had John had quite so much champagne, and never before had he known was it was to feel completely and utterly out of his depth.
John could only nod, unable to find the effort within him to lie for the sake of Sherlock’s feelings.
John did not hold back; his fist went into the wall, all of the nothingness he'd been feeling all day disappearing as the anger flooded through his veins, pain a welcome by-product of his emotion. His voice in comparison was disturbingly calm. "Now, I know I haven't known Sherlock as long as you have. I admit that. Okay? I admit that. But what I do know -" He breathed in and out heavily through his nose for a moment, far too close to losing his grip, " - what I do know is that Sherlock,
Sherlock spoke, his tone mocking. "I'm sure one of your dresses could be altered, Mother. How about that muted blue one you wore two years ago? It'd go perfectly with John's eyes."
There was a slightly altered indentation on the mattress as John seemed to twist his body slightly to face Sherlock properly, the timbre of his voice low and oddly shy. "Would you mind if I asked you to play for me again?"
made me say it. So bloody stupid, letting yourself actually be vulnerable in front of your therapist -” John’s laugh is throaty, full, amusement laced with something far deeper and far more painful to hear, “- but I said it.”
Beside him, Sherlock calmly put down his own drink and removed his hand from John's leg, placing it on the table in front of them.
The man's voice was all warmth and openness, his soft Irish accent settling pleasantly in the space between them.
"You're a madman and a psychopath," John breathed, forcing himself to stand up straight as his entire body shook with the sheer effort of doing so. "And I am
He took a deep breath, raised his eyebrows and forced himself to meet her eyes. “I have depression, Mum. It's not like I'm...”
"I don't know," John admitted, rubbing his palm over his face, "I really don't. I mean, I guess it kind of helps me. Breaks me out of my... grey."
John felt a growing admiration not only for the infinitely determined Wanda but, incidentally, for the boy sitting next to him. "That was pretty brave of you."
It had been almost an unspoken agreement between them that they wouldn't talk about it until John brought it up. Apparently Sherlock's patience had run out. "There's nothing really to say. He introduced himself, we sorted out my sessions for the next two weeks before term ends." He shrugged. "Not much else."
"Liar." Sherlock turned away from him, walking slowly to the edge of the room to where glass cases stood in a row, pictures and documents behind them waiting to be read. "Elevated heart-rate, dilated pupils, rapid breathing -"
Greg had taken Lauren upstairs half an hour before the last guests had started to leave. They'd been up there for two and a half hours. "Christ."
Bringing his hand slowly down from the little plastic square, John looked at him for a moment. His mind started to race over possibilities, narrowing down Sherlock's obvious symptoms and pulling a diagnosis from the air, disregarding it and starting over – food poisoning, gastroenteritis, anemia, flu, stress -
Maybe John really was going mad. Maybe he had completely lost it. Maybe Sherlock was the sane one here. "Okay. Good."
The whirlwind-level of sentiment which he held for the man who was currently staring at him in slight concern was still unsettling. He realised, a few moments too late, that he should have spoken.
She was laughing, clearly enjoying herself. "Yeah, I remember. You aren't gay. Just gay for him. So how was it?"
"John," the voice admonished, irate. "This is very difficult for me and you're not making it any easier by interrupting."
A fast mutter came from beside him, Sherlock's lips barely moving. "He's going to make us hold hands for the rest of the game. I won't be offended if you refuse."
John stayed quiet for a moment, absorbing what Sherlock had said and looking his friend over as he attempted to observe what had changed so suddenly between the hoarse, frozen man of just minutes before and the calm, clearly spoken, far more familiar version opposite him now… but he couldn't place it. He couldn't find it, couldn't place the trigger. Sherlock's long, pale face was perfectly set in its usual expression - one of mild indifference - and his eyes, usually the only part of the man to ever give him away, were utterly nondescript. There was nothing to read. Nothing to go on. He had no idea.
And then they were, locked on his, so briefly that John wondered if he had imagined it – but no, there was no one else who could evoke that sort of fire within him, no one else who could make him feel the way he was feeling and he couldn't even remember the girl's name, had there even been a girl anyway? Had there ever been anyone but
The sigh that was forced from Sherlock's throat was loud, exaggerated, too loud in the silence of the conservatory. “Am I going to take an overdose just because John isn't currently in my company? No, Mycroft. I'm quite certain that I don't need to explain that this is an entirely different situation to that which I was in two years ago, and the fact that I need to say it at all is detrimental to your own far greater intelligence. Perhaps you need to consider which of us is
“Well then. Although I could deny such a thing and attempt in some ridiculous way to convince you that I’ll keep any and all thoughts to myself and would more likely come to a logical and undoubtedly
"No need to look so abashed, Mother, you're quite right." Mycroft seemed unperturbed by her words, looking as gracefully nonchalant as John wished
to be in each other's lives as much as they were. They had chosen to spend the last month with barely a day spent without having seen one another. They had chosen each other as much as anyone can choose anything.
don't want to have." He stamped his feet nervously, glancing back at his companion. "Can we please just give up and go home?"
