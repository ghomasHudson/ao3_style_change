He could see the shore now. Twinkling lights in the distance, but not quite near enough to hear the bustle that goes along with a busy port. Castiel grabbed onto the rails of the ship with both hands and inhaled the air deeply. The soft breeze brought forth whiffs of fish, sweat, ale, and coal amongst other things. It smelled like
Dior chances a peek from the corner of his eye and is intrigued to find the alpha’s face bordering on red.
Dior laughs - a short, crazed thing.
“Two weeks is the minimum for long term and it’s cheaper than the daily charge. How long were you thinking?” she asks, opening a leather-bound book that resembles the one Crowley has - a slightly disturbing detail, for some reason.
“Since the question needs to be asked, we suppose the answer is no, Sergei,” Princess Margot replies - using his first name as a subtle power move - still taking dainty bites of her dwindling meal.
“Quite well, father. I have managed a good amount of sleep and the hot bath this morning has eased any aches. I’m elated to have woken up with an appetite, too!” Anna replied enthusiastically. Castiel had to agree that she appeared in much better spirits today than she had this past week. There was a speckle of blush in her cheeks that had, unfortunately, been absent for a while. It was a shame, really. Anna had been born with a poor constitution, their parents having had problems conceiving after bringing Castiel into the world. It had taken them many losses and 8 years before their family had been blessed with Anna. It was a relief when she hadn’t presented by 15 and the royal physician declared her a beta, rather than an omega or alpha. It meant there weren’t going to be any more health complications that would come with imminent ruts or heats.
When prostitutes get with pups, they’re either thrown out, made to abort or to keep working throughout the whole pregnancy, left to bond with their unborn child only to have it taken away as soon as it’s out of the womb. The pup’s then expedited to an unknown orphanage, leaving their omega parents in shambles, empty husks yearning to feel small hearts beat against their own.
“You speak Spanish?”
“Whichever way you prefer, Your Highness. As I was saying, specify the day you’d like to see me and then my bawd will reply with the available times.”
“-I do not mean to harm your business in any way. I deeply apologise if I offended you - I must admit the fashion world is a mystery to me,” he says, conceding to the last part sheepishly. As an alpha prince, fashion was not something he was widely educated in. The palace has its own tailors and enough links to elite couturiers that he makes no decision in regards to what clothes are added to his wardrobe - simply informed of what is or is not ‘in trend’.
And then…
“I don’t want to be anywhere
And talk they do. When Castiel asks why Dior chose this particular place, the omega tells him he has never been, although he always wanted to. The prince is ecstatic to learn that Dior adores history and is extremely knowledgeable in regards to historical architecture. The prince sits and listens to the man marvel about how Napoleon Bonaparte was so eager to showcase France’s might with the quadriga taken from Venice - only for it to be returned to Austria and replaced with a new one after his downfall.
1 franc/livre = 100 centimes
More than halfway through his allocated time, he had moved along to admire the statues. Where the paintings had evoked many questions regarding technique and ideas behind them, the statues seemed to speak to Castiel on a much more personal level. They were all mesmerising. He found it incredibly hard to move from one to the next. They did not feel like chunks of stone and marble to him. He felt they were more alive than he had been lately, their faces full of emotions, their bodies posed in such a way that he felt they might get up and start walking any second. He felt more and more breathless. Oh, how could he have ever gone forward in life not knowing such beauty exists? It was blasphemous to him. If their Heavenly Father had left these amazing gifts for them to create and admire, would it not be disrespectful to go a lifetime without properly appreciating everything the world has to offer?
This means you'll stay?
Livvy (4) runs after Tommy (4).
Amara looks over to Dean, a passing acknowledgment of his betrayal towards her.
It nearly drained me but it should be safe now.
EMPTY
Billie bows to him in deference. Cas does not.
Amara, you're my sister--
And when are you coming back?
I- I don't know what happened. I was so angry at myself and next thing I know is this wave was taking over me.
It was a honest mistake and Jack agreed to it.
A pure human soul. He doesn't belong here. Not anymore.
And the awful times.
They get into the Impala and drive away.
Cas made the choice to end Billie and save you.
Sam, Dean and Cas stand up.
BILLIE
What are you?
I'm gonna have to sit this one out.
Please, come home.
JACK (cont'd)
I can't see them.
Was it you?
I will.
He saved me.
I couldn't defeat Chuck when it was needed. I can't save Cas; I can't save anyone!
But today, when I was holding the book, I thought I saw Cas.
Dean is saved from talking more when they noticed movement inside the house. The woman they're looking for, Danielle Sharp, leaves the house holding something.
MICHAEL
Jack? You're talking about Jack?
JUMP CUT TO:
CUT TO:
Me too. Perhaps one day Amara and Michael could replace me.
I lost Eileen. Jack lost Cas too.
CHUCK
CHUCK
Yeah. I love the little gremlins but I'm glad you're here.
(then)
He seems like a good man.
Someday.
About two weeks ago, Jonathan came seeking guidance, saying the Lord had spoken with him.
Sam turns at the door and sighs with relief.
But this is so much better than everything I could've imagined.
(emotional)
All I ever wanted was to sleep, to not be bothered but then your Angel showed up.
BLACKOUT.
JACK (cont'd)
MICHAEL
(then)
The Empty seems satisfied enough. They're in a truce, for now.
Don't worry.
The screams cut through the endless void, haunting and piercing as Castiel comes into view. He's crouching down, hands in his ears in attempt to stop the screams of anguish from coming through.
The Empty is a negative zone. It has a reverse effect in something that doesn't belong there so when you exploded inside the Empty, the black hole that was supposed to kill you was absorbed into you.
I want you to be honest with me.
SAM (cont'd)
CHUCK
CHARLIE (cont'd)
Dean turns around to face Sam, who barely recognizes the man looking back at him.
Still a little tired but nothing I can't handle.
Your powers are Jack's now. You're a plain basic human.
I just- I feel so helpless.
Do you think it was Jack?
I was about to explode when Billie send me to the Empty.
Chuck gets closer to Jack and snaps his fingers. One, two, three times. Nothing happens. Jack gets closer as Chuck gets desperate, showing fear for the first time since ever.
Jack, it's not--
JONATHAN (cont'd)
Castiel feels uncomfortable and tries to avoid the subject.
Why not? I should really stick to coffee from now on.
I'm worried about you.
Thank you for all you've done for me. I know it wasn't always easy or painless but you're my family. I love you.
Good. The bar is going great and we just bought this new house.
CUT TO:
TOMMY
The Shadow rebuilds itself in the form of Meg, mad and deranged.
MONTAGE OF SAM AND EILEEN HAPPY WHILE CHARLIE WORRIES ABOUT DEAN.
And I intend to collect it.
(then)
So yeah, it's my fault. Happy?
LAYLA
Of course I do. I already did, in fact. Is that why you called me?
Yeah. Just a headache.
(broken)
MICHAEL (cont'd)
Castiel wants to believe but there's something more than the invisible chains holding him back.
I'm not sure. Since I exploded in the Empty, my powers don't respond to me like it used to.
We'll see each other again. Goodbye.
I'm proud of what you're doing Jack, but I wish you could stay.
CUT TO:
Yeah. Me too.
TOMMY
And one powerful Jack.
Jack's eyes glow gold in one last attempt to reach his father.
Bessie and the kids too.
Do you want me to?
Yeah. Charlie already left the nest and she just got here.
Borrowed from a luck goddess. This is our golden ticket but we need to charge it up.
We should be asking that to you.
DANIELLE (EMPTY)
Yes, I just need to said goodbye.
Just reminiscing about the old times.
Please, come back.
BILLIE
BLACKOUT.
One of the last times we were together, I said I would buy a lake house and teach him how to fish properly.
It's my fault, Sam!
I can't believe it.
BILLIE
Any news on Rowena?
CUT TO:
Everything will be fine. I only need to do one thing.
Sorry. Lost track of time.
If you joined us, you could be teaching other hunters too.
He deserved better.
You got me there.
Well, I do. I'm your brother, it's my job to worry about you.
Dean ponders for a bit, his loyalty to Cas had clouded his senses. He sighs and finally drinks the coffee.
What about now? Do you think you can bring him back?
Who knows what's going on upstairs.
Dean avoids Sam's questioning gaze as they stop by the Impala.
Enjoying a little alone time?
As it stands, Castiel is barely an angel. I know you can feel it too, his fading grace gave place to a soul.
Why? Did he say something to you?
Donna leads them closer to the contorted chaos of the scene.
(then)
Your son. He said uncle Cas and you were his parents.
Sam and Dean jump in surprise to find Jack at the other end of the library, coming from the hallway. They have no idea how much he heard.
Billie and Cas part away with significant looks. Castiel looks peaceful with the end of his role.
The door of the barn blast open by an unseen force. Sam and Dean run inside only to find the young woman kneeling, the angel blade bloody in her hands.
Dean!
Dean! Why didn't you answered your phone? I've been calling you for hours.
What do you want me to say?
LIVVY
His regrets and wow, a lot of it has to do with you.
FATHER BENNETT
I miss them.
Not for a while. The universe needs reparation. What Chuck did, he ended the lives of countless worlds and it's my job to fix it.
Based on what Garth said, he just woke up for a normal day a week ago, and didn't turn or felt hunger. Silver also doesn't affect him anymore.
(then)
My head hurts.
And you, Castiel?
Castiel steps up.
Castiel shifts uncomfortably.
There has to be something we can do.
Alright but if it's nothing, I'm going back home.
Why would I do that?
Sam sighs in defeat, trying to not push Dean. They stop at the middle of the road.
Jack looks over to Dean and Castiel does the same. Dean is by the map table with Sam, Eileen and Charlie, trying not to look back at them.
FATHER BENNETT
I have no choice. Heaven is one angel away from collapsing and Amara and I are the only ones who can make it right.
I guess so.
BILLIE
She came to me when I was in hiding. She told me everything: the failed plan, Jack and that I was needed.
CHUCK (cont'd)
You don't?
Jack takes the coin from his pocket and hands it to Dean.
You're right.
I sensed your power, Jack. It's time we finally talk. Uncle to nephew.
Jack nods as silence takes over.
We should've just given Chuck what he wanted, his grand finale. But I resisted. I thought we could beat this game, do it better and the whole world paid the price.
But Jack told us he wouldn't interfere like that.
CHUCK
Michael summons Chuck near a lake while the sun sets. He appears to be alone.
We did have the world on our shoulders- more than once.
What did you expect? For me to do your bidding after you put my brothers and I against each other and left me to rot in the cage?
but yeah, to spite Him and that aunt of his.
The Empty undoes itself and disappears, leaving Castiel and Billie alone in the darkness.
Dean turns around in surprise to see her, a little embarrassed by what she saw.
(teasing)
How? You can only come to Earth if summoned.
Jack said Cas made the deal to save his life.
CASTIEL
CHARLIE (cont'd)
Sam and Dean walk to the car, parked on the other side of the road.
(to Dean)
We need your help.
Dean lifts himself from the floor, squinting his red rimmed eyes at the sounds of footsteps. He passes a hand through his eyes, trying to clear his vision from the unshed tears. Dean sits with his back to the wall.
The sigils are finished and all around them, they start glowing red.
I'm so sorry, Cas. I should've said something. I should've...
Great, actually. Just came back from Jody's, Patience got into Stanford. Can you imagine?
Can you take us there, kid?
all that I stood for for thousands of years before coming down to Earth and meeting Sam and Dean.
They drink as we pan closer to the table where their carved initial are accompanied by two other names: Cas and Jack.
Even when I became human for a short time, I didn't feel like I feel now which doesn't make sense at all.
CASTIEL
Send a message.
Where's Sam?
Don't let him get into trouble.
Really, Dean?
Great rescue, by the way. Sacrificing yourself for love, such a Winchester thing to do.
Dean seems hesitant.
Nothing, just, you know, the case.
Everybody is gone.
Hey, guys. How's life going?
There was once. Some version of your death but you should know, more than anyone, you cannot control free will.
Dean meets Sam's gaze with a deadpan expression.
Cas, it's me.
That "Carry On" made no sense. The pacing was off, the boys were isolated like only them existed in the world and their conclusions only makes sense if you watch Season 1 only.
Jack snaps his fingers and they all disappear, leaving Chuck alone, screaming at nothing as we-
So, won't you introduce me to your friend?
And I can make it quiet on the principle that you return this domain to what once was-- Peaceful eternity.
Your powers happened.
CUT TO:
Simple but effective.
Hey Jack, of course it is. Dean and I were just talking.
It's Eileen. I will...
CHUCK
Jonathan turns away and leaves despite Layla's protest. He hops on his motorcycle and drives away.
Someone who underestimates you and has no idea how powerful you are.
BILLIE
Jack's eyes light up as he stretches out his hand. Gradually, the Empty starts to fill with screams. Sam and Dean cover their ears in pain.
If there's one thing I learned since I came into this world is there's nothing a Winchester can't do.
CUT TO:
You can't do this to me.
CASTIEL
BILLIE
JONATHAN
Nephew. Chuck was right, you did change.
I guess I waited too long.
CHUCK
Mommy said she would go to the market.
Dean, I think-
Donna directs the question more at Dean than at Sam. Dean, who has been uncharacteristically quiet.
No- Billie. She was going to kill us. Cas, he summoned the Empty and it took both of them.
DEATH (cont'd)
CASTIEL
CHUCK
Hello.
We'll be safer here.
Sam looks at Tommy.
Yeah, maybe.
Fishing but like full on fishing with a house by a lake.
THE SHOT WIDENS AS CHUCK COMES INTO VIEW.
Dean turns to Sam.
CASTIEL
I can sense your soul even if you still have some trace of grace left in you.
How can it be your fault?
Don't we all?
(then)
They turn to the voice at the entrance of the library in shock and confusion to see CHARLIE staring back at them.
BILLIE
Dean stands up, looking appalled.
Jack serves himself some coffee as Dean stands awkwardly in the corner. The reminder of their last interactions only make him feel worse.
Yeah, Charlie keeps saying that too. Not sure I believe it.
Billie. I was waiting for you.
I know we haven't met under the best circumstances... ever but I wish you all the best, Adam.
Lord, give me strength.
Where's the angel Castiel?
Jonathan, Alyssa, Matthew and our newest friend, Danielle.
(then)
He waits for anything to happen, a sign but his pleading doesn't work this time, no matter how much he wants Castiel back.
Exactly. He appeared and said that what Chuck did to me was too cruel and that I deserved a second chance. Then I woke up at my mom's house. She almost passed out.
Well, I don't want to spoil the surprise but it'll be the heaven we all deserve.
(smiling)
With this.
I want you to have this.
Think he'll show up?
DEAN (cont'd)
Why are you smiling?
Cas, I don't know if you can hear me. I don't even know if you're still alive or trapped somewhere but if there's one small chance that you are...
Dean, we'll get him back.
You have our word. It's a deal.
Are you coming, Jack?
MICHAEL
Dean smiles sadly and looks away.
To everyone we lost along the way.
(to  dean)
Billie clicks her scythe in the ground 3 times. Nothing happens until a voice speaks behind her.
A moment of silence and tension passes as they wait for the sentence.
They follow her till a barn in the outskirts of the town. It's so dark they can barely see the woman if not for the reflection of the blade.
Layla Eves calls her boyfriend from the stairs of their home.
Speaking about happy futures...
Chuck walks over to Michael and picks him up by the collar of his shirt.
She took a shower and dipped.
The local church is a modest one with only the colorful stained glass imparting an air of an old temple. Sam and Dean enter the church and approach the old man standing by the altar covered in angel imagery.
Do not bother me again.
Cas? Cas! Why doesn't he awaken?
INT. MEN OF LETTERS BUNKER - CLASSROOM - DAY
I finally understand you. You never cared about your children. Not the way humans preached about it.
But they'll get grounded only after we go to see uncle Dean's new house.
I hope it's not too late.
DONNA
It's part of it.
Thank god you're here.
DANIELLE
The world appreciates your sacrifice, Castiel. You always struck me as one of a kind angel.
Cas, are you alright?
Jack turns to them as--
CHUCK
(then)
Sam and Dean turn around to face Jack. He looks the same since they last saw him, young and childlike but the power that came from him was nothing short of divine.
Uncle Dean, will our cousin be there too?
Dean glances back at Cas and Jack.
Dean stops, looking over his shoulder at Sam. His brother seems like a kid again, waiting for an absent father to step up.
EMPTY
Thank you, Adam.
Can you get to the point?
Dean?
I hate chaos and you, the Winchesters- you're the definition of it so how about we work together one last time? I promise that once Chuck is out of the picture, we won't ever cross paths again.
And how are you guys holding up?
And, you know, come visit us anytime.
Sam, we don't have much time.
MICHAEL
(then)
How are you here?
That went smooth.
(then)
Only one way to find out.
Livvy cheers.
I know but now that you know what's the other side like, enjoy your life Kevin. You earned this.
It's cute how much you try.
They look back at Michael who's standing near a wall like nothing had happened.
They finish the phone call and look at each other, stunned.
Can I speak to our brother?
Still, you look happier than I've ever seen you.
CHARLIE
CHARLIE
Just make sure they'll be okay. Jack, Sam - and Dean.
You can go. I'm not in the mood.
Yes but I learned a lot from you and Cas and my mother. You taught me to be the best I can be even when everything seems hopeless; to stand up and fight for those who can't protect themselves.
The Empty stars to force choke Billie as Cas watches, unable to do anything.
So, how's it going lately?
Die Dracula!
What do you mean 'would've'? Is he-
Again, Tommy?
One would think Death to know better than some lowly humans.
They stare at the walls where once was the portal, hoping Jack will turn up out of the blue.
What the hell happened to the Empty?
This should do it.
Jack, we should go. There's much to do.
Dean nods and goes to talk with the witness as Sam and Donna keep chatting. He pull his badge out.
Sounds like you're torturing yourselves.
You texted her that?
How are you, Cas? Really?
Almost everything.
Jack snaps his fingers and suddenly, they're back at the bunker, in the room where Cas was taken.
What about you? It seems I only call when Cas is home.
“Let me help,” he whispers low, affectionately. “Tell me what you need - be it money or something else. Please, let me help, Dior.”
Sam chuckled. “Well, I guess that’s true. So, I’ll take a leap and say you’ve never been here before. Would you like me to give you the rundown of the nursery?”
Sweat and pheromones and iron explode and the omega almost pukes his guts out on the already grimy cobblestone.
Castiel’s stomach sunk with the thought. He needs to try harder, needs to offer Jack everything Kelly would’ve - and more, if at all possible.
“Exactly like that,” Castiel smiles. “He has a penchant for mischief, although much more… complicated. Yet subtler than Gabriel’s - he is the third born and a harsh contrast to Michael, who is the most prim and proper man I have met.”
Dior wasn’t sure what he had expected the inside of the museum to look like but,
Oh, dear God.
Courtesan - a prostitute with a courtly, wealthy, or upper-class clientele. Could also be 'kept women/men' away from the main household
Balthazar kicks a little mound of snow, making Castiel chuckle, “You would reckon you have learned your lesson by now. Remember when you broke three of your toes?” he asks.
The prince’s head is resting on his crossed arms at the edge of the mattress, from this angle looking like he is sitting directly on the floor. His dark eyelashes flutter ever so slightly under Dior’s scrutiny, a slight tremble that is in sync with the movement under his lids. He looks more at ease than Dior has ever seen him; the straight, composed back and attitude he’s gotten used to - gotten to think of as stupidly nice - nowhere to be seen.
His earlier worry and anxiety rear their ugly heads again once he’s been reminded of Lisa’s absence. Where could she have gone? This never happened before - it makes him squirm unpleasantly.
Lisa was there when he felt like there was no light in the dark anymore, when he stopped caring what was asked of him - how many blemishes he earned. She was the one to - literally - slap some sense into him, crying
in the presence of its source.
“Please- forgive me. I never intended to make you feel unwanted. That will
“What is the matter?” he asks, eyes wide in wonder. The vibrations don’t stop - his heart aches with them. “Do you not believe yourself to be worthy of salvation? Of
No. Dior needs to take control over this situation. He needs to-
As usual - my many, many, MANY thanks and undying gratitude to my beta <3 She is an absolute gem, seriously.
, number 66. You will need to send a letter through one of your footmen asking for an appointment specifying a day -”
Disturbed at Dior being referred to as some sort of object to be ‘kept’, Castiel is curt, bordering on rude when replying, “Of course.”
Dior tries to laugh but it comes out as a puff of air, “I guess so, kid.”
He starts shrieking when the thunder-clap pain hits. Blurry shapes turn black and then to colours and then it feels like he’s looking through the thickest, most textured glass he’s ever come across.
seemed to bloom in the alpha’s scent. Seriously, what the hell was he on about, thinking he can smell
Castiel smiled and cleaned him up with a wet wipe. “How is even your drool cute? It should be disgusting.” he mused, stroking Jack’s cheek minutely.
Once Castiel was sure Jack was deep in slumber, he turned his laptop on and opened the email he had sent earlier. He booked a Santa visit here - a petting zoo slot there - along with a couple of other outdoor activities that seemed infant appropriate.
Uriel. I hope you will join another game of poker with me tonight.”, he quickly greeted the third alpha, nodding his head back to the cards table, an inviting smile on his lips.
He moves onto his neck, making his way down his abdomen and twisting so he can get to his back. He makes sure to give his groin area a very attentive scrub but keeping it gentle, still feeling a bit off after his check-up. When he starts his descent down his thighs and shins he stops again.
Meg’s smile broadened, and if he had to guess, Castiel would think that was her intention right from the start.
It was very well known that the Crown Princess enjoyed the pleasures of prostitutes, having taken on two from
“Would you like to join us, Your Highness? You do always make things so much more interesting.” Alastair said, coming behind him and inhaling around his scent gland sharply. “This little one also knows how to make things pleasant for alphas. We promise he won’t disappoint.”
The beta shakes his hand firmly and quickly, “It’s not a completely selfless favour.” He gives the pair a once over again, “A pair of nobles such as yourselves wearing my designs is bound to be good advertisement.”
Dior gives him a sorry shadow of his usual smiles, “Not for prostitutes they aren’t.”
“I’ll give you a piece of paper with the details for curfew, rules, meal times, and so on,” she continues, opening a drawer, presumably looking for a quill or pencil.
Missouri hadn’t given you the dishwashing job in exchange for food, then you’d be starving and it would be on
Dior did not leave the Prince’s side until the end of the game, which they had indeed won. The other three alphas laughed.
“Have faith, Lucius. I am certain Gabriel will settle down as soon as he mates and marries.” Michael added.
I can't wait to hear what you all think <3
Dior opens his eyes desperately, colours morphing back into shapes, tear tracks dry and pulling at his cheeks where the salt has dried. His eyesight is clearing, his breathing still laboured but not desperate. The omega dares to bring his head up, a quick look to his surroundings bringing forth the image of Dr. Sunders kneeled right next to him, an expression he’s never seen on her face before. She seems - is that
“Yes. He won’t let me keep any of it,” Dior says, undoing the last button and starting to slip the coat off his shoulders.
The omega submerges completely, up to under his chin, making sure his scent gland is covered and remains in the tub until it has started going cold. He is still without his sense of smell, can only hope that the obscene amount of the neutralisers have done what he needed them to do.
1 sou = 1/20 of a franc = 5 centimes
“She appeared to be agreeable to it. Proposed we - well, mainly I - make the most of this opportunity. She also kindly reminded me that I am due my mating cycle in this timeframe and I ought to find a cycle assistant whilst we reside in the palace,” he says, and although only the idea turns his stomach over, Castiel knows he will follow the instructions - orders, really.
It was with his head buried in work, quill scratching across paper noisily that Hannah returned to his main sleeping chamber.
He only has another hour and fifty-five minutes before Dior is expected back at the
Dior was the best earning prostitute so he was given a modest but well furnished studio on the last floor with his own personal water closet and tub. No running bath water, but at least they had working plumbing for the toilets and did not have to resort to chamber pots like half of France. His room had a comfortable four-poster double bed, a good sized sofa and coffee table in front of a rather large, round window overviewing the busy streets. He had a desk, a fireplace, good rugs that didn’t feel scratchy on his knees whenever his clients were feeling particularly feral. On his floor it was just him and Ruby, the second highest earning of the omegas.
“I want to.”
He watches himself bring his fist close to his face. He sees fingers open, gooey strands of brown spreading like fish webs between them, lumpy and deformed pieces sitting in the middle of his palm. He regards himself as he brings shaky fingers to the disgusting mess, dragging them, bit by bit, first over his skin and then through the goop.
Dior was
for it at the end?” stop, stop,
“O-kay. Colour? They can vary from light to dark green or we’ve got some silver-blue varieties.”
Cuevas,” Cas replies, “I’m James and this is Dior, my - friend.”
“If it will stop them from spouting anymore nonsense and giving me headaches every day, I am willing to try almost anything.”
He started gently rocking the crying baby, humming his favourite nursery rhyme in a low voice and cradling his face into his neck, hoping the vibrations would soothe him. It took a few minutes for Jack to go from eardrum-bursting shrieks to sniffles and sobs but they got there. It was better than nothing.
Balthazar had remained at the Palace so he could provide Castiel with an alibi if anyone were to enquire about his whereabouts. This past week, they had attended several official meetings and parties, yesterday having been the last in the series for a while. Thus, they had both made it known that today they were to rest and be left to their own devices unless they directly called for assistance.
please help me. It-hurts-it-hurts-it-hurts!
“Hmm… I started training and working in the spring of my fifteenth or fourteenth year. So it would be three and a half years, now.”
Chrissie steps closer and Dior wants to flinch, thinking back to how Cas had stepped closer to him last night. He doesn’t have the energy to. Neither is he able to tell Chrissie off when she takes a sniff off him.
“That’s just a synonym.”
It blows breath back into his body.
The patrons’ attention wasn’t the only one the rickety hinges attracted - the matron at the front looking at him expectantly. The omega makes his way to her quickly, belatedly realising he’s been standing in the door frame for an uncomfortable amount of time.
He chooses an attractive burgundy attire that is comfortable to move around in and won’t stand out too much. Cain didn’t like being the center of attention and that was fine by him. He preferred blending in. He put the small knife that the alpha gifted him on a thin fabric strap around his ankle, under his trousers.
The woman speaks again once Dior can no longer hear his lungs trying to oxygenate, “Very good. Now you can tell me.”
“It is the first time I have seen so many bolts of fabric in one place,” he says conversationally, hoping his unease does not leak into his words. In other circumstances, the prince would not hesitate to ask about it - right now, however, he is worried his bluntness might cause them to be dismissed from the premises. Thus, Castiel continues to keep his questions to himself.
Dior was there the first time a client visit went south for Lisa, he was there to massage feeling back into her numb thighs, clean the open wounds on her scalp where small clumps of her beautiful hair had been pulled out. He still remembers her silent trail of tears as he rubbed her back until sleep took over her.
Dean’s grin turns into an outright beam and their surroundings suddenly seem brighter, as if the man itself was the light source and everything else gets to bask in it. Castiel realises with a start that Dean’s eyes are green - an evergreen that promises forests and whispers in the dark, smiles in crowds, and lives lived well. They have flashes of gold now and he doesn’t know if that’s simply the light from the lamp posts or if it’s possible for someone’s soul to shine through irises.
It is at that moment that the betas return and Caesar hands over two pieces of paper to Castiel, “The first one is a receipt of purchase and the second one is a ownership contract. Feel free to read it over before signing since you’ve never come across one before.”
He excused himself from the couple with half a word, knowing full well he must have appeared a lunatic. Castiel couldn’t find it in himself to care. His legs lead him around the waves of people, going faster and faster until he was practically skipping across the building. Every time he thought he was getting closer to the source of this smell, it seemed to disappear between the vast amount of other smells. Everything else smelled so wrong. Had the world always smelled so… awful?!
Castiel can’t help himself and says “Was that a flirtation?”
Dior ponders his answer before finally replying, “We’re not allowed to keep presents from our clients.” resignation resonates both in his voice and scent. Castiel is getting quite fed up with how it contorts it into staleness.
, when he speaks next, “You’re shivering,” he says, slipping her drenched shawl and letting it fall to the ground, “I haven’t emptied my bath yet and it’s still hot, would you like to go in? It’ll warm you up and hide your scent, for now.”
“No, Lisa, I can’t-”
Suddenly, the whole room quieted down around them; the change in atmosphere was palpable. They instinctively looked at the top of the staircase where the butler was standing to the side of three very imposing figures. The French princesses were announced and everyone in the room kneeled, waiting for them to reach the bottom of the stairs.
“N-nothing ever comes for free and I a-am destitute in all manners of life…” the omega whispers under his breath so softly that had the silence not been so acute, he would have missed it.
A hand lands on his shoulder and the prince stops walking. He turns around and is greeted by his friend’s unusually somber face.
CW: lots of angst with some comfort at the end of the chapter, Mature Dean/others, unsafe statutory non-con masochistic encounter (person A gets off on the pain they inflict and Dior allows it due to his status. The sexual part is only alluded to), panic attacks, suicidal intent, subconscious self harm (the character doesn’t realise this is what he’s doing but it is self-harm), vomiting, vivid imagery of migraines and passing out because of them
Probably knowing that they won’t be getting anywhere with him, Dr. Sunders ceases her insistences. “Very well. Try to sleep early tonight, and if you won’t accept a prescription, use dried lavender in your baths for the next week - it will help with insomnia and hopefully ease any future migraines.”
Castiel is all of those things. This is how God has created him, and they are his sins to bear. But he shall bear them forthrightly.
Crowley looked at his diary, “You’re off to Monsieur Cain for most of the day. Starting at nine this morning and you’re due back by four this afternoon. You then have a full evening of bookings so make sure you’re back in plenty of time.”
. There appears to be only one redeeming option. I must come to see you again and we will indulge in sugary goods first thing,” Cas say, arms folded in front of him, eyes closed and head nodding gravely.
It’s been a few days since he’s seen the Prince.
“Cas, are you sure? You really don’t need to-”
“I know you’re only doing your job, of course, but it is highly unpleasant,” he says, going for a light tone but falling short.
. There really is no time left for a meal, as he had planned initially.
“Nightmares?” Cas asks, both curious and confused how pieces of fabric could cause such a reaction.
When Ruby finally comes out it’s - if possible - even more livid than she was earlier. Face coloured red, whether in fury or embarrassment, she slams the door to the makeshift consultation room so forcefully the potted plants shake. She doesn’t say anything to anyone and stomps upstairs aggressively enough Dior wonders if she hopes to break the steps.
“You’ve heard him - stop your blubbering. He’ll be fine,” the alpha says convincingly and flippantly enough that some of the tension in the room eases, “Aiden, go. Dr. Sunders is waiting.”
. Castiel may, or may not, have just decided this man was perfect.
Dior doesn’t watch her go through her mental checklist as she lifts and pokes at him. He tried to watch the first few times he had to go through this, hoping to ease the burn in his cheeks and eyes. When that didn’t work, he decided he’s better off not looking.
BACK TO:
You just have to want it too so the Empty can't hold you here.
Protection from the Shadow and for what we need to do.
Donna is talking to her colleagues as Sam and Dean approach. She smiles the second she sees them.
CHUCK
Sam and Dean watch as the Jack absorbs Chuck's powers. Chuck falls, defeated.
You mean this one?
You don't seem too thrilled to be awake.
MICHAEL
Castiel smiles sadly.
CUT TO:
It's not your fault either. He loved you too much to burden you with the truth.
I'll always have time for my annoying little brother.
Jack puts his hands in Chuck's face, golden light coming off of him as Chuck cries out in pain. As he screams in a sea of light, darkness is ripped out of him as Amara falls to the ground.
How are we gonna find him?
CASTIEL
We saved Cas; Jack is taking care of Heaven;
But Jack, you're still a kid.
SAM (cont'd)
FATHER BENNETT
JACK (cont'd)
DANIELLE
How are you holding up, kid?
Me neither, little brother.
BILLIE
I know.
(then)
Sam and Dean observe without a word as Jack moves through the scene, checking the people passed out in the ground.
Are we having fun yet, son?
CHARLIE
You lie!
It should work like rock salt in ghosts.
Sam goes to hug her.
Reminding them who they are.
Aunt Rowena said so.
Take care of him, alright?
LIVVY
(to Michael)
I couldn't give a crap about your powers, Cas!
What the hell?
DONNA
Jack nods as Sam steps away with unshed tears. Dean is silent as Jack turns to him, a million questions about Jack's place in Dean's heart are answered when Dean hugs him.
Don't forget about us.
(then)
I have no idea how work skins work for screenplays but you can also check this chapter in it's pdf form here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17R_ianZbPj1CdrkqfuYR_DZ6CL18YfVw/view?usp=sharing
CASTIEL
Agent Harrison, FBI.
It's never too late.
And you can always count on us for whatever you need.
A lot and it's complicated. We'll explain everything later.
If he's at the lake house by now, yes.
Jack reaches out to fix the lamp in his nightstand but it breaks at his touch. Jack looks bewildered as we-
A 25 year-old man and a 40 year-old woman. No relation to each other, different backgrounds and social lives.
Take Kaia with you, it's good to change scenarios once in a while.
Can you do something to stop them?
Sam looks at her again and notices the visible differences: the haircut, the nerdy clothes, the awkwardness.
MICHAEL (O.S.)
Jack hears a soft thump in the sand beside him as the old coin lays mere inches from his fingers.
CASTIEL
I reached for it and I felt warm and protected like I only did when I was with Cas.
The Empty.
Cas's whole personality is odd.
You're enabling their bad behavior.
Don't wasted your breath, he's not answering.
But I can see him.
Not my fault? You don't get it! Everybody was counting on me and I failed!
Guys, you're here!
CASTIEL
(clearing his throat)
CHUCK
Uncle Dean!
SAM (cont'd)
LIVVY
Alright. Maybe we should go see Rowena. Perhaps she has a spell or something to track him.
Is that the witness?
KEVIN
(then)
So, what now?
She went to her house to get the rest of her things.
He squeezes Michael's neck until he loses consciousness and throws him away. Michael rests on the ground, unconscious but alive.
EMPTY (cont'd)
CASTIEL
She snaps her fingers and the missing people appear behind Sam and Dean. Before they can fight, their weapons are taken with a simple hand wave.
Sam gives a worried look at his brother as he crouches next to him and taps him on the shoulder. Dean stirs awake, throwing the empty bottles near him to the side.
I'm not hungry
Billie gives the coin to the Empty, who smiles sharply.
What?
Do it.
CHUCK (cont'd)
Well, now that we're finally free, we can do anything we ever wanted. Both of us can.
MICHAEL
A gun?
Dean's phone rings. He looks at the screen, annoyed.
(bitterly)
Dean gets up and sits at the table, his head in his hands.
Eileen smiles.
(In confidence)
I'm sorry it took me so long to realise it.
Michael, you're still my family. Please.
Jonathan's girlfriend.
Dean--
Where's your mom and dad?
Sam, Dean, Jack, Michael and Amara stand in the middle of the street.
(then)
A coin appears between her fingers, silver and old.
Billie.
You asked earlier if my vision of Cas was real and I think it was.
For the spell to work, we need the essence of someone Jack loves.
Don't start.
So, how is Dean, really?
Chuck turns around to see Jack, eyes glowing gold.
I don't know how, Dean.
Dean stop dead in his tracks, unable to do or say anything.
CASTIEL
I'm happy for you, Dean.
His girlfriend told us he was acting strange and the security cameras showed him enter the fabric at night then the whole building collapsed on itself.
I think it's time to test that theory.
The lights start flickering around as Jack's eyes light up.
The Empty nods, amused.
I've been trying to talk to you but you prefer to drown yourself in booze than to deal with your problems.
Who summoned the Empty?
No. You can't.
(pointing at the flickering lights)
It's done, Chuck. You're done.
My niece, Wendy, is coming to visit and after everything she went through, she deserves a normal week.
JACK (cont'd)
Charlie stands up and reaches her hand out to Dean, an invisible promise between them.
The Empty drags Billie and Castiel to them.
DONNA
Chuck sends them all flying. Jack is tossed into a tree. He hits his head and passes out.
They stand together, all hugs and smiles. They're a family again, even if temporarily.
Still, Cas has to make the choice to leave.
Are you guys okay?
I don't know who else I could be.
No, kid. Nothing is worth your life. This weight shouldn't be on you.
DEAN (cont'd)
Dean turns away from Sam, hiding his face. Sam feels bad for pushing his brother too much.
CHARLIE
AMARA
DEAN (cont'd)
Amateur.
Don't worry, they're all fine.
CHUCK
I'm sorry, Dean.
This is what I can offer to the world. Fulfill what my mother and Cas believed in.
MICHAEL
Sam's phone rings. The screen lights up.
The number of supernatural related cases went down more than 70%,and get this, Garth called.
Sam returns to the scene.
DEAN (cont'd)
Alright but remember, if he chooses to stay there's nothing we can do.
You have him?
Do you have what you need?
CHUCK
Sam and Dean exchange surprised looks.
EMPTY (cont'd)
JACK (cont'd)
Dean, you've been studying these books for weeks, there's--
Dean tried to kill me first.
It was nothing. You shouldn't have died in the first place.
MICHAEL
She gets up and turns around. Sam and Dean keep their weapons aimed at her.
(then)
(to Cas)
Some consideration, at least. That’s why Lucifer was my favorite.
Their lives go on since the defeat of Chuck and Jack's rise to power. It's been so peaceful that Sam and Dean almost forget what it is to hunt monsters.
Sam and Dean start to smile.
All back to normal.
And I can make it quiet again.
Sam keeps shooting as the angels and demons try their hardest to reach them. The darkness swirls around them as the Shadow forms itself back together into the form of Meg.
You raised a child? How much did I miss?
Since I’m such a bad father, let’s see how you do without your god-given feathers.
What?
JONATHAN
KEVIN
They're not working.
Such a weird case.
Yeah and I always thought it would end bloody for me. For us.
Go to hell.
(Full of emotion)
Dean flinches at the mention. He gets to his feet and looks at them. Sam and Jack know before Dean can speak.
Besides, You're more needed here than in Heaven.
They stand in silence as we-
and now I finally have the chance to see it.
FATHER BENNETT
It's true.
CHARLIE
What you're seeing here is all that's left of the disappearance of Jonathan Prescott.
BACK TO:
The other two missing people, Alyssa Gray and Matthew Stoll. Were they also adepts of your church?
(then)
So, what do you have for us?
(in shock)
Donna, you're coming?
Michael snaps his fingers and they get transported as we--
Never.
Sam sighs at his brother's poor attempt of redirecting the conversation. It won't work this time.
CASTIEL
EMPTY
No but Jonathan was very quiet that day.
Welcome back.
But you said...
It's all blank.
Do you think I'd be here if I didn't?
WE FOLLOW JONATHAN TO AN OLD FACTORY ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN, DEACTIVATED YEARS AGO.
What thing? You're not making sense.
Michael gets up from the bench and turns around to face them.
Jack snaps his fingers, healing Sam, Dean and Michael.
CASTIEL
What did you do to me?
It's been years since they last saw him and yet, Jack still looks the same.
It does.
Children dressed as witch and vampire run through the banker with water guns, leaving trails through the halls.
(then)
For believing in me.
Jack, are you alright?
You're leaving?
I don't have to make sense. The Lord is on my side.
What other answer could it be? The monster population is shrinking considerably, leaving people safer and giving a second chance in life for this once supernatural beings. He's fixing Chuck's loopholes.
Rowena is ruling hell better than anyone ever; The cases are slim.
Until next week.
Of course. Eileen, this is Charlie, our friend.
Only very recently.
I think he helped us win.
MICHAEL
Dean? Cas?
Chuck stands and tries to walk but something stops him. He glares at Sam.
Jack, what the hell-
We did. Amara, Michael and me.
(Then)
Ever since the Shadow woke up, the angels and demons who inhabit it are in constant pain, living their regrets over and over again.
That was-- unpleasant.
Bitch.
We'll, if she follows the same patterns as the others, she'll leave soon.
Why the long faces?
Jack looks at them expecting something, an answer. Dean steps up.
No explanation, just disappeared.
Enough to know you don't need to hide. Not from me.
You know nothing-
Jack vanishes, leaving them to mourn his loss once again.
AMARA
That's right. The whole Cain-and-Abel thing. I'll kill Sam. Sam will kill me. We'll kill each other. Okay? You pick. But, first, you got to put everything back the way it was. The people, the birds, Cas.
MICHAEL
Did you really think a child can defeat me? Please.
Where's Charlie? She was supposed to be watching you two.
TOMMY
FATHER BENNETT
Well, I am real and I'm here to bring you home.
Now I get to play in God's sandbox.
I only hope it's not too late. Heaven needs our help.
Maybe we should pray to Jack.
Dean can't say anything to make her feel better. Layla just shakes her head and walks away.
CASTIEL
CHUCK
You were always there and then you were gone and it made me realize how much I needed you.
LAYLA
He's too deep inside his mind. Relieving his deepest regrets.
CHARLIE
I'm so proud of you, Sammy.
Who's this kid, by the way?
As if summoned, Cas and Dean wake up, gasping for air. Dean is the first to rise, taking Cas's hand in his. Dean stands by Castiel's side, protective.
Tough because it's kind of my job nowadays.
BLACKOUT.
Whatever, It's probably nothing.
Sam and Dean come running from the kitchen. A strange aura rises around Jack like a shield.
Told you.
You said you would rest.
You've changed, son. Only a pity it was for the worst.
Jack paces around the room, unsure. He sits on his bed and closes his eyes, trying to focus.
Hi to you too, Char.
(then)
Yeah. Thanks to us.
DANIELLE (EMPTY)
He was a good soldier.
Sam and Dean go to meet Eileen. Dean waits in the car as Sam and Eileen reunite. Dean is happy for Sam but his mind drifts to Castiel's absence.
Sam nods in silent agreement. He understands how Dean feels, now more than ever.
Can you give us her address?
It's worth a try.
That's deep, don't you think? A real page-turner.
Dean.
BLACKOUT.
I know it's a lot to ask in your condition but he'll need every bit of power we can give him.
CASTIEL
AMARA
How are you?
She said we would meet later to form a new plan after she took care of something but she never came.
(looking at Sam's kids)
Jack turns around trying to locate the source as Sam and Dean guard him, even though they know Jack doesn't need protection.
WE TRANSITION TO THE CHARACTERS WE LOST IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE. BOBBY, CHARLIE, DONNA AS WELL AS ALL THE CHARACTERS WE SAW THIS SEASON.
You told the cops he was acting strange before disappearing.
Are you okay?
(then)
CASTIEL
For once, he did me a favor taking himself out of the board.
CHARLIE
Especially with his children.
Winchesters moping around this early?
Oh, I would've know more if she was still here.
I want to go with uncle Cas.
FATHER BENNETT
So, Jack. Are you staying, at least for a little while?
Thinking like a hunter.
Dean picks up the bottles from the floor, trying to avoid Sam's judgmental stare.
Silence. Dean doesn't look at Sam, who doesn't dare to interrupt the moment.
The book shuts Michael out, refusing to open. They stare at it with crushed hope.
Billie told me about the failed plan to take down my Father. She said Jack went through trials that would transform him in a magnet for cosmic energy.
Not on me? Do you hear yourself?
Jack, Wake up!
Yes. Sorry.
Dean and Cas kneel before Jack as he opens his eyes.
(smug)
Sam guards the spell books in the drawer. Livvy comes to him and Sam picks her up.
EMPTY
She walks over to them as her face changes entirely, black goo covering all of it.
BILLIE
Trying to break a bad habit.
Didn't you notice anything weird when you talked to him?
Jack tries to use his powers but nothing happens. They all look at each other
Pixie dust.
(confused)
So, you're saying-
(looking at Michael)
EILEEN
Castiel feels the power being drained as if the Empty took the anguish of the restless and turned into fuel.
What can I say? There isn't much to do to pass the time in a dead planet.
You know?
interference from anyone.
What?
(out of breath)
I'm just
What?
No, you're not.
I guess so.
(Showing the coin)
What do you want?
I told you it was angel crap.
After everything is said and done, no harm will come to them. You have my word.
The effort could kill you.
What did they think was going to happen? They get everything.
We need to go.
What?
EMPTY
Huh. I talked to the guy's girlfriend.
CASTIEL
Chuck laughs as Jack raises his hand.
(Then)
That's not good.
I wish I could but we're still in the middle of rearranging Heaven and transitioning the wandering souls Chuck condemned.
Jonathan, where are you going?
We’ll never give you what you want.
Donna shows the video to Sam from her cellphone as Dean looks around until he finds what he's looking for.
Don't give me that talk. There's always a way. I'm proof of that.
She only told me Jack was going to need my help and that I should return to Earth only when I felt his power.
Jack enters the library.
Daddy, let me down.
I'm sorry for all the times I made you feel like you didn't matter to us because you do.
MICHAEL
BILLIE
Dean finishes his coffee mug and stands up.
You know, even with Chuck trying to control us, I thought we could make it. Jack came back to us, Eileen too and now she's gone and Cas...
CHARLIE
LAYLA
I thought I would. Being an angel is everything I've ever known,
EMPTY
And what will you do when it's over and for a miracle we're still standing?
SAM (cont'd)
Oh. I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm happy for you, little brother. If anyone deserves happiness is you.
Castiel. Fancy seeing you here.
CUT TO:
Wait!
(whispering)
He was more than that.
And why would I bring Castiel back? He's nothing but a bug in my perfect system that I had to bring back time and time again because you couldn't move on to the next story without him.
It's too early to mop around, don't you think?
The question is threatening and Cas pauses before giving an answer. He senses the success of the mission lies in his words.
Guess we were always stubborn.
As much as my Father tries, not everything revolves around you.
Dean walks in and sits opposite Sam. The coffee mug in his hands catches Sam's attention.
So, what do we do now?
Cas walks to them and stands by Dean's side.
I need you to hope too, Sam. I can't do this without you.
You really think you can pull it off?
Oh, yes. I've heard it.
CHUCK
That's the Empty talking, Cas.
We'll only know once we try. Are you ready?
I need to ask you a few questions about your boyfriend's disappearance. The woman seems lost in a way Dean can recognize very well.
CUT TO:
MICHAEL
Look, we're gonna do everything in our power to discover what happened to him.
BILLIE
Cas's face drops at the mention of Jack leaving.
You know, this could’ve ended a long time ago. You should’ve killed each other and everything would’ve been perfect.
KEVIN
LAYLA
Charlie? What are you doing here?
I shouldn't, but--
I do now. My time in the cage was enlightening. Adam taught me a lot about humanity and compassion.
Jack, now!
We're so glad you're okay, Kev. Now you get to live your life.
Amara and Michael come back into view.
You do?
Sam doesn't know what to say so he keeps it to himself as Dean looks down at their names sculpted at the table. It's missing something. Dean takes out his pocket knife and looks at Sam for a brief moment before he starts to carve. Sam observes before joining him.
Dean sits alone by the lake, watching the sun starting to set.
How are my favorite nephew and niece doing?
Not hungry? you're always hungry.
And that includes my dear angel Castiel?
A gun emerges from Jack's hand, shiny and unknown. He hands it to Sam.
Dean--
DANIELLE (EMPTY)
AS THE DAYS PASS, SAM, DEAN AND JACK ARE SHOWN IN THE BUNKER, PASSING THEIR TIME EACH IN A DIFFERENT WAY. SAM USUALLY COOKS AND CONTINUES TO RESEARCH; JACK SPENDS MOST OF HIS TIME ALONE WHILE DEAN DRINKS HIMSELF TO SLEEP.
He's a regular human again.
Me too.
KEVIN
Perhaps he gets it or not.
That's not on you.
Dean walks down the stairs and is meet by the kids.
Chuck raises up his sleeves as Sam goes to punch him. He hits him to no effect.
CUT TO:
We can what? There's nothing left, Dean. No one left to save. Everybody's gone.
I don't know. I can't sense him anywhere. Not even in the Empty.
Like I said, it's never too late.
Oh, it's getting really serious.
DEAN (cont'd)
I'm so glad you came.
You miss him.
I'm sorry, Jack. I couldn't stop it.
CUT TO:
She went out with Eileen. Said they need some girls time.
Sam nods, smiling at the news.
He's dead because of me. He traded himself over to the Empty to save me.
CASTIEL
Alright, Chuck. You win.
We have a deal.
I don't know. I never thought that far.
Of course he will. We are his family.
MICHAEL
BILLIE
She comes near Dean and touches his face, lightly.
I appreciate your selfless offer but Amara and Michael are already help enough.
Cas sits beside Dean.
FATHER BENNETT
MICHAEL
What now?
Silence fills the moment as both wonder where everything went wrong.
MICHAEL
DEAN (cont'd)
CASTIEL
Sam looks over at Dean and risks his shot.
She would've taken Jack to God knows where!
Sam and Dean walk though the familiar dark road with pained expressions, remembering everybody they used to know.
CASTIEL
Are you coming or not?
Sam is the first to stand up. He runs to Jack.
Already went.
He goes to Amara and helps her stand up.
Are you guys okay?
So how do we do it?
The park is peaceful as a cemetery would be. The only form of life is Michael, sitting in a bench observing the lake.
I think I sensed something. A presence.
Alright. No fighting but mom said if you two did it again, you'd get grounded.
CUT TO:
Michael and Jack sit across a table, silently staring at each other.
(To billie)
Ever since you left, it's like I can't breath. Not like I used to.
Tommy And Livvy cheer in unison.
Jack follows Sam's line of view.
Do you miss it, your grace?
(whispering)
DANIELLE
Had they ever interacted before?
(Exasperated)
Anything.
To be honest, it's been lonely. I thought that wiping everything would bring me peace but I feel nothing. Just more of the same -
BILLIE
Jon was here in one second and now he's gone. I've no idea what happened to him.
I should've told you before I just didn't know how.
Stay safe, Jack.
Lord Death.
DEATH
Sam and Eileen hug and kiss as Dean sits alone in the Impala.
He has a lot of faith, or had.
Where are you two? I swear if you found more fairy dust lying around-
I know I ever only had a place as long as I had my powers.
CHUCK
BLACKOUT.
Dean hugs Jack like a parent would, full of love and acceptance.
CHUCK (cont'd)
To spite Him?
DONNA
Michael regains control.
I'll never get tired of seeing Professor Sammy in action.
Do you want some?
Yes. Layla Eves.
Michael starts to pace around the edge of the lake while the boys wait for answers.
You're the one who lives with him and you're asking me if I noticed something weird while we talked on the phone?
You can't.
Dean doesn't buy it.
LIVVY
LAYLA
CHARLIE
(then)
I think I have the answer.
He's gone. He sacrificed himself a few weeks ago to save Dean.
Where do you plan to get with this, Michael?
CHUCK
DONNA
LAYLA
LIVVY
(looks away from Sam)
No- It can't be.
No. It wasn't.
Guys?
BILLIE (cont'd)
(then)
Dean closes the book he was reading with more strength than he should. Sam sighs and sits down, sipping his coffee.
AMARA
He saved us.
Did he specify?
I was in a 2011 Comic-Con wearing my best Legolas cosplay when this kid, Jack, shows up of nowhere and made me remember I was dead which wasn't nice.
Deal.
I could teach you better than last time.
And just like the rest of them, you disappoint me, Michael. I expected better of you.
From outside, Jonathan's screams can be heard as white light illuminates the factory. Seconds later, the building is engulfed in darkness, collapsing onto itself.
CHARLIE
I've already learned your tactics, he's never gonna come here. You're not real.
They launch themselves at Dean, who almost drops the phone.
Kevin?
He's- He's gone.
What the hell is going on?
CASTIEL
Michael walks over to Dean and stares down at him. Dean doesn't back down.
CHARLIE
(panting)
SAM (cont'd)
MICHAEL
The bunker door opens and the kids run to see Dean pass through.
Sam sits besides Dean.
Thanks for the second chance, by the way.
(emotional)
You didn't tell us what exactly happened.
Part of me always will but even then, I don't think he ever loved us in return. He created the world, made us resent each other and left.
Jack's eyes glow as he raises his hand, a source of light in the darkness. Castiel's voice, a memory perhaps, cuts through the distance. Dean picks on immediately.
The scene plays out far away and out of focus. Dean giving up Anna in exchange for Sam's life as Uriel and Castiel watch.
Jack touches Castiel's shoulder, smiling sadly.
MICHAEL
Alright, you guys seem exhausted. You should get some rest.
What is it, princess?
Jack looks defeated as he grips the book tight.
Holy water can't kill vampires, Livvy.
Dean sits by the table, almost covered by the pile of books in front of him. Dean is relentless on finding anything about the Empty.
CASTIEL
Good. I loved my brother but he couldn't care less about all of this. Humanity.
You were punished because you were loved by Sam and Dean. Same with Kevin.
Next thing I know, I'm here.
The Empty prepares to strike before the barn is engulfed in light so bright Sam and Dean have to cover their eyes. The light cuts through the dark and The Empty vanishes in it. The vessels fall at their feet.
CHUCK
I'm still me.
You miss him.
Can you stop fighting? It won't help anyone.
I am but... Jack.
And you did all of this?
CUT TO:
Jerk.
You sent that nephilim here and now everything is loud.
It is, Sam.
It's been hell for Dean. Even though he tries to hide, his worry over Cas' fate gnaws at him. He can't sleep, he can't think about anything else besides what Cas must be suffering because of him.
He's not a werewolf anymore.
EMPTY
I want him back as much as you want Eileen.
A star engulfed into a black hole.
(On the phone)
CHARLIE
Let me guess, Jack?
They start to leave as Chuck crawls on the ground.
When Chuck knocked me out, I thought it was over. I thought he would destroy everything because I failed to be strong enough but then I heard something and this coin was beside me.
Making a deal with the only being powerful enough to turn the tide.
MICHAEL
Which is?
Where's Eileen?
I don't trust you.
Nobody warned me that the twins knew where the pixie dust was hidden.
Dean doesn't meet their eyes. He can't.
CUT TO:
Sam, you don't need to apologize.
That applies to you too, kid.
Jonathan turns to her and smiles forcibly.
It's never too late to rectify our mistakes.
Don't you love your Father anymore?
Michael frowns at the sight of only three of them.
Thanks to you, I guess.
And what happened there?
I need to go to bed. Welcome back, Charlie.
But we're surrendering. We're giving up.
Cas told me everything, Jack and we all would've done the same thing. That's what family is for.
Donna hugs them both. It's the first time they see each other in person since Chuck's defeat.
Well I-
EMPTY
Jack fills a mug for Dean and they both drink quietly.
Somewhere safe.
Amara and Jack hold hands and close their eyes in peaceful contemplation. Suddenly, the world around them starts to get louder for the first time in days. People walk around as--
I would like that.
Death is in everything. No human like Winchester can tame such cosmic power, only scatter and distribute it.
Do not cross me, Billie. Complete your part or I'll make my eternity's mission to hunt you down and torture you.
Truth is I'm not alright and while Cas continues to be trapped in the Empty I'm never going to be.
Well, it's gonna be one hell of a story.
Tommy stops in his tracks as Livvy bombards him with water.
MICHAEL (cont'd)
Dean, you won't solve anything here and drowning yourself in research without eating or sleeping isn't going to help Cas.
You earned as much.
CHUCK
Jack pushes them out of the Empty.
CASTIEL
Since you exploded in the Empty. Billie told me.
Donna hugs them both before heading to her car. Dean notices Sam and Donna's looks but doesn't comment.
In the end, my grace served for a bigger purpose than myself.
Adam smiles. After all this time, he's starting to heal.
CUT TO:
Deal how? Like you?
This only works if Cas chooses for himself.
So...
AMARA
It was Livvy's idea.
The boys enter the vast void and are unsettled by the silence of it.
You deserve it too, Jack.
JUMP CUT TO:
Same as everyone. I just want this to be over.
CHARLIE
(then)
Jack kneels over Danielle and the others.
You lost.
I've learned from the best.
I am.
MICHAEL
CHUCK
Michael opens the book easily to the shock of Sam and Dean. Sam goes to get the book and stares in surprise at the empty pages.
Call it a miracle.
CASTIEL
Yeah. I do.
Dean's right. It's not your fault, Jack.
Sam and Dean absorb what the twins said in stunned silence.
EMPTY
In that we can agree.
Well, you know how devout people can be. He confided that the Lord or the light, like he said, had asked something of him.
EMPTY
So no, Jack. He's not much my Father anymore just like Lucifer isn't yours.
What do you mean you don't have time?
(stares at Jack)
TOMMY
But why come out of hiding now? Chuck could wipe you out at any second.
BILLIE
BILLIE
Well, it sounds like classic jealousy to me.
I think it's my turn and I thought about it a lot, you know?
Jack appears at the door, noticing the pieces of what was the door scattered across the floor. Jack sees Dean and smiles. Dean remembers what happened with Cas and his face crumbles.
Jack takes a moment to remember.
MICHAEL (cont'd)
Is that so?
What are you saying?
So, you give me no choice.
EILEEN
Chuck seems more amused than angry.
CUT TO:
Charlie and Eileen come running to them.
I'll always have him.
He said he misses you.
Maybe but It's been pretty quiet since Jack took over.
The plan changed but Jack still needs our help. And we are in the perfect spot to do it.
CASTIEL
Jack grips the book tighter as the bunker starts to shake. He screams in agony.
Sam and Dean smile.
BILLIE
JUMP CUT TO:
They were such devout people to the cause of God, it seems like a targeted attack on us.
Cas, ever since you pulled me out of hell, you've been a part of my life, my family. I never thought I deserved someone like you, someone who always came when I called, always helped even when I was wrong.
DANIELLE (EMPTY)
Castiel doesn't face Dean as he keeps denying his existence.
Chuck starts to beat them up as we ---
CASTIEL
You better. I'm just passing by but this sounds like your kind of case.
CHUCK (cont'd)
Well, you did try to kill Dean and me so forgive me of I'm a little distrustful.
Michael's eyes glow and just like that, Adam is in control.
What the hell is going on?
Thank you.
The light's in room go out with the wave of power but Jack knows it didn't work. Cas continues to be lost to him.
I can't promise you we will succeed, Dean.
Burying myself in useless books and pretending that our friends didn't disappear with the rest of the world because we were stubborn enough to want something for ourselves?
CHARLIE
Wait, you meet Billie?
Sam acts first, hugging Jack tightly.
Oh, I know. I finally learned that if you want something done right, do it yourself.
Dean smiles. Sam hugs him.
BILLIE
BILLIE (cont'd)
MICHAEL
You don't get it, do you? The person I love most in the world vanished and I have no idea what happened to him.
Dean waits as Cas makes the decision, every ill conceived thought of being rejected running through his mind as the seconds seems to stretch forever.
DANIELLE (EMPTY) (cont'd)
(then)
(then)
UNKNOWN
It's our chance, Dean.
Maybe I can send one of you inside his mind to wake him up.
Grateful. I always knew you would do great things, Jack
Angels and gods have the power to bend time but the Man of Letters discovered the ultimate spell: how to use the power of your own soul to travel.
What's with the sigils?
Your beloved humans will be safe.
Dean, you're acting like dad.
She has nothing.
Now we visit an old friend.
It's been off because you can't control it. It's too much for you.
Billie-
I've had this continuation of Supernatural in my head since I watched the writers and network burn 15 years worth of character development with their last episode.
That's why you're possessing vessels?
CHARLIE
Jack wakes up to the sound of broken bones and agony. He blames himself as he tries to get up but notices Chuck has paralyzed him in that position.
Dean is surprised by this memory choice. He looks around and sees Cas, the real one, watching the scene over and over again, trapped in invisible chains in the corner. Dean runs to him.
He really was attached to you, wasn't he?
Guys, is everything okay?
Yeah but that would require Jack do die so we call it off.
CHUCK
(to Billie)
(screaming through empty halls)
Sam, Dean and the kids walk to Dean's new house. They open the gates and are surprised by their friends and family waiting for them. They shout "SURPRISE" leaving Dean is stunned.
Michael turns to face his father one last time.
You helped me understand I deserved to live and you deserve it too.
Dean wakes up in a barn, very similar to the one he and Sam were in minutes ago but something is different, he recognizes this one from a very long time ago.
The Lord?
TOMMY
Forget what I said. I was wrong, Jack. You don't have to sacrifice yourself for us, that's not on you.
I'm very fond of a friend of yours.
So, where does this leave us? We need that book open, and we're out of options.
Cas is dead because of me.
CUT TO:
You sleeping forever, no more
I guess it worked.
CHUCK
Every day.
How is that possible?
That can't be right. Someone doesn't just disappear from the universe.
BILLIE
CHUCK
Is it really you?
Dean puts the call in voice speaker.
I'm just thinking about Jack.
Welcome home, Jack.
How are you, kid?
KEVIN
She appears behind him, still holding her scythe as if nothing had happened.
But it didn't feel like it used to. It felt like I was -
(then)
I'm sorry.
Layla Eves?
What?
It's been a long time.
Ask some questions.
As Sam and Michael devise a plan. Dean follows Jack into the kitchen.
Dean reaches out his hand to Castiel.
I assumed you'd need my help with Heaven and everything else.
(conflicted)
Jack…
You again.
There are a number of ways to time travel and I personally experienced different kinds of it.
I'm afraid we need to cause more pain.
I'm not sure I can explain.
I see. And how do you plan to escape my domain?
Billie goes to Death and they lock hands, disappearing from the Empty.
Dean looks gutted with emotion. He nods and walks away.
MICHAEL
As scriptwriter student and fan of SPN, it hurt me deep to see the end result so I took the plot threads and continued them to their logical conclusion (with a little more fluff bc way not?)
MICHAEL
CHARLIE
Not today.
Rotting away with nothing but each other, everybody you've ever loved lost forever and you can't do nothing about it.
BLACKOUT.
Winchesters, I've been waiting for you.
CASTIEL
Sam and Eileen watch as Dean and Cas drive away. Sam holds Eileen's hand and they smile at each other.
It's been happening a lot, lately.
We can't just give up.
Thank you. I know it's not much but I make Amara's words about Jack my own and Michael's if it eases your concerns a little.
Dean turns around. Jack resembles Cas so much is almost unbearable to look at him.
Yeah, he talked to us one night.
If I was the one dead for five years I'd like to leave this cave once in a while too.
MICHAEL
Don't be too hard on yourself, Jack.
Sam smiles, shyly. Eileen points to the pack of beer in her hands.
I tell her everything.
I intend to keep it.
MICHAEL
(Then)
LIVVY AND TOMMY
BLACKOUT.
Livvy laughs as Tommy mops around in true Winchester fashion. Dean ruffles his hair.
Hold on to me and think about Cas. I'll try to track him.
Sam, Dean and Castiel fall to the floor as the portal closes. The sigils on the walls burned out.
He loved me and that's what got him killed.
CASTIEL
MICHAEL
Did you find any case?
BLACKOUT.
Michael coughs blood as Chuck watches in terrifying peace.
Castiel.
And were they ever together here?
Sam, Cas is trapped in some other dimension, suffering God knows how much because of me. I can't just forget about him and go on with my
You went to hell? Alone?
MICHAEL
I can. And I'll enjoy every second of misery that the two of you and your lapdog Jack spend on this lifeless planet, knowing it's this way because you wouldn't take a knee.
A child with the potential to save or destroy us all.
Look, I thought I was doing the right thing but I see now that Chuck was the one pulling the strings all alone.
That's not true.
DEATH
It doesn't even seem like the same town.
CASTIEL
MICHAEL
MICHAEL (cont'd)
What do you want with all of this?
Sam backs away to answer. Dean is visibly happy for his brother, then, remembers what he needs.
Sam! Dean's here!
It'll be good for you to get some air.
DEAN (cont'd)
That's an easy request.
Sure.
(then)
DEAN (cont'd)
CASTIEL
What?
Nobody answers as Michael figures it out for himself.
What do you remember?
(in denial)
Sam nods as he points the gun and shoots.
Snap out of it, your dumbass. I'm real and I'm here.
CHUCK (cont'd)
We're here to talk about the recent disappearances in the local area.
The toddler? Well, he sent the angel in this vessel to lock me up or try to.
CASTIEL
(then)
MICHAEL
Remember the times when we used to hunt? Always motivated by vengeance and anger and the weight of the whole world on our shoulders.
Actually, Cas is their favorite uncle.
He didn't seem like himself at all ever since he came back from the church.
CASTIEL
I wish I could help.
What do you mean, my powers? They've been weird since-
Castiel touches the coin and all his power goes into it. He flinches, feeling drained.
BACK TO:
EMPTY
I'm not asking for your trust. I'm asking you to help defeat God. A being who couldn't care less about any of us.
Cas was really odd all week but he helped us.
Simple essence glamour and paralyzing spell. Turns out we can still surprise you.
And what can guarantee me you won't try to be God again?
Death has many resources. Even here.
DONNA
Angels and demons fall at their feet, disappearing in the darkness. Sam aims the gun at it but the Empty takes it and breaks into pieces.
MICHAEL
I promised I would help.
CHARLIE
EMPTY (cont'd)
CASTIEL
In the end, we were all just toys to you, passing inconveniences that you break and get over it.
Jack smiles.
That 's crazy. How--
Chuck agrees.
Alright lovebirds, I don't want to interrupt but I need my beauty sleep so don't bother me for the next 48 hours.
Sam and Jack race through the stairs of the bunker, tired and worried. Sam keeps dialing Dean's number as he and Jack walk through the halls, trying to find them.
What happened? Where's Cas?
CASTIEL
You're not the only one who lost people!
Michael, did Billie tell you anything more?
I read the books, Dean. It's hard not to see it.
You have to bring Cas back.
We care about you, not what you can do for us.
Thank you.
I don't belong out there.
Nice to meet you, Eileen. I promise to tell you every embarrassing thing Sam has ever done in my presence which is a lot.
Sam and Dean buckling Tommy and Livvy to their seats at the back of the Impala.
Dean laughs and hugs Cas.
SAM (cont'd)
Yeah. I know.
(Relieved with the silence)
I wondered when you would find me.
They approach the crime scene, an abandoned factory that seemed to have collapsed in itself, leaving rubble everywhere.
JACK (cont'd)
DEATH
I knew I sensed you. Even trapped, you were with me.
Jack sits beside them in silence. Sam closes his book.
Claire, Cas and I talked with Jodie and we all agree that you should apply.
I hope you enjoy the rest of your miserable existence, Chuck. You can be sure I will.
We don't have time.
Start what, Dean? Worrying about you?
Michael, maybe?
That's not who I am. I never was, no matter how much you tried.
You have a very skewed view on family.
Well, my Father isn't known to be forgiving.
MICHAEL
Charlie shows up, hair sticking to every direction possible. As soon as she sees Dean, she sighs in relief.
Because of him.
What about Cas?
Since then, my powers have been off.
A luck spell.
Dean examines the coin
DONNA
I was angry and blind and I unleashed all on you. You are a part of this family and you always will be.
Maybe we will expand to all of North America in the next few years.
Cas? Did you guys hear that? He's gotta be near.
You may have started everything but our lives are ours and now you're going to live like everyone you forgot about.
MICHAEL
Jack. Hey...
Just like the rest of us.
Making up his mind, Castiel follows Billie as we-
I'll keep looking but I need you to keep the faith and look for him too.
Sorry, it's Adam.
I don't know.
Jack.
DEAN (cont'd)
Dean points at the woman clearly in shock talking to cops not far away from where they stand.
Do you feel better?
You're not going with him?
What the hell was that?
Did Jack sent you?
He's just been odd all week.
Yeah and it's been weeks. I can't just sit around and do nothing.
SAM (cont'd)
CASTIEL
You brought this to yourself.
That hurts my feelings.
He leaves, leaving them speechless.
MICHAEL
Amara smiles.
Sam, Dean and Eileen walk down the stars, carrying her bags.
There's still hope that we could do something to help him but... I'm worried.
Even here, I can feel his suffering.
Billie and Cas turn around to face the original incarnation of Death.
Sam and Eileen stand near the entrance door as Dean and Cas finish packing up. Dean approaches Sam. Eileen backs off so they can have privacy.
After everything I did, I don't deserve it.
He was taken by the Empty to save me. Billie wanted to kill me and Cas...
Yeah, it's just college and the world won't get more peaceful than this.
Maybe, you will.
SAM (cont'd)
The boys smile at the crowded street as Michael winces in agony. His eyes glow blue.
Charlie sits besides him.
Michael and Dean back off.
CUT TO:
Dean goes to leave but Jack calls out to him.
It'll be better.
Great, actually. Hunters from the whole country are seeking our knowledge.
We'll have to trust one another if we want Jack to succeed.
JACK (cont'd)
EMPTY
It's good to see you, son. Where's the book?
You'll never hurt anyone ever again. Not like you used to.
The power, the fame, a new Haven and nothing for me.
Of course I knew. I'm Death.
Ok. That's enough.
Chuck waits for the blow but nothing happens.
We will miss you, Jack.
Jack looks at Dean.
TOMMY
Live your lives. Live it the way you want it.
But that's a subject for next time where you'll learn how to perform the spell in a short space of time.
You know he belongs here, don't you?
(impatient)
MICHAEL
BILLIE
Jack gets up slowly with the help of Sam and Cas.
CASTIEL
Eileen, Charlie, Claire and Cas walk to them.
MICHAEL
CUT TO:
Chuck disappears, leaving Sam and Dean alone and defeated as we-
Charlie, this is Eileen, my girlfriend.
His girlfriend told us he was an adept of your church.
Castiel nods in understanding. They approach the table. Dean visibly tenses.
Do you really think we wouldn't do a housewarming party?
Thirty years old. No drug issues, no police background, nothing.
I died but then I was remade like nothing had happened.
I don't know. I want to believe so but what good would be to know he's out there somewhere and I can't do anything to help him?
SAM (cont'd)
CASTIEL
I feel more human than I've ever felt.
That's not what I'm trying to say.
He's here!
It messed him up.
Everybody disappeared.
Oh God, I should've stopped him.
Never thought I'd see the day where you'd ever admit that.
Thanks, guys. Maybe I'll go visit y'all sometime. See ya.
In mere seconds, the empty starts to get crowded, angels and demons circling them as if they can sense Jack's power.
Chuck scrunches his eyes at Michael, trying to see something but unable to, somehow.
All the power you can gather.
We'll give you what you want.
Stand down, Angel. I'm not here to rip your skin off, albeit you deserve it.
(screaming)
It says only Death can read it but maybe an Archangel's power can open it.
MICHAEL
Dean seems distressed by the idea of Jack leaving.
Where's Cas, by the way? I miss that nerd.
Sam, we can-
EMPTY
Gone how? Like the rest of the world?
Well, that's specific.
Because he loved me!
Michael prepares and puts all his angelical power into opening the book. The sheer amount of power coming from Michael draws Jack in, making him dizzy.
CUT TO:
Yeah, but-
You're impossible.
Twisted arms, broken angles, bloody faces and still Sam and Dean get up. They'll never stop fighting and Chuck doesn't understand this. Over and over and over again, Sam and Dean stand up. Chuck seems shaken at their defiance.
It will be but until it's ready, we won't see each other.
He would've liked to finally come back here.
Michael nods. Sam goes to the shelf and picks up God's book.
Michael?
Michael steps closer, holding the book.
Is that why you left, then? To run away?
CHARLIE
Goodbye.
There's gotta be something we can do.
CUT TO:
In my defense, He sent them after me
Are we going to see uncle Cas, uncle Dean?
They were, so you can understand how this worries me.
You still didn't tell me the plan.
No, but--
Oh, you do.
Existence.
I don't know, man. Chuck lost, Jack's God even though he's 3 and Cas...
Me neither.
Jack?
It seems beautiful.
Dean side eyes Sam, knowing what he's doing.
Do you think it was real?
Jack is a child.
I hope it's not too long.
(desperate)
His surprised tone shuts everyone up.
Castiel stands, visibly in pain and assumes a defensive stance.
I see.
If is Chuck messing with us...
BILLIE
Sam sees his brother is upset and directs the conversation elsewhere.
(then)
Jack is doing what he said he would. He's fixing Chuck's wrongdoings.
Jack reaches for the book and looks at it, wistfully.
Ouch.
It's like the universe threw one last cosmic joke at us for old times sake.
Needed how?
If you still want. Maybe we could go fishing.
Sam closes the book, rather loud, no longer trying to hide his pain and anger.
I'll miss you too.
Don't you?
CUT TO:
Do you think it's a good idea to just wait?
It's all over, Kev. You're free, we all are.
Tommy And Livvy come running, gaining their attention.
What's happening?
You don't need to indulge me, Dean.
I couldn't save anybody.
I tried, you know, to bring him back right after you told me. I hoped it would be like last time but nothing happened.
They finish the task. Sam raises his beer bottle.
We were going to marry in three months and now he's gone.
Screams break through the dark space as something starts to rebuild itself.
To family.
Donna and Sam share a knowing look as Dean approaches.
Chuck is sent flying to the shore by Jack. Dean and Michael trail behind him as Sam reveals himself to be the Michael talking to Chuck, the spell dissipating in the air.
Sam puts down his mug, untouched.
Is there more to say?
Sam walks through the classroom as the students, mainly hunters, pay attention to every word he says.
Much better.
Nice house, old man.
Kill me.
The lights flicker around Sam and Dean as they continue their research, too many books scattered across the table.
CASTIEL
With a snap of fingers, Jack transports them through the vast unknown. Cas lays on the ground, sleeping. Dean runs and kneels beside him, touching his face.
Ever since Cas woke the Shadow, it became a problem and the only way to weaken the Shadow is to get it away from it's domain so....
Alright.
Sam and Dean sit around the map table while Cas and Jack can be seem at the library in the background. Dean can't stop staring at Cas' back. Sam seems amused by it.
Sam and Dean get up as Chuck walks over to them.
DANIELLE
What other choice do we have?
They walk out of the classroom and into the hall. Each brother carrying a child.
LIVVY
Well, he never meant anything to me. My family is here.
YOU! YOU DID THIS.
I'll assist Jack in everything. You have my word, Dean.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. An eternity of suffering in the Empty just to save you.
She 's my wife.
Sam and Dean do as they are told and suddenly the screams stop as if Jack is protecting them.
Funny how things work out. Looks like luck is on our side.
CUT TO:
That death was the only path I had since I walked into this life but we fought against Chuck and we won. We're free and now I don't know what that future could even look like for me.
AMARA
A job to do.
My angels already left.
LIVVY
(uncontained emotion)
Charlie looks confused as well.
You made it loud again.
Sam, Dean and Jack stop behind him.
He can't hear you. His powers are awakening.
CHUCK
No point in not trying, right?
CHARLIE
Jack smiles at his family, knowing his new role is a heavy one but one he must endure, at least for a while.
What happened to your hair?
But I'm a witch so I can make any potion I want.
Jack, he's kind like our kid. We raised him.
It's Rowena. She was glad to have some company.
I never had the time or will to visit a place like this but Adam always spoke of it with such longing.
She turns to Castiel and extends her hand where the coin lies.
JACK (cont'd)
But that's not how it's supposed to end. My book-
Sam comes in, holding two mugs of coffee. He slides one to Dean who doesn't even notice.
“Perhaps,” Castiel finds himself replying, “Unless taxes are raised, in which case the lower income will unbalance the scales once again.”
Were it not for the furious need to rectify his abhorrent blunder, the prince would pray for a slow end. Paper rots and goes stale, swirling off of him.
“I have never seen something more enchanting,” he says quietly, affectionately. “I could sit and catalogue each and every one of them for hours on end, shall you ever allow me.”
“I will personally tell him he is not allowed to touch any of the items I give you,” the prince says, hands flying to grab the sides of the fur coat, stopping Dior from taking it off completely. “Surely he will not upset a customer that has gone out of their way?”
There is apprehension bubbling from the omega and Castiel is quick to intertwine his index finger with Dior’s little finger in an effort to coax his scent blanket in providing assurance.
, his mother had admonished him, after another failed courting. It was not her words that cut so deep, but the look in her eyes. His mother had looked
How had he never realised the ocean is described as burning amber at sunset?
Jesse’s smile turns into a blinding grin, ”Thank you - we are lucky to have each other.”
. The prince is passed a folded square of grey fabric before he heads back to the omega.
- discussion of pregnancy termination
“I n-need it to stop,” he repeats, burrowing his nose straight into Cas’ neck, searching for his alpha’s scent gland. The omega finds it easily, calling to him like a siren.
If Castiel thinks that is an odd choice of words to describe how much marriage means to a person, he does not mention it. Jesse falls into a heavy, but not awkward, silence and Cas allows him to ruminate over whatever thoughts he wishes. He is happy to bask in the lull of their conversation and keeps his ears attentive to the soft sounds he can slightly identify as Dior’s voice traveling to the room - letting it soothe both his own and his wolf’s nerves.
it should hurt more. Dior should be in a shit load of pain right now, instead of this paltry stinging sensation but even this - even
Dean turns his head to him, eyes soft. “But maybe everything’s for you, too?”
So no, he can’t lie to her. As much as he fucking wants to.
. Like bleakness and hopelessness.
“Balthazar! Goodness, reign in your cheekiness, please,” Castiel groaned, heading to sit in one of the armchairs near the fireplace. “You cannot speak such thoughts out loud. What if anybody hears you?”
Castiel was not aware that the purchasing of garbs usually demanded a written contract on top of a receipt of purchase - it seems an excessive measure for some garments.
It is a new feeling; both scary and exhilarating. It feels like he could both die or grow into something different. The short, wispy roots in-between his ribs elongate and wrap around each vertebra further, fracturing bone and imprinting themselves forever.
Dior takes a few steps towards the street at the end of the alleyway, feeling off-kilter.
“Very fitting and expected,” Balt says, starting to tug at a bud.
They were halfway through their mains when Cain opened a surprising topic. “Next week, I will be holding a soirée at my estate.”
When his door opens without a single knock, he’s half laying on his sofa, body sinking into the cushions after a seemingly never-ending stream of clients. A tall, cloaked figure steps in, heels clicking loudly.
“She’s just ticked off that Dior’s highest-earning again this month. Sore loser, is what she is,” one of the girls comments, not without vitriol. Dior coughs and continues eating.
“It sounds like you and your mother are very close - that is a beautiful thing, Castiel,” Dior offers, bowing his head to get into Castiel’s line of sight, obscuring the view of another of his faults.
“I don’t know, Cassie… If I was to make regular plans to see a person of a different presentation, such as, say, two times in a week - someone might be inclined to consider that I, at the very least, am showing
The omega wants to laugh. Of course he’s forgetting a shit tonne of stuff. He can’t remember anything beyond wet steps, hurried French and black robes.
“Chrissie, shut
“Yes,” Dior answers matter-of-factly and not missing a beat.
“Shhh, I have you, I have you, I have you,” a voice whispers against his ears.
Dior felt smothered between the two alphas and Uriel’s gaze - which looked ready to take a red tinge at this display. He wanted to say something, anything, but the pheromones the three of them were throwing around made him stay quiet, the inner wolf instructing him this was a power display and he needed to
Primary genders: alpha/beta/omega
just there.
, he thought. But just as he was about to open his mouth and try to rectify the situation, the alpha started speaking again.
But he’d be lying.
“I-I don’t suppose I can counteract that but - but I am, at the very least, n-not hypothermic,” Dior attempts to convince the alpha once again.
“Does Crowley not pay you enough? You are not allowed to be out after dark, are you? Is he aware of you doing this?” the prince asks. With every question, he comes closer until his shins are right against the bed and Dior needs to crane his neck up uncomfortably in order to see his face.
He thought about him as the night went on. He imagined his beautiful smile and kind eyes as patrons continued to poke and prod him. He recounted the way he smelled, the way it took a moldy tinge when distressed.
His body slides sideways, settling in a messy fetal position that is more uncomfortable than not.
“I would like to call you a liar, Castiel. But your scent makes it impossible to do so,” the omega says, backing away three steps, eyes never leaving him, scarf bundled in a fist and hanging along the line of his thigh. The alpha feels bare under his scrutiny.
Expectation and elatedness of a degree Castiel was not aware he was capable of surge through his whole being and he, quite literally, starts shivering in anticipation.
He wants to say something. God, he wants to rip this alpha’s fucking head off. The guy has the audacity to smirk, fully aware of what he’s said and what effect this must have on Dior. He can smell the way his scent turns burnt, snow melting into something ugly.
“Sure thing, Castiel. Just show me what to do.” Dean replies, not hesitating in unzipping the bag.
He doesn’t bother covering himself and makes a bee-line for the woman, wrapping his arms around her shoulders and cradling her head in his neck, aiming for his scent gland. He doesn’t ask anything and Lisa doesn’t offer him any words, just soft shaking of her shoulders and small, sharp intakes of breath as she takes in his scent, attempting to calm down.
When his door opens again, he goes rigid.
“Well, regardless of the barbaric reason for the scentless servants, I must say it does leave room for appreciation of the gorgeous cinnamon smell in the room,” Castiel said.
His eyes are wide open, flicking around his room from where he’s settling for whatever is planned for him. There’s a twitch he thinks might be the tip of his fingers over his knee but Dior doesn’t know where his knee is anymore. Was it connected to his thigh or to his tibia? Both?
He’s lost in thought when the beta comes to fetch him, “
He’s kneeling on the floor and grasping at his hair, trying to smother the pain, to
, had plagued his dreams and waking hours constantly, hope flaring and growing roots in his chest - brightly at first, only to dwindle as time went by.
“That is a ridiculous notion. I am besotted with yours,” Cas says truthfully, now mapping the star chart of the flecks along his cheeks and nose with the same passion and desperation an astronomer might upon the discovery of a new star.
“At the very least your skin is back to normal. Are you still lethargic?”
Dior talks then, and his scent has shifted, it just renders Castiel nostalgic as one might get when speaking of times-past - so he keeps from worrying.
Aiden makes a slight purring noise and leans into Dior, making his hand fall at the back of his neck instead, slowly massaging it. “Thank you. You’re the best, Dior.”
It takes less time than what Castiel had hoped for his friend to catch up to him.
The betas exchange glances before both of their attention falls back onto the couple in front of them. Neither Dior nor Cas is concerned with the silent conversation the two are having.
There’s a gagging noise coming from someone who sounds suspiciously like Chrissie, followed by a sharp slapping noise and a hiss. Dior chuckles with his mouth full but doesn’t look towards the culprits.
“Oh yes, definitely.” he says instead, looking around their surroundings. “We can keep going if you don’t mind pushing the stroller?”
Filled with a sudden bravado, he started flirting with the alpha, going as far as snaking his arm through his. He did not feel any remorse at that, it had felt right. It had felt better than anything was supposed to in his shitty life. That emotion tugged and prodded at his heart, intoxicating him more than any alcohol or opiate ever could. He knew the alpha wasn’t on his way to the private parlour, seeing as he was heading in the opposite direction, but Dior was desperate to not allow him out of his sight. Resorting to a bit of manipulation seemed the right thing to do at that moment, seeing how the alpha had played along regardless.
“That’s right, it's me,” the low baritone of his alpha’s voice soothing him, one hand stroking his hair, the other one peeling off the offensive red silk.
“Does this suit your tastes, your Highness? I have chosen a matching, single-breasted navy waistcoat and trousers, paired with a white dress shirt. Brown and navy oxfords and a navy, narrow cravat. I have not chosen a frock as I am aware you are impartial to your beige coat.” Alfie informed him, carefully setting down some suspenders and a pair of gloves.
“Truly?” the prince asks, heart skipping every other beat, as if a steady rhythm is not vital to his well being.
Finally.
It’s like a slap across his face because Dior is the furthest thing from it. He’s barely doing anything. He promised Lisa he’d be there for her and not even a week down the line he’s failing her.
Both alphas and omegas are capable of scent blanketing/marking, betas are unable to since they do not possess scent glands, but are able of BEING scent blanketed/marked superficially through their skin (lasts barely any time at all). Omegas scent marking anyone but their children is seen as ‘not knowing their place’ and can have repercussions. However, having an omega scent blanket you is perceived as proof of someone’s ‘prowess in subduing an omega’.
Upon reaching the bottom floor, there are only two people in the foyer - Crowley and Ruby. They seem to be in a heated argument, Ruby’s face contorted in anger and Crowley looking as unimpressed as ever.
" he finished, winking at Castiel.
God, he must be more exhausted than he thought if his mattress feels this damn good. There is the clicking of a clock that lulls him slowly back to sleep.
Chapter notes:
“I still do. We were true mates. This type of loss never leaves you and it doesn’t get better with time, either. Most of the time I feel like I’m just wasting away more and more each day I am without her.” Cain said.
“Gabriel makes sure to dispel the tension on a regular basis,” he laughs, thinking of the golden-eyed beta. “I believe his nickname amongst the staff in our palace is ‘
He suddenly could not be in the room anymore. The only thing keeping him from running away was the cinnamon aroma still wafting around him. Castiel finished his third drink and quickly excused himself for some fresh air, not waiting enough to see the concerned look Balt had thrown his way.
” He sounds unsure, the last word caught between making it sound like fact and question both.
, she had written. A sentence Castiel had started hearing early into puberty and has come to haunt every conversation he holds with his mother. Her Majesty has the best intentions, of course, but it only brings disquiet to the prince’s heart. The overwhelming fact that he turned out to be a disappointment does push him to do his best, although it pricks at his pride and heart every time he is reminded of it.

Suddenly, there is a thumb on each of his wrists, leaving footprints of a waltz into his skin. Dior starts leaning forward, his eyelids drooping and breath slowing, whereas Cas feels like his own has stopped altogether.
“I have no idea why
Castiel straightens his back, adjusts his coat - not his usual one so he does feel a bit naked - and his beret then starts making his way to the entry queue. His hands shook slightly as he handed over the entry fee to the guard. The inside took his breath away immediately. If he had thought the outside was beautiful, it was nothing compared to the inside. And it was all Castiel’s to explore on his own for the next few hours.
