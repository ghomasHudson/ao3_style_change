"And none of us are looking to sell," Tony said easily. "Steve, this is Miranda, our utterly divine chef. She doesn't admit to a surname. Miranda, my guest is Captain Steve Rogers."
"My wait staff will be falling over themselves to serve the two of you. Now, come this way.”
"I am quite certain that that would not be a memory I would wish to keep," Jarvis said dryly. "Meanwhile, I have instructions from Ms Potts to put you through to her the instant you call in."
"Hank?" Tony frowned at her.
For some reason it appeared that this was not welcome news. Tony looked dismayed. "Do you also remember using Hawkeye's real name to Pepper?" he demanded.
He rode it. "Ms Potts was doing an excellent job as CEO, as you can see from the figures. Are we all agreed on that? Yes? Well, I want to see if the company can come to an accommodation with her. So I'm asking for time for negotiations to take place."
"Does he talk a lot?"
"Would that matter?"
"Will we be in time?" he asked Okoye.
Tony was beginning to believe that any Hatut Zeraze left had managed to escape Wakanda; which was just as well, as only his repulsor-based weapons were usable, the rest being out of ammo. If he couldn't find any more targets he might even have to return to the city or the research centre, and right now he just wanted to keep shooting things.
Something else that was familiar enough for him to name, though if he had really been Captain America – or Steve Rogers – he should not have been.
Tony nodded. "Very recently. The Wakandans have – I was going to say 'been in contact' – but it was more of an interrogation, and they have also tried to compromise my computer systems. Being able to put a name to them is more recent."
In New York, Clint and Hank were preparing both the Tower and the old Stark Mansion for an influx of displaced citizens if the hurricane reached them. Natasha had spoken privately to Maria Hill, whom she trusted, apprising her of Thor's attempt to turn Sandro. Hill would convey that message, equally privately, to Fury.
"As a consultant. Technical consultant. Same as Dad did. And with the helicarrier at the bottom of the Sound I can't be held to repair or upgrade it."
He woke sweating, his heart pounding behind the arc reactor, his thoughts catching at the remnants of the fleeing dream, but all that was left was fear.
Was he being judged?
"Jarvis!" Tony yelled, as rain hissed down in waves across the natural amphitheatre, bouncing from stone and skin. "Watch out!"
Though he had only controlled his own reaction with the greatest difficulty, Tony applauded, gauntlets ringing against each other. "You're jumpy, Mr Grumpy."
In the workshop, the dedicated bots were just finishing stripping Tony of the armour while Steve tapped in the access code and Jarvis let him through the security wall.
"She's still alive, according to SHIELD. I could contact her, I suppose, but I don't think that's fair to her. If she's seen Captain America on TV she probably thinks I'm a substitute and hates me for it."
Until they'd learned trust and respect in the wrecked innards of a helicarrier engine, and then sympathy in shared grief for a friend. In that latter intimacy, he had become 'Tony' to Cap...
"Nope, your landlord."
Tony opened the faceplate in response so that Rhodes couldn't mistake his sincerity. "Captain America accepts he's really Thor and he's as much of a believer as you are, Rhodey, perhaps even more so."
Tony was well aware of that, but Jan had been taking too many chances recently – and she was completely untrained.
Steve grinned at that. The feeling that there was a lot more to Happy Hogan than there appeared on the surface was growing stronger all the time.
"Uhuh. I'm afraid I can't waste the energy for more than that, and you can't waste the time."
came the immediate response.
Steve glanced at Tony, a smile on his lips, before answering. "You're wrong, Natasha. Tony was there both times I met Agent Carter; he needs no other motive."
Steve gave her a quelling look, even as Danvers' eyes snapped towards her. "Who the hell are you, anyway, Annie Oakley?" the pilot demanded.
Howard held out his hand. His grip was firm with no attempt to dominate. "Welcome home, Steve."
"A demon," Clea said. "An ancient nightmare. Eater of souls."
"Troop carriers," Tony said. "You know, Colonel, you're the first person who has bothered to ask for my help and you've put forward a decent idea of your own. Once I figure out the detail and get it built, you'll be the first to know."
Thor did not answer the question. He said, instead, "Steven needs to be with his friends, and I am bound by my sworn word to take him back to Midgard. Odin would have him imprisoned here, a punishment he does not deserve."
Steve scrabbled on hands and knees over to Tony's side. His skin was cool under Steve's fingers but not cold.
Ignoring the attempt at banter, the other man said, urgently, "They're all concentrating on you."
"Partly." Howard gave an exaggerated sigh. "Didn't work."
"Our next job." Okoye gave a small, dangerous smile. "Let's go and clear out the hyenas' lair."
With Sam, it had been more like being back with the Howlers than with the Avengers where, even though Tony called him the boss, everyone was more than likely to do their own thing rather than follow his orders, even in the field...
"But you'll accept it from soup kitchens, apparently. Steve, I will not let you starve yourself to death. Please, please stay for a while. And at least talk to Vision, even if you won't listen to me."
He put down the cup and said, "Jarvis, you have my permission to speak."
Opening the gates would draw attention.
"Sir," Jarvis interrupted, "radar reveals a contact heading straight for the tower, level with the helipad."
"And it seemed to complete the parallel," Tony continued. "You know, between you and me. We'd both been remade into superheroes and both sort of died and Rhodey hadn't given up on me and Dad never gave up on you. You'd flown that abomination of a plane straight down into the Arctic Ocean, saving New York and God knows how many other cities, all alone, knowing you were going to die – and right then I was flying towards my death too, and not exactly alone because, well, I had JARVIS, but I'm not sure he counts..." He lifted his eyes to meet Steve's. "Did you have problems figuring out what to say to your girlfriend? While dying heroically, I mean." He pulled a face. "I can't believe you had the nerve to date Margaret Carter, though from her wartime photos, I can hardly blame you for trying. Boy, was she
(See the end of the chapter for
Even as Steve turned the chair on its base so he could see Tony's face, the Iron Man faceplate descended, so that his eyes did not meet the familiar warm brown gaze but the enigmatic glowing slits of the armour. Nevertheless, he was certain that the other man was thinking exactly the same thought.
"You really don't want to know, Pep. Really. Sealed lips, huh?" He leaned across the desk and kissed her soundly.
"You're tough on motorbikes, Captain," he observed, though his eyes did not move from the road.
"It's designed to affect you, you idiot!" His voice echoed round the building. "Fuck it, speakers off, for God's sake. Jarvis, I need to get downstairs."
"Wait!" Tony didn't want to test whether the armour would stand up to super-soldier strength. It would be a pain to get the dents out without the facilities of the armoury. He ordered the armour to retract not just the faceplate but the whole of the helmet.
"You sure your Dad's backing you?" Rhodey sounded sceptical.
Tony sighed. "A week ago I was sure you were dead. Since you've gotten back you've come damn near to dying twice. I know you can't resist someone in need, but please, babe, for the sake of my nerves, wait until you're fully recovered before you start pushing it. Though I could make you a suit of armour—"
Danvers exchanged glances with Steve. "This situation wouldn't involve a certain Lieutenant Storm, would it? Over."
?' Genius or madman? You decide.'"
"Got your uniform, too, when you need it."
"Maybe," Jan said. "Maybe not."
The President shrugged. "She's legally an adult and she's learned how to shed her security whenever she feels like it. Normally, she tries not to worry me, but she won't follow orders when they’re relayed by certain key members of my staff."
Tony gritted his teeth and accelerated, hoping to keep in touch with Steve, who was hurdling fallen logs as if he was in an athletics steeplechase. Ahead the land dipped towards the lake, and then both of them were scrambling on scree and years of accumulated needles, using the trees as brakes and handholds.
"Through our security system, traffic cameras, and satellites, yes, sir."
Steve was laughing as he came into his arms. "Idiot. Gorgeous idiot, though."
Ignoring him, Steve opened the locker. The internal light revealed two double-recurve bows and clusters of arrows, sorted into purpose made-containers by colour of their fletching. "Do these arrows explode on contact too?" he asked.
"I tried," Velasco said, with a wry grimace. "But since they backed the wrong horse with Hammer they're smarting so much they don't want anything to do with Stark Industries, even just paying for patent rights. And there's stuff that ain't in the patents. Isn't there?"
Tony exchanged a helpless glance with Jan, who said, "Betty, that wasn't Bruce."
However, he was just pleasantly buzzed when she appeared at his elbow, her glare dislodging the half dozen field agents (and boy, did Fury pick 'em for their looks or what?) who had been listening to him with gratifying attention. The hand gripping his arm tightened alarmingly when he resisted her pull towards the door. Next, no doubt, it would be the stiletto on his foot, though why she thought crippling him would make him walk faster defied normal logic...
"That's not poss—" Pepper was cut off as Tony switched from her cheek to her lips.
"I don't know," he admitted. "Don't see how this can be related to his sister's missing DNA. But the timing is suspicious. If Thor and Tony hadn't turned that hurricane, the East Coast would be in chaos right now. Don't suppose anyone would bother 'bout Storm for a while."
The instant the truck was stable, Happy emerged at speed through the rear doors and the rain. Iron Man gave him a lift up to the driver's door, and told him to, "Wait until we've cleared the way for you, then reverse this thing into the road and head back the way you came. Stop after half a mile. I'm sending a jet down to pick up you, your passengers and gear."
"They're Stark-designed weapons. I'm the Wasp. I'm an Avenger."
"Right," Jan said briskly. "Shuri, come with me and help me rig this baby to bamboozle air traffic control. I'm hoping it's a challenge, but Tony has probably made it automatic. Steve, see if there's any food in the lockers. It's going to be a long flight."
Tony winced and then hoped that that hadn't been visible. "It's not that. It's something I have to be sure about before I ac— tell anyone."
"You owe your current safety to them," Tony snapped.
"No. Don't do that. I won't be available. I'm handing out rain checks for movie night."
The pain woke Steve. It was deep under his shoulder, burning cold and angry, demanding his attention despite other aches that suggested he had gone several rounds with the Hulk.
"We must stop meeting like this, Clint," he said. "People will begin to talk."
"That problem is under control, sir. Ms Van Dyne—"
"Didn't see anything projecting it: just that light show." They were beyond the airbase now and gaining height.
"Jeff Cellini from Huffington Post—"
"No, she didn't, because it wasn't her."
Inwardly, Steve winced. Apparently some of Howard's stories had been all too accurate. "Phillips protected me – because right then, the US needed me. Your friend follows orders or loses his career, at the least. And if some lawyer can swing it so refusing that order sounds like treason, he could end up in Leavenworth."
"So would I, for the moment," Storm agreed. "Right now I don't have much trust in the Pentagon left."
Natasha held out a hand, "Natasha Romanoff, sometimes known around here as Natalie Rushman and professionally as the Black Widow, spy and assassin. And thank you for your assistance."
There was a ripple of rather tense laughter, which ended abruptly as someone cleared their throat.
"You'd break your word." Steve was plainly incredulous, and that somehow warmed Tony, even though he knew the other man was wrong.
"So where is it?"
"I'm not the one starting a fight," Tony said.
"Maybe I just like you naked."
"It was the Hulk who went through the portal, and even if he turned back into Bruce, as long as he's conscious he can turn back into the Hulk," Hank pointed out, "and the Hulk's not going to lead them there."
"Hank Pym," Howard decided. "He's one of the world's foremost biochemists. I trust him."
"That's government property you're destroying, Stark."
"Question seconded, Robin Hood," Tony said, looking hard at Jan. "Some of it was a holographic projection – using my tech, I might add – but there was something physical, very large and very strong in there too."
The cab driver took the opportunity to dive into his vehicle and speed off in a scream of abused tyres.
The beam hit the doors, filling the cavern was filled with thunderous noise, everything except the doors themselves shaking as if in an earthquake, throwing down an avalanche of stone from roof and walls.
"It is possible the plane is maintaining radio silence with stealth tech switched on," he added quickly. "Jan has my stealth on her personal jet, so she may have remembered it. If so, there's nothing we can do but wait. And deal with the Panther's problem. So how can we help, T'Challa?"
Steve was waiting by the elevator as Tony and T'Challa approached. Before he had even opened his mouth to speak, Tony said, "You know what they say about eavesdroppers, Cap," before ducking under the arm Steve reached for him, and into the elevator, leaving the two Wakandans staring questioningly at Steve.
Nothing. He shifted to the other side of the crack, gripped the rock and heaved.
"You think you hold all the cards, don't you, Stark? Okay. Deal." He touched his finger to his ear. "We're done for the moment. Withdraw all agents back to the helicarrier."
But Howard hadn't finished. "The other important secret held here concerns your shield. As you are aware, the steel it is made of contains a new element. There are stories circulating, which I have encouraged, that the steel is natural and meteoric; this is not the case. The element – which I have not named for reasons which will now become clear – was given to me specifically for your use. And not by an American. It has spectacular properties. I have analysed its atomic structure and, perhaps, in the future, someone will be able to synthesise it. Or perhaps those with access to a natural source will make themselves known."
"Who was the red-head?" Steve asked, trying to keep the jealousy he felt out of his voice.
"Oh, for fuck's sake! Stop lying to me," Tony shouted. "Everything was just fine this morning. Then a few hours later, you run for it. Why?"
"Where are my clothes?" Steve asked plaintively.
Disorientated, he raised his head and peered through the blanket of fog, unable to discern where the shore might be. Or, to be honest, and if it hadn't been for gravity, where the sky was. "Iron Man?" he asked into his com. Then, when there was no response, "
want. What
Evasion. Definitely evasion.
"Perhaps because he cannot explain his survival. I have scanned the remains of the armour and the spent core," Jarvis said, "and my calculations show the residual power levels fell below what was needed to sustain life support over a protracted period."
"I agree," Okoye said. Then, "Perhaps we should—" Her voice was drowned in a great roar, the sound of an enormous cat that shook the ground under their feet and raised waves on the lake.
"The stone," he said. "You are sure it fell into the sea? That Kar— that the witch did not manage to retrieve it?"
"I'm afraid Tony's spare suit is mine," Steve said, trying for wry amusement. "I'm not so fond of this outfit I'd abandon my clothes for it."
"You okay?" Tony was kneeling at the end of the jetty, looking down at him with a smile on his lips that did not reach the rest of his face. Steve was abruptly reminded that they had parted in anger after last night's shouting match.
"That I can promise." Because it would never need to happen. The last thing he wanted was Steve involved. "So, did you make any impression on His Majesty?"
"Yes. And thank you."
"This isn't a fighter," Tony retorted as he spun the wheel. "And I don't have a rear gunner... gun, gun..." It was so long since he'd driven this car he'd forgotten the extra that had come with this particular vehicle when he'd bought it from a Mafia boss who was heading for jail. "There's a handgun in a secret compartment under the dash though, damn it, I've forgotten the code I need to release—"
"And thank you for saving all our lives yesterday," she added, placing a mug full of coffee and a plate piled high with pastries in front of Steve.
Once again he had blasted aside Tony's defences. Too choked by emotion to say anything, Tony twisted around to face him, kissed him gently, then rested his forehead against his.
"That, that
"No, I came here looking for an enhanced individual who
"I'm not a superhero. I can't—"
And Steve laughed, though perhaps there was a note of hysteria at the very back of it. "Oh, Tony, you..." He put both hands on Tony's shoulders, apparently to hold them apart. "I don't know what I'd do without you."
The pain was intense. He screamed and Extremis screamed with him. All contact with the electronic world was lost. The lab vanished, his body vanished and he was stretched into darkness. He was multitudes, each one battering against his mind, searching across the cosmos, yearning, lost and lonely...
He'd surely waited long enough for anyone watching – and presumably they were watching – to be either shocked or interested or both. Now his right hand was hidden by Steve's body, he could move it to his belt.
"I thought your workforce was locked in here."
He wasn't sure how long the silence lasted, let alone what Tony was thinking. Then his friend closed his eyes and leaned into Steve, all the fight gone out of him.
Damn Jarvis's doubts.
The golden eyes turned questioningly to Steve.
"They'll need lab space," Tony said, "and medical facilities."
"We'll take the body with us. It might still be of use."
The portal snapped shut at the same moment as the hatch. Danvers sent the jet rocketing high into the sky, outrunning the shockwave as the drone exploded.
Steve was examining the contents of the newly restocked refrigerator when he heard a noise behind him – the sort of small noise that someone makes when they want you to know they are there without startling you. Steve looked round to find Jan hitched up onto a stool at the breakfast bar, looking at him thoughtfully. She was still wearing the blue pants, together with a white shirt that was far too big for her and therefore was almost certainly Tony's, but her feet were bare and she looked cool and relaxed. "I forgot you can cook," she said. "I was expecting to have to do something myself because Tony certainly can't. Can I help?"
"But did he actually tell you anything, my lady?" Fandral's voice asked.
"Mom!" Julia protested.
"If necessary," Steve said. "But it may not be."
, who is more than human, opted for human oversight. And he is worthy to lift Thor's hammer, unlike either of us."
"Mmm. Anything. What in particular?"
Tony considered. "Okay, I enjoyed the view. A lot."
"U-huh," Jan said. "Those guys were behind an attempted coup in Wakanda."
"But the letter might not be," Tony angled the pliers better to see the front of the envelope. "Well, it's a British stamp, at least, and it's franked, though that's so smudged you can't read any of it." He turned the envelope over. "Same false return address." Putting down envelope and pliers he snapped on the gloves and extracted the letter itself.
Even a couple of weeks ago, Steve might have thought this was paranoia, but now he wasn't so sure. What was more, he didn't dare ask Tony, in case it endangered their cover. After all, he hadn't believed it possible for Tony to remain silent for more than a few minutes, yet they hadn't exchanged even a dozen words since leaving Stark Tower.
"You have a duty to the shareholders to make those profits."
"Ask him if I won't do instead," Steve said, attempting to disentangle himself without waking Tony.
Tony, though, grabbed his arm and hung on firmly that Steve had to stop or drag him with him. "Steve, Steve, wait! Even if you... if you found him... too dangerous. You saw what he did ... to the wall. Without ... shield... go right through your body."
"Let's hope so," Steve said repressively. "Meanwhile what did you find so funny about asking Fury to produce my... Captain America's DNA?"
From the past he heard an equally calm voice, in another emotion-fraught moment, say, "...And get this done."
As Tony vetoed any briefings on the events that had resulted in Jan and Betty arriving at the Malibu house or the attempted kidnapping of the latter, Asgard was the subject of the conversation through much of their meal. Apparently, Jan had already filled Betty in on why she (and Tony) had thought Steve was dead. It seemed that Betty had already been told part of the story, though Tony had drawn him aside and warned him that Wakanda and T'Challa were not to be mentioned.
Miranda's face lit up with a smile. "I'm so pleased to meet you, Captain. We will do our very best for you."
Tony shook his head helplessly.
"Howard?" Steve frowned. "Howard set out to trap people and starve them to death? That hardly sounds likely. If he did, he must have been desperate to protect someone or something. He can hardly have meant to kill us."
"No reason for him to know. I don't want him to get worked up. Or leave. I got this, Jarvis."
And Steve was leaning on him, as if using the armour's strength to keep them both upright. "You're alive," he said, as if he hadn't quite believed the evidence of his eyes. "Oh, thank
"No, sir," Storm answered. "They didn't have the chance. Not sure about the Princess, though."
"He is going to die if you don't help him.""
"He what, surrendered?"
Well, if he didn't give details within the next half hour, Steve resolved that he wouldn't allow him to leave the building.
That thought was unbearable.
"Sir, you promised Ms Potts—"
"Of course you do." The response dripped sarcasm.
"Huh?"
"What the hell was in that thing?"
"Can you also dismantle the illusions that hide Wakanda from there?" Tony asked.
There was another flash, seemingly from the air, and this time Steve thought he saw... well, something... in the air.
It didn't.
"So that's the reason you brought me here?"
"Quiet, the pair of you. Just keep moving so we can get off this overgrown boat before she blows."
Steve heard what sounded like someone choking back a laugh, probably Clint. Then Natasha said, "What were we supposed to think, Stark? First of all Clint lost contact in what the National Weather Service are calling an 'unusually isolated squall' and what the press are shouting was an 'unprecedented mini-storm', and when we got it back, you were apparently asleep and had given Jarvis instructions not to wake you."
"You don't have to—"
Tony sighed and wished he'd kept the faceplate closed. "It's complicated. The Pentagon was trying to use Rhodey to influence me – because we'd been friends since MIT – it was why they originally appointed him as liaison to Stark Industries, I guess, and explains some of the questions he was asking on their behalf."
Instantly, he pushed back, taking the whole length of Steve's cock into him. He wasn't really ready, and Steve wasn't small, but it felt so good, even the burn and stretch...
Once the noise had died away, Iron Man shrugged away the rocks and staggered into the dust-filled air.
"I intend to take Shuri back to Wakanda, though she will undoubtedly argue for a return to the Sorbonne," T'Challa said quietly. "There are matters I need to take care of in Wakanda but I will come back to New York soon. I think it is time Wakanda made two way contact with the rest of the world. When I return I would like to make the Tower my base, temporarily, until I can purchase an appropriate embassy building."
Or, more probably the hike was just Tony's excuse to get him alone in the woods and have his way with him... He hoped so, anyway.
Maybe, just maybe, Steve thought, this situation might be turned to their advantage. For as long as he could maintain this masquerade.
Tony.
"It's not just about sex." Steve said firmly. He stood twisting his wedding ring on its finger, and then raised his eyes to meet his brand new husband's. "I love you."
He hadn't seen that kind of display on other local cars, either.
"Nope. Changing the size of things is Hank's speciality – he's developed something I'm calling Pym particles that...uh... Think of it this way: you know that everything is made up of atoms and molecules, right? And atoms and molecules are, well, mainly empty space. So, the Pym particles shrink the spaces between the electron shells and the nucleus, and also have an effect on mass that's much harder to explain because I don't understand it myself. I don't have the math. Tony might, I guess. He's got a doctorate in math and a natural talent for applied math – apart, of course, from being nearly as much of a genius as Hank."
He followed her eyes to the cracked and starred glass, and his hand started to move to the arc reactor on – in? — no, resting – on his chest, then stilled. His breathing was easy, deep, unrestricted despite the second of panic. But that, he guessed wasn't what Natasha had been talking about; instead, that would be that his hair was as dark as it had been that day in 2012, without a hint of grey, and he looked thirty or less rather than the forty-two he had been then, his face untouched by pain and stress.
"Surely I'm not the obvious person—" Tony, he knew, didn't have a family, at least one he cared to associate with. The SHIELD security report on his cousin Morgan had been scathing and one of the few things about Tony that had merited its approval was his contempt for the man. "Why haven't you called his friends?"
The sound of a police siren tore through the silence. Steve could see the lights in the rear view mirror without lifting his head.
There wasn't so much thunder in the air as a deep mutter, almost into infrasound levels, so you felt it in your teeth and the soles of your feet and your very bones.
Disappointed, Tony said, "Maybe this is a trap. I'll go up and take a look. Which is your apartment, Steve?"
Abruptly realising he still had his arms around Tony's chest, Steve let go and started to scramble to his feet, with every intention of taking off after the tiny Hulk. Surely he couldn't get very far.
Tony began to edge towards it.
"Guess I can stay here then," Steve said softly. "Jarvis, lights out, please. No calls, no alarms – we're sleeping late."
"I took a bath in the bay. I daresay Happy is still trying to dry the car seat. Does he have another name by the way? I didn't like to ask him."
On instinct, he spun, and hurled himself towards the roof edge. The heat beat at his back, right through the fire resistant armour Tony had built for him. His right foot hit the parapet and propelled him out and down.
"I presume that by 'everybody' you mean Captain Rogers and Ms Potts, who, by the way, has been trying to contact you for the past three hours. Apparently you are due to accompany her to a Charity Gala at the Met, sir."
"That is the age we inherited from the original universe," Clea said. "But I was taught that the birth of the multiverse is much more recent. As each universe splits from another, both carry that common history with them."
"My contacts tell me Fury was sure you had something to do with that," Clint said.
Hill sighed. "Are
Was that all? "Yeah. We were talking about how I wanted to be there, and how your conversation with Natasha and Clint, as well as with me, was going to be uncomfortable."
"No!" Steve shouted, startling Tony and Bruce. He took several deep breaths, and then went on quietly, "Sorry. I shouldn't've yelled. I'm real grateful, Tony, but just let it go. Please."
"Well, yes. I guess you put me to bed. Thank you. It was kind—"
"At once, sir."
"Pepper told SHIELD too damn much," Tony groused, not wanting to admit how grateful he was that she had.
"'Fraid so."
Tony made a two-gun gesture at him; "Give. Now."
"T'Chaka refused the outlanders' offer outright, saying that Wakanda had all the technology it needed, and charged White Wolf with protecting our culture and our borders. He thought that was the end of it, but less than a year later, a man calling himself Ulysses Klaw somehow appeared in the very heart of Wakanda, armed with the weapon you took from White Wolf, or one identical to it."
"He just seemed indestructible, never seemed to age – though I guess that was because he dyed his hair, and his moustache, and his eyebrows – can't say I'd know about the rest of it, and it's not something you can ask your Mom. For all I know he had facelifts too – it was too early for Botox. My father, the plastic man."
"In the SUV," Bruce said, close to his ear. As someone was also tugging his arm, he presumed that was Bruce too.
But Natasha was already running.
There was a short pause, no doubt while Bruce scrolled down the texts. "Wow, that's nasty. She's learned a lot listening to you, hasn't she? No, Tony, I don't think she's going to marry you."
Bruce took off his glasses and pocketed them, better to glare at Tony. "You are not helping," he told him. "Do I have to call out the Other Guy to knock some sense into both of you?"
Nice touch, Jarvis.
His hand went to mask the glow of the arc reactor, wondering, as he did so, why it was uncovered.
Steve had been fighting this for so long – for almost all the time he remembered being alive – that part of him was simply relieved to be free of desire, at least for a little while. The other part – the majority part, if the truth was told – was worried about something else he ought to have thought about before he started this... or allowed Tony to start it. He wasn't quite clear about who had taken the initiative, but looking into Tony's open and relaxed face, he knew who should be taking responsibility.
"And good morning to you, too," Tony said, recognising the voice. He switched the phone to speaker and put a finger to his lips to warn Steve. "Jarvis, offline for precisely five minutes. No record of this conversation."
One thing about this unseasonable weather; it made observing Tendring/Ten Rings Tower from the low cloud comparatively easy, and the noise of the wind and hail covered the sound of the repulsors.
"Yes," Tony said slowly. "Yes, I guess so." He looked up sharply. "But I don't think he expected to find you – or to die, come to that."
"SHIELD," Bruce said.
Steve didn't reply. Tony couldn't see his face, but his neck and shoulders were pink.
"Ms Van Dyne, sir."
The Hulk's huge fists clenched and his mouth opened in a roar that was louder than the explosion had been.
He needed a drink. Desperately. Almost as desperately as he needed to find some sort of sanctuary before he collapsed on the floor. Already, the world was misted. He moved onward, letting instinct guide him.
empathy." Then, as Steve started to protest, "I don't mean he doesn't care, but that he can't mentally walk in your – in anyone else's – shoes. Steve, his AI had to remind him to call me when he was being heroically suicidal."
She had been isolated at UCLA, while Rhodey was in his first year out in Colorado at the Air Force Academy. Tony himself had been working with his father and travelling the world, not to mention going on duty as Iron Man.
"Odd that you had a response team there. Even odder that there should be a gamma-radiating monster waiting for me too."
In an eyeblink the massive alien-like humanoid was transformed into a tall young man, as tall as Steve himself, but as dark as Steve was fair. He appeared to be Chinese or Japanese to Steve's untrained eye, but was clad in slacks and a black shirt with a dragon motif. Only his tinted glasses set him apart.
Tony hoped the Oklahoma one was safer, even with Bruce there. He also hoped that when Hank finally got to try the particles on living things he wouldn't use anything larger than a rat. A miniature Hulk didn't bear thinking about, much as he would enjoy teasing Bruce about it.
By now Tony was well aware how Steve's tactical mind worked. "So we don't. Well, not until I've had my hands on their computers."
"Not that greatly," Steve said. "If it hadn't been for Thor and Frigga I wouldn't be here."
"Sir," Jarvis said, "may I remind you—"
Tony woke to the sound of soft voices, so his first thought was,
He would have sold it, but his mother had loved that house, and so had Jarvis – God, he missed the original real live Jarvis, more than he missed his parents, which was something he didn't want to think about too closely – so perhaps it needed to be used again.
For Steve it had been.
He wriggled his right arm cautiously, and found it surprisingly easy to free it from the strap over his chest. Apparently it was not meant to disable him from escaping, but simply to hold him steady in whatever it was they had imprisoned him.
"Even when that works, it hurts like hell," Steve said.
The most worrying thing he had said, though, had been, "You can't let anyone else know about this – it would be another reason for them to try and re-create the super-soldier serum, or experiment on you to isolate that part of it. You've heard what happened to Bruce, which wasn't the worst of it." He'd elaborated to an extent that left Steve shocked and faintly nauseous.
Steve said nothing, just stood with his hand on the butt of the gun, looking impressive.
"Friend Stark, the good Jarvis informs me that you were asleep. I am sorry to have to wake you, but the matter is urgent. An hour ago, my dear Jane's base camp was attacked. My friends fought back valiantly. Erik's defences held firm, and Darcy wielded her taser mightily."
"I don't know. There are things I have to clear up here. Maybe a week or so."
Pepper had been furious. He'd had to change his cell number because her texts were drowning his business mail.
Steve did so, trying to make it seem he wasn't doing exactly that.
Once again dry and respectably clad – well, Tony's T-shirt wasn't really all that respectable, but at least it was clean and dry – they met in the workshop to watch Natasha's message.
"Got it." Steve was fumbling for the control that lowered the left hand window. Even as it slid away, and with an air of what seemed very much like contempt, the shrunken Hulk leaped from Steve's shoulder onto the back seat and vanished behind Hank.
And Clea was chanting as rings of red light flew from her hands to encircle the Doombot, imprisoning its arms, cutting through the armour.
It brought back another unwanted memory from the night before, of Steve half carrying him into the bathroom, and of him emptying his stomach into the john. He didn't remember coming back to bed.
"Thought you appreciated 'harsh', General."
Steve nodded and handed over the glass.
"Well, I can't argue with that."
Steve himself was beginning to have doubts. "I'm sorry. Guess I jumped to conclusions."
"That was my purpose, to rejoin his shattered soul with ours." It was the artefact speaking to him, in his own voice: "He is whole now, though he only has the shreds of memory that cling to those splinters. You already had most of my soul. Now the rest of it can come home. This time, guard him well."
He could hear their voices, if not the words.
His curiosity was now too acute for him to remain silent. "What is this place?"
The black Makluan ring was glowing with power, and, before it, a familiar blindingly-bright portal was forming.
Tony shook his head. "Nope. That may be compromised. Besides, Thor and his group are out west. By what may nor may not be coincidence, that's the way that the kidnappers of Lieutenant Storm and Princess Shuri were taking them, though their final destination probably wasn't in the States. The War Machine armour attacked me and Cap in Southern California, and was tracked by sharp-eyed fans coming from the North along the coast."
A silver-coloured humanoid figure, superficially like the Iron Man but not, in fact, like it at all, was pacing the Ferrari, some forty feet above it. Tony grinned to himself, then lifted one hand from the wheel and gave the figure a wave.
While he could probably take the vibranium blade away from her, there might be a cost and he had a responsibility to her, her brother, and everyone else on the planet. So he took a step backwards, lifting his hands, palm outwards.
Through the open hanger doors, he saw a Citation Mustang in unfamiliar livery taxiing towards them. It stopped outside the open doors, the steps were deployed, and a tall strawberry blonde descended them at speed, despite five-inch heels. She was instantly and confusingly recognisable.
"Tony, Steve. You need to know that AIM was responsible for sabotaging the arc reactor on board the helicarrier and, therefore, it was probably AIM agents who abducted Steve – so if your conscience has been troubling you about assaulting them, Steve, forget it. They're a high-tech terrorist organisation which seems to have been hiding out in Latveria. They also raided a SHIELD biological facility researching the super-soldier serum so I suspect that was where the last of Captain America's blood samples and the extracted super-soldier serum was being stored. As Fury is incandescent I presume SHIELD thinks they took those, and the research results."
"Lady with a Kojak," Tony said. "Guardian of the Time Stone. An Infinity Stone. She should have it back now. But we'd still like to chat. Just exchange gossip about timelines and the end of the universe."
"Just so. She has been trying to reach you ever since."
Tony slipped into the bathroom, picked up Steve's clothes and left just as quietly. As far as he was concerned, they were only fit for incineration.
"Nope. A mutant," Tony said. "There are a lot of them around. Xavier trains them to use their powers for good. And he really does read minds. So does one of his students. I've met her. She was on the run and we worked together to defeat this big time supervillain mutant called Magneto. I'll call the Westchester school in the morning. Even if Xavier brushes me off, Jean should be able to get me in to see him. But I think he'll be intrigued enough to help."
"Steve, Bruce is going to blow his sta—"
And the explosions and the fire had triggered another bout of flashbacks, ones that hadn't been mitigated by the conversation of the scientists, who were no longer talking in words, let alone in plain English. They seemed very excited about something, though Steve hadn't been sure what.
Bruce considered the suggestion with his usual gravity. "Yes," he said at last, "I rather think I do. Also, I'm worried about the fact that Tony was in Seattle when that creature appeared there."
and Tony
"No. You may help. Hank?"
Steve thought wildly, wondering how he could regain control of the conversation. "Well, it came off worse against his defences," he said. "As you will, Colonel, if you take on any of us. We aren't your enemies; we're just Tony Stark's friends."
Steve's laughter was bitter. "Thanks a lot. But of course you're still angry. I hurt you. You're tougher than I am – not Iron Man, you – I never thought I could hurt you. Or that you cared whether I tried."
"Good."
Tony reached again into the interior of the cabling duct, and gasped as the pain stabbed through his chest. He would have sworn but he'd worn out his vocabulary about an hour ago.
Iron Man dived forward, sliding on one knee, repulsor rays shooting from his left gauntlet to strike the War Machine on the chest, blasting the suit from under the path of the falling tail and instantly taking its place. The repulsor in Iron Man's right palm glowed sun-bright, blindingly bright, and the tail's fall halted, just an inch or so from the gauntlet. Iron Man brought up the other hand and carefully rose to his feet, balancing the tail on the repulsors.
T'Challa nodded. "That will be at your disposal, just as soon as we remove the SHIELD agents currently occupying the airfield. Does Ms Van Dyne's aircraft have a pilot?"
"So were the ambassadors. I don't think they were lying to us," Steve said.
Their destination was a palatial apartment where a tired and plainly worried Okoye was waiting for him. Her first words were to the point: "The portal?"
"Not likely," Jan replied. "He had a project."
Inevitably, it did.
"He isn't here," Tony said quickly, remembering that Jarvis knew of his decision to keep Steve's death a secret, but reminding him all the same.
Tony spread his hands wide. "Director, you know every move I made the day of the battle. But you can also have my word that I didn't load a Chitauri troop carrier onto a helicopter."
"He isn't dead and isn't hurt, as far as we know," Jan said quickly. "But he is missing in action. Tony and Captain A—
In another world.
Steve nodded. "I said I would have liked to have been there, and she said, 'Which is why Tony made no attempt to let you – or anyone else – know. I have no doubt that his conversations with Natasha and Agent Barton are going to be uncomfortable.' Though I'm pretty sure she was going to use another name before she said 'Natasha'."
He went on the attack. "What the hell, Stark?"
After what seemed like an age, Tony heard the soft sound of the elevator doors opening; Pepper had insisted that they make a noise and he couldn't be bothered to change that even though she had left the penthouse – and him – for good.
"Not your fault. You're good, and in some ways you're like her, but you've never spoken with Peggy Carter."
, Stark. By what happened. By your actions. I don't know if the assassination attempt was aimed at you or her, but she needed more protection than that chauffeur of yours could give her." She pushed past the two men towards the helicopter, which was still sitting on the pad, plainly waiting for her.
Tony had no more words. He simply used the strength of the armour to lift Steve and give him over to Thor. Steve looked almost small in the Asgardian's arms, and Tony thought for a moment about snatching him back. Before the thought was even fully formed, though, Thor was running out of the temple. Beneath the roiling skies, a strange symbol had formed on the bare earth where the crowd had stood only minutes before.
was Steve's immediate response as he tried to make sense of this new information. It reminded him of the way he had been unsurprised by Tony's appearance.
He had to give this up, instead of clinging to a stolen friendship and a desire that couldn't be consummated – that he wouldn't allow to be consummated.
It didn't work now. "Water and painkillers first," Steve said firmly, handing Tony a glass filled with clear liquid that unfortunately was not gin or vodka, and two capsules. Now he was faced with it, he also vaguely remembered being coaxed to drink a disconcerting amount of water at some ungodly hour.
"Just a minute," Hank interrupted. "Where's Jan? I know she was with you in Malibu. I've tried to call her half a dozen times, but she's not answering her cell. I can't contact Steve, either."
It was not a consoling thought.
Standing looking down at him he wondered at the depth of his own emotional involvement. He'd known about Captain America, of course, and had felt a vague admiration for him during history lessons.
"In terms of life experience he's either twenty-four years or twenty-four hours old," Howard pointed out. "Take your pick. I don't think it worked for me, but he may go for the kid brother approach."
It was the car jolting to a stop that woke Steve from his half-doze.
"Thank you," Chayo said quietly as Ndungu followed Steve. Only when they had disappeared did he add, "You should be safe enough, for Wakanda is, according to all reports, highly civilised, save in its adherence to a religion older than either Christianity or Islam. But two of my staff have been suddenly recalled – the ones I have long suspected of being from Wakanda. The political situation there may not be entirely stable. Be wary."
Which at least explained why she was alone. Which was... convenient.
Seconds later, the gate swung open.
Despite there being no one to see him – no one human, in any event – Tony raised an eyebrow but otherwise remained impassive, for all that his heart was thundering in his chest. Well, at least he didn't have to worry about the shrapnel any longer.
Blue-grey eyes met Tony's, their owner's expression speculative.
Who weren't all Wakandan. Though not all of those in battlefield greens were white. They all had guns, though, not spears, as if the spears weren't dangerous enough. Soldiers, then, probably mercenaries, because that uniform wasn't that of any National army Tony had encountered in years of selling armaments to the world.
Thor's laughter faded into a silence that lasted far too long.
"Why, don't you like me bare-faced?"
"I was frozen in the Arctic; I woke up in New York. I have no idea how long I was in their hands before—"
Hill rolled her eyes at him. "Thank you for your assistance, Mr Stark."
"Nothing," Tony gasped, trying to restrain a fit of giggles. "Nothing, punkin'. Just... just... some experimental animals escaping."
"He smiled."
"Doesn't explain the memories – memories of you – that Xavier saw in my mind."
"She is returning to the tower, sir."
"It's a shield," Tony said, torn between amusement and disappointment. "Made from a vibranium alloy."
Tony's expression no doubt mirrored his feelings of dismay and amusement. "I forgot... Well, I was busy... Stop giving me that 'Captain America is displeased with you' look: it doesn't work on me."
"I think you are working from insufficient information, sir," Jarvis put in. "The brunette – 'call me Lucky' was it? – is currently attempting to download data from one of the penthouse terminals..."
"Fury would be bound to take advantage," Tony agreed. "Okay, Jarvis, let's get code-cracking."
Steve was interrupted by the beeping of a cell phone.
"Three counter-clock. Got it."
"Just do it."
"And you're not?"
"Jarvis?" The sharp query was not directed at Jan but at the helmet lying beside him on the table.
"At once, sir."
"Oh, God, Tony," Bruce whispered, "you don't think—?"
"I am fighting fit."
"I'll get you your darn coffee," Steve snapped. He reached into his T-shirt drawer, pulled out the first one that came to hand, threw it at Tony's head, so it hid his widening grin, then fled to the kitchenette.
"We've lost track of him," Tony said, hoping that this was indeed the case. "He phones 'Peggy' I need to know at once. Personally."
A motorcycle suddenly swerved across the limo's nose. Happy, caught off guard, braked a moment too late, and spun the wheel so desperately that, instead of avoiding a collision by riding the kerb, the limo fishtailed, its rear clipping a the side of a truck that had inexplicably decided to swerve across their original path, and, incidentally, slashing through a tyre. The impact shoved the limo up onto the sidewalk, sending pedestrians scattering.
"Not ruling out assassination," Tony said, fighting to keep his voice as serious as he could manage. "Who do you suggest we target? The Attorney General and the White House Chief of Staff might cause more trouble than they're worth. We could try General Ross, but Betty Ross would probably object. And I like Betty. More to the point, so does Bruce and no one wants to argue with the Jolly Green. How about the WSC instead? And how much are the pair of you charging and can I offset it against your rent?"
. Tony only hoped the blessing would work. "Take care, Erik," he said in response, and blasted to the skies, the transporter following in his wake.
"Jarvis has Thor on the line," Steve said, evading the question.
And now the not-sky, not-lake were streaked with flashes of other colours, first red, then blue, then purple and finally green.
"I can't hear any of you." Steve was shouting, though he probably didn't realise it. "I hope to God that's just the racket. If you can hear me: the alien troops are exploding, whether they're dead or alive. Repeat: the enemy is self destructing."
The leer grew more horrible. "Wanna make me?"
"Well, Hunter, are the Hatut Zeraze scared I will break my given word – and do you think they could hold me if I did?" he asked sardonically, and in English. His voice was deep with a faint hint of an educated English accent and, to Tony's astonishment, it was familiar.
"Dad was an alumnus. So no, unless Obie or Pep enrolled me without my knowledge. I'm probably on their shit list because SI stopped manufacturing small arms and assault weapons. Are they pissed?"
T'Challa glanced at a bank of instruments. "Gamma radiation."
Who he still not dared think about too closely, but who was always in his thoughts.
He whirled, checking every inch of the room, ready to fight, but there was nothing to fight against. "Where are you?" he demanded.
"Mr Stark, sir." The call came from the reception desk. They'd been extra fast. "We have no trace of a Steven Rogers, with or without the G or the PH or the D entering or leaving the building in the past month. We used to have a Grant Stephens working in Legal, but he left six months ago, and there's an S. Rogers in IT, but she's Sonya."
"Loki?" Hill demanded.
He hit the water ass first, and hard. It left him with an open mouth and too much water coming in as he thrashed his way back to the surface.
was Tony's thought. Then,
He knew that wasn't the right name, but it seemed appropriate.
can take it up with the Secretary of the Air Force."
"You can wash my back," was the reply.
"Or what?" Tony felt a hand on his shoulder, and knew it was Bruce. He shook it off angrily. "Invade Stark Tower? Or was it the government who just tried that? And failed."
"This is where I worked," Iron Man corrected, no emphasis in the distorted voice, "and it's where I'm going to work for the next few hours. Go to bed, Cap. Up the spiral steps, two flights. I'm sure Ann-Marie bought you some pyjamas – at least, I asked her to."
"We need to get closer. Inside the temple if possible," Steve said, as he watched the party pass between the stone panther's teeth.
At least, Steve thought wildly, this should make him less dangerous, easier to catch and restrain.
Steve eased his position in the front passenger seat of the battered station wagon – Tony called it an SUV – and watched the evening sunlight flickering hypnotically between the branches of the trees that flanked the road through the hills. That flicker was also getting faster as, for the first time in their journey, Tony put his foot on the gas. A quick glance up at the windshield showed eighty miles an hour on the head up display.
A ripple of amusement ran round the circle of wizards.
Tony's expression was troubled but he merely said. "I'll bring you some black coffee and sugar and cream separately so you can experiment," and was back within thirty seconds with just that, while Howard served him with a plate heaped with what turned out to be very tasty food.
"Maybe, but I'm right. If you're going to act like this you'll be barred from the armoury unless I'm here."
"Ma'am," Steve said, holding out a hand. "Forgive me for being unfit for company, but I'd just come in from a run when Jarvis gave the alarm."
"I thought you'd never ask, Mr Stark."
"Not if we're intercepted."
There was a mutter of background protest at Thor's end, but god and man both ignored it.
What had he heard Obie tell Pepper once? "The best way to get Tony to do something is to tell him he can't."
And he was flying forward into the depths of the Quantum Realm.
The drapes were drawn away  from the big windows in the living room in Tony's suite revealing a star specked sky and a lamp speckled shoreline. Two pairs of red and green navigation lights were bobbing out on the lake.
Tony took a step towards the portal, then half a step back, as from its blinding brightness, a nightmare head was emerging, studded with many sickly green eyes, red pincers and short tentacles or possibly antennae surrounding a slitted mouth, large enough, as Tony knew, to swallow a human with ease. He'd seen Doom snatched up into it. Behind that head, he also knew, was vast segmented body, many legged and armoured.
"You have no manners, Barton," Tony told him. "Feet down."
He grabbed for the nearest projection, which happened to on the flight attendants' station and even as he clung on through another series of bumps, a silver coloured pole telescoped up from the floor and some very un-Tony-like bump-and-grind music started up.
"And Whitney?"
"No."
"No."
"Tony?" There was the sound of an orchestra and an operatic tenor in the background, which suddenly died to a whisper, so she wasn't actually at an opera house. For the last decade he had always known exactly where Pepper was, and that he didn't know if she was in LA, New York, Washington or Timbuktu made him even more uneasy.
The room itself was lit by what might or might not be Tiffany lamps, while on the dining table itself, which Tony seemed to be in the process of rearranging, candlelight glittered on silver and cut glass, flared off the white linen and china.
Steve's heart was pounding as he waited for Bruce to open the tunnel to the Quantum Realm. The case containing the Infinity Stones was heavy in one hand, Mjolnir light as a feather in the other. Steve kept his eyes on Bruce, not wanting to look at either Bucky or Sam, in case either made an instinctive mental leap to figure out his plan. It was an effort to respond to their banter, but he forced himself to answer in kind.
Hunter shrugged. "No one in your country knows that you are here, Stark, and my allies here insist that you came here to aid T'Challa in his quest to destroy all that matters about Wakanda."
Once the horror ceased, Tony dug the shield into the ground in front of him to stop himself sliding any further and sat down hard, staring at the carnage that had been one of his creations and a human being, though now it was impossible to separate what was left of them.
The one really good thing about waking up in this time and place. Except, it was one more complication, one more thing that he was almost certainly going to lose.
But why should anyone, including SHIELD, rely on such an indiscriminate and dangerous weapon as gas?
Steve was too damn smart – and bound to side with Rhodey. Sure, Rhodes had had a difficult choice but that wasn't
"Sir."
"Tony—" Bruce began, but was waved to silence.
"Would we?" Steve asked, with a grin.
Jan snorted. "This is Tony Stark's house. The whole thing is probably in breach of California's gun laws."
"My personal shopper in LA. I rang her this morning, gave her your size details and asked her to pick up some clothes for you. Or would you rather go out in full Asgardian?"
"You won't do that even if you could," Steve retorted angrily. "And, believe me, you can't hold me against my will."
"But not you."
Black wasn't really Pepper's colour, particularly with her bright hair tucked away beneath an equally black hat that shaded her face. Even the blouse under the designer jacket of her skirt suit was steel grey. He wondered if she would have been so conventional at his own funeral or if she would have followed the instructions in his will and worn red and gold.
"I know. But it should have warned you that Barnes was a walking time bomb. Have you found him yet, by the way?" If there was one thing calculated to push Steve's buttons, it was Barnes. And Tony had no sympathy at all for Barnes or for Steve's... obsession... with him.
Natasha's fingers were wrapped around Tony's chin, a fraction away from a stranglehold. Not that he could breathe, anyway. Maybe she would just kill him and then he wouldn't have to explain.
Once back in the safety of his workshop, he dropped into a chair buried his face in his hands.
"Washington prefers it to 'space-dragons'," Velasco said dryly.
Howard raised a single eyebrow. "Well, I've heard back from Hank Pym. He is quite certain that your DNA matches what we have from the original Steve Rogers – you are genetically identical, which means you are either him or an identical twin who was given the same serum and frozen in the ice for the same amount of time. There was some deterioration in the old sample, but not enough to make a difference. You are him, Steve. It was you who was being held captive and unconscious on the helicarrier. Tony confirms your story from the evidence he found there. Unless you don't believe him."
He'd better be able to, because if Steve found out what he was doing right now he was going to throw the worst temper tantrum since Iron Man had locked horns with Thor over the possession of Loki.
"What d'you mean by that, Stark?" Carter demanded, but it was Jarvis who answered.
They had both ended up naked, and the mutual masturbation session that followed had been satisfactory.
They shot away over what turned out to be an island, and since the passing wind seared his skin and he had to turn his head to one side to breathe, he was able to catch glimpses of a great city's lights behind them. A short time later and they were heading straight for the side of a low mound, crowned by a glowing building. A hatchway irised open for them, and, perhaps twenty seconds later, they were settling on a pad in the middle of a huge room, brightly lit and full of ordered machinery, some of which he could actually recognise.
The roar was louder than both the downpour and the thunder.
He had hesitated for too long. Iron Man gripped his arms and lifted him up through the air, setting him down behind the wall that concealed the elevator machine rooms and the entrance to the access stairs, all of which were undoubtedly locked tight.
"He's fixated on the super-soldier process, which makes Steve a target. After all, he's the only one it ever worked on. And, then, of course, there's your father's work."
At once, a strong arm slid behind his back, and the goblet was held close to his lips. It smelt wonderful. He sipped at it cautiously, and the thick liquid soothed his throat as instantly as it warmed his stomach.
Steve rubbed a towel over his hair, grateful for the new cut that required little further attention, and then considered the limited amount of clothing he had brought with him, laid out on the bed. He wasn't going to wear the same black suit he'd worn to the cemetery and, while he was sure Tony wouldn't even blink if he wandered in wearing running gear, after the emotions that had almost overwhelmed him a couple of hours ago he wanted to insert some formality between them.
"Then I'm here illegally."
Tony looked into his eyes. He said: "Don't you?"
"What?" The woman looked scandalised, and almost ... hurt. "How dare—"
"Tony, he'd been missing, presumed dead, for nearly
"Fury? Hill?" Steve suggested.
"You are sure they were SHIELD, Steve?" Bruce asked.
"Or from one of the other Nine Worlds," Thor agreed. "Describe what happened."
There were so many emotions: shame at what he had done, fury at the way Tony had tried to conceal the failure of the ARC reactor, fear that he had done so much damage to him that Tony would never forgive him—
"I was never more serious." Tony told him. "Do I also need to give you a lecture about condom use? Stop that! I'm – I'm not... not ticklish. Steve! Stop it!"
"Not working," Okoye said, with annoyance, as she pressed one of her victims' fingers on the gun's trigger. Steve was relieved to note the barrel was pointed upwards as she experimented.
"Do you know what's happening between Tony and Jim – Colonel Rhodes?"
Steve ignored the jibe. "That, according to Jarvis, you should be dead."
"Thank you, but shouldn't you do it here? I don't think you are supposed to leave him."
The Black Widow was frowning at Tony. "Are you sure about that? Who is this?" There were layers and layers of suspicion in her voice.
"We don't know for certain where the Hulk is," Tony said. "But he's probably in the hands of a dangerous unknown enemy who just happens to have control of teleportation portals and some innovative weaponry."
"It really failed?" Steve's heart was thundering. "I didn't think – it was just a precaution –" He didn't know right now whether he wanted to wrap his arms around Tony and never let go or punch him through the nearest wall. "Wait – you said that it did not lose power. No, that Tony said it did not lose power. That's – Jarvis, was he lying? If so, why?"
"But Bruce is alone," Steve protested in an attempt to avoid the implications of that.
Steve looked down at his feet, then gathering his courage, up to meet Jan's eyes. "It's easy to be a good listener when you never know what to say to girls."
you're one of my oldest friends and—"
"That's what I came to tell you," Hank sounded unusually tentative.
"That we can do," Tony assured him.
"Looks like they're my next job, then."
"I couldn't say, Captain."
"An honour, sir," Jackson said, pumping Tony's hand enthusiastically.
"Not in the Burke and Hare sense," Tony replied, "but people have been buried with jewellery and expensive guitars and even Cadillacs – oh, and stealing flowers used to be a thing, I think."
"I do not know," Okoye admitted. "Something is very wrong with my Lord. It is almost as if he is possessed."
Steve decided to laugh but he was confused enough for it to come out of a giggle. "One... of the Warriors Three."
"He's asleep," Tony said, recovering from his surprise. "Tell me truthfully, Thor – is he going to recover? I mean fully recover?"
"No, sir."
Damn it, where had he pulled that one from? He was getting too fucking good at reading Tony's thoughts!
Steve had never seen him before; he was sure of this because he would certainly have remembered the dark blond hair falling rakishly to one side of his forehead, short-trimmed beard and curled and pointed moustaches, not to mention the dark green jerkin, breeches and knee high boots.
"Me too," Tony told him. Then, as the other man made his way towards the door. "Oh, and Steve..."
Had he imagined Steve's return? He'd wanted it so much...
The mask was pulled away. For the first time someone spoke, a deep, strong voice with an unidentifiable accent. "We need just one piece of information from you, Stark."
None of which were possible.
"He has a healing factor in his DNA," Tony said. "It's still working because he was hit by what was probably a piece of shrapnel from the explosion. There was blood on his clothing – his shoulder – but even the scar is gone."
No one seemed to have noticed Steve.
"No I fucking well wasn't." Tony was plainly furious. "But you were so damn sure of yourself, didn't trust me or Bruce at all, just made a judgement without letting us explain what we were doing. JARVIS himself thought it 'worth a go' but no, Captain America knows best – even when he knows nothing. You still didn't accept we'd made the right call, not even after Thor countered Maximoff's play. Not after he told you that
"This is getting creepy," Tony opined.
"Good to meet you," Tony said, gripping back, wondering, as he did so, why Wakanda would need a trade minister. "This is my assistant and bodyguard, Mr Rogers."
"We'll need to run tests—"
"We're going," Steve said, because that order was what he had been waiting for. He put the SUV into reverse and, instead of turning, put his foot to the floor and steered it backwards up the hill until out of range of the rifles.
"My orders are to kill him."
He opened the faceplate on the armour.
There were human shapes too, blackened bodies lying on scorched rubble.
"He would say that his people rescued you and were keeping you alive," Howard said at the same moment.
"The Maria Stark Foundation."
"And I'm sure you would have. Or a close approximation." This was good. This was a great distraction. "Jarvis, check out that number for me."
None of it made sense, least of all his own existence. There was so much the man he was supposed to be shouldn't know but was familiar, and so much he should know but didn't.
Steve looked suspiciously into her guileless brown eyes. "Aren't you going to warn me not to hurt him?"
"She's estranged from her father," Jan said, "and a good friend. She's still in touch, and in love, with Bruce. Tony?"
Implacable hands closed round his arms and he was hauled up through the air.
Tony hated lying to Steve. But...
"Which are?" That was Natasha.
Steve was kneeling beside him, his features ghostly in the light of the ARC reactor. "Thank God," he said. "I thought for a moment..." He stopped short, turning his head as the underground chamber was filled with the horribly familiar grinding noise. "What?" He lifted a flashlight Tony hadn't even realised he was holding and pointed it to illuminate the stairs concertinaing into the cliff and the lack of what had, undoubtedly, been an opening at the top of the stairs.
It was the first time that Steve had seen Asgard from outside Thor's apartments. On the balcony or looking out through the windows, the gargantuan towers had always gleamed golden against a sky that never seemed to change, a red sun low on one horizon, the stars and galaxies bright in a black sky on the other, blue streaked with fine white clouds overhead, with the sea sparkling beyond and the rainbow bridge a dazzling streak between water and sky. The weather had always been perfect. Now, though, everything was masked in something between drizzle and mist. The cloak hood which shadowed his face was a perfectly natural protection against the weather, but with the huge bulk of the giant Volstagg on his right and the stony-faced Hogun glaring about him on his left masking him from passers-by no one was likely to notice that one third of the Warriors Three was a ringer. And if either of his companions reached out to steady him at each exact moment he needed that support, well, that was also hidden by cloaks, mist and familiarity.
Thor's expression had cleared. "No. No, Captain... Steven. You were not dead – not for more than a few minutes – but you stood on the edge of death for six Midgardian days.”
"Tony isn't going anywhere," Tony said. "Don't worry, Steve. There's no need to be apprehensive."
"This man is Tony Stark, the American engineer, who pilots the Iron Man armour, and can synthesise vibranium. His companion is Captain Rogers, who is his—"
Still seething, Steve clamped his lips shut on his angry words, and went. Maybe a cold shower would help him calm down. And in more ways than one, because, to his dismay, the exchange with Tony had left him strongly sexually aroused.
"Not knowingly," Tony snapped. "Look up the meaning of that company name if you want to know why. Also, I seem to recall leaving explicit instructions that
He still didn't feel good about it but the dizziness receded as he wolfed down the candy bars. He also took the first aid kit for later use, and the currency which was, well, just bills with unknown faces on them. He could read the figures, though.
Steve shrugged. "In that case, I guess you can tell me where she's buried."
"Not like you to obey that particular order, Jay. Unless you had an ulterior motive. So, you gonna finish what you started to say to me when I woke up."
"We may soon have a Thunder God at our door, so we need to relocate these people," she told him decisively. "I don't want to endanger the students at Karma-Taj, and they would be even more noticeable in Hong Kong, so we'll take them to the London sanctum. Please request that all the Masters of the Mystic Arts meet us there in three hours. This is something we need to discuss."
Much as Tony hadn't wanted to admit it, Steve was smart and making determined efforts to come to terms with the technology of the twenty-first century. That should have been no surprise, because he'd faced the alien tech employed by Hydra, and had had to put up with Howard Stark's eccentric genius. His initial prejudices tossed aside, Tony took charge of Steve's education, with Jarvis as assistant, abandoning SHIELD's step-by-step chronological approach and challenging Steve with his own cutting edge tech and the science that underpinned it. Jarvis proved surprisingly good at translating some of this into reasonably plain English.
"Steve," Jarvis said, "Dr Banner is trying to contact Mr Stark via the secure link."
"I owe you improved weapons," he said. "And you'll need an earbud on the Avengers frequency. That is, if you want to continue as a superhero after this."
"A message, eh? Well, what does it say?"
"Yes. One moment." Seconds later, a soft light lit the interior of the vehicle and the face of its driver, though Steve could see nothing beyond its edges. "The road leads to the border and they will expect me to take you there. But the border guards will already have been alerted and I am not sure which of them I can trust. I cannot risk letting you cross tonight. There will soon be an opportunity to retreat to a safe place."
Tony hesitated. He wanted very badly to send Thor to the Travis Air Force base in an attempt to find Steve, but he would arrive far too late to be of use. Sending him back to Asgard with the intelligence about Karnilla and the Norn Stone might result in him never returning to Earth. "Do you know how well Selvig is getting on with the research I sub-contracted to him?"
"Yeah, I'm fine. Missed me completely."
"I got rid of those goons easily enough," Jan said. "Then Betty and I switched places."
"Jan," Hank protested. "I am not—"
But when Betty contacted them – and he was sure she would contact them because she was one smart lady – he knew that both of them would go barrelling to the rescue. All the Avengers would, to rescue one of their own. Besides, he needed Bruce and had a feeling he was going to need the Hulk sooner rather than later.
So, maybe he could still use their own powers to send them their appointed places. In a moment it was done: Mind and Time pushed by Space to places he had seen, knew.
Iron Man rose into the air. "Oh, and one more thing, Nick. Your informant at SI is about to go silent; you'll get nothing more from that source."
"You can't call Pepper or Jim Rhodes average," Howard said. "And couldn't even before they went to college. I'm not sure Happy Hogan is either. Wait until you meet them."
When Steve woke again he was feeling much better; well enough to get out of bed without falling over and make his way into the bathroom before his bladder decided that, super-soldier serum or not, it was going to have to release or burst.
"Damn that. You messed up today because something's eating you. Now, spit it out. Because I'm not getting back in that car with you fuming while you're driving."
"You could have been killed!"
Every door was shut. He could start opening them, but that might mean discovery and once again having to hurt people who had done no harm. It was unlikely that whoever had the Infinity Stones, the Pym Particles and the wrist controller (not to mention Mjolnir) would let them out of his or her sight – particularly if that person were Tony. But if it wasn't Tony, and if he could find whoever-that-was, he might be able to negotiate them back.
"Yes, I know," Steve said, relieved that there was something about the Air Force that he did know.
"I got Fury wrong too."
Tony had first seen Cap in the ice while he himself was under sentence of death as a result of his encounter with Mallen, SHIELD's own super-soldier experiment gone wrong. After taking a tiny dose of Extremis himself, and becoming enhanced physically and mentally, he thought he understood a little of what the man had gone through.
"What?"
But Tony wasn't actually listening to the Lieutenant any more. Instead, he was looking about him in dismay. "Hey, where's Helen of Troy? I know she was with you at LAX..."
Well, Tony had said it didn't always react.
"Secure. Selvig shut it down. Though I do not know how he knew how to do this thing—"
"I don't think he'll need to do so," Steve said. "We're already so deep in each other's debt—"
More information does not necessarily make things clearer...
"There were no radios or televisions on site when I de-mothballed it," Tony protested.
Hennis shook his head. "You're lying, Mr Stark. You know that and I know that. If you continue to be obstructive I must insist on searching your penthouse and research facilities."
The armour wasn't built for running, and Steve had to leap aside as Iron Man came close to mowing him down, only the use of the repulsors bringing him to a stop. He had to bite his tongue to forebear commenting.
Tony lay on the floor of the lab, the epoxy-resin flooring cool against his skin, uncomfortable, but too exhausted to move. When he did, he suspected it would be painful. Steve had come twice inside him before Tony had finally lost control and let orgasm overtake him. What was more, he was pretty sure the condom had split under the strain and his thighs were sticky and, no doubt, smelly.
"Of course we're friends," Steve was horrified. "Working with you has been great, Tony, but my presence puts you in danger. I knew if I explained you'd try to make me change my mind, though I can't imagine why."
Tony had other words for it.
"What's going on?" Hank's voice asked.
There was also an empty glass on the floor beside the couch, and a half-empty bottle besides it. Steve took a look at the label and winced. Even he knew what the words '40 year old Single Cask Malt Whisky' signified and that it was really, really too good to be used as an anaesthetic.
"Sir, I hate to interrupt," Jarvis said, interrupting all the same. "There's an urgent call from Mr Hogan."
"We were about to retreat," Clint said, "when something whispered in my ear that there was going to be a diversion and that would be a good time to head to the Tower. Then the Hulk appeared – only you say it wasn't the Hulk."
Steve glanced at his drawing, at the outline of the city that he had abandoned, at the sketches of Sif and Fandral, and at the more detailed drawing of Tony, done easily from memory. It worried him that he'd tried, over the last few days, to draw Peggy and Bucky, but never seemed to get them quite right, as if his memory of them was fading with time.
Pepper pushed back her chair, crossed her legs to show off both their length and her latest pair of designer high-heels, and raised perfectly plucked eyebrows. Tony considered the heels entirely unfair. The very highest enabled her to look down at him. Damn it, she was nearly his height in flats.
Tony jumped to his feet, ready to carry on the argument, but Steve caught his eye and shook his head at him. "Leave this to me," he mouthed.
He'd wanted desperately to dismiss it as coincidence, but he couldn't, however hard he tried.
"No?" Gene's eyebrows were raised. "What did Yogthulu want you, me and Howard for but to eat our souls?"
"I know what the word means," Steve said. "You mean he's some sort of stage magician?"
There was shock and fear in her response.
There was a disbelieving snort close to Tony's ear, but he was too angry right then to identify the origin. That assumption plainly came from Pepper, and told him all too clearly why she had been trying to contact Steve. What was more, Happy, one of his oldest friends, had plainly swallowed her version of the story – whatever it happened to be – whole.
"As for you two, stay here and I'll debrief you later."
"You don't need your purse when you're with me," Tony pointed out, even as Jan slipped into her shoes and unearthed her purse from under a coffee table. "You can show me the latest hotspots, though." He'd gotten out of touch because he'd found he'd rather spend time with Steve, and Pepper when she was in New York, and neither of them were interested in bars and clubs. Indeed, Pepper's foot was tapping which only hastened his exit with Jan on his arm.
There was good wine, though Steve noticed – because he worried a little about the amount Tony drank – that his companion was sampling both it and the food in moderation, almost abstinence for him.
Clea's face was blank.
. Your cerebral cortex wasn't operating. It didn't re-boot until the serum had healed it. Which is a perfectly good explanation for your loss of memory! If they hadn't wanted the serum they'd have turned off life support a year ago. So even if this stupid theory of yours is right, Steve, he's dead. If he ever existed at all."
Memory came flooding back, making him sicker than the after effects of T'Challa's drug.
"That's it! Fury is—" Tony bit off his words and Steve had the suspicion that that sentence was going to end in a threat. "And Bruce? Is there anything about Bruce?"
"That you two have broken up? Yes."
"Way to go, King Kong. Green Kong. If you don't like the decor I can get the contractors in—"
"Leave him. We still have to deal with the Panther, our audience – and Stark."
A new timeline.
Steve shook his head. "There's a chance. You know there's a chance. So why are you helping me?"
It drained all the tension out of Steve. He said, "If I get pneumonia, it's your fault."
Wordlessly, Tony passed the full glass to him.
"Five hundred miles or so out in the Atlantic. Yes, I know. Unfortunately, this is the second attempt to fuel this aircraft. I was seriously considering going home and getting in the suit."
"I'm fine," Tony said, though he was shaking, not so much with cold as with anger, not at Steve but at his own stupidity. He knew Steve had a temper, knew he kept it under strict control just
The woman who stepped out in front of him was tall and slender with strawberry-blonde hair in a slightly untidy chignon and a dusting of freckles not at all disguised by her minimal make-up. She was wearing a skirt short enough to make Steve to avert his eyes, though not before he had taken in the shapeliness of her legs or that she was barefoot and so even taller than he had supposed. Unfortunately, raising his eyes meant he saw that her striped cotton blouse was unbuttoned far enough to reveal the top curves of her breasts.
"There's an alien device – machine – artefact, I don't know. A... friend of mine sent it to me because he couldn't figure out anything about it, couldn't make it do anything. Neither could I, until I touched it by accident, had a really weird experience. Soon after, you woke up."
"You must be very proud of your son."
"You keep calling me something else."
Almost overnight, Avengers Tower, as he was trying to persuade everyone to call it, had become a centre of cutting edge research. How had that happened?
Tony propped himself up on his elbows, and saw that the Ancient One was sitting on the floor a few feet away, one hand clasping the amulet containing the Time Stone, the other pressed to her forehead. He caught Natasha's eye and nodded towards the Ancient One, even as the nanites swarmed over his back, down his legs and up his arms.
"The one where Margaret Carter is buried?"
Though, since he had met Presidents and Prime Ministers and Generals and Admirals who were now legends, and not been intimidated by any of them, there was no reason his stomach should lurch like this.
"You were the man in Washington, the one who hacked my systems!" Tony exclaimed, half in anger, half in admiration and wholly as a distraction because Steve could not answer without giving away his identity.
"Have we been spotted?" Steve asked.
To his delight, he'd made Betty chuckle. "I'm sorry to trouble you over there in LaLa land," she said. "Have I interrupted anything?"
It seemed only fair to turn his head and remark to Steve, "Nah, they would have had angry sex and then make-up sex." Even as he spoke he wondered where his control had gone. Steve's expression had frozen, and the hand on Tony's back stilled, as if he was in shock.
"Reality, Space and Power," Tony said helpfully.
"Are you blaming SHIELD again?" Pepper's hold on her temper seemed to be slipping, but Tony wasn't going to be intimidated.
"Deal."
"That is where the problem arises, sir. He is supposedly in Washington, working as an aide to the Joint Chiefs."
Not to mention forbidding.
"And Zemo knew his trigger word. But isn't that something that you should have anticipated? Or at least considered before you took on the world? After all, you knew – better than anyone – that even if he wasn't completely the Winter Soldier any more, he wasn't wholly James Barnes either."
"Boss," Friday's voice said. "Captain Rogers has just entered the building through your private garage. May I remind you that you have not changed those entry codes."
"Not a joke." Tony kissed the back of his neck
"You weren't wishing for anything in particular, were you?" Steve asked, then held his breath.
"Yes. Mr Stark is in the process of completely rearranging the building so all of the Avengers will have personal suites, among other things. It was one of the things he and Ms Potts disagreed about. He did not consult her about that – or the renaming of the tower."
"They may not know that. Even so, I'd rather not take a commercial flight to New York or Washington and put other people in danger, particularly when we have Betty with us, and I'm certainly not going to leave either her or you on your own—"
"Can I watch you from there?"
"No. It's Jan's. Ms Van Dyne's. Steve and I came here on one sent by White Wolf."
"Yeah," he said. "I've been in their hands, but those were thugs in a cave, not sophisticated, not scientists, so maybe this weather is natural..."
Ignoring Roberta, Fury stared into Howard's eyes: "Other people have high-powered lawyers, Stark."
Pepper wasn't there very often, but Happy applied himself with grim determination. Being outclassed by the Black Widow apparently rankled in a way that being outclassed by Steve did not.
"Thank..." Steve swallowed the word 'God' afraid that it might be regarded as an insult. But that didn't matter. Thor's word was good. Tony was safe. That was all that really mattered. He slipped into sleep.
"My lady says it is made of uru, and is the work of dwarvish smiths. Is your magic armour made of such metal?"
It was obviously a sincere question and deserved a truthful answer. "The super-soldier serum in your blood."
Jarvis said nothing, though he gave a deep, exasperated sigh, which was quite an achievement for a being with no lungs. Seconds later, the helmet was filled with Iron Maiden.
They were on to the dessert course when Tony finally finished what had become an extremely detailed briefing. "Wow," Steve said. "Was I away for a couple of years?"
Steve seemed to enjoy his company, whether he was talking or silent.
For a moment he wished for the familiarity of the clothes SHIELD had provided for him, but he had realised, even before he  moved into the Tower, that the contrast between his apparent age and the outdated look had made him far too noticeable. He didn't need to be asked again if he was from some sort of fundamentalist religious community. So he'd left them in his SHIELD apartment, together with the uniform they'd given him.
"Almost certainly," the Panther agreed, "but until a person risks taking it, in raw form or brewed into a draught, they cannot know for certain that they will survive."
"Don't bet on that," Bruce said dryly, taking bananas from a bowl on the workbench and a mango from the crisper.
The Penthouse was empty. Tony took one look at the Master bedroom where all of Pepper's presence had been stripped away, and fled.
"Yes, Ancient One."
"Missing in action."
Laid out on the floor was a thirty foot disarticulated model of one of the giant Chitauri spacecraft that had come streaming through the Tesseract portal.
"You know I did."
Tony bit back further argument. They were in battle, which meant Steve called the shots. Also, he happened to be right. But he had never found that fact so difficult to accept. Somehow, he restricted himself to, "Take care, Cap," and lifted off into the skies.
"Steve, darling, every time you look at him your face lights up, and when you lose his attention you have to get it right back. And Tony has it just as bad. And has for longer. Back in Oklahoma, when you said he didn't flirt with you – though I noticed he couldn't stop himself occasionally – I knew he must be worried that either you would take it seriously, or that Pepper would."
"The idea crashed and burned. Think of what the FAA would have said. I had enough trouble—" Tony applied the brakes hard, so the War Machine shot ahead, spun the car on its axis and headed back up the road. The gates and their guards were a better proposition for cover. "—with getting permissions for the armour."
