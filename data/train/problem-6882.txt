“What nosy personal stuff?”  Natasha instantly stiffened. “What am I going to be dealing with, Rogers?”
Sam laid his hand on Steve’s arm, stilling him.  “You and I both know what this game and this league does to people.  I pushed too hard for something you weren’t ready to share, and that’s on me.”  He eyeballed Steve, something else clearly on the tip of his tongue.
Sharon turned her attention back to him as Wanda slipped out of the room, presumably to finish whatever she was posting about him on Instagram.  “Now, Steve, there’s a few things I need to know, just so I’m aware of all the pieces on the board, okay?”
“Any insight?” Bucky prodded.  “His preseason film’s not really a match for what we’re seeing today.”
“As practical as that solution sounds, I can really only go with someone who wants to work with me,” Steve pointed out.  He pulled the box he’d been using the last four years for German flashcards out of his desk. Behind each lettered divider, the nouns, adjectives, and verbs had all given way to a host of business cards, each from someone who claimed they’d be able to make him a household name in the NFL.  They each represented a clamor for his attention that grated on him and made his palms sweat whenever he opened the box. “What’s his name? I’ll see if I’ve heard from him.”
“But it’s good to know who a guy is off the field.  That he’s someone who was raised right.”  Rashad said and waved the scanning gun to emphasize his point.  “None of these weirdos like that Hernandez guy.”
Steve leaned down and kissed Tony soft and slow, pulling back with a quiet smile.  “For letting me be a dork who bought his mom a Clapper for her birthday.”
Steve stopped where he was wiping down the countertop to give Sam his full attention.  “I put you in that position, though, which wasn’t fair to you.”
“That’s just because I’m saving the best for last,” Tony said smoothly.  “Well, the best for today.”
Skipping lunch meant he was starving now, but he forced himself to only put one of the dinners he’d prepped for the week in the oven to heat.  He leaned on the counter while he waited and scrolled idly through his notifications. Tony had texted partway through the day.
“Which guy?” Steve asked blankly.
Sam caught him around the shoulders.  “You are a good egg, Mr. Steve.”
Thank you to each and every one of you who comes back week after week, reads, leaves kudos, writes such kind comments.  Y'all truly give me life :)
“Of--of course,” he stammered.
“Oh.”  Tony got up.  “I guess I’d better--”
Steve clenched his jaw, determined to keep himself under control.  “Absolutely nothing.”
Fury nodded.  “So what we were talking about with a team like Atlanta…”
“Say that three times fast,” Steve murmured.
on a Sunday morning pre-game show.”
Bucky nodded.  “We look out for our own.  And you’re one of us now.”

“I see you gettin’ cocky, rookie!” Dum Dum shot back.
.  And, I mean, I don’t know if you’ve ever watched it…?”
Steve rolled to sit up.  “I’m, um, I’m not sure--”
Reply from
Tony shook his head.  “Not always.  But today was a damn nightmare of meetings and calls and trying to ensure people were going to be able to meet deadlines on deliverables and just...bullshit that all meant I didn’t want to be running around in dress shoes all day.”
“Sorry, Coach,” Steve replied.  “Won’t happen again.” He waited until Phillips turned to the o-line to remind them that they knew how to create creases and blew Jamaal a kiss back.
She pulled open the door to the conference room and gestured him through.  “Right in here.”
“I thought you were kidding,” he said.
“Not the only reason, I hope,” Tony retorted pertly.
“Pretty bad,” Bucky confirmed.  “I got a lot more responsibility after J.Joe had that career-ender last year, and the talking heads were all over me.  Didn’t help, of course, that he and I were teaming up on some double coverage when he went down.  So ‘do you feel responsible?’ wasn’t
“What about it?” Steve asked, voice barely audible in the mellow darkness around them.
Steve swallowed the last bite of his burger and licked a dab of mustard off his thumb.  “I think that random undrafted free agent is what I’m most...not worried about, but…”
“But if it’s gotten aggravated…?” Sam wondered.
the way you think.  You’re not tied to some kind of--of
Tony’s typing bubbles popped up then disappeared three times before his reply came through.
“Can we use your footballs to play?”
Steve laughed and shifted towards Tony like they were sharing secrets.  “I thought when people had a midlife crisis they bought a car.”
doing good work helping them.”
Tony burst out laughing, then kissed Steve again.  “Or I could just tell you.”
Steve nodded down at his still-clenched hands.  “And I...I know who I am and what I want, but...” he looked up at Tony, his eyes begging him to hear him.  “I want you to know it too.  From me.  Not someone else.”
A flicker of motion at the edge of Steve’s attention had him glancing over to the door where Sharon Carter gently tapped her watch then made a ‘wrap it up’ gesture.  Steve breathed a sigh of relief, and Fitz smiled generously at the assembled media reps as they stood.  “We really appreciate your interest in how we’re developing as a team.  I have to say, I can’t wait for Sunday.  We’re gonna have a great season.”
Anyone else wondering why we drafted a QB instead of a WR when we’ve got Fitz?
Steve smiled.  “You know you two have all the subtlety of a brick to the face,” he said.  He held up a hand to stop them when they both opened their mouths to deny it.  “The woman who came today was a potential agent.”
“Steve?”  Sam’s quiet voice from the kitchen door made him jump just a little.
Scott shrugged, undeterred.  “Size isn’t everything. I led the FCS in receptions and yards per catch this past season.  Didn’t go till the fifth round, though, so, y’know, gotta grind.”
“So…?”
If you need a place when you get to New York (congratulations on that by the way...looking forward to working with you), mom and I converted the third floor into a furnished rental while I was still in high school, and it’s empty right now.
“Tight end,” Scott replied, beaming.
Damn Natasha.  He should’ve known she’d leverage the bits of himself that suited her purposes to get what she wanted.  “Yes, ma’am.”
“Money and weather.”  Steve picked at a loose thread on the seam of the couch cushion while he tried to figure out what to say that wouldn’t sound deeply self pitying. “I like sunny weather and not having student loan debt. Texas made me an offer that meant I could have both.”
“Exactly,” Clint agreed.  “They’ll take care of you.”
First off, thank you for your patience with this chapter...I got to Thursday last week and it was still only half written, and I had to admit to myself that I could either force out a bleh chapter or I could wait a hot ass second and give you something worth reading.  I chose the second option.
lose control of this.  Not just for my sake.”
ready.  Okay?”
“Most, but not all, right?” he asked, cracking one eye open to catch her gaze.
“What’d petite and brunette want?” Sam asked when they were finally on their way home for the evening.
He shrugged.  “Sure. I gotta say though, if you’re in the market for an agent, my cousin Kyler got really lucky with his guy.  Dude’s like a second dad. If you can get with him, I’d say do that.”
this whole draft process was a racket?” Steve asked with a laugh.
“I’m afraid to let you touch anything back here,” he mumbled with another glance at that pristine suit before turning back to his diagram to see where he’d left off.
Bucky shook the chair, sending Steve waggling weirdly back and forth.  “You--you’re…” his voice dropped to a whisper “are you
Steve laughed and let himself be pulled back towards the penthouse.  “This isn’t your smoothest move.”
The line went dead in his ear right before Tony himself appeared right next to Steve.  “Hey there, Sporty Spice.”  He squatted down then leaned over and rested his cheek on Steve’s shoulder and breathed him in.  “Yeah, you do smell like outside.”
Pepper squeezed his hand and smiled warmly.  “Pepper, please. We’re so excited to bring you home to play for your friends and family.”
Thank you for your kind comments and kudos.  They brighten my day whenever I see them in my inbox.  Feel free to come flail about sports, Marvel, or sporty Marvel over on my tumblar (longhornletters).
Steve smiled.  “I bet she loved it.”
I know you said you’d be getting into town on Friday evening, but I’m on shift till 7.  If you don’t mind waiting till I’m off, I’ll bring the keys and some dinner by the house.
“You got WiFi, Friday Night Lights?”
Sam shot him a sideways look.  “You gonna do it?”
Tony rolled his eyes.  “Don’t be obtuse, it doesn’t suit you.”  He propped his chin on top of his hands folded across Steve’s chest.  “The guy who...who’s willing to show people that the five in any locker room’s a real thing.”
“Jocasta, did you burn my tower down?” Tony asked as he made for the front of the shop
“I didn’t think he had to,” Tony replied evenly.
Sounds good.  I’ll see you around 7:30.
“I don’t know what your idea of a good time is.”  Tony shrugged, defensiveness creeping into his voice.
Bucky laughed.  “Why d’you think I got hurt?  Had to slow myself down.”
.  Promise.”
He nodded idly, content to let her ruthless efficiency carry him along, at least for tonight.
Steve closed his eyes and let himself sink into sensation as Tony bent and started trailing kisses haphazardly down his neck and across his chest.  He paused to lick at Steve’s nipple, the edge of teeth making Steve arch and gasp.
“Why football?”
HUGE thanks as always to betheflame and kestrel337 for tireless cheer, beta, and, to quote Bertie Wooster "just general thing-ness."  You two are amazing.
Welcome to New York and welcome home, Steve Rogers!
Bucky shook his head.  “Not a second longer if you don’t want.”
“Mmhmm,” Bucky nodded.  “Spit it out.”
“Do what?”
Steve shot her a questioning look, hardly daring to hope.  “You think?”
“Which ones?” Tony pressed.
As Steve went through his reads, Hopkins was the most open, a half step off his defender, so he pulled back and let fly with the pass.  He got under it, got a hand on it, bobbled it once...twice...before the free safety reached a hand in and batted the ball out of his reach.  The head ref whistled the play dead.  Instead of trotting the offense back out for the last two seconds of the game, the Serpents and Avengers all just broke from the sideline and started shaking on the game.
“Coach.  I didn’t know you were going to be here this weekend.”
“So, if this is a date,” Steve said, deliberately ignoring Tony’s bait.  He’d felt like they’d been circling around this very thing, and he wanted it.  Good God he wanted it.  He dropped onto the couch in the front room then patted the cushion next to him.  “Can I ask you something?”
Steve stood to take his next shot, cursing the act-don’t-think streak his mom had scolded him about every time he’d come home with a black eye and bloody knuckles in junior high.  Apparently he still had it. He glared down at the little crosshairs on the ball as if the black cross and red circle were mocking him. Using his swing to punish the ball didn’t make him feel much better either.  He watched his ball bounce into the net lit up white to avoid having to face Tony a little longer, but the sound of him clearing his throat forced Steve to turn around.
Steve retreated to his locker and started stripping off his game gear, making a pile of dirty clothes for the equipment team and a pile he’d need to take home and wash himself.  He hustled through a quick shower, nodding silent thanks when Scott let him jump on an open spot first.  When he made it back to his locker, most of the offensive starters were hanging around his locker.
“Miller got you some decent field position on that kickoff.  Don’t waste it.”
“What’s goin’ on with those holding calls?  And why did we let Rollins go?” Fitz groused as he hung his helmet and grabbed some water.  “Guy’s a brick wall.”
Steve watched the side of Bucky’s upturned face for nearly a full minute before he felt like he could take a full breath.  He coiled up tighter, willing his breathing to remain steady as he pulled his phone out.  He smiled at the text Tony had sent so late last night it had actually tipped over into early morning.
“See somethin’ you like?” Steve asked over his shoulder.
Sam immediately jumped up to follow.  “Say what?”
“About as smooth as inviting yourself over to my house the weekend I moved in.”  Steve grinned.
Tony made a face.  “I’ll take your word for it.”
Steve laughed.  “You think?”
“Sure,” Tony agreed easily.  He resettled a little lower on Steve’s chest so he could lay on his side.
That night, Brennan and Devin, two of his receivers, burst into Steve’s room, all boisterous greetings and friendly slaps to his shoulder.  Their arrival also had the blessed result of stopping him from fiddling with his digital portfolio for probably the tenth time.
gonna go eat on the patio.”  He jabbed a fork into his bowl and grabbed the jar of tahini before stalking out the back door and closing it sharply behind him.
“So,” Tony laughed.  “I know--intimately--what editing does to people.  To what they say and mean and what people end up hearing and thinking.  I’m not saying it’ll be easy, but I am saying I know better than to just--just believe what someone who’s not directly involved with my life is saying about my life.”
“Let’s go grill and chill.”
Steve chuckled.  “The media room?”
When the timer went off on his phone, a quick jiggle of the pan told him his dinner was ready, or at least not likely to give him salmonella, so he pulled it out.  “Want any?”
Stark waved his hand.  “Tony, please. Mr. Stark was my father, and let’s be honest, someone like him had no business with this kind of control over other people’s lives.”
Steve grabbed the knife as its handle wobbled past and put it in the dishwasher, tossed a Cascade pack into the door and started the cycle before turning and leaning back against the kitchen counter, one ankle crossed over the other.  “Probably praying for the sweet release of death if the start of literally every other season of my playing career is any indication.” He eyed Tony from head to toe and back again. “Why?”
She nodded.  “Sharon sent me to come looking for you.  If you’ll come with me?”
“I’ve never seen
“I really don’t want to be the bad guy here,” Sharon addressed all of them.  “My team and I are here for you just like the coaches and support staff are. Please don’t hesitate to ask us any questions you have.  You have my team’s contact details on your tablet. Let us help you.”
“Coding for what?” Steve asked idly as he pulled up the run offense section of the playbook.  He started drawing the offense’s lineup before reaching into the bowl he had sitting on the table under the white board.  3-4 nickel.  He hated nickel packages; it always felt like there were twelve defenders in a nickel read.
*Rocks up a fucking *month* later with Starbucks* "What's up, y'all?!"  And now for the ACTUAL notes...
to find myself in your area and I wanted to see if I could come pick you up so we could go over to mine and watch a movie?”
The drive over into New Jersey ended up being quicker than Steve anticipated, even in rush hour traffic, and in less than an hour they were turning into the Avengers practice complex on the other side of the expressway from MetLife Stadium.  It wasn’t until they were pulling into a spot at the practice facility though that the full reality of Avengers fan loyalty hit.
“You ready, pal?” Bucky asked before Dolores could answer.
“Hey, Gunslinger, what’s the good word?”
“Why,” Sam demanded from the top of the stairs, “ is the
“Nothin’.  Mind your business,” Bucky yelled back.  He turned back to Steve.  “Seriously.  I don’t care who it is, they don’t treat you right, they can answer to me.  Also, this isn’t my business to tell, so don’t worry about any of..that.”  He eyeballed Steve one more time before he flopped back down.  “You look happy.  Looks good on ya.”
to be an adult.  And if ESPN sticks their nose where it quite clearly doesn’t belong, I want to work through that together too.”
“Hey, uh, what’re you doing next weekend?” Tony asked, pushing a knife in a slow circle on the countertop.
In the huddle, Fury was all business.  “We have to assume Fitz won’t be coming back today.  That means Rogers, you’re it.”  He looked at all of them, meeting each man’s gaze before he spoke again.  “Now we’re gonna finish, and we’re gonna finish strong.  You all know the looks these guys have been giving us, so you should be able to capitalize.”
“Media room.”
We’re all so proud of you and we can’t wait till you’re home.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Doesn’t look like ‘no one.’  Smiling at your phone like that”
The ball hit his hands cleanly, and he handed off smoothly.  He dropped back going through his pass prep motion as if he still had the ball in hand, and smiled as the free safety took the bait and came straight for him.  The center and the right guard started pushing toward the far sideline while the right tackle pushed towards the near sideline. Jamaal slipped through the gap they made like it was nothing.  A stutter step and he was free. He made it a few yards past the down marker before a couple of the Tigers’ secondary brought him down, but it didn’t matter. It was enough.
“We had a few guys who did football and track at Texas,” Steve pointed out, raking a comb through his hair.
“I’ll do what now?” A woman with short curly hair asked as she came in off the back patio.
Steve whirled back from where he’d been digging the salad and dressing out of the fridge and slammed the bowl of salad down on the kitchen counter.  “It’s finally cooled off, so
Heeey, so I want to warn you about a couple things in this chapter.
Steve offered him a thin smile.  “I can do that.”
Once Tony was gone, Steve sighed.  This had been nice.  More than, really, but he couldn’t just play around and just...ignore the consequences.  Sharon and Natasha’s warnings about avoiding off-field drama reared up and blocked out everything else.  He rolled over until he was face down on the couch and groaned into the cushions.  Hooking up with a man, the man who owned his team no less, would definitely complicate his on-field life.
“How so?” Steve asked, his voice already going fuzzy with sleep.
“Yes you would,” Steve murmured against Tony’s temple before he dropped a kiss on the same spot.
“Did’ya have a good afternoon yesterday?” Bucky asked deceptively idly.
Pepper’s thin smile gave nothing away.  “We’ve discussed our priorities as an organization thoroughly.”
~~*~~
“We’ve got a strong O-line,” Clint offered.
Author’s Notes:
Steve sighed.  “Is it gonna be conspicuous?”
“Cherry red like this deserves whitewalls,” Tony agreed as he reached out to run his hand gently over the cracked paint on the rear wheel fender.
Also, there's some derogatory language in this chapter.  I don’t think it should really come as a shock to any of y’all that football fans can be some of the most toxically masculine folks out there, and that’s gonna come out (no pun intended) with Steve being out.  If that’s the sort of thing you’re not a fan of, just skip over the Twitter segment.  It’s just a little end-of-chapter artifact, so you’re not missing a lick of plot, no worries.
Steve grinned over his shoulder at Tony’s delighted face.  “And if I am?”
Steve laughed.  “So two-a-days in August aren’t your thing?”
“I’m glad you came over today,” Steve murmured.  “I had a good time.”
“Just tell me?” Steve asked.
“Is pocket sand an option?” he asked himself as he trundled down the stairs to get the door.  He prayed Sam would just leave it, but he did also understand Sam’s confusion.  Team owners did not take this much of a personal interest in a new draftee this long after signing and this long before the season actually started.
Steve bit his lip and made a terrible decision.
“Don’t want it.  Won’t take it.”
Steve mentions self-harm at one point, and while he's mostly joking, that's a really *really* dark thing to say.  I read several articles and essays while I was working on this chapter written by former NFL players who came out after they retired and, to a man, they all described the deep depression of having to work so hard to stay closeted.  This is a real issue among professional athletes, not only athletes who are struggling with their sexuality.  Please feel free to skip from "'Oh, definitely,' Bucky agreed with a nod" to "'Hey, assholes,' Dugan shouted..." because your health and wellbeing is the most important thing.
Steve
Tony nodded.  “When I bought the ‘32 roadster, she was an absolute mess.  The tires looked like a dried up riverbed.  Is that what you had here?”
Look at that smile.  I might literally cry if he’s got a GF 😍💦
Back inside, Tony gestured back the way they had come in.  “You saw that half.”
They lapsed back into silence, except for the pounding of their shoes on the pavement, and Steve let Bucky’s words roll around his head.  It made sense, Steve supposed, that face recognition would increase faster here, especially since the Avengers media team had done their introduction for the new players on social media.  This was, he supposed, the moment his life truly stopped being his own.
Tony pointed at the motorcycle sitting under a tarp on the little paved patio.  “So you keep a horse under that cover then?”
Bucky nodded.  “Good point, Dot.”  He turned to the rest of the players who’d been trickling in and getting set up with dogs of their own.  “Howlies we ready?”
Rollins nodded and moved off, and Steve started casting around for Danvers.  He saw her on the edge of the milling teams speaking with one of the Serpents’ coaches.  Before he could make his way over, though, Bucky grabbed his elbow.
The patio lights had come on as daylight had faded, and now the backyard was lit a soft gold in the gathering darkness, interrupted only by the icy blue glow of the suit’s eyes and chest.  Steve kicked his feet up on one of the empty chairs and cradled his dinner in his lap.  Iron Man swept its gaze slowly towards him, stared for a moment then moved on.  He sighed.  Logically, he could understand why both Sam and Tony were snappish, but he’d learned a long time ago that the more people knew a secret, the less likely it would actually

“Just tell me what I’m dealing with, and let me decide about flipping out.”
Leaving aside the vagaries of injury and circumstance, here’s who to watch for on every team, and who to watch out for.
“What was it like to win a national title?”
Steve shrugged.  “Well, sure, I mean--”
Once they’d hauled everything down and shoved it in the cargo area of Bucky’s SUV, he turned to Steve.  “You got any allergies or dietary restrictions?”
Steve nodded.  “I’d called and spoken to Carla about getting two small pieces done?”
Steve laughed.  “You shoulda’ seen my hands and feet.  I looked like a rottweiler puppy.”
“Sure.”
“No, you weren’t,” Bucky agreed.  “But, they are gonna try to restart the ‘quarterback controversy’ angle.”
“Ringing endorsement,” Tony murmured against the base of his throat before he swooped back up to kiss Steve again.  He took advantage of the way Steve’s spine curved towards him to wrap his arms around Steve and squeeze him closer.
Tony looked up at Steve from where he’d been kneeling to peer at the engine, clearly impressed.  “Oh really?”
“I’ll let you hold the coaches’ trophy if you promise me you won’t drop it.”
“Y-yeah, we’re...friends.”
Interestingly, the Avengers’ biggest weakness, although ‘question’ might be more accurate, comes at quarterback.  While veteran Ryan Fitzsimmons is a steady hand on offense, rumors of a nagging knee injury have overshadowed his performance in the preseason.  A veteran offensive line with franchise tag Volstagg at center and returner M’Baku backed up by Thor, who puts on the Avengers uniform for the first time in his career, cannot stop every sack, so it is a question of when, not if, Fitzsimmons will go down hard.  If his knee turns into an issue that keeps him from starting in the regular season, the new question becomes whether rookie backup Steve Rogers is up to the challenge.  With a journeyman who looks to be on his last legs backed up by an untested rookie, there is a lot that needs answering at this, arguably the most pivotal, position.
“Later, boys,” Pepper said.  She handed Steve an Avengers hat and motioned Fury back over.  “Wear that. Hold the jersey with Nick. Smile at the cameras.”
Thank you for all of your kind words and continued support.  I'm humbled every update when y'all come back and leave me such lovely, thoughtful, excited comments.
.  Steve
“I already know I’m a lost cause,” he replied.  “My little cousins all asked for signed UCLA jerseys this past Christmas.  And they all got ‘em.”
“Look, son, just hear what she’s got to say.  You can say yes. You can say maybe. Hell, you can tell her you’re leaving football forever after our season ends.”
“Sure...let’s go with that,” Tony replied with a smirk.
Steve's smile was all fondness when he responded.
“Be right back with the rest,” Tony tossed over his shoulder.  A few moments later he was back, setting the rest of their glasses on the counter.  He leaned on the counter and watched Steve work for a bit before he spoke. “Got everything settled?”
Once the door shut behind him, Carla rolled back, stencil and razor in hand.  “That was lucky,” she said with a conspiratorial smirk then bent to start shaving the skin under his collarbone.
Tony blinked at him, imitating confusion.  “Oh, I didn’t realize you were his chaperone.”
Steve blushed scarlet when Tony wrapped his hands around Steve’s to show him how to hold the club so it wouldn’t slide around in his grip.  Tony’s hands were smaller than his, but their calm competence made them seem all encompassing where they settled around Steve’s.
Steve nodded and took the clipboard when he finally released it.  “I am.”
Steve poked him in the sides, making Tony jump and laugh.  “You know what I mean.  You don’t do anything just because.”
Thor beamed.  “I was indeed.  Guard. Unfortunately, cap space is a difficult thing on a team with so many veterans, so I decided to seek my fortunes elsewhere.  I’m pleased to meet so many new offensive hires since we’ll be working together.”
“I could be,” he said, quietly pleased Tony had hung around to wait for him.
“Now explain again why we’re having a bike rally as our kickoff event?” Sam asked as he and Steve piled off the subway and headed up the station stairs in the midst of a throng of Avengers fans.
“It’s not like that,” he insisted.  Just to be on the safe side, he jammed his phone between his leg and the couch.  Let Sam come after it now.
Steve shook his head again.  “Nope.”
“Steve Rogers?” A woman in a snappy red sheath stopped Steve with a gentle hand on his arm.  “I’m Margaret Carter with the USO.  Your agent, Mis Romanoff gave me your name.”
“Swearing only means you don’t have anything more intelligent to say,” he retorted primly, which only made his receivers laugh harder.
“We’d never have made it without you, Coach,” Steve said as he brought the trophy back down, patted it once, then passed it back to Phillips.  “You brought out the best in us.”
“I don’t think eating dinner is the answer you’re looking for,” Steve said.
Thanks as always to the inimitable betheflame and kestrel337 for awesome beta and cheer help.  I would not be nearly as entertaining without them.
“Here or in general?”
Steve draped his arm around Tony’s shoulders and tugged him in close.  “Sam’s gonna sic Cage on me if we wake him up.”
Steve nodded.  “Fair enough.”
“Sure.  I did promise you dinner and a movie.  I just didn’t say what order they’d happen.”  Tony steered Steve into a surprisingly cozy room and pushed him down onto the couch.  Steve went willingly and let the springs of the couch bounce him gently when he landed.  “How do you feel about horror?”
Steve nodded.  “I do.”
“Okay then.”  Tony pinched the meat of Steve’s forearm then waited until Steve met his eyes.  “I’m...not in my twenties anymore, and I promise you I still let my mouth run away with itself.  All the time. You didn’t mean what you said the way I took it.”
“See!”  He trailed after Steve around the table and slid into the chair next to him.  “Wait, schooled me?”
“I just don’t want you to end up owing someone else instead,” she insisted quietly.
Inside, Steve was in the process of filling bowls from the slow cooker when he heard Sam’s feet on the stairs.  He sighed.  Sam probably wouldn’t be teasing him about “your girl” for very much longer.
“Uh, could you just share them with me on Google Drive and I’ll make sure she sees them?” he asked sheepishly.  He’d finally worked up the nerve to deactivate his mom’s email address last month. The concept of reopening it felt like digging a knife into a just-healed wound
“Shawarma bowl,” Steve answered around a mouthful of food.  He pushed the jar he’d brought out with him towards Tony.  “Put that on it.  It’ll change your life.”
“Yeah, okay,” Bucky agreed, putting the picture back.  “Don’t think I’ll be forgetting about this come rookie hazing though,” he promised with a gesture at the ample evidence of Steve’s drastically undersized youth.
Sam laughed softly.  “I mean other people.”  He squeezed Steve’s shoulders one more time.  “I’m going to bed.  Don’t wake me up with any noises I can’t unhear or I’ll make sure Cage takes it out on you in the weightroom tomorrow.”
“Of course he is.”  Steve agreed readily.  He dragged his fingers through Tony’s hair, letting the soft slide of his fingers settle them both while he tried to figure out what he wanted to say.  “You know the saying ‘three can keep a secret if two of them are dead’?”
“You probably won’t be number one,” Natasha murmured as they finally took their seats at the table reserved for them.
“Hey, hey.”  Bucky grabbed the corner of the hammock chair and tugged it towards him.  “You are way more wound up than this question deserves.  What’s goin’ on, dude?”
“Yeah.  It’s built into my genes.  Like having double jointed elbows.”
“Oh, it’s not that,” Steve felt his face heat and he grimaced at himself.  Well, it
“TopGolf?” Tony offered.

Once they were inside, Steve had passed from interviewer to interviewer on the way to his seat, giving his same canned answers about how pleased and excited he was to be here and that he hoped to be able to contribute effectively to whichever team selected him.  Natasha had hovered silently in the shadows, ready, he assumed, to swoop in and save him if he stuck his foot too far in his mouth, but she needn’t have worried.
Tony shook his head.  “It’s a miniaturized arc reactor.”
Tony nodded.  “I programmed it to turn the pages when she’d nod at it.  She called it Player...like a player-piano.”  He hugged Steve closer.  “I’d gotten too big to squeeze onto the bench with her and turn the pages myself…”
Cynthia nodded.  “I don’t know much about it myself, I’m afraid.  My husband’s the sports fan in our house. Him and our boys.  They’ve been looking forward to this for weeks. Can’t wait to tell them I had a player in my car.”
“Well thank you.  That’s really sweet of you.”  She got out, and Steve came around to stand next to her.
“Sure, what were you thinking?”  Steve asked.
Steve fished the redacted document Karen had copied for him out of his wallet before he took a seat in her chair.  “Yeah.  Turned out I had a gal on the inside.”
Pietro shook his head.  “We’ve found basic human decency carries the day rather well in the wake of injuries like this.  They’ll be fishing, but from everything I’ve seen, you’ve got a canny nose for their bait.”
With that, they stood to go.  Fury nodded once at him, like Steve had passed some sort of silent test.  Pepper patted his shoulder and murmured another word of welcome. Tony, though, shot him a completely self-satisfied smirk and a wink, and Steve felt himself flush all over again.
“Morbid, but yes.”
Fitz rolled his eyes.  “See if she’s still sayin’ that once you bobble a pass some sports talking head says should’ve been an easy catch.”
This isn’t a football thing, but Lady Ace was the name of one of the choppers used in the US evacuation of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War, so that’s what I’ve named my fake banh mi restaurant.
Thanks as always to betheflame and kestrel337 for incomparable help as soundboards, cheer readers, hand holders, and ass kickers.  This fic is getting drafted in the first round because of y'all.
Steve set down his trophy and the rose Dallas had given him.  “Promise, Coach.” Phillips passed over the shockingly heavy Waterford Crystal football, and for a moment, all Steve could do was stare at the way the stadium lights refracted through the beveled edges of the cutwork.
“Shoot.”
“A team headed into what looks to be the second year of a rebuild,” Carol added.
“Abraham Erskine?” Steve asked.  He drummed his fingers on the top of the box while his mind raced ahead.  If Dev’s cousin was so thrilled with him, surely Natasha merited a closer look.
Steve nodded in the direction of a couple who’d started pedaling their swan shaped boat to get a better angle on them as they ran past.
Again, the Nacho Cheese playlist is a real thing.  It’s, according to my work bestie, “all those songs you know and love, but don’t wanna admit you know or love.”  He’s right.  Every single one’s simultaneously a banger and a disaster.
“How’s his knee?” Steve asked Carol when Fitz left with the rest of the captains for the coin toss and the rest of the team had scattered to their last-minute prep.
Steve laughed as he felt a blush heat his face.  “It was the first birthday present I ever bought my ma with my own money.  I thought it was the coolest thing, being able to turn your lights on all at once like that.”
Steve peeked up from where he’d hidden his face in the couch.  “Not freaking out.”
“Always the prelude to something fuckin’ rude, you realize.”
“Of course you’re still here,” T’Challa materialized in the fourth seat at their table, protein shake in hand.  “Fury wouldn’t let an arm and a mind like yours go so easily.  Especially not…” he raised an eyebrow as if that should convey the rest of his sentence.
He nodded.  “Of course.”  He glanced back at the kids straggling behind her.  “You know my rules?”
Tony gaped at Steve’s lean, muscular frame.  “Jesus Christ, where does it
today was going to be a lot of spectacle, but he wasn’t quite prepared for the sense of anticipation that flooded him when he saw the cheerleaders lined up, fully decked out like it was gameday, shaking their poms and smiling. Combine them with the fans, and the thumping bass from “Thunderstruck” that was pouring through the speakers, and it finally clicked.
Tony’s hum of acknowledgement reverberated through his chest.  “That’s good, that’s good--”
Instead of launching straight into her spiel, she spent a moment at the computer consulting with Pietro while he was pulling up a slideshow for her.  Once he got it started, she turned the full force of her gaze on them. “My name is Maria Hill, and I’m the director of pro personnel. We’re going to spend a good bit of time together during the next ten days because as new NFL players, I’m legally obligated to inform you of your rights, responsibilities, and the best practices as a salaried member of the NFL Player’s Association.  We’re going to touch broadly on those things today, but we’ll go into extensive detail over the coming two weeks.”
She shook her head.  “Never finished my degree.  I figured out about halfway through that with the amount of time I spent drawing during class instead of taking notes, social work probably wasn’t for me.”
Steve smiled down at his phone.
The shuffle of their dissipating footsteps forced Steve to turn back to his head coach.  “I’m not sure who’d be here looking for me, sir. I know our practice times, so I’m not--”
Tony turned his lovely eyes, gone molten with lust, up to Steve and winked when Steve panted down at him then pursed his lips just a little tighter and slid slowly,
“Their defense honestly needs more work,” Phillips muttered.
“What route were you thinking?” Steve asked at a normal volume, a bland smile on his face.
it was ready when Michael Sam entered the draft…”
entering the Draft,” Dev guessed, swinging off Steve’s other arm as they walked.
Steve frowned down at his empty bowl, unsure how to explain the convoluted mess his brain turned into whenever he tried to reason through being in any way out as a professional football player.  Bucky’s easy acceptance wouldn’t be even remotely close to the norm, he knew, and the thought of opening up to anyone else, of opening himself up to anyone else, filled him with a cloying, creeping dread.  Still, he owed Tony as much honesty as he could give him even if he wasn’t confident he’d even be able to articulate what he wanted.
“Can I leave my suit in your library?”
“You do realize I don’t expect you to say the right thing every single time you open your mouth, right?”
“Oh my God, you did!  Look at those frying pans!”  Bucky cried through his laughter.
“Jesus...no one,” Steve squawked, brandishing his elbow at Sam and holding his phone out in his extended other arm when Sam made a second dive for his phone.
“What you do with the suit’s not classified.  Not since you just told the whole world, ‘I am Iron Man’ then mouthed off to Congress about how you’d made world peace a one-man show.  What you’re trying to do with this team tends to be pretty big news too.”  Steve laughed.  “I can see you, Tony Stark.”
“Doesn’t seem that way to me.” Steve retorted.  He offered Tony a small smile and shifted so he was sitting sideways, mirroring Tony’s position.  “I’ve read about you, y’know.”
“Oh.  Sure.”  He let his left hand stay tangled in his shirt on Tony’s body as he pointed to the multimeter laying on the ground next to the lift stand.  “If you want to do that, I’ll run in and make us plates.”
Steve nodded.  “It’s apparently the worst kept secret in professional sports.”  He locked the door behind him and slipped his arm through Tony’s.  He smiled.  “It was fun.  I missed the handle when I went to grab it on Tower of Terror and almost unbuckled my seatbelt.”
Tony settled heavier against his chest, pinning him down.  “Don’t you
“This’ll probably just be some softball stuff,” Stark said as they trailed the stage manager back into the press area.  “You have a place in New York? I’ve got a realtor who’s worked with our guys. I mean, you don’t
“You better warm those hands up, Cap,” Dallas called over his shoulder as they lined up.
Out on the street, the night was still muggy, and Steve made a face as the warm, humid air bogged him down after the crisp coolness of the Tower’s air conditioning.  He hustled down to Grand Central and about fainted when he got down onto the platform right as his train pulled in.  He settled himself in one of the rear-facing seats, still just as enchanted at 24 with the feeling of riding backwards as he had been at 6, and pulled out his phone and headphones.  He pressed play on the album Tony had picked and let the oddly soothing tracks of Imperial Bedroom and the rhythm of the 4 train carry him back to Brooklyn.
He tucked the ball he was still carrying under his off arm and reached out to take Ms Romanoff’s hand.  Too late, it occurred to him he’d been out running around for over an hour, so his hand was probably a sweaty mess.  She didn’t seem fazed, shaking his hand with a bland PR smile firmly in place.
They stepped off the escalator, and the second Steve’s feet were on solid ground a trio of guys in Denver jerseys were shouldering through the crowd towards them.  “Steve Rogers? You hoping to end up in Denver?” They picked up the pace a bit, dodging a couple arguing about how much was too much to lose playing Texas Hold ‘Em and a family with a toddler mid-meltdown, and popped out onto the sidewalk into the midday heat.  The Denver fans didn’t bother following them out. Steve assumed they weren’t as interested in getting his answer as he was in not having to speculate about it. Especially not in a venue that could easily end up on Twitter.
Steve stared down at the tablet in his hands, willing the blush he could feel creeping up his cheeks to fade.  “That’s--that is nice.”
“I should probably warn you now, I’m terrible with stuff like birthdays and anniversaries and all that...”  he waved his hand, “relationshippy kind of stuff.”
She nodded.  “My daddy says you’re gonna be tras--trans--transdent.”
Sam shook his head.  “I’m good.  Movie?”
Steve shrugged.  “Mostly. Bucky and his friends really helped.”  He glanced at Tony out of the corner of his eye. “Thanks for that, by the way.”
Steve nodded.  “Sure.”
Bucky jiggled his shoulders in a loose shrug.  “Comes with the job,” he huffed.  “Ya get used to it.”
“July.  Right before I had to report back for two-a-days.  Coach let me come back a couple days late because of her funeral.”  His stomach twisted at the thought of someone like Stephen Smith getting hold of his mother’s battle with cancer.  He grabbed Natasha’s wrist as she started to pull away. “You can’t--I don’t--” he took a breath, trying to force himself to make sense.  To explain his desire for privacy in a way that would show her how much he wanted his mom to have her peace. “I only told Phillips because I needed the time.  I don’t want her to be someone ESPN can just talk about. She was sick for a long time, and by the end, it was just…” he looked at her, begging her to understand.  “She deserves to rest, not to be some
Additionally, yes, I am aware that literally no pro team says what they’re going to do in real people words while they’re in the huddle.  But what the fuck does “Hulk double stack” mean to you?  Nothing, right?  Also, yes, the quarterback has a radio in his helmet.
Out in the hall, Steve forced himself to walk at a normal person pace until he was back in the central atrium.  He really didn’t want to start his relationship with someone who seemed to have his best interests in mind by lying to her, but Natasha had been right.  He was here now, and he would try not to rock the boat.  Although his texts with Tony, which had become a nightly event even after only a week, were making that hard.
Phillips shook his head.  “It’s fine. She works for an old friend of mine.  Wants to talk to you about what you’re going to be doing next season.”
Steve straightened his shoulders and reached for the door handle.  “Wish me luck.”
A gentle hand on his arm made Steve look up.  Tony waited until Steve’s posture relaxed before he spoke.  “This--you--I
“Only if you tell me why the hell you’re using your pasta fork to eat dessert,” Tony said as he used a spoon to break off a bite of one cannoli.
Sharon smiled back and patted his wrist.  “Of course.  You’re not the first player who’s wanted privacy following a loss like this, and you certainly won’t be the last.”
“A what?” Steve asked, baffled.
Steve set the album back on the shelf where he’d found it then nudged Bucky’s shoulder.  “Come on, I probably shouldn’t let you guys do all the work for me.”
“I don’t think anything’ll happen, but…” she sighed.  “Joe Theismann didn’t either till it did.”
“It--I…” Tony blushed as he met Steve’s eyes then looked down, suddenly shy.  “I wanted people to see something besides a self-absorbed asshole when they looked at me.”
Steve hummed as he backed through the footage looking for the start of the drive.  “We needed another linebacker.  Needed Banner’s…” Steve looked up at him.  “Wildness.”
Steve shrugged.  “Life of dissipation and regret, probably.”
.”  He grinned at Steve.  “Come on, man. We’re here.  Point us at what needs doin’ and let us help.”
As the last couple of newly signed players filtered in, Pepper Potts stepped to the front of the room.  “Gentlemen,” she said, fixing them all with a confident smile. “I’d like to welcome you once again to the New York Avengers organization.  We’re looking forward to a successful season, and I’m sure each of you will find a way to contribute to that success in a meaningful way. I know you met at least some of our staff when you were drafted or signed, but you’ll get to know most of our front office personnel during OTAs and camp and, of course, during the season.  For now, though, I want to turn things over to our head coach, Mr. Nick Fury.”
I'm so thankful to each and every one of y'all who have given this story a shot.  I'm so pleased you're enjoying it, and an extra special thanks for leaving kudos and such kind comments.
“Been ready,” Sam answered, standing up.  “You wanna watch a movie when we get home?”
Tony nodded, and then he finally, finally let a single finger trace the lines and loops of his own signature, inked into Steve’s chest.  “I love it.”
“It’s just a friend.”
“I--oh Jesus, sorry, that was an awkwardly long handshake,” Scott said, and he released Steve like he’d been burned.  “Sorry. It’s just--I watched your game--your last game--your bowl game.” He took a breath. “You were amazing.”
“What’s taking you so long?” Sam asked, fetching up at the bar to watch Steve cook.
“Now that you’re home, can’t they remove the shrapnel?”
Little Ashleigh squealed and bounced on her toes.  “Can you?”
Steve’s head popped out of the neck of an Avengers T-shirt and he pretended to consider before he said, “Seems reasonable.”
Steve grimaced at that image, but Tony just chuckled softly.  “It lets me power the suit, so who am I to complain, really.”
Phillips clapped Steve on the shoulder.  “Open it. You might want to wear it.”
“Sure, I bet every player here has some pet theories, but you sound like you’ve got actual intel,” he pointed out.
In the silence that followed, the occasional squeak of his markers and the steady clack of Tony’s keyboard settled Steve into his head enough so he could actually concentrate.  Working his way through the run plays, Steve started to pick up the pattern to Fury’s play design, and he wondered if there were specific collections of plays he liked to run against individual teams.  A question for Monday, he supposed.
Fitz shook his head then started peeling the tape off his leg.  Their time in the locker room was almost up.  “You’ve got a head for this game.”  He slapped Steve’s shoulder pad.  “You’ll make somebody a great franchise quarterback.”
Instead of going for the WiFi password right away, though, Tony came and stood next to Steve and picked up the little green tupperware sitting next to the bowl of defensive schemes.  “I recognize this.”
Tony reared back, making a show of being affronted.  “I am a delight and a joy to all who encounter me.”
Steve doubled over laughing.  “Why didn’t they just let the man do the bowl trophy?” he asked.
Steve about jumped out of his skin, whirling at the sound of Tony Stark’s voice.  “Mr. Stark--Tony, I didn’t--shouldn’t you be at the Draft?”
Steve tucked the album he was still holding up under his arm as he closed the front door before turning back to the living room.  “I only got in last night, and no one’s been living here for almost a year.”
“Thank you.”  He turned the box over in his hands, stunned both at his coach’s presence and the fact that he’d gotten him anything.
Suddenly keeping his mom’s death private seemed like the least of his concerns.  Pity was one thing; he could handle that, and something like his mother’s passing would eventually become a miniscule footnote.  Other things, like the reason behind an extremely quiet personal life, couldn’t be so easily overlooked. Personal lives never went away, after all.
“Those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind,” Tony quoted.
“It's a pro bowler!” Dum Dum yelled from where he’d claimed Steve’s chair.
Steve laughed.  “Thought you had smooth lines?”
Steve blushed.  “She...ah...she…”
Alice Hulsey
“You ready to rock and roll?” Sam asked, tromping down from the third floor apartment, bag slung over his shoulder.
~~*~~
“So you’re
“Mr. Stark,” Steve cut in with a small smile.  “I’m sure it’ll be fine. I have a place. I would appreciate those contacts though.  It’ll be easier than having nothing and trying to round them up one by one.”
“I saw you on TV,” Rashad called as he started digging through the special order shelves looking for Steve’s parts.  “You looked good.”
“You ready to be free from all this?  Classes? Curfews? Us?” Brennan asked as he and Devin clambered off Steve’s bed and made for the door.
Tony’s reply this time came in much faster.
“Have a good night, boss,” Happy said then rolled up the windows and drove off.
Natasha nodded.  “Of course. But we will be doing this.  Before we head over to the Bellagio.”
“So how do you feel about Italian food?” Tony asked on their ride up the elevator.
, you call me, okay?”
“Thanks.  You too...or, well...yeah.”
“O...kay?”  Tony rested his spoon on the edge of the container.  “I feel like there’s some more here that I’m missing.”
“Thanks.”
~~*~~
Steve trotted over to the sideline with the rest of the offense as the ref announced the Tigers calling their last timeout.  He glanced up at the clock; a minute and a half meant they really did need this first down.
“Makes me sound like marrying material,” Steve said as he followed Fitz out of the training room.
“I...look...I already know I’ll have to work.  Whether it’s in the playbook, on the board, or on the house.”
Steve nodded.
“Mr. Fury, I’m looking forward to working with you,” he said, shaking Fury’s hand.
Tony shrugged dismissively.  “I’m deeply self-involved.”
mumbled softly to itself on the television.
“You mind if I test fly a new suit?”
“What? No it does not!”
Steve squeezed Tony’s arm right back.  “Promise I won’t...at least, not intentionally.”
Steve stared at her, at a bit of a loss.  He’d been so sure he’d been brought to Fury’s office to get cut that he needed a moment to readjust his thinking away from
He smiled thinly.  “He only said you worked for an old friend of his.  But since it’s December and I’m a senior, I can guess.”
Inside the shop, they shed coats and Tony wandered away to look at the flash on the walls while Steve went over to speak with the young man with artificially red hair at the counter, the weight of the slip of paper in his pocket almost overwhelming.
“As long as it’s not more conspicuous than the Ferrari.”
“Better luck next time, huh, Rogers,” Rumlow said with a smirk when he grabbed Steve’s hand.
Steve shrugged.  “Gotta feed the body.  It’s in the job description.”
Steve nodded.  “Sam said it was like a cross between a Wikipedia bio and a Reddit AMA.”
In his bedroom, Steve didn’t bother to turn on any lights, letting the glow from the streetlamp across the street bathe the bedroom in amber shadows as he got ready for bed.  Just like in his own home, Tony didn’t stand on any sort of ceremony as he stripped off Steve’s clothes and left them on the Clothes Chair next to the closet before he dove into the unused side of the bed in only his underwear.  Steve followed a moment later, grinning when Tony weaseled as close as he could get in the circle of Steve’s arms.
Steve rose to walk her to the door.  A thought occurred to him right as she stepped out into the hall.  “Just one thing, Nat?”
“If you don’t
“Please, call me Peggy.”  She patted his arm reassuringly.  “You don’t have to make a decision right this instant.  If I could leave you with my contact details?  That way we can speak soon and see what role would best suit you in our organization.”
Steve shrugged, a small, self-deprecating smile on his face.  “Grew up in Brooklyn. Makes me a pretty easy sell on that one, honestly.”
“That’s...subtle,” Sam jabbed him in the ribs as they stepped up for their turn to moving stretches.
“I don’t want to play in Dallas.”
“Where in Brooklyn?” Happy asked, the hum of the tires on the bridge the only sign they were leaving Manhattan.
Steve shook his head
“And you couldn’t call?” Sam demanded, incredulous.
,” Sam leveled a glare that would peel paint at Steve, “because
This was real.
“Yeah, but a free safety or a lineman’s not as flashy a first round pick,” Steve pointed out.
Tony Stark smiled up at him.  “I can’t offer you a whole table this time, but maybe…” he brought a small tupperware container out from behind him.  “Maybe this will make up for it?”
He shook his head.  “I don’t mind it. You guys make it easy.”
Bucky rolled over onto his side to fully face Steve.  “That was the sketchiest agreement I’ve ever heard.”
“Cat,” she said proudly and pointed at Alpine from her spot between Bucky’s shins.
Steve slipped the handle of Natasha’s suitcase out of her hand and went to stow both their bags while she handled getting their destination set up.  He hadn’t actually planned on coming because when he’d looked at the cost of transportation and hotels, he’d almost had a stroke. He’d said as much to Natasha on one of their phone calls, and she’d simply said “you’re going” and hung up.  Twenty minutes later he’d had flight and hotel confirmation emails in his inbox.
Steve stewed silently next to Natasha while she checked them in and worked her magic to get them rooms right next to each other.  He knew he needed to tell her his mother had died, but the idea of explaining something like that to her in a crowded hotel lobby made his stomach turn.
Steve stood up and dusted his shorts off then reached out a hand to help Tony to his feet.  “Just let me say bye to Bucky then yeah.”  He smiled softly at Tony.  “It’s a date.”
“Did she ever regret it?  Saying yes?”
did it,” he whooped, laughing as he and Steve pounded each other on the back.
Tony drummed his fingers against the lid of the container before turning back to the desk.  “Smart and sentimental.”
“Hey, Unskippable YouTube Ad, I was just thinking about you.”
Steve nodded even though Natasha couldn’t see him.  She was right. Apart from a few drunken fumblings in high school and his freshman year of college, Steve had remained quietly and resolutely single.  Even before he’d sewn up the starting role in college, he’d known. His silence was about protecting more than just himself.
Pietro smiled reassuringly at Steve as they made the short trip down the hall to the press room.
me, Steve.  I had a good time with you on Draft Night and I want to have a good time with you after your first week.  Whatever that looks like.”
“Sam.” Steve took a breath.  “I owe you an apology.  I--I shouldn’t have misled you about Tony, and I’m sorry.”
“Would you…” the little girl’s dad flushed.  “Would it be too much to ask you to sign her dress?  She loves this thing. Won’t hardly take it off to let her mom and me wash it.”
“Something like that,” Tony gasped, a little breathless, before he bent to run his lips and tongue along Steve’s neck.
“No more than two hours under that plastic and wash your hands before you touch it,” she called after them.
A few minutes later, when he was trying to wrangle a single tiny screw into place, his phone pinged again.
Steve smirked, knowing this would be his last response for a bit.
all he wants is friendship.  But you
So here’s the deal...when an NFL player (or any professional athlete for that matter) gets suspended, they can appeal their suspension.  Depending on the sport, the suspended player can keep practicing and suiting up and even playing while the appeals process works itself out.
He nodded.  “It can be.”
Bucky’s answering smile lit up his whole face.  “Thanks, man.  They knew just who I needed when I came looking for Alpine, so I’m glad I can help them too.”
“It’s fine with us,” he said back into the phone.  He listened for a moment then nodded. “Sure. See you in a bit.”  Dum Dum hung up and pocketed his phone. “Bucky’s on his way with whatever Monty said you needed from Target and Lowes, lunch, and our boss’s boss’s boss.”
“What’d that sandwich ever do to you?” Tony asked, poking his fork at the slaw Steve had set aside to save for last and stealing a bite.
Steve laughed.  “I don’t think I’ve ever been fishing in my life.  Too much city in me.”
Steve offered him a sad smile.  “Sometimes discretion is the better part of valor.”
Steve got up and started throwing easy routes to an extremely enthusiastic Alice Dugan.  She giggled wildly every time she caught one of his passes.  “Touchdown!  I’m an all star!” she squealed as she spiked the ball at the bottom of Bucky’s backyard.
Fury settled in his chair and fixed Steve with an appraising look.  “Steve, Carol and I spent most of the morning rewatching your play from Sunday while we worked out the rough sketch of our game plan.  And we saw a lot of very promising things.”
Fury cracked the closest thing Steve had seen to a smile in his time with the team.  “Not yet.  I figured he’d have questions for both of us once I did.”
“Leave your dishes.  I’ll take care of them,” Steve called from the kitchen.
“What’s that?” Tony came over and started poking around the engine block, not really doing anything, just putting his hands on the hardware.
Steve took a slow breath, even as he felt the sharp drop of ice in his gut.  “So?” he asked, relieved his voice came steady but not sharp.
Dum Dum squeezed his shoulder once more before he let Steve go and glanced down at his watch.  “Jesus. Cho’s minions are gonna beat our asses if we don’t eat soon. We about done in here?”
Ms. Desiree waved him off.  “I know she’s been poorly. Her email address the same?  I’ll just send them to her.”
Steve looked down at the ratty but clean Texas Strength and Conditioning shirt he had on with a pair of equally ratty gym shorts.  “Like I just got out of the shower?
Steve squinted over at him.  “D’you always wear sneakers with your suits?”
“You did well today,” Thor said, blunt as always.
Steve cringed.  He’d hated dealing with the media in college.  He knew it was only going to be worse now though.  The expectation that he be available to the media every single day he was working made his stomach clench.
“C’mere,” Steve demanded, grabbing clumsily for Tony with fingers still tingling with fading sparks of pleasure.  “Wanna…”
“Don’t have to run upstairs to look at the router every time I need it,” Steve shrugged, unperturbed.
that I don’t want to.”
He and Bucky eventually trailed after the upstairs crew up to the second floor to make a start on the bedrooms, but Steve had to pull up when Bucky stopped at the top of the stairs, staring at the stuff Steve had brought back from Austen lining the hallway.  Bucky pointed to the two closed doors and asked, “So which room’s yours?”
Tony waggled his eyebrows behind his red sunglasses.  “Billy Ocean has a suggestion for times like this.”
Thankfully, the botched handoff had only set them back two yards, so second and 12 from the 29 wasn’t nearly as bad as it could have been.  Hell, they were sending the offense back out instead of having to scramble the defense.  Two downs and only seven yards later, it didn’t really matter anyway as the punt unit came out to get rid of the ball.  Mindful of the way networks loved to capture sideline drama, Steve calmly traded his helmet for the tablet Danvers was holding out to him.
“Friends?”
Steve smiled at the sound of the house full and alive again, even if it was only for the day.
“Exactly.  But think about what she’s
“Definitely,” Steve said, a small smile tugging the corner of his mouth.  He’d loved vanishing into the crowd, and being able to do it with Tony had been even better.  He’d felt his age, if only for an hour, while they’d exchanged drives and trash talk and not even their bay attendant had recognized either one of them, even though the Draft was on every screen in the complex.
“Oh, so you
Steve blinked and blushed.  “Am I what?”
Bucky threw his napkin on his empty plate and stood too.  “And on that note, I think we’re done here. Fellas?”
“Oh, is that how football works?” Fitz asked broadly.
As the offense trotted off the field at the end of warmups, Sam jumped against Steve, knocking into him with his shoulder pads.  “You two are disgusting, you know?”
“Okay,” Hill said, clicking off the projector.  “I’ve been told we’re going to take you down to the team dining room for some lunch then you’re off to equipment and then Luke in the weight room.”
doing if it’s not freaking out.”
Down the hall Peter had indicated, a young lady in a smart red dress stood outside the door marked Film while her partner was in the room fiddling with the computer and projector setup.  “Gentlemen,” she said with a slight nod. “Welcome to the Avengers. If you’ll just take a seat anywhere you see a StarkPad, we’ll be getting started promptly at nine.”
to be that.  What you need, but...” he clenched his hands around the container and shrugged down at the table, unable to articulate the helpless uneasiness that chewed around the edges of his attention every time he tried to picture himself on an NFL field.
Steve shot her a look.  “What do you know?”
“I don’t think I actually know what shawarma is,” Tony admitted as he glanced at Steve’s dinner then dabbed some of the tahini on his own food, imitating Steve.  “It looks really good though.”
Steve offered her a small smile and waved back.  “Thanks.”
“Can you tell us what’s in the container?” a man from NFL Network asked.
in less than ten minutes.”  He hung up with a sigh.  “Sorry.  I’m going to have to cut this short.”
Bucky held his arms out and started walking backwards away from Steve.  “Who wouldn’t.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Rashad nodded as he passed Steve’s parts over.  “You keep doin’ what you’re doin’, and you’ll make all of Brooklyn proud, kid.”
“You can’t put all your eggs in one basket,” Fury pointed out.  “Fitz is here now, and Rogers’ll be able to learn from him, but we need to think long term.”
Natasha nodded.  “I get that. But we’re not going to ask you to stick a horse head in someone’s bed if--”
Tony set his fork down and turned to fully face Steve.  “Okay.  First off, I’m not sure I appreciate ‘hooking up with’; makes us both sound a little unnecessarily slutty.”
Steve smirked up at his coach.  “Is this a test?”
Steve looked back into the house with a helpless shrug.  “I’m not honestly sure. And anyway, I don’t want you to give up your last Saturday before OTAs helping me with housework.  I can take care of this on my own.”
“Hey,” Steve replied, pointedly ignoring Bucky’s emphasis.  “Where do you want ice and drinks?”
Phillips sniffed once loudly.  “Now don’t get like that, Rogers.  Go hang around with those silly receivers of yours.  Act your age for once.” He turned and handed the coaches’ trophy to their blindside linebacker, giving Steve an out to slip back to his friends.
“The point of all this,” Fury said, still giving Carol a bit of a hairy eyeball, “is that a big part of the plan for this week has come down to quarterback choices.  Fitzsimmons has a bit of a lingering knee issue from his college days, and it’s giving him a bit of trouble.”  He leaned forward on his elbows.  “Between that and your play this past weekend, the plan is to give you the start in Atlanta.  You’ll have the opportunity to play the whole game, but Fitz will be there to give you the benefit of his wisdom and Isaiah will be there as your backup.”
“So what’s next for you?”  Jamaal asked as they made their way back to midfield for the formal trophy presentation.  “I mean, you walked in December.”
Steve smiled and offered Rashad a small wave.  “Hey.  I got your email that my parts had come in.”
Steve slid his hands around Tony’s waist and slipped his fingers under Tony’s shirt to caress the bare skin at the small of his back as they kept kissing.
Steve gripped his hands together in his lap and squeezed them tightly.  “It’s...early.”
“Well that sounds completely shady,” Sam muttered.
“I was about to send out a search party,” Tony teased when Steve made it back out to the lounge.
his mom had written.  Underneath he’d scrawled
I’m sure this isn’t *exactly* how these sorts of sit-downs go, but this is fiction, so YOLO.
He followed Fury out of the locker room and down the hall to the coaches’ suite on numb legs.  Practice squad relegation, waivers, cuts, and the repercussions of all three flicked through his head in quick succession like someone flipping too fast through a PowerPoint slideshow.  No matter what, he’d call Natasha as soon as they gave him his walking papers.  Get her advice on how to proceed.
“Well, football’s a team sport, after all,” Steve answered, running a hand through his sweaty hair in an effort to bring some sort of order to whatever was going on up there and, he hoped, hide the overwhelming urge to roll his eyes.  “We’re all out here playing for each other every down and every play. The personal accolades are nice, but they’re not the be all, you know?” He shrugged and smiled. “At the end of the day, when we play together, we win together.”
“Don’t you boys have some routes to be running?   We’ve got a bowl game in less than a month.” Phillips shouted at the rest of the offense.
A man in an ESPN bib grabbed Steve by his shoulder pads and maneuvered him next to a diminutive woman with bright blonde hair and bold red lipstick with a vaguely predatory gleam in her eye.  She kept her hands off him long enough for him to pull his helmet off, then gripped his elbow, clearly unwilling to miss out on getting the first post-game interview with the winning quarterback by letting him get swept up by his teammates.
“Rogers!” Fury motioned him over to where he’d circled up the rest of the offense.  The medical team had given up on getting Fitz to his feet and had started working to strap him into an air cast to immobilize his whole leg.
“Where do you want these glasses?”

Steve could feel heat creeping up his face.  “You--we’re dating?”
“I’m not scary.  Who says I’m scary?” He poked Steve’s arm.  “Am I scary?”
Later, when they were sitting in the outdoor bar on the TopGolf roof, Tony nudged his ankle with the toe of his shoe.  “So...worth it?”
Jerry Jones was adamant that his players stand “toe on the line” when Kaepernick started protesting during the anthem or he would fire them.  So, you know, a real class act *side eye*
One of the young ladies Steve remembered from Monday joined them at the copier, a patient smile on her face.  “Steve?”
He felt Tony relax on top of him.
Steve wrapped Wylie’s leash around his hand so it couldn’t slip out of his grasp while they ran, and Bucky grinned at him.  “They’re gonna love this.”
“Coolers are under the patio,” Fitz jumped in.  Someone had put peel and stick letters on the three coolers Fitz pointed out that said BEER, SODA, and WATER, respectively.  “I don’t think we’ll need the ice yet.  I’m about to go back in to try to find my teenage child who seems to live on Fortnite these days, so I can take it.”
“Oh, for the NFL?  That’s neat! You excited?”
Bucky slid into his car with a nod and gunned the engine.  “Got it. See ya’ in a bit,” he hollered out the window as he pulled away from the curb.
“Not to be That Guy, but why are you in here assaulting me to wake me up?  And on my birthday no less.”
“Why d’you think he’s gonna be the 40-point player and not me?” Steve asked around a bite of Sam’s potato salad.
Sam reached out and smacked Steve’s leg when he stood to get rid of his trash.  “This is exactly what I’ve been telling you.  You’re good.  Everyone else’s figuring that out too.”
Steve settled down in the vee of Tony’s legs, chuckling when Tony let out an overexaggerated groan at his weight.  “Press is stupid.”
“Plenty of things still need work, obviously,” Danvers jumped in.  “Some speed and timing work, some play selection, route identification, but that’s true of any rookie coming out of college.  You’re used to a slower game with more time to make decisions.”
Back at the house, Tony led the way into the house, then started dragging Steve up the stairs by his belt buckle before he could turn any downstairs lights on.  “Can I guess what the chest piece is?”
“I missed it?” he asked, disappointed.  “Can I see?”
Y’all, let’s be clear, the NFL does not give one single shit if you’re hurt.  They roll that cart out there, load your ass up, and the game moves on.  It can feel a little impersonal, especially when it’s one of your faves getting carted off (hello, JJ Watt), but you must remember, at the end of the day, for good and ill, the NFL is a business.  Plus, let’s be honest, it can feel quite invasive and voyeuristic to watch someone who’s injured receiving first aid from the safety of our living rooms.
Steve rolled his eyes.  “Not any of that, I can promise you.”
Tony shrugged diffidently, but his eyes were bright with the compliment.  “You’ve got tons of time to be an Avenger.”  He pushed himself up on his elbows and kissed Steve again.  No rush.  No agenda.  Trading hazy kisses as the last of the sun faded from the windows.  “You can just be Steve as long as you need.”
Steve watched Tony admire the bike, prodding occasionally at different parts of the underbelly.  “So not to be ‘that guy’, but unless you want hungry to become hangry, I should probably eat,” Steve said after another moment of watching Tony poke at his bike.
Carol trotted up to them and fell in step as they continued towards the locker rooms.  “Fury’s gonna want you at the podium after he does his postgame.  So get in there, get cleaned up, and get yourself ready.”
Your kind words and kudos have meant so much to me.  I'm so glad this little AU of mine is something y'all are enjoying. :)
Back home, Steve was still in the process of getting food when Sam came trotting back downstairs, dinner in one hand and movie in the other.
“You can ask,” Tony agreed, a little wariness creeping into his eyes even as he curled sideways onto the couch facing Steve.
Tony straightened up after a bit, his whole face still hazy and pleasure drunk, and he trailed his fingers through his own come on Steve’s chest.  “Now you really are mine.”
“How about built?” Tony offered.
kind of player, everyone on the field knows this is your livelihood, so they don’t tend to go for blood.”
Sam shrugged.  “I should survive the weekend.  You know, I think Lang might actually die if he doesn’t have someone to talk to all the time.”
He leaned down just that little bit and kissed Tony, letting himself linger and enjoy the way Tony tended to smile when Steve would kiss him.  When the elevator doors opened with a soft ding, Steve pulled back and licked his lips, chasing the last hint of their kiss.  “Have a good night.”
“What about you?” he asked a few minutes later.
A stop for ice, a nearly disastrous turn the wrong way down a one-way street when Sam had refused to listen to either Waze or Steve, and an almost-fight over a parking spot later, they were hefting their contribution to Bucky’s party up his front steps.  Before they could even knock, though, the door flung open and a compact man with sandy blonde hair was grinning maniacally at them.
Last thing: I’ve flung a whole bunch of post-2000 players from UT into a blender and hit pulse a few times to build the tail end of Steve’s college experience, so don’t get too attached to these guys...Steve and Nat are the only ones who’ll be hanging around.
“You’ll never guess, so why don’t I just show you, hmm?”
Steve knelt down to scruff his hands through the dog’s wavy fur.  “He’s really well behaved.”
“Your life just revolves around food, doesn’t it?” Tony asked with a laugh.
Dallas, who had beaten them to midfield, was handing out roses from the massive arrangement that sat at the base of the stage, and he handed one to Steve with a wink.  He’d clearly overheard. “Everything’s comin’ up roses, Cap.”
“You think?” Tony asked.
“If it’s that place on Washington, I think I got their classic sandwich every day during summer two-a-days in high school.”
Steve grimaced.  “Please don’t remind me.”
~~*~~
“Mr. Barnes?” One of the little girls who’d been playing freeze tag before lunch was standing at the edge of their group with a trail of other kids behind her.
“Coach, I don’t--
Tony looped his arm through Steve’s elbow and rolled his eyes.  “Of course not.  But you know I don’t only travel in vehicles that I drive.”
“Of course I’m gonna be here for the player who’s made me the proudest I’ve been in a lotta years.”  Phillips stepped in and held out a small, white box. “Got ya something. To remember where you came from.”
*Shows up 3 months later with Starbucks* "Hey, y'all!"
Let us proceed apace with the handwaving!  I’ve rolled the rookie mini-camp and the beginning of OTAs into one because pacing.  Aso, I know a bit about OTAs from friends who have been in and around the League...this is not in any way a flex, it’s just a statement.  And what I’ve learned from talking to them is this: actual rookie camps and the vast majority of OTAs are BORING.  Think back on the last time you had to go through orientation for your job...pretty dull amiright?  The NFL ain’t no different.  So we’re going to tart it up a bit, for the Dramz, obviously.
“You’ve been together a hot minute, haven’t you?” She asked as she fitted a new, clean needle and opened a new container of black ink.
“And as a closer.  To a wakeup workout.  Who does he think we are?”
“When do you wanna head over there?”  Steve asked, deliberately ignoring the first question.
Sharon nodded.  “Now that I’ve put the fear of God in you, you’re free to go.”
“Smile, Rogers,” Natasha commanded.
“Sure.”
Steve looked up and nodded at Thor with a relieved smile, and T’Challa and Hopkins both circled around with their own observations and advice.  Danvers pitched in when they got stuck, and the third quarter wound down with the defense making an impressive stop when Dernier blew up Rumlow on a botched play to get his first sack of the season.
“Has anyone ever told you you’re the perfect all-American throwback?  I feel like someone should follow you around whistling the Andy Griffith theme song.”
“Yeah, but…”
“Something smells good down here.”  He rounded the corner.  “What’s for dinner and can I have some?”
has been on do not disturb since yesterday afternoon.  He asked if I knew what your deal was and if we’d bring a couple bags of ice.”
Tony knew how that sounded.
“We were
Steve nodded, willing to ignore Bucky’s underlying question.  “That’d be great. Thank you, Bucky.”
“I don’t think the Sturgis Avengers has quite the same ring to it,” Steve pointed out.
“Assemble!” they responded then broke to get themselves cleaned up.
As always, Betheflame and Kestrel337 have all my love and thanks for their fabulous cheer and beta help.  This would be a pale imitation of a story without them.
Tony nodded absently, but just as Steve turned to leave, his head popped up.  “You--you don’t mind that I’ll be in your room by myself?”
“Well, I can see you’re going to be a dream to work with,” Sharon said as she finished typing his final responses.  “You know how to keep yourself edited, that’s for sure.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony grinned.  “I know just the thing.”  When Steve tried to lean over and peek, he clutched Steve’s phone to his chest and shooed him off his chair with a small flick of his fingers.  “Go get your shoes.  I want this to be a surprise.”
Tony pulled the other chair up next to Steve “So what is this?” he asked as he started poking his fork through the chicken, vegetables, and rice in his bowl.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No girl,” Steve murmured down at his tablet.  It occurred to him as they pulled off the expressway just how that denial sounded, so he tried to cover it by focusing on the thing that really irked him.  The thing that might actually cause this fragile thing he’d been building with Tony to blow wide open.  “Anyway, who tweets about seeing a football player out on a Sunday night?  That’s just weird and invasive.”
“We have water and water,” Monty offered as he filled glasses at the sink.
Tony closed the last few inches between them and kissed Steve softly, gently.  It wasn’t earth-shattering.  Steve knew his lips were a little dry and a hint of the tang from the ketchup Tony had added to his burger lingered on his tongue, and Steve knew he was probably shaking too much to make him seem in any way together.  But it didn’t matter.
“What book,” Tony asked.
“Still, I’m sorry,” Steve insisted.
Steve took another deep breath and straightened up to start pulling down plates and getting condiments out of the fridge.  No sense worrying about it now, he supposed.  Besides, they hadn’t actually done anything anyone could work into any kind of story.
She turned around and patted at her shoulder with the opposite hand.  “Back here?”
A quick word about the Draft itself...there’s A LOT of wheeling and dealing that goes on behind the scenes with trading draft spots, trading picks ahead of those picks actually happening.  Not to mention the actual bargaining for contract terms that happens after a selection occurs.  I’ve stripped that WAY back because, let’s be real, we care about Steve getting drafted onto the team Tony owns.
“Not a baby,” Steve muttered, ignoring the second half of Bucky’s statement in favor of being disagreeable.
Steve shoved his tablet back into his backpack then hustled to get out of the car and catch up with Sam.  “So if you knew I was in Midtown, why the freakout?”
“Late birthday.  And I got held back in second grade.”
“If I can,” Steve agreed with a small smile.
Dot rolled her eyes.  “Oh get lost and go warm up.”  She caught Steve’s eye and waved.  “Good to see you again, Steve, good luck today.”
His fingers felt disconnected from the rest of his body as he typed a reply.
Steve shrugged.  “I guess so.”  He caught sight of Christine Everheart interviewing Brock on the far sideline.  “How long do we have to stay out here?”
“Right.  Your agent emailed us about that right after you signed your contract.  I put a note in your file that we as an organization respect your right to keep such a personal loss private and as such we won’t offer any comment or statement on it.”
he was right.  “Work life balance is a thing here too,” he murmured as he stood.
, not only does he show up, he sweeps you off in that flashy car of his.  See the way I figure it,
Steve’s laugh was a little shaky, but he didn’t try to stop the tears that gathered at the corners of his eyes.  “Awful.”
Tony blinked, a bit dazed, as his eyes tracked Steve’s tongue.  “Yeah--I--you too.”
They all took seats in front of the Avengers backdrop and representatives from the press immediately crowded around.
“I wasn’t--”
Over the next hour they went through everything about Steve’s life any of their fans could possibly want to know.  From how he started playing, “seventh grade, I thought my ma was gonna have a heart attack the first time I got tackled” to why he’d chosen Texas “great school, great team...what else could I have wanted,” to his nickname in college “Steeb.  Trying to say my name with a broken nose wasn’t my proudest moment.” To what he liked to do in his free time “drawing, but I’ve been planning on fixing up an old motorcycle myself.”
“Can we help you acclimate?” Thor asked, sliding onto the bench next to Steve where he was studying the last drive.
“Don’t worry so much about ‘what if.’” Tony interrupted with an easy smile.  “Just...do you. The rest is all noise.”
He finally managed, “What do I need to know?”
Steve stood to leave with a wan smile.  “Thanks.  I think.”
Steve jolted at the sound of the cultured and detached voice coming from...well...everywhere, he supposed.
“Oh the internet has plenty to say about me.”  Tony rolled his eyes.  “Usually accompanied by photographic evidence.”
There are some really fuckin’ smart men in the NFL, like Myron Rolle a former safety for the Tennessee Titans.  This guy is a literal neurosurgeon now that his playing career has ended.  Brain.  Surgery.  Or Ryan Fitzpatrick with his econ degree from Harvard and his Scrabble addiction.  No lie, I play online Scrabble in the vain hopes I’ll one day get matched with Fitzpatrick.  I’d happily let him kick my ass with his wordplay (spoiler: I am not Harvard-smart).
She motioned him towards the front row of seats where her bag leaned next to a pair of chairs that had the little desks pulled out.  He wriggled into one of the chairs, sucking in his abs to squeeze around the desk. She slid smoothly into the other seat, pulling a slim notebook and pen out of her bag.
~~*~~
Danvers sat in one of Fury’s chairs and patted the arm of the other one.  “Have a seat.  Let’s talk.”
Also, Steve’s college (which may or may not be my alma mater) is playing the championship game at the Rose Bowl because when Texas won the national title at the Rose Bowl back in 2005, that was the best game I’ve ever been to in my life, and no, I’ll never be over it.
Steve nodded a little numb.  “Sure.”
Pulling back, Steve nodded.  “We should do this again sometime.  A date, I mean.”
Steve jerked his head in a small nod.  “Yeah, but I--”
“Right here gentlemen,” the stage manager interrupted them.  “We’ll start with everyone then just Steve.”
“You made it,” Bucky greeted him with a grin and a slap on the shoulder.  “Let me introduce you to Angie and Dolores.  They run the shelter.”
Bucky nodded.
“That good, huh,” Tony said around a bite of what looked like pink pasta.  He let Steve take a couple more bites before he tapped the back of Steve’s wrist with the handle of his fork.  “So talk to me.”
For a while, they seemed to.  Steve and the offense didn’t quite make it into the endzone on their next two drives, but they did squeeze into Clint’s range for another field goal.  On the other side of the ball, the Howlies were holding the Serpents’ offense to similarly paltry drives and, thankfully, no points.  Just before the two minute warning, however, Jasper Sitwell, the weaselly running back the Serpents had been using to sneak in critical gains, slipped through the secondary and bolted for open turf.  Monty and Dernier took off after him, but he stepped out of the shoestring tackle Monty put on him and into the endzone.
“Yeah, you had guys who ran routes in the fall and ran decathlon in the spring.  Which they’d probably been doing since junior high.  You did not have big, Nordic, giants who came to college to swing around a rock on a string and then say ‘oh, what’s football?’ and then end up making the offensive line something people cared about outside of when it failed.”
Steve shuddered and arched into the feel of Tony’s mouth as he ran his hands down Tony’s sides.  “Jesus that’s…”
“You’re 25,” Bucky pointed out.  “You’re the baby.”
I (Tony, but whatever) stole Romeo Crennel from the Houston Texans.  Why, because I love the way he glares at his players over his little readers.
“No more conspicuous than the Ferrari.”
“Give me something to listen to on my ride home, then,” Steve said, then passed Tony his phone, Spotify open on the screen.
“Congratulations on headin’ home, son,” Phillips said.
“Now you, Stevie, come on.”  Steve laughed and held his rose in his teeth when she turned her camera on him.  “Did your mama come, Steve?” she asked when she’d exhausted her shutter finger.
“Pretty sure it’s ‘clear eyes, full hearts,’ Cap,” Dallas tossed over his shoulder.
Tony grinned sharklike.  “I can if you like.”
“Day this humid, we should probably just do a short one,” Gabe suggested.
“Dev, have you not been saying
With a small smile and nod at the assembled reporters, he stepped from behind the table.  He figured it wouldn’t be terribly dignified to sprint over to meet Natasha where she was lurking by the exit, so he settled for covering the distance in a few purposeful strides.
“50 percent power,” Tony murmured, and the suit’s eyes and chest dimmed and its sweep of the area slowed.  “Let’s start with an easy one...do you like spending time with me?”
Steve blushed scarlet.  “I’m--I--”
She released his wrist with a smile.  “Have a good weekend, Steve.  Rest up.”
“Swear Jar, Jimmy!” Bucky hollered up the stairs.  “I know you know Fury hates that kinda talk.”
“This is really good,” Steve said around his mouthful of food.  “Like I think I may be spoiled for other burgers good.”
Snap.
Steve refused to answer, sure anything he said would give away the fact that, no, he did not have a sweet girl waiting for him in either Austin or Brooklyn.  And he probably wouldn’t. Ever.
you dinner to celebrate making it through your first week?”
“Smart,” Bucky nodded.
“There’s literally slot machines in the airport,” Steve pointed out as he and Natasha made their way through a packed McCarran airport.
Tony nodded.  “I helped Pepper and Hill develop the morality clauses in your contract.  We want our team to be something the fans can be proud of.”  He twirled some more pasta around his fork.  “But you haven’t violated any of them.”
“You want me to run these where they need to go?” Bucky pointed at the boxes.  “I got my car. I can bring back lunch too.”
,” Steve offered.
“Of course.”  He scribbled his signature against the tiny, delicate shoulder blade then dropped the Sharpie back into his bag.  “There you go.”
Carla laughed as she examined the paper then set it face down on her scanner.  “This is perfect.  Nice, high quality copy.”  She glanced up at him.  “And the second?”
As far as I’m concerned, the Avengers gave too much away to get Steve Rogers.  Let’s see Fury solve his wide receiver problem with two quarterbacks. #Blasphemous.
“Sounds like I need to,” Sam muttered as he pulled into the parking lot.
Back at the house, Sam went upstairs with a tired “don’t wake me up unless the building’s on fire.”  Alone, Steve hustled through a shower and repacked his bag for tomorrow before he went downstairs in search of food.
“Karen gave me a redacted copy of something you’d signed recently,” Steve answered.  He turned to lean up against the headboard, dragging Tony into his lap.  “D’you like it?”
“Aw, wrong way, Fitzy,” Clint called as the back judge started peeling the pile apart.
“I am a guy,” Steve answered mildly.
While Sam was still laughing at him, a lithe man with a quick smile dropped into one of the seats directly in front of them.  He turned that smile on them. “Oh, wow, you--you’re Steve Rogers. I know you.” He stuck out his hand, grinning even wider when Steve accepted it.  “Scott. Lang. I was playing last year at Cal Poly.”
Steve sighed.  “I can’t do that until our season is fully over.”  He folded the desk back into the arm of his chair and stood to go.  “I’m sorry for wasting your time, ma’am, but--”
Steve rolled his eyes.
“There’s a bet,” Tony jumped in to explain.  “Fury refuses to say what happened or show anyone what it looks like.”
“Hey, kid,” Natasha said, dropping into the chair across from him.
“Sounds good to me,” Steve replied.  “I don’t really feel like collapsing with a cramp on Monday.”
Flipping through his high school career, action shots of him on the field started to mix more frequently with his formal team pictures as he spent more and more time in the game, and his signing day and the party Coach Raf had--
Steve nodded.
Steve shrugged.  “Sure, why not?”
Back in his room, he went back to his desk and picked up Natasha’s card again.  “She said ‘call me anytime,’” he murmured to himself as he grabbed his phone and dialed.  He listened to it ring until it clicked over to voicemail, then took a deep breath and spoke his willingness to discuss representation to the empty air of his dorm room and the silent ear of her voicemail.
“I’m just sayin’.  200 points isn’t a small amount.”
He reached out and gently tapped a scar on the back of Tony’s hand with his knuckle.  “Why’d you tell people you were Iron Man?”
“Mr. Rogers, how are you feeling about getting drafted by the Avengers?”  The young lady from The Post asked, turning her phone towards him.
I know I say this every update, but this would be a pale shadow of an imitation without Betheflame and Kestrel337.  Ladies, y'all keep me on solid ground and moving forward.
“Of course I do,” Steve agreed easily.  “And that’s just where I’d pictured it.”
I’ve already told you both those things.  I would eventually like to spend time with you with no clothes on too, but, well, I’m
“Okay, okay, you don’t have to tell me twice,” Sam raised his hands in surrender and sat back.  “But you gotta let her sit with the wives and girlfriends once the season starts or folks’ll talk.”
Steve nodded miserably.  “And you know it’s bad if there’s been talk of people coming out in a group to ‘share the backlash.’  Why should there be
to be,” Tony retorted smartly.  He glanced sideways at Steve.  “Look, there’s a reason I didn’t try to lure you into bed right after the Draft.  Or either time I came over to your place.  And why I don’t plan on trying to tonight.”
Steve tugged his shoes off and lined them up along the outside of the couch right as Tony flopped down next to him and the opening credits started to roll.  Tony pulled his knees up to his chest and wiggled further down into both the couch and Steve.
to figure out ways to make it work.”
Steve shook his head as he pulled a club out of the rack.  “I hope you realize I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing.”
“Your vote of confidence is overwhelming,” Steve deadpanned.  “Come on over.  I have dinner in the slow cooker for after I’m through.”
“I--I guess so,” Steve conceded.
“Of course you won’t.”  He patted Steve’s shoulder, his smile small but proud.  “Now go meet that pretty agent of yours. She got Lisa and me seats with y’all, but the media doesn’t want to talk to an old fart like me, so we’ll be along later.”
“Jesus Tony, the way you talk,” Steve said, shaking his head and blushing.
“You have double jointed elbows?” Sam asked then immediately grimaced as Steve started shaking out his arms.  “Ugh!  No!  Don’t
“This is the trouble when defensive stars have offensive kids,” Steve said over his shoulder.
Steve shook his head against the arc reactor.  “Nah.  The garden center didn’t carry them regularly, and I’da had to order it.  I got her a new copy of her favorite book.  Her old one had fallen apart a couple months earlier, and she hadn’t had time to go get a new one.”
“Yes, sir.”

Laughing, Steve trotted downstairs and stopped to pull a couple waters out of the fridge before he went back outside and carefully uncovered his parts again and started fitting them together.
“I’ve heard a few teams traded up to have a better shot at you still being available.”  She grabbed his hand under the table and started tracing team abbreviations onto his palm, making a list.  “So I’d say you’ll go sometime between nine and twelve based on how high those teams traded.”
Tony smacked Steve’s thigh.  “Come eat and tell me what you
He winked.  “As long as they’re the right kind of ideas.”
“Mmm, yeah,” Steve murmured, still feeling deliciously slow and content where they were laying on the couch.  “I’ve never made out in the movies.”
They exchanged their goodnights, and Steve closed his door behind them with a small sigh.  It was nearing midnight, and he should really be going to bed himself, but Devin’s insistence that both Erskine and Natasha ‘knew their shit’ kept coming back to him as he showered and brushed his teeth.
Steve shook his head and changed the subject.  “Saw you doin’ your part, out there.”
“Yes, ma’am,” Steve murmured along with the rest of the rest of them, but he spoke the words through bloodless lips.
‘Don’t waste it’ turned into a slog of a drive that kept extending to third downs, draining precious time off the clock.  At third and five on the Serpents’ 33, the booth dialled up the same play action pass play that had ended with Steve having to throw the ball away.  This time, it was Rollins who got the drop on the play, bursting through the line right as they went to shift the block.  Steve took off running and pumped the ball, trying to find an open man downfield.  Neither Sam nor Scott had shaken their defenders, and T’Challa was too far into the fake to still take a pitch out.
“Stairs’ll do fine, Buck,” Steve laughed.
Steve smiled.  “Gently and only over the plastic.”
The entire block of Las Vegas Boulevard in front of the Bellagio had been closed off and turned into seating for the Draft.  A floating stage had been constructed in the middle of the water, and the arcing display of the fountains behind the stage only heightened the dramatic feel of the setup.  Huge screens next to the main stage cut between shots of prospective draftees sitting with their families and friends and the suites inside the Bellagio and the Flamingo that had been turned into war rooms for all 32 teams’ draft selection committees.  It was beautiful and completely over the top, and as they made their way in, Steve squeezed Natasha’s hand where it rested in the crook of his arm in silent thanks for making him come.
Once they made it up to their floor, Natasha followed Steve into his room instead of going to her own.  She plopped down on the bed. “Spill. Where’s your mom?”
Steve nodded and smiled a little sadly down at her.  “I get it. Sometimes you hafta play the game with house rules.”
Friday Night Lights
He leaned in and slid an arm around the back of Steve’s chair.  “Tell me something unedited,” he murmured.
Steve shrugged.  “One of mom’s coworkers makes really good cannelloni.”
Steve glanced back down at her.  “Would you like me to sign your dress?”
Reply from
“Sure.”  Sam nodded.  “He’s gotta come over and see you and your bike again to get that fancy-ass suit back.”
Steve grinned over at her.  “Have I told you lately how glad I am I hired you?”
“Not really, no,” Tony agreed.  “Why didn’t Sam know why I was here?”
alone, but the worst, the absolute hardest thing, was hoisting that trophy and knowing she wouldn’t see me and getting my ring and having no one to show it to.”
“I--yeah--that is, I think so?”  He smiled sheepishly at her.  “I’m not honestly sure what the USO does, or what you’d like me to do.”
with anyone until your season’s over.  You and I can have a verbal agreement about representation, and then we formalize once your season ends.”
.”  She stared each of them down before she continued.  “You need to realize that the definition for wild and reckless and dangerous and illegal has just gotten much narrower for you.  Going out to see and be seen at the hottest clubs even the night before a game. Those repeated speeding tickets. Stepping out on your wife or girlfriend with someone else.  Having marijuana or a weapon in your bag at the airport. While these may be the sorts of things my team and I get paid to handle, they are certainly not the kinds of things we
God.  He couldn’t.  Or, at least, he shouldn’t.  Although he could name a fair few times when ‘shouldn’t’ hadn’t exactly stopped him.
Steve leaned down and kissed him again.  “Flattery will get you everywhere, mister.”
He pointed at Tony’s violently pink smoothie.  “Is that all you’re having?”
in finding fur-ever homes for our animals.  Come on down to Prospect Park and meet your new furry friend.
He glanced down the range, trying to picture the ball sailing towards one of the targets then back down at his ball and pulled back to swing.  The hollow metallic sound of the club making solid contact with the ball made Steve smile. The ball dropping neatly into the netting lit blue from beneath made him grin.  “I can see why people like this,” he said, turning back to Tony.
Natasha sighed, breaking him out of his thoughts.  “What am I about to be dealing with here, Rogers?” she asked gently.
“Close…” Steve gasped at the ceiling, too far gone to even mind that the relentless combination of Tony’s mouth and hands were tugging him to the edge quicker than he normally liked.
“You’re free for tonight, but Erskine has a couple more prospects who aren’t first round material here this weekend,” she continued, apparently oblivious to his silent panic.  “I gotta babysit them since Abe stayed back to man the farm.” She squeezed his arm. “Celebrate, but don’t do anything stupid. You know the drill.”
“I wanted breakfast for dinner and I needed to clean some about-to-go-bad veggies out of the fridge.  So, frittata.”  Steve put his phone down and glanced back over his shoulder.  “Don’t feel like you have to wait on me to eat.”

Good Lord.  These reporters just didn’t know when to let something lie.  He ran back over to the rest of the team who’d gathered in front of the student section, wrapping an arm around Jamaal to slow himself down.  “Still can’t believe we did it,” he murmured.
Steve smiled.  Tony could sure be charming.
As the kids ran off to play, the rest of the adults started to filter back out of the house to enjoy the late afternoon sun.  Scott and Maggie came out to claim the bench next to the coolers, rocking slowly with a sleeping Cassie in her arms, and Clint’s wife Laura came to sit next to Clint with their baby who was also sacked out asleep.  Hopkins had claimed a seat under the patio with his mom, and Steve watched him lean in to describe what was happening to her.  The gaggle of kids who’d taken up playing with Bucky’s footballs all begged Steve and Fitz to throw with them once they really got started.
“What’s he doing to you now?” Sam asked as he fell in next to Steve to start stretching.
The Obscurely Cool Tunes playlist is real.  One of my coworkers made it and every song on there is, according to him, something everyone knows and belts out without shame, no matter who you are.  He’s not wrong.
She pinned him to his chair with a direct stare.  “Do you have plans to enter the Draft, Steve?”
“Fort Knox, I see,” he jibed.
“You are.  Don’t let anyone tell you different,” Sam said with a solemn nod.
T’Challa shrugged.  “I’ve heard some...concerns...about our starter.”
“No kidding,” Jamaal answered with a bemused shake of his head.  “National champs forever, man.”
Natasha jabbed him in the ribs.
“Says you,” Clint retorted.  “I just get to pound field goals and PATs and nobody’s really trying to block anything yet.”
Tony swooped in and planted one more kiss on the corner of Steve’s mouth.  “I’ll be back before you know it.”  And with a wave, he was out the door and down the steps.
Bucky and Volstagg, the gold C gleaming mutely on their jerseys, motioned everyone in.  When they spoke, they spoke together.  “Avengers, assemble on three.  One...two...three…”
Tony silenced him with a quick, sharp kiss.  “Nothing below the belt, All American.  Promise.”
Natasha glanced up from her phone as they stepped on the escalator.  “When we get downstairs, don’t stop. Vegas is a mob scene on a regular weekend, and this weekend everyone wants a piece of draftee meat. I’ve got an Uber waiting for us.”
“You’re gonna give me a heart attack one of these days, Final Destination.”
Tony glanced at him out of the corner of his eye.  “You think it’s that easy?”
“Who’re you texting?”  Sam asked before trying to make a grab for Steve’s phone.
Sam rolled his eyes.  “Hearteyes motherfucker,” he called over his shoulder as he stepped into his first lunge.
Steve finally let himself smile back, let himself get caught up in Tony’s boundless enthusiasm.  “Alright. As long as dinner’s in my meal plan.”

as possible, thanks.”
“Wants me to volunteer with the USO.”
“Your birthday’s tomorrow?” Tony asked when Steve came back downstairs.  He pointed at the card the neonatal team had sent.

The woman had finally wrestled both the bowl trophy and the AFCA trophy into Phillips’ hands, and the man with her stepped forward to announce the MVP awards.
Welcome Home
Sharon looked at him over the edge of her laptop.  “You’re single?”
Steve shoved him down the last step and out the gate.  “Who am I to argue with crowdsourcing?”
Steve ran his fingertip over the delicate raised ink on her business card, but shook his head.  “Season’s not over yet, so I can’t sign with anyone,” he repeated his words from his conversation with Natasha earlier in the afternoon.  “Plus, I may not even get an invite to the Combine. Pretty pointless me having an agent then.”
“Honestly?”  Steve shook his head at the memory of the look on his mother’s face when he’d brought home the parent packet for seventh grade football.  “Because it made my mom mad.  I’m pretty sure the only reason she said yes was because she figured I was so scrawny no coach in his right mind would ever put me in the game.”
“OTAs start on Monday, and we thought ya might need some help getting settled.”
Steve nodded and trotted out the back of the end zone and up the tunnel, still fiddling with the football in his hands.  He knew his time playing college ball was almost over, and while he’d had his mom to help him figure out which college recruiters had actually considered him as a whole player and which ones were full of so much bull, he didn’t have her now.  What’s more, he’d admitted to himself when the first agent had come sniffing around that she wouldn’t really have been able to help him even if she’d felt up to--
He glanced at a woman at the end of the front row.  “Ms Hill needs to speak with you about the off-field part of this week’s work, and then we’ll get going.”
Tony Stark, Steve had realized early in their relationship, sucked cock like he built flying metal suits: with his undivided attention and the full force of his genius.  He swirled his tongue over the head of Steve’s cock, making his stomach clench up as pleasure built low in his core.
“HUD updates for the suit.  Trying to cut lag on some response times.”
Tony gestured at Steve.  “Look at him. He’s clearly got everything it takes to succeed as the face of a franchise.  Why would I want to saddle myself with anyone else when I could saddle myself with Steve.”
Steve nodded.  “That.  Kinda leery of some JJ Watt wannabe trying to do something flashy to make a highlight reel and getting someone hurt.”
“You ready for this?” Phillips asked as he and his wife slid into the seats on Steve’s other side just as the lights over the seats were beginning to lower.
“Just ignore him,” T’Challa advised.  “He’s not content unless he’s the center of attention.”
Steve offered him a small smile.  “Just...reminding myself I deserve to want things.  That I don’t belong solely to my job.”
“Thor?” Steve guessed.
She blushed and ducked her head, suddenly shy.  “Ashleigh.” She looked back up at him. “Are you really gonna play for us?”
Steve nodded.  “Sure, Buck.”
“Natalie Rushman?” Steve asked, raising an eyebrow at the name on her business card.
“Can’t argue with results,” Steve said.  “What does Raul do?”
“Get out of here, jerk,” Steve said, shooing him out of the kitchen with a laugh.
“Our Bucky.” Tony whispered, the ache in his chest growing, not realizing that the sobs he was hearing were his own. Hanging onto both of his husbands, all he could do was weep as they waited desperately through each second for the help that couldn’t come fast enough.
“We need to get them something they can safely climb on,” Steve said, getting up with a sigh. “Maybe one of those climbing walls, but with the helmets and ropes and that. We have to do something before one of them breaks something again. Penny! Penny, stop that!”
“Please say with us,” Bucky said, offering his metal hand out to Tony, looking up at him expectantly. “I want you here. We want you here.”
“How?” Tony asked, perplexed as to how he could salvage any of this at this point.
“I don’t care about that,” Bucky said softly, turning his head to the side to face Steve. “I don’t care what lies you have to tell, I just don’t want to die, and I don’t want our babies to either.”
“I told you, I have to scan my food. This…does that,” Bucky said, waiting for a read out on the screen before opening the container to get his cupcake. Carefully peeling off the wrapper, he dumped it in the small garbage bin beside his dresser, about to bite into the cake when he turned and looked at the other man. “…thanks, Steve.”
“What will happen with Sarah and Natasha?” Pepper asked, though she wasn’t sure she wanted to know. She hoped Tony wasn’t going to throw them out, but they might be a constant reminder for him.
“Yes please,” Steve grinned, looking back at the mirror at the uneven beard he’d tried desperately to keep neat. He didn’t quite have Jarvis’s skills though.
After telling Bucky he would be back in a few hours, Steve set off on his motorcycle to a coffee shop by his old apartment, feeling like he had a heavy stone in his stomach. This hadn’t been an easy decision, but nothing had been easy since he realized he loved Bucky. He knew what had happened the last time someone had fallen for Bucky, and he had to accept that it was a real possibility that he was endangering his life. Even getting on his motorcycle that morning had been stressful, not knowing if it was going to explode when he turned the key. Obviously Howard Stark hadn’t figured out what was going on yet, and it had to stay that way, even if it meant never telling Bucky how he felt about him.
“I don’t blame them for wanting a revolution, I’d want one too,” Tony mused, rubbing his beard as he began to think about righting some of these wrongs. “It sounds like the death penalty is getting out of hand. Someone doesn’t need to die because they stole from a rich person.”
Steve tightened his arm around Bucky, his brow furrowing as he looked at Tony, only coming to one conclusion here. “I’m going to carry him,” he said casually as if it was nothing to carry a thirty five week pregnant man a quarter of a mile.
“Just as long as it’s a yes now, I’m hap-ohhh…” Bucky whimpered, Steve’s expert digits exploring deep within him, hitting gold with every twitch. “I just want to do something for you both, I want to make you both feel good. I don’t think I’d feel like a good husband if I didn’t.”
“Thank you again for that,” Bucky said as he came back to the door, stepping through into the hall. He felt awkward as hell, not knowing where to put his arm, finally letting it just hang at his side. These clothes weren’t as dressy as the ones he wore to supper, but they were still nicer than he was used to. Also, he was pretty sure he’d forgotten everything Pepper told him about etiquette. “Uhm…after you?”
“My Uncle has been trying to kill you, just the same as he’s been trying to set me up with Victor Von Doom,” the rage in Tony’s tone shook his voice to the core, his dark eyes shining with anger in the light of the flame. “He’s betrayed my trust, he’s fleeced my people with his fake high taxes, and he tried to make me marry that…Fury filled me in on who Von Doom really is. He’s a tyrant that oppresses his people into lives of slavery and torture. He’s a monster, and he was ready do to that to the Iron Kingdom.”
“But a commoner? What will they know about ruling?” Stane demanded, getting to his feet in a flash.
“I don’t know. A lot,” Bucky mumbled, playing with the loose arm of his undershirt, still nervous about taking it off.
“No kidding,” Bucky rolled his eyes, going over to the door to get his dressing gown, not really feeling like standing around in his underwear. “Who is he?”
“I don’t know yet…” Tony trailed off, looking over at the wall at a picture of him posed with a greyhound. He hated that picture, mostly because the dog bit him afterwards. “I feel like I’ll know when the time is right, but for now, I have to keep perfecting my craft.”
“You are doing good, my son,” Sarah said as she reached out to tousle his messy blond hair. “Bar fights can get bigger and very dangerous, you’re saving lives by ending them before they end in murder. And, as sure as I am that cats can get down on their own, you saved its owner from worry.”
“Of course,” Tony said, watching as Bucky disappeared in his room, letting out a deep breath. He felt better knowing that Bucky loved the gift, though he couldn’t help thinking if he could have made him something easier to use.
“Oh, I-seriously? I work in client care, I really think you have the wrong guy if you’re thinking of top secret, I just make sure clients are happy and-“ Steve shook his head, wide eyed, hoping this was all some weird mistake. “I don’t get why I’m here.”
“It’ll get lighter soon,” Tony laughed as he led Bucky down the stone stairs, holding the lantern in front of him. When he got to the bottom, he let go of Bucky to approach a large wood ring covered in oil lamps. Lighting each one, he placed a glass sleeve around them before pulling a rope, sending the whole thing skyward with a pulley. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to send light through the whole room.
“Any time, Bucky,” Steve said, hoping that this was as good a first impression as it seemed. He still had a lot of time to fuck it up still, he hadn’t managed to push that idea out of his head. “Is there anything else you like that I can bring in for you? Or order? I can go to the cafeteria and get anything you want.”
“Are you really sure you want to do this? It’s not to late to back out,” Stane asked his nephew, straightening the dark blue robes he only brought out for special occasions. He figured today was as good a time as any to wear them, and he wasn’t alone in deciding to dress up for today.
“It’s nothing, don’t worry,” reassured Stane, patting Von Doom’s arm, though his own nerves were getting rather frayed. This wasn’t the Tony he’d been able to control all these years, this was a very different man standing before him.
“I’m okay with you and Steve, I don’t need anyone else,” Bucky insisted, relaxing in Tony’s arms, feeling like everything seemed right in his world for once. “I just want you two.”
“I can’t see anything,” Bucky chuckled quietly, eager for the moment when he could take this hood off his head. He was nervous he was going to trip as they went through the door and down a flight of stone stairs, wishing he could reach out and grab onto the wall. There wasn’t one on his side, however, so Steve was going to have to do.
“I do no such thing,” Tony pursed his lips, fighting his facial muscles to keep them serious.
“You may wear whatever you want, Mr. Rogers, very few people will see you down here,” Ms. Carr said as she pressed the button for the elevator, the doors opening immediately, closing once they’d stepped inside.
“Bucky?” Tony asked as Bucky’s eyes slowly fluttered open, not really focusing on anything. “Bucky, you’re okay, we’re just at a hospital, we’re right here with you.”
“Steve…” Bucky got up to do as he was told, but he was clearly worried about something. “How am I going to climb out? You’re going to have to go without me.”
“Keep your hair, you have beautiful hair…” Tony reached up to pull the elastic off of Bucky’s ponytail, putting it on his wrist so he was free to run his fingers through the soft strands. Looking down at Bucky, his hand tightening in the young man’s hair to tilt his head, he didn’t have time to think as he leaned down and pressed their lips together. Closing his eyes, Tony moaned softly into the kiss as he pushed Bucky back up against his work desk, leaning him into it.
“Why are you still burning this place? What about Namor’s body?” Bucky asked, wanting more for his friend than to just be left in a burning building.
“Oh gods, thank you,” Bucky relaxed completely, flopping against the back of the couch as he downed his whiskey in a gulp. He didn’t realize how tense he’d been, knowing Natasha was going to be okay was all the relief he needed.
“Yes, that has to be today,” Pepper said, trying not to sound as irritated as she was, lest Tony take the opportunity to drive her insane. “You need to clean up, you need to get dressed…”
“You’ve only missed an hour of their life, don’t worry, you were having a little trouble waking up after the anesthetic,” Tony smiled, reaching to pet Bucky’s hair. “Do you want to say hello to your son?”
“I liked it,” Bucky said with a smile, finding a tiny way that he could be better than Steve and running with it.
“Like we can’t afford a new van,” Tony joked, though he would take Bucky seriously, and he was pretty sure his husband knew that.
“That’s everything from me,” Bucky nodded, giving Tony a smile as he helped himself to some more meat. He didn’t think Tony needed to know that he wanted to influence him into lowering taxes and sparing the poor. And beating Steve Rogers for the chance to do so was even sweeter.
“Always,” Steve brought his hand down hard on Bucky’s ass cheek, leaving a reddened print behind. “He’s always liked pushing me, I think because he thinks I’ll fuck him harder if he pisses me off a bit.”
“The council helps with that,” Strange replied, summoning two cups of tea for them with a wave of his hand. “And my own studies help as well. I remind myself of what exists out there in terms of magic, the sorcerers I have met that could tear reality apart. I embrace my fears so I will not forget, and that keeps me grounded.”
“I want to do this, it’s fine,” Bucky repeated, pinching the bridge of his nose, trying to focus on the spot of pain rather than the wand against his stomach. “I can do this. I’ve been made for one thing in this world and I’m going to get it right.”
“You could be right about that,” Stane wanted to sound like he was supporting the idea as he began to think of how he could unravel it before it began.
“What do…what do you mean?” Bucky queried, having almost dropped his glass to the floor as he forgot it was in his hand. “What do you…what’s going to happen? How can…?”
“Are you okay, Steve?” Peggy asked, putting down her eye pencil to walk over to him, putting the back of her hand against his brow.
Bucky looked into Steve’s eyes to see if he was serious, cautiously extending his hand until Steve took it, helping him from the back of the car carefully. Giving Bucky a kiss on the forehead, Steve scooped him up into his arms with a grunt, trying not to act like Bucky was heavy, that was the last thing he needed. Nodding at Tony, Steve began to walk, heading for the main road with Tony close behind him in the SUV.
“I can try to stop the marriage based on the fact that there’s no precedent for it, I can maybe delay the wedding,” Stane breathed out, trying to think of who he could get on his side to help with this. He didn’t see the older members of the royal council being entirely for this.
“Uhm…I don’t know, older than twenty, I guess…not older than, say, forty five,” Tony shrugged, still playing with the paperweight. “Male, female, other…none of that bothers me. Neither does family background, or kingdom of origin. If their father or sister did something, I don’t want that held against them. It doesn’t really matter where they come from.”
“I thought you might at first, but that you’d see sense,” Howard said, figuring he was going to have to speed things up. “Come on, I’ll take you to meet him, you’ll feel better once you get to know him.”
“So what happened to you this morning?” Bucky asked, more interested in Steve than the video games, or himself.
“You’re a grown man, Tony, and King. What’s he going to do to you?” asked Rhodey, looking over at some gardeners pruning the roses. Tony definitely picked a nice place to meet, he’d have to suggest this again in the future.
“You said the coffee was popular with everyone,” Bucky answered, forcing himself to smile politely at her. He wasn’t much in the practice of smiling at strangers. “And it’s not a guess, Steve and his mother love blue things.”
“How you holding up, Buck?” Steve asked, pressing a kiss to the side of his head. “You’re so good at this, I can’t believe what a diplomat you can be. I’d never thought you had it in you, and I’m proud of you. I should probably say that more.”
(This chapter is NSFW)
“I don’t think anyone would want to deal with that fallout, I’m well aware in my court who would put their names forward,” Tony’s voice was dark, hating to admit that the Kingdom needed him to stay alive and in power. He hated feeling that important. “Someone would be smarter to take a move now, when all they have to do is marry me to win it. There are a lot of people that could have paid for an assassin for their own chance.”
“I can look into that,” Pepper said as she nodded, pausing her pencil on the paper as she looked up at him. “Tony, maybe you should take a couple days to relax after what happened. I’m all for throwing yourself into your rule, but maybe you should wait a few days. A few days won’t make you too late to fix some of these issues.”
“That sounds wonderful,” setting down his glass on the table, Von Doom crossed the room to stand next to Pepper, looking down at the shorter woman. “Speak to Valeria, she’ll let you know everything I require for my stay here. I should like to have her with me when we go to our rooms.”
“How much do you think we need? Are we trying to fill the box?” Steve asked, bending down to pick up a few more sticks, carrying them over to the wheelbarrow.
Staring into Sam’s eyes for a moment, Steve reached into the inner pocket of his leather jacket, pulling out a sealed white envelope and setting on the table. Setting his hand on it, he paused for a moment before pushing it towards Sam.
“Okay, I think we can fit her there, just let me…” Steve carefully adjusted Peter so he was closer to Bucky before putting Gwen next to him. “There we go, it’s a good thing they’re small.”
“Yeah…” Steve said as he gave Bucky a weak smile, turning with Ms. Carr to leave the room. Bucky’s pale blue eyes haunting him all the way down the corridor as his words echoed in Steve’s mind.
“So you two like this place then?” Tony smiled, looking at them both, gently rubbing Bucky’s arm before his hand moved to Steve’s side. “I mean, we can paint if you don’t want wood walls, or-“
“I do worry about you. It’s easier to worry about other people. I’ll unpack the whole thing with my father another day, but I don’t have the energy to do it now. I’m dealing with my real family,” Tony said, hoping that Steve got the hint that he was serious about that and that he didn’t want to discuss it. “I knew you’d check him in under James Stark-Rogers, you know, you’re kind of predictable.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispered, watching as Bucky’s gaze seemed to drift off, knowing that the pain of their death weighed heavy on him. “How old were you?”
“What??” Bucky’s plate went flying as he jumped to his feet, his jaw dropped as he shook his head. “What were you thinking?”
“Fuck…” Tony whispered, leaning forward over his coffee, closing his eyes, fighting between his heart and his head when he heard a knock on the door behind him. Sitting upright, he pretended to be busy, removing the legs off his robot. “Come in.”
“You ready, Steve?” Tony queried, getting closer to Steve, putting his hand on the other man’s back, bending him over a little. “Are you sure you’re good with this?”
“It’s a new type of steel manufactured by our top metallurgists, it’s twice the strength of normal steel and half the weight,” Von Doom said as he knelt down to pick up a single bar, bringing it over to put in Tony’s hand. “It was to be a wedding gift for you, but I hope you’ll accept it still. Maybe it could be put towards something good in their memory.”
“We won’t say a word,” Steve said, managing to keep a straight face, even if Bucky couldn’t. He could feel him smiling against his shoulder. “Hugging is okay though?”
Steve turned to the contract, looking over the job description to see if there was anything Ms. Carr had neglected to mention. His eyes stopped when they hit something she hadn’t brought up yet, looking up at her curiously. “What does this mean? This part about his eighteenth birthday?”
“I’m not an asshole, I love Sarah, she deserves this life,” Bucky reached up to tuck a piece of hair behind his ear, looking over at Steve but only managing to focus on his legs.
“Why does your mug say ‘Sexy Grandma’?” Bucky asked first, laughing a little. “Sure we can talk. About what?”
“We can do that,” Steve whispered, not bothering to wipe the tears from his eyes as he leaned his head against Bucky’s. “I love you, Buck.”
“It’s so nice to have such thankful people come to live with us,” Pepper smiled, backing off to let Jarvis have room to work on Steve. “You’re going to have some tailors come in too to make you some new clothes. We’ll get both of your measurements and have some clothes made as soon as possible. Do either of you have a colour you like?”
“I thought I could trust Steve before,” Bucky replied, glaring at Steve angrily, his hand balling into a fist. “And it cost me an arm.”
“Good, I’m glad,” Tony relaxed, standing a little closer to Bucky as he turned back to the shelf. Time to lighten the mood again. “Do you want to see me wind the rest of these up?”
“I’m sure if King Anthony met everyone one at a time in the kingdom, he wouldn’t be getting married in time,” Steve said, wondering if that rumour he’d heard about the King’s thirty fifth birthday coming up. “Do you really think he’s just desperate enough to marry anyone?”
“What colour are you at, Buck?” Steve asked, not wanting to rush Bucky in if he needed more time to build up his courage, though he didn’t want Bucky to have to go through pain because they were delaying things.
“Depends what the question is,” Tony said, filling his glass again, clearly not caring that it was still early in the day.
“And Steve too,” Tony repeated, pressing a kiss to Bucky’s forehead, rubbing the tip of his just under his hairline. “I don’t think you two could be  separated, and that’s good, because I think you two belong together. I just hope I belong with you both too.”
“You will, but don’t feel bad, my vote still trumps yours,” Tony smiled, nuzzling Bucky’s head before pressing a kiss to it. “Not that I plan on voting against you in anything, you both seem to be pretty intelligent and thoughtful. Frankly, I think everyone should be thrilled there will be three Kings to get everything done. This is going to be much more productive.”
“Has he been arrested?” questioned Bucky, really hoping the answer to that was yes. He didn’t want to have to be afraid any longer.
“She’d met someone,” Steve said, which was true, it was easier than explaining that his feelings had changed. “It’s fine, it ended on a really good note. We still love each other as friends, and now she can be with the guy she likes.”
“And Steve too?” Bucky asked, letting go of Tony just enough to look up into his eyes.
“Blessed are they,” the congregation repeated obediently, Sarah Rogers eyes shining with tears as she spoke with them.
“So what would you do if I asked you to kiss me again?” Bucky asked, his voice sweet as he looked over at Tony and batted his lashes.
“…it’ll be okay…” Bucky mumbled after a moment, knowing that Natasha would kill him if he blew this chance just because he wanted to punch Steve. “You won’t have any problems with me.”
“I never really thought about…” Natasha let out a long breath, reaching up to touch a piece of hair brushing against her cheek. She’d had the same hair for most of her life, she didn’t bother cutting it until it was nearly to her waist. Now she had the opportunity for something new, something bold, and she was going to take it. “Could you cut it to around my jaw line?”
“Tony’s fine here, yes,” Tony nodded, gesturing for the two men to sit on one couch whilst he took a seat across from them in a high backed scarlet and oak chair. Reaching over to the table, he poured three glasses, handing two out and taking one for himself, which he held up. “Cheers! You know what cheers is, right?”
“No!” Penny giggled, piling more sand on her head in a typical three year old fashion.
“So, as my first act as your King, your proper King, I will ask for the woman who would be my new mother, and the other who is like a sister to step forward. And I’d ask them to bring to me what I gave to them this morning,” Tony said, keeping his expression as calm as possible as the heavy doors at the back of the chapel opened. He tried to keep his eyes forward as much as he could, but it was hard to not look over at Stane as Sarah and Natasha stepped forward with Steve and Bucky on their arms.
“Uh huh, then why did you cave to my demands so quickly?” Fury pointed out, crossing his arms as he challenged the king, vaguely aware that some of his soldiers thought he was going to spend the night in jail for it.
“You’ll attach it to your body with the harness, obviously,” Tony pointed out, smiling softly as he watched Bucky’s stunned expression. “If you use this lever attached to the arm here, your hand will open and close, and it’ll lock like that until you change it. You can lock the elbow too, so if you wanted to hold something in your hand, you can. It’s just an early model, the next one is going to be a lot better, but this should be good for now. You okay, Bucky?”
“Not so much now, there’s a chunk missing,” Bucky raised his shoulder where his arm had been cleaved cleanly off. Not so much as a hair from his limb had been left, it was taken right from the joint itself.
“Yes, I’m coming,” Bucky said as he came down the stairs wearing sweat pants and one of Steve’s t-shirts, his hair tied back and still wet from the shower. “Tony’s coming too, give him a second.”
“Tony. I want you to call me Tony from now on.”
“I think so,” Bucky said, using some paper towel to clean his stomach off before taking his husbands by their hands, holding them tightly.
“I’ve seen how he looks at you, he’s into this,” Tony reassured him with a little laugh, letting go of Bucky’s hand and putting an arm around him. “Hopefully he didn’t work out too much, or we’ll be brewing some coffee or ordering Red Bull.”
“I still can’t believe you broke up. I guess you don’t tell me everything,” Sam teased, picking up a sugar packet, fiddling with it as he waited to put it into his coffee. “I’m happy for you if you’re both good.”
“Steve let me practice on him a lot,” Bucky purred as he pulled back again, licking a stripe up the side of his dick, pressing another kiss to it. “He’s the only one I’ve been with though, so you can thank him telling me what felt best.”
“I don’t know…” Pepper began to open books frantically, trying to ignore Tony pacing behind her. The last thing she wanted to do was let him down. “I will get to the bottom of this, I promise you, just give me some time.”
“That doesn’t mean I regret it, though,” Tony said stiffly, looking down at the red pillow he was hugging against his chest. “That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t do the same thing again to protect my family.”
“Because Namor’s not likeable and no one wants to marry him,” Natasha said with a shrug, looking over at Namor. “No offence, I love you, you’re just very abrasive.”
“A soldier should be able to afford a small house of his own. I’m glad you’re not in that place, I can’t imagine it’s that clean,” Sarah set the bowl of stew in front of Steve along with a plate with a few biscuits.
“You know what? Fuck this brave ‘let the doctor sleep’ shit, we’re going in now, we need some kind of relief for you. You’re not sitting here in pain,” Tony said, getting up and grabbing the bucket, looking around for anything else they might need. “Don’t we have a bag?”
“Its my understanding that they go to jail,” Pepper took her pencil with the same hand she was holding the book in. “I’ve also heard that any meetings about revolutions or anything like that end in death too.”
“I don’t know. Talking to a stranger alone is a really big step, but you’ve made some of those already,” Steve said, looking at Bucky and taking his hand.
“I’m okay right now, I think I’m too tired to really think about where I am,” Bucky said, though there was some tension in his voice. “Did you take pictures of them yet?”
“And wander more, if there’s an area you shouldn’t be in, the guards will tell you,” Tony added as he gave Steve’s arm a squeeze, hoping he could get the man to open up more. “There aren’t many areas like that, they might not let you in the armoury, and Strange doesn’t like being bothered in his tower, but other than that it’s pretty much open.”
Not before he could start having some pretty interesting thoughts about his fiancés, however.
“Not right now, no, I know you love me  a lot, but I was afraid that maybe down the road, you’d…” Bucky bit his lip hard, not wanting to even think about it, though he felt like Tony deserved the truth. “I thought maybe when the kids were born, and they ask about Grandpa, and you’d realize you’ve had to live without him because of what happened with me.”
“…I suppose I do kind of the same…” Tony admitted after taking a sip of the tea, the best he’d ever had. He’d have to come up here more if this was the level of hospitality. “The kings of old with their mass hangings and burnings, executing people just for not showing perfect loyalty. My father taught me those lessons so I wouldn’t be like that when I grew up.”
“Sam? No. No no,” Steve laughed as he shook his head, a little surprised that Bucky would ask. “Sam is in love with someone else, this girl named Missy. She’s a soldier too, but she’s a higher rank, and he’s pretty sure she doesn’t know who he is.”
“I feel like you’re seeing reason here,” Tony said optimistically, his smile getting wider as he walked over to hold Pepper by her shoulders. “Pepper, my dear, just say the words. Tell me I’m off the hook.”
“Listen to me, Tony. You don’t always get to make the decisions you want to make, King or not,” Stane insisted, taking on a more authoritarian tone. “Marrying Von Doom is the best thing for this kingdom, and you don’t get to be selfish this time. You want to fix this place? He has money, you can take it to make the repairs you want. You will be able to make proper change.”
“Alright, I’ll lead the way,” Howard said with a relaxed laugh, trying to diffuse the situation as much as he could. Honestly, he thought Tony was just being dramatic, he probably needed to get some rest and some actual food. “Tony, once you meet him, it’ll all make sense…”
“…yeah, I want to lie down,” Bucky said, his voice tight and quiet, still feeling like someone had their hand around his throat. “I’m sorry, Steve, I should be stronger, I shouldn’t melt down over every single thing.”
“You scared us,” Steve said, taking out his phone to send a reassuring text to Tony as he walked over to his youngest boyfriend. “What is that, a blood pressure machine? Are you okay?”
“Okay,” Bucky grunted, getting up with a little difficultly. “I don’t want to get any bigger than this.”
“Oh, alright, thank you for letting me know,” Steve said, stepping aside as she emerged from the room, putting the blood pressure machine back in the far corner. “How is he?”
Steve leaned back in the chair, feeling like someone had just knocked the wind out of him. How could he do this job knowing what they’d done to Bucky, but how could he abandon him? Ms. Carr had talked about Steve staying on after Bucky was moved, meaning he was going to be going with Bucky to Stark Mansion. He was going to be holding Bucky’s hand through getting pregnant, having kids, and the fallout of both on his tortured mind. He was convinced this could be enough to kill the young man, and he doubt Howard Stark cared for a second as long as he got a baby from his own bloodline.
“Our people can talk and see what they come up with. I don’t think it’s up to us Kings to negotiate the finer details of trade when there are more knowledgeable bodies to do so,” Von Doom said with a grin, having a good feeling that Tony was walking forward right into this. He was already proving himself important, now he had to prove himself as the perfect spouse.
“As ready as I’m going to get,” Tony gave Pepper a weak smile, handing her the glass as he took a deep breath in. “Wish me luck.”
“You’re such a good son,” Sarah took Steve by the arm, smiling up at him. “I had a very nice time with you today, but you can go see Sam if you’d like. He’s probably not very happy that he had to work.”
“…I think I’m pregnant…” Bucky squeaked, taking a shaky breath as he looked at the blank screen of the ultrasound machine, the image that had been on it burnt onto his brain.
“The people that sent these guards need to think they succeeded, and the body will help that narrative,” Fury took one of the robes, handing it to Bucky. “I have a pin so we can put your sleeves together, and the arm is already stuffed, no one should suspect anything.”
“Are you okay, Bucky?” Steve asked, squeezing his hand, feeling like Bucky needed him more than he needed to panic in his own head.
Curled up on the bed with the blanket pulled over him, Bucky was curled up, clutching his pillow to his chest. He’d heard Steve come in, but he wasn’t ready to be social, not yet, he didn’t want Steve to see him cry.
“You could, I’d appreciate that,” Steve said, taking a deep breath to push down his crushing disappointment at giving up both his art and Tony. “So…is it a deal then?”
“That’s me,” Bucky smiled as he raised his hand, though he knew he’d have loved any outcome.
“Not quite. Steve, his eyes,” Tony ordered as Steve covered Bucky’s eyes with his hands, watching to make sure the youngest man couldn’t see anything before he walked over to the corner. Picking up a wood box, he carried it over and placed it on his couch in front of Bucky. Opening it, he lifted his creation up, a brilliant work of wood, iron, and leather, and nodded at Steve to lift his hands away.
“I do, good sir,” Bucky nodded a little before catching himself and stilling his head. “With a full heart and a clear head.”
“Would it help if I fucked you while you fucked him?” Tony asked, noticing Steve getting out of breath fast, his face flushed bright red as sweat weighed down his hair. “I mean, I know I can always get my cock sucked again, right Bucky? You seem pretty eager, I’m going to guess you like doing it.”
“So which one’s real?” Tony asked her, holding his hand out to take the books from her to examine them himself.
“I’d say hopefully they’ll be too drunk to care, but there are a lot of violent drinkers out there,” Steve turned around, looking through the crowd for one particular face, though not wanting to find it at the same time. “Whatever happens, just hold on to me and don’t let go.”
“How was your day? How do you like it here?” Tony asked curiously, knowing that Steve hadn’t asked Pepper for much in the way of things to do or have. “You know, you can ask us for anything, you don’t have to hold back on our behalf.”
“How often can we do that?” Bucky asked softly, his eyes closed, a little smile on his face as he ran it all through his head again.
“Tony. Right, yes. What would you like, Tony?”
“Oh shit!” Tony jumped up a little, looking over the edge of his bed at Laika who was whimpering and scratching at the floor. “What’s wrong? Need to go out?” Looking at the clock, he was surprised that it was past nine, though he supposed they all needed the sleep. Rolling over to cuddle his husbands, he frowned when he realized that only Steve was there. “Steve? Where’s Bucky?”
“Why, because you would have given them that name too?” Steve shot back with a smile, some of the tension in the room starting to fade.
“Thank you, I appreciate that, I’ll be in touch,” Dr. Marner said before turning the feed off, knowing the three men wanted to celebrate.
“You’re definitely not being stupid,” Steve said, looking up at the screen again, the reality of the situation burrowing deeper into his brain. “I’m scared too, Bucky, I don’t want anything bad to happen to you. I’m sorry this puts you at such risk.”
“They’re coming,” Steve said, looking over to make sure the big guy was still down and the doctor wasn’t planning anything. “What can you do? There has to be something more than just trying to hold his blood in.”
Steve did the search on his phone, looking at the multiple pictures of yolk sacs, his eyes moving back to the screen to compare them. It was all the convincing he needed, he was pretty sure based on this that Bucky was right.
“I don’t see how I’m more likeable than Namor…” Bucky’s voice was weak, and he wished they had a bottle of something strong. The thought of being the King’s consort made him nauseous. He didn’t want to lie around in luxury all day, or have any social expectations on him. He wanted to be left alone with his goats.
“No! No, you can’t do this!” Stane shouted as Fury pulled his hands behind his back to bind them together. “I made this stupid fucking kingdom and it will fall apart without me! Everything will fall apart, and I will laugh in your faces!”
“I haven’t been told it’s not,” Tony shrugged, still giggling every time he remembered that they both wanted to marry him. He probably shouldn’t have drunk so much. “I’m going to tell Pepper about this and everything will get moving and we’ll have a wedding in six days.”
“Perfect, let me know what he says,” Tony finished his coffee, plunking the cup down with a smile on his face. “Try to think up some more acts, maybe a short play, some musicians, something like that. Just get back to me on that.”
“You love me, gods I love hearing that,” Steve sighed, moving closer to Bucky so he could wrap an arm around him, pulling him closer. “Say it more often, until I have it burned into my memory.”
“Bucky…” Steve began, about to try to hug him when Bucky picked the cards up and held them out again. Staring at the backs of them, dark blue with the company logo in silver, Steve didn’t know if he wanted to hear any more today. But if Bucky wanted to talk, there’s no way he could tell him no. Reaching out, he pulled out a card, flipping it over to reveal the eight of clubs. “Bucky, that’s a lot, if you can’t think of-“
“Yes, but they’re old and in disrepair, it’s mostly been the thatch roofing that kept us dry,” Bucky tried to think of where he’d seen the roof leak in the past, hoping he could find a weak spot that way. “I think there’s a spot over here.”
“I thought you wanted pork chops for supper,” Tony said as he half watched the twins, half returned to his lounge chair and beer.
“Oh, tons, swarms of them,” Steve grinned, watching Bucky fix his hair, hoping it was a good sign that he’d be in a brighter mood today, despite the worries on his mind. “If you eat anything on the street, eagles will attack you for it. That’s why people have leashes for toddlers, in case an eagle tries to steal them.”
“I’ve heard word that stealing from the businesses and homes of the upper class is automatic hanging,” Pepper looked back into Tony’s eyes, frowning. “Hurting them, or murdering one, you lose your head.”
“Give him a moment, then we’ll go up,” Steve listened for a moment to see if he could hear Bucky in their room, his hand moving from Tony’s wrist to his hand. “I don’t think this was something your father went over with him, he’s kind of talking like this is his purpose in life again so I’m guessing he’s going back to that nonsense to figure out a way of coping with two babies in him at once.”
Bucky Barnes was smitten.
“You say those words as if they’re terrible,” Tony reached out, picking up a small blue bottle and examining it until Strange snatched it out of his hands. “Can I touch anything here?”
Bucky climbed out of bed just after four in the morning for his third trip to the bathroom that night, his back aching more than usual as he shuffled to the bathroom. He’d managed to get away this time without waking anyone, though that was probably because both Tony and Steve had been up with him during his other bathroom breaks and they needed the sleep. Bucky didn’t mind, they’d been spoiling him continuously since he was put on strict bed rest a few weeks before. He felt guilty that they’d been working so hard for him, but he knew deep down that they would probably rather do that and ensure he and the babies were fine than have Bucky do his share of the dishes.
“Yes, I’m talking to Strange,” Tony mocked her lightly, grinning at the face she made back at him. “I promise, I’ll have him front and center, doing lots of tricks to impress both young and old.”
“Then you run out of air, plus most animals can open them back up again,” Steve smiled, glad that he could be silly with Bucky, it seemed to be lightening the mood in the room. It amazed him that Bucky could still have a sense of humour after everything he’d been through. Steve was pretty sure that was what was keeping him going.
“I’m here now. I know it’s too late, but I’m here now, I promise you,” Steve pledged to Bucky, fingers gripping the black material of his clothes. “I’m not going anywhere, I’m not-“
“I think it’s okay now, but I do agree about the towel part,” Bucky chuckled, amused to see that Steve was blushing as well.
“Pepper, I’m begging you, let me do this my way.”
“You’re going to hate me…” Bucky wept, trying to jab the saw into the wood again, though it fell from his weak grip. “You’re going to hate…”
“Now’s a good a time as any,” Bucky said with a shrug, unable to keep smiling himself as he gave Tony a squeeze, wishing he could do the same with Steve beside him. Instead, he leaned a head against the other man, knowing that he would know what that meant.
“He’s still got the chip in his neck, the perimeter of the mansion will keep him inside if Tony insists on having him live upstairs, but if he’d rather Bucky live downstairs, a room has been constructed for him,” Howard just smiled, looking like the cover of the company magazine as he masked his true feelings behind the Stark persona he seemed to slip into every time he tried to justify what he’d done to Bucky. “A lot of time, money, and effort have gone into making Bucky what he is, Mr. Rogers, wouldn’t it be silly to not insure that he stays where he needs to be?”
“ It’s okay. No one is gonna hurt you Peter. Not until I am here.”, Steve promised without even thinking. There is no one in the lab now and Steve is sure Tony has taken them away from the door. This might be the only time he could assure him freely.
“ I think there is something your Dad isn’t telling us. Peter’s file isn’t here. He said he has put in a request and it will take time.”, Steve replied.
“ Not yet, sweet heart. Not before I get my daughter.”, his grip tightened on his stomach and Peter gasped, breathing harshly now.
“ What doesn’t matter? You can tell me anything, if you want to.”, Steve added softly. His hands fell on his lap, fidgeting now. Steve understood why Tony said this was a sensitive case. The boy looks completely withdrawn, as if he is afraid to hope for anything better.
“ Yeah, I am fine just... I saw the kid Tony. Nineteen years old and he trusts no one. It must’ve been terrible.”, Steve pinched the bridge of his nose.
“ Tell me about it. Specially the fountain on the entrance.”, Steve said.
“ It’s alright Peter, everything is going to be alright.”, Howard’s hand was getting closer to him. Peter was gasping for his breath and Steve never felt this helpless before. Drugs were out of question because of the baby.
But why did it feel so real?
“ Were you ever gonna tell me about this?”, he gestured between Tony and Steve. He gritted his teeth at the shameless man in front of him.
“ Dr. Rogers. Nice of you to join us here.”, Howard Stark stood up and shook his hand.
“ Dad stop!”, Tony said in a stern voice and Howard stopped.
“ And who is them?”, even though Tony knows it, Bucky needs to say it. He pressed his lips into a thin line, glaring at Tony.
“ Tony, TONY WAKE UP!”, Steve screamed but Tony didn’t even stir. He looked at Howard who was only inches away his face.
“ If you want to work here, you need to..”, but Tony lost his patience this time.
“ It’s not possible. She was gone in mysterious circumstances. Police is still doing the investigation Sammy. There is no way he could know anything about it.”, Tony kept his calm. This is more serious than he thought.
“ What you’re doing is not healthy, for him. He thinks you believe him, he is becoming dependent Sam. You don’t understand how hard it would be for his recovery. I didn’t say anything till now, but..”, Tony ran his hand through his hair in exasperation. Sam is like a big brother, he can’t just assess his authority on him. Tony doesn’t understand why Sam is so involved with Bucky. He is always very professional. Sam looked up and stared blankly in his eyes.
“ Bucky is a very intelligent guy.”, he said out of nowhere. Steve narrowed his eyes but then nodded. They started the session and this time, Peter was talking to him, like really talking. Even if it’s in hidden metaphors and weird language.
Bucky was sitting in Tony’s office again. This time without a smile on his face. In fact, he hasn’t said anything in past seven days. It’s his way of coping. Tony knows that now. He would stop talking and glare at anyone who would strike a conversation with him.
“ Do you want to talk about what happened?”, Tony asked. Bucky didn’t answer, didn’t even look at Tony, just sat still.
“ That day..wh..when you, y’know. What happened?”, Peter asked. His voice was even lower than a whisper. Bucky sighed and looked at him.
Steve decided to talk to Howard about Peter. So he went to his office.
“ If I don’t give him the baby, he is not gonna leave Howard alone. I..I don’t know what to do. Who to ask help from; no one would listen to me. They ..they already think I am crazy.”, Peter was trying really hard to hold his tears in. He was sick of crying all the time. Bucky wished he could lie and say it’s gonna be okay.
“ You know you can tell me anything right? It’s completely confidential. No one knows what we talk.”, Steve briefly looked at the door to give Peter a hint about what he is saying. Peter looked at him for a moment, before giving a weak smile. The boy’s whole face changed when he smiled. For the first time, he looked like he was actually nineteen.
Bucky was sitting on the table in common room, looking around with curious eyes.
“ You said yourself Bucky, you are not afraid to talk. And I know you don’t lie.”, it was right. Bucky would always tell them what he sees. Even if they have told him a million times, that his hallucinations aren’t real. The drugs only make him slow, but he always talks. He would explain his theories, about the black eyed people, about Rumlow, about his father. He never holds anything back. Sometimes, Tony envies him for that. After a few minutes, Bucky finally took a breath and started talking.
“ What’re you talking about?’, Howard looked at him with sincerity.
“ You can talk to me..”, Bucky waited for Peter to get the cue.
“ Sam please, he is my patient. I know you care about him. Don’t you want him to be okay, to be out of here? Please.”, Tony tried to convince him. Sam took a moment to think.
“It’s a surprise to me as well, I didn’t think that King Von Doom was coming in person,” Stane laughed, trying to sound as relaxed as possible as he took his place at Tony’s side. “How are you holding up? Or would you rather have that conversation in private?”
“I’m sure he’ll want to see you. He’d not expecting you, as such, but he thought you might be coming,” Fury looked out the window, keeping his eyes open for anyone looking suspicious. He had half a dozen men accompanying them back to the castle, but he wasn’t taking any chances either.
“You’ll have a car come to pick you up at nine out front of your building tomorrow, you can contact us with this,” Ms. Carr said, reaching into her bag to pull out a Stark phone in a box, setting it in front of him on the table. “You’ll get your clearance tomorrow, and then you will meet him.”
“Yeah yeah, tell us another one,” Fury said as the guards took a hold of Stane, leading them down the aisle Bucky and Steve had just walked up. He was enjoying his slow walk through the chorus of booing, though he didn’t think that Stane was.
“Are you alright, sire? You’ve been staring off at the floor for so long now,” Pepper asked, having already started making notes about turning this wedding into a funeral. The same people would be invited, and food was required at both, so it was largely small details she needed to look after.
“I know…” Steve waited for the sound of the shower upstairs before he turned to Tony, looking very serious. “Tony, if you can’t stay here, you have to tell us now. You have to tell me now.”
“I am, I mean, what else is there to do that night? Besides, it’ll be easy to steal in a crowd like that,” Natasha said with a laugh, though there was something she was holding back on. She knew she was going to have to say it before Namor piped up and dropped the news.
“Sire, I know what happened!” Pepper interjected, rushing over with two books clutched to her chest, somehow looking more stressed out. “Higgins was supposed to sell tickets eighty to one hundred twenty nine. He accidentally skipped ninety, I can see where he made the mistake in his book, and he had the extra ticket at the end so he assumed it was for one hundred thirty. So one of these men got their ticket from Higgins, and one did from Henry.”
“I’ll start a fire,” Steve said, going to the wood stove to throw in some paper and kindling with a smaller log, lighting it up so the flames would be ready for the bits of their floor.
“I will thank her, then,” Tony nodded, wondering just how personal they should be getting right now. She knew Pepper wanted him to keep it light and friendly, but this felt a lot more important. “What happened to your family? Can I ask that?”
“We do not. To be honest with you, it’s never come up,” Stane sighed, shaking his head in frustration, wishing Tony would just let him control him with this as he did with everything else. “We’ve had Kings with mistresses, but not this.”
Steve felt like he was being hit with a tidal wave of emotion, tears pricking the corners of his eyes as he held onto Bucky with everything in him. In the time he’d known Bucky, he’d grown very attached to him. He loved coming into the white room every morning, he loved playing video games, or with one of the many board games, or just sitting and talking about all the things Bucky had missed, and what Steve was going to bring him next. He loved sharing everything he liked with Bucky, and god, he loved seeing the young man’s face light up, it made his heart sing every time.
“Remember how you said to say green if something’s okay, yellow if I’m unsure, and red if I can’t do something?” Bucky said quietly, looking at his hands in his lap, trying to distract himself as much as he could from Tony’s driving. “Red. But I know I can’t stop. I know it’s going to get worse and I’m going to have to do it because it’s what’s best for me. So just…I beg you two, don’t fight or get angry at each other because you’re the only thing I have now that resembles peace, and I need to hang onto you both.”
“I think a pale blue for me, if that’s alright. I’ve always wanted a pale blue dress,” Sarah gushed, feeling tears prick the corners of her eyes as she imagined herself walking down the stairs clad in a beautiful gown with her hair braided in a crown on her head. It had been the thought that got her through many shifts at the docks, and now it was within her grasp.
“Did you put the address in?” Steve asked as he sat down in the drivers seat, looking at Tony sitting beside him. “Is this a long drive? Should we be buying supplies?”
“That is a truly gorgeous sight…” Tony wished he could paint this, he wanted to remember it forever. Watching Steve grip hard onto Bucky and pull him back into each thrust was intoxicating, and the perfect view as he got his dick sucked. “I love watching you two. I can’t wait to fuck your both myself, but right now…I’m where I want to be.”
Walking down the long hallway to the chapel, Fury took them right into the grandly decorated room illuminated by the light of the full moon. The seats were all decorated in red fabric and gold ribbons, with white flowers displayed in crystal vases at the end of every row. At the front hanging above the stage was a beautiful arrangement of flowers with red and gold ribbons draping down from them. On the ribbons were Steve, Bucky, and Tony’s names in flawless script, along with tomorrow’s date.
“I work most of the day, but sometimes I go to the pub with my friend, Sam,” Steve offered, though it really wasn’t the same thing. “I like to draw, but I can’t really afford to spend much time doing it.”
“Tony, you’re going to have to do more than that, you can’t do that to Bucky,” Steve said, feeling bad that Tony was going through so much and had a million things on his mind, but he couldn’t let Bucky suffer either.
How was he supposed to love the King if he was still in love with Bucky?
“Fucking rain…fuck…” James ‘Bucky’ Barnes grumbled as he finished locking the goats in the pen in the yard, heading to the door with wet hair hanging in his face. Stepping inside, he walked past a couple of the other orphans to the fire, plunking down on the ground in front of it when he could get no closer.
As Bucky looked up, his bright blue teary eyes meeting with Tony’s dark ones as they met each for the first time. Tony couldn’t ignore the feeling of his heart aching in his chest looking at the beautiful young man, guilt aching in his chest at the thought that he’d had to give up his entire life just to be a solution to a problem that Tony didn’t even care about.
“I think he’d be a hard pressed to be moreso,” Steve said, trying to brush all the dirt from his laughing daughter’s head. “Tony, this one is you’re doing, I swear.”
“Almost. Just give me this, please, let me do this for you,” Bucky gripped the saw tighter in his metal hand, breathing hard as he tried to ignore the pain in his body. “I’m almost done…”
“You have to get married anyway, you might as well do it before you turn thirty five and lose your crown,” Stane stepped closer to Tony, pulling his hand away from his left eye so he could look down into it. “Do you want to lose the throne? Don’t you want to be King?”
“What would you like me to do?” Steve asked, not wanting to push him, though he felt like he should reach down and rub Bucky’s back, give the kid some actual physical contact. He hadn’t touched Bucky much, however, and he didn’t know how the boy would react to it.
“They’re alive, they’re in hiding in Bucky’s old home, no one knows so I can keep them safe,” Tony whispered even though they were alone in the room, and the heavy doors were soundproof. “The attempt on their life was real, but Natasha knew the assassin and he agreed to help us get them out and hide them. The funeral is just a front for the wedding.”
“We have to go after him,” Tony said, about to get up when Steve reached out and took his arm. “You’re not suggesting we leave him alone, are you?”
“You have me,” Steve whispered, moving his hands along the backs of Bucky’s thighs, kissing his collarbone. “I promise you I’m not going anywhere. Except to…Tony?”
“I do,” Von Doom said with another forced smile, pleased to see that Stane was coming into the room with them. Hopefully they’d be able to coax Tony onto their side together with some choice words. “Are you a wine man? Mead?”
“I’m going to be here first thing in the morning,” Steve chuckled himself, though he didn’t sound quite as relaxed as Tony. He was so excited, he’d end up making himself a bit tense.
“…babies…” Bucky whispered, his hands squeezing Tony and Steve’s once he realized they were there. “What about the babies? Where is he?”
“So do you, and as much as I like Tony, I never stopped loving you,” Steve admitted, smiling a little at the shocked look on Bucky’s face. The other man hadn’t quite expected to hear him say that. “I would give this up if it made you happy, any day of the week. I would do anything for you. I was stupid and scared back then, but I’m hoping I’m a better man now. A man that can make things better between us.”
That morning when he’d ended his marriage with Peggy, he never imagined pledging himself to another person, not for a good long time. Though to do it right now felt like his only option, he wasn’t going to make Bucky suffer any more than he already had. If that meant sleeping on the couch in the other room to give Bucky some sense of peace, he was going to do it. He was going to do everything he could to make Bucky’s existence better, he didn’t care what he was going to have to give up to do just that.
“Presumed dead, missing, and we’re not working with him,” sighed Von Doom, getting frustrated again. They just seemed to be going in circles, and he was getting irritated again. “I can’t think of any top assassin that we can hire in time that we can trust.”
“They still make me want to be a better version of myself, they make me want to be a better King,” Tony continued, looking heavenwards for a moment as he sighed. “So I want to announce that, as of now, I am going to be that King. I am going to take over my kingdom, lower taxes, and give back to the people like I should have been doing for years. I will fail the Iron kingdom no more.”
“I’m coming,” Steve bent down and undid his shoes, setting them neatly aside as his grey hoodie joined Tony’s jacket on the chair. Climbing into bed on Bucky’s other side, he lay his head down on the pillows as he reached out to wrap an arm over Bucky and Tony, happy to have a moment where he could be close with them both.
“That doesn’t explain most of what I asked,” Steve walked over to sit next to Bucky, putting an arm around him. He had a feeling whatever happened, he wasn’t going to like it.
“I figure we can have the wedding in a month or so, lots of time before I turn thirty five,” Tony continued, popping another piece of fruit in his mouth. “It can’t possibly take that long to organize a wedding.”
“You’re on the right spot, stay there,” the doctor said as she looked at her own screen, freezing it to take some measurements.
“I’m not worried,” Bucky said as he smiled back, his hands on his stomach as the babies moved inside him. “I think they’re on my side right now, so I’ll say I’m pretty sure we’re having one of each.”
“He was going to kill me, he was going to kill them…” Bucky sniffed as tears rose in his eyes, trying to sit up and gasping in pain from his shoulder.
“You…you could call it that,” Tony admitted, impressed with Steve’s perception, and preparing his new defense next time someone told him peasants were stupid. “I have to be honest with you here, and I probably shouldn’t be but…I hate being King.
