“Charlie”, Dean gives her a warning look to shut her up.

“Oh”, Jody says, confused but only for a second. “Sorry. He’s your husband?”
“Sam can draw dogs”, he says, eyeing them both.
“Indication of a good night”, Dean reasons weakly.
Cas just stares at him awkwardly for a moment, “How— are you?”
Dean’s brain is doing its best to
“I sleep here”, he explains simply and points at the empty space on the left side of the bed. “You sleep there.”
“My washing machine finally came”, he blurts out, making Dean stop mid movement.
“Dean, wait! Where are you—"
“That’s perfect”, Sam says, delighted and ignoring his brother, “We need all four in the same place to cast the spell on them anyway.” He shows Cas some of the pages from a spell book they’ve stolen from a witch sometime along the road.
Cas is not sure if you can even call it a fight if it’s just him being a reasonable person and Dean managing to irritate him in every way possible.
Sam digs the keys from his pocket, handing them towards Dean, but yanking his hand back a bit as the older brother tries to take them.
Dean groans in annoyance, “I knew you’d say that.”
He should apologize.
he’s gonna whine about being woken up early?
So he talks.
Cas glances at Mick next to him and catches him already looking at him. They both chuckle a bit and turn their eyes away.
“Yeah, yeah”, Dean shrugs, like isn’t trapped by a powerful witch without any idea on how to escape. “Told you we should’ve brought the guns.”
“But she invited us both, I’d feel like an ass, going alone.”
“She’s Jo”, Cas passes on the message to Charlie. Jack leans closer again, whispering something for Cas to pass along. “Jo, from the park.”
Dean’s been planning the barbecue all week, googling recipes, writing a shopping list he’s stuck on the fridge door, adding stuff as he comes up with it.
He’s at work, on a rare coffee break that’s an actual break and not just having a cup of coffee while working. It’s a miracle considering he really ran late that morning and was prepared to work his ass off with no breaks at all.
Dean’s trying hard to remember her name, but he’s so tired he’s not sure if he even remembers his own.
He hands the mug to Sam, “If you want honey or sugar or milk or whatever, there’s stuff there”, he absentmindedly waves towards the shelves before slumping down at the kitchen table.
“Night”, Dean answers without properly looking at him, eyes on the TV where the end credits have rolled ages ago and it’s now suggesting more movies to watch.
The romantic movies that Dean doesn’t like to watch aren’t even being too dramatic about it. Breaking your heart actually fucking hurts. And the really painful part is the fact that this stupid, drunken mistake that got Dean’s heart broken, also broke their family as well.
is your point?”
Cas steps forward, past Dean, holding his hand out, “Yes, thank you for letting me join, Mr. Singer—"
“It’s Christmas”, he says, and because Cas doesn’t push him away, he doesn’t make the effort to move either, “The others are already making breakfast.”
There’s the things they just listed, but there’s so much more.
, he complains,
“I’m sorry, I got stuck in a meeting”, he grunts, “I can take over with the food and you can go.”
“Yes, well, I had no other plans and Dean insisted”, Cas explains, “I hope it’s okay.”
“What?” Dean grunts.
Dean wraps his arms around Cas, hooking his head on his shoulder, and right there, with Cas in his arms and their kid sleeping peacefully in his bed, he has everything and more.
He stands in front of the Paw Patrol ones and hopes Jack doesn’t see them, otherwise they’ll never get out of the fucking store. After carefully examining and giving commentary on
“I thought I’d save you the trouble”, he speaks to Dean’s back as the man sits on the bed, pulling his jeans on.
Cas ignores him.
Jack lifts the glitter covered card for him to see, “This is for Sam.”
Dean can hear Benny’s deep sigh on the other end of the line.
“Are you going to be fine?” Cas asks then, looking up at him, and the secret smile he gave his phone is gone. Jack’s slowly losing all his patience in the chair he’s trapped in, saying he wants
He laughs at Cas’s dead serious tone, “Okay, I know we have the house and the kid already, but can we date like, at least a week before we start to discuss marriage?”
Cas shouts his name, and Dean gets a glimpse of his worried expression before he blacks out.
“Any specific?”
“That bad, huh?” Cas muses, glancing at Dean’s tired posture. He closes the book and invites Dean to join him on the couch by extending his hand towards him.
Dean frowns. “What?”
Jack refuses to eat breakfast one morning. It isn’t completely uncharacteristic of him, but he’s not his normal ball of energy he usually is in the mornings either, the way he’s slumped in his chair, reminding more of Dean in the mornings than himself.
And he sounds like he’s genuinely waiting for an answer. “Yes”, Dean says with an eye roll, “and if all else fails, just take it off and show, you know”, he gestures at Cas, “whatever you got going on underneath all that.”
“The tea parties are always a serious business, we should know that by now.” Dean gets up to join him, “I say we get two flavors to really cover all the damage we’ve caused”, he suggests as he makes himself comfortable next to Cas, “Remind me to write it down.”
Eventually Dean comes to the kitchen with the win of a sleeping child, but the victory doesn’t exactly shine from him.
“Really?” he reacts, biting down a grin as he leans over to put the book on the table. They’ve been together for a while, but Cas still can’t help the grin growing to his lips every time Dean refers to him as his boyfriend. He thinks he’s never going to be able to stop being like this about it.
“been to lakes that much”, he blurts out, “Have you, Cas?” he asks, cheeks burning and voice going up an octave, somehow hoping that no one notices that, “Yes, we should go there today”, he continues before Cas even gets to give him an answer other than a confused look.
But Bobby had taken them in, fed them, helped them with homework and made them feel good and safe. Bobby helped them forget the tense situation at home for a moment, teaching Dean everything about cars as soon as he was old enough to be handed some tools.
Dean does the dishes, silently boiling inside and constantly swallowing it down. That stupid argument over
Dean spots the brunette chatting with Jo on the couch and nods.
That moves the kid on top of him enough to shake him from his sleep a bit. Dean feels him shifting before a tiny palm lands on his face with a slap. “Stop it”, the kid mumbles and shuts his eyes tighter.
“Clearly”, Cas laughs, and Dean allows himself to chuckle as well, the joy of the situation making him drop the ongoing war with Cas for a second.
(See the end of the chapter for
Except.
“I’m not picky”, Dean argues, “Your taste in media just sucks.”
Benny can’t believe what he’s hearing, eyebrows raising up.
Jack frowns, confused, “When is May?”
“What have you done?” Cas asks, but it’s with a chuckle and not with judgement.
“Black Widow?” Dean asks, nodding towards her outfit and she hums an affirmative.
The man on the armchair sighs, closing the book. He gives up, “Next Friday.”
“One”, Dean smiles, not bothering to pull his hand away, “He’s at my brother’s.”
Dean takes a deep breath, staring at one of the posters on the wall. Cas repeats himself. Dean takes another breath, nodding.
Now that Dean thinks of it, his bed is awfully creaky. These people think they’re dating, of course they would make that assumption. Great.
had to geek over food and use all the cutlery in the house”, Cas argues, and it gets a chuckle out of Dean.
“Since when are you so punctual?” she griped, struggling under the weight of all the gear because he wouldn’t let her make more than one trip.
Truth is Dean didn’t know what to do. Bobby was retiring, Samandriel was going to another shop, and Jo got another secretary gig somewhere else. Even if Dean wanted anything to do with his Dad, he was in jail. Free Will has been his identity since he left home.
“Amen, dude.” Charlie clinked her coffee cup to his in solidarity, and rose to flirt her way into a refill from Jo.
teacher?” Bobby and Samandriel laughed as Dean attempted to fix his hair.
“Yes, and they’ll never fool me, I know all the tricks. Remember the midnight strip poker game I organized a few years back?” Dean smiled to himself.
Cas looks to the others in confusion and worry, “Ok, ok,” he pulls back and places a soothing hand to the side of his face, wiping one of his stray tears away, his therapeutic nature finally kicking in. “I’m not going anywhere, I promise. Lets get you back to bed, alright?” Dean looks relieved but cautious, as if Cas might disappear any moment. Sam helps to get Dean back into bed, while Dean insists that Cas stay as close to him as possible. During the chaos, Bobby leaves to fill the nurse in on Dean’s latest drug-induced confusion. She comes in to check his vitals, and informs them that his level of delusion is sometimes common in patients undergoing this combination of medications, and she plans to switch around a few things and give him a small sedative to calm him down.
“These things are always the worst, I’m Dean by the way,” he offered, extending his hand.
Cas groaned noncommittally in response, turning to face Dean, wrapping his arms around him, and burying his face into Dean’s chest, breathing in his familiar, comforting scent.
“She would’ve treated me a hell of a lot better than you,” Dean’s voice cracked, and he shoved John back for the first time in his life, years of anger overtaking him.
Dean’s eyes flickered away from Cas’ for a moment, “Actually I was hoping to talk to you for a sec, Cas.”
the other artists. Dean saved up enough money to get a ratty little apartment closer to the
“Oh, so I suppose all the main characters are supposed to marry each other, god forbid we don’t mix it up a little, and don’t get me started on how Neville was treated,” she shot back.
“But it would make me very happy,” he charmed, batting his long eyelashes, despite looking all ruffled and sick.
Twenty stitches later, and one filed police report, that had been the last time Dean had ever seen his father.
Cas let out a sigh of relief as his whole body visibly relaxed, “Great! Is tonight at 7 ok?”
“Ugh.”
Dean nodded, probably a little over enthusiastically, and leaned down pressing their bodies flush against each other, chest to chest, erections trapped between them. Dean let out an appreciative moan as Cas slipped his tongue into Deans mouth, escalating the kiss quickly. Dean was utterly lost in sensations. From Cas pulling his shirt off so they were nothing but skin on skin, to Cas’ tongue caressing Dean’s neck and hands running down his sides, as Cas rolled on top. They were both completely lost in each other. Dean barely even registered the sound of his own voice chanting Cas’ name over and over while their hips ground together, desperate for more friction.
and bars were. They were further out so they catered mostly to locals. They didn't get the
“De-eeannn,” Cas sing-songed, attempting to rouse Dean out of his slumber while also tying his own blue tie on straight. Dean was still out cold, splayed out on his stomach, limbs spread out. “Time to wake up, gorgeous.”
Cas had just sat down for the first time to begin reviewing the notes for his midterm when someone approached the counter. Cas begrudgingly put down his color-coded study guide and looked up reciting, “Can I help you?” When he saw him.
"So did I, I've never been more grateful for a visit to the hospital," Cas laughed.
“Why is it so loud and bright in here?” Dean complained, pressing his face into Cas’ neck.
Dean laughed a little in response, “He’s just dehydrated, I didn’t save him from a burning building or anything.”
“Not bad Winchester, can I get you something?”
It was a Thursday night around 6 and Cas was working until closing. Most Thursday nights were pretty quiet, many students opted for celebrating ‘Thirsty Thursday’ instead of hanging out in the annex libraries pocketed all around campus, but tonight was different because it was midterm week, which meant everyone was losing their shit. The library was packed, and Cas had to work by himself until 10 when another student would come in to help him close the last hour. So he had to man the phones, run the circulation desk, shelve the books being returned, and study for his humanities exam the next day. Needless to say when his least favorite obnoxious gang came strolling in, he was not happy about it. They waltzed in with their mostly empty backpacks and their devil-may-care attitudes, because as long as they passed it didn’t matter what their grades were because their corporate parents would be the ones hiring them anyway.
Dean smiles for the first time since coming into the room, “Are you gonna stay?”
“I’m sure she completely forgot about us, Dean, she’s thirteen remember? We’re embarrassing now.”
That’s part of the reason Dean loved teaching Samandriel so much; art is so important to him, that helping Samandriel find that within himself was incredibly rewarding. Dean wasn’t just proud of his own accomplishments, he was proud of Samandriel’s. Dean got to be like Bobby, and help someone else realize their potential and the positive impact that their art could have on others. Dean was leaving his mark on people, like his Dad, but Dean wasn’t leaving scars, he was leaving masterpieces.
Dean’s eyes widened and his heart leapt. All this time he was working up the courage to ask Cas out, and he beat him to it. “Yes!” he blurted out, “I’d like that.”
“Good luck with that,” Cas mumbled as they stalked off.
“Did you take the aspirin I laid out for you last night?” Cas inquired patiently.
“No, we have to find him,” Dean begins to untangle himself from the sheets and stands unsteadily.
“You were engaged to a girl named Lisa for a bit but broke up a few months ago,” Sam answers awkwardly.
“Um,” Cas looks to the others for guidance but receives nothing, “Well, no, we actually work together at another hospital, we’re friends.”
flair.
puppy version of himself. So Dean had taken it upon himself the past few months to look
“Because some rules are meant to be broken,” Dean smiled, proving his point. “That’s why you didn’t get Sam in trouble when you caught him kissing Jess at the picnic benches last week.”
Cas rose from his chair to check it back in and Dean nodded to him, “Night Cas, good luck on your Epic War test tomorrow.”
Dean pouted his lips and made a face, as if he was taking this into serious consideration. “I guess I could go along with that,” he conceded, repositioning himself to be the little spoon, with Cas’ arms around him, letting out a long, contented breath.
“Of course not, Dean. I just love this piece so much, it captures everything; Angelic mythology, healing, trust, star-crossed love, sexual tension.”
"What?!" Dean exclaimed.
One week after the shop closed, Dean packed up everything from his apartment into his car, and hit the road. Next to him in the front seat was a folder with directions to his new apartment, the number of an artist who used to work with Bobby who now runs his own shop, registration forms for classes at the California College of the Arts, and an old picture of him and Castiel. Dean was determined, he was ready to move on, and grow. He wanted to teach. He wanted to travel. He wanted Castiel.
Dean’s just being a good friend and Cas could’ve said no if he wanted to. It’s just that Cas was going to spend the holidays alone in his apartment and you should spend Christmas with family, or at least some people and there’s people at Bobby’s and it’s chill, and Dean had been so scared Cas would think it’s weird, him inviting him there, but Cas had just said yes. They came up with the schedule for the trip, and that was it.
“I’m sure it’s fine—"
“They’re already growing, it's incredible”, Cas informs him, his nose almost on the ground as he examines the flowers carefully. “You can go already, if you don’t have time for the small, beautiful things in life.”
Cas’s eyes get so soft at that as he stares at Dean, and he hopes the man would just grab the stupid juice and they could be done with this.
“I’d like that,” Castiel smiled a little.
“Come out, come out Cassie, there’s nowhere to hide!” A voice Dean recognized as a kid named Bart shouted.
“Sorry kid, I don’t ink up minors,” he brushed off as he slid the sketch back to him.
“I was resting my eyes,” Dean argued, finally getting to his post, and organizing his stuff, glancing up every few seconds, until he finally saw him, in the distance. Dean smiled to himself as he watched the guy run, so graceful he made it look easy. He was wearing black running shorts and no shirt, because of the already sweltering temperature. Dean heard a sound to his right but he couldn’t care less when the highlight of his day was running toward him with Greek god level hotness. It wasn’t until he felt a sharp pain in his ear that he was broken from his stupor.
When Dean held Cas close and reminded him to breathe, Cas shook as sobs wracked his body, panic and adrenaline leaving him slowly. Dean’s arms were strong and sure, giving Cas a little piece of security, as he processed the panic on his own.
“If you think a Band-Aid is enough to fix up that shoulder, then I’m gonna tell em’ you need a head scan too,” Bobby chided.
"Dude you've drawn enough roses to fill a florist, you've perfected it man," Dean smiled,
Cas made his way to Dean’s bed, entranced as always by the bright green hue of his eyes. Once Cas was comfortably snuggled up to Dean’s side, he let Dean run his fingertips along Cas’ jaw gently. Eyes glued to Cas’ lips, Dean turned his head slightly, leaning in to taste. Cas relaxed into the feel of Dean’s soft kiss, reaching for his waist to pull him closer.
Sam lets out an audible laugh, and Bobby tries to disguise his smirk but fails.
“Yeah right, I sit on top of this stupid wooden thrown all day, Baywatch my ass,” Dean retorted, gesturing to his lax position.
"Maybe don't make it a habit," Dean laughed.
“Is there something I can help you with?” Cas inquired through clenched teeth.
Cas blushed and was filled with guilt for not doing his job, he was halfway through an apology when Dean stood up to full height and eyed the group with a menacing gaze.

Dean stumbled through the doors of the shop just as Bobby was closing up for the day, holding a blood-soaked towel to his shoulder where John had cut him with the bottle, and sporting a black eye to match his split lip. Bobby’s startled expression said it all, and without a word he steered him to his car and set off for the emergency room.
Needless to say, they spent the rest of the summer getting ice cream downtown, going for long drives, staying up late for movie marathons and kissing under the stars. Now it wasn’t just the mornings that were Dean’s favorite, it was every second he got to spend with Cas.
strip when he turned 18. Then Bobby trained him as an artist. Bobby’s been more of a father to
The earsplitting sound of John’s Jack Daniels bottle breaking over the counter echoed in the small room.
As they started cleaning up around the shop, Bobby pulled Dean aside and put a hand on his shoulder. “So this is it, last day,” he smiled sadly.
After getting Dean what he needed, and finishing his shift for the night, he immediately met Charlie at their favorite coffee shop on campus and recounted the entire tale to her.
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean’s bluntness, “Dean, Ellen’s bound to check in on us one more time, and if she knew we were dating she’d never let us share the same cabin.”
When he opened his eyes, Cas was greeted with the image of Dean, the love of his life, perched on his lap, green eyes shining with lust and mischief.
“You turned 28 a few months ago,”
“That’s very noble of you Dean, how old is your brother?”
“That’s true, but they freaked because they walked in on us making out,” Cas conceded.
“Sammy’s 14, he’s a genius,” Dean perked up considerably, practically glowing with pride.
“Yeah,” Dean mumbled back.
*		*		*		*		*		*
“I’m almost done with breakfast, there’s pancakes and bacon and eggs, all great hangover foods,” Cas soothed him.
“I know what you mean, they make it seem like people will be knocking down your door with offers when really, you’re lucky to receive a rejection email these days,” Dean sighs, glancing around the room. “I mean, look at all this, everyone with their stiff business clothes, fake smiles, and too tight handshakes it’s all so staged and rehearsed.” Dean pointed toward one of the more upscale booths, a huge set up with a flat-screen television playing an advertisement for Roman enterprises, five sinister looking representatives appeared to be looking down at everyone who passed, only approaching those that were dripping with an air of sleazy corruption. Dick Roman, CEO of Roman enterprises preached from the screen about success and cutthroat business tactics. Dean whispered, “See that? There’s no way they’re not up to something shady if you ask me.”
“You know Cas, sometimes if you sit for too long you can compress your sciatic nerve, I can go lower if you want,” Dean’s low voice was dripping with sensuality.
“Of course I can bud,” Dean reached his arm out to pull Lucas into a hug. “I know camp can feel like a really long time to be away from home sometimes. How about I help you send your letter, and then you and me play some army men with Jo?”
“Trust me,” Castiel teased, “if I knew I wouldn’t be standing here with 70 grand in student loans.”
“Did you buy plane tickets I’m not aware of?” Dean teased.
Castiel adores books. He loves the weight of them, the sound of the spine cracking just like his does first thing in the morning, the smell of freshly printed pages and binding glue. He loves the knowledge and adventure they provide, the sense of wonder they give him, and their ability to completely take him away to far off places, so lost in the story that he can’t even sense the real world around him. That’s why he is in college, studying to be a librarian. Cas wants to nurture the incredible power that books hold and share that knowledge and power with other people that care as much as he does. Dean Winchester was not one of those people.
Cas beamed, “Thank you, Dean.”
something different, a stark contrast from the fear and anger of his dark, endless life. Dean
“He is pretty awesome,” Dean smiled to himself. “Alright boys, this is your last check for the night, so lights out,” he stated authoritatively, unconsciously straightening his green Camp Harvelle polo.
childbirth, and his little-brother-to-be Sammy was stillborn, and that he wished every day that
Dean rolled his eyes dramatically at her horrendous pun, shaking his head, “I don’t even know the dude’s name Jo, besides he’s probably not even into guys.”
“We need to book one of the study rooms in the back and we each need a copy of the four books on reserve for Fluid Dynamics,” Alastair demanded.
“Alright, when was the last time you ate or drank?”
“Much better, thanks to you,” he smiled, making Dean’s heart race as green eyes met blue. “And I will no longer be letting my brother convince me to party to such extremes.”
Dean paused and cleared his throat, “Are you -uh- sexually active?” he tried to ask casually.
“I’m a screwed up artist with no future, Cas.” Dean spoke in a low voice. “I love you, but I’m not going to do that to you.”
“Well, he called me a mousey book boy, but he called Dean a poor orphan,” Cas recounted, uncomfortable.
“I’ll get there,” he smiled as he sat up, and straightened Cas tie for him fondly. “I’m just enjoying the view first.”
Cas rolled his eyes but had trouble suppressing his smile, “Dean, we’re here to pick up our daughter, keep it PG.”
“Mostly horror stories and thrillers actually,” Cas smiled at Dean’s surprise. “I almost got kicked out of Bible camp last year when they caught me reading the Shining.”
Lucas was hanging out on the sand drawing, while his mom was reading. He didn’t really like the beach, but his mom insisted they go outside on such a beautiful day. Lucas was finishing a really good picture of his bike when a strong breeze took some of his papers into the water. He ran after them, desperate to reclaim his art, but the next thing he knew, he had waded out too far in the water, and got caught in a strong current. Lucas was not a very good swimmer, and he had never been so scared in his life. It was like he had no control over his body, he was being dragged further and further into the cold depths of the sea and he could barely keep his head above water. Luckily Dean had his eye on Lucas, and saw the kid flailing not too far out. Shock ran through him. Sure he was trained and certified, but he never actually had to save anyone before. He called in on his radio, his voice a much higher octave than normal, and he grabbed his gear. Jumping off his perch, he started to blow his whistle, sprinting toward the waterline; he had caught a lot of people’s attention, including Andrea, Lucas’ mom, who only then realized that her son was gone. Filled with panic, she ran to the edge of the water, shouting his name, as Dean paddled through the waves to reach him. People began to gather closer to the water, watching the scene, as some of the other lifeguards and personnel were responding to Dean’s radio call. When Dean finally reached Lucas, the kid looked petrified, still thrashing in the water.
“Dean, Dean Winchester,” he smiled glad to see that Cas was doing ok, and that they had finally met, despite the stressful circumstances.
To their relief, Dean falls back to sleep not long after, Cas still by his side.
"Yeah, I just wanna make sure I'm ready before I step into their showy commercial shop,"
“S’ too early, Dean,” Cas groused.
“Don’t worry, Angel,” Dean reassured him, “I’ve got you.”
They were all the same age, but Dean had proved to be one of the more athletic kids at camp, he was generally respected and stood several inches taller than the other thirteen-year-old boys before him. “Uh,” Raphael stammered, clearly not expecting Dean, “We were looking for a little dorky kid named Castiel, thought he ran in here.”
Every single muscle in Castiel’s body was completely relaxed. He breathed in steadily and slowly, air seeping into and out of his lungs seamlessly. The mattress beneath him was memory foam, and it definitely remembered him, fitting all the contours of his long, lean body perfectly. The window of the bedroom was open and a cool summer breeze made its way in, balancing out the warmth of the blankets to create the perfect temperature.
He would open his eyes and find himself drenched in sweat. His body was tense and sore, his head pounding and throat closing. His pulse stampeding through his body, and every worry he could possibly imagine flooding into his brain, or there were no worries at all, just pure fear and adrenaline being pumped into his every vein for no conceivable reason.
Cas retrieved the textbook for Dean quickly, scanning it out and handing it to him. “I’m sure that you’ll do great on it, Dean.”
Although Dean had never loved anyone so passionately before, he had also never been so terrified of the profound feelings he had.
“Really?” Dean looks to Bobby, his eyes wildly exasperated.
“Unfortunately yes, you said you wanted to keep living together until I finished Law School,” Sam smirks.
Claire smiled and jogged up to them, letting her cool thirteen-year-old façade slip away to run into their arms and let her dads hug her. “I missed you guys!”
“Wait!” Dean called from where he was ruffling his little brother’s hair nearby. He jogged over to Cas and sheepishly handed him a handmade bracelet. “Jo helped me make it, this way you won’t forget to write,” he stated, a little flushed, addressing his shoes.
“What wrong? Who needs help?” Dean called.
“How? He never slows down! What am I supposed to do, run along with him and tell him I’ve been watching him for weeks, please date me?” Dean sighed.
When their lips met, it was unlike any kiss Dean has ever had before. His whole body felt the warmth and excitement of the moment, and as he reached for Cas' hips, they practically melted together. After several minutes, and one or two soft moans, they reluctantly pulled apart.
“Because of all the great memories?” Dean guessed, glancing over at Cas on the passenger side.
“Castiel Novak,” the gorgeous mystery man answered.
“So you help people with independence and adapting life skills and stuff?” Dean inquires.
“Uh…” Dean starts, screwing up his face in concentration. “I guess taking a really hard test in grad school.” The three of them exchange cautious glances.
“And why’s a kid from Henderson with a problem with stairs so desperate to get a tattoo?
Dean worked to keep his face professional, while inwardly jumping for joy. “Alright man, it sounds like you’re just really dehydrated, I called for backup so we’ll probably get you into an ambulance and they’ll send you to the hospital for an IV with some fluids, ok?”
“Oh come ON Cas! You two are so in love it hurts my face.”
who sat at the front desk. Dean gave Bobby an award-winning smile, handed him a sketch and
They were close friends, closer than most other friends. But they had a rocky start, Cas was new to Boston, and it had been his first job after getting his Master’s degree. He was nervous and new and wanted to be taken seriously despite being young and marginally inexperienced. Dean had already worked there for a year, and was considered one of the best new physical therapists, despite only getting his doctorate a month before being hired. He flirted with Cas mercilessly, and Cas hated it. Cas was uptight and guarded, wanting to maintain his professionalism and adjust to life in a new city. Dean wasn’t outrageously outgoing, but he was very comfortable with who he was and his bisexuality, and he was very interested in Cas. After a few weeks of this, Dean pulled back, understanding that his behavior was getting him nowhere with Cas. Finally he was acting like just another co-worker, and Cas was beginning to relax into his new position. Then a patient had a grand mal seizure, a side effect of one of his medications during a therapy session with Cas. He handled it with detached precision and practice; Dean had been the only other person in the room, and he completely froze. After that ordeal they bonded, Dean filled with awe and respect for Cas, and Cas realizing that Dean could be just as vulnerable and terrified as Cas felt when he first started working there. They became work friends, which escalated to outside of work friends when they found out about their joint love of the terrible melodrama Dr. Sexy. Now they were incredibly close, both secretly wishing for more.
When Cas’ parents came to pick him up, they were as stiff and proper as Cas had described them. “Hello mother, father,” Cas greeted formally.
“I don’t want to make you guys give up your extra bed-“ Cas nervously started.
Cas glanced at the blinking cursor on the screen, mocking him for being several pages short of what he needed.
Dean immediately felt right at home in the small shop. It wasn’t overwhelming like the
“Henderson, ‘bout thirty minutes out,” Dean answered.
Benny and Garth got along with Cas just as fast as Dean, and quickly through the dinner, they found themselves offering him the extra bunk in their cabin.
wanted to give it to other people.
Cas shuffled the pages to a dog-eared page and presented it to Dean, “This one’s my favorite.”
Cas removed his shirt and laid face down on the bed as Dean broke out the coconut oil he used just for their special massage sessions (not for lotion sometimes because it makes his skin soft and it smelled like Cas- that would be embarrassing).
“Hhmm,” Cas considered. “Ok, but five more minutes of cuddling, then coffee and beach,” he offered back, opening one brilliant blue eye to meet Dean’s green ones.
"Dean, can I get an opinion on this design I did here?” Samandriel was an apprentice, he
Castiel is a sophomore at KU and works part time at the Engineering library. Partially because he wants the experience working alongside real librarians and other students and partially because he likes the extra money. When he applied, he had just wanted to work in the main library, to get a sense of how a massive university academic library system worked, but the only position available was in the annex Engineering library.
“Fell down the stairs,” Dean answered without skipping a beat.
“It should be a great trip, we’re going to go over all of the indigenous plants in the area and talk about different animal tracks,” Cas explained excitedly, seemingly pleased that some of the kids were interested. “Are you sure everyone’s in bed? Even Krissy? You know she always tries to sneak out and smoke with the ‘cool kids’,” Cas asked Dean as he dropped onto his bed.
As Dean walked to the front, it reminded him of when he walked in there for the first time.
They were mostly just a bunch of misfit, lost kids who found themselves in art, and
Dean hovered above him.
Slowly Dean’s warmth surrounded him with tight, perfect pressure, and he couldn’t help but call out his name in shear ecstasy. Quickly they found a rhythm, rocking into each other over and over, Cas grinding into Dean’s prostate with each slide. The pleasure was slowly building inside them both, rising and rising until Dean could feel it, so so close.
“Definitely.”
Dean shrugs, “I don’t know, what do you wanna do?”
“Stop”, Cas complains, “Just, stay still.”
They’ve gotten sloppier at their use of the white board, and it’s causing issues with scheduling again. There’s some overlap with the work shifts, and they’re able to get rid of most of them, but there’s one afternoon where they’re both unavailable for an hour.
“It was Goldilocks”, Jack blurts out from behind his hand, pointing at Dean, who shoots the kid a look.
Cas looks at him with an honest expression, like he really means what he said, and no one’s ever said anything like that to Dean, and he’s so taken aback by it he freezes for a second, just staring at the man.
Dean takes a peek into the cup, all the different colored boozes together making a very disgusting mix. “This is your go-to drink, Cas?” he asks doubtfully.
In his life, crap has always been more or less falling apart, so it still catches him off guard when Cas is there, taking care of him. Because Dean's always been the one taking care of people. And he still is, there’s nothing he wouldn’t do for Jack or Cas, or anyone else he cares about for that matter. But having someone to share some of the responsibility, and all of the joy, feels pretty great.
“Take the plates outside, I’ll handle the meat”, Dean nods towards the pile of plates he’s put on the isle.
“Like I don’t
They fall down to the ground but the grass beneath them is soft, so the landing is not painful. Dean lands half on top of Novak and he’s
“Not when I’m in charge”, Dean says, giddy simply seeing Cas walking and talking. He slams the door shut as Cas glares at him from the car.
But this look, right now, is something else.
Dean’s not a fan of how embarrassing and scary it seems to be in love, and he’s really realizing it now, but Cas grounds him with just a look. “Dean”, he starts and takes a moment to consider how to say next. Not what, but how.
Bobby ignores his attempt to be funny.
The man chuckles, putting the cigarette off against the grass, before pulling a small glass jar he’s hidden underneath the terrace, showing that this is not the first time he’s smoking there, “And throw away a perfect opportunity for a promotion everyone would be jealous to get?”
Sounds stupid, and he knows it, but deep down, it’s a genuine fear.
Cas licks his lips, his eyes heavy with something as he stares at Dean and waits for his answer. Dean’s suddenly very aware of how close they are, the distance between them has gotten way much shorter since they first laid down on the bed. He’s aware of all the parts of his body that are touching Cas, from their toes, to thighs, to the hand still on Cas’s back.
“Good”, Novak simply says, “Me too. You’re a good kisser.”
“You know damn well we’re not his dads.”
He only drank one beer, so he should be better at controlling his gaze that’s scanning down on Cas.
“Are you feeling sick?” Cas worries, bringing a hand to Jack’s forehead. He’s been healthy for two days, but they’re still being very careful just in case he hasn’t shaken it all. His temperature feels normal, and Cas’s breathing gets a little easier.
“Dean hasn’t said
Dean takes the key he offers, running a thumb over the rough surface of the glitter, “What are we doing, man?”
Dean guides them to the currently empty kitchen to check out Charlie’s table of drinks. Her alcohol purchases are always based on two things: it has to be colorful, and it has to have as much alcohol in it as possible. To Dean, they always taste like ass dipped in sugar.
And feeling Cas wanting it just as badly as he does makes Dean pretty damn happy.
The day before the party goes mostly around cleaning the house and preparing things in the kitchen. Dean had ordered the cake from a bakery, but he’s planning on baking and cooking everything else by himself.
The first thing Cas has his attention on is Dean’s flannel that’s hanging from a nail on the castle wall. He follows his gaze down, and finds Dean on his back, under the construction, nailing something there by the sounds of it.
“You can join us at the table if you want.” He looks up and meets eyes with a blonde woman.
Eventually, Cas blinks. “Why didn’t you say anything to me?”
“You’re an asshole.”
Jack eats a forkful here and there, but he’s not even halfway done when Dean arrives at the kitchen.
“Okay”, he gives in with a sigh, and looks up at Cas, eyes hard, “
“Sorry we’re late”, Dean says when Jack sits down. “We had a little math book hunt, but we’ll make it in time to your piano class, don’t worry.” He’s grateful for Cas writing a tiny “piano!” on his calendar with a red marker, right underneath the date, or he would’ve never remembered it, not on a messy day like this.
Dean flicks his eyes at him, looking like he’s considering it for a moment, but eventually his eyes grow harder and he turns his attention back to the bowl in front of him.
Meg cracks up around the mouthful of wine.
When Cas doesn’t comment, Dean looks up from his stuff. “Cas?”
“I think I’ve always been the wiser one”, his little brother wonders, looking thoughtful.
God, his eyes are blue up close. They flick down for just a second when Dean subconsciously licks his lips, but then they’re up again, piercing into him. Dean’s eyes travel down to Cas’s lips, slightly parted as he breathes through his mouth.
Because it’s huge, right? It feels pretty huge. So, you can’t just drop something like that to a kid. They can’t fuck it up, so there’s no half assing this. When it comes to Jack, neither of them wants to take any risks, it needs to be done right.
“Yeah, I sent you a message we’re running late. You didn’t need to stay up.”
is? Jack keeps bringing it up, but he won’t explain what he means.”
There’s a chat open on the screen, but Dean can’t read any of it because the phone is on the other end of the counter. Not that he was trying to read any of it anyway.
“Like you were up for
There’s some outdoor toys at the garage as well, useless in the backyard since there’s no sandbox to play in, so he grabs them with them too.
“You know why, man”, Dean tries to dodge the question, but Cas’s determined face doesn’t give up, not even in the dark where Dean can’t properly see it, “You were gonna spend Christmas alone in your apartment, and I would’ve felt like an asshole being here with everyone while you’d be alone”, he mutters, playing with a loose thread on the corner of his blanket, “And Sam was gonna bring Eileen, so it’s not like he would’ve kept me company all this time, so.”
“She’s one of Dean’s friends, I thought you’d know her”, Cas says, frowning. The mystery is solved, when Jack leans in, cupping a hand on Cas’s ear to whisper something.
“Come
Silence falls around them in the sunny living room, all that light feeling like an insult to this all. Dean avoids looking at Cas, and he probably avoids Dean as well.
He walks around the house even though his hangover begs him to lie down, but he can’t stay still. It gives him too much time to think about this morning, and he’s too tired and hurt to do it.
“Now you have two.”
Dean laughs at how done Sam is already, and they’re just starting. “Come on, it’s funny.”
the one at a bar on a Friday night, whining about the struggles of parenting while Cas is actually at home with the kid.
“I’ve told you I should be the one who cooks”, Dean says, aiming for a joke, but Cas just still looks guilty.
“I think he calls us both dads”, Cas says, frowning, “If he’s being specific, he uses our names.”
“Yeah, I get it”, his friend says, and sounds sincere.
He tries not to get sad drunk, but it does feel bittersweet to know Cas likes his family, because these people are the most important people in Dean’s life and Cas liking them and vice versa is important to him, but at the same time it stings that Cas is not a part of it the way Dean wants more than anything.
Jody calms him down, and asks him to go and check the medicine cabinet. Dean holds the phone against his ear as he grabs a pen and writes down whatever Jody instructs him to get from the pharmacy.
Dean frowns, “And?”
And he’s not even surprised that Dean’s trying his best to deliver the order forward, no matter how much it seems to pain him to do so as he tries to explain the color scheme and the patterns and shapes Jack wanted.
At first, they were always at home, days spent trying to survive from one small crisis to another, all the way to the point when Jack finally went to sleep. After that, the two of them spent the first few hours avoiding each other, before going to sleep as well, and then waking up if, and when Jack woke up in the middle of the night.
“I wasn’t given much of a choice, really”, Cas defends himself like Dean’s ruined his life or something.
They manage to get the rest of the decorations in a way that more or less pleases all of them. Jo calling Cas family rings inside Dean’s head all the way to dinnertime, and he wishes so badly it would be true, that while Cas is his best friend and his family, he would be part of this family too, in a way they allowed everyone here to believe.
He’s about to go to the living room to see if there’s anything good on the TV when he sees movement in the kitchen.
“Rufus brought it here yesterday for scraps, thing’s a piece of crap”, Bobby explains to Dean, before looking at Jack, “Ever been in one of those?”
Dean and Cas share a look.
“Is Dean home?”
Cas groans, “Just give me an hour to finish my stuff and continue then.”
And if he doesn’t ask, he can get whatever Cas is willing to give him.
Before his head drops against his chest, Dean sees Cas, snapping out of the magic hold and rushing towards Rowena. They fall to the floor in front of Dean, and he thinks he sees Cas grab the ring hanging from the necklace, ripping it off her neck. The magic bound around Dean breaks, and he falls to his side.
becomes too real, and Cas cuts in before it fully even begins, desperate to just be done with it.
Dean sends Jack to take his toys back to his room before dinner, before Cas can say his goodbyes.
Dean never thought he would think that lazy Sunday mornings could be the highlight of his week, but on some weeks they really are.
Instead, he gives him a sad smile. “Me too.”
He gets up and tries to put Jack down on the bed, but the kid won’t untangle his hands from around his neck. “But I want you here too”, he whines, hanging from Dean’s neck. Dean looks up at Cas for support, but the man just stares back.
Cas guides them towards the bed where they manage to land without tripping over on the way there. Dean, lying on his back, awkwardly wiggles himself out of the shirt Cas has kindly already opened for him, before working on the buttons of Cas’s shirt that he’s still fully wearing.
Jack goes to sleep so early most of their guests are still there when Cas grabs the boy and goes inside to put him to bed. Their get together is so chill, that Jack can easily sleep in his bedroom, and when he’s asleep Cas just turns on the baby monitor and puts it next to his bed, taking the other end with him outside, so he’s able to hear if Jack wakes up, which he has rarely done lately.
aah, i was struggling with writing cas with someone else than dean, i hope it turned out okay! :D as always, love to hear what you guys think, if you want to share your thoughts, leave a comment or slide into my ask box on
“No.”
Jack doesn’t want to sleep alone in his room, so Cas takes the kid with him to sleep in his bed, because it’s bigger than the one in the guest room.
He needs to get his eyes on Cas.
He takes a deep breath, huffs it out.
Dean heads straight to the bathroom when they arrive upstairs. When he returns to the bedroom, Cas is already dressed in warmer clothes, sitting on the edge of the bed with a thoughtful look on his face. Without saying anything, Dean goes to his backpack to search for clothes as well.
The Department of Child Services is grey, and it’s the least aesthetically pleasing office area Dean’s ever been in. He’s waiting by a door that someone at the front desk advised him to wait by.
wrote it”, he emphasizes quickly, when Sam gets an amused look on his face, “He almost wrote 911 down for you as well, but I stopped him in time.”
“Jack’s had some trouble sleeping, so we’ve all slept quite badly”, Cas admits, his voice rougher than usually. Dean shoots him a look, but the shrink raises a calming hand.
“I can do it”, Dean assures and his brother’s frown deepens.
“Yeah, sure, we’ll go to the store later today”, Dean manages to answer.
“Didn’t think I’d run into you here, angel”, she smirks, “How’s the kid?”
Not that he’s ever actively been thinking about it.
“Who’s in a better mood?” Dean asks as he appears to the kitchen right that second, surprisingly soon, a towel hanging low on his hips.
is on the tip of his tongue, but Cas manages to swallow it down. He grabs a few different kinds and hopes that one of them is the right one.
For a second Dean’s sure she’s going for Cas, already pointing at him with the knife, and he's ready to shout something offensive to get her to stab him instead.
Cas chuckles, looking around the tiny space, “I don’t think I’ll fit in there.”
Dean’s attractive by many standards, and he aesthetically fits Cas’s idea of an attractive man. He’s always known it, but it’s never been an issue. He’s glared at Dean enough times over the years that he’s been aware of the fact that the man has freckles on his face, but Cas hasn’t given them a second thought before. Until one morning he finds himself wondering just how far down his body the freckles go.
“He’s in his room.”
Dean tries to hide his sour mood from his brother when he goes back home, usually being so happy and smiling after coming home from doing laundry.
“Is there any coffee left?” Cas asks as he puts Jack down.
Dean turns his whole body towards the man next to him, offended. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Cas scrunches his nose as he walks past Dean and looks at him from head to toe, clearly judging the yesterday look.
“You can stay if you want”, Sam offers, but Cas shakes his head.
“You could’ve told me you two are dating, dude, I found that out from
kissing him, like he’s set his mind to do it.
“Yeah”, Dean agrees with a nod. And he does, but as he looks down at his hands, somehow Cas’s choice of words doesn’t feel like enough, “Yeah, me too.”
“Okay, chill, I was just checking.”
anyway, this chapter is me enjoying idiots in love as a trope to write a bit too much, probably. it's mostly just soft chaos, because i love soft chaos <3
Dean nods towards the popcorn bowl on the couch next to Charlie, and she hands it over. He grabs a handful of them and puts the bowl on the coffee table, eating the popcorn one by one as the silence stretches. Charlie is staring at him, but he keeps his focus on his snack, because it’s so obvious she’s trying to read him, and he hates it.
Cas looks taken aback, and as Dean desperately tries to find a way to correct what he just said, Cas’s eyes harden, and he suddenly backs Dean against the railing.
“It’s windy at the lake”, he says to Cas as he rummages through his stuff, “Make sure you’re wearing layers.”
Dean wakes up to the sunlight hitting his face from a weird angle.
in love with him and doesn’t want it to be anything more than whatever this right now is.
And it’s not like it was Dean’s first hook up, so Cas really thought he would handle it better, and even if he seems to regret it that much, it’s not like he can put all the blame on Cas, they were both having the sex that caused all this.
“It was a promising start”, Cas leans towards the floor, and takes two beers from the six pack and hands one to Dean.
“No! Dean gave it to me.” Jack pouts and hides his hands behind his back, shooting one of his angriest looks at Cas, looking like the man had suggested they should burn the damn thing once and for all.
Cas blinks at the sudden question, looking slightly horrified at the fact that he’s possibly let some of this show outside, before he can gather himself enough to clear his throat. “What?”
“Mornin’ sunshine”, he grins at Cas, “We didn’t wake you up, did we?” he asks, glancing down at Jack playing with some toy animals he’s arranging to a line on the kitchen floor.
“Thanks for the tip”, he states, annoyed at the playful grin Meg has on her face, “but I’ll pass on the third wheeling with you guys.”
and the next chapter is the last one!!!
Cas arrives at Jack’s bedroom door, “Okay, my turn”, he states before stepping inside, “Go get ready.”
“I have it”, Cas simply tells them, “I got my hands on it earlier this week.”
“Fuck!”
“Yeah, I know that”, he agrees quietly. It’s not Cas’s fault they’re in this mess, but he’s the one who’s unlucky enough to be there when this shit boils over inside of him.
“Bye then, Jack!” Cas calls, and there’s an excited ‘
Jack admires his drawing like it would be a real piece of art, letting out a loud “Wow!” as he points at each stick figure with his glittery finger, naming them. “It’s very awesome.”
He picks up the cup and throws it back to the sink, leaning against the counter with his hands to let out a breath as he shakes his injured foot a bit.
The last hours of Dean’s shift are much less eventful, which gives Dean too much time to sit around and think about what happened back at their apartment.
Jack has slept in Cas’s room the past two nights, so that’s where Dean heads to drop him off. He pushes the door open with his shoulder and pulls the covers away to make room for Jack to be tucked in.
Sometimes, Cas is still overwhelmed by the warm wave of affection that hits him when he gets to witness situations like this, when Dean turns around to find them crossing the yard and instantly crouches down, arms wide open for Jack to run into.
Dean steps into the small bathroom. “Remember what happened before, when we had to wash it? It got all wet and icky.” Jack doesn’t answer.
When he opens the fridge, he finds something even better: two containers that weren’t there earlier, with a post-it note stuck on the top of one of them.
And if he would be completely honest with himself, which he’s not, having Cas pressed against his side feels quite nice.
Dean can’t help the annoyance creeping up his neck like cold sweat at that, and he snorts, “I haven’t heard you speak two words to me in days.”
They walk past a few shelves to get to the one Dean was looking for. He stops the cart and checks the selection of hair ties next to all the other hair products. He grabs a packet of black, elastic hair ties and turns to explain to Jack his plan to solve the hair problems, but when he turns around, Jack is deep into whatever is on the bottom shelf.
“Yeah”, Dean says, and smiles friendly at the couple who are walking past him towards the grand entrance of the museum. He looks at the small crowds of people that are hanging around the huge lobby, self consciously tugging at the sleeve of his tux a bit. He hates cases that require monkey suits, but you don’t go undercover to steal a cursed ring, that’s caused three dead people last week alone, wearing jeans. Sam’s lucky enough to be good around computers, so this part falls to him every time.
“Dean!”
The way Cas says it sounds like a neutral statement, an observation, and Dean realizes he didn’t think how Cas would feel about that at all. The tone of his voice doesn’t give anything away.
“Wait, did you say 4B?” Dean asks. He’s not waiting for an answer, but already runs towards the building.
“You know what you have, though?” Novak says and Dean can feel his breath on his face, “Some paint on your hair.”
The shit he’ll get from his boss won’t be anything compared to the sad look Jack gave him when he explained to him that Dean will be there when he wakes up from his nap.
Dean’s initial reaction is to try to push away, but Cas’s hold of him is tight. Dean keeps trying to get away, but Cas doesn’t let go, forcing him into the hug that doesn’t give the comfort it should.
It’s Friday, and Dean’s trying to keep himself busy by packing all the stuff Jack’s going to need at Sam’s. They’re going through all his toys to choose the favorites to pack with him, the pile getting quite big already.
He grabs his boxers from the floor, and as he’s pulling them on, he feels movement on the bed.
Cas hands him the bed sheet he’s picked up from the dryer, sighing, “Why are you so interested in this?”
“Charlie.”
and it feels like he’s been on this sauce aisle for hours already.
that anyway. Dean has actually grown fond of the guy and maybe that is the reason he is so afraid to ask. Cas turning him down would feel so much worse than any random hot person at a bar or on the street.
Cas pushes himself up from the table and closes the laptop, “If it makes you feel better”, he laughs quietly, rubbing a tired hand over his face. He crosses the kitchen to wait for his turn to prepare himself a snack after Dean’s done, continuing, “though I would expect you to be a bit better at handling the changes in your emotions than our three year old.”
What Dean forgot is that Cas is a little shit. He looks like he’s seriously considering something.
“Oh”, he says, “Didn’t know you had company.”
Bobby watches them from a distance for a moment before walking to them.
because Novak said his hair is nice.
They’ve waited for so long Cas has no idea how long it’s been. He would place his guess in hours, but it feels like days. He’s watching Dean walk around in circles, face hard as a stone, hands in fists so tight his knuckles are white.
“Sorry about the kiss.”
He doesn’t.
Dean frowns at that. “What?”
Despite Cas very kindly pointing out that it’s not possible, ever since Dean left the house, he’s lived in the blissful, fake reality where he would never have to see Cas ever again, but yeah, there is the fact that they literally have a child together.
Cas rolls his eyes but smiles after to make sure Dean knows he’s joking. He makes a point of taking his hands off of Dean, and it takes all of Dean’s willpower to slide off of Cas, and back next to him.
Sam gives him an empathetic look, and only nods, because he doesn’t have anything to say to that, and Dean understands. He wouldn’t know what to say to that either.
I was there with them, before I passed out.”
Benny continues, “Doesn’t seem to like me much though.”
they are dating, but now Dean feels like they are actually dating. Well, fake dating, as Dean tries to remind himself all the time, but it’s too easy to live in the fantasy.
If there weren’t lives at stake in this, Dean would blow this cover right away and turn to look at Cas just to see the struggle he’s probably going through in attempting to hide the shock or anger in his face.
He grabs a glass of champagne from a waiter right before he reaches the bar, plastering his best grin over his face.
Cas is talking about pizza, but his words hit somewhere deeper, and not because he gives Dean free time away from the stove with his offer. He is talking about pizza, so why does his words feel like a hug to that part of Dean that might’ve finished the conversation differently?
“Good?” Charlie echoes.
Cas smiles and chuckles at that, thankful for Mick’s thoughtful and considerate character, and that he’s not asking anything else. The man gives him a peck on the cheek, before letting go of his hand and leaving.
“I sure sometimes wish I wasn’t”, Cas says through a tight smile. Rowena fortunately seems to think he’s joking and laughs at that.
Eventually he gets up and leaves the book on the bedside table, makes sure the kid’s properly tucked in before leaving the room.
were uncomfortable. How hard is it to choose comfortable seats for a place where people have to spend time just waiting for something?
Most of the stuff he’s gotten has either Paw Patrol or Peppa Pig on them, because they had hinted to everyone that those two are in at the moment. It seems like everyone’s done a good job with choosing their gifts since Jack is in awe of each and every one.
“I wanna sleep here”, Jack mumbles and crawls closer, snuggling against Cas’s side. He presses his face against Cas’s chest.
“Hey, handsome.”
“It’s too soon”, Cas says as he loads the laundry into the machine, “Everyone probably has plans for Friday already.”
“Castiel?”
He turns around to leave the room.
“No!”
“What?” he snaps at Cas’s annoying smile, “You looked like you needed some space.”
“Don’t worry, Dean”, Charlie calls without taking her focus off the unconscious patient in front of her, “Sir, can you hear me? Cas?”
Cas and Jack are building a race car tack on the living room floor when the front door opens sometime in the afternoon.
Which, right now as Cas makes a small sound against his lips, parting them a little, seems like the most ridiculous thing ever, because as messy and as awkward angled the kiss is, it’s a pretty fucking great one.
She literally finds a way to bring that up every time they’re having a conversation.
“Did you just–did you just text him?” she manages, eyes travelling between Dean and the phone next to her, “Are you that desperate to avoid the conversation?”
“No. You watch it”, he frowns seriously.
And that’s the worst thing: Jack keeps bringing up Kelly, and Dean has no idea how many times he can deal with it, especially with the sleepless brain and a screaming, hangry child who doesn’t understand what’s going on.
Before the silence stretches too long, Dean gets out whatever he was thinking outside the car. He finds himself reaching for Cas’s hand, “Yeah just, uh, thanks.”
He doesn’t even get to close his own eyes when Jack opens his again, and he lifts his head from under Cas’s hand to look around, “Where’s Dean?”
“If you get out before my shift ends, I’m calling Jody to be with you”, he states as Charlie and Jo roll him into the ambulance.
“No— listen, I don’t want the Peppa Pig cake— I know you have that on your website, but you do custom cakes as well, right?” he asks, and Cas can hear the frustration in his tone, “Cool, so it’s
It’s almost twelve. He slept almost until noon.
Dean drops a frustrated head on Cas’s shoulder, his groan muffled on the fabric of his jacket. Cas shakes a little when he laughs quietly, smoothing a hand down Dean’s back, now on the top of the shirt.
Dean levels him with a look, “When is your birthday, Cas?”
“Are you kidding me?”
He speaks to the poster, “This all just reminded me of—” he doesn’t have to finish his sentence for Cas to get the idea, so he doesn’t. “Fuck.”
He forces his expression to be nonchalant and tries anyway, “Doesn’t matter.”
is that something you would recommend someone to do?” he exclaims.
In the dark hallway, his eyes look a darker shade of blue than usually. Dean swallows before he forces an easy smile back to his lips. “Yeah, right”, he huffs and steps away from Cas’s space before he does something stupid like pushes the man back against the wall and continues into what they pretended to start just before.
The friendly smiles he gets from the others boosts his confidence enough to sit down, holding Jack in his lap, the poor thing fisting the front of his shirt in fear. Dean opens the container where he has some snacks prepared for the kid, and prays that he’ll eat them, now that there are eyes on them, watching how he handles Jack.
He can’t help but smile, when the kid runs towards Dean and the man scoops him up and in the air, the kid giggling as he lands back on Dean’s arms.
“Oh, and I bought you that ice cream”, Dean suddenly remembers, and he’s about to get up to get it when he suddenly realizes something. Fuck.
“Just a few beers too much with an early morning shift”, he grumbles, rubbing his temples and forcing out a chuckle, “I’m getting old.”
“Thanks”, Dean says, not turning to look at him either.
Leaving the bedroom while Cas is still awake feels much more awkward than sneaking out the night before. They just kind of stare at each other for a moment, and then Dean awkwardly gets up. Jack rolls over to the empty space Dean left on the bed without waking up.
“You’re not concentrating on the game and it’s ruining my stats so spill before I’m too annoyed to be a good friend”, she explains easily, nodding at the paused screen.
He notices the entrance to the section Sam means on the second floor, to the right from the beautiful, marble stairs, closed with a red ribbon. “Fuck. It’s closed.”
“Fuck”, he breathes out loud as well.
Kasey is still standing there, eyes flicking between the two, and Jack on Cas’s arms. Dean’s dumbfounded look fits the situation perfectly, and as realization hits her, the flirtatious smile on her lips fades away.
talking with him?
. He’s scanning the room with his eyes as if a mattress or a second bed would magically appear in front of him.
Confused, he examines himself for a moment, surprised how relaxed and rested he feels, laying there in the warmth of his blanket, woken up by nothing else but his body telling him he’s slept enough and it’s time to get up. He reaches for his phone on the nightstand and looks at the time, a surprised expression falling on his face.
“Are you mad?”
“Sam and Eileen are sleeping in Sam’s old room”, Bobby says and motions towards the staircase, “Made you boys a bed upstairs in your old room. The others will arrive later this week.” He wishes them goodnight and disappears down the hallway, where his bedroom is.
“Fine”, Cas repeats firmly, not breaking the eye contact either.
The antibiotics kick in, and Jack starts to have a little bit of life in him again. They spend a chill evening by the couch anyway, under the blankets with Paw Patrol on the TV and cups of ice cream on their laps.
Usually, Cas has a tote bag full of books, but since there’s only two tiny books to be returned, they only take Jack’s bag with them. Cas has bought Jack his own tote bag for the library trips, similar to his but a smaller one that he can carry on his shoulder. They always put a book or two there for him to carry, because it seems to be very important for the kid, even if Cas offers to carry them all.
“I already called Bobby, that I won’t make it today”, Dean explains, and takes the frying pan to the table, “Besides you sounded so tired on your voicemail I thought maybe it’s best to not have a hungry kid waiting for you.”
Dean turns fully towards him, crossing his arms as he grins. “Are you going
He rummages through the drawers. “Do you know where the scissors are?”
in his head before he can stop himself, and as it hits, Dean instantly leaves the room, closing the door behind him.
“Dean!” Jack snaps him from his thoughts, slapping his thigh with a toy truck, “It is stuck”, he says and Dean grabs the toy from him, already hearing the uneasy tone on his voice, which indicates a tantrum coming.
“Fuck!”
Jack nods and grabs a cooked carrot from the plate, stuffing it into his mouth.
He forces his face to a normal expression before turning around to look at the kid, who’s already looking at him from the kitchen table, a crayon absentmindedly hanging between his fingers.
“No, no, no—” is all Dean gets out before Novak slaps his hand on his head, rubbing the dark blond hair full of white paint.
share your thoughts, if you want! <3 leave a comment or message me on
Dean side eyes Cas in time to see him roll his eyes.
There’s a lump in Dean’s throat suddenly, when he looks at Jack smiling and making car sounds, busy trying all the levers and buttons he can find. The thing’s completely dead, so he’s safe to do so.
“You don’t even eat breakfast on a normal morning.”
At the last second, Dean comes up with a solution.
“We?” Dean asks, eyebrows raising, “
Cas rolls his eyes, irritated about Dean’s good mood, especially when he had to work overtime again, “I’ll go get some fresh air”, he states and goes out through the back door.
The first guests to arrive are Sam and Eileen. Despite Jack being very comfortable around the two, the kid’s suddenly a bit shy when he’s asked to come to the door.
They’re trying to be quiet, when they look at the two in the living room. Sam’s tall figure is the only one visible from the kitchen door, his back turned to them.
Well, not just that. They’re best friends and have been for a long time. They lived together before, and it’s not like Dean had anything left when Cas told him he’s gonna move for the new job. There are fires everywhere, he might as well put them off in another city, where he gets to see Cas as much as he’s used to.
in the front.
Jack’s whole face twists up like it had done before when they’d made him take the medicine, keeping his eyes tightly shut as he swallows it down, earning praises from them both. Dean quickly sticks the straw into his mouth, and he drinks juice on top of it.
This must be one of his dates. Dean’s made a ridiculous, huge point of not seeing anyone twice or never seeing anyone during daytime or whatever, so Cas’s wondering if Dean has any idea this girl seems to have their address.
She opens her mouth and Cas goes numb.
Cas looks up, eyes heavy with something that’s probably just alcohol, gaze travelling down Dean’s face, and it hits Dean again just how bad he wants to kiss him.
so my own favorite scene of this story is the one where dean caught cas smoking. i've written the first draft of that scene like waaay before this story was even a proper plot idea and just random scenes and ideas and what ifs. it's literally one of the reasons i started writing this story properly, because i needed this fanfic to put the smoking scene in hahah. and it's just crazy that now it has all this story around it and it's out there!
They all have different ways to deal with the waiting. Kelly’s father stays silent most of the time. Mrs. Kline cries, desperately arranges things, and Cas focuses on trying to calm her down every now and then, grounding himself in trying to ground her.
coffee.”
Cas is full on grinning when Dean roars loudly, but then falls to the grass the second Jack pushes him a bit. The kid steps closer to check if he’s really okay, and Dean just grabs him in the air, lying on his back as he holds the wiggling kid above him.
“In his defense, has he really seen people other than you or Cas?” Sam counters. “I’ve met him only a few times and rarely too, he just needs his time.”

Cas rubs a hand over his face and through the mess of his hair, pushing himself up to sit. Dean’s nowhere in the room, and Cas has no idea what time it is. Or why Dean’s not there.
After they’ve discussed some of the issues with sleeping and eating, they join Jack on the soft carpet, and she asks him some questions, to which he doesn’t really answer. There’s the toys, and the fact that he doesn’t seem interested enough to talk to her, which Dean can respect. He doesn’t talk much at home either, and when he does it’s to mention Kelly mostly. Their time is up soon after that, and with some more flyers in hand they leave again.
“Who said I was even interested in Dean romantically? I just merely enjoy that he treats us as friends and not ‘minions’. Besides, I’m pretty sure he’s straight.”
“You’re the son I’ve never had, kid. I love you, don’t forget that.”
“If you find out, I’d be happy to go with you,” Castiel sighed, “the last thing I need is to get roped into some grand plan I want nothing to do with.”
Dean fought him off as best he could, throwing a couple punches in defense, but he didn’t get out looking so hot.
“What?” Dean groggily responds.
“Tell me about it, if you see anything resembling an engineering firm send me the bat signal,” Dean joked, at ease for the first time since entering the building.
"How's this rose looking?" Samandriel asked seriously, sliding the paper over the counter.
Cas huffed out a laugh, “I mean to look at not to make.”
“Morning, Angel,” he greeted deeply, pressing an insistent kiss to Cas’ lips.
Azazel didn’t even try to conceal his snort and Lilith giggled loudly at his expense. “We’ll take ourselves somewhere where the minions are more competent.”
“Alright, alright enough,” Bobby spoke up. “Remember, we have our last few clients and
there was some framed art up on the walls, but there weren’t any cliché stencils of cartoon
“Hey Charlie, how’s my favorite computer nerd doing?”
The door opened gently and Dean entered, followed by the smell of something delicious. Cas was so lost in thought, he didn’t hear Dean approach him, and startled slightly when Dean gave his shoulder a little nudge, “Come on, Angel, I made dinner.”
“Lead the way,” Dean agreed, happy to follow.
legit in this lighting... if I close one eye,” he chuckled. “Come on back.”
Cas entered the sterile hospital room and was greeted by Dean’s younger brother Sam, and surrogate father Bobby, both of whom were friendly with Cas.
“There’s the lake, the same as ever. Man, I miss being a kid here,” Dean reminisced.
“I was named after an angel, I told you that right?” Cas smiled.
“Yes,” the jogger answered, voice deep and hoarse.
The pouring rain was doing nothing to relieve the thick fog of humidity. Sweat was rolling down Dean’s back and forehead as he lay in his bunk, bored out of his mind. What was the point of summer camp if he was going to be cooped up inside all day? He was here to swim in the lake, go canoeing and hiking and play paintball in the woods. This rain was really harshing the vibe.
“FINALLY!”
"What're you doing tomorrow?" Dean asked with a laugh.
“You let him school you again, Benny? Come on,” Dean joked.
Dean snorted, his green eyes meeting Castiel’s blue ones. “Hey Cas, any chance you want to get something to eat after this?”
“I believe I saw a map hidden just this way,” Castiel gestured, “perhaps we could figure it out together.”
“Yes, and so should you,” Cas teased.
“Oh.” Dean paused, “Well this camp must be loads more fun!” He laughed a little nervously, not wanting to offend Cas, but unsure of how to respond.
“Pleased to meet you,” Benny greeted politely.
“Well maybe I can help with that,” Dean smiled seductively as he leaned slowly, placing his hand on Cas’ neck, guiding him to Dean’s lips. The kiss electrified all of Cas’ nerves, the feel of Dean’s lips on his was one of them most maddeningly intoxicating kisses he’s ever had.
Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed :)
on it and fallen asleep. But he was on a mission.
“My humanities course, War and Adventure in Ancient Ethic, its difficult but quite fascinating,” Cas answered, flattered that Dean actually took the time to remember his name and treat him like a real person, a friend even, when most people barely acknowledged his existence. “Which exam are you preparing for?”
Dean plopped onto the bed that sat directly behind the desk chair, and flashed Cas a sympathetic smile, “You can take a little break with me, just for dinner.”
“Nothing this morning,” the jogger admitted.

Sure, there were a few other times, like when a divorced soccer mom had been choking on a hot dog and Dean gave her the Heimlich and got her breathing again. He didn’t consider that one as important, although she did offer to show him a good time to return the favor, and gave him her phone number, but he still isn’t sure how he feels about that.
“I just wish I knew who she was waiting for at the bar, in that red leather jump suit and feathery headband.” Cas pondered, dropping down next to Dean on the couch, their legs pressing up against each other.
“You’re totally in, he has to date you now,” she declared.
“Why would he say yes?” Dean huffed, joining her.
“The myth behind it is quite fascinating. It’s about the woman Psyche who fell in love with the angel Cupid, their love was forbidden because he was a heavenly figure and she was a human,” Cas explains.
wasn't exactly allowed to practice on anybody, but he was allowed to design and observe.
As if on cue, a nurse rolled Dean in. He was quiet and looked mildly dazed. “Mr. Winchester did fine in all of our post op exams, but he is still moderately delirious because of the drugs so we want to keep him for a few more hours.”
“I’ve been saving up,” Dean threw a duffle bag over his shoulder. All of his possessions, boiled down to one duffle bag.
“You tell them the truth,” Bobby advised, “and hopefully they lock up your old man for assault before I get my hands on him,” his voice deepened to a low growl.
They were just starting to debate the Lord of the Rings franchise and Harry Potter when Benny and Garth returned from the rec room.
Dean leaned in and kissed Cas sweetly and inquired, “What did I do to deserve you?”
“Cas!” Dean exclaimed, jumping off the chair to see him, “How’re you feeling?”
“Yes,“ Dean choked out, helping Cas do the same so they were both blissfully nude.
Cas was completely stunned but also had to fight the very strong urge to cheer. He couldn’t even pretend to hide his smirk when the group looked both embarrassed and outraged at Dean’s threat.
“What’s your name?” Dean inquired.
“Dean, is everything alright?” Cas prompted.
“Mmhm,” Cas moaned quietly.
They quickly became one of the closest band of friends at camp. They were always together, debating books and comics and video games, running around with all the endless energy of prepubescent boys. Garth loved discussing the environment and bee populations with Cas, and Benny and Dean were keen on becoming the kayak champions in the camp-wide race. Not to mention, Cas made an amazing addition to their paintball team, his strategy and wilderness navigation skills had them practically unbeatable. But more often than not, Dean and Cas were together, reading or laughing, having the time of their lives.
Charlie’s eyes grew serious, “What did he call him?”
“I’m an occupational therapist," he answers, finally happy to have something else to talk about.
“Dean, you could never hold me back,” Cas pleaded. “I love you and if you’re not ok with traveling together than we can work it out, we can make compromises. I just love you and want to be with you.”
“You better be,” Dean teased. “I miss my boyfriend!”
“So, rough day?” Dean prompted, crossing his arms and leaning against his bunk.
“I-I don’t know, Cas. That’s a big move and I couldn’t just leave Bobby and the shop after everything they’ve done for me.” Dean lamented worriedly.
After cleaning up the kitchen, and Cas praising Dean a few more times for his amazing cooking skills, Dean led Cas into his bedroom for a little change of scenery.
Dean woke up to a few pleasantly sore muscles and a new silver band around his left ring finger. He blinked lazily and turned to take in the sight of his husband, lying next to him in bed, their naked forms covered only by a thin white sheet. He looked to his wedding band, inspecting it under the morning light, and then back to the relaxed face of his gorgeous husband. Dean shifted so that his head rested on Cas’ chest, and snuggled in beside him, filled with happiness, love and contentment.
The next thing Dean knew John was swinging at him with the jagged glass.
“Well somebody looks pretty happy for the closing midterm shift!” Charlie called jovially as she entered, her red hair bouncing as she walked toward him.
“Bobby I wanna thank you for-” Dean began, trying to express a fraction of the gratitude he had for Bobby, but he stopped him.
Dean waltzed in with his fake ID and even faker bravado, and walked right up to Bobby,
“Tea isn’t coffee… I need coffee, it’s too early,” Cas mumbled to himself, disgruntled.
“Dude he’d totally go for you, you basically belong on Baywatch,” Jo encouraged.
“It’s not as bad as it looks,” Dean answered, lifting up the towel to inspect his father’s handiwork, grateful Bobby was driving so Dean wouldn’t have to look him in the eye. “Besides, what am I supposed to tell them if they asked what happened?”
“Do you feel any better, Dean?” Sam clarifies.
Technically he’d only saved one life, last summer. It was a gorgeous day, one of the nicest in July, but there was supposed to be a storm coming in the next few days so the water was pretty rough. The beach was packed; days like these were a little stressful because there were so many people and a lot to keep track of. Normally on really busy days there would be two lifeguards to a section, but three people had called out so Dean was by himself. For the most part it had been going smoothly, the water was a little cold so not many people were swimming, most were just soaking up some sun. There were a couple teenagers boogie boarding on the shore Dean had his eye on, an experienced surfer way out in the distance, and a little boy whose mom was not paying very close attention. Dean’s focus shifted continuously through the crowds and the water, to the few people who got his attention.
Charlie eyes him for a moment before just shrugging, “Okay”, she says, and then, “wanna play something?”
“Sure thing, sir”, Dean answers with his own voice, a smile tugging at the corner of his lip, and the sight of that alone feels so rare that the warm feeling it brings to Cas feels almost overwhelming.
The others are running in as well, and soon there’s a pair of hands on his shoulders when Charlie is pulling him away.
Cas takes the ice cream cups and disappears to the kitchen, and Dean gently scoops the kid in his arms and makes his way down the hallway.
Despite being tired as fuck, this might be the happiest morning of his entire life.
“It’s in nine days”, Cas answers as he prepares the coffee maker, wondering how many times he’s going to get to answer that.
“I assume you boys know the spellwork to get all the rings working requires blood”, she starts, taking a long, calming breath in, “I know, very messy, very annoying”, she waves a hand as she casually picks up Dean’s knife from the table. “
“There’s not enough of the same size”, Cas explains, “and these are prettier.”
Cas shoots him an irritated look, stepping closer like he was challenging him, “No, it wouldn’t—"
Cas drops his eyes, letting out a sad chuckle, “I know I’m not horrible at it, but sometimes I just wonder…”
They’re quiet in the backseat of the cab for the first half of the ride, staring out of their respective windows. Dean thought Cas fell asleep by the way he’s leaning against his window, so his drunk brain is slow to follow when the man suddenly speaks.
“I do not have a stick in my ass”, Novak says, with a tone like people with sticks up their asses say.
“Cas?” she calls, and he realizes he’s been quiet for a long time “That’s—your name, right?”
“You keep moving like something is bothering you”, Cas turns his face to look at Dean, “Is everything okay?”
Cas’s fingers leave Dean’s skin for the moment it takes him to fumble through the buttons of his shirt before shrugging it off his shoulders. It’s amazing how it’s almost like a strip show and not like one at all, the dull way Cas just gets rid of the clothing, but still managing to make it the hottest thing Dean’s ever seen.
Dean’s old room turns into a storage space for now. Jack enjoys the increasing amount of big cardboard boxes he can turn into tiny houses and hiding places and towers taller than himself.
“It’s your birthday”, Dean makes him take the beer, and grabs the monitor, “You’ve earned it.”
“And he was even a bigger kid than you are, and he would tell me he doesn’t want to take the medicine”, he continues.
A dirty towel isn’t the only thing he wants to leave for tomorrow to deal with. Dean crawls back to the bed, and when Cas turns to his side, Dean finds his place behind him, pressing his lips to the nape of his neck.
Together they turn their confused eyes to Kelly, who stands on the other side of the isle, eyeing them.
Cas places the coffee mug carefully on the tray and lifts a finger, “Also, can I just ask a follow up question: would you always bring it to the bed? See, I enjoy a slow morning and a breakfast in bed would--”
Their conversation switches from talking to just staring at each other with stupid smiles on their faces, but before Dean has time to fall too deep into it, someone cuts in from the door.
“You just have to press the power off first, then turn it on again, choose the first program and after that you can change it to whatever you want.” Dean presses the buttons as he talks the way through on how to get the machine working. He has been using the laundromat a few times, enough to know that you should always choose another washer if possible.
Dean answers quite quickly based on how fast Jack is introducing himself with an excited, “Hello, Dean, it’s me!”
“Dude, at least
“No”, Cas says, still confused about sleeping so late, and now this.
“Now, how big of a sandcastle you think we can build?” she asks in a tone that's sure to get any kid's attention, “Let's build the biggest castle ever while Dean grabs something from the stroller real quick, huh?”
Dean can feel the adults on the side table looking at him but hesitates to fully turn to look there. They break the cakes to make room for new ones, since Jack is clearly all about the sand cake business now, and they manage to spend quite a lot of time doing just that.
“What if Jack hates me?” he blurts and blinks at himself, “I–I mean what if I’ve fucked up, and, and Jack just–”
Dean grabs himself a soda from the cooler while he’s crouching close to it. He grins as he knocks the soda against the beer bottle in Benny’s hands, “Food and people, what’s better?”
Dean remembers he has some paperwork he wants to get done before the weekend, the kids fight over the PlayStation controller, Jack brings a glass of juice on the sofa when Dean’s not watching and accidentally knocks it down on the carpet while Dean tries to make Claire eat the leftover soup she hated yesterday too. He sends the kids to the backyard to play for a moment and dries the juice, but it still leaves a stain.
“Uh, could you maybe watch him for a few more hours?” Dean croaks, rubbing his temple.
Jack lets go of Dean and lets himself drop to the bed. He scoots over towards Cas, his back against Cas’s chest.
They drink the stupid little juice boxes in silence, eyes flicking at everything but mostly they’re just staring at each other, sitting so close to each other their legs brushing constantly, whenever one of them shifts.
Dean nods, but doesn’t leave just yet, too busy watching Cas as he rolls up the sleeves, revealing a pair of muscly arms. Dean’s favorite part about dates is when the clothes are gone, but whatever outfit Cas chooses he’s going to be just fine.
She puts the tray and the gift aside to hug them both. “There’s beer in the kitchen for you boring people with no sense of adventure in your souls.”
“You won’t tell Jack if I drink one of these?” he turns to ask Cas, showing him the drink, “I swear he keeps count on these."
“There’s never time for that, there’s stuff”, he answers weakly to Charlie, holding his fingers up for his list of excuses he’s come up with already, “There’s Jack, work, schedules, there’s playdates, getting groceries and cooking dinners, you know,
“We should sleep”, Dean says and Cas makes a sound of agreement, before crawling closer to Dean, who is already holding his arms open for him, like it’s the most natural thing in the world, like this wasn’t the first time they’re close like this. Cas settles in on Dean’s arms and they are both passed out in a second.
“So, how was your date?”
Obviously, he can’t do that, so he settles for a hug, closing his eyes tight as he takes in the way Cas’s arms easily wrap around him, firm hands on his back.
“I think the message will go through”, Dean assures. He eyes the already finished cards, set aside while the glitter dries. “Everyone’s gonna love those. Everyone’s gonna be covered in glitter, but they’ll love it.”
“Hey”, Cas says softly, much closer this time, and Dean jolts a little when a pair of hands wrap around his wrists, pulling his palms away from his eyes.
Cas is greeted with very excited exclamations when he opens the front door, and Jack runs towards him, three ponytails bouncing on the top of his head. Jack is explaining with such a speed Cas can’t even make out all the words he’s trying to pronounce, pointing at the ponytails in his head and showing the ones he’s holding.
Cas crosses the room, dropping his backpack on the way, and sits down on the bed, holding from the edge with his hands on his sides, looking over his shoulder, like he’s examining the size of the bed.
, Meg says, something weird in her tone. Dean doesn’t have time to think about it too much, because his focus is on Meg’s hand that’s still on Cas’s arm, because this chick won’t stop touching Cas, apparently.
want to get baby fever, remember?”
Jack considers for a moment, quickly glancing at Cas, but grabs Sam by the index finger, and slowly lets himself be walked down the hallway towards the living room.
When Dean gets himself killed for the third time within the last five minutes, Charlie pauses the game abruptly.
They spend most of their morning decorating the house.
“You’re the best”, Dean says again, when he turns back to Cas.
Cas heads straight to his bedroom when they step back inside.
“We can try”, Cas grins against the skin on Dean’s neck when he notices the man’s breathing is starting to get heavier when Cas goes for places he knows will get the reactions he wants out of Dean. “When I told you what I would do to you in the backseat of your car, I made a promise to do it.”
“Come on, baby”, he says, bringing a hand to graze his fingers on Cas’s cheekbone, telling himself it’s only for the joke and nothing else. Cas flicks his hand away.
The guilt in Cas’s face turns into a shy smile.
It feels
“Oh, yeah, I’ve been awake for
starting to regret not filling Jo in with the details right away.
“Your turn, kid”, Dean says, and after a moment Jack reluctantly stretches his arm towards Cas who gently removes the bracelet from his hand and puts it carefully to the basket like the priceless treasure it is.
He doesn’t.
Cas and Dean share a worrying look.
“But that’s what you meant”, Dean counters, throwing his hands to the side, “Fine, you want me to be normal, I’ll be normal.”
Cas thinks it’s annoying, because it’s rude to be like that when there’s a group of people around them too. No one else seems bothered by it, but still.
Sam says in a tone that
Cas laughs at that, and some of that unexplained tightness in Dean’s chest eases up a bit. Cas asks Dean more about his evening with Jack, and the weird tension around them fades away as they make their way to the living room.
The third time they meet the others at the park, and Donna’s pouring some coffee on some disposable cups, Dean asks if he should bring the coffee the next time, because it seems the women are taking turns, and he doesn’t want to be an asshole who doesn’t contribute.
Dean chuckles and reaches to ruffle the kid’s hair, smiling at him.
Cas lifts his eyes from his book when he hears Jack calling him.
“Okay, so, breakfast in bed.”
“Yeah”, Dean says, “You?”
Dean lets out an easy chuckle, because it’s not like Cas was wrong, “Don’t worry about it. We’re good?”
“Yeah, Cas, you’re my best friend.”
Since there’s no space left, Cas is left standing awkwardly in the doorway, an unsure look on his face.
Cas nods, pulling his notebook from his bag. He grabs a pen, “The guestlist is probably the easiest part”, he says as he makes notes.
Dean’s working a longer shift today, because Cas has a day off, so he decides to let the kid sleep for now to give himself peace to figure out some quick lunch to cook.
“Why don’t you, then?” Dean asks, clarifying, when Cas frowns at him, “Quit your job?”
“Okay, now”, Cas smiles, trying to calm them down, “maybe we should tone it down a bit before it gets out of hand, what do you think, Goldilocks?” he asks Dean.
“Why would you think you’ve fucked up?” Bobby simply asks.
(See the end of the chapter for
The kid somehow looks even
Just as he’s about to put some shampoo in his hair, he hears the bathroom door opening, and someone stepping inside. He peeks from behind the shower curtain.
“The party…” Cas starts putting the pieces together.
“That was amazing”, Dean speaks quietly, smile in his tone, “You good?” he asks casually, while he gets comfortable under the covers.
Dean hums in agreement. Jack moves his finger to the next face in the picture. “That’s you”, he names, even if the picture is blurry because they were unaware they were being filmed and he’s just moving.
He doesn’t want to do any thinking, all he wants to do right now is eat some pizza and drown himself into some movie, but his damn couch is too big for him even if it’s been fine before. The apartment around him doesn’t feel that much like home anymore either.
Jack looks around with his mouth hanging open, when Cas pushes the strollers inside the huge lobby with a high ceiling Jack’s trying to glance all the way up to. The library isn’t very crowded, but Jack eyes curiously at the few people walking past them from the safety of his strollers.
have some catching up to do, come on.”
that they still have to figure out.
Chocolate is definitely the number one flavor.
As soon as it shuts, Dean’s filled up with guilt.
i hope you enjoy!!
“Is this the moment when we kiss, because I think there should be a ki—”
“What are you kids up to?”
And once again, Dean sees himself in Jack in a way he wishes he didn’t.
He’s blushing so hard and it’s horrible, but suddenly Novak is leaning towards him, making him fall back down on the grass as he kisses him. The angle is a bit awkward and they keep their lips closed for a second, but it’s still
Looking at the two sleeping there, Dean doesn’t want to leave the room. But he can’t stay either, so eventually he forces himself to get up, trying not to wake the two when he makes his way out of the room.
Cas doesn’t even eat breakfast.
The first time worked well, because the poor thing had no idea medicine is pure torture that tastes like ass, and agreed to take the spoonful, which of course left to disgust and cries of betrayal.
The more guests arrive, the easier it gets to avoid each other, because there’s so much to do: guests to entertain, snacks tables to maintain and gifts to help Jack open, things like that.
No reaction. Dean sees a little bit of blood on Cas’s hairline, he must’ve hit his head bad. He tries to rip himself free without succeeding. “
“When did you become wiser than your big brother?” he mocks, because Sam has a point, but he can’t give him the satisfaction.
The way he says it makes Dean want to ask more, but he doesn’t know how, or even if he should at all.
Dean walks over towards the coffee table and picks up a dirty washcloth that looks like it’s been used to dry spilled coffee. There’s a bit of dust on the surface visible in the sunlight that pours in from the big windows.
It’s really hard for Dean to keep his serious face when Cas starts laughing, the sound of it soothing something inside him, like it always does when he gets to hear Cas laugh. He plays his role and gets up, pretending to leave, but Cas grabs his hand, pulling him to sit down again.
“I—” he starts, “I am—the last time we were here I—” he can’t form a fucking sentence to save his life, it’s impossible to put words to the feeling he has in his head.
“Oh my God, we are so sorry”, he says, “We just got a little carried away. This one gets crazy when he gets any champagne in his system”, he pretends to grimace, when he nods towards Cas.
“No, I am ordering the cake”, Dean simply says, lifting his hands.
Cas doesn’t meet his eyes when he speaks, “Dean, this is Mick.”
She gives them a shy smile, “It’s still a secret actually, but yeah. After my father.”
“It was my birthday a week ago, so does that mean you’ll take care of that?” Cas asks, pointing at the dirty pile of plates.
“Dean”, he says to stop him from leaving.
Charlie still has some of the decorations up, probably out of laziness more than anything else. She rambles about something that happened at work while she makes them coffee, and Dean quietly listens to her, glad that she’s filling the silence.
Cas nods, “You’re right. We’ll do it tomorrow.”
Sam asks softly,
“Thank you, Jack”, Cas smiles and takes the present, balancing the tray in his lap. As a precaution, he puts the coffee mug on the bedside table before the moving toddler knocks it over.
Dean turns his whole body towards Cas and looks at him with his best ‘what the fuck’ face, but Cas just
Dean slowly picks up the pace just a bit, placing kisses all around Cas’s face, wherever his lips happen to land, because he just can’t get enough of the man underneath him.
He’s pulled back to reality, and he focuses his gaze back to the man in front of him, giving an apologetic smile, guilt weighing him down a bit. Anna was right, Mick is a lovely and a kind man, who deserves his full attention. He’s not being the perfect date right now, and Mick probably notices it.
"You're right, I
“I never wanted kids”, Dean starts, and it’s like speaking the words out loud hurts, but he forces them out, “because I—my dad, uh, growing up he wasn’t very—good at the whole being a father and all.” He doesn’t go into details, because it’s hard enough already, “And to turn into him, I—I didn’t want to risk that. I don’t want any kid going through that, not if I can stop it.”
That small spark of victory is gone by the next snack time when the bowl ends up on the floor.
“They will be covered with food.”
“You said he’s avoiding it too!” he dodges Charlie's question, “You said I don’t need fancy shit.”
There’s no harm in reading a bedtime story, and Dean would be an asshole if he declined, so he doesn’t. He sits down on the bed over the covers and opens the book and starts reading. Jack has a smile on his lips for the first time that day as he’s there between them, holding them both by the arm as he listens to the story, falling asleep.
When they’re done, Dean gets up from the chair but instead of leaving, he opens his mouth before realizing it.
apology accepted.”
It’s not the smile he’s seen on Dean’s face before, dimmer somehow, but it’s a smile, and Cas gets an urge to say something, but as soon as he opens his mouth, it’s gone again, and Dean gets up.
They make their way to the bedroom eventually, and Dean closes the door behind them. The room is dark without any lights on, but he walks Cas across the floor to the bed, where he lets him fall down on, legs hanging from the edge of the bed.
Dean calls Sam when they’re making their way back to the bar where he met with Cas earlier. “So, that was a bust.”
“I won’t, I’m awake.”
“And somehow you’ve still failed to put on
“Nah, wanted to go home with you”, Dean mumbles before he realizes he’s said it out loud. He literally has
And yeah, he should probably be happy as hell to not have to deal with Novak’s bullshit anymore and a few summers ago he would’ve been but, what can he say, Novak’s bullshit has kinda grown on him.
“I admire the way you always find ways to take care of the people around you, Dean.”
“Is it wrong to sometimes hope that the moment he’ll actually leave for college would come sooner?” Dean asks.
The conversation he had with the girls haunts him when he pulls Cas into a hug, before opening the car door for him.
“Jesus, chill”, Dean snaps when he finally opens the door, towel around his waist, chest still dripping wet as Cas hands him the kid before disappearing down the hallway towards his bedroom.
Jack, but Dean wasn’t convinced about Jack’s innocence.
“You don’t have to. I’ll do it tomorrow.”
, where i post my writing too, especially shorter fics! also... i might have something more planned for this au as well, so... let's just say there's a lot of chaotic ideas left in my brain for this little family, that didn't make the final cut of this story ;)
Cas sighs deep, and he’s about to tell Anna to stop trying.
Rowena steps into the room, and on instinct Dean tries to rip himself off the hold, anger boiling in him. She doesn’t look too concerned about it.
Looking at Cas, Dean knows he should take a sip, but he doesn’t.
“That’s the spirit!” Charlie praises when Dean puts the empty cup back on the tray, “If you liked it, there’s more in the kitchen.”
The sight brings a smile to his face. Of course Cas is the ‘weirdly obsessed about random things’ kind of drunk.
Dean keeps on shouting, pouring it all out on him. Cas wishes he could get angry, or cry, or shove Dean back when he shoves him, but he can’t.
“Cas”, Dean tries to call him, “Cas, wake up.”
“You’re good people”, Cas states in this drunken seriousness, when he sees Dean’s smile fading, and Dean has to chuckle.
and to
The man silences Cas by quickly turning back, “No, Cas, you know what?” The smile on Dean’s face is cold and it doesn’t reach his eyes as he takes a few, easy steps backwards to the door.
“Married?”
By the look on Cas’s face, the comeback lands like the stupid low blow it was.
“Dean?”
The tension in Dean’s still body builds, and Cas can feel it without even looking at the man next to him. Like a bomb, it builds.
“Yes”, Cas states like his blurted-out reaction wasn’t an accident, “Good that they can, you know, become friends even if Dean’s feelings were not reciprocated.”
“He probably means one of the library books”, Cas explains and shrugs off his coat, “I had to return them all already. I tried explaining that to him, but he doesn’t seem to understand the concept of libraries.”
“Maybe try to be less annoying”, Cas offers.
Dean gives it a more critical glance, “Lacks in glitter, but it’s okay, I guess. Why’d you draw me so short?”
“Ah, fuck. This can’t be heaven, because you’re here.”
Dean sighs, “But— I don’t know if we’re doing the right thing here.”
“I have to go away for a while, but I’ll be back”, he eventually settles on explaining.
“Yeah”, Dean mutters, and gives her a sad smile.
Dean tries to get a hit with his brush, somewhere on the other boy’s body but Novak’s
If they can avoid Jack turning into a monster like that, when there’s actual witnesses going to be present, they’re doing everything they can to keep it that way.
Charlie just hums, not reacting to his joke. Dean flicks his eyes away when she just keeps on staring, letting her figure stuff out on her own.
It’s a combination of people talking, keyboards making sounds under people’s fingers, papers being moved around, noises like that. Dean hates it, he could never work in an office, just because of the lifeless soundscape.
He wants to add that if Dean would want to hang around him for more than short moments at a time, he might remember how tall he actually is, but when he glances up, Dean’s smiling at him.
“Time to sing the birthday song, come on.”
Novak kinda has.
They had played with his toys for a moment and then Jack had spotted Sam’s course papers and markers on the coffee table and wanted to draw, and that’s what they were doing when Dean arrived.
Dean wants to roll his eyes at the way this Meg chick runs her hands down Cas’s arm slowly, like she’s taking her time to enjoy the way his muscles feel under her fingertips.
Dean is having a brotherly argument with Sam that he’s started for no other reason than to entertain himself while he is waiting for Cas to come downstairs. He has memorized where every one of those things have been hanged, so he doesn’t get Sam’s smug smile, when Cas walks into the living room and stops to stand next to him.
“Yeah”, Dean hums, explaining then, “We tried to get each other to drink more water, but it was a project that didn’t work so well”, and after a beat, he adds like a thought said out loud:
Dean looks uneasy under Jack’s eyes. Cas turns his attention from them to the sink and gets himself a glass of water.
Kids are weird.
The dark look on Dean’s face turns into a confused one. “What?”
Jody’s there with her five-year-old son Owen and his friend. Jo, as she already told, is there babysitting, and seems to enjoy the other two’s company even if she’s younger, and Donna is there with her daughter Wendy.
to have sex with the guy”, he says.
The older brother sighs, grabs the laundry bags from the hallway and heads out as well.
Her actually thinking that Cas is his wife sounds hilarious, but Dean’s not laughing.
“How was your day?” he asks Jack, but waits for Dean to answer.
It had been quite an intensive and emotionally charged trip to do all the shopping, but Cas couldn’t help feeling so happy watching the kid go crazy over choosing the decorations.
He greets some people coming out the front door, apparently leaving already. Their faces look vaguely familiar, so they’ve probably met at one of Kelly’s parties before, the ones with much more booze. The ones that are supposed to leave you with only vague memories of the people there.
He assumes he’s the Dean in question since there’s no one else on the aisle but him, and this brunette is smiling at him when she walks closer.
He tries to ignore the only possible answer there is; Dean regrets it much more than Cas thought he would. Dean can’t even shrug it off, simply because he hates that it happened in the first place.
“Oh, it’s fine, I can–”
The sight of their kid sleeping in the dim light, his mouth hanging open a little, has them stopping there just to look at him. His overgrown hair tangled and a mess around his head on the pillow, his tiny fingers are wrapped around Rebecca’s ear as the plushie itself is hanging on the edge of the bed. The lamp on the bedside table paints everything with a warm, soft light that adds the perfect filter to the quiet, calm view in front of them.
“That doesn’t make me feel any better, Dean.” Cas pouted.
him than anyone else.
“You’ll do better after a little food, Cas,” Dean’s voice broke him out of his trance.
“Hello, Dean.”
“You don’t dorm here?” Cas asked, curiously.
“Hey Lucas, how’s my favorite artist?” Dean spoke softly.
“Castiel,” his father nodded, “are you prepared to go?”
Free Will wasn't on the main strip in Vegas where all the hotels and famous nightclubs
“That about sums it up,” Bobby grunts.
Bobby sighed and gave a knowing nod, “I’ve fallen down a flight or two in my life also.
“Ok Cas, can you tell me what happened?” Dean ran through his first responder questions.
*		*		*		*		*		*
“Angel, why don’t you roll over, I can do your arms and chest too,” Dean practically whispered.
“Took you long enough, Winchester,” Cas smiled as he leaned back in for another lust-filled kiss.
“My mother’s death.”
“He’s your brother, Dean, and he’s a smart kid. It was for love,” Cas defended.
“Thank you, Cas.”
Slowly but surely Dean has added more and more art to his body. Piece by piece, lyric by lyric, symbol by symbol. Until all the scars were covered, until his body didn’t show his painful past, but the art and the stories of his life. Until Dean became art, not the battered son that the neighbors pitied. The art on his skin makes him like the parts of himself he hates.
The high school gymnasium bathed the crowd in fluorescent light, the echoes of shiny new shoes squeaking on basketball court floors mingled with idle business chit chat, while the smell of freshly printed resumes hung in the air. The local job fair was in full swing, new graduates, the recently laid off, and the midlife career changers plastered on their best smiles and rehearsed their elevator pitches as they tried to appear interested but not desperate. Bored HR reps man their booths, armed with vacant smiles and out of date business cards.
They hugged goodbye, eager to maintain their friendship until next summer.
Cas began to massage that perfect little spot in Dean just as tenderly as Dean had massaged him earlier. Dean was completely gone, small whines and pleads escaping his lips as he worked himself back on Cas’ fingers. “Want you,” he rasped, “Come on, Cas please.”
“I guess I can forgive you,” Cas gasped as Dean rode him closer and closer to climax.
“My life is apparently really complicated now,” Dean laments wearily.
“I only went out on that boat in the middle of the night because I had a huge crush on you,” Cas smiled.
up Dean’s short dirty-blonde hair, “Don’t cha just love it when the student becomes the
“Hello Dean, how are your studies going?” Cas ran his fingers through his ruffled hair as he stood up.
“What’s with the shiner?” he asked.
“Ow! What the hell?” he looked to Jo while rubbing his freshly flicked ear.
they were with him. Especially the days his father John drank away, endlessly blaming the
“Charlie, Harry had to marry Ginny because he had to marry a red-head like his mother, its all about literary symmetry,” Dean chimed in, in lieu of a traditional greeting.
Cas was forever grateful to Dean for his unwavering love and support.
“Hmm,” Dean smiled against Cas’ skin, “I love you.”
“Today is the ten year anniversary. It has to be today,” Dean replied, intentionally looking
He sighs, “So I’m 28, I’m finally a physical therapist at a hospital, I still live with my Sasquatch little brother and I have a gorgeous blue-eyed friend that looks like an angel but I’m not actually dating.”
“That sounds awesome!” Dean’s mouth was practically watering, “You in, Cas?”
“She’s in very capable hands, you know that,” Cas soothed.
His every move was full of rage and would echo through the house. Dean would tense and
“Do you see that?” Cas asked, pointing in wonderment at the people below them on the streets. “We’re up so high!” “You know, I heard the real Eiffel tower is like three times higher than this one! That’ll be scary, but awesome. I can’t wait!”
Sam and Bobby widen their eyes and exchange concerned glances, “Well, that’s my cue to go get a nurse,” Bobby states as he rises from his chair.
“Morning, Angel,” Dean rasped, his voiced laced with sleep and infatuation.
Dean smiled and blushed slightly looking away, “Thanks Cas.”
“I’m 18, you can’t stop me,” Dean answered curtly, daring a look into his eyes.
“If you want me to,” Cas smiles softly back.
Trailing Castiel, Dean felt his footing return, and upon reaching the map, tucked in a quiet corner away from the crowds, Dean felt as if he could finally take a breath. Eyeing Castiel, he was finally able to appreciate how handsome he was up close. “So, Castiel, what type of work are you looking for?” he inquired.
“That was a terribly cheesy line, Dean.” He spoke quietly, in an attempt to distract from the intensity of the moment. But it didn’t deter him from leaning back in for another kiss. Getting lost in the sensations, of Dean’s lips and his hands and his scent.
“So, what’s your call?” Dean asked curiously, noticing how Cas hadn’t flinched when Dean first pressed the needle into his skin.
Dean awoke to a pounding headache. His lips were cracked and dry, his throat scratchy and nose congested. He had been sick for two days already and he still felt awful.
“You should probably rest for a while,” Cas interjects quietly, “maybe you’ll remember more after some sleep.”
“Well you are still entitled to some fun,” Dean teased, “but I’m glad you’re ok.” He looked down at his feet for a second, and decided to gather up all his courage. “I gotta admit I missed you these last few days, my mornings aren’t the same without you.”
“I looked it up,” Cas told him, taking out all these community college brochures he had highlighted and wrote little notes on. “There are a ton of schools that have art education programs near mine. Dean you’re such an amazing artist and you love teaching and mentoring other artists, you should do this.”
“I’m quite stiff,” Cas commented, dropping to the carpet to stretch.
“Cas’ still here, he just left to change, he’ll be back in a minute,” Sam responds, casting Bobby a worried glance.
Dean was incredible in his patience, love and gentleness. On mornings like these he would do whatever Cas asked of him. Whether he needed to be held, talked to, listened to, or left alone. Dean would do it, he would support Cas in whatever way he needed, as long as Cas was able to communicate to Dean what was he needed. In the cases that Cas couldn’t articulate what he needed, Dean took his best shot, and was usually right.
“No, I commute, and I gotta look out for my kid brother at home so I try to get it out of the way.” Dean looked down at his hands as though he wasn’t used to talking about himself this openly.
Dean silently thanked the university for making him take Intro to Anatomy as his hands moved lower to Cas’ butt. After several minutes, Dean could hardly contain himself; the sounds Cas was making were absolutely sinful.
“Hmm?” Dean answered, snapping out of his daze.
“Hmm, romantic,” Cas smiled in return. “Maybe they had an affair one crazy weekend in Vegas but they were both married.”
“You know what? I’m glad you’re leaving, I’ve always hated having to look into those green eyes of yours and be reminded of her,” he shook his head, as if he was trying to shake off the memory of Mary. “Get out then, leave!” he shoved Dean towards the door. “Your mother wouldn’t have wanted to see you to grow up to be so
While she speaks, Dean scans the room, and then everyone’s face; there is recognition for Sam and Bobby, but none for Cas.
“So Dean,” Bobby looked at him, eyes a little glazed from the whisky and full of an unabashed pride Dean never believed he deserved. “What’s next?”
“Speaking of, where’re you headed after this? I’d love to keep coming back to you.”
“So maybe we can schedule an assisted shower later,” Dean winks, causing Cas to cover his face with his hands.
One date in particular, they went to the Paris hotel for dinner and Cas insisted on taking the elevator to the top of the Eiffel tower. When they got to the top and looked out through the caged windows at the bright lights of the flashy hotels, the wind whipped all around them. Castiel was in such awe that he didn’t even notice when Dean draped his jacket over his shoulders.
Dean laughed happily, “I wouldn’t dream of it, man.”
Dean was sixteen and ran away to Vegas for the weekend. He grew up about thirty
But Dean supported him always, through it all.
“I thought you were supposed to get ice cream when you’re sick, not hippie food,” Dean complained, playing with the squishy oatmeal.
“More like dazed and exhausted,” Cas replied.
Make no mistake. Another person, regardless of their love for you or relationship with you, cannot make all of your pain disappear. One person’s love does not erase another’s pain, they can just make it easier to bear. Cas survived his morning panic attacks, and made it through every hour by himself before and after being with Dean. Another person can help you with your demons, but only you can save yourself.
he rolled his eyes.
“Are you this interested in all your clients?” Cas asked with a smile.
“Two of my bunkmates aren’t taking well to the bad weather, they thought it would be entertaining to see what would happen if you push a weak swimmer in the lake during a storm,” he explained, exasperated but not overly upset.
“Jo still hasn’t given you her number yet? I thought you said you were made for each other.”
*		*		*		*		*		*
“Well not yet, but eventually,” he shoved Dean’s shoulder playfully. “You’re going to love it, there. I promise to take you to our sculpture.”
“Charlie, you’re my hero,” Cas thanked, sipping gratefully.
They had just began suggesting times to meet when they heard Charlie cheering and jumping up and down with glee from the overhang of the second floor,
“I know you don’t want to spend the rest of your life with some loser who barely graduated high school, but that doesn’t mean I want to uproot my life and make all these changes,” Dean stood up and began to pace, working himself up with fear and anger.
“Oh no, I’m all set, just returning a book, and then I’m on my way out,” he explained, setting it on the counter.
“It’s ok, Dean, I’m fine. I’m sorry for running into your cabin like this,” Cas glanced at him apologetically. “Thank you for helping me, but I’d rather not make this into a big deal,” he practically pleaded.
“Morbing, Andgel” Dean croaked with his stuffed nose, “Sorry you had to sleep on the couch again.”
decorated in calming blacks and grays, barstools surrounded the counter by the work stations
"Thanks for again dinner Cas, I had a really great time."
Dean woke up in a strange state. He was pinned underneath Cas, which wasn’t too different from every other morning, but he wasn’t spread out on their bed, he was cramped up between the arms of the sofa, neck stuck in a very stiff position. The title menu of the movie they were watching the night before was glowing on the TV screen, and a half empty bowl of popcorn was on the floor by their feet.
“I may have gotten very drunk last night,” he blushed guiltily, "it was my brother Gabriel’s idea."
He then looks to Sam again, “I’m not dating anyone, am I?”
Cas didn’t realize how starving he was until he sat down in front of Dean’s famous hamburgers. He barely had time to admire the culinary artwork in front of him before he dug right in, the sweet and savory tastes overcoming him.
“Well I was gonna let you do the tattooing today Jo, but I figured we wouldn’t wanna get
“Hello Dean,” Cas greeted, giving his first genuine smile of the evening.
away with his poor excuse for a fake ID. Until eventually, after his third attempt, he tried one
Opening the cupboard, Cas reached for the unfamiliar box of tea, “Extra strong caffeinated Honeybee tea,” he read.
When it came to the end of the summer, it seemed much harder to say goodbye than the year before.
Cas’ absolute favorite thing to do after sex was trace Dean’s tattoos. He loved being able to explore Dean’s body so intimately, and feel the smooth skin along Dean’s body under his long fingers. On top of his tattoos being amazingly beautiful pieces of art, they also told Cas so much about him. One by one he would run his fingers along the colors, shades and dark lines of each tattoo and ask Dean what they mean and why he got them. Some of them were very personal, like the one on his right shoulder that covered the scar from his Dad, which is a pastel-colored image of a boxer under a starry sky, framed in the lyrics of a Simon & Garfunkel song done in black script, ‘In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade, and he carries the reminder of every glove that laid him down and cut him ‘til he cried out, in his anger and his shame, “I am leaving, I am leaving! But the fighter still remains”’ Or the words ‘I love you’ written on his chest, over his heart in his mother’s handwriting from an old birthday card. Some are just small reminders to himself, like ‘We are not our failures’ written on his forearm right underneath his bicep, to remind him that not everything that has gone wrong in his life was because of him. Others are just expressing Dean’s passions, like the large tattoo needle covering his ribs on his left side, a big colorful piece done by Bobby that took hours and elicited lot of whining from him. Or the four symbols from the Led Zeppelin IV album cover that ran down his spine. Cas didn’t have a favorite, he was enthralled with each and every one of them for different reasons. But coupled with the sweet feeling of afterglow, he couldn’t help but marvel at Dean and how much he felt for him, as he sighed contentedly as Cas kissed and ravished his body art.
Cas laughed at her exasperation, “Can I get you something, Dean?”
“Hey man, can you hear me?” Dean asked, voice stronger than he felt.
“Well, anything tastes good when you’re starving,” Dean laughed as Cas enthusiastically chewed the masterpiece.
Bobby listened, sympathizing and asking questions now and again.
Charlie was surprisingly quiet, “Alastair is such a douche.” She shook her head, “I don’t know if Dean would want you to know, but I think you deserve some context. When Dean was little both of his parents died in a house fire, and now he lives with his Uncle and little brother. Dean got a lot of scholarships to come here, but he commutes and works at his Uncle’s Garage so that his little brother can go away to school.”
Benny and Garth had made their way to the rec room in the main building, where they’d been playing board games, but Dean was sick of them after hours of Candyland the day before. His friends Charlie and Jo were hitting up the craft room, making lanyards and cootie catchers, but Dean lacked the patience and finesse for arts and crafts. So he was reduced to hanging out all day and waiting for the evening movie, praying that it was something other than The Parent Trap, which for some reason seemed to be the only movie they kept on hand.
“Hmm,” Dean smiled to himself. “How do you feel about naked yoga? I hear there are many health benefits.”
“That’s awful,” Cas’ heart ached for Dean. If his Uncle lost his garage, Dean may not be able to finish his degree, or be able to afford to send his brother to school. He may not even be able to live with his Uncle at all if they couldn’t get another job. “Alastair really is a douche.”
Cas rolled his eyes, “I don’t know what you’re referring to.”
So far, camp had been a blast. This was his second year so he had a few returning friends, Benny and Garth, who shared a cabin with him. They had spent the last week catching up and enjoying the great outdoors. But a huge summer storm had kept them stuck indoors both yesterday and today, keeping Dean in a slump of boredom and heat.
“Morning, Angel.”
Dean sits up, but looks incredibly anxious, “Where is he? Where’s the Angel?” he asks, clearly worried. “He said he would stay, why didn’t he stay?”
pleaded. Bobby looked at him for a long minute, then to the fading bruises on his cheekbone.
*		*		*		*		*		*
Cas’ eyes widened, but he answered, “Not recently, no.”
Cas smiled appreciatively, “Thank you. I didn’t get your name?”
Dean called for his attention, "Hey! Don't worry kid, I've got you. Everything's gonna be alright." After getting him to calm down enough to take the raft, Dean secured him in, and swam them both back to the safety of the shore. He carried Lucas out in his arms, to a round of applause from the impromptu audience, and laid Lucas down. Another lifeguard, Dean’s friend Jo wrapped him in a towel and Andrea immediately took him into her arms. After getting him checked out by some medics, he seemed to be ok and hadn't swallowed too much water. Dean was so relieved that everything had turned out alright, and he had got the kid back to shore before he was swept up into the riptide. Andrea was so incredibly grateful she was in tears. That was Dean’s proudest day of being a lifeguard.
Dean liked him a lot, he was a nice kid who was eager to learn, and he reminded Dean of
“But he didn’t show up!” Cas declared. “You don’t think he’s dead, do you?
“Ok,” he says quietly, his voice rough. “The nurse said I got my appendix out,” he states, looking to them for confirmation.
“And last night?” Dean asked, taking Cas’ temperature.
“Oh yeah? And what if I do go with you? What am I supposed to do when you leave for France or Pakistan or wherever you want to teach? Follow you there too? I’m not going to follow you around for the rest of your life, holding you back!” His voice wavered, and Dean looked away as Cas’ blue eyes filled with tears.
Dean immediately began to stutter out an apology, snapping up his gaze to meet a beautiful man with bright blue eyes and a shock of dark hair. “I’m so sorry man, I wasn’t looking where I was going,” he cringed, desperately trying not to draw attention to himself.
Thank you so much for reading! This is the end! I hope you enjoyed! <3
Two days later, Dean was at work again, when he saw someone making their way slowly up the beach around 8. He squinted at the figure from afar, but he couldn’t tell who it was, but they were moving too slow to be Cas on his morning jog. Dean sighed slightly in disappointment, and decided that maybe he should rest his eyes before the morning crowd showed up. Next thing he knew, he heard a deep sexy voice calling his name.
Cas gives a meaningful look to Dean when he says that, holding his gaze long enough to get the message through, before quickly giving a polite nod at Sam.
“I’m fine with this”, Cas nods at the luckily silent monitor.
Dean’s been wanting to use the grill in the backyard, but it seems a bit too much to cook with that if it’s only him and Jack eating. That’s his excuse of wanting to throw a party for Cas.
He’s probably just the right amount of too drunk, or it’s the fact that Cas is on top of him, kissing him like his life depends on it, but for some reason Dean’s having real troubles working his fingers on the buttons, and his frustration is boiling over.
“You’ll ruin it!” Dean holds the knife out as an example, “You were gonna cut the meat with this? No.”
“I don’t know”, Dean shrugs, chewing his bottom lip a bit. He thinks of his past relationships, most of them short and kept casual, but even with the longer ones he never really thought about it, coming here. He’s here usually on holidays, a few times a year and usually, if there was someone in his life at one of those times, they had other plans, probably.
, she says,
Cas can hear Dean’s happy and loud
Mick smiles at him, “I’m happy to hear that. I heard you’re quite a leader.”
Cas does as he’s told, and Dean can feel the content smile on his lips when they move against his again. Another chuckle slipping out of his mouth gives Cas a better access there, and the kisses take a more heated turn. Dean brings his hands to Cas’s back, grabbing the fabric of his shirt and pulling it from his jeans.
It’s no surprise Dean’s been here, Kelly was his best friend too.
. There's stuff they obviously need to talk more about, but that's for later, for now this feels like enough talking.
His smile turns into a teasing one, when he realizes why Cas probably suggested this in the first place.
Hangovers definitely get worse when you’re closer to thirty than twenty.
When he’s done, he takes them both and proudly hands one of them to Dean.
When he turns to leave again, Cas doesn’t stop him no matter how badly he would want to.
Cas has turned his phone on silent when he left home, but he checks it twice to see if Dean’s tried to call him.
Cas has no idea what the hell he’s talking about, because he
“You know, after we wake up together”, he clarifies, clearing his throat, “from, going to the same bed together the night before?”
Sam greets him,
The bedroom is already dark, when he comes back, closing the door behind him as quietly as he could. Cas is already under the covers, breathing steadily. Dean slides under one of the blankets, careful to leave some space between them, what little is possible to leave anyway. Judged from the steady breaths Cas is already asleep, the sleepy son of a bitch, and listening to that, Dean suddenly feels the long drive weighing his body and he falls asleep surprisingly fast as well.
“And could you make sure she has the blue dress on?” he mutters, embarrassed but left with no other choice, “It’s not gonna be Rebecca Rabbit for my kid if you don’t go into detail.”
“What the fuck was that?” he growls quietly, glaring at Dean.
“Okay, I have one now. Never have I ever… Passed out, naked, I might add, with a guy, to my friend’s bathroom, making the said friend think I
Dean feels his cheeks burning and he can’t blame the sun anymore, because Novak’s an idiot who uses words like enjoyable.
He is, even with his crazy work hours. He’s amazing with Jack, patient and always interested in whatever Jack’s going on about, Dean can’t understand how he does it. And
“Your turn to try”, he grunts to Cas on his way out.
Now, he’s holding a takeaway cup of coffee, his ass down on the edge of a sand box as he and Charlie are watching Jack push the sand around with his new truck.
“The point is to see how much sugar you can eat before your stomach hurts”, Dean explains, giving Cas a serious look, before he peeks into the strollers, “You want some pastries, kid?”
Dean buys them both, just to get them out of the store.
Cas walks past Jack to the coffee machine, silently grabbing a mug and pouring himself a big cup of coffee, even if it feels like the first morning in a long time he doesn’t actually need it that much.
. Cas doesn’t seem to notice how embarrassing his words were, though.
“Anyway”, he says, waving his hand goodbye to Cas.
, Sam says.
“Apologies”, Cas sighs, “Got lost in my head for a moment.”
Benny has a slightly amused look on his face when he sips his beer. “The mother hen in you must enjoy all this.”
“Being a godparent is literally just being fun”, he says back, scoffing, “Would it kill you to chill for once in your life?”
He doesn’t.
“How about I sing it some other night, okay?” Dean negotiates, rubbing the back of his neck.
“So, we add ice cream to the grocery list and we’re good?” Dean concludes.
“Hey, you’re not having your
Cas turns to look at Dean, “I want—”
“Goldilocks tasted
“It is in the morally gray area if your actions kill people”, Cas says, and Dean can’t hold in a groan. Somehow, he’s not surprised Cas is the type to start a philosophical conversation with an evil witch, but he’s already tied down and about to die, he doesn’t want to spend his last moments hearing Cas’s arguments.
He has no idea what the fuck he’s supposed to say, so he doesn’t say anything.
He checks that Jack’s still sound asleep before heading back to the kitchen. Dean stays silent for an hour like he promised, but Cas still has problems focusing on his work.
Dean finds himself at the entrance of the nearby park that has a little playground, framed with fences and a gate. He hesitates for a moment, seeing that the bench is already taken with strollers parked next to it, and that there's three mothers around the outdoor table.
(See the end of the chapter for
The kid’s whole face lights up with a smile, “I’m very important”, he states contently, with his almost-four-year-old’s confidence, and it gets a chuckle out of Dean.
Jack just shakes his head no, overgrown hair bouncing from side to side.
Dean nods towards the empty backyard in front of them, “For Jack. Would be better than the sad, empty yard he has now.”
Cas doesn’t look weirded out, though. If anything, he looks hopeful.
Cas steps under the shower when the water is hot enough.
The muscles on Dean’s throat move as he swallows. He licks his lips, and Cas shoots his gaze back up to meet his eyes instead, trying to shake the thought of kissing the other man from his mind, but looking into the green sea, he almost leans forward.
Dean’s phone makes a sound and he checks the message he got, “Bobby needs me at the garage. Is it okay if I go?”
Yes reason, the possibility for Cas to be there tomorrow is high, since they both are there usually on Thursdays around six.
“Like I hated it?” Dean cuts him off again, an unbelieving look on his face, “Cas I didn’t—”
“Sorry, didn’t mean to interrupt, you can stay”, he grunts, but before he can open the door, Meg’s there, taking his hand off the handle.
Cas frowns at him as he inhales more smoke. “Why would you think I’m perfect?”
“I look ridiculous”, he claims, while he
“What?”
Meg puts her wine glass back on the table before leaning over towards Cas, “Exactly.”
“I don't know!" Dean bursts out.
“Sure, I’ll just go change real quick”, he agrees before heading towards his bedroom. He changes from his bar outfit to a comfier one, a pair of college pants and the t-shirt he was wearing earlier, abandoned on the bed.
Dean shoots him a clearly fake smile from the bed. “You’re the one who suggested we work together in the first place, Cas.”
She won’t give in, “But what if he–”
Cas bites down a smile, giving Dean a funny look, “I’m sorry, is there a wedding happening where I possibly could do that?”
He’s about to take Jack back to the bedroom, when he hears the soft rumble of a car engine as someone pulls up their driveway.
His mouth is dry, the taste of everything he drank last night as a disgusting mix on his tongue when he slowly takes in the hangover. He feels horrible, but it’s been a while since he’s been that drunk, so he shouldn’t be surprised.
Dean’s not the only one who trusts Jody surprisingly fast, because Jack actually agrees and starts shoveling.
So, he’s annoyed every time he looks at Cas’s name at the Friday night section of the board.
The drive from Sam’s apartment to Charlie’s is short, so it doesn’t take them long to arrive at the party. Cas is about to get out of the car, but Dean stops him before he does, reaching to grab something from the backseat, handing it to Cas.
“I have the paper saved from last time, thanks”, Sam says, when Dean hands him a new one.
