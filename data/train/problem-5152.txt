Steve gives a slight shake of his head.  “Remember how I said I spend a lot of time looking at pictures and videos of you?  For work.  As part of my job,” he clarifies.
“You know you love me,” Tony’s voice echoes loudly from nowhere.  “It.  You love it.  When I’m an ass.”
“He’s out in the shed,” Bucky adds to Tony as he steps past, giving Tony a nudge toward the back door with a smirk.
“One more thing before you hang up,” Clint interjects. “Tony? We’re gonna need new digs in the next day or two, if you think you can manage it.”
“Good,” Howard says. “I don’t understand why you keep getting yourself into these situations, Tony. You could be the greatest player the game has ever seen. Do you understand that? Can you get it through your thick head what kind of responsibility that is? To our name? To our legacy?”
It seems to catch Tony off guard.  Steve’s pleased when Tony actually takes some time to think about his response.  Like he’s really giving it some thought.
He holds his taco toward Tony, and Tony takes a bite, because Bruce is right and also the trunk taco was (and still is) fantastic.
“I’m sure Howard paid quite a bit for some of it,” Steve says,  “I’ve got all kinds of back pay so I can write you a check.  And if you have an agreement with the Smithsonian maybe we can work something out to keep some of it on display.”
Tony can’t help the skepticism he knows is written all over his face.  “The old Barnes, sure.  The only thing that’s going to give the Winter Soldier any pause is whether to shoot you in the chest or the back.”
“Don’t encourage this,” James says, fixing Bruce with a look that only conveys the littlest bit of murder. “It smells like burning.”
Tony narrows his eyes at him.   “I just want to know why you’re doing this so I can stop thinking about it, okay?  I don’t like not knowing things.”
Steve’s grinning at him, and Tony takes a deep breath, and despite all the signals that Steve’s interested, he prepares himself for possible rejection.
It’s adorable. Tony wants to kiss his face forever. Just as soon as Steve’s back to only having one face. And maybe things aren’t so spinny.
“No. Not really,” Bruce says. “I don’t know what I’m doing," he adds, since he feels like Clint needs to understand that. "A real therapist would have seen the size of the trigger coming toward James, and stepped in. Redirected. Something.”
Steve’s found that one of the easiest ways to keep up with the modern world is to watch the morning talk shows on the television.  He’s already awake when they’re on, and most days he’s run, showered and dressed before they start.  So once he’s finished with his pre-dawn routine he sits in his apartment with a cup of coffee and a bagel and lets the television provide background noise as he reads the The Daily Bugle.
“Because for all I know, the two of you have decided to kidnap us and bury us in the woods.  I don’t like not knowing where I’m going.”
“He is,” Tony says. “No clue why he’d wanna hang around with me, but I guess stranger things have happened.”
“Are they ceramic?” Bucky asks.  “Because Hammertech may be behind in the weapons market but their security is a-okay.  Looks like Stane’s been hired as the head of it, and every access point to the farm has got a hair-trigger metal-detecting grid on it.”
“Took me a while to get used to the height,” Steve admits.  “I couldn’t stop tripping over my own feet that summer.  Bucky hated it.  Kept saying he was going to have to seal me in bubble wrap.”
As the night wears on the old folks show their exhaustion early. It’s barely nine when Steve walks the last of the guys from his table to the door. He’s on his way to find Tony when a young man stops him.
Bruce laughs at the ridiculousness of that statement, particularly because he knows that Clint knows a hell of a lot more about human anatomy than he lets on.
“Sorry, doc.  Didn’t want to tell you in private because if we start whispering behind James’s back it’s gonna put him on edge, and if he’s on edge, the chances of me getting stabbed go way up.”
The raw eggs show up at breakfast the next morning.  Seven of them, laid out carefully, with glitter and glue and feathers and markers.
"I'm a lot of things,” Clint begins again, “but mostly I'm the guy who’s been straight up creeping on Bruce for the last 6 weeks. Not you know... sexually. Just. Protectively.”
What had once been his best comfort only reminded him of just how lonely his world had become.  Tony hadn’t seen the quilt again until after Afghanistan.  It had come back to him in a box, from Rhodey’s mom, sent along with a tupperware bowl full of her chocolate chip cookies and a note that read
Steve shrugs. “That’s what he said. She plays for one of the traveling teams around here. The Wildcats. Apparently she’s pretty good.”
“I got sick of waiting and let myself into the surgery records,” Tony says, turning his wrist display toward Bruce.  “Here.  You probably know what this doctor talk means better than I do.”
“He’s got eighty-six biographies in print,” the soldier says. His focus is entirely on his food as he takes small bite after small bite.
He walks inside as reverently as if it was the Tardis.  The room isn’t bright or gleaming or teched out, but it’s clean and well-organized and full of both useful looking weapons and displayed antiques and geeeeeeezus...
Steve gets one look at Tony’s serious expression and laughs.  “Wow.  Didn’t realize you had a high school kink.  Are you the teacher here?  Or the smart kid and I’m the football star?”
For the most part every day on GMNY is the same.  There’s a cooking segment (Steve learns to make polenta and prepare kale this way), they talk about the weather, there’s some bizarre fashion trend to discuss, a weight loss segment, and then the hosts end the show with celebrity gossip.  The gossip is usually where Steve starts to tune it out, but when they announce they’ve got Tony Stark’s most recent ex-girlfriend coming up next, he puts down the paper to watch.
They’re somewhere over Ohio when Tony starts to stir.  He’s not exactly awake as he struggles against the covers.
“Well-- it’d be uncomfortable,” Steve begins.  These are explanations that don’t come easily to him.  He doesn’t like to complain.  Doesn’t like for other people to notice his pain.  He spent long enough under medical scrutiny as a kid to resent it as an adult.  “Healing wears me out so I need more rest. I need more food, too. That’s about it.”
He tries to paste on a less miserable expression as he walks the halls.  Tony shouldn’t have to deal with Steve’s issues, and if Steve was a stronger person-- if Steve was Captain America all the time-- Tony wouldn’t have to.  But Captain America is a fiction, and Steve is stuck in this shitty reality where Bucky is alive and wants nothing to do with him, so when he does find Tony out on the roof, he knows that not one thing about him looks enthusiastic to be there.
“Maybe no one ever asked you about your pain,” Bruce says. “Or asked about your body apart from malfunctions. Other people's disregard for your comfort doesn’t invalidate that your body is your own.”
“You’re trying to control me and I don’t have time for yet another pointless conversation with an overdramatic asshole,” Jonathan says.  “I’m sick of you turning every date into an argument.  Give me the keys.”
Steve laughs. “He’ll love that, I’m sure. It’s too bad I don’t just carry them on me. He was seeing her this afternoon.”
“I’m already up to my eyeballs in this, Banner, and I’m offering my help.  Email JARVIS what it’ll take to scan Barnes’ injuries.  Try and get some scans of his arm while you’re at it. Robocop might have trackers in there or a kill switch.”
He smirks down at the screen as Tony explains in great detail how terribly, horrendously boring Orlando is while sober.
“Prince Charming?” Steve asks. “I’m old enough to be that kid’s great-grandfather. In another life I could have
He looks down at the scanner. Whatever he’s weighing in his mind, it must end up in favor of trust, because he picks it up and leans down slightly to begin the scan of his knee.
“Dude,” Clint says, with a sort of disarming, midwestern charm that Clint manages to make seem natural. “I’m not bragging when I say I’m one of the best and you just got the drop on me out of that bath like it was nothing. We aren’t keeping you here. I’m not, because I know it’d be pointless, and Bruce won’t, because he’s as decent as they get. If you want to go, we wouldn’t stop you, even if we could.”
A moment later Tony’s lab appears as a projection on the bedroom wall. Steve is visible in the background, looking intently at a paper file on a desk.
Bruce nods, shakily, and moves forward. He glances at Clint who waves him off with his working hand.
Tony sits on the edge of Natasha’s bed and she says something to him Steve can’t hear.  Tony takes off one of the gauntlets and Natasha reaches for his hand.  Her eyes are serious but soft.  Tony nods then leans down so she can kiss his cheek.
“I like to live dangerously,” Clint says with a bright smile.  “So yeah-- sign me up for being your friend, too.  If you wouldn’t mind.”
Bucky runs a hand through Clint's hair to muss it up, and then leans down to kiss him on top of the head.  Right.  So being a brat before.
Bruce gets that.  He’s still not enamored with the method. “Before his next ‘dose’ let me take a look at the bullets. I’ll figure it out.”
“They’re both alive,” Steve assures him.  “The hospital staff promised they’d come get us the moment either of them are out of surgery.”
“You-- you know you don’t have to do this, right?” Tony asks.  “Not for the raise or for your job or for any of it?”
“Bruce... keep me updated?” Steve asks. His voice sounds a little more polished. He's trying harder to keep it together now.
“Ice. Right,” Bruce says, after a beat. “I’m sorry. That was... not a helpful thing to suggest. What about soaking in a warm bath? That can loosen up the muscles a little so it won’t hurt as much if I need to reposition your knee.”
James wakes up at Clint's Secret Farm, and the gang is all now on the same continent. It's about time.
“We need to celebrate with a hundred shot salute tonight at the bar!” Clint insists. “There’s what... 8 of us? Divided by... 100 drinks. So everyone gets... fucking morning math,” he whines. “Hurts my head.”
He’s a grown man. It doesn’t have to be like this. He can tell Howard to fuck off and he can apologize to Steve and maybe it’s not too late. Maybe.
“Oh right,” Tony says. He rolls himself back under the car. “Your foray into the Hammer Industries Server Farm. Seriously, Steve? Making Jarvis your criminal accomplice? That’s so 2001.”
Steve has had weeks now to sort this out.  To make sure he isn’t putting himself in a position of accepting the exact sort of abuse from Tony that Steve has watched Tony suffer through himself.  It doesn’t feel like that.
Steve can’t stop himself from smiling. Sure, Bucky would defend him to the death but this is the first time an almost stranger has stood up for him.
He dabs at the stain with his tie and then looks up at Tony again, finally recognizing the man behind him and practically jumps out of his chair.
Dr. Wilkes is in his late thirties or early forties and every word he says for a full two hours goes straight over Steve’s head. He might as well be speaking Martian. Bruce’s face is full of wonder. Tony’s sitting on the edge of his seat, tapping rapid notes into his StarkPad without ever looking down at it, because he can’t take his eyes off the man at the podium. Steve’s not sure Tony’s ever looked at him like that.
“I don’t think it’s stupid,” Steve says. “I think I’ll probably mangle it, and pick all the wrong words and it’s not going to be smooth but I’ll try. Whatever it takes.”
Which sounds like a no, but then panels in the wall light up with a blue glow that flash in a pattern Steve takes as direction.  He follows them up the stairs, and then down a clear-plated hallway lined with two levels of labs.  Steve sees Dr. Banner below, but Bruce seems thoroughly engaged in his work and Steve doesn’t want to bother him.  The lights that are showing him the way end at door that’s up one more set of stairs.
Fucking StarkTech. Next time he’s buying a HammerPhone for the satisfying crunch it’ll make when it hits a goddamn wall.
Someone from his own team fires a puck at him and Steve’s hand shoots out and snatches it out of the air like it’s nothing. He swats it to the ground and Clint comes skating toward him like a madman.
“The distraction will be the easy part,” Bucky says as he looks around the table.  “None of the us are getting into that server farm undetected.  We all look like some version of trouble.”
“Didn’t do it for you, Cap,” Clint says.  “I’m not ready to kiss and make up, but I’m less pissed than I was.  Tony wrote me a letter.  I know he’s sorry.”
“How do you like the house?” Tony answers, sounding enthusiastic and entirely unburdened. So Steve hadn’t found him yet thank god.  Tony’s cheer is surreal in the moment.
“That’d be great,” Steve enthuses.  “It’s been so long since I felt like I knew what to do with myself. Thanks."  Steve pauses, then adds "If I keep thanking you for all this help, is it going to get annoying?”
They’ve both still got paint in their hair when they collapse into the booth across from Bruce at their favorite diner.
“Please, for the love of all that is holy, stop trying to push me away and just tell me what you want,” Steve says. “I know what I want. I know what I think you want. But I need words. Real words. Actual communication.”
Now it’s Tony’s turn to look incredibly dazzled.  He runs his hand through Steve’s hair then gives him a nudge away.
“I have some kinds of permission here, right?” Steve asks.  His voice sounds rough, either from the late hour or from trying to rein in his temper.  “Pepper explained them to me once.  I’m an admin or something.  A super user?”
“Something along the lines of a badly broken bone,” Bruce says.  “Can you tell me what that might feel like for you?”
Tony leads Steve through the house to the game room, where he has a whole wall of classic hockey memorabilia. His collection rivals what’s displayed in the Hockey Hall of Fame, only Tony’s is better, because almost everything is signed to him. He’d started collecting back when he was a kid and his dad was the best hockey player America had ever seen. And now Barnes’s puck is going front and center.
“He’s kidding-- about the interrupting,” Bruce tries to help, since James is eyeing the wall with a peculiar stare. Though it only takes Bruce a second to realize James isn’t looking at Tony at all.
Steve looks up.  They’re the last two in the tower conference room.  Tony’s been tapping on his phone for the last hour, and it only now occurs to Steve that by this point in the evening he’s usually in here alone.
Tony looks at Steve, who flips off his friends.  Bucky and Clint make a quick retreat, arms around each other as they let the door slam behind them.
He tries to talk to Tony again, just to make sure everything is okay.  Tony fakes a call from Pepper.  The phone doesn’t even ring or vibrate and Steve’s superior hearing means he damn sure knows there’s no one else on the line. Tony holds up a finger to Steve like he’s telling Steve he can’t continue their conversation and walks away.
“These server towers are all self-contained,” Bucky says.  He sends new info to Tony’s screen.  “Even if one of us could get inside it’d take at least an hour to copy them all.  Depending on accessibility, maybe even longer.”
“You know Bucky and Bruce,” Clint starts, once they’re all within talking distance.  “And this is Nat, Sam, Kate and Steve,” Clint introduces.  “Guys-- this is Tony freaking Stark.”
“Story time,” Clint declares.  “The first time I met Steve I’d just spent the better part of a day trying to kill him.”
It’s fine.  It’s not pathological.  Even when he’s pretending he doesn’t know these things, it’s acknowledged he’s the smartest guy in the room.  There’s an equilibrium.
Then Steve switched to staring at something else and eventually Tony needed to know.  If he knew, he could help.  So he’d looked again, felt physically ill after reading one paragraph about Barnes’s extracurricular HYDRA uses and sworn off spying yet again.
“I was,” Steve lies.  “You’re a terrible influence.” He doesn’t mean for it to happen but his voice goes a little soft.  A little extra fond.  He reaches over and rubs his fingers over the top of Tony’s hand.  “And I wouldn’t have you any other way.”
They have done lots of this slow-paced affectionate touching.  It feels different, somehow, out in the real world.  At the clinic, sex was not something that was going to happen.  There were security cameras in the bedroom, and while they’d been assured they did not transmit sound (Tony had done a little poking around to make absolutely sure that was true) they were still being broadcasting via visual feed to the front desk.
Tony nods.  “Ohhhhh.  Right.  In that case, do you want to come up to my office?  We can just... hang out.  As friends.”
He turns away entirely, but that only manages to reveal his back, which is worse than what Steve had already seen.  The bruises are darker there, and there are more of them.  Other injuries, too.  Belt marks.  Cigarette burns.  What the actual fuck?
“The little one’s the scanner and the long thing is gonna put up a hologram,” James explains, looking up from the paper.  “The one in the middle is a transmitter.”
Tony’s words are a lifeline.  They wrap around you and make you feel safe and calm, because if the smartest guy in the room’s not worried-- you’ve got nothing to worry about either.
“We don’t even have a chair like the kind you mean,” Clint says.  “That’s a chair that assholes use and we aren’t assholes.  Most of the time.  And never like that.  We aren’t here to hurt you.”
They greet Steve politely.  The glances they keep giving each other as Steve hugs Pepper seem ominous.
“They were having some mafia trouble when we started coming here,” Steve says.  “Some punks in tracksuits trying to extort money off of the elderly owners.  Natasha and Clint took care of it.  Now it’s Free Fry Fridays.”
It’s actually kind of anticlimactic once they arrive for lunch. The people who know Steve greet him by name. The people who don’t, ignore them. God bless true New Yorkers.
is uncomfortable when he’s hurt,” James says sharply.  He sounds pissed.  Familiar.  Spot on to the Bucky that Steve knew.  “I want to know what Steve Rogers has to say.”
“No,” Tony says immediately.  He’s not letting an 80 year old woman risk her life for him.  He’s surprised when the rest of the table seems to be considering it.
Steve shoves back hard from the table and glares at Tony, which, believe it or not, is a vast improvement over the desolate nothingness that Steve’s stare is most days when Tony checks in on him over the video feed. The life in Steve's eyes only lasts a few seconds and then he breathes out slowly before stuffing the rest of the BannerBar in his mouth.
“I did,” Steve agrees.  “I don’t know how he was later in life, but when I knew him he was loyal, brave, a total smart ass, and he never treated me like some kind of national treasure.  Exactly the kind of person I wanted to be around.
“We aren’t mad at you,” Clint says, with more warmth in his voice than fear. “You have to keep yourself safe, right?  So hold on to those scissors for me. You can keep them.”
See, the blanket wrapped around him isn’t just any blanket.  It’s the blanket Ana Jarvis had made for him when he was five years old, to keep Tony from sneaking into her and Mr. Jarvis’s room to steal the quilt off their bed.  It was warm, and soft and it smelled like Ana’s perfume.
“James is awake and would like to see you. He can have some difficulty making requests so if he gives a nod in my direction you’ll need to go. Does that work for you?”
“You’re right,” Steve says. “It’s your fault you aren’t on the team. Operation Scorch-The-Earth worked great and everyone was pissed at you and even though things are mostly better now they still aren’t back to normal. That’s on you. That’s your fault.”
“I like what you’ve done with the place,” Steve says.  It’s a little modern for his tastes but it suits Tony.
Nanna gives Steve’s elbow a squeeze as they pass her in the kitchen.  Bucky and Clint are both still hard at work at the table and don’t even bother to look up from their keyboards.
“Loves me,” Bruce interrupts. He runs his thumb over the envelope absently. “You don’t have to say it for him because he says it in here. That he loves me, and he’s sorry and that I deserved better from him.”
“Not this minute, I don’t,” Tony says.  “James is going to need a couple of serious surgeries to remove the internal components that are in there before I can go attaching anything.  It’s important-- but it can wait.”
“Clint means well,” Tony says, looking up from his work for the first time since he’s been on screen. “I’m hit or miss. J, move me to the big screen?”
“They understand that you have a messiah complex the size of Brooklyn and won’t give me up no matter what they say,” Tony says.  “It’d be a waste of air and logic.  And hey-- I’m not complaining.  It means you’re here.”
“I’m not asking you not to go,” Tony says.  “I’m just asking if you’ll be back here sometime tonight or if we’re going to meet back at the tower.”
Steve walks around the lab like it’s Disneyland.  He gets down on his knees to meet U and Dum-E so he can speak to them on their level.  And when he does speak, he talks to them like they’re special.  He says it’s nice to meet them and reaches out a careful hand to touch them reverently.
“I don’t want to put him in the position of keeping a secret from Steve, so no, I don’t plan to tell him either.  At least not until you’re comfortable with Steve knowing where you are.  I can handle disappointing Captain America.”
“Warm, but probably not hot, if you can tolerate that?” Bruce suggests.  “And if you would like any of those clean clothes to change into after, grab whatever looks good to you. There’s plenty for us both.”
Content Warning: There is a one line reference to past child abuse.  It's within Tony's list of reasons he's visited the burger place for comfort food.
“I don't know what to do with him,” Pepper sighs.  “I love him.  I spend a lot of time wanting to smack him upside the head but I love him.”
A few additional friends have been added to the table for the night.  Rhodey, Pepper and Nanna meet up with the gang after work, and have all agreed to join in Clint’s quest for a record breaking Fry Platter night.  They’re on number 5 when Steve leans over to Tony.
“What’s wrong?” he asks, more awake when he gets a good look at her stony expression.  That’s Nat’s Serious Business face.
“Well, I’d invite you to sit on the bed and tell me all about it, but we’ve already established that’s gonna end with an ass full of splinters, so how about the floor?  I want to hear.  Whatever you’re willing to tell.”
“Just be glad you aren’t getting Bucky’s hangover cure,” Sam says. “That’s a big glass of orange juice with a raw egg mixed in. It’s wrong, man. So wrong.”
Steve nods. “Then I think we’re good here. I know a lot of you will have questions. If you put them in the comments, we’ll have a friend sift through them for us, and answer what we can. Thank you for watching. Have a good day.”
Steve is such a giant fail at this. It’s not even the talking about the sex part, because he can talk about sex fine in other circumstances. It’s the part where it’s his thoughts and feelings and they all seem one way in his head and then the minute he’s around Tony it all turns to mush.
Steve grabs Tony’s hand and threads their fingers together to pull him toward the stairs before Nanna can say any more.  Which is kind of a shame.  Tony can't say he'd ever get tired of watching Bucky get outplayed by his grandma.
Tony unwraps himself and takes one last drink of his coffee before standing.  He picks up the blanket and carries it with him to his room, draping it over the edge of his bed carefully.  He runs his hand over the soft edge and then sits.
Pepper’s smile reassures him he hasn’t done anything wrong. “Rhodey and I spent hours strategizing how to get you two together one afternoon. I couldn’t be happier for you.”
Tony considers it.  “I think the AI Jarvis is more a mix of me and Mr. Jarvis.  That’s why I gave him an accent, though.  It didn’t seem right for him to have the name and then sound American.  Jarvis would have hated that.”
Clint and Natasha fix him with identical looks of pity.  Clint speaks his next words slowly, like Steve’s the Kindergarten glue-eater.
“There’s a lot to this,” Steve says.  “And if... if it’s too much, that’s okay.  I don’t expect...”  Steve swallows.  “I just wanted a little more time before we had this conversation.”
“That’s not it,” Clint argues.  “I’ve never been good at the indoors or talking about my feelings.  I’ll be back in an hour or so.”
“I think Tony’s going to have ideas for improvements,” Bruce says. “I think he’ll have sketches and probably a dozen working models within a week, and at least one of them is going to be moderately offensive in that it will be painted to match Steve’s shield or be decorated with little Bucky Bears. But he won’t force the issue. He may create things outside your permission, but he would never experiment on you without your expressed, non-coerced consent. I know he won’t because-- and I’m not bragging here-- I am way more scientifically interesting than you. And while Tony might ask a nosey question here or there, he’s never once treated me as anything less than a person. Not ever.”
“I don’t want you to think I don’t care that he hurt you,” Steve says. It’s important to him that they believe that. “I do. I care. He was wrong.”
“If the first one’s sitting okay in your stomach, would you like another StarkBar?” Bruce asks, pulling one out for himself as well.
With that settled, they talk about other, more cheerful, things.  Artificial Intelligence mostly, since Steve has a lot of questions.
“I wasn’t worried about our reputations,” Steve says quietly. “God, Tony, I was worried about you. About that tape getting out and you having to relive someone hurting you.”
Steve laughs.  “Well, you can tell Rhodey, but sadly, it’s not true.  Just wanted to see your face when I said it.”
Tony gets it. Steve doesn’t want to get up. Doesn’t want to leave his computer for even a second in case JARVIS gets a hit, or Nat and Sam check in.
“In case you were too drunk to remember,” Pepper continues.  “The winner gets to choose where you celebrate the win and also go by “Winner” on comms for a month, if they so choose.”
"Probably better than being stuck with me," Steve says, "But here I am, if you ever want to get to know me."
When he gets back upstairs, Bucky gives him a nod of approval as Tony sits the fire extinguisher down on the table.  There’s coffee and a plate of food waiting for him at the empty seat.  Steve nudges the computer he’d been using toward Tony.
Steve’s at the tower because he’d broken the strap on his shield during the last mission and Tony had offered to fix it.  After Rhodey’s story, Steve had figured out a new way to try and get himself back in Tony’s good graces: appeal to his stomach.
They get to the rental car without incident.  Steve rented one with dark windows, so no one can see in as he pulls out of the garage and down the street.  The reporters are all out front anyway, waiting for the Tony Stark circus to begin anew.  They ignore the plain green sedan that cruises by.
“About a million things, and not a single one of them has to do with my wardrobe,” Bruce laughs.  “Let me go check on James, and then we’ll catch up.”
When he spots Tony in warmups it’s the first time he’s laid eyes on him since the weekend everything went wrong. It was one weekend. Why is he still so hung up over this?
“Done and done,” Tony says, appearing on the view screen nearest them, though he’s not looking in their direction. He’s staring intently at a holographic model of James’s arm.
“It’d be a sign of the apocalypse if you did,” Tony says.  “Next thing you’d know there’d be plagues of locust all over.”
“Negative.  Flight commands can only be issued through the physical controls on board.  They have removed remote override.”
Any reply Tony has is interrupted by a flurry of loud barks from Clint’s phone alerting him texts have come in.  Clint’s face lights up.
Steve tries to school his features and fails epicly. Tony rolls his eyes but leans in against Steve, and stays there. It’s an awkward angle until Steve puts his arm around Tony, and then they fit together just right.
“I love him like a brother,” Rhodey interjects.  “I’ve spent more than half my life cleaning up after that man’s messes.  Might as well call me Mop Man.”
“You don't mind?” Steve asks. “I was going to tell you. I just wanted to wait until I knew if Tony felt the same.”
Tony considers it.  “He wasn’t like that after you were gone.  He was cold.  Calculating.  Were you two together?”
Steve takes his own step back, out of Tony’s space.  A waitress walks toward their table and Steve raises a hand to give her a small, friendly wave away.
Steve shakes his head, hoping against hope JARVIS will take pity on him, as he follows Tony into the elevator.  Thankfully, there’s no music at all as it begins to descend.  Only the gentle hum of movement.
“Nothing to worry about,” Bruce says, since James’s forehead is wrinkled with the effort of staying calm. “This is just like out on the porch in Switzerland.”
It’s breakfast. Tony’s not terribly interested in eating but Howard’s slid a bowl of oatmeal in front of him and Tony is chewing it methodically.
“They’re based on my designs.  You don’t think everything I touch automatically gets the Stark logo on it do you?”
Tony had looked ready to get defensive.  At Steve’s words his posture relaxes slightly though the smile he gives Steve is entirely false.  Tony grabs for a bottle of the nearest alcohol and pours a shot into his smoothie.
“Earth to Rogers, come in Rogers,” Sam says, giving his friend (and more than occasional patient) an elbow. “Seriously. You look in this deep. Spill.”
“I don’t need the chair. It was not a malfunction,” James states softly. As if he knows his opinion won’t matter, but he can’t help but try. “I don’t need the chair.” His voice wobbles over the words.
"I guarantee you it's better than the initiation to join HYDRA," Clint points out. “So what’s this second suggestion of yours, anyway?”
“I can be an asshole,” Tony continues, “but I’m not the kind of asshole who’ll give you a bad arm for offing my folks. As far as I’m concerned, we’re cool. Now if Bruce will stop interrupting me, I’ve got work to do.”
“Oh, I like that,” Tony says, his smile turning wicked as he wraps an arm around Steve and tugs him toward the ramp.  “I like that a lot.”
“Nope.  A promise is a promise. I told you I’d suffocate you, and as Captain America I am honor-bound to do it.  It’s in the constitution.  It was nice knowing you.”
Steve doesn’t want to fight and by now he knows that if he pushes, Tony can push back harder.  So he decides to just ignore the request.  To focus on moving forward.  “Do you still have clothes here?”
I know that this chapter is a rough one for Steve and Tony, and I just want to reassure y'all (if you're traumatized by all the Tony or Steve hate that floats around) that I love BOTH these characters, and I will take good care of them.  So in case you read the painful parts here and are wondering if I'll trash one of your boys, I won't!
Steve’s not sure how JARVIS knows to time food delivery for a few minutes after Tony wakes up, but he’s grateful just the same.  Steve eats while Tony sips water and they watch a nature documentary on baby hippos.  It’s another quiet evening, and Steve realizes belatedly, a Sunday.  He hasn’t thought about the museum even once.
Steve explains about Clint’s rainbow glitter paintballs, and pulls out his notebook to show Tony where he’s been plotting his revenge. Skunk scented paintballs. Paintballs that look like bird poop once they’ve hit you. Paintballs that cover you in foam. Paintballs that contain a mild itching powder. There are more. Steve had spent the better part of an evening writing out ideas, and sketching himself a special paintball shield for future use.
Steve listens, and when Tony finishes he lets out a slow breath.  “I’m about to get dinner with Nat, Sam and Clint.  Come with us.”
“If we don’t, none of you fuckers are gonna rest in peace.  Your ghosts are going to wander the earth, whispering in the breeze...”  Clint’s voice drops to an overly spooky whisper.  “What wasssssss the naaaaaaaaame?  What was the nameeeeeeeee?”
“I’m done with what I can do to help,” Steve says.  “Bucky’s got this rigged so you can see everything they’re doing.  Jump in if you want.”
“I’m fine,” Bruce agrees as he closes the distance between himself and James. Probably not fine actually. Definitely not fine. But he’s not turning. James needs him. Clint needs him. Panic isn’t his trigger so much as anger, and it’s impossible to be angry with James when none of this is his fault. Bruce’s determination to stay in the moment propels him forward. He drops next to James, who is still seizing, and rolls him onto his side.
When the soldier steps fully into the barn he isn’t what Bruce was expecting. He’s limping ever so slightly. He looks miserably tired. And when he speaks his voice is scratchy and unexpectedly hesitant. Like English doesn’t come as easily as it should.
“I didn’t cheat you on you,” Tony says, as Steve hands him a towel.  Tony half-heartedly dries himself then wraps it around his waist and tucks it in. “I swear I didn’t.  There are photos.  I can explain.”
It’s hard at first.  Rhodey’s the most decent person Tony knows; that’s why he loves him.  The thought of his very best friend becoming a soulless killer is almost impossible to imagine.
“Tony will probably have us a new place before the day is out, but I think it’d be good to give James’s knee one more day to rest before we try and hike," Bruce says.  "Especially if you’re still in any pain, James.  It would be helpful if you can keep us updated.”
Tony puts his hands on his knees and pushes up to stand.  There’s definitely a part of him that wants to argue.  About the complexities of super soldier brainwashing.  About the video from the bridge in DC and of the fight down at ground level.  About the
Tony won’t return his calls. Won’t even read the texts anymore. And Steve’s lost everything except his game.
The look James gives him is almost comical in his confusion. “I just got a life of my own. You think I’m done with it already?”
And when he looks at Tony he doesn’t see an abusive billionaire hellbent on destroying his friends.  He sees the man Pepper described.  Someone who doesn’t know how to handle being loved.  Someone who doesn’t feel they deserve the care and consideration of others.  And someone with enough influence and power to push people away on a grand scale.
“I’ve never seen anything about him dating one on SportsCenter,” Steve says. “And experience tells me that’s the kind of thing ESPN likes to bring up.”
He can try and drain off some of the blood. Maybe it will help. Maybe it will kill James. Maybe. Maybe. Fucking maybe. He doesn’t know.
Steve knows this isn’t like that.  It’s not the same.  This is absolutely a good thing.  It still aches like a loss somehow, because feelings are hard and Steve’s don’t always work right.  Tony isn’t the only one who’s broken.
“Everyone else is hitching a ride with SHIELD or gonna stick around to make sure the bad guys gets sorted out correctly,” Steve says.
He’s not so careful in his private correspondence.  Tony sends Nick Fury a resignation letter so full of SHIELD secrets (and expletives) by the time it gets handed to Steve, it’s mostly one long, black, redaction bar.
Bruce feels helpless now that it's time to talk this out on his own. Tony is always so helpful during brainstorming and explaining technical things to the team.  He intuitively knows when Bruce needs him to toss in a word or two to help fill in the verbal blanks. Still, James is looking at him with mild interest, so Bruce shoves down his own inadequacies and insecurities and continues.
“Apparently the Vita-Rays didn’t do anything to enhance your tastebuds then,” Tony says.  “Or is this just what happens when you grow up before the invention of sliced bread?”
It’s only when they’re on the elevator that Tony realizes he’s been talking for ten minutes straight, and people hate that.  He knows people hate that.  He trails off mid-sentence and starts in on the usual fix-it.
Tony texts the picture to her and she’s totally engrossed in her phone. It starts buzzing and beeping and her smile is everything Tony had hoped. This might actually be better than a puck, but Tony hopes that’s still coming too.
famous, and I would say, up until around the first time I met him, he was kind of notorious for being a dick.”
That sends a low murmur of objection through the crowd though no one’s brave enough to stand up and walk out.
“Nothing.  Just... I’ve got a crossbow,” she adds.  “And I’m good with it.  I want to keep you safe.”
“Doesn’t leave the tower.  Pale as the day he was born.  Is that why you’re here?  To check in on him for SHIELD?” Tony asks, sounding displeased as he hands Steve a really horrendously green smoothie.
Steve can’t even begin to figure out how all these bruises could relate to sex.  It looks more like Tony volunteered to be the punching bag in a gym somewhere.  Or joined a Fight Club.
“Pillows and pajamas and all that,” the male host agrees, enthusiastically.  “I think we can make that happen.  What do you think, audience?  Would you be interested?”
“Making whoopie?  Knocking boots?  How am I supposed to know what you geriatrics called it back in the day?  He was obsessed with finding you for the rest of his life.  If you were playing hide the pickle that would make sense.”
Tony shrugs.  “I’m not going to evict a single mother and her kids, Steve.  Now help me bend this netting into the right shape before I slip it over the edge.  Maybe there’s shit all we can do about Barnes.  Doesn’t mean we can’t save someone else.”
Sam is at the table, resting his head in his hands and Natasha is at the stove, stirring soup. Tony can smell something frying, too. Potatoes maybe? They smell incredible the closer he gets.
“That would be a kilometer, dear,” Natasha says as she turns toward the men. “And I didn’t have as much to drink as the rest of you.”
It’s too painful to consider whether Bucky counts.  “I haven’t spent a lot of non-work time with people recently.  Not casual hanging out.  And before the war I couldn’t afford to drink and televisions existed but I didn’t know anyone who had one. So yes, not really a thing.  I’d like to, though. Have a beer. If you’re offering.”
“I’ll do better than credit,” Steve says.  “Five hundred points for surviving long enough to meet me.”
The television shuts off, and the lights in the room dim slightly as Steve walks to the window.  The windows had been slightly clouded before but now they are clear, and Steve can’t help but think that Bucky would think this was incredible.  The future.  Now.
Bruce forces himself to look at James again. He doesn’t want to make James feel as if he’s done something wrong. Bruce doesn’t doubt his own intentions. He knows he’d never take advantage of anyone in this position so it isn’t like looking is lascivious.
“That’s right,” Clint agrees.  “Can you imagine what an awesome weapon a walker will make when I’m Steve’s age?”
“Know what?” Steve asks. His voice is weary. Confused a little, but not as confused as he should be, for a call coming out of the blue from Tony at 5:14 AM on a weekday.
It's Clint who answers.  “The only thing Tony likes more than making things is seeing what they look like once they’ve gotten the shit beat out of them,” Clint assures him. “I swear he’s like a kid in a candy store every time I bring him back a jacked-up arrow.”
The whole ‘that’s what I want’ thing works great for them most of the time.  It’s pretty much the only set of therapy words they can both consistently use without a lot of stress.  And Steve’s got a choice.  Because either he wants the same, or he’s got to tell Tony that no, he doesn’t want that.  That he doesn’t want Tony taking care of him.
Tony’s face is bloody, his shirt is bloody, and Tony barrels through the crowd of gathered photographers not giving one single fuck who he bumps or shoves out of the way.  It all happens so fast that they miss getting a clear shot of Tony.  When the flashes go off, their focus is on Steve.  Steve who’s standing in the door, with Tony’s blood on his shirt, watching him go with a stricken look on his face.
Steve takes the seat next to him, and then rests his hand on Tony’s thigh under the table. It’s the kind of lazy, casual affection Tony loves. There’s nothing contrived about Steve. When Steve touches him, Tony isn’t left wondering if Steve’s doing it for his money, or his connections, or for fame.
There’s really not much he wants to do less, but if he’s going to prove to the world that he’s got his shit together, this is what it’s going to take.
“Is this about Howard?” Tony asks, half an hour later.  “You think you owe him?  Want to fix his mistakes?”
Rhodey makes another gesture that’s difficult for Steve to interpret.  Irritation, maybe, at the people who’d taken advantage of a lonely kid.
“Looks can be deceiving,” Steve says.  “But in my case I grew out of it.  Mostly.  When I was a kid, I never met a bully I didn’t think needed a punch in the face.  I was small so there were a lot of bullies.”
Steve actively tries not to use his superior hearing to gain personal information on his team when they don’t know he might be listening.  It’s pure coincidence that he's headed for the bathroom when he picks up Tony’s voice coming from a side office.  Tony sounds stressed.
“Should be easy-peasy,” Tony says. “But yeah-- J, drop the picture, but keep the audio feed up. Banner can let me know when he needs my genius input and--”
“Maybe not,” Tony said.  “I’ve been working on something else in my spare time.  Something small.  Shaped like a coin.  Can be attached to anything with a connection and it will download the information off it and transmit it to me using the nearest signal source.”
“When I found out Tony Stark was headed our way... a big part of me wanted to curl up in a hole and die.  I’ve faced scorn from the scientific community for years.  I’m a persona non grata-- totally unwanted.  At best I’m a cautionary tale and at worst I’m a monster.  I fully expected Tony to treat me like shit.  I really did.”
It’s organized chaos as smaller plates are passed around and cold, foaming glasses of beer, are shoved in front of each person at the table.  Conversations break out in twos or threes, and it leaves Tony and Steve to get to know each other.
“Pretty sure that applies to every Avenger,” Tony consoles.  He takes Steve’s hand in his own and threads their fingers together.  “You built him up in your head. People rarely live up to the hype,” Tony says gently.  “My whole life growing up, I had this ridiculous crush on Captain America.  Read every comic.  Snuck into my dad’s archives to look at old war plans that Cap had scratched some art on.  I had high expectations--”
“It wouldn’t have to be an island,” Tony says.  “I want to buy you reasonable things.  Gas.  Hotel rooms.  Breakfast.  I want to take care of you.  That’s what I want.”
“We didn’t want him getting hurt,” the officer explains.  She’s the sort of efficient professional Steve appreciates and he smiles at her in thanks.  “There’s a lot of prestige in prison, being the guy who punched Tony Stark, and he’s pretty out of it.  I don’t think he could defend himself if he wanted to.”
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Tony grumbles.  “Gerber’s a sadist.  He’s got to be working for AIM, or Doom, or the President of the We Hate Tony Stark Fan Club or something.  I’m sure he’s evil.”
After a beat, James lets out his breath and slouches a little. His posture is no longer rigid and Bruce is glad James is relaxing.
“I know-- I know,” Steve says, before Tony can speak. “I shouldn’t get my hopes up. James might hate me. He’s not Bucky. This could all go so wrong.”
“You know Rogers and you would be the most difficult to kill if I couldn’t...” The soldier struggles for words.
When he does get up, he dresses in slightly warmer clothes for their hike to who-knows-where, and walks out to see what’s for breakfast. James is sitting at the table, typing on Clint’s computer while Clint narrates his own cooking like he’s on Food Network.
“So anyway I’m beat up and exhausted,” Clint continues, leaning against one of the bar-stools without actually sitting on it. “I’m strapped to a chair.  Cap walks in and tells Tasha they need a pilot.  I say I can fly. I was all ready to make some kind of elaborate case for myself, because let’s get real-- this is Captain America and I’m circus trash.  So I’m stuck there, trying to remember the Pledge of Allegiance and wondering where I can get a bald eagle to swear it on.  At that point I just wanted to help.  However they’d let me. Whatever it took.  But all I do is I make my offer, and Steve looks at Tasha and she gives him a little nod, and that’s it. That’s all he needed. One nod and I was on the team.”
Tony shrugs. “I don’t know. It’s not like there was a list of questions. She just said we should talk about... expectations. Needs. Wants. Feelings. It’s stupid.”
“You didn’t want him to finish that story,” Steve argues.  “You were uncomfortable.  I was watching you.”
Nanna moves on to choosing what appear to be ceramic shuriken (at this point an old lady grabbing throwing stars seems about par for the course) and tucks them into the pockets of her apron.
“If he wants my autograph bad enough to invite you back over, figure I’ll send him one of his own,” Bucky says with a smirk.
Darcy’s been begging to meet Bruce for weeks, but Kate hasn’t been ready for that yet.  Bruce is special to her in a way that’s hard to explain and Darcy is her girlfriend so that’s special too, and it’s a lot to worry about-- that they won’t like each other.  That they won’t jive.  That Darcy won’t get what Kate sees in a platonic friendship with a man twice her age.
That had lasted until just now.  Steve wasn’t eating (except for the BannerBar Tony’d hassled him into swallowing whole).  He was barely drinking.   He hadn’t slept.  Whatever he’d found, Tony needed to know.  Turns out, Steve had found the Winter Soldier's medical experimentation files.
“The future’s weird,” Steve says but he doesn’t object.  He rises to his feet, pulls on his jacket and follows after Clint.
Tony is off somewhere else in his head.  He talks occasionally outside of the cussing, but it’s mostly muffled under his breath and most of what he says is about shipping Dum-E off to K-Mart if the bot can’t get his act together. (Tony clearly adores Dum-E so Steve doesn’t believe the threats are valid even for a second.)
“Sorry-- give me a minute.”  Bruce takes in several deep breaths and then breathes them back out on an 8 count.  “Shit.  Tony didn’t tell me.”
So it’s unexpected and kind of awful when Tony’s sitting in his workshop, and Steve walks in uninvited and thrusts some printed papers under his face.
“Must not have been in too big a hurry if it took you two whole days,” Tony points out from where he sits on top of the security counter.  He’s got a Starkpad in one hand and he’s typing without looking up.
Steve smiles and leans down to sign his name.  Since Pepper had filled in the rest, it only takes a signature and a date.  He looks at Tony and holds out the pen.  Tony grabs it and shifts so he can sign.
The entire table shifts under Clint’s weight and everyone grabs for their drinks simultaneously, which leaves no hands available for stopping the half-full platter of fries from pitching forward.  It slides to the ground with a crash.
Tony stops.  It’s curiosity that makes him turn. (Someday he will learn his lesson about curiosity) (Unless he runs through all 9 lives first.)
Steve doesn’t need to think to respond.  He turns to Tony.  “People have been using you for your money your entire life.  I’m not going to be one of those people.”
The way their seasons lined up, Steve and Tony’s team had played early in the season and they won’t play again unless they make it to the playoffs. Which seems more and more likely as the next few weeks pass.
The lights dim.  Hammer’s PowerPoint presentation flickers for a moment and a new set of information appears on the large screen behind the podium. There’s the sound of mass vibration and multiple dings as the same information pings to the cellphones of the assembled crowd, most of whom are either military or reporters.  Rhodey grins at Tony from the front row.
“Yeah, I do too,” Tony says.  He looks beat.  “Was gonna keep the Loki-impression in the floor but Bruce went and got all sulky about it so I had the whole place cleaned up.  Want a smoothie?”
“No,” Steve says emphatically. “It guts me to put it like that. But what else can I say? You don’t want to hear that I love you and that this isn’t your fault. Or that Clint and Natasha love you and that when the shit hit the fan, Natasha didn’t have to think twice about calling for you. She knew you’d come. She trusted you. That’s team. That’s family.”
Steve appears on the screen again behind Tony, bursting through the lab door with a gigantic bag slung over his shoulder and a lightness in his expression Bruce has never seen. Like the weight of the world has fallen away.
“What would have worked on him back during the war?” Tony asks.  “You said you think he’s in there, Steve.  What would bring him running?”
“I need to ask for some medical equipment to get a better look at your knee and Tony’s my best friend... I’d like to tell him who I’m with. I know he has a reputation for... well, being Tony, but if I ask him to give us space, he will. I trust him to keep you quiet. I was fine with him not knowing who I was with before but now that Steve and Natasha know it isn’t just a secret. It’s a
“If I want to get rid of all the alcohol that’s in the apartment, can you point me to anything I miss?”
He wasn’t angry at Steve’s initial intrusion but now he kind of is.  Leave it to Steve to get a rise out of him over practically nothing.
“JARVIS is in my earpiece so I’m all caught up,” Sam says, handing Bruce the gauze and showing him where he wants him to hold it. “Can you apply pressure here? We’re going to slow the blood, get him on a stretcher, then get him on the plane. One, two, three, easy as that.”
“That Bucky Barnes was alive for one? I mean we could start there but probably-- the part with my parents. That’s-- that’s the part--” Tony snaps his mouth shut. Not because he doesn’t have more words but because words fail him. What are words when the world is closing in around you? What’s... what’s anything... when your lungs burn and your peripheral vision blurs and--
Steve laughs. “You aren’t crying. I can’t tell you how many people cry on me when they meet me for the first time.” He gives the boy a pat on the shoulder. “You’re doing fine. If you’ve got a minute, I’d love to hear about your great-grandma. How life turned out for Boop.”
“Bananas,” Bruce agrees as he takes a seat.  “But they do know their Mexican street food.  Want a bite?”
“You can stay if you want,” Bruce offers. “I have more food. And a blanket. If Hydra comes looking for you, they’ll have to get through me first.”
“I knew inviting Wilson to stay here was a mistake,” Tony says.  “He brought his sister, without even asking.”
Steve stands up and walks over to the desk where Tony had pointed and grabs the form and an ink pen.  He returns and sits back down on the floor next to Tony and holds up the form so they can both look over it together.
He knows malnutrition when he sees it. He sees other things too-- tattered clothing, favoring of the left leg, dark shadows under the eyes, shallow breathing, rib retractions-- those aren’t as easily solved as hunger.
“We’ve only been driving for a couple of hours and we’ve stopped twice for food.  How are you possibly this averse to road-tripping?” Tony asks.
Bruce is momentarily stunned. It’s not that he hadn’t known on some level that James trusts him, but it’s huge that James is using those words all on his own. Bruce’s insides get tight. There’s no way he’s worthy of something so hard-earned as James’s faith.
And he does do it. Once he sits at the first table of veterans, the years fall away. They tell stories, they laugh, they reminisce. They’ve brought their families, and point out their children and their grandkids and their great-grandkids out on the dance floor.
“These will do,” she says.  “And I know the four of you will take care of the distraction.  It feels good to be back in the thick of things.  I never thought I’d have another chance.”
Tony’s unsure. He’s not great with morning afters, especially when it involves blacking out. Steve might want him gone.
Steve opens up his arms and Tony only hesitates for a moment before he crosses the distance between them and buries his face in Steve’s shirt. Steve wraps his arms around him and pulls him close. They stay like that until the coffee maker beeps.
From that moment on, it’s chaos.  They’re 30 seconds into the forest when a loud explosion rocks the ground under them.   It was the van.  There are shouts in the distance.  At first it sounds like someone might be chasing them but that sound quickly turns into shouts of surprise and screams of pain.  There’s another, echoing boom in the far distance. That one sounds a lot like it was the helicopter.
“I’m really proud of you,” Steve whispers into Tony’s ear. He pulls back enough so Tony can see him. “Am I making the stupid face again?”
Since I know I might get comments about it, Steve's struggle with Bucky/James's name is written intentionally.  He's definitely trying, but it's not easy for him, and I figured it would be helpful to point this out upfront rather than you wonder if Steve is really having a hard time getting it right or if it's just me having constant brain flails.
Tony opens his mouth as if to launch into another explanation then seems to realize what Steve’s said.
“Do you mind walking back to the tower?” Tony asks as they stand from their booth.  “Might be nice to get a little more fresh air.”
“I’ll do everything I can to make sure you don’t regret that,” Bruce promises him. “Mostly I’m relieved you aren’t pissed I didn’t let you die.”
“I think you missed your calling,” Bruce says, stepping into the kitchen to pour himself some of the coffee Clint had brewed. “When we’re home you should have Tony call Rachael Ray. See if he can get you on.”
“Crueeeeel,” Tony complains, though he’s laughing because Steve’s making nerd jokes and that more than anything makes him turn in Steve’s arms and look at him.  Really look at him.  “You’ve really been practicing that whole speech?”
Since Steve doesn’t say anything immediately, Tony adds, “And it really was the first painting on the list.  As soon as I saw it, I knew I could write about it.  I thought it’d be one thing about art I could get right.”
“He’s better off than he was,” Steve says, like it’s the most obvious thing in the world. “Sometimes you don’t get a choice in how you help people.”
“What if I get there and they want to use me?  I’m a weapon.  An asset.  They’re gonna realize I’m not Bucky Barnes and then that’s all I’m good for,” James hedges.
Steve groans, and then stands, crossing the distance between them in two steps.  He rests his hands on Tony’s hips and leans in to press a kiss to his forehead.
“Rogers said he didn’t want to hurt me,” James says, after Bruce’s words sit in the air for a while.  “People have said that before.”
Everyone’s gone. They’d eaten lunch and gone their separate ways and now Tony and Steve are alone and all Tony wants is to rest against his boyfriend. His media-official, released a joint statement, spend every day off together, boyfriend.
He wanders around for a bit, not knowing what to do with himself, and eventually finds himself back at his usual diner.  Steve treats himself to another burger and milkshake and in the process manages to sweet talk the lady behind the counter into adding the whole team to the menu.  Scribbling out recipe combinations on the back of a place mat is an excellent distraction.
The images come faster.  Rhodey gone and whatever is left in his place, blank and impassive.  Rhodey stripped of all humanity.  Rhodey with his hand around Maria’s neck.
It’s Sunday. Rhodey has just left, and they’re alone in Tony’s room eating gummy bears. A bit belatedly, Steve wishes they weren’t having this talk while sitting on Tony’s bed.
They’ve got Jenny in the game and Sam’s a better trainer than a player, but it’s still a rough game. Jenny’s got pads and a low center of gravity so she gets in some body checks that make all the guys cheer.
“That you had just told me there were pictures of you on the internet from when you were barely legal. I assumed they weren’t there with your permission. I didn’t-- It had nothing to do with you not wearing clothes. That is something I am absolutely looking forward to seeing,” Steve says emphatically. “I didn’t want to see photos of you in a position where you’d been hurt or taken advantage of. I’d end up breaking into the Pentagon and shutting off the world internet or something, to protect you.”
Steve throws the newspaper back in the trash and goes to the sink to wash his hands. A look at the clock tells him he has a half an hour before he needs to leave for the Hockey for the Heart event. He should probably shower, shave and get dressed.
Once Steve is wearing jeans it feels like a waste to stay miserably flopped on his bed so he goes out to wander the penthouse, which is really mostly an excuse to find Tony.
All the distrust that’s been drilled into Tony since birth flares up anyway. How many times had Howard told him that no one but family could be trusted? That friends were for people who weren’t born Starks? How many people had Tony pushed away in his lifetime, because he had little capacity for trust?
Clint nods toward the elevator where Bruce is exiting.  The scientist looks adorably exhausted, with wild hair and a wrinkled lab coat.
kind of mindfuck for Steve.  Tony’s struggling to get his brain around it, and his brain is (if he says so himself) capable of making order out of any kind of chaos.  Also that in reverse.
Steve’s touched they’re willing to do that for him and Bruce.  It’s going to make life a hell of a lot easier once Tony’s home.
There are a few wires that JARVIS highlights, but to the naked eye-- to Bruce’s eye anyway-- the differences are minimal.
He finds Tony and Steve sitting close together on the love seat, their heads bent together in quiet conversation.
Bruce stands and walks out to the living room.  Steve’s already on his feet, which makes sense since Steve likely hears everything said in James’s bedroom. Since Bruce also suspects James can hear everything said out in the rest of the house, that makes things even.
“I’ve got a couple of thoughts,” Tony says.  “One, we sneak down the hall and steal the queen bed that Nat reserved for herself.”
“James, what is it about that shirt that’s making you twitchy?” Clint asks. “That’s not criticism or anything,” he adds quickly, putting up both his hands in the universal sign for
“Barring anything unforeseen, he’ll be up in the next few hours,” Bruce agrees. “Which is why we’re calling. We need to find a place where he can wake up and even if he feels alarmed, not hurt himself or anyone else. We’ve already ruled out the tower. The only place he couldn’t escape there is the Hulk-Proof room and I’m not doing that to him. I’m not going to allow him to wake up restrained either. When he comes to, I want him to be able to move and to feel like he can protect himself.”
The confession takes a huge amount of effort and still it’s not very descript.  Steve really has no words for what he’s feeling.  No adjectives for his abject misery.  No verbs for the sobs he buries in his pillow.  Language can’t work around the sort of numb and terrible longing that has gripped him since he woke up in the hospital a month and a half before.
“Don’t care about fun,” Steve says, because he’s pretty sure if it was the worst thing in the world it was still going to be fun. “I’m a lot more worried about wrecking it.”
“I’m coming out,” Steve explains. “It’s time. I don’t want to have to do a lot of explaining when people start spotting us together. And I figure if I do it now, we can hide out here for a day or two and maybe we’ll get lucky and some other celebrity will make news before the week’s up.”
Steve takes a few steps toward the door then pulls out his phone, so he’ll look like he’s texting.  That’s the great thing about phones.  No more hiding behind bushes when you want to look inconspicuous.
Bruce is old enough to be her father.  He might be older than her father.  But he doesn’t look at her like she’s an idiot for suggesting she can do this.  Instead he nods, like her words makes perfect sense.  Like he trusts that Kate can do exactly as she says.
Steve’s just pressed the button to switch the phone to speaker when James’s voice comes through the line.
“Since Barton’s lousy at introductions,” the man two seats away from Tony says, “I’m Sam.  Glad you could join us.”
James gives him a small nod and Tony reaches above his head to grab for the swinging arm of the more advanced scanner Bruce had pulled in.
He leans against the kitchen counter to text Tony ‘thank you.’  He doesn’t type any more than that just yet because Tony’s generosity-- his attention to all these small things-- is overwhelming to Bruce.  No one, for years, has cared so much.
“Bucky was the best friend I ever had,” Steve defends.  “I don’t know how that connects to you-- to his body. But I can’t fight you without fighting him. That’s what I know. Also, since we’re already yelling, you sound exactly like his ma.  And mine.  So you aren’t him, but I guess
If JARVIS knows how Natasha cracks her egg, he won’t tell.  And neither will she.  The only hint any of them have is the single word Natasha mutters to Bucky in Russian moments after it happens.
“That’s ugly,” Sam says, joining them with the device, as Bruce carefully turns Clint’s wrist into a better position for scanning.
“I’m proud of you, Tony,” Steve says.  “You’re breathing.  I know it’s hard but you’re breathing.  And I am so proud of you for that.  Can you breathe with me?”
“They got him to a hospital but it’s not looking good. He’ll be lucky if they don’t have to take his fingers off entirely. And Tony-- that’s what I’m worried is going to happen to you. Maybe not your fingers, but
Fifty-three cents and this guy needs to wait for a check to pay up?  Tony’s going to need to look over how much these people are making.  Obie had been stingy with starting salaries.  Tony figures people do better work when they aren’t sitting around worrying about their rent.
Steve holds the stick with reverence. “Do you mind if I take a picture of this so I can text it to the guys?”
Tony’s nervous again and this time it has nothing to do with a dark trunk. He’s not the best with old people under good circumstances. And these circumstances are not good.
“We’re going for the Fourth of July,” Bruce confirms.  “With considerably more dirt, gravel and bang.”
“Yeah, sure.  I’ll just choose you out of my contacts because I definitely have your private information programmed into my phone.  Right next to all the other billionaires I know,” Clint says.
Team NYC bonds over food, and Team Disaster Waiting to Happen has a late night talk about first impressions.
James is hesitant to handle the equipment at first, but about the time they move out to the porch to enjoy the cool air of the late morning, he starts to get into it. It’s his idea for Clint to go find some cow shit, and when Clint comes back with a bucket of the stuff ten minutes later, it’s the first real laugh Bruce has heard from James.
“Give it to me,” James reproaches, limping to grab it from Bruce’s grasp. He looks entirely unimpressed. “Don’t burn things someone could use.”
“Yes,” Tony says, putting down the gauntlet he’s fiddling with, so he can reach over for Steve. “That’s me. Master pet thief. What’s Captain America going to do about it?”
Steve goes to the Smithsonian every Sunday after mass, without fail.  He knows why.  He used to spend every Sunday afternoon after church with Bucky, playing cards out on the porch, eating lunch with Bucky’s parents and sisters.  Sundays were for God and Bucky, and now Steve’s doing his best to hold onto them both.
doctors did that,” Clint says with a huge smile, as he slaps his hand on his knee. “The talking out the ass thing,” he clarifies. “I just never thought I’d hear one admit it. I might be man-crushing on you a little right now, I’m not even kidding.”
Bed time is not as awkward as Steve had feared.  Tony wants a shower, so Steve changes into some plain blue and gray pajamas while Tony’s in there, and when Tony comes out, he’s also in pajamas.  Red silk ones, because he’s fancy like that.
“Not entirely,” Tony says.  “Thought I’d come up here and see why this gear clamp keeps sending out error messages.  Look--”
Clint has his hands up in surrender, looking as dead-calm as a deep lake on a windless day.  Like this is exactly what he’d hoped to be doing on a Thursday afternoon.  Like he is totally unflappable while Bruce is Super Fucking Flapped.
questions about the contents of your go bag and whatever is pushing out that edge up near the zipper-- did you pack the actual kitchen sink in there?”
“God yes,” Tony agrees.  Not that he doesn’t love his friends, but he loves a stolen moment of Steve’s time even more.
“You realize the materials for this strap cost more than a car, right?” Tony asks.  “Bringing me McDonalds doesn’t make us even.”
Steve walks to the security desk and looks down, keeping the brim of his hat over his face to hide some of how idiotic this is.
There’s a pause as Steve considers the dilemma, but it’s Clint who speaks. “Does it have to be indoors?”
Steve thinks back to Rhodey’s story about Tony’s college years. How Rhodey was the first person to ever offer to buy Tony’s meal. It’s nice to be able to provide, even something as unpretentious as diner lunch.
“I should have given it to you sooner,” Tony says, waving off the appreciation.  “Honestly, I forgot about it.  Unlike Howard,” Tony continues (and the spite and anger is back in full force) “I don’t need a shrine to Captain America to get me through my day.  Whiskey works fine, all on its own.”
“I suppose so. But for what it’s worth,” Bruce says, “When Dr. Wilkes posits that X-395 is fissionable by the introduction of ultra-fast proniating neutrons, he’s not accounting for the inelastic scattering of the proton energy field and
“But they can’t this time, I don’t think?  I mean, that’s what the guy promised Hammer.  Something about Tony consenting on video?”
“And you’ve got me in Switzerland,” Natasha consoles.  “I’ll do everything I can to bring him home.  To bring
Tony laughs until he’s gasping for breath. “These are amazing,” he says. “I can do all of this and so much more.”
Steve nods, and again, there’s that smile.  Tony’s whole body burns with just how much he wants to say ‘fuck the rules’ and shove Steve up against one of the tables in here and kiss him senseless. To run his hand up Steve’s side and...
“Bucky’s driving us to his nanna’s house,” Steve explains. “I lived there for a while, after my mom died. It’s the safest place we know.”
“Yeah, well, I’m not great on edge either.  And stabbed or smashed-- both bad -- let’s avoid -- you dead.”
It’s well after midnight and they’ve all been hanging out in the living room, reading quietly for about half an hour, when Clint speaks up.
“I have it,” Tony says. “Just wouldn’t want to shoot the guy who’s sharing my bed regularly. Poor bedroom etiquette. Miss Manners has written a couple of columns about it. You probably haven't seen them but they're totally a thing."
,” Tony says, drawing out the word in a way that makes it sound pleasantly filthy.  “Tell me the truth.  Have you or have you not watched my sex tapes?
The blue square turns green and a panel slides away allowing Bruce to reach inside. The first box contains a variety of tech manuals, schematics, and other papers Tony wants Bruce to read.  The second box contains three brown-paper wrapped boxes labeled BannerBars.  The third is full of bubble wrap and packaging peanuts and must be the scanner.
Tony’s laugh is off pitch and angry.  “Ummm.  No?  No, not a problem, just wondering why the fuck you never told me,” he says.  “I thought... I thought you disapproved.  All this time.  Thought you... you hated me for it.  Howard’s son.  Gay.  A disgrace to his memory.  You were one more person for me to disappoint.”
Steven is her oldest great-grandson. He’s a journalism student at NYU and he is just as spirited as Boop. His opinions are hilarious and he is so full of hope and energy and goodness. Steve doesn’t interact with a lot of young people these days so Steven is a breath of fresh air.
Steve leads him through the crowd, with a possessive (and doesn’t that send a thrill down Tony’s spine) hand to the small of his back.  They make their way out to the little back employee patio and Steve lets go of him, so they can sit next to each other on the picnic table.  Tony leans in for a quick kiss, that Steve manages to turn into something with a lot more heat and promise.
“God, I hope so,” Tony says.  He climbs onto the bed and leans in toward Steve to kiss him.  “I wasn’t sure where you planned to sleep.  I was hoping it would be with me.”
I could scan him 100 times it won’t change my interpretation.  All I see are wires wrapped up in more wires.  Can you do the scan?  Then you can zoom in on what’s important.
“We’re rewarding ourselves for making the other happy,” Tony says.  “Is there any way that can be a bad thing?”
“How much do you know about me?” Bruce asks as he sits down on his knees, getting closer to James’s injury without making any move to touch him just yet.
“And we’re wondering if a suspension might be more appropriate than dismissing Tony from the team all together,” Pepper says.  “Being an Avenger means so much to him.  More than you could ever know.”
“Not your business, SpongeBob Noseypants,” Tony replies, without looking up from his phone. It’s a firm shut-down.
“For pancakes, sure,” Clint says, as he joins Bruce in the kitchen.  “But coffee I need now.  Oh-- there’s a couple packages outside on the porch for you. Didn’t pick them up cause they’re all in some weird case that’s gonna need your fingerprints to open. A couple drones dropped them off about an hour before it got light. I wasn’t too worried since it was obviously Stark.”
Tom and Jerry comes on the wall screen a moment later, and Bruce taps the control panel for the medbed to tilt James up slightly so he has a better view.
“That seems presumptuous,” Tony quips.  “Maybe I’m watching Steve because I think he’s stealing office supplies.”
Steve’s probably right, but Tony’s too chickenshit to ask. He tells himself it’s because he doesn’t want to put Bruce in a bad position but the truth is... he really isn’t sure Bruce
James manages a look that could pass for sympathetic before reaching for one of the last few StarkBars.
Tony doesn’t look back as they return to the stairs, and this time they walk all the way up to the roof.  Tony’s a little winded when they get to the top but Steve’s fine.  Steve’s always fine everyone knows that. (It’s his thing.)
It’s good though.  It gives them a chance to start couples therapy (Bruce’s suggestion) with a therapist from the city, who drives up on Saturdays to meet with Steve and Tony together.  For their relationship to be sustainable outside of rehab, it can’t hurt to have some extra support, and once Tony returns to the tower they’ll continue their couples therapy with the same therapist for as long as they need the help.
“JARVIS is suggesting we get both his arms above his head. Thinks that might ease some of the pressure on that mess,” Sam says. “My words, not his, but you get what I’m saying, right?”
He puts on a pair of faded jeans that are a stitch too tight and a royal blue t-shirt that makes him look about as Captain America as he can manage outside of donning his uniform.  He checks his hair twice and even spritzes on cologne.  He’s got to get this right.
“Right every time,” Bruce says. “When you say you can’t feel anything, can you tell me more about that?”
Is going to hurt like hell if everything with Steve has been a set up. When it comes down to it, that’s what is causing the awful, tight feeling in Tony’s chest. Not mistrust. Not leftover betrayal-feels from Obie. It’s the knowledge that his relationship with Steve might be nothing but a lie. Tony’s really not sure how he’ll handle that. If there’s even enough alcohol in the world to dull that hurt.
“Steve called it valid!  110 points!” Clint shouts in triumph, before realizing there are other people around and lowering his voice.  “Seriously, dude, I owe you.  We should get a drink with us after work someday.  Do you do ever do that?  Slum it with the commoners?”
No reply. Tony just starts banging the metal thingy again even harder. Hard enough that it starts to twist in his hand.
Steve pauses to look between his two school pictures at the end.  The next to last shows Steve looking tiny and fierce.  In his senior portrait he looks a lot more laid back and he’s practically doubled in size.
Once the elevator doors swish open and he’s surrounded by dark cubicles and the eyes of the few people there at 7 A.M., Tony thinks maybe he should have asked Jarvis to send Bruce up instead.
That does not help Steve’s cause.  Tony glares at Steve with a sort of fury that leaves no room for apology.  Not now.  Maybe not ever.  He drops Steve’s coat to the ground like it burns him.  “I want my keys.”
"I know a little something about rebirth," Steve says, a sad smile at his own bad joke. "Whoever you are now doesn't deserve any of what HYDRA did to you, and any friend of Bruce and Clint’s could be a friend of mine. You know that, don't you?"
“Sure.” Tony looks at Dum-E and the camera. “Hey kids. After a long life of fucking up more than anyone has a right to fuck up, I’ve learned a couple of things. Things that maybe could help one of you, so you don’t have to hit rock bottom before things get better.”
“Buck--” Steve says, sounding exasperated in a way that probably means this is the second half of an argument that happened while Tony was downstairs.
Steve has to rescue the newspaper from the trashcan and dust off coffee grounds and some food scraps, before he can read the unflattering Letter to the Editor about himself. Bucky must have thrown it away before he left to catch the team bus.  Steve really can’t blame him. Buck has always been protective. Overly protective. And in some ways this most recent batch of hateful press has been harder on Bucky than it has on Steve.
Tony knows by Bruce’s daydreamy stare that his brain is already off and running in science-land.  If it weren’t for the very real consequences of failure, this would be the most destructive fun either of them have had in a long time.
