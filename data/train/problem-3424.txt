“We got V-day cakes!” Bill yelled, coming out of the kitchen with a try. He barley made it two steps before people were swamping him, removing the treats from the tray. Within seconds the tray was empty and Bill turned back to the kitchen, probably to get some more.
The actual ceremony went out without a hitch, Ash touched by the number of people that appeared and the vows Dean and Cas made for each other. Then the speeches started. Sam was the first to go, pulling out a piece of paper with a flourish and bringing the microphone close to his face. “Mawidge…mawidge is what bwi us togewer today…” Sam started and Ash about choked on his beer and Dean about fell over in hysterics. Castiel gave Sam a confused look, almost like he wanted to ask what Sam was trying to acomplish. Apparently Sam was going to let everyone know how he felt about how long this took!
Ellen made her way back to the Roadhouse. She paused in shock, seeing half the building gone and the windows and doors boarded up. The ‘Do Not Enter’ sign on the door looked rushed, like Ash made it in a hurry. She wondered just what happened when she left last night. When she had finished making the cakes, she had slipped outside to get some fresh air. She was shocked to see Bobby Singer and Prince of all people smoking behind the bar. Bobby told her how they were old friends and the two invited her to join them for the evening. Her, Bobby, and Prince had a few whiskey’s and sang old classic rocks songs until the sun came up. Looks like she missed one hell of a party.
“Whose all coming?” Bill asked. The boys said they wanted it to be a small affair, but who knows what that meant when it came to hunters. Bobby shrugged.
Sam had made his appearance with his wife Eileen. Garth Fitzgerald IV and his wife Bess had also arrived with Gertie, Castiel, and Samuel Fitzgerald. Bobby stood in the corner talking to John, Mary, and Rufus Turner. Ash was still questioning John’s presence, but it wasn’t his wedding. Jo was making small talk with Jody and Donna while Kaia, Patience, and Claire were talking to Jack. Alex was setting up a tray of brownies and vegan snacks on a table. Ash had a mild suspicion they were ‘special brownies’ but who cares since there isn’t any police to arrest them in Heaven. Kevin Tran and Charlie Bradbury were discussing something nerd related and Meg and Crowley were already in an argument while Gabriel, Gadreel, and Balthazar were laughing nearby. Benny Lafette was talking to Rowena MacLeod and the two seemed to be getting along just fine. There were a number of others coming in that Ash didn’t really pay too much attention to, there was so much he still needed to get done.
Dean didn't know if Cas dreamed, if angels even were capable of dreaming, but he hoped he wasn't trapped inside some nightmare. Of all the angels, Cas did horrible things, there was more than enough material for generous nightmare collection – but he hoped Cas dreamed about the world.
He brushed Cas's face with his thumb, gently, by contrast to his harsh words. He leaned in, their lips almost touching.
"Sure." Dean snickered next to the rosebush, ten feet away from Cas. He snickered, because they knew the antidote now, because they had a way out. He wasn't making empty promises to Cas.
It looked like the tables were turned. Dean wasn't hungry, which didn't make any sense after eight hours away from bunker, but fainting wouldn't do them any good. That much was true. Besides, Sam clutched his right wrist like he was getting cramps into it, maybe hot shower would help them both.
But wasn't the entire purpose of angels to obey? The God, the archangels, whoever decided to be their boss? There was even a time when the heaven followed Cas.
It begged the question how hurt Cas normally got on hunts. They never got to see it, as he kept healing himself as quickly as he was getting injured.
Dean opened his eyes at the touch of warm hand on his cheek. A touch of a hand that killed and healed, traitor's hand, warrior's hand. Lover's hand.
"His wounds aren't closing," said Sam, and Dean knew that, he didn't need it spelled out. Cas was an angel of the Lord, he healed with just a thought, but the small cut on his face that was supposed to close an eternity ago still shined with bright red. His torso probably looked a hell lot worse.
And now they had the same messenger of God on the backseat, bleeding and unconscious. It looked like being friends with the Winchesters really had its perks – payed in blood and suffering.
The obnoxious trench coat they were all too fond of wasn't getting in the way, so Dean went to unbutton the shirt.
"The kiss is supposed to wake him up, you aren't getting consent before that," Sam had the nerve to openly laugh at him.
Dean's hands were the hands of the killer first and foremost, and there wasn't any doctor he would've trusted more with Cas than Sammy.
He dipped whatever it was he held in the slowly cooling water, revealing a green colour under the layer of blood.
They were halfway through the room – the rosebush showed as a mightier enemy one would have awaited. It grew impressively quickly for something that was basically a weed.
"The pitchfork isn't pointy enough for you?" asked Dean, wiping the sweat out of his eyes with a shirt that had more holes than fabric now.
"Your right wrist is cramming up, and you have a few cracked ribs. Together with hundred of cuts that can catch infection. If you call that 'alright', then fine."
"Not as far as I know. Rowena said she once put to sleep a man for hundreds of years. Some of the curses die with the witch that caused them. Some of them lift on their own accord a week or so later, but I wouldn't count on that."
When Dean finally stepped out from the doors and went to his room, the bunker seemed darker than before. He didn't notice the sharp green leaves growing around Cas's body.
He stood there, unmoving, thinking about their past, the part of his life he spent with Castiel. They knew each other for five years – a fleeting thought for Cas, who was older than whole humanity – but a significant amount of time for him.
The buttons were stuck, dried blood making them impossible to undo, so Dean tugged until the shirt ripped, buttons flying through air. It was ruined anyway.
He realized he was brushing his thumb along Cas's cheekbone, not knowing where the gentleness came from, and hurriedly made himself stop.
Dean snapped into consciousness like he got under the spell of a djinn, immediately pointing a gun at the door.
Maybe the curse wasn't entirely Dean's fault this time. It didn't make him any more deserving, it wasn't a significant difference, but maybe it wouldn't have mattered anyway.
The kiss was just a peck on the lips, but the roses died right away, dismantling into dust, only the halo made of thorns remained intact.
It was probably a blasphemy to kiss an Angel of the Lord. But Dean had already been to hell, and he would've gone again if it was for the crime of kissing his angel.
"Let's get this Sleeping Beauty into infirmary," Dean announced, already on his way to open the doors. They never really used the place but now it seemed like time good as any to start. They weren't leaving Cas on the central table like some sort of barbarians.
Desiree nodded, “Right well. For right now, I suggest you get something to eat, find a place to stay and get some rest. Lack of sleep is detrimental to the brain and with that and not having eaten in a while, your body can’t repair itself.”
Dean didn’t hear Sam calling his name as he ran into the room. He didn’t know Sam caught him as his knees buckled and the world went dark.
Sam stepped back off the step and Cas started to descend the stairs, very slowly. He held the railing tightly, wincing with every step down, the impact of his heel landing on the step jarring his side. Dean still intended on staying close behind, but he didn’t hover.
His heart raced. The calm he had back in the car flew out the door as soon as he stepped into the barn. Through the rotted boards, Dean can hear the crickets outside. The only sound entering his ears next to his laboured breathing.
Desiree’s voice broke through his thoughts and brought him back to earth. She stood in front of him, with sadness on her face. “I know you’re worried about your friend, but I can assure you that he getting the best care in the state. The hospital has your cell phone number. They will call you if anything happens. I promise.”
Dean recoiled his hand close to his chest and looked at the ex-angel, baffled. He watched as Cas severed their eye contact, slide back down under the sheets and rolled onto his side, away from Dean, wrapping his arms around himself.
“Once we deal with the vampires, we will go back to the bunker, say our goodbyes and go our separate ways, as planned.” Cas assured the hunter, and looked back out the side window.
Sam’s sudden interruption made Dean jump and let the breath he didn’t know he was holding go. He cleared his throat and quickly looked back down at his bag, pretending to go through his tiny check list again. His dignity still ain’t there.
Dean felt the adrenaline start to leave his bloodstream as his shoulder’s slumped and he allowed himself to breath fully. Taking in as much air as he could and letting it out slowly.
They were immediately met with mud at least a foot and a half deep. Dean cursed as his boot almost got stuck and he managed to wiggle it free, but not without stumbling. Castiel thankfully caught him before he face planted by grabbing his right wrist and elbow. Dean got his footing back on more dry ground on the edge of the driveway and stood up straight.
“Shit!” Dean caught him under his arms before he hit the floor. He glanced down and saw that he wound had began to bleed again and it soaked completely through Cas’ shirt.
“Don’t ask. Anyway, he was about the same size as you. Let me get those and we can throw your dirty clothes in the wash. While you have a shower, I’ll make us something to eat. Sound like a plan?”
A small smile creeped over Dean’s lips. “Cas. I didn’t have feelings for those girls. There was nothing there. But this?” He motioned between the two of them, the emotion on his face overwhelming. “This is different. Completely different…When you started to avoid me, I thought you didn’t feel the same way. I thought I fucked up everything. Royally.”
Dean dropped the rags onto the floor and immediately went to Cas’ face. He put his hand on his sweat covered forehead and brushed his hair back. He was colder than normal, but he was still breathing.  Dark circles now formed under his eyes and his eyebrows were knotted together.
The hunter looked to the right at the angel next to him. He watched as Cas brought his beer to his lips and took a small sip, a tiny droplet of liquid falling off his lip and down his chin. The angels gaze caught his and he put his drink down. “What?”
Desiree squeezed his hands. “I insist. I got word that your friend will be out for a while. He won’t be waking up alone. I’ll make sure of it. You can come back with me when I start again at 2.”
It clicked in Deans brain what Cas was talking about, and his face immediately hardened. He straightened up and stared into his eyes. “Well, it’s hard to do so when that person won’t stay in the goddamn room for longer than 2 minutes. Maybe that person should’ve reached out. Maybe that person could’ve gotten the help that they wanted if they opened up alittle.”
Before Dean left the room, he lifted up his hand from his lap and covered Cas’ with it, giving it a squeeze, assuring him that he’s here for him and that he’ll be okay, but what happened next he wasn’t expecting.
Sam nodded with a grin, confident that they’ll be fine setting off without him and left the room, leaving the other two alone. The silence came back with a vengeance.
The hunter finally made his way to the bed side. He took in what he saw. There were cuts on Cas’ lips and cheeks. One bigger gash on his eyebrow. His neck was okay, as well as his chest, but Dean’s eyes stopped on the large bandage on Cas’ left side, just below his ribs.
Dean assumed it was because Cas was still weak. He’d been lying in a bed for 3 days straight with barely any exercise. Of course he was tired and weak. Once he’s up and walking out of this sterile bucket of a building, he’ll be good as new.
The hunter glares at him. “Ow.” He deadpans, which makes Cas’ chuckle. Dean sat up and peered into the backseat. “I’ll take the back.”
Dean let out a shaky breath. Thinking about that 5 minutes in the car before he sped to the hospital was starting to make his heart rate skyrocket. He closed his eyes and rubbed his face roughly with his hand before covering his mouth with this palm and resting his elbow on the table. “Thats where I almost lost him….thats when he said his grace was gone and he couldn’t heal himself. I finally saw the gash on him and he was drifting in and out. I had to go get the front bench in the car reupholstered while he was in the hospital cause there was so much blood soaked into the leather…”
“You angels…bless your souls.” The hunter whispered out and Cas chuckled. “There’s stuff in the drawer.”
Dean leaned forward on his elbows on the back of the recliner and let out a long heavy breath. It was over…they were free…they’re finally done.
Dean stepped into the kitchen and saw Desiree at the stove stirring something in a pot and there was a tray with garlic bread beside her on the counter. She looked up and grinned when she saw Dean. “Oh hi! Food is almost ready. I hope you like spaghetti.”
Another flash of lighting shot across the sky, accompanied by a deep explosion of thunder that practically shook the car. Both men froze.
He blinked up to see a redheaded woman looking down at him with slight panic on her face. She wore light blue scrubs and had an ID pass clipped to her chest.
Sam knew his brother more than anyone else in the whole world. Of course he wouldn’t leave well alone.
He stepped forward and rested his hand on the back of Cas’ neck, tears starting to fall. “Cas…you can’t…I…” He watched as Cas let out another sob. “I can’t lose you again. I can’t lo-” his voice completely gave out. He cupped Cas’ face in his hands desperately.
The hunter lifted his head, opening his eyes. The barn was still. There were headless bodies and bodiless heads strewn out everywhere, but it was quiet.
Dean rushed in front of Cas and threw the duffle bag into the trunk and stepped to the passenger seat door to open it for him. They locked eyes in a silent ‘thank you’ and Cas lowered himself in. Dean closed to the door, ran around the back of the car, got in the drivers seat and headed back home.
Dean barely waited for Desiree to stop the car before opening the door and jumping out. When he busted into Desiree’s room after he hung up the call from the hospital, they both quickly got Dean’s clothes out of the wash, changed, and drove down to the hospital. He rushed through the doors to the empty front desk and slammed his fist on the counter. “Hey!”
Dean turned off the car stretched his body out against the seat, wiggling his phone out of his back pocket. He held it up close to the windshield, the drivers window, and then across in front of Cas, searching for a signal. Nothing.
Dean picked up his fork and shovelled some pasta into his mouth. He moaned in satisfaction when he realized how good it was, and then quickly bit off the pasta that was hanging out of his mouth and almost choked.
Dean let out a small laugh. He watched as the ex-angel tilted his head towards him. A small grin appeared on his lips. “How are you, Dean?”
After nearly three months of feeling like an empty paper-thin bag, drifting to the tune of the tides around him, Dean was finally staring in the face of his solution. What he’s hunted down after scouring what felt like the entire world.
A sharp breath erupted into Dean’s lungs as he felt the ex-angel’s lips on his and suddenly the world didn’t matter.
The eldest brother decided to go change out of the clothes he’d been travelling in all day before the pizza arrived. As he walked to his room, he had to pass Castiel’s room. As he got closer, his steps got slower and slower until he was at the door and he stopped. He stared at the brass ’15’ on the door.
“Okay okay, here comes the best part!” Dean grabs Cas’ wrists. He guides one up near Castiels left shoulder and one by his chest. “Do that, and then flick your fingers like his.” He demonstrates with his right hand by flicking his index and middle finger like he is playing the strings of a bass guitar. Cas’ copies him just as the solo bass part plays right after the chorus. The hunter throws his head back and lets out a loud belly laugh.
He glanced over at the hunter. He was slightly leant forward with squinty eyes and he had both hands on the wheel. A few veins were popping on the back of his hand as he gripped the wheel tightly, steering back against the gale force winds that attack his side of the vehicle.
He grinned at Cas who couldn’t help a little smile tease his lips. Dean brought his hands to his torso as he pretended to play guitar with Jimmy Page, his top teeth biting his bottom lip.
He didn’t hear Sam’s footsteps trudge up the small staircase into the library and towards him but the screech of the chair being dragged across the old hardwood floor startled him out of his wordy trance. He glared at his younger brother as he sat down with a thump. Sam froze when he locked eyes with Dean. “Sorry.”
“Hello, Dean,” the featureless figure murmured, soft voice chording across his name in gentle greeting but the reality of the smooth, evenly timbre voice slammed into Dean like a ton of bricks. It was too soft, too feminine- didn’t curl around his name with that fragile adoration. They unfolded with natural grace, rising to their full height in one swift movement and in a blink, Dean was craning his head back just to gaze up at the figure- the man.
Dean shook his head as tears stung his eyes. “We would’ve gone in there with a better plan, that’s for sure.” He looked up and locked eyes with the ex-angel, who looked just as distraught.
It took Dean a minute, but then it occurred to him. Realization dawned over his face and he grabbed Cas’ hands in his own, gripping them tightly.
10 rain logged minutes later, they finally reached the barn. They found an abandoned old Ford truck on cement blocks and hid behind it, kneeling to the ground. Dean held a finger to his lips to signal Cas to stay quiet and he peaked around the trucks front bumper. There were two vamps standing outside the barn door chatting, facing away from the truck. Dean turned back to his accomplice. “Two vamps so far. Who knows how many are inside.” He talked low, knowing that the rain would drown the sound of his voice out anyway.
Castiel sat in the passenger seat, his hand gripping the door handle, his knuckles almost white. He wasn’t usually nervous about weather or driving, but this situation wasn’t sitting well with him. He pursed his lips as he breathed deeply in and out of his nose, his nostrils flaring with every exhale. He had full faith in Dean being able to get them back to the bunker though.
Castiel bit the inside of his cheek. “Yes and no. I mean…I don’t feel physically different. I’m still me, but…there is something…missing.”
He rounds the corner and steps down into the kitchen to find Sam sitting at the table with his laptop in front of him and an empty plate with a few pieces of crust left. The younger brother glances up towards the other hunter and grins, “It lives.”
“I can’t just let it go. You know that. This isn’t a small argument that we had about flipping the laundry. It’s…” Dean bit his lip. He couldn’t bring himself to say anymore than that or his emotions would get the best of him. All he could do is take him as much air as he could into his lungs, hold it for a few seconds and let it back out slowly, trying to calm his nerves and not scream in the angels face. That would do neither of them any good.
Dean swung his machete at the vampire in front of him and the head went flying to the left. He stood there for a second, trying to catch his breath, grunting every exhale, but a pair of hands shoved him in the back and he flew forward into the dirt.
“Anyway, an article came out this morning over in South Dakota. Two couples found in a forest dead, drained of all blood and their throats ripped out.” Sam dragged his finger over the screen as he read the words in the article.
He quickly stood up and looked around him. He spotted the angel fighting off a vamp to his far left. Cas kicked the vamp in the stomach, knocking it backwards and launched at it with a swung of his blade to its neck, the head coming clean off. Cas glanced over and locked eyes with Dean, his mouth agape allowing him to take in more air.
HUGE THANK YOU TO HyFrLarry1224 for being an co-author on this chapter!!! I couldn't have done it without her!
Cas finally reached the bottom of the stairs and let out a relieved huff. Sam stood there, unsure what to do. He glanced at Dean as he reached the bottom of the stairs, hoping he would give him answer. Dean shrugged his shoulders.
In the library, a rush of air blew by with the accompaniment of wing flutters as Dean double checked he had everything he needed in his duffel. Machete? Check. Dead Mans Blood? Check. His dignity and self worth?
Dean glared at the back of the ex-angels head and looked up at Desiree. “He didn’t complain at all when he got himself ready this morning while I was still sleeping.” Dean tilted his head slightly, gesturing to the cot on the opposite side of the room.
The former angel locks his phone and places it on top of Dean’s in the centre console. “Agreed. You look terrible.”
Castiel gritted his teeth and willed his eyes open. Tears instantly fell. “I dont-…I don’t have…any grace…left.” Every word was a challenge to him.
Dean sprung into action. He sprinted to the driver’s seat, turning the car on, and sped onto the road. He google searched the nearest hospital and drove to it. The whole drive, he held the angel’s hand in his as he sobbed.
“Cas, you don’t-“ Dean tried to stop him but the ex-angel was already out of the room before he could finish. He rolled his eyes and waved him off, sitting back in his seat. “Whatever. So, hunt?” He took another swig and paid his attention back to Sam, who was looking at him over the laptop screen with knotted brows. Dean furrowed his. “What?”
Dean introduced Cas to Desiree and they became good friends over the 3 days. Cas enjoyed her company whenever Dean had to leave for any reason.
Sam was taken back. He’s never heard Dean’s voice so soft before. So broken. There was a beat and Dean spoke again.
After 30 excruciating minutes, they finally reached the hospital. He skidded to a stop in the emergency drop off, got out, sprinted around the front of the car and flung open Cas’ door. He started to lift the angel out of the car when he screamed to the sliding doors of the hospital. “SOMEONE HELP ME!!”
The hunter tensed from the sudden voice on his right. He blinked and made a small glance at the angel before looking back at the road. “Uh, yeah Cas? Whats up?”
The brothers carried Cas to the infirmary and laid him gently down on one of the beds, Dean at his head and Sam at his feet. They immediately went to work. Dean ripped off Cas’ now ruined shirt and threw it to the side to find the bandage from the hospital completely soaked. “Shit, shit, shit…Sam!”
It’s 12:30 when Dean finally get the courage to roll out of bed and walk to the kitchen. He stepped down the long corridor away from his room, his feet softly tapping the cold cement floor. He regrets not putting socks on.
“Cas! Don’t die on me now, buddy. Just stay with me, you’ll be fine. Sam! Can you go any faster?!” Dean cried to his brother, who was now unwrapping the new bandage.
Whether it’s his or the vamps, who knows, but the smell is overpowering, and he’s exhausted. There had to be at least 30 or so vamps in this nest, which is uncommon as they usually only stay in packs of 6-8 at most.
“Oh yeah? Hit me.” The older hunter ripped open the case and popped open a can, taking a deep swig. As he sat down on the opposite side of the table, Cas straightened up and huffed through his nose.
“Cas?” Dean gasps out, now gripped with panic. He’s never seen the angel cry before. “Who is that? What’s happening?” his voice cracks.
Dean just hums. Apparently that was a good enough response for him. Sam would beg to differ, but he decides to let it go. He waves him off and heads to the war room. “Good night!” He calls without turning around.
He looked too much like a corpse, laying on his back, arms positioned on his chest to minimize the danger of him falling on the ground. Dean knew he was going to break more than a few speed limits on his way back to the bunker.
Their lips connected, for the second time this day, and certainly not for the last time. The crown of thorns turned into ash.
Dean considered it. Cas was an angel, which meant he couldn't probably die from dehydration, hunger or heart attack, which was good. But it wasn't going to help them with finding the right antidote.
He moved out of reflex, dumbfounded. Jealousy swelled inside his chest like a storm, and there weren't any ration thoughts in his head, only his own heart screaming at him.
Destroying the trench coat was tempting. Too tempting, but it was a part of Cas, his own symbol of resistance. How many people, including the King of hell, the God and his supervisors have told him to lose the coat?
Doing this for Sam, bringing the world to the edge if he needed to, was natural. Sammy was his little brother, he had to protect him for all cost. But Cas wasn't a family by design, by blood. Yet he would do the same for him and more.
"This one goes right through the spine," Sam wondered out loud, dragging the wet cotton across the puncture. "Did he stand after getting impaled or no?"
Garth was right, it wasn't difficult to find a sleeping curse, it was fucking impossible to find the sleeping curse.
"We have to take it out before we try to turn him," said Sam after cataloguing the wounds with clinical approach.
"You're hurt," muttered Cas, their lips a breath apart, his eyes a perfect trap. And of course, the first thing he cared about was Dean, the selfless bastard never noticing that this was about his health in the beginning.
There were cuts visible on his chest where the shirt was torn, but not deep enough or long enough to cause that much blood.
"Have you seen yourself lately?" Sam vaguely pointed to his face, and no, Dean didn't have time to check himself up in the fucking mirror. They had more important things to do.
They both looked at the holes in Cas's back with new understanding. They didn't know how the sleeping curse affected angels. Chances were Cas was the first angel ever hit with this type of curse.
But it was not just them for some time now. The two of them in the front seats, that much went unchanged, but Cas, Castiel, an angel of the Lord, sitting in the backseat, that was mostly new.
"On the ground a few steps behind me. I barrelled it into the centre column, he got thrown against the further wall. I don't think he moved from the place."
They dragged Cas's unconscious form out of the cabin, leaving a bloody trace on the ground behind them.
He kicked her lifeless body for a good measure, Sam rolling his eyes, because he had a reputation to uphold – but Dean knew he wanted to kick the damn bitch as much as he did.
Sam led him right to the library, wait, scratch that, to the infirmary. He struggled to get the doors to open, which was weird – they didn't need any maintenance in the evening. Or rather, in the early morning. Sure, he was tired, but he didn't break the doors on his way out.
Closing his eyes, maybe because that's what people do, maybe for enjoying the full experience – that would probably be his last – he leaned in and pressed his lips, gently, always so gently, to Cas's. They were even more soft than they looked like.
Dean wanted to kiss the strange expression from his face, but he would never be that lucky. He got a taste of the divine, the mundane world was ruined for him now. He got a taste, and that was more than he could've ever hope for.
There was something so absurd about having an Angel with a capital A downgraded to the backseat. They really went and befriended, if it could be called like that, a messenger of the God.
He was sitting next to a nuke bomb, and he felt safe and more at home than the previous night in his own room. He was safe because Cas was safe.
Sam didn't try to fight him, for which Dean was thankful for. They didn't need to fight between themselves, when their angel was possibly dying at their table.
Sam washed his hands and they carried Cas into the infirmary, leaving the interactive map under him bloodied and dirty.
They stood beside Cas's body, Dean arranging the hands, so they wouldn't get broken on top of all that because of incautious manhandling, Sam finding a leverage at Cas's legs.
He couldn't see Sam's reaction, and frankly, he didn't care at this point of the day. Cas was right here, gorgeous as always, and if the only thing that could break the curse was a kiss? Who was Dean to resist.
"I was lying on the ground," he tried to remember how the things went to shit. "The witch was holding you with her left hand and started to draw some symbols with her right hand in my direction."
And at Sam, who stood with his hands raised in 'I surrender' motion, looking like shit. Dean supposed he didn't look any better. How early was it? Eight in the morning? Jesus.
But those were all questions for another time. Now they needed to stop the infection from spreading. They needed to find the antidote and bring Cas back.
The lights went off when Dean pulled the lever, the bunker suddenly becoming a comfortable dark place. Nights were peaceful here, the only monsters hunting him were his own.
"According to Garth, there are literal books focused on them. He said that the witches took great pride in those, seeing as it was hard to distinguish between them."
The worst thing was, that they didn't even need Cas for this particular hunt. They were more than capable of handling it on their own, but Dean couldn't hold back the selfish desire to bring Cas with them. He talked him into it.
But it was Cas who got in the way, not Dean, and he couldn't heal by touch. If he could, he wouldn't have stopped. It was magic, but a good kind of magic.
They became less cautious about their own wounds; about the situations they could've persist. The morning was going to be a bitch.
"Of course I was," Dean rubbed his eyes before his brain caught up with his mouth. "What are we talking about?"
He couldn't see Cas in the rear-view mirror. Maybe it was a good thing, because seeing him there, without any life could've been all too distracting.
They wrapped Cas like a mummy, getting pressure onto the extra holes in his body. The wounds were still bleeding but now they were also cleaned up – there was nothing more to do.
It sounded like a conversation between two mentally ill people. Which they were only partly. Dean tried again.
Dean rearranged Cas's head, letting him rest comfortably on the side, his eyes closed, and lips opened just a little bit. He looked peaceful, more angelic than in a long time.
"What, Sammy?" he asked, because what was so important in this moment? Cas got hit by a curse. A curse meant for him. Now he laid motionless on the ground, his eyes peacefully closed.
Now that Sam mentioned it, Dean could see it too. The gentle rise and fall of Cas's chest, almost invisible under the three layers of clothing and agonisingly slow, four or five times slower than normal frequency.
"I was thinking," said Sam, covered in small cuts from the annoying omnipresent thorns, "why did Cas fall into enchanted sleep when he didn't touch anything pointy?"
"I'm going for my machete," he said, already on his way for the weapon. That's what the prince did, wasn't it? Cutting the roses, getting closer to the sleeping princess in the tower.
But it didn't explain most of the other things. Cas couldn't have killed her if he was sleeping, or before he cured the holes in his back. It just didn't make any sense, the witch couldn't be at two places at the same time.
If it was Dean, the one stricken with the curse, Cas would've just touched him, two fingers to his forehead, and cure him. There was something weirdly intimate in letting your wounds be healed by the power of God.
"Sure," Dean reluctantly said, turning on his heel. He could at least remember in shower where in the library he saw the books about witchcraft.
They managed to bang Cas's head against the roof of the Impala, both sighing as that was typical Winchester thing to do, adding bruises to already wounded flesh. Cas didn't react to the harsh treatment, his breathing uninterrupted.
Dean refused to let go of Cas, holding onto him like it could save them both, drawing him closer into his chest, morbid bridal style, so Sam could reach into his pocket and open the car.
If Cas woke up, it wouldn't have been a problem, just a magic thought and the work was done. But like this, it was on them to keep his vessel alive and well.
Maybe they weren't in a time press, but they still were in a time press. Cas had a hole right through his spine, and who knew how the curse was affecting his Grace.
Dean got into the work. The sleep was not something they could cure right away, but the holes in Cas's body were. The first aid kit in bunker was fully equipped.
The blue tie went off first, and who knew why Cas was still wearing it around his neck. It was easily the worst part of the FBI suits. But it held kind of an appeal – maybe, just maybe Dean could've used the tie to pull Cas to him, closer, and no.
"Sometimes the victims die of dehydration, sometimes the breathing isn't slowed down, sometimes they die because their veins clog with blood. But that's about it when it comes to differences."
"Confusion curse?" tried Dean, picking up the work where he left off. The chatter wasn't going to help Cas.
He sat down on the bed beside Cas's body and leaned in to kiss Cas, to really kiss Cas for the first time.
Dean could feel his knee protest when he took the first steps towards his room, and he heard Sam hiss in pain behind his back. Most of the bruises were on Cas, but they didn't get out of the fight as easily as they should have. Having an angel with healing powers at your side had some perks – the pain was just temporary.
"Hand me the tweezers," he said instead, and it was probably better if he was the one doing all that surgery stuff. Dean might've watch Dr. Sexy, but Sam was usually doing most of the sewing and cleaning.
And that was the only answer, together with the sound of tearing fabric, he knew he would get. They didn't even need to soak the scabs with warm water – they already ripped them raw from Cas's wounds while dismantling the coat.
"Possibly. I hate those Medieval European bitches," said Sam, following the example. "It would explain why the curse was lifted when she died."
Red, the colour of mortal blood, somehow seemed unfitting for an angel. What world was it, when the blood of an angel and that of a mortal man had the same colour?
They were both so accustomed to Cas using his wings only when it came to longer distances that the few feet sounded almost ridiculous. But there was no better explanation.
It wasn't narrow by any means, but they still pulled Cas closer to them, preparing to turn the body. Possibly without adding more damage.
"He will," answered Dean, his stare focused on something too far before them. There was not an option for Cas not to survive the fucking ride. He went through too much to die from a blood loss. "Shut your cakehole and try to figure out what curse it was."
The white shirt Cas always wore was drenched in dry blood, turning it into nauseous brownish-red colour. They managed to carry him inside without any issue, laying him on the table with map.
‘Please send help. We are under attack.’ Ash tilted his head in confusion. Who was under attack? Who needed help? Where was he supposed to send that help? What were they facing. A few of the guests were scrambling about in confusion, a few went back to drinking although all the food had been devoured. “What do you think Ellen?” he asked, looking toward the kitchen and expecting her to come out. However, no one stood near the kitchen door. Alarmed, and recalling the last time the Roadhouse was attacked, Ash dashed to the kitchen and threw open the door. There was no one inside. “Ellen?! Jo?!” Ash looked around frantically for his friends but there was no sign of either of them. Then someone bumped into him, knocking him to the floor. The bright light was back, as was the noise.
“I wonder if he’ll want Sonny to do it. Or Jim Murphy?” Sam started babbling on as he walked away and Ash, not knowing who Sonny was but having other concerns at the moment, ignored him. After helping a few of the other guests decorate, which was difficult because they all had their own ideas on how this wedding should go and just ended with Jack using his God powers to set it how he thought his dad’s would want it, 4pm finally arrived.
“Good, because people are already lining up outside.” She said. Ash rushed to the window to glance out. Jo was right. For a moment he wasn’t even sure if it was for the wedding, the Valentine’s event, or both. A movement in the back caught his eye and he could see Bill making his way through, pushing a barrel with a box on top. Ash let out a relieved sigh when the crowd parted and let the man through without much fuss. He opened the door for Ellen’s husband, holding it open long enough for the man to pass through before pushing it shut again.
“Mom, I picked up the stuff to make the red lava cakes and the little cinnamon red hearts too.” she said. Ellen nodded in gratitude. After a moment another thought occurred to her and she opened her mouth to voice it but Jo just smirked. “Dad’s getting a barrel of rock salt too. We don’t want any demons causing any problems today.” she said. Ellen chuckled. Her daughter was definitely a hunter.
Ash looked at the boarded up building, although there almost wasn’t a point since half of it was just gone. The pool table was still on fire, the tables and chairs were destroyed, and even his gift shop was gone. Heaven won’t be the same until he can rebuilt, which would take about two weeks. However there was more important things to be done. He needed to find Ellen. Jo and Bill had contacted him to let him know they were fine but they hadn’t seen Ellen since the oven caught fire a second time. Ash felt it was his duty to find his friend. He climbed on his motorcycle, pulling down his sunglasses and revved the engine to life. ‘Born to be Wild’ started playing on his helmet radio and Ash turned it as high as it would go before driving off into the sunset.
As Ellen was about to call it quits she noticed a figure in the corner of the screen. She paused it, bringing up the image to make it larger and frowned. Dean Winchester was sitting at the bar while the fight with Ash and Elvis was going on in the back, ordering two beers while his new husband stood right behind him. The punk snuck back in and didn’t even have the decency to give her a hug on his way out? He was in for it now. She pulled out her phone, calling Ash.
They had set up the Roadhouse for the Valentine’s Day party, so there wasn’t really many places to sit. There also wasn’t a specified side for Dean’s guests or Cas’ guests because outside of a few exceptions, everyone practically knew everyone. Jim Murphy ended up being the one Dean asked to officiate the wedding. After all he was the only parental figure for both Dean and Castiel present who was an ordained minister. Castiel didn’t have a father present, as his own was a piece of crap, so instead Amara his aunt, was there along with Claire. For Dean; John, Bobby, and Sonny were all there and since he had multiple mother figures in the form of Mary, Missouri, Jody, and Ellen he had asked Rowena to be the one to go with him. It also put Crowley in a rage. Cas’ groomsmen were Meg, Hannah, Balthazar, Claire, and Gabriel. For Dean it was Charlie, Kevin, Garth, Benny, and Crowley. Jack was the ring bearer and Kaia, Patience, and Alex were the flower maiden’s. And of course, Sam stood beside Dean as his best man.
Dean woke to a humming coming from behind him. He willed his eyes open, glancing at the digital clock on the dresser on the opposite wall, and slowly rolled over in bed.
Cas dragged his tongue over Dean’s lips, and Dean slipped his mouth open, allowing Cas to kiss him deeper and harder, his breath getting louder. He rested his hand on Dean’s hip and grabbed the fabric of his shirt there, pulling towards himself.
The ex-angel opened his eyes and was met Dean’s half lidded green orbs staring back at him. His skin was already glistening with a thin layer of sweat and his lips were parted and the tip of his tongue was resting on his bottom teeth.
The hunters eyes shot open at the whisper of his name and he sat up quickly. He looked to see Castiel looking back at him, the colour slowly starting to come back to his cheeks.
There was a pregnant pause between the two men before Dean curses and punches the steering wheel with the heel of his hand, “Son of a bitch!”
“I made a deal!” the angel snapped. He gritted his teeth. “I had to! I had to get Jack back. It wasn’t his time…”
Blood seeped through the rags slowly, but it was still an alarming amount of blood. Dean bit his lip as he felt a lump start to form in his throat.
The hunter allowed his hands to fall to his sides, the warmth of Cas’ skin immediately leaving his finger tips. Cas stared at Dean, terror in his eyes, but Dean couldn’t look back. His eyes were locked on the woman who now had her hand hovering over Castiel’s shoulder.
The two of them sat there in silence for a bit, the rain still pelting the car violently. The loud pangs of the rain hitting the metal roof above them filled the empty space of nothing next to their breathing and Dean’s occasional click of his tongue.
Once he ganked the two guards outside, he threw open the doors of the barn to see the entire nest. They all turned and looked at him, and Dean could feel the tension in the barn get tight. The air went cold and hair stuck up on the back of his neck.
Warm breath met warm breath as the space between them got smaller and smaller. It was then when Dean realized what changed in him. What came over him.
“I don’t know. I think Jack said he was going to ‘bend the laws of the universe’ or some crap. I guess whoever gets the memo.” Bobby said. The others gave a small nod. That made sense. Jack was Dean, Sam, and Castiel’s son. He would want everyone possible to be able to attend. Ash didn’t know if Jack actually knew what a wedding was, but that was fine.
“And the whiskey? Gwen Campbell and the others were going to bring some of their homemade whiskey…” Ellen started. Ash vaguely remembered the Winchester’s cousins. Gwen, Mark, and Christian if he recalled correctly. Apparently after arriving in Heaven, the hunters hadn’t had too many ideas on what to do with themselves so they started making their own alcohol. Turns out they were pretty good at it and Ash would periodically order some for the bar. Since it was Dean’s wedding day, they were donating the whiskey for free.
Ellen made her way back inside and went to the main office. She found the security cameras and decided to look through them just to see what she missed. It looked like everyone had fun, even if it was going to take weeks to fix this. And they had Saint Patrick’s Day coming up too. People were going to expect them to have an event for that day too.
“Stand up?” Andy sounded confused, like he didn’t actually remember that he was supposed to perform a stand-up routine. Ash wasn’t worried.
Ash had no idea how long they were going at it when a loud whistling sound overcame everything. He quickly put his hands over his ears, trying to block it out and saw many of the guests doing the same. Then everything erupted. The building shook so hard everyone fell over and a bright light blinded him. Ash closed his eyes until the sound faded before slowly getting up. Looking around he was horrified! Half of the building was just GONE! The guests were scrambling about, some talking about who they need to fight in order to get back to their party and a few even hiding under the tables. Hoping to discover the identity of the culprit, Ash scrambled around the bar only to find Enochian writing etched into the floor.
“Don’t trust him.” Ash quickly said. Sure, there were all kinds of angels, demons, and monsters at the event but you should never trust a stranger wearing a mask.
“The Five Hundred Bacon Roses.” The man said. Ash paused at that. He didn’t put in an order for that. Then again now that he thought about it, this had Aaron Bass’ name all over it. The man loved bacon, probably more so than Dean. Ash gave a quick nod to show he understood before taking the clipboard and signing. “Where would you like them set up?” the delivery man asked. Ash waved in the general direction of the pool table. It didn’t matter where they set them up, the food would be devoured anyway.
“Oh crap! I forgot the pie! Wait, do we need pie?” Ellen trailed off. It was Dean’s wedding day, he would demand pie. She didn’t want to send Jo out again, but Dean would be heartbroken if he didn’t get at least one pie today. Ash waved the concern off.
“Was the ‘No Clowns Allowed’ sign really necessary?” Jo asked, coming into the bar with a number of bags. Ash gave her an offended look.
“Dr. Badass!” Ash answered from the other side. She could hear his motorcycle’s engine in the background.
“We got those thousand pies in the fridge.” he said. A few days ago a delivery of one thousand pies arrived at the Roadhouse. There was only a single note attacked to them, saying ‘from a friend’. Ash used his old computer hacking skills to track the shipment back to a place called Family Business Beer Company. He wasn’t completely sure, but he thinks ‘Sister Jo’ had something to do with it.
“You partied and left me with the fights?” he yelled. After a moment he sounded much calmer. “I would have done the same. Anyway, we’re starting repairs next week. I’m taking a break.” Then the line went dead.
The next week wasn’t much better. Cas let the brothers take care of him when he needed it by bringing him food, a change of clothes. He would have good, long conversations with Sam, but whenever Dean tried to talk to him, or give him any attention really, Cas would close himself off. He wouldn’t engage him in conversation, he wouldn’t acknowledge him when he was in the room, and when he did, it was a small ‘Hello’ or a nod of the head and nothing more.
All that mattered was this crushing feeling of want, and need, and longing for this other being that Dean had never felt before.
Another light bulb explodes above his head, and luckily the thick material of his jacket and jeans save his skin from being burned.
A small smiled creeped over Desiree’s lips. “Okay, Dean. Your vitals seem to be okay. Your iron is low though so that could’ve contributed to the attack as well.” She picked up her stethoscope from the counter and hung it around her neck. They were in a small examination room and Dean was sat on one of those paper covered beds. “Do you have a history of panic attacks or anxiety?”
Cas nodded and walked around the bed. He still had a small limp because of the wound on his side, but he could walk. Dean wanted to stay near just incase. The entire journey out of the hospital and to the impala, Dean stayed close to Cas’ right side, his hand just hovering at his back, ready to catch him if needed. Once they walked through the automatic doors, the cool morning air enveloped them and blew the awkward tension between them away. Dean grabbed Cas’ elbow when they reached the curb and the hunter stepped down first and gripped tightly as Cas’ stepped down gingerly. No hisses, or winces. Good.
He grabbed all the supplies and ingredients he needed. Bowl, chalk, herbs, a knife, a growler of holy oil and some candles and packed everything in a duffle. He rushed to the impala and sped out of the garage. He knew of an abandoned barn maybe 30 minutes away down highway 281 so he headed there.
“You weren’t close enough.” Cas said, his voice barely a whisper. “I needed to know that you were actually there.”
He pours a large ring of the oil behind the sigil, at least 7-8 feet in diameter, making sure to go over it twice so there is a solid perimeter of the substance, and then he lights it. Orange flames illuminate his face, pitting his eyes and highlighting his cheekbones. He’s been doing this long enough to do it properly, but his gut still knots, a small hint of insecurity of what may or may not show up. They say three times a charm but who knows if he’ll make it to three?
Castiel spun around, but not fast enough. The vampire attacked him, slamming him to the ground and screamed in his face. Cas brought his arms up to cover his face from the vamp’s retched fangs, but the vamp snapped at the fabric blocking Cas’ skin.
And yet, the hesitation still clung to him. His breath turned ragged as he hooked his glasses on the bridge of his nose and squinted down at the crumpled paper. In the low lighting, the scribbled handwriting was harsh and nearly illegible. As if that mattered. As if he hadn’t memorized it.
It almost felt like a normal ride. He was at the steering wheel, like so many times before, Sam right next to him. It was so long just them two and their Impala against the world.
"Thank the fucking God," Sam laughed, laughed of all things, with mischievous sparks in his eyes. "I was really afraid for a moment that you'll let me do it."
The tired look Sam sent him answered all questions that could've been asked. They were both exhausted from the hunt, up for more than thirty-six hours and in desperate need of some regenerating.
Sam's fingers cupped Cas's face, and Dean felt like a drowning man, like his only purpose served for this moment. He was supposed to be the one saving Cas, not Sammy. If there was anything he knew with certainty, it was this.
Cas shifted. Maybe to get some reasonable distance between them, personal space has never been his strongest suit. Maybe because he was uncomfortable. But this wasn't the day for distance, not when Dean just got him back.
"He was very helpful," Sam said, sarcasm leaking into his words like poison. "Supposedly it's impossible to find the right spell without the witch that caused it."
He made a move to get up, not being used to lying on his back, not in his angel form. Their moment was supposed to be broken with the change, but the air remained charged with electricity. Cas sat straight next to Dean, on the edge of the bed. Their shoulders were touching.
"Yeah, sure, night," Sam muttered, making a beeline for his own room. He deserved the break. It wasn't even his mistake.
"I think," Sam took a deep breath, considering his words like the wrong ones could kill him, "I think he's sleeping."
He made his way to the doors, looking at Cas's sleeping face illuminated by the light of the backup generator, his black hair in contrast to the white bedsheet.
He pried the barn door open with the crowbar with minimal effort and the latch on it snapped. The rust almost eroded the whole thing useless. He was surprised no kids broke in yet and trashed the place. As he stepped in, he noticed it still had equipment in it like an old rusty tractor to his right and a hay elevator on the left. Pitchforks and saws hung on the pillars lining the center aisle and he spotted a wagon wheel hanging high on the back wall in front of him.
“I was saying your name while I was asleep. I guess they knew I was speaking of you and they called you.”
The apartment was big. White walls and salt and pepper carpet. The beige living room furniture in front of him were arranged into a square in the corner facing the large flat screen TV. An archway leading into the kitchen which was a light shade of purple was on his left and two doors were on his right on the far wall. Obviously bedrooms.
He was immediately greeted with a smell of onions and bread and his mouth started to water. His stomach rumbled loudly.
As they walked into the bunker and swung the large metal door closed, Sam jogged into the map room. “Hey!” He started to come up the stairs, but Dean held his hand out over Cas’ shoulder. “He said he can do it.”
Dean flipped over onto his back just as a vamp jumped on him, straddling him, locking him to the ground. It launched for Dean’s neck but the hunter blocked it with his arm. He fought the vamps strength, but he knew he couldn’t last much longer. With one final burst of adrenaline, he brought the blunt end of the machete up and whacked the vamp in the temple, which deterred it enough for Dean to come back with the blade and slice.
Dean shook his head, “I was more focused on not dying. He’s was hurting, I knew that much, but we needed to get out of there. Anyway, I finally got him to the car and that’s…” his voice drifted off and he looked down at the glass.
“Sir! There’s already too many people in there. You need to wait out here. We’ll come back as soon as possible with an update.”
Dean’s boots scuffed against the splintered, rotted flooring. He was struggling to find traction as the invisible force slammed against him in current after current; exposed wires and exploding light bulbs sending dangerous sparks into the already over charged air. Singed hair and burning wax clogged his nostrils and despite the force of the wind, the flames rising from the Holy oil miraculously didn’t go out. They bend against the force, licking across the floor in bursts of orange and yellow yet not charring a single thing in its path.
“Yes. Yeah. Let’s go.” He adjusted his bag on his shoulder. He spun away from Cas, looking both ways down the street, making sure no one was coming and the two of them  made their way into the driveway.
Cas glanced up at the hunter and quickly looked back down at what he was doing. It took him a few seconds but he mustered up the courage to reply. “Hello.”
The rain still didn’t let up. If anything, it was raining harder now and Dean had to turn on the windshield wipers faster to be able to see the road lines. They turned left onto 195th street and drove up to a dirt driveway just angled off the road.
With a smile, Desiree walked over and stood at the foot of the bed. “So, Castiel, it’s time for you to go home. How are you feeling?”
Dean straightened up, clearing his throat. He stepped closer to the angel and placed his beer down on the table next to them. “Alright….Cas I-”
“Ecce sto-” he began weakly, a feeble attempt at casting his voice in the room. Clearing his throat again, he shook out the paper and ran a shaking palm across the surface, trapping it in his grasp. “ut ostenderet se superiori petendo a tua et dirige maius metam...”
With the kiss now broken, they could get a good look at each other. Cas on his back, suit jacket open and tie flung over his shoulder, hair sticking out every which way. Dean looming above him, lips red and swollen. The hunter couldn’t fathom it. This moment. It was actually happening. It had been a long 11 years.
“Thanks!” Dean quickly rushed to the stairs and booked it up to the second floor. He swung the door to the floor open and quickly glanced at the sign on the wall. 200-250 to the left, 251-300 to the right. Dean sped walked down the hall to his left until he reached door #203.
Castiel held his hand out and Desiree handed him the clip board. He scribbled something on it, who knows if it was his name or not, and handed it back to her, swiftly. Desiree cleared her throat and hugged the clipboard to her chest. “Thank you. Well…I guess that means you’re off.”
“Alright Mr. Winchester,” Desiree put one last trip of medical tape over the gauge on Dean’s forehead, “All patched up.”
and pressed the green button on the screen. “Dean? Whats up? It’s 4 am?” All Sam heard on the other end was a sniff. Sam immediately swung his legs off the side of the bed. “Dean? What happened?” his voice went flat.
Cas reached over and opened the drawer in the side table and found lube and condoms. He grabbed both. He pulled off his underwear, ripped open the condom and rolled it on. He squirted some lube on his hand and slicked his fingers. Dean gripped the headboard again as Cas lifted one of Dean’s legs up and over his shoulder. He circled his index finger around his hole before pushing in. The hunter tightened around him.
Dean bowed his head and started walking again, staying on the drier edge of the driveway, the angel trailing behind. He hoped it was dark enough to hid his blush that creeped over his cheeks.
The hunter undid the button on his jeans and zipped down the fly, and with the waistband now loosened, placed his hand on top of Cas’, and guided it down into his pants and cupped his ass, which made him gasp into Cas’ mouth.
Castiel lifted his head and glared at the hunter, hard. “Do you ever listen to anyone else but yourself?”
Dean snickered, “Sammy, you dog!” Sam shook his head in embarrassment, “No, I’m sorry, you and her have been tip toeing around each other for too long. I started to think something was up.”
Dean nodded his head and swallowed. “Yeah, yeah….I’m good.” He pushed himself up from the floor and sat up, his vision going white. His stomach churned  from the movement and the hunter groaned.
Dean shook his head when he heard ‘find a place to stay’. “No no, I can’t do that. I can’t leave him here alone. What is he wakes up and I’m not here? What if he doesn’t know where he is?” Dean’s heart rate started to climb again and his breathing got laboured.
He summoned Jack, after consuming a whole bottle of scotch in his entertainment room. He locked the door to keep Sam out and out of the way because he knew that he would stop him. Talk him out of it.
Dean bit his lip and started to move his hand up and down, creating more warmth and friction between skin and cotton, and Cas started to unravel. The sensation was unreal to him, and Dean was so good at it.
Sam nodded, “Well, yeah. It’s been kinda the elephant in the room all week. Did you guys have a fight or something? I’ve barely seen you two talk, let alone say even a full sentence to each other. He won’t stay in the room if you’re there. What happened?”
“But when you…you know…all that was in my head was the girls you met at bars and brought back here.”
The emotions going through Dean’s head were out of control. He was angry, and scared. But my god, was he heartbroken.
“It’s alright. Just…listen to me. I have an idea. I live just down the road. My shift is over in 20 minutes. How about you go back to the waiting room and once I’m done, you can come stay at my place tonight? I’ll feed you. You can have a little rest. I have a guest room.”
A shorter one, but I think this is going pretty well so far! While writing this fic, I have been listening to kwajbasket non-stop. I'll most likely be editing the chapter titles later to titles of songs that go well with each chapter.  Anyway, enjoy!
Cas’ eye darted to something behind Dean and he turned around to see a woman standing there. Dark brown wavy hair, just falling past her shoulders. Her grey pants suit neatly pressed.
“Alright,” he said with a huff. “My car ain’t getting down there unless we want to get stuck. We’re gonna have to foot it.” He looked at Cas who then nodded. Dean zipped up his jacket all the way and they got out of the car and rounded to the trunk. Dean grabbed his duffel with all the weapons they needed, plus a couple of syringes of Papa Campbell’s vampire cure, just in case. Cas made sure he had his angel blade on him. Dean closed the trunk and swung his bag over his shoulder. Him and Cas caught eyes. The rain was pelting them in the face but Dean could care less at the moment. He watched as the rain drops hit the angels spikey hair, flattened it and dripped off. Dean bet that he looked the same, but the way that the water rolled down the angels stubbled skin…Dean could barely contain his small grin and tiny sigh that sneaked past his lips.
Desiree nodded, “You’re welcome. If you boys are ever back in town, give me a ring. You know where I am. I also wanna meet this younger brother of yours.” She smirked up at Dean and winked. He chuckled.
They do this for 2 more songs, jamming along playing air guitar and Dean using every surface in reach as a drum, slapping his hands with confidence even if he wasn’t on beat. Even slapping Cas’ arm a couple times. “Anything is fair game!”
With three more thrusts, Cas was coming hard. He thrusted through it and Dean suddenly came a second time, right after.
Right off the bat, Sam doesn’t believe him. He wants to press further but he knows that Dean will end up shutting him down so he doesn’t. Instead, he stands up. “Alright then. It’s late so I’m gonna call it.”
The older hunter jumped out of his thoughts and looked up at Sam. “You with me? You zoned out for a second there.”
“When I woke up the first time, it was maybe 6 am. I was alone in that room. The lights were off, it was dark and no one was there. I was quite lonely, but I was so weak I almost immediately fell back asleep.” Castiel kept his gaze down at his hands in between his knees. “Then, you were suddenly there when I woke up the second time.”
Dean just stared at her, void of emotion. He could barely understand what the last 8 hours were, let alone what she is saying to him at the moment.
“Hell yes.” Dean hung the towel over the back of a chair and sat down at the table. Desiree grabbed two plates from the cupboard, filled them up with pasta and bread and brought them both over to the table, placing one down in front of Dean. “Bon Apetit!”
“What do you want Dean?” Cas asked as he tightened his grip on Dean’s thigh, digging his nails into the skin.
Sam unwrapped the wrap and started to go around Cas’ torso with it, pulling it tight on the opposite side from the wound.
Cas shook his head. “That is not true. Dean, I…” Cas paused to think about what he was about to say. “I never experienced these feelings before. They discouraged the use of emotions in heaven, so I was conditioned to never feel them and well…I didn’t know what to do except distance myself.”
He couldn’t place it, or name it, but his body started moving before his mind could comprehend what was happening. He left the chair behind him and his other hand seemed to float up to Cas’ cheek and rest softly on it.
“Well…” Cas starts to speak, but stops. He hasn’t thought about it really. He’s just been going with the motions. He’s been human before, years ago, but that was such a minuscule moment in time that he didn’t really remember what it was like. Now, it’s more permanent. He had to give up his grace to come back to earth. The only way he could escape and leave The Empty was if he left his grace behind. Human’s don’t belong in The Empty. If he had no grace, he wasn’t an angel, and he would be cast out, which is exactly what happened not even two weeks ago.
