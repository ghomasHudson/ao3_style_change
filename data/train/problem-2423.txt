“Yeah, buddy, I know you are, but maybe you shouldn’t keep being sorry and just… not do shit that hurts people in the first place. Jack’s god now, we don’t have any big cosmic dicks after us anymore, so don’t go feeling like you should still be running around behind me and Sam’s backs making suicide deals.” He tries really hard not to sound angry about this, and mostly, he’s not. He’s worried. He’s afraid.
“Fine,” he agrees, mostly because they’re already here so they may as well finish the task at hand even if he doesn’t particularly care about having more than one necktie.
“Dean, I have to go to therapy, can this possibly wait another hour?” Cas groans. “And why are you watching porn this early to begin with?”
. The Islanders shove their way into the attacking zone and are, annoyingly, immediately called on an offside. Castiel makes a note of this to bring up during their next practice, the checking line needs to be more mindful of that going forward.
The most important thing is that Victor wins the faceoff and the Islanders make it back into the Devils’ end of the ice. Passes, passes, and more passes, nobody has bothered to try actually shooting the puck. A Devil intercepts and flies away with it, or at least tries to.
Cas leaves just before the end of group to meet his psychiatrist… or so he thinks. It’s actually his brother Raphael waiting for him. Cas doesn’t appreciate this at all. Because of his autism as much as his alleged psychosis, he doesn’t have agency over his own life. That means Raphael is in charge, and Cas doesn’t get to leave the hospital until Raphael says so. But Cas is also horribly aware that Raphael doesn’t like him, and so he’ll never be allowed out.
but you weren’t ten seconds ago and you’re not supposed to sleep in here,” he chuckles. “I’m sure your mattress is much more comfortable in any case.”
“Sammy, how do you not understand how long I can hold a grudge?” he snarks, folding his arms over his chest. “I do not and will never trust you with my car. You drive in emergencies and that’s it, capiche?”
“Yeah, but… here.” Dean grabs his tie and messes with it briefly. Castiel puts effort into not flinching away from the physical contact. “Did someone teach you to tie those or were you just kinda left to figure it out for yourself?”
“I can’t handle this shit right now, okay? There’s just way too much going on, and we’re sitting around with our junk in our hands waiting for the devil to come after us, and there’s Gabe’s whole angel-thing and… me being anything less than straight kinda has to go on the back burner. It ain’t important compared with everything else. So let’s just shelve it for a better time.”
At the top of the stairs, Cas stops when he hears someone pounding extremely hard on the door of the house. There’s no thoughts attached to the noise of the door opening until other noises follow it, noises that he knows from tv are sounds of pain.
“In four weeks the splint comes off, once I have my hand free a long list of things will be considerably less difficult.”
“Okay. So, we’ll try and figure that out for you, too. Bobby, you remember anything in your books that matches up with what he just said?”
“Sure, she’s over in the K section. I’ll holler when it’s time to leave. Don’t go wandering around anywhere else.”
Dean doesn’t say anything for a minute, mostly due to mild shock. Eventually, quietly: “I’m sorry that happened to you, Cas.”
Cas turns out to be right. So from that point until everyone starts grouping up waiting for dinner, Dean describes some of the most random-ass shit he’s ever heard of out of this book, which gets Jack to giggle every so often alongside Cas’ running commentary on the curses themselves. And it’s so weirdly normal that Dean forgets how weird normal actually is for him, or the fact that he should even find normal to be weird at all.
“I wouldn’t do that. Dean, I’m concerned that the reason you aren’t angry with me at the moment is that you don’t fully understand the gravity of every wrong turn I’ve made.”
believe trying to restart the apocalypse is a great idea? Look at the facts here, Raph. God brought Cas back after Stull-” Castiel absolutely does not see any need to correct him on that. “-but didn’t reopen the Cage. I think it’s safe to say He actually doesn’t want the end of days on Earth to keep going.”
Angel? What angel? There shouldn’t be any angels here at this time. Castiel is it at the moment and only because he’s time-displaced.
“Why didn’t you ask for help?” his brother asks while picking at the base of his wing where apparently there are at least a dozen burgeoning coverts that are also ingrown.
Dean nods and smiles a little bit, and Cas chooses to believe now that Dean understands just how much “everything” actually is.
“I think I hurt my hand.” Dean’s proud of himself for his voice sounding mostly normal as he offers that massive understatement. “It’s fine.”
No, that’s wrong too. If an angel wanted to gank someone they’d do it themself, and - fuck, fuck, how does Dean know that? It’s starting to drive him up a god damn wall. He gets up from the pew and paces a little.
“Cas, you don’t fucking get it, okay? It ain’t about punishment or whatever. I gotta work with other hunters sometimes and if Sammy and me need their help to get a case done, to
“Oh, this is - I don’t believe this,” is Dean’s response. It feels natural because Dean has always had such a mentality, that hard facts must back things up, but Castiel can see tiny threads of doubt in his friend’s face. It’s interesting to contemplate.
No answer. Of course there’s no answer, Dean’s over here bearing his soul or whatever and Cas ain’t even listening. Dean doesn’t know what else to do, and he doesn’t know how to get outta here, so he sits down for awhile with his head in his hands until eventually his ass goes numb and he has to stand up again.
“I ain’t asking you to explain yourself to me, you stupid sunuva bitch, I’m tryna get you to see that you were wrong,” he interrupts. “And the sooner you realize that, the sooner you can finish mopping up the giant mess you made. Now I don’t know what you said exactly to get Dean so down like he is, but you better fix it quick ’fore I lose my sense’a humor about this and kick your ass.”
This gets the nurse to tell him about being too dependent on his friends - as if he has any other friends at all to be dependent on. Her “soothing” tone grates on him and just makes him angrier. He refuses to respond further because this entire interaction is exhausting. All he wants is to see Dean but that’s not allowed, not for another four days.
“Has it ever occurred to you that there’s a reason you still haven’t made it beyond the third line on any team despite it being your thirteenth season of professional hockey?” Castiel demands. “It’s precisely because of behavior like this. You’re notoriously uncooperative with your teammates and you’ve made no efforts to improve your disposition, to say nothing of the fact that you repeatedly and deliberately get on the nerves of whichever head coach is saddled with you at the moment. When your contract expires five and a half seasons from now and they don’t re-sign you, I can almost guarantee that your reputation is such by this point that you’ll be forced into free agency because no team will want you.”
Cas stretches and groans, then struggles himself off the couch entirely while stuffing his phone back in his pants pocket. He should have a snack (he does still have a snack or two as far as he’s aware) and then make a second attempt to buy groceries. First, though, his weight blanket needs to go back to what’s currently serving as his bedroom.
“I saw it happen so many times. But I don’t understand the mechanics involved.” His eyes open a little. “How do humans choose their mates?”
He’s been at this hospital for three months, institutionalized for a total of six and a half. By now it nearly escapes his memory how to live in a small, ordinary apartment where Raphael would appear every four weeks to check on him. The fixing of his own meals (usually in a microwave), the washing of his own laundry (assuming he didn’t forget to buy detergent), watching the same two tv shows on Netflix over and over because they made him smile (and there were no other good programs to choose from because Netflix, objectively speaking, is awful).
remember what Dean said, it’s a trick, that demon is really a patient like he is - appears briefly. “Cas, you got visitors.”
I MADE IT TO ONE HUNDRED SUBSCRIBERS ON THIS FIC. That's amazing and I think I'm going to stop keeping track now, no exaggeration that's
“That’s not what I said.” Death watches him without blinking and Castiel is beginning to see why humans don’t enjoy being stared at. “Over the course of our conversation, I’ve taken the liberty of looking ahead to see what becomes of you and your chosen bacterium if your future had unfolded on its current trajectory, and I have to say I’m extremely unimpressed with the idea of Dean bearing the Mark of Cain and then releasing the Darkness in the process of having it removed.”
“Dean Michael Winchester, you have nothing to apologize for,” Castiel tells him, as forcefully as possible without sounding angry or reproachful.
“Guess!” Gabriel grins, infuriatingly gleeful from where he’s now sitting at the top of a bookcase and kicking his feet through the air.
“Since when?” he demands, jumping out of bed and shoving Cas back a couple steps with his hands. “You let fucking-” He chokes around Alastair’s name and swallows the word back down. “You let him kick my ass in that room and I almost died, then you pop up in the hospital and don’t heal me. Now you’re here and I
“Sock-puppeted, Cas.” Dean comes back into the kitchen holding a bottle of whiskey by the neck, not even bothering with a tumbler. “It’s sock-puppeted.”
right to get pissy right now. “My meddling time-jumping counterpart did all of it for me. I don’t know what he said to Dean, but whatever it was clearly left a strong enough impression to stop me from making any progress at redeeming myself.”
Very importantly, Castiel has completed Dean’s nest. So tonight, instead of research, he’s taking some time to reflect. The process of winning over a prospective mate is more complicated when pursuing a human rather than an angel, but in truth Castiel has never taken any interest in doing so until now. He understands that he’s flawed, there’s something fundamental that was miswired during his creation, and this flawed part of him is what felt drawn to a desperately sad human with a beautifully luminous soul. Castiel is broken and Dean Winchester is exceptional. They’re so mismatched that by all logic there should be no common ground between them, and yet here they are.
Dean’s mood swings and generally unpredictable disposition aren’t unfamiliar to Cas, but usually they entail “bad mood,” “worse mood,” “inconsolably sad,” and “homicidally violent.” Until the past three seconds of this morning, he hasn’t seen Dean in anything even
Light flares from the eyes and mouth of the enemy angel they just stabbed and Castiel notes the wing color - a warrior, yes, but still an ordinary angel.
For a second he’s jealous that Sammy’s gonna get to have quality family bonding time with Mom, but then he realizes that between Sam
“Awesome,” Dean grumbles, probably sarcastically. “Alright, he’s driving up to see me tomorrow during visiting hours, I’ll call him and tell him to bring all his legal shit.”
They will speak about Dean’s actions, and soon, but for now there’s another (arguably more pressing) conversation that needs to take place. Castiel tells Dean and Jack to sit together for awhile and watch one of those historically inaccurate cowboy films Dean’s so fond of, promising to come back shortly to enjoy it with them after he resolves one minor issue.
Dean has no fucking idea how he should do this actually… thank god (heh) Sammy’s not here to see it and make fun of him. He puts his hands together and closes his eyes like in the movies.
Sammy,” Dean snarls, jabbing a finger at his brother. “Don’t you fucking dare say what I think is about to come outta your mouth right now.”
The nurse only goes away when Dean gets off the bed, which leaves Cas with an abrupt shock of much cooler air across his entire back. He rolls over and sits up.
“Of course, I asked him first… several times,” he admits. “Sam, I always ask first. I wouldn’t ever betray his trust by behaving otherwise. It’s even convenient for him, because he wakes up in the kitchen with coffee already waiting for him.”
“Yes. That’s what finally got me sent here. But it wasn’t true. I didn’t want to die, I was trying to fly. Apparently the fire department will arrive to retrieve you when you attempt to leap off of things.”
What convinces Castiel of the further passage of time is how the messages gradually change. Dean’s sadness becomes chronic, desperation morphing to despair. He wishes for Dean’s anger rather than this sinking depression. But Dean is no longer willing to fight back against the crushing loss. There have been innumerable other crushing losses for Dean prior to this one. To use a human expression… this must have been the straw to break the camel’s back.
“Not even tiny harmless pranks? I want to be the fun uncle! Samsquatch will only show her how to read five books per day and make salt shells!”
He tells his captain everything he observed from the past thirty seconds of play. “I thought you might want to know. You don’t have to do anything with this information, it’s just what I saw.”
“I didn’t, I inherited it,” he admits. “It hit a hundred and twenty thousand miles and Gabriel essentially decided he wanted a new truck, so he gave me the Tacoma and bought himself a used but newer truck with considerable help from his tax return that year. I pay insurance every six months… which I suppose has lapsed by now.
“That wasn’t directed at you, Dean.” Cas rolls his eyes. “Regardless, I did tell him to find a more appropriate method of pursuing you going forward. You’re welcome.”
“I know, you’re both forgiven,” she dismisses. “Cas, why didn’t you get married? You should’ve gotten married before you adopted him, I think you’d be a lot less stressed out-”
The puck drops and they explode into motion. Crowley smacks it sideways and Castiel jumps backwards with it, away from an advancing winger. A foot up from his own blue line he tosses it to
Sammy stomps out of the kitchen like a toddler having a fit. Which isn’t even a fair comparison, because Jack is a toddler but he doesn’t throw fits. Dean snorts and goes back to his beer, definitely not feeling the equivalent of Cas doing an impatient foot-tapping in back of his brain. Nope. Nothing there. Cas is totally fine.
“Quit starin’,” Dean groans, despite not opening his eyes yet and having no way to know that that’s exactly what Cas is doing.
Dean slaps the angel’s arm away from him and sits up. For a second he thinks something’s off about Cas, but then he decides he doesn’t care and ignores it. “Thought you ain’t allowed.”
It’s him and Benny and Harry and Ed who go out first, which is… not great. Normally for a four-on-four Dean and Benny are with Cole and Crowley, but with Cole boxed that can’t actually happen. Plus, with the intermission to calm him down, Dean’s pain isn’t being dulled by the adrenalin of play anymore and it feels like his entire lower arm is screaming at him. The only reason he can keep his hand on his stick at all right now is because his gloves naturally keep his fingers in a loose grip just by the way they’re designed.
“Nothing, just-” Dean shakes his head and spoons Cas some more pudding before answering. “Man, it’s a damn shame, that’s all. You’re a really handsome guy and now your face is all fucked like that, I know it’s gonna get better eventually but… damn. You’re gonna have no luck with the fellas for awhile.”
This earns him some type of vicious expression that he as always can’t really read. “Last season we were in the bottom wildcard spot for playoffs and Florida beat us out in the first round. It stands to reason that Dean must have at least
He wakes up and has breakfast like always, but after that the routine is abandoned. He gets dressed in his own clothes instead of pajamas - jeans, t-shirt, sweatshirt, shoes but no socks because socks are his nemesis. He doesn’t put on the light autumn jacket that he was admitted to the first hospital with, instead electing to tug one of Dean’s flannels over top of his sweatshirt. He has discharge paperwork and stacks upon stacks of bee doodles, plus the rest of the flannels and his weight blanket. All of these are piled into a reusable grocery bag. His cell phone and wallet and keys are all returned to him.
“If anyone else besides John Winchester was head coach, we would be a team that takes the Stanley Cup in the postseason,” Castiel points out bluntly. “Improvements clearly need to be made, why shouldn’t I be the one to make them?”
Jack’s wings flutter a little bit and the feathers puff up happily when Dean says that. “I’m learning to be an archangel,” he informs Bobby proudly.
“It’s entirely possible,” he agrees. “But it needed to be said and I’m not taking it back. I’m sure there’s some reason you haven’t already attempted this, and I won’t tell you which actions you should take. But changes need to be made, and soon.”
“Because my god damn eyes hurt,” he gripes. “Too many words. I need a beer if I’m gonna keep doing this…”
Dean has about two seconds to make this choice, probably. His instincts say Cas is telling the truth but his broken trust says Cas is lying. Dean’s been a hunter for most of his life, though, so instinct always wins. He shucks his jacket and drops it on the circle so that Cas has just enough space to step through, and right as Cas mojos the rest of the flames to nothing the door is ripped off the panic room. Shit, Bobby’s gonna be pissed about that.
sinks in, Lucy: every bad, awful thing that’s ever ‘happened’ in your life is something you did to yourself, you self-absorbed bastard.”
“What exactly was your thought process behind allowing that to happen?!” he bellows. “There was more than enough time for you to call for medical help or take some kind of action yourself, and yet you
“Okay. And while you were busy stalking me like the superfan of a Hollywood A-lister, you still never figured out you should’a just asked me for help? Y’know what was going on that morning, Cas? I was so fucking hungover it took me like four hours after I woke up to even stand upright. I slept on the couch the night before for putting my fist through the bathroom mirror. Okay, I was never-” Dean chokes on his own words for a second and has to force them out. “I was never happy there. I wasn’t okay. And I would’a taken any excuse to get out, I just never came up with one good enough until Sammy showed up again. You could’a got me outta there but you didn’t.”
Now he just feels like a dick, because he didn’t even think of that. So he nods. “Thank you.” He does the sign. “Sorry for - uh, yelling. I’m worried about him, too.” He’s such a bastard.
Castiel slips closer to the Prince of Hell’s holding pen, further dampening his grace and beginning to feel pain the way humans feel it behind his vessel’s chest wall. It’s a struggle not to gasp sharply for air, but he needs to be as covert as possible. He tucks his wings uncomfortably tightly against his back. The heat of this place is becoming noticeable.
“Gabe, you don’t like to be helpful,” Sam points out. “You do help sometimes but mostly you just fuck with people.”
“Morning,” he says slowly, not a hundred percent awake yet. His wings twitch slightly behind him. “How was your hunt?”
Without electric-type lighting, the depths of the area are swallowed by darkness. Castiel wonders if his true angelic senses are being dampened intentionally or if the nature of this place simply strips him almost fully down to the limited perception of his human vessel. Some of his awareness remains: he can feel the presence of the occasional reaper lingering among the bookcases, but he’s frustratingly unable to see or hear them and that by itself is extremely unnerving. To distract himself he focuses on the smell of wood and old paper and candle wax that sits in the air here, deciding that it’s far from an unpleasant combination. That’s about the only thing he likes. Everything else is putting him through unfamiliar levels of dread.
They’re silent for some time after that. Castiel recalls with a great well of sadness what happened in Lucifer’s crypt, how Dean had reached him at the last second and loosened Naomi’s hold just enough to interrupt her using him as a weapon to commit murder with.
If he’s honest with himself, Cas doesn’t mind having Dean look after him in any way. According to the tv, many people tend to find such circumstances belittling or humiliating, especially men. But Cas would be happy to be the main object of Dean’s attention until the end of time. He knows it gives Dean a sense of purpose, and it also makes him feel cozy and safe in a way he’s not sure he’s ever experienced until now. (If he has, he doesn’t remember it.)
“Okay.” Dean nods a little bit and then sinks into the pillow and the awful, shitty mattress from the 50s. He doesn’t mean to fall asleep and when he wakes up again it’s been like a day and a half. “Sammy?”
His fingers curl just a little into those collars. He thinks there must be a necktie underneath. A dress shirt and a necktie and a rough coat.
“Okay.” Dean sets down his sandwich, nodding. “So now follow me for a second, here. Nobody else sees what you see. Nobody else can draw what you see. How many people have you told about it by now, roughly?”
Dean’s proud of himself for not choking. He knew they’d have to talk about it at some point, but he was hoping it could be put off at least until they got home. Although… this is probably better. Sammy can’t eavesdrop on them.
“Yes, well, I think you should be,” he snaps. “Call Gabriel and apologize to him first, and then we’ll talk.” And he hangs up the phone.
After that it’s not really fighting, they’re both flying erratically around the production area trying to catch and hurt each other but not succeeding. Jack, thankfully, is mostly staying out of the way for this part, tracking them both but not really able to help because he’s never been in a combat situation like this one.
So he works on stuff. Baby, obviously, he does care routines on his car. But he also works on picking up some more sign language like Sam’s been doing, so that their conversations during dinner can be easier or whatever. He teaches his new dog a couple tricks. But most of all Dean does his best not to drink so much. And he thinks Cas would probably be proud of him for that, maybe.
The reasonable calm of the morning is broken for Castiel when Angel Radio suddenly goes berserk. A rash of voices communicating, some frantic, others disgusted. Given that he’s not on the best terms with Heaven, Castiel wishes that he was no longer forced to tune in to these messages despite the warning they often provide. In this case, however, the news is profoundly disturbing.
“I never deserved that,” Cas interrupts, voice cracking slightly. “And I especially never deserved your forgiveness. I still haven’t done anything to earn either of those things, Dean. And I don’t mind being erased for that reason among an endless list of others.”
His palms sweat a little, but he opens the door anyway. And this time it’s not bits and flashes. He watches Cas piecing him back together, making him whole after Alistair tore him apart. And once he’s assembled again, Cas grabs him by the shoulder and drags his worthless ass free from the pit. When Cas’ posse of angels have made it out again, most of them vanish. And Dean watches Cas carrying him, laying him down gently in his coffin the way someone puts a baby in a crib for a nap. It’s tender and sweet, in a really weird way.
Castiel desperately wants to convince himself that he can’t see any of this - how red is beginning to flash behind Dean’s eyes in a precursor to them inevitably gleaming black instead of green, how Dean’s soul is pockmarked with wounds, how his very being is wracked with agony as it tries in vain to reject what the Mark is turning it into. Dean is suffering an indescribable level of pain even if it isn’t reaching his conscious mind at the moment, blunted as it is by recent bloodshed.
For a moment Cas forgets how to speak. He swallows and digs up some words. “I’m sorry, Dean. I want to help, that’s all.”
Dean groans. “Man, you gotta learn this shit. Here.” He digs through his stuff and accidentally knocks his tylenol bottle out. “Oh, uh, yeah. If you ever have to get something outta my luggage, this bottle ain’t actually painkillers, so don’t take them.”
And, okay, Dean can feel Cas’ eyes rolling, too, even though he doesn’t actually have eyes right now.
Hands. Big, callused palms rest on Cas’ forearms, anchoring him gently to the table. Dean’s eyes are very green, and Cas uses this fact as his focal point, dragging himself back to the land of relative stability. He carefully and silently makes an assessment to determine what went wrong and decides that, in fact, Dean did not scare him on purpose. There was a misunderstanding here, a communication breakdown.
“Thank you. For the juice, and also for fighting off my brother. Nobody ever does that for me anymore.”
That question catches him totally off-guard, but at least Cas seems like he’s actually concerned and not just being a shit. So, fuck it. Might as well open up to the guy who doesn’t remember nailing him twelve years ago, what’s the worst that could happen?
Power plays have generally two forms while inside the attacking zone, which is either almost complete stasis where they hold their positioning and ping-pong the puck around between the five of them, or to be like a washing machine on spin cycle as they rapidly switch locations to confuse the defending players and try to wrong-foot the goalie. At the moment, the Isles have opted for the second version. Castiel finds himself in the back corner again on the side the Stars goalie wears the catching glove, his eyes following the puck but keeping track of the movements in his peripherals. If he had to hazard a guess, the Stars are already beginning to feel frustrated and lose some amount of control.
“Dean,” Cas rasps hoarsely through the mask as his friend slowly comes in. “I’ve had a very unpleasant day today…”
So this chapter is up way early because I'm going to be out of state for most of the week with no wifi.
Castiel wants to converse and offer comfort, but that would be odd and suspicious to Dean at this stage. Instead he walks over purposefully and in silence, then presses his fingertips to his human’s forehead and threads his grace through every inch of tissue. It rolls freely, gleefully, finally performing the task it’s been so interested in since he arrived here. Reigning it in again is almost a challenge. The handprint is still there, a fragment of Castiel is buried in Dean’s skin, and right now it’s still fresh and very much tangible. Eventually it’ll fade until it’s barely present.
“Really? I’m supposed to listen to the guy who just turned his back and ran from all of us? You walked out on your family before, Gabriel. I don’t think Jack should get too attached to you. At least I’ll stick around for him…”
“Yes. So, the biggest issue is the red tape, but I’m taking care of that and you don’t need to worry about it. It’s evident that Raphael’s interference with your life is detrimental to you and causes you distress. I don’t want to be overconfident about anything, but ultimately it shouldn’t be very hard for me to get him away from you.”
“My brother Gabriel, I like him better but his profession is difficult to swallow for people in positions of power and I didn’t believe he would be a good choice for a candidate to take over my agency. Not to mention the fact that in a few years he’ll likely be too old to continue working in porn and will have to pick a new career for himself.”
“You’re gonna be okay,” Dean whispers against the back of his head. “You’re always okay again eventually. You’re gonna be okay.”
Gabriel rolls his eyes and gestures pointedly at the balanced tower of clothing on the foot of the bed. “You hate to wash all that, so I did it for you.” He says it extra-slow so that the seemingly exhausted human can keep up this time. Then he materializes a kale salad. “Here, drop all that crap and eat.”
He clearly doesn’t find it comforting at all but there’s really no point in calling him out on it, so Gabriel doesn’t. Instead he rolls his shoulders several times before removing his jacket and shirt in preparation. Sam is on the last two bites or so and stops chewing in order to stare as he gradually unfurls his wings. There isn’t space to fully open them in this room, but keeping them more or less folded behind his back isn’t an issue for the time being. He sits on the floor in front of Sam’s feet and waits patiently.
Cas does, groaning slightly in pain while rising from the mattress. Dean shrugs the rest of the way outta his flannel and then puts his hands on Cas’ shoulders, shucking the stupid trenchcoat and the suit jacket off. Then he goes for the tie, and Cas lets him but looks more and more confused about it.
“Adding Abilify,” Cas blurts out, because that’s what the commercials on tv say. The nurse is not impressed with his answer but all the other patients snicker.
“Regardless, that was still inappropriate and an invasion of their privacy. Please don’t force me to do it again,” Castiel demands before standing up from his chair and leaving.
“I have thought about it,” Dean grunts, shoving past Sam and lying on the bed in their shitty little infirmary. “Should I take off my shoes and get comfy?” he jokes, looking at Jack now.
not fair to her. Okay, I grew up without my mom, and my dad was never around either. You have no right to rob Mary that way, too.”
Think about what you really want to tell me and then try to use words, I have no idea what you’re trying to say.”
Castiel wakes up physically sore and to the noises of Jack getting ready for the day. Last night during their loss against Boston he went face-first into the glass and now his neck is pulling tight, which means a substantial amount of ibuprofen will be consumed alongside his breakfast. Irritatingly, the team has a practice today, so one of Anna’s friends will be collecting Jack from kindergarten and taking him to Northwell Health Ice Center while Castiel is doing drills and scrimmages. He’s so glad that Meg did the dropping off and picking up of Jack early in the morning for peewee hockey, because he definitely needed to sleep a full night.
“You can’t,” he insists. “There’s no ‘helping,’ I promise you. I’ll be pulled into the veil. It’s impossible to know how events will proceed after that, but ultimately an infant will appear in the realm of the material world. I… may or may not return as well.”
in his right wrist as pain shoots through his hand and up into his arm all the way to the elbow. But he’s the captain, they’re in the middle of play, he has to keep going even though he knows he just fucking broke a bone somewhere. Pain doesn’t matter. Winning this match does.
Cas moves to help and Dean essentially climbs upright using him as a ladder. Dean’s pretty green eyes are glazed over and half-awake, and Cas stumbles under the drugged weight of his friend. But Dean is cognizant, just uncoordinated at the moment. He gets Cas to lay on his stomach on the bed, and then lies down on Cas’s back. The compression is better than any weight blanket ever manufactured.
“I know you’re not. But now you know, going forward, that there’s no reason why you should have to continue not being okay with it. And in some capacity, I understand why you feel this way.”
But his prayers aren’t about emotions. He’s begging for help, for an answer, for anything at all. He must save Gabriel in order to save Dean but at the moment he has no way to realize that goal. Not without outside intervention.
Castiel allows himself a moment to feel exasperated before retreating to the armory to work on the bullets like Sam suggested previously. It’s not an especially difficult task to mark the rounds with the correct sigils, although after the fact he labels each box with a Sharpie by hand because he has nothing better to do and it should eat some time.
“In my defense I was like, halfway to becoming a demon already when you snatched my ass outta the hot-box.”
“Yes, sir.” Dean flees into the hallway so that he doesn’t end up as the target of all that building wrath.
They hesitantly separate themselves from each other and stand up from the couch. Cas knows that he should finish the burrito but he’s lost his appetite, so instead he gets Dean to open a Capri Sun for him. Capri Suns are one of about five things he can still mostly manage on his own, because he can pinch the pouch between his thumb and the splint with no ill effects. At this moment Cas appreciates one of his own habits regarding shoes for a similar reason - when bought, tie them once tightly enough to keep them on but loosely enough to put on or remove them without needing his hands. For one thing it’s more expedient, which was the initial logic back when he learned to tie his shoes in the first place, but now it’s invaluable.
This only succeeds in angering Dean again. “So that’s what this is?” he spits, throwing off his flannel and yanking up the sleeve of his undershirt. “You fucking wrote ‘property of Cas’ on me?”
Dean can’t get the “dream” outta his head. Not just for the obvious reasons, but also because he can’t believe he said any of the shit he said last night. Especially to Future-Cas. He sure as fuck won’t be able to say any of that Now-Cas. But it also got him thinking, gave him some ideas.
Handcuffed now by being unable to draw something he enjoys, Cas frowns at his blank piece of paper for almost ten minutes without putting down a single line. Looking from the corner of his eye, he tries to see what Dean is sketching and is surprised to find his friend taking the exercise very seriously. It looks like a thin rope, or perhaps a very thick string, that’s being brought out on the sheet of printer paper.
“I agree with Uncle Gabe,” Jack butts in. “String cheese is a very fun snack.” He looks at Gabriel hopefully. “Can I go see my mother?”
The morning of the seventy second day, Cas is barely able to swallow enough to drink a carton of orange juice… there’s no possible way he can consume breakfast. He goes back to his room after and lies down in Dean’s bed, curling in on himself with his eyes closed. There’s no way to know if Dean is alright, because the nurses won’t tell him. So Cas stays in bed, under blankets that smell like Dean. He dozes at points, not quite a full sleep, and doesn’t leave for group or for lunch. Salvation eventually comes, however, in the form of Sam Winchester arriving during visiting hours. And for this, Cas gets out of bed.
Cas has spent all of day ninety six drawing page after page of bees until there’s a stack of these papers on the desk in his room. He’s waiting - waiting for the phone to ring, for Sam to call with tragic news that something happened to Dean and Cas will never see or hear him again. It’s not a “real” panic attack, so the nurses won’t give him his ativan no matter how many times he asks, because benzodiazepines can be troublesome or something along those lines. They don’t want him to become addicted.
“It’s not likely I’ll be able to reply again soon, or realistically speaking ever again at all. But I promise I can hear you. Please speak to me as much as you want. I love you, Dean Winchester.”
Gabriel whistles tunelessly as he flies, bounding rapidly through different locations and snatching up the various complicated and rare ingredients for the magic that’s going to be performed tomorrow. It’s technically experimental, but Sam’s been consulting Rowena for the past nine days about how exactly to craft these spells together and what the ritual processes should entail - the guy’s turning into a fairly competent witch as it is, and even so Gabriel will be able to stop and reverse it all if things start to go wrong.
“Lemme stop you right there. That ain’t even close to what I had in mind.” Dean peels Cas down to bare skin, which is easy when there’s nothing under the dress shirt. He lets go of Cas and pulls off his undershirt, then holds it out after hesitating for a second. “I don’t got any feathers.”
The door slams open and Sam looks up from his laptop, because he knows that particular cadence of his brother stomping - Dean’s pissed. But there’s also another set of feet, and it makes sense about two seconds later when Dean comes into the kitchen dragging Cas by the collar of his trenchcoat. Dean shoves Cas down to sit in a chair and points an angel blade at him.
Cas rubs his back a little, because on tv that’s something you do to help someone else feel better. Dean doesn’t start yelling at him for it, so he takes that as a positive affirmation and keeps doing it, very gently like with a baby animal. Dean trembles slightly under his palm but still makes no move to stop him.
Dean smacks his hand away and sits up. Castiel almost takes a step back but forces himself not to, recalling that they haven’t had their discussion about personal space yet. This is increasingly annoying for him. Dean deserves kind words and perhaps a hug.
Gabriel drops the rest of his crap and stops to watch whatever the spell is that’s about to be performed. Sam finishes adding ingredients and mixes it all for a few seconds, then grabs a pair of tweezers and plucks out one of his arm hairs with a wince and drops that in.
“Mom…! That’s - that’s not the point, okay?” Sam shouts. “And Cas wouldn’t do that anyway, he has a huge guilt complex about ruining the lives of Jimmy’s family. I don’t think he’d ever take a different vessel again after that.”
He leaves before she can say anything else to him and turns over his gloves for drying, only ducking into the locker room long enough to retrieve his phone before secluding himself in a deserted section of hallway.
Dean knows that Cas compulsively asking him for consent at every tiny thing should probably be getting annoying, but he actually really appreciates it. After being ordered around and forced to do shit all his life - first by his dad, then by dickbag angels, and always,
passes to Kevin passes to Crowley, who carries it over the blue line and takes a shot that’s just slightly too high and claps off the glass behind the net.
scary,” Lucifer says sarcastically. “Are you going to put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Flight Risk?”
On the other end of the spectrum, THE MOST MAJOR PROPS TO MISHA COLLINS FOR VERY LITERALLY CALLING CAS AUTISTIC DURING HIS PANEL WITH ALEX CALVERT. Love him. The goodest bean. I can die happy 🥰🥰🥰
“I’m not - unloved,” he argues, even though there are times when he’s not sure that’s true. “Sammy, Mom, Jody. Jack. You, maybe - do angels even love?”
Dean would throw something at him if there was anything around to do it with. There could’ve been a better version of Cas, one who could stop fucking up for two seconds and actually fix things.
know most hunters don’t make it past forty five years old. So maybe instead of worrying about what I wanted when you were a baby or anything John ever did to you, you should try to figure out how to be happier with however much time you have. So if you want to be a hunter then keep hunting, but if you
Cas knows that because he draws a calendar each month, with help from a nurse’s cell phone. The nurses like him, usually. They’re nice to him even though he screams and panics sometimes. Of course… everyone screams and panics sometimes, here. But they like him. They like him because he doesn’t get angry with them, he doesn’t yell at them or try to kick them. He understands that it isn’t their fault he has to be here. And because they like him, they’ve managed to keep him by himself, not place a roommate.
Backing up, Castiel gradually unfolds his wings from his back as he realizes them onto the material plane. Dean’s eyes grow enormous with wonder and obvious excitement.
Closing his eyes, Dean imagines them from what he can remember, drawing them in his mind’s eye. It’s not just the wings though, they’re still attached to his friend. But they’re calming. They remind him of a home, maybe, that he never got to have until a couple years ago when his ass got dragged outta the Pit. Home ain’t a roof, and no offense to Baby but it ain’t his car neither, home for Dean is Sammy and Bobby and a box of beer and the healing touch of a beautiful angel. Even if that angel’s wings are probably the gayest-looking fucking things he’s ever seen in his life.
He’s disinterested in his lunch today. They’ve changed which therapy groups he goes to for the morning and afternoon, in order to teach him coping skills for when he’s discharged. He doesn’t like these groups as much, and he wonders if it works differently for him because he’s neurodivergent. Some therapy methods don’t work on autistic people. Maybe that’s the problem.
Cas rolls his eyes. “Dean, I’m led to believe that one of the innumerable reasons your childhood and upbringing were so difficult was systematic homophobia from society at large and especially your father.”
It’s a really good thing that the Islanders are the Islanders and not the Bruins, because the Habs are generally a pretty violent team but at least they don’t have a “literally murder the opposing players” rivalry going on with the Isles, so the entire 1st period
Dean’s seriously about to have a fucking panic attack right in front of half his teammates, because if they all figured it out then his dad probably did too, oh god, oh god, Dean is
Attention, we have passed one hundred subscribers - the current count is now 102, I love you all for keeping pace with this monstrosity of a fic 🥰
“You should introduce me to him sometime, I think I’d get along really well with your dorky little guy,” she grins.
They separate and Cas tries to focus on arranging his groceries in the refrigerator, but his mind is spinning. Apparently he has “a thing” for Dean, and didn’t notice until now. But he doesn’t particularly mind, and he can keep it to himself. That’s the rule for this situation, which he’s found out the hard way - say nothing. If the other person reciprocates, Cas should wait to be approached first. If Dean feels the same way it’s reasonable to assume Dean will come to him.
“I was talking to Michael earlier, we both have a bad feeling about it. It could be a good idea for you and Gabe to stay somewhere else for a few days.”
“No, trust me, no communication issues, they just kinda hate each other,” he snorts. “What about you, man? You and Victor holding up and leading the team?”
An eight-hour shift for a nurse is not an eight-hour shift. Nurses are perpetually, critically understaffed, and that means that an eight-hour shift turns into a sixteen-hour shift because the nurse in question is asked to help cover for eight more hours due to the lack of available personnel. It’s much less horrible for Meg to simply work a twelve-hour shift, because after a twelve-hour shift the supervisors are more hesitant to ask her to cover further hours. Unfortunately, even though she has some amount of seniority, she also doesn’t get along with her supervisor so there tends to be a mix of eight- and twelve-hour shifts in her schedule.
is released after his two minutes and the Isles make it out again only for play to get stopped on an offside.
“Essentially. The souls of living creatures can be formally claimed, either by Heaven or Hell or occasionally an individual such as a god. When that happens there’s a mark left behind. Usually the mark isn’t tangible without accessing the soul, but… sometimes it manifests physically instead,” he explains, trying not to be hesitant.
The advantage here is that this line and this D-pair are just fantastic together. Two of the five are their most veteran players, Jesse Cuevas and Lee Chambers, so there’s a lotta experience to back up what the three younger guys bring to the table in terms of energy and speed. As they get into position around the center dot Dean notices Castiel watching everything attentively like he’s soaking up some kinda critical info through his eyes. It makes sense, though, he’s wearing an A so he’s probably doing the same thing Dean is and learning how to help manage the team.
Gabriel seems somewhere between confused and fed up. “Fine! Let’s make this as needlessly complicated as possible.”
“Okay. Uh. He did mention you being gay as part of Raphael’s problem with you already, and I also think that Dean could take you in a fight. Guys, I’m here to help.”
“I know,” Castiel says, interrupting him. He takes a large, albeit pointless, breath. “Sam, before I get into this, just know going in that I love you like my own brother.”
Castiel watches his own head drop and finally, now, he moves. “Hello, Castiel. I am your sign from God.” It’s not true and he knows it, but he must get this message across.
“Dude, come on. I’m fucking starving and - everything’s been way too much today between seeing all the dead people and getting locked in a room by Gabriel, okay? I’m way over my limit for mundane-crazy. Gimme regular-crazy like a hunt gone wrong or something, at least that I can actually put up with.”
To make up for the interruption, their head coach punishes all of them for Crowley’s behavior by grilling them extra-hard as power play and penalty kill teams, not even stopping between drills long enough for them to rehydrate. It gets to a point where they’re all overexerted and tripping over each other; naturally, they’re berated for this too, as if it’s somehow their fault that they’re sweating themselves to death under their pads.
For some amount of time after that, Castiel tunes out the banter being exchanged between his prospective mate and his brother, instead choosing to mentally catalogue which requirements he’s met so far in regards to building Dean’s imitation-nest. For now, the success of this project hinges in large part on Mary, given that Dean will require the concrete acceptance of at least one of his original parental figures. For many obvious reasons, the absolute
“That’s not necessary,” Cas says softly, relaxing into the kitchen chair and eyeing the tip of the weapon with weary resignation.
Due to my clumsy dumbassery, there will not be an update on Friday because obvs this was supposed to be that update. Next week we will return to the regular posting schedule.
“He’s not wrong about any of that. Hell’s a problem, and I can tell you from firsthand experience that two of the Princes are still alive and kicking. I got to smite one when Cassie busted me out, but the others are floating around somewhere and we can’t really ignore that in case they decide to start causing trouble again.” Gabriel frowns the same way a human does who’s eaten something they don’t enjoy the flavor of. “You still don’t know any of the other stuff you need to do to make this work out, I can… help. I’ve been on Earth for awhile and I know how things actually work down there. Same for Cas, too.”
Castiel shakes his head. He didn’t have a great deal of hope that this ploy would be successful, but even so. “I fell from Heaven because of Dean and ultimately my actions greatly wronged him. You are about to make the same mistakes, even after learning how they end. Know that I will stop you, Castiel. And I’ll do whatever it takes.”
“Yeah, well…” Dean rolls over to face the wall instead of him. “I don’t think there is any helping.”
“Right. So uh… do you really think it’s more likely that you’re seeing things nobody else sees because you’re just that special, or because it’s just your eyes and your brain playing tricks?”
Also this is my first time writing Death, I think I got close to the mark with him? *cringes in fear*
Cas sits at the table and sulks. At least that’s what it looks like he’s doing - Bobby didn’t know angels even
“Since when?” Dean bellows, leaping off the bed and shoving Castiel with both palms. He allows himself to be moved and catches himself easily. “You let fucking-” Dean audibly chokes. “You let him kick my ass in that room and I almost died, then you pop up in the hospital and don’t heal me. Now you’re here and I
“I know this won’t improve the situation, but I am sorry. Sam made many of the same points which you’re about to bring up and ultimately convinced me to tell you the truth.”
“Apparently the future gets all screwy, so he winged himself back here to fix it,” Gabriel offers, shrugging. “Speaking of fixing things, maybe we should take care of
“No. ‘Brother’ is almost an honorific, it’s a term of respect and camaraderie. Some angels do have mates, though usually it’s the functionaries who have time for courting and nest-building. Warriors generally don’t bother. The ones who do mate or become affectionate need to get creative.” Cas pauses for a second, still stroking Dean’s head. “So in Enochian, supposing we were courting, I think I would go with
Looking up from the racks of Blu-Ray and 4K discs, Cas isn’t able to control the startle reflex he has to the customer five feet from him looking like a demon. He can see the black smoke puffing out from the neck of her shirt and tries to remind himself that it isn’t true, he’s just anxious and has delusions but without enough of the qualifying symptoms to warrant a schizophrenia diagnosis.
“Management was displeased with me and in general the team culture wasn’t ideal for my continuing personal growth as a player.”
Interestingly, Dean doesn’t move until Cas does. Cas goes back to their room with a weight blanket, which he fully intends to take a nap under. Very surprisingly Dean also comes into the room, holding his lunch tray. He sets down another carton of orange juice on the mattress beside Cas’s pillow.
“Don’t. Interrupt me.” So quiet. Why is Lucifer so quiet? It would be less uncomfortable if he was yelling and pitching a fit. “You know, I remember when you stopped being a baby and turned into a little kid, and dad was so unhappy when he took you to that shrink and found out you’re broken. So, um. If you really think about it, Castiel, I’m kinda about to do you a favor. Because your life is so… what’s the word I want here…
“Mom, there’s something you need to know.” He can’t ever tell Sam about this, but Cas is already aware of it and for some reason it seems weirdly wrong to not explain himself to his own damn mother. “Dad, um. Dad drank a lot after you died.”
Dean’s cautious about it. After twenty two years of chasing the supernatural, he knows he shouldn’t just run over and grab it, it could be cursed or hexed or whatever. He pulls out his knife and pokes it with the tip of the blade. Nothing happens. Something about this damn feather feels weirdly familiar, too, like he’s seen others like it before even though he knows he hasn’t because he’d fucking remember that if he did.
Gabriel dramatically flourishes his hand and the gift materializes on the table beside Sam’s breakfast. Settled nicely on top is the freshly plucked feather. “I juiced it a little bit just for you, guaranteed to repel any dirt or dust and won’t break even if you dump your coffee into the keyboard by accident. I already moved all your programs onto it too from your old one,” he announces proudly.
“Christ. Okay, Cas, lighten up, alright? You got no reason to be so damn grumpy, things are going… pretty much okay for us right now. Nothing’s tried to kill us all week.”
“Don’t you think it would’a been helpful to clue me in, though?” Dean growls. He’s not angry at Bobby so much as he’s angry at
“Nope.” Dean thinks for a second. “Wait, Future-Cas said there’s other angels chasing him, that might’a been them.”
Still nothing. He’s only been here for five minutes and it’s already pissing him off. His stupid wings move a little bit, but it’s not on purpose. He has no idea what to do with them or how they actually work or anything. How did Cas fly, back before the fall? How did he do it, the zipping from place to place? Actually… is Cas still warded, now that he’s in the Empty? Can Dean find him this way?
“SO YOU’LL JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU RETIRE? DEAN I KNOW YOU AND I KNOW YOU’RE LONELY BEING LIKE THIS” Sam argues. “I WISH YOU WOULD JUST LET YOURSELF BE HAPPY”
On a brief note of something from the Dean POV section of the chapter - yes, he wishes John is in Heaven with Mary. That does not mean I, the writer, think John should be in Heaven. Because I don't. He deserved to go to Hell with or without a demon deal.
Until the therapist tells him the following: “Castiel, the last five times I was here, all you did was draw bees. Can you try something else this time?”
Castiel tells himself, and everyone else involved, that he’s doing this specifically for players like Kevin Tran and Alan Corbett who’re fresh faces that deserve to have their talent developed in a healthy and supportive locker room. He says vehemently that he’s doing this for all of his vaguely depressed teammates, none of whom should have to operate under such intense and unrelenting pressure that they did nothing to deserve.
For an uncomfortable moment Dean stares at him while slowly taking a bite of the eggs in question and chewing in what seems to be a deliberate manner. Cas feels fixed by those green eyes and doesn’t dare move. Ordinarily, Dean makes him feel secure. But now, Cas is suddenly very afraid of him. It’s discomforting and unexpected and he doesn’t appreciate it.
“Okay. One, I don’t date coworkers, it’s unprofessional. And B, I don’t even date that much anyway because it’s way too risky, I can’t have fucking Deadspin getting their hands on something like that. Quit tryna ship me, Charlie.”
Actually, no, that’s not even it. Or maybe that’s part of it, but it ain’t the whole thing. Dean just… he wishes Mom gets to be right, even though she’s long gone. Because if there’s angels there’s a Heaven, and her soul went there. Maybe after Dad escaped Hell through Colt’s devil’s gate he went up there too and they’re together again like they should be.
“Humanity is so fragile,” Cas comments, somehow not bitter about it. “And I now have approximately forty years of it ahead of me.”
“Ketch lifted it off the London chapterhouse and threw it our way. This is just the first one, I guess there’s like twelve of them and he’s out roaming around tryna find the rest’a them for us.” Dean tries to find the paragraph he left off on. “‘In addition to the possibility of a traditional smiting, archangels are notably in possession of special melee weapons. Archangel blades differ in appearance from typical angel blades and are considerably more potent; however, the most important detail which separates them from their more common counterparts is the fact that they are only fully active in the hands of the archangels themselves. This means, effectively, that only an archangel may destroy another archangel.’”
Castiel can hear the overpowering fear in those words. Dean isn’t threatening further violence, now, but instead stating an inevitability that he’s certain he won’t be able to pull back from a second time.
Dean still can’t make himself actually explain directly what he means by this - that he needed any little scraps he could keep, any tiny shreds leftover from Cas, and sharing them was out of the question because they were his and his alone. Cas’ confession in the dungeon hadn’t been meant for anyone but him to hear. Judging by how much sadness is looking back at him from those deep blue eyes, Cas probably knows exactly what he’s thinking anyway, so he doesn’t have to say it.
they must exist but I have a hard time finding them... (stipulations being that they're complete and preferably at least a couple thousand words long, may be in English or in Russian).
No, that’s wrong. All of this is wrong and Dean can’t put his finger on why. He shakes his head a little. “Okay. Alright. Y’know what, I get it. You’ve got ‘faith.’ That’s - hey, good for you.” He means it, too. There’s moments sometimes when he gets kinda jealous of people who can hope enough to believe in something like that. He sits down again. “I’m sure it makes things easier. I’ll tell you who else had faith like that: Mom. She used to tell me when she tucked me in that angels were watching over us. In fact, it’s the last thing she ever said to me.”
He makes a grab for one of his friend’s flannels and wraps himself in it, then climbs under the desk and curls inwards. The fabric is worn and soft, speaking to years and years of ownership marked with countless laundry cycles. It still smells a little bit like Dean. Cas tries to bury himself in this overshirt like it will save him, even though he has no idea what, exactly, he needs to be saved from this time.
being mocked,” Dean snorts. “You’re fine, buddy. Plus you should know by now, Benny ain’t a mean guy, he’s good people.”
He has to stop and think about that for a second before slowly raising his right hand to rest it on the back of Cas’ where Cas is touching his shoulder. “Maybe it depends on the person. For you, yeah. Yeah it matters.”
While deleting the incriminating and obviously gay texts off his phone, Dean’s very aware that Charlie’s not wrong - Florida isn’t a hockey state. There’s certain places that are better or worse for hookups. Boston, of course, would be
“My crippling-ass mental health issues aside, I also just like having you around. Sammy won’t sit with me and watch
And then Dean’s eyes open, and he’s back in the damn hospital room. He reaches over and shakes Cas’ shoulder.
They go back to the locker room and John rips them both new ones - Castiel for leaving, and then Dean for not somehow psychically
“No, apparently she wants to discuss something with him. I’m sure it has nothing to do with you, Dean. My world might revolve around you, but that doesn’t mean everyone else’s does.”
It turns out to be a mistake anyway. Dean puts on a brave face, like he’s not incredibly fucking jealous that Cas gets to have a family. Especially because Jack is such a sweet kid. Dean eats a heap of sandwiches and doesn’t say that he wishes he could have this for himself. It reminds him of when he was nine or ten, there was stuff on the news about AIDS and gay rights and when he asked his mom what was going on she gave him this glossed-over explanation about how gay people didn’t have the same rights as everyone else. Then later when he was twelve, the first time he had a crush on another boy, he remembered what was on tv and what his mom said.
“Is this really necessary?” Cas scowls, limply sweeping his hand at the flames as if Dean could possibly misunderstand what he’s referring to.
“But we’re only two players. It’s not enough. We’re going to make a scandal and show the terrible practices that keep the team in low spirits. I know a reporter, she can get the work done for us, but there should be others who also speak with her about it. I think - Kevin Tran, and the goalie, the one who’s always grumpy and mean.”
“Dude, I don’t fucking know anymore. If you want a job with rules that make sense you’re in the wrong place.”
Now Dean shoves Castiel backwards. “Sorry’s not good enough anymore!” he bellows. “How many times you said you’re sorry to me by now, Cas?! Maybe instead’a being so ‘sorry’ all the time you should just not fucking do shit that hurts me in the first place!”
“I’m not arguing that it’s very thoughtful of you or that he’ll be interested in and appreciative of it. But suppose someone steals it from him.”
They pass Sammy in the hallway and Cas glares so hard that Dean’s almost worried his little brother is about to get smote; Sam doesn’t even say anything, which is probably a good idea, and just looks guilty in response. The two of them head to the garage and get in the car, which is when Cas decides to randomly inform Dean that Jack managed to fix his wings in the five seconds between emerging from the Empty and zipping over to the barn for the rescue.
Today is day sixty three. Cas crosses off another number on his hand-drawn calendar when he wakes up and then pokes Dean in the shoulder.
“There’s like twenty or thirty of them now,” Dean reports. “And those are just the ones I can see, man. I bet there’s a bunch more next to my shoulders.”
turn - Sam, and everyone you know, everyone you love, they could be long dead. Everyone except me. I’m the one who will have to watch you murder the world, so if there’s even a small chance that we can save you, I won’t let you walk out of this room.”
Eventually they do stop and get out at a public park, and reposition themselves from sitting inside the car to sitting on a bench instead. Cas finishes his Capri Sun and attempts to stuff the empty pouch into the cargo pocket on his pants despite knowing full well that his splint won’t fit; after multiple tries, he gives up and sets it down beside him.
“It’s essentially a promise for more later. Courting takes a long time by your standards, usually angels use that time to decide logically and thoroughly that they desire this particular mate. If the pair are often separated because they perform different tasks for Heaven, or if they’re soldiers from different garrisons, then multiple short meetings are necessary and feathers are gifted back and forth each time. Eventually both angels will have amassed a small stash of each other’s feathers. When they’re finally able to build their nest, these feathers are then mixed into one large pile and used as part of the building material.”
Hey, look at that. Dean’s found words again. “Well good for you, Cas. You’re such a fucking child. Okay, this turned out way better than it would’a otherwise and that’s only because another you showed up to un-fuck the situation. So you don’t get any fucking brownie points with me for admitting you’re wrong. I already know you’re wrong, dammit! I’m the one that
And Dean yammers on for some time about car-related things, fuel injector cleaner and different types of windshield washer fluid, all these extras Cas never would’ve thought of but help smooth the operation of a vehicle or make the driving experience more user-friendly. As they’re finally leaving the building and stepping out into the damp parking lot Dean has gone off on a tangent about something to do with engine repairs… Cas has completely lost track of the conversation, but he listens anyway, absorbing the information if not necessarily understanding it. He’s perfectly happy to let Dean talk endlessly.
Castiel completely tunes out and ignores everything John says to him during the intermission. He has no reason to believe any of it is relevant to his actual on-ice performance. Instead, he thinks of more important things, like how Jack is starting peewee hockey next week. It’s on Jack’s request, of course. Castiel in no way pressured him about it and asked several times if that’s what he really wanted, and his response was always the same: he wants to play hockey so he can be like his dad and like his Uncle Gabe. (Gabriel, naturally, was thrilled to learn this.)
Cas stares at the floor again and neither of them says anything for awhile. Dean’s thinking about sitting down when Cas finally speaks.
Castiel grabs Dean by the shoulder as he tries to walk away a second time, moving around to face him. “No, you’re not! Maybe you could fight the Mark for years. Maybe centuries, like Cain did. But you cannot fight it forever. And when you finally turn - and you
Sam turns his face away from Dean and remains silent. Castiel steps closer and extends a wing, lightly draping it across Dean’s shoulders even though it’s pointless to do so. He misses his Dean, the one he fled from in the crypt and who he deeply feared being made to hurt again supposing Naomi regained control somehow.
Cas refuses to be embarrassed as he leans forward slightly to put his mouth on the spoon. His right hand is in a splint and his left hand is not only in a cast up to the elbow but also slung (because apparently he’d been so focused on his shattered wrist that he’d initially failed to notice having a separated shoulder as well), so there’s very few activities of daily living he can accomplish on his own at the moment.
“Well, look at you, projecting all your abandonment issues onto an innocent kid,” Gabriel mocks, waving his archangel blade sardonically at his brother. “I’d say get over yourself, but there’s not much point anyway since you’re not gonna walk outta this building.”
“Nah,” Gabriel grins. “C’mon, we can get to work on the next batch of angels upstairs. I suddenly realized this afternoon during my third chocolate cake that we should really do this crap at night when the humans don’t need us anyway.”
Zeddmore loses the faceoff at the left dot, and Dean makes a mental note to have him practice those more in the future. The kid’s only in his second year in the NHL and hasn’t perfected his technique yet, and it shows. The players scatter in all directions, Isles forming into a loose box-shape in front of Garth while the Habs almost lazily pinball the puck around between the five of them, looking for an opening.
That’s so not what he thought she was gonna say, and the only thing he can come up with in response is a super intelligent and very articulate “Huh?”
When the waitress comes by to give them their check, she sees them still holding hands and asks how long they’ve been together - and apparently their perpetual staring match hasn’t gone unnoticed, because she doesn’t believe Dean when he tells her thirty seconds.
“Oh, I’m sure that’ll work out just fine, you always running off to chase vampires and all. Who’s gonna babysit, huh?”
“I know you do.” Cas risks a glance even though he doesn’t usually look at the staff - the therapist, who he’s directly seeing directly for the first time since he came here, is not a demon. She smiles at Cas but it’s not the nice kind. This is the same smile his father wore when he was a kid, that this-is-the-last-time-I’ll-ask-nicely-before-I-punish-you smile. Cas’ whole back prickles with discomfort. “But it’s not very insightful, is it?”
“Yeah, we thought that too… they’re real achy and stiff now, though, so it’s the kinda thing that was really only gonna happen once even if I wasn’t almost gutted.”
“Okay!” Jack grins, happily accepting the plate and immediately munching on his sugary breakfast. “Are we going to Heaven again?”
“We have a problem,” he announces, then grabs Dean by the shoulder and zaps them all back to the bunker.
“Yeah, and? What do you want me to say, Cas? That I forgive you? ’Cause I don’t. You could’a got Bobby killed. You could’a set Crowley up for a huge power grab. That ain’t okay, you dumbass! You should feel bad! I
“Yes, she is. Her soul is safe and in paradise where it belongs.” Castiel brushes down his hair with a palm. A crude human word - heartbroken. It comes to him. That’s how he feels about this. He wishes he didn’t have to do what he’s about to. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
“Do you want me to start again from the beginning?” Sam asks, his tone of voice indicating that he’s desperately struggling not to be impatient with his mother.
“Oh! Can I come, too? I always wondered what it looks like there! And maybe I can help. Also, I’d like to visit my mother.”
As he brings his brother to examine Father Gregory’s tomb, Dean does everything he can to stuff all those thoughts he was having before down into some hole where they won’t ever come out again, because none of them made any sense. It doesn’t work, though. He’s still stuck with this fuzzy impression of beige fabric and confusion, an almost misplaced sense of safety. And he wonders if maybe he did meet an angel once, a long time ago.
Mindful of his shoulder, seeing how his arm isn’t slung at the moment, Cas reaches slowly to grab one of Dean’s hands again. It’s made slightly awkward by the cast, but at least on this hand all his fingers are free. And they fold together with Dean’s.
he’s missing a detail, and for whatever fucking reason all he can think of is tan cloth and a rainbow-
“Cas, I’m fucking quitting,” Dean announces, much too casually in his opinion. “Lucifer’s dead, Hell’s in too much disorder to be a real threat right now, you’re about to get a huge power-up and Sammy’s got a brand new army of hunters to send out and take care of shit. And I… man, I gotta be honest, I’m just so done with this.” He half-laughs the words. “I can sit here and do what Bobby did, I know most’a the lore off the top of my head by now anyway so I’mma just sit on my ass and pretend to be an FBI director over the phone. Maybe every so often I can drive out to back up Jody or Donna with a case or whatever, but besides that…”
“There’s no solution,” Dean says flatly. “The Book of the Damned was burned and that’s the only lead we had. You’re not gonna find anything else.”
“Well, Dean would probably starve to death or chew off his own arm first and Cas would just stand there and watch him do it without saying a damn thing.” Gabriel shakes his head. “Alright, this might be the only time you hear me say this, but we gotta be serious for a few minutes - you’re learning to fight.”
“No, I don’t think,” he decides. He needs to say this, because Cas is about to be erased, apparently, so he won’t get another really good chance. He can be brave. It ain’t like he hasn’t already said it, kinda. “I know. In the crypt, when I said that to you. I meant it, okay? Both those things. I meant them. I forgive you, Cas.” He lets the rest of the words echo in their ears because they won’t come out of his mouth.
“We came to talk first,” he wheezes. “There must be a… better solution… than…” He vomits blood onto the floor.
Jack and Gabriel both feel it happen - the result is a shattered glass and drinkable cookie dough ice cream all over the kitchen floor as well as Gabriel almost biting off a piece of his own tongue.
“Oh yeah? And whaddaya think my baby brother has been doing with Dean this whole time? Between the two of us, we’ve broken every rule Heaven has at least twice over at this point anyway. And it’s only pain of death for the human, not the angel, which in this case I’m not even remotely interested in. So, you in?”
Dean stares at him and very deliberately takes a long sip of beer, making no move to come outta the corner. Bobby gives up instantly. That boy’s pretending to be angry so he won’t look depressed, and Bobby knows without knowing that it’s got something to do with their “other” Cas who popped in last week. Other Cas ain’t showed again since he went up to Heaven with Gabriel, so it’s a safe bet he ain’t around at all anymore. And since that other Cas went and vanished, now Bobby gets to crack this lock box with no help.
“Not really. I ain’t had such a good appetite lately,” he admits. It comes to him that they should seriously get on with the discussion that they obviously need to have, and plus maybe if they do have that discussion Cas won’t vanish on him… at least not anytime soon. “Wanna go out for breakfast?”
“Oh, no,” Gabriel groans. “You only came to rescue me so you can save your boy-toy from something, didn’t you?”
“I’m not sure that I want to,” Cas confesses. “I know what to expect here, it’s predictable and stable most of the time.”
Dean removes himself from the bed and returns with a washcloth, promptly attending to the mess. Castiel lies still and allows this, and once it’s finished they both dress. Sam is already in the kitchen when they arrive.
Dean’s hand is still on Cas’ face. He never wants it to move, even though he knows it’s inevitable. He remembers that Dean has asked him a question and nods, noting the scrape of his bristly jaw against the palm resting there.
“You attracted the affections from our team leader,” Crowley mutters to him in Russian, apparently seeking privacy from the rest of the team.
“Because they don’t trust you yet.” Crowley smiles very unpleasantly. “Which, presumably, is why you came to me for help in the first place. You’re aware that I’m a necessary resource and not just a well of colorful insults and witty rejoinders.”
“Well, I’m not starting from scratch,” Gabriel explains. “We’re gonna go find some souls and turn them into angels. That’s where you come in, you’re the one being all picky about this shit for me.”
Three stars of the game - third is their goaltender for only allowing two shots out of however many dozen to actually hit the back of the net, second is Victor for the Isles’ initial goal which was sniped all the way from the blue line, and first is Castiel for his hat-trick. He’s beginning to have a headache now that the adrenalin is ebbing and he just wants to return to the locker room and then go home with Jack, but he dutifully accepts the honorific stick before tossing it over the glass for some lucky fan to keep as a souvenir.
“Yeah, I guess I shoulda seen that coming,” his older brother admits, and then they go right back to trying to kill each other.
Cas smiles. “I’m well-versed in the compulsion to watch a single piece of media repetitively. It’s why I’ve seen so few movies and shows, incidentally. There are five or six of either that I enjoy and so I stick with them without feeling the need to seek out new material.”
“There’s books written about it that are super-duper-extra difficult to get your hands on. So, I’ll go find one and give that to Sam.”
Dean’s body seizes up as he cuts himself off and goes silent. Cas is forced to make a guess about what Dean was going to say.
Sam huffs a quiet laugh. “That sounds kinda nice in a really weird way.” His expression becomes serious again. “So Mom talked to you the other night.”
“There’s no equivalent word in Enochian for ‘love.’ The closest I can think of translates to ‘worship.’ Enochian isn’t designed for emotions or endearments.”
“What’s there to tell?” Dean shrugs. “She was wrong. There was nothing protecting her. There’s no higher power. There’s no god. There’s just chaos and violence-” Dean stops. He can’t think about Mom, he might cry, because he gets this feeling now like what if an angel was real, and what if that angel could’ve helped her, but maybe that angel just didn’t show up at the right time or something. And he hates himself for thinking it. “-and random, unpredictable evil that comes outta nowhere and rips you to shreds. You want me to believe in this stuff? I’m gonna need to see some hard proof. You got any?”
He’s pulled in for a hug and wonders if he should be embarrassed to be found by anyone else wearing one of Dean’s flannels, but ultimately decides he doesn’t care. He sits between his friend and Gabriel, who hands him a pudding cup and a plastic spoon from thin air. Michael watches silently from across the table, sitting perfectly straight like there’s an entire oak tree shoved up his ass. Sam and Anna have stacks of what’s likely legal paperwork in front of them.
It ends up as a standard penalty kill. No goals are scored against them, but they’re trapped in their own end the entire time as the Stars pinball the puck around and take shots at their goalie.
. They’re about to get forced into their defensive zone even with puck possession, which isn’t a great start to a game. Except that they have Kevin, who’s small and ridiculously fast and was drafted in large part because he’s absurdly proficient in breakaways.
A flare of agony spears through Dean’s head and spine, ripping his tiny moment of clarity out by the root. He abruptly stops crying and almost can’t remember why he started doing it in the first place.
Movement in the corner of his eye: Jack throws Lucifer, then whips Gabriel’s archangel blade back into his palm. Gabriel holds it out ahead and his nephew shoves Lucifer forwards again to be speared through the breastbone.
Dean stares at the wing. He didn’t even notice before how Future-Cas’ had been unhealthy or something, because these feathers are much fuller and neatly lined up, no tufts or clumps and very shiny. But that’s still not great. Dean’s massively not okay with what’s being suggested to him right now, yeah he’s pissed but just the idea of hurting Cas on purpose is so awful that he knows he’d never even
Lucifer picks him up under his arms, sloppily hefting his weight. The movement jars his undoubtedly shattered ribs and he cries out even though he can’t quite breathe. Cas’ eyes don’t want to stay open. He’s going to die, why is Lucifer still moving him around and dragging it out?
Someone bangs on the door to the panic room and Dean tears himself away so he can throw his flannel back on. Having it buttoned like this with no undershirt is a weird feeling, like he put on his boots without socks. He wipes his face on his sleeve and at least when he opens the door it’s only Sammy.
Castiel refocuses on his chest, which isn’t difficult seeing how that’s where his pain is centralized. It takes a moment to occur to him that when an angel touches a human’s soul, they reach through the human’s chest. And that’s what this is. There is a soul, a human soul, which is trapped inside his body and trying to escape. If he can’t remove it, it’ll tear him to pieces. And so Castiel forces himself to take a large breath before reaching in with one hand.
Lee Chambers gets their first goal, putting it into the net on a slapshot with 5:13 left in the 1st. That by itself is really unusual, because the guy’s a D-man’s D-man and last season only scored twelve times in fifty games played. (That low of a number probably has something to do with the major injury he had in the second half of the season, but still.)
And very suddenly, he has the answer. He can’t correct all of it, of course, because events will need to proceed to a certain point. But he may be able to undo arguably the greatest wrong he’s ever perpetrated against his friend. He just has to find a way to do it.
“Show me how you do your stretches,” Dean prompts, not just for practical reasons but because he’s interested to see if there’s different ones being taught now than what he learned as a kid.
Lunch comes. Cas becomes increasingly nervous. His new roommate might be a demon, and he’ll just be stuck with it. He can’t eat his food and his fingers tap on the table against his will. He wants to fly out the window, but the windows don’t open here and his wings are still missing. Cas abandons his lunch tray and looks at the whiteboard to see - all the names are listed, along with the room number, the psychiatrist, and the assigned nurse of the day. Until now, the other slot for room 307 was blank. Now it reads in bright red marker WINCHESTER.
The bitchface dissolves into mild surprise, and Sam accepts the food after tossing his duffel into the corner. He sits in his desk chair and starts taking bites. “So I’m guessing you do actually have an explanation for me, because you probably wouldn’t be lurking eagerly in my bedroom if you didn’t.”
manages to pickpocket the Oiler carrying the puck right over the blue line, though, and pass to Zeddmore, who has nobody to back him up at the moment. The turnover at least slows the Oilers down some because they have to leave the Islanders’ zone completely before heading back in again.
On the fifteenth morning post-injury, Cas is surprised to wake up first - Dean still hasn’t learned to sleep well.
“Yeah. Get pie,” Dean says as he slowly manages to get himself in bed. The relief when he finally stops moving is so good that he doesn’t even bother trying to get his boots or jacket off.
Prior-Castiel accepts the information, processes it. Castiel pulls away and waits for the inevitable rejection. He was too arrogant in 2011, too full of pride and wrath and love for Dean to listen to reason.
And eventually it does start to ebb away. Cas sinks himself deeper into the bedding like it’s a protective cocoon. He’d still rather have Dean. He needs a hug. Bundled in warmth and exhausted now, Cas falls asleep through no fault of his own and naps until a nurse comes to wake him up - he returns to full consciousness with fingers poking him repeatedly in the shoulder. Cas groans and stretches his back before shifting the pillow away from his head.
“No, not very often,” he admits. He folds his hands on the table. “You find the idea discomforting. I don’t blame you.”
the third-biggest fuckup in the entire family,” Gabriel grins, lightly slapping his shoulder. “Here, I brought you some contraband.”
it,” she keeps going, ignoring his reaction. “And after I read John’s journal and everything he wrote about you I was surprised when Sam brought it up. But this isn’t… it’s not a
Castiel reads into the minute expressions and gestures of his favorite human, seeing the underlying truth that Sam seems to miss. Dean is conflicted on something, trying to put the pieces together without a reference picture.
The lunch cart arrives, but Cas doesn’t stand up. He knows he skipped breakfast too but the worker pushing the cart is a demon, so he doesn’t want to eat off one of those trays. A nurse crouches in front of both of them.
“What? Yeah, okay.” Mary is passed to Dean and he grins down at her. “Hey, cutie… you got my boyfriend hurt, but you’re so sweet I’mma forgive you anyway.”
“I understand that, but that don’t mean you should go around doing stupid things like asking people for weapons that you never learned how to use!” Dean snaps. He pauses. “Plus, Sam took most’a my guns. I think I got one or two hidden around my house but I still haven’t found them.”
At least he won’t be in jeopardy for that reason. John Winchester certainly doesn’t like Castiel despite his decent performance on the ice so far; generally, it’s because Castiel doesn’t respond in a sufficiently subservient manner to the constant barrage of insults and unfair criticism sent everyone’s way by their head coach. Instead, he tends to argue and defend himself, which is a glaring affront to the man’s ego and dictator complex.
Gabriel pretends to fly back to the bunker, but in truth he only mimics the sound of his wings flapping and makes himself imperceptible.
Dean instantly boils over with rage and rips off his flannel so he can show the handprint scar. “So that’s what this is? You fucking wrote ‘property of Cas’ on me?”
Especially not in defense of Cas (or at least, not since Cas was a child). Cas wants Dean to not be punished for it, for being brave. So he distracts the nurses by sitting on the floor and hugging himself, indicating to them that yes, he’s still having a severe panic attack and they need to help him. (And it’s not even a lie, so he doesn’t feel bad about it.) The situation gets diffused. Raphael signs out and leaves.
Sam sighs quietly and watches his own hands where they’re folded on the table. “He’s been palming his meds instead of actually taking them. So twelve doses of sertraline and twelve doses of prazosin all at once made his blood pressure tank, he’s in intensive care right now.”
Sam or Dean or me, make sure you know what the end result will be and if possible read the entire spell for yourself first. Otherwise you may be tricked by an egotistical dickbag like the Scribe of God.”
Castiel drinks half a bottle of Gatorade in one swallow and begins chewing his mouthguard as he sits - it’s almost time for a replacement, this one is already almost to the end of its lifespan due to his aggressive stimming.
The stick-taping ritual is actually one of his favorites, it’s almost meditative in a sense, and it’s also one of those weird hockey things where no two players do it exactly the same way. He wraps the handle eleven and a half inches down with a few extra layers at the end to form a knob, and the blade gets taped heel-to-toe. Ever since he was a kid falling over himself he’s always used black stick tape because it’s luckier; white tape is basically neutral, and when all his friends were putting red or bright blue or pink tape on their sticks he’d always done black because for him any of those flashy colors pissed off the hockey gods.
He pulls Baby into a parking spot and grabs both their gear bags and sticks, and the two of them head into the ice center. Dean was careful to make sure that nobody else would be here right now and that the ice is freshly zambonied for them, because rough ice is dangerous and this is not his kid so the hazards should be as cut down as possible.
to get your own wings and sometimes I miss a couple spots, but there’s nobody around to do it for me. Michael’s in the cage and I don’t have a mate.”
“How did you get out of the dungeon?” Gabriel demands half-jokingly while poking his head into the room.
“Listen, Cas, I gotta be honest for a second here, I don’t - I don’t even remember half of what you were saying to me,” Dean admits, frantically pushing images out of his head of Cas getting swallowed by black goo. “You were gonna die and I couldn’t stop it.”
. They redo the faceoff just outside the attacking zone and Crowley wins the puck, which sees the five of them then messily break through the opposing defense and carry it over the blue line. It comes to him, he spanks a one-timer off the goalie’s leg pad for Benny to play catch with and ultimately pass to Kevin, who’s in a good spot to ring it off the crossbar.
Hey, guys, um... I can't really talk about the reason why, but I'm about to lose my access to AO3 and Tumblr for awhile and so updates are probably going to stop for a little bit. Know that it's not by choice and I'm really sorry about this, I know there's a lot of you who like this fic and I don't want to let you all down because you've been such a great audience. Hopefully this won't last for more than a few weeks or so. I love you guys, I hope this isn't too disappointing.
Dean doesn’t let go of Cas’ hand even while more drastically repositioning. Cas wonders if they should maybe be standing or at least sitting upright for this given his motion restrictions, it might be easier. He doesn’t suggest any such thing, though, because he has a sense that if he opens his mouth now the moment will break. And Dean’s free hand is now on his unhurt shoulder, and Dean’s head is beside his on the pillow.
“That was perfect,” Jerry Panowski, the team’s PR manager, tells him once he’s done. “Your second one will happen after everyone else is done.”
“You really think this doesn’t qualify?” he yells, standing up out of the chair on the dock. He grabs the open sides of Cas’ coat just under the collar and yanks his friend upright. “Are you shitting me? You’re seriously about to wipe yourself outta existence to fix your mistakes and you think I can’t forgive you?”
Dean leaves briefly and returns with a glass of water. “Don’t drink the whole thing at once, just - small sips every couple minutes. I’m gonna go clean up the kitchen.”
Gabriel closes his eyes and tunes himself to the vibrations of the world, feeling for any giant-ass disruptions or surges of celestial energy. In the immediate area: Sam calling some sheriff way over in South Dakota to put out an APB, refugees bustling and getting in each other’s way, Dean bitching out Castiel over the excessive wing oil soaking through his old ratty flannel. Further out, tiny dots of the few celestial creatures still alive: a minute handful of cupids dutifully carrying out their tasks, one angel pretending to be a faith healer and accepting money in exchange, another angel guarding the Sandbox. No signs indicating Lucifer’s return.
“There’s a couple of abandoned farms out that way, I’m pretty sure the nest is in one of them,” Sam is saying when Gabriel pops into the car for the second time in fourteen hours.
“Bitch,” he says, just for appearances’ sake. His heart’s not in it to banter right now. He’s too tired and his whole fucking body hurts and he wishes Cas just let Alastair kill him.
when he was sober. And he caught me once, with…” Fuck. Fuck. Dean can’t even say it. He breathes. “I got hit before that. I got hit after that, too. But that’s the only time he ever took off his belt. This was a special kinda ass-kicking. So uh. So can you just stop tryna tell me how it’s okay, please? ’Cause it ain’t okay.”
Castiel’s skates hit the ice and he’s immediately charging after a Senator who mishandled a pass and is fumbling to keep possession of the puck. In the process of stealing it for himself he’s skating while semi-trapped against the sideboards, but before reaching his own blue line he does manage to swipe it onto his stick and smack it as hard as he can to
Cas actually fucking hugs him, now. Dean wants and doesn’t want at the same time to shove him and tell him to back off; in the end he just stands there and lets it happen, but he doesn’t hug back.
“If you say so.” Dean eats the cookie in about two bites. “Hm, these ain’t bad. Pie’s better though.”
Cas is surprised by the sudden change in subject, but decides not to resist. “In this hospital specifically, sixty six days. Total, it’s been five and a half months since the incident on the overpass. You’ve been here for nine days.”
They return to the locker room, where Crowley is also now taking a turn getting into it with their head coach. During the entire intermission, John doesn’t critique them at all, because he’s too busy being argued with by somebody. In Castiel’s opinion that’s a distinct improvement over the norm.
Cas throws himself out of bed and into the arms of his friend, who takes a second before hugging back. Cas is aware that he’s “clinging,” which is something that’s generally socially unacceptable, but he’s still drained despite his nap and so doesn’t care. He hangs on with his arms as tightly as he can and buries his face in Dean’s shoulder, soaking in the warmth and becoming mildly alarmed by the lack of mass to his friend. Dean is still losing weight.
“I should never have been able to feel these kinds of emotions at all. I think I learned it by watching you. Try not to dwell on your grief for too long, Dean. I’m choosing to do this.”
“Then there you go.” Dean stands up and Jack mimics him without being told. “So here’s what you’re gonna do to cope: you’re gonna go to the kitchen and make a bunch’a popcorn, and then you’re gonna go sit in front of the tv and watch about a billion Disney movies in your pajamas. I gotta shower but after that I’ll come watch with you.”
I figured you wanted the stress release,” he shrugs. “Both our brothers have been driving you up the wall, right? I’ll step in if it goes too far sideways for you, but I think you got this and chopping up some fang will give you all the happy brain chemicals.”
Gabriel doesn’t feel bad about smiling when Sam’s fingertips first skim through at the base of his right wing, attentively straightening coverts and down. He folds his own hands in his lap and closes his eyes for a moment… it’s been several thousand years since one of his older brothers helped him preen his wings, and the sensation is much more satisfying and comfortable than doing it on his own. He can already feel the shift in Sammy’s mood too, becoming less tense and more receptive to what Gabriel is about to say.
wants to believe Cas, but his brain just says “no.” He knows there’s an infamous, horrible word for what he is, it implies cheating and back in the 90s spreading AIDS from gay people to straight people. Who knows, maybe that’s changed by now, Dean doesn’t keep up with that shit really. But that’s what he grew up with. And there was that whole thing with Lee, which ended in the biggest thrashing he ever got from Dad.
PSA: Last week, due to a fuck-up during the editing process, a chapter was accidentally posted two days early. Because of this, it might be worth it to take ten seconds and check to make sure you read that update before diving into this one :)
for a plan, all you can do is come here and tell me how much of a fuckup you are? ’Cause I gotta say, Cas, that ain’t news to me. Sam and Bobby kept telling me you were up to something and I didn’t wanna believe them, but now I guess I got no choice, huh?”
“Well, he said angels wear meatsuits the same as demons, right? Maybe your angel stole someone you rescued from a monster or somethin’.”
He glances up briefly to see Meg looking at her phone, which provides context for what she says next: “Oh, he’s cute.”
“Sorry, I thought it was stuck.” Gabriel rubs his left wing with a towel to soak up the excess oil and then moves on to the right one. “Y’know, they’re growing in pretty fast, maybe there’s something to be said for having a soul that could burn someone’s eyes out.”
“You do? Since when?” Dean snorts. “Usually you just do whatever it is you’re gonna do and that’s it.”
- he is. The ultrapowerful force that’s been observing him as he leapt through time is present, and in fact standing right behind him. Castiel turns to look and a thrill of trepidation washes through him, because all cognizant beings, even God, fear Death.
“You don’t need to say anything about it if you don’t want, Dean. I’m just glad that you know at all, it’s been weighing on me for some time and it’s freeing that I finally told you the truth.”
Daniel comes back and slaps Lee on the shoulder, effectively rescuing him from Crowley’s bullshit. Before Lee can go for his interview, and before Dean can lose his nerve, he clears his throat.
Now it’s his brother’s turn to howl in pain, but neither of them has fully incapacitated the other one yet. They stumble slightly away from each other, breaths heaving and trembling slightly from their injuries.
Sam snorts and leaves, not shutting the door behind him. Dean rolls his eyes and can actually feel some of his feathers prickling like they wanna roll their eyes right along with him, which is weird and a little bit cool and massively creepy all at once. Because these wings aren’t actually his, they belong to Cas, but they’re twitching and alive while sticking out of his shoulders and they react to almost everything he does. So being able to feel the individual feathers shifting around now that they’re growing back is a whole extra layer of sensory whatevers that he wasn’t ready for.
Dean looks over in time to see Bobby roll his eyes and snort. “That’s it? You came all the way here to disturb my eternal rest for
Castiel deliberately ignores the hostility that’s radiating off of Dean like heat from a fire. He can’t deal with it, there’s nothing he can do to change it, it’s his own fault. He must focus instead on controlling the outcome of the events currently unfolding. He
To destroy a soul is not to obliterate it entirely, but rather to torment and claw at it until it’s something unrecognizable as human. Sam’s soul had been destroyed before Castiel had lifted the scarring onto his own mind. Dean’s soul was destroyed twice, when Castiel first rescued him from the Pit and when he’d been on the cusp of fully morphing into a greater demon under Crowley’s attentions. And Castiel can see it happening again, it’s almost reached the last stage before full-blown corruption. He’s not sure Dean can survive being returned a third time so it’s critical to stop the progression before that point.
The bunker door slams and Castiel breathes, stiffly and deliberately rolling onto his side before climbing to his feet. He gingerly slips his angel blade back into the cuff of his trench coat as he heals himself, and then he goes for his phone.
Castiel has no need to take glimpses at Dean’s nightmares, because on occasion Dean has described them to him in vague terms. He simply removes them from Dean’s mind’s eye and replaces these awful images with much more pleasant things. Fishing. Sitting on his car watching the stars. Soothing and mundane ideas that enable Dean to wake up refreshed.
“Dude, personal space,” Dean snaps, stuffing his phone into his pocket. Even with it not being anything that Cas especially would find incriminating, it’s an embedded reflex like anything he does on the ice. That’s just what happens when you spend almost thirty three years in the closet. “You should know better, man, come on.”
“Fuck me,” Dean mutters to himself as he carries his stuff into the locker room and drops heavily onto the bench.
Cas thinks to himself. He’s not adept at distinguishing social cues on the fly and when he considers any of Dean’s actions after the fact his conclusions always draw confusing signals from his friend’s behavior. He knows for a fact that Dean does care about him, but not in what capacity. It’s frustrating.
“So if she catches up and gets close, will she be able to control you again?” Sam asks before those two can have another one of their endless god damn staring matches.
Hands. All he can do is whine, now. There’s no stopping whatever new hurts are sure to come. Cas shivers. It’s the only thing he feels under the agony, that his whole body shakes. He’s going to die. He’s going to die and there’s nothing he can do.
Victor Henriksen is their first line center, a veteran with another long-time Isle and a younger feistier player on his wings: Lee Webb and Cole Trenton, respectively. Dean butts heads with Victor and Cole every so often, but Lee’s a friend, and even ignoring that stuff the three of them together are a deadly defensive-forward line. It’s a major part of their identity as a team to be strong at defense, they aren’t bulldozers like the Lightning or the Bruins because they’re a cinder block wall instead.
“I managed to get in contact with Anna, and she said that she’s willing to take your agency from Raphael. We’re starting to contest on your behalf, and you’ll probably be really glad to hear that until this gets resolved, Raphael can’t send you anywhere else. You’ll stay here for now, at least until the case is wrapped up. Okay?”
“Wouldn’t know, only saw him for about ten seconds before he dropped me. Why, he look like somebody to you?”
know that angel wings don’t work like bird wings or bug wings. They don’t “flap,” and flying isn’t actually flying. It’s changing locations without actually moving. So, there must be something in the brain that has to do with it, right? God-Chuck-no,
“Yes, thanks for reminding me. There’s a waiting list as far as the housing issue goes, so you’ll probably have to stay with Gabe for between six and twelve months.”
“Cas. Castiel. You sunuva bitch, I know you can hear me. I don’t know what the hell you were thinking when you started this shit, but you’re gonna wing your ass down here and explain yourself. Sam and Bobby ain’t involved, it’s just me. But you owe me, man. You owe me the truth now. About why you didn’t trust me enough to just ask for help, for starters, and-”
Prior-Castiel studies him, visibly making a combat assessment. Castiel can see the moment he reaches an identical conclusion that it would be extremely unwise to do so.
And that, somehow, gets rid of all the stupid tension around them even though it kinda started the tension in the first place. Dean snorts and pulls open the lid.
“Well… not entirely, but judging by the overall tone of extreme discontent that’s being directed at me, I’m going to hazard a guess that the right answer is probably ‘everything,’” Cas grumbles.
“I don’t honestly know what to say right now. That was a really good answer, thank you.” Gabriel can’t help his feathers fluffing up a little with pride, which startles Sam. “Did I do something wrong?”
Dean cringes slightly in fear but makes no further protests, apparently accepting whatever fate he believes is about to befall him (likely death). Castiel chooses not to dwell on that at this time and presses his fingers to Dean’s forehead like always, rearranging molecules to soothe aches and knit damaged tissues. Dean only looks at him again when he pulls his hand away.
Castiel calculates. He can find Layla Rourke and intervene on Dean’s behalf with whatever her issue is. He’ll be gone again before Naomi or this era’s Heaven can catch him. And even if Dean never finds out his prayer has been answered, this other human will be better off for it.
“How the hell should I know?” Dean yells, genuinely outraged now. “Whatever it was, apparently it wasn’t good enough, or the world wouldn’t be in this fucking mess right now!” Dean makes a grab for a duffle bag that’s piled on a nearby table and yanks out an angel blade. “Get outta my face before I decide to stop bein’ nice about this and fucking end you right here.”
But the bustle has died until tomorrow. Castiel enjoys this near-silence, this atmosphere of peace like the air has grown softer around him. He senses a handful of souls stirring, but they’re keeping to themselves. One of them is Jack, who’s in the kitchen with Gabriel as they stuff themselves with piles upon piles of nougat candy bars. Bobby and Sam are insomniac together in the armory, discussing a number of pressing issues. Castiel is proud of Sam, he’s already shaping up into leader material.
Cas’ meddling it would’ve just ended up with them having a long-ass and awkward as hell conversation about him being Something Other Than Heterosexual.
“I brought you one of those salads you’re always getting made fun of for.” Gabriel reaches over the back of the front seat to stuff the bowl and fork into Sam’s hands. “Eat.”
“I - is it so much to ask that people just call me Sam?” he complains, rolling his eyes and pulling what Dean would usually call an
feel safe again simply because Dean is here. As he’s dozing off he thinks for a moment that Dean is nuzzling his neck a little bit, but maybe he dreams that, it’s hard to be sure. He doesn’t get very deeply asleep, though, because his phone starts to buzz annoyingly on the side table close to his head. Cas grumbles and stretches painfully while Dean answers for him and puts it on speaker.
Raphael watches him in silence for a moment. “Improve by the end of next week or we’re finding a different hospital. You need to be fixed, not eternally baby-sat.”
The medical trainers get him off the ice and while walking to the quiet room it occurs to Castiel to become extremely angry about this, because Jack and Anna had to see that happen to him and now both of them are probably upset. He’s about to have a meltdown in the middle of a game, and sitting in the unlit space with a medical trainer on his left he digs all his fingers into the back of his neck in an attempt to interrupt the psychological stress.
Dean basically passed out the second he was in bed after his movie ended, so only now does he notice that Cas was lying there the entire time wearing his stupid fucking trenchcoat and suit and tie; the only thing he has to put back on are his shoes. And that’s such a Cas thing to do, too, that Dean doesn’t even say anything, especially not to point out how dumb it actually is, because three days ago he would fucking
at it, ask anybody who’s known him more than five minutes. He throws things, and he yells at people he cares about, and he doubles down on his drinking. But this… this is different. It’s a different grief. Lots of times before it would’ve been an ugly and meaningless death, a body to burn. So this is different. Because Cas died specifically to make sure Dean wouldn’t, after blurting out apparently over a decade’s worth of
“Dammit, Cas, we talked about this.” Dean’s forehead gently drops against the space between his shoulder blades. “Hello is when you walk into a room. Good morning is when you wake up in the same bed and then your boyfriend fucks you through the mattress.”
Dean grumbles, rolls over, rubs his face. Cas watches him and wonders if this is what it means to feel
A thoughtful frown, and then Jack puts on his best smile. “Well, since Dean broke the spell on your wings, I think he should be your mate,” he insists. “Just like in Disney movies.”
The frown becomes a scowl. “Cas, if you’re gonna say that you changed your mind and you’re gonna give her up to the angels-”
“Dean, I always appreciate our time together,” Cas says. “But I wouldn’t feel good about leaving Gabriel here by himself, Lucifer might hurt him too.”
thinks you’re handsome. Crowley’s got a weird hate-crush on you and you already have as many Twitter fangirls as I do.”
He wonders what he did to deserve the attention and friendship of this man… whatever it was, he’s glad he did it.
glad he made the decision to just sneak his vessel’s soul into Heaven after taking it, because no innocent human should have to suffer through shit like this.
He hasn’t thought of that memory in some time, or at least not at such length as he is now, seated upright on the bed while Dean sleeps. He’s never spoken about the rescue to Dean, because for Dean it wouldn’t be pleasant, it’s an off-limits topic of discussion like everything else pertaining to his friend’s stint in Hell. But for Castiel, it’s a good memory. He never dwells on the “what ifs” of it all, of the possibilities had another leader of another garrison performed the extraction.
“Yeah, and you didn’t get me then either,” Gabriel spits, twirling his archangel blade so he can adjust his grip on it.
He sprawls on Bobby’s couch and pops open the book, but there’s a reason he usually has his brother do this part for him, especially when it comes to old text like this. It’s all tiny font with paragraphs crammed together, all looking the same, he loses his place constantly and inevitably gives up in about fifteen minutes.
“Oh, kid, you know so very little about humans,” he laughs. “Really, it’s adorable. Sadly, being cute only gets you so far in life. Well, unless you’re me. But you’re
“Jack,” he whispers. “I’m-I’m sorry, buddy, I know you don’t want people praying to you and all that shit. But Cas still hasn’t woken up and I’m getting real scared by now that he ain’t gonna at all. So uh. You don’t even hafta do anything, just-just tell
Incredibly (and extremely painfully considering the lack of sufficient mature feathers) they move backwards about three and a half feet, passing straight through the wall to emerge in the large centralized space of the defunct factory’s production area.
“In my case, there is no feather. Impala aside, Dean doesn’t necessarily tend to put much stake in possessions. But he feels bound to protect everyone and provide safety at great expense to himself. So I’m in the process of creating an environment that’s more beneficial to his emotional health. He’s so busy taking care of everyone else, he deserves to be looked after for once in his life. I want him to have stability and safety. Eventually I’d like him to understand that he’s allowed to be loved unconditionally by the people close to him. That’s much more important and permanent than a feather. I’m building him a nest.”
The meeting proceeds like this for a few minutes, discussing the logistics of how Cas’ living situation will work out until they can find him his own place and Gabriel reminding him about the parking ban still being in effect until April (which means no parking his truck on the front lawn, because tickets). The good news is Dean lives about sixteen minutes away so they’ll be able to “hang out” whenever one of them isn’t in therapy and they’ll both be less lonely, at least until Dean has a job again. When this is pointed out Gabriel makes a joke about Cas needing to stock up on condoms which has every other inhabitant of the room groaning and/or rolling their eyes, except for Sam, who may be trying not to laugh if Cas is reading his expression correctly.
“You don’t have to thank me, Sam. I’m happy to do it even if you weren’t in the process of forcibly extricating Raphael from my life. It baffles me that being the youngest of six children only two of my siblings are worth speaking to.”
“Okay, kiddo, you can sit in the chair for three minutes…” Dean takes Mary from Castiel and sets her down a second time. “Alright, me and Sammy never got to do this when we were kids… okay maybe I did a couple times, but I don’t remember it. Either way. Literally every other family on earth does it, so we’re doing it with her every single year.”
The other takeaway Dean gets from this is just how unloved Cas has felt. It’s not only the shame or the absence of affection, Cas never thought he deserved to be loved, either.
Why are they whispering? There’s nobody around to hear them. Dean slips his hand free and hesitantly strokes through Cas’ hair again, fluffing it up and smoothing it back down. It’s far from an unpleasant sensation and Cas wishes his ribs weren’t broken and his shoulder wasn’t hurt because then he could roll sideways to get closer to Dean right now. Are they crossing a line? From everything Cas has witnessed on tv shows, he surmises this isn’t ordinary “friend” behavior, even for an already abnormal friendship like theirs.
(You may also have noticed that this fic has a completed chapter count now - I am wrapping up the writing of the epilogue as we speak.)
“Nope, and I prob’ly never will. It’s fine. Sammy’ll prob’ly have kids someday, they can come up and hang out with me during the summers or something.” Dean shakes his head. “Are you
Castiel desires very strongly to answer, but he doesn’t dare interfere with the course of time where Dean is involved. Things must happen as they always have, because otherwise his friend’s existence could become jeopardized. Instead he plucks a covert feather from his left wing and places it on the bed before flying away to find Layla Rourke.
Cas shoves the paper away from himself so that it won’t get ruined as he promptly bursts into tears. Dean’s not allowed to visit him yet, not for another four days, and technically shouldn’t call him on the phone either. But Cas misses him so much, his warm hugs and the way he smells and his general goodness despite the perpetual bad moods he seems to have.
solid chunks of frozen galvanized rubber smashing them in the face at a hundred miles an hour. Crowley is making fun of them both, but they’re ignoring him because everyone knows the bastard mostly just loves the sound of his own voice. One of their brand-new baby rookies, Kevin Tran, is asking John about something, which he’ll learn probably immediately is
“I wasn’t happy.” That’s like. Not even what he meant to say. Now neither of them can look at each other and it’s so fucking awkward and Dean wishes he never did this at all. “You should’a asked for help, Cas. I would’a helped.”
“What-what did I do?” Dean asks, shaking his head slightly. “Cas - hey, c’mon, buddy. Calm down, okay?”
woke up like. Three minutes ago.” Dean rubs his eyes on his fingertips and takes a long gulp of beer while he waits for his brother’s words to sink into his brain. “So wait, he let you see his wings? Good for you, man. His are pretty cool-looking.”
“Well that’s perfect, the bunker’s warded, we can bring them here and nobody will find them,” Sam exclaims.
Randomly on the topic of Sabriel - why is it a thing? Don't get me wrong, Gabe is my second favorite character to ship Sam with after Eileen. But in general I consider it a crack ship (they don't interact all that much if you look at it, plus Gabe is seriously not one of the best things to ever happen to the Winchesters until the very end of season 13), and most people take it very seriously. TL;DR, I like them, but just... why? (And no, they will not be appearing as a couple in this fic. Sorry guys. If you want a fic of mine which
“Y’know what, Dean put superglue in my toothpaste and ironed my dress shirts using beer. So - youngest sibling solidarity,” Sam laughs. “I feel your pain, man.”
an archangel, but you’re so close and so much more powerful than one that I wouldn’t be all that surprised if this thing would work for you, too. So we’re not gonna be waving these at each other, it’s just a bad idea all around. We’ll practice with regular angel blades instead, because those will only sting a little.”
Or rather… he refuses to dwell on it until the blissful silence breaks. It’s soft in the beginning, so much that he fails to notice at first. But gradually Castiel becomes aware of this noise. Indecipherable for some period of time, but eventually he manages to comprehend this sound.
Layla’s eyes don’t leave him as he approaches, only closing when he touches his fingertips to her forehead. He disassembles the malignant cells at the molecular bonds first before searching out and correcting every presence of the defective gene that caused this in the first place.
“Yeah, sure.” Dean has no idea what that actually means, but he’s cool with it. Then he blinks and Cas is standing in front of him, and that’s just fucking weird, man. “How-”
They don’t go into the day room because there are several other patients with visitors there, and instead retreat to Cas’ room. Sam takes the desk chair while Gabriel sits opposite Cas on what was formerly Dean’s bed.
“…yes, and correct me if I’m wrong, but we prefer it that way,” Castiel replies, unsure of the direction this conversation is heading.
Hiding from another pack of crossroads demons that bicker about who cheated who while betting souls during a poker game last week, Castiel realizes that it begs the question of how, exactly, he plans to free Gabriel. Any warding strong enough to hold an archangel will certainly be enough to stop him, a mere seraph. And he’ll have a Prince of Hell to contend with. Did Death set him up to fail on purpose?
Maybe Cas gets the message, or maybe he just decides to take pity. Either way, he keeps his mouth shut, and Dean goes out with everyone else for the middle period of the game.
John is yelling at them mercilessly for being subpar and it occurs to Castiel that the constant barking and insults is probably at least fifty percent of why they aren’t doing well tonight. He’s about to say as much when
“No, Dean. I’m sorry for all of it, but there was no other way. We don’t need to talk about this now if you don’t want, either.”
“Sure.” He materializes one, tidily wrapped so she can eat it one-handed. “Anyway! No signs of Lucy yet, since I know you’re probably worried about that, and I may have modified the food stock for the refugees to be mildly bottomless.”
human, has been around humans for nine years straight. Cas is well aware of exactly what he’s doing and saying, and Dean knows it.
Cue the Stars scoring eighteen seconds into their power play, tying them at 2-2. Castiel rolls his eyes at that as much as Crowley coming back to the bench and, of course, squeezing in directly beside him.
Dean’s facial expression becomes blank, not that Cas can generally read expressions to begin with. “You do help,” he says after a moment in a tone of voice Cas also doesn’t understand. “You don’t gotta worry about owing me or anything. You help.”
“Woah!” Now Gabriel’s palms raise in a gesture clearly intended to be placating. In reality, it’s obnoxious. “You know where I was while you and lover boy there were airing out his laundry?”
It’s only because he’s known Dean for years now that Castiel catches the moment that this information feeds into Dean’s logic. The slightest relaxation of posture follows shortly after, so subtle that most wouldn’t catch it. Dean backs away from him and sits on the side of the bed.
Then Lee grabs him in a headlock and noogies him. “C’mon, you jackass, it ain’t that bad.” Which from Lee Webb is actually a loving compliment. “Plus we set aside part’a the pool, too.”
Dean has apparently elected to take a penalty on his behalf - Castiel watches from across the locker room.
Despair completely takes over Cas’ face, covering even the obvious bone-deep exhaustion. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
“And what would you suggest, then?” Raphael challenges, staring Gabriel down. “That was the last set of instructions left to follow. There’s nothing else after that. How is Heaven to proceed?”
“Alright, Dean. You may see my wings, but only because I know that at this time it’s not within your power to injure them. I need them to fly and to travel through time.”
Well, whatever, more for him. Dean takes a sip before he says anything else. “So, what makes you think you saw a, uh, angel?”
Before Crowley can end the call again, Castiel snatches the phone. “Hello, Ms. MacLeod. I’m one of your son’s teammates. He isn’t playing nicely with others.” He hands the phone back without waiting for a response. “Enjoy.”
