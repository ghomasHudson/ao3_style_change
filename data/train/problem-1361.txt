But then Sherlock had shivered again and John's mind was at once pulled back to their current situation. They needed to find Sherlock some actual clothes to wear...and fast.
The sun is rising. The sky is a beautiful painting of reds and oranges and pinks and blues and there are birds striking up their first song of the day all around.
It feels as if it has always been this way.
He frowns.
John had felt his guard going up at this remark. Holmes had asked him to talk before and that conversation had ended with him being none the wiser.
I give him a haughty look as I bend my knees and pick up my books again.
He wasn't going to the after-party in any case but now he really just wants to go home.
He was definitely not asleep anymore.
Warm liquid joins the sticky mess that has already been left there last night.
John wants to say something else. Something that will brighten Holmes' mood. He hates seeing him so grim and terse. But a sudden knock on the door startles them both.
When has he ever been worried about a performance. He knows these lines by heart. He knows the play by heart.
I want him.....
This is the worst hangover I have ever had.
He's never had feelings like this.
As the door on the passenger's side of the car is flung open for him he keeps his eyes closed tightly and he imagines:
It comes to collect those that have fallen short or have been found wanting in any sort of way.
He is reminded of that first time they met. Holmes and his horse had been back-lit by an ominous sky too then. And, just like before, it seems as if a piece of the dark night-sky has dislodged itself from the heavens to take on the shape of a horse and rider.
It's rather impressive really, if you think about it, how they manage to turn every single little banal thing into a raging and violent argument.
Holmes starts running faster. John follows after him. The moon shines down on the road in front of them. The slightly damp ground appearing like a silver ribbon beneath their feet in its heavenly glow.
His eyes widened in shock and understanding, but Finn was already making his way to the doors that led back outside.
He does know.
He remembers running his fingers through those same silky strands of hair.
They were sitting opposite each other now, Sherlock's fingers tracing the bond-bite on John's neck. The look he bore this time far away and indecipherable, even to John.
But he is still young. Just a child. And he doesn't know yet how to voice complicated emotions like this and so, in the end, it all just comes out as more obstinate anger.
But it's also a little bit frightening.
It seems to have awoken fully now.
'At least you'll get to ski.'
“Sometimes quiet is good”, he says.
“Where are we going today then?” he asks. Almost breathless.
The message I left there.
Sherlock turns himself around on unsteady legs.
I'm smart enough to fake not being smart.
Touch him.
“Likewise”, Holmes says before spurring on his horse and racing ahead.
John furrows his brow.
Mycroft never comes to meet him the following month and when he goes to look for him all traces of him  are gone.
'Not if the student spends his time drawing in his textbook instead of studying.'
“Well”, I guess I was wrong, “Sherlock says, he finds he is starting to really warm up to the idea of going home with Watson as two ordinary men.
“......home....”
Finally Molly does finish and as she utters her last lines:
“John...”, he says again. Softer this time. They find themselves closer to each other somehow. Sherlock has no memory of walking, of indeed having moved at all, and yet he finds himself standing only a pace or two removed from John Watson now.
“Neither do I.”
For a moment his drunken brain fills in the blanks with all kinds of paranoid explanations:
John's lips on his again.
Even when Sherlock doesn't want him to.
Suddenly I'm hot and cold all over as panic rises like bile in the back of my throat.
'John? Are you in here?'
There's a sinking feeling in Sherlock's stomach.
It seemed that Sherlock wasn't entirely immune to John's enthusiasm after all. It only took a couple of seconds before he cracked and the hint of a smile turned into an actual one and John felt as if he was basking in the sun once again as a warm and tingly feeling was forming in his stomach.
He looks for a couple of seconds and then steps back again, turning himself around in order to be able to talk to John who is still advancing on the ancient structure in a slower pace.
“Erm....”, he says, at a loss of what he is actually doing here....at an actual crime scene.....
Just great.
“I worry about him”,  Mycroft had said, “constantly.”
I don't dance. I've never danced. I say yes anyway.
***************************************
“It's been wonderful to see you again”, Holmes says, “you've been a great help.”
Downstairs I can hear my mother open the door, there is silence for a moment, then I hear her talking to someone and then she loudly calls my name.
For a moment he wonders if he can still leave and pretend he's been given a prophecy.
“I believe so.”
His left side feels like it's on fire.
“Are you having another vision?”
I don't know why I panic.
And then the man finally looked at John himself and even the look in his eyes felt wrong and out of this world and in a reflex John lifted his hand to his chest where the medallion was hidden.
“Don't you see that?” all John says. His voice airy and thin as he stares ahead at the framework of the door. Even though the  sun is still blazing overhead his complexion has gone deathly pale.
They  had had a fight, as usual, they fight so much these days.
And then.....I'm not cold anymore.
He isn't sure if he should answer or not so in the end he just decides not to.
He's still in army gear: army boots, a pair of camo pants and a tight t-shirt. A duffel bag is slung over his shoulder and a relaxed smile is on his face.
“Why don't you come back to bed”, John tries.
He manages to give John a small smile in return.
He can't think of all that right now.
He doesn't think he's gay.
But, when he looks up to see if he is correct he finds someone else standing in the doorway altogether.
He gets up. His legs are shaky and numb but he manages to get to the door and as he leaves Mary gives him a final: “we really appreciate what you did for us.”
He just needs to try and style it a bit better in the future.
So much for that plan.
John offered to drive Sherlock around on more than one occasion but Sherlock always refused.
As they enter the unlit room John finds it altogether far too quiet, dark....and intimate.
John seems so at home in my bedroom.
And yet.....
The soldier knows.
Master Holmes looked down at his dripping fingers and lifted his hand to his face.
Everything they need held tightly within the palms of their hands.
“You're new”, Holmes says, “all of these other lords they've seen before. They're stale and old. You're new and handsome....mysterious.”
Shining like a beacon above him.
'Come on Sebastian', he said, 'just let John go. The sooner he starts passing tests the sooner we can have him back all to ourselves. Alright?'
Like something that is already dead but hasn't realized it yet.
John decides to execute his plan.
So he just smiles, cast his eyes down and nods. The hand on his knee squeezes ever so gently.
As if nothing has happened.
“I went to see Mrs. Hudson this morning”, he says, “but she wasn't looking for me at all.”
He's been trying his very best to avoid me and not look at me.
“You don't think it's stupid?”
“Okay”, he finds himself saying too.
For someone with such singular powers as John Watson to be around a magic user.....it will only end up broadcasting what he can do to basically the rest of the world.
“Fine”, he says, “I'm always fine.”
And he comes here.
“He was there that night I picked you up from that party......the one where you got so sick”, Mycroft explains himself. Sherlock feels as if he is underwater. His movements are sluggish, his limbs not his own and Mycroft's words are muted.
Sherlock clears his throat as well.
Her attention is focused elsewhere.
Although the situation is nothing new.
I give my mother one more hug and she kisses the top of my head before she lets me go and I head upstairs to my bedroom.
He needs a glass of water.....a paracetamol......anything.
But when he goes outside to see if someone is there all he sees is relentless rain and an oppressive sky that is nowhere near from finished.
He looks at Miss Huntington as she spins another tale.
'I myself have some magical powers and I try to use them for a cause I believe is right. There are more things in this world than most people can even imagine. Most people can't even see it unless you rub their noses in it. But you......you saw something, didn't you?'
They sit close to each other and, especially Holmes, keeps stealing glances at the soldier.
Now it appears that rain and water is what makes the vision most real. She hadn't tried that yet. Or maybe it's just a coincidence.
“You know I cannot promise you that”, Sherlock says. Molly was afraid he would.
She had given John a strange look when he had not been able to produce Sherlock's last name when she asked for it.
They bring him breakfast but Sherlock doesn't eat.
He'd thrown up three times already that morning. He wasn't sure he'd survive another round.
The dark man does not release his grip on Molly's arm. To his credit, the soldier doesn't either.
“Sherlock....”
“I told my father I might be in love with a boy”, he says.
“Oh for God's......here.”
And before John is able to ask her what she means she turns around and walks back through the doors where she disappears as the pinks and oranges from oncoming evening swallow her up.
John has momentarily gone to the kitchen to make them both a cup of coffee.
He had recently done some remodeling and had probably forgotten to lock it behind him. He had gotten careless. He just wasn't used to these kinds of emotions. This was exactly the reason why he had kept to himself all these years.
To Eton.
No use in delaying the inevitable.
“Look”, Finn continued, “if I tell you all I know I'm pretty sure that Holmes here will want to be conscious for it. I think he'll have a thing or two to say himself. So stay here. Keep his temperature down......keep him alive.....and I will be back in one or two days at the most. Okay?”
And John had stayed once again. Had offered to stay.
Somehow his hand has found its way to Watson's cheek. The skin is soft and warm but its covered in the course stubble of the beginnings of a beard. A delightful juxtaposition. John Watson is built out of contraries and he finds he can't get enough of it but he has also never felt anything like this before and it scares him more than a little.
More specifically: he is looking at John.
He glances sideways at Holmes but on his friend's face he finds none of the relief he was hoping to find there.
John watches her leave for far too long before he finally remembers he has chores of his own to attend to.
He sees himself.
Everyone in the entire school will look at him and wonder what on earth he's doing, sitting with the most popular boys.
It's like some sort of dream come true.
She likes being a spider.
What is  John on about?
Pining after John while John is doing his very best to woo Molly.
ps: I am still awkward at writing smut but hey....
John had tilted his head to the side.
Holmes shrugs his shoulders.
“He is not my king”, Sherlock says, “he cannot order me....or my friends. You can tell him that.”
A mixture of bile and stale beer had flowed past his lips in entirely the wrong direction and he had thrown up all over the ground....and John's shoes.
Mycroft is serious, pure business.....to the point....and....of course.....he had to be....after....
It will only be the sole moment in his life that will ruin him forever and at the same time make him more than he he has ever been.
'Joooooh....uhn....John.....'m close.....John.'
“Hey.....are you okay?”
****************************************************************************************
“Break a leg”, Mycroft says. He says this every year.
“yeah.....I.....erm....I should go.....the guys....you have a good day.”
I forgot to bring any gloves and so the November wind has free reign as it settles down on my skin and weaves in between my fingers with its own icicle grasp.
John felt like he was in heaven. But, however nice the kiss was, he soon found himself wanting more.
Breathing is so much easier now that my chest has emptied itself for the first time in years.
When it comes to John Watson he wants all or nothing and, not feeling quite ready yet to find out in which direction the balance would sway, he had fled.
“So let me get this straight”, he says, “both of you put yourselves in dangerous situations in order to look for something that might not even exist?...... I think that....maybe....both of you are chasing ghosts.”
John was going to get his license after his next birthday. His parents had promised to get him a car if he did.
“Oh no, I loved it.....it's just...I don't know.  I guess I'm just a failure”, John shrugs and looks down at his plate again.
He had also explained to Holmes how he'd gotten Watson here. The lie about his father's passing and the two weeks it had given them.
“Wait”, he says, “Stay. Don't go.”
“I think it's really cute when you roll your eyes too”, he says.
'Snowboarding?'
'You can't talk when you're asleep, Sherlock.'
returned......always.
Asleep or awake.
His hand and clothes are covered in quite a lot of fresh blood and as John looks at the stained mess that covers the demonic man the sound of buzzing insects intensifies.
I watch the lights of the city as they stream past in a starry blur, people milling about on the sidewalk, the evening traffic, and I wonder what I'm even planning to do with John when I get him back to my house.
Why had John even invited me in the first place?
He wondered how Sherlock kept dry when it rained like this. If he just stepped between worlds. Would it rain there also? He'd have to ask him next time he saw him.
And so he says:
And, even though I tried avoiding it any possible way I could, that still feels an awful lot like an ending.
Sherlock is perfect the way he is.
He keeps losing his place in the play. He gets words mixed up or just mispronounces them and his timbre is positively atrocious.
And then his father had gone away and had not come back.
Sometime during it, while he slept, Watson has rolled around on his stomach, exposing his back to the cool air of the bedroom and Sherlock's inquisitive gaze.
No-strings attached is a nice idea but it's only a matter of time before someone will be stupid enough to start asking questions and then....
An addict and a failure.
He closes his eyes and inhales again.
They both smile and Sherlock takes a sip of his coffee. He finds his hands aren't trembling quite as much anymore.
His mother was having a conversation with the headmaster at the moment, but would soon come looking for him. She was under the assumption that Sherlock, who had been appointed as Johns tutor since he was falling behind with some of his grades, was beating up John after school time. She could not be further from the truth if she tried, but it was better that she thought this than what actually was going on. If his mother found out John was in a relationship with another man she would certainly do anything she could to keep them apart.
He held on tight and as the fairies moved away between the trees, never to be seen again, the moon bathed the clearing in brilliant white light. An island of moonbeams just for the two of them where sorrow could no longer enter.
A couple more people have taken shelter in the warm bar.
“She's just passed out”, he says, “fast asleep.....must have been all the alcohol.....”
His brother had gone on a trip that was only supposed to take one month.
He poked wistfully at his plate as the shrill sound of their voices penetrated his ears as they talked amongst each other.
Mycroft sighs and decides to sit down next to his brother. Sherlock, for a moment, looks at him from the corner of his eyes but then goes back to staring at the wall opposite to them.
Thank you so much to anyone who is still reading this.
I steal another glance at you. I need to commit every detail of how you are now to memory before the inexorable passage of time changes it into something new and equally beautiful and exciting.
John very much doubts Holmes will come to see him during the day. He has been away from the house for quite some time so he'll probably have a lot of “lordly” duties to perform....or something like that.
It's making it harder and harder for John to thrust effectively. To reach where he needs to reach inside.
*****************************************************
The cold atmosphere that, up to that point, had surrounded John seems to thaw somewhat as he says: “Sorry....you did what?”
Definitely good. It was good to have someone he trusted know and yet still not think differently of him.
John cringed a little internally. Stating things that were blatantly obvious was something Sherlock absolutely detested, but for some reason it was the only thing that came to his mind at that moment.
This time Mycroft did react. A look of surprise on his face as he saw Sherlock standing there, but underneath there had been a tiredness that had scared Sherlock.
“Good morning”, Sherlock says.
She has to know.
And then John is beside him.
“Violet Holmes”, my mother says and after giving him one of her more serious scrutinizing looks she continues: “You can show him your room, Sherlock, but he can't spend the night here. He's far too handsome.”
'I wish I could have met him.'
Maybe it's for the best.
But this......if he's being honest to himself he's been wanting to hold Holmes close and whisper gentle words in his ear for a very,
“I'm sorry”, Watson says, “I can't stay for much longer......I wish I could......it's already mid-morning and I have a lot of work today.....”
Something that got out of hand.
************************************************
The paint feels sticky and surprisingly warm on his skin.
At first he had been convinced he was still not awake. Still locked away in the nightmare version of his mind palace he had retreated into when he found his strength dwindling in a desperate attempt to retain at least a small bit of his sanity.
Sherlock's smile widens. John sounds actually pleased to hear from him.
I shake my head.
He will be left even more alone than he already is now.
John laughs again and Sherlock revels in the comforting warmth the sound of it provides him.
In the end it will do him no good.
He is not sure how Watson interprets his silence.
A feeling of ease and calm.
“It's really not.”
He had been the cause of too much suffering already.
At the moment they found themselves trying to hoist Holmes up from the bed and into the cooling water.
He tries concentrating again.
Voices drift in from a nearby corridor. He can't quite make out what they are saying.
“Did I ever tell you I have a sister?”, John says.
Sherlock's eyes had lit up.
Sitting in a corner, unnoticed, observing others around her all she ever expected out of life. All she had needed to be content.
High cheekbones......just like Sherlock.
John desperately wants to take another sip of his beer.....just to give himself something to do....break the tension that hangs like lightning between them....but his hands are shaking so much he's afraid he'll just end up knocking his glass over.
And smiles.
And as She laughed Sherlock's blood ran cold.
And now I freeze too. Because it suddenly all falls into place. All the signs had been there all along. The strange bruises that would appear on his skin from time to time, how he is always almost too polite to my  mother, his too quick and too rehearsed answers to all of my questions, how desperate he had been to not let anyone know what he felt for me....the two people he seemed to be.....so very different when he was alone with me.....when he didn't have to be afraid.....when he.......
Apparently its other people who find fault in it.
But....still....
A small ember of hope breathes itself back to life deep inside of his chest.
Or maybe he does.
Over the past few weeks he had tested him on several different occasions. All of them under slightly different circumstances of course. To see whether the events of the ball had just been a strange fluke.
John is standing close to Mr. Holmes when he poses his question.
She can't see very far, the downpour that had started up that morning and hasn't stopped since obscures most of her vision.
And so he just closes his eyes again, leans himself forward and kisses John's lips.
There was still a mischievous smile on Sherlock's face and John returned it as he shook his head.
“Oh, no, Sir! That would never do! You've only just recovered consciousness. You need all the proper rest you can get.....I'll be fine....honestly.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He's been watching John all day.
Anything.
Maybe get a new haircut.....
He wishes they could stay in this room....in this bed for the rest of the day.....the rest of the year preferably......the rest of their lives.
This time I'm the one that looks away.
Thick wallpaper adorned with what seemed like a flower pattern in relief.
Holmes was fast asleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
This ready for action.
“Why do you dislike me?”, John asks. His eyes two pools of blue that make Sherlock's knees weak and his skin tingle.
I shake my head and write down: NO!
“You bought them a gift.....name's on the card.”
Miss Hooper glances to the side where her aunt is dancing. The look on her face once again tense. “I'm afraid we don't have much time”, she says.
Just a bit too heavy and favouring the right side with every step.
The line of his mouth a straight and firm edge that hides his teeth.
Until, with his innocently posed question, he tore open the curtains I'd held tightly shut for so many years.
'I don't know.'
His eyes fluttered open for a second and with a raspy voice he said:
John hasn't missed a single one of their post-class practice sessions. And every single time he's asked Sherlock to come along.
He doesn't say anything in return but I feel him nod as his face moves against my cheek.
“Wha.....what was that?”, John says. His head is fuzzy and his mouth and throat feel dry. He blinks his eyes against the darkness of the room trying to find the source of the sound that has pulled him from slumber. Soon enough his eyes find Holmes in a small halo of light from a dying candle looking just as flustered.
They just continue as they have done for the past couple of weeks.
It sounds extremely loud in the still dark of the night. It sounds like his heart beating.
They are both idiots, Molly concludes.
In this version of the memory Finn is not here.
Sherlock himself doesn't even know if this is different or not.
And he had been right.
“I know what I promised”, he said, “and I will keep my promise. I'm a dark elf. We always keep our word.”
Maybe something has happened......maybe John has been in an accident.....maybe......
The curtains are tightly drawn because any source of light makes his eyes feel as if they are being burned out of his skull and his brain feels as if it's three sizes too large.
I can't go home like this.
She squeals again but very quietly this time and so nobody turns around.
Finn raises his hands and immediately the fire calms down again.
John really should be more careful.
At least, clean for now, the drugs will always remain a siren's call at the back of his mind. Tugging at his skin and thoughts, urging him to set his veins on fire once more.
Just the other day Andrew had been telling me that the way John is treating me is not fair on me, that it's not as complicated as he makes it all seem, that John really should come out, that Andrew wishes
I have to look away in case he reads what I am thinking on my face.
Not that Sherlock would want to be covered anyway.
Only....he's having a hard time thinking.
John does look at him then.
“Already on it, darling”, Mycroft says.
At first Mycroft had not reacted.
Silently he lists them one by one in his head.
“Just joking, John”, he says as he extinguishes his cigarette next to the one already in the ashtray and places a fresh one between his soft lips.
He kisses him again and again.
Finally Holmes looked him in the eyes again. Still John could see a sadness there, but his tone was stern and unwavering.
Of course, Sherlock himself had had absolutely no say in the matter.
“We should be at the stop closest to your house in about 20 minutes.”
How can John still think him amazing after the breakdown he's just had in John's house.....on John's sofa......
Finn waved his hand through the air nonchalantly and suddenly a couple of candles seemingly lighting themselves sprung to life and filled the room with a warm glow.
“Ehm....what's this for?”, I ask her.
He ends that nonsensical reply with a shrug. There is so much he wants to say. There are so many words hidden inside of him. Locked up within his heart and I just wish he'd set some of them free a little more often.
Suddenly Mary's tone turned cheery again: 'So, Johnny, are you going to Philips party next week?'
He can't  tell Mycroft this and so he just spews his acidic remarks towards him in an attempt to get rid of some of the bile and hurt that are threatening to suffocate him.
A movie?
Lunch-break is almost over and apparently John has asked him a question.
How she did not see.
I'd ran just as I'd done yesterday when he cornered me in a supplies closet and held my hand and looked at me with those bottomless eyes that give me a strange sense of vertigo every time.
His father's fingers dug into the soft flesh of his upper arm harder and it took all of his willpower not to flinch.
“Maybe you should hold it too, Sherlock, just to rule out every possible option.”
Grinning John stepped closer once again.
One of the side mirrors has been fixed with duct-tape and the car makes a strange squeaking noise every time John makes a right hand turn.
John was always happy. No matter what. “An eternal optimist”, Sherlock had called him on several occasions. And John had laughed at that. That's what John did. Whatever happened he would smile his brilliant smile and Sherlock would bask in the radiance of it as if it was the light of the sun itself. But today it seemed as if a raincloud had drifted in front of his usual sunny disposition and the entire school seemed to be just a bit darker for it.
He had hoped they'd get to this point but he never actually thought.......
Once again he brushes his lips against Sherlock's.
Trying to find a contact who was supposed to be there but in the end it had all turned out to be a big waste of time.
Sherlock sighed. That particular spell never seemed to work for him. He had no idea how Finn did it.
Just for a moment the magic is gone. Holmes' eyes pools of the darkest black and his hands cold and unfeeling as the thrum of his heart skips just for a beat and the room seems to be without air.
He feels boxed in. He's never been claustrophobic but at this moment he feels he might be.
I don't give him time to answer.
So, as they had found themselves quite alone in a secluded spot, nothing to separate their naked bodies but two pairs of short swimming trunks and the murky water, the scene could have taken a sexual direction rather quickly.
“Do you want to come in?”
Even in my dream there's a bruise underneath his eye.
Not what he had been expecting.
'Since Johns grades have been steadily improving, albeit marginally', she shot the both of them a dirty look here, 'since you have been tutoring him we have decided that you can keep tutoring him.'
I really don't want to but my eyes seem to have developed a will of their own and so I glance to the side.
“It might be fun to hang out with some people you don't know yet.”
Were I a more romantic soul I might even go so far as to call it “fate”
“You have a sister? I've never seen her around school.....” Sherlock is intrigued now. He loves learning new things about John.
**************
But there is a small sentient part left in my brain that knows we can't.
John was so screwed.
John tilted his head slightly and followed the length of his arm with his gaze.
********
And so, not knowing what else to do, he sat down in the middle of the meadow, his legs hugged tightly against his chest and he just waited.
Does he know about all these feelings John has started to develop for him? John himself doesn't even know what they are.
Until.
Or so he had thought.
Wouldn't that be hilarious?
It looks sincere.
For a moment he wonders if he should go back upstairs and see if he needs any help but then the creaking sound of footsteps on the stairs pulls him out of his musings.
“Intern, Sherlock. You're just my intern.”
What else can he do.
The words are loud and soft at the same time. Spoken from nowhere and yet everywhere all at once.
He looks tired.
He'd never looked at it that way.
She gives me a far too serious look as she crosses herself.
“Let's go back to bed”, Holmes says. His voice a soft baritone. Dark and velvety.
What is magic?
There is just this dark numbness inside of him. This feeling that, somehow, this is all his fault.
Now all he needs is a plan.
With a feeling of rising dread John quickly put on his clothes. After two days of nothing but Sherlock's naked flesh against his the mundane action felt unfamiliar, the fabric course and entirely too constricting.
****************
There's a smile on his lips.
In his memories those days spent there are full of light and warmth and happiness and sunshine and......
He had been in heat before. Of course he had. But this time it was different.
Her eyes snap back to him then. Cold, unfeeling eyes with something yet unnameable in their depths.
Thinking of John will only make him think of John's girlfriend and the fact that John is not gay and that John doesn't know the truth about him, about the drugs, and if John did know......
There had been no snowfall in these parts, but the nights had been bitter cold all the same. The dirt road beneath his horse's hooves was frozen solid and as a result the sound of its slow trot echoed loudly in the frigid darkness that surrounded them.
“Oi! I'm on the phone! Just a couple more minutes for fucks sake!”
***********************************************************************************
I recognize her by her long brown hair twisted in a neat braid that hangs over the back of her coat.
“Well....You're quite a lot to take in.”
He's been keeping himself awake all night wondering what he's going to say to John. How he'll try and flirt with John.....he still has no idea how flirting works. He's never had to do it before.
Holmes' words fall heavily into the void and the void does not seem to want to give them back.
“What are you thinking about?”, he asks again as he wiggles his eyebrows.
About John and the two people he tries to be.
Warn her?
then......
From that day on John visited Sherlock as often as he could.
“There was no need to be that hard on her”, he says.
Sherlock cannot deal with this right now.
They have fled like frightened animals out of the window and into the night.
“Oh, it's alright”, the girls replies. Her voice nothing more than a conspiratorial whisper as she leans in close to the screen, “I wasn't sure before but I knew as soon as he saw you in that suit....the way he looked at you.......I have a brother......who's like....”that”. The pastor says it's a sin but I don't think it is. My brother is so lovely and nice.....and so is his....”friend”....they always bring me and my husband extra bread and meat because they know I don't make much money and neither does Jim....what with him having lost his leg in the war.”
“It's four hours long”, he says.
More voices can be heard from the background and although he cannot make out the words he swears one of them is Bill's.
I really hope they do.
The words sting.
Probably not.
Maybe he's just trading one addiction for another.
They spend the rest of the afternoon in the cafeteria.
And when his back hits the mattress on his small bed again he closes his eyes and decides to forget about the future and what's to come just for this moment and lets himself get swept away by it.
“John”, he says.
When he did wake up it was well into morning and he was sore all over, but to his relief he found he could walk again. Albeit still with a slight limp.
John had looked good, out there, in the yard.
They say their goodbye's to Molly and make their way to the coffee-place together once more.
John hands him the letter and drops himself back into his own chair. He suddenly feels very tired.
Slowly John opened his eyes in confusion and once again he was met with the radiant gaze of Sherlock Holmes.
And he is sure of them now.
The smile with “something” extra to it is back on John's face now. The sight of it makes Sherlock's skin tingle. He wiggles his arms and legs in the sand underneath to try and calm the the sudden warmth that is starting to spread from his lower abdomen towards his chest but he doesn't find it to be quite as soothing anymore.
Always together?
He keeps his eyes closed and his breathing as even as possible but the heavy thump of a book hitting the floor takes him by surprise and still manages to startle him.
A secret added to the warm hollow between his hands.
It had not been alright. He had messed everything up.
Molly had not looked back. Had not blinked. She only had eyes for the spot on her mirror.
Apparently the curtains have opened again.
“I'm glad you came”, Even though the words are barely a whisper John's voice rumbles through his head and chest where he is pressed close against him.
His mind has been occupied elsewhere.
He just closes his eyes and imagines.
'You should try and get some sleep', he said.
And a young couple moved in. The Watsons.
But he cannot tell them.
“I could teach you.”
John gives him an incredulous look. The breakfast completely forgotten now.
Would he?
“He's ten years older than me. He moved out a couple of years ago. He has some kind of important government job in Oxford now. He comes over for Christmas usually but I haven't spoken to him in quite a while.”
A body that he doesn't know well yet but he can't wait to explore and make its secrets his own.
Once again I try to sleep.
“Molly......I'll tell you later....okay....just...”, I look around the cafeteria and lower my voice to a whisper, “....not here.”
I am not going to make any promises about a possible update schedule because you all know I never keep them.....but for now it seems I'm back!
Morgana licks her lips as she strengthens her spell.
Especially now that they are pretending to be equals.
I look up at him and he is giving me another smile. It's the one I love most. The one with the dimple and all these promises just barely hidden beneath the surface.
He made his way back to the center of the meadow in order to examine the flowers there.
He's straight.
“Why are you telling me this?”, Sherlock asks.
But...Sherlock has never been in a situation like this before. He doesn't know how to handle girls. He doesn't know how to handle guys who like girls.
John, apparently, is a mind reader because as soon as Sherlock's lips part John opens his as well and carefully moves his tongue inside of Sherlock's mouth.
He could feel it.
In those moments he lets himself believe this is not just for three weeks....or rather two more weeks by this point, but for the rest of their lives.
There is song.
“So.....where are we going?”, It's only slightly cooler outside than it had been inside. The difference brought about by a subtle breeze. Once again the moon has appeared from behind the clouds and, bathed in moonlight, John looks like something right out of a fairy tale. To Sherlock it seems as if the stars have descended from the sky in order to make a home out of the depths of John's eyes, the dimple in his cheek and the white of his teeth as his lips curl upwards into another boyish grin.
He's just thankful he waited to walk over until John left.
“You don't understand....you don't know them like I do.....”
*************************************************
“Really?!”
Maybe he has been quiet for a little bit too long.
“Hey, aren't you Andrew's boyfriend?”
Finn doesn't remember much else about the conversation between the two brothers. He remembers Sherlock giggling at some point and Mycroft smiling down at him proudly.
And of course that's not how it worked. That's not how reality worked. How the world worked.
He puts the picture back down on his nightstand facing downwards.
Coming home feels an awful lot like a firm and warm body moving willingly beneath his hands.
The rise and fall of John's chest as he breathes and the steady pattern of it.
But he couldn't quite make it convincing.
An older brother who is afraid that the world will bend and break him. Dim his light and  crack his spirit.
He finds he still can't think straight.
She keeps trying to touch him. Put her hand on his shoulder or arm and he keeps stepping away or shaking it off. He seems tense where she seems flirty and he keeps looking around hopelessly.
John is here.
That there is a price still to be paid for the great things he is still to do.
If there are any mistakes in the text: I have  no beta readers. It's just me.
Holmes seemed comfortable enough. He snored gently as he slept. He would be fine after some proper sleep.
He has confided in her so many times before in the past.
'I told you not to come, Sherlock. I specifically told you. I don't want you here.'
*********************************************************************************
If something were to happen to Holmes.......
Sherlock is pretty sure there is no sick aunt but he's not going to comment on it. If it gets him time alone with John he'll gladly pretend to be an idiot.
The voice is coming from behind him. For a moment he thinks it's Mycroft trying to give him some kind of comforting speech he doesn't need one final time......but he knows this voice.....this is not Mycroft's voice.......then he thinks he must be hallucinating......he might as well be with the way he feels right now.
John Watson was there.
He comes and I come undone.
So far I've gotten:
John shivers.
Not the new beginning I was hoping for.
John looks at him as if he has asked a question.
hasn't turned over.
John frowned a bit at Sherlock's explanation. 'That doesn't sound too difficult....'
My Mage stirs in his sleep.
It helps me to think about the picture and the man in the picture but not the man he actually was. Especially right at the end.
“You're one to talk.”
He feels exposed.
Wrap him up in his arms.
He's pretty sure Mycroft probably thinks he's being very threatening at the moment but John has had this conversation before. Mary's father had given it to him too when he first had started dating Mary.
He's probably been quiet for a bit too long.
Holmes remains silent.
Behind them somebody laughs. The sound a strange and stark contrast against the cold and oppressive atmosphere that hangs over their table.
“Blood......”, is all he manages to say, “it's everywhere.....”
He might have buried his nose in the hollow at the bottom of John's neck for just a moment.
“Don't bother looking for your John”, he says because of course he has noticed Sherlock looking, of course he has.....”he had the decency to call you an ambulance but after that he left and I don't think he'll be coming back.”
“You think I wrote this?” Sherlock tries. After an exciting case it always takes some effort to turn his brain on again but he's slowly starting to manage.
John had laughed too and it was then that Sherlock had decided he needed to get as far away as possible. He had booked his ticket to England not long after that day.
His room is too warm, his body too sweaty as the sheets stick to his flesh like a shroud and there's a tree outside of his window that keeps on tapping against the glass.
For some reason John was reminded of his sister. Who, after finally realizing she was a lesbian, had come out to their mother only to have their mother send her to a strict boarding school at the other side of the country. On the very rare occasions where his sister was allowed to visit home she always seemed a bit unsure, guard and walls firmly up. Hiding away her true feelings and true personality. Only when she was completely at ease, usually when she and John were alone together she would let her guard down again and to John it always felt like the sun breaking through the clouds. She reminded him of Sherlock so much.
I have plans to maybe return to it someday. (Give it an epilogue or sequel) but I am not sure yet.
I'm afraid I'll get to school and I'll be able to see it in his eyes.
But.....
From the corners of my eyes I can see Andrew raise his eyebrows.
They have things to talk about, matters to discuss, of course they do, but right now all of it seems trivial and unimportant.
His hand is on Sherlock's and once again he finds he's having difficulty breathing.
It didn't feel deserved....somehow....too easy?
Okay....he
“I'm 16 years old and we moved here from London because of my mom's job and my favorite subject is chemistry”, I say instead.
And with that, still holding his hand, he pulled John along.
The smile has gone from  Andrew's face now. He just looks concerned. At the moment he reminds me a little bit too much of Molly and her sad smiles and I don't think I can handle any more sadness directed towards me today.
What an incredibly stupid question to ask.
Mycroft had looked so apologetic and at the time Sherlock had found it strange that Mycroft would feel as if he had to apologize.
To Finn magic comes naturally.
Just something.
“I was summoned.” Once again the answer is short and honest. John thinks to himself he should kiss Holmes more often if the effect it has on the man is this unguarded truthfulness.
“You're so smart”, he had said, “how do you spell that?”
He can still feel Sherlock's soft plush lips on his if he closes his eyes.
After all, if he still needs Sherlock there to work up the courage to sit close to Molly then looking at her is probably a step too far.
'This isn't your blood, is it', John said. More to himself than anyone else. So he was rather startled when he actually received an answer.
************************************
be able to entertain the thought that
On the screen the bakery lady seems to have entered some kind of pie making competition but someone has tampered with her flour.
Even if Watson would have declined it.
What I wish he could mean to me.
I don't know when last I kissed him.
'Is he....alright?'
Holmes smile turns positively mischievous now as he shakes his head and lets out a small chuckle.
'So....what?' John said as his eyes flicked across the area around him trying to figure out what items could be used as a serviceable weapon in a fight.
“I'm sorry....”, he says.
“Hard at work?” Finn asks. Smirk still firmly on his face.
Eventually it's Mycroft who breaks it.
So, one of the maids then.
*********
John immediately felt a little less cold at the sight of him and he couldn't help but smile.
It makes it hard for him to sleep.
The detective gives Sherlock one last stern look before he walks away with a brisk pace and disappears into the house beyond.
He takes a deep breath and holds it.
There are not a whole lot of people in the cafeteria at this time of day.
The bed is narrow and there is not much space.
He's also starting to suspect that Holmes might be cheating at cards.
He remembers searching lips, shared breath, and hands sliding underneath pieces of clothing.
All purely coincidental of course.
He closes his register, takes his apron off and puts on his coat.
Behind him a machine beeps at set intervals.
The thought of him sitting alone in his room in the middle of the night thinking of me and of wanting to be with me just calms me down.
“Is everything alright, John?” Mrs. Hudson says and, to her credit, there is actual concern in her voice this time. However stern and strict she sometimes may be, she also truly caress for all of the members of the household. No matter how long they've been employed.
So that's what he was doing.
Sherlock grew up here and, in part, Finn raised him......after Mycroft.....well.....after.....
The alcohol definitely helps.
He had not been able to stop thinking about Sherlock.
Sherlock has, by now, given up all thoughts of sleep. Sleeping while John is still here and close enough to touch is an utter waste of time.
John feels an unexpected panic rise inside of him.
On the day ahead.
The one he usually sits on......and the one John sits on.
Wallace chose to completely misinterpret the sudden tremble that ran through the muscles underneath his too damp fingertips and decided to add his tongue to the already mortifying experience.
Sherlock feels his skin heat up. Usually he likes having all of John's attention on him but not right now. Not with Molly here too. It's just too much.
There are multiple ways to interpret this question and he knows the answer to none of them.
Must be something work related. They never seem to be able to leave Mycroft alone.
The next and final performance goes by in even more of a blur.
Disappointed?
He's acting on impulse.
Quickly he turned himself around to make sure he wasn't dreaming. And, sure enough, Sherlock was there. Just as he remembered him. A tall frame with slim, but firm muscles, raven curls that shone even in the light of the watery sun that had risen just moments before and two piercing blue eyes. Looking at him worryingly. Questioningly.
The regret and doubt that comes after a drunken orgasm.
It tastes even better than he ever could have imagined.
Yes, John.
In another dream he thought he was buried alive and in another horrifying dreamscape he thought his throat was actually made of glass and every time he coughed the glass would crack more until it finally shattered and separated his head from his neck for good.
His voice is deep as he speaks and aims his hands at Holmes while forming a triangle with his fingers.
I had imagined I would find the once familiar city changed beyond recognition after so many years but to my surprise I found that a lot was still the same.
John un-sticks his glass from the bar only to find it empty. He forgot he'd already finished his drink.
Because of his talent at sports he does have to devote a lot of his time and effort to rugby training and so he has little time for his other classes.....and it shows.
But I find I don't really care about that as much as I used to anymore.
John licks his lips and Sherlock bites his own involuntarily. It's a nervous habit of his. He can't help it.
“Hey, you”, John says.
Another comfortable silence falls between them. Sherlock briefly contemplates going to sleep again but then he'd have to miss out on the feeling of John's fingers drawing lazy patterns on his back and the rise and fall of John's chest beneath his head as he calmly breathes in and out.
Why should there not be a hidden magic in him?
John just looks down at his lap, the plate of food in front of him, the curtains, the wall.....anything as Master Holmes dresses behind the chamber-screen.
“Nah”, John says to the other boy and his voice is cold and distant and so unlike him, “I've never seen him before.”
John's had five different girlfriends over the last six months.
The way she uses of Holmes' birth-name so casually doesn't sit quite right with John. He is reminded of what Holmes had told him about sneaking in this girls bedroom window and he wonders what their relationship truly is....and what Holmes hasn't told him about it.
John always stays.
He feels awful.
“I could ask Greg to talk to John...”, she tries.
But he will not wait forever.
He sighs.
********************
Sherlock was panting heavily, but he was not about to give him a moment of respite to catch his breath. He liked seeing him like this way too much. Every nerve laid bare. Raw, honest, absolutely beautiful and completely his.
Perfect.
John cannot know he calls him “Rugby John”.
*********************************************************
Sherlock meets The All.
Somehow I am not as surprised to see the empty notification bar on my phone this morning as I had been in the days prior.
Watson softly moans as Sherlock gently bites his lower lip, then he chuckles and, even though they are indoors, stars light up all around them.
Too private.
Something has changed between them.
It'll have to do.
Sherlock is gorgeous. Stretched out underneath him. A slim frame with tight muscles, dark silken curls and the fairest skin John has ever seen on a man.
Once again swirling lights form in the darkness around them as he does so although not nearly as intense as before.
When all else fails he tends to bring up  Mycroft's weight. He knows his brother is very sensitive about it and it is a low blow but maybe it'll be just enough for him to drop the subject.
“Dog hair.”
It is Sherlock who dislodges their lips first.
Also: I have SUCH a soft spot for Mycroft! I like to think these boys used to have a very lovingly relationship, but it got derailed somewhere along the way. I also have a soft spot for Mycroft calling young Sherlock 'Lock' or 'Locky'.
And so I was adrift like this for many years. Centuries even.
“My friends can be a bit loud and obnoxious sometimes”, John continues, “if you want to sit somewhere else next time we can.”
She's all light, straight lines and composure whilst I am chaos, darkness and an overall mess.
And he does speak.
And he decided to give it to me.
He had seen her then.
He had met the lords of the surrounding lands. All of them alpha's at their finest. Aggressive, possessive and cruel.
“I've found Hooper”, Holmes says as he points to a young lady in a gray dress seated at one at the tables, “but she's still with her aunt.” It is then that John notices a very stern looking thin woman in a black dress with a sharp nose and a tight bun seated opposite the girl. Her mouth is a sharp, straight line and every now and then she will say something to miss Hooper and every time she does miss Hooper will sink a little bit lower in her chair.
'A splendid idea, Mrs. Watson',  he heard Sherlock say enthusiastically somewhere from beyond the fog that was forming in his mind.
That tells him exactly who and what he is.
spurring him on.
Because this chapter is a bit hefty I will devide it into two parts again.
A very stark contrast to what Sherlock had looked like when John had joined him for lunch the other day.
When he finally manges to tear his eyes away from Sherlock he finds Mycroft looking at him with a look he can't quite decipher.
And I don't ask him anything.
The words are coming from just underneath his window and as he looks down, as if on cue, the moon appears from behind the clouds and illuminates a golden blond head of hair.
I carefully tuck it away in my own bag.
'Will you be alright?'
Maybe because it's Sherlock...
It'll be fine.
No thank you.
The nurses pretty much bring John anything he wants.
Apologies for this not being the end yet.
I might actually blush.
'John? What's wrong?' Mary sounded concerned, 'Is it your leg again?'
Its muscles going from lean to big bulky masses he could only barely hold between his arms as the body stretched wider and wider still.
He had originally planned to ride all the way to the river, but with the sun torturing them both so violently on the open plains that lay in between Carterhaugh Castle and their goal he had decided to make for the wooded area to the north instead where they would be able to find some shade much sooner.
He is smiling at me. He is brighter and warmer than any sun.
John only half listens to the stories Holmes tells him about the lords and ladies that surround them. He finds himself paying more attention to the sound of his voice than the actual words. The way he seems to wave his hands around when he gets really excited about a certain topic. How the light of the chandeliers is reflected in his eyes and gives a strange otherworldly shine to his slicked back curls. The curve of his lips.....
And now he was left waiting like some kind of damsel in distress. Twiddling his thumbs as he sat idly by, unsure and uncertain, until the real heroes returned.
No sparks of light.
maybe.....
What to do on a date?
At his side John tenses up even more.
Somehow he feels confused and unsure and just a little bit aroused.
My fingers finding their place between his own so effortlessly. As if it's always been like this. As if it's always meant to be like this.
Right now they are both asleep.
Tall, dark and handsome......
John had never felt this way.
Mycroft lets out another long suffering sigh.
If he ignores the reason why he's on this trip in the first place he can even feel a small bit of excitement.....almost.
“You're not really John's cousin.......are you?”
“Don't”, Sherlock says, “when we're back at Holmes manor in two weeks we can be Master and servant again if that's what you want. We will never speak of this again if that's what you prefer. But out here things might be dangerous......you saw how Finn found me.....out here I need you as an equal. I need you well rested and I need you close by. So....for your own safety as well as mine....and for the love of God.....just....stop worrying and go to sleep.”
“I'm sure he wants you there, Sherlock”, Greg says to him. His voice soft and with just a hint of pity.
Bursts of colour and heat.
As he was scrolling through his list of contacts though, trying to remember where in the alphabet exactly the letter “M” was situated he came across a contact he didn't recognize:
Even thinking about it now makes his insides feel as if they are on fire.
He doesn't need the parties and social gatherings that the other boys seem to be so fond of.
But it's not alright. None of it is.
He most definitely does not want to ruin this.
He finds himself sinking
“You don't look fine.”
'Is there anything I can do for you, sir?', he asked. Still unsure why Holmes was here....and why he had been coming to the stables quite so often lately. Not that he minded as much. Holmes was still one of the most interesting people he had ever met and his sporadic appearances tended to brighten John's otherwise ordinary and monotone day to day life.
He just hopes it will not all turn out to be a mirage.
And so I let him go again. But he does promise me to sleep over again the next weekend.
And there it is.
'My line of work.......deals with the supernatural', he had said. And one look at his eyes had told John that he was definitely not joking.
There is a loud bang right next to him and then all he can hear is a high pitched noise as his vision goes dark and his left arm feels as if it's being torn from his body.
If only Sherlock wasn't making those noises.
“It's the king of spades”, he says as he turns the card around revealing, indeed, the picture of the king of spades on the other side.
The second time I saw your face was January 29th 2010.
John is thinking about him at.....he checks his phone's clock.....10:53pm.
Those are the moments when he finds his hands shake uncontrollably, his fingers cramp up and his throat swells so it's hard to breathe and impossible to speak.
But, as absolutely abhorrent and ghastly the sight of the creature is, John finds that the face is the absolute worst.
It has to be Morgana.
John doesn't know what to say and so he keeps his mouth shut. Lips tightly pressed together as he waits for Finn to continue talking. It takes a couple of moments before he even realizes he's holding his breath.
He's going to be running lines with John after school tomorrow.
“What's that supposed to mean?”, Sherlock feels the anger inside of him rise. It's all this talk about the prophecy and the weapon that's slowly adding fuel to the fire. This is not what he was expecting to hear. He was expecting to be told off for not doing his duty as a mage and then he would give them a piece of his mind.
“I'd love to read it sometime”, John continues talking, “maybe we'll do that one for the school play next year.”
The more he thinks on it the more his head starts to hurt.
She strokes his cheek with her soft ethereal fingers and he closes his eyes.
He shrugs.
There's a desperate wanting there that borders on grief.
And even now, as it all rushes back to him, there are still parts that don't make sense and there are parts that he immediately forgets again.
He feels a soft smile forming on his face.
He reaches for something to say.
Once again my mother wipes away my tears with her hands.
'You dare talk back to me? Even after you clearly disobeyed my wishes for you to stay inside in the first place?'
Long black cords ooze between her fingers as they slowly make their way to the ground. Sticking to her skin in the process.
There is most likely a fair amount of semen on the cabinet underneath the sink but he finds he doesn't care.
It was an exceptionally warm day. There were no clouds in the sky and the sun beat down on John Watson's head and neck as he slowly made his way across the open fields of Carterhaugh on horseback.
“Just be careful”, she says.
Before they can wreak any more havoc John takes my wandering hands in his and he leads me towards my bed. He's still smiling at me and as long as he keeps doing that I'm willing to do pretty much anything for him.
Sherlock decides to clear out the other comfortable chair that is opposite to John's and sits himself down too. Just to have something to do. He can't very well stand around and fidget all night.
bedroom.....from outside.
Today is agony.
So I guess we're going to this party tomorrow.
“What do you think that means?”
Death will come for her. Eventually.
Sherlock is still staring down at his coffee.
Helped.
“Why are you here?”
Or dying.
They almost never hear me.
He raises his left hand and out of the water that gently rains down from the sky he forms a message.
Not anymore.
Something almost sad....or bored.....or both.......it's not always there. Only in the moments when her husband is not looking at her. You would have to look carefully to see it. Of course Holmes has seen it.
'I'd rather be alone, thank you very much.'
No answer at the door to Sherlock's apartment.
Great start.
John couldn't help but smile again. How relieved he had been to see the master of the house return.
It's making his stomach twist in knots and the inside of his mouth taste like bile and ash.
Sherlock hated it.
He has no right to be jealous.
Tranquil and yet fierce.
Sherlock had been confusing.
Everything seems strangely familiar and yet very out of place.
“I didn't know you were gay......”, Mike says.
“No”, Sherlock says. Not because he would deny John what he wants but just because he cannot believe what he is hearing.
Failing to get a proper response Mycroft tries to ask him another question:
There was no “hello?” or a calling out of his name. The visitor just stood there and waited. As if he had all the time in the world. As if what he needed would come to him eventually.
Maybe I'm overreacting.
So he can buy drugs.
“Or girlfriends.”
The door stays stubbornly unresponsive underneath his hand as sherlock turns the doorknob.
Quickly.
He shuts his eyes tightly and then opens them again.
More snickering.
was what he'd end up with......he had hoped for something more....demure.....more
Comments are appreciated and cherished.
Slowly he feels his own eyelids closing.....
John doesn't like him that way.
That I'll have him all to myself again.
One that has killed and mutilated an innocent girl and is still hiding within the walls of Holmes Manor.
He's also got a large tome on ornithology ready on his desk.
John gripped his own reins tighter still, took a deep breath, put his heels to the flanks of his horse sharply and shot out into the clearing.
Right now I'm just enjoying how warm he feels against me and how sweet he smells and , just for two hours, how uncomplicated things can be.
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
“You two haven't had sex yet?”
You always think you have plenty of it but in the end we all run out.
A fairytale he has chosen to believe.
He doesn't.
How inevitable it had all been.
This is not how the world he has found himself in for the past 27 years works.
Something to take away the sharp edges that day to day life brings and submerge himself into blissful forgetfulness.
It had taken John a hot minute to realize the tailor had been talking to him.
“And he's okay with it?”
“When I kissed that girl”, he says.
'Mycroft?' his voice had sounded loud in the tense silence that had hung in the room.
John just nods.
She had thought little of it when she had first seen it when she got up.
And we dance to the music and I don't care that people see me do it.
None of the riders seemed to have even noticed him. They still rode on in the same formation, heads low, reins tightly gripped in unmoving fingers....
The last time he had still been a child. It had been the first ball he had been allowed to attend. Until that day he had only been able to daydream about the bright lights, music, clothes in every colour imaginable and throngs of interesting people.
His cheeks are delightfully flushed, his eyelashes flutter as he tries to simultaneously look and not look at John.
He needs to talk to Watson about the strange qualities of his magic whenever they're together too......sometime......
“That's adorable”, he says, -
I am burning up and made new by him once again.
He had not been the same man then as he is now.
But since I had multiple chapters to work with I felt I had space and time to flesh out their relationship a bit more.
As he is about to leave his room and tiptoe down the stairs so as not to wake Mycroft he takes one more look at his bed. He briefly contemplates putting his sheets back on the bed but, in the end, decides to leave them where they are.
I have not been pining.
“I have this thing where I look at people and I just know stuff.....about them....”
Sherlock does not appear to be fazed by the macabre images the tone of his voice evokes in the minds of anyone who hears it, he's dealt with monsters, demons and all kinds of creatures before, but the soldier shifts uneasily at his side.
Besides, there can't be that much time left before school starts.
It will be perfectly alright.
Watson and Holmes attend the ball. Miss Hooper might be able to shed some light on the situation.
There it is, he thinks. He braces himself for rejection.
Call it what you want.
He vows to himself to do everything in his power to help John get the girl he wants....even if that means he'll end up breaking his own heart.
“Can we talk in your dressing room?” John asks.
John didn't know how long he'd been sitting here in the meadow. It seemed like only moments. It seemed like forever.
How he moves. How he talks.
He immediately recognizes the hastily scribbled letters. He has seen Holmes' handwriting before after all.
There is a room in there that is fairly new still but it has many shelves and drawers already to house all the information Sherlock wishes to store in there.
'John?' Sherlock ventured as he got close enough for John to hear him. His voice soft.
“Oh, don't be so surprised dear!  I was there when that boy was born....helped change his nappies. I know everything about him.”
But then again.....neither are the penguins and polar bears decorating snowy trees while wearing jaunty Christmas hats that adorn the paper itself.
“We need to cool him down. He's burning up”, John said as he placed his hand on Holmes' forehead. A fine layer of sweat had formed all over his body but even the liquid was warm to the touch. Like lava, John thought. A fine complement to Finn's ember eyes.
“She was interrupting”, Holmes replies.
“Mycroft”, he hears himself say.
Sherlock can't handle it.
The anger he felt rising inside him the main reason why he gripped his reins just a little bit tighter as he gritted his teeth in an attempt to keep in the words that, if they were to somehow find themselves a way past his tightly pursed lips, he would most certainly regret.
“Just give me a moment”, he says, “I just need a little bit of time.”
There seems to be some sort of unspoken agreement between them never to go back.
Nobody would have to be lonely. There would be someone for everyone. No forced social interactions to try and get someone to like you. No nerves about whether you made a fool of yourself in front of that someone. No rejection...... Love would never be unrequited.
As always: my eternal gratitude for reading.
For the first time that night he felt actual hope rise in his chest as the shape in his arms changed one final time.
John moves his fingers through Sherlock's curls. Messing them up even more.
Many thanks to anyone who is still reading this.
“I see the resemblance”, John says.
As he looked down he could see a hand firmly gripping his arm and as his gaze followed the delicate fingers upwards along a pale and yet muscular arm his eyes met those of Master Holmes. A wild and panicked look on his face as his curls stuck to his neck and face, wet with mist.
Comforting.
Sherlock closes his eyes and the galaxies explode once more.
Some sign or proof that John has been here after all.
Someone has intervened with her spell.
This time Sherlock just shrugs.
They hang like a heavy selfish thing in the blackness in front of him. Ready to fall on him and crush him at any moment.
For the first time since we started this strange and confusing conversation he takes his hands out of his pockets and rummages through his own backpack for an empty piece of paper and a pen.
'Look, a horse', Sherlock said as he pointed towards a particular cloud as it drifted into their field of vision.
He nods.
As always: comments are greatly appreciated!
He doesn't remember soft lips curving up into a smile before they kiss his, he doesn't remember hands roaming underneath the blankets until they find his own, he certainly doesn't remember the blankets getting hopelessly tangled as two pairs of legs wrap around each other, a soft giggle escaping his lips only to be captured by the lips of another.....he doesn't remember any of that....surely not......and even if he did....which he doesn't......he chooses not to.
“I was just wondering”, John says, still not looking Sherlock in the eye, “since you're so good at this Shakespeare stuff......whether you'd like to run lines together.....once we get our actual parts.......after class......tomorrow....if you want to....... that is.”
'Boyfriend then? Which is fine.'
'He made up his own profession?'
Something just sort of.....clicks.....when he's with John.

(And if you want to leave a comment I'd also really like to read it.)
They are supposed to be roasting marshmallows, or secretly drinking beer, or talking about girls.......or whatever it is that two heterosexual best friends do.
At this point Molly moves in with her aunt.
His undivided attention is directed elsewhere.
I believe him even less than I did the first time around.
There had simply been no room.
“We'll cross that bridge when we get there.”
The moon is bright overhead and as its light is reflected in a puddle just to the right of the path it makes the water appear as if it were liquid silver.
He takes John's left hand in his right and places his other hand at the small of John's back.
John already has his hand on the door when he makes up his mind.
And after that....well....he had gotten too invested.....too involved....too dependent.....too.....
I haven't changed my nail-polish since our date on Saturday and the blue is already slightly chipped at the edges and I take it as a sign.
He wants me but just not right now. Is that it?
It's what happens to all mages once they first start showing any signs of magical abilities.
John cursed under his breath.
As he looks back on that particular moment in his life now the look on his brother's face is no longer an apologetic one but one of barely contained fear and guilt.
'Yeah...I suppose....alright then.' Sherlock's smile had returned again and once again John felt himself warm up.
They are so fragile.
John might not answer.
John coughed and shook his head. Trying to compose himself.
Have I just ended....whatever it was that we had?
John needs the extra credit.
Fire can burn you, it can hurt you, it can consume you whole.
He shook his head. A stray curl fell across his forehead and John could look nowhere else.
The silence between them lingers.
He waited.
“For God's sake, Sherlock......is he paying you?”
Well....that's partially true.
'You don't mean that, darling. I've seen the way you look at me. When you think I can't see it.'
John never made it up the stairs to his bed that night. Instead he crept inside one of the stables, covered himself with hay and fell into a restless sleep there.

******************************************
From the grand doorway to the Hooper Estate Finn watches as Holmes and Watson leave.
John was more like the sun.
“I...”, he says again. He doesn't know what to say. A feeling of dread creeps over him that is almost the exact opposite of the feeling of contentment that had filled him when he had been standing here alone.
He concentrated.
'I would just like to know what you're basing this on.'
On his face John sees, quite unexpectedly, his own worries and insecurities of the night mirrored and it is as if a weight has lifted from his chest.
And I am alone with Molly.
Maybe Finn will be back today with more news.
“And Watson?” Finn says.
Sherlock shrugs.
Eventually they came to a halt at the town's only inn.
He laughs at the confusion that's probably clearly written all over my face.
The last time I had seen him I had left him standing on a beach with an empty promise that I would see him again the next day.
Neither he nor Mycroft have said anything for the last couple of minutes and the silence that hangs between them is an uncomfortable one.
John's mind is hazy.
He thinks of his father, his sister....his mother.
But I want to know. I so desperately want to know so I write something else on the paper:
He's  not sure what this means. He's not really sure he wants to know.
He just crosses his arms too, for good measure.
She likes its ethereal stillness. She just doesn't like the dreams that nighttime sometimes brings with it.
Finn smiled again.
“It appears so. Stay close beside me John, we cannot afford to get separated now.”
I like to watch them when they sleep.
Thin lips formed around the same sad smile.
Saying things he's not particularly proud of and he wishes he didn't remember.
Neither of them said anything for a while until John finally broke the comfort of the silence:
He's put a lot of product in them to achieve this result.
The never again.
He had eventually found himself a job.
“Sherlock? Are you still there?”
John can't help but laugh. The sentiment is not returned as Holmes gives him an icy stare. He quickly schools his features and once again tries to finish his own breakfast.
Maybe he should choose the other option this time.
He looks at himself in the mirror again.
Sherlock wants to touch him there too but he finds all his limbs have gone boneless with bliss.
He feels as if he understands Finn a little bit better.
He should have left while he still had the chance.
Outside the weather is violent and hostile.
He gives me a hopeful look. His hands still in his pockets, the hood of his sweater sliding slightly back as he turns his face to look at me.
Mrs. Holmes was the talk of the town.
“Mister Holmes”, Miss Astley says. The tone of her voice full of ice and vinegar and then she turns to John, “Mister Watson”, this time her voice is full of warmth and honey and John feels himself reeling from the sudden and dramatic shift, “if you ever find yourself in the neighborhood again and in need of different company I hope you will come and call on our estate.... it would give me great pleasure.”
Even though he wishes he didn't.
He exhales and looks up at the sky.
I had known. Of course I had known.
“I'm always okay”, he says.
But before I am able to pretty much do anything Molly has already stretched out her hand and the shrill whine of the doorbell mixes itself with the noises coming from within.
“Good morning”, John says.
He really hoped his word was worth what he claimed it was.
And then another wail.
He had still been small. Only just come into his power.
John Watson tastes like perfection, he thinks.
Both of them are.
John felt a small pang of regret as the sunlight of Sherlock's smile was dimmed again, but all too soon his good mood was back in place.
“Alright”, Mycroft says and then just stops talking again.
Morgana has been excessively cruel to him today.
She looks so sad and lonely and dejected and once again I am reminded of the fact that I am her only friend and how happy she had been to have been invited to Patrick's party and how confident she had been and care-free and.......
And if every obstinate second will keep on taking an hour at least to pass it'll be roughly......he makes a quick calculation in his head..... two and a half years before he gets to see John again.
“There was a man......earlier......in a.......top hat......”, he is able to wheeze out. At this point it feels as if his brain has gotten too big for his skull but he needs to go on. He needs to remember. This is important.
Leave him with even more questions left unanswered.
Mary laughs with him. The sound is clear and bright and it lifts his spirits just a little bit more.
If anything were to happen to John.....
I immediately feel sorry for Patrick's neighbors.
tight skinny jeans – my phone and bus-pass slipped securely in the back pockets -  and a tight black shirt with a v-neckline. To bring the outfit together I've painted my nails in a silver, metallic reflective polish and I've spent a good hour putting product in my hair so, for once, my curls are tamed and I have something that slightly resembles a quiff.
“I wish you didn't have to go tomorrow”, he says.
John is here.
John nods as he casts his eyes down. “Again.”
He's so wrapped up in thinking of a way to ask Molly about “Person X” that he only realizes John is standing in front of him when he hears his voice.
“He doesn't come up in any police databases.....doesn't have a record.....who is he?”, Mycroft asks.
The words are spoken in the space between their lips. Only a breath of air remains. From the moment they had met Holmes had been the magnet he had found himself drawn towards and that force only seems to have gotten stronger.
have the theory that it possesses special powers beyond anyone's imagination.”
In the end everybody leaves.
'We're done here',  he said, 'come on Watson, there's nothing else for us here.'
For a couple of moments Holmes had just stood there. Mouth slightly agape as an array of emotions passed over his face as he seemed to process what had just happened.
Just as well....probably....
'Locky?' A warm hand was on his shoulder now and soon he found himself enveloped in Mycroft's coat. The warmth and smell that was distinctly “Mycroft” and “home” finally calming his nerves just a bit.
Outside a car alarm suddenly goes of startling Sherlock  and as his eyes shoot open he pulls his head back. John lets the lock of hair he was holding slide through his fingers and sits back.
He could still feel the all consuming heat of Holmes' flesh underneath his fingertips. It had scared him more than he was willing to admit.
But I do it anyway.
John knows what he's doing.
He has this air about him of a man who thinks he knows everything, is better than you and therefore deems everyone else to be unworthy.
“John”, Sherlock whispers. The sounds of his baritone voice so low now that John feels it vibrate through the very core of his being. He only just manges to keep himself from kissing Sherlock again, but it is a near thing. He thinks about kissing Sherlock while he's talking and goes a bit weak at the knees.
Holmes nodded.
It's his second glass of lemonade already.
Sherlock laughs and the tension that had settled between them lifts once again.
I don't know if John knows.
Sherlock takes a deep breath.
Sherlock looks at him for a moment longer with an inscrutable look on his face but then he just shrugs his shoulders, picks up his book and continues reading.
She doesn't answer at first. The silence between them is heavy and laden and it prickles his skin as it lasts just a little bit too long.
Only yesterday I thought we were done. I thought whatever we had, had come to an end. I thought I had ended us.
