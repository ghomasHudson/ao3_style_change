John barked out a short, amused laugh. "Your brother would have been happy to hear that."
SwissMiss - Thank you for this brilliant translation. Words can not express how much I owe you and adore you.
Mycroft shrugged his shoulders. "Let us just say I would appreciate it if there were no further killings of police officers nor - as far as possible - of innocent citizens."
There's a picset for this chapter too. They are fun to make… but just don't expect one every time...
But as it was, the security measure remained undiscovered and John was able to take his time observing the building where Sebastian Moran lived.
And so... he was going to go to John right now.
was hiring them, and the fact that we know where their families live. Each of them has at least two kids. They'll take the threat seriously and do a proper job."
"Good," John said and took a deep breath. And all this time he'd thought everything had blown over. The dealers had been found along with most of the cocaine, and those responsible were dead. But now it had the distinct appearance as if their troubles were only just getting started.
"Hmm?" John said without looking up from his phone.
"Is there still room in the tub?"
"You promised
, as she preferred to call them. She always had an open ear for their problems, and when necessary she would offer them a shoulder to cry on. She paid all of the necessary costs for medical exams and treatments, and in case of hardship, she would also give them a place to stay.
John couldn't do anything but stare after Mycroft with his mouth hanging open.
Information about Crieff:
"I'll be here," Sherlock said.
John’s story of how he’d received the scar on his shoulder led Sherlock to conclude that John could even sense a threat that came from behind his back. He hadn’t been fast enough that time either, but that was excusable given the circumstances. He’d had to turn around first, after all.
It was too much for John... the taste of Sherlock's skin on his tongue, the tight, continuously twitching muscles surrounding his throbbing cock... the sweet aroma of the crushed strawberries... the scent of sin... He let go of Sherlock's nipple, buried his face in the curve of Sherlock's neck, and pushed in as deep and hard as he could... he wavered a moment... then Sherlock cried out his name roughly... Sherlock's semen spurted onto his stomach... the wave of his arousal broke over him and he spent himself inside Sherlock's trembling body.
Sherlock had completely forgotten how thirsty he was, but now the need reasserted itself, and he drank the proffered water in large, greedy gulps.
"Three - two - one -"
"What are you doing to me..." John murmured so softly that Sherlock wasn't sure he'd heard the words correctly. "All right," John then said more clearly, rolling his eyes in a comical manner. "You heard Mike. Back to work."
"Then answer it!"
"But you can give yourself a bit of relief," he allowed generously, gracing Sherlock with his broadest grin. "You have permission to rub two fingers over the head of your cock." He loosened his grip on Sherlock's hair in order to give him an encouraging pat on the cheek. "Go on - what are you waiting for?"
A soft sigh sounded. "Fine," Mycroft granted. "There are other ways to get rid of a wife..."
And here are the translations of the French:
Happily, Mycroft reacted as expected … he bent forward, rested his arms on his knees and held the snifter in both hands, looking into it contemplatively. The crouched position only served to confirm John's territorial posturing.
"John!" Sherlock cried. "John... you..."
As was to be expected, he reacted violently to the nickname. "Stop calling me that!"
"Because he pays you an exorbitant salary - same as us." Then she started in on the list with a knowing smile. "Because you still have a mortgage on your house, because you're paying for your oldest's education, because your youngest wants ballet lessons and because your middle one's got her heart set on a pony. Because your mother..."
"Not always," Sherlock admitted, even as his hips jerked upwards to press against the crop. A languid attempt to seek further friction and stimulation.
“Good?” John asked, raising one eyebrow.
- he knew that he didn't quite trust Sherlock as much as he'd thought he did. Also, the mention of Peggy Brown in this context gave him a case of the giggles.
Sherlock's eyes promptly lit up at the suggestion. "We... we're really moving in?" he asked, almost bashful.
"I understand you'd rather have dealt with your own candidate... although … there wouldn't really have been much dealing necessary in that case."
John's eyes widened. He pressed out a soft
"John," he said quietly, yet firmly, waiting until John returned his gaze. "I'm clean." He held out his arms and gave John time to check over his flawless skin, which didn't show a single needle mark.
"What for?"
"No, he doesn't, but..."
"Mycroft - I don't give a flying fuck at the moment who you're punching doughnuts with. I just want to know one thing: can that bloody copper be trusted?"
Sherlock opened his eyes, mildly chastened (when had he closed them?) and licked his lips.
Sherlock relaxed a bit. At least John seemed to know enough not to use a petrol lighter. He followed along raptly as the match flared, as the cedar spill curled and caught fire, as John steadied the cigar between his lips and held the flame of the cedar wood strip to the foot of the cigar.
His head fell back in pleasure, but before long he brought it up again so he could look down. Sherlock's eyes were closed, the lids fluttering slightly. Then, as if he felt that he was being observed, he opened his eyes and met John's gaze without so much as a hitch in his motions. John was lost for a moment in those midnight-black pupils, blown open so wide they seemed to fill John's entire field of vision. Only a narrow ring of pale, blue-green iris encircled the almost bottomless darkness.
There was no telling what he might have let himself get dragged into otherwise...
John smirked. "Anyone else would have said, '
"No. It never was," Victor confessed.
When Mrs Turner put a plate of chocolate walnut biscuits in front of him, he was reminded so strongly of Mrs Hudson and his father's cook that he said, quite without thinking, "I prefer ginger nuts," only to immediately snap his mouth shut and look up at Mrs Turner in horror.
It wasn't until he and Mike were sitting in the back seat of his car, being driven home by Bridges, that John noticed the cold sweat on his forehead.
"We could just take a mattress and..." Sherlock persisted.
John chewed the inside of his cheek and ground his teeth lightly. "I know perfectly well that the only reason you're still using that cane is to make me feel guilty even longer."
Notes:
"No, not really," Mycroft agreed. "And when it got to the point where I didn't know what else to do, I had a conservatorship installed."
"We need to be careful," Mycroft responded, both evasive and half lost in thought. "The smoke detectors. A fire alarm would be most unwelcome at the moment."
"No one said directly that..."
"You noticed that quick enough," Sherlock laughed, wiping his eyes. The laughter and the movement of his abdominal muscles pushed John abruptly out of the warm, narrow orifice, and he gasped for air.
He put his hand on Sherlock's chin and gave him a searching look. "You didn't come. Why not?"
Sherlock's smile deepened. "You can leave John to me," he declared smugly. "He's in good hands with me."
Mycroft raised both eyebrows. "One presumes you mean illicit substances and weapons?"
"Let me come... please, John..." he wheezed. "Let me..."
, he would never have been able to muster the necessary calm and focus to complete his work on the accounts.
Sherlock gaped at him blankly at first, as if John had just said something in a foreign language. But then something jerked into place in him, and his gaze became more lucid and sharp. "Not a good plan," he said in a gruff voice, clearing his throat with an abashed expression that only made him more adorable. "I believe that's just an urban legend anyway. Dunking it would soak the cigar. That would necessarily alter the flavour, which would be a sacrilege with such a rarity. And before you get any ideas of warming the cigar over a flame before lighting it... don't! The wrapper would be damaged, the cigar would dry out and the smoke would be quite hot. You'd do better to toss it in the rubbish before trying a stunt like that."
"Ah..." said Mycroft, adding after several moments: "Surprisingly not."
In the meantime, Sherlock was already kneeling in front of him and had quite unceremoniously opened John's trousers and pulled out John's penis with clever fingers that testified of a great deal of experience and practice.
"What did he tell you about him?" John pressed.
Instead, John laid his hands over Sherlock's, which were still resting on his hips... John grasped them, seeking a steady hold … twitching …
Ordering the murder of Albright's nephew in order to get at Albright... unfortunately, that was something that fit perfectly into his pattern of behaviour.
..." Sherlock stammered.
to see it to believe it.
"Oh yes," Sherlock admitted cheerfully. "It burns like hell." John's quiet laugh rippled across Sherlock's body like a lover's caress. A glass was held to his lips.
"What exactly did the ice sculpture depict?"
Sherlock shook his head firmly. "Buy the concierge," he declared decisively. "The concierge has a key to the flat, he knows when Mycroft comes and goes..."
It was late, but not yet past normal business hours. Lestrade was used to worse from his work with the police.
Just like the act itself, the orgasm flowed as thick and delicious as honey out of John's body. His ejaculate pulsed into Sherlock's hole in a lazy stream, and it took what seemed like half an eternity before John had the feeling he was completely empty. He cleared his throat, patted Sherlock on the arse, pushed him off his lap, and got up.
If looks could kill, John would have been little more than a bloody smear on the wall following that remark. The fire in Sherlock's eyes was like a gauntlet thrown at John's feet. It amused him, and at the same time he was unable to resist the challenge, the temptation. Sherlock wasn't broken yet, but he wouldn't be able to hold out forever...
John's gasp was the only warning Sherlock got... apparently, he hadn't registered John opening his flies, he'd been so busy wetting the cigar, his senses too focused on the activity. But then all of a sudden, the cigar was no longer there; in its place, he felt John's hot, hard erection on his parted lips.
"But?" Mike pressed suspiciously.
That thought – as well as Sherlock's reactions to his virtually chaste touch – had absolutely no right to have such a stimulating effect on John's libido. John didn't know if his racing heart and the initial sexual rush overtaking his brain were good signs or bad ones at this point. He generally needed much stronger stimuli to achieve the degree of arousal he was experiencing at the moment.
John inspected the tips of his shoes just a moment too long. "You know why I go to her," he said gruffly. "So that something like... what happened after Crieff doesn't happen again. I'm doing it... for you."
... no games,” John panted, with some effort. “Just open your mouth. The next time you can … take as much time... as you want.”
"Relax, Sherlock," John said, caressing Sherlock's hip with his thumb in what he hoped was a soothing way, just at the spot where his bone stretched the skin taut. "This is for you. Just for you."
"No, Sherlock," John said firmly and with a touch of regret. "I don't have any lube."
was the one to initiate all of that? Anyone else could just as easily be behind it."
But now that mouth belonged to him, and him alone … The silk was wet and warm where Sherlock had breathed, kissed, and nibbled. John felt unerring hands making their way through the folds of his dressing gown, and then there was breath against his bare skin. John felt goosebumps form on his arms, and waited. But Sherlock didn't do anything other than breathe … deeply … slowly … stuttering a bit … and then … a moan … a soft moan … and then breath again, wafting gentle and warm and moist across the tip of his half-hard cock. If John had ever experienced anything more erotic before this moment, he couldn't recall it now.
A pic set made by me - featuring the more romantic side of the story.
"John..." Sherlock said, startled at how soft his own voice sounded. "John." He left his violin on the table, not paying it much heed this time, and went to John, who stood up and awaited him with a smile.
John pointed at the ring. "This goes under your glans. And this..." He moved the hook with the ball carefully up and down, ending by pointing directly at the ball. "... gets inserted into your urethra."
"Busy..." the doorman tried again, his voice fading, just before noting with relief that his boss was coming down the stairs. He tried to give her an unobtrusive hand signal.
Mike sighed. "Fine - so he's not your type. How about Lord Henry's secretary then? The cute strawberry-blond one from before..."
He couldn't fall asleep at all that night. The emotions that broke over him like a storm defied any attempt at categorisation. In any case, the possibility of having to compete for someone's affection was a completely new experience. To have to work for it was nothing new ... he'd done that almost his entire life. But possibly having to share John ... that was something he wasn't prepared for.
But Greg cut him off. "I'm still pissed at you!" he ground out angrily.
Kitty… I modelled her after Kitty Winter from the original stories of Arthur Conan Doyle. But if you like… you can also think of her as Kitty Riley from the BBC series.
“Are you sure?” Sherlock asked distrustfully.
"My stomach is already slick... I'm sure you can figure out why," Sherlock went on in a rough voice. "I'm so... so hard... and my fingers... I wish it were your... your fingers stretching me... opening... aaaaahhhh... Can I... can I touch myself? Just a bit..."
"Who are you talking about?" John asked.
Sherrinford Holmes, intensive care'
"All right... enough of that," John said and found he had to suppress a grin. "Come on."
"And here I thought the only reason you don't want me to go is because you're going to miss me," John went on in the same light-hearted vein.
“I hope not, for your sake!” Mike hissed. “If I were Sherlock...”
"Shhhh..." John made soothing sounds. "Don't cry, Sherlock. Not now. It wouldn't be very good if I..."
"No," he whispered, his voice raw.
Sherlock really was still lying in bed, but John was a bit disconcerted by his appearance. Sweat shimmered on his forehead, his eyes looked feverish, and his cheeks were flushed. Was Sherlock sick? Flu symptoms did have a tendency to pop up from one second to the next.
The statement became his mantra over the next two hours, but it didn't really help. Something terrible must have happened, or Mike wouldn't have sounded the way he had on the phone just now. Sherlock had hardly ever seen Mike be anything but sanguine, and if anything did ever shake him up, it was either something funny or else Mike reacted assertively. But during his call he'd sounded unsettled, as if he weren't able to completely judge the magnitude of whatever it was - and that was extremely alarming. A Mike who wasn't completely in control of the situation and didn't know everything that was going on? A highly unpleasant thought.
"Of course there was semen!" Sherlock retorted with a somewhat irritated sigh, finally turning around to face John. "He masturbated and ejaculated onto my back. That's all."
With this image in his head, indelibly imprinted on his retinas, John closed his eyes. The pressure of those plush lips on his erection was perfect and so seductive that John almost didn't want anything more than to ram himself deep down into that long, white – nearly swanlike – throat.
"And what am I supposed to do for an entire hour?!" Sherlock griped. "I'm already bored!"
Sherlock's arms yanked at his bonds as he screamed at the top of his lungs. Pain pulsed through his erection, which didn't become one whit softer, and even as the soreness slowly ebbed away, the lust-fuelled urgency returned to his groin.
"Which one is it?" Sherlock asked, a trace of impatience in his voice.
Sighing loudly, Sherlock placed his folded hands in front of him on the table. "What do you think I mean?" he retorted. "Are there any rules I should follow? Should I go around wearing a plug? Are there any rituals I should perform? Should I sneak under your covers every morning at seven and give you a blowjob, or should I wait for you naked in the bath when you come home to wash your back? What?!" Sherlock became more and more agitated as he spoke, and at the last question he threw his hands convulsively in the air.
John's broad, satisfied grin told him that he, Sherlock Holmes – the greatest detective of all time – had fallen for a cheap trick. John had never meant to maltreat the cigar. He'd just wanted to torture Sherlock. Sherlock's heart rate accelerated at the thought. Was that what John had planned for him? If so, it was extraordinarily cruel, creative, and worthy of veneration.
"You. Will. Not. Come. Have you understood?" John shouted harshly.
in bringing you round to my way of thinking."
"Holmes," a male voice answered.
Boundless relief coursed through Sherlock, and his spirits rose higher. John's hand still rested warm and firm against his back.
Not Jamaica.
When John told him, Mike gasped for air. "You did kill him!" he cried reproachfully. "Nothing else could be that expensive!"
How to smoke "properly". Inspection, cutting, lighting, smoking, drawing, extinguishing. Whether you leave the cigar bands on or take them off... (it never seemed to end... it's a real science unto itself).
He could deal with anything but
John had to smile at Sherlock's attitude. He wasn't entirely sure what bee had crawled into his bonnet, but he had an idea. His smile faded and he became serious.
But take comfort: Sherlock is one step closer to getting those biscuits (even if it doesn’t look like it right now)!
"Leave those two alone for a bit," he said all of a sudden. "I think they can handle it well enough without you spying on their every move." He tossed a glance over his shoulder into the cemetery, where two figures could be seen in an open space devoid of trees or bushes. One was tall and slender with dark hair, wearing a long, dark coat, while the other was somewhat shorter and had lighter hair.
"Say it!" he demanded harshly. "You've already proven often enough that you're the hottest cock sucker I know. We both know what you want. We both know how this is going to end... but I want to hear it from you. So... say - it."
"Are these the real books?" Sherlock asked with a tentative smile as his fingers glided carefully along the shelves. Leather-bound books with faded gold lettering stood side-by-side with well-worn paperbacks.
"I don't like them," Sherlock said flat out, shooting a look - dozy with sleep but at the same time both reproachful and salacious - at John's bare chest. John apparently preferred to go without a top as well and was wearing only boxer shorts.
He was so obviously at a loss for words with which to describe their relationship that John felt uncomfortable - almost pained - to witness him being so tongue-tied. His lips parted to help Sherlock out, only for him to realise that he didn't know what to say either - what to call what they shared. In order to cover his own uncertainty, he cleared his throat and said instead, "He made a pretty thinly veiled innuendo in that direction at our last meeting. That's why I did my best to mislead him this time."
"Inspector Lestrade... I... never had the intention of utilising my information in that manner," he replied in measured tones. "Please forgive me. My behaviour was highly inappropriate. I only thought... but I must have misinterpreted entirely the power of any allure I might have over you. Please, allow me to see you out." He extended an arm to show Greg the way to the door. How could he have been so stupid! All those little signs which - in his eyes - could only mean the one thing... all of it, a misunderstanding! Why hadn't he been able to keep his mouth shut?
- never
"Yes, I do," Sherlock agreed - and the effort it took to keep his voice steady and calm, banning any traitorous bitterness from it, almost tore his heart in two.
. Have you stretched yourself at all, or at least used some lubricant?"
Mycroft was here.
When John finally entered the room – his hands buried deep in the pockets of the long woollen coat hanging open off his shoulders, wearing his usual black polo neck top along with a blue-grey suit – Sherlock's mind was swept clean and he had no idea what to say. Too many unfiltered words clamoured for space on his tongue, but he swallowed all of them down. In the end, it was John's left eyebrow rising slowly – expectant, challenging, cynical – that released the paralysis that had settled over his vocal cords.
Sherlock, on the other hand... He seemed to be enchanted by the scar and everything connected to it. What a welcome change of pace!
Sherlock got into the back seat and - following a gesture from Mary - slid across behind the front passenger seat so that she could take the spot beside him.
' was clearly understood, if unspoken.
"From who?" John hissed quietly so as not to disturb Sherlock.
need you."
"What do you have in mind?" Lestrade repeated his question, but this time it was coloured by genuine interest, and the shadow of a smile passed over the mayor's face.
, and had been promoted by John to the position of his advisor. No one else knew as well as he did that John Watson and a bad mood made for a truly hellish combination.
John considered Irene Adler to be a tough businesswoman who would keep her doors open and her business running even if the world were falling to pieces around them. Therefore, the chances of her cowering in her office until he left were quite low. And he was right – when he entered the lounge where several guests and employees were already relaxing, he found Miss Adler standing right next to the door. Her smile, however, appeared artificial, not quite as relaxed and superior as usual. When her eyes lit on him, her fingers clenched briefly around the stem of the champagne glass in her hand, but there were no other outward signs of the emotions his presence triggered in her.
But knowing that the bastard had touched Sherlock... had his hands on him... right there... had desecrated something with his filthy fingers that had such a special meaning to John...
Lestrade shook his head. "No - Doc's got his own twisted code of honour. He never touches a hair on the head of any of his
"Fifty-seven times and you still won't listen! Why in all the world do you do something so stupid?
“It wasn't meant to be one!” Sherlock yelled after him, upset.
Thomas took an apple from the sideboard and took a crunchy bite. "Why're you complaining? At leasht the bossh's been in a good mood and leavesh ush alone," he mumbled through his full mouth.
First and foremost, I'd like to thank the cuddliest husband ever, who suggested that I look for a reservoir to use as the site of the final showdown, and who even found the pictures for me. Not only that, he put up with my moods when I wrote myself into yet another corner on the fourth draft of this chapter. He even commiserated with me once in a while. So a special thank-you to him - my very own personal 'conductor of light'.
"I understand... not only married, but with children too." Saying it out loud felt like a kick to the gut.
“I will never take orders from that cocksucker!” Jacques exclaimed indignantly, his words betraying his revulsion.
Sherlock turned his head, and all of a sudden John's mouth was no longer against his ear but against his smiling lips.
"That was a little more mess that I expected," John said, but there was no reproach in his voice. "Someone must have really needed that, hm?"
"Does anyone have some binoculars? A goddamn telescope? Anyone? Fucking sun... it's right in my eyes! Get three men over there now! Secure the exits!"
to," John declared in a calm voice. "But I
And I admit I cheated a little with the second picset... the scene doesn't take place in that context here. But it fit so well otherwise. Sorry.
"I want to do some remodelling upstairs," John answered, gesturing vaguely toward the upper storey.
After those first few merciless blows, John let off and Sherlock was finally able to take a deep breath. He sucked the air greedily into his lungs, tried to relax, tried to break out of the unhappy pattern of stuttering, panting breaths that didn't drag enough oxygen into his body and which brought with them the risk of hyperventilation; tried to steel himself for whatever John was going to do next.
. As far as I'm concerned, you may continue to call me a
the excuse the police have been looking for to pin something on you. A feeding frenzy."
"Don't I get a thank-you?" John asked with playful innocence, resuming the hard, deep thrusts, rubbing his stiff member relentlessly across Sherlock's prostate, stimulating it to the limits of what Sherlock could handle.
"When you said you'd... you know... have my wife
"You know what? You were a tad more expensive than I expected. So..." He wet his lips. "I'm not really interested in moving things along in too much of a hurry. I think we should take our time, enjoy things
Sherlock swallowed down his own discomfort in the face of John's despair. "John... you're the best thing that ever happened to me," he said gently.
"You?" John echoed casually, as if he'd forgotten Sherlock was still there... as if he'd forgotten that Sherlock had certain desires... as if Sherlock weren't playing a role. "You're allowed to watch me." The wicked smile again. "I almost think I'll be doing you a favour. You've been passive smoking with more and more enthusiasm recently. Haven't you?"
"Don't fall asleep, sweetheart," John said in a low voice. "Get up. Round two is going to take place in the bedroom. I promised you my dick – and you're going to get it."
John ran his tongue over his upper lip.
John chewed on the inside of his cheek. "Fine. Let's pretend for a moment that I believe you. What explanation can you offer, then, for the fact that the cocaine is not in your warehouse, yet there's no matching entry for the value amongst the incoming payments? Well? I'm listening."
John's mouth remained in a thin line, but his eyes twinkled as he carelessly caressed the foot.
"It must go on your account, dear brother, that Mr Watson was unable to be informed of the affair with customs in a timely manner." Mycroft turned to John with an arrogant smirk. "Really?
“Not in so many words. But that’s fine,” Sherlock said lightly. “Words can lie... deeds can’t.” He could still feel John’s careful fingers tending to him, each gesture, each breath, and each look asking for the forgiveness he’d long been granted. That thought warmed him too... just as the tender embrace had with which John had held him through the night.
With one final, deep stroke, he buried himself deep in the satiny heat, the waves of his lust breaking over him, smothering him, blinding him, and leaving him breathless, exhausted, drained, and incredibly satisfied.
"Yeah," John confessed with a lopsided smile. "Yes, it's true. I'm afraid you've ruined me for anyone else, once and for all. Are you happy now? Is that what you wanted?"
After then he had to remove the two bands from the cigar, as they would otherwise have burnt. By now, the cigar had warmed up enough to melt the glue holding the paper rings to the wrapper. It was a simple matter for John to open and remove both bands: the red-brown-white one with the manufacturer's signet and the silver-black one displaying two intertwined R's, certifying that the cigar was a '
"It's a good thing I don't sleep at night anyway," Irene responded, giving Sherlock a wry look. "But you probably don't either... Does your Doc keep you up often?"
“I want to buy him out from the brothel,” John confirmed serenely. “How much do you want for him?”
"You know what to do, I assume?"
Miss Morstan stood up from behind her desk and reached out a hand toward him, apparently in a half-hearted attempt to stop him.
But then Sherlock looked up at John, and when John saw the light in Sherlock's eyes and the smile slowly unfurling on his face, all of his mixed-up thoughts unravelled and dissolved like wisps of fog in the sun. His misgivings and concerns disappeared so completely that John forgot them entirely - as if he'd never had them in the first place.
"No, he won't," Sherlock said in a small, forlorn voice that was no less certain, as he continued to stare out the window.
John really had meant to go. To leave the room. As for how long it would have been before he returned – he didn't really want to think about it. But he wasn't armed against that pleading look in those pale eyes, in complete opposition to Sherlock's composed posture. He'd promised himself – and Sherlock – that he would never hurt him without a reason. If he left now without saying anything, Sherlock would be hurt. John knew that as well as he knew that the sky was blue and the grass was green.
"You've done shit," Albright interrupted him rudely. "What other explanation is there for my nephew..."
But Angelo had renovated the place years ago, and the little table for two was no longer there. The other table - the bigger, square one near the bar - they'd always taken when Susan and Victor were with them was gone too. John sighed a little wistfully, the way he did every time. He was usually able to shake off his sense of nostalgia right about at this point, but it hung on a bit more tenaciously today, and he was seized by a trace of melancholy. How young they'd all been back then... how ambitious... how carefree. In his dreams back then, he'd always seen himself as the boss - that was his stated goal. And now? Now he'd achieved everything he'd ever hoped for... money, power, influence, a villa, servants, expensive cars, even a chauffeur and bodyguards... but was he happier now than he'd been back then? He'd had Victor then... today there wasn't anyone for him to share it all with. All of a sudden, to his surprise, Sherlock appeared in his mind's eye.
"Thomas and the two maids are the only two possibilities."
"JOHN!" Sherlock shouted crossly. "With all due respect to your need to mark your territory... I'm bleeding to death here!"
The gentle suction, the greedy licks, the accommodating throat, and the warm, wet mouth made John tremble. A surge of heat rolled through his body, concentrating itself between his legs. His stiff cock twitched in Sherlock's mouth, and Sherlock pulled back. He sought John's gaze through half-lidded eyes, and when he found it, he held it and licked John's sensitive glans just with the very tip of his tongue. Each lick released a new tingle of pleasure, and it took John quite a bit of effort to maintain his rapidly crumbling self-control.
"Again," Sherlock demanded in a weak voice.
"Yes," John replied immediately. "A couple of my boys have already been down there and... tidied up... destroyed evidence and... made any identification slightly more difficult."
"Sherlock?"
"But- but..." Glendale whimpered as Dave and Naresh went over to him and frogmarched him roughly out of the room.
The only somewhat unpleasant aspect was the hard rubber ball in his mouth that was being used as a gag, and which was fastened in place with a leather strap behind his head. Sherlock didn't like the way it tasted, nor did he like the way his saliva ran down his chin. It was humiliating in a way he couldn't appreciate, even if many of Irene's clients did.
"Yes, I do!"
John grinned. "Anything's possible." He sat down on the bed, reached into the ice bucket, and came up with four ice cubes. "Ready?" he asked, faintly teasing.
Mike raised his shoulders indecisively before letting them drop again. “I hope he apologised properly to you at least.”
How long would he be able to keep his location secret from Mycroft now? How long would he be able to hide his true identity from John? And would John still want him once he found out the truth about him? How would John's feelings for him change once he knew who he really was?
Room seven was one of the best rooms in the house, one that was exclusively reserved for very special clients. It was furnished in a pseudo-Victorian style, which was one of Irene's weaknesses. It had everything... a big canopy bed, a couch, two armchairs, the usual cabinet with all kinds of utensils, a fireplace, and even its own bathroom with an oversized bathtub.
John was grateful to him for that. Grateful that they didn't have to talk about it. Grateful that Sherlock was able to simply understand certain things - or at least to accept them without reservation. John was so grateful for Sherlock's silent accommodation that he actually did feel the need to talk about it now. He passed his tongue over his upper lip. It had been a long time since he'd been so confused by his own thoughts and desires.
"I never said I'd call you at all!" John countered with a laugh.
was he supposed to say to that? But before he could come up with anything, his counterpart continued speaking.
God - it was wonderful. Wonderful and liberating. His hand burned from the impact of the hit, and Sherlock's fair skin now sported the flaming imprint of his fingers. Ever since the moment when he'd run into Victor in Crieff, he hadn't been able to breathe as easily as he did now. John sucked in air with a deep feeling of relief, as if a heavy weight had been lifted from his chest.
"What makes you think that
"I think... for you..." John fell silent. He didn't really know what he should say... what he wanted to say...
“No,” Sherlock cut him off. “It’s about Albright.”
"Yes," Sherlock admitted his error. It was difficult to say the word, yet he forced himself to as it was the truth.
"But I might also have infected you..." John pointed out.
"I don't want you to go!" Sherlock repeated, even though he knew that by doing so he was just making things worse. He knew John was at the end of his patience. He knew John was irritated and overtired. He knew all of that. And yet he couldn't stop pouting and prodding and whinging and acting very much like a small, unreasonable child.
It was a mystery why it was so incredibly simple for Greg to undermine Mycroft's entire way of life with a single glance. A mystery that put him increasingly on the defensive... which meant his desire - his
"You know what you need to do before you're allowed to come."
"Very good," Jacques replied, filled one of the cups with expert ease, added some milk, brought the cup to John and set it down on the low coffee table.
"Somewhat," Sherlock admitted grudgingly.
"It's bloody well good for you to quit smoking," John retorted angrily. "We'd agreed that you were really and truly going to give it up this time."
. What for? Everyone knew what position he occupied in John's life - and in his bed.
Mycroft had himself well enough under control that he didn't start making accusations about how Sherlock had lied to him in all this, and John in return didn't make any insinuations about Mycroft's
He'd taken the drugs to make his life halfway bearable - that wasn't really a problem. John would understand that. As his life at Irene's hadn't been unbearable, it had been relatively easy for him to do without the drugs.
Sherlock moaned, and John felt the vibration through the narrow, heated sheath surrounding his firm flesh.
' he thought to himself, not without a certain amount of irony. It was probably an act of defiance - or a way to prove something to himself - that caused him to spend an inordinately long time choosing his clothes today. A dark grey suit... with a light blue... no... a white shirt... socks, underwear... He took his time getting dressed quite deliberately, straightened everything carefully in front of the mirror, gave the box one last glance, waited until the stabbing sensation inside him receded, and then walked out of the room without looking back.
Greg stared at him wordlessly and ran both hands through his hair before finally saying, "That's why you didn't come see me in hospital. To keep me out of the line of fire."
' for once."
“The two of you are bloody well cracked,” Mike huffed before turning on his heel and leaving the office.
Mycroft peered at the phone display. It showed the photo of Sebastian Moran which he'd forwarded to Sherlock.
The only answer was a nebulous "Hmm," and a faint shrug. "You have all of Giuseppe Verdi's most important operas in your collection," Sherlock then stated apropos of nothing. "All except
They regarded each other silently, each trying to assess the other, gauge his reactions, and find his soft spots.
Irritated and a little annoyed at himself, Mycroft shook his head at his own sentimentality. Under no circumstances could he afford to lose control. Mummy had never lost control over herself. And she had expected no less from him, from his earliest childhood onwards. That was the example she'd given, and the way she'd raised him. She had been...
When Sherlock was done, he decided he didn't find the idea half bad after all.
subject... You have to do me a favour," he blurted out. Now that he'd taken the first step, he was once again able to look her in the eye.
"A fantastically bad one, in fact," Sherlock yawned. "By William McGonagall... He can claim for himself the dubious distinction of being the worst poet of the English language... but at the same time he's also the best-known Scottish poet... right after Robert Burns."
The detonation would then occur when the vehicle slowed by at least 20 miles per hour.
Mycroft knocked the last man off his feet with the help of the handle of his umbrella. When he lay senseless on the ground too, Greg put his torch away.
"Consider it done," he told John without looking up. "I know just the right people. People with big, empty pockets who are just waiting for us to fill them." He picked up the next letter. "Do we have to stick to any particular budget?"
John gave him an indulgent smile. "I suppose you can get things set up in the new bathroom. I'd really prefer it if
And right then, at that moment, Sherlock was happy... happier than he'd ever been before in his life... happier than he'd ever thought possible.
John's gasps were music to Sherlock's ears. John's voice in his head... his mouth filled with John's stiff penis... John's smell in his nose... the taste of John's arousal on his tongue...

Lestrade exhaled in a low whistle. "I can imagine that terrorists and the mob are going to throw a bit of a spanner into those plans. Not to mention all the petty crooks. Or did you want to take them all on at once?"
“I really don't know why I let you get away with talking back to me all the time,” John mused with a stern edge to his voice. “I should gag you much more often.” He regretted the words as soon as they were spoken. He'd thought long and hard about how he wanted things to continue between himself and Sherlock. There was no question in his mind regarding giving up bondage and spankings, and he was relieved to hear that Sherlock saw things the same way. But he had very mixed feelings about using gags after that incident... they'd never been his favourite implement, but since that evening... maybe he would have listened to Sherlock if he'd spoken up... if he'd
"Good God, Sherlock!" Mycroft sounded completely outraged, which did cheer Sherlock up. "You're a Holmes, after all! Why would you wish to throw yourself away on this man with his perverted little games?"
?” John pressed in bewilderment. “Of course you can! Did you not understand me? I took care of everything with Miss Adler. You're free. All of this...” John's eyes swept through the room, not able to find the right words. “You can leave all of this anytime you want,” he said. “Anytime.” He waited a moment. When there was no response from Sherlock, he asked, unnerved, “Are you crying? Do you need a handkerchief?” He took a monogrammed handkerchief out of his jacket pocket and held it out to Sherlock, somewhat awkwardly.
"Can't believe that's my arse..." Greg murmured from time to time.
Later that same evening, John was alone in his office. He didn't know how long he'd been sitting there in his chair, staring at nothing, but it was long enough that the ice cubes in his glass had all melted. It had been nice at Mike and Susan's, and he'd felt a bit better about all his problems. It had helped to talk about what had happened earlier. After dinner, though, he'd only had one glass of wine before having Bridges drive him home. Once there, he'd been overcome once again by doubts as to whether he'd really be able to find a solution to his troubles fast enough. The sun had gone down already, but although it was almost 10 PM, he was still able to make out the wooden box on the coffee table in the blue-yellow twilight. John had taken it out of the locked cabinet that stood in one corner of the office and contained a few things his staff really didn't need to know about.
"69?" John asked, raising both eyebrows as Sherlock's semi-hard penis came closer to his mouth.
"That's quite simple, Sherlock... it's
“Sherlock...” he began hesitantly without really knowing what he wanted to say... only to hear soft snoring sounds next to his ear. Sherlock had fallen asleep on his shoulder.
This time John couldn't help chuckling a bit. "We're rather rude today, aren't we?" he said, but he complied with Sherlock's wish and shoved his erection into the pliant opening again.
"That's completely different!" Mike protested as he wheezed and grabbed for the railing.
Absolute fantastic fan vid by mikabee !!!!!
"Such a charming man," she whispered softly to Mike. "Be nice to him now!"
"Yes... please..." Sherlock whispered, breathless.
"Please... John," he pleaded at some point. "
John didn't respond to the obvious provocation. "Oh, torture has a long and rich history," he declared cheerfully. "It was recognised by the courts in the Middle Ages as a means of getting at the truth."
"Two hours! If John isn't back in two hours, I'm breaking this door down!"
"Jason!" Sherlock growled threateningly into his mobile phone.
"No... but..." Sherlock wrinkled his brow. "You didn't just want my permission?" he pressed as he finally seemed to understand. "You really want to talk about it beforehand?"
“I should say so,” Sherlock huffed. “That's not fair! I've really been very good the past few days, and I...”
"Yes," John said emphatically.
"You do realise we run the danger..." Mycroft started to point out before Greg's kisses interrupted him again. "… that a reporter will follow me at some point, and then..."
and go already?”
"Fine, all right. If it makes you happy," Sherlock said with an indulgent sigh. "If you ever attempt to attack or injure me, I will defend myself. Happy?"
"How soon can you go again?" he asked sportingly.
Greg had just taken the last drag on his cigarette and choked on the smoke upon hearing Mycroft's words. He coughed and gasped for air. When he could breathe again, he said hoarsely, "Can't. No chance. My wife's Catholic like nothing you've ever seen. Of course she only believes when it suits her agenda," he added sourly.
"I didn't want that," John said, although it wasn't clear what exactly he was referring to. He wasn't even sure himself. The urge to put his arms around Sherlock was quickly becoming overwhelming.
"Good boy," John praised him, and promptly removed his hands from Sherlock's body.
"Neither is your brother."
"I have a vague idea," Sherlock answered and felt John's lips as well as his muffled laughter against his back.
"I knew it!" he yelled. "I knew you'd done something! John – I know you're going to hate me for this, but reconsider what I told you about that therapist. I really think..."
John bit his lower lip in order not to moan again. He had to clench his fists at the second swallow. The third swallow had him closing his eyes. At the fourth swallow... he had to exert all his willpower not to lose control and thrust repeatedly into that deep, narrow throat.
"John..." Sherlock whined softly. "Please... let me … I … I can't..."
’ … I chose the opera because the libretto seemed appropriate. A princess who has every suitor beheaded who can't solve her riddle, and ends up finding love in the end anyway? If that's not spot on!
... I can't believe this! How could you..."
"WHAT?" Sherlock blurted out, stunned. "John, I... please... what..."
"So you'd like to have Sherlock all to yourself?" she began, and when John nodded, she continued: "Then all that's left to discuss is the price." She named a sum and John laughed.
While he was still gasping for breath, he looked down at Sherlock, lying underneath him with his eyes closed and his limbs limp. Only the motions of his chest as he breathed showed that he was still amongst the living.
Sherlock bit his lower lip. He had a pretty good idea what was coming, and John didn't disappoint him.
"Yes. Us," John answered simply and went into the attached bath which the room was also furnished with.
Sherlock's respiration had increased during the course of the crop's journey across his body, and his mouth still hung slightly agape, as if he couldn't get enough oxygen. His eyes had fallen shut again, and as soon as he felt the small yet threatening scrap of leather on his cheek, he began to stretch his neck and rub languorously against it, like a cat begging to be petted.
Translation by the awesome SwissMiss!
John shot him a lustful smile. "And now – all of a sudden – you're interested in getting fucked up the arse?"
Sherlock gave the offer serious consideration. "That would be one solution," he finally replied, sighing heavily.
Just Mike and Susan and himself... no big house, no staff, no bodyguards, and... no Sherlock.
Teetering between amusement and anger, John's voice quivered as he asked, "
"I'm giving you to John," Sherlock said into the phone before handing it over. Mycroft's clamorous
Finally, John moved out of his staid pose and stepped over to the sideboard.
The complete frankness, bordering on naive, almost made John giggle again, but he was manfully able to suppress it.
Sherlock appeared irritated at first, but then he said slowly, "He... appreciates me."
"Carry me..." Sherlock sighed, stretching his arms out to John like a child.
They held each other's gaze, both knowing that they weren't talking about Donovan or any other sinister plots now.
John looked at him, appearing for all the world like the personification of a guilty conscience. "How would you know? You have no basis for comparison!"
Charlie fell silent, sank his eyes and shook his head.
Mycroft stared after him, dumbfounded, until he lost sight first of Greg's figure and then his grey hair in the crowd.
"Fine?" Mike exclaimed. "
Sherlock returned her smile shyly, and a warm sensation spread through his chest.
John rubbed his hand over his face. He couldn't believe it! Which higher power exactly had he offended? Someone up there really had it in for him! There was no other way of explaining why everything that could possibly go wrong, was.
The sound alone made Sherlock's knees turn to jelly. He swallowed again.
,' but Albright didn't react to the barb. His face was bone-white, with just two spots of high colour on his cheeks.
When he'd just stood there gaping at her in disbelief – completely unable to move or even understand that his suffering was almost at an end – she'd laughed and said, "Come on, get going, my little virgin. Get to work! The clock is ticking – you'd better start getting ready for your
"Not there..." John said, amused, and let his gaze wander lower.
Scepticism coloured Mycroft's bewilderment, along with something like fascination. An expression that was so familiar to John from his interactions with Sherlock that it touched him in an odd way. It was rather discomfiting to recognise that look on the mayor's face.
“No, I mean... dammit, of course I'll tie you down!” John cried impatiently, feeling a bit helpless. “I'll tie you down and hit you. There's … no sense otherwise... I'm not going to change myself. I'm not going to give something up that I enjoy just because you might...” Sherlock's choked sob startled him, and he fell silent, watching in amazement as Sherlock rubbed his eyes with a trembling hand.
"You know..." Mike remarked smugly.
John checked his watch and raised an eyebrow. "You can't possibly need something to eat again already?" he teased in a friendly way.
"Say what you will, Anthea," Thomas remarked cheekily. "The boss seems to like what Mr Sherlock has on offer - as you can hear loud and clear."
John's heart leapt in his chest at those words, then started beating much faster, feeling almost weightless, but out of habit he concealed his emotions behind a short laugh.
Mycroft nodded imperceptibly. "Gregory." His eyes wandered to the plaster still decorating Greg's temple. "Your recovery is progressing, as I see."
The interplay of hot and cold, of shock and pleasure, caused John to cry out softly. The sight before him did the rest, releasing several erotic associations in John's brain. His hips jerked and Sherlock took in John's erection deeply, until John felt the tight, willing throat around the head of his penis. Then Sherlock swallowed, and John panted with bliss. He tossed his head back against the hard edge of the chair back and bit down on his lips.
All thought and sensation was reduced to those few square inches, whose stimulation provided Mycroft with a lust he hadn't felt in a very long time - perhaps not ever. It was exciting... nerve-wracking and arousing at the same time. Mycroft's legs shook as he drove into Greg's heated body, faster and faster, chasing his orgasm, blind to everything else around him.
"Our father offered you the protection of his name, and I simply cannot fathom how you can walk all over a gift like that with your behaviour! Nevertheless, I have absolutely no desire to return you to heart and hearth - as you put it so poetically. The less I see or hear of you the better. And that seems to be fairly assured with you … here." Mycroft laid in an artful pause, but Sherlock was too busy thinking about what Mycroft had just said to reply anyway. Had he heard correctly? Mycroft was giving him up voluntarily? He wanted to leave him here with John? Without any... return favours? Without any conditions? Just like that? Sherlock wanted for it to be true, but when had anything good ever happened to him? He stared at Mycroft, suspicious and just a bit breathless. Mycroft returned his gaze with slightly narrowed eyes.
"I'm not even sure I should have told
"Sherlock, I saw the clothes you brought," John answered with a soft sigh. "They're a bit … well, shabby. And there's not enough. I didn't intend for you to walk around the house naked. And since you don't intend to ever leave the house, my tailor has to come here. He'll take your measurements and get to work. I've already told him what you need. He knows what to do." John's gaze slid over Sherlock's morning attire. "Although, now that I think about it - I should probably add pyjamas and dressing gowns to the list."
Once he was by himself again, John's gaze became dull and empty. The entry hall was dark and deserted, and he was all alone. No sound penetrated the space around him. The only thing he could hear was his own breathing. Stuttering. Pained. Gasping for control.
Carefully, John blinked and risked a peek at Sherlock, who was still standing next to the bed as if frozen. He was still holding the duvet in his hand. Transfixed, he was staring at John’s erection.
Sherlock nodded.
"I hope you're not done with me," he said enticingly, at the same time issuing John a challenge.
“Why?”
John smiled. "He cost me a sight less than the whore you keep in that flat in Chelsea. And he's better with his mouth too, that's for sure. How's your wife, by the way?" he replied calmly. His smile turned icy just for a moment, before warming again as he turned to his other guests. "Jacques, Thomas - the good whiskey for my friends. The really good stuff!"
"You know, that... what was his name? That Adler boy... Sherlock?"
"Can't the mail wait until tomorrow?" he begged unabashedly.
John had resumed giving copious attention to Sherlock's nipples, with the result that Sherlock was writhing and squirming with lust beneath him, arching his upper body toward him as much as possible. Sherlock was positioned on the table in such a way that he was able to grind his stiff, slippery erection unremittingly against John's still-clothed lower body. He did so with abandon, pleasing John with his shameless moans.
"Yeah, go ahead and make fun," Greg growled.
Sherlock lay there, his eyes closed, ignoring his aching body, and heard the sound of John snoring lightly.
John swiped the wet hair away from his forehead and pressed his lips together unhappily.
"I don't want you snooping around my office," John explained firmly. "No matter if I'm in here or not. When I'm in here, I'm working and don't want to be disturbed. And when I'm not here, you have no business being in here anyway." He waited for a moment, but when Sherlock continued to give him a slightly puzzled look, John pursed his lips. "I don't want to see you in here. Not under any circumstances. Got it?"
"Yes, it is," Sherlock insisted. Then he hesitated briefly, giving John a once-over before continuing: "Don't get me wrong. If you ever do that again, I'll break every bone in your body, one at a time." The threat, spoken in an even voice, was much more effective than any irate screams, and John could virtually feel, physically, how attracted he was by the unexpected menace emanating from Sherlock. Just another one of his bad habits. Danger was – and would always be – a potent stimulant for him. And it was for that reason that Sherlock's next words took a while to penetrate his consciousness.
"Why?" Sherlock asked, as if that didn't make any sense. "He doesn't even know me."
John thought to himself, licking his lips in anticipation.
John lowered his eyes, stricken. Sherlock was right... now he remembered. He'd made it clear to Sherlock that he'd only brought him into the house for sex. It was only understandable that Sherlock now believed there was no longer a pretence for his presence. But didn't he know that he was much more than an extremely satisfying sexual partner to John, and had been for quite some time?
"But why? I... I would have..."
"Excuse me?!"
Sherlock's expression lightened with sudden understanding before darkening again immediately. "You never intended to take my virginity that first night!" he complained.
"Yes, that's what Violet wanted, isn't it? For him to grow up with me. Together with his brother." He paused for a moment. "Miss Adler. He's my son. I promise you he won't want for anything with me."
Sherlock didn't know what to make of that, or what to say. So Mike was the one who'd prompted John to go to a brothel? Then why had he looked at him with such disdain, bordering on contempt?
Maybe that was because of the jeweller's calling card he'd passed on to Sherlock several days ago.
"Thomas... I need something," Sherlock murmured just loud enough for Thomas to understand him.
“And what did you use? Knives? Guns? Or did you go for the old mob classic,
Sherlock looked down at his hands and discovered, to his surprise, that they were shaking.
"A St. Andrew's cross?" John repeated in a strangled voice. "What do you think this is going to be? Some kind of S and M club?"
"I hope you brought something else along instead of the pliers..." he said meaningfully. The men scrambled to present their tools. John's eyes scanned the proffered objects - which Charlie couldn't see, as the men were outside his field of vision.
His constant, low-level arousal didn't necessarily make his job any easier, even if his clients enjoyed very much the fact that it was suddenly so easy to rouse his erection. The fact that he never climaxed – or attempted to – was generally met by his clients with little more than a shrug of their shoulders ... if they evinced any interest at all.
He thrust fast and rough, virtually hammering into Sherlock's body, trying desperately to prove he was still alive, still breathing, that his heart was still beating, that his body was still warm and full of life, that there was another warm body willing to take him in, to give him warmth and affection.
He needed to order his thoughts one last time, set everything straight in his head so that he'd be prepared when John was back here with him. Also, he knew... if he stayed in the house even one second longer, he was going to disobey, tear open the door to the bedroom, and admire the bed that John had bought for them. He might even go so far as to roll around on the blue sheets and...
Greg absorbed Mycroft's reply with diffidence.
Sherlock froze.
Albright was sitting at a desk with Moran standing beside him. Both of them were looking at the screen of a laptop computer on the desk in front of Albright. When the little group burst in on them uninvited, however, the two men looked up.
“And then?” he asked hoarsely.
"Because I believed you were the guilty party. Why chase after Indians when you know where the chief lives?"
"Your fault?" John cried. "Sherlock, that's ridiculous. No one's at fault other than Jacques... and... possibly me," he admitted following a bit of hemming and hawing. "I should have put an end to that behaviour from the start."
Sherlock's cock throbbed, swelled even further, his body arched up, thrashed against his bonds, and then a devastating orgasm broke over him. John continued fucking him through his entire climax, extending Sherlock's pleasure, kept brushing his prostate and triggering an additional little discharge every time. Sherlock responded to every fresh ejaculation with a blissful moan and muscle contractions that massaged John's cock even more within that twitching, hot passage. But it wasn't until Sherlock's legs hung limp and heavy against the ropes and he was reduced to nothing more than soft whimpers that John thrust in once more with a throaty groan and spent himself in Sherlock's overstimulated, satiated body.
Sherlock had been close to unburdening himself, confessing everything to John, telling him everything he'd wanted to that day... but then there was that barrier again... a barrier between them, and Sherlock didn't even know where it had come from so suddenly.
John had barely paused before Sherlock's eye flitted over to the wooden box.
Over the course of those days without John, he serviced his clientele in his accustomed manner, with his hands, mouth, and arse – the latter body part offered up only for the occasional beating – when it was required.

"Gregory..." Mycroft whispered, his voice raw.
John rolled his eyes to himself. What did Mike know about the joys of anal sex anyway … or about the lonely nights in the big house?
... can be dispensed with for the rest of our conversation."
John didn't know. He only knew that he'd never wanted so badly to get burned.
“I know,” John conceded glumly. “I just thought... it would get better on its own... After all, Jacques is...”
Mike nodded. What else could he do? The whole thing had seemed like a wild goose chase from the start. But it couldn't hurt to have a look around and see what was to be heard - and so he let Sherlock do what he wanted and stuck to his agreement not to tell John anything about it.
Moving slowly, as if drugged, Sherlock turned over and knelt, supporting himself with his hands on the mattress. He spread his legs a little, lowered his head, and held perfectly still. Only the sound of his breathing could be heard. John paused for a moment, listening to the faintly stuttering inhalations. It didn't take long before Sherlock raised his head again to glare at John over his shoulder, almost reproachfully.
John shook his head in horror. "No bloody way. Tomorrow - or the day after. Yes. If you still want to. I said it was something we needed to talk about. Did you forget to listen again?"

gratitude...
"Nice of you to finally show up again," Mike's unusually venomous voice sounded from the door.
Sherlock complied with the instructions, displaying every sign of eagerness. John watched him attentively, noting that Sherlock's pants sported a large damp spot and that the head of his half-mast erection was already gleaming.
It might have been frightening, but Sherlock felt the snap of the cold on his cheeks, and for the first time in his life, he felt truly free. He took a deep breath, filling his lungs with the fresh, cold air. Dark clouds hung over London. It smelled of snow. And car exhaust. It was all a bit much.

"Because he's always thought he was the centre of the universe," Mycroft remarked cynically. "I see that hasn't changed."
"Don't be ridiculous," Mycroft retorted brusquely, noting to his own great annoyance that it now really did look as if he were jealous.
Sherlock was going to solve that puzzle before he got on his knees and begged Mycroft for that footage. At least that would buy him a little time.
“Therefore it will still be play acting, as you so eloquently put it.”
"You're too good for this world," Mycroft said, taking a drag.
touch. The mere thought of what he did to me... It's enough to arouse me. It's horrendous! I could climb the walls. It's driving me mad and there's absolutely nothing I can do." Sherlock ruffled his hair in exasperation.
," Mike hissed. "You're going to do the right thing for once in your life! You're going to see to it that Sherlock goes to hospital, right now. And then you're going to take responsibility for what you've done. Do you hear me, John? I'm going home to my wife now, and don't you dare call me. You can find your own way out of this mess. Have I made myself clear enough?"
"Because you can't control yourself and are going to leak all over at the first thought of me?" he growled at him.
Sherlock tossed all his fears and reservations overboard, infused his gaze with all his emotions, all the love he was capable of, and looked directly at John. "Yes."
'. And just for that... I'll fuck you... but the prince's wand is staying in. You're staying tied up, and I'm not going to touch you."
"Mike, you don't understand," John said, negating any argument. "That's not just any bed. It's
"God... your skin... covered in welts," John rasped, his voice rough and halting.
"No," Sherlock protested, his voice soft but no less clear, and tightened his hold on John. "No, you're not going to do that."
John could never deny Sherlock anything. He just hoped he didn’t end up with a lapful of crying detective. “Okay,” he agreed. “We’ll try it and see what happens. But if you don’t like it, we’ll stop.”
Sherlock considered the words calmly and deliberately. "I wonder how you expect to achieve that," he finally remarked, his scepticism cutting.
Sherlock had no interest in such things and buried himself in invoices. Domestic problems... they couldn't possibly have mattered less to him. Fortunately, the numbers had a calming effect on him and distracted him from the nerve-wracking wait for Kitty's reply.
Never before … never before had John caressed Sherlock's penis with his tongue. Never! And he might never do it again. Should he miss the chance to see it? And if he did look, would he be able to control himself and continue holding the ropes? Yet wouldn't it be worth it? On the other hand... the threat of a week of chastity still hung over him, and he wouldn't put it past John at all to enact appropriate measures to make sure the punishment was carried out.
After John left, Sherlock stared at the closed door with a look of utter despondency.
. It was easier to come up with an explanation for that.
"Nothing," was John's simple answer. "I'm going to leave you alone... you don't need to be afraid of me... You don't need to move away, you don't need to change your name... I haven't been planning revenge on you over the past fourteen years, and I'm not about to start now."
"Anything else?" John returned lightly. "That would be more like a reward for you. No, my decision stands. No lip contact for the next 24 hours. Maybe you'll think twice next time whether the cigarette's
After a while, the worst thing was no longer the fact that John was violating him, but that his body was betraying him.
a whore."
“He did have a gun in his hand,” Naresh claimed, but he sounded oddly hesitant.
A strange combination indeed ... but a combination that John found both uncommonly fascinating and irresistible.
"Two things, before..." John began, and - sadist that he was - let his tongue flick across Sherlock's lips for a fraction of a second in a parody of a kiss. "First: no smoking. There are nicotine patches in the drawer of your nightstand. I've never been particularly interested in kissing someone who tastes like an ashtray, and I don't plan on starting now." His tongue danced once again tantalisingly over Sherlock's lips, even as Sherlock opened them with a soft moan. "Second: if you let this room deteriorate into a pigsty the way you did your rooms at Miss Adler's, then..."
Until now...
'), John made himself comfortable on his bed. He opened his trousers and pushed them down to his knees. His stiff penis was outlined clearly in his briefs. He was gratified to hear Sherlock's stuttering breaths and faint whimpers. He rubbed the damp material of his pants, going at a leisurely pace.
"Mike, it's fine. Truly. I don't know where John's gone - but I'm sure he'll be back soon... and when he returns, he needs to find me right where he left me."
"Maybe not all the way to my front door," Mycroft pointed out. "There's a side street nearby without any CCTV cameras."
"Then I really don't know what you're complaining about," John said in a teasing manner, pulling Sherlock closer for a kiss, which Sherlock was deeply grateful for. Sherlock's lips pressed against John's with an intensity that was nearly painful, and welcomed his tongue. John's kiss... John's lips... John's tongue... they all helped him... serving as a living gag... stopping him from saying those words that lurked in his throat, tormenting him.
"I think you know exactly when it was," Call-Me-Ella countered. "Possibly too exactly."
Sherlock, on the other hand, lay awake for quite some time. Still on a high from John's sperm, the bitter yet somehow sweet taste on his tongue - it reminded him of fresh oysters before they'd been dosed with lemon, Worcestershire sauce, or anything else. His senses were saturated with John's familiar, calming - yet still exciting - smell, still filled with John's sighs and moans, his touches and looks, and Sherlock understood at that moment that an exorbitant performance like tonight wouldn't be necessary again. Although it had been wonderful to give free rein to his desires - to his addiction - it had given him a buzz of another sort altogether. It was no longer necessary for him to drown in an ocean of semen. It was no longer necessary for him to forget himself. It was … simply no longer necessary. He didn't need it anymore. What he needed was... John.
Mike and John were sitting in the car again following their second appointment, being piloted cautiously through the thick, stop-and-go traffic by Bridges, when Mike's stomach growled loud enough to be heard.
With every step he took, John tried to see whether one of the figures might be Moriarty - or even Sherlock. But the thin, dim light that the candle gave off was insufficient for recognising faces. All three of them were wrapped in thick coats and jackets - just like John - which camouflaged their shapes, making it even harder to identify them - whether intentional or not.
"Fuck's sake, Mike!" John barked at him, laying two fingers against Sherlock's neck. "Quit with the nonsense. Make yourself useful instead and bring me a glass of water."
"And what
"Yes, that..." He started to speak, but his voice was raw and he had to clear his throat. "That sounds very... that would be wonder-- … Yes, that... I want that too." His throat became tight with emotion, and he found himself unable to utter a single syllable more. He saw relief appear on John's face, and a quiet, happy smile flickered across his lips. Sherlock felt as if he'd received a generous gift he didn't deserve, and didn't know how to react. He had no idea what to do with himself. He was embarrassed, and at the same time he wanted to break out in screams of joy. He wanted to kiss John and put his arms around him and never let go... he wanted to smother him in his embrace and throw himself at his feet and never get up...
Sherlock snuggled up to him, his legs stretched out across one of John's thighs while John's other leg supported Sherlock's back. John's arm draped itself around the pale, narrow shoulders.
"What took you so long?" he asked.
Sherlock took John's hand away from his throat and breathed a soft kiss onto the palm. He could feel John's shiver. Then he said quietly, "I'm fine." He held John's hand against his cheek, nuzzled into the touch, and exhaled a very contented sigh. His eyes fell shut.
-small… it was just smaller than the average. Definitely smaller than John’s.
Here are a few pictures:
John laughed cheerfully, but his eyes remained icy. "Trust me... I'd know. As sure as the Pope is Catholic."
"Hello, Mummy... it's me... Yes. I know. No, I... Of course, after the attack I do have more important things to do than call you. I simply thought it might interest you that I'm doing well... At the charity bazaar? I didn't know that... All right, I
The image that John had of Sherlock up to now still had some blank spots, however. John wanted to change that this evening. Tonight, he wanted to learn something new about Sherlock, colour in some of those blank spots. He wanted to know how Sherlock would react, how he would sound, if he experienced more pleasure and arousal than his body and his brain were able to process.
"Yes..." John agreed slowly, sending an assessing look in Greg's direction, where he was standing on the stairs snorting disagreeably. "It can be arranged. But this time I really am prepared to pay for what I've done."
? It was too much already! The rod moved again. Slid up only to be pushed back down right away. Sherlock gasped out loud. Too much? No... not nearly enough! He'd never felt so helpless - so much at someone's mercy - and yet he'd never enjoyed so much being a plaything to satisfy another man's lust. No... not just any man... he enjoyed being a plaything to satisfy
"It's not that I don't want to come with you!" Sherlock retorted. "It's that I don't want you to go! And Mike wouldn't have let me go anyway!"
Greg was just about to flick his cigarette butt away, but paused mid-motion. "Are you trying to say..." His voice sounded thick.
," John concluded.
"Is this your revenge for me making you wait just now?" he asked breathlessly.
A bitter smile flickered across John's still bowed face. Sherlock didn't believe him. John couldn't even blame him. Maybe that would change if he followed up his words with actions.
Glowworm und S. – who I was able to discuss story lines with, and who gave me helpful pointers for the plot and the motivations of the characters
John sucked on his upper lip so hard Sherlock could hear it. "Those aren't my eyes," he remarked without so much as a trace of humour or amusement.
"Man, no sense of humour," Franco said. "Okay - what do you say? I don't quite fancy standing here any longer freezing my gear off."
John clicked his tongue. "I'm afraid my good manners forbid me from answering that," he answered cheerfully and sat down in the same spot he'd taken the last time. He saw Mycroft glance toward the door and then check out the window. It was obvious that he expected John to have company with him... someone other than his chauffeur.
really didn't expect it."
At some point, John would try to understand everything that had happened. At some point, he'd try to understand why Sherlock had been prepared to sacrifice himself for him... to give up his life in order to ensure that John's enemies didn't have anything to hold over him anymore. It was a goddamned miracle that the two of them were still alive. John gave Sherlock one last look, but Sherlock's eyes were closed and his face was distorted with pain. Time was running short. Sherlock needed to get to a hospital, and urgently. Why had he never completed his medical studies? If he had, he'd be better able to help Sherlock now. It was with the greatest reluctance that John left Sherlock in the somewhat dubious care of Mycroft and Greg and ran back down to the street as fast as possible to get his car.
"Why not?" Sherlock replied with a shrug. "It's the only explanation I can think of why Mycroft should show someone else his highly personal, highly secret mobile phone... and he must have done so, as there's no other way the Inspector could have come across the picture of Moran. He must have seen it accidentally, since Mycroft would have had no reason to show it to him."
"Oh, don't worry," John answered with a cold chuckle. "It's going to hurt. And it's going to be a sufficient punishment." He hesitated a moment before asking, "Have you never actually been slapped before?"
The extra night was necessary, unfortunately, due to it being such a long drive back to London. Dave and Naresh would take turns at the wheel, but he didn't want to make either of them undertake such a strenuous drive at night. Moran, on the other hand, had left right after the meeting with his two companions. John shrugged his shoulders. Everyone did whatever they thought was best.
Then Sherlock heard clothing hitting the floor and a zip being opened. His buttocks were pulled roughly apart with cold hands. A fleeting swipe over his anus, and then...
John took in every detail of the tableau spread out before him.
"I'm here now," he replied after a moment.
"Bring Sherlock to his father," she said in a hushed tone.
A few minutes passed during which Mycroft stared silently into the flame of the candle he'd just lit. "How is Sherlock?"
John continued to hold out his handkerchief to him. “Here.”
With a calming hand, John caressed the body, gleaming with perspiration, that enveloped his erection so fantastically tight within its trembling muscles.
God, tears! If there was one thing that made John's libido flare up like bellows to a fire, it was tears. His limbic system and his lower abdomen found themselves instantly in agreement, and some primitive programme in his brain began to scream at him:
"Look in the mirror, Sherlock!" John rasped into his ear. "I want to see you... I want to see your face."
was so kind to make a
"I think he's good for you," Sherlock mused.
“Of course not!” John said heatedly.
"He already does," Irene explained obligingly. "It really wouldn't be a problem."
"So … no more kid gloves with the Russkies and the Chinks?" asked one of the men - who was not exactly known for his highbrow language.
he was gay on top of it!
Picset! After looking myself half to death, I finally decided to use Ralph Fiennes in the new movie "The Grand Hotel Budapest" as the model for Jacques. I would have rather used Jean Dujardin from "The Artist", but I could only find black-and-white pictures... If you have any other ideas - let me know. Best with a link!
"I'm not ringing Sherlock!" John shouted after his friend, dialling the number of Sherlock's mobile as soon as the door closed behind Mike. Before John had left, he'd tried to convince Sherlock to finally use the telephone John had bought him months ago, and to always keep it with him.
Mike stared dazedly into the distance, the phone still pressed to his ear. The dial tone sounded, and he wished with all his might that he could discount everything as some feverish dream. But maybe it really was better to heed Sherlock's advice (all right, it had been an order, but Mike refused to acknowledge that) and not tell John anything about Sherlock's suspicions.
"Gregory, that's hyperbole," Mycrof said calmly. "Unmitigated hyperbole, at that."
(John's talk of marriage proposals had given him some rather stupid ideas). Instead, he concentrated on the rest of the information included in John's statement.
"That depends who you ask... my mother would reply to that question negatively. And you? I've never seen you smoke before."
“I knew it!” Sherlock crowed, paying no heed to Naresh’s objection. “Albright wasn’t aiming at John, and that’s why neither of you judged Albright to be a threat.”
"Yes. You can."
He was forced down onto the bed and crudely fingered; his penis stiffened, and John sneered at him, saying, "Oh, now you like it?!" and Sherlock knew John didn't mean him.
Greg fell silent.
Just then, he gave John the impression of a noble, slightly overbred, nervous racing horse. One false move and he would kick and make a break for it. John didn't have much experience with horses, but he knew that Sherlock was going to have to rid himself of his nervousness if he wanted to have any fun with him tonight. In an attempt to calm him, John laid his left hand on Sherlock's knee.
John had to bite his tongue in order not to cry out. So tight - so hot... Sherlock didn't exercise such self-control. His shout rang through the whole room before fading to a blissful moan.
Sherlock raised his head to look at him as if in slow motion, and John fell silent. There it was again – the utter lack of fear he admired so in this young man. But why did it always come out at the least suitable moment? Why didn't the wanker just go along with it, even if he wasn't exactly jumping for joy?
"Do I want to know what..."
It was past midnight when the group dispersed from John's house and he climbed the stairs to the upper storey with steps that were heavy and slow. He felt as if he'd had all the energy sucked out of him, and all he could think of was a hot shower and a soft bed. He regretted it a little that he'd sent Sherlock to bed. Even though he wasn't in the mood for wild sex, he wouldn't have minded having a warm body close to him.
"I'm not as unscrupulous as you when it comes to calling in favours," John countered with a smile. "So, genius - what did I buy?"
John Watson folded his hands in his lap and pursed his lips for a moment before leaning back as well and saying, “I'd like to do you a favour.”

"Sherlock... have any of our conversations ever ended badly for you?" John asked gently.
"That's why the results didn't jibe with the exit polls!" John cried out in sudden understanding, before shouting at Mycroft, "I can't believe it!"
"I shouldn't have..." John murmured hesitantly. It sounded as if guilt and lust were trying to pull him in two different directions, and John didn't know which path to take. "That wasn't acceptable..."
"No... John... please... I'm going to come otherwise," Sherlock tried to explain in a strangled voice. "I don't want... I don't want to come... not yet... I want to feel it inside first... have it in me... as long as possible..."
"Irene... please, just leave it be." Sherlock's voice wavered between anger and helplessness.
"Why not?" John asked blankly.
"At least you stay in one place here of your own free will instead of continually running away," Mycroft added. "Although I do wonder how Mr Watson puts up with you day in and day out, given your unparalleled conduct."
Somewhat grudgingly, Sherlock rolled the dice and moved his figure forward around the board. But the longer the game went on, the less important it became until it ended up being nothing more than a background to their animated discussion. They started talking about music, and it wasn't long before the conversation turned to theatre and literature. They talked about books they'd read, books they'd had to read for school, and at some point John started talking about his family... his parents and grandparents... the dog he'd had as a child... Mike and Susan's wedding... the day he'd been hired by the mob...
The conflicting emotions seized hold of Sherlock, and he felt himself torn between the two extremes of
“He only went as far as I let him,” Sherlock corrected him calmly.
Mycroft's eyes flashed in amusement for a fraction of a second, giving him the appearance of a cat who had already caught the mouse but wanted to
With a swirl of his coat, he strode out of Scotland Yard's interrogation room, not giving so much as a second thought to the suspect, who had collapsed on the table behind him, the glowing cigarillo still wedged between his trembling fingers. The case was closed. The murderer apprehended. The mystery solved. Everything else was irrelevant.

Mycroft looked down at their hands. Not just to reassure himself that reality actually did align with what his sense of touch was telling him, but also to hide the self-satisfied expression that had come to his face following Greg's words. He hadn't been sure, following their first... moment of intimacy... what kind of dynamic would rule their
"I simply haven't been especially interested in this particular activity before." His tone of voice came across as both bored and derogatory.
In the meantime, John made himself comfortable in the second chair, looking as if he had all the time in the world.
But now...
In addition to the reasons given by John in the chapter, I chose Crieff as the town for the meeting because Benedict Cumberbatch plays a character named "Captain Martin Crieff" in the radio series "Cabin Pressure".
"I told you before, I'm sick," Sherlock answered stubbornly.
"Possibly," Sherlock conceded dryly. "Although it does also look rather elegant. Gives me a certain
Also made by me. This time featuring the more criminal side of the story.
Irene noted that he wasn't wearing anything under his dressing gown aside from a pair of pyjama trousers and a t-shirt that was turned the wrong way round. Anyone who knew Sherlock even the slightest bit would realise that meant he was in one of his Byronic moods again. Fantastic. As if the last time hadn't been bad enough!
"Because they're afraid. Not because they trust me," John said dully. "Fear... it's a shitty motivator."
'. That seemed rather odd to Mike. But he was much too tired to think about it any further. Who knew what went on in Sherlock's head? He probably called the Queen '
"A bit short-sighted, if you ask me," Irene pointed out, sounding unimpressed. "You never know..."
Irene shook her head and murmured something that sounded like “
Sherlock's bent legs were spread obscenely wide, his thighs were quivering, and his forehead and chest – which was rising and falling in rhythm with his strenuous breaths – were gleaming with perspiration. The lids over his fascinating, pale eyes had fallen shut quite some time ago, fluttering once in a while as gently as the wings of a captive butterfly.
"Everything all right?" John murmured softly when Sherlock didn't make any more sounds. Sherlock nodded, and John ghosted a kiss over his sweaty temple, whispering, "You're doing brilliantly... just a couple more..."
Sherlock kept a watchful eye on John's outburst.
"Aren't you going to thank me?" John asked severely.
His muscles contracted, and John groaned.
And for that reason, he had to be consistent and say
Sherlock had to hold back the unexpected - and completely unwanted - tears that came to his eyes. How did John do that? How did he manage, in such uninspired words - little more than an aside - to paint a picture of the future that tempted Sherlock with such vibrant colours? One of them needed to maintain a cool head in this matter, however. And if John wasn't going to take on that role, then it would have to be Sherlock.
John secretly hoped that no more seminal fluid would emerge from the tiny slit. He wasn't going to be able to keep this up much longer himself. Sherlock wasn't the only one who had been subjected to a sweet kind of torture over the past few hours. The work had really helped for a while, successfully distracting John from his lecherous thoughts... but now he'd reached his limit. He wanted to push deep inside that willing, compliant body... wanted to stretch that tight opening... wanted to brush over those sore, sensitive nerve endings with his hard cock...
While Mycroft was still standing half naked in his office with his phone in his hand, Greg had already put on his trousers and lit another cigarette, which he was smoking in short, frantic puffs. His expression was harsh and stand-offish.
Sherlock turned around, supporting himself on the bed with his elbow. He looked down at his own body and saw that his penis was still more than half-erect, despite the volume of ejaculate he'd secreted earlier. His forehead creased. It wasn't just his psyche that wanted more; his body was also apparently unsatisfied. Sherlock was confused. How was that possible? He'd come ... he'd ejaculated ... although ... it actually hadn't felt like he'd
"So what?" John answered. "I like opera. You?"
Sherlock returned his gaze and promptly answered, "You didn't say to." His voice was hoarse.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut, removing himself from John's immediate presence.
They allowed that this english version may stay online!!!! I don't have to delete it!!!!
"The bedroom," John said with a wolfish grin. "I'm going to make sure you think of me every single second of the next four days and three nights."
"I want to know whether John treats you well," Mike repeated, this time with more conviction.
There were still crowds of tourists milling around the entry hall and the spiral staircase that curled up through the centre of the building. Lestrade chose the lift. The man he'd come to speak with occupied one of the upper floors, and Lestrade didn't want to arrive late for his appointment. So he bypassed the stairs and the magnificent view they offered of the Tower Bridge, preferring to spend the brief lift ride wracking his brains for what seemed the hundredth time in the past few days over what the newly elected mayor could possibly want from him.
"Mr Watson, Mr Watson," Thomas whispered urgently, looking as if he'd just seen a ghost.
"Oh yes," Mycroft replied, as if that fact were a great trial for him. "Not only that, but he's the picture of good health."
"Yeah," John said. "And if you... I mean, if you'd like... I want to have a bigger bedroom... with a walk-in closet and an en suite bath and... only if you want it, of course..." He looked up at Sherlock, oddly hesitant and hopeful at the same time.
"Nothing... just that she hung out with some odd blokes back then. First she let that Powers do her, then she was always gadding about with that queer fellow, what's his name..." Patrick frowned and scratched his head.
"I was counting the peas on my plate," came the laconic reply. "What did you think?"
chair at
John laughed. Mycroft, Charlie, the bomber... they could all do without his attention for another half hour. There'd be time for all of that later. He started to take off his shirt.
John gaped at him again. Then he rubbed one hand over his face. "Sherlock!" It was a warning growl. "Sherlock... there are too many of us... all the borough heads in London will be there, as well as delegates from other cities. You can't have a video conference with that many people! That's why we're going to Crieff."
Greg smiled knowingly, albeit not entirely convinced. "Even if you don't consider it a hobby - you must meet up with your brother now and then."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Should I be?"
There was silence on the other end of the line, and Moran felt his palms becoming moist. He was really very devoted to Moriarty, but now and then... when he had one of his episodes, the boss made him uneasy. You never knew what he'd come up with next, and it was entirely possible that he would rid himself of his most loyal and valuable follower without batting an eye.
' and '
The client also treated Sherlock in a similar manner to John. He ordered him in a polite but firm way to undress, while he remained seated, fully clothed, in one of the armchairs. Sherlock dawdled a bit on purpose, to see if he could entice any more orders out of the client. He wasn't disappointed. The man didn't shout at him – something that many other men would have done in the same situation, and which bored Sherlock to death; rather, he simply repeated his demands with more weight behind his words.
"No..." Sherlock almost begged.
He took a deep, focused breath through his nose.
"And I mean, Moriarty could have figured it out. After all, Moran also threw himself on my knife rather than betray his boss. But he somehow never really grasped the concept. He probably thought that was just the natural order of things... he took it for granted that others would sacrifice themselves for him... Mind you, for
Btw... the rapid progress (of the German version) of this story was all due to the most understanding husband of all times, who left me completely alone and let me write all through my holidays until my fingertips were glowing.
After the first ten blows, Sherlock's skin had turned pink, whereby John made sure to spread his slaps as evenly as possible over the surface area at his disposal.
"I simply don't understand," Sherlock admitted grudgingly, making it clear that John's retreat wasn't just a heavy blow to his libido, but also to his intellect. "What was all of that about?" With a broad gesture, he indicated himself and the bed he was still lying on.
But he'd promised John not to peek and he meant to keep that promise. Eleanor's pink cheeks after she'd finally put the blue sheets John had ordered on the bed - once the furniture movers had left - didn't make things any better. Even Thomas's well-meant thumbs-up and his knowing grin when he followed Eleanor out of the bedroom, bearing broom and mop, only served to increase Sherlock's jittery impatience.
"Leave Miss Adler to me. Don't worry about it," John reassured Sherlock, who was clearly – and understandably – anxious about the stern brothel owner. He would probably face more than an upbraiding if he admitted to her that a client had left unsatisfied. At least John assumed so, based on previous experience. But Sherlock shouldn't have anything to fear from Miss Adler. John simply wanted to prolong and extend his pleasure a bit, and for that it would be necessary to... keep Sherlock on tenterhooks.
Afterwards, John licked Sherlock clean, caressing his exhausted partner with kisses and soft touches as he cleaned them both. John opened his arms for Sherlock who immediately cuddled into the offered embrace with a happy sigh.
"All right then... Jones?"
"You said yes!!"
“Thank you ever so much,” John replied sarcastically. “The good news is I'm going to have a blood test done too.”
"Doc Watson..." Glendale stuttered.
"What am I supposed to do now? Apologise to him?" John asked. When Sherlock didn't answer, he said half to himself, "Maybe it'd be better. Have you already been to the kitchen?" John asked abruptly. When Sherlock shook his head, he went on, "Fine, I'll take care of it. You go on up and run the bath. In my bathroom - the tub is bigger. I'll be right up."
"I said nothing happened... although..."
on the voicemail."
"No," he answered dully. "Unfortunately," he added with a sigh. "But I'm not giving up."
“I told you, Naresh,” Dave retorted, “Albright wasn’t aiming at the boss. He was looking at him but then his eyes flicked over at something else.”
"You of all people deign to give me advice on honesty and one's choice of profession?" Sherlock responded haughtily.
John was standing in front of the windows, as usual, dictating a letter to Sherlock - who was sitting at the desk - while Mike was going through account statements on the leather couch.
Sherlock recognised Mike's voice and called back, "John's not here, Mike."
"You'll come like this or not at all. Got it?" John repeated sternly.
Somehow this wasn't going the way he'd planned … or expected. He looked at his watch. There were only forty minutes left of the precious two hours Mike had carved out of his schedule. He went over to the unmade bed and sat down gingerly on the edge.
have been able to go through with it.
John shook his head. "Drugs," he said shortly. "Didn't end well for them."
John bared his teeth.
Sherlock took a deep breath, waited a moment, then blurted out the sentence he'd been repeating for the past two days almost like a mantra:
"What the..." Albright started to bluster, but fell silent as soon as he recognised John and his two bodyguards.
John Watson was on the way out.
Sherlock collapsed onto his knees, pulling Moriarty - who had been holding his arm - partway down with him. Sherlock tipped to one side, slipped down, and ended up motionless at the base of the wall, his face just a couple of finger breadths away from the murky, filthy water.
"Mabel, why are you preparing the strawberries now?" he asked, as if he already suspected the answer.
Sherlock stared at him in disbelief. "You can't be serious!" he blurted out.
It was his own decision, his own free will, and he tried to convince John, sensed how John shrank from the task, that he might refuse because he didn't understand... so Sherlock kept talking, explaining, tried to tell John everything in those few seconds that he needed to know. But it wasn't until Sherlock had the idea of using his safeword that John finally grasped how serious he was.
"Sensitive, isn't it? Is it better when I do it like this?"
Was John going to hit him there? Would he?
“It's one of the mysteries of the universe,” Sherlock replied dryly. “Oh yes – a tip for the future: passing out when I'm still tied up … not a good idea.”
"No," John decided with a heavy heart. "That would stick out too much too. And I don't know whether the bastard has some tracker installed in his phone either. Could be fatal."
"Good boy," John praised him, and felt even more tension leech out of the slender body in his arms. "That's right. Just like that... just lie there... I'll take care of everything..."
"I'll talk to her and explain everything that needs to be explained regarding your...
“Of course I do,” Sherlock said dismissively. “A word that leads to an immediate end of any activity as soon as it's spoken.”
He laid him cautiously onto the bed and removed the spreader bar. Then he released the clamps and the parachute from Sherlock's overstimulated body as carefully as he could. Sherlock still flinched at every touch, and when the blood flowed back into his abused body parts, he reacted as if he were experiencing pain once again. The truth was, it was more or less a neuromuscular reflex. His brain – still busy with the aftershocks of his intense orgasm – didn't register any of it.
Mycroft cleared his throat. "Quite a charming place you have here."
"All right," he finally said. "Up with you."
"Sex," Sherlock answered flat out.
let me walk right in there and hang myself."
"Does it concern me?"
"Sherlock," John said softly.
A shudder ran through Sherlock's body at the sound of those obscene words, and a shameless moan parted the sinful lips.
Naresh raised one eyebrow. “Say what you will, Dave, but he’s completely off the trolley.”
what you call
“You were... you wanted to...” John murmured in shock, staring at Sherlock for several seconds with his mouth hanging open. Then he barked out a short, indignant laugh. “You are really something else.” He shook his head before turning sombre again. “Why did you stay here? I mean, if she didn't have anything to hold over you, why are you still here? Why?”
He automatically started going through the names of the people in his mind who could reach him on this phone. Mike, his bodyguards, Mycroft Holmes... and before he could really think about what he was doing, he entered the number.
His arousal, held back for so long, exploded in an orgasm that seemed to last forever. Milky semen spurted again and again from his slowly deflating penis. John kept skilfully rubbing his prostate. His entire body trembled with a climax that seemed to go on forever.
"Yeah?"
John smiled, baring his teeth. "Then? Then I'll be paying him a little visit that he won't get over so fast. And after that... we'll see who's really in charge here in London!" He directed his icy gaze at each and every one of those present. "Anyone else have something to say?" he shouted in a hard, cutting voice.
