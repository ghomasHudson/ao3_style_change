Dean continued, “Do you remember that day in History class when we were passing notes? Mr. Singer wasn't there and that was why we were. We never woulda gotten away with it if he was there,” Dean chuckled. “I wonder whatever happened to that old coot…”
“It’s been a while now, but I can still remember everything,” Ms. Jones starts, “I was studying physical therapy at the time, before I decided to become a teacher. Dean and his friend Jo were studying the same thing, so we had classes together and shared textbooks to save some money. One night we were hanging out with Jo getting ready to watch a movie…”
“It was so cold,” Asa agreed readily, “But we got to see a bear and two foxes, so it was worth it.” He seemed to be finished, so Donna looked for the next student.
“Sorry about that, Dean. I hope she didn’t bother you. Bethany is here all the time. She seems to like me and have issues with sharing,” Castiel explains.
So loudly. Three people look up at him. One glares and pulls her scarf up to cover her nose and mouth like he’s contagious.
“What?” he asks defensively. “It's hot. Aren't you hot?” Cas just shrugs at him and gestures for Dean to come back over which he does without hesitation. He's practically draped over Cas his next few turns, they're not even keeping track of whose go it actually is anymore, just throwing the ball down the lane once the pins are all aligned again. If Cas was going to get any better, that was going to be if they'd stopped drinking about four beers ago. Dean's really not accomplishing anything by wrapping himself around Cas, but he just can't bring himself to stop now. And it might be because of that that things go down the way they do.
Dean turned to face Castiel on the couch. He lifted his arms to Cas’ shoulders and turned him as well so that they were facing each other. “Cas,” he said more firmly, “Please look at me.”
“Hey man,” Dean claps Castiel on his shoulder. “I was on the dorm waitlist since the semester started. I’ve spent the last month on a couch, so I’m just happy to have a bed of my own for a change. A bit of gossip isn’t enough to scare me off.”
The toast pops and Sam looks over his shoulder away from the stove for a moment and warns, “It’s hot,” before turning his attention back to scrambling the eggs.
“Hey Cas, there’s no reason to get upset,” Alex said soothingly. “It’s okay. You have a lot of emotions going on right now and you’re right. Maybe things will go back to the way they were before. Dean’s just new to the equation and you need to adjust.” Cas just grumbled under his breath. “But you might have to think about what to do if they don’t go back.”
"What I'm saying is that when it comes to love, happiness and pain go hand in hand. Until the moment the empty took me, I had always chosen the pain. Seeing Dean hook up with others hurt, seeing him pick Lisa over me was painful," Dean's head snapped up at that moment. He took Castiel's hand, offering a silent apology. "But, loving him is what kept me happy and you have to use that to keep going until the 'idiot' gets his senses back. And Sam, don't forget I'm not the only angel who died for love." Sam nodded. He was in a daze when we walked out of the room. He needed to think and he needed some fresh air. Silence hung over the room as Sam left the bunker.
"I cannot condone violence in this kingdom anymore. But, as queen, I do have many things to take care of and a couple may slip past my notice. So as they say, give him hell." Rowena gave a sly smile. Sam was baffled by the exchange and didn't realize when Gabriel had dragged him out of this room and outside his father's personal hell.
"You are right. That is actually my next priority. I wanted to make an angel heaven where they can go if they die. It's a place where they can be happy."
“Why are you telling me this now?” Billie was now completely forgotten. Yet Dean had never been so scared in his entire life.
"You heard our conversation last night." Castiel stated. There was no accusation in his voice. Jack nodded slightly as Dean turned off the stove. The couple let out a shaky breath. Dean hugged Jack again.
her that I wouldn't be seeing you anytime soon and she just laughed. But I do want to tell you, your father isn't there. Your mom is with a version of him that is meant for heaven
Dean jerked awake and Sam immediately dropped his book to get Dean some water. Dean took a sip and saw that his younger brother had been crying.
Cas gasps, not picking up on the joke. He raises both hands and takes Dean's hand from his shoulder to hold it. "Dean, I would never want to infringe on that. This is merely to supplement what you have planned. If you even want to share at all," he explains in complete earnestness.
So instead, he smiles at Sam before turning to Dean and taking his hand. Miracle nudges at his ankles looking for attention and he'll be sure to give her plenty soon.
“Okay, but when does it get good?” Charlie asks in frustration. “You said they got married, but you’re talking about them at ten years old.”
He takes a moment to consider it before answering. "Yes, please stay," he says simply. Dean's grin lights up the kitchen and Cas knows he could never send Dean away. Cas returns the wide smile and pulls on his apron. It's a white apron with pastel flowers embroidered along the bottom that Dean had bought him as a gift when his eyes lingered on the flowers. He picks up the bowl and spoon he had earlier and gets ready to start. Dean can't help himself.
“Okay, so you gotta take a few steps back,” Dean pulls Cas back by his shoulders a few paces behind the line, “that way you can have some more force behind the ball.” Cas just nods.
“So Frank, Joe, and their dad learn that the thieves are targeting the DeGraw collection and will rob six more museums so they stand guard at one of the museums, but when the thieves show up, they use sleeping gas and knock them out.”
And while this wasn't how he'd planned on this going, it seemed like this was how events wanted to play out and he wasn't ready to be upset on Christmas Day.
When the bell rang and the class ended, the students filed out to leave and it is Dean and Castiel that were first out of there.
“Cas,” Jo said firmly, “That’s just an excuse. If he really wanted to see you, he would see you. There’s always an opportunity. He could come over after work, spend the night at yours, get breakfast. Whatever. You could, too.” He frowned again. “Do you want to make that effort?”
Castiel laughed at him. “Yes, I'll just summarize the last seven or so years of my life for you. Well, we moved a few more times. Everywhere looks the same. High school is terrible everywhere you go. And now I study illustration. How's that?” he watched Dean while sipping his beer.
Dean’s alone in the dorm room right now and he’s pacing at the moment. “Something doesn’t smell right. The rumours are obviously making their way far, they’re still spreading--I keep hearing new ones. I think it was his last roommate.”
“Yeah, but are you sure sure? In this one movie, the guy was a pimp and he didn't even know it,” Dean excitedly starts to tell him. “He thought he was just helping a friend with protection for her dating service. Are you protecting a friend, Cas?”
Despite never decorating cupcakes before and certainly never touching frosting with anything other than his mouth, Dean had insisted that he wanted to learn. He had picked it up quickly under Cas’ watchful eye.
“I’m a wizard and I can teleport and cast spells,” Castiel showed her excitedly when she asked. The page he had flipped to showed a boy in a black cape with stars over it. He was holding a wand with a bright blue light coming from it. “And lightning. I can make lightning, too,” he added to explain the drawing.
“Awesome. Well, I will leave you to it then…” Dean hesitates. Should he kiss Cas? He starts to lean in. On the cheek? Oh the MOUTH? How does he usually do this again??
So Dean tries his best to put it out of his mind. It’s easier than he expected it to be since he is in school, after all. He goes to class and has homework to do and tests to study for. He's actually thinking very hard about an upcoming test and that is probably why he didn't notice the sock on the doorknob.
“It's for the library's Facebook page. I'm in charge of our social media and events. This photo is perfect for a last minute reminder.”
Dean opens the door to his new dorm room. He's already relieved because this room is missing the danky smell of pot and old socks. Sam pushes past him, heavy box in hand. “Get out of my way, Dean. You can't make me carry the heavy boxes, then block the door.”
Victor jogged over. “’Course! But are you going to be on my team or Losechester’s team? That’s the only real question here,” he said welcomingly, giving Casiel a light punch to the shoulder.
"We did, but this is a bit of a gift for everyone, if you choose to share," Cas tells him with a grin. "Do you want to know what it is now?"
If only the axle on the Impala hadn’t cracked last night. It had been dark and Dean had misjudged the size of the pothole. He hadn’t avoided it and the clicking that started after the bump made him check when he go home. Definitely cracked. He’d hopped online and made a few calls and replacement parts were on their way, but he’d have to brave the bus for the next few days until they arrived.
Dean’s mouth opened slightly in shock, but it slowly turned into a smile. “That’s too bad. I didn’t even have a chance to meet the guy,” he said mildly.
Sam thinks about it for a moment before he responds. “Well, I think we should get Charlie involved. I bet she could hack into your residence's computers and pull the files.” Dean kicks himself for not thinking of that. He's a big brother. He had to harass Sam first.
Castiel looks at him like he's ridiculous, and maybe he is a bit, but the mood lightens. “Are you confusing real life with a movie? Should I be concerned about this? You were concerned about my illegal activities, so I feel I should be concerned for your mental well being, in turn.”
Cas is nervous now that Sam is out of the room and Dean turns to him expectantly. "So what's the verdict, sweetheart? Do you want my help or should I hit the road?"
“Cas, man, that's just awesome. It's so awesome. I never woulda guessed something we did to pass the time could…inspire your career choice.”
“Come on over, Castiel,” Donna said, waving him over. “I was expecting you today. Everyone,” she spoke up to recapture everyone’s attention, “We have a new student joining us. His name is Castiel and he just moved here with his family. Why don’t you tell us a bit about yourself?”
When Ms. Hanscum returns to the class, she has Ms. Alex Jones in tow. Ms. Jones is a student teacher that’s been shadowing the cantankerous Mr. Devereaux with aspirations to teach history one day, and fortunately, he’s okay with Donna stealing Alex away. Grudgingly okay. Once Donna had told Alex what she was dragging her away for, Alex is thrilled. Dean and Cas are good friends of hers and she loves the opportunity to tell others of their love story.
“Well, apple is my favourite, but if you say that blueberry is your best, I’ll try that first.” Dean pours the last scoop of cocoa powder in the bowl.
“Awesome. Thanks,” Dean responds. Blue eyes bore into his. He takes a few seconds before he decides to continue. “Sorry again about yesterday. The bus just goes in all directions and all the people shove and--” Dean can feel himself rambling at the intense gaze directed at him and is grateful when he gets cut off.
“I do. I worked in a bakery while I was in high school, actually. I learned everything I know from there.”
Cas gives him a look and Dean shrugs. “Now we've got you off to a good start,” is all he says. “You have one more turn, then you can have some victory nachos.”
Movement in his peripheral vision catches his attention. Cas has just left the library. He scans the area and Dean can tell the exact moment Cas’ eyes land on him and the Impala because they light up and a smile fills his face. Dean can feel heat spread across his cheeks and soaks in the image in front of him: Cas smiling at him, beige trench coat open and fanning out behind him as he approaches the car. Dean’s mouth goes dry.
“I don’t have the same kind of history with you two, though,” he reasoned. “It feels like, like I’ve found my favourite childhood book and I’m rereading it after all this time, and it’s just as amazing as the first time.” He glanced between the two women and saw twin looks of surprise on their faces.
“What.” It’s not a question, just a statement from the growly, sleep-filled voice of his husband. Kiss. “Stop.” Kiss. “Stubble.” Kiss. “It’s sandpaper.” Kiss. “I’m soft.” Dean laughs and gives Cas’ shoulder one final kiss. He scootches higher up on the bed to be closer to Cas’ face.
“Dean, it’s not your turn,” Donna chided, “And you didn’t raise your hand either, so—” She stopped when she heard someone knocking on the door. “Oh, good morning!” she said warmly. At the door stood Principal Jody Mills and a young boy. “You must be Castiel.”
“Hey, Cole.” Dean took a deep breath and just went for it. “Listen man, I’m sorry, but this thing we have  isn’t working for me.”
“Well, are you sure you're not a pimp?” Dean can’t help but tease. Castiel gives him a Look. Hey, look, he's learning so much about Castiel already.
.” And maybe there is still a bit of alcohol in his system because he continues. “This might not be what you want to hear but you make me happy and my stomach flips when I'm around you, even though you talk when we watch movies, and I gotta listen to my gut. It's always right,” he finishes boldly with a wink, hiding his nerves at his impromptu confession.
Donna had overheard him talking to Victor and other friends in the schoolyard when they asked about Castiel in passing. They tried to stay in touch at the beginning. They tried letters, the occasional phone call, and an email here and there, but it just wasn’t the same.
“Finally!” Aaron cheers, cramming all his belongings into his bag. Everyone else follows suit and the class is a flurry of motion.
“She’s lovely. I’ve never been in a classic car before. You can see she is very well taken care of.” It is very apparent how much care Dean has put into his car. The leather on the seats is supple under Cas’ hand, the dash gleams, the engine purrs. She is definitely a beautiful car.
Dean watches Castiel sort everything out on his kitchen counter. He pulls out a kitchen scale and puts it in front of Dean. “Would you mind washing up and starting to scale out ingredients?”
They run out of the bowling alley as quickly as possible, coats and shoes in hand. They're a block away before they slow down.
“Naturally. And before you can ask, yes, she’s still named Impala,” Cas teased. Dean fist-pumped the air in excitement. “Maybe I should have rethought the names, but it didn’t feel right at the end of the day.”
“Is everything okay?” Dean asked, concern evident as he entered the living room and headed right to the couch.
“Also, you got really defensive really fast about Dean,” Jo pointed out. “Maybe you should think about that and what that might mean, too.”
blow over. Nothing Uriel has said can be proved because it's all so petty.” Cas sighs again. “I don't need you to take care of me. It will end when it ends.”
“Of course we will!” Castiel rolled his eyes. “We still go to the same school, on the same campus. We can make the time to meet.”
He grit his teeth and braced himself. “It was when we met again. It was getting you back in my life. And I’m going to make it count,” he added, almost to himself.
“My name is Castiel and…I like to read books and watch bees.” He turned back to look at Donna and she nodded to let him know that that was enough.
Dean just grumbles in agreement. A short while later, they hang up and Dean boots up his laptop. He thinks about what he's going to tell Charlie as he waits. He opens the chat service and begins to type.
“I didn't want to tell you right away that it was about our stories. I thought it might be weird that I was dwelling on it for so many years. But, we had so much fun coming up with the story. I’ve just been...refining it over the years,” he explained.
Cas leans over his shoulder and points. “Number three. I performed the blind bake before you got up. I was hoping to get the pie in the oven before you woke up."
She had put together the list of partners last night. With a slight change to her usual lesson plan, she was sure there would be a positive outcome for all of her students. They would get to read a book important to a classmate and she could guarantee Castiel would make a new friend.
“I'm fine, Jodes. Got me thinkin’ of love, is all. And I’m just ready for my vacation with you.” She pulls herself from her chair and closes the distance between herself and Jody. It's just a quick kiss, they are still at school after all—but it leaves her wanting more.
“You just looked concerned,” she looks genuinely worried that she might have distressed Charlie and the other students.
They chatted a little bit longer before Bart ended the call to go back to studying. Castiel felt a little guilty for the sigh of relief he exhaled when he put his phone down. He couldn’t pinpoint what had him on edge, so instead he opened his current sketchbook to a blank page and began a few warm-up sketches.
They were cuddling on the couch watching a nature documentary at Cas’ request. It was nice, but he couldn’t quite seem to get comfortable and Bart had already commented twice on how fidgety he was tonight. “So Dean broke up with his boyfriend, and I’ve felt bad. I like that I’m able to help him take his mind off it, but he seems to be okay,” Cas told Bart.
“Dean,” Cas chastised. Dean gives Cas a look and he knows that Cas can tell because he's watching the red stain his cheeks.
Alex awws at the scene while Jo rolled her eyes, “And he was making such a fuss about me inviting a stranger over.”
Dean did most of the talking, starting with a description of the scene. He pointed to the bottom of the diorama when he told the class about how the characters struggled in the vines until Hermione remembered they had to stay calm and still to be released, which is why she got free first.
His arm goes flying to grab the nearest pole, but instead collides with the man’s face. Dean feels his stomach drop.
“Right.” He pulls himself upright finally and pushes through the rest of the people holding his breath until his feet are firmly on the solid ground of the sidewalk. Dean exhales deeply. Well that was another disaster of a morning.
“Eleanor. Yes, I had, but Dean stopped by with coffee for me. It would have been rude to send him away.”
Last week while out for their usual grocery shop, he'd brought the subject up to Sam. Always ready to help a friend, Sam agreed and immediately pulled up a few possible recipes to choose from on his phone. On their trip home, Cas insisted on holding his bag of ingredients on his lap so he could read all the labels to try to understand why each ingredient was important.
Cas’ head bobs sleepily. Dean knows that he’d nearly pulled an all nighter last night, only crawling to bed around 4am, so he isn’t surprised to see Cas is drifting now. After a few minutes, Cas’ head lands on Dean’s shoulder and this time stays there for good. A few minutes later and Dean can hear his soft snores. He turns the volume down on that laptop and lets him sleep.
Charlie is positively bouncing in her seat. This just got about a million times more interesting. “So, who's your favorite couple out of everyone?”
He'd never be able to tell you exactly what sounds like, but Dean swears he can hear Sam roll his eyes over the phone. “Why are you so invested in this? The stories don't affect you. Unless are they starting to include you too?”
‘Hey’ he types out. ‘how’s it going’ He pauses to think. Is that okay? Ahh, it’s fine. Dean hits send and puts his phone down. He will not obsess over this. He will not check it every ten seconds. He will be good and do something else, anything else, and Castiel will reply eventually. This is fine.
They normally had history right now with Mr. Devereaux, who could make anything in the textbook a hundred times more interesting, but he was off sick today. You knew it must be really bad if he didn’t come in on a school day. It was a particularly slow class today.
“Ahhh, that would be why I don't remember seeing you in the class. I thought there might be a second class. I know I'd remember your face if you were in mine.”
“Of course, we are!” Dean said, just as surprised. “Just like Harry and Ron! You're Harry because you're the new kid and I'm Ron because I'm showing you around. And I have a brother.”
“Don’t call me dear,” Cas says into his pillow again. Dean’s guessing, anyway. He knows Cas hates it when Dean calls him dear, so Dean makes sure to do it when he needs a reaction.
“This university is the top in the state for physiotherapy,” Dean said, not looking up. “That should mean everything is in the curriculum for a reason. Now are you going to help?” Dean finally looked up at Cole. Cole's laptop was open, but Dean could see the screensaver. He wished he could be upset, but Dean was not that fond of presentations either; however, there was also no way he would let Cole get out of doing his share.
Over his own laughter he can hear Cas’. He doesn't think he's heard anything more lovely than that. And Dean never uses words like
The stranger goes to turn the page, hand going to his mouth to lick a finger, eyes taking a break and glancing at the people around him. His eyes land on Dean. Dean can feel his face redden and he swings his head up to look at the ceiling. Great. Now he’s been caught basically staring at this person. Right after his embarrassing thing yesterday. Could taking the bus be any more painful?
“We were best friends then,” Dean added, grin wide on his face. “How’ve you been, man?” he held out his hand and Castiel looked at it for a moment before pushing it aside and hugging him instead.
“I mean, I think he has been? Maybe as much as I have been?” Cas shrugged. “We used to see each other all the time. It’s was so easy then!” he lamented and put his head on Alex’s shoulder. She wrapped her arm around him in comfort.
“Orgies and a pimp. Why not? Anything else I should know about?” he asks eerily calmly for someone that was a breath away from a panic attack a moment ago. Dean is startled at the change in demeanor and simply shakes his head no.
“Well, I will get out of your way. I'm sure you two would like the time to settle Dean in. I have to get to the library anyway.” Castiel grabs a backpack and is out of there before Dean can even get out that it's no problem for him to stay.
“Well, I had to,” Dean defends. “I didn't like his attitude and I couldn't let him talk like that to someone I like.”
“I’d love to go to dinner on Saturday,” Cas paused with a questioning look on his face. “I assume that's what you were getting at.”
Dean pulls on his robe. "Don't give me that look," he tells her. "That's for slobbering in my ears." He turns to the door and catches a whiff of something delicious so he follows his nose to the kitchen, Miracle by his side.
"It's none of your business," Sam swoops in with the save. Dean scoffs, a reminder that Dean considers the kitchen to be his territory, and Cas releases the breath he didn't realize he was holding when Sam adds absentmindedly while plating everyone's breakfast, "Besides, he needs to do this now."
“I was sad for that year to end,” Ms. Hanscum tells the class. “Even thinking back on it now, the way their friendship flourished…It can still bring a smile to my face, twenty years later,” she sighs in recollection. “And it reminds me of why I became a teacher.”
Dean hates taking the bus. He doesn’t have to do it often. In fact, he could count on one hand the number of occasions he had needed to take the bus to get around since he had gotten his learner’s permit when he was sixteen. But this was an unexpected circumstance and he had to suck it up. He drops his change into the farebox and crams his way onto the full bus.
To the rest of the class, Dean might have seemed to not take it seriously (he had a hard time sitting in lecture halls for long periods of time), but Jo, Alex, and Cole knew exactly how important completing this program and getting his degree was. It had come out drunkenly one night that Dean's uncle Bobby had loaned the money to him to pay for his tuition, to be paid back TBD with no interest. Jo and Alex had never seen Dean cry, but they thought this occasion may have been the closest. Though now, they just felt mean when teasing Dean about his organization (they may have seen his colour-coded planner once) and how he liked handing in assignments ahead of time.
Sam finished up the breakfast dishes quickly and got out of Dodge right after. He's been around enough to know that Dean treats a full meal preparation like a battle plan and it's best not to be around if you're not needed.
Cas snaps a photo of the last cupcake. Dean gives him a confused look. Sure, it was a nice cupcake but…
“Now that we're done that unit, we're going to be starting the independent study project.” A loud groan erupted from the class. “You guys always complain, but that doesn't change things. I think you're going to like this one, though. I want everyone to choose their favorite books. You're going to be writing book reports.” A louder groan. “Really? You're choosing your favourite book.” Pause. “I guess you guys can see right through me, huh? There is more to it. You’re working in pairs and your partner has to read your favourite book.” She heard a shocked WHAT? from somewhere in the back of the room. She couldn’t help but roll her eyes a bit before she continued. “Reports will be in the same format as last time, but two pages instead of five because…you and your partner will be discussing your favourite scenes from both books and choosing one to turn into a diorama.” A few faces perked up at the new information. “See, I thought you’d like that a bit more. One last surprise, though…I’m choosing partners.” More groans, of course, that she ignored as she started reading names off her list.
“Well, Castiel looks like he’d pass out from whiskey vapours. I’m not too worried about him being a problem. Besides, if his last roommate left and he got to keep the room, that means Castiel put in the complaint.”
Castiel laughed. “You don't know me well enough. Last year I was so sick I almost wound up in the ER with pneumonia when I ignored my symptoms and continued going to classes.” He scooped up his belongings and shoved everything haphazardly into his backpack.
“You’re welcome.” Castiel flips Dean’s hand over, palm up and he adds one last thing. Dean sees the outline of a small blue heart. Castiel’s hand is so warm under his.
Dean and Castiel turn to the new voice. There is a stern looking woman in front of Castiel’s desk. “I thought you had taken your break already,” she says firmly while crossing her arms.
The two jump apart and look at who the voice came from. Standing just behind their table is a tall black man with a large smirk across his face. Dean has no idea who this guy is, but he can feel Cas tense up beside him.
It turns out that Castiel lives very near to Dean -- it would only take ten minutes to walk to each other’s home. “It’s wouldn’t be out of my way,” Dean insists, barely even blushing while he tries to not make it seem like a Big Deal. “And our schedules are almost the same.” They decide, mostly Dean, that Dean would pick up Cas to carpool.
“I thought we might go out on Saturday night,” Bart moaned. His tone changed quickly to something more flirtatious. “It’s been so long, Cassie. I miss you.”
Castiel uncaps the marker and reaches for Dean’s hand. He lets it go loose and follows the direction Castiel pulls it into. Ten digits are meticulously written onto the back of his hand.
“You got me there,” Jody grins. “But can we go now? The last hour of the day inched by and, not to jinx it, but I'm ahead on all my paperwork right now.”
It was Saturday night and Dean and Cas were in front of the TV, Dr. Sexy marathon in progress on channel 35. Castiel had never seen it before, which Dean thought was an absolute crime, so he'd been showing him the best episodes over the past few weeks. It was at a commercial when Dean broke their comfortable silence.
“You do?” And as much as Dean tries not to sound small by asking it, and he'd deny it forever if anyone asked, it's the smallest he's ever felt.
It was months before Dean seemed to get back to being normal again, though Donna was not sure what normal meant without Castiel anymore. He spent time with Victor and the boys on the soccer team but she never saw him drawing anymore and it upset her greatly. She couldn’t help but hope he was still working in private and hadn’t just stopped completely.
“I need some advice from you guys. Relationship advice,” he clarified. As much as he might enjoy spending time with Bart, something had been…off. He knew he could trust Jo to be upfront and Alex to be unbiased.
Jo reached behind herself without looking and pinched Dean on the thigh just enough to shock him. “You will be nice to him!” she reproached.
“Now that is a real shame there, Cas. You gotta at least tell me what kind of pie you were going to make.” Dean is almost bouncing in excitement at the mere thought of homemade pie, his mouth already watering.
Cas just looks annoyed at Dean's excitement. “Better would be getting it all the way to the end of the lane. You don't have to pat me on the back for the slightest improvement.”
“I told you you didn’t have to bring anything,” Jo laughed lightly. When was the last time Dean had ever heard her use that placating tone? He didn’t think he’d ever heard her use it before. She must be really concerned about scaring this guy off. Maybe he should play nice for the evening. Maybe.
Cas rolls his eyes at him and continues eating. “Cas, man, you should be watching my awesome form. Watch me get these two!” He waits for the black ball to return to take his turn quickly swooping in to grab it. It's his for today. He readies his arm and lets swing, aiming for the remaining pins. He really doesn't remember the last time he was bowling, but the motion is familiar all the same. Ball stretched back, walk into the throw, keep the ball low, and aim. He lets the ball fly and it speeds down the lane veering left. He shouldn't be this excited at the very beginning of the game, but he can't help it. He's got a fun game, great food, and Cas. What could make for a better night? The ball approaches the pins and knocks over the last two. Dean whoops again as they click and clack down the resetter. Cas smiles at the antics and Dean rushes over to join him. “You did see that, right? Off to a great start. Now we just gotta work on you.”
“We were in grade school together,” Castiel told her, eyes not leaving Dean. “My family had to move away one summer and we…lost touch.”
“They might just be growing pains. All relationships go through bumps,” she suggested. He nodded into her shoulder.
Dean bolts up, but doesn’t see anyone. He looks down. There’s a little girl sitting at his feet. She can’t be older than five. Her hair is in pigtails that are crooked.
Dean's improvement is apparent in the trays of cupcakes. The swirls of the first cupcakes are loose and a little lopsided, but the final one is a picture perfect cupcake.
Dean is able to hold his neck uncomfortably for all of thirty seconds. He strains for another ten before settling back to upright. His nose, of course, starts to tickle again immediately. Why does this have to happen? Dean tries to turn his head to the left and then the right, but the hood is just too big and Dean’s personal space is just too small.
“Oh, yes,” Dean grins and waggles his eyebrows while he pours the first glasses. “One for me and one for you. Start drinking.”
It's when Dean walks into the kitchen saying, "All that bacon better be for me!" that he realizes that his Christmas surprise might not be much of a surprise if Dean is already here. He thought for sure Dean would still be asleep after their late night together the night before.
“I said he had class until four. I didn't know it would end early.” Dean gives her a funny look. “How could I have known that?”
“Now for the dry ingredients,” Cas says, leaning on the counter in front of the mixer, going over the recipe.
Cas looks a little flustered at everything Dean has just said. “No, I'm not asexual, but I do appreciate the consideration.” Cas sits up on the bed, contemplation visible on his face. “I won't be bringing any girls back to our room though…”
Oh. Well, that’s shitty. Dean can feel his excitement going from one hundred to none, chin dropping to his chest and shoulders slumping. That’s okay. They can reschedule.
“Do you just want an excuse for me to keep coming back?” Dean shoots Castiel a small smirk. Castiel flushes and takes another bite of donut. Dean is pleased that he can make Castiel just as nervous as he was feeling.
“Big time. Sometimes it's the most exciting part of the day,” she pauses to think. “Well, except when someone brings in donuts or makes the fancy coffee.”
Cas laughs at Dean’s enthusiasm. “I was planning on making three pies, but that was before Charlie became sick. She was going to be bringing the bulk of the baked goods, but since she can’t do that, I had to revise the plan. Unfortunately, pies are a lot of work for too few pieces and I had to go for quantity.”
Castiel, thankfully, doesn’t seem to mind when Dean rambles. “You should get a library card!” he exclaims. “I could recommend new books for you whenever you come in.”
“Thank you for inviting me over,” came a deep, rumbly voice from behind him. “I didn’t know what to bring, so I bought several flavours of chips.”
It might have been about 40 degrees outside, but soon after the doors shut it felt almost tropical. He plucks nervously at his scarf and considers opening his coat just to be able to breathe again.
Looking back, Dean can't recall exactly how he thought it was a good idea to coach Cas in such a physical way; he's not typically a touchy feely kind of person. Alcohol is such a peculiar thing. Dean's arms feel heavier and looser than they usually are and Cas is just so warm. Is it hot in here? Dean feels hot. And if Cas is warm and Dean wants to keep touching him, well, he's gotta get less warm. He peels off his sweater and goes in for another swig of beer while he's at it. Cas is looking at him kind of strangely when he turns back to their lane.
Dean couldn't wait a moment longer for his plate of bacon (with his spinach omelette, god, okay he'll eat it) and they're back in the kitchen right after.
“I must’a left my phone at home today. Do you have a pen and paper and I can take it the good ole fashioned way?”
“Me too, man. So what about you? Will you start bringing ladies back now? Should we stick to the sock on the door handle? It's a classic for a reason.”
Cas’ eyebrows shoot almost to his hairline. Dean looks to him before really realizing what he’s just said. “...Because it’s such an uncommon name…” he carefully tacks on.
This took way too long and I'm sorry for that! On the other hand, I have most of the next chapter written, so it shouldn't be too long for the next update!
When Dean wakes up he’s alone. He stretches his arms and legs and back, getting as many cricks and cracks out as he can before flipping to face the other side of the bed. It’s cold. He’s tempted to burrow back into his blankets but he can hear the clanging in the kitchen so he knows he’s the last one awake.
“Well, you got the speed part down now,” Dean says encouragingly. “We can work on your aim for the rest of the game.”
They continue texting into the evening. Dean’s pizza arrives and he has his dinner. He’s got a movie on in the background that he only pays attention to when he’s not texting Castiel. His movie ends and he still hasn’t asked Castiel about going on their coffee date. He will do that in his next response.
“Well, I thought I did!” Cas looks frustrated and Dean sees him glancing at the ball sitting sadly in the gutter.
Castiel leaned further away from Bart on the couch. “Well, I don’t know, Bartholomew. What do you think?”
Bartholomew held up a book. He could see that they were reading the same book, though different editions. “Yes, vampires are mythological creatures…?” Cas trailed off, unsure of what this stranger was talking about.
“I guess I should get going. Don’t want to keep you from all the work you have.” Dean stands up and picks up his coffee cup. There is still a large amount of donuts left, but Dean decides to leave them all with Cas. He can share them or take them home.
"Okay, Dean, Jack, Cas. Spill. Why are you behaving like this?" Sam said. Jack and Castiel stayed silent, offering silent support to Dean.
"Okay, so completely changing the subject, Jack, I need to know this. Will the Empty ever take Cas again?" Dean asked.
"Worried about me!?" Dean suddenly yelled. "Oh, he was worried about me. Fan-fucking-tastic Cas. And what about how terrified I got when I saw The Empty take you? Do you have a fucking clue how I felt when you were gone? It was like I was dying everyday and was sent to hell everyday. You left! You fucking left without letting me say goodbye, without letting me say..." Dean trailed off.
"I haven't really thought about it but eventually, yeah. I would probably go visit him. See how his reform is going." Sam responded.
"Well, let's look at our criteria shall we? 1. Archangel (check). 2. Has to be accustomed to humanity (check). 3. Ends up being your soulmate but you want to be with someone else. That's completely fine by me. I am not a one man angel and we both can continue doing our own thing once this is done. (So checkity check check!)" Gabriel explained.
"No, Sam. Let him sleep." But Sam was already in the hallway. Gabe used angel radio to warn Cas that Sam was on his way to see Dean. He, then, adjusted himself onto the bed.
A moment of silence passed over them until Sam broke it. "How did you do it? How did you see Dean with all those girls? Just thinking about him with Rowena makes me want to march down to hell, myself."
“When I experience a moment of true happiness, the Empty would be summoned and it would take me forever.” Cas was saying all of this so naturally, like he was ordering food at a restaurant.
“Hello, you must be Castiel. I am Brandon, I will be taking care of you today.” he said with a friendly smile. Cas returned the polite gesture.
Dean stayed asleep for a couple hours, moving closer and closer to Castiel. Castiel just hold him while crying silently at the horrendous memories he saw when he put Dean back together.
"He fell asleep and I came back for a goodbye. I know I can't convince you to come back and you don't really need me here either. I need to go back." Castiel saw the grim look on Jack's face and misread it. "Maybe I should stay. We can wait a few more decades. We still have a lot of work in heaven and I..."
Instead of addressing his concern, Dean chooses to ignore it instead opting to introduce his new friend to movies and television shows--Dean can’t believe how little Cas has actually seen and decides it’s his goal in life to introduce all his favourites with him. They spend their evenings huddled together on Dean’s bed, laptop in front of them, thighs touching.
She turned to face Dean and watched his face as she lifted her bottle to her lips. His eyebrows furrowed, “I’ve told you, he’s not my boyfriend. And he’s busy. I’m not his keeper.”
“Hmm,” Alex said as she considered what Cas just said. “That sounds kind of, well, romantic, don’t you think?”
They moved things to the living room area and everyone settled down. Jo and Alex insisted on sitting on cushions on the floor so Dean and Castiel could sit together. (“New people don't get the floor. Dean gets a pass today.” “It's my apartment.” “That's why the pass is only good for today.”)
“I…I’m not sure. I like it when we spend time together. But I don’t…I don’t think I miss him when it’s been a long time since we last saw each other,” he told them.
“Please don't let the threat of Uriel upset you any longer,” Cas tried to placate Dean, voice soothing. “When I filed my complaint about him with the school, I told them everything. I just asked them to not record the details. I also told them that he threatened to start rumours about me. They know to take what they hear about me with a grain of salt, at the very least.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Are rumours ever about good things? And with the way you're acting, I know they're not.”
? Probably not that high, right? It may be rush hour, but who knows where he was going. Maybe he just had an appointment. Yeah. That’s it.
And immediately does a one eighty and goes to collect the phone again. The volume is off. Just because he’s not manning it every second doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to know when he gets a text.
“Oh, most definitely. We'll have people lining up for your cupcakes. I should take another photo with you in it.”
Now that he is more at ease with what he's working on, Dean allows himself the chance to look around Cas’ kitchen.
“Rumours?” Castiel looks skeptical. “Well, one of them is probably true. Unless they all are. What have you heard?”
Castiel knew he should probably feel a little guilty that he had been spending more time with Dean than with Bartholomew lately, but that wasn’t completely his fault. Bart's class schedule had not lined up that well with his and now that it was later in the semester, neither of them had that much free time with the constant assignments and tests.
out from the library. He'd caught the movie on TV a few years ago and had enjoyed it, so when he came across it on the shelf, he'd wanted to get the full experience. Sitting alone with his coffee and book, Bartholomew had approached him.
“Or, it could just mean it’s not working,” Jo said. “If neither of you are trying very hard to make the time to see each other, maybe neither of you are that into each other.” Cas could feel Alex nodding in agreement.
Six months ago, Castiel had been taking a break from school, his home, and most importantly, his annoying roommate. He'd taken a copy of
“It’s all body language. Bart might not be able to understand it, but even he could tell. You’ve been so different since you met Dean. It’s like someone turned on a light inside of you. You’re not the Castiel we knew before,” she explained.
Cas still gives him a funny look, but doesn't stop Dean when he also stands for Cas’ turn. Cas stands a few steps behind the line again, ball in hand and gets ready to launch. Dean observes Cas’ form.
The little girl pauses and looks at him contemplatively. “I guess that’s okay.” She sticks her hand out to shake. “I’m Bethy.”
Cas takes another sip of his coffee, watching Dean affectionately over the rim of the mug. “It is a day to celebrate. It’s sweet that you thought of this...If only everyone knew what a secret sap you are,” he laughs.
Cas now and sits down to finally eat some nachos. “I still don't know if I like this game. Why do I have to wear special shoes?”
The third day of Dean taking the bus was freezing--well below freezing, in fact. He had thrown on an extra sweater and wrapped his scarf around his neck and chin twice. His walk to his bus stop was at a brisk pace to warm himself up.
“Here, let me take a look,” Cas says gently. He takes Dean's hand and leads him to his own bed and they both take a seat. Cas fiddles with the heater, facing it to the both of them before he settles down to care for Dean. It really is nothing more than a slight scrape, but Dean can feel the ache in his joints from the force he used and Cas’ hands are just so warm and soft as he dabs the rubbing alcohol on it.
“Ugh, this is the worst!” Charlie exclaims. “I can't sit still anymore! Ms. Hanscum, please let us go! The ticking of the clock is driving me bananas! I just want break to start already!”
Cas lays out the plan of attack for the evening on their way to Cas’. They would bake four batches of cupcakes, two vanilla and two chocolate, then four batches of classic chocolate chip while the cupcakes cooled and then were frosted.
Dean finished off his beer and stood to get another one. He could at least admit to himself that he was excited to get into all the chips this stranger brought. He turned to peek at this new guy on his way to the kitchen and he felt his heart stop.
Dean continued to scroll on the website, looking at it in awe. “And it’s all because of our drawings as kids. I’m going to read everything you’ve got posted tonight. I’m excited to see what else you’ve changed.”
“Half the proceeds are going to the library's classes. We have craft classes, computer ones, tutoring, networking… Things like that. The other half with go to the elementary school around the corner. They need some extra funding for their art program.”
Victor took a big breath before starting. “Dean slept over and we watched all the Star Wars movies and ate popcorn and candy and we ate so much Dean almost puked but he still fell asleep first.”
They keep working with minimal mess now that Dean has learned his lesson. They agree to order in Chinese and only break when the did arrives. Conversation flows easily between them and Dean feels himself becoming increasingly more comfortable with Castiel. He's barely even blushing anymore. Dean finds Cas easy to speak with. They have similar points of view on many things despite their different upbringings -- Cas with a large family and even larger extended family in an extremely religious environment; Dean having just his brother, Sam, his mom and dad, a family friend here and there with no serious mentions of God other than to blaspheme.
“Hmm, maybe not,” Cole conceded. “So wanna hang out sometime soon? As just friends again?” he added after.
Dean was trying to change the topic, so Castiel let it happen, the awkward moment left behind. “I can’t just tell you the surprise twist.”
“‘Course you can stay,” Dean told him. “We gotta catch up.” He headed into the kitchen to grab two more beers. He gave one to Cas and sat back down on the couch. “Tell me everything.”
Dean had been hoping Cas would have said something more date-like, but working at a bake sale together could be fun too.
Castiel laughs loudly at Dean. He can’t help but notice the way Cas’ eyes crinkle when he smiles. “Well, we can’t all have easy to pronounce names like ‘Dean,’ now can we?”
“You're going to be tonight.” Dean raises his glass in salute to Cas and raises it to his lips, swigging down half in one shot. Cas salutes him back and much more demurely drinks his.
“Awesome,” Dean says. He looks up at Cas and grins. His once solid black shirt is now speckled with flour making it look like the night sky. It goes all the way down his front, trickling down his jeans. The majority of the flour is on the lower half of Cas’ face, all caught in his stubble, and his shoulders.
“It's short for relationship. So like, having two students that you think would be a cute couple and being excited if you find out they are dating,” Charlie explains, “I mean, I ship teachers, so you must ship us, too, right?”
. Dean is nervous. It’s different. He’s just been busy at work. Then he braved the bus home. There just hasn’t been time.
Dean starts talking about his baby. He can do that. He could talk about her all day. And the man is listening intently, asking questions where appropriate.
Dean lays back down on the bed. “I was thinking about our first kiss. I couldn’t even tell you how happy I was at the time, but I couldn’t help but wish it had happened earlier. Where would our lives be now if we’d been better at staying in touch when we were kids? Would we have chosen the same university together instead of it happening by chance? Would we have started dating earlier? Would we have broken up because we were too immature for that serious of a relationship so young? There were a lot of times when we first started dating that I wished we had been together earlier. Like we’d wasted so much time not being together.”
“Don't be ridiculous, it hasn't been that long.” Cas glanced at his calendar. “It's only been…a week and a half.” Okay, that might be a little bit too long. “I'm free tonight,” Castiel offered. “You could come over now.”
Once the doors shut on the bus, it lurches into motion making everyone sway and stumble. Dean tries to reposition his stance with his limited range of motion and clings onto the bar.
“Uh, just an issue with someone else. It was quite recent. I'm sure I'll settle down soon.” An issue? Like with another pimp? Dean's mind is racing with possibility. Damn Sammy for starting him down this path. How's he going to live with this guy when he had so many questions? He decides to just ask.
“They most certainly are,” Dean answers giddily. He opens the donut box with reverence. Dean carefully tears each donut in half while Castiel brings another chair over and places it beside his own computer chair.
“And together we fight dragons to save Prince Sam because they kidnapped him. That’s Dean’s little brother,” Castiel explained. He opened the book to another drawing of a boy being carried by a green dragon that looked very evil. There were several others in the background with the same sinister smile.
‘I can no longer do dinner tonight. The library is having a bake sale tomorrow and the person that called in sick yesterday was going to be making the majority of the desserts. I’m getting roped into baking things.’
"No, no, I promise it's the real thing. I mean, the fake thing. Here just look at the packaging." Dean said, pulling it out of the fridge. Sam gave him a skeptical look and Dean just said, "Fake meat man!"
"I know, Dean but it isn't me you should be saying this to. Jack still bears the guilt of killing her. He is the one who needs to know you forgive him." Castiel said.
"I know you care about Sam more than you let on. You can barely look at him right now. How will you see him with Eileen knowing he is bonded to you?"
The three of them sat down to have their brunch. Castiel even whipped up mimosas because he had seen girls drink it for brunch when he was Steve. Dean laughed as he took a sip.
"Come in," Jack said. Castiel opened the door to see Jack sitting on the bed, thinking. It was hard to believe that this was God and not the same lost Jack he had taken care of all this time. After arriving at heaven, Jack remade the bunker there. It was the only place he knew to be home and wanted that in heaven. Jack didn't need to eat or sleep, he just kept the bed and beer for the sentimental value.
Castiel opened his eyes. It took him a moment to register how close he was to Dean. As soon as he did, he pulled back.
"Need some help there?" Gabriel asked in an amused voice. Sam looked up to see Gabe against the doorway and Dean and Castiel suppressed a smile as they walked in. Sam straightened up immediately.
"Dean.” Cas said, unable to form any other words. That was alright, the two of them had said everything they needed to. Dean leaned down to give Cas a kiss. Castiel immediately melted into the kiss, giving everything he had back to Dean. He made an unspoken promise not to die like that again.
"Yeah, me too. This way, we get to save more people without constantly putting ourselves at risk." Sam agreed.
“Dean, you remind me of a hindi quote: doodh ka jala chaash bhi phook phook kar pita hai. It means that if a man is burned by hot milk, he will start to blow on even buttermilk to cool it down.”
"I... Well I had a dream that I died and instead of seeing Jack, I saw Bobby. He told me you are alive and I got in Baby to find you. I drove around and I prayed but you wouldn't come to me. I also saw Sammy grow old. He named his son after me, kept the Impala on Earth and got married to some chick I didn't know. He still missed me. He had this dumb haircut that looked like a party city wig for 7 year olds who want to dress up like the scientist from Back to the Future. No matter how old he got, he never got over me dying. I, on the other hand, just kept driving to see you. I finally got sick of it and parked my car on this bridge. Sammy appeared and I was glad to see him but then I realized 50 years had passed and I still didn't see you. I don't think anyone should feel that type of longing in heaven." Dean finished.
"Cas? Is he here? Please tell me where he is. I have to see him." Dean said, the urgency rising in his voice.
It was over. Death was, in the most literal sense, at their doorstep. Dean and Castiel had managed to buy more time by hiding in the dungeon but soon that would be over too. Amongst the fear and panic, Castiel started to feel a sense of peace. He was going to die with the man he loved. Suddenly it clicked for him. The angel of the lord, the angel of Thursday, Castiel was in love. He was in love with the man he had sworn to protect from the first moments of his existence. If Cas could find it in himself to be happy about this, he could save Dean. Maybe it wasn’t all over.
"Relax Cas! We, obviously, didn't go through with it. Jack was in these handcuffs and we were trapped in the basement. I used the angel blade on the handcuffs and Jack flew into the door opening it. We finally were able to talk her out of it." Dean was practically laughing at the fond memory.
An uncertain silence hung over them. Dean had forgiven Castiel but there was still some tension with Jack. It was still a sore subject.
"Dean, I meant that. I know you do not feel the same way which is why I let you have your space after Jack brought me back..."
This brought back the burning sensation in Sam's throat. He had almost forgotten about Eileen but was still distracted with the idea of Gabe's one night stand. Sam decided to talk to Castiel in the morning. He figured the angel would know a thing or two about dealing with jealousy when your partner is oblivious as can be.
“I think they would all look great on you, buddy.” Dean said. He couldn’t resist anymore so reached out to hold Cas’ wrist. Thankfully, Cas let out a soft sigh but didn’t comment. Dean felt his nerves going down. Dean kept his eyes on Cas as Cas carefully studied each hair cut.
"So? It's not like dad will say anything." Throughout the conversation, the couple leaned in closer and closer. Dean was resting his head on Castiel's chest, holding his waist tightly. Castiel had one of his hands around Dean's back, absentmindedly tracing the scars from memory over the flannel. Cas had tears running down his face but was still able to keep a steady voice.
"I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you." Dean repeated over and over again. He began sobbing into Cas' chest and held on to him as much as he could. Castiel gently wrapped his hands around Dean's waist, not exactly reciprocating the hug with enthusiasm.
"Thank you, Gabriel. I don't know what I can say. Just know that if you need to talk, you have a brother who does care about you and appreciates you."
"Thank Jack you're back, Cas. Dean has been moping around in your trench coat all day. Please talk to him. I genuinely don’t know how he would have survived the week. He's in the Dean Cave." Sam said.
Sorry for the dumb dirty dancing joke. I thought of it months ago and finally found a spot for it. :)
“Don’t apologize. Do you not remember what I said last night?” Dean took Cas’ hand in his own. Castiel shook his head in response.
"Can't do that either. Angels don't have feelings and emotions the way humans do. The reason you and Castiel do is because you spent a lot of time on Earth. To make them fully angels, I would have to take away their humanity, which is a huge part of their soul. They won't care about people enough to go on hunts. They will simply just be vessels for 2 angels. They will lose their essence." Jack said.
"No! Dean! I have to stop him before Dean gets hurt." Sam yelled, trying to break out of Gabriel's grasp. Gabe managed to pull Sam out. He shut the door behind them just in time for Sam to hear the loud slap.
"Hey, I don't know what that was about but I'm so sorry I made you feel so much pain. Everything with those other girls meant nothing. It was just a distraction so I didn't have to think about being a hunter or raising my brother by myself. And Lisa was my safe space. I loved her but you gotta know that you are it for me, Cas." Dean said.
"It's okay. We know you have done everything to make sure she is happier here than she was with us." Sam assured. With that, Sam and Dean left to find their mother. Jack sat down to focus and Gabriel and Castiel wandered off to the library.
"You stay here. For Dean. This isn't about your personal vendetta against your father. This is about helping your brother. So you stay here and ask what he needs. You help patch the wounds and replace the dressing. You comfort him like a little brother would. Don't forget was Cassie said. You are the reason he kept surviving. You pushed him to live. Keep doing that. And I am here for you. Whatever you need."
"Sam! It's alright. That wasn't Dean. That was just a bad memory." Gabriel explained as he put Sam into bed.
Castiel had fallen asleep as well. He didn't need to, but he felt strangely content and at peace. He woke up to find that he was actually well rested. He was spooning Dean who, for once in his life, had a peaceful look on his face. Castiel wanted to move but his arm was trapped under Dean's body. He just laid there, waiting for his human to wake up. He took this time to observe Dean. Castiel had already memorized each of Dean's freckles, eyelashes, nails and every other part of Dean's body when he gripped Dean tight and raised him from Perdition. He was the one that rebuilt Dean atom by atom.
"Then we heal ourselves. Isn't that the whole point of this hybrid thing anyway? And the dude’s killed you more times than anyone else," Sam joked.
“We were raised to be warriors, trained to fight without emotions. My father was the leader yet he was rarely present. My siblings and I had to take care of ourselves, grooming each other. Very rarely were we allowed in the outside world. Even when we were, it was under strict orders. If we messed around, we paid a price.”
Castiel, Dean and Jack felt exhausted after undergoing the ‘hybrid transformation’ as Dean called it. Jack knew that if he used up any more of his energy, he would not have enough power to keep the universe running. They came to the consensus that everyone would stay in heaven for the night and Sam and Gabriel would get their turn tomorrow. Jack headed to his room to lie down. He thought that sleep may help him restore his energy quicker. Dean and Castiel decided to have a beer before going to bed and went to the kitchen. This left Gabriel and Sam alone who decided to head down to the library.
"You know I have done a lot of bad things." Gabriel began. Castiel nodded in response. "Well, when I was in the empty, all I could think about was hurting Sam. Nothing else I did even popped into my mind. It was always the look of pain on his face when I killed Dean over and over again. That look still haunts me."
"No, I promise I am not leaving. However, as you know, I have healed every scar you have gotten on a hunt or by a supernatural being. There are scars I haven't healed because you have asked me not to. Even when I rebuilt your body, I knew you wanted to keep those scars. The first thing I rebuilt was your mind. I have witnessed every memory you have and I know didn't want me to heal your father's scars." Castiel felt Dean stiffen in his arms. He started running his fingers up and down Dean's arm, applying a bit of pressure to reassure him that Cas was still there.
“I want him safe, alive and with me. We’re done. I’ll start looking for places for us to live once Cas gets back on his feet.”
"No baby, I didn't but I still hurt you. Remember when I said that just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you SHOULD. Well, that applies here. I shouldn't have done those things, especially in front of your face."
"Oh yeah, totally. Most of the time he chooses to ignore it." Gabriel said. Sam turned bright red and made a mental note to NEVER say that again unless he was actually praying to Jack.
"Man, you are so whipped." Sam said. "You wouldn't have been caught dead with a mimosa three months ago."
"You might want to cancel the meeting. I think you will need to rest after this." Castiel advised. Sam silently thanked Castiel and Cas turned to give him a strange look. Even after all these years, the brothers kept forgetting how prayers worked.
"Well, it was much easier on you and Dean and Sam and Gabriel since you all knew each other and shared a bond." Jack had said.
"Dean you have nothing to apologize for. It's that jackass that needs to beg for forgiveness." Gabriel finally spoke up. He knew Sam was in no position to console Dean but he also knew that Sam would regret not being there to support his brother. Dean nodded and silence passed over them as Sam took his time to process the information.
“Yeah, buddy, I can see that.” The ball continues its snail pace, only making it halfway down the lane veering left before it sinks into the gutter and stops moving altogether. Dean finishes his nacho before he gets up. It’s not like the ball is going anywhere.
This is weird. He's clearly over thinking what just happened. Cas has a Guest over and Dean is giving them time, a few hours he'd said, alone. That's what roommates do. He has no reason to spend anymore time on this. He pulls a textbook from his bag, intending to use the time to study. If only he could get rid of the weight in his stomach that had just started. Must just be anxiety for the test.
It takes Dean a while, too long really, to wonder if the rumours might have been started by Cas’ past roommate. He finds himself thinking about the defiant look on his face when he told Dean he is gay and the fact that Cas was the one that got to keep the room. That might cause someone to feel bitter enough to start shit.
But there’s no time for this this morning. Dean flails out of the man’s lap with a hurried apology. He can hear the doors starting to shut.
Cas is still standing by the door. Now that Stephanie is gone, he looks a bit more rattled by what happened. “A drug addict now? Seems almost repetitive since we already heard the drug dealer gossip,” Cas says.
Everything might have been okay if Bart had just left it all alone. It was another two weeks before their schedules lined up and they were able to spend time together.
The holidays are the time for family, good food, sweets, and surprises after all. And tonight Dean and Cas have a surprise for all their friends and family: they’re officially retiring from hunting.
“I don't know what that means,” Cas says sadly. “And how do we get the ball out? Should we call an attendant maybe?”
Cas gives him a strange look that Dean can't quite decipher. “It's okay, Dean. You're right though. We never talked about this. Will you be bringing… people back regularly?”
Ms. Hanscum raises an eyebrow. “Why don't I believe that? I told you a story, I think it's only fair you tell me who you ship.”
Dean lays back on his couch, absentmindedly drumming his fingers against his phone. He’s only asking someone for a coffee. It’s not a marriage proposal. Why is this psyching him out so badly? Why is he thinking about
“Are you in the mythological creatures elective?” he clarified, tapping the cover. “We're reading this next.”
“A lot of the themes I work with now come from the stories we started creating when we were ten. I thought he'd like to see how they’ve changed over the years.” He was flipping through a sketchbook from a couple of years ago while he talked. “We used to pass drawings back and forth in class, taking turns adding bits here and there. We could spend whole classes just adding to our comics.”
Dean has been tense all day. Every time someone approached him he has jumped. He can not figure out for the life of him why he’s so nervous. They’re only getting coffee. It’s not like they’re getting
Charlie looks up to Ms. Hanscum, slight confusion apparent in her face, and Donna just smiles at her.
Dean thanks her and shoots her his usual dazzling grin. She looks momentarily stunned before she is able to smile back. He feels slightly comforted by the fact that he can shake someone up with just a smile. He can’t be nervous if he can still do that.
Dean starts weighing the ingredients, focusing while Castiel is pulling more things out of cupboards and muttering to himself. Dean puts the dry ingredients in one bowl, the wet in another, just like Cas taught him. He has everything scaled out for both batches of vanilla cupcakes when Cas is done rummaging.
His eyebrows rose in shock. So he hadn’t been imagining flirting the other day. Did he want to go on a date with Bartholomew? Castiel started mentally weighing the pros and cons, but cut himself off. He wasn’t sure when exactly his last date was and Bartholomew was nice enough.
“I--I gotta go. Be back later. Hours. It'll be hours. Bye.” Cas starts to say something else, but Dean slams the door, almost running to the common room. He somehow finds a seat without really paying attention and slides into the chair limply. He just needs a minute, a second even, to process this.
“And why?” Jo pressed. Instead of answering, Castiel flushed and ate more ice cream. Unfortunately for him, Jo has gotten to know him very well in the short time they’ve known each other. “It’s because of Dean, isn’t it?”
They sit quietly while sharing the treats, exchanging the occasional critique on the donuts. Dean is finally starting to feel at ease with what is happening.
“Wow, what happens next?” Castiel asked in rapt attention, chin resting on his fists as he leaned across his desk.
“Is that what you were wondering?” Cas turned thoughtful. “He’s probably still teaching. He loved it, even if he pretended to hate it. Maybe he finally decided to try writing his own textbook, seeing as he was always correcting the one we had to use.”
“Are you going to start calling me ‘Cas’ too? Only Bethany calls me that.” Castiel pauses and looks thoughtful. “I suppose that would be okay if you did too.”
Dean misses the Impala. It is only day one of public transit and Dean has already had enough. Usually, Dean likes having someone pressed up against him. But not like this. There are five strangers touching him from all different sides. He can feel someone breathing on his neck. Something is stabbing him in the kidney. The little girl in the seat in front of him is rhythmically kicking him in the shins. She could keep time like you would not believe. One day she would probably make an excellent drummer. The sock monkey hat gave her a free pass, in Dean’s opinion.
He had seriously considered taking a cab to work this morning. Dean had spent most of his shift the day before thinking about his embarrassing moment yesterday and he cringes again now just thinking about the moment of impact when his foot kicked the handsome man’s bag. But what are the odds of him being on the bus again at the
“Me neither…” Dean trails off. He doesn’t want to leave, of course. But he can’t decide how to actually do it. His hand idly goes to the back of his neck. “So listen I don't know how you feel about Mexican but I know this place… Saturdays they usually have live music if you like that sort of thing…”
Jo and Dean were sitting on the loveseat in front of the TV. Alex was in the kitchen making some popcorn, watching Dean and Jo bicker over the island counter that separated the two rooms. Tonight they were at Dean's apartment. He lived alone in a sparsely decorated one-bedroom apartment. He had never been one for knick-knacks, but his walls were covered in posters. Movies, bands, TV shows, he had them all. At his favourite comic book store, he was able to find extra large prints of his favourites. And who needed to paint when you could tack up a poster? He didn't have much in terms of furniture, but he had enough to fill the small space and seat the three of them comfortably when they marathoned movies, though one of them usually wound up on the floor with the pillows from his bed.
“Nonsense!” Dean exclaims jovially. He's not usually the sort to use words like nonsense, but hell. He's in a good mood, he's having fun, he feels more relaxed than he has in a while. “It’d never be wasting my time.”
“Dude, she's already more people than you talk to.” Dean grumbles under his breath. “As I was saying, Jess told me she's heard a couple things about Castiel. She's not sure if any are real though.”
Cas had been lining the cupcake tins while Dean was measuring and now is sitting at the counter, chin resting on his hands while he studies the recipes. Dean can't help but admire his look of concentration while he reads. Cas is worrying his bottom lip while tapping a finger against his cheek. He looks like he's in deep concentration and Dean doesn't want to interrupt, but he's eager to keep talking to Cas.
Cas scowled. “You’re smiling at my sad news?” Dean sputtered, but Cas laughed. “I’m kidding, I knew it wasn’t going to work with him. I just…wanted to let it run its course, I suppose.”
“Thank you for letting me know what's been said about me,” Castiel smiles grimly at him. “I can assure you that none of that is true. I know we've only just met, but that would all be highly out of character for me.” He pauses with a concerned expression on his face before continuing. “Do you still want to be my roommate?”
Castiel sighed and said, “Bart’s been complaining lately that I spend all my time with Dean, but I can’t see Bart. Our schedules are just out of sync, but we knew that going into this semester. With his part-time job, we see each other maybe every three weeks. It’s putting a strain on the relationship, but…I don’t know how to make it better other than, I don’t know, just waiting it out.”
The minutes trickle by and Dean is stuck in a hot mess of strangers touching him and sweat running down his back. He cannot wait for the Impala to be fixed. Dean returns to his thoughts and tries to only occasionally glance at the handsome man.
When she saw Dean that day in the halls, his side looked empty without Castiel there, and he didn’t seem to have the same spring in his step as he once had.
“I went to the fancy donut place. I got eggnog, London fog, hot chocolate, lemon shortbread, winter vanilla, and toast and butter.”
“What? Who?” he demanded. “I thought it was just us hanging out because we’ve all been so busy lately.”
“That makes sense,” Dean said gravely, “That Prince Dean is a real firecracker. Someone to keep him in line is a good idea.”
“What the…?” Uriel mumbles from the floor. It’s been a long time since Dean’s decked someone, let alone hard enough to knock them to the ground.
The commercial break ended at that moment and Cas just scoffed, “Okay, Miss Cleo. The show’s starting again. Time to be quiet,” and he settled further into the couch cushions. Dean leaned back and let Cas’ body heat warm him.
“Stop calling me Sammy. Someone else said they heard he was hosting orgies. He did seem a bit uptight for that though.”
giggle) that he decides to get up. He flings the blankets off himself, covering Miracle in the process. She burrows her way out and gives a shake before huffing almost exasperatedly at him.
“I don’t know what you want me to tell you, Bart. We’ve only been together for six months. I don’t know if I can handle you being this jealous of my friends.” Castiel told him, really proud of how steady he sounds.
