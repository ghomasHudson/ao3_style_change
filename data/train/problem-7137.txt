“Aw, you do listen to me. Yeah, that’s an ongoing project. I hit a snag and can’t figure out how to increase the energy capacity without making it the size of a dining room table. That wouldn’t be helpful to stick in a phone.”
(3:02)
(2:41) yeah
(5:39) dont underestimate me sweet cheeks
[ Call Ended - 11:03 PM ]
(9:40) no
(6:02)
“Ass. Did you really try that?”
(4:15) :0
Steve let out a soft laugh, reaching up to run his fingers through his blond hair and leaving it artfully tustled.
“... You’re not?”
X X X X X
(8:33)
(2:40)
(7:43)
“There are things that-”
(6:05) ;)
(2:26)
Steve’s cheeks went pink again, bright in the sunlight. “Oh,” he said. “Yeah. I- Tony, can I-?”
(10:32)
(12:49) it is going to be a secret
(2:53)

“Good. That’s an important one.”
(2:34)
(5:29)
(5:37)
(12:20) long day, babe
Tony ground his teeth together, his heart pounding. He hadn’t imagined his first real meeting with the captain to go like this. In his daydreams, there had been a lot less yelling.
(2:26)
(5:19)
(6:26) what? lol no
(9:56)
(8:45)
(2:36) my hands are shaking and i cant get them to stop
For a long moment, neither of them spoke. Then Tony said- “You know, the pictures you sent me really don’t do you justice.”
Sunday - AM
(3:19) shouldnt u b in the retirement home?
(2:08)
“I’m sorry-”
“No, no, I was just welding.”
(11:02) bc its true

(6:06)
, that smile should be illegal. “Yeah.”
(7:51)
“What? That’s more than I usually get.”
“Maybe they do. Ha. Alright. Thanks again, Cap.”
“I am sorry about this, it wasn’t supposed to be quite so, uh, dramatic.” He had his own paper cup in front of him, and was fiddling with it as he spoke, still gazing at Tony with frightening intensity. “I just, I didn’t know if you would come if you knew I would be here.”
(2:30)
(1:28) its not! a! big! deal!!!
(2:43)
(3:14)
“Whoever is requesting you knows a lot of swear words.”

“I know you are. I did talk about it with Bruce, earlier. He forced his way into my personal space and tried to therapize me, which-
(10:29)
(5:37) kind of fucked up a really important meeting this morning
“You know when you’re trying to get off the subway but the person in front of you is just a little too slow and the doors close on you?”
“I could take it all, you know, I’m very talented like that, nonexistent gag reflex, that’s me, I could take you all the way down- want you in my mouth-”
“Oh, shut up, asshole. Do you- I said
“Right. Yeah. Haha. I do that. It’s annoying, I know.”
Tuesday - AM
(5:36)
(10:52)

(2:47)
(9:28) a little too short notice, sorry nat
(2:21) pay attention to your job, steve
(8:39)
(6:29)
(6:56)
Steve laughed, a nice laugh, surprisingly gentle and full. “I’ll count myself lucky, then,” he said.
(11:06)
(7:52) i wasnt really upset
(8:37)
Tuesday - PM
(10:31)
(1:03)
(10:38)
(7:45) no, it’s fine, just
(5:43) and worst of all
(8:35)
(5:21) if i ever am, you have permission to kill me
(9:33) are you alright?
(10:12) it’s not burnt toast, but it’ll do!
However, one morning after he was returning from his daily jog, he ran into one of Tony’s bots. Literally.
“I know, I am a genius. So what is the emergency? We are suiting up and ready to go, just give us the coordinates!” M’baku boomed from across the line.
Steve remembers the day he first had one of Tony’s milkshakes. He had been fresh out of the ice then, still trying to get his legs in this strange century he had woke up in.
“Sex what? What does being a beta have to do with anything?” Steve was stunned that after all his veiled threats, these grinning idiots hadn’t gotten the message that he wanted to be alone with his intended. How dare they talk about their sex lives when they were actively blocking his attempt at a sex life.
“You know, I thought Black Panther was supposed to get married to Storm,” Deadpool waltzed in the room wearing an inflatable flamingo pool toy, “At least that's what the comic books say. But since we are in an AU, I guess that works.”
“Whelp me and Cap have a date, I actually have to teach him something completely different and hopefully more…stimulating. You will have to come back another time.” Tony dismissed the actor, walking past him and motioning for Steve to follow.
Time had stopped being meaningful after the serum, however for the first time in his life he felt lost, floating without direction. Steve was a soldier and had studied war even before the serum.
“Did Tony touch your clothes in any way? I told you not to accept physical contact from him under any circumstances,” Steve was growing tired of repeating the ground rules to the Team. It’s like they didn’t even listen to him these days.
Panic began to batter the inside of his ribcage and Steve frantically dug out his emergency phone and quickly dialed the distress signal.
“It’s just you and me dear. Besides no one would think you are being bad, you are never bad Tony”
The captain willed himself to keep his composure as Tony’s submission threatened to unravel him. It seemed to come so natural to the brunette that Steve had to keep reminding himself that this was just a subdrop. Tony wasn’t his. At least not yet.
“Ok ok, but how do you walk your ass anywhere? Isn’t it a given that when you walk your ass comes along for the ride?” Steve asked. He was only met with a dial tone. Huh, Bucky must be busy to hang up so quickly. Steve decided to call back tomorrow when he has more free time.
That is exactly what he told Tony too.
‘Wow he’s homeless and has memory issues, that’s awful’ Steve thought with a wince. Steve hoped he got the help he needed. Tony burst into laughter, startling Steve out of his thoughts.
“Of pleasure, then,” Steve said simply and let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. Tony was still paying attention to him and his friends hadn't ruined everything with their presence.
“Thanks for offering to teach me, I really appreciate it,” Steve said softly trying to express his sincerity. Every moment with his omega felt like a gift and he truly was grateful.
Steve pushed aside his misgivings as a renewed sense of determination filled his core. Tony liked the idea that poor Steve Rogers needed Tony to teach him about the modern world.
“Sorry about your situation. Here is something to hold you over until you can get back on your feet, Good luck with everything!” Steve patted Mr. Brad on his shoulder and ran after Tony. His omega was so fast, if he blinked he would lose track of him.
“Well you are now Captain, I just hope you know what you are getting yourself into. If you need someone to practice on I can help, Nat doesn’t have to know” Clint winked before quickly leaping out of reach of Natasha’s hands and dashing to the elevator. Natasha raised an eyebrow at her fleeing sub before walking over to kneel in front of Tony.
“Oh no! Let me take a look- Jarvis is anything broken?” Tony looked up at Steve with concern and carefully examined his arm for damage. Steve fought a smile.
“Ah-ah, look at this one-What are you doing here, Death Pool? Don’t you have your own movie to be in? Foolishness,” M’baku shook his head as he placed the now empty lasagna tray into the sink.
Steve was on fire and he never wanted to be put out. Tony pulled away abruptly, which made Steve panic. Did Steve say that out loud? Steve glanced up at his teammates who had taken up residence on the couch behind them, only to be met with kissing signs and Bruce chanting ‘Kiss the girl’. Whatever that meant.
“Only my faith in humanity sir,” Jarvis responded dryly.
“Are you done?” A loud baritone voice startled Steve out of his thoughts.
So Steve ignored his teammates and continued to wash dishes to ignore the gravitational pull he felt towards his omega. Steve knew he had to be strategic in capturing his prize, and he could exercise patience. Barely.
“You missed the meeting today. Everyone was concerned. So, I thought I would come by and make sure you are ok. Plus your lasagna is too good-oh! Praise be to Hanuman!” M’baku brought the whole pan of lasagna out of the fridge and placed it in the microwave.
“Can you stand sweetheart? We can either go to your floor or mine” Tony hesitated before sliding down back to the floor and sitting at Steve’s feet with his head bowed.
Tony’s words hit Steve in the chest and the light finally came on. That is it! Tony thought Steve was a clueless alpha, not a captain who spent the entire war with filthy knotheads. Steve could use this to his advantage. The captain was suddenly filled with a rush of determination.
“Your jokes are worse than Sam’s,” Steve retorted as he made his escape from the kitchen. Steve had had enough excitement for one day.
“Jarvis mentioned Tony had an episode last night, what did he mean by that?” Bruce interrupted Clint.
“Master…”Tony looked up at the Blonde dom smiling at the praise. Steve couldn’t help but feel warm affection blooming in his chest.
“Sex education, Steve come on,” Tony chuckled, leaning over to Steve, elbowing him playfully and completely shutting Steve’s brain down. Steve almost fell over.
“And uh why don't YOU go away, Bruce?” Steve glared at the grinning scientist. Seeing the concern in his omega’s soft gaze he quickly coughed to cover his annoyance.
(3:05) youd like it
Thursday - AM
(2:32)
“You probably need to get back to the gym, yeah?” Tony slipped his phone out of his pocket and checked it, mostly for show, because of course he had no new messages. No important ones, anyways. “Listen, I really appreciate you not taking this story anywhere. If there’s anything I or Stark Industries can do to support the business, let me know. Tell Natasha, she’ll get the message to me.”

(1:14)
“Reminds me of a young me. Hey, Cap. Thanks, for, uh, for telling me this. Why did you tell me this? I mean, now.”

Saturday - AM
“Oh.”
(3:17)
, before he slowly turned his head to look at the man seated at the table. He was so caught up in the blue of his eyes that he hardly registered it when Natasha slipped past him with a murmured, “Bye, Tony, Captain.”
(9:50)
(10:34) :(
“Right. It’s not- I’m not mad, or anything. That’s fine. It’s just, you have your privacy, and I have mine. For right now. Not forever, but-”
(8:32) bruce there is no way he’d want to date me if he knew who i was lmao

(10:23)
(10:41) fine
(10:57)
(10:33)
He was rewarded with bright spots of red on Steve’s cheeks, spreading outward until his face and a good portion of his neck were flushed pink.
Wednesday - AM
“Aw. Okay, you’re forgiven.”
(5:21)
(7:37) let me judge that for myself
“No,” Tony said.
(12:40)
(2:15) im sorry, are you a lunatic? have i been communicating with an absolute lunatic for a week?
(7:36) well, you will definitely have to send me an example of your work sometime
(7:50) yep
(6:29)
“I’ve been walking in circles for the last five minutes and also I think I’m going to throw up.”

“I am breathing!”
“Oh. Heh, I didn’t expect- sorry, you have a nice voice.”
(6:01)

(5:58)
(3:07) i can type normally again so thats a plus
{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}
“Smell you later guys!” Tony said, shooting fingers-guns as he disappeared around the corner.
“Sweetheart how are you doing? Are you feeling ok” Steve lifted Tony’s head from his lap to look at him. Tony met his eyes before quickly gazing back down to the floor a light blush coloring his cheeks.
”Oh no, Dum-E! Are you ok, buddy?” Steve rushed to the robots aid, picking it up from the floor.
“Steve” Tony responded immediately, causing dom’s thoughts to scatter.
“Okay. Cool. I’ll… go to my room now.”
(8:31)
Sunday - AM
(1:15) i think i could be
(3:15) arent you worried about who i am?
(8:43)
(5:31)
(6:52)
(7:18)
(5:29)
(5:57)
(2:16)
(10:51)
(5:23) they’ll be honeymooning for a looooong time
(8:35)
(8:16)
(6:53)
For a long moment they just looked at each other, smiling from across the table. Tony was still having trouble matching this perfect image of a man in front of him with his mental image of Cap. He had assumed that the guy would be attractive, sure, but he had never expected
(6:36) oh god
(1:47) Lay off.
(9:11)
(2:55)
(1:27)
(11:07)
(11:02)
(1:25) sure
(5:44) “why are you rubbing velcro together?” THAT IS THE SOUND OF ME BUTTERING MY TOAST GO BACK TO UR HAND HOLDING
(10:46)
(5:25) so what if i am? i never get honeymoon phases, my relationships always jump straight into that painful ‘we know each other way too well and now we’re miserable’ stage
(2:43) cmon bruce we were talking about good news remember!!
(2:36)
“Ha. So.”
(10:31)
(10:03) oh my god
(11:17)
(12:31) im sure u did. wow
(5:33)
(4:30)
“...”
(6:00)
“No, I heard you the first time, I was just trying to process it. Um. Okay. So, family man. You don’t, uh-”
(6:14)
“And it’s your son. You’re telling me now. I get it Cap, really.”
(2:34) i assure u its not on google
(9:24) oh my god i should have stayed
(2:10) sorry im a little tired
(5:28) ok meal obtained, im gonna try and join them
(2:43) you dont have to announce that every time youre done texting me you know

(2:21)
(10:33)
(12:50) not pepper or rhodey
(6:17) fun
(12:20) i had like twelve meetings and they were all super boring, i needed the energy
(6:20) u low on phone data or something? bc just fyi msg and data rates may apply
(3:25)
(10:36)
(5:17)
(9:44) for example: every time you talk about work, all i can think about is how flushed and sweaty you probably get during your workouts
Steve shrugged. “I know we had kind of a weird start,” he said. “But now that I have the chance, I’d like to do this properly. Dinner’s a good place to start, I think.”
(5:37)
(6:15) before you answer that, keep in mind that i’m a brunette
(10:57) push ups?
(11:17)
(8:22)
(10:15)
(12:43) so my whole espresso story feels wholly inadequate now
(6:06)
Texting Styles:

Saturday - AM
(3:22) :)
(6:00)
(1:06)
(5:56) scratch that, not possible, but he’d definitely be somewhere close
“Just you,” Tony repeated. He took a long, steadying breath, feeling the ever-present tension he’s been carrying with him since Sunday dissipate. “Well. That’s good, then.”
(5:34)
(5:20)
(2:19) cool. thanks, pep
Stacey’s was a twenty minute walk from the tower, and Tony decided to tackle the commute on foot. He hadn’t gone outside in the past few days, and it was nice to stretch his legs a little bit. Besides, the walk gave him time to think, time to shove all of his emotions aside into a neat little box that he would reopen at a different time over a large glass of whiskey. That was a test of his already-compromised sobriety he would be reserving for later. Now, he had to convince Natasha that he was okay, so that she would report back positively to Bruce and they would all
(See the end of the chapter for
(2:12) wtf
“Uh,” the man said after a long moment, and then coughed. “Would- would you sit?”
(5:23)
(7:44)
(5:32)
“What? No, Captain, of course not, it’s ridiculous that you would even accuse me of something like that. You, uh- you think I’m cute?”
Tuesday - PM
(6:26) don’t worry there is zero homophobia here
(5:48)
(6:44)
“Oh,” Tony said. It felt as though the world was flipping under his feet. “Right, your client. No worries. Uh- I would offer you a ride, but I kind of walked here.”
(9:34)
(7:46) can we talk about this later?
(5:38)
(2:26)
(10:58)
(1:47) Actually, it isn’t.
“I- ugh! You’re not being fair. Okay, I should probably get going, I was working on something earlier and I left it alone and I’m realizing now that it might be a little bit on fire at this point.”
“And you’re not a fucking- a fucking pariah, Tony, so quit acting like it!”
“Hm. Okay, well if you’re making me have a bed-time, I need to get going so I can finish up a few things. I’m meeting with my business partner tomorrow and if I don’t have something to show her she might murder me.”
(10:56)
“And don’t forget it. I’m- jesus christ!”
(10:34) …
(5:19)
(2:21) was it some kind of test?
(9:06) bruce
(8:19) OH SHIT
(9:14)
(1:32) thanks. really
(9:26)
(8:11) for business. i was gonna stay the night, but the hotel’s kinda shitty so i might just fly back
(12:11) you know when you’re not being a dick you are stubbornly nice
(2:41) i think
(10:52)
Tony clasped his hands under the table, trying to hide the fact that they were shaking. He could feel something warm blossoming in his chest, warm and unfamiliar. It felt a little bit like hope.
(12:58) not that you need to or should or even want to, i know you dont even know me and i dont know you so this is kind of stupid actually but if you ever need someone to talk to that wont judge you i can do that
Wednesday - PM
(5:52)
(2:38) w o w
Tony stood there, hands still in his pockets, frozen. Several seconds passed before Tony felt Steve pulling away, and Tony’s hands darted out, quick as a whip, and he wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist.
(5:26)
(2:40)
(10:34) you aren’t jolene
(9:30) idk
(10:30) its super boring
“Oh, I’m just swell, oh captain my captain.”
(5:56) he’s a super smart guy. i mean, i know im technically the genius, but i dont think hes been officially tested so maybe his iq is a little bit higher than mine
“It sounds like subdrop. We haven’t really seen Tony submit to…well anyone. We don’t know the last time he was with a Dom.” Natasha stated.

Hope this fixed some of the angst I caused last time :) This was such a fun chapter to write, so I hope you enjoyed it! I'm debating on whether I want to stick with Tony's perspective or play along with mixing in Steve's as well, because I love writing from Tony's POV but I would love to try my hand at Steve's. Thoughts?
(2:51)
“Slowly. Close your eyes, pretend it’s me. I would be gentle, Captain. My hand on your cock, nice and slow, steady.”
(10:35)
(9:06)
(6:02)
(10:34) ur rlly mean u know that
(5:16)
Now it was Tony’s turn to feel his cheeks heat up. He glared at Steve, who just grinned back.
“Yea Hollywood, am I right?” Steve tried to play along, still completely lost.
So when he demanded that his teammates hand over all of Tony’s things, he didn’t understand why they were making a big deal out of it.
Tony shifted nervously under the dom’s gaze and remained silent. Steve swallowed his apprehension and slowly rubbed the back of Tony’s hands with his thumbs. He felt Tony’s pulse quicken beneath his touch and couldn’t help but marvel at how responsive the brunette was. Steve would be lying if he said he never dreamed of Tony lying submissive at his feet or wearing his collar. He could only hope this is what Tony really wanted as well.
“Oh no Tony you are fine, you didn’t do anything wrong sweetheart. I was just very…surprised that’s all. Can…Can you sit back up for me please” Steve tried to hide the trembling in his voice as he shot Natasha a pleading look. Tony stiffened when Steve called his name but slowly rose back to his sitting position. Tony then leaned his head on Steve’s lap and sighed.
Being raised an Alpha meant being taught control, well at least in Steve’s time. After being turned into a weapon of war, control was sewn into every fiber of his being. Precision was his specialty, and control came natural to him on the battlefield. But Tony was the sole source of his undoing, unmaking years of carefully learned discipline and restraint.
“I will go where ever master wants me to” Tony answered smiling shyly. Steve couldn’t help the sound of his sudden intake of breath at Tony’s position.
“Steve, you are a good man. Go after Tony and remember your training. Remember-who-you-are!” M’baku clapped him on the back, almost bowling Steve over in the process.
Which is why Tony’s odd behavior did not alarm any of his fellow members initially. Tony dragged his feet across the kitchen floor, eyes bleary from sleep. However instead of heading straight towards the coffee machine, he promptly walked up to Captain America and sat down at his feet.
To another man!
“Well,
“Bruce…Nat…I think I broke Tony” Steve whispered as he ran his hands through Tony’s hair trying to calm the distressed sub.
Steve had recently joined ‘Piner’s Anonymous’, where people pining after someone from afar could find comfort. M’baku led the group and always gave great advice.
After hours or days, Tony couldn’t begin to count, the elevator door opened to reveal Steve’s floor. The Dom slowly released Tony from his grasp before standing to walk out of the elevator.
“Can you tell me your safeword then?” The young captain asked patiently.
“Did I hear there is no emergency? Ah, this is why he is a captain and not a general! Nonsense!” Steve heard M’baku exclaim in the background.
“Well I will be taking my leave” Bruce awkwardly rose from the table and walked over to the confused Captain. “ You are a good man Steve, Tony is lucky to have you. I know you will take good care of him”
“Ok honey, I am…honored. Thank you for trusting me, that makes me very happy sweetheart. Are there things that you really don’t like? Things you wouldn’t want to do” Steve placed his hands over the Tony’s and squeezed them in encouragement.
The fact that Tony was a submissive was common knowledge to the team however no one had really seen his submissive side. Steve was never the one to pry into other people’s business so he did not know if Tony had a Dom, but he can’t recall seeing Tony with anyone. Steve, like the rest of the team, simply assumed Tony took care of his needs privately.
“Uh… thanks?” Steve blinked at Deadpool as he moonwalked out of the room.
“Yeah, remember sex-ed, Cap?” Sam grinned at Steve.
“Thanks Bruce” Steve whispered suddenly feeling self-conscious. Bruce flashed him reassuring smile before leaning down to kiss the top of Tony’s head.
“Oh…Ok. That’s very, very sweet of you. I’m honored that you feel that way. I am going to take good care of you ok?” Steve brought his hand up to card through Tony’s hair, eliciting a pleased sound that sent shivers down Steve’s spine. Tony closed his eyes and relaxed under his fingers
“Well, I’m a beta,” Bruce replied. Steve fought to school his features.
‘We love you, Who is we?’ Steve growled.
Well, maybe not everything.
The team said that they don’t want Tony’s milkshakes in the first place and someone almost died the last time they drank one, but Steve could care less what they say. Tony was everything that was good and pure in this crazy world, and if Tony’s milkshakes brought him closer to their creator, then he could only thank Tony even more for that opportunity.
“Not quite, sir,” Jarvis replied vaguely.
He considered himself a great tactician, and easily strategized plans and turned over scenarios in his mind to get the end result he desired. Captain America had enemies and missions, but Steve Rogers no longer did.
Steve turned to find himself being scrutinized by Sam and Bruce. Bruce was sipping his tea, his gaze heavy with judgement. Sam simply had his phone pointed in his direction.
Steve stared at himself in the mirror, anxiety threatening to close around his throat. He glanced at the clock and winced, it was already 5:00pm. At the rate he was going he was going to be late.
Tony shot him a smile and placed his hand on Steve’s arm. “I know it can be difficult adjusting to everything. I am happy to help you learn everything you missed out on when you were out there sucker punching Nazis. I just want to help you in any way I can.” Tony squeezed Steve’s arm, sending warmth throughout his whole body. Steve swayed as he was almost overwhelmed with emotion.
“I am happy here at your feet master. If I have displeased you please tell me how to fix it” Tony pleaded gripping his knees with his hands.
“Is Natasha done with her Rut yet?” Steve blurted out and almost winced. He already knew the answer to that question, their argument still fresh in his mind.
‘Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.' Steve quoted the Art of War to himself as the nearness of Tony threated to overwhelm his senses. He stared ahead, unseeing as his entire focus narrowed down to the mere centimeters that separated him and his mate. 15.5 to be exact.
Getting lost in his mate's wonderful scent, Steve stiffened as he heard more teammates stomping towards them down the hall. Great.
“You have got to be kidding me! What is next, my clothes? Get ahold of yourself Rogers," Clint shoved the mug in Steve’s hand and stomped out of the room. Steve froze in shock. Clothes?
“Pining Anonymous? I have to tell Clint and Nat this is pathological. You may have created a new disorder, Steve,” Bruce laughed into his cup.
“Hey Sam. Hey Bruce.” Steve said over his shoulder as Natasha and Clint slunk out of the room behind Tony. Steve’s instincts screamed to demand everyone leave so he could scent his omega in peace but he ignored them, for now.
“It is Steve, Master” Tony spoke breathless.
Tony was Steve’s ideal omega. He was pure and he was good, too good for Steve. Steve just had to show Tony that he was the only one for Tony.
Tony was good at teaching Steve, too. Helping him navigate the strange new world he had found himself in once they took him from the ice.
Steve look up from the letter with a distinct feeling that he was missing some things. His Tony sure was a funny fella. Steve put the letter in his chest where he keeps all of the things he has gotten from Tony… well, gotten back for Tony in Clint’s case. He planned on giving it to him as a wedding gift. Steve knew he would love it.
“Tony are you comfortable where you are? You can always come and sit at the table with me” Steve inquired in a soft tone trying to keep his anxiety out of his voice.
Steve couldn’t put his finger on it but something was very off about that fella.
‘He is never going to fall for your innocent act.’ Sam signed rapidly. Bruce signed in agreement.
Tony’s eyes lit up and he waved at the intruders, which only grated Steve even more. How dare they take away Tony’s attention. Steve had to find a way to get Tony’s attention back.
“He’s right, Captain. I am going to be playing you in our self-titled movie.” Brad responded.
Steve fought the urge to block Bruce from Tony’s line of sight. Bruce knew he was bothering Steve which only made him smile wider. Steve rolled his eyes.
“You could say that, technically I am in New York right now. But there isn’t any enemy, well not an enemy of the Avengers. It's just Tony…” Steve trailed off as pain hit him in the chest again.
Tony’s bots came to visit him sometimes, which Tony complained about with jealousy. It always made Steve smile.
Steve was not prone to hyperbole, and he was by no means exaggerating about Tony’s Milkshakes. They were earth shattering. The perfect consistency of creamy and coolness, every milkshake had its unique blend of flavors that Tony made up on the spot.
But first and and most importantly-What was Steve going to wear tomorrow?
It was at that moment that Sam and Bruce started distracting him with their annoying signs, telling him to “kiss the girl”. Whatever that meant. Steve glared at his annoying teammates who continued to make kissing gestures and distract him from the task at hand: the war for Tony’s affection.
“We’ll work on it, Sam, we will work on it. You’ll be funny one day.” Tony broke the silence making everyone laugh. Steve couldn’t help the wave of fondness he felt for his omega.
“I need to speak to Bucky, it's an emergency!” Steve whispered between shallow breaths.
“Thanks.” Steve said simply, basking in the presence of his wonderful omega, whose scent was filling the space between them.
Steve quickly dug some bills out of his pocket and placed them in Mr. Brad’s hands.
“Clint dear, do you need something from me right now? All you have to do is ask” Natasha gave her submissive a withering glare which he responded with an innocent look.
“Tell me that’s not the funniest thing you have ever heard Steve! I’ve been laughing for hours!” Tony wiped tears from his eyes, “The day that I see Brad Pitt try and school someone on WWII, Hollywood is too much!”
“Which is currently green-Thank you Tony.” Bruce chimed in, grinning like a lunatic at Tony.
Steve was lightheaded with affection as he felt the omega study him from across the room. Steve calmly continued to wash Clint’s existence from Tony’s precious mug, hiding his trembling hands in the sink.
Steve’s ruts were becoming irregular and his instincts were eroding his control. Even now his Alpha instincts were a pounding drum vibrating every corner of his consciousness. He needed Tony to choose him so that he could have his sanity back.
Steve grabbed his chest and he sank to the floor as the magnitude of what happened stung his heart. Tony had given his milkshake away.
Once he reached the elevator he resisted caging Tony in the corner as he watched the omega’s talented fingers tap his floor number.
“Steve, just because Tony touches something doesn't mean it's his! I own this mug, I bought it with my own money,” Clint voice rose with annoyance.
“Your comfort must have sent him deep into subspace. Even the slightest hint of dominance would have sent him under. We don’t know how long he was dropping but I am sure you can bring him out of it.” Bruce said with a confidence Steve didn’t feel.
“I mean, why haven’t I heard about you using the-The Room?” Steve asked hesitantly.
Tony’s presence bathed everything around him in the light of warmth and perfection. Steve couldn’t think straight when Tony was near, words always falling through the cracks of his mind before they could reach his tongue.
Steve nearly leaped out of the elevator and made a beeline for the kitchen. It was nearly empty except for his wonderful omega-to-be and a homeless man who looked lost. Tony had such a big heart to help those in need. When Jarvis was feeling cheeky, he would allow random people into the Tower that Tony had to politely escort out. Cute.
“Steve… you are kidding right? You called the national emergency line to cry about Tony? What the hell? Get it together!” Bucky barked at Steve.
“You ok there, soldier?” The stranger Tony had been talking to earlier peered over the kitchen counter, snapping Steve out of his trance.
”M’baku? What are you doing here?” Steve asked in surprise as the Jabari warrior brushed past him and opened the refrigerator.
Tony also taught Steve how beautiful his eyes looked when the omega was smiling or laughing. How warm and heady Tony’s scent was and how plush and pink his lips were. Steve learned all the perfect things that made Tony, well… Tony. And Steve wanted to learn Tony for the rest of their lives.
“Everything is going to be just fine ok? Be a good boy for Steve” Nat spoke softly before placing an affectionate kiss on Tony’s forehead. Tony blushed and smiled at the sign of affection. Natasha quickly rose and turned to Steve.
“Mr. M’baku? How did you get home so fast, weren’t you just here?” Steve inquired.
“Steve… listen closely because I am not going to repeat myself." Steve immediately sat up and pulled a notepad out of his back pocket.
The slave would give absolute submission to their “Master”, putting a lot of responsibility on the Master. Steve didn’t know if he should feel honored or terrified.
The captain opened the door and immediately kneeled down to pet Dum-E on the head. He usually came to remind him of his milkshake appointment which Steve greatly appreciated.
The young billionaire stiffened at the mention of his name and remained non-responsive. Steve would be lying if he didn’t admit to fantasizing about playing with Tony like this. He could not deny his growing attraction to the genius, but he never imagined things progressing so fast.
“Tony touched it, therefore Tony’s scent and dare I say finger prints are on it. His identity is on that mug,” Steve said with a calmness he did not feel. Clint threw him a look of exasperation. Steve was very confused, he had been demanding his-Tony’s things back for months now. He would think the archer would have learned the rules.
After it let out a string of familiar beeps and clicks, Steve knew Dum-E was just fine. Steve placed the bot back on the ground and noticed that it had an envelope attached to it.
“M-Master…is this ok?” Tony ducked his head into Steve’s neck embarrassed. Steve immediately embraced him and ran his hands up and down Tony’s back to soothe him.
The Avengers were all gathered in the kitchen eating breakfast for the first time in a while. Everyone had been busy with their own individual missions and were finally under the same roof for the first time in a month.
And only Steve.
“Steve? What are you doing down there?” Steve dropped his phone in shock as he looked up to see Tony peering down at him curiously.
“Of Pain or of Pleasure, take your pick but you can’t just leave it there. It could get confusing,” Tony’s angelic voice floated through the air playfully. Steve looked at Tony as he shot him a playful look. Et tu, Brute? Steve could handle teasing. Steve was determined to play the game. And to win.
‘Either tell Tony how you feel, or we will do it for you.’ Coulson snapped his hands at him which only made steve want to roll his eyes.
The captain had heard stories about dom’s experiencing Top-space, but with every passing moment he experienced Tony’s genuine submission he felt like he was closer than he had ever been. He suddenly felt more confident as it became clearer what Tony was asking of him. What Tony needed from him. They were no longer friends and teammates secretly hoping for something more, pining for the other behind closed doors.
(5:13) thats true love if ive ever seen it
(1:08)
(9:10)
(5:27) yeah it might be better to unpack that with your therapist and not me
(6:53)
And because Tony had not slept in twenty-four hours, and he still wasn’t fully finished processing what had just happened, he sat.
(10:48) dont like that one? noted
(12:24)
Friday - AM
(5:42) my position at my company has changed
“Good,” Steve said. He wrapped his fingers around his coffee cup, and Tony pointedly did not look at them, because that was not a road of daydreams he could go down right now. “Are you doing alright? Bruce said you cut all communication the past few days.”

(8:50) an old coworker invited me out for drinks. i said no but
(10:41) That was too far. Sorry
Tony’s heart caught in his throat. He wondered, idly, at the irony of his fumbling. He was normally a master at flirting, but now, when it mattered for perhaps the first time ever, he couldn’t seem to string together a proper sentence.
(8:17) thx 4 the apology, honeybear

“Well then,” Steve said. “I hate to break it to you, Tony, but if you weren’t lying to me, and you weren’t acting, it sounds a lot like I signed up to talk to
(10:26)
“I- I don’t know. God, Cap, I don’t know.”

“Schrödinger's blush, I can deal with that. Did you get Peter to bed?”
(2:26)

(5:43)
(5:40)
. And now that he knew that it hadn’t been a lie, that, somehow, Steve,
“Didn’t they have sex-ed in the 40’s? Betas don’t go into heat or rut.” Tony explained.
Refusing to jump as he sensed Tony coming over to him, the captain hastily placed the damaged cup in the dishwasher and closed it. Taking a deep breath, he avoided eye contact with Tony and turned to his teammates. They were on the couch, disturbing him. If he looked in Tony’s eyes, Tony would know…he couldn’t afford that.
“Well, you have good timing, Brad said he was here to shadow you for his new role. He's going to be playing you in your biopic," Tony grinned squeezing his shoulder. Steve refused to fall over as his knees buckled at the contact.
“Good. I am going to kiss you now” Steve leaned in close to the darker haired man before whispering “Don’t come”. Before Tony could react to the dom’s words, Steve’s hands were surrounding the back of his neck and head and he found himself falling into the searing hot lips of his dom.
“Uh well, you see…last night I came to the kitchen to get a drink. I saw Tony had fallen asleep on the couch and he was crying out in his sleep. I went over to comfort him…I tried waking him up but it didn’t work…It must have been a very bad nightmare because I had to hold him through the rest of the night to get him to calm down…” Steve trailed off as he glanced down at Stark’s pliant form resting against his leg.
‘Just give him the mug.’ Coulson signed to the annoyed Beta as Steve held his hand out.
“Oh man, thanks Buck! Ok I am listening…”
The super soldier let out a big sigh and fixed the bow tie around his neck for the hundredth time. After a video conference with Bucky-which turned into a video conference with T’Challa and half of Wakanda- He had decided to wear a tuxedo and a bow tie.
Tony’s scent spiked slightly, cutting through the space between them like a hot knife. Steve cracked the glass he had been washing for the past 30 minutes. That was the 5th glass this week.
Dear Stevie,
Master Anthony Stark, first of his name, ruler of the 7 floors of the Avengers Tower, defender of the realm. Father of Dragons DUM-E.
“But Steve, this is mine,” Clint huffed. He clutched the mug that Tony had handed him earlier, after filling it with coffee. Why Tony felt the need to share their coffee and their mugs with other people was beyond Steve, but Steve was happy to correct his mate’s mistakes. Ecstatic even.
“Tell me what the problem is soldier, I don’t have time to play messenger between you and your bestie. This phone is for national- no it's for WORLD emergencies!” Fury sounded…well, furious. Steve didn’t register the level of anger from the SHIELD leader as his world grew blurry.
“Steve? What is going on, what happened this time? Is it New York?” Bucky spoke over the loud sirens in the background.
“That’s a good boy, you are being so good for me Tony dear” Steve whispered feeling the sub relax within his embrace. “Is there anything you need from me?” Tony leaned back from his embrace and looked at Steve briefly before suddenly studying his hands in his lap.
Bucky didn’t have a strong opinion, which did not  surprise Steve because the guy had been wearing the same outfit for the past 3 movies. Steve prayed that the Wakandan sense of style would rub off on the winter soldier.
“We love you Tony, let Steve take care of you ok?” Bruce ruffled Tony’s hair affectionately before heading back to the elevator towards his floor. Steve suddenly found himself alone with Stark still lying pliant at his feet. Steve swallowed hard as he processed the chain of events that lead Tony to gift him with his strong submission.
Steve continued to analyze the conversation he had with Tony as the week stretched on. It had been a few days since Steve had feigned ignorance of the sexual aspects of the secondary genders and Tony still had not followed up with him.
Steve slowly sank down to the balls of his feet and lifted Tony’s chin so that their eyes finally met.
“Well this is an emergency to my world! Tony is laughing with another man right now and he even gave this stranger MY milkshake! In MY Iron Man cup! How am I supposed to survive this?” Steve ignored the shrillness in his voice as he closed his eyes. He prayed his friend had an answer to his crisis.
“That would be a negative, sir,” Jarvis said with a hint of irritation.
“You have been so good for me pet, I think you deserve a reward. What is your safeword” Steve lightly stroked beneath Tony’s chin causing the sub to lean into his touch.
Steve closed his eyes and slumped against the kitchen sink. Steve hated seeing Tony leave.
Well he claimed he did, but the ease at which he makes each masterpiece made Steve wonder if everything was intricately planned in that wonderful head of his.
“You will be hearing from me about this gross breach of protocol. I don’t care if you are a super soldier, do this again and your ass is mine Rogers!” Fury spat through the phone and connected the call with the nation of Wakanda. Steve let out a sigh of relief, maybe he could survive his heart attack after all.
“You only love me for my irony,” Tony replied as he turned to Steve. Steve forced himself not to react to the mention of Love, as his insides suddenly turned to liquid.
“I only want to make Master happy” Tony gripped the bottom of Steve’s shirt and played with the hem not willing to meet Steve’s gaze. Steve took a deep breath and wracked his mind on ways to get through to a blissed out sub.
Steve glared at them; they were useless as usual. Tony was retreating now, which almost pulled out a whine from the back of Steve’s throat. Tony was too far away now, and his friends weren't even helping him. Steve had to act fast.
“You ok, buddy?” Tony asked before placing his hand on Steve’s forearm and imprisoned Steve with a look that held something Steve didn't recognize. Steve refused to flinch as the warmth from Tony’s hand seared through his entire being.
“You’ve gotta be kidding me,” Sam shook his head at Steve.
“It’s Deadpool, Mufasa, get it right. Oh, don’t forget to check out Deadpool 2, you guys! Steve, just tell Tony ‘You Complete Me,’ but make sure you are outside in the rain for dramatic effect. I’ll tell the author to add that to the tags,” Deadpool came over to Steve and gave him a firm hug.
“Good boy, follow me to the elevator” Steve ignored the stiffness in his legs as his approached the elevator. He turned to see Tony following him on his hands and knees, slowly crawling inside of the elevator before stopping at the captain’s feet. Steve studied the way the light cast a shadow across the sub’s form as he made his way to him. A sudden streak of possession coursed through him and the young dom was nearly over come with the need to claim the sub as his own. To mark him for the world to see. Steve gripped the rails and struggled to gain his composure before pressing the button for his floor. He knew there would be plenty of time for him to claim Tony to his liking. Forever if Steve had his way.
When the elevator doors opened, Tony led Steve out by his 'injured' arm. Steve followed without resistance. His anticipation rose as they approached 'The Red Room.' Steve had a good feeling about their teaching session.
“Bucky, I am serious! How am I supposed to go on?”
Steve grinned at his haters from across the room in triumph as they looked on in shock.
However, his smile disappeared as Tony quickly exited the room. Steve forced himself to stay put and watch Tony retreat. He took a deep breath. You can do this Rogers.
“Do not worry my brother. All things will work out in your favor. Just look at T’challa! He was drowning in denial and now- look! Finally got the girl,” M’baku grinned in between bites. He really like that lasagna.
“Ah! I think I hurt my arm earlier” Steve faked, hoping Tony would lavish his arm with more attention.
“You make me feel safe,” Tony stated simply, leaving Steve breathless. He felt his cheeks grow warm as his heartbeat began to grow louder in his ears.
“If anything I think you fixed him, its much quieted around here now that he’s….well whatever he’s doing” Clint smirked as he finished off the last pancake with his fingers.
“Does this mean he’s not eating? Because I have been eyeing the last pancake for a while now” Clint teased licking his lips as his fork inched towards the lone pancake that had been saved for Tony. Natasha snatched Clint’s fork with a look before turning to Steve.
“And a size queen judging from your buttplugs,” Steve thought to himself.
“Oh I flew on the spirit of my enemies, they were swift and even had a nice First Class.” M’Baku explained, showing Steve a picture of an airplane with 'Spirit: Of my Enemies' on the side. What an interesting name for an airline.
“Please just connect me, I don’t have much time left! Just do it!” Steve pleaded, clutching the phone desperately, ignoring the cracks he was causing.
“No, she’s still in the Red Room of Pain/Pleasure,” Sam said with a knowing look at Steve. Which Steve paid no mind to.
Tony’s sudden drop ripped the veil that obscured their feelings for each other, bringing them into the light. As air finally refilled his lungs, his thoughts quickly focused in on the older man before him. All previous apprehension was forgotten as Steve finally rose from the chair.
“I need to speak to Bucky, it is an emergency!” Steve pleaded.
Curious the Super-soldier took the letter and opened it, surprised that it was addresss to him. Steve squinted to make out the contents of the letter, chuckling because he recognized this horrible writing anywhere.
“Um… what? Wade, how did you even get in here,” Steve watched the strange character do a ballet routine around the room. “Do we even have a pool?”
A series of beeps and clicks interrupted his deep thoughts and Steve immediately knew what time is was. Milkshake time.
While Steve was reluctant to admit it, his rocky relationship with Tony helped give him focus. When he began to give his interactions with Tony his full attention, and recognize his emotions were something more than his vocabulary could give meaning to, things began to change.
“Nat I have no idea what has gotten into him, do you think he’s sick? Jarvis could you check Tony’s vitals? Is he feeling ok?” Steve suddenly began panicking and checking Tony’s head for fever. Tony leaned into the touch and immediately buried his head into Steve’s lap making the Captain jump in surprise.
Steve would have growled back if Tony hadn’t suddenly appeared. Beautiful and radiant, he filled the room with his presence and it took everything within Steve not to purr.
“What? T-Tony are you sure?” Steve responded suddenly hoarse as his throat felt thick with emotion. It was rare to use a name, especially your dom’s name, as a safeword. It signified a deep level of trust and even deeper level of affection. Steve stared at the sub in shock, all words evaporating on his tongue.
“The only thing I need is protection from the sub whisperer. If Cap broke Tony just imagine what he would do to me! I am fragile, I wouldn’t be able to resist his dark dominance” Clint winked at Captain causing him to sputter in embarrassment.
“Hey Sam, Hey Bruce.” Steve called out, wanted nothing more than to yell ‘go away’ at the top of his lungs as they entered his omega’s space.
“Well that’s a relief! I owe you a massage anyway, Steve. Don’t worry your virg- your arms are safe with me.” Tony said, rubbing Steve’s arm soothingly.
“Um Tony is this a joke? You’ve had your fun now can you please join the rest of the gang at the table?” The blonde captain sat stiffly in his chair as Tony moved closer to his leg and leaned against it.
It was the only choice in his mind, he just needed Tony to see it that way.
“Good Morning Tony, you know there’s a chair for you right? Are you that tired that you need to sit on the floor?” Steve looked down at his sleepy teammate in amusement. Tony tended to be non-verbal until his first 2 cups of coffee, but the man had never resorted to the floor.
Steve can’t quite pinpoint when things began to change between him and Tony, but what started off as misunderstandings and even eruptions of conflict, has over time become a close relationship. A relationship Steve was determined to make more intimate, and permanent. Steve always accomplished his goals.
“Follow me” Steve spoke over his shoulder before beckoning the dazed sub out of the elevator. Tony followed without hesitation.
Steve could care less what they thought; it was now or never.
Which is probably why Steve also rose to Tony’s taunts and exchanged insults with him. Tony was always a worthy opponent and although Steve did not understand the new world he found himself in, he knew the nuance of conflict very well. The language of war has never changed.
“Master everyone will know if they see me sitting at the table. They will think I’m being bad…”
Steve didn’t like vague Jarvis, that never turned out good for him in the long run. Steve frowned as he peered into the empty biohazard box. Huh. Steve opened his mouth to ask where his milkshake was when he heard a loud slurping sound followed by the tinkling of Tony’s laugh that always made the room seem brighter.
“Another lost soul to be rescued, Jarvis?” Steve asked softly as he skipped over to the biohazard box on the top shelf where Tony usually placed his milkshakes.
“Welcome to Wakanda, Home of the Wakanda Burger, how may I take your order?” Said a familiar voice. Steve looked at the phone perplexed.
“No one was offended Ton-sweetheart. You are very good, I just want to see your face. Can you come and sit up here with me?” Steve coaxed Tony. The sub sat for a moment before moving to peak over the table.
‘ Instead of leaving your buttplugs everywhere like a freak,’ Steve thought to himself.
Steve considered himself to be a reasonable man.
Steve slowly turned back to look at his mate talking to the poor homeless person. He instantly recognized his signature Iron Man cup clutched in the stranger’s hands. Horror clawed at his insides as he watched the hobo take his signature cherry on top and devour it like a rabid animal.
T’challa was the best dressed fella in the northern hemisphere as far as Steve was concerned, and the elders of the Wakandan tribes approved his outfit too, which was a nice bonus.
“Just call him Tony Snark,” Sam’s voice cut through the fog in Steve’s mind. Everyone just stared at Sam while he chuckled at his own joke.
“No, I don’t think so…” Steve spoke softly, trying to sound hesitant and embarrassed. Steve barely suppressed a smirked when Sam and Bruce rolled their eyes at his antics.
“Steve, you know this is an emergency line… for world emergencies… like when the world is in present danger.” Bucky’s voice sounded strained as he attempted to explain to his childhood friend.
“Can you sit in my lap? Would you enjoy that?” Steve scooted his chair away from the table and held out his hands in encouragement. Tony regarded Steve hesitantly before shyly standing up and sitting in Steve’s lap facing the dom.
After a particularly grueling working out, Tony was standing in the kitchen looking as bright as the North Star-beckoning him to bathe in his warmth. Steve didn't remember walking over to Tony, and definitely did not recall the conversation they had before Tony placed that manna from heaven into his hand. However, once the flavor burst on his tongue from Tony’s cool creation he knew he couldn't live without it.
“Step one- get off your ass. Step two- walk said ass over to Tony. Step three- ask Tony out on a date-- USE YOUR WORDS! Step four- do not contact me again until steps 1-3 are accomplished, in order. This has been the 5th false alarm this week, Rogers!” Bucky growled with annoyance that went completely unnoticed by Steve.

“Gross. Don’t get mushy on me, Captain.”
“Do you know who I am?”
(7:46)
(6:57) ok fine
(6:37)
“Sorry again,” Steve said. “For the misunderstanding. And, you know, tricking you here.”
(8:12)
“Slow and steady, Captain, picking up the pace. I’m touching myself, too. I- ah- want to suck your dick.”
(2:17) you too.
(10:09) are you sure?
He slowed as he approached the coffee shop. It was a small hole-in-the-wall type of place, one of his favorites, and close enough to Natasha’s gym that they often met there for coffee or lunch. Tony straightened the collar of his suit jacket and then pushed the door open, bell tingling gently overhead as he did.
(5:50)
Tony blinked into Steve’s shoulder as the man pulled him in for a hug.
(9:43)
(9:19)
“Oh. Listen…”

“No.”
(2:45)
“I’m the one who locked everyone out so I could wallow in self-pity.”
Tony looked back down at his phone. His finger was hovering over Captain’s contact, which he had blocked, but somehow not deleted despite his varying levels of sobriety over the past few days.
(2:42)
(12:55)
“... Hm?”
(1:23)
(5:42) let’s just say that i had a rude awakening
(9:51)
“Bath time took awhile, huh?”

“Yeah. They’re a bitch, aren’t they?”
(10:50)

(9:41)
“Uh… how was your day?”
(9:37)
(2:16)
“Well, you’re much more attractive in person yourself,” Steve said, “and I didn’t know that was possible.”
[ Calling - captain🔥🔥 ]
(5:21)

(2:48)
(11:48)
“Fiddling with my clean energy converter. Once I have a solid prototype I’ll be able to take it to the board and hopefully get this shit passed.”
