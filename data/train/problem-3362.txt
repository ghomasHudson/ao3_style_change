John looked on at Dean with worry etched on his face when he heard a few sobs echoing over the phone. Dean carefully listened and frowned, then his father got to see the pure parental anger on his face. He waited a short moment for the blowup...
"Did she make homemade vegemite?!" Dean whispered in horror, staring at a dark brown paste in a clear glass bowl. He recognized the contents and remembered the horrid taste from Crowley's dare when he became a demon a couple of years prior.
A young girl named Abby shook in her bedroom, crying as she watched her father walk into the room with a leer on his face. All of a sudden he was stabbed in the back and he sagged onto the carpet.
Dean sighed and glanced at Sam while driving the Impala. "Sammy, I told you not to blame yourself for what happened to Jess."
"...hello? ...oh bloody hell could you stop laughing at her name?!" Crowley yelled over the phone once he heard the rise of hysterical laughter.
He was about to check the balcony until he heard a sniffle and a light whimper coming from the bathroom.
Castiel glared at Gabriel. "I thought he was just one of Metatron's mirages that tricked me into visiting Heaven for a moment," he explained and crossed his arms.
The tall man looked confused. "Then how..." "Sam." John interrupted, causing his youngest son to turn at his attention.
Is anyone else anticipating for the Fallout? (a.k.a. Sam & Dean talking to John about Mom's family of hunters, Adam, Bill Harvelle, Men of Letters, and Henry Winchester)
"It depends on how they're interpreted," He replied, "Most of the stuff is real, which is why go through research to find the common or original sources."
The doctor sighed and gestured to lower his voice. "You'll wake the other children in the pediatric ward, Agent Morgan. I'm just glad Nikita has someone who's actually watching for her now. It used to be only a student training to be a nurse - I think her name was Jessica Moore - with her caring boyfriend who's studying to be a lawyer. I think his name was Sam Winchester?" He shook his head. "Either way, it was tragic of what happened with Jessica. I was about to hire her as my medical assistant at the Child Protection Services in Palo Alto. Her boyfriend, Sam, was going to surprise her on her first day of work by working as a lawyer in one of their offices, too."
"Son, I also got a warning from Bobby in the call about the next hunt... they said someone appeared to look like a younger version of you running around, so I don't want to risk you getting caught by the police out of nowhere. I'll stay with you guys this time while hunting so I can keep feeding you while teaching you the basic school education stuff."
The couple could hear Sam's curses from the inside of their room. After a while Gabriel's familiar voice piped in with a loud and obnoxious tone.
"Oh, baby, I'm so sorry... I wasn't ever gonna hit ya, honey... I'm just mad at the demon, you know that..." John whispered gently as he crouched slowly towards her and envelop her in a hug. She immediately leaned into the embrace and started to cry - an act that silently shocked John because since she met her he had never seen or heard her cry.
Sam walked into the kitchen with Sully and Weems trailing after him. The tall man called them over for some help, and they agreed to help him win the bet.
P.S.: Sorry, it'll be a bit short because I'm pressing on time today and I don't want to leave this hanging before the New Year. Happy Holidays!
Sam frowned and shook his head. "Are you two doing this to clear some kind of conscious because you've been lying about being in a relationship as husbands? We're not going to judge you."
John chuckled and moved to follow Sam to the 1967 Chevrolet Impala, which was unlocked at the moment because he knew his son's eagerness for school, but was stopped by Dean. "Oh, dude, what's wrong?" He asked him.
Castiel stared at John with wonder and sadness in his eyes at the same time. At this point Gabriel is snoring on Castiel's right side by the window. As an archangel Gabriel doesn't have to sleep, but he likes humanity so at that moment he decided to conjure up a happy dream for himself. Sam had been appointed to drive while Dean decided to sleep after eating his pie. For the past hour or so John and Castiel have been whispering to each other, to which Sam ignored while driving because he didn't wish to eavesdrop on that conversation. He knew the angel felt obliged to report to his father about all that they've been through since he first met them.
The young girl nodded and gently closed the book shut. "Maybe... if I could get my hands on a witchcraft book, I could attempt to duplicate the bullets?"
"Yeah?" He responded after finishing packing. He didn't think he was going to take any books except for printed pages, so that was enough for him.
That was reassurance for Jesse as well, as it turns out, when he told his story about having an early childhood with strange powers and distant parents, who turned out weren't his real parents. His slightly disastrous experience with Sam Winchester and Castiel were expressed into the story, along with showcasing just how good Dean is with children. Nikki had to reassure both him and Benny that Sam and Castiel had changed as well, although she heard about Sam's stupid time making Dean feel like shit before he became a demon. Then Jesse and the Piper Boy had to restrain Benny from destroying part of the forest in anger on behalf of Dean's emotional well-being. Bela started to feel more comfortable with seeing the Winchesters again, especially if Nikki is by her side.
That stirred something strange inside the hunter as he gulped, staring at his friend. "Y-Yeah, that would awesome, man."
She heard another floorboard creak closer to her room and she panicked, quickly moving onto the bed while laying the thick book of spells at the foot of the bed. It wouldn't take long for this Metatron guy to find a small handle on the floor inside the closet, where she's currently hiding in.
The young Asian girl giggled and headed towards the Impala, with her father following her with a chuckle.
John slowly parked at the nearest motel he could find and turned to his young companion. "Angel as in Heaven? There's no such thing as angels, honey."
John looked at her with worry. "Nikita, you know I wouldn't hurt you... I'm not your parents. I can protect you..." He spoke gently to her, but then caught the difference on the wall at the corner of his eye. He stared at the wall while Nikita started shouting please not to hurt her and had apologized for ruining his trail for thought. After hearing that last bit, John quickly shook his head and stared at the bed where Nikita was hiding with incredulous looks. "Nikki... this is better than what I came up with! You found the specific spirit I was hunting!" He laughed lightly and moved over to the bed to lift the bedsheets slowly. "Come on, I'm not mad, Nikki. Come out of there..." He suddenly thought of an idea and grinned down at the young girl slowly emerging from underneath the bed.
"I can't believe my boys have been through that much together and haven't fallen apart because of me yet." John sighed and looked down at his calloused hands. "It's no wonder how they're much stronger than me when they're together and apart. I could barely keep myself together."
Sam suddenly woke up with a gun in his hands from under his pillow in his bed trained to wherever that noise came from. He glared at Sully, his former Zanna buddy.
As Dean parked the car in front of a grocery store, Castiel sat up straight once a thought had suddenly occurred to him. The hunter noticed his friend's posture and turned to towards him. "You okay, Cas?"
Castiel turned to look at him in thought. "Perhaps I can take on the educational system at the local university to teach mythology and the actual ways of faith with Heaven? I can have Gabriel create textbooks as proof and maybe future hunters or children rooted from hunter families can achieve an education while staying with their families and in the hunting life."
Castiel sat up straight and frowned. "What about Bela? She must be still stuck in her Hell with her sexually abusive father and alcoholic mother. Shouldn't she be rescued, too?"
Said girl named Claire looked up at him with a wide smile. "Hey, Castiel - check out my progress report! I can graduate from high school in a month!" She cheered as she pulled out her folded copy of her report from her back pocket to give to Castiel.
Gabriel sadly nodded, causing the others to gape in shock. "Dean, I suggest you turn around and focus on driving. We have about 5 hours left to reach to the cabins in Salvation." He turned towards John again. "That's why Nikita Yuson shouldn't have existed, yet somehow fit into the plane of existence, so the Fates didn't think anything was wrong. Father deliberately made sure this fledgling was to be under the disguise as Caylao Tuico in Canada. Instead of being born there, she was born in Los Angeles. Someone must have messed with the information, because she somehow interfered with the Winchester timeline..." The archangel trailed off and his eyes widened, but then shook his head. "No, my Father is not that messed up of a man. Only he could have altered her birth records, but... no, he's not that much a dead-beat dad. I can't... I can't..." He trailed off as he took a deep breath to calm down and lowered his head in his hands.
1. I edited this story a bit after posting the 5th chapter. I realize that maybe I made a couple of mistakes in the story but I'm not going to fix them because it's a fanfic. There's bound to be mistakes, so long as the story is executed and makes sense to the readers.
"Nikki! It's time to go to school! Your first day, sweetie!" John exclaimed as he pushed the open door. Unfortunately, he had chosen the wrong door and instead stumbled into Dean's room.
She ran through the door of the cabin they were staying in and she gasped, seeing John unconscious on the kitchen floor. She had no time to check what the thin wrapped envelope was on the dining table and grabbed her witchcraft book of spells.
Castiel frowned. "Brother, I seem to be not getting the relevance to your epiphany of your lost memories with this... Doctor... and this Captain you speak of."
The college student, Hugo Weasley, was a recent transfer student from Europe and enrolled himself into Castiel's school. Dean figured he may not be entirely human, but that was okay, because the ginger-haired boy was very ambitious and helped around the garage whenever he could. Besides, Hugo had a lot of questions that he wanted to ask to teach his grandfather how electricity and mechanisms work here in America. (Most of them were pretty odd questions as if his grandfather had never seen or touch electricity before, but Jack quickly joined in on the discussion every now and then - or rather whenever he eavesdrops on Hugo's incredulous questions.)
Both Dean and John snorted. "No, you pervert! I wouldn't do that to any kid!" Dean spat and climbed back into the car after filling up the tank of gasoline.
Dean and Castiel find jobs while John connects to the Hunter World again with Sam's help. Gabriel eventually is released from John's trap to contact Crowley on an update with Jesse's life. A surprise visit arrives at the Bunker with more news that could change the Winchesters' lives.
Jody sighed. "Yep, and she decided to study as a Classics Major to help you guys on hunts." She hugged both Dean and Castiel before following them down the stairs to greet the others.
She glanced at the book in her grasp, then at the small bed behind her that was placed there for hiding emergencies.
Before Castiel could respond, Gabriel snapped his fingers again. "Hey, hey! Getting off track again here! Let's get back to how the fuck Nikita ended up in the Yuson family when she was supposed to be into witness protection in the Tuico family under the name 'Caylao'."
Sam's eyes widened. "Do you think maybe he could free Adam's soul into Heaven?" He asked with hope. John sat up quickly with more hope than his son at the possibility.
For the past hour, Gabriel had briefly explained why a witch may have something to do with Nikita Yuson, the girl that John and Dean have decided to travel to Salvation, Iowa for.
Gabriel and Crowley stared after Castiel's retreating figure, then turned to give each other a bemused look.
Claire's eyes widen, then they slowly narrowed in suspicion. This was all too coincidental. "Are you by any chance related to Dean Winchester?"
He found Castiel a few minutes later and smiled, walking over to him down the hallway into the 2nd library room (they found out there were several rooms in the Bunker that had nothing but books).
Sam sighed as he elected himself to pick up the phone and pressed the speaker button. He frowned when he saw the "666" number, indicating it was Crowley calling. Everyone (i.e.: John, Jody, Claire, Ben, Alex, Donna, Dean, Sam, Castiel, Nikki, and Gabriel) crowded around the phone. "Hey Crowley, what's up?" Sam greeted the King of Hell.
As she drew the runes, she kept listening quietly to the conversation happening upstairs. Luckily, the man named Metatron drew back to Rowena but spoke with an exasperated tone in his voice. "That would make things easier for us, though we're in the past now. I'm afraid we really need Dean to be the Righteous Man and Sam to free Lucifer in order to keep the odds we currently have in our favor."
"You found what could kill Azazel," she spoke in a soft voice. Come to think of it, from John's perspective, the girl has always talked in a soft tone unless she laughs, which was a rare feature for anyone to see, including him.
Nikita's eyes widened at that remark. Her mind drew a blank for a moment, though she could catch on quickly by being quiet.
Sam looked very concerned at Dean and nodded. "Okay, maybe that's why we both feel this way. We'll leave as soon as I take a shower. You can go call Dad and see if he could actually pick up."
Nikki pressed her open cut below where Bela's cut was, and immediately Bela started form into a soul ball. The young Asian teen grinned. "See you on the topside!" She cheered, which made Benny mentally go through dejavu at the same scene where Dean said the same thing when absorbing Benny's soul. He watched as the soul ball was sucked into Nikki's arm.
The Piper Boy pouted cutely as he twirled his auburn-colored hair with his finger. Nikki silently wondered if he deliberately kept changing his hair color and texture, then decided later would be the time to possibly name the boy in front of her. Probably something from the Harry Potter book series...
The young Asian teenager grabbed the Australian-raised cambion and pulled him into the portal, which closed right as they disappeared.
Rowena glared at him. "You never had felt her power in the first place BECAUSE YOU ARE HUMAN NOW, YOU WEE LITTLE INGRATE!" She let out a frustrated sigh. "Let's just find a way to read the damn demon tablet you got there, lad."
Now, the angel was baking some goods for Claire, Ben, and Nikita when they get out from school and come back to the Bunker. He preheated the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit while lining baking sheets with parchment paper for amaretti cookies*, which were one of Claire's favorite as a kid. He already took out the banana nut muffins** for Ben from the oven to check on them with a toothpick. When he was satisfied, he placed them on a rack beside Nikita's finished blueberry buckle***.
Wanting to keep his bets in place, Crowley decided that the lady should leave. It wasn't looking too good through the window vision in the garage shop. He snuck back towards the group and approached the woman. "Excuse me, Miss...?"
"Yeah, but... the practice that I applied to interview for was to be a lawyer available for Child Protection Services. It was a new position offered and I didn't want to pass it up."
All the Winchesters turned to the angel in shock. "You mean Sleeping Beauty is a real story?!" Dean shouted/asked/demanded. One never knew what tone Dean specifically sounds like when he gets this way.
John's eyes widened in panic at Gabriel and nodded before turning to the young Asian girl. "Baby, I'm so sorry..." He whispered breathlessly, nearly tearing as he carefully gathered the frozen girl into his embrace more. His lips gently kissed her forehead, and that's when a miracle happened.
The supernatural group gasped and turned to find a burly vampire with a nice looking cap. They each held a weapon: The Piper Boy used his musical pipe, Nikki had her personalized angel blade in hand, Jesse held a sharp tooth-like weapon (which came from one of his wings... turns out his cambion wings can reproduce the talons as sharp pointy weapons), and Bela had borrowed Nikki's gun.
Gabriel chewed in thought and swallowed before replying. "...I could maybe conjure up any kind of diploma to skip any detours in education - "
Dean snorted in reply. "Like I said earlier, we're not gonna do this the lazy way. Besides, I don't want you and Gabriel wasting your graces away while you're both slowly replenishing it with Heaven's powers back in order."
Dean groaned and wiped his face with his hand. His fiance was right. It wasn't morally right to leave Bela in Hell after what they've recently learned about her and why she chose her paths the way she did. He nodded to Gabriel, who grabbed the phone from the table to talk to Crowley.
Sam glanced at Dean and focused on the road with wide eyes. Did his father know that he was listening in, is that why he brought up the subject?
Someone shouted in the hallway from a distance. "GABRIEL, IS THAT SOMETHING SWEET I SMELL? IT BETTER BE SOMETHING COOKED, NOT BOUGHT FROM THE CANDY SECTION OF THE STORE!"
The doctor shook his head. "That's not the worse part. The child received a heat stroke due from her job as a transporter for packages. It's technically not really a job, since she won't be earning money. I recently found out from a couple of cops who came here yesterday to interview her that the parents paid for Mary Anne's hospital bills first before Nikita's. Because the family doesn't have enough money, they made Nikita find a job in town as the family left with Mary Anne to Los Angeles for more medical treatment. She fainted in front of her boss after three hours of driving in this heat with traffic. Luckily the police were nearby when she fainted."
"Damn, we got distracted - that damn abomination probably used her powers to push us away!" Metatron complained as he kicked at the dirt.
Although, there had been many single women (either in relation to a student or friends with a student) flirting with him, but he would always show his ring when walking around campus and show off his pictures with Dean framed on his desk if he was in his office with those women. Some would back off immediately and others would still remain flirting with him, to which he'd quickly call lunch break and fly off to visit Dean.
"What?! Lemme see that!" Sam shouted in shock and grabbed the will from his brother, then read it carefully. "Dean, it says here that you'd only get the rights if you have a stable home that the CPS can use to check you and her up in - "
The hunter-turned-mechanic sat up straight and pulled Ben into a hug. "What... how.... I didn't even know - "
Castiel narrowed his eyes at him. "For starters, this place is warded from angels, especially in Claire's room."
"Wouldn't it be easier to create insurance to help benefit your sister and to make our own jobs? I used some of my grace earlier to help Sam authenticate legal documents of our marriage, identities, and custody of Nikita."
The vampire cursed as he realized this and used the angel blade offered to cut his own arm. He placed his arm directly over Jesse's cut. "Boy, you better know what you're doing." He grumbled at him and turned to Nikki. "Once we get topside, I better have that potion ready."
"I still can't believe Lucifer was the one who was supposed to take care of a baby Nephilim," Sam spoke his thoughts aloud.
old, though you really need to be updated on everything, including on the hunting lifestyle. Not all monsters are bad."
Dean suddenly sobbed and was overcome with emotions. The only thing he could do was hug Ben tightly against him.
I snuck in a little tiny crossover of Dark Angel. Maybe or maybe not - I could possibly sneak it in again in a future chapter somewhere, if it fits.
Castiel decided to speak up. "Actually, Dean, there are places such as California that have numerous students who are around your age and older attending community college and transferring to a university institution for education. It is not too late for you to achieve this education your father speaks of. Remember: I raised you from Perdition and rebuilt your body. I know almost everything about you and I feel you have potential for a degree in engineering."
Nikita's cheeks flushed in embarrassment, but encouragement from the imaginary "Piper Boy" sitting beside her gave her some confidence to stand up and walk to the board. Just when someone stuck out his foot at the last second to make Nikita trip, the Piper Boy frowned and quickly grabbed Nikita's arm, slightly jerking her away from tripping on anything on the ground. She glanced at the foot and blushed more, letting the Piper Boy lead her to the chalkboard without tripping.
Sam sadly nodded. "When her parents left to see their eldest daughter, I went to talk with her. Her name's Nikita Yuson and I could tell her family has been abusing both her and her sister, though she told me her sister was like that sometimes, too. I wanted... I wanted to be
John finished packing up so they could leave the hotel and glanced at the last thing that needs packing which was what Nikita was currently staring at. "Yep. Samuel Colt created a gun that could kill anything, except for very few species of the supernatural world, but it'll make our lives easier if we get our hands on that Colt. Besides, he's only made a dozen bullets, from what it says there," He explained briefly with an accomplished look on his face.
Nikki's eyes widened in alarm as she turned to look at Jesse's unsure and pale face. "What do you mean? Dean and Sam said they saw Adam themselves go into Hell and be tortured in the Cage."
"What?" Sam asked when he glanced up from what he was reading, which was a contract of rights made by John Winchester that was approved by the Yuson family's lawyer.
"Apparently she was put up for adoption in Australia as a newly born baby and was named by one of the nuns at a nearby church. They unfortunately focus on meanings of the names rather than the less weird things you could name yourself."
Dean glanced up from his conversation with a customer as the truck parked at the garage shop. He smiled softly and excused himself with the customer, who happened to be a flirty female. John noticed that not once did Dean check her chest.
John couldn't help but snort. "Except for Mary's family. They were always so full of their 'righteous' beliefs that that was what convinced Mary to elope with me... well, before the Michael situation Castiel here told me just now."
Alex, who turned out to be X5-494, was currently on his way to Kansas to join Max. After further explanation from Max, Hugo stepped up and shakily revealed himself as a wizard. Dean had a feeling he wasn't a normal human being, so he simply nodded at the explanation. With how silent their boss was, both Max and Hugo stared at him with confusion and disbelief until Zuriel mentioned that he was an angel in an empty human vessel (he consented with the previous soul before the soul could move on to Heaven). Dean had mentioned after that that he was a hunter and that he's married to an angel, so hearing all these explanations from each of his employees wasn't exactly a surprise.
Everyone nodded in agreement that this would be the best choice as they were eating their special emu parmigiana, Tim Tam, fairy bread, and Pavlova. Those were the only meals that tasted good. It turned out the cookies that were supposed to have coconut were substituted with some worm-like maggot that had everyone, including the angels, throw up.
Castiel was baking in the kitchen. Lately with some guidance from Dean, he found comfort in baking. Dean was a great master at cooking, and together they conquered the kitchen together.
John hesitantly grabbed the sheet of paper and unfolded it. His eyes widened and he nearly shed tears. "This is Mary's handwriting..." he mentioned with a soft tone in his voice.
"Go choke on your feathers, chuckles. I'll contact you soon for an update." Crowley then abruptly hung up afterwards.
4. Destiel moments~ At this point if anyone wants to make a request to add more to the plot you can comment here! :)
The next day Dean was surprised to find his dad walking back into the hotel room. "Dad? Back so soon?"
Said teen turned towards her as she put the gun away inside her trench coat. "...I'm the one that will raise you from perdition," she eventually answered softly.
Castiel, who tilted his head slightly and didn't bother to hide by the doorway, mumbled softly to Dean's ear. "What type of meat is stuffed in the pie?" He asked while pointing at the huge hefty pie next to Gabriel on the counter top.
On top of that, Jonghyun Kim from SHINee died. He was an inspiration to me since 2009, when my sister first introduced SHINee to my music palette. It sucks because he's been my muse for so long - actually, one of the rare reasons why I've decided to stay alive. It's been tearing me up for a long while, and damn, my life is currently in shambles right now.
He still loves his one-track minded father, who is stern and strict most of the time but he has decent intentions.
The young girl's eyes snapped open, flashing a very light amber-grey color. Gabriel noticed how similar her eye color was to his and smiled softly at her, silently proud at what she's accomplished since she first settled in the Bunker.
Dean looked up from under the hood of a blue 1968 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 and stared right at Sam. "You're still pissed that her Piper Buddy gave it away, aren't you?"
He hired another person who he thought was a young human college student, but he wasn't sure after seeing him hold a strange looking stick by his side whenever there was trouble from the customers at the garage shop. (Though there had been minimal disasters since he started work. Dean alone had gotten rid of three motor bicyclists from a gang who were harassing a female customer, but he had help from Zuriel and Jack when a demon tried to enter the grounds. Both Dean and Zuriel were about to explain to Jack about demons afterwards, but the man dismissed the discussion and prompted to flirt with Zuriel. And that was that.)
The blonde teenager saw the small young girl hiding behind a slightly tall man with a gruffy beard. Claire turned to Castiel and pointed at the man. "Who's he and the girl behind him?"
Dean waved it away. "Stop that. And yeah, it sucks, but now we remember and the now is all that counts. The past is behind us." He strode over with Castiel still touching his back. His eyes caught on to a significant document and he picked it up. His eyes widened slightly. "Holy shit." He mumbled in awe.
Nikita touched her cheek where her painful tooth was and glared at John. He chuckled a bit and led the young girl to the dentist's office. Sam shook his head and made a few more phone calls.
The elder Winchester's eyes widened as he glanced around the area. "Do you think it could be witches?"
Dean grunted as he slumped in a chair beside his new husband/angel. He glanced at him and gulped upon seeing a content smile on Castiel's face. "I would gladly help raise your sister, Dean." He informed the hunter.
Gabriel rolled his eyes and made way to the door. "Move, Winchester. I can handle this." The short archangel strode over to the frozen wooden door and kicked it, smashing the entire door into smithereens.
Richard grinned and pulled out a lollipop sucker from his pocket, unwrapping the plastic and popped it in his mouth. "Why not?" He shrugged with a cocky grin.
Weems grunted in agreement and smiled along with Sully. "Yep, we're the best of pals! And Sully here used to be Sam's spirit guide as a kid!"
Sam definitely didn't want to know if John's reaction towards Castiel's obsession over Dean would be positive or negative. He was banking on negative.
"YOU WHAT?! SINCE WHEN?!" Sam & Gabriel cried out, with the former being alarmed and the latter being joyful over the fact that this news was a happy shock.
Sam quickly whipped out his phone and went through his gallery photos. "I know chances of this are 1 in a million, but is this her?" He asked in wonder as he showed his brother his phone. The picture consisted of Sam smiling happily beside the same description of a girl Dean made, except she grew more in her early preteen stage but was still pretty small. In comparison to Sam's puppy smile, she only had a weak small one for the camera. Her face had a few bruises and she also had a cast for her left arm.
The Piper Boy snorted while Nikki hummed and kicked the ground filled with dirt. Her closed-toe white-and-tan wedges moved a few pieces of rock away from her. She was still wearing her flowery dress underneath the yellow trench coat and her hair was tied up in a loose bun (courtesy of John Winchester). The Zanna teenager thought she looked very cute with her pair of angelic wings.
John shrugged. "I thought of what you just said earlier, like last week earlier, so I'll have to admit that you wanting to learn about witchcraft could be useful in the long run - so long as you don't make demon deals."
Nikita's eyes widened in shock. When she spoke, it was obvious that her voice was sore. As soon as she could move her hands, John planned to have her write her responses instead so she could heal her voice.
Dean contemplated on the information for a moment before nodding and turned to his younger brother. "So what does she look like? Is she still in California? I know we're on the other side of the country, but I can always give Dad a call so he could check it out." Sam scoffed when their father was mentioned. Dean frowned. "Hey, he cares, too! There was this one time when I was 17 and you were 13 yourself, and Dad took us to a saddle ranch resort where I witnessed by ear of bad parenting. I told Dad all about it and he went his way to check it out before we left, remember?"
Gabriel shrugged and jutted his chin out towards Castiel. "I talked to Cassie several months ago. I assumed he told you..."
Lucifer shook his head and chuckled. "Looks like I fooled Sam, alright. When Castiel 'Molotov-ed' Michael with his new angel banishing cocktail all those years back, he pushed Michael back to Heaven, including sending Adam's soul back to Heaven. Every time Sam tried to protect 'Adam', he was actually trying to protect Michael." He momentarily gave a sad look towards Adam's empty vessel, which used to house Michael. "He wasn't supposed to die..." He murmured to himself, then immediately went back to giggling softly as he slowly sat on the ground to stare at Adam's face, talking to him as if he was alive and... Michael.
Dean stood there for a long time by the stairway. Everyone else waited and stared at Dean's rigid figure and John's desperate look on his face.
The Piper Boy simply smiled and answered her as if she asked the questions aloud. "I'm you're Imaginary Friend. Everyone has one, but you're a Nephilim, which makes you special. I can be incorporated out of your dreams once you turn 18 because it's an adult age, though since this rarely occurs I cannot guarantee that I'd land in the right universe. My kind is a mix of a djinn and a Fae." He hopped up on the edge of her desk and crossed his skinny legs. Nikita couldn't help but notice the boy's figure hidden under his slightly baggy yet thin white buttoned shirt and denim blue jeans. She also noticed that the Piper Boy was barefoot.
"Yeah, yeah, great dramatic moment for the Winchester clan. Question though: Can I go back to my epiphany of what I just remembered?"
, where people associated with hunters can help research or understand the supernatural natures of the world and learn how to aide other victims in the future of supernatural causes (2 floors - basement floor is very wide and travels to the outdoors as a parking structure); and lastly, a cream colored building with some ivory stems grown around it that appears in a gothic cathedral style of architecture was made as the
Donna's eyes lit up seeing the fairy bread and inched closer to the plate, which then caused Gabriel, who already sat at the table to eat Tim Tams, to bring said plate closer to her while munching on the homemade biscuit.
Jesse ducked at Nikki's warning, just in time to evade a blade swipe from another demon. He glared at the offender and snapped his fingers. The demon erupted in ashes onto the ground.
"Your brother is actually very good with physics and arithmancy. I was actually shocked when he told me he wanted to quit school... he told me at 13 [years old] that he considered engineering in community college - "
The couple frowned in unison at him. "What is that supposed to mean, Sam?" Dean asked in growing anger.
With that image in mind, everyone except for Gabriel scrammed out through the door with the policemen following behind to chase the college students.
For example, I was going to make this fic into a series, where the sequel would be the OC (Nikki) going to meet her mysterious Pied Piper in some shape or form, and the visual muses were an AU version of SHINee. (Spoiler alert.)
Dr. Harkness smirked at the short nurse named Richard. "We promised John that justice will be served with the female nurses at the pediatric ward. Shall we grant his wish?"
"I am immune to diseases and will try the fish and chips first before tasting everything else for all of you," Castiel informed him quietly. "If any of them do not taste good or are poisonous, I will attempt to help her with the Pavlova she is currently trying to make."
Soon after Dean's feet landed on soiled earth the cabin began to visibly shake and collapse right after Gabriel, Castiel, and John ran out of the small building with a little girl and thick big book in tow. Together, the makeshift family watched the cabin quickly turn into a wet wooden rubble.
Abby screeched and crawled further backwards at the pillows of her bed. She watched in shock as a young Asian teenager glared at her father's figure and pulled out a gun hidden from inside her yellow trenchcoat. She shot the man in the chest, causing an orange glow from his body.
Castiel scanned the area and nodded alongside Dean. "Yes, and maybe we could use the empty office building a few blocks away from here and have some of the angels who want to stay on Earth to start an 'insurance company'. They could permanently fund your business and it would be entirely legal to the public eye."
"But - what about Crowley?" Dean asked in haste. "Don't we need to find Jesse and spring Bela and Adam out from Hell?"
"Shit, I didn't think about your parents, hun. My mind was on the hunt that my friend Pastor Jim called about earlier - "
he's here!" He waved his arm over at Gabriel. "What the fuck is our Dad doing here, Gabriel?! And I thought you died!"
Castiel sighed and nodded along, though he paused in his footsteps as he glanced at a shop on his right side.
, he thought rationally to himself. Besides, he had to celebrate the new couple and engagement. He patted Castiel on the shoulder. "Thanks, buddy, and for what it's worth, congratulations again on the engagement." He grinned at the angel before turning back to the research on the table. "Maybe we should table this hunt for now. Has it been hurting people lately?"
Abby's eyes widened in awe for a long moment, but then flinched as she overheard drunken screaming from below her room floor. It was the voice of her mother.
"What was the spell, Dad?" Dean asked while driving and simultaneously glancing at the rearview mirror to see his father. He wanted to reassure himself that his father was legitimately there. Sam and Castiel noticed what Dean was doing but didn't voice out anything about it, which Dean was grateful for.
John snorted in reply. "Kid, it's St. Patrick's Day and there was a discount for group parties... also snuck in a little sweetening by mentioning my own son is getting married to a guy, and the lady I talked to happened to be pro-LGBTQA+, so..."
Nikki took a deep breath and nodded, feeling slightly nervous for the trip ahead of her. No one is excited for Hell, after all.
Nikita quickly draws up the spell to protect her and the cabin, causing Rowena and Metatron to forget her and focus on erasing the Winchester family's memories of her with the lack of time they had. After being booted out of the time frame, they reluctantly relish in one small accomplishment and try drawing plans for the present. The Winchesters wake up on reset and live their lives.
The Winchester brothers woke up in their motel rooms feeling a bit dizzy. They looked at each other with confusion.
"Whoa whoa whoa! I'm not - I - uh..." Dean hastily put his hands up in the air. "I have to marry someone to claim my surrogate sister, okay? So your grandpa chose Cas. Plus, he and I click."
"Yeah, I'm sure! I can't forget this face - shit, I'll call Dad about this. Hopefully he can help her in between hunts."
"WE HAVE TO GO, NOW!" Dean shouted as the creaks got worse and shakes suddenly began throughout the foundation of the cabin structure. Sam quickly grabbed the envelope and its contents before hightailing it out of the cabin with his brother following him.
The man sighed but nodded reluctantly. "Okay, we're married now. We have to find jobs for both of us." Dean turned to his father. "Can't Sam find a job with us?"
"Oh shit, let me heal that for you..." Ben panicked and ran to where Claire had her personal bathroom (the perks of having her own dorm room). He came back out with a cold wet towel and offered it to her.
Both Castiel and Dean nodded. The latter male counted by his fingers. "One - you weren't watching out for Claire."
Everyone in the Impala nodded. Both Dean and Sam had taken turns telling their father how they met their grandfather, Henry Winchester.
Dean slowly hung up the phone and turned to the other occupants in the car. After hearing the entire discussion, John frowned at his eldest son. "Really, Dean? I can't believe you said those words to her! Those were her last words before she died!" He slapped the back of his son's head. "No child should be touched that way at all! It might as well looked like you supported her late father when she was alive - "
Dean sensed a feeling of dread pass right through him and spread into the car. "What the hell is that supposed to mean?"
Cecelia gaped at them and awkwardly nodded, quickly stuttering an excuse to leave and left to her car. Dean watched in confusion as she sped out of the shop grounds.
Castiel was staying past his usual office hours to grade his first assignment papers from his students when he got the call from Claire. He checked the caller ID and smiled softly, putting down his pen and papers to answer the call. "Hello, Claire. How are you? ....what? Claire, calm down..... what happened?"
He glanced over at Sam, who stared at the wall with worry. The younger Winchester sleepily turned to his brother while laying on his bed. "Dean, do you think the ghost managed to find us or hurt the next door neighbors?"
Castiel placed a gentle hand on Dean's arm, causing him to slowly calm down. "Sam, I asked Dean to marry me and he said yes."
Nikki turned her naturally innocent look at her charge. "He's my brother by choice... I'm more closer to his father, though..."
(By the way, please ignore some slight errors in my past writing, especially where Bobby Singer was referred to as "Bobby Smith". Fucking auto correct...)
Dean yelled after just arriving at the Bunker with Sam, Castiel, and a still-in-healing Crowley. Sam reluctantly hooked Crowley up with a box supply of human blood from the hospital, which was where they had Crowley kept in for a while, luckily without his demon allies knowing. Castiel made sure he was between Sam and Crowley because from what the King of Hell mentioned back at the hospital, Sam tried to kill Crowley for Rowena's help and ended up scrapping out most of whatever feelings Crowley had left for humanity. The taller Winchester knew he was very lucky that Crowley still considered Dean as his best friend when the elder Winchester brother had been the one to admit Crowley into the hospital for human treatment. As it turns out, Crowley's mother, Rowena, was not to be trusted - typical of a witch. What was worse was that she tried to kill her own son by somehow sneaking up a spell in his recent clothes to give him human conditions, then synched Castiel on him using another powerful spell from the Book of the Damned.
John pointed at a pouting Gabriel. "As soon as that asshat learns his lesson not to feed children too much sweets, he can go talk to Jesse in Australia. In the meantime he already sent Crowley there to coax him in agreement. He'll call us about the kid later - seems that the King of Hell took an interest to Jesse's foster mother, who happens to be single." He pointed to the door. "Now go quickly find a job with your angel and come back with groceries - and don't you give me that look, boy! I know your angel can make money appear and disappear, so use those powers at your disposal."
Dean meets a child he wishes to save, then many years later he and his brother manage to stumble upon the same child. Can they save her?
John and Sam groaned in unison as Gabriel grinned at Dean. Castiel was internally evaluating himself as to why he felt dread when Dean started talking about a man he was attracted to.
"We're in Purgatory, you dumbass," Nikki grumbled, causing the others to giggle softly. "Do you not remember Crowley guiding us through the crack of rock from Hell?"
"Alright, so we've got decent clothes for my family for at least a month, now we just have to go looking for normal clothes for you - " Dean stopped speaking once he noticed his friend was gone. He turned around and quickly found him standing still by the window of a random jewelry store.
With the Winchester & Campbell luck, however, the plan always goes sideways and someone else is rescued.
"DAMMIT, SAMALAM! DON'T JUST START GETTING THOR ON ME - hey wait, how the hell do you have my brother's hammer?!"
Dean bit his lip and glanced at the wall, which went noticed by his father. "Late last night I heard a specific argument... adolescents were involved and I wanted to call their parents out on the CPS, but... Dad, I didn't want CPS to find us, too..." He trailed off and looked down sadly.
It was probably due to the fact that Crowley had to stay behind at the Bunker, though sadly he couldn't be in the Devil's Trap. (It was Dean's idea, much to Sam and John's reluctance.) The King of Hell didn't even want to leave the Bunker due to fact that his mother can never trace him in that location.
Crowley saw the liquid and clung onto Castiel, who long ago was no longer under a dog attack spell for Crowley's head. "I would very much like an alcoholic beverage and not water, thank you very much."
Claire watched with a slightly bruised face as the stranger (another handsome young man around her age who wears glasses... though he looked strangely familiar) pounded his fist into the drunk guy's face and tossed him out of the bedroom, slamming it shut after a few of what looked like the stranger's buddies caught the drunk guy in their arms. "And stay out! A person says no, then it's no!" He yelled at the door.
She quietly shook and folded herself in the corner with her arms wrapped around her knees. She controlled her breathing when she heard the young man around her age she just met today call out for her.
John &Nikita quickly search for the Yellow Eyed Demon together, now that they have a name. They find out that Sam is the key player in what happened with John's wife, and they hear word about the Colt. Right before they look for the Colt, John secretly attempts to adopt her and promises to God that he will do what it takes to keep her as his own child. Two villains from the future make certain that John would never get off sidetracked of Heaven's destined plan (because otherwise they would never have accomplished so much).
5. ....did you guys notice from last chapter? I snuck in a little bit of everything.... damn, which means I have to add new tags. Let me know if I left out anything in the tags.
Meanwhile, Sam spoke quietly on the phone in code words to Garth, the ex-hunter-turned-happy-family-werewolf. "Yes, for the last time, Garth, John is back in the business and alive." A middle aged lady who sat next to Sam slowly turned to him with wide eyes. Sam noticed and quickly explained with a smooth reply. "My eldest cousin in the family was in the witness protection program for... conducting some business... he's been pardoned and is now a private bounty hunter." The woman's eyes widened more and quickly minded her own business, slowly scooching away from him as she grabbed a magazine to read and focus on.
The man felt pride for the girl and reached out to gently rub her head. She leaned against the touch and purred playfully, causing him to bark out in laughter. He quickly quieted down and snickered along with her when the head librarian of the building marched over to shush and glare at him before returning back to her duties at the front desk.
Nikki glared at her Zanna. "Are you going to just stand there or help?!" She growled as she stalked towards him. He didn't bother feeling scared nor answer her - he was tasked to silently find possible pathways towards the Cage and happened to stand by one.
"Oh no, don't you finish that sentence!" John grumbled as he got up to get himself a sandwich and a beer. "Ain't no such thing as unicorns!" He hollered while retreating from the Library, earning a heartfelt laugh out of Sam.
Everyone had turned to look at Jack, who wrinkled his nose and explained his status as a time traveler and that he can never die. He could also travel in dimensions and believed in only aliens until he met his friend, Gabriel.
...he still wanted to protect the little girl from her family. He saw the rapidly aging look on her face as if she's already been through puberty except for her older sister. He could never forget her appearance... her black hair, tan skin, crescent moon-shaped eyes of a hazel color, and a small button nose.
Gabriel rolled his eyes. "Man, seriously? Okay, I'll get straight to the point." He turned to John as Sam started to drive on the empty road again. "Do you remember a nurse named Richard? What did he look like?"
After Crowley left, Castiel took a deep breath and braced himself as he slowly stepped into the kitchen. Dean grabbed his arm to stop him. "Cass, babe, what are you doing?!" He hissed frantically.
John's eyes widened. "Oh shit, I wasn't planning on telling you until after adopting Nikki..." He blurted out in a trailed off ramble.
John's eyes widened and his body turned quickly to where Nikita stood, and he wasn't surprised she was no longer standing there.
John looked at Sam and then Dean with a sad smile on his face. "Someone who deserved to be a part of our family, just as we deserve to be in hers." His face changed with a look of determination. "We have to look for her,
"Okay, Crowley. She was a victim of abuse. Maybe the cops figured it was an old fashioned spanking and some accidents that Bela got caught in? I mean, she always acted so spoiled and she sold her soul at a young age to you! So you could kill her parents!"
He overheard the small conversation happening from the kitchen and smiled softly as Castiel asked Dean how classes are. Dean had recently enrolled into online classes. He automatically got into MIT with his online test scores and had permission from the school to take classes online because of his ongoing business at work. John felt so proud when Dean first announced his education plans about a month ago during dinner one evening - he abruptly got up from his seat at the dining table and glomped his eldest son into a hug with Sam. Dean was finally applying himself in life without the thought of being only good for hunting.
"Okay, sorry to interrupt, Papa Winchester, but we have a crisis on our hands!" Gabriel interrupted while he flung his hands in the air. "Read the list!"
Dean blushed deeply at that grumbling remark while Sam gaped at the couple on the bed. He had forgotten that he and Cass had sex last night after a wonderful dinner.
Dean frowned. "What do you mean, 'in'? Just - oh..." He glanced at Nikki and Gabriel. The archangel tensed as he got the hint and wrapped his arm around Nikki in resignation. "...when is Jesse ready?"
Another was a regular human guy named Jack Harkness, who kept trying to flirt with him at the interview but knew what his boundaries where when he saw the customized wedding ring on Dean's finger. He flirted way less with him, but unfortunately for other workers and customers he flirted with all of them even more. Dean saw how good he was with quantum mechanics and mathematical theory that he decided to go to him during lunch breaks for homework he was given from online classes. He liked Jack the best during those times because Jack would never flirt with him while tutoring him.
"So far I managed to find here that he is the first pure demon on Earth and that he wasn't born human, which makes him an actual creature but of the unknown," The young girl read from a thick heavy textbook with a reference label on the spinal edge. Internally John glanced at how small the girl was in comparison to the huge dusty book on her lap. Since the hospital Nikita had been wearing John's old clothes that used to fit him, but they had been too big for her still, so before they left for Los Angeles he bought her cleaner clothes at a thrift store. He had her choose the clothes and was surprised to find the feminine parts of her purchases only being her undergarments. (He still can't think of how she was able to steal that reference book from the library without the cranky old librarian lady catching them.) "It says here in another chapter that Lucifer himself created him."
The boy simply winked. "Just call me your imaginary friend!" He called out as he disappeared. Before Nikita could grab the strange boy, a misty cloud covered the dark room and pushed her to fall against the leafy bed.
"He's technically my father in all but blood... name's Claire, by the way." She quickly introduced herself and furrowed her eyebrows at him. "He never mentioned having a son."
I'm adding two very special villains from the recent season of Supernatural, along with a tiny fairytale twist. ;)
Castiel quickly glanced at Gabriel by the doorway with a nonchalant reply. "Then my body wouldn't work out. It would be quite pudgy like Gabriel's." He ignored the indignant sound of "Hey!" coming from Gabriel.
Dean looked extremely shocked at the boy before the stress overtook him and his vision turned black.
Jesse peered into the Cage carefully, ignoring Lucifer's taunts as he checked Adam's body. His eyes widened in shock. "Um, Nikki?"
Sam sighed and leaned against the seat. "I know, but recently I helped Jess out at the pediatric ward for charity week at Stanford... it was in September. There was a 13 year old girl who had a broken left arm and bruises on her face and arms. I hid at the front door of her room because her parents were standing at the foot of the bed, hissing threats at her and blaming her for her older sister's coma state. I checked up her records and her sister is 22 in the floor above the pediatric floor of the hospital. She was in a coma due to alcohol poisoning and a car crash, which should have killed her. It didn't because she was in the passenger seat."
He sighed and leaned back in his seat, popping a Tootsie Roll into his mouth. "Hopefully the young fledgling is there once we arrive there, and that the witch didn't get to her first. You mentioned something about a backup spell that you two cooked up?"
Nikita scrambled off where she laid, which turned out to be a huge soft leaf folded as a bed, and frowned at the boy. "No... I was trying to kill you." She spoke ever so bluntly.
"What do you mean Ms. Yuson was checked out, but recently had to check back in - and by herself, no less?!" John barked at the doctor while dressed in a nice decent suit.
Sam gaped at his brother as Alex and Jack high fived each other. Gabriel was too busy feeling sad at potentially having no dessert.
John turned to his youngest son and winked. "You heard your brother. Go pack and we'll be going to Salvation, Iowa." And with that, he fled down the stairs and went to pack up his own stuff.
3. Sometimes I wonder if I should make a Gabriel/Sam tag thing going, but I don't think I should for this story.
"There ya go!" Dean exclaimed while patting lightly on Castiel's chest. Castiel glanced down at his attire and beamed a smile at Dean with gratitude. They had a moment to stare at each other and not once have either of them felt it was awkward.
The hunter shook his head in reply and quickly made breakfast for him and the angel. "Nah, he's not a pain in my ass. It's actually a compliment to have one of my favorite TV heroes come to life actually work at my shop AND ogle my ass every now and then." He grinned and winked at Castiel, to which the angel chuckled in reply and glanced casually at Dean's backside.
"Seriously, what are you?" Nikita asked again while she glared at the young boy cooking for her. "You can touch things, but people can't see you. I'm passing it off as my imaginary friend of sorts, but you don't seem less human often.
Nikita nodded and flipped through a few pages until she found where she bookmarked Azazel's name of origin. "But get this," and as she paused reading before starting to read aloud, the elder man couldn't help but flinch at the last time he remembered hearing that similar phrase - about a week before his younger son, Sam, walked out on him and Dean to go to Stanford, "...Azazel is an angel name, and technically a fallen angel because Lucifer himself was the fallen archangel."
Jesse turned to Nikki with a grave expression on his face. "If Adam is indeed in Heaven, which soul do we rescue to get out of Hell with Bela?"
Dean didn't like the heat and Sam hated that he had to leave his previous school. But, they both had to admit that the past two days were filled with content fun of riding horses and having an all-you-can-eat buffet.
This takes place on St. Patrick's Day, meaning something bad is going down, with the Winchester and Campbell luck.
Eventually they ended up at the place where Benny said the portal was. Nikki took her angel blade and cut her left forearm deeply, barely hissing softly with a quiet grunt. Everyone else looked at each other without her knowing and they silently agreed to protect her from her biological family for the pain that she got used to at a very young age. (It didn't matter to them that she was 15 years old - she could be 30 years old and they would still worry with how young and innocent she appeared to be.)
The elderly Winchester perked up at the questionable offer. "That would be splendid! Excellent work, Nikki." He reached over in his duffel bag to pull out a thick leather book with worn out pages. "Which reminds me - happy birthday, kiddo."
Take a glimpse into Castiel and Dean's work lives during the daytime! (And a little show of their parenting skills.)
It seemed that John wanted to dodge the Heavenly Father issue completely (especially with Gabriel's quick mental breakdown a couple of hours earlier) because he quickly changed subjects. "What did you enjoy about humanity the most, then?"
"Brother, we sure fooled the humans, did we not?" Lucifer smiled and high-fived Adam's open pale palm. Adam's body was still as a statue.
, where people associated with the Doctor or Torchwood can study all of time travel and alternative dimensions in numerous universes (3 floors - has wide basement for scientific experiments); a yellow building with a Renaissance architectural structure for the
Castiel stared at Claire's eyes and pout, then nodded quickly. "Okay. We have much space to fill here, anyway. Plus I can fulfill my vow to take care of you and watch over you any chance I get when you start your classes."
That's right! Gabriel has brought John Winchester back from Heaven! Plus with his additional memories that got wiped away in the time travel! :)
Later on, while he watched his young partner skim and search through the heavy thick worn out book of spells in the backseat, John internally planned how he would bring the conversation of adopting Nikita. For the past few weeks he first quickly found how to kill Azazel, then spent the rest of his time calling up his old army buddies connected to the government (who figured out that monsters are real - he was surprised about learning about Area 51's existence). He was able to play a few strings and pull them toward his favor. If he could get the Yuson family arrested for child abuse and put Nikita's elder sister in a psychiatric ward to help her, then John could easily adopt Nikita legally if he were to work under the government.
Jesse turned towards the vampire and the saved soul. "It's a long story to catch up on," he informed them.
I wouldn't have survived," Nikita voiced aloud her pensive thoughts as she glanced over at John. "Sometimes I dream of what could have happened if your family wasn't around mine in specific details... it gets really ugly and lonely..." Her voice drifted off to a quiet whisper and she looked down at her feet barely hitting the floor carpeting of the truck.
Dean slowly nodded his head. "Okay, makes sense." He went back to glaring at Gabriel. "Now explain how you managed to escape Lucifer's grasp and how you were in cahoots with Metatron."
Dean growled as he wiped his eyes from crust. "Dude, I fucking hate witches. I wouldn't be surprised. What are you doing in a cabin? Does it have anything to do with the Yellow Eyed Demon?" He mumbled over the phone.
Castiel groaned and glanced at his watch that he recently received from Dean as a small token of a 'welcome back to somewhat sanity in the Winchester World' gift. It was silver and the circle with the numbers on it was as blue as his vessel's eyes. He read the time and sighed.
He growled as he stomped out of the hospital room and glared at all the nurses at the pediatric ward. "Who's the nurse in charge of this patient?!" He barked, pulling his marine instincts to surface.
"I heard about your bet and I'm still in..."  Max whispered quickly to Sam as Claire ran over to them after climbing out of Castiel's car as quickly as she could.
It indeed has been taking me so long to update. To anyone who is reading this or have been following up to this, I apologize for the slow updates. Hope you like this story. :)
Rowena and Metatron crashed on their backs back into an abandoned wine warehouse in Ireland. They both groaned in unison as they slowly climbed at the numerous wine boxes.
"I have Claire's clothes in my trunk. She wants to be with her family." Jody bluntly spoke with a small smile on her face. "She's a joy to have around, but it's hard for her to be disciplined unless I mention either of you Winchesters or Cas here."
Both Sam and Gabriel looked at Castiel in surprise. They both thought it would have been Dean to ask the angel.
"Three," Dean spoke, "- you managed to bewitch a professor's inner slut to have her way with Sammy in public, causing both adults to get arrested for public indecency."
His staff that he hired were few but of trustworthy quality. One was an angel in a human male vessel, whose name was Zuriel and he appreciated learning about the beauty of cars and how to fix the engines to make them work. Zuriel insisted on Dean using his pay to save up for Nikita's college fund, to which Dean reluctantly agreed (only because the topic of family was brought up - if it hadn't Zuriel would have ended up with monthly pay). Dean found it funny that Zuriel also had a fascination with belts, because he kept wearing a different color or style of belt every single day. (It helped that Dean decided to not have uniforms for his employees.)
. It was decided that Ben and Claire transfer quickly to Gabriel's new university where Castiel worked called
Nikki took a deep breath and closed her eyes deeply, concentrating on Gabriel's celestial power while holding hands with said archangel. Her family watched her carefully, wary yet in awe of how the shadows behind her formed a grand set of nicely feather-shaped wings. Before this moment and in between life events since she came to the Bunker, Nikki had been training silently with Gabriel to access any gift that Gabriel's father had given her.
Meanwhile John finally found the right door to Nikita's room and raised his fist to knock on the door. Before his knuckles could meet the wooden door, he heard her speak to someone but was given no reply. It sounded as if Nikita was having a conversation with thin air.
Said creature nervously chuckled and slowly backed away from the gun that was pointing at him at the moment, "Um... I was just shocked, that's all..."
"They're helping me with some research for the Men of Letters. So anyways, like they said, you don't really have to make all these things. You can zap them into existence like Gabriel does."
The old gruffy man stared at his son's back and wondered how he turned him into a literal 'Uncle Sam' material for education.
The Winchesters and Crowley turned to Castiel. "You did what?! Why didn't you tell us, Cas?!" Dean yelled.
, where wizards of all genders can be all called wizards and not be stereotyped as they learn advanced magic and form the first American Ministry of Magic (outside it appeared to have 5 floors but inside it has 14 floors - has basement floor where there's a wall and fireplace to get to a new wizard alley in America called Trickster Lane, courtesy of Gabriel); a blue-green building with a Victorian architectural structure for the
"Or he could just magic it up, like we do!" Sully chimed in as he appeared with Weems. Only Alex and Jack jumped up at the sudden apparition. Everyone else remained unfazed.
John gently patted her head and coaxed her gaze to look up at him. "Hey, you listen to me, kid. I still don't trust divine and fate unless I see it in front of me. However, I do believe it is a miracle that I found you, so I'm not looking to put a gift horse in the mouth. You with me `til the end, Nikki?"
With hesitance, he pressed speed dial #2 and waited for his elder son to pick up. He only had to wait for two rings.
Sam threw a bitch face at him as one of the neighbors on the same floor of the dormitory building overheard Gabriel's exclamation and looked at him funny before scoffing and retreating with a box in her arms.
Bela hesitantly nodded and grabbed the angel blade offered to her and cut her own arm deep, also not making any noises. Benny turned towards the other male beings and they silently agreed to also watch out for her safety.
She only knew one spell and wasn't sure what the downside was yet, but she had to try to make it. Because this certain spell had an upside to her favor.
Gabriel gave the tall Winchester a sneer and playfully pouted as he crossed his arms. "You'll truly win that bet if after all our advances are done and they
Bela frowned as she narrowed her eyes more, her arms folding across her chest. "John Winchester died before I ever met the Winchester brothers."
"I figured there were two females, sir." He then proceeded to tell his father his witness statement of what happened.
Instead it had changed into a clean office with the theme that somehow fit God's look. (If only the other angels knew who God decided to take as a vessel... Gabriel was the only one to know where God was before he got captured by fucking Metatron.)
Dean picked up the document while Castiel looked over his shoulder. "This is Dad's will, before he forgot he even wrote one." He whispered in amazement as he read on. "It says here that if he ever dies I get full parental rights... he used one of my working aliases to give his guardianship to if he ever passes on..."
Sam had pulled out his laptop and WiFi hardrive, to which John verbally wondered where the fuck they came from and how did he miss the turns of technology, and looked up Abbie Harker. He nodded solemnly to Dean, who was driving while gritting his teeth due to several emotions going through him.
John blinked and scratched his head. "Hmm... actually, yeah, I remember a nurse with that name... he helped Nikki and had this Victoria Secret umbrella..." He trailed off and narrowed his eyes at the archangel as he suddenly remembered who Gabriel reminded him of. "
John snorted and nodded. "Tell me bout it. You take care of yourself, ya hear?" He stuck out a hand to shake Richard's and watched him walk away with the folded umbrella and wheelchair.
Sam grimaced and stepped up beside Dean. "Remember what? That we have a younger half brother named Adam? That right now he could have graduated from college, so when he was born it had only been a few years after the fire and Mom's death?" He growled deeply.
"Two," Castiel stated with a dead calm to his deep voice. "- you threw a party that grew alarmingly fast in size population that it reached its maximum and the neighbors had to call in complaints."
Dean's face brightened at the prospect of staying away from the hot scorching sun of the Californian desert. Sam, on the other hand, sulked.
Castiel was not only the school dean for the Mythology & Religious Department, but he also started teaching human classes on the subjects of Bible Studies With Recent Evidence  and Evidence Supporting Fable Myths.
"But - " John started to respond, but luckily for Sam's mild temper still for his father, the dentist walked out of her office and smiled kindly at them. "Hello, my name is Doctor Granger and I'm here to examine Miss Nikita Yuson-Clapton?" She greeted herself and asked about her patient at the same time.
Castiel shook his head in reply and John grinned back at him. "Great! I know a place where we can celebrate the engagement!" He cheered, causing Castiel to smile softly.
"Sammy, let it go. You said it yourself - Sulli told you about how new Zannas work and how they don't even have a name yet. Besides, we've found out before that they aren't bad creatures," Dean countered as he backed up from the vehicle to close the hood. "Besides, this kid seems to be like a special Zanna - almost like a genie! Make three wishes and he'll be free!" He chuckled softly, earning a resigned grunt from his brother.
Curious, Dean got up from his own bed and moved towards the wall slowly. He leaned in and lightly pressed his ear against the icky yellow wallpaper.
The teens shrugged their shoulders before grabbing each other's hands and quickly disappeared through flight.
Dean glanced at his surroundings and sighed. His father assumed that the saddle ranch resort had a decent hotel and paid for his sons to have a fun vacation while he hunted an honored spirit.
After Claire called Castiel and Dean and told them where her dorm room was exactly, she remained in the back end of her closet room, quietly sniffling while rubbing the tears from her eyes.
John Winchester finished writing his notes out of special stationary from Staples (he splurged rarely for his interests) and neatly sealed the 3 pages of notes in a fancy envelope with an embossed seal. He grinned at his neat work and got out of his chair to look for one of the angels hanging around the Bunker.
Also, please wait for upcoming chapter with more notes over why I'm late on uploading. This chapter was supposed to be posted on March 7th, 2016.
Castiel could tell when Dean's mind snapped at a sudden memory, and the next thing he knew, Dean ran down the spiral staircase and sprinted towards his room. "We're gonna pack and leave in five minutes!"
While the Piper Boy wandered around the Bunker playing with his flute (she finally figured out what the instrument was), Nikita quickly combed the category file cabinets for a library card. She grew frustrated and sighed when she couldn't find anything and slammed the cabinet shelf shut.
He'll call his sons up after they park at his reserved cabin under a false name, which was about 2 miles away. They'll be a witness to Nikita's adoption at the local court hall in Salvation, Iowa. Afterwards, they'll deal with Azazel, then they'll finally settle in Windom, Minnesota.
A few weeks ago, Gabriel found a breakthrough in his own personal cage designed by Metatron and tried breaking through the thick paper door, but it seemed to have thick layers. He looked around his mirage of a cage and growled, pushing forward with all six of his wings. After the 124th push with his shoulder, he finally fell through the mirage and back into what used to be Metatron's office.
he thought to himself then perked up at a sudden thought. He turned towards Gabriel, who already climbed into the backseat and started eating a chocolate covered pretzel. "Gabriel! Can't you stop them from being offtrack? Tell them that I don't have to go to school anymore so we can go find the poor girl!"
"Believe it or not, this young girl was the one who inspired Sam with his decision to get a job interview for CPS as a lawyer. They recently added a new position available to help the foster children more with their cases, along with the position I wanted to add for Jessica. I happen to work the CPS on the weekends with my husband - he's the one who's in charge of the CPS building in Palo Alto."
Sam perked up at the mention of staying in school for a semester. Dean pouted at the idea of staying cooped up indoors and whined. "Oh come on!"
"...when are we going to tell them that we kissed on New Years, confessed each other's feelings on your birthday, and got officially engaged on Valentine's Day?"
Dean slightly smiled, but it was so small that it was barely even seen. Sam caught on to it and shook his head, smiling. "Dean, we're not gonna make a big deal about this. You can date who you want to date - "
Dean was at the Bunker with his father after a long day at work when he got a call from his cellphone. He paused from their conversation about the shy wizard working at his shop to answer the call. "Hello? ...Claire? What's wrong, honey?"
The angel furrowed his eyebrows at Dean. "Why can't Gabriel use his grace to make clothes appear for your father and sister?"
Nikita couldn't help but crack a smile at that, despite her chapped lips starting to bleed. John noticed this and cursed softly, taking out a clean handkerchief from his pocket and pressing it damply against her lips. "Do you need some water?"
The eldest Winchester ran down the small stone steps and cautiously slid over to the bed as soon as he saw the girl he was looking for. "Nikki!" He shouted as he quickly gathered her in his arms. It took a brief moment because of how heavy the frozen young girl was with her frozen skin. He looked on in dismay at her pale blue lips.
Jesse shook his head. "That's the thing - Adam's soul seems to have never resided in his body during the torture of the Pit."
"Hey, Cas... have you ever thought about making pie for Dean? I bet he'd appreciate it after a long day of work." He suggested to the angel.
Nikki scratched her nose and turned towards her father figure. "Pops, how did you make reservations? It probably wasn't cheap..."
" - AND you need to be married. With both of you actually having god-to-honest jobs." Sam finished with a slight smirk on his face, watching the smile fall and turn into shock and dismay.
When he heard the door open and close, Dean decided to peek out the window, without breaking the salt lines, to watch who the soft spoken voice was. His eyes widened in shock at a (thankfully unscarred) young girl who looked to be about 4 years old holding the (thankfully clean) knife carefully with a napkin and climbing down the stairs to throw the knife away in the trashcan. Dean also noticed how the little girl's clothing was more second-handed than his own and Sammy's clothes. Her clothes looked too loose on her body and were slightly torn at the seams.
Dean opened his mouth but closed it slowly hearing the words repeat again in his mind. He glanced at his father and his skin paled. John noticed this and looked over at his eldest son with caring eyes.
Now in the early spring, however, he frantically searched for the young Asian girl in the fancy hotel room. "Nikki! Come on out, darling!" He looked underneath both beds in the room and in the closet.
Dean frowned in confusion, but apparently Crowley thought it was a good idea. "Yes, Moose, they can sneak through Purgatory to raise Bela from the grave, and at the same time their powers will not be severely depleted in their young bodies."
"Shhh! People will think you're weird for talking to nobody! You're the only one that sees me." The young boy informed her as he slowly let go of her and stayed at his side of the desk.
Sam carried the last of Claire's furniture with Gabriel into her new dorm room. They placed the couch onto the soft large pink rug in the living room. With via angel air, they were able to move stuff quickly to Claire's dorm room. Sam looked around the place and smiled sadly as it brought him several memories of when he first moved into Stanford. He internally wished for Claire to have a better experience than he had in the end.
"...yeah, well, we should have known. We should have investigated further in her case before calling her a bitch and dismissing it." Dean grumbled and rubbed his forehead. The sooner they get to Salvation, Iowa, the sooner that they could spring Bela out so he could apologize for an eternity.
The tall Winchester went back to the phone call. "Sorry, in public so my conversation has to be clipped... no, Garth, you have a family to help provide and take care of! ... really? Congrats on the pups!" John and Nikita overheard the conversation and gravitated towards the tall man's form on a plastic chair in the waiting room. "Wow, five already? All the more reason to stay home with your wife and tend to her... yeah, I'll be sure to let you know if you're needed. I have you under Emergency Contacts... great! I'll need that list to tell the other trusted - er, community members... and yes, I know, we'll find a team of people to take care of Chicago. Okay, bye Garth!" He ended the call and glanced up at his family. "Garth Fitzgerald IV says hi and that his wife recently gave birth to five puppies!" The woman earlier looked absolutely horrified with the conversation and darted out of the room.
"So you know she's been calling for help with no one replying to her when there was a drunk young man who beat her and tried to have his way with her?" Dean asked in a deadpanned tone. Gabriel's eyes widened at that with rage.
"I believe I have heard of that law passing. I find it ridiculous how humans have decided over the years to restrict genders when it comes to relationships. God is indifferent to sexual orientation, as am I."
"Yes, but he says he'll think about it. He's been making me try to persuade him by having me get along with his foster mother. Angie seems alright so far..."
Dean frowned at him and opened his mouth to argue, but Castiel interrupted him and went on. "You have a knack for engineering and it would be a waste to not use your talents into a great career, had you not gone into hunting."
She heard the red headed woman speak, apparently Rowena, and evaluated her as an Irish witch. "You wee little man - you're human now! Of course you can't sense her! She's probably hiding somewhere in the cabin. Go find her while I finish up these ingredients here and wipe out this young man's memories with his sons' as well."
Because Gabriel quickly gets bored and annoying, Castiel decided to make him the school president, which excited the archangel. (In the end Castiel reluctantly let Gabriel decorate one building in a slight Hogwarts style.
The Winchesters and the angels find the cabin where Nikita is kept in and find a way to unfreeze her from her own spell. The young girl is torn over what she wants to do with her life while the quest for Jessie and Bela is put in the back burner for now. The Winchesters happily take her in, though there are some catches to give her the life she deserves.
The doctor nodded and let John walk over to her room as he left to attend to other patient's care. He slowly walked inside the room and stared at the young girl, who his eldest son saw many years ago, lying in a bed looking sickly pale and red at the same time with her tan skin. Her lips were chapped and more pale than the rest of her body.
Gabriel chuckled nervously before popping out the unopened umbrella in his grasp. "Surprise? Also... one of the Weeping Angels may have slipped through this alternate dimension we live in and transported the Nephilim from one family to another, thus she became Nikita Yuson." He sighed with a bit of a relief. "At least it wasn't Dad's fault this time, huh, Cassie?"
On the way home, Dean slowly parked at the front curb of an abandoned junkyard and climbed out of the car with Castiel. He walked toward the vacant lot and scanned the perimeter. "Maybe we could mojo a bit of money to buy this lot and turn it into a garage shop? It could be like Bobby's new legacy or somethin'." Dean suggested with a light shrug.
The runes suddenly glowed blue and blasted a frostful of air, knocking Nikita out on the bed unconscious. The blue frost of air also blasted a startled Rowena and Metatron back out the cabin and disappear into nonexistence, pushing them back in their own timeline. John, on the other hand, crashed out onto the grass outside of the cabin by his truck and woke up. He groggily got up with a groan and glanced at his truck.
Dean laughed carelessly and pulled the angel close against his body. Yeah, life was now good for the hunter so far.
It was then that Lucifer can be heard cackling inside the Cage. The hybrid humans turned to the manifestation of Sam's body grinning at them behind bars. His eyes glowed bright red, showing his status as Lucifer. Because Sam was Lucifer's true vessel, they could see Lucifer's grace form to look like Sam, which made them feel slightly ill at the sight.
The doctor continued on with a grimace on his facial features. "The nurses kept bringing food for the patient, which angered the mother because she thought that Nikita needed to be taught a lesson. Instead, she sent the food that was supposed to be for her to her older sister, Mary Anne, who's currently in a coma and was transported to the medical facility in Los Angeles... apparently we weren't good enough to treat their precious daughter." Now John could understand why the doctor could be holding a grudge against the Yuson family. "Nikita's father was able to sneak in the food that was for her, but it's usually just the soup and crackers. The rest of the food was kept to him and his wife in Mary Anne's room."
Castiel turned towards his best friend. "Dean, your father stated that I should use my grace for monetary use, correct?"
The teacher sputtered before stalking off the classroom. The principal muttered "I never liked her..." before smiling at the student Mrs. Halpern was glaring at. "Your answer was correct, by the way. I apologize on her behalf. Class is dismissed everyone!"
John decided to cut off the supposed conversation by proceeding to knock on the door. "Nikki, I'm coming in! Rise and shine, darling!"
He frowned as he overheard his brother calling out for Sulli's blood and decided to ignore it, until he overheard Sulli calling out for Nikki's help with her own Zanna -
"Exactly!" Gabriel announced as he grinned at everyone. "We are now going to start Project Destiel! I want everyone to split into two teams and I will be leader for the two muttonheads to finally get together!"
Gabriel pouted but eventually relented. "So that's what happened to the Nephilim, and here we are, searching for her. You're welcome, by the way, of getting rid of the Weeping Angel who did this to her, as well as terrorizing the staff at the hospital near Stanford. Jack and I had a blast sending them all to the universe where majority of the Weeping Angels reside in."
Sam gaped at Dean and furrowed his eyebrows at his father, who was now grinning with a gleam of hope in his eye. "Dad?"
"Four," Castiel raised an eyebrow at Gabriel. "I don't know how you put a rocket launcher on the roof of this building without people noticing, but it was there and people noticed."
".....where's Dad? DAAAAAAD! DEAN! CAS! THEY'RE WRESTLING IN THE LIBRARY!" Dean would have left the fight alone if his foster sister wasn't around, but now that it seems as if she's at the crossfire of these troublemakers...
Dean slammed the brakes, yet swiftly parked to the side of the street to let others pass him by. He turned around just as swiftly to the archangel currently eating cheesecake. "You know where he is?"
Dean chuckled and rolled his eyes as he hugged his family (+ Jody included) first before helping both odd beings down from the truck. Right as he guided all of them to the shop building, a 1978 tan colored Lincoln Continental Mark V rolled into the shop grounds beside John's black colored 2008 Dodge Ram. Crowley and Sam groaned at the sight. "Jesus, not that pimp ride again!" The King of Hell complained and stalked into the shop. Max, walking towards the group, easily dodged the demon and stood beside Sam.
Castiel raised an eyebrow at the brothers after taking a glance at the birth certificate. He shook his head and left to go find his brother and John Winchester.
Benny's eyes widened and he shook his head, backing away from him. "I can't... the hunger... it'll be too much again..."
"Dean... it's okay. You don't need to be labeled as anything," he spoke in a calm voice, something Sam rarely ever heard of in his earliest memories of his father. "You can be with whoever you want to be, just so long as they don't break your heart. That's where I step in."
He ran in there and froze at Nikita hiding in the large closet that sits across from the dressing table area. She was crouched in a fetal position with her arms covering her legs while her head gets buried in her own embrace.
Claire let out a shout before running down the stairs to greet the others, even those she didn't know because she was that excited. Dean turned to Jody, who walked in and closed the door to the Bunker a moment ago. "She's that excited, huh?"
"That man would be Sam and Dean's father, John Winchester," Castiel responded. "The young girl behind him is Nikita Yuson-Clapton, a Nephilim who is currently 14 years old."
He saw the way Castiel stared in awe at the different examples of customized rings by the window display. Somehow this sight before him prompted something in his mind because he walked back to Castiel and grabbed his hand. "Come on, let's go look into this store. We're officially married, remember?" He grinned at the angel as he said this.
"Okay, the plan is still on. Bela is going to be saved, but who do we have next to save? I know no one from Hell."
Sam looked across the table at his father with a sad smile on his face. "Did she say how is she? When Dean and I went to Heaven, Ash couldn't find mom."
"I think that Dean especially would appreciate the lack of magic in his life, despite it being useful in his favor," Castiel began to explain. "He has told me numerous times to walk instead of zap if I want to go from one room to the next room so I would prevent being lazy. Dean likes to feel useful and be around people who can be useful in one way or the other." He straightened his posture and nodded. "I shall go help John pack for supplies needed if this Nikita person is still alive." He sauntered over to the kitchen.
John stared at Sam's new upgrade on his laptop. "This is kinda moving too fast for me... how do you use the cursor on this doo-hickey?"
"...so you were human twice, though the recent time was a full blown crash course in humanity for ya, before you got grace in you."
"Yeah, and with the whole family living together now, thanks to Gabriel and Uncle Sam, I think you should have this break. He's worth the risk."
The retired hunter smiled at his fiancee and lightly leaned in to kiss him on the cheek. "Then it's their problem, not ours."
John closed the book and placed it on the table with his ink pen once Dean called him over for breakfast. He smiled.
The Piper Boy whistled as he surveyed the cambion and nephilim's work with the dead demons. "Wow, you two are good."
He feels content to have blessings from both Winchester parents. He straightened his back and glanced at John once more to speak. "Please pray directly to me once everyone is ready to go out and celebrate." With that, he flexed his invisible wings and flew straight to Heaven to deliver John's love notes to Mary.
Both Sam and Claire rolled their eyes as they continued on with their tasks of the classic way to protect a room in hunter style.
Dean raised an eyebrow while rubbing his arms. No one commented when Castiel reached over and placed a hand on Dean's lower back to emulate warmth in his body. "...Dad? What are you looking for?"
There were several noises of struggle and sobbing from the voice he heard before, which he could now distinguish as a teenager.
2. Does Claire seem a bit more mature than you'd imagine? I wanted to capture her learning the hard life and adapting an evaluated look into her memories to gain a mature perspective for college.
"You are indeed correct, Ms. Yuson." Castiel spoke up with a soft tender smile for her. "This is the year 2015."
Dean perked up from his seat. "Like that case with the fairytale stories due to the evil stepmother, remember Sammy? Snow White passed away peacefully when her father finally learned the truth about his recent late wife and kissed his daughter's forehead." He wrinkled his nose. "Do you think Nikita's body vessel will age once we get to the cabins?"
The boy was thrown off of his playing and coughed, sputtering as he tried to get rid of the salty particles on him. Nikita noticed he wasn't burning. "What the hell, lady?! You trying to blind me?!" He yelled at her.
"...Gabe, are you actually insinuating that you and Cas were raised by the Devil at one point in your lives?" Sam slowly asked.
Sam threw an exasperated look at Gabriel's direction. "Do you remember moments ago when you tried that with Nikita? The poor girl had to get a root canal because of you!"
John smacked his forehead with his palm as he remembered. "Fuck! Of course! I'll text you coordinates - I know how to defeat the demon." Without another word, he hung up the call and glanced once more at the cabin he vaguely remembered being in before hopping into the truck and driving off. At the moment, his mind was focused on the Yellow Eyed Demon.
"...seriously, I'm nine years gone on Earth and so much shit like this is makin' me think I'm in Back To The Future."
Sam frowned and glanced at the windows and door that was frozen shut. "I think maybe you might want to rethink that idea, Dad." He calmly suggested while pulling his jacket on from the car.
Everyone in the car stared at him with incredulous looks, except for Sam, who was too busy trying to drive in the dark night... or daylight. One could never know with the Darkness spreading around the world.
"Sam already has a job - researching for hunts and being your lawyer." John spoke calmly as he finished the last of the documents and gave them all to Sam, who looked smug. "From now on he's Sam Wesson who graduated at Standford, and opened up his own independent practice law firm for hunters in the U.S. Congratulations, son. You're your brother's top client."
It was John's turn to snort and guffaw as he looked through the internet browser for the nearest and most reliable dentistry in Lebanon. "Yeah, right, and unicorns do exist."
See what I did there? I added Dr. Who/Torchwood character as a tiny crossover. May or may not add a tiny few chapters on either fandom crossover, but I won't tag it as such (as I'm not sure when I'll write it or if I write it) because the story is mainly Supernatural-based.
When he turned to watch Jesse scan the numerous cavern hallways surrounding them, the Zanna teen blushed slightly seeing how well-toned the cambion's arms were with the sleeveless dark blue shirt and tight denim-cut jeans, paired with leather boots and wings that have sharp talons at every corner point. Jesse's hair had the short beach-surfer hair look going on for him, and before he could analyze on the slight freckles on his face he heard someone clear their throat and turned in embarrassment at Nikki's deadpan stare.
Crowley sighed into the phone. "The boy won't stop surfing, though I could see he uses his powers to draw the waves to him and keep all the sea monsters away. He really likes it here."
Sam shrugged and groggily headed to the bathroom. Dean grabbed his phone and pressed speed dial. He was surprised when his father did pick up. "Dad? Are you okay?"
Crowley sighed. "These bloody Winchesters fucking have a one-track mind. They don't even realize that we can just either pop new clothing out of nowhere or give ourselves one touch or snap - and presto! We're clean as a whistle."
The archangel stopped filing his nails. "Jesse's foster mom? Did she sell her soul at any point in her life?"
Castiel shrugged. "She was probably cold due to the wind. It is the winter time still and her nipples had hardened underneath her tank top."
Sam shook his head. "That's impossible! There's no way that Rowena and Metatron were here that day!" Gabriel turned to him with a raised eyebrow. "Are you kidding? This makes so much more sense now! Time travel does exist - hell, you guys have tried to change your father and mother's pasts before! Twice, I may add!"
"Rowena, I can't seem to sense her in the cabin! I think she probably jumped out the window in this room!" She heard the weird short man with a beard call, apparently named Metatron, out to the red headed woman and a floorboard creak nearby. She controlled her breathing intake - she was able to learn that skill early on in her childhood.
The archangel suddenly heard a ping from his cellphone, indicating a text message. He looked over his phone to open the message and his eyes widened dramatically.
Claire scrunched up her face as she stared at a plate with a piece of fried meat with melted cheese on top. "What is
"So long as you have my approval." John interrupted. "If you're interested in someone I have to check them out in case they have other motives."
John had growled and managed to rib a new one at Gabriel's disposal, tossing him into a ring of holy water fire after he was done yelling.
Sam nodded. "You know, I think I remember this girl at this hospital... Jess used to always intern there for the summer and I would often visit. This was taken during the summer before Jess died..." Sam trailed off and looked down at Dean funny. "Since when do you analyze genetic structure on people?" His eyes widened in horror. "Oh no,
In three split seconds, the tallest Winchester stalked into the room with a determined gleam in his eyes. He moved towards his foster sister and grabbed her by the waist, hoisting her up like a measly sack of potatoes. He turned around to walk back out of the room. "You will go to school. I will hear no bickering. You have a very bright future ahead of you and no one will hurt you because we'll hurt them if they ever even think about it." Sam stated with a deadly calm voice as he carried Nikita to the shower stalls.
Upon hearing Dean shout just now, Gabriel stopped eating and looked up with a shimmer of hope and dread. John dropped what he was doing and looked up, saw his sons, and smiled widely with sudden tears in his eyes. "My boys...!" He ran faster than Gabriel, who toppled over the table and tripped with one of his cakes, and ran up the stairs. He stopped just in front of Dean, who quickly pulled a gun on him. John smiled sadly and quickly pulled a silver knife out to cut the side of his arm to show he wasn't a shapeshifter, and then he pulled out a bottle that labeled Holy Water and drank from it, then splashed it on his eldest son.
She silently gasped as she heard the red headed woman and bearded man enter the cabin, but luckily she and John earlier prepped her secret room (just in case things happen and she has to hide) with wards so nothing supernatural could detect them. Despite John not believing in angels still, he reluctantly helped paint angel warding sigils just in case.
No one talked about how John shed silent tears for a few silent minutes. They let him keep his pride for a while and let him speak when he wants to.
John looked up at the question and turned to Nikita, who sat beside him in the library. They both sat in front of the computer looking through old scanned newspaper articles of fires. During the trip to the library John gave a crash course on the supernatural creatures in the world. He was slightly alarmed to find Nikita smiling in response when he asked earlier if she was afraid of him now. This quickly led to him teaching her how to research spirits or other strange occurrences.
"Who's gonna pick that up?" John calmly asked as he calmly walked in from the front door of the Bunker.
John and Nikita looked over at the rest of the guys in confusion. Dean ignored everyone as he ran up the stairs to open the door. Seeing how he had his hand still eloped with Castiel's, he managed to drag him over to the door. The angel didn't seem to mind being lead anywhere.
Sam shook his head. "Wait a minute! We have a bigger issue here - what are you doing here, Dad?! You're supposed to be in Heaven with Mom!" He shouted indignantly.
Still with suspicion, Sam nodded and hesitantly moved to where he remembered pulling the book off the shelf to check once. He flipped the pages over for the specific page and gave the book to his sister to see. "Mine named Sully visited me with help for a case. They're naturally nice to people, especially children, and are like djinn fairies who act like spirit guides for the children to their destined path happily." He folded his arms across his chest and leaned against one of the bookshelves. "Again I ask, why are you looking for information about Zanna? Did... did one look for you?"
Once John arrived in Los Angeles, he noticed Nikita fidgeting in her seat beside him. "What's wrong, kiddo? You have to use the restroom?"
Dean pointed at the girl in the photos. "I remember you showing me this. Her genetic structure made me remember her back in California City when she was a tiny girl."
Castiel and Dean Winchester, dressed in regular working outfits but nonetheless still the scary beings that they were.
"I won't! I promise!" The now 14-year-old girl beamed and jumped off her bed to crush John into a warm hug while shouting by his ear. "Thank you, thank you! This is the best gift that anyone has ever given me! I'll treasure this book as long as I live!"
Ben shook his head and hugged Dean tightly as well. "I didn't know either, but I found out after I graduated from high school. Mom and I suddenly remembered who you were but I was still okay with it. She, on the other hand, didn't want to be anywhere near you." He pulled away slightly to look at his dad and how well he aged from the last time he saw him. "She and I had a falling out and.... I wanted to find you so bad, so I came to where it all started for you..."
Metatron stopped complaining and slowly smiled the same way. "You're right! Maybe the brat's power backlashed on her, considering I don't feel her power right now."
Before Dean could sit up from his spot on the bed, Sam burst through the open door of his bedroom. "DEAN! Sulli was trying to - WAIT WHAT IS THIS?! OH MY GOD!"
The taller Winchester's eyes widened as he slowly pulled out and examined each document. "These are official copies of records stating that Dad is the sole guardian Nikita Yuson... and all evidence that points to the girl's existence." Sam gave Dean and Castiel the puppy look (the one where he shows he feels bad). "I can't believe we forgot her..."
Meanwhile please do enjoy this chapter. I hope the story flow sorta makes sense. I'm about to make it weirder in the next chapter. :p
The teacher frowned at the board and whipped her head around to glare at the girl. "Your answer is wrong!" She shouted. "Detention for causing disruption to my classroom - "
Everyone had just settled in from eating out at the fancy dinner to celebrate the engagement. St. Patrick's Day was almost over, and last they heard from Garth, the leprechaun case was taken care of in the next state over, so nothing should have been happening.
Castiel nodded in reply and tilted his head slightly in thought. "However I do wish that you told me you had plans of coming here for an education from an accredited university. My brother, Gabriel, had created one to give me my new position as a university dean, though Dean & I had to make sure he was not going to replicate Hogwarts." He suddenly had that self-pride look on his face. "I now know the reference to that. But I'd like to watch the movies instead of relying from Metatron's quick download of literature into my brain."
All three people glared at the Piper Boy, who frantically surveyed his surroundings. He winced at feeling the rougher ground of nature under his bare feet.
"From what was I heard of her last admittance to this ward, Nikita's parents persuaded the staff to ignore medical treatment other than needing the left arm to be treated. I overheard the other nurses gossiping that her mother talked about buying more concealer makeup to get rid of the bruises so they could heal."
Upon arriving inside the Bunker, the four were very shocked to find Gabriel eating a lot of chocolate cake, looking anxious and depressed.
John nodded on, wanting to change the subject quickly. He couldn't help but feel a tug in his heart after hearing a bit of Sam's life before the fire. He'll get the son of a bitch for killing their women soon. "So, Doc, what about Ms. Yuson's admittance in the hospital? What is her recent injury this time?"
They quickly returned to Kansas via Angel air travel. Dean took care of parking the Impala in the garage exactly the way he wanted it while Gabriel and Castiel gave Nikita and John the 411 of what happened and who Nikita really is. Afterward, she stared off into the distance and nodded, though she felt so much more gloom and alarm at once with her new identity in reveal. John sat beside her through the whole ordeal silently as they both absorbed the information in the Library.
"WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME LIVE?! I'M OLD ENOUGH TO FOLLOW MY OWN RULES! LISTEN TO ME AND TALK TO ME LIKE AN ADULT!"
The father caught on and quickly replied, "Not much, but I was one of the detectives who had to question him the day after the fire incident happened." The doctor thought it was a good excuse and nodded, going on with his story on Nikita.
Everyone sitting at the table, minus Dean and Castiel since they had work, jumped in their seats over the random archangel popping into the room. They all glanced at him before shifting their gazes towards the paper on the table.
Everyone stared at the archangel in awe, except for John, who nodded in appreciation before running through the very cold living room for Nikita. Gabriel followed him as the rest of the group slowly walked in through the rubble of the door's remains.
"....Sam? Dean?" Claire called out as she turned back to the Winchesters. "Your lives are fucking weird."
Castiel frowned at the thought and marched over to Gabriel. Ten minutes later Hannah appeared and helped Castiel calm Gabriel down. Dean decided to keep his distance and call whoever abandoned the salvage yard. He was ready to make a commitment for his family.
Nikita scrambled to the floor and drew out another rune that she luckily memorized yesterday. Adding this to the spell would bump any stranger of the spellcaster back to wherever they came from, though it was a long shot of whether the two strangers would bump back to another city location or another year.
"Five," Dean smacked Gabriel at the back of his head once he reached to all 5 fingers sticking out from counting. " - how the fuck did you get an elephant from India to create a parade around the block?!" Gabriel was about to answer, but Dean quickly interrupted him. "Don't even try explaining - I don't actually want to know, just fix this fucking mess and make the cops think we already paid for damages after YOU clean all this crap up!"
"...well, turns out it could have been a witch that did that to us. According to your archangel over there in the kitchen, probably eating - " "I CAN HEAR YOU!" "- something sweet right now, our memories were tampered with by a witch. Thankfully, Gabriel returned my memories when he brought me back from the living and decided you need my help for this Darkness business. Nikita is included in this, believe it or not."
"Yes, sir. So are you going to look for Nikita - I mean, if you have the time because Mom's killer is still out here somewhere - "
The young group tensed but the man shook his head. "Relax, I ain't gonna hurt ya if you're this innocent, based on the little girl here." He gestured to the Piper Boy, to which the Zanna squawked at him. "Hey, I'm a boy!"
"I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING!" John roared as he stormed through the hotel door, kicking it open after Nikita quickly unlocked it with her passkey.
Sam's eyes widened in realization. "Shit! I forgot to mention - Dean and I have made some friends in the past several years... like I said earlier not
After leaving the Bunker with the Impala, Dean and Castiel drove toward the nearest populated area in town to look for a job. To get insurance in support for raising the Nephilim, the now legal couple had to find legal jobs with a good benefits package.
John frowned as he scanned the front porch of the small cabin. He didn't seem to mind the cold much. "I'm looking for a spare key."
Claire, who was lining salt by the doorway with a special line casing to make it permanent, whipped her head around and made a disgusted noise in her throat. "Ew! Uncle Gabe, that's gross! Uncle Sam won't do that to me!" Sam, too, strengthened his bitch face at the archangel.
Dean turned to get a good look at him and he blushed, smiling slightly. "Hey, angel, you forgot to tie it properly again."
The archangel frowned as he finished his slice of cheesecake. "It's a two man mission, and only abominations, such as cambions and nephilims, can free souls that do not deserve Hell or Purgatory, and that includes the Cage. Since the Nephilim is nothing related to a demon, he or she must taint their wings slightly to help free any soul from the Cage in order to be the supporting strength that a Cambion needs. The only way to do that is for the Nephilim to free another soul from Hell."
The stranger was a young boy around her age and appeared to look pale. He had a childish innocent smile on his face and proceeded to play the pipe in his hand.
When Dean came to again, the first people he saw were Castiel, Claire, his dad, Nikita, his brother, and Ben. His son.
Sam's shoulders drooped as he nodded. "At least he's in Heaven, though..." he mumbled softly, feeling relief at no longer associating what he's seen with Adam as the victim, but rather was Michael.
monsters are bad, Dad. Long story short about Garth for example - he's the best hunter and a prodigy under Bobby, believe it or not. He recently got bit by a werewolf, though, but another one killed him and helped Garth stay on the animal raw meat to survive. Those two married and Garth is now staying at his wife's father's place in a farm."
Hannah, using a human man as a vessel, was shocked to see Gabriel pummel through the bookshelf as if it was paper. "So that's where Metatron trapped you! Castiel told me before about seeing you, but he thought it was just a mirage!" She let out a yelp as the archangel glomped her in a hug.
Castiel and Gabriel will be joining in the story soon, and I swear to God I'll make John look like a decent father.
John smiled brightly and he openly wept, which was a foreign sight to see for everyone else around him.  He clobbered the young girl in a big hug. "Nikki, you're awake! Thank Heavens you're alive!" He exclaimed with open glee.
"ALRIGHT ALREADY!" Gabriel yelled back and pushed his stash back in the secret compartment of his bed. He muttered to himself, "Damn Winchesters... they're like bloodhounds..."
The Piper Boy decided to speak up and gestured to himself. "Zanna." He pointed beside him. "Nephilim-ish. It's complicated, but she's human enough." He gestured to the being next to her. "Hottie over there is a cambion." He pointed at the young woman, who seem to be the eldest in the group. "Human soul but technically should have been demon-ish. It's complicated."
"Now, understand - I cannot be seen with you two abominations. I have a reputation to protect in Hell, and it's already been weakened by these two idiots," Crowley complained while pointing at the Winchester brothers standing near him. "Task 1 is to fly directly into Hell via burning part of your wings. Task 2 will be to find Adam first before searching for Bela's parents, which is where her soul might be. Task 3 is to fly directly out. Anything else will be most likely improvised, considering the luck that the Winchesters & Campbells have." The demon glared at the entire family and quickly flashed a smile at the young teenagers. "Any questions?"
"Nikita! Nikita Yuson?" The Winchester boys shook their head slowly, not remembering. John sighed and ran his hand through his hair. "Dean, remember that time when you called me and we both felt dizzy that day?"
Nikita's eyes widened at the sudden present before her. "I...how... oh my God..." She uttered and trailed off.
Sure, the ponies were fun for Sam & Dean, but the elder son preferred to live in a hotel that didn't look and feel like a
Everyone, including the teacher and excluding the Piper Boy, stared at the answer scribbled on the board and how Nikita showed her work. No one in the classroom noticed the principal silently checking each classroom with a clipboard in hand, especially when he stopped by their classroom upon noticing the silence. He glanced at the board and looked impressed.
The young teenage boy's eyes widened in alarm. "That's even worse!" He shouted and scrambled away from her.
She tried to pray to Gabriel, but she forgot that she warded her dorm room entirely so that all types of angels wouldn't be able to locate her or enter her dreams. Dean's father, John, warned her earlier about Nikita's imaginary friend and sleep patterns. He analyzed them and one of the causes he came up with was that it could be an angel trying to enter her dreams.
There was a grumbled "Yes sir" as Dean trudged into the dining room with Sam holding his arm in a tight grip. Castiel was signing a document that John just finished forging out, claiming that Castiel now has parental rights over Nikita Yuson. The angel gave the pen to Dean, who grunted but reluctantly took it to sign the document.
Sam sputtered silently and quickly regained confidence to prove he was right. From the kitchen doorway, Gabriel, Alex, and Jack peeked their heads out slowly to watch the scene before them.
John silently approved of his future son-in-law taking the hit for his son. Claire muttered to herself on how brave her pseudo-father is. Sam, however, looked horrified.
The two fought that day and were in equal footing, though Dean ignored the physical injuries he received. Zuriel and Jack had interfered at the time and made Max calm down enough to obtain enough information to look it up from Jack's weird computer in the garage during lunch break. Dean was a bit disturbed that there were two clones with his DNA with similar barcodes like Max's, and was even more disturbed when one of them (Max briefly explained "He's my brother, Ben..." when she saw the barcode and picture of X5-493 on Jack's computer screen.) died at his employee's hands and had been a delusional case talking about the Blue Lady.
Sam and Gabriel help Claire adjust to her new life in college with responsibility and partying (the 2nd part being Gabe's fault).
Castiel loves his job so much that he adapted to smiling at all his students, who in turn looked at him as if he was a creep.
Claire gaped at the angel and spun to gape at the two strangers in front of her, who were eyeing her warily and took a step back.
Gabriel blurted out, "I remember now! I used to time travel with Captain Jack Harkness and the Doctor!"
"Shh... don't ever call those cookies that name," Crowley informed her in a whisper. "Aussies apparently don't like that... and she improvised the ingredients anyway, so those cookies are not what you're thinking they are." With that, he stepped away from the doorway and silently left after checking his Rolex watch, indicating that it had already been one hour since the hybrid humans left for Hell.
Both Sam and Dean let out small smiles seeing their father with the new Winchester together. Castiel broke the moment by going through the documents displayed on the table. "There is a matter of creating a new identity for you, John Winchester. According to FBI records, you are deceased, so you cannot claim paternal rights." He glanced at the elder Winchester brother. "Dean, however, can get parental rights in the eye of the public as Dean Clapton."
Nikki frowned at him. "It's pretty hot, actually..." She mumbled as she unbuttoned a few top buttons from her trench coat. Jesse raised an eyebrow at her actions and voiced out, "Maybe if you had flown in without your yellow trench coat, you'd feel that it's actually room temperature... it's pretty cozy."
! Ice melted but weak foundation blasted due to the strength of the spell and how weak the foundation of the cabin was to begin with."
John and Nikki walked out dressed in semi-casual attire, with John adding a leather jacket to his suit attire and Nikki wearing a denim jacket over her flowery dress. The Winchester patriarch frowned at the boys. "Why do you two look like you've been at a mechanic shop? Chop, chop! Go wear something nice for the dinner tonight! I got reservations at Mass St. Fish House & Raw Bar - now git!" He ordered them, causing the boys to grumble yet hop over to their rooms to get dressed.
John raised an eyebrow at Dean as he finished packing Dean's stuff. Sam happily started packing his own duffel bag.
The angel climbed out of the Impala and walked towards Dean. "I seem to recall an earlier conversation in 'Baby' about your discontinued education. Perhaps we can put you in community college for part time? We all still believe you can achieve a degree in education."
The imaginary friend frowned and groaned. "I told you I don't actually play on the pipe! It's an illusion to mask my actual weapon!"
The female customer giggled. "Oh, he did! I just wanted to return the favor because the deal I got to pay for the damages doesn't do justice compared to the excellent service I got..." She winked at Dean when their eyes met, and Dean merely smiled and waved.
Sam and Castiel looked at him with pity while Gabriel glared at him. It was Sam who spoke up. "Dean, you know we didn't know at the time... we only assumed."
She overheard Rowena speak again after muttering a few incantations for her spell, indicating that the spell had sadly worked. "In a moment, they will not remember this nephilim and we can go on to kill it, my dear ex-angel." Rowena paused for a moment before stating a remark, drawing Nikita's blood running cold in fear.
Gabriel laughed and shook his head, pulling out a lollipop and sucking it. Sam noticed that that was the 20th piece of candy Gabriel had been eating and made a face when he turned towards him more. The archangel ignored him for John's attention. "True love doesn't have to be romantic. It could be a kiss on the cheek or forehead from a loved one, like family or a close friend who cares deeply."
I'll be focusing more on this story. SHINee will still be a part of this, but in AU form, so it doesn't hurt as much when using Jonghyun as a muse. They'll only be tagged in the next story, because I plan on making every crossover gradual.
Nikita let out a few soft giggles, causing John to crack a grin on his face. "Alright then, Doc. I'll be seeing ya soon, maybe never. I'll be sure to give you a call if I need it." He waved the medical instructions given by Dr. Harkness earlier. The doctor smiled and waved as he watched the supposed FBI agent and patient leave to a big black truck with Richard, who carried the stupid pink umbrella so that Nikita would have shade.
The young woman in question hesitantly walked out of her bedroom with a familiar tall figure holding her hand. Dean's eyes widened.
Castiel and John just came from the store of the gas station with small treats for the road trip and pie for Dean. Dean and Gabriel glanced over at Sam with them. Sam had been digging for more change through the glove department of the Impala and found his wallet from when he went to Stanford University. In it, he had pulled out a few polaroid photos that appear to have been located in the hospital. Sam's heart sank seeing his young happy face with Jessica. He flipped through a few photos and noticed they centered around a certain young girl.
Bela perked up at the prospect of her pseudo-father long ago rejoining her. "Yes, I - I'd like that."
Nikita quickly ran to her room, crawled through a small tunnel placed in the under side of her closet, and opened the small latched door. With her size, she was able to crawl in and lock the trap door after she entered.
Said Zanna blushed deeply and nodded in reply, watching Jesse grin and running to catch up to his charge. The Piper Boy adjusted his white baggy shirt as he quickly followed after them.
Castiel shook his head and remained stubborn. "I may have developed human taste buds, but I still remain an angel." With another deep breath, he walked further into the kitchen and sat between Gabriel and Donna, who were already starting on their hefty helpings of burgers with beetroot included inside the bun. He slowly grabbed one of the burgers and started to munch on it.
If he reported to Child Protection Services now, he and Sammy would be torn away from their father and torn from each other in the foster care system.
Castiel frowned and sighed. "I regret trying to kill him at the time. I assumed he was a possible threat to humanity for when Lucifer reigns. Now I see that cannot happen. He is an innocent child."
Everything I've created purely out of imagination literally froze under my hands. So many things reminded me of him.
"I've noticed half the time that you stare at my eldest son more than my youngest, and that you spend more time with Dean than a regular person would as friends."
Claire slowly blinked at Ben after the short explanation (though it felt like a lengthy one) and nodded slowly, wincing at her face.
His eyes widened in surprise seeing his eldest son cuddling with an angel of the Lord in their sleep. However, he wasn't actually surprised that they would cuddle.
Gabriel nodded at John's question (sounded more like a demand) and scanned his eyes around the Impala. Due to his short size, he was able to call middle seat in the backseat area of the vehicle. Dean was driving while Sam was typically at the passenger side. On his left sat the legendary John Winchester, who he recently brought back to the living permanently. He considered bringing Mary, but as it turns out she didn't want to leave Heaven. Mary told Gabriel that she recently heard from Ash and the Harvelles about Bobby Smith's capture in Heaven, so she's sticking around to help free and hide him before searching for Karen, Bobby's wife.
John scoffed and rolled his eyes. "Oh, not this again. I'm actually proud of the tall fucker. It's his attitude that's the problem - I understand I raised him too hard in the world, so it may be my fault he's rebellious."
Meanwhile Nikita starts to dream again after being in a dreamless sleep for many years. The content in her dreams seems to be too realistic for it to be a dream...
Castiel, Crowley, and Gabriel glanced at each other after the last human left the main room of the Bunker.
Jesse stopped by the Piper Boy as Nikki continued to stalk ahead into the cavern hallway. He clasped a hand on the Zanna teenager's shoulder. "Good work finding these hallways so quickly, Honeybun."
The rest of the class reluctantly clapped for the new student. Nikita blushed in light embarrassment and quickly snuck a seat at the back corner of the classroom. There were luckily two rows of empty seats at the back end of the classroom.
The archangel turned to look at John with a raised eyebrow. He watched as the hunter dashed towards the closet door and slid it open to crouch down at the floor. John pried a loose floorboard open, letting the three other floorboards crumple.
Dean starts to remember and joins in with his father's hunt for the missing girl. Gabriel informs the Winchesters and Castiel who and what exactly Nikita Yuson is. Sam finds old photographs that remind him of the girl. Castiel attempts to help John catch up on current events and who he is to the Winchesters. John learns about his recently late father and son, Adam, and waits for the possible fallout from the rest of his sons.
Bela narrowed her eyes sharply at her. "How do YOU know Dean Winchester?" She demanded before the vampire could answer.
Everyone in the library annex stared at the Zanna in confusion. "Who the hell is the Piper Boy?" asked Dean.
"I like the way you're thinking, Cas." Dean smirked at him and subconsciously held Castiel's hand. In return the angel subconsciously squeezed Dean's hold on his hand.
The nephilim-like child shrugged. "When I woke up from my coma spell, Dad was alive and saving me from a crumbling cabin." She answered simply.
"Hey, Miss Camden. I hope your car is satisfactory." Castiel smiled brightly and lightly touched Dean's shoulder. "My husband is a hardworking man and I am proud of him." He declared promptly. Dean lightly blushed and chuckled, shrugging as he scratched his head slightly. "Ah, it's nothing, Cas. Just using my skills to help provide for our children now."
Which opens up a new can of worms... how is John going to explain to his sons that they have a half-brother? He imagines that would not go well, but he'll endure it to save what's left of his family.
"...I guess it was easier to think he was still alive and a bit of an asshole to leave his family." John muttered to himself, though everyone in the car heard him. He knew they heard him.
a diploma that angels could conjure up with a flick of the wrist." The archangel finished his thought and took another bite of his pretzel.
"I can make you a professor in the institution AND a dean! You can be in charge since Hannah's already in charge of Heaven upstairs and will need the help of an archangel. Obviously we'll have the common core education to help those who haven't graduated from high school like Deano here, but we can offer majors such as Religion, Mythology, Voodoo - ALSO we can have Master degrees in Latin and other linguistics, Runes, and Rituals, Witches -" Gabriel took a big gasp at a sudden epiphany. "WE COULD BE LIKE HOGWARTS!"
It seemed to satisfy Dean because he grunted in approval and spoke a soft farewell with Sam's grumbling in the background. John muttered his own goodbyes before hanging up. He shook his head.
"I ain't got nothin' but time, child," the vampire chuckled softly and scratched his head. "The name's Benny, by the way. If you're friends of Dean, then count me in."
John smiled back at her and squeezed her in the hug. "I'm countin' on it, darlin'..." He drawled out playfully.
John slowly turned his murderous glare at the nurse in front of him. She flinched and stepped back. He slowly went back to signing a checkout clipboard. Meanwhile, a male nurse who was usually assigned for the regular adult patients helped the doctor that John previously talked to (and was okay with) fit Nikita into a wheelchair.
The black 1967 Chevrolet Impala strolled down the small hill path and toward the front of the cabin. All five of the occupants in the vehicle climbed out and stared at the small brown cabin. The place actually looked decent if no one minded the cold and slightly icy particles hanging by the edges of the rooftop.
Claire walked into the kitchen and frowned. "I'm siding with Sam on this one, Gabe - I don't think I'm up for partying. Also, Doris keeps getting calls from her mother overseas about this party being a bad idea. Doris wants to cancel the party - "
Dean and Sam turned quickly to stare at Castiel. "Seriously?!" They both exclaimed. They glanced over at their father and adopted sister, who looked too entertained at the situation in front of them alongside Jody.
Everyone stared at Castiel for a moment before John broke the silence with another snort. He patted Castiel on the shoulder. "I like you, kid." He turned to his son and bent down to definitely take a good look at him through the open window. "See, son? Even the angel of the Lord sees that you got a chance and approves."
Sam growled in frustration and shook his head. "I mean it, Dean. Nikki's never had an imaginary friend before, and all of a sudden he appears and doesn't even have a name?"
The burly man grinned at them. "You know, the last time I laughed like this in this place was the last time a human was here."
is that I shouldn't be lazy with my life, and neither should my spouse." Dean answered honestly but paused for a short moment. "...then again, we could always create a company here in town and do that insurance thing you just said." He looked around and sighed, climbing out of the car. "I have absolutely no idea what I want to do for work occupation, though."
"Really? Damn." John muttered and shook his head. "I raised two hellfires - wait, shit!" His eyes widened and he shook both of his sons. "Let's just drop whatever's going on right now for later business - we have to save your sister!"
She luckily snapped out of her thoughts in time to duck when an eruption of green fire was aimed toward her. She quickly got up and ran away from the crazy people back into the local clearing, where John said he'd surprise her with something as a 2nd part of her birthday gift.
John chuckled and interrupted him before he could continue. "Son, from what you've told me about her, I'll be sure to check on her right away. I'm only a state away from California, so I'll be able to get to the hospital near Stanford tonight. From there, I'll check if this Nikita Yuson is still checked in the hospital. If she's not, I'll be able to find her with her name anyway, and it looks like she resides in California so it'll be easier to track her family than your mother's killer."
"That's what I told the cops," The doctor sighed. "That's also why they arrested the person who hired her. He's in questioning now at the precinct, but sadly they have no proof that she was a victim of child abuse, so they just let her off and left yesterday."
Nikita frowned and wrinkled her small button-shaped nose, causing John to crack a smile. The girl was just too cute for words - and crap, he's already getting used to the little Asian kid.
"Nikita, go throw the knife away. Hopefully CPS isn't around - last time I checked they were having a drink with the owner in the main cafeteria of the ranch resort," the father ordered someone and grumbled near the wall, where Dean could hear the words "How the hell is there a knife hidden in this place?"
we buy groceries." Dean marched away from the angel and into the grocery store. He did not want to think about turning domestic in a chic-flick kind of way. Nope.
Now, Sam wasn't sure whether to count this as a sudden fortunate or misfortunate interruption, but either way it seemed really important when Gabriel woke up with a shout and scanned the area with wide eyes. Dean woke up with a snort, ending his quiet pig snoring habit he developed since God knows when. Both John and Castiel glanced at the archangel with questioning gazes.
"Nikki! I'm so sorry, baby!" He called out softly with a couple of nicknames. Over the past few months since he saw his sons meet the little girl for a brief moment, he knew what he wanted. He wanted to adopt Nikita.
Everyone was shocked as Nikki told them about her past and how she met John Winchester, up to the point of craziness that became her life after she woke up from saving herself from Rowena and Metatron's wrath. No one was surprised that Castiel asked Dean to marry him and that Dean was completely crazy for Castiel.
The teacher smiled and gestured to the new student standing beside her. "Everyone, please welcome your new classmate in this institution, Nikita Yuson-Clapton!"
"No, but as an angel I drank a liquor store. I believe I was inebriated after finding out my Father did not care for me."
Metatron continued to stare at her with a flabbergasted expression. A red-headed woman rolled her eyes and came out from behind a thick-wood tree. "Metatron, no time to waste! It is obvious that the tablet means it's her we have to kill!"
Sam could see his father nodding through the rear-view mirror but the following question from him had him stumped.
2. Also, I edited out a very important piece of information and I want to re-explain myself: The 1st conversation with Nikita and her family was the one where I altered my past events of my life and turned it into that. That 1st chapter beginning was when I was down and depressed and decided to vent out. The rest of what happens in the story are not of what I experienced as a child, especially with Bela's story. The writers actually made an implication that her childhood was that way in the actual show, at least from what I interpreted from the few clips shown of Bela's past.
John went over to the small group and raised an eyebrow at the umbrella. Richard noticed the look and appeared affronted. "What? I'll have you know pink is a definite manly color! It was Hitler who tried to denounce its masculinity - right, Dr. Harkness?" He faced the doctor with a pout.
Claire nodded along with Jody's words and looked over at the Team Free Will men with wide puppy eyes. Dean frowned. "Dammit, did Sammy teach you that?!" He earned a bitch face from said man.
"Me, too, dad. Me, too." Ben chuckled as he glanced at a grumpy Sam and whining Gabriel from a distance who both had to guide a group of 200 students themselves as part of the new student recruitment orientation at the school.
"...that's because he doesn't know. My mom lied to him and me years ago... and now that she and I remember who he is - "
Dean frowned and turned to Sam, who was torn between staring at the photos that he now remembers when they were taken and giving Dean the puppy eyes to back up their father.
He quietly chuckled and quickly took a photo, quietly creeping out of the room before Castiel would wake up from his slumber. Lately the angel would take power naps to help recover his grace, but also to spend time alone with Dean in his dreams. Dean was always happy to oblige spending any kind of time with him.
Using her gut feeling, she hesitantly arranged the strings to where it made sense to her. By the time she was done, she realized based on the time on the radio clock that she had only used 15 minutes to organize the notes on the wall. Her eyes narrowed at a common subject.
The tall Winchester stared at him blankly before jumping out of his bed and towards him with his gun still in his hand. "Keep talking." He demanded.
"That's easy! It's the Bunker!" Dean interrupted with a smile slowly growing on his face. He felt happy that his own father would have given him custody of someone he cherishes in case he dies.
Although he is an archangel, knowing the Winchesters, he might be powerless if he ends up misbehaving. He learned early on never to underestimate the Winchesters.
, where transgenics and anomalies from Manticore can feel useful with their abilities and take serious heavy-level therapy (3 floors - no basement); a blue-purple building with a medieval architectural structure for the
"Cas..." Dean began and shook his head. "I'm always a hunter, through and through. I've tried the full non-hunting life and it hasn't stuck."
Nikita grunted softly in reply and John couldn't help but chuckle as he looked for a glass of water somewhere. He found a small cup of water that only had a little bit of water. He frowned at the dust collecting around the cup on the table beside the bed. "How long was it since your last cup of water?"
He moved to grab the doorknob of his room, but then he heard a frail soft voice echo through the walls.
John snorted as he let go of Nikita. "I forgot about that ID. The damn kid wanted aliases with anything that had music in it. Dean, one day someone is going to know and realize who we are." Dean smirked and shrugged as he leaned back in his seat.
The angel let his friend/husband fix his tie and he took a good look at Dean's work clothes. His face flushed for some reason seeing the dark blue mechanic overalls suit fit perfectly to Dean's body shape. It matched hit trademark choice of boots.
Dean merely raised an eyebrow as Castiel woke up grumbling behind him, slowly sitting up and pulling at Dean's waist to sit up with him. "Please stop yelling, Sam. Dean and I were trying to sleep after last night's copulation."
Later as they were packing up to get out of the library, Nikita glanced down at the book in her hands and saw a picture on the page of a dark entity with Yellow Eyes. "Hey, John?" She called out to him as her eyes scanned down to the label of the picture.
Castiel turned to the new people in the room with a calm look on his face. "Ah, I believe you two are Zanna, correct?"
Castiel walked with Dean through the local mall after grocery shopping with him. They had to find new clothes to wear for the people who missed nine years of their lives of the latest common fashion trends (according to their new identities; John Clapton [Dean's brother] and Nikita Yuson-Clapton).
Needless to say, those children's parents were now very upset upon seeing who signed which contract for what clauses.
"HOW COULD AZAZEL DO THAT TO MY CHILD?!" He continued to yell as he smashed a porcelain vase against a wall.
Now, Nikita felt slightly protected, but it wasn't enough. She wanted John, the only family she's got.
Castiel's eyes widened in surprise before he settled his expressions in with a smile. "Very well. I have something in mind as well. Perhaps we can buy each other rings, just to be even?"
Nikki's eyes widened in realization as she remembered conversations with her family. "Do you by chance know Dean Winchester?" She asked him.
The archangel stared at her/him (he's quickly deciding on him) with a deadpan look. "...let me guess, Winchesters and Castiel? Yeah, Team Free Will must have struck again."
"Hey, Cass." John waved his fancy thick envelope in Castiel's path of vision. "Would you be able to send this to my wife? It'd be real swell if you could."
The Piper Boy's face grew ashen at the sight behind him before shaking his head and going back to patrol for the Cage.
To both Gabriel and John's shock, the hidden basement slowly felt warm in temperature. Castiel calmly walked down the small stone of stairs to look for them. "The ice is rapidly melting around the cabin," he informed his brother. "I suggest we evacuate the area before the wet wooden material of this old cabin collapses on us." He turned to John and added, "Your sons have found the documents that prove your words and their lost memories true. They are now arguing about custody rights for the child in your arms."
"Perhaps we can slightly alter the past events now so that when we go back to our time we can get even more odds in our favor? Like kill the Winchesters for good?"
John grinned in thanks and glanced at the table full of books and case files. "What've we got here, angel?"
Now Nikita silently munched on spaghetti that Castiel quickly cooked (something he remembered perfecting when he was human) after taking pain medication. John decided to find a doctor and a dentist for his daughter's needs, but in order to pay less and get insurance, he decided to quickly forge documents for Dean Clapton's custody for the kid, thus emphasizing his idea to have Castiel Page married to Dean in forged documents.
I honestly didn't know they were going that route and it's helping my fic idea for this! I almost went into a writer's block there. Thank you, SPN writers!
"My Zanna, apparently, who has no fucking name and is basically an imaginary friend..." The young girl grumbled towards the slightly older teen. She glared at the Zanna. "What're you doing here, Piper Boy? This is Hell!"
Also, I probably won't bring Adam back to life. In real time on the show, I feel it didn't make sense that Jimmy got to go to Heaven after his vessel died but Adam couldn't for the same reason. Why the fuck would he be in Hell? Even the Supernatural crew and cast forgot their own plots.
The messenger of the Lord was too busy basking in the glow of what Claire just admitted. "Ahhh~ I'm an uncle! We're official uncles, Sammy-boy!"
"I'm ready!" Castiel shouted in response and walked out wearing a slightly different look to his trademark trench coat and suit. The angel quickly became accustomed to his new suits of apparel in different colors and styles. He was currently wearing his same trench coat, though his attire was of a long blue suit buttoned jacket over a crisp white shirt in a slim fit and half tied black and white striped tie, matching slacks in similar chroma, and classic black Oxford shoes.
"Woman in White..." she mumbled to herself, though it seemed that someone heard her because she heard a throat clear behind her.
"I hear ya, big guy. I hope you're doing alright, Sammy." He called out to him and spoke softer on the phone. "Dean, I'll be sure to check it out and make sure she's safe, okay? I'll do the best I can."
The Zanna teen responded, "I was sent to protect you... Hell is included in the package!" He shivered as he looked around the place. "Is it me or does it feel too cold in here?"
John's eyes widened as he glanced at the sources of light from the windows at the pediatric ward of the hospital. "But it's gotta be over 100 degrees outside! It's hot all over California!" He shouted in shock. "Plus the damn girl is underage to drive! How was she able to get the damn job?!"
So he was very torn with what he was hearing from next door in the vacation hotel at a saddle ranch.
In confusion, the young girl looked up at the Asian teenager. "Who are you?" She asked softly, trembling in fear and relief at once.
Castiel's eyes widened and he blurted out his thoughts before Gabriel could respond. "Caylao is a Filipino name for 'fellow light bearer'. Could this possibly be the Nephilim that the Morningstar was supposed to care for, had he not tried to destroy humanity the first time?"
Before both Dean and Castiel could respond, Nikita grabbed John's face and looked at him closely. "You look about a few years older..." She spoke more audible and clear, feeling more awake than before as she stretched her back a bit. She glanced at the Winchester brothers and her eyes widened slightly. "Whoa, you two look a lot older than when we first met!" She blurted out.
The archangel continued to ramble on as Dean leaned slowly toward Castiel. "You know it'd be really awesome if you were a professor, but... should we really trust short stack here to make a replica of a school from a fantasy book?" He whispered in the angel's ear.
"Dad! Sammy! Jody!" Dean called out to the people coming out of the truck. Gabriel and Crowley frowned and stuck their heads out from the rear of the truck. "What are we, chopped liver?!" They asked at the same time in the same indignant tone.
"Because my charge has to either name me or wish the perfect wish for me to do so. So far, I haven't met a kid that could do that." The Piper Boy spoke softly in a moment of sadness that Nikita couldn't help but sit uncomfortably. Before she could speak up more, her surrogate father rushed into the kitchen.
Said boy walked towards Nikki and glanced at her wings with awe on his face. "That's so cool..." He voiced out then frowned at himself. "I can't ever grow wings."
Nikita nodded and looked down at a book she was reading, which was open on a chapter about different types of demons. She flipped a page and started reading while asking another question. "Why are we looking for another hunt? Shouldn't we deal with the spirit known as the Woman in White?"
She quickly scampered up to the board, scribbled a few numbers with chalk, then quickly sped back to her seat.
Nikki tilted her arm towards Bela, who looked confused at her. "May I please have your arm? I can absorb your soul inside my arm to bring to Earth. We'll find your grave and raise you from final Perdition," she informed her while asking for permission.
Crowley growled into the phone. "Do not make me burn my bacon by accident. I'm making eggs benedict." He turned off the stove from where he was, in the kitchen of the Bunker. "I did that poor girl a favor! I gave her a free life to do whatever she wanted to do. She was barely fed at her age and her parents were fucking rich! And hypocrites! Not to mention that there was more than child abuse going on in that household!"
"The plan to pick up Adam Milligan and Bela Talbot should commence as soon as possible... I'm sorry to have interrupted things, really, as I know you were celebrating your engagement today, but both Angie and Jesse insist that the sooner this is done, the better."
The Piper Boy frowned at his charge. "I know that! I just mean we're lost here - we need to find the portal where humans can only access it." He pointed at the forest ahead of them. "In case it hasn't escaped your intelligence - Leviathans and other monsters roam here!"
She sat down and pulled out her assigned textbooks needed for this lesson, which was English at the moment.
Dean chuckled and leaned back against the headboard of his bed inside his room at the Bunker. Castiel laid beside him and made sure the door was closed, but not locked. "I told you, once they realize and peek into our room to find us snuggling is when we'll make the announcements."
Her Algebra teacher narrowed her eyes at her and scoffed. "Well, Miss Clapton, if you would like to solve this equation on the board - which is the hardest, mind you - then feel free to do so." She lazily gestured to the chalkboard beside her.
The eldest brother turned to him with a glint in his eye as he glared at him. "We already discussed this - no chic flicks! I know I wasn't the ideal brother you grew up with, but you didn't have to shut me out when you went to Stanford - "
The eldest hunter grumbled and put on his reading glasses before checking the piece of paper. His face scrunched up and he slowly turned to the archangel. "Why the fuck did you have my wife tag along in this bet over my son and his angel?"
"Yeah, I hear ya... so Sammy found the little girl out, eh?" There was grumbling noises in the background. "Is that Sam? Am I on speakerphone?"
It was Jesse who responded this time. "We can take you to him, if you'd like, but after we raise your soul from Perdition."
Gabriel sulked and nodded, trailing after the college students and the cops outside, where every now and then you could hear the elephant blowing its trunk.
Both Nikki and Jesse glanced at each other and nodded. They were previously informed of their main goal: rescue Adam Milligan and Bela Talbot.
"This is the place..." John breathed out with a soft tone in his voice that made the boys (and angels) turn their heads to look at him. He slowly walked toward the cabin and glanced around for something.
The last person he hired was a woman, which he was definitely okay with, given the circumstances that he witnessed how quickly the young female learned to fix an engine and a flat tire within one hour. Dean figured she wasn't entirely human, either, especially once he saw how fast she worked on her own with 5 customers within two hours. She commented during the interview that Seattle had been a bad place for her, but it didn't really hit Dean of how strange she was until he noticed a bar code on the back of her neck when she tied her hair up. Her name was simply Max, but unfortunately with checks and regulations for the banks, one first name wouldn't suffice. He prodded her one day to reveal her last name until she blew up and tried to hit him, exclaiming that she never had a last name because she was busy being enslaved in a place called Manticore. (She was also angry that Dean looked like someone she knew and was very close with.)
The elder Winchester brother's eyes widened as he caught on to the idea. "Because Nikki is only a nephilim by special circumstances, she can turn her powers off and conserve her energy, causing the portal for Earth to open for her..." He gently explained to the other confused people in the Bunker.
"It seems to be the case of a leprechaun, which I'm sure Dean hates to revisit because it reminds him of a soulless Sam," Castiel answered as he stood up from his chair.
"Gabriel did what? ...which boy was this, again? ...I see... your uncle even got Sam in jail? With a professor? ...alright, but explain to me again how Gabriel managed to secure a rocket launcher on the roof of a fraternity building without security around..."
John snorted and pulled out a worn out journal from one of the bookshelves behind him. "You started the bet with Bobby and the Harvelles, Sam, and now everyone took a turn in it." He opened the journal and shoved it towards Sam's direction on the table so he could take it. "I'm only gonna act as mediator. Apparently your mom wrote that people from Heaven want a piece of that bet still."
Nikki frowned and shook his head. "I remember finding a potion in my book about removing the hunger for 'loin-pig' from supernatural creatures and cannibals. We can help you!" She exclaimed, suddenly drawing attention in the forest with how the portal is still open on display, making loud noises for creatures nearby to hear.
The angel noticed the heavy stares at him and turned toward Dean. "I may have taken you too literally."
Both Dean and Castiel, now dressed in pajamas (Dean with black pajama shorts and grey shirt and Castiel in only checkered pajama pants), gave their brothers flat stares and replied in unison. "We've been engaged since Valentine's Day."
Gabriel noticed the female customer with the big rack and smirked. "Well hello, dear! Did Deano over there helped you with your car? I swear he's the best!" He boasted.
"Alright - now off, you two heathens! I must come at least an hour after you leave Earth to follow suit in order to not draw suspicions." Crowley shooed them with a wave of his hand.
Doris blinked at Gabriel and her eyes slowly drifted to his back. "...actually yes. That would be my mother's name and Aunt Hermoine is one of my mother's friends. Nice wings, sir. Are you Claire Novak-Clapton's fathers?" She asked as she stepped into the room. Claire let out a sigh of relief when she passed over the salt line without incident but was still wary of her. The girl was tall and somewhat thin with a narrow build. Doris wore a faded pumpkin colored t-shirt dress with a golden collar and matching colored regular All-Star sneakers.
"...seriously, why can't you tell me your name?.... I'm going to call you Piper Boy then, since you keep playing the damn pipe.... bro, I don't care what kind of instrument that is, you're playing it like a pipe! ....wow, I really didn't think you'd get out the pipe. Look, why are you out of my dreams? Why were you even in my dreams?"
Dean snorted and nodded in agreement. "I can't believe he was supposed to take care of any baby at all!"
The Piper Boy pushed the teenagers towards the portal once he heard a howl and saw a bunch of monsters running from a few miles ahead. He cursed and shouted to run, turning his back towards them as he faced the monsters with his pipe.
She shut her eyes tight and made sure not to make a sound. She thought the "young handsome man" from one of her general education classes hadn't been drinking when she was talking to him in one of her neighbor's bedrooms.
All eyes snapped over to the little girl in John's arms who rubbed her eyes with one of her hands. She no longer looked frozen or dead.
Both Dean and Sam's jaws dropped in shock, then their faces switched to anger, causing the angels and demon in the room to slowly back away and zap into the kitchen.
There was a rustle noise of the bedroom door opening and then he groaned, obviously not seeing Claire in her bedroom. "Come on! Don't be such a prude! You know you want it!"
"Not now, Dad..." Sam grumbled as he leaned forward in his chair towards the phone. "Are you thinking what I think you might be thinking?"
Fortunately, Castiel was able to feel Sam's discomfort (thank God for angel powers) because it was his turn to change the subject after a brief close on the previous topic. "He was manipulated his whole life and it brought him great despair in his angelic being, but he changed for the better and died a true warrior of Heaven and Humanity." He sat up and adjusted his seating posture in a calm and relaxing state. "Anyway, I had found sex to be quite pleasing with women."
The elder Winchester glared at him and huffed, but reluctantly continued to speak to the archangel. "Nikki found a spell, but the incantation was pretty odd yet blunt in understanding, so I didn't really think she'd use that spell. However, we hadn't come up with another spell that could be used to protect her and the cabin we were hold up in for about a day or so."
The Asian girl's eyes grew soft and sad for her and she reached out with an open palm. "Take my hand and run away with me."
Everyone in the college party froze and turned to see a fuming Dean Winchester next to an equally angry Castiel, and behind the couple were a team of slightly wary yet still scary policemen.
The elderly man looked at her in surprise before shaking his head and chuckling slightly. "When did you get to be such a smartass?" He asked rhetorically.
Said teen was on lookout with the Piper Boy around the Cage, and they were also trying to ignore Lucifer's insults on their existence. "Yeah?" She called out towards the cambion.
"Gabriel, did you bring the show to life or something? Because I'd rather not deal with Weeping Angels or Daleks while we're in this trip."
"Have classes always been this easy in Kansas?" Nikita blurted out while reading her worksheet in the afternoon during classtime, causing the rest of her classmates in her Algebra class to glare at her.
Doris quickly smiled and nodded. "Very nice to meet you, too, despite you having the lingering small portion of demon blood in your digestive system." Sam looked shocked and pale after those words, but before either uncle could reply, she turned to Claire. "Hey, we sort of have a tradition in this dorm to have the new tenants in this dorm to throw a party, as a welcoming of sorts. Would you be holding one anytime soon?"
"Jesse, look out!" Nikki cried out and quickly grabbed a hidden angel blade from her yellow trenchcoat sleeve. She swiped her arm across in front of her and slashed the demon across his chest, creating a scar deep enough for the demon to cry out as his eyes lit up orange and collapsed onto the ground.
John turned to his sons, who were both wide awake and freshly changed into new clothes for the day. "Yeah, I just got the refund for your trip. Sorry to cut the vacation short, but I finished the hunt and got another hunt in Seattle. Somethin' about a facility called Manticore..." He mumbled while helping Dean pack his duffel bag. "It's colder there around this time of year, so you don't have to sprout out freckles here and burn, Dean."
As soon as Nikki pulled Abby out of the room, she and Jesse shut the door tightly, hearing Abby's mother yell profanities at them from behind. Abby backed away from them slightly to get a good look at herself. Her eyes widened at how adult she appeared, yet still wearing the short pink-striped polo shirt with jeans and socks, and suddenly memories rushed through her brain.
Sam winced at the memory of the deceased angel. He wanted someone to change the subject quick, but the two in the back have already assumed Sam wasn't paying attention.
John had answered his phone while grabbing his stuff from the front lawn of a cabin and putting it in his black truck. "Yeah, Dean, I'm okay. I feel kinda dizzy and I'm starting to remember being here - "
Nikita shyly bit her lip and nodded at Sam, then glanced back down at the book. "He said he doesn't have a name though, and that either I should give him a proper name or I have to make some kind of wish that allows for him to do so. The perfect wish." She pouted. "I don't know how to do that."
The young 13 year old's head perked up from staring at the pale white walls and pinned her gaze at John silently.
"Emu." John flatly stated, but maintained the soft voice so as to not let Angie hear him. "I saw her pull out a headless emu from her humongous purse earlier."
"....did I also mention that we'll be staying there for at least 5 months, so you can stay in school undercover while Dean stays at home?"
Said doctor wrinkled his nose, otherwise looking unfazed. "Although that could be true, I was never much into history in school and had to repeat courses related to history. My husband's the one who loves pink. So much." He flatly stated.
Nikki's eyes widened in frantic fear. "Are you nuts?! How the hell are you going to hold them off with THAT?!" She gestured to the pipe the Zanna was holding.
John and Nikita gained this information from the case that had them dressing in posh looks in the first place. There were regular demons in the Hamptons acting like crossroad demons, making deals with greedy young children. When John captured all the demons at a gazebo and made sure they weren't getting out of their meat suits, Nikita had been the one to calmly tell the families and distant relatives at the Hamptons nearby the gazebo that demons do exist and that the children so far who officially made deals had sold their souls permanently, according to the terms in the contracts that the demons made the children sign before sealing the deals with a kiss.
The vampire retracted his teeth and stared at the group in confusion, lowering his makeshift weapon.
"Hello, my name is John Clapton and this here's my lovely niece, Nikki." The eldest Winchester introduced him and his adopted daughter to the front desk clerk of the dentistry. He and Sam brought the girl there for a dental checkup. "But I tend to check up on her as if she's my very own daughter. Nikki, darlin', say hi to the pretty lady here," he coaxed Nikita gently. The girl shyly waved at the front desk clerk, causing the young woman to squeal. "Awww~! She's so cute! You'll be bumped up on the waiting list, kay, sweetie?"
After a long silent moment, the stranger turned to look at Claire with sincere concern. "Are you alright? My name is Ben Braiden-Winchester."
Gabriel filed his nails in his own personal room at the Bunker with a phone by his ear. It had been three weeks since he helped Dean and Castiel maintain actual occupations with benefits, though he was still upset when he was outvoted over recreating an actual Hogwarts school. "Yeah?"
John glanced around the Bunker. "Well this is our home. You could always say you retired from the FBI and find a decent job for now. As for being married... I have an idea."
