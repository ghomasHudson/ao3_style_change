) hardened Steve’s cock even further and he bit his lip to keep quiet. Tony pushed one finger into himself, then another. He thrust them in and out and spread them, and Steve could see into him past the shiny ring of muscle. Tony added another finger then moaned as he pushed them in to the knuckle. Steve almost reached out then, not wanting Tony to hurt himself, but Tony looked like he was enjoying it.
Steve steps forward, anger brewing, but he’s brushed aside by a woman who comes to scoop Tony right up in her arms. Steve watches as Tony clutches the brace to the woman’s—Maria’s—his mother’s back. There is a glow about her, unlike the other figures that had often appeared in Tony’s dreams. She strokes gently on Tony’s hair and Tony buries his face into her neck, tiny shoulders shaking. On her way out, she stops right by Steve.
Tony opened his eyes. There was nothing but darkness and he was floating, unable to tell up from down. He raised a hand to wave in front of his face but couldn’t see it, could only feel it.
Bruce holds back a smile at that. He'd known JARVIS, rather more intimately that the rest of the Avengers most likely, and it's odd to see Vision flirt rather bashfully using JARVIS’s voice. If Vision’s face hadn’t been naturally red, Bruce would bet real money that it would've been be visibly blushing.
?" He finally turned his head to look at T'Challa. There were tear tracks cutting through the congealing blood on his face but his eyes were dry and clear. "I don't know if this is worse. They're still dead. It shouldn't matter, but it does. I can't blame Howard for being with SHIELD and I can't blame mom for supporting that. They made it work. But she didn't have to die. She—They—I memorized the reports."
He’d had a plan, he’d had a whole scenario planned out for them to continue this little game, but he finally had Tony in his arms, after weeks of little to no physical contact, and he couldn’t help how it all went out the window at the feel of Tony’s skin and the sound of Tony’s voice.
“Dad!” Tony calls out and rushes forward with his contraption held high. “Look what I made! It’s a leg brace to help Jarvis. I fit in pneumatic actuators for this hinge mechanism and—“
Tony groaned and threw his head forward, hitting the inside of his helmet. “I know, but I refuse to believe we can’t make a workaround. Selfish bastard,” he added under his breath.
What was it that Certainty Two told him? That anything was possible? Anything, including the things that would hurt him, even if he hadn’t known until just then.
The sight caught him unawares. Tony was beautiful. Every part of Tony was beautiful. Steve knew that. Tony in a suit was magnetic. And Tony, bent forward, ass in the air, his loosened hole open and wet around Steve's fingers, framed by the shimmering fabric of a Tom Ford three-piece two-button suit -- this was the most beautiful sight Steve had ever seen. He plunged his fingers in deep, almost to the knuckle, and Tony jumped, a shout reverberating through the cabin. Steve curled his fingers and started rubbing into Tony's prostate with familair ease, not stopping even when Tony whimpered and clenched tighter and tighter, squeezing Steve's fingers as he tried to hold orgasm at bay.
Steve crawled up to give Tony a small kiss beneath his jaw then lowered himself back down to suck in the tip of Tony's cock without preamble. Tony's hip jumped and a colorful string of curses reached Steve's ears. He snaked an arm under one of Tony's shaking thighs and gripped it tight, holding Tony still. He felt fingers latch onto his hair tightly with no leverage by itself and from this angle.
Tony’s moans became short and breathless, loud and uncontrolled. The tug of the anchor pulled taut and a wave of heat surged up Steve’s palm, settling in his chest at his own heart. It grew tighter and tighter, hotter and hotter, almost agonizing in its intensity. With a final stroke, all the pressure released, and Steve tipped his head forward, mouth open, groaning at the pleasure of the heat swelling and bursting inside him.
Tony shook the visions out of his head. It was one thing to have fleeting intrusive thoughts at random, but those had been entirely too vivid, too
With four hours to go of his entirely arbitrary choice of twenty-four hours, he decided to just screw it all and threw the project out the window. Taking his pants and all the various sensors off permanently, Tony grabbed the lube and a handful of toys, lay back on the cot, and worked himself open with his fingers as he let his mind fantasize.
“Twenty-four hours,” Tony managed to say. “Just. Twenty-four hours. Let me“ —Tony pried Steve’s insistent hands from the release catches on the suit’s torso— “let me see what this is. Let me—let me test it. Give me twenty-four hours. Do some experimenting. Flush it out. You—“
Bracing himself, he flew forward and picked Steve up into his arms in their usual travel style. As he lifted off to take them back to the Tower, he tried his damnedest to ignore how Steve was mouthing the outside of his suit at the collars of his chest plate. He couldn’t feel it but his sensors were telling him the hand Steve had over his shoulders was stroking slowly at the armor plates of his neck. If this were some day in the far future, if they were still together in the far future, he would have landed on the nearest roof and had his way with Steve.
“Masturbating for science,” Tony muttered to himself as he wriggled out of his pants. “Never thought those words would make it out of my mouth again.” Filing away the fantastic mental image of Steve’s mouth and of things going into Steve's mouth, he made sure the biometrics from his finger, wrist, and head were still being read clearly and then got down to business.
T'Challa held up his hand. "The blame lies at Zemo's feet. He will be tried by the system and he will be found wanting. I wish to apologize for the trouble I have caused you in my grief. I was mistaken in my chase for vengeance."
It was funny when Steve thought about it. All his life he'd been admiring the cut of a suit from afar and suddenly it was the 21st century, and he was surrounded by colors and fabrics he'd never even thought could be combined. It wasn't just that. It was that fashion choices were looser, much looser, and he had to put effort into looking for something that wasn't a polo shirt and jeans. It was infuriating. It was eternally frustrating. And it shouldn't be because that wasn't entirely the truth.
He penned a note for Steve then left with a last glance at his Sheriff. He had as much as he needed from Steve. He may want more, but he didn’t need it. All he needed, really needed, was to patch up all the damage his abominable inventions had done to the world.
“I have two prototypes of the new Quinjet in the works. You and Danvers look over the blueprints and test them out when I deliver, yeah? Next month some time. Having trouble getting some materials. The German’s are dicks…”
Three months since Steve had moved on and Tony thought he was doing admirably well. He’d tried, in the first month, to brush up his knowledge of souls,
Stark turned around to face Steve and Steve realized then the futility of reading facial expressions when the other side was wearing giant sunglasses.
Steve laughed, his heart warming at the silly possessive titles. "I'm told I need a firm hand," he said. He bucked up against Tony's weight, watching Tony throw his head back and roll his body with the motion like he was made to ride Steve.
Steve was already out of the shower and halfway to getting dressed when Sam rounds the partition wall of his private locker room. Efficient, their Captain is.
Tony gave extra credit to his excellent self-control after only a dozen dips to a dozen rooftops on the way to his Tower.
He felt a tug somewhere from his chest and the world around him spun. He dropped to his knees, riding the vertigo, and when he opened his eyes again, he was looking at a grey floor. The heat was spreading through his torso and his left arm was entirely numb now. He clenched his jaw against the burning and stood heavily. All around him was an endless grey space with fractals of light appearing here and there, flashing in and out of existence as fast as he could blink.
Steve shifted in his seat, his first movement since he got in the car over half an hour ago. He adjusted his clamped wrists behind his back and turned a little to face Stark.
They sit in silence for a while, sipping from their over-sugary drinks. Bucky studies Steve’s profile. Determination. Not ever backing down, if that set of his jaw and line in his brow is anything to go by. Wilson must have gotten something through to him.
Steve flipped the eggs. They sizzled in the pan. He took a pinch of salt and sprinkled it on. One of the yolks broke as he flipped it again and he held back a sigh.
Jim settles into his own bed and tries and fails to not think of Carol and her laugh and her hair as she flies through the sky.
Or, as Tony finally stood in front of the helicarrier’s Containment Unit, it could take all of the remnants of souls that had ever been captured to date.
After a lovely holiday to an Afghan cave, a personal haunting from one irate former father figure, and a death scare courtesy of the object in his chest that was supposed to have been keeping him away from death, Tony thought he was doing admirably well in living up to his certainties. Certainty One was holding strong. Certainty Two had reversed itself with new evidence but remained on his list as a reminder for himself to never dismiss concepts so offhandedly, that anything was possible. And while he had never been able to summon his parents or Jarvis’s ghost, the subject of Certainty Three might be sitting at the foot of his bed.
“It’s plug and play now, Nat,” Tony says, confirming what Natasha saw of the attachments and what Bucky has told her. “I don’t need to be there.” He turns to look at her. “He trusts you enough to let you fix it on to him for him even though he could do it himself. You take it to him. I need to go help Pepper pick up her pug with Happy.”
Steve is standing in a richly decorated corridor. He studies the dark wooded paneling, the paintings on the wall, the vases on spindle legged tables in the periodic alcoves. The walls were fractured and through the breaks in reality, usual haze of the dreamscape stretches endlessly.
He had an idea of how he must look. Back lit by the lights outside the window behind him, his Captain America uniform was pristine, his hair brushed just so, and everything was just right to Tony’s tastes. He crossed his gloved hands in front of him on the desk and studied Tony, face betraying nothing. He hoped he would get this right.
And afterwards, after coming back to life and fighting off Norman Osborn, Tony wasn’t by his side anymore. They’d come to a tentative truce during their romp through the Nine Realms with Thor but something had changed. Steve couldn’t look at Tony without seeing all that the other man had been willing to throw away over a nonsensical law. And Tony…who knew what Tony was thinking anymore, and how much he really remembered after the brain delete. Tony wouldn’t look at Steve. Tony wouldn’t be near him. Tony no longer spoke to him outside of their Avenging work.
to feel anything other than contempt for it. “I cannot give you Steve. I want to be whole again. Be with my brothers again.”
“That’s all I ask, Shellhead,” she says, then leans in to peck him on the cheek. He accepts with a boyish grin. “And it’s a bulldog. Safe driving.”
Or maybe it was simply because only Steve was always the one closest him in these situations. But then, that was why Iron Man sought Steve out in the first place, wasn’t it? That was why Iron Man was always by Steve’s side, wasn’t it? Because he trusted Steve? Because he was comfortable in Steve’s presence? Steve liked to believe that. Iron Man never cuddled up to anyone else anyway.
Steve nudged his feet off the desk and then pulled a set of keys off the wall. “Law’s the law, Stark, I gotta lock you up till Murdock comes to settle this.” He jerked a thumb at the empty cells lining the back of the room and broke out a roguish grin. “Today’s your lucky day, you get to pick.”
“Because I’m trying to conduct a thorough scientific investigation.” The words left Tony’s mouth in a reflection of his own justifications for denying himself what he wanted.
Steve hadn’t thought much of it but in the time between the second and the first, he might have craved that easy warmth – just a little.
Tony definitely couldn't deny that. "How forward of you. Then what's our 'unfinished business', in your very honest opinion? The raging erections? The soup for brains? That the world lacks a Stark-patented fucking machine?"
Meditation. It didn't work. He couldn't empty his mind and he couldn't focus on any part of his body without immediately veering into fantasizing how it would feel under Steve's tongue. He couldn't keep his breathing even and he ended up panting from the exertion of keeping his hands off himself. So he took to the treadmill, which also didn't work. Running with a boner just wasn't logistical. He tried a few routines at his wooden dummy but he ended up being smacked in the face more than anything. He took one look at 'electroconvulsion therapy' on the list and moved straight on. He took a cold shower again. He imagined licking Steve open under the spray of water. He couldn't take it anymore. He flopped back onto the cot after two hours, buzzing out of his skin with
When Steve finally looked up at him, Tony was ready to burst. “You blew out the back of your shop with just this?” Steve asked.
Tony did think about getting the witch kid to cast the whammy again to conduct a more scientifically rigorous study, this time with oversight from Bruce, but it was probably inappropriate to ask that of a kid who apparently didn't even realize she’d cast a sex spell on anyone else at all; some things Tony just had to let slide onto Xavier’s plate.
Steve gives him an innocent smile. “First impressions. She’s coming over again on Saturday. You should take her to lunch. I hear there’s a new café in town.”
He remembers how he got here. The arc reactor had tugged at him and he had appeared by Tony’s bed in time to see it shine a sickly color. He had reached for it, and had ended up here.
Steve nodded and pushed his hands into the pockets of his jacket. His right fist closed over something and T'Challa knew it was the phone from which Steve had been awaiting a call. As far as T'Challa was aware, the phone had never rung even if the delivery of the package to Stark had been confirmed a week ago. For everyone's sake, he hoped it would ring with the right number shown on it.
Bruce studies the burning Asgardian runes on the concrete in front of him for a moment then turns to head back into the building. He’ll start prepping for a dinner party and then think about maybe staying here for longer. With the family. He smiles and rolls up his sleeves. Family reunion it is, then.
Steve felt the world shatter around him at his word and his already limited senses faded one by one until all he could feel was the shield on his arm. It wasn’t all that bad. It felt like it had, in the ice. The numbness. The darkness. Wasn’t this what he had waiting for him, eventually, if he had stayed as a ghost? Maybe it was better this way, less painful for everyone involved.
Steve felt a little bud of something take root inside him. It was a long forgotten feeling but he knew what it was. It was purpose and it was the desire to take something just for himself. He smiled his best smile - the goofy, toothy smile that he kept untangled from his propaganda smiles. He hoped Stark would like it and he was charmed in turn when Stark returned a small, shy smile so different to the public images plastered all over the media. He wondered what Iron Man would say to that if he was watching this stealthily from a distance.
The PLASM agents nodded in thought but Tony frowned. He still had some questions and tests to run on Cap—Steve. He’s waited decades for this opportunity and he wasn’t going to just see it vanish before him.
Tony was hesitant, like he didn't want all the effort acknowledged, like he didn't think it was as big a deal that it was.  And it was a big deal, in a way. It was Steve's first suit. It had, perhaps, been more formative of Steve's person than the movie ticket stubs that were found inside the pockets. And maybe only Tony knew about that side of him. Maybe only Tony got to experience that side of him considering the way he was starting to wear his beautiful suits more and more. This frayed beige suit can be for the public. For himself, it was never really about what he wore. It had slowly stopped being about what other people wore. These days, he only had eyes for one.
“No?” Sam asks, dodging another drone, this one faster and more agile, having learnt from its fallen comrades.
Tony walked up to the bed, wincing as every step sent a jolt of pain up his arm and to his chest. The Stone in his palm pulsed with heat in time with his heartbeat, stinging the edges of his entire being. He ignored it and looked down at the sight of himself tangled in bed with Steve, fast asleep. Their hair was mussed and the thin sheets left no doubt as to their nakedness.
Bruce steps out of the car and looks up at the Avengers Training Facility. A few extra wings had been added and there were more plants dotting the place, but otherwise it looks much the same as when he was last here a few months ago.
“But maybe we should start from the beginning,” Tony continued, looking away from Steve’s hopeful gaze. “We should start again. As friends.” The armor dissolved around him and Steve was faced with a Tony Stark with rumpled hair, creased shirt, and frumpy slacks – and he was as gorgeous as ever. He shook his head and looked back at Steve. “I can’t—We can’t be together like that with us as we are now. But maybe we’ll get there one day?”
Bruce moves to stand beside Thor as Pietro crosses his arms again, turning back to where Vision and Wanda are floating around the hangar. Thor gives Bruce a puzzled look and Bruce shakes his head hard and gestures covertly between the floating Avengers and Pietro. Thor nods slowly in understanding then mimes zipping his lips. Bruce smiles back with a nod, and thumbs him up for the Midgardian gesture. Thor acknowledges with a toothy grin. They both turn back to looking at the entire scene before them.
, but his case had been the only one that was documented in any detail. There were hints here and there of other Class Fours who had been whole souls but they were old and the evolution of language had not helped with those accounts. He knew he couldn’t have kept Steve roaming in this world, present but not, but he also wondered if there’d been anything else he could have done. Hadn’t Steve bargained with the Stone to revive Tony? Could Tony have done the same for Steve, somehow, without a body? Thor hadn’t known, but surely, Tony could have figured it out?
Tony ejected the laser cartridge and primed a new one. He zoomed in on Clint in his HUD and saw his teammate roll away from a stream of red slime aimed at him. “Clint, if you need a Slime refill, I can put a barrel near you?”
“Of course, sir. Project AESP3-79-89 codenamed Bullshit Very Unscientific Sex Whammy Thing has been created. I’ve also taken the liberty in preparing a shower with a fresh change of clothes at the ready.”
He let go of Tony’s hand and stepped back with all his cards finally open on the table. Whatever Tony decided, at least he would know now that Steve still cared. That Steve still valued their relationship. That Steve still wanted everything they’d once had and maybe even more.
“Look, nothing’s been happening since that Vanko thing. You don’t need to do this. I can deal with it.”
Fourth surprise. There was someone in his bed and they noticed his presence. He groaned, not wanting to deal with anything other than sleep for the foreseeable twelve hours. He tried to express his thoughts to the person but was stopped by a hand behind his neck for the second time today.
The agent looked up, eyes widening as he caught sight of Steve just within the fringes of the yellow light. Steve knew him, had once trained with him in his previous life. He didn’t deserve a name from Steve anymore.
Tony stumbled on a step and laughed when he was caught by the girl, who must’ve been strong if she could hold up Tony. Steve rounded the banister and put one foot up on the stairs.
“You could’ve just disappeared on me,” Tony said. “Surprisingly, it wasn’t something I had planned to experience any time soon.”
“Rhodey, Rhodey, Rhodey,” Tony hisses at him, “did you really just say muffins? As in muffins of the European breakfast variety? Or are you euphemising? You're euphemising. It's a euphemism.”
He continued his walk, looking up the day’s list of search topics – Clifford the Big Red Dog (from Hawkeye), muons (from Iron Man), Godzilla (from Black Widow), Enya (from Bruce, the only one of them without a secret identity)—
Steve closed his eyes again and counted each of Tony’s uneven breaths. He didn’t hate Tony, but he hated what Tony was fighting for. This, him, the greatest casualty of their little War. The time passed in silence again and Steve never mustered up the courage to ask any more questions. To
“On the roof of your tower in this weather? You’ll catch a cold. How about you just catch a movie with me. JARVIS has being queueing up some nice Bollywood films.”
Spengler’s frown deepened and Tony almost took a step back at the intensity of the uncharacteristic scowl. “It’s empty.”
“Watching love-sick young people singing and dancing around a tree. I didn’t peg you for that kind of guy, Cap.”
A thick proton stream fired from the belly mounted canon and hit the Colonel right in its white-shirted chest. Thor, heedless of the massive proton beam, moved in to swing his hammer right into the Colonel’s forehead. The Colonel staggered back one step, tripping on the trip stream Clint had set up, and fell onto its back with a great boom. Clint’s arrows rained in an outline along the Colonel’s body and as the last arrow fell, the pink capture streams formed between them and the arrows and stings already embedded in its body. Tony let loose his missiles and, along with a few remaining arrows of Clint’s and a dozen strikes of lightning in rapid succession, the Colonel’s chest exploded right on top of the Trap.
The first time Steve and Tony kissed, Tony didn’t remember it. It had been more of a clash of teeth, a bump of noses, a warm sliding of tongues. And then Tony had gasped, hiccupped, and blacked out.
Tony was still too coherent. Steve mouthed his way down the side of the shaft. He let his hair catch on the wet skin as he sucked and licked his way to the base then pulled back and took Tony right into his throat with one slide.
An hour of anguish later, he managed to sit up and walk to the workshop bathroom, pretending his hands hadn’t just been involuntarily down his pants moments before. The cold water didn’t help his thoughts one bit but his dick did calm down to a middling hardness and he let JARVIS file that bit of information away. He did not tell JARVIS to pull up the feed from the bedroom where Steve was likely experiencing the same thing. He did not ask if Steve was experiencing the same thing because he didn’t want to hear either of the potential answers.
Steve’s mind stuttered at that and he brought up his other hand to pry Stark’s trailing fingers off his arm. Stark stepped back and withdrew his hand, smiling as if he hadn’t just physically propositioned another man in broad daylight.
T'Challa laughed aloud at that. There was a history between these men, alright. Steve never lost his ability for proper speech until it came to Stark these days. "If you wish to speak with him, phones work both ways."
Steve was reading the evening paper. The dollar was up, and the President had announced a joint peace summit between all the Presidents currently residing in the same temporal space. There was massive backlash, and there was outspoken support. The usual.
A warmth spread through his chest, languid and slow, soothing and safe, and Tony finally closed his eyes to sleep in peace for the first time in years.
Steve sighed and muttered something unintelligible. “Sorry. That didn't come out right. I just." Another sigh. "I didn’t know you thought that way.”
Steve lay back further into his couch and closed his eyes. He heard Tony walk to his armchair and settle down. There was the sound of paper shuffling.
Steve made it his private mission to catalogue Tony's suits. He learned all the different cuts, all the different designers, all the different fabrics, all the descriptive names for the colors and the patterns, all the possible accessories, and he tried to not think about the cost of each bespoke suit. His little notebook was filled with sketches of Tony in suits that probably cost more than Steve's bike ten times over.
The burn was spreading again, his numbed body was now burning like it was doused in molten iron. He shook his head again. He could only shake his head. ”I’m trying to take us back. I’m, it won’t let me. I can’t—“
That startled a laughter out of Steve. It was a little different to their usual vein of talks but this was exactly what he had just been dwelling on. And Steve found that he didn’t mind thinking about the ‘what ifs’ like this, with Tony.
That sentiment lasted until the witch showed up again and blew a giant hole in the side of his precious Tower. She'd only been renovating with her
That startled a laughter out of Steve and he braced a hand on the seat by Tony’s head, the other still held loosely at Tony’s chest. “Moment, Tony. We’re having a moment.”
Five minutes to five and Steve was losing himself in the crowds on the sidewalk. He checked his phone as he walked briskly against the traffic, having no destination but also not wanting to show it.
and she was taking inspiration from his Tower, she said. It was supposedly an accident, she said. Tony was not amused.
Tony was thrown off his feet, landing heavily on his back. There was a heavy pressure at his chest, pressing him into the hard ground but at the same time, he felt he was being pulled upwards, away, out of himself. He scrambled for something to hold on to and his hands found nothing but smooth floor. The Tesseract was still sitting at the opening of the Containment Unit by the dropped shield and Tony fought against the waves of spirits spiralling in gusts around him to reach it at a half-crawl; he had to seal the Unit again, once the Stone had had enough. The light from his chest was now blinding and he squinted his eyes against it, waiting for his moment, one hand on the Tesseract’s container.
Around him, the battle raged on. The sky flashed and the screeches of the Fallen cut through to the bone.
The agent coughed and groaned and grimaced as each movement brought about more pain. A small amount of blood was soaking through the shoulder of the black uniform and the rest was dribbling down his chin as he wheezed. Too bad the blood was necessary.
“Hey now, don’t be,” Tony says gently. “I’d probably move on from being a ghost immediately if I found out I couldn’t have sex until I did.” Tony clears his throat and looks away, cheeks pink. “Which, uh. Yeah. Don’t be sorry.”
The second time Steve and Tony kissed, Steve didn’t remember it. Tony hadn’t meant to, but he held absolutely no regrets for it.
He thought for a moment, arranging his priorities to something more suitable for a talk between friends. “Challenge you all to dodge ball first.” Because it had looked fun when he’d watched the team play.
Steve lets out a short laugh and smiles at the sky, shoulders returning to their usual height and ridiculous width. “You think it's that simple?”
“I am weak. I cannot escape yet. I just want to be whole again. Be with my brothers. One of them is near. I feel him. He is near. Right here. I just want to be—“
When one of the rogues had grabbed a serving girl and pulled her into his lap, Steve had had enough and marched in to break up the gathering. The drunken rogues had not taken Steve’s interference well and Steve had ended up in the middle of a brawl. And just when he had been about to get his head knocked to all Hell on the bar, the man behind him had fallen away with a jerk and a crash and Steve had fumbled himself around to see Tony swaying on his feet, hands wrapped around the shattered legs of a bar stool.
However, T'Challa would do the single favour of turning a blind eye to the prison break Steve had orchestrated a week prior. That part of the Accords also needed amendment. T'Challa had never thought it would have come into play so soon and he would be meeting with Thaddeus Ross in particular in the coming weeks and months to straighten out the proposed changes.
about this first, before anything else. Why hadn’t Steve told him about this? Around the table, he saw Thor’s expression of sympathy, Hill was swiping through her tablet, and Clint and Natasha had both looked away, heads hanging. Had they known?
"Justice will," T'Challa answered evenly. He lowered himself to the ground beside Stark and placed his helmet between them, facing them. Two armored men; two prematurely ascended heirs to vast empires; two people who could have fallen into a downward spiral of revenge because of their vices. In another lifetime, they could have been friends. Perhaps they still could.
He wiped the tears from his face, smiling at the fading light and the silhouette of the man he loved fading with it.
With that, Steve was dragged away from the blond man and his bodyguards. He almost tripped over himself as Stark continued to drag him off toward Grand Central. Toward Stark Tower to be precise, Steve realized.
“Will you let me in? Put us both out of our misery? I want you. I’ve always wanted you, all of you, and I always will. I'll always be here for you.”
Steve opened his eyes and looked at Star—Tony properly for the first time since his incarceration. There were lines on his face where there shouldn’t be. The set of his shoulders were from more than just pain, and his stillness was a jarring contrast to the animated antics of the man Steve had in his memories.
Steve grinned back and shook his head. “Nope,” he said, popping the P. “Everyone needs to get at least one bruise.”
Steve looked away from Tony and tried to recall the night, but all he could see in his mind was the silhouette he’d thought was Tony, the weight of the body above him, the barest brush of cold lips, and most of all the disappointment that followed when the weight left him with a barely audible mumble of an apology. And nothing had ever been acknowledged. Until now.
Steve’s phantom heart skipped a beat. Tony’s eyes flicked towards him and Steve could see the nervousness in the tightness at the corners. It was endearing to see Tony being nervous for anything at all, because of Steve. That humbled him, just a little, but he smiled back. It was what he wanted, after all. “I’d like that,” he said. And smiled wider when he finally saw a small quirk at the corner of Tony’s mouth.
And Tony broke into a fit of laughter again, choking slightly on the tickling in his throat and doubling over at the pain in his stomach. He swiped at his cheeks with his palm and tried once again to control himself. When he was no longer gasping for breath he turned around and studied Steve’s face, now lit by the dim light from the corridor.
“You of all people should know how important it is to do the right thing, Captain,” Pepper says. She sniffs audibly and Steve feels an inch tall. “I was hired to do this job and regardless of whether I like it or not, I’m keeping the company afloat and I intend to keep it that way and I won’t let Tony wreck himself and everything this company is supposed to stand for.” She blinks the tears from her eyes and walks away into the haze, the sound of her shoes clicking and fading.
. The world around him vanished at his thought and he swayed forward, almost dropping to his knees. His entire left arm was agonising, crackling in heat and pain from holding the Stone but he continued to ignore it, searching around him.
Clint’s head was pounding like the ruckus of an underground fight club. He rummaged through the freezer for something cold and his hands closed over a bag of peas. Good enough. He extracted the peas, hoping Jarvis wouldn’t kill him in the morning, and plonked it onto the side of his face to ward off the swelling and pain.
“I think we can both see that she’s open to being interested. If you feel like you can, go ahead, Buck. It’s been a year. And Bruce will understand.”
And Steve lets out a strangled sort of moan and closes his eyes briefly and, oh God, they’re still pressed really tightly together and, oh Lord, Bruce should not be thinking about why that is.
“You killed us,” the young man rasps out through his burnt throat. “You promised to protect us but you killed us!” He lunges at Tony and they fall against a tombstone with a crack. “Let me have you!”
Steve chuckled, letting his fingers roam in a random pattern of caresses. Tony groaned again, louder, neck baring. “We’ll try that next time,” Steve promised.
Pietro nods but doesn’t take his narrowed eyes off of Vision and Wanda, who are now both circling around the ceiling out of earshot.
Tony gasped and squeezed his eyes shut. There was a warm feeling flooding his body, emanating from his chest, the arc reactor. As he stood, he felt a tightening, like a small pressure there and it raced long his veins in a wave of heat. His eyes shot open and he stared down at his chest, only to see Steve’s hand disappearing right through the chestplate, straight into Tony’s body underneath, into his arc reactor.
Steve nods, blinks once slowly and then starts laughing. And laughing harder. And Tony couldn’t help it – he joins in.
Ninetieth, hundredth, thousandth time, over the many years and years, Steve never counted but he could remember every single time he woke with a crick in his neck which was rendered negligible by the peaceful sight of Tony’s cheek pressed to his chest. It made sense now why Iron Man had always been so tired; he’d been living two full lives and never shirked his duties for either. And if he could find rest by Steve’s side then it was the least Steve could do to help.
Tony wiped at his mouth with a napkin, avoiding Natasha’s piercing gaze. “Might’ve been Vanko,” he muttered. “He didn’t register on JARVIS’s sensors either, otherwise the alarm would’ve woken me.”
“It was still nice,” Steve continued. Subjectively nice, of course. Objectively, it had been terrible.
And there is an audible pop as Tony and Steve disengage their lips and look around in unison to where Bruce and Thor are standing in the corridor.
He was developing a routine and all in all, he felt better about his half-existence, especially when he was surrounded by people who dealt with ghosts all year around and never batted an eye at his transparency.
They sat in companionable silence before Tony spoke again. “Answer me this. What would you do if you were solid? If, in the New Year, the Universe decided that you being ethereal was a crime to humanity and snapped its fingers and made you corporeal, visible to all?”
Beyond the planet around him, Tony could see pinpricks of light from far away, at the edges of the galaxy, the universe. He screwed his eyes against the rush of distances and focused back on to Earth, to New York. As promised, the Stone stopped summoning more to the world and Tony could see many of the fainter glows vanish.
Jim snorts. “Man, you know age isn’t a thing. And he’s turning 32. Or 98, depending on how you want to count it. He’s either a big boy or almost a centenarian.”
Clint nodded, still nursing his coffee. He turned to Steve with a squint. “You sure you didn’t appear just to scare off old Vanko from snuffing out Stark?” And then he yelped when someone, Natasha probably, kicked him under the table. Tony was starting to enjoy seeing her fight his fights for him.
When Tony had been at MIT, two heads shorter and three shades angrier than everyone else present, his second certainty had shattered. A giant marshmallow man had walked the streets of New York and though Tony hadn’t been present, Howard had. And for all of Howard’s failings as a father, he was the source of Tony’s scientific foundation and Tony would not turn away evidence when presented with it. The same thing had happened again, a few years before his parents had died. The damned
Steve backhanded the agent and frowned in distaste at the four bloody gouges newly opened on the man’s face. He didn’t like the blood.
There was a loud, ear-splitting screech as one of the creatures expired. Steve screwed his eyes shut, ears ringing, but the screech was immediately followed by a cacophony of louder, angered screeches and the sky burned brighter.
Tony cursed under his breath. “I have state of the art facilities at the Tower. If you’d just authorize a damned Containment Unit there—“
Steve might not have known who Iron Man was or what Iron Man looked like back then. Steve might not have known the details of Iron Man’s private life or even his real name, but when Iron Man’s head had dipped onto his shoulder after a long debriefing, he’d thought none of that really mattered. He’d pulled his chair closer to Iron Man’s, waved the rest of the Avengers off, and let the Golden Avenger sleep on his shoulder with a gauntlet resting palm-up atop his thigh.
Tony breaks off from Steve’s lips, mouth following his fingers down Steve’s neck and to his collarbones. He looks up, taking in Steve’s red, swollen lips, and licks wetly at his own. “Round Five?”
that had been missing from all of Tony’s equations for the operation of the Containment Unit, spread its cosmic glow through the crystalline walls of the Unit. The same glow that was within the Traps they’d used. Through the glow, Tony could see a shadow of the miasma of captured spirits, frenzied and unable to escape. The seal of the door hissed as Tony spun it open. He slid the container for the Tesseract gently from its hold and kept it in place, holding up Steve’s shield towards it. It flared iridescent, as if it knew its brother was near but nothing happened.
The sky continued to be blue and the drive continued to be smooth. And Stark continued to pretend that they had been anything but the best of friends and something more.
He pats Tony on the back as Tony bemoans how Steve had rejected him and they never had their movie marathon. Jim knew for certain that Tony only emailed a list of movies (compiled by FRIDAY) to Steve with only a smiley face and a “y/y?”. Steve had replied with a thanks and… apparently that had been it.
Tony continued to breathe through his teeth, then glared at one of the ceiling cameras when JARVIS’s response was not forthcoming.
His jaw refused the movement required to complete his sentence because this was the most undressed Steve had ever seen of Tony, and he’d watched the man sleep before.
Before long, Small Tony’s eyes droop, so much like his Adult counterpart, and then his head lolls and he’s fast asleep. Steve brushes away a strand of unruly hair from Tony’s face, smiling. Tony’s earnest inquisition hasn’t changed – the papers may still talk down Tony but Steve doesn’t care.
to do it, sure, but the same could be said for most of the men and women who had been part of the war effort. They weren’t shipping him off to sell war bonds and dance with USO girls anymore in this peaceful time but he might as well be if it would get him out of this bubble of isolation he’d found himself in.
Steve looked unconvinced and he reached up to press at Tony’s chest in response to the thump. “I don’t want to lose anyone on my—“
Iron Man liked to cuddle against Steve when he was tired. There was no other word for it; Iron Man cuddled.
The hardness in Steve's pants from the fight aboard the train now returned for an entirely different reason. He leaned forward and rested his chin upon his arms atop Stark's knees, thinking.
They turn the corner to the stairs leading to the Avengers recreation floor. A few Agents walk by and Bruce nods to them in greeting.
Steve let out a growl and tried to focus on anything else but the dull throbbing in his pressure-wrapped knee.
He found that his phone was back in his hand as he continued to walk aimlessly through the streets; he was quickly adopting the 21
Steve leaned in, letting the light catch the sharp lines of his brows and cheek, his nose. His curled lips as he smiled at the agent. “Last. Chance.”
“I was just claiming my territory” Tony says breezily, then adds, voice adopting the lilt of David Attenborough, “In nature, the urge to claim territory is ingrained in almost every animal. It is a strong urge, one that must be—“
“Come home with me,” Steve whispered into the back of Tony’s neck. He massaged at Tony’s thighs and hips with his dry hand, and pressed at Tony’s belly where he thought he could feel himself still pressed deep inside. “I’ll clean you up, take you to bed, then we can make love till whenever you want, however you want.” He pressed the promise in a kiss to Tony’s skin. “Come home to me.”
Steve turns around to face them with a straight back, an arm around Tony’s shoulders and a hand under Tony’s thigh. Tony twists in Steve arms but doesn’t appear to be letting go any time soon.
Tony had stilled and was limp on top of him, draped as if they were in bed on a lazy Sunday morning that Steve would never experience again. Steve wished it would rain; he wanted the cover, the mask of wetness on his face as an excuse. He wanted his arms unbound, he wanted to hold Tony to him, sooth him, lie to him and tell him he’d make the sacrifice worth everything. He pressed his cheek to the curls of Tony’s hair above his ear and whispered all the things he’d left unsaid between them. His heart pumped the last of its blood, mingling the last flows of his and Tony’s life together as Tony’s name passed between his lips one final time.
“Well good. I’d need to be carted off to the crazy house if I had to live through what you describe happens every night. ”
Steve’s existence didn’t revolve around Tony, and of course Steve would want to move on. Steve was dead. Steve was a ghost. Steve was a ghost just
“Think about your next answer,” Steve said. He sat back into the chair and crossed one leg over the other, hands clasped, waiting.
Tony finally disentangled himself and staggered away. He found himself in a corner, cursed his sleep-addled brain, and tried to blink the grogginess from his eyes to focus ahead of himself.
“We’re sorry, Steve,” Natasha said. She stowed her Pistols and smiled at Steve. “Everyone and everything’s been trying to kill Tony lately and we’re all a little on edge.”
They’d just worked out this thing between them and then this had happened. Oh, God. He’d lost Steve. He’d had Steve.
“Or I would tell you what you want to hear because you’re dreaming that you’re lucid dreaming?” Steve suggests, still thrown by this turn of events.
It was in the way Tony let Steve thumb the vulnerable inside of his wrist, in the way he wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck, fire and determination leading his lips, offering himself by giving and giving; the way Steve took and took, letting his mouth be mapped and stroked until the heat broke through the numbness and he pushed back, violent and sharp.
“I can’t believe I’m saying this,” Clint’s voice came through the comms, “but I think I’m off fried chicken. Forever.” There was a boom and an explosion of pink light at Colonel Sanders’ feet, where the giant two-storey chicken was circling. The chicken fell over with a crash, flattening a small kebab stand, but rolled to its feet in the next moment with a deafening squawk. Tony added another item to his List of Compensations.
“We both know what to do,” he says, holding Steve’s gaze, “and we’re both going to go do it, right?”
“Yup,” Clint said across from him. “We scanned the hell out of him while you were doing your rich man morning routine. The prelim ID checks out. Definitely a Class Four, and Full Torso even, but somehow zip on paranormal energy signatures. Your toaster put out more P.K.E. on the Meter than Cap here. We even zapped him with Natasha’s Pistols. Nada. He’s going into the special cases. Maybe the Full Imprint category. Or Wandering Souls?” Clint gestured widely with his mug. “And I’m going to need to tell Fury to make a better name for these. It gets confusing.”
He wondered why of all their disagreements over the decade they’d known each other that the war over Registration had been the straw. Had it merely been one too many? Had it been because of Extremis? Had it been Tony who pulled away? Or had it been Steve? Steve didn’t know. And as he watched the receding back of Iron Man after having destroyed the Gauntlet, Steve realized he could have just lost one of the most important relationships in his life over matters that could have been avoided if they’d only
Tony sat in silence for a full minute, hand still rubbing absently along the surface of the arc reactor. The only light from the room was from the small lamp by Tony’s bed on the other side of the room, and Tony’s massaging movement was flashing the blue light of the reactor on and off like a beacon.
Steve sits to pull on socks with his back to Sam but Sam can sense the eyes directed momentarily at the ceiling. “Sam, I’m flattered, but you know I only see you as a friend—“
) repeated, drawing closer still. “Anywhere I want to go. And I want to go to Coney Island. Just the two of us. I’ll win you a bear and buy you cotton candy.”
Steve nudged Stark's nose with his own. "You're no damsel, Stark," he said softly. He planted a firm hand on Stark's chest and moved down to finally –
century technology, showing him the ins and outs of navigating the internet until Steve was a deft hand at it himself. It was also from Iron Man that Steve learnt little bits of computing and electronics so he could pick out the little bugs SHIELD liked to plant on and around him. And Iron Man was the one who would sit by Steve in his heavy armor and throw out light conversation and useful advice as Steve fixed up his motorcycle after many an Avenger’s mission.
The blond turned his sharped blue-eyed gaze onto Steve and Steve felt himself being assessed like a piece of meat at the butchers.
The men keep pushing Tony down, calling him names, laughing, throwing water at Tony’s chest and the battery.
bared its teeth, expression almost feral on its borrowed features. “What makes you think he can be revived?”
The Stone was in his power now. He could just, will this away, will Steve out of it. He grasped tighter to the Stone and
Tony was both very relieved and very annoyed. He didn't know what he'd expected from Steve after his bullshit ramble. He’d deflected like a champ. But he'd also had a chance, maybe, to explain himself properly and he probably blew it. Steve had left without a word, without saying his piece. Tony didn’t even have the mental acuity to worry about that.
“It looks like Mister Stark will have to pay a visit to replenish our drone stocks,” came Wanda’s voice.
century standards – all neons and chromes and straight lines and noise. The cars were sleek and rounded and grounded and nothing like the cars Howard had demonstrated and certainly nothing like the cars of the future in the books Steve had read as a kid.
After meeting Peggy, after Doctor Erskine, getting his new body, joining the war, finding Bucky again, losing Bucky, and as he had stared into the ice as it had rushed towards him, he’d suddenly known what he had wanted to do with his life after the war, in the future. It was when you were staring death in the eyes as you met it head on that you realized what you had truly wanted out of life and he had wanted a life with Peggy. It had been his one regret in that moment: that he had waited. He’d closed his eyes to the sound of Peggy’s voice and he’d fallen into the unknown abyss that had been death.
Tony shouldn’t even be the one escorting him to his new cell, shouldn’t even be out of bed. Tony should be afraid of him. Tony should hate him—probably did hate him. Once upon a time, Steve would have kissed the injuries away amid playful protests. He would have doted and pampered and laughed and touched. They would have talked, argued, talked more, and come to an understanding.
“What would it take,” Steve gritted out, “to make you put Tony back. Revive him. And then stay away from him.”
Steve huffed. Of course. Old habits. He gave Tony one last peck on the lips then moved down to his intended target. Tony's cock was straining against the blue wool of his pants and Steve didn't know if he wanted to see it leaking for him or to taste it leaking for him. Likely both, he thought.
How? It was Steve, wasn’t it? It was definitely Steve Rogers. Captain America. Did SHIELD find his body? Did they always have his body? Why couldn’t he remember Tony? Did his memories not carry over to his body, or had it never been the real Steve that Tony had spent time with? Maybe it had never been real—
Tony was still in the armor, the new one. It was sleek and organic, like nothing Steve had seen before, and he hadn’t had time to admire it in action as he usually did. It had always been Tony who’d been eager to tell Steve all about the ‘newest doohickeys’. Tony didn’t do that anymore.
Natasha sits back and watches the small buildings give way to trees and grass as they chatter about the lighter sides of their lives.
And with the, the comm clicks off. Sam bites back the hundred questions that just erupted in his brain and shakes his head. Rhodey’s business is his own, but if Sam had any say, he’d better have gone off to see Colonel Danvers for a good old fashioned flying session with the Quinjets.
Tony had been out by the old well, as per usual, and half a bottle of something strong was already fuming up the air around him. Steve had sat with Tony, holding him upright when he needed to, and Tony never said a word, right up until he fell asleep on Steve’s shoulder. Steve had carried him back to town. And he never asked about it the next morning. Or the day after. Or ever. Steve hadn’t needed to.
Sam leans on the prep bench and silently appreciates the praise. He picks at his goggles while Steve looks for fresh socks. “So, thought more about that café?”
For someone who played hide-and-seek with his emotions even more than Tony did at times, Steve was almost like a bloodhound with these things. Tony braced himself and spit the truth out in one breath.
Okay. Third surprise. Facial hair. Not Jess. He was up for some fun with Jess but this, he hadn’t signed up for.
Trust Steve to politely ask for more jerk-off material. Tony turned back to his screens and valiantly withheld from pulling up the video feed of the hallway outside. He still couldn’t help pulling his pants down to grab a hold of himself even as he read over the theories JARVIS had compiled. Everything about animal heats, the pharmacology and physiology of aphrodisiacs, and the feasibility of modern humans responding to pheromones. It was dry, it was too scientific, and he couldn’t be more turned on by the thought of Steve touching himself to his voice on the other side of the wall. He wondered if Steve was still wearing his Captain America gear, if his biceps were straining and bulging through the sleeves as they flexed and extended. He wondered if Steve would like it rough and fast. He wondered if Steve would like it gentle and slow.
As it was, he was now standing on the landing pad, ready to bid a final farewell to Steve. The Dora Milaje had wanted to accompany him but he denied them their presence. Steve was a stubborn man, but in the past fortnight, T'Challa had grown to admire the man's integrity. He trusted Steve with his life, if not with his country nor any political landscape.
What had Steve tried? Surely he’d tried giving himself a handjob. But what else? Did he pull up images to help? Did he pull up videos? Videos of Tony? Sexy videos of Tony? Did he put anything inside himself? Fingers? A toy? Did Steve own any toys? Tony owned toys. Tony owned many toys. Tony wouldn’t mind sharing those toys with Steve, not at all, if it meant they could play with them togeth—
He stepped through the bedroom door and sat on the ground with his back to the door. He heard the bathroom door open again and tried to not focus on the sounds of Tony getting dressed.
It took more sawing than Steve would have liked to free Stark's ankles. He tucked his knife away and sat back on his haunches to watch as Stark stretched his legs and rolled his ankles to put the blood back into them.
Tony was lounging in the two-seater, foot up on knee, hands spread over the back of the couch. His armor was the silver of madness. The smirk on his face was incongruous with the desperate tone of voice in Steve's ear. Steve looked away, towards the window where the sky was darkening.
A few moments later, his dick gave a twitch as it tried to harden again. Steve, on the other hand, was more than a little bit hard. It appeared that he’d missed out on quite a lot with Steve and it was presenting an interesting problem.
“You’re friends with the man, if not exactly in physical contact with him“ —Steve chokes, and Sam files the response away for further digging— “but you guys click so well in the field, even when he’s never been part of any of our training sessions. Don’t you think that shows something? Other than the hours you both probably logged on the phone.”
Steve drains his can and reaches for another one. He cracks it open and then draws in a breath for another sigh—
“Thank you, FRIDAY,” Natasha says. The boys mumble around her. She hears “pathetic pining” from at least two of them. She agrees wholeheartedly. With both sentiments. But this has to be done.
“I never really thanked you properly for your help with the sleeping thing,” Tony said, aiming for cheer and nonchalance. “So, uh, thanks. For having to literally fight off my past. Keeping me alive. And don’t worry about the accidental dream adventures.” He gestured vaguely at the arc reactor. “I should thank
Clint grinned at Steve. “Then welcome to the twenty-first century. We also have a Hulk and a Norse God.”
“Thor remains off-planet. The Hulk has not yet returned to headquarters but he appears to be functioning within normal parameters – he is currently posing for photographs with tourists in Central Park as reported by no less than five networks. I am happy to inform you that Agents Barton and Romanoff have alighted at the Landing Bay ten minutes prior to this minute. They no longer appear to be under an unknown influence, as you or Captain Rogers appear to be. They have asked me to pass on a message. Shall I play it?"
Steve leans back into his seat and groans, back of his hand over his eyes. He mouths something Bucky can’t make out but Bucky reaches over all the same, metal hand patting consolingly on Steve’s knee.
Outside the lab, he swiped his phone over the access panel and watched as it cycled through lines of codes only to beep red. He frowned and tried it again. Red. Strange. He brought up the access controls for the doors on his phone just as the intercom from the lab clicked on.
There was a flush rising on Steve's face and T'Challa refrained from further comments. This was not strictly his business, but perhaps they would be happier if he could prompt one of them into extending a hand.
Spengler held up the Trap. “SHIELD is thorough and funds well. And technically I’m contracted under PLASM. What did you do with the Trap?”
“Just ask him out for burgers or something, oh my God, Steve,” Bucky exclaims, cutting in before the Epic Pining Sighs can truly begin.
“Gave it a little boost, then used it to find you,” Tony said cheerfully. The Stone shuddered in his grasp again, and Tony willed it to
It was simple enough to transform thought to action and he had Tony's back plastered to his front, right hand pulling Tony closer to him by the stomach, the left smoothing the creased fabric over the curve of Tony's ass in the scant space between their bodies. Tony kept talking, barely a hitch in his breath, and Steve took it as a challenge. He nibbled along Tony's ear and took to sucking the skin at the base of Tony's neck as he undid the buttons of Tony's waistcoat one by one.
Steve hadn’t seen Tony bare-chested before, front on, sure. When they’d conducted their little experiments to check Steve’s anchor, Tony had always turned his back to change the arc reactor in and out. But Tony looked exactly as Steve had imagined he would look, and Steve had seen similar injuries before. He could have pieced together the state of Tony’s chest by the stories Tony told alone. It was a part of Tony, Tony’s turning point in life. The arc reactor was the thing that kept Tony alive if not exactly perfectly healthy - Steve’s
Steve was standing with his back to him, just ahead, and Tony shuffled forward, feet heavy. The numbness was spreading down his torso and to his legs now, and he stumbled as his vision flashed dark for an instant.
Tony pocketed his phone and held up his hands. “I got lost. Spengler here found me.” He dropped his hands slowly and looked around the room. “You never stipulated a time for the meeting so I can’t be held accountable for missing the start. And where’s Steve?”
Steve took one step forward and heard a gasp. Ahead of him, Tony turned back, a real terror in his eyes, and lunged.
“Done deal,” Tony said, now grinning. He shifted closer to Steve and Steve would’ve felt the warmth from the proximity if this had been a dream. Tony fidgeted with his hands and Steve wanted to feel the motion beneath his own. “I have a favor to ask.”
“Like what you see Rhodey-bear?” Tony says, mock sly grin on his face. He takes off his glasses with the flourish of Tony Stark, Playboy Billionaire™ and Jim resists rolling his eyes. “I have a room just up the—ow!”
Natasha and Barnes pass by, apparently heading to the gym for a joint sparring session. Bruce looks on as they walk out together, shoulders touching. He’s just glad she’s happy.
and they went down on the ground in a heap with Steve straddling on top. He pressed the edge of the shield to the
The tightness in his pants now returned in full force and Steve moaned softly as he shifted his weight off his sore knees. The hand in his hair left after a minute and Steve nuzzled into the warmth of Tony's belly, framed by Tony's legs and hugging tight onto Tony's waist. His cock was still achingly hard in his pants.
Steve was hot, there was no doubt about it. But something about Captain America bending him over and fucking into him in full uniform did things to Tony's heart that couldn't be healthy. Something about shoving Captain America against a wall and taking that uniform off piece by piece while he remained in the fully powered Iron Man suit—he plunged his fingers harshly into himself, thrust once, twice, into the slick grip of his fist, and came all over the sheets with a yell.
“Because I was standing next to and looking at Thor when it happened and my first thought was still of you,” came the reply without pause.
There was another man standing at the conference table. The man’s back was to Tony, but Tony had been studying the back of that head of blond hair for nigh on a year and he would be damned to the tenth circle of hell before he could forget the sight of it. There was also a round shield on his back – white star on a blue field with concentric circles of red and white around it.
Tony buzzed another circle around the blob and it groaned at him. Facing its leading edge, he fired off a proton shot at it. It wriggled and shot a wad of red slime at him. He dodged it and shot its back. The blob wobbled and gurgled but continued to attempt a road crossing. Tony watched as one of Clint’s arrows flew through the air and embedded itself on top of the blob. A wave of protonic energy washed over the blob and it shuddered, ceasing its forward progress.
"Nothing to be sorry for,” Steve murmured, a hand moving to cradle the back of Tony’s head. “It’s not all your fault. And I like it when we talk."
The enti—Captain Ameri—Cap nodded, a quirk appearing on his translucent lips. “Steve Rogers, at your service.”
Tony stared at it then took it. He pulled out a cord from his gauntlet and plugged it into the Meter, then plugged the Meter into the port in the Trap, setting it to a broad detection of ethereal energies. His own scans and the Meter came back with zero, no equipment malfunction as far as he could tell. Tony looked up at Bruce and tilted his head in question. Bruce shrugged. The trap was empty.
It had been a playful phrase between them, once. Another thing sullied by this entire War between supposed heroes. Steve could help himself and help Tony – he knew Sam and Bucky were the greatest thorns in Tony’s side out there right now – but he wasn’t a liar and he wasn’t going to let Tony make him one.
Steve laughed and Tony hung on tight for the ride as they made their way over to the makeshift cot at the back of the workshop, where they could enjoy each other at a more leisurely pace.
Clint kicked the Trap and earned a glare from Natasha. “Weird,” Clint said. “But by ‘we’, Bruce means you, Stark. No one here wants to deal with Richards’ lot.” He looked around at all of them. “Okay I take it all back. I want fried chicken. Let’s go to that place just opened on 36
Steve snaps out of his shock and in one swift movement, he kicks the tank of water away, letting it slide across the dirty floor to burst soundlessly against the rocky walls. He catches Tony as he falls but Tony pushes him away, coughing, and suddenly, the scene renews.
“And you message Cap and Rhodes every hour of every day like the hip young people you are but we still miss you.” She gives his hands a squeeze and lets go, sitting back again.
When he was satisfied, Stark rearranged himself, legs bent at the knee, looking more like a carefree man sunning himself. He wriggled his hips then raised an eyebrow at Steve and twisted his remaining bound wrist in askance.
He gasped and almost fell to his knees. It was wholesome, like being filled in all his empty spaces, but it was unlike anything Tony had ever felt. It was like being freed to fly and being wrapped in warm arms at the same time. It was like hearing the helicopters fly to him over the sand dunes of the desert. Like Rhodey closing his arms around his burnt and battered form. Like sitting back into his car with Pepper at his side, Happy taking him where ever he wanted to go. Like his mother’s hugs, his father’s goddamn approval of his entire being. He wanted more.
Steve clicked his tongue again and sat back, his toe nudging at the agent’s knee. “You know what that answer gets you.”
Tony woke to the sound of Steve’s voice. Tony screamed to the Heavens as he shot at the man who had felled Steve. Tony took himself away from the pen, from where Steve was no longer with him. Tony sunk deep into his mind and bared his broken soul for selling. Tony picked up his hammer with one goal. Tony had a new purpose. Tony would burn the world to drag the men who took Steve from it down with him to the deepest pits of Hell.
As he reached for the single cup of steaming coffee that sat in the middle of the island, Natasha nudged a glass of water at him and gave him a very pointed look. Tony sighed and gulped half down before returning the look.
. There was still that tingling under his skin, and an easy hardness in his pants whenever his thoughts veered anywhere near Steve. His hands were now shaking even when his body was too spent to do anything other than shiver and sweat with desire.
Steve chose to ignore how close to home the first sentence from Tony hit him and chose instead to address the rest. “I’m not kicking you off the team. And you’ll always be Iron Man to me. This is about something more personal. Just, us. I want to talk about us.” He saw the slight shift of armor before Tony moved to stand, facing Steve with that impersonal face plate.
“Nay!” Thor’s voice came through the comms. “Do not strain yourself, good Doctor. This foe is on his last legs and I’m certain we’ll capture it oomph—“
The first time Tony cuddled against Steve, eyes bright and lucid, the two of them knowing exactly what it was they had between them, Steve thought himself the happiest man in the world.
She gives him a significant look as he hands her the case outside the Avengers compound. This is closer than he had ever come to the compound since the day Bruce had returned to them. His grin is more strained now but he looks between her and the case and Natasha waits for the bad joke.
Steve remembered the way the Iron Man gauntlet had been crushed between his fingers. There hadn’t been blood and he hadn’t heard a scream from the thrown back helmet. Steve had wanted that faceplate up, then. He had wanted to feel Tony’s flesh give way beneath his fist. He had tried to pry Tony out of his shell using his hands and his shield. Tony had always been stronger than him in the armor and Steve knew all the vulnerable points to hit. It should have made him stop, when Tony hadn’t fought back even before his armor had been battered and showing more man than machine. He hadn’t stopped. He should have.
Steve couldn’t object. Steve wouldn’t object. Steve might have jumped too fast head first into his confession and this was the best outcome he could have hoped for. They were once again setting out on the same path, traversing the same life together, side by side. It was all Steve had ever wanted.
Steve sighs pointedly and takes a drink from his newly opened can. He gives Bucky a sidelong look. Bucky doesn’t like what’s coming next, if he’s reading Steve’s expressions correctly—
It was approaching winter and this was the third call-out for a Class Seven Other Dimensional Entity this month, approximately three more than the usual number of Class Seven cases. The team had started to get a little tired of constantly hearing Fury’s call-out sirens. After a sloppy mission which had resulted in a flattened art museum for only a Class Five haunting, Fury had decided to hand off the lower class paranormal disturbances to the smaller support teams of PLASM and reserved the Avengers for city-levelling paranormal activity.
Clint lowered his ion wand fractionally but Natasha kept her proton pistols aimed steadily at Cap’s chest. The both of them looked towards Tony.
“Jarvis’ leg has been hurting him,” Tony begins. He shuffles some papers around and out of nowhere, produces a crude contraption recognizable to Steve as a leg brace bristling with wires. “I had to spend a whole month learning about electromyography but the brace is all done now.” He holds the contraption out to Steve, excited. “I can fix Jarvis’s leg. I just need to calibrate it to Jarvis.”
The layout of the city was more or less the same with many new buildings abutting the once familiar skyline, but everything else was so different.
Thor claps Bruce hard on the shoulder and Bruce stumbles forward a step before being righted by a pair of strong hands around his upper arms. “My apologies, Bruce!” Thor says, and Bruce brushes it off with a wave of his hand. “But yes I will lend you my services for this worthy endeavor.”
Steve’s shield was on ground a little ways off and Tony staggered towards it, picking it up and glancing around for any sign of Steve. As his fingers closed over the shield, he felt a prickle of heat at his fingertips, rising up his arms to settle in his chest. He thought he heard a chuckle and he stared down at the shield just in time to see a green glow vanish, the same green hue as the light he’d seen when he’d Trapped the blob just earlier in the day.
A handful of the prison’s guards marched up toward them from the compound and moved to surround Steve. Tony held up a hand as one approached with another set of cuffs and something that looked like a collar. “Can you give us a minute,” he said in their direction. “Two, tops.”
in this new world. He’d made friends who’d treated him like a normal human being, and maybe that had been the problem all along.
Tony looked at the clock. It was early in the morning. ‘Night’ was over. He was, by technicality, a free man. “Alright, Steve, I’ll come by tomorrow after I’ve finished the shed and sign your papers for you to file.” He straightened his coat and felt at the hidden contraption under his sleeve. He’ll refine it. He has to.
As Tony continued to stand by the doorway with his jaw slacken like a fool, the man turned around and one - solid - Steven Rogers stood to face Tony with an open but neutral expression. There was no recognition in those blue eyes. There was none of the amusement. None of the glinting playfulness. None of
and Steve hoped Tony was feeling the same. He squeezed his hand closed again and Tony moaned high and beautiful, back arching, one hand scrambling on the seat at his hips, the other clenched by his head at Steve’s other hand.
"—and I…needed you to be honest with me.” Tony heard him take a deep breath. “I don’t want us doing anything we’ll regret. I’m sorry I left. We're going to talk. This time I’m not leaving until we do. I know there's more to it than just 'doing it of our own accord'. You've been avoiding this for a while. Tony, please. Talk to me."
A chorus of “Aye-aye, Captain” sounds through the comms and the team refocuses on the Target of the Day.
And as time went on, so did the iterations of the Iron Man armor. There were sharper edges, thicker layers, more components, and fancier instruments added to the armor. The sleekness of memory metals gave way to metal alloy plates. In that time, they worked together like a well-oiled machine but they had their share of fights. Iron Man was always open with his opinions, and the two of them challenged each other, sometimes to not so happy ends. Some nights, Steve would sit in the library or living room of the mansion and wait. Some nights, Steve would be alone, and he would tell himself he didn’t want those sharp plates pressing into his side anyway. Some nights, Iron Man would show at the door with a clunk of metal boots, pause, and then stride in as if Steve couldn’t read the hesitancy in those metal shoulders. Sometimes, one of them would apologize. Sometimes, they would talk heatedly long into the night, but Steve knew he was forgiven if he woke with metal tucked into his neck and a red and gold arm around his midriff. And he couldn’t help but forgive Iron Man then. They always reconciled their differences.
Tony stared at Steve, the dust from the earlier fight yet to settle around them. “You can touch the arc reactor?” Tony began again, slowly.
Tony rubbed at his face and tried to not yell. “I’m his son. Anthony Stark. Tony, to you, if you’re into the whole name calling shtick.”
Steve ran his Secret Avengers, kept an eye on the premier Avengers team, and he let himself reminisce. It wasn’t the same. The Avengers used to be a family. Maybe they still were, but Steve wasn’t there to be a part of it. He ignored the way Tony stole glances at him. He ignored the way Tony would linger after their brief Avengers meetings. He ignored the way Tony couldn’t decide whether to use his first name or his last name to address him. He couldn’t read into it because it would all be wishful thinking and projection.
“What do you feel from it?” Natasha asked. Tony continued to cough egg out of his throat and she reached around to slap at his back. He gave her a grateful smile and tried to breathe as he processed Steve’s words.
stop me?" There was a flash of desperation and longing in Stark's eyes but it was wiped away just as quickly.
Bucky looks up and catches the soda can tossed his way. Dr. Pepper. Huh. Natasha said they were terrible for you but Steve’s obviously developed some sort of unhealthy attachment to the drink. A drink’s a drink, Bucky thinks, and cracks open the can.
Except this wasn’t like any level of intoxication he’d ever experienced and his experiences had been, put simply, extremely extensive. This was almost a compulsion. This was a craving he had never encountered before. This was a craving he felt right down to the very core of his being, and maybe right down to his soul if he believed in that kind of thing. It was almost physically tugging at him towards something.
Even before Tony’s breathless suggestion, Steve knew what he wanted to do. The 21st century was amazing, he'd finally realized. He took out his phone, found the best view, and took a picture. Like Tony said, it really would last longer. The digital camera shutter made Tony moan loud and high. Steve noted the cue and took himself out of the aching confines of his own pants, pulled the pocket square from Tony's ass and threw it to the side, then shoved into Tony to the hilt with one hard thrust. Tony almost collapsed beneath him, a needy whine escaping his throat as he started rocking himself back on Steve's cock. Pulling Tony down to a kneeling position,  Steve started a relentless pace, fucking into Tony as he pulled him back and forth onto his cock with a grip that tore through every layer of Tony’s lovely suit, his knuckles gently grazing Tony’s heated skin. He closed his eyes and lost himself in Tony's heat, content that another trip had ended successfully on all fronts.
“Whoa, big fella,” Bruce says, looking up from his phone, thumbs pausing, “Let’s not throw the word ‘union’ around and spook them, okay?” He looks down again, resuming his message to the crew.
Tony was on his way to the helicarrier for an emergency meeting. Thor had taken the Soul Stone back to Asgard for safekeeping but PLASM had kept the Tesseract for their Containment Units. And because of Murphy’s Law, Thor’s brother had shown his face on Earth and had promptly stolen the damn Tesseract and Clint right from under Fury’s nose. Fury, meanwhile, had promoted the Avengers to a full SHIELD special response team to any and all crises, paranormal or not. Tony had also been promoted to a full member of the Avengers as an emergency response and he didn’t know if he should have accepted it. In the end, the world needed help and he’d be damned if he was going to step away.
Pietro gives him a lopsided grin then turns back to watch his sister and his other teammate fly together. Bruce and Thor continue on into the main building.
Tony huffs louder and takes an obnoxiously loud drink of beer, slamming the glass back onto the table harder than he really should. “Trouble follows me like an imprinted duckling.”
he tried to say, but his throat was closed tight and his chest was throbbing with every breath he couldn’t take.
Tony thought that they’d been doing fine with this relationship, ‘taking it slow’ as the saying went. There had been cold showers, many cold showers, and also many very long and warm showers alone, but he was happier in these few months than he probably had the right to be and he thought Steve was happy as well.
He was in his bedroom at the Tower. Outside the windows, the city twinkled with the light of a quiet night. Beyond the city, the sky was fractured and broken as if inconsequential. There was a shuffling from his bed and he turned in time to see a pale muscular arm emerge from the large shape under the sheets and wrap itself around the smaller body in front of it.
“I fell asleep on the couch and I woke up when you more or less fell on me. I—uh.” Tony's eyes darted to the side before flashing back to Steve. “I thought it was you and I kissed you except you rolled onto the ground and just left me there." He didn’t move away from beneath Steve’s hands but Steve could feel him tensing up with every word.
Tony fought the urge to brace himself on the nearest surface and rub himself raw. “File the biometrics from the suit under—under new project titled Bullshit Very Unscientific Sex Whammy Thing. Open new private workspace for data collection. Instate level three laboratory lockdown and class five safeguards.”
It probably wasn’t Steve’s fault that Stark would think that of him. Even so, Steve was a little miffed at having his words from earlier brushed aside as if he hadn’t mean it. “It’s not their business and all of that is history as I see it,” he said shortly.
“You know,” the entity said, and Tony could make out a tired smile, “I can’t ‘make with the words’ if you keep interrupting me.”
He quickened his pace, squeezing firmly with every upstroke. He let his palm roll smoothly over the warmth, trying to draw more of noises of pleasure from Tony, and smiling when it finally did.
Bruce hums and turns to the fridge to see what drinks they can have. “You’re doing fine. Sorry to intrude.”
It had been difficult for T'Challa to watch as another friend left Steve. T'Challa had friends in his court to keep him company but Steve had been truly alone then; he'd left one man behind only to have another leave him just as soon. Perhaps it was wise of Steve to send the package to Stark. Steve needed purpose, needed company, and it was not something T'Challa could easily provide for him.
nodded, baring its neck like Tony had beneath Steve, only moments before, teeth bared within a smile. “Promise. Let me have
It was in the small breaks in their kiss, when they both withdrew, needing to breathe but still addicted to the same air that passed between them; the way they dove back in a clash of teeth and tongue because they couldn’t be long without each other anyway, personal and galactic wars be damned.
rose to the surface of his mind, unclouded by anything as animalistic as the simple urge to rut. The crude, pornographic images he’d conjured up in his addled mind were replaced by the feeling of Steve’s hot breath in his ear, the tickle of Steve's hair on his cheek, the solid weight of Steve's body holding him up, holding him close, and of this quiet contentedness wrapped around them. This was better than anything he could have imagined. And he would be a fool to not want more.
Cap’s head tilted in a way that was adorably boyish despite what Tony knew of his history. “So, you’re Howard’s boy?”
Steve hadn’t been able to join Carol in following a lead she’d picked up from Madrox; one of his duplicates had apparently seen two Tony Starks on one of the Earths he’d visited.
Steve paused. “I want to feel like a part of this world again,” he said. “Get changed out of this costume and go somewhere crowded. Be with the people.”
Tony blinked. “You’re working for SHIELD?” He indicated Spengler’s entire living person. “You’re not actually dead? What did they offer you? Secrets of the universe? This was why you disappeared?”
Tony's panting turned into broken gasps and Steve knew he was almost there. He withdrew his hand from where he was feeling Tony's thudding heart and started to fondle Tony's balls. The raw shout of pleasure that reached his ears was sweeter than any honey.
Steve flipped back to the business section. The dollar was doing well against the euro. Maybe he should move to Europe for a few months, or years. He had been fond of Italy, when he wasn’t being shot at. Maybe somewhere in Tuscany will be good for a while.
Once upon a very long time ago, when Steve had taken Tony’s hand for the first time, shy and determined in the same breath, he’d thought it would be worth it. They had their differences but they were like two puzzle pieces finally put together on the board. Steve had let Tony in close to himself, and he’d thought he’d finally broken through the shell of Tony’s usual distance. They’d been good together. They’d worked well together even before they’d fallen in to bed together, and Steve—Steve missed those simple days. Or maybe he missed the days of having his opinions go unchallenged.
Another shot of pink was flung in Steve’s direction and he deflected it to the ground with his shield. It dissipated in a puff of light. Not much kinetic energy, Tony observed. JARVIS was analyzing every shot – all that came of it was that the light, or energy, or whatever it was, was on the visible EM spectrum. That didn't explain how the dilapidated building she was fixated on had warping windows and trees sprouting horizontal from the sides and—he wasn’t calling it
Steve sighed. His some-time teammate wasn’t always around but they’d had nice conversations in the night when they’d been free from their day jobs – Steve from maudlin and SHIELD contract work, and Iron Man from his bodyguarding of rich socialite and SHIELD consultant Tony Stark. It was strange that neither of them knew each other’s civilian identities and yet they were able to strike up conversation regardless. Iron Man was the one who caught him up to 21
He fell back heavily, clenching his teeth. Why now? Why now of all times? He closed his eyes and opened his mouth to call.
They sit and watch the bar around them. It was a Thursday evening. Not the busiest of nights but there were plenty of people around, chattering in low voices to the sound of soft blues.
“I know you miss physical contact the most,” Tony says by Steve’s ear, his breath brushing warm against the short hairs there. “You better appreciate this because I’m not usually a hugging sort of guy.”
“So you’re coming up to fit him with it?” Natasha asks, buckling in, hopeful, because Tony can be impulsive, but not liking where this is really going.
“I’m glad I got to spend my last moment with you,” Steve said, soft. “We can try this again, in the next life. Promise.”
As they make their way to Tony’s car, Tony slips his arm out of hers and makes his way to the front of the car where the trunk was opening. She follows him over and looks over his shoulder at the long silver case he has stored there. As she steps in place beside him, he opens the case with two clicks and a beep. The lid flips open slowly with a hiss and Natasha sees a metal arm, whole left arm, with intricate plates, nestled between the foam linings. She looks up at Tony with a quirked eyebrow in question.
As Steve spoke, Tony was aware that there was a second source of light blooming around them. He turned his head and saw a starburst of pure white light grow just over Steve’s shoulder.
Tony watched the progress then studied the Trap in his hands. He wondered if he could use this to leverage a Containment Unit out of Fury. He was readying his thrusters to full power when Fury’s voice came through the team comms.
knew. They were killed in cold blood, and I just believed dad was dumb enough to drive drunk, get them both killed on a straight road, get
Tony twirls around on his heels and saunters toward Steve. He stops a step before Steve and smiles, eyes crinkling.
Tony had startled at Steve’s movement but Steve could see him relax almost immediately. Steve could also see him narrow his eyes, thinking. A small smirk appeared on his face and Steve breathed an internal sigh of relief.
, and then he turned to face Steve, rubbing a wet streak from chest to groin with his lubed fingers.
T'Challa grinned. "Wakanda can be generous, and we have resources aplenty. I won't ask you again to sign the Accords but I do implore you to not destroy more airports and cities - you will have no ally in me if anything of the sort happens. Otherwise, well met, Steve."
She watches as Tony drains his cup and stands, brushing off the crumbs from his danish on to the table. “No promises,” he says.
with you in the ice, trapped unwittingly by my brother, weakened. I kept you, and yet you never let me have you. But this,” he stepped into Steve’s space, hands roaming over Steve’s chest, up his arms, down to his hands to the shield, “led me to Anthony, and with this,” he pressed at Steve’s chest, over Steve’s phantom heart, “you gave me enough strength to finally get what I needed.”
Stark gave a weak laugh at that and closed his eyes with a nod. "I just wanted Steve to tell me sooner," he said, voice tired. "He's the one always yapping on about not keeping secrets. Guess it doesn't apply to him."
. He wasn't even ashamed that he’d positioned himself as close to the door as he could in anticipation of it eventually opening. He just couldn’t take it anymore. His arms alone couldn’t take it anymore, let alone his dick or his ass. Just as well he couldn’t muster up two intelligent thoughts because he didn’t know if creating a fucking machine out of this ordeal was something he wanted on his list of accomplishments.
The two men before him fell silent and T'Challa turned his attention away from his loss. He was greeted with two faces set in determination.
Steve’s eyes snap open in time to see a figure rise from his shield. Peggy, beautiful and whole, rushes toward him and he’s confused but relieved. Peggy can help him. Peggy can save them. He tries to indicate the flight controls, the bombers on board, but Peggy only stands and studies him with a tilted head.
Since then, he’d just stuck by Tony, following along with whatever it was that Tony had to do. They’d gone to New York numerous times, Tony supervising the completion of his tower there. Steve had gone alone to visit Brooklyn on those trips. He had wandered the streets, moving past the people, and tried to find where everything was. The streets were the same, but the details weren’t. It had been like a bad duplication of a painting. And more than the missing visual details, Steve couldn’t
Natasha sips her mocha and looks over the rim of the cup at Tony. She smiles sweetly and sets the cup down, then crosses her legs, and her hands on top of them, mirroring Tony’s posture. Across from her, Tony sniffs. His fingers were beginning to show signs of drumming against each other where they’re loosely clasped in his lap.
He wrapped his legs tighter around Steve’s waist and let his hips do the talking, desperately trying to get closer to the hardness he could feel below Steve’s belt. His hands buried themselves into Steve’s short hair and he let his mouth be plundered by Steve’s hot tongue.
“This is one of the longest relationships I’ve been in, the happiest I've been in a long time, and I think it’s because of the lack of sex. I’m a future guy, I see patterns. And I want to keep this relationship. I don’t want it to end because we do have sex. Which is what has always happened. There. That’s it. That’s why there’s only been heavy petting!” Because some people stopped angling for sex after they’ve had it. But a lot more people stopped angling for
What had his life been but a series of events and his reactions to them? He thought he could break that cycle in death but that didn’t appear to be the case. It didn’t matter whether or not he had only been kept here because of some paranormal force’s whims; he had wanted to stay with Tony, but he wanted Tony safe more than anything else.
Steve draws back the shield for a throw and the Skull raises the Cube up high. The light of the cosmos washes through the space around them and Steve feels his feet freeze as if caught in thick mud. He looks down and sees ice encasing him up to his ankles. It rises quickly and in moments, Steve is frozen from the waist down. He tries to chip at it with the shield but it was gone from his arm. The ice rises to his chin, over his mouth, his nose, his eyes, and then he’s fully encased, unable to even draw in a panicked breath.
In the elevator, he made sure to press the right floor number. And finally in his own bedroom, his last thought as he drifted to sleep was that he probably wouldn’t remember any of it in the morning.
Tony thumped his head back onto the hat with a groan. Steve pressed a palm down onto the hot skin of Tony's cock and drew out another loud moan from Tony.
Tony stared at it, then looked up at Steve’s face. Steve’s expression was torn between grinning widely and something that looked like worry. Or maybe fear.
It was Tony’s turn to laugh, eyes sparkling with mirth. Steve had known he would like the expression in those eyes of Tony’s.
Tony followed along. The slime hadn’t been other dimensional so it couldn’t have skipped like Colonel Sanders had. Could it have something to do with the light Tony saw when the Trap closed? It had been sickly green and went through all his filters. He pulled out his phone and cycled through data on the visible spectra of hauntings, tapping in a command for JARVIS to perform a search at the same time.
Steve closed his eyes and thought of the faces of all his friends, of all the people he knew. Fought with. Fought for. Laughed with. Loved.
“It’s not that simple,“ Steve says, scratching at his forehead. He takes a sharp turn then makes his way to the atrium. Sam follows silently. They leave the building and Steve steps down on to the grass and plants his hands on his hips, looking up at the sky. Sam stands beside him, arms crossed, and waits some more.
Tony sagged against the wall and let Steve support his entire dead weight. Steve’s chest heaved against his and he used the rhythm to regain his own breath. He knew he was in his right mind again; he was thinking straight, and his body had the familiar languid heaviness and sensitivity of his usual post-orgasm high. His dick wasn't hardening immediately. His dick was normal again.
It definitely didn’t brighten Tony’s mood when giant mascots possessed by other dimensional entities chose another weekend to throw slime in his face. The weekend was also the only time he had to tinker to his heart’s content and he absolutely refused to fall into his old habits of missing Stark Industries work in the weekdays and disappointing Pepper.
There is a loud clang through the comms, the sound of a smattering of drones fizzling under the might of a giant metal frisbee. Sam laughs out loud, sensing the silent horror from the other end of the line.
Natasha reached towards his arm and peeled back his sleeves to get a look at his tended cuts. Tony wanted to pull his hand away but he knew better by now. She nodded after seeing Tony’s sloppy and excessive ministrations then turned to Clint. “We’ll have to check the Expo grounds, see if he’s anchored there.”
The burn was agonizing. It tore through his body from where the Stone was touching him but with it came a rush of something powerful, something flowing and thrumming, resonating with his being and his will, and then beyond, into the world, the universe.
“Hang on,” Steve raises a hand between her and Tony. “Can’t this wait until he’s at least slept for more than three hours?”
He twisted around and tried to find anything in the darkness that wasn’t more darkness. Wasn’t he in the Conference Room on the helicarrier? What had happened? Where was everyone?
“I don’t want anything other than an explanation of what happened back there,” Steve said with a jerk of his thumb over his shoulder. Maybe he was being selfish in wanting to find out about Stark’s personal life, but he was going to take this chance.
And Steve realized then that Tony didn’t, not really. Tony might have broken Steve’s trust but Steve had also broken Tony’s: during the Civil War, multiple times, again and again refusing Tony’s hand, sometimes literally, just so he could keep his moral high ground.
Steve hesitated and walked towards the door. He stopped on the threshold, turning to glance at Tony, or more specifically, Tony’s chest. Tony repeated his shooing gesture and Steve finally turned and left.
He squinted through the blurriness and the darkness and thought he saw a head of blonde hair. Bobbi? He was popular with the ladies tonight it seemed, and he hadn’t expected Bobbi to be here. Before he could figure out why Bobbi had such a large hand, he was already following the pressure of the hand and lowering himself into another kiss.
“I know,” Steve snarled. He threw the agent’s head away from him and returned to his pacing, picking up the cloth to wipe his fingers clean as he passed the trolley. “Where did you move it?”
Steve closed his eyes. He hadn’t—he knew it was mostly why he was here but he hadn’t thought about it like that. He knew he should be relieved. His case would be easier because of it.
When Steve had been a younger man, he had only the one nice suit to call his own. Passed down from his father, his mother had done her best to fit the beige fabric to Steve's much smaller frame. It never sat very well on him; the fabric was stiff, rough, and there was only so much time his mother could spare on it, only so much money for a family of two in Brooklyn. Still, Steve had loved it even as he yearned for more. He'd worn it whenever he could get away with it. To Church, to the pictures, on Bucky's double dates with his girls, picking up his mother from her shifts before she'd gotten too sick to go to work…
“Clint?” Steve asked, reaching back with a stretch to grab the grubby deck of cards from the bottom drawer of his desk. “Didn’t know he could learn new tricks.”
Through his half-consciousness, he heard a familiar wheezing laugh, and saw the crooked smile of Ivan Vanko flash at him from beyond the darkness surrounding him.
Good to see Rhodes and Danvers having fun together. Tony’s emails had been getting increasingly shrill about them, among other things.
Steve picked up the gun on the trolley and shot the agent between the eyes. A small drop of blood landed on his own cheek and the white star on his chest. He picked up another clean cloth and scrubbed it away. The door behind him opened moments later and his soldiers began the clean-up and prep for the next one. There was still a handful left; one of them would know and one of them would break.
Tony’s door burst open on the other side of the room and Tony jumped back to his feet as the two PLASM agents slid into combat stance just inside the doorway, weapons raised and charged, goggles down. Cap was now standing on the other side of the bed with his feet apart, hands raised, one forearm held out as if holding something strapped to it.
Three turns and a dark empty conference room later, Tony collapsed onto a cold leather seat and held his head in his hands. He drove everything from his mind and focused on bringing his breathing back under control.
And then he’d opened his eyes, and had seen Tony and suddenly, he’d been in the world again. As a ghost. Neither here nor there.
Tony’s ears were ringing louder and louder and his eyes were refusing to unblur, but he felt a strong beat of his heart in his numbed chest. “Will you stay with me?”
Steve felt a shiver run down his spine at the words. He’d started this, but he could never resist anything that came from Tony’s mouth. “What do you think, Mister Stark,” Steve said, voice steady. “And make it convincing.”
It was in the way Tony opened his armor for Steve’s hands, the panels sliding away in hexagons of vibrant reds and golds to reveal a lithe body beneath; the way Steve could find the exact places on Tony he could rest his hands, and the way Tony pressed himself into the touch, offering without a second thought.
“Look, Steve,” Sam says slowly, “He doesn’t call, email, or text any of the rest of us every other minute. He joins us when we really need him in the field. And he’s got his Tower to run and his company to oversee. And,” Sam hesitates, not sure if he should be revealing the next bit to Steve, “he comes by every fortnight or so, usually meeting with Natasha in town to hand over tech.”
“You did good today,” Steve began. “Not many people can wield the Infinity Gauntlet and not be tempted by its power.”
The rush of spirits slowed and finally stopped. The displaced air returned with a gust, but still the Stone was nowhere in sight. He looked down at this chest, where the arc reactor was glowing green. Had the Stone migrated back into the arc reactor? It couldn’t be inside, could it?
To this point in Tony’s life, there were three certainties he lived by: one, that logic and the scientific method were the only effective ways of thought; two, that anything was possible unless proven otherwise; three, that Captain America was a symbol, a paragon, but Steve Rogers was the good man beneath the mask and more than that, he was a good friend. As of a few hours ago, Steve was a good friend, and maybe something more, corporeal state be damned.
“We promise not to hurt you,” Steve said, his calming 'Captain' voice in full effect. “You’re in safe hands with us. We want to help. If you come with us, we can—“
Everyone was looking between him and Steve, expressions anticipatory, wary. Tony’s gaze landed on Fury, who was wearing his standard long-suffering expression which meant he was gearing up to say something Tony was not going to like.
Steve felt the prickly bristles of Tony’s beard and mustache brush along his skin as Tony withdrew. His breath hitched at the thought of getting more beard burn in the near future and maybe also in the far future if he was going to be honest with himself.
A hand landed gently on the back of his neck and he thought Jess might have said something. The next thing he, knew before he could respond with something that wouldn’t make a fool of himself, was a pair of warm lips pressed against his.
for still sticking around after the one with the champagne and Camelot. I forgive you but I don’t blame you in the first place so take what you will.”
Natasha drums her fingers on the table. “Bruce will be back next week,” she says. Bucky stiffens minutely across from her and she slides her foot forward to nudge his ankle. He jumps at the contact and widens his eyes at her in disbelief. She gives him an innocent smile before continuing, raising her hand in the process. “We’ll bring him in on this. He’s been helping via emails but Phase Four's going to presence. Agreed?”
Tony looks as he does now: his hair is short and slightly waved and spiked over his forehead, a strand occasionally falling into his eyes; there is a little bit of silver at his temples; his goatee is trimmed and full; there are laugh lines at the corners of his eyes that Steve secretly adores; and there’s an arc reactor glowing in his chest which Steve can feel a pull from. Tony’s eyes are bright and there’s none of the tired lines that dominated his face in his waking hours.
The team had gathered around them at this point and Tony held up the Meter as explanation. Natasha frowned and bent down to examine the Trap. She was the one who dealt with them more than any of the rest of them.
At his name, Tony came, body clenching and squeezing around Steve. Steve gasped and thrust once, twice into Tony and then came. He dropped heavily back into the chair and let Tony settle his weight on him, grounding him. Tony was breathing hard, his chest rising and falling rapidly under Steve’s palm. The beating of Tony’s heart soothed Steve and he used that to drag himself away from the post-coital fog blanketing his brain.
When he turned around, Tony was standing in the middle of the room, hand rubbing at the back of his head with an unreadable expression on his face.
Tony tried to shake his head. “I can make it—I can use it—“ his throat stopped working and his vision was fading.
Peace in sight, T'Challa let himself smile. "I can grant you amnesty in Wakanda. And," he nodded at the Soldier, "Wakanda leads the world in the medical sciences. We can provide care both physical, and psychological."
It probably wasn't surprising that Steve would eventually fall into bed with Tony. It certainly explained the heat stirring at the pit of his stomach whenever Tony, whatever he was wearing, had smiled at him with those expressive brown eyes twinkling. It was inevitable. It made Steve happier than anything he'd felt since he'd woke up in this new century. It opened doors to opportunities he never knew existed.
The third time Steve and Tony kissed, it was also their last. And Tony wished with all his being that he hadn’t blacked out from drink. He decided that this would be the last time his inventions would fail him.
, said. “I apologize for intruding but,” he looked to Fury, the only other person in the room, and Fury sighed but nodded, and Steve (
Tony snorted, the sound distorted by the armor. “I wasn’t aware we were together enough for you to use that phrase.” He shifted and the red and gold of the armor reflected a flash of the dying light from the wall of windows. “I will say this, though: you can kick me from the Avengers but I won’t let you stop me from being Iron Man.”
His eyes snapped open wide at that thought. Love? Did he? He looked at Tony. Tony was smiling back at him so fondly, a hand rubbing idly below the arc reactor.
"No!" The Captain spoke up loud and quick, and even the Soldier gave him a startled look. "He—he's. He's fine. The suit's disabled. Partially disabled. He's grounded, but he can move. He's fine. He's—"
“I’ll get myself nice and wet for you,” Tony gasped. “I’m so hot inside.” He added a fourth finger and groaned loudly. The ring of muscle around his fingers twitched and squeezed, lubricant sliding down his legs. “You’ll love it when you
“Because I liked it.” Steve cut in quickly, hoping to forestall the panic rising in Tony’s voice. He’d never been good at these things. He steeled himself and carried on. “I think you did as well. It helped me. And I miss it. I—I want it back. What we had. I want it back. All of it.”
Steve tried for a different tactic. He gave a command and the stripper poles rose from their place in the floor and fixed into the ceiling. They'd used them before on previous trips home. Tony loved to peel himself out of business suits for Steve's hungry eyes. Steve had even tried it once or twice in the Captain America uniform, which never failed to get Tony to pounce on him before the pants were even off. He had a different plan this time, though. Turning Tony around, he backed Tony against a pole and pinned his hands above his head, telling him to hold on tight. Tony, mouth now running off about a completely unrelated filtration project, obeyed, a hard glint in his eyes daring Steve to break him, to silence him.
Steve stood still and gaped. He and Iron Man had talked very little about Iron Man’s boss and charge. Iron Man wasn’t very comfortable broaching that subject in any capacity but Steve knew what the news and gossip rags said about Stark. To the general public, Stark was a typical socialite – rich, carefree, and promiscuous – but even if they knew of his kidnapping three years ago, they didn’t know the full extent of what Stark had been doing after it outside of reshaping his company: namely, building and maintaining the Iron Man for the Avengers and consulting for SHIELD part-time in the name of peace.
Tony coughs and looks away. “I did say any time, right?” He looks back at Steve, curiosity in his eyes.  “How was it ‘glowing funny’? JARVIS has been monitoring it ever since you mentioned it the last time and he hasn’t spotted anything out of the ordinary. Not with his sensors anyway.”
Tony turned back to Steve and stepped in close. “I won’t let anything happen to you,” he said in a low voice. “That much I can promise. I’m still working on the Act. I’ll have it reinstated without the sharp edges. It’ll be worth it, Steve. You’ll like it. Everything you hated about it was already gone from the second draft. It’ll help everyone. It’ll get the kids the training they need. It’ll give the civilians the protection they should have had. I know it’s right, Steve. Don’t—“ Tony cut himself off and shook his head hard. “Don’t do anything stupid. The trial’s scheduled for some time in the next fourteen days but if you can make a statement for your followers still out there it would help your case. A lot.”
Tony grins at her and closes the lid of the case and then the lid of the trunk back down. He steps around to the driver’s seat and gestures to the passenger seat. “Just a replacement for the last one he managed to get mayonnaise in.”
“Oh, I’d pay to see that threesome in action,” Natasha says. All four of them choke on their drinks. Well done, Romanoff.
Tony whimpered again and Steve drank in the sound, biting down on the junction of Tony’s neck and shoulder. He dropped his hands to Tony’s thighs and rubbed to Tony’s rhythm. He let his gloved thumb brush along Tony’s cock with every movement, teasing just a little. The squeak of leather filled his ears. Steve’s uniform was going to need a thorough cleaning before it could be fit for the public again.
Tony snorted. “You flatter me, Cap. Make a guy feel great, you do. But I don’t need to be babied. PLASM can’t do a damn thing about it. What makes you think you can? And I’m working on a defence system so don’t worry about it.” He waved a dismissive hand at Steve.
Tony slumped onto the cot DUM-E and U had hastily assembled and stared at the pitched tent in his pants. He hadn’t needed to use the cot for months now. He’d been going to bed at regular hours. With Steve. And now this. Not even Steve’s absence was making it easier for him to think.
“Okay, no, we’re not doing this,” Tony said in a burst. Steve continued to watch as Tony rolled to the side and shoved all his pillows away to back down on the far side of the bed. Tony tugged around on the blankets again and then gave an imperious pat to the newly vacated side of the bed. “You, lie here. Get out of that armchair. I’m starting to feel psychoanalyzed. We’re equals and I’m not leaving the bed, so you’re getting in.”
Tony glares at him harder but bulls on. “Yeah and I’m far on the wrong side of 40. Plus, we never see eye to eye.”
He rubbed at his chest, where the scars still marred the skin. The scar from the wound that should have killed him. That should have let him die with Ton—
Thor nods somberly. They reach the Craft Studio and knock on the closed doors. Again, no answer, so they open the doors and peer in. The curtains are drawn but from the light pouring in through the door, the room appears empty and untouched.
He grasped tighter onto the Stone and when he opened his eyes, he wasn’t looking at the lab – he was looking at the world as it was, teeming with the life,
“That gives me more questions,” Steve replied immediately, and Tony could almost see the little shake of head that accompanied it. “We need to talk about why our 'unfinished business' is this situation.”
“Not a psychopath,” Stark replied, conversational, his fingers tight around Steve’s arm. “Unwilling to be trapped in your little Matrix world for your amusement.”
Slowly, he pulled Steve forward with one hand supporting his neck and the other at his shoulders. He leaned forward to let Steve’s forehead rest on his chest, then he reached back and took his still-warm pillow and placed it over the back of the seat before resting Steve’s head back. He adjusted the pillow then pulled the blanket over Steve and tucked it around his shoulders.
The third time Steve and Tony kissed, it was brief and in the heat of the moment. But in that moment, they felt like they knew each other to the core of their souls. It was natural and it was familiar. Like the first glowing embers of a fire. Like the first trickle of rain in the summer.
Tony felt a touch at his jaw and his head was slowly turned to face Steve. Steve was smiling, gentle, and Tony knew where this was headed. He tried to shake his head but his neck wasn’t obeying him anymore.
was the one doing this to him and that thought shot an unexpected wave of heat straight to his groin. The feeling disappeared as soon as he thought it and he opened his eyes.
Now Tony’s shell was cracked beyond repair – by Steve – and Steve’s future was, once again, a new life at the cost of losing everything he’d loved in this old one. He didn’t know if it was worth it, this time around.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, trying to feel the body before him, but couldn’t. He could only feel the pinpoints of fingertips at his cheek and the burning from the Stone in his palm. He wanted to keep Steve, but. But he wouldn’t deprive Steve of his after-life. And he wouldn’t break that promise to Steve, all those months ago as they stood laughing together.
“Can I please have your autograph, Mr. Stark?” The young man says. “I’m a big fan of yours, in more ways than one!”
. Really, this was the worst time to be thinking about this. This was the wrong time to pull up his memories of Steve gently kissing him in bed and turn them into a fantasy of Steve rolling on top of him to deepen the kiss, a fantasy of Steve kissing down his chest, lower and lower until—
“I know he’s your best digital friend,” Bucky begins, and Steve grunts at the description, “but he’s got his reasons.” He squeezes Steve’s knee then lets go.
Tony threw his hands up at Steve. “That’s why I’m telling you to leave it! It’s not like you actually managed to get your hands on them! They just disappear.”
“I’m having trouble trying to process Captain America saying ‘cuddle’ and admitting to participating in the act—“
Steve stood silent as he let Tony absorb his words. Maybe he should have been clearer. Maybe he should have been more forward. But what he’d said was the truth and he wouldn’t withhold it anymore. Not when it might’ve avoided an entire war. Even so, he couldn’t help but tense when Tony lifted his head from his hands and the face plate came up to reveal a face of utter disbelief.
“Go ahead, JARVIS,” Tony ordered. The glass lowered and Tony felt the Pacific breeze on the back of his neck. The battered Mark VI hovered inside and landed to Tony’s left with a dull clunk. Controlled by JARVIS, it raised both palms and Tony heard the repulsors charge, the pink glow of protonic energy glowing at its palms. Reassured, Tony turned back to the entity. “Alright, buddy, make with the words before I shoot you in the face.”
“I did not expect that,” Bruce says to Thor, calming his breathing. He reaches back to bring out his phone from his pocket. “Looks like that charity event will be just a charity event without ulterior motive.”
Tony looked down at the completed reports, all written with care and signed with a star. “You’re much worse than me when it comes to being overly attached to your work, Sheriff.”
He tore his thoughts away from his regrets and looked down at Tony’s lips. They were parted slightly, reddened and shiny. He gave in to the urge to touch and reached forward to feel their kiss-softened warmth beneath the pad of his thumb.
Steve recognized the suit immediately even with the repairs he knew were made through restorative efforts. The small stains on the left pocket from where he'd leaned against the wooden barriers on Coney Island. The small cigarette burn on the right shoulder from walking into a kitchen hand on his break in a parking lot. The small smudge of red at the hem of the jacket from where he'd sat on a red crayon that melted in and wouldn’t come out. The familiar jagged alterations at the hem of the pant legs. He didn't need to read the plaque to know that Tony had hunted this suit down, and had probably paid a fortune to take it from the hands of some private collector only to donate it to the museum. And all that just for Steve.
“That’s a lot of talking going on,” Clint says slowly. “But they’re still acting like nothing’s happening? How sure are we that all that is communication between the two of them? Not just static and butt-dialing?”
, was now hanging off his shoulders, revealing the arc reactor. The light from the reactor was glowing the green of the light that Steve had always seen during the hauntings, and on that earlier mission with the Love Slime.
after they’ve had the sex. The last time may have been years and years ago, before Iron Man, but that fear never left. Steve was different, Tony knew that. Steve was good to him, and he'd like to think he was good to Steve. But an irrational fear was irrational for a reason.
There was an itch under his skin and a hitch in his breath. His mind, usually so sharp, was suddenly in a jumble, as if he’d had way too much to drink, as if he were on something much, much stronger than alcohol. Except his body felt like it was thrumming with some kind of—some kind of
Steve pushed Stark's legs apart just enough to get between them and braced himself over Stark, a smile on his face. "I'm gonna pay that favor I owe ya," he said cheerily. "Right now. Objections?"
The HUD helpfully informed him of a spike in heart rate, respiratory rate, and core temperature. His brain waves were going crazy. He felt a sheen of sweat break across his brow. His crotch region felt uncomfortably tight in the armor. And all he could think about was tasting Steve’s lips. Feeling Steve’s hands across his skin, gripping, pulling, pushing. The weight of Steve’s—
Bruce laughs at the string of text-groans that follow Vision's revelation. He pockets his phone and looks to the sky. It was still clear. He may still be driven to run, to get away, to not call anywhere ‘home’, but these people are starting to make him feel like he could stay here.
Tony was already facing the door when it opened to finally admit Steve into his sight. Another two steps later and Steve was hoisting him up by the thighs and spinning to slam him back-first right onto the wall by the door.
The thing wearing Tony’s face tipped its head to the side, studying Steve. “Those broken pieces of souls Anthony had around him were never enough to satiate me. Or, Vanko was it? Vanko was disgusting. And then you interfered, and I had to summon more.” It tapped at its chest, over the green glow. “Anthony never said yes. He was so close, all those times, and I could only drain him so much. He’s such a fragile creature,” it grinned with
Tony had been working too hard, still balancing his time between his company, PLASM missions, and his personal down-time. Steve was sure Tony had been sleeping well, and nothing had been haunting him for months but there was no mistaking how this lifestyle was taking a toll on him. Steve knew much of it was for his sake and he’d encouraged Tony to spend more time with SI if that was what he had to do. Steve didn’t really mind. Watching Tony work was becoming his favorite past-time. Watching Tony suffer, however, was not.
Tony heaved himself to his feet and whipped around in search of the source of the voice but he was still alone in the lab. He looked back down at his chest, where there was a faint pulse of warmth. “That you there, rock?”
He let the soft memories of Steve spooned behind him during those comfortable nights float across his mind. “That was—that was—it was convenient at the start. I helped you, you helped me. Nightmares, be gone. There was kissing, wasn’t there? We got around to kissing. We still do that. Some petting. Some heavy petting. We go on dates! I endured art galleries for you! And it's not like you ever made a move to go further so it's not entirely
Tony glared at the little open comms icon on his HUD in lieu of having Steve beside him to glare at.
Steve turns, ready to deny it, to offer comfort, anything - but Tony waves his hands at him and returns to his missile designs.
There was a small whimper from the speakers and Tony’s voice stumbled into silence. He stilled and listened. “Are you touching yourself?” he asked, incredulous and more than a little bit flattered. More than a little glad he had some hard evidence that this wasn't one-sided.
information are you?” Stark tacked the question on as Steve was still processing the answer. There was a hint of panic in Stark’s voice that was probably supposed to have been masked by the smirk.
“I almost had Tony agreeing,” Rhodey says, slowly rolling his tankard between his hands. “I had him making a not-promise. And then nothing.” He gestures sharply with his tankard. “Whole fortnight. The usual. No change. Nothing.”
Phase Four. The phase that shouldn’t exist. But, drastic measures. Natasha tries to enjoy the rest of their time at the bar for their night off. Bucky’s ankle stays rested against hers throughout the evening.
prepared for this. Through the gaps between his fingers, he saw Steve hover at his shoulder with the shield. The shield that Steve had apparently wanted to find. The shield that might have moved Steve on. The shield that might have moved Steve on without Tony being present to even say goodbye.
It’s several moments before they part and Tony is the first to let go, Steve reluctantly withdrawing his arms. When Tony reaches up to brush at Steve’s cheeks with his thumbs, Steve realizes his eyes are stinging.
“Okay, okay, I get it,” Steve says and then sinks further into the chair, hair mussing up in the back, shirt riding up. Bucky would have poked him in the stomach once upon a time. Sarah Rogers would never have wanted her boy sitting with bad posture.
"I'm very sorry about your father," the Soldier said, voice ringing clear despite the pain and exhaustion evident on his face. "If I had known—"
The sky was still blue and there was an unarmored Tony and himself, and only a few armed guards from their convoy. He didn’t know if he would have put this amount of trust in Tony had their positions been reversed. He could run. He could knock the guards down, easy. But he wouldn’t because he still had his honor intact.
“Busy, Cap.” Tony flicks something in and out of the holo-projection. In and out. In and out. It doesn’t appear to be altering anything.
Steve blinked at Tony then slowly moved to sit on the bed, drawing his legs up, and leaned back against the headboard. He looked sideways at Tony. Was this normal?
Tony suppressed the urge to roll his eyes as he drifted out of the way of a shot of pink energy. “Witch, then. Listen, witch. I know a guy who can help you control those party tricks of yours—“
Well. Natasha looks down at the case she’s holding. So maybe Tony managed to pull one over her. She laughs as she walks up into the atrium and several of the Agents look at her in alarm. She gives them a more sedate smile then proceeds to go find Bucky to give him a hand.
Steve, not knowing what else to do, moves to sit on the bed. He doesn’t know what Tony will remember of this dream but there are so many things he’s never said out loud to Adult Tony, fearing he’d be shut down in face of the sentiment but maybe here, he can get his thoughts across. He thinks for a moment and decides to go for it. “How about a story about one of the bravest, most caring men I know?”
Slowly, Tony nodded. The Stone in his palmed flared with heat again and the numbness returned. This time, Tony knew it would be final. He nodded again, firmly, and looked back up to Steve, eyes flicking between his eyes and his lips in inquisition. Steve smiled and slowly, dipped his head down towards Tony.
After they’d sent Thor off to Jane for the holidays, Tony had stayed out with Steve at the edge of the landing pad and Steve had shared his desire to draw. Tony had immediately started designing out loud a vibranium stylus. If Steve could touch the vibranium in Tony’s chest, and only in Tony’s chest, he could touch a piece extended from his chest, right? Steve had stood and let Tony wave his hands around, trying to theorize on anchors, Steve’s lack of P.K.E., the significance of hauntings in general, and the feasibility of him synthesizing a substantial amount of vibranium. Steve hoped he wouldn’t need to use a stylus anchored literally to Tony’s heart just to doodle but he appreciated the sentiment all the same. He looked over the cityscape and let Tony ramble on beside him.
He flipped to the sports section and studied the column of baseball scores. Life had gone on as if nothing had happened. Mostly.
"Two seconds to spare," he said. His voice was hoarse but he couldn't care any less – he did get some good, honest noises out of Tony. Tony's belly shook in an answering laugh.
Something cold and heavy crawled up his legs, brushing along his sides, and pressed down onto his shoulders. Vanko’s face, contorted grotesquely, rose into Tony’s view and Tony spat out a gargled obscenity. He tried to shake off the cold grip but Vanko only laughed maniacal at his weakening struggles. The cold weight crushed down on him, closing him in, darkening his vision.
“Sheriff,” the girl- woman- Susan, nodded at Steve, sober. “I’ll pass him onto you then. And Tony,” she added to Tony, who looked at her with eyes hooded in, surprisingly, only concentration, “I’ll come find you and we can talk tomorrow.” She patted him on the arm then made her way down into the crowd below, tossing a good night over her shoulder.
A particularly loud splash made him turn towards the sliver of light below the door to the bathroom where Tony was taking a long bath. Steve thought Tony spoke but the voice didn’t sound alarming so Steve didn’t question Tony’s safety. He tugged his mind away from the bath and bathrooms. It was a reminder that he couldn’t interact with the world in any meaningful manner anymore. He can absorb all the information he wants but he couldn’t
“But you would have taken me up to your penthouse to shut me up?” Steve said instead, changing tack.
This was different. Electric. This was Steve right before him in the flesh, smelling of musk and aftershave and—
-Tony’s hair. Tony kept trying, nudging at Steve, harder and harder, but Steve refused to wake. Another wave of heated pain lanced up his arm, this time refusing to diffuse from his chest and he let himself fall heavily against the glass of his windows, trying to catch his breath and bring his focus back.
And every night, since that last night of the first month, Steve would verbally prod Tony to bed, and then either wander the city or watch one of the movies and TV shows now perpetually playing in the media room with another Avenger who was refusing to sleep, try to touch things, become angry that he couldn’t, and reappear by Tony’s side as soon as he felt a tug from his anchor signalling
Steve swallowed hard. His heart was hammering in his chest and his legs were almost twitching to stand, to let him bury himself in Tony. Tony pushed his fingers into himself again, the sound wet and
And then they’d gone and found his shield. And Steve, Steve had been able to touch the shield. Feel it, wield it. The thought of all the things he could do now, of how he could interact with the world at large with something corporeal in his hands had made him giddy with happiness, if a little fearful at the full extent of possibilities. When Tony had entered the room, Steve had been eager to share the discovery.
The door opened behind him without warning and Steve jumped to his feet to see Tony squinting at him through the low light. Tony had put on a dark shirt, the material masking the glow of the arc reactor, and his sleep pants. He stepped back and swept an arm at the room, and Steve moved past Tony quickly, making his way to his usual spot by the windows.
“You went backwards with that,” Stark said. He tucked his sunglasses into his pocket and stepped towards Steve with an outstretched hand. “Anthony Stark, but you should call me Tony.”
Tony’s eyes widen at the name and Steve can’t help but smile at the awe in that expression. It reflects what Steve feels about Tony most days when he thought about all that the man had been through. “I’ve never heard of this Iron Man before,” Tony says and leans eagerly towards Steve. “What did he do?”
He was trying to figure out what he could do for another year of this non-life when the bathroom door finally opened to admit Tony into the bedroom.
He broke away and rolled off the person who was not Jess, right onto the floor. He mumbled an apology into the hard wood and groped for his peas, then crawled his way out of the common area to go find his new bedroom.
The New Year had rolled over like a tidal wave for Tony. There had been constant call-outs for Class Five and lower hauntings on New Year’s Eve and the PLASM support teams had been dispatched for those. After New Year’s Day however, the higher class paranormal events had risen with vigor. It was cutting into Tony’s time and he could feel himself being worn down, torn between PLASM and his company, and unwilling to give up either. As a consultant, he could have refused the call-outs, but it had never felt right to do so.
It had taken Steve. And if he couldn’t get it to obey him in its weakened state, then Tony was going to manifest the damn rock to its full power and get Steve back himself.
And this is how Steve is sure that he’s glad that he had stayed even as a ghost, that he got to meet this man. Steve nods and Tony grins smugly, and Tony keeps grinning smugly until he falls off a wave off the coast of Australia and wakes up to the sound of laughter.
Sam takes his turn to snort. “Look, man, you know we know how you are when it comes to him.” He falls in step with Steve as they step out of the locker room. “I’m just saying, I’ve been saying, just take the chance. You want this, more than anything. So why not go for it?”
It was in the way Tony fought for control, lips insistent and molding Steve’s to his own; the way he tugged at Steve’s back, the way he pulled Steve’s hands to wrap around his hip, and the way he directed Steve’s probing tongue with his own.
There were hands clawing at his chest again, holding him down. They were clawing through his skin, through his ribs, and right into his heart. He felt the pain down to his bones and he screamed.
“How’ve my boys been treating you, agent?” Steve said after the door closed behind him again. He avoided the patches of dried blood, old and new, and dropped into the only other chair into the room, careless and carefree.
“Wait,” Tony interrupted, brain catching up, “that was actually you there? And not my brain adjusting to the times?”
Sam groans again but swallows the end of it. If Steve can finally take Tony out for a not-date, then he can ask Sharon out for lunch. Sam shoves Steve gently as they walk back inside. He may have walked into that one but it’ll probably be worth it.
Tony circled the eighty foot red blob currently oozing in the shadow of Barclays Center. It was reported to have been throwing 'Love Slime’ at everyone and everything. Anyone in contact with the slime had made for the nearest person and…. The reactions ranged from uncontrollable sobbing to full blown sex, depending on how the relationship between the people. Even if the increased love in the air before Valentine’s Day had always bred some interesting entity, it had usually been small scale, never like this. Bruce had stayed back at the Tower; he hadn’t wanted risk coming into contact with the slime and Hulking out involuntarily. And because of the mass of the entity, which Tony and the team have just been calling ‘blob’ for convenience, it’d been rolling right over the capture streams.
"You're forgiven," the Captain said slowly, still uncertain. He walked forward until he was shoulder to shoulder with the Soldier and they shared a look. "How do you think you can help us?"
“You don’t have to stay here with me, Steve,” Tony said as he arranged his pillow on the one bench. “I can make do by my own self.”
Tony kicked a heel into Steve's ass. “What do you think, I’d just waltz around naked when I’m horny?”
"Ravish away, Steve," Tony said, a hitch in his breath. "One minute, or you'll be owing me another favor."
century walking behavior subconsciously. His thumb hovered over Iron Man’s name and he thought for two seconds before he tapped it for a call. It was early in the day but Steve could still call to make sure the hit Iron Man took in the fight earlier hadn’t done too much damage. The phone rang for two more seconds and went through to voicemail.
Tony ignored that last comment for now. “I see the costume, buddy,” he folded his arms. “They sell ‘em on Amazon by the boatload. And that’s basic history book knowledge about World War Two. You’re gonna have to be more specific.”
When they finally catch Pietro, a full minute earlier than the last time Pietro was Target of the Day, Steve pats everyone on the back and walks back to Pietro to pass on pointers on how best to have defended against their aerial formations.
Bruce and Thor gape at Steve and Tony who stare back with wide, wild eyes and disheveled hair. Beside him, Bruce feels Thor beginning to shake. Probably with suppressed laughter which Bruce is also struggling with.
. But he would look back at all he had lost, all the things he couldn’t physically do, the living population who couldn’t even see him unless Tony was present, everything that was familiar and yet so different, and he’d give in to the need to move on. He didn’t really belong.
Taking a wet cloth from the trolley just outside the light, Steve wiped away the blood from his glove. He let the agent breathe through the pain, let him absorb the exchange.
He was going to find Tony. Bring him back. Put him back at Steve’s side. And they would make the world right again, together. Put it to how it should have been, if they had only worked together all those years ago.
This was well beyond T'Challa's position to deal with. "Zemo is secured in the Quinjet for transport," he said. He didn't wait to see if Stark connected the dots. He donned his black helmet and made to leave. Stark was mobile and not in need of immediate medical assistance. That had to be enough.
There was one thing he was craving, one thing to satisfy the itchy heat crawling beneath his skin and the thoughts inflaming his mind: Steve.
There was a roar in the distance, and Tony turned in time to see something massive and green jump from the departing Quinjet. The Hulk landed on the street with an enormous boom, heedless of the giant dust and concrete cloud he created. Tony hovered inches off the ground and let Hulk stand between him and Steve, hiding Steve from sight for a merciful moment.
That brought Tony up short. “How do you know you're not just fixated on me in particular because of the whammy? Because I'm the first person you saw?”
She tilts her head just so, letting one corner of her mouth run higher than the other. Tony narrows his eyes at her but doesn’t break the stare. Or the silence between them.
It was Christmas Eve and outside the floor-to-ceiling windows of Tony’s office, the twinkle of stars could be seen through the light polluted atmosphere. The traffic in the streets below was dwindling at the late hour but here and there, the strobe lights of ongoing parties flashed cheerfully. The lights from Rockefeller Center were still bright with revelers and Times Square, further down, was a kaleidoscope of color.
Steve didn’t know what was happening but his arm was hurting with every word exchanged as Stark’s fingers dug deeper and harder into his arm. From his side vantage, he could see Stark’s eyes tightening in the corners behind his giant sunglasses, incongruous with the shit-eating grin he had plastered on his face.
The young man takes it with a joyous smile and Steve almost smiles himself until he sees the young man’s cheeks turn the red and black of burning, and blood blooms all over his army fatigues.
He brushed a hand up Tony’s stomach, chest, over the numerous scars collected over the years, and he settled it over Tony’s heart. When Tony pulled off to thrust back again, Steve brought his other hand to Tony’s hip and dropped them onto the seat behind him. Tony cried out, squeezing tight around him as the fall and his own weight dragged Steve deeper into him.
Steve took his time; this was his favorite version of Tony, a Tony in a beautiful suit with all his buttons undone, his cock hanging heavy and his ass presented for Steve's taking. He leaned over Tony's bent form, enveloping him with his much larger frame, opening the buttons on his own shirt so he could feel the glide of Tony's jacket against his chest. He wanted to thrust into the clothed heat between Tony's thighs. He wanted Tony sprawled on top of him, rutting against him with the fabric of his suit rubbing the length of Steve's body. He wanted to do so many things to Tony in this suit. He gave Tony's cock a quick stroke and moaned into the fabric between Tony's shoulders, his lips feeling the breath heat the fabric through to Tony's skin until Tony shivered.
Tony looked away and rubbed at his eyes. “That makes even less sense. I wasn’t even close to existing when you died. Why would it be me?”
“I’ll be callin’ on Murdock for this, Stark. You needa be knocked down a peg. Can’t buy your way out of everything.” And with that, Tony was left alone in Steve’s custody. At least until Starnes returned with Murdock as he so promised.
He stowed his phone (telephone, computer, and the secret little tracking setup he’d taken five days to figure out how to turn off) away and tried to walk the paths like he always had early last century.
“I can’t believe you got off on being barged in on by our friends,” Steve says, still chuckling weakly.
His door buzzed at the twenty-three hour mark. It was Steve, and Tony almost wanted to cry at the overwhelming feeling of desperation that was coursing through his body. There was no other word for it. He was desperate. Every cell in his body had been stoked by his desire with every passing hour of the past day and he was almost at a breaking point with a simple
Tony needed Steve. He needed Steve’s mouth on him. He needed to taste Steve’s skin, leave his mark. He wanted to plaster himself to Steve, climb him like a damn tree, taste—
"You're free to stay for as long as you need," T'Challa said as he reached for Steve's proffered hand for a shake. "My doors remain open to you so long as your friend remains in my care."
“Captain Rogers has been at the door for the past half hour. I believe it would be prudent for you to hear what he has to say.”
“Fury, I’m having trouble believing that you’ll be keeping the repulsor engines out of SHIELD datab—“
There was a weak chuckle. Steve opened his eyes from his haze to glance down into Tony’s bright, happy eyes.
This was going to be the last time he let himself be called out by Kate after already having partied literally onto the roof with a bunch of rowdy Avengers. It absolutely did not surprise him that he ended up in a fight with some hooligans over something completely stupid. It absolutely did surprise him that one of the hooligans had physical enhancements and managed to get a punch in before they locked him down and gave him a telling off.
“Good night—morning, Steve,” Tony said, and leaned forward to plant a parting kiss on Steve’s slightly open lips.
After yet another half mile, he thought he saw something on top of the rails. He quickened his steps and after a minute, he could make out something that looked like the powder blue of Stark's favorite suit. The figure was wriggling, the movement now unmistakable as Stark's, and Steve almost fell over from the panic that rose up this throat.
"But," and Tony heard the hesitation in Steve’s voice loud and clear, "I couldn't stay because your voice and what you were saying about fucking me into surfaces was going to make me knock down the walls—"
In the end, the Stone had been taken to Asgard, and Tony had been left with uncertainties and an empty space by his side. The paranormal activities had lessened with the manifestation and stabilization of the Soul Stone and he’d taken on a more hands-off role with his consulting. He’d not gone on a mission with the Avengers and hadn’t been to a single meeting in person. He knew the others had been trying to get in contact with him but he’d passed them all on to Larry-what’s-his-name, his PA. This would be his first time facing the team in a long while and he was a fashionable twenty minutes early when he breezed into Conference Room Five with a confident smile pasted to his face.
“Rhodey!” Tony yells as he launches himself at Jim. Jim plants his feet before Tony almost bowls him over in a hug.
Stark had one wrist free from the rough ropes, placed under his head as if he were simply relaxing upon it. The other wrist was still bound to the iron rails above his head and each of his ankles were bound separately to the irons on the other side. If it wasn't for the bruises on his cheek, the abraded skin at his jaw, and the rough tangle of his clothes from his struggles, Steve would've been convinced. It didn't look like Stark was in pain and there was no blood visible – Steve breathed a sigh of relief. He dropped to his knees at Stark's bound feet and really let himself relax. Stark was far from getting free and Steve truly didn't want to think about what would have happened if he hadn't stopped the locomotive in time.
“Well I’m not calling them souls,” Tony muttered, thinking of Spengler’s baseless hypotheses on the matter.
They make it back to the hotel without incident and Jim manages to roll Tony into the bed of one of the bedrooms in their suite. Tony mumbles and rolls over the comforter, ass in the air, but Jim tugs him back to remove his shoes and then pulls the sheets from beneath him to cover him.
In front of him, Tony’s breath stuttered then ceased and Steve, always afraid of this happening whenever Tony dropped too deep into his cups, panicked. He lunged forward, pressing one hand to Tony’s chest to check his heart, and another to his nose and mouth.  He was about to slap Tony awake, having felt a steady beating beneath his hand, when Tony snorted once then opened his eyes and stared up at Steve.
“Bruce!” Sharon calls out, then rounds the island to give him a hug. “Join us for lunch? We've got plenty. Unless you have business elsewhere?” She looks over at Thor and receives a grin.
Another three hours and eight explosive, yet unsatisfying, orgasms later, he had an entire library of fantasies built up in his mind for things he could do with Steve – things he could do
Tony choked, eyes wide, skin turning pale, hands clutching at his chest. The arc reactor wasn’t glowing.
“Finally,” Stark said, his face turned towards Steve but not quite looking at him. “Was beginning to think you’d found another puppy and left me here alone to deal with the raff.”
And Natasha sees him begin to twist his arm out, palm back, as if to pat her on the chest like he would Cap or Rhodes or Thor, but he pulls back and shoots her a grin instead before starting the engine and driving off. She’ll have to introduce him to more gender neutral physical contacts but she’ll definitely count this as a win for her Operation: Getting Tony to Talk About Emotions So He Doesn’t Run Off To Blow Himself Up Every Now And Again. She has variations for almost all the Avengers. It’s a work in progress.
Tony seemed to shrink. He looked down, hand rising to massage at the light in his chest, the arc reactor. Steve’s anchor.
"We are men of passion," T'Challa said into the silence. "We cannot be faulted for our passions reacting to the death of a loved one. We can only learn to recognize this feeling and learn to never let it take hold of us ever again."
The Soldier flinched at the last word but he nodded and turned to the Captain. T'Challa stood silent as they made their decisions. The cool air of the Siberian mountains was very different to the warmer climate of Wakanda but it wasn't enough to chill the burning in anger still flowing through his veins. His father had been unfairly caught in the crossfires of an unrelated vendetta but it was done and in the past. The wound would heal and he would keep telling himself that until it truly did.
He shuffled back to the cot and forced himself to sleep by way of masturbating some more to the memory of Steve calling out his name.
Steve rammed the knife straight down behind the clavicle of the agent’s shoulder. The scream that followed was satisfying, if nauseating. Steve really didn’t like blood. He left the knife in and simply watched as the agent squirmed in pain, gurgling as half his lungs and the spaces around it filled with blood. Good. Only one person could call him those names anymore.
Steve, appropriately impressed, pulled Tony’s hand up to his eyes for a closer examination. Tony scooted closer to the bars and waited for the verdict. He held his hand loose as Steve pulled at the contraption this way and that, pushing up the sleeve of Tony’s coat and shirt to see how it was strapped to Tony’s forearm.
“That was the vibranium core,” Tony mused out loud through his breathlessness. “I’ve never heard of any ghosts reacting with their anchor like that but most anchors aren’t objects buried in people’s bodies. I’ll chat with Bruce. Don’t worry about it.” He felt invigorated, like the past few weeks of general fatigue had just rolled off his shoulders. Even his eyesight was less blurry and no longer bright around the edges. He ignored the tightness of a certain part of his anatomy though. Thank his foresight for the cup.
It was in the way Tony kept his hands firmly on Steve’s chest, a barrier between them, keeping the distance just wide enough, keeping a part of himself somewhere away from Steve; the way Steve took Tony’s hands by the wrists, planting them at the vulnerable skin of his neck, telling Tony to
It was Extremis that did it. It took away everything human Steve lov—liked about Tony. Tony Stark was a workaholic. Tony would always be a workaholic. But since Extremis, Steve was never able to catch Tony in his down time because Tony never had down time anymore; he’d programmed it out of himself. A very long time ago, Tony as Iron Man had likened himself to a machine, a robot. That was when he had a chest plate attached to himself all hours of the day. Now, Tony’s skin was pristine, wiped clean of all the little scars and imprints of injuries left through the years. Tony looked as gorgeous as he ever had, so soft and human except he
Tony yelped, a hand flying to cover the arc reactor, and backed into the bathroom, closing the door with a bang.
Okay. Not Bobbi’s lips. Not Bobbi’s hands. He hadn’t signed up for this either. He pushed himself up and away, then realized he was in the wrong room because everything really was in the wrong place. Okay, he was going to sleep in his own bed now. He mumbled an apology as he left, closing the door as quietly as he could.
“Can’t talk. Kid got away. Whammied us. No property damage. No civilians hurt. Probably. Hulk loose. Check on him. Ask J for details. Need time out. Don’t come knocking, sock on handle, etcetera.”
. Steve evidently felt it because he pushed Tony away to stare wide eyed at Tony’s hand. Tony looked down, and wished he hadn’t. His entire left arm was ashen and translucent, the power of the Soul Stone crackling in glowing streaks across his skin. Tony reached up with his right hand, nudging Steve’s gaze away from it.
Tony spun mid-air and took his mark. Thor summoned his lightning onto the Colonel and, while the Colonel was still dazed, Tony body-slammed into the Colonel’s head just as Thor swung his hammer into the Colonel’s chin in a powerful arc.
It was in the way Tony withdrew and let Steve chase after him, mouth open and inviting but spine stiff, guarded and hiding; the way Steve stroked his hands down Tony’s back, offering safety, offering support.
The Captain nodded, and then wrapped his arm around the Soldier as they hobbled slowly towards T'Challa.
There was a short flight home from this little trip; he could show Tony his appreciation then. That nice Tom Ford three-piece was ruined beyond all hope, but really, any suit was a good look on Tony. And sometimes even Steve had to admit no suit was an even better look.
