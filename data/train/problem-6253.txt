"Yeah, I noticed." Tony cut him off, engaging thrusters once more and wincing as they sparked and sputtered ominously.
"Glad you dropped in," Tony managed to get out through chattering teeth as he hastily got up from the table. His legs weren't quite ready to support him and he nearly slid to the floor, but Natacha was there bracing him against her good side and Tony wondered how she could stand it. He righted himself, ignored the way the room swayed and his skin prickled with sweat as his temperature spiked. His body was rapidly switching through waves of hot and cold as the extremis virus worked its way through his bloodstream.
And then he turned to Tony and looked him up and down in a way that sent a shudder down his spine and a stab of heat through his gut.
"Not if Stark has anything to say about it." A male voice interjects and everything goes quiet. Tony glances curiously around Aunt Antonia's wide shoulders to see a tall man leaning in the doorway watching them.
She was coming to realize that too, but she was unsure if the woman who thought such silly things and craved what she'd already tasted and found to be poison could be trusted.
His first real memory of Howard was when the man had come suddenly into the nursery after Mr. Jarvis alerted him to the fact that Tony had said his first words. Tony had been young, too young really to be uttering a full if somewhat garbled sentence, but he’d been ahead of the crowd even then. He still remembered the glint of anticipation in Howards eyes, the proud tilt to the man’s smirk as
"My friends, I know that there are many differences we have yet to overcome, but I must warn you that this test is not merely about your strength in battle. The Benu like the Kǫtrdýr is a creature of the mind and can only be overcome by the unity of strong minds. Any division will be used against you, any weakness in one will be exploited to distract the others. You must rely on each other, for it is the responsibility of Queen and Consort to hold the others up and guide the way."
How nice that Snowball and Black Jack would get to spend the rest of their days on a beautiful Gata Reserve.
“I didn’t ask you here to accuse you. There are a lot of unanswered questions, and we’re going to need to work together to find their answers.”
Jarvis and his mother are finding him tucked up in strange places. Usually in his father’s workshop.
"I don't know. I kind of wanted to see if Amee with two E's was going to hook up with that musician's tom." Bruce offered and Clint moaned, shooting him a betrayed look.
Just look at JARVIS. He was living, and growing more every day, and Tony was more than aware of how dangerously (tantalizingly) close he'd come to creating something (someone) whose programming mirrored his own, performing functions one would have to call a form of feeling and thinking, begging the question of when does simple mechanics become something more (something sentient).
The net was everywhere so it was pretty easy to find (thankfully) but, oh hey, turns out the world wide interweb is also mind-numbingly loud. Colors and sounds and codes rushed in all at once and Tony’s head felt like it split open. God it hurt. But he tried to think past it, tried to concentrate on just the parts he needed, traversing at lightning speed looking for just the right hub… And suddenly there he was in all his intricate beautiful code.
Tony grit his teeth but kept his face smooth. God but he hated how Natasha was right all the time, because that's what this was about of course.
"We won't let that happen." Steve promised, his jaw set, his gaze interestingly getter softer the more conviction he felt. Softness turned the corner into defensiveness as he shifted, uncomfortable with her stare. "You know when you look at me like that, I start to think you don't believe me."
"Or so you've heard." Natasha drawled, and there was something poignant there in her tone but Tony was too busy still reeling from the little gem of insight that if he started unscrewing digging too deeply into his teammates heads he could actually kill them. What the fuck?! Who had thought messing around with biology none of them fully understood was the smart thing to do here!
He performs under bright lights with Natasha and Clint, and rides the roller coaster on Coney Island with Steve.
“They muzzled you.” Tony let loose a vindictive huff of laughter and Fury glared at him. This was an interesting development. Favorable, in some ways considering his own plans but also dangerous to them. A partnership between the US government and Wakanda put everything Tony planed in jeopardy.  It was galling to admit it, but having glimpsed bits and pieces of their technology he wasn’t one hundred percent certain his own would come out the winner in a war with Wakanda.
Tony has heard this story before and normally he listens avidly because he knows this is his legacy and it is very important. One day he will be in charge and it will be up to him to make sure Stark Industries survives.
Dad had always said there was too much potential for jealousy and rivalry to pop up if they lost focus of the fact that first and foremost they were family.
“That’s full on nerd and one hundred percent perfect. Tony will have kittens when he puts it together.” Riri crowed in response.
“Absolutely nothing,” Tony answered him, already turning his thoughts away from their unexpected new addition to peruse the barn looking for things he could use to help see to Natasha’s wounds and go on the attack when it became necessary. What he wouldn’t give to have his suit right now.
“Alright. That significantly narrows down your choices because you’re going to need a LOT of growing room. Lets talk location. The Caribbean has a number of private islands for sale that could fit the bill, but you said you wanted close. There is a private island off the Atlantic coastline, not far off of Martha’s Vineyard. Big developer tried to buy it awhile back to turn it into a resort town but the guy who owned it refused to sell. Wanted to keep it in the family for his grandkid or something but the kid died doing a tour of Iraq. The fellow is ageing, and from what I hear the money’s not what it used to be. So, he may be interested in selling to a good cause. 125 square miles. Thriving vegetation and marine life. It’s a three hour flight to New York city by chopper but you can half that with one of those fancy jets of yours. But there’s a down side.”
YOU HAD BETTER EXPLAIN YOURSELF OR YOU’RE GOING TO BE IN FOR A NASTY HEADACHE THE NEXT TIME YOU TRY AND TALK TO MY SHIP.
She'd given most of her warmth to Tony, because the knee was completely busted. Tony carrying her gave her body time to start mending. When AIM caught up she'd have one good fight left in her. As it was, Tony was sweating bullets, his body shaking under hers with more and more fervor.
“You had us worried, but T’Challa said it wasn’t abnormal.” Bruce murmured, his hands gently skimming over Tony’s arm, expertly avoiding his tubing and Tony purred at the contact. He was so focused on Bruce he hadn’t even noticed T’Challa approaching in the hall through the clear doors.
"Is that Japanese?" Steve asked, nodding towards Bruce's book, doing his best to ignore the smug smile on Banner's face.
"They published a picture of us you know. Pile of nubile young kittens curled up on a blanket with margaritas in hand. Sold out in minutes. Howard was furious." Tony giggled, the taste of sour liqueur and salt lingering in his mouth. He blinked as the warmth of the sun faded, replaced by the low lights of the hallway. Wait why was he in a hallway? Where were Serena and the others?
A slash across the face and a blast to the chest later and the guy wouldn’t be getting up anytime soon. His partner thought better of being so closed and backed up, firing wildly as Tony rushed toward him, wrenching the gun out of his hands and punching hard. There was something satisfying about doing it with his bare hands, about watching the red lines appear on their skin, about knowing that even if they lived through their encounter with him they’d carry his mark for the rest of their days. They’d know better than to touch what was his. Everyone would know.
“Ha! Told you.” Harley crowed even as Clint was crying lies, but the kit was having none of it. “Captain America doesn’t lie. Right Tony? You said he was fundamentally incapable of lies and that he was delightfully paradoxical.”
"Guys?" He called again, not expecting an answer; he nearly jumped a foot when a voice readily replied.
As soon as he got out of this bed he’d have to make a trip to Queens and speak to the spider-boy, or whatever he was calling himself.
“Don’t try and touch him.” Tony jumped at the sudden return of that unfamiliar voice, glancing up with wild eyes to see another one of SHIELD’s field medics standing not far from him, hands outstretched as if she’d frozen mid movement.
Thor, perhaps to prevent the brewing squabble, swallowed his mouthful with a warm chuckle before commenting, “Jane complained that I smelled strongly of tuna fish last evening. It is a nice enough snack in moderation. I much prefer this…” Thor glanced toward the medic who was watching their interactions with a faintly amused glint in his eyes. “What did you call this dish?”
Rhodey had managed to throw his weight around and pull enough strings to get an interview, and the conversation they’d had was pretty demining all things considered.
Tony sucked in a sharp breath, shocked, humiliated, even angry (at this stranger, this presumptuous asshole who thought he had the right to judge, when he knew nothing of what Tony has done or what he’s been through) but then the air punched out of him and he was breathing again, raggedly… because it didn’t matter.
She’d been drawn back to Tony’s side as he began to thrash on the couch, his thoughts running wildly through her head with frightening magnetism, every brush of emotion and wave of pain dragging at her like riptide.
Coulson looked like he might say something, but he decided against it. He nodded shortly instead and said with a small smile, "Thank you Tony."
When Tony's first heat had come, Robert had been all for "allowing" Ty to see the Stark kitten, as if he hadn't been pushing Ty to woo him almost before the onset of puberty.
He came back to his surroundings an undeterminable amount of time later when small hands gripped his shoulders.
Even hyped up on extremis Ty was no match for an experienced fighter, let alone this completely terrifying display of pantherlike strength and motion going on in front of him. Tony wasn't actually sure he would have pit an actual ass panther against the guy.
He's free to be his own man and nobody's going to call him a bad kitty for it. Tony is what the public likes to call a bad kitty (in the best and worst way) and normally he doesn't give too much of a fuck, except you should see what certain factions like to do to bad kitties.
“Tony?” Steve’s breath is a humid plume against his skin as he leans close, eyes dark as they drink in what he’s doing to Tony, how he’s just wrecking him.
“But Steve lives and loves by extremes. By the time he realizes it’s time to let go, everything will be broken.”
It takes Tony’s brain a moment to catch up to the words, and then even longer to process them. To be fair, it’s extremely hard to think when your super-hot boyfriend has his hand on your dick and is trying to wring an orgasm out of you like his life depends on it – and it’s that, the desperate,
Not to mention, run the show if ever Jarvis should become compromised Clint thought, but he didn’t want to alarm the kits so he just shrugged and said, “Neato. I can still see at least a dozen missiles aimed at me from up here. Mind clearing me for landing?”
Damn him, but Tony was tempted to believe he meant it, to read something that wasn’t actually there into the praise – into a gift that could have been any expensive trinket, but was armor instead. Amor fit for a Queen. That strange fluttering in his chest died swiftly though at what the tom said next.
The probability of being awoken for Avenger related calls between the hours of midnight and six am held between 11- 28%.
"Tony?" Steve beseeched, eyes searching Tony's no doubt for some sort of sign  of where their earlier disagreement had left them.
“It’s great. It is, it’s just that you’ve got it wrong. Mr. Stark – Tony, I mean. Tony, I never applied for your internship.” He admitted with a forceful swallow. It felt like there was a lead weight in his stomach, dragging his insides to the floor. This was the single suckiest moment of his life.
Of all Natasha's handlers Ivan had been her favorite, because even in that nightmare there had been glimpses of sanctuary.
Tony had been in his head, had touched something inside him, and it had been the first time that insistent voice inside Steve that sad he wanted Bucky, needed Bucky couldn't (shouldn't) live without him, had been forced to recede.
Her blue eyes watched the area where three older kits played in the surf, all relatively close in age. Tony's eyes were drawn to the only girl in the trio. There were wet clumps of sand drying in the little girl's frizzy ringlets, largely because she and an older boy were engaged in a war that seemed to involve trying to shove sand down each other's throats and god was she lovely. Her warm honey brown skin was only getting darker under the bright sun, which was beginning to streak her wind-tossed mass of curls.
"She has a separate bed for afternoon naps." Clint pointed out, jabbing an accusing finger at the screen.
“The good news is that the degeneration can be successfully stemmed by an outside brain.” Tony swung the focus back around, tapping the side of his head with a falsely bright grin. “We don’t know at this time whether that is something all Gata can do or if it is a trick specific to the Queen brain, and seeing as we’d have to kill someone to collect any more data on it, we’ll just have to wait on that one.”
Getting that look kinda sucked, but Tony could sympathize with his situation. Getting saddled with Gata genes and not so much as a handbook for your troubles wasn’t an easy road to walk.
"I know it's been a rough year for us, and particularly a rough couple of months at the end; but my promise to you is that none of you are going to lose your home here. In fact I've been thinking a lot lately about the rebuild, about all the ways that we can make this place less of a pit stop between where you're going and where you decide you want to go and more of a home."
Luke join him in laughter, and Tony was high on the thrill of anticipation, proud of what he and JARVIS had accomplished and happy to be sharing it with his unexpected new friend. True friends came by Tony slowly but Luke was shaping up to be one of them. And as seemed to be Tony's nature, he wondered if there wasn't some way to keep him.
"Scheduled adjustments have been made Sir. Test samples have produced results with consistent nintey-seven percent accuracy." JARVIS promptly answered and Tony hummed in displeasure.
Only that time, the goods in question had been humans. No one had told him that Marko was dipping into the flesh trade, but why the fuck not? At least that’s how Barney had seen it. What the fuck did they owe a bunch of pink ears anyway? They’d been sold, just like this. Nobody had ever stood up for the likes of them.
“I’m getting that picture yeah,” Tony replied with an easy smile, and Peter’s face broke out in an elated grin but before he could even ask Tony was shaking his head and stating firmly, “but here’s the thing. You’re thirteen. I’m not going to pretend like I can stop you putting on that suit, but I am going to put training wheels on you, and you’re going to let me because you’re a smart kid who realizes that he’s got a lot to learn, and sometimes it’s okay to take a back seat and let the trained people handle these things.”
You might think he should be more concerned about his imminent death but there were two reasons that Tony was okay with this.
Coming soon: Birth of a Pride part 2, AKA the Avengers do Asgard and Tony and Steve reach an understanding. There are fireworks.
“They have a ship and it has the same cloaking tech their suits do.” Tony announced as he turned around, mind already focused on finding ways to either disable or combat that for the next go around.
A picture post for the Gata verse casted with child actors/models. You can of course continue to imagine them however you like but here are the visual references I use.
“And I am the King of Sokovia.” Pietro rolled his eyes. “You’re not fine, and when Pierce and the others notice they will terminate you.” Or worse went unsaid.
“There are differences. Jaime clearly bears your imprint.” Natasha stared at him and Steve groaned, dragging a hand down his face, because even as she was trying to talk sense at him some stupid voice in the back of his mind was whispering:  Yeah but not Tony’s. And maybe he wasn’t an expert on genetics like Bruce or Tony were, and he knew damn well that kids didn’t always look like both parents, but how do you explain them bearing a strong resemblance to a completely unrelated stranger?
Anthony Stark might be the only known feral queen in the United States but he was not the only option out there in the world.
"But what about school?" He asks, suspicious because it's just too good to be true. His father can't possibly want him at the yard, getting in people’s way when they are working on something so important (when he's just run off another tutor) but Mama is smiling at him and Ana is already reaching to pack up the food left on his plate.
“Bond with me,” Tony heard himself say. He totally hadn’t planned on saying that, but oh well. He meant it with every last fiber in his body. The feeling of
“Harley’s always been so smart, but the only thing that works faster than that head of his is his mouth I’m afraid.” Jena remarked, tucking a strand of her dark hair behind one ear nervously. Tony held back a flinch. He’d heard that sort of thing said often, about himself, and never with fondness.
There was shouting and gunfire as the mercenaries not blown out the door by the blast ordered him to stop, and, seeing that he wasn’t going to, opened fire. Tony was never going to be Natasha or Cap, but he’d sparred enough with them both to have learned a thing or two and besides that he didn’t need to be. He was Iron Man.
Tony let the door shut behind him with a snap and only then did he let himself release a slow shaky breath.
"Can't a guy like warm cream at night?" Tony grumbled as Bruce felt Natasha's tail brush against his, tangling in with the knot that he and Clint had already made with Tony's. She brought with her the smell of outdoors and the sweeter scent of fel.
When Tiberius had taken Tony under his wing and guided him through the often vicious waters of the pageant circuit Tony had believed it was because the other kat actually cared about him and not just because Robert wanted to keep tabs on Stark Industries. Stupid. He knows.
So not light work, by any means. Helen had passed out on the couch sometime early morning with Bruce (the white ear twitching as she slept while her black one remained curiously still) but Tony had used the sleep break to keep working on another little project he had going.
He aimed for the female, because she was the one with the guns and because the male had already shown his tick. Sure enough, as soon as Tony opened fire at her, her companion jumped in front to deflect his shots – the surface of his shield crackling and warping as the two forms of energy collided. The shield absorbed energy Tony filed away, though he itched to know how.
Screw that! Her parents, her aunts and uncles, they should have known better. All those lectures about family, about Pride, only when it had mattered they’d chosen sides just like they’d always warned her not to do. It had been so confusing watching her tight little family come apart, divisions forming left and right where there had never been division where she could see it before. The arguments. The fights they all thought they were doing such a good job hiding from her and her cousins. Idiots.
"That's the funny bit. I'll tell you what we're doing here Rogers, but first, do you want to know how they sold me on this gig to begin with?" Tony continued on before Steve could answer. "They sent Clint in to get my measure. You know, figure out what my pressure points were, what made me tick. But knowing Cyclops here, he already had a fair idea where to start because it's obvious he did the reading."
Princess nodded slowly, thinking over the words. But because she was sharp, Tony wasn't surprised at all when she asked, "You don't trust General Ross, you wouldn’t sell him weapons. Whose army are we supporting?"
“Is she really the Black Widow?” Harley whispered on a bated breath and Tony just about gave up. “I mean, she looks like her but-”
“I’m not sure that’s the best idea.” Rhodey objected, leveling a hard look at the other man that Tony had seen him level at subordinates often enough in the past not to be affected by it one bit.
Tiberius Stone and Maya Hansen. Their presence here with Killian whether willing or forced could only mean things had gone very badly.  Just how badly she'd have to wait and see.
“Neat. Are you hungry? I’m starving. Missed out on lunch. What do you like? Cheese burgers? Pizza? Indian? Ever had lobster? I could go for some lobster.”
"Not a damn thing." Fury snapped. "Stone expressed concern for Stark's role in the Pride Initiative and the stress it is putting on him. He suggested gentling therapy and offered his tom as a stud, but I had to inform him that a request of that nature had to go through Ms. Potts. I don't think Stone realized how specific his contract gets in regards to what authority SHIELD does and doesn't have over him."
right when Tony’s contented purrs were rumbling in his ear drums and messing up Steve’s head. So the fact that Tony would look at him and think, that’s the guy I trust to win the fight and bring you all home in one piece, it kind of made Steve go a little crazy in the head.
"Might be better to have a witness. I'm not a huge fan of Ty and Pepper's threatened to castrate me if I cause anymore incidents. If I do get the urge to start filling my bathtub with blood, I don't trust the others not to just help me."
“Wakanda has many skilled warriors, but the Dora Milaje are our best. Nakia and her sisters have been training in the art of warfare since the age of five. I think they can handle themselves.”
“I’ve been through every inch of Osbornes files. He’s definitely working with Trask.” Riri confirmed, making her way into the canteen, holding the case full of microchips ready to be installed back into the collars. “As long as Hydra still attacks the President next month and the team stops Project Oversight we’re still on track for the war.”
“He’s out on bail, but our lawyers got the judge to sit a while before posting.” Answered Pepper, looking every inch the kat with cream. “I’m sure he and Hammer had a lot to talk about. He wants to plea bargain.”
"You heard the man Tony. You should relax kitten." she heard Stone say and watched coldly as he slipped a hand into the soft strands of Tony's hair, the way she liked to do because it always made him go soft and warm and almost pliable in her hands; because she knew Tony liked it and such gestures were rarely given to him and Natasha rarely found herself in a position to offer them that wasn't a hundred percent about manipulation.
Neither of them were dressed suitably for the cold, though Natasha was slightly better off in her insulated uniform. Tony was still without a jacket in the torn in the clothes he’d been taken in, before he’d woken up in the AIM lab with the crazies.
“Quite.” Sonia answered succinctly, nodding her head slightly, the light coming in through the window casting a halo around her pale blonde hair.
He frowned but he couldn’t say that he was at all surprised by that admission. She leaned down to stroke one cheek with her hand and kiss his forehead.
When Tony walked in Natasha was the first to look up as usual. She looked deceptively well, but the devil was in the details. The way she held her mouth was too tight, indicative of discomfort and she was sitting on the counter. Something she normally berated Clint for because of hygiene, and Tony knew that Clint did because it was the only perch in the kitchen (besides under the table itself) with any cover from sniper fire.
Hughard like any good smith attempts to forge Tony into a weapon unto himself: something useful, something sharp, sleek, and penetrating, something that will cut its own path through life and never get taken.
On the other hand, Tony was pissed. And hurt, he admitted as he bit the inside of his cheek letting the pain ground him. That too.
He no longer needed the armor in order to open fire at his enemies. He was the weapon now. As Tony's heart pounded in near manic elation some mad part of him had the thought that the only thing better would be if he could become the armor too. Then he'd be... well then he'd well and truly be Ironman wouldn't he? The cocoon finally left in his wake. The metamorphosis he'd started in a cave long ago in the desert sand finally complete.
“Oh.” Now Harley looked embarrassed as he sought the captain’s eye, posture full of apology. “Sorry Steve.”
“Asset 32X.” The soldier sneers in answer, feeling an inexplicable swell of vicious satisfaction as Tony blinks and the space around the warbles.
The she-tom abandoned her post near the doors where she’d been holding silent vigil and slinked her way towards them, her steps powerful and fluid as she moved. She was dressed down, her hair braided down the center of her skull, her powerful body camouflaged in jeans and a leather jacket that did little to distinguish her from any other New-Yorker, but there was no disguising her from what she was. It was just there, in the way she held herself, in the bright gleam of her sharp teeth and the ripple of muscles working under the smooth dark skin of her throat as she spoke.
“Why can’t we just show them the video?” Anya asked with a petulant pout of her lips, flicking her red ponytail over her shoulder. “The other Avengers believed us when we showed them.”
T’Challa’s face remained impassive but the dash of something peppery in his nose told Tony the tom was irritated. He grinned.
. And though he didn’t say it expressly like that the kid seemed to get it because he turned and ran from the room, and not a minute too soon because a second or so after he disappeared from view Tony heard the front door being kicked open.
And okay, he and Steve weren't on the best footing, but the whole package was like his kryptonite (a sexy guy who knew what he was about and an even sexier deadly weapon comprised of one of earths most rare elements) so he would have enjoyed watching Rogers kick ass down there if not for the way he just literally ordered one of their teammates to carry him off like a disobedient child (or worse, some helpless damsel) when Tony can see very well that Steve won't make it to Clint in time and he's pretty sure he's the only one who has figured out how to beat these assholes.
"Will it make much difference?" Bruce asked, trudging along behind Clint, his ill-fitting armor clanking as he moved. "Thor said these things are physic right? So they have to know we're coming. Won't they all have flown away?"
The second time he was woken by an increasingly loud and conversation so close to his head it could only have been inside it.
“If you want a slice of the pie yes. Helen’s research is going to change the world and you know what they say, the future waits for no one.” Tony confirmed with a contented smile, biting off a portion of lobster off the tip of his fork with satisfaction. Tony loved winning, he wasn’t going to apologize for it. Who would? Winning was awesome. T’Challa slowly shook his head, chuckling, and the tension dispersed as the tom reached for his glass of wine.
Steve Rogers, former captain of the football team, local army hero, not to mention Sarah’s only blood child. So Tony was well aware there’s a good chance he was about to see Steve again after fifteen years of purposefully
Ah. So that was how Tony had known that stuff about Wakanda and the dead general. He was talking to the machines again. Steve didn’t understand technopathy (as Tony gleefully insisted on calling it) only that Tony’s brain seemed to be the ultimate computer and could talk to other computers now. Until he ran across a system more advanced than the human brain, according to him there was virtually no limit to what he could access.
He could hear Pepper in his head, telling him that he deserved to be happy, but his heart was still beating rabbit like in his chest, and some manic little voice in his head kept whispering ominously that winter was coming, until he had to bite his lip to sop himself from breaking out in giggles like a crazy person.
“I worry and I plan and I do everything I can to keep one step ahead, to keep that from ever happening, but there’s stuff out there I can’t control and maybe next time I won’t beat it. That’s just the vulnerability I have to accept, the open target I have to place on my heart and wear out in public, and that’s
Another man might have been touched. As it was, Ivan could only feel the irritation of clashing directions within him. The wrongness of their words grating against a feeling of rightness so deeply imbedded it required excavation of a sort.
Tony survived surgery! What's a plucky young Queen to do but go out and claim new land and build a glorious new Pride? He's got the land and he's getting the people together. Now all he's gotta do is secure a helpful mate to help him manage it all, but Tony's got like 99 problems and the Winter Soldier is definitely one.
“And you say this virus is regenerative in nature?” Luke asked with his brow furrowed deeply. “Why do you feel then that it was used by the terrorists?”
story. The precursor to Project Rebirth and known best to the public as Bucky Barnes, Captain America’s fierce and staunchly loyal lap kitty.
would sweep into the nursery where Tony had been born and nursed by his mother (or attended to by Mr. Jarvis when Howard had better uses for her time) and would have some new puzzle for Tony to solve or problem to work out, each one harder than the last and the punishment for failure more severe. And of course, Howard somehow always managed to expect both failure and perfection from Tony.
And the answer to that had been fairly straight forward. Of course not. It didn’t change anything. Tony hadn’t been lying either when Meeting with Killian was still the best way to draw AIM’s attention away from his teammates and it wasn’t like anyone had actually expected for Robert Stone not to be tangled up to his eyeballs in the whole mess.
"It's M.O.D.O.K buddy, MORDORK is just something I say because he was an idiot." Tony waved away the explanation and tried to get them back on point as Fury heaved an aggravated sigh.
“Right now?” Princess asked, a hint of dark humor tilting her mouth upward. “No. I doubt it. My family is broken now. That’s why I’m here. I have to fix things.”
Bruce was sitting up in the bed, hair still sleep mussed but glasses perched at the end of his nose, when Tony poked his head out of the bathroom to look at him. He appeared to be contemplating it rather deeply.
"Hey, JARVIS, Buddy, what the hell?" He'd cursed as he'd ripped off the welding mask to glare in the general direction of upward (god he was getting as bad as Cap).
But then pain splintered through the pleasure, the pain of twisting muscles and cracking bones and his strength was fading, Clint’s voice along with it.
Fair warning: hearts are gonna get a bit messy here on out. No way around it. Expect many changes from canon. The only promise I make is that the Avengers Pride comes out strong on the other side, there's another wedding and somebody has a baby.
Seeing his expression Bruce chuckled. Though he fiddled some with the tubes still implanted under Tony’s skin, Tony knew he was only doing it to touch him. Bruce’s need to touch him was almost louder than his thoughts but Tony didn’t mind. He found an answering need swiftly rising up within him until it was as sharp as an ache.
Steve took a deep breath and leaned forward to grip the metal sill of the observation window and let the breath out slow, fighting the urge he had to break the damn window and grab Tony out of there and run him to safety. It wouldn’t be safe, not really. The nano-bots had bought them time, but without the BX it was just bandages and tape. Bandages that could be ripped off at any moment.
Mr. Hepburn had been annoyed with him for raising his hand, but Mr. Hepburn had always been annoyed with Peter. He rarely called on Peter unless it was to embarrass him with one of the hardest questions and he made Peter sit by himself in a desk near the teacher’s desk so he wouldn’t bother the other kids.
Which was great. Good. When he was willing to play ball (and of course he would be) he knew where to find Tony.
"Tonight? It's like... What the hell time is it, even?" Tony demanded and his A.I. helpfully filled in.
If T’Challa felt any pain from his thinly covered feet smacking against vibranium he didn’t show it. The agile tom rebounded off the surface of the disk and used his momentum to flip backwards and land at a crouch, but not before his leg came around to try and kick Steve’s legs out from under him.
He could have done alright, just coming to terms with that, but then Tony had shared that memory with him, part of the dream he’d had on Asgard, and there was just no way that Steve could handle it and everything else at once. No way to explain to Tony what seeing that little boy had ripped open inside of him.
Tony opened his mouth to decline (because there wasn't a chance in hell) but at some point the rest of the team had begun to make their way to the bar, because they were suddenly all there, forming a deceptively unthreatening cage around Tony and Natasha with Ty trapped in the middle. He looked understandably uneasy about this.
“We need to slow down the serum. Reduce the strain on his body.” Bruce’s fingers began to punch in commands but Helen’s hand darted out to still him, the fel shaking her head adamantly.
That list included commandeering the nearest cell phone (which was unfortunately Granny’s) and parts from the ancient computer in the den which in turn meant barging in on a snoring Mrs. Keener. The woman choked on a startled scream at the rude awakening and took a moment to get herself oriented but once she seemed to understand that she wasn’t being robbed and that the strange kat rifling through her purse and yammering about getting in her car and calling the police didn’t seem to be armed, she got furious (and nasty).
Steve pulled him into a tight hug, chest rumbling with chuckles against Tony's as he murmured, "Thank you, Tony."
"Did I say army?" Tony feigned surprise. "I meant security officers. The island will need them. We can't have flesh sharks and rival tech company’s buzzing around trying to steel either our tech or vulnerable citizens can we."
"Aye, my friend." The big blond nodded. "If you desire a place at the table a representative from your house must participate. And certainly, if you wish an audience with Queen Bastet you must prove your valor. It is the Kǫtrdýr way."
The twins are staring at him, perplexed but not overly concerned. They are used to his silence and long bouts of staring into space by now.
"Yes Sir," Tony answers promptly because he's not stupid enough to get on Hughard's nerves when there are torpedoes at stake.
"You dare much Anthony of House Stark." She warned him lowly biting delicately from the meat she cradled between her claws. "But thankfully for you, I admire your audacity."
“My mother N'Yami is Queen of the Panther Pride and the head of the Pride Council.” T’Challa laughed at some private joke. “But she is not the queen of Wakanda. That title belongs to my Second-Mother Ramonda. She is a very sweet woman, since you ask.”
“The separationist? You do surprise me Tony. I’d have thought you’d be all for Together and Equal.” Sonia mused.
“Your mother and Father won’t be pleased with Mr. Vonkov’s conduct, Tony. You can be sure of that.” Jarvis says and Tony, who is munching on one of Ana's apple tarts, shakes his head woefully as he mumbles.
“I’m coming, Tony.” Tony heard Steve panting over the comm, no doubt running full speed in their direction. But that wasn’t good, because that would leave Clint outnumbered and outgunned with the girl with the dancing fingers and creepy powers.
“Stark’s done everything twice, backwards, and probably naked the second time.” Clint agreed, unhelpfully.  "And just my advice, don't try and get him naked on the first date. He'll probably let you since he's crushing on you, but you'll spend the rest of your relationship trying to unfail a test you had no idea you were taking."
On the other hand if he refused to help, Tony would only become more suspicious of Wakanda's involvement in their strange enemies sudden appearance.  He was well aware that he was pinning the tom between a rock and a hard place. He was banking on it.
They were both there in the tower, but lately with everything they had going on, it was like they only really saw each other when they crashed into bed at night.
“Woah, even I have to admit that sounds like some gumball machine science fiction. And I can manipulate chaos magic! Am I the only one who thinks this sounds insane?” Billy asked, crossing his arms looking skeptically around the table.
“Unidentified vessel, you are approaching a no-fly zone. Please identify.” A familiar voice filled the cockpit, its confident professionalism ruined by the thread of excitement the kid could barely contain.
Giggling Tony went back to counting. Clint was hanging upside down over Thor's shoulder. That was one and two. Bruce was trudging along behind them, eyes wide and a blissed out little smile on his face. That was three. Steve and Natasha were bringing up the rear, with Steve largely supporting Natasha who looked white as a sheet and in danger of losing her dinner. Four and five. Yay. Oh shit weren't there six? Where was number six?
“She likely had another ten minutes left in her,” T’Challa allowed with amusement. Glancing apologetically in Rhodey’s direction he concluded, “But I was hoping that I might have a word with you alone.”
I am so sorry for how long this has taken. It has been sitting in pieces on my computer. I intended it to be longer and cover the actual confrontation between the Avengers and Bucky's crew but things are super busy right now it would just take me twice as long to get it out there and I was at a good stopping point. Thank you for your patience.
“Bringing the floor down Cap, which means that when it drops you can’t be on the bridge. I’m going to need you.”
Whatever it is, the point is, Bruce is his friend and that's more important to him than the whole Pride thing, and for Tony  that's everything.
“So, there’s no reason why today you can’t take a little time to yourself. You’ve been working so hard I’m sure you could use the break as much as Prince T’Challa.”
“What?! No. I told you it was a spider. It got loose when he was showing me something in the lab and I got bit. That’s all I can tell you, but it wasn’t his fault. Master Osborne wouldn’t hurt me!”
“You think too loudly.” Bruce mumbled, nuzzling closer to bury his nose against the side of Tony’s neck, subconsciously rooting out the lingering notes of heat scent. Tony huffed.
“Amory knows a lot more than most doctors.” Nyota pointed out. Her aunt and uncle had both been doctors (although technically Uncle Bruce hadn’t been that kind of doctor) and as a result Amory probably did know way more than Jaime was giving him credit for.
His first day on the job he'd been greeted personally by Pepper who'd apologized for Tony's absence and explained that he'd be working with her as a second assistant and that if he did well, the placement could become permanent, as she was looking for someone to take on some of the more menial tasks in order to help free up her schedule for more important things.
“In the barn?” The kid shook his head, mouse brown hair flopping as he shrugged. “Only when Mom’s not home, otherwise I stay in the house with her and old Mrs. Keener. Dad used to stay with me so I didn’t get scared but when grandpa died Mrs. Keener sold him. That was six years ago.”
Tony was less concerned with the flirting (because people flirted and it didn't always mean anything, he's the prime example) and more concerned with figuring out who the guy was and what he wanted, because that little bombshell he'd dropped about Steve. That did not sound anywhere near good.
That had Tony’s heart jumping in alarm, indignant heat tingling in his cheeks as he shot to his feet with a warning hiss. The world spun a bit and he wobbled but the medical aid was there a second later to provide a steadying hand, a small hint of amusement in his eyes as he murmured, “I see that my assistance is not needed.”
He flushed, embarrassed to be getting a scolding in public but shook his head adamantly in answer. His uncle T’Baru was a brave and mighty hunter and more than that, a very kind and wise man. He thinks the world of his uncle.
They shot at him of course, but the armor took their bullets in stride and he didn’t hold back (couldn’t hold back) as he fired back, only satisfied when their trucks lit up and sent gears and metal flying every which way, and he’d sent these masked clowns scattering like the cowardly terrified mice they are.
“The bastard shot right through her and we lost Novak.” Clint grunted, eyeing Steve with unveiled suspicion. “I stayed on his ass when things went to shit but he was relentless. He had it out for her from the drop.”
“Tony, I told you. I loved Bucky, and he’ll always be important but that doesn’t make what you and I have less important to me.”
Tony realized of course what he was asking.  It was an unavoidable truth that if T'Challa was correct about these child soldiers being trained in the same ancient martial arts as wakandian warriors, that by helping Tony find ways to defeat them he would effectively be providing him with the means to overcome his own defenses.
"I wouldn't suggest that."Coulson returned calmly from where he stood beside Fury at the head of the table. "Time travel is not as far outside the realm of possibility as it used to be."
I really hope you enjoyed and am excited to hear what predictions you might have. Next chapter Rhodey comes to town and we're going to get to hear from Natasha, who is going to be very busy trying to figure out who is behind the 'exploding people' while Senator Stern and the government goonies try and take the Ironman armor for themselves. Clint's still a terrible patient and Steve's not much better but at least they're back at the tower. She likes her boys where she can keep an eye on them.
Thankfully for the security of his tower and the world, this isn't ancient Egypt. Whatever Nick Fury thinks, under no circumstances was Tony going to be responsible for the ramifications when this little social experiment went tits up.
“I hate it when my Rumiko is out of sight too. She’s such a good girl, but she does manage to find trouble.” The old woman smiled tenderly down at the fel sitting on the lowered chair beside her. At least she’d allowed the poor woman a chair. Some of the kats attending the dinner with their masters were forced to sit on cushions beside their masters chairs.
“You’ve got a party coming your way Legolas,” he warned, and he heard Clint grunted an acknowledgement.
He's still a child in some ways. He is like Hansel, relying on cleverness to keep faith in an ideal that has already betrayed him in the hopes of one day returning home.
She’d fallen down the rabbit hole but made the maddest of friends. It was Ivan who found her in the burning house when she was a small girl mewling with terror. Ivan the soldier.
“Yeah, looks like it,” Tony confirmed firing a repulsor toward Barnes because he’d learned from all those real but not real confrontations they’d had on the meta plane. Barnes dogged the blast, returning fire even as he ducked and rolled, the bullets pinging loudly off of the armor as Tony set after him.
“We’re going to begin administering the BX-Serum, which should begin to immediately absorb into the bone.” Bruce’s voice filtered through the speaker. He sounded calm at least. “Extremis will likely attempt to fight this at first. At that point we’ll close the cradle and it will hopefully keep the patient’s body regenerating fast enough that the BX can fuse with his DNA and Extremis accepts it as a part of the host body.”
But Andre continued to smirk, oblivious to the fact that Tony was only paying attention to him at all because he was still negotiating with his mistress and insulting her favorite lap kitty wouldn’t do him any favors.
While Thor had never had his brothers gifts when it came to subterfuge he'd never resented or feared them the way that some had. Wars were not won with brute strength or numbers alone. It took a marriage between minds like his and minds like Loki's (like Tony's).
“There is no feminine distinction for God in my language. A god is a god is a god, and my people believe there is only one worth worshiping. She is life giver and protector. Our power and our strength come through her. To my father’s shame I have never counted myself as very spiritual,” Luke turned back to Thor, a look of stunned awe beginning to take up residence as he finished. “But you say you have met her.”
– but Extrimis pretty much meant he was never going to have to worry about dry or thinning hair in his lifetime, and he was fine with clearing up some space in his bathroom for an in shower coffee pot anyway.
it. Mr. Stark would be impressed with how strong he was now, Peter was sure of it. And he could tap dance. He was the only boy in school he knew who could. But maybe Tony would be more impressed with how great he was at flips? He cold flip off the walls now! Maybe Tony would smile at him and tell him he wasn’t bad, just because he wasn’t tame. Did Peter smell like that? Peter didn’t think anybody could be bad who smelled like that.
“What’s in it for me?” the kid’s tone had turned mulish which didn’t bode well for not wasting time and Tony really wished the barn had been occupied by someone older for half a moment before he acknowledged that perhaps he wasn’t being as careful with this small being and his feelings as he could be. Literally anybody else would have been better equipped to deal with this than he was.
The kit has been to this corner store what feels like a million times, but (he) knows that’s wrong. He doesn’t know this place, or this kit, or why (he’s) wearing his skin. But it feels good. The kit is young in a way that is felt in the bones, unburdened by years of training and the weight of hands that have taken life again and again and again.
Maybe if dad had spent less time arguing with Steve about what was and wasn't morally acceptable at the end of the world, maybe he'd have thought up a better way.
Nyota had heard stories growing up about the slave trade in the states. She’d been warned direly about the dangers of venturing outside of Resilience on her own and whenever the family traveled to Wakanda they did it under armed escort. She knew what life was like for Gata before her dad had founded Reliance, but hearing about it, even looking things up online, wasn’t the same as seeing it with your own eyes.
He's soft and Hughard knows it. Hates it. Tries to press it out of him with growing anxiousness as if Tony is a volatile chemical mixture that the slightest nudge could unleash chaos.
“It’s going to be harder than you think Nyota. One wrong move and we could completely fuck everything up.” Jaime had lowered his voice and leaned closer across the table, maybe in hope that the others would be too distracted by the news program to hear.
The nananorobots had done their job, reinforcing his tissue, building a bridge for that electromagnetic energy to travel down and conducting the wave to two single exit points.
T’Challa’s smile had faded and he didn’t look happy as he replied, “I must return for a time. I have obligations that cannot wait, and I must alert my Father to these mercenaries who appear to have stolen our technology.”
He is better now for being wiped clean. But his superior genetics while desirable, also posed many complications. His mind is a glorious tool that even their greatest scientist could not completely conquer.
She wondered what it said about her that she felt so innately protective of his slumber. Perhaps it was what Bruce was calling the 'pride effect'.
Pepper stroked his arm but her eyes didn't leave fury as she stared him down, her words clipped and equally forceful, "You didn't take it because you couldn't. I expect to be informed if Mr. Stone or anyone else approaches you about Tony. If Stone so much as looks at Tony I expect to know, or our legal team will show you just how tight that contract actually is. "
"So what does this mean? Are we like official now?" Clint asked, hope creeping into his voice as his gaze bounced wildly between the three of them. "Are we all going to bond?"
“Yes Captain,” Jarvis answered the lights in the gym dimming momentarily as the floor began to shift and the platforms both teams were standing on began to raise.
, over a stupid thing like a glimpse into another reality where Bucky had lived and Tony was some sort of beloved uncle figure. Why risk what they were building over a something that didn’t matter in the long run and would only hurt him?
Yes. Natasha's eyes jerked back to a glimmer of light and the shadow of a barn shaped structure in the distance.
“And yet, people find something about watching your husband hump a fifteen-year-old distasteful. Imagine that.” He replied, reaching for his drink. Then he added, like it was an afterthought, “Which I’m sure you do, constantly, what with the company stock in the shit hole and all the public embarrassment.”
“No. I’m always happy to help you T- Mr. Stark, I just I don’t know what I’m agreeing to help with.”
“Hi there.” Tony managed to grunt, wincing as he lifted his arm to get a look at his hand, which felt like he’d stuck it in a campfire. Ugh, and it looked like it too, bloody and raw with violent burns, his repulsor a smoking ruin of twisted wiring and metal. He took a deep breath and let it out slow as a low chuckle emitted from his masked accomplice.
Tony began to ask, cutting off as an alarm went off inside, a heady spike of fear coming from Princess and Natasha in tandem.
Even though Sam didn’t look unstable and he didn’t smell it either, Steve knew better than to judge a book by its cover. You didn’t live that kind of life without taking on a few scars.
“I told you to go!” her male companion cried out as he took the chance to get back up. Tony had also had time to get back on his feet and with a kickstart of his boot thruster he was headed straight for the female, who was preoccupied enough with making Steve’s life miserable that this time when he fired at her she wasn’t quick enough to doge.
He guessed he could say he was one of the lucky ones, though Steve had never been one of those kid’s eager to leave town as soon as he was able and never look back. That had come later. There had been a time when he’d have been very happy staying put in Richardsville, but those days dreams had gone up in smoke a long time ago, and the reason for that was currently waiting at the Pembrook Hospital where his mother was being treated for Hodgkin's.
"She doesn't know just how closely tied her people's evolution is to the Benu and their regular consumption, just that they're dangerous. How can she? So she goes on a suicide mission because there's a chance that she could finally be at home somewhere, like she's never been before. She drives them out and doesn't even realize that she's weakened the evolutionary track of her entire line."
It struck the post just as Clint landed, sending the structure wobbling and the athletic tom scrambling to stick his landing.
Tony looks surprised and delighted to hear him speak. In these dreams Tony talks a lot. The soldier never bothers. He knows only that if he’s stuck inside his head, speaking to phantoms, that somewhere out there he might not be paying attention and that is deadly.
She felt the light touch of concern brush her thoughts before she even lifted her eyes to acknowledge Steve staring at her.
Ana comes to see why they are late for lunch. He doesn’t turn around to look at her but he hears the shocked inhale of breath she takes at the sight of the livid bruises and welts across the back of his legs. Vonkov tells her that Tony will not be eating until he has finished his punishment.
“You’re damn right you’re not.” Tony hissed through sharpening teeth. Natasha breathed steadily through her nose laboring for calm.
“The best I can invent. Haven’t gotten it perfect on the lead in but they do the trick for the cleanup; but enough about my jacked up reproductive cycle. Let’s talk about something really sexy, like this baby here.” Tony patted the gleaming side of the Cradle and let his hand run over its smooth metal surface.
“Indefinitely?” Jena’s voice lilted upward toward shocked. “I thought it was just till the house was renovated?”
. You gave me a home.” Steve raised Tony’s hand – there were a lot of people touching his hands today, he thought, and just as quickly he thought of Queen Bastet watching them, telling them that the future was in the hands of the builders, wishing them sure hands. Steve pressed a kiss against his wrist, breath warm and moist against the sensitive skin. Tony bit back a sob as relief and elation flooding through him as Steve whispered urgently, wiping at the tears that were sliding down his cheeks out of nowhere. Crying definitely had not been on the menu. When had he started doing that?
“My sweet boy, who thinks with so much passion and not enough with caution.” She kisses his cheek and he hugs her tight. She rises with him, and he burrows against her chest, breathing in her wonderful familiar scent.
"How did you know about the trace?" Tony asked, no beating around the bush; though he didn't expect a straight answer so he was surprised when he got one.
In reality, the 'Avengers Pride' had started with Project Rebirth, with Steve (its first Avenger) and Howard Stark’s legacy. Whether Tony liked to hear it or not (Bruce wouldn’t suggest bringing it up) Tony carried that legacy. He carried it well. He'd done more than Bruce imagined his father could have ever dreamed for him. What they were all doing here was only possible because Tony and Steve had made it possible with their individual contributions to the world.
When Tony had been twenty-one, newly orphaned and suddenly independently wealthy, his first thought had been not how to run a multi-billion-dollar company but getting as far away from his childhood home as he could. He’d gone to a dozen brokers, each one of them smarmier and more condescending than the last. Despite the fact that the meeting had been booked in Tony’s name for Tony, they’d all greeted Obie first and had cute things to say about how they were sure they could find his dream home for him and his kitten.
“I enjoy you Captain Rogers.” The prince murmured, snapping his focus back to Steve and weirdly, Steve believed him, even though the sharpness in the toms smile let him know he was going to enjoy kicking Steve’s ass far more.
Ivan will have to give Pietro low marks for his continued misbehavior, but it won’t matter. With abilities like theirs, the twins would have to be serious fuck ups to be deemed failures and terminated like the others. Of all the kats to come out of the program at castle black, Ivan found the twins by far the most interesting. It’s why they are still alive.
Tony shook off his growing hysteria. He couldn’t let the fear that this guy (or girl) whoever they were was smarter get to him. He
I am SO SORRY this took ages. It was meant to include Tony meeting Peter for the first time and the team getting called out to fight the mercenaries again but I didn't want to keep people waiting. If you're still here and wanting more of this story let me know. I am holding to my promise that as long as you're here I will do what I have to in order to finish.
“I’m only thirteen.” He admitted on a mumble. Maybe there was some other Peter Parker somewhere who had applied. Some college kid who had worked really hard and deserved to be where Peter was sitting. Except… Tony had known about his dad and Aunt May, he thought a moment later, confusion waring with disappointed certainty that somehow there had been a mix up.
Agent Coulson, sitting up in the passenger’s seat turned to glance back at them, eyeing the aide momentarily and then the cup in his hand.
He has no whiskers, so if the woman doesn’t sell to him it’s not because she has any sort of prejudice against kats with jobs and money of their own to spend. It’ll be because he’s an intimidating stranger and a scowling one at that.
“How bad is it?” Bruce asked and Sif, who had followed them from the edge of camp to help, along with Fandral, laughed not unkindly in response.
She had the distinct look of the well fed and well cared for about her, and a surprising amount of muscle on her bones. She’d have lost points for that at the pageants, but regained a few with the sleek black fur on her tail and ears, uniform in color and even darker than the thick nest of curls on her head that she’d barely managed to tame into a ponytail.
Finding out that his teammates were still having powerful dreams they’d approached Thor about it. His best guess had been that their bodies might not be able to shake off the effects of the Benu's magic as well as Asgardians. Steve had given him an earful. He had a lot to say to Thor about giving the team proper warning before throwing them into potentially deadly situations, without all the necessary information. Even Tony had backed him up on that one, and Tony wasn’t exactly the kind of guy known for caution.
“Bucky don’t say that!” Steve’s attention snapped back to Bizzaro Barnes, voice cracking like his heart was breaking all over again (it is) but Bucky just talked over him.
"My parents died young," Papa explains. "Being an orphan meant I had to grow up fast and make my own way. Obi and I started Stark Industries from nothing, saved every penny we could make to by a shack at the edge of the river and scraps to start building. "
There was a third option here, one that T’Challa had not mentioned though it was obvious to Tony with everything he now knew about Pride structure. Queens could peacefully coexist. They didn’t have to wage war on each other. Especially if Steve and Natasha would only end up as the battle ground. Bucky could become pride too. He could become part of the family. Neither one of them had to relinquish anything. But for that to work their had to be trust between them. Tony had to be able to trust that Bucky was as much his as the others were, and that he’d never try and take the Pride away from him.
So as the stairs were rolled out and everybody waited with baited breath for the doors to open to catch their first sight of Prince T’Challa, Tony was mentally gearing himself up for the fight ahead. It took him by surprise when Ross (Everett K. not dear old Thaddeus) chuckled under his breath and rocked on his heels for a moment as if he couldn’t quite contain his glee.
He heard the familiar voice and strength was flooding through him. He was a boy, running through a back alley, desperate to escape the pursuit of the police. He was Clint. He was young and strong and the whole world was his for the taking. There was an older boy, running just slightly ahead. They both carried backpacks, hats jammed low on their heads to cover their ears.
“Speaking of our foreign friends, Prince T’Challa has a proposition for us,” Tony segued with a serious note and they all straightened up silently in wait.
“Looks like you had the party without us.” Steve commented neutrally, eyes turning back to Tony as the kit rushed to his side.
“You kiss your mother with that mouth Cap?”  a cheery voice called and Steve looked up to find Tony sauntering across the gym, stepping over fallen arrows and smoothly around obstacles and grinned. The room just seemed brighter with him in it.
The little voice that whispers this is what he wants, what he was made for, can just go fuck itself because the truth is he can’t have this because he can’t protect it. Someone had almost taken these kits and he knew he’d never survive it if it were a child of his own. And if Tony Stark Genius Billionaire
Steve looked shocked as Tony spat out the words with vehemence, keeping unusually silent as Tony rose from his chair to jab his finger in Fury's direction.
"Why do you always gotta make it weird man?" Rhodey groaned. Clint for his part just stuck his tongue out in Tony's direction, but Luke seemed curious about this.
Tony glanced down at the device still clutched in his free hand, deliberating for a moment if he should show her before he showed the other interns.  He had plans for Stark Resilient’s first line of defensive weapons, and he had this little baby right here in his hands to thank for them. But those projects were months down the pipeline and without being able to get thing open he reasoned it wouldn't be giving her too much of a leg up above her peers.
Okay so the next few chapters are going to focus on the team and Tony's individual friendships with each member; because the Avengers becoming a family is what this is all about. Obviously, a major change is T'Challa's arrival so early in the game. I felt this was necessary for him to fully integrate within the pride.
Bruce sounded grave, Clint looked pissed, Thor looked pensive, Natasha looked like she was being very careful not to look like anything, and Steve looked like he might try and throw Tony over his shoulder and run away with him if he didn’t fall down into a dead faint first.
"No." Steve's slightly panicked expression was quickly replaced by an authoritative snap that Bruce could only wince at. "Thank you, but I'll pass."
Right, after that first run in with Magneto and Emma Frost he’d outfitted all the safe rooms in the tower to be able to resist telepathic attacks. That answered why he couldn’t feel Natasha or feel any of the others besides Bruce but it didn’t tell him what the hell was going on.
“It wasn’t your fault.” Tony said, calmly, but Steve knew he was just trying to make the best of things. But when he opened his mouth, Tony’s eyes narrowed and his ears arched dangerously and Steve slowly closed it again.
“They’re all morons.” Natasha muttered darkly, only Bruce and Tony were party to the waves of protectiveness underlining each word, but it was an unspoken feeling he suspected they all shared.
After awhile though even Tony's high beams weren't cutting through it and he was in danger of flying into a tree George of The Jungle style and was forced to call a halt.
“I’m sorry.” The woman apologized profusely as Clint stepped in front of Tony with a docked arrow and Natasha had a gun leveled at where her heart should be (the jury was still out on that one).
For the moment he just held her, giving as much comfort as he took, and not allowing his mind to dwell on questions that only time could answer.
“Similar links have been confirmed in the study of human twins, and are not uncommon among domesticated Gata across a wide spectrum.” Bruce added to the debriefing. “However, these bonds lack the depth and strength of what we know of historical Gata-Gata bonds. The data we have collected from the successful bonding of Mr. Stark and Ms. Romanov supports working theory that a full bond will change our cerebral wiring to create a codependent symbiotic system… What we’re calling uh, a marriage of minds.”
"What? When?" Clint was the first to demand looking shocked and slightly hurt, likely that he hadn't been told before now.
"Queen Anthony. I desire an audience with you." Thor all but bellowed as he entered the lab, deftly avoiding stepping on Dummy as the robot let out an excited stream of beeps and rolled off of his charging station, making a beeline for the Asgardian Prince with pinchers open.
“I said that the suit is potentially a weapon of mass destruction that logically should be prevented from falling into the wrong hands.”
Tony and Steve had to duck to avoid the sythe-like blade at the end of the woman’s tail as it whipped over their heads. He couldn’t tell whether the blade was a natural part of her anatomy or a part of the battle suit she wore because the suit molded to her frame so seamlessly it might as well have been painted on.
Clint had suspected because despite being, well Clint, he was a highly-trained spy and he did pay attention when things didn’t add up. Also, he’d pointed out that “nobody’s record is that clean unless it’s faked” and he keeps telling Coulson that, but far be it for SHIELD to listen to him.
“It’s a lot of land but we can make the compound itself defensible.” Agent Coulson moved in the square just on the edge of Tony’s peripheral vision.
He'd offered comfort and support when he didn’t have to. He'd touched Steve when Steve hadn't really been touched in months, not since crashing in ice and waking up almost a century later. Not that he’d been looking for it or anything, it was just something you took for granted when you had it and missed more than you thought you would when it was gone.
“I know my father died with a broken heart Mr. Stark. Not because his daughter was a deviant, but because at the end I think he realized that his grandson was never going to have a real life and that we all helped in our way to make that possible. I don’t know if you know what it’s like to watch your parent die, begging you for forgiveness… making you promise not to lose your child, but Daddy was so afraid that Harley would be hurt one day. I’ve lived with that fear since the moment I decided to keep him and you might think I was a coward, towing to my mother’s line, but I’ve looked outside my window Stark. I know what can happen to Harley and I couldn’t risk losing him. Not for anything.”
"Come on Soldier," Tony squeezed Steve's hand with a gentle smile and tugged him toward the bar. "I'm tapped out. Let's get a drink."
She didn’t come out and say it but he got the message just the same. She hadn’t wanted him to get played again. And suddenly, all her pushing him toward Steve made sense. She’d told him she preferred big sister over meddling granny. He’d not taken her seriously, but he was beginning to think that he should have.
She tugged out of Riri’s grasp, moving across the flight deck even before she’s finished doing the calculations, remembering the man who was her papa but wasn’t explaining to them about how time and space aren’t linear, and how everything exists at once within multiple dimensions.
Tony smiled. He didn’t need T’Challa’s blessing but it was nice somehow still to have it. Tony felt invigorated. Ready.
"Perhaps the AllSpeak has failed to translate you correctly. The Benu is no mere bird. They have the ability to see beyond the folds of time, above and beyond ones self." MiKall explained, a gleam of awe in her eyes. "Their psychic abilities make it hard to hunt them, for they are always warned when you are close and are likely to corrupt your mind in order to kill you with ease."
Killian managed to knock Catman loose by literally punching him into the floor, the cement cracking beneath their feet. He raised himself up with a triumphant smile, muscles bulging and veins glowing with every movement.
“What’s it to you?” The kid scowled with the kind of stepped on pride that answered all of Tony’s questions. The kid looked small and thinner than he should be even from here, but it could be the obscene number of layers he was wrapped in. Like he was preparing to spend a lengthy amount of time in the middle of a falling down shed freezing his ass off.
“Look, I know you guys want to see your parents. But you can’t outrun bullets if you don’t see them coming Tommy and I need you and Kate here.” Nyota sighed, running a hand tiredly through her thick hair.
With Clint she might have risked it, but she didn’t have enough experience with Tony fighting outside of the suit to be certain of what he could and couldn’t handle. She was keenly aware of his vulnerability now, smelling the blood oozing from the lump on his head, eyes flicking between the thick metal restraints leaving bruises against his wrists and the pale glowing light of the arc reactor shining from the center of his bared chest.
"As lost in the fog as you are I imagine." Loki responded calmly as if discussing the weather. "None of it's real you know. The fog is their way of creeping inside your head. You don't notice it until it's too late to do anything about it. Once they are in, your mind does the rest. Rather amazing creatures aren't they?"
"Is a fifth required?" The tom asked, all white toothed grin and Tony huffed, letting his tail swat him as he turned back toward the coffee cup he'd abandoned on a counter. He was going to need the caffeine for this.
Master Osborne was kinda complicated, but he’d loved Peter’s dad. Enough to give him a real job at OSCORP long before anybody else was doing it. Enough to buy Peter’s mother when Peter’s father fell for her, and to allow them to raise Peter without much interference in their own residence.
"That's what you're going with? Not very imaginative but I'll play along. Hi Ty, yes it has been. Not nearly long enough."
"If it's not one King breathing down my neck then it's an Emperor Maria. How do you think Wilhelm or Franz Joseph are going to feel if I start selling to Victor Emanuel? I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror if I climbed into bed with Italy.”
How happy they’d all helped to make each other, he’d realized as his eyes had strayed to Natasha head resting on Tony’s stomach as she appeared to doze, and Pepper with shoes kicked off using Happy’s thigh as a pillow while the bigger man drooled on Coulson’s shoulder. Coulson didn’t seem to mind, happily stroking Clint’s ears, the tom resting in his lap as he bickered sleepily with Tony.
He heard the words leave his mouth, but it was as if from a distance. He didn't know what on earth had possed him to say them, to reject something he so desperately wanted, only that his pulse leapt momentarily and the bitter taste of fear filled his mouth until Steve answered by pulling him flush against his chest. His mouth came down to cover his and put delicious pressure against his whiskers and Tony moaned, leaning into the kiss for everything he was worth, savoring the sweetness and the soft feel of Steve's lips against his.
From the get go, Tony should have realized that it was bound to happen.  Something good didn't happen in his life without kick back. He hadn’t been lying when he’d told the others that he didn’t trust Tiberius Stone. But the attack on the safe house had put them in the unfortunate position of having to rely on the man’s words if not his intentions, because they had absolutely nothing else to go on and all evidence did in fact point to AIM.
His much-improved relationship with Tony showed itself best on the battlefield, where they couldn’t have been more in sync with one another. Steve would never have expected it, but it was the one place where Tony seemed happy to let somebody else take the reins. He was still Tony, he still teased and ran his mouth whenever the mood struck, but Steve could tell now when Tony was just yanking his chain to yank it and when he was truly trying to undermine his control as team leader. He’d seen plenty of that in the beginning and the contrast to now couldn’t have been plainer.
"What do your people say about them Debar? I'm sure there is a lot you can't learn in a history book." Natasha pressed and Tony didn't know what beef she had with the tom but there was definitely beef there.
The blond tom hadn't changed much since the last time Tony'd seen him. He was still stall and fit and gorgeous on the outside, and he still hadn't figured out that no matter how expensive the dye, the black roots on his tail and ears gave the game away. The fur there grew fast and was stubbornly hard to dye. Ty had always been sore about the black patches because the judges at the beauty pageants always preferred uniform colors over stripes, patches, and spots.
He makes Tony get up, tells him to write on the chalkboard 'A nasty tempered Jew, comes to no good', over and over until he is satisfied that the message has sunk in.
“I know.” Darren heaved a wistful sigh and cast Tony a reproachful glance. “And now my life is so dull. Why did we have to get old and settle down? I mean whose idea was it for me to get married?”
Steve had gritted his teeth and tried not to think about what they’d do if one or both of them didn’t pull through this. He didn’t think… he didn’t think he’d be able to pick up their pieces, because he wasn’t sure there would be enough of him left and that was, a hard thing to realize about yourself. They were all being held together with tape and glue, and there was just no coming back after a hit like that.
He looked over at Steve, who actually looked decent despite having been shot through the chest not twenty-four hours ago. The serum had already seen to the minor bruises and injuries he’d sustained taking on Wanda (Bucky’s fel friend with the freaky powers) and Tony’s last anxious peek under the hospital gown had confirmed that the skin over the bullet entry point had already healed over. Hellen worried that he should be awake by now, but Prince T’Challa had assured them again that brief periods of coma were typical among Gata, especially after extreme bond stress.
“With every babe born, every foreigner taken in, you give a beautiful gift and at the same time you take a terrible risk. Sometimes being so close to others makes it all the harder to see their deception. The skilled can hide their motives and learn to exploit the weaknesses you won’t be able to hide. That is why you must have Queensgard and why your mate must be loyal to you and no other. Your Consort is your sword as well as your shield. I do not like to think of you holding a sword that is aimed at you.”
"I always wondered how much of a role the Alurio played in the development of ancient Egypt. The technological boom that occurred in the dynastic period has never been fully explained, but the things they invented and what they built changed the shape of civilization as we know it! I've always thought the Alurio were too close to the pharos not to have played more of a part, but it's not in the history books."
He tried to feel nothing but irritation for the smug bastard, but stupidly he could feel the prickling of every hair on the back of his neck as if someone had stood just behind him and breathed against his skin.
She winked cheekily at Steve with an amused hum, transferring a juicy portion of the steak from her plate to Rumiko’s dish with fork and knife. At formal functions Gata were always served some variant of fish rather than whatever their masters were eating.
He would say he was less himself at the moment because instead of slouching or trying to blend into the background he was standing straight, ears erect as he listened for every sound, arms crossed, and tail straight and stiff behind him as his eyes tracked their visitors with a green glow. Natasha knew that he was scared of this part of himself, and not without good reason, but privately she thought that this was closer to the true Bruce Banner than the stripped down and shackled version that his masters had created.
“You jest! Are you afraid brother? Be not afraid, for when your beast tires and I win the race I will tell no one of your humiliation.”
The now deceptively simple looking metal disk continued its spin until it collided and rebounded off the door to the stairwell, and back into the silver clad kat’s hands.
"Messing around with my hormones can be bad. I should let my heat naturally progress. I know Bruce, we've covered it."
“Your parents were big on adoption weren’t they.” Tony noted, thinking of Thor’s brother who had been taken from the Frost Giant’s for similar purposes.
"Perhaps there's a twelve-year-old kid you've never met." Natasha offered helpfully and Tony shuddered, not just at the horrifying nature of learning he might have a kid he'd never met but because it might mean that there was some poor kit out there in the world suffering god only knew what without the protection of Tony's name. If he was ever crazy or selfish enough to actually have a kit he could at least grant them that. They'd be his children. Never pets.
“How many? Well, get me a tally. Find out who they are and what they want. We’ll need to blockade the area, nobody in or out without my say so. Including the press.” Phil said, tossing the pants that Clint had abandoned at the foot of the bed over his head and Clint smirked (Phil was tidy and sometimes his hints weren’t subtle) hurrying to get dressed even as he heard Phil warn Hill over the phone, “Watch out for Christine, she’s slippery.”
Tony’s pretty shot, physically as well as emotionally, when a couple of medics rush up and try and get him to let go of Steve.
So yeah, not a lot of time for heart to hearts with Cap, even though he'd been meaning to after that bit of embarrassment with Harley (because ouch) and even Tony recognized that some form of check-in was in order after an incident like that. You know, just to make sure the kid's data was wrong. Because if Steve was suffering some form of post trauma fueled depression, it was the decent thing to inquire, and if Tony didn't it was going to come down on his head.
“And he’s got no idea how to get that thing open?” Steve asked, sounding skeptical. The disk was completely smooth on all sides, the thin circles where its spokes presumably protruded were so seamless they were barely discernable on the edges. There were no buttons screws or hatches to present any clues on how to get it open to examine its inner workings and since it was indeed made with vibranium all attempts to crack it open had failed miserably.
Stark men might be made of iron but Tony Stark at nine years old appears to be the anomaly, the black sheep, because he's made of noise: music and giggles, silly questions and even sillier dreams. He's sweet natured and quick to give.
“I see mother!” he whispers excitedly, pointing, and her ears twitch toward them. The scowl her mouth slips into when she finally sees them makes him shrink back against his father’s chest.
“Because it is and that would be awesome.” Tony replied with a shrug, not quite seeing what her point was.
It wasn’t exactly a great feeling, but he respected her enough to give the idea proper consideration. She was right about one thing, he'd gone into this knowing how a Pride worked. He couldn't very well kick up a fuss because he didn't like it now.
"You crafted this?" RaTu asked, blinking slowly as her yellow eyes took in the scratched but otherwise intact plates as Tony lowered his defensive stance.
Smile positively sunny now he reached for the chest, only for Thor to suddenly appear between them to still his hand. The thunder god was wearing a very stern expression as he plucked the little gold chest from the she-tom’s hands, the object looking even smaller in his large hands as he frowned down at the woman.
“It is not your cologne. Rather what your cologne can not hide. Captain Rogers feels possessive towards you. He’s left his mark on you rather potently.”
It was kind of weird finding his friends all sitting in the living room on the common floor like a bunch of fretful parents on prom night but alright, kind of endearing as well. But Tony, being Tony couldn’t let it go without at least a little teasing.
He didn’t know what to expect when he stepped into the shower behind Steve. All of his plans fell away at his first sight of Steve standing beneath the spray, naked back glistening as water and suds sluiced over his shoulders and down the curve of his spine. Tony must have made some sort of sound because then Steve turns, and at first all Tony can do is take in the way the muscles bunch as he twists, but then he drags his gaze up to meet Steve’s and his eyes are the darkest blue Tony has ever seen them.
Tony tensed when he felt finely boned fingers slide into his hair, rubbing at his skull, but he relaxed as Natasha's scent washed over him and he felt the familiar tingling in the back of his skull.
Sam was nodding and Steve noted with amusement that his back had straightened unconsciously, his voice strong and filled with pride as he answered.
Enough jangling to announce Saint Nick's arrival in a reindeer led sleigh, announced DUMMY's presence as he zoomed across the room to collect the tom’s winter gear. He and YOU had been brought up to help with the party and were taking their hosting duties very seriously. Harley had strapped bells to DUMMY's sides so that he jingled with every movement and YOU, who was dropping food onto plates over at the food station, was sporting a big bright red Christmas bow.
Technically Anna and the others didn't need them since they'd be at the safehouse "abandoned" but Nyota wanted them to be traceable if something were to go wrong. T'Cael had come up with the idea of turning their collars into communicators and Nyota could have kissed him. Sometimes it paid to have a kid brother who was a genius.
