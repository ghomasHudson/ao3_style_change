Even from his seat a couple steps away Cas can see Dean’s eyes going cold. “Fine. Do what you want, bitch.” He leaves the room and Sam calls a weak “Jerk” after him, but Dean doesn’t answer.
Sam grins. “Nope, I didn’t watch anything.” He’s quiet for a moment, then looks at Cas. “You wanna join?”, he asks, but Castiel can tell the brothers want to spend some time together.
Dean closes his eyes. “I forgot that you wouldn’t know that putting pictures in your wallet is a thing.” He takes a deep breath before looking at Cas again. “That’s what you do, you know? When someone… means a lot to you. You put their picture in your wallet so you can see their faces when you open it.”
Dean spends Christmas Eve in the kitchen. He doesn’t let Sam or Cas in the room, let alone help. “This man is a nightmare,”, Sam whispers in Cas’ ear when Dean throws him out after he tried to get some coffee. “But sadly he can cook, so I can’t really say something about it, right?” He shrugs. “You know what, I’ll go get some breakfast for us, okay? Cause I’m really hungry!” He shouts the last part in Dean’s direction.
“I just think this ending is really mean to Mark. He loves her but at the same time, this kiss is the only thing he’ll ever get from her.” He thinks it wouldn’t be wise to mention the fact that he relates to Mark a lot. The two seem like a bad metaphor for Dean and himself and he is relieved but also surprised that Dean didn’t catch it.
Dean sighs. “Really Sam? A romcom?” Sam shrugs. “I like it. And it’s a classic Christmas movie as well. Cas should see it.”
Dean sighs. “Dude, we finished the movie like 10 minutes ago. Why are you so obsessed with that?” He’s speaking quietly since Sam is sleeping next to them in the armchair, the laptop dark on the table in front of them.
He takes the plate from Dean and eats a little. When Sam and Dean are finished  and he isn’t, he takes his leftovers with him so they can start the movie. When they reach the couch, Dean flops down immediately, but Sam frowns. “What’s that under the tree?”, he asks.
He runs a hand down his face, then stretches with his eyes closed and stands up. “I’m hungry. Thought about checking out that new burger joint on the road to town, you wanna come?” His eyes flicker to Cas while he stacks all his papers and closes the book.
He finds him in front of the different Christmas lights. “There you are. Sorry for snapping at you. Just wanted to get on with the shopping. Look, aren’t those lights amazing? And even better than snow globes?” Dean gestures to the lights on display and Cas nods. “Of course they are, Dean.” He secretly thinks the snow globes are better than the lights, but maybe that’s just some ‘weird angelic thing’ as Dean put it.
He was shocked when the guy growled at him with his vampire fangs out. “Be more careful next time you wonder around. Next time I won’t be so nice.” He shoved Cian back.
“Because that always works out Sam. Remember the last time we went to camp cuckoo land? You lived a thousand Tuesdays while I died differently in every one.” Dean sarcastically remarked.
He kissed Crowley’s fiery, red head and went to make a cup of tea. He made sure not to disturb the demon or there would be hell to pay. He didn’t like being woken up by anything other than his body clock.
Aziraphale looked at him with a scole. “Now you see here, I will do no such thing. I only desire your company. What is odd about that? It was only a week ago we stopped Adam from trying to sneak off on his adventure with dog to Australia in a homemade go-kart.”
Sam shrugged his shoulders. “See what tonight brings, if we get nowhere maybe get him to put feelers out. If we get a hit then no.” He looked squinted at Cian. “You fancy him or something?”
“So you do live, is there anything you can’t do? If the taller ones weren’t enough trouble, I now have to deal with you twins being invincible.” Crowley said so matter of factly. “What do you want, Moose?”
Dean looked at her with a sigh. “I’ll swap with Sam as I hate research, especially overnight reading.”
As the family sat around the grand table drinking beer and eating burgers and pie, Cas walked into the bunker. Sacha just laughed because of what she said earlier to Dean, while he just glared at her and told her to shut up.
“No because my 29 year old childish ass wants Lucky Charms. Should have gotten up earlier like I did, if you want peace go back to your room.” He snarked back before crunching loudly on his cereal.
“There is nothing wrong with my jacket. How dare you? Besides, it is 150 years old and still immaculate.” The angel cried.
The morning routine was over and they could finally start getting down to business at 11am, it was a long morning but they all got up late. It’s Monday who cared. They were always the hardest in Dean’s books for some reason, they never really had a day off in their line of work.
A little bit of fluff in this one but in a couple of chapters it will live up to the explicit name I promise.
“Right then let's get down to business shall we? Well after we have eaten and stuff.” Sacha threw her napkin at Dean silently telling him he’s forgiven and to stop pouting as she loves him. “Oh Dean I made cherry pie last night that I’ve hidden somewhere in the bunker. If you find it before we leave for the stake out you get to eat the WHOLE thing,”
The angel huffed in annoyance at how he always knew. “He wanted me to go back to Heaven to fulfill a duty that only
The twins finished their drinks too then they were all heading to the cars. Cian drove back in the Ford while Dean got behind the wheel of his beloved Baby. Dean sadly got the love birds.
Once they had finished their drinks Aziraphale got ready to open the book shop while Crowley had a shower to get clean.
“They always do this. If I throw the towel in it gives ‘em the win, they know I have a short fuse sometimes. Gets me mad …. HA! All that farting about for nothing, dickhead. Still won in one move with your Snorlax. Nob. What you get when you giantamax your Poké too early.” She pressed a few more buttons and then turned the game off. “Blocked you dick, piss take.” She looked at Dean. “What?”
He knocked again, this time there was a loud thud. He wasn't sure what was going on and he didn't know if he should open her door. After a few minutes he opened the door to see that she had fallen out of but drifted off to sleep again.
The bell for last orders rang out and the group they were watching, well Cian and Dean were watching since their sister was having fun with Jack, left the pub via the back exit. Cian followed them pretending to go to the toilet drunk.
Dean looked at her and followed her point. Bingo. Sacha took her camera and took pictures of the two fellas, hoping Sam and Cian can do something with their faces.
She was just bundled in her duvet but her bottom was sticking up in the air while her face was flat on the floor.
He got to the kitchen and got his favourite machine in the bunker working, giving off the best smell in the world. Brewing coffee.
“We are pretty much capable of dealing with a growing nest of vamps, but their feeding habits and how they are recruiting is weird. At first we thought it was The Men of Letters doing when we found one of their old cases. But I went undercover, and well, they drugged me higher than a kite. We think the way they are turning more over a few days it must be big. We need any help we can get.” Sacha gave him a short briefing.
“Shouldn’t you be out doing your thing? Or do you want to watch it too?” She asked. With that mild threat Crowley was gone.
“Yeah, see those guys over there?” He points with his eyes to the group of three behind them. “They have been here the entire time we have and had the same drink. No refill, not even one sip. Jack tried to use his magic mojo but he’s only managed to get this from them.” He handed Sacha and Dean his notes that Jack had written down.
“Think the guys Cas spoke to were actually being used by the vamps to spy on us?” Sacha asked looking up from her yellow Nintendo Switch for a moment before going back to her Pokémon battle with an online friend.
It had been four and half hours later, and Dean finding the pie in Sacha’s room, they were all ready to get the night over with. Cian had taken Jack with him since he was a little upset Sacha didn’t give him a job. Sacha said it was to keep him out of trouble, but Jack never got into trouble.
ANYWAY I hope you guys have had a good year and thank you for sticking with my story! I wish you a Happy Christmas and New Year and hopefully the new year will let me get this story back to maybe once every fortnight. We will see!
Hope you are all well and safe. Thank you for your continued support in reading my fic. Hope you enjoy this chapter and more soon I hope.
Dean and Cian kept talking about the case and how it should go from here. Sacha put her opinion in and then went back to loving Jack. Cian found it gross but Dean liked seeing his sister loving someone openly.
“I shall put these in the kitchen, then I will brief you on a case I think I may have got us while I was getting these ‘veggies’” He announced before heading to the kitchen.
Dean looked and smirked. “Sneaky bastards. Alright you got your pictures so let’s go.” Once they had run off he started the engine to get to the pub.
It was noon and Crowley always visited the angel at work so he could deliver him a special blend of tea that the demon grows himself. The angel loves it, Crowley made him try it with a blindfold on so he could only taste the tea. It also was so he couldn't see that it was the same shade of red as the demon's hair.
The night before Crowley had insisted on showing him the Star Wars movies from 1977 onward, he skipped the newer ones as they were ‘just movies for the sake of money. Nobody enjoyed them, they felt the
"Oh come on Samantha bet you was thinking it too." Sacha teased him, he hated being called that name. She was the only one that called him that and got away with it.
“Alright, I will see if anything is going off in Hell and outside. I’ll also ask around the Alphas if I can get in touch with them.” Crowley finally answered. “Is it as big as you think?”
It was half an hour into the drive back home and Dean could hear snoring. He looked in the rearview mirror to see the angel and half the twins asleep in the back. He smiled at himself at the sight of the site of the couple sleeping in each other.
was just playing my game for a little bit.” She looked at her watch. “It’s 1:35am and how have w~” She then saw movement so she nudged Dean.
“Well why not have me and SAM to watch any activity around the building, while Cian stays in the shops and pubs to try and get chatting to the locals. You and Cas could try other channels or read through the experiments in more detail. Or you can swap with Sam if you want and spend the night with me in a car that AIN’T Baby.” Sacha said with confidence, ignoring what Dean said interrupting her the first time.
“As you have heard from the key witness, Hastur was planning on betraying us for those heathens. My prince, is there anything else you need to hear?” The demon asked.
It was a cold spring morning, Crowley was still asleep but Aziraphale just laid next to the demon. Just cuddling him and watching him sleep. He doesn’t make a noise.
About 40 minutes into their search Cas walks into the bunker. He held in his hand a bag of vegetables that Sam asked him to collect once he was done doing whatever it was he was doing.
“We have always known about him and Aziraphale, ever since the garden, so don’t bring them into it. He also didn’t plan on stealing something for said angel, they are in love and have been for about six thousand years. That is
Meg was crazy and affectionate. But that's not why Cas loved Meg. She burned bright like a star, yet somehow she’d decided she wanted Cas in her orbit. He couldn’t fully understand it. She was an enigma. Like Dean.
He hung up the phone, grabbed a cup of coffee and the remainder of his med school applications and went out on the back deck to get some fresh air and sun. The house was quiet. Hannah’s ex-husband was in town visiting his parents. She’d taken the kids there for a sleepover.
Dean shrugged, “What’s the point? Even if you got someone in charge who wanted to change things most of Congress wouldn’t let them.”
“Yeah...don’t worry about it Cas. You deserve to enjoy a night out with friends. I’m just sorry if I upset you.”
It’d been a long time since Dean waited tables. He thought about Cas having to break his ass, being sweet and kind and accommodating, saying ‘yes sir,’ ‘very good sir,’ to all the assholes stuck in the middle of the corporate ladder. Dean remembered his own experience waiting tables in the business district - how so many of those guys were desperate to climb without a fucking clue about how to show leadership, - abusive and condescending to servers in order to feel important and authoritative in front of their clients or colleagues.
Cas’s other hand found Dean’s nipple, hardened from the chill of the car’s interior and circled gently with the pad of his finger, sending a jolt of sensations straight to his cock. Dean loved having his nipples played with. Cas knew it...remembered, and looked at Dean with smoke-laden eyes, as Dean moaned softly, his toes curling inside his boots.
It wasn’t any easier at breakfast. It was worse. Cas was up, drinking coffee and sitting, knees up on a chair near the window quietly looking out at the day. He smiled at Balthazar as he sat down across from him. Cas noticed the look of trepidation.
“Okay,” Sam sighed, putting his hands up to de-escalate the sudden tension. “Okay….Dean, why were you in that bar in the first place?” he asked more gently. “I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen you drunk, let alone smashed.”

Cas was a far cry from the adorably awkward teenager he’d seen across the room at the Delta party, who looked like he had no idea what to do with his hands, and was always a half-second off the beat. Nor was Cas like one of those ridiculous attention-seeking types strutting the latest disco moves in the center of the dance floor. Cas moved simply and confidently like the music was part of him, or maybe
Cas shook the globe and set it down, watching the snow-colored glitter as it scattered and floated around the rotunda. He reached up to the cabinet about the refrigerator grabbing the bottle of tequila Gabriel left after visiting one night and poured a shot, downing it quickly to calm his nerves, then indulged in another. He brought the snow globe into his room and placed it on his bedside table to remind him of that night with Dean.
A blare of sirens caused everyone to look out the windows as another ambulance made its way into the yard. The staff busied itself in anticipation of whatever came next.  Three paramedics burst in with a stretcher meeting doctors who immediately rolled a man on a gurney down the hallway and out of view of the waiting room. Another man tried to follow but was held back by the nursing staff.
Cas got up and turned off the television, then knelt by the crate of albums. Flipping through them, he was struck by how many he felt the need to avoid because they had history. He continued to root through them trying to find something that hadn’t been twisted or tainted by their past. He still didn’t know for certain why Dean had landed himself here. They had never gotten to it before Dean’s fever raged, and Cas was still trying to guard himself with the somewhat fresh memory of Dean storming from this very apartment after concluding that they couldn’t be “together”.
Still blinking he looked around unsure of his surroundings. A snore from across the room drew his attention to a sleeping form sprawled on a loveseat.
They promised it to each other, whispered ‘forever’ between stolen kisses during the day and when they desperately clung to each other in the night, bodies tangled in sweat and languid from their lovemaking. It was as real and valid as anyone else’s union, and Dean had wanted to take Cas everywhere and hold his hand and shout to the world that this was
Once inside Dean stood looking around as if unsure what to do next. He looked utterly exhausted...could barely bring himself to look at Cas.
“Uh..yeah..” His hand sought out the space above his right temple where a throbbing pain made him want to close his eyes again and hunker down under the covers.
“Oh…okay….” Cas was thankful that Dean couldn’t see him, certain that the ongoing anxiety he felt must be written all over his face.
“Are you hungry? You should eat something.” Balthazar asked as they parked the car. “You didn’t touch the food they brought you. I can make you breakfast.”
When the US Government and the State of California deemed Dean Winchester sufficiently “cured” and his treatment benefits ended, Rufus went the extra mile to make sure the young man wouldn’t fall through the cracks. He put Dean in touch with a veterans group in Oregon where he was moving and he gave Dean his personal number. Rufus made some of his free time available to check in with young men and women he thought would need additional support.
Dean, working to control himself, and not wanting the restraints to be used again put his hands up in surrender. A look of exhausted despair crossed his face as he dropped his eyes. Dean swallowed back a lump in his throat and closed his eyes to keep the water forming there from betraying him further.
He had just pulled on warm, clean socks when the phone rang again. Dean went into the living room to answer it and made it this time.
Cas noticed his brother was nowhere in sight and the older man continued to steal curious glances his way.
Balthazar let out a mirthless chuckle, “Because it’s always been you. You’ve always been the spanner in the works.” He sounded drunk.
Heart gave way to Deep Purple and Bad Company. Highway interchanges faded into the distance in favor of county routes and byways as the city transformed into suburbs surrounding Cas’s home. Dean stopped once for gas, and a quick smoke break away from Baby to steel his nerves before turning down the final few streets.
“Lisa? Naw,” Dean shook his head. “She and I were just friends at that point. She’s the one who pointed him out to me.”
Before he realized what he was doing his fist smashed into the glass of the mirror, shards falling away from the frame into the sink.
Cas suddenly realized what had happened as the adults in the distance lit another M80 along with a string of firecrackers and cherry bombs, kids yelling, jumping and screaming in delight, oblivious to the effect this was having on the strangers across the field.
The man caught Cas’s shocked eyes from the mirror, smiling, knowing Cas understood the code. “You don’t think it’s his kind of thing do you - your date?” he chuckled, looking surprised. “Believe me honey, I know it when I see it and that guy’s practically begging for someone to take control.”
One meeting in late July, three months after Dean started, he felt so goddam weighed down that he had to break free of it. The turn to share came round to Dean.
Cas straightened as he recovered himself. Dean watched the walls go back up in his eyes, the facade of calm return.
Dean edged up on the couch enough to see Castiel in the kitchen putting away bread and juice and pulling out a large glass jar that held what looked like soup.
Dean looked quickly away. When Dean didn’t move or respond Cas dropped his hand, struggling for what to say next.
They had been passing through San Francisco to meet Bobby’s cousin about buying out the rest of his share of the garage when Bobby started seeing flashing lights and lines, a searing pain causing him to wince and grab his head. A headache had been building all morning but this was something more.
I want you to be free to find what you need in life, even if it’s not me. I want more than anything for you to be happy. You deserve to be happy Dean. Whatever it takes to make that happen, I will be okay with that. I wish that for you.
A few hours later Dean woke in Cas’s arms. The angel lay still...sleeping. Dean had a hazy memory of climbing under the covers as he woke from a nightmare and a chill took him during the night. A hazy memory of sliding up close to Cas to share his warmth. Of pressing a gentle kiss to Cas’s forehead and of the angel reaching his arms around to pull him in closer. It was the safest Dean had felt in perhaps forever, and Dean gave in to oblivion and slept.
Dean huffed a derisive laugh, not really sure he wanted to know what that meant. Not that it mattered. Soon nothing would. Dean gazed out the window.
to burn - already, set ablaze by the way Dean darted his tongue over full fleshy lips as he made his way closer.
To be fair, it wasn’t entirely Dean’s fault. Even though he’d seen Cas a few times since July, in his absence he still found himself picturing Cas as he was when they were a couple more than five years ago. When he met Cas at Cafe Luna he’d been prepared to see a boy, the memory of Cas’s sweet twink body, fit but edged with the look of slight privation to his frame, typical of college students and young couples relying on noodles, peanut butter and cheap cold cuts to sustain them. That was the life they had. Dean thought at the time it had been a really good life for them both. They may have been struggling a little, but they were happy.
“Slimy nasty pumpkin guts….smelled like shit.” but Dean was smiling at the memory. “We never really had a Halloween growing up. Dad always turned the lights out or went out drinking. Never had the money for candy but one year I helped Sammy dress like a bum and brought him around with an old pillowcase for candy.”
For his own part, Cas was unsure what to do. This was the first time he stood face to face with Dean in heaven. Though he would never take it back, he was not entirely sure the declaration he had made to Dean at their last meeting was entirely welcome.
Dean burst out the door of the club and rounded the corner near the parking lot, leaning back against the building drawing breaths of fresh air into his tightening chest.
Too late. As he glanced back he saw Castiel and Balthazar entering the club. His pulse quickened. This was happening, like it or not. Seeing their table, Cas grabbed Balthazar’s hand to lead him over as Sam waved.
Cas let out a breath and slumped back in relief, but only for a second before he sprang back into action searching for his shoes and keys. Charlie helped him locate both.
Dean struggled to understand, it didn't make any sense. “...God Cas, I’m so sorry…..why didn’t you tell me?”
“Hey Cas, it’s me,” Dean said. He started coughing, getting it under control a few seconds later. “I guess I probably shouldn’t have left your place tonight.
“Careful Jess - I’m filthy.” She adjusted herself to Dean’s left, side to avoid getting motor oil on her clothes, but squeezed tight just the same. Cas stood back, with a tentative, but warm smile that softened his eyes.
They had it planned so that Cas drove to Dean’s place in Sacramento since he got off earlier than Dean and it would give them more time for their date. As soon as Cas pulled into the parking lot Dean was there, sitting on Baby’s hood waiting for him, and ready to take the reins.
Dean, eyes still closed, limbs shaking if not for the tight grip he had over Cas, kissed hard at Cas's shoulder, breathing a stuttered "
Dean’s lips first touched Cas’s in a chaste kiss, and then returned for a second more lingering one...Cas’s lips, soft and full, opened slightly in an invitation that Dean accepted, his tongue gently, lovingly seeking Castiel’s until Castiel deepened and opened to him fully. In that moment Dean was lost. Castiel’s hands moved more rapidly now, searching, testing, enjoying the feel of Dean’s body, relishing the sensations of muscle and bone beneath his fingers. Dean’s hands moved to pull at Cas’s shirt, needing to feel Cas’s skin. As their breath quickened, hearts beating beyond measure Cas stopped and pulled away to look at Dean, breathless, a smile on his lips, his eyes filled with longing.
When Cas brought out the drinks and salad plates Michael was pitching some project for which he seemed to be seeking investment when the older man’s eyes narrowed on Cas.
“I have to get back. Gotta go to work tomorrow,” his face ashen, his teeth chattering now as he said it.
Cas cleared his throat. He was desperate to change the subject. “So...you play guitar now and sing…. on stage...with an
Sam came back from the store with beer and soda, greeting Dean and heading straight for the radio as he came in complaining that the Angels were already blowing a 3 run lead. Sam dropped the groceries on the table and found the game on the station.
He set the alarm on his watch, laying it on the coffee table, not trusting himself to wake at any decent hour after the gauntlet he’d just run his body through. Finally, he closed his eyes, exhausted, determined not to let himself think anymore, and drifted into a restless sleep.
Next week's chapter will be a longer one but I have to confess I'm a little nervous about keeping up the posts to once a week now that school is starting again. I will try my best!!!
Dean nodded. Mildred closed the book around the ribbon, handing it to Dean. “You can take this for your brother if you think it will help. I have that verse pretty much memorized.” She winked.
“You don’t think I’ve done that Sam?” he rounded on him. “You don’t think I could be with someone else right now if I wanted to? I’ve been on dates with people since Cas, Sam.” Dean didn’t think Sammy needed to know that they always ended the same way, with Dean backing away or ending the night early, so uncharacteristic of his old self.
Cas had been so unsettled at Dean’s sudden and unannounced arrival. He had somehow drifted into memory while Tommy took Jenny to the woman’s doorstep, leaving Cas by the curb to wait.
The second session, he’d been in the chair a mere five minutes before Pamela started asking Dean who had been there for him for support besides his father when he was a child and during his teen years.
...but Cas had another order to bring out and the chef was shouting at him to bring out the next tray to an adjacent table.
Dean jumped off the tiny stage and returned to the table where the smiling waitress congratulated them and brought fresh drinks. Jess kissed his cheek, Sammy and Benny slapped him on the back and Cas grabbed his shoulder, squeezing with his fingers.
“This whole car smells like you….or you smell like it,” Cas said, his eyes suddenly traveling from Dean to the seat beside him as he turned to take in more of Baby. “Like musk, and spices and leather. Jesus, it's…” Cas’s voice fell off, his eyes, closing as he inhaled.
Cas shivered as he allowed Dean to shift him this way and that until Dean could pull the covers over him. Dean sat on the edge of the bed and briskly rubbed up and down Cas’s arms and back to warm him. After a few minutes, the shuddering breaths stopped and Cas settled once again into a regular breathing pattern. Dean felt Cas’s forehead again. It was less clammy. His skin returning some warmth and Dean ran his fingers back gently to smooth away Cas’s sweat-soaked hair.
A waitress came to their table and took a drink order. Dean ordered Jack and Coke and Cas a Pina Colada. When their drinks arrived, he nearly downed the whiskey like a shot. Cas sipped his drink as they made small talk about the venue, taking in the crowd. There were several same-sex couples with a few hetero couples sprinkled about amongst a sea of what seemed to be singles. No one seemed to care who was with whom or to be bothering anyone.
“Christ Cas! Is that what you call it? ‘Saying goodbye?’ You were practically purring in his lap. I thought the next act would be you bending over the table for us all to watch you beg for his cock!”
Cas closed the apartment door behind him and ran his hands through his hair. His adrenaline was pumping and he didn’t know how he was going to come back down.
Seventy-two hours. Dean lashed out in anger at the small adjustable table adjacent to his bed and it flew across the floor. Rufus rose to his feet looking sternly at Dean like he would restrain Dean himself if need be.
It was almost six and everyone else had gone home for the day when Dean opened up the hood of a station wagon with transmission problems.
Cas hugged Balthazar before turning in, laying a kiss on his temple. He really was grateful for their friendship. But it was time for Cas to step out on his own and they both knew it.
They both ran down their schedules in their heads. This week would be near impossible. The one night Cas had free Dean had scheduled an appointment with Pamela Barnes, the psychologist Rufus recommended. Without a doubt he wanted to break it in favor of meeting up with Cas, but the fear of what happened in the park happening again made him keep it...if it meant he’d be better for Cas, he’d do it...he’d do anything.
It was a small seed in a barren landscape. One that maybe Cas didn’t even know he’ d planted - but if he could, Dean would water it and nurture it and encourage it to grow into a flower so beautiful and full that Cas would lose himself in its beauty and forget all about the cracked and desolate soil of their past.
Rufus didn’t want to patronize Dean by denying his version of events, but he was certain that if Dean
“I’m pretty sure you were never a scout Dean,” Cas laughed, “but you’ve always been honorable so I’ll accept that.”
“Or, if you want you can use my room, to get some rest” Cas continued, “I have some things I can do out here, or you can take the couch and I’ll give you some space and quiet.”
Dean was getting chilly, less now from constant shivers, though a light fever was still on him. More from the fact that it was now November and Cas’s apartment, for all of its hominess, was a little drafty. He got himself up to go ask Cas if he might have a light blanket he could use.
“I mean...I know you’re with Balthazar. He’s probably a great guy. Just, you know, if you wanted to just say hi. Sam, Jess and I and you and Balthazar…..anyway. I don’t want to make you feel weird.”
The first three numbers he dialed yielded the same response. “I’m sorry, You have the wrong number.”
“Yeah…” Cas smiled, his eyes unguarded now. Cas leaned in again, bringing their noses together, then caressing Dean’s lips with his own again. “More than okay,” he said, breaking away again and smiling. “Let’s go.”
Holy shit! What was happening? This couldn’t be his Cas. Dean’s hands began forming into tight fists as he willed himself to listen when every part of him was screaming to throw this Balthazar up against a wall and demand to know what the fuck had happened. What the fuck did he do to Cas!”
She smiled gently, though the exhaustion showed on her face. “I just wanted to make sure you got settled in okay dear.”
He took a step towards Dean. Cas had always been the careful one, the nervous one, but losing everything changes your perspective.
Cas cleared his throat and pretended to read again, looking unseeing at the scramble of words on the page. He stole a glance at Dean. He lay still, his eyes closed, lips pressed together. Cas, saw him pull at the corners of his eyes with his fingers. Cas thought he should just get up and change the song. Instead he closed his own eyes letting it play, facing the emotion - letting it all wash over him - maybe then the sadness could finally ebb out to sea.
“If you insist on being an ass, then at least you can lay down before you fall down, or neither of us will get any rest. I made room.”
“Oh!” Cas laughed, “You mean like maybe they can just ride up on their motorcycle and offer a guy a ride, then bring him to a diner and
Rufus sighed, “Dean. You and I both know there’s only one way you’ll ever know for sure. I want you to think on that...Whatever you decide, you keep this number Dean. You call me anytime, understand? Sacramento’s not that far. I can be there in no time if you wanna go get a coffee. In the mean time, I got someone near you I want you to give a call to. I think it would be good to help you get some perspective.”
Dean thought back to the brief tinge of despair he’d felt on that otherwise perfect day as he looked out at Cas through the lens of the camera. Cas was beautiful and happy and Dean’s heart was full, and yet a shadow of foreboding flickered in him like everything was about to be lost.
“As bad as I'm feeling now...what if I never find what I’m looking for...what if it never gets any better? I don’t know,” he said, shaking his head. “I told you it's stupid.”
”I don’t know,” he said honestly. “What I hoped for at the beginning...what I hoped for in the middle, or at the end…” Dean shrugged his shoulders, “They’re all different.”
“When you’re not good for anything else, that's how you end up. You end up a whore. And that one's just trying to weasel her way into a better life.”
“Okay...no,” Cas’s response broke through Dean’s thoughts. “I ...I just wanted to make sure you’re okay tonight.”
“I don’t know,” Cas lied, as they continued to walk through the gardens. “Whatever happens to be going on in my life that day I guess.”
‘Dean,” his voice sounded weak and cracked but he smiled. “You shouldn’t have come all this way, for me.”
he believe there was subtext? His throat went dry. How was it that he now found himself unable to rely on his own basic language skills when he talked to Dean?
Taking several deep breaths, Dean tried to shift his focus to the positive news about Fred. He thought about getting things all settled for them here and then bringing Cas - introducing him to everyone he loved here in Valens.
Bess would come over to see what could be frozen out of the things that were already prepared and Garth and Dean would spend the day fitting the house with whatever adjustments Fred would need so that Mildred didn’t have to worry about that. They planned to spend the next day setting up a first floor bedroom downstairs in Fred’s study, building ramps where they would be necessary, and making sure that the kitchen was stocked with easy to prepare food. Having settled on the plans, Garth said goodnight and made his way home.
The last thing Dean wanted was for Benny or anyone else to throw him a pity party so of course he answered with a generic…
Balthazar had given Cas an anthology of poetry once in some misguided attempt at acculturating him to a world of assonance and metaphor. Taking only the required liberal arts courses at school, Cas never had a head for the stuff. He’d tried because Balthazar seemed to think it was important, but of all the hundreds of pages only
Cas laughed exhaling in relief, “Shit! No Dean!” Cas smiled, both hands going to hold Dean’s, he looked down at their hands, his eyes hungry as they met Dean’s again. “Forgive me if I don’t want to share you with anyone.”
“It’s no trouble,” Cas said bunching up the used sheets and tossing them in the laundry bag that was already perched near the door. “Do you have any other clothes with you?
“This is stupid Sammy.” Dean closed his eyes, shaking his head. “I don’t think I can do this. I’m not here to fuck up Cas’s life with what’s his name. This was a mistake.” Dean said, looking for the exit.
Before they knew it Cas and Dean were back at the auto shop. Dean realized he had no memory of even getting off the cable car or making any of the turns. He had been so focused on the conversation.
Sam opened the door a crack and seeing that Dean was awake, rubbed his forehead. “You have any aspirin?”
Cas was getting better at filling the void that had been ‘Dean’ with things that were important, things he wanted for himself - applying for school, repairing his relationships with family and friends. He was more content than he’d been in a long time...not always, but enough.
Thank you to those of you who have commented and left kudos. They are little rays of sunshine! I'm still trying for Saturday updates but subscribing is safest if you want to be sure to know when I've posted. There is still quite a bit more to their story in this universe! 🥰
“All right.” He looked up, “I’m sorry Cas. I won’t bring it up. Just….he’s not here is he? I can see how disappointed you are. It’s written all over your face.”
Cas took a moment to respond. “.....I did Dean,” he said softly, remembering, “You weren’t listening.”
“How do you always seem to know the words to every song?” Dean took his hand again now that it rested on the table.
“Well I know we already talked about you having a crazy schedule next week, and I gotta do a few runs out of town for Bobby, but Thanksgiving here is pretty much off for now. Garth and the family are planning on putting one on for Fred next weekend. Can you get off?”
Cas's face was resolute, as he nodded. “You know you shouldn’t be riding home but fine.” Cas wavered, “Go home, get better...and then
The windows of the Impala were completely fogged up but outside the rain had stopped, removing some of their cover, and a sliver of sunlight beckoned through the otherwise dark sky.
Dean awoke some hours later to the unpleasant sound of blinds being drawn and light shining in through the hospital room window. His head was full of fog. He couldn’t move his arms. He remembered the straps.
“Told you..feels gross and smells worse. But I know you love it," Dean shrugged, looking down, "Or used to anyway... Hey," He looked up at Cas smiling again, "if you want you can carve a big ass goofy grin into one to remind you of me.”
“Listen, I can’t talk long but it's been on my mind - What are your plans for Thanksgiving? I want us to be together.”
With one last look up at Cas’s window he mounted his bike, started the engine, and even though he should
It seemed they both might have some free time on Friday during the day to meet up if they met halfway and Dean was able to shift some of his work hours and finish up Saturday morning. Dean felt like they were stealing time together.
“It's not so much that...I can make rent and expenses, but I need to put as much as I can away for when I start school again. Pre-med was challenging but everyone I talked to said it's near impossible to work and maintain your studies at the same time in Med school. I want to start up in the spring term somewhere if I can.”  Cas looked away, forgetting about the fork in his hand, bringing it back down to the plate as if deep in thought.
That changed once he met Cas. Dean was still Dean, but he loved someone now. For the first time in his life he really felt it. Not just lust, but love for someone who could actually be hurt by the judgments or retributions of others. So Dean learned to “be polite” for Cas. To at least acknowledge if not play by the rules of society. To be protective, even if his disorderly and rebellious nature was only barely held in check.
Dean laughed despite his messy teary face, chiding her “That's not what I meant, Mildred and you know it.”
Dean covered his head with a pillow and waited for the phone to stop. He tried in vain for about twenty minutes to drift back before finally opting to get up and make some coffee.
Jess joined in again and as their voices danced against each other until finally blending into the final verse
Cas nodded obediently and followed Balthazar up the stairs. Cas showered, threw on pajamas and sat down on the couch. Balthazar cooked bacon, eggs, and toast for them both. Cas nibbled mostly on the toast.
There was no way Dean was going to talk about it now. Yeah, he knew people were there for him but he was goddamn sick of people treating him like he was made of glass and might shatter at any second. Maybe he would, maybe he wouldn’t. All Dean knew was it wouldn’t help to hear himself bitch about it. At this point it only made him feel worse. If he
Balthazar saved Cas from being alone, but not from loneliness. The hole that Dean left was like the essential piece of a puzzle. Balthazar tried to fit, but he would never be Dean, and without that missing piece, Cas wondered if he’d ever be whole.
Instead now he was hours away and as of his last try unable to reach him. All through the drive concern for Fred’s health and Mildred’s well being warred with Dean’s concern that once again he was going to be disappointing Cas. All he could do was keep trying to reach him and hope Cas would understand.
“Yes…..I’ve been working on it this whole time. Believe me, it was a lot worse in the barn. It’s just that the spell really weakened me…...It’s healing Dean,” he met Dean’s eyes to assure him.
“You know, I don’t think I’ve seen this show in years and it looks like all the same characters are still doing the same things.”
The absence that began with Cas coming home to an empty apartment. The realization slowly driving a stake through his heart as the hours ticked by and Dean just wasn’t coming home. Cas wondered about it. Whatever happened in the time between that day and that day at the hospital this past June might as well have been written in a secret book, in a language that only Dean spoke.
I feel strongly about changing the name of this fic midstream. So I've altered the title - sorry. It came from a recent realization. I am transitioning it with both titles for a while so that those of you who have subscribed won't be confused. Eventually, it will just be titled "Where All My Journeys End." Also- A big thank you to those of you who have subscribed!
On day twenty Rufus started to talk to Dean about the possibility of going home, if he knew there would be support in place. Dean refused to consider going back to his hometown. He still couldn’t face Sammy and Bobby or anyone they knew. He couldn’t handle running into Cas. He couldn’t go “home.” He had wrecked it.
Cas couldn’t help but notice the way the sides of Dean’s eyes sparkled and his mouth quirked upwards despite him biting his lip.
Dean's eyes shifted from the road briefly, eyebrows raised, his gaze drifting swiftly back up and down assessing Cas's body in the seat next to him.
“Cas! Castiel!” Dean finally found his feet, grabbing his arm this time to stop him. “Please! I never wanted to hurt you like that..
The tall man turned back to Dean. “Cause if that’s the case boy, I got a little something we can give you deep inside there. Something you won’t forget.” He shook his empty beer bottle suggestively to the hoots and laughter of the other two men.
“From what you told me, he got you both the hell out of there...he saw what was happening to you, he knew to put ice in your hands. You were dissociating Dean. We talked about that before, remember? When your mind separates you from what’s happening to protect you from trauma. That’s why you can’t remember it all. In the ward sometimes we use ice or a cold compress to bring someone out of it. The discomfort forces your mind to reconnect with the present...with your surroundings, your body. Castiel must have known that somehow.”
“Yeah, okay. But only because I know you'll haunt me if I don't.” Dean’s voice was breathy as he tried to control his chaotic stream of thoughts and emotions. “Thanks man. Uhhh...try changing the transmission fluid.”
Dean held on long enough to hear the phone click on Cas’s end before putting his own receiver back. That silence was so goddam awkward...but maybe he’d dodged a bullet.
“You can’t just do this!... You...you can’t keep coming around like this and then pushing me away.” Cas looked pained. “Dean….I can’t....” he shook his head, “We can’t be friends.” There it was. It nearly broke him to get the words out, but Cas finally acknowledged it. “Not like this…” he added hastily. “I’m sorry,” Cas shook his head.
Bobby’s got me going to San Francisco tomorrow for the whole week and I should've said no, cause what if Sam’s in bad shape again?”
Those kinds of thoughts weren't usually welcome in the circles he ran in. Some minds had been changing, sure, and the people he loved most wouldn’t care, hell would even be over- the- moon- happy for them, but the fear of crossing that threshold in the moment had always done him in. And then there was the other issue. He never really knew if the spark he sensed from Cas when they were together was something that the angel felt as well. Until that day, and then it was too late.
Cas asked about Bobby, and over the next hour or so they fell into conversation about ordinary things. Dean worked mostly at the shop in Sacramento, but was helping Bobby when he needed to deal with business here on occasion. Dean hadn’t really gotten the chance to explore the city yet outside of a few days, plus the night out with Cas and Balthazar at Cafe Luna. He hadn’t known Cas was in San Francisco until recently.
Cas found his throat too tight for words. Dean noticed his silence and stiffened as he realized why.
"I haven't thought about Thanksgiving at all.” He said honestly. “When I was in San Francisco Balthazar and I just went out to eat. Dean and I ...we used to get together with Sam and Jessica.”
Cas blushed even redder, his eyes dark, rimmed with blue like the night sky. He was ready, eager, compliant.
Cas’s breathless sigh on the other end of the line wrapped around him like arms, holding him close. In his mind’s eye he could see Cas’s soft gaze, lovestruck...steady, blue, and bright as the light of a thousand stars on the ocean.
“It's not stupid or pathetic Cas…. are you kidding me? It’s completely normal to freak out a little when you break up with someone - especially when you’re the one who made the move. But it sounds to me like you were with him for the wrong reasons and left for the right reasons.”
Cas settled on an album that had a soothing kind of quiet feel and got an approving hum from Dean with the first few bars of
It was some time after that, that Dean finally opened up to Benny, and by extension, the group - but it was really Benny’s reaction that Dean was most concerned about. Most of his life he hadn’t given a fuck what anyone thought about his sex life, and that was still mostly true, but it was also lonely sometimes. Benny often called him ‘brother,’ and without Sam around, Dean had come to see him as one. The strength of that endearment was about to be put to the test.
“You’re a lifesaver!” She’d told him, but really Cas felt like he was the one making out with the better end of the deal. The little kid in him was thrilled and as always he was grateful for the diversion.
“I know that you’re gonna be a brilliant doctor someday because you’re a good person, I know that you make me laugh, and you don’t judge people for their lack of money, or education.”
A pair of hands slid up Cas’s sides, followed by strong familiar arms gripping him from behind, settling into an embrace along the front of his hips .
Cas reached into the small box and felt cold glass rounded under his fingertips. He pulled the item out of the tissue paper inside to reveal a snow globe. In the center a small but detailed rendition of the rotunda of the Palace of Fine Arts. Cas sighed thinking of the night he took Dean there. The first time Cas had felt the whisper of a hope that Dean still felt something too.
Castiel lay on top of the bed in a pair of Dean’s navy sweats and a faded "Bad Company" tee. Dean thought he’d never seen him look so “human”...well except for maybe when Cas had actually been human. He didn’t move as Dean entered.
“Hey, don’t sweat it. It’s not like it’s a date or anything,” Dean laughed nervously. “ It’s just...you know…” Dean winced, “
He looked at the clock. It was late, but still possible Cas might have gone out. Dean thought about  getting up and just driving to his house, but that would take hours and he’d have to drive right back and with the exhaustion pulling on him already he didn’t think it’d be safe.
“Come with me…” Cas flicked his head towards the house, then turned and marched back towards Hannah and the children with Dean in tow.
The morning stillness was disrupted as a busload of tourists flooded the tea garden but it was okay. Cas felt the buzz of life around him and was ready to step back into it. He rose and brushed off his pants, walking in silence, mentally rehearsing what he might say to Balthazar later in the day.
He lowered his voice so Sam wouldn’t hear. “I’m so sorry Cas.” Dean’s eyes were pleading, “Can I see you again?”
. Hearing it from Sam now spoken out loud reminded him of how he had let everyone down. He didn’t want to hurt Cas anymore.
“About 20 more minutes give or take.” Dean noticed the man glancing back at him occasionally in the rearview. “You meeting someone?”
“Stay put a second!” Dean threw a reassuring smile Cas’s way before opening the door and stepping out. He rounded the front of the car again quickly to open Cas’s door, taking Cas’s hand briefly as he stepped out, then closing the door behind him. Cas looked at him with awe.
Sam grabbed the duffle bags with their clothes. Dean opened the back passenger door and woke Cas who braced his weight on the door as he got out of the car. Dean ducked his shoulder under Cas’s arm and reached around his back to steady him.
Roman ruins scattered across the countryside made the experience blase and cheap, but Cas enjoyed the quiet beauty of the place.
“I can’t do this Benny.” Dean exhaled. “I’m sorry I asked you to come down here...I thought it would be less awkward for Cas in a group… but I can’t do this.”
“Eat your food, Beautiful,” Dean smirked, unscrewing the lid to the ketchup bottle and shaking some onto the plate.
“Yeah, yeah Cas! I remember. I was the one who ended up wearing the coffee remember? You probably spill just as much only you don’t have any casabas so it falls straight down. So anyway we were talking about you.”
He paid the young woman at the register and Cas helped him carry them and place them in the trunk of the Impala.
Dean didn’t know what he expected to see in her eyes. Disgust? Disdain maybe? But he stood there looking at Mildred, her eyes soft, only empathy and love looking back...and Dean actually broke and cried, quietly...right there in the kitchen. He tried to compose himself but his shoulders shook with the effort as she enveloped him in her arms.
“I’m gonna head back now Cas,” he said matter of factly as if Cas hadn’t spoken, looking towards Cas’s middle, but not daring to look up at his face. “It was good to see you….” he forced a weak smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Thanks.”
Dean’s hips seemed to take on a life of their own as Cas stroked him, unfastening his jeans and pulling down as Dean shifted and shimmied them around his thighs until finally his cock sprang free, erect and already
“Besides...if you want to work things out with Jess, maybe you still can. But she’s not going to put up with that shit.”
been special, or beautiful, or worthy enough to make Dean stay. Dean said it was the war, but the more Cas thought about it the more he realized if Dean could be with Benny now, it must have been more than that.
“It’s Tylenol Dean. It will help reduce your fever. I think you might have the flu.” Cas looked concerned.
Cas wondered briefly if he was dreaming. It was surreal. He hadn't seen his brother since the will reading. Hadn't really spoken with him in over ten years. Gabriel was somehow shorter than he'd remembered. A little more tired around the eyes. Suddenly, for all the resentment he had harbored, Cas wanted nothing more than to go get coffee with his big brother.
Cas’s hands clutched at Dean, wildly grasping for any part of him he could touch, caress, massage with his fingers as he moaned Dean’s name again and again. Dean slipped in a third finger, flexing and stretching them against Cas’s tight rim, prepping him for his cock even as Dean fluttered his tongue along the underside of Cas’s.
Cas gave him a wave too before turning and heading out to his car all the while thanking himself for having the foresight to have made the food he was supposed to bring ahead of time.
“No one’s ever...I’ve never been on a picnic before Dean,” he said, a soft expression overtaking him. “At least not one that wasn’t a family event.”
Another forty-five minutes passed, the sky darkening in the west as they waited, attending sporadically to more ghouls and goblins. The pleasant smell of woodsmoke drifted over from a small fire across the street. The neighbors pitched chairs around it while they awaited more trick or treaters. A soft breeze blew dried leaves in swirls along the sidewalk as Dean kept watch for Cas’s and the children’s return.
Before Dean arrived at Sam’s he took a route around the town to where he and Cas used to live. There were lights in the apartment above the street. His heart stopped briefly as he wondered if Cas was up there. He pulled over to the curb and cut the motor, watching. A shadow moved across the window casement. Dean took a breath and swung his leg over, getting off the bike. What would he say?
If you haven't read my multiple posts about it I am transitioning the title slowly to not confuse those who subscribed by email and stepped away. Next time I post, the revised title (Where All My Journey's End) will be the lead.
The movie told the story of a warm-hearted, undereducated, working-class man who fights to make his dream of becoming a boxer come true, all while falling head over heels in love with a shy, awkward, bespectacled girl who can’t understand how anyone would care to notice her, let alone fall in love with her. It wasn’t meant to be a tear-jerker, but there were several moments when Dean couldn’t help but find it difficult to swallow through the tightness in his throat -  Cas, tilting his head at Dean, a small furrow between his brows, as if he too felt like they were watching something akin to
Over the next week, Cas was battered by wave upon wave of pain. One minute he was okay, watching some idiot “buy” another vowel, losing money when clearly he already knew the answer to the Wheel of Fortune puzzle.
Conscious of Balthazar eyeing him, Dean decided he didn’t care. Two guys got up on stage next and covered Simon and Garfunkel’s Hazy Shade of Winter which turned Dean’s mood darker. The last thing he needed right now were songs laden with angst and regret. He had that in spades. Benny noticed that Dean had gone inward - fading from the conversation again.
He was some combination of angry, exhausted, but mostly he was ashamed of himself. He needed to be alone. He wanted to sleep, then shower, then maybe he would have it in him to face Dean.
On his way home from work Dean stopped at a store to pick up something little he’d seen that had made him think warmly about Cas. He kept it stashed on the front seat of the car while he quickly ran into his apartment to shower, shave and get dressed.
Cas at least felt a weight lifted now that he had actually said the words, had gotten the depth of the hurt he’d experienced off his chest instead of biting it back - had let Dean know in no uncertain terms that he
If Dean were being honest with himself he might have acknowledged that relaying the number would give him one more chance to hear Cas’s voice, which he deeply desired to hear, angry or not. If he were being honest with himself, which of course he wasn’t.
Sam told everyone about how once their old man, promised to take them out for Sammy’s 10th birthday at this drive-in diner in Poughkeepsie. He came home shit-faced instead, cursing at them until passing out drunk. Sam was so heartbroken it made Dean furious. Putting a finger to his lips signaling Sammy to be quiet Dean crept up quietly and sewed their father into the bed, actually sewed him with a needle and thread into the fucking bed! Cas snorted a laugh and Dean smiled remembering.
Rachel was undeterred. “Dean,” she said, giving him a quick hug, also careful to grab him from his cleaner side. “Thank you for giving Cas my number.”
“Yeah okay shut up, you can bring your guitar too. Jess wants to play. Come on, quit pining and get your sorry ass out of there.”
you!” Dean accused louder now. “You told her I was here and that you couldn’t tolerate being around me.”
Ante bellum, post bellum, post absentia. A Holy Trinity of Deans. Despite the pain and heartbreak implicit in it, Cas still loved them all.
“It’s from scripture,” Cas breathed. “Not all of scripture is hellfire and damnation Dean. There are ancient poems of love. Human love. I started reading some of it again years ago when I was trying to understand what I felt for you.”
So they finally did it! They went on an official date and Dean put up with (and managed to enjoy a little) DISCO FFS! You know that means he'll do ANYTHING to get his Cas back! I have to personally agree with Dean that disco isn't exactly my thing, but it was the mid-seventies and Cas is a crazy sexy bitch on the dance floor so what are you gonna do right? Thankfully for Dean, in their timeline Tom Petty has just released his debut album, and Fleetwood Mac's Rumours (of which I have on good authority Cas, in particular, will be a big fan) will be released in a few short months, so hold on Dean and Cas - the music scene is about to change again!
“Cas…” Dean was drunk with the feeling of Cas’s body against him in the thickening dark -drunk with the aura of this place.
Cas had first heard it on the radio when Dean was in Vietnam, when he’d regretted their agreement not to write and wished so badly he could send one of the letters he’d written, or read one from Dean. At the time it pulled at the place just inside of his breastbone, filling him with a physical ache for Dean’s return. Then, after Dean left and went missing, he found he couldn’t bear to listen to it at all without feeling horribly sad.
“I’d have taken you to Oakland for a real game but that would make your drive home a lot longer and I know you’ve got Andrea waiting.” Dean told Benny as they shook hands in the parking lot at the end of the game.
“Promise me you won’t work tomorrow?” Cas pleaded, “Promise me you’ll let yourself rest at least one more day?”
In the meantime, the work at the club and the warehouse combined made Cas just enough to cover his rent and expenses now while he got his plans in order. He didn’t need his mother’s money, or anyone else’s for the first time in a long time and that felt amazing.
“I’m gonna have to run 20 miles to burn off all of this,” Cas waved at the remnants of the food they’d consumed.
“Uh….yeah,” Cas recovered himself, fumbling around with the map until he found the right spot. “No, the on-ramp is up ahead on the right.”
..thought you'd think I was crazy to say it." His breath came in little huffs as Dean kissed and nibbled and worked him with his tongue.
Cas propped himself up on one arm, stroking Dean’s side with his other hand. He reached for Dean’s hand and brought it up to kiss his fingers. “I’ve never loved anyone before either Dean...but I love you...I love you too.”
Sam tossed him a bottle. Over the months that Dean had slowly worked to put himself back together, he had stopped drinking hard liquor, maybe a single shot once or twice in an extremely controlled atmosphere. He found he could have a few beers occasionally and not go off the rails. But now, the lure of the spread of warmth that a little too much would bring, the blunting of emotion he so craved right now...it was like a siren’s call. This was not a time he trusted himself to be able to stop at one, or two, or six, and right now he needed to think.
Cas’s head tilted slightly and he shook his head, looking back at Dean, eyes dark as a forest clove. “Make love to me,” his voice strained as if he might be on the edge of crying.
“I love this Dean!” Cas smiled, as if reading his thoughts. He brought Dean’s hand back down to rest on his waist, and Dean felt a flush come over his own face, his heart near to bursting.
Dean rode first to his apartment to shower and change, then straight to Sam and Jess’s place. It was getting close to dinner time and Jess offered to throw an extra hamburger or two on the grill for Dean. Dean realized he hadn’t eaten yet today so graciously accepted her offer, even though he had no appetite and wasn’t sure anything would stay down.
Sam.” Even as he said it he knew it was a lie. He had been working like a madman the past few days to try to keep from thinking about Cas. Every idle moment, seeing Cas in the gardens, Cas’s hands on his hips, pulling him close. He was sure Cas had felt it too, but then he pulled away. Being rejected was bad enough - but he sure as hell didn’t want to talk about it with Sam. Dean thought Sam must be either oblivious or stupid as he continued to press the point.
Dean took a cup down from the cabinet and had just poured himself some coffee when the phone rang again.
Dean knew that was a possibility, and to be honest he didn’t really know what he wanted. “Look Sam. Right now, I’m just going crazy not knowing if Cas is safe...if he’s well. Something put him in that hospital and I need to know that he’s going to be okay. If he doesn’t want to see me...well then, I could understand that. At least I’ll know.”
Cas shook his head slightly, "umm..nothing..it's just that, I haven't really done that in years. Like since before-" Cas cut himself short.
Dean's cock practically jumped in Cas's hand at the words - the noise he made in response, part gasp, part pleading groan,
“Really?” Dean glanced over at Cas briefly then back at the road, his voice thick with skepticism, the ghost of a smile riding his lips. “What exactly?”
Cas nodded. “But…. things changed.” Cas rubbed over Dean’s knuckles gently one last time before releasing Dean’s hand.
They yelled, they talked, they argued, Dean reasoned, Sam listened. Over the drugs mostly, but also over the ridiculous trajectory that Sam’s notion of “success” had taken.
They can’t, so to fit in or cope they self-medicate. Some become addicts or worse, overdose. Some get caught buying, or selling or using. Sometimes they get into a fight and do physical or property damage. Sometimes they get caught stealing for drug money. Either way the story is the same - a dishonorable discharge, which leads to a loss of their VA benefits. The government writes them off and with no support and no money for treatment the prognosis is bleak. It's true that some find their own path to healing. But some spiral out of control, broken homes and broken minds in their wake.
After what felt like a little more than an hour the house was quiet. Dean sat up in the dark and threw a hand to his head to press out the stabbing pain that came from moving too quickly. He noticed that Cas’s bedroom light was no longer lit. Dean quietly felt for his own clothes, which Cas had folded and placed on the coffee table. He shed Cas’s pajama pants and shirt and put his own jeans and tee back on. He sat for a minute unsure of what to do, then fumbled in the kitchen until he found a pad and pen in the dim glow of the stove light. He wrote a quick note to leave on the kitchen counter, then pulled on his socks and boots.
“Well that’s interesting. Right let's get back to the bunker to see what the nerd is doing.” Dean said while finishing his drink.
He made his coffee with the coffee machine, set it down on the kitchen side and then kissed his angel on the forehead.
“Look, they look to see if it’s clear and then the other sneak out the side.” She pointed to where she meant and took more pictures.
“I was walking to my apartment, when I heard what I thought was a familiar voice. I went down the alleyway to see who it was, I then heard another voice. I couldn’t quite place this voice, so I looked around the corner and saw Hastur with the angel Uriel.” He got a picture up on his phone and showed the court. “As you can see the angel calmly talking to this demon. They are talking about getting into the forbidden part of hell that only high demons, like the prince or dukes, could get access to. The angel described a stone they want retrieving, a purple stone that has a pulsing glow. He said he could steal it for them if they could get him his wings back.” Crowley finished, going to stand back next to Beelzebub.
“Why do I smell other angels Zira?” He used his pet name for the angel so he didn’t sound too pissed about it.
“What? …. Oh no angel I’m fine. Need something stronger than tea to wake me up.” He said lazily. Yawning while walking towards the kitchen.
“To get back into Heaven where your angel lover is. I know all about your love for Uriel. Shame they are a purist.” Bee sternly replied. “Once you have fallen, there is no way back.”
“I was in the grocery store getting what Sam asked, and when I was in the line to pay I heard these two ladies talking about livestock dying. I thought it might be demons but they also said they had all their blood drained and their throats were cut. I found this odd. What sort of creature would do such a thing, I tried to go through all the ones I know but none of them do this.” Cas was genuinely confused about this. His brow even furrowed.
“So those locals were right but the reason they see only two is because the other six sneak out the side. They use dairy cans to carry the blood back to the nest. The ones coming out of the side look like newly turned vamps, which I guess is good for us. Wonder if the Alpha has found out yet?” She shrugged her shoulders. “You guys get anything?”
Cian let his legs give way. “Cool fangs dude! Where did you get them from? My sister has a party next week, wanna be like that dude from Twilight movies or whatever …. The ones that sparkles… He is the
“It was, where have your hands been?” She grinned. “You made the right choice Beany, don’t fight your inner curiosity.”
The last time being Aziraphale tried to get Crowley’s body unwrapped from his own so he could make a cup of tea and get a book. It didn’t go quite to plan and they both ended up on the bedroom floor. Crowley was grumpy for the rest of the day. More grumpier than normal.
It was about an hour later that the demon arose from his slumber and went to find his angel. Red hair sticking out in all different directions, his bed shirt hung over his shoulder and with nothing but pants underneath the bed shirt.
They had gotten out of bed and gotten dressed, Crowley had said he would treat the angel to some crepés. Crowley decided that they would have a chilled day; take a walk around the park and feed the ducks, call at the old book store so Aziraphale can pick out a new book, and lastly watch the last of the Star Wars movies while cuddling. Perfection.
Sam laughed at the face he was pulling. God knows what was going through his head but it must be interesting to pull a face like that. He huffed and went to get a shower. He looked at his watch while going down the hall. 9:46am.
“You have to go if you have been summoned, I will be here waiting for you.” He smiled and gave him a quick kiss.
"No but I bet there is something else he has to offer." Cian teased while the twins got laughing again.
Crowley got to Hell and went straight to the courtroom, they were all there waiting for him. He went and stood next to Beelzebub, bowing his head on his way past.
“Oh I see you brought me my tea dear. I didn’t realise it was that time already, it has flown by this morning.” Aziraphale beamed with a smile.
“That you are right Hastur, but there is one thing you weren't counting on. Love.” They said with disgust. “It is something you can not escape. Your stench has changed, you are starting to smell of angel.”
"Okay let's stop talking about this shall we?" Dean sighed while squeezing the bridge of his nose. "What you got Cas?"
Cian had his eyes on these two men and a woman, they had been in the pub 3 hours and only had one drink. Jack had tried to read their minds but he only got little bits of information.
“Nothing, he just likes to follow orders. But then again, he only follows your orders.” Sacha winked at him.
I am SOO sorry about the 4 week delay. I think it's 4 weeks, all my days have rolled into one. Since the Covid-19 outbreak has reached the UK I have had to pick up a lot more shifts as it has been manic at work, and still is.
He made the choice to knock on his sister’s door, not knowing how she would react. Most mornings she was unpredictable when they tried to wake her up. Apparently she needed her beauty sleep.
I am so sorry about the MIA for 3 months! Work has been a killer BUT now that covid has calmed down I can get back to posting my regular times. The next update will be 28th and every week after that. Just one more hectic week and then back to normal shifts thank god.
Cian got up and went back to the table his family were standing at, he wiped his mouth on his sleeve. “Yeah they’re definitely vamps, even growled at me with his fangs out. Must have put such a good act on.” He chuckled a bit. “Must be a new one as the older ones would expose themselves like that.”
“You know what, yeah we shall. I’m actually wanting to watch them. I’ll strap my brothers in for the ride too.” She smirked at her two older brothers.
“There may be a grumpy Brit in there.” She teased knowing they’ve currently got three grump Brits in the dungeons. “But then again it may not be anywhere near them at all. Who knows Dean. Who knows?” She smirked, this was payback for the interruption.
Dean looked at his sister with a furrowed brow. “Well they know we’re here now …. Why are you so angry at a Pokémon battle for anyway?” He knew she needs coffee, sugar or an energy drink and fast or she will throw that game out the window and cry after.
“Am I going to find some stupid pomegranate seeds there or are you not that hopelessly literal, huh, Hades?”
More tar. And more and more and more. If Cas is still saying anything, Dean can’t hear it. Too much tar everywhere. Too many shards. Too much water.
“Of course you didn’t,” Castiel comments surprisingly coolly. “You only watch the news when it’s convenient for you to nag at my,” and there go the fucking air quotes, un-fucking-believable, “mistakes.”
“Never mind. Are we good to go now?” he asks, although, truth be said, he’d keep on standing here and bitching ad infinitum if he only could because the attractions that are meant to follow are hardly alluring.
No. He’s still naked, he’s still meant for breeding, he still has been stabbed, he still had to kill a dude, a fellow fucking hunter at that, Sam is still dying three rooms away and the evening still is nowhere near over yet. Having the blood go away makes literally no difference. The answer is no.
Castiel grimaces for a really small moment, a glimpse behind the curtain of anger, before he tames his face back into that “ oh, I’m here to help you, I’m your family, sweetie” warmth of goddamn Hestia and all the hearths ever put into flame to worship her name. Dean wonders if Cas ate her, too.
“It doesn’t comfort me,” Dean snaps because this is the last fucking thing it does, actually. It just makes need and misery form one ugly bile of hopelessness. It brings his body peace, rubs his want and body in all the right places – a blink of the so wanted contact while still keeping his mind at bay because there is soft, holy and powerful flesh separating him from touching it, not letting take over him. But knowing what it will do to Cas – it almost hurts like a motherfucker.
“Instead of what?” he knows. But he just wants to find out what Dean will tell him now. Or in two days. Or in a week, if they even make it that long (something in Sam’s guts tells him
Dean rushes to open the closet and, for the time being, ignores stealthiness as a concept and messily runs his hands and eyes through layers of white-ish crap until he hits jackpot on the first vaguely pant-shaped thing. Good enough. Wasting no time, he gathers his dumb dress up and attempts to put his finding on, and on his way discovers the following:
“Considering how little you truly know about your mother, perhaps it would much be better for you if she stayed that way.”
Lucifer comes closer, the tips of his shoes touch Dean’s feet. “No, you won’t,” he says and kisses Dean, startling him. “This time you will watch him destroy the world.” He laughs. “Darkness rode within you and light now rides within him, isn’t that poetic? He looked at you back then and knew that he lost you. Now you’ll look at me and know that you lost him,” he hums.
Temperature on the tiny screen doesn’t even budge beyond 97 degrees. Course it doesn’t. So much for boiling his old bones a bit into something akin to numb relief.
“No. You had me kill a dude because he talked shit about me while you only muted fucking Crowley for doing the same damn thing. What the fuck is wrong with you? Fuck that. What isn’t wrong with you?”
In front of his eyes, instead of an answer of any, even violent kind, Castiel’s face in quick succession crumbles into all four out of five stages of grief and that…. That’s something that has Dean’s alarm bells ringing.
Castiel puts his fingers on Dean’s fingers. Really? Flying to the back yard when they can walk? Will the nonsense ever cea—
“Thanks for the heads up, my favorite Sharknado bringing weather girl, fairest of them all,” Dean mocks easily, fearlessly, like he was born into doing just this. To some degree he’s kinda genuinely amused. Since, in the grand scheme of things, this is impossibly inconsequential and void of importance and yet, another Armageddon is about to come knocking on the door of his ass because Dean decided to add one extra syllable to the mix and keep it. That’s not just petty. That’s dumb. Which is exactly why Dean is not going to stand down. “Warn me and bitch at me and threaten me all you fucking want. My mind’s made up, Castiel,” he sneers, challenge and insult transparent in his tone, bold.
Nadya’s face tells him he’s gonna get whacked like one if he doesn’t shut up right now. He doesn’t know how she managed to form such a thin unimpressed line out of her at some point heavily injection-improved lips, but she just fucking went and did it like it’s no big deal. She’s mimic talented even if scarce, he’ll give her that.
He gets in. The water is just this side of scorching, but manageable. Now not to fuck it up, cause it’s gonna be embarrassing if he does. There’s a handful of easier and faster ways, but the luxury of having the option isn’t given to him. First of all, if there’s anything on this planet that is a waste of a bullet, that’s his stupid brains. With his naivety, there’s no contest. Secondly, there are no guns in this house. Dean’s been informed he doesn’t need them anymore. Divine protection is supposed to be enough, but he guesses there’s a different reason beneath that explanation. Of course there’s nothing he could do to Cas with one, but there are other things he might be dangerous to. Like himself. The only reason why he has this silly, little knife is because he insisted he doesn’t need people to peel his damn apples for him and he can do that on his own, all four and what not. It requires a lot of effort to hurt something with this little bitch, but luckily, Dean is always full of determination. All right. Excuse for a knife in left hand, he goes down his wrist deep and fast, careful not to fuck his tendons up cause that would be stupid and twice as stupid if he’s unlucky enough to survive. Repeat with hand right. Lie down. And now we wait, he concludes.
“Got a Lexus RX last year. Very nice brown. Still had that new car feel. I miss it,” she says with a pout.
“It's fine,” Castiel tells him mildly and somewhat absent-mindedly as he runs his eyes over the list. “Neither of those things followed, though, did they?” he adds with a nick of snark in his otherwise peaceful tone. “Everything from your list will be easy to acquire. Looks like a very uncomplicated soup. Would you like me to stock up some more of this for the future, Dean?”
Death only shakes his head. So he doesn’t understand. “Before he hurts himself?” he echoes in disbelief. “You lead the horse to water and it drowned instead of drinking,” Death huffs.
Castiel immediately throws his arm around him, just in case he changed his mind and wanted to get the hell out of Dodge. Which, yeah, he does, but luckily for Cas, he can’t.
He touches his cheek and split lip absentmindedly and can’t figure out for shit how to answer that question. In a way, that’s related. The bitch slap was about control. So was the plan to turn Russia into a garden to have Dean give up and embrace his lack of options. And so was messing with Sam’s wall. Control, control, control. If there was something more to it, Dean fails to see it. And doesn’t care.
Of the seven men in the group, four were vets including Dean. Inwardly Dean found himself listening to parts of his own story being told through the mouths of strangers. It was hard to listen to, and at the same time strangely affirming to know, “
Dean took the cup. His hand trembled and it threatened to spill so Cas guided it towards Dean’s mouth, until he got both hands around it, drinking some of the cold water down.
He’d spoken with Jessica earlier and backed out of dinner at their place for the second time this month, fully prepared to be scolded by Sam for being antisocial when he found out. Lately though he found he had too many thoughts racing through his head. The only way he’d found to still them was to immerse himself in work, music, or outside of that, books.
“That’s the epic journey Dean, the hero’s quest. It’s not enough to win the battles, you have to find your way home,
As time went on Dean didn’t always have the urge to chime in to the conversation, but he also didn’t feel like a deep secret kept him from it. Things between Benny and him were good, and probably, Dean reasoned because he didn’t seem like some standoffish asshole, he actually became closer to some of the other guys in the group. He couldn’t say that he was “happy” but over the course of the next few months he had more of what he thought of as happy “moments” than he had in a long time. Dean was slowly finding a rhythm in life again, and with that rhythm those around him occasionally got a glimpse of the old Dean, cocky, flirtatious, self-assured. He found he looked forward to the things he did each day at the shop -  helping people, fixing things  - instead of just trying to escape the day.
The first night, he’d told Sam a bedtime story he made up on the fly and then curled up against him in the bed until Sam fell asleep.
Benny crashed on Dean's couch for the night. The next day Dean took Benny to the shop to introduce him to Bobby and show off Baby. The only work left was cosmetic in nature so Dean took the keys and brought her out for a spin. Later Dean switched over to his bike and led Benny to a burger joint north of Sacramento before heading further north for an Angels game in the afternoon.
Nodding to Dean he said politely  “It was nice to see you Dean. It really was. You seriously don’t have to worry about me anymore. You have good things going on in your life,” Cas’s tone had softened, but the warmth was gone from his voice. “Give Sam and Jess my love.”
“I was supposed to be home earlier but I got asked to cover part of someone’s shift. Kind of too new to feel comfortable saying ‘no’ yet.”
“Mmmm” Rufus nodded in agreement. “Well Mr. Winchester... Dean, over the next 72 hours we’re going to be seeing a lot of one another..”
Cas disappeared down the hall and returned with a heavy sheet instead. He bent to tuck it around Dean. “I’m sorry, no blankets allowed. You can’t overheat, baby,” he said, putting the back of his hand against Dean’s forehead to feel for his temperature. “Need to bring your fever down.”
Dean clutched the edges of Cas’s shirt with shaking hands and pulled until he had it over his head, Cas pulling his arms free and tossing it aside. Dean’s hand now went to the front of Cas’s jeans, near the button of his waistband, to sit low on his stomach, where Dean slowly, slowly as if mapping the terrain of Cas’s abdomen with touch alone, let his fingers press into soft skin over toned muscle. Cas sat with lips parted, eyeing Dean as he slid his hand higher, his fingers splaying to take in as much of Cas as he could.
The rest of the Winchester family looked at him in shock, Cian was never one to plead with anyone. He especially never offered to do favours, he may not be good at hand to hand combat or cheating, but he could hold his own so this was his way of saying it was above them all.
She pulled a face, pushed a button, then waited. “Nah, it’s too clever for them. That would be the alpha’s idea if they was, and if they are veggie he wouldn’t be too happy about it. Something in my gut tells me someone or something
"Sacha if you don't get your ass up Dean will drink all the coffee and Cian bought you some Lucky Charms." He all but shouted. He also heard Dean shout something but couldn't quite hear him.
“Well I suppose after that scare.” He looked at the angel. “You’re a sap you know that? Oh hail Mary.”
“Alright, it was just a suggestion.” He kissed the angel’s cheek. Once he pulled away his phone buzzed. “Oh what now?” He spat as he looked at the phone, his face tensed.
Aziraphale had a little blush on his face. He didn’t want anything really apart from being close to the demon. “Just to spend time with you dear. That is all I desire.”
Crowley knew what Bee was on about, it was something only he knew about the prince. They were in love with an angel also, but this angel loved them back, Gabriel. Crowley only knew because, like the incident with Hastur, he was in the wrong place at the right time. He saw the angel and demon kissing. Then he had to run as the angel had seen him. The next time he saw Bee he didn’t say anything until they brought it up, which they didn’t, and hasn’t since.
When Dean finally arrived at the main study covered in oil and grease he sat down. Sam handed him a coffee so he could calm down a little after his tinkering.
“Don't worry about that, Dean,” Castiel says, sounding as nondescript as only oatmeal standing too long on a counter could not-taste. “This won't happen to you again. I'll make sure of it.”
Her lean, professional hands shake as she’s filing his now flawlessly oval-shaped nails. Each time she accidentally scratches his skin with the file, her breath hitches audibly and she stares at him with wide eyes, most likely expecting condemnation and demise coming in random order.
That doesn’t calm him down at all. Still, he switches to breathing consciously and attempts to focus on it instead of on the sobs that want to rip through his throat and howl.
That’s like five moral lines crossed with three words in Dean’s book of Fuck Off, Clingy God and he’s not going to let that slide so easily even if it’s the last damn thing he does before his mouth gets matrix-like unmade or something.
Castiel looks up and realizes he let the tension out of himself too soon. It returns, ten-fold as strong.
“You’re fucking greedy, you know that? You’ll get all the fun stuff and a goddamn pony when we get back. Wait.”
Dean does and watches all the light wilt out of the man’s eyes. He didn’t even know his name. It’s like the first day of apprenticeship in hell all over again.
“Good. Thanks,” Dean says, and really means it. He feels washed over by a normal, human, familial warmth he was scared he forever lost. Holy fuck. It’s like he’s high on this shit now. High as a fucking horse. Fuck, that’s nice. But hey, business. “Trash can still there?”
To Dean it sounds kinda along the lines of “I haven’t fucked you in a bathtub yet, but I’m happy to try” and no, simply no.
It makes him think about Lisa, how her hair was always soft to the touch, otherworldly delicate beneath his fingers, scented like something heaven should be but isn't, all cascades of something precious and dearly missed. So impossibly different from the strands he's touching right now, clearly combed while he wasn't awake, but not as pampered and nice as hers always was. Simply clean: the coarse bare minimum making home for plenty of silver under the myth of still being young and beautiful, if, when not really his heart, at least the feeling of his fingers is to be trusted.
“I chose the wrong means,” Castiel says, electing to ignore Dean’s words, which is an answer enough in itself. “You neither learn nor change through violence, do you. I was too blinded by anger to consider this and I apologize.” He smiles, thoughtful. And somehow, that’s even worse than the words alone. “I’ll change my methods. We have time to mend you, plenty of it.”
Dean slowly and gradually pulls a friendly tone and a matching expression right out of his ass as he keeps all his positivity there, the only place where it can still kinda fit.
“None of them,” Castiel assures, defensive. “I promise this is going to be a pleasant surprise. Besides, I think you've been punished enough for today and that your transgression was not severe enough to call for a lesson like that.”
Dean leans in and kisses him, chaste and innocent. That’s definitely not how Cas kisses him back. The feel of stubble against his skin and the wendigo mouth ripping his lips asunder almost drowns down the roar of the crowd cheering. Castiel licks and nips, relentless and hungry, until Dean willingly lets him in. Unable to switch his body to autopilot, he becomes overwhelmed by the sensations. He tries to kiss back and make it a believable show, but, compared to Cas’s efforts, that comes out rather pale. He’s never been this hungry, this thirsty. Not even in hell. He can’t replicate the sheer force of it. But he’s been desperate, he’s been needy and he’s been left alone, so he goes with that horsepower.
He clearly wants to do something, but Dean notices the warning glare Castiel gives him, so the crossroad bitch keeps his hands by his sides, angry but unmoving. Embracing the contorted sense of satisfaction and freedom, Dean punches him again, just because he can. “What was that for?” the king of hell whines, wiping the blood off of his lip.
“No, we're not, actually,” Dean spits, somehow both cold as ice and fuming. “How fucking dare you say shit like this three inches away from my face, you fucking two faced worm!? I don't even care anymore where you get your romance reference points from, but God, there should be a movie about people not being things, not being property for breeding, not being trophies! And in the end the girl should get to shoot the rapist asshole in the face, and I swear, I will make you watch it until the message sticks. I will fucking shoot you in the face, man.”
Surprise, surprise, he doesn't feel any better. Maybe he should throw the other glass as well. Fuck it, the jug too.
“And let me guess. Amplified it to the point of stupidity. I thought you said you won’t try and rewire me.”
“Who knows? One day I might want to,” Lucifer chuckles darkly. “Be careful what you wish for, Dean. I’ll be listening to both of you scream. We’ll have a gay old time.”
“Nonsense, Dean,” Castiel says, loudly talking over Crowley. “He’s a too useful pest to go to waste. We need assets like that. You might be fooled into believing he really is on your side, but the beautiful moment he finally understands you don't stand a chance, he will wrap himself back into my flag. Isn't that how you roll, Crowley? Your survival instinct has proven to be stronger than all those generic loyalty-blinded demons’. Well, most of the time. You seem to malfunction when it comes to my consort’s body, so allow me to remind you one last time,” Castiel warns coldly. “It is mine, he is mine, his soul is mine, and all of these things belong to me. Looking at Dean belongs to me. Liking what I see belongs to me. Making any use of that belongs to me,” he snarls. “I appreciate your services, but don't think I am above replacing you with a shit on a stick if I'll have to and carving you into Christmas decorations for just one more vaguely lustful transgression.”
But damn, he should be the one comforting her, not the other way around. She has lost much, much more than he ever had because Cas had a point to prove. To Dean, probably. To do that, he eviscerated Russia, most of its inhabitants, and called it “Dean’s Garden” because he’s that much of a dick and more. As a result and reminder, Oksana is here, in Illinois. Where Castiel planted the rest of the people that had survived his judgment, Dean doesn’t know. He doesn’t know why Russia had to go to the glue factory, either.
“No, Dean. I’m wearing the person you love the most, just like I have before. It’s just that the person has changed. But like I said, that’s simply details.”
This is not the thing that is affecting Dean’s mood and the husband of the year can shove that narrative where the sun don’t shine, no lube. Preferably right now.
“Yeah, the one with fancy looking covered dishes? And vignettes?” she adds with sarcasm that for a moment strikes not only her voice but also her face.
“Dean!” he hears. And the same plea slash demand all over again. More pounding. He didn’t hear a “honey, I’m home,” but it’s the son of a bitch alright. Dean guesses his spidey senses were tingling.
“People in Syria are trying to live normally again after the war. I didn’t want to cause them any more additional turmoil,” Cas says.
“Which is exactly why I find what you’re trying to accomplish ill-advised and I’m warning you not to do that. You’re not going to like what gets out of there once you yank it out,” he comments instead.
Castiel has been afraid of this day for months and all he wanted, was for it not to come. He was afraid. Since he lost his second wings of hope. Since he discovered that things like love are small and when they wilt, they leave terror in their wake because a sad-eyed mother carved out of a man had lost his brother in Detroit, his child. And when Dean died beside him, his walking corpse spread the illness of fear into the humid air.
Cas’s frown magically turns into a smile. Once, Dean loved making Cas smile. Now, each time Dean does this, he gets disturbed by a very foreboding feel of nausea. It’s almost fascinating how things can violently change in such a short span of time.
Either way, because Dean still hates himself, he doesn’t call him. At this point whether the hatred comes from wanting to call or not doing it, is open for discussion. One Dean doesn’t want to have with himself. What he wants is his blade.
Everything in Dean stumbles at that, it puts his hatred off it's momentum. A rare sight like this one sends out tiny, confused wisps of light; of hope that maybe somewhere deep at the core, under the dirt, the power, the pride, there's still the Castiel he remembers, the Cas he can and should save; that his mind got scrambled with, got butchered, and not simply freed from the filters and confines of limitations and inhibitions which Castiel shed easily and gladly like temporary skin, a cocoon to mothman his ass from or something. Dean doesn’t even know what. He’s at a loss. He’s at many, many concurrently experienced losses.
Walking back to the bed, where Dean half lies and totally does not want (any of this), he begins to stroke himself into hardness, moves efficient, gaze trained on Dean, determined and hungry. Dean cringes, because in these circumstances, in this context, this is definitely not a turn on. Once hard, Cas gets onto the bed and hovers above his prey, the intimidating dick hanging dangerously between them like an omen of demise, at least from Dean’s perspective.
“Oh, you sweet quick, quick little thing,” Castiel coos petting his arm and kissing the top of his head as he holds him bride-like and vice-like. “Will you ever stop being the first to walk into the fire, Dean? There is no one to save there on the other side, there's just harm. Here you can rest. You're supposed to rest.”

“I’ve already sent Oksana after the chickens, I hope you don't mind,“ he informs, without looking up, aiming for placating and soft as he gives the notebook back to Castiel. “She was under my strict orders and I didn't leave her much of a choice, so if you want to punish anyone, that would be me. I set the thing myself. I didn't want her to see us fighting at the table and you getting handsy and punching me into understanding your mysterious ways. Or, you know, also getting handsy and screwing me on the table. I just wasn't sure which would follow, but I wanted to spare her eyes, is all.”
“Guess I never even knew you then,” he says through gritted teeth and watches hurt flash briefly through Castiel’s too composed face.
“I made a choice? Fuck, Cas, where do I even begin? My options were either I go or Sam dies. Which twelve times out of ten doesn’t sit well with me and you know it. You not only used that against me like the sick fuck you are, you were the one who broke him in the first place!” Dean shouts as his palms ball into fists. “On purpose!” he adds uselessly.
is missing as if it was never there. Means to an end – he concludes yet another time and bitterly supposes that his and Cas’s idea of a proper end to this are two different things. This is a matter they certainly need to discuss, but not now – not to ruin the mood. Or, to be honest: the lack of it. He undresses rather inelegantly, all tired, frustrated movements, as if he were doing chores, not preparing for pleasure.
“God, let me have this,” Dean murmurs into Castiel’s mouth. Like he’s afraid it all is going to shatter. Not on Castiel’s watch. “I need this.”
Without a warning, there’s the sound of enormous wings flipping and nausea accompanies it. The church dissolves. And maybe he does, too. He still doesn’t know how this flying thing works, exactly. Not that he fucking cares.
But what the fuck about is Castiel's design of wrapping Dean up into these goddamn fucking church sunday dresses one after another when there's, more often than not, just the two of them to fuck, fight, and stare impassively at each other? When every single person in this house is perfectly and morbidly aware that Dean's not the woman Castiel paints him to be (or any other woman)? When right now he's probably the most hidden from the public eye loser to ever crawl the Earth and fail to die?
After making sure none of those can be reached from the chair on the other side, he sits down and waits, forcing oblivious innocence on his face. Gotta throw a little Stepford into this Springfield shit.
“I haven't seen you in a long time, Dean.” she whispers. “I thought you were dead this time,” she adds even quieter. “You look like you dug yourself out of your grave,” she points at the carnage on his head and his tired, sunken face not so subtly.
“What?!” he sneers, boiling. “What can you possibly say to me to turn this around? This was your last fucking betrayal. I hate you.” Dean hides his face in his hands and wishes for death. “I hate you, I hate you, I hate you,” he murmurs. “That’s my new vow,” he adds, louder.
“Are you sure?” he asks and it’s so fucking hilarious he has the audacity to ask for his consent now. He wishes Dean gave Chitaqua the same choice. But no, after Sam, he always was some kind of twisted priority.
What happens now seems to be pretty much the opposite. He’s aware of every step of the way and each one hurts. It hurts because even now his mind seems to be unable to reconcile the past with the present. He resents every single thing Cas does, hates every single thing he says. He detests the softness of his gazes and loathes every inch of his body his eyes had the doubtful pleasure of seeing. At the exact same time, his heart still tries to fight it. You hate the baobab, not him - it tries to reason. He was your friend. He saved you. He was kind. He meant well.
“Dad,” Castiel mutters through gritted teeth, playing along so he could give himself some time to figure this shit out (this shit is infigurable - his minds so very helpfully supply). “Never really met him.”
or he’s got a plan. Dean’s very disinclined to find out what that is. He’s too busy wanting and shaking. Lacking the object of his quite blatant desire is taking its toll on him faster than it did last time around and really – Dean doesn’t have the willpower to waste on wondering about things that don’t take him closer to his goal.
“These are not pockets,” he insists and tries to figure out how to get unstuck and take these off without gaining any more attention than he already has. “That’s an M&M’s stash.”
He’s about to find out. Tonight he’s not watching the sunset. He’s too done for that. Also, a job awaits him. Just another job, he tells himself. All the monsters in hell probably laugh at him now but he tries to be above self-pity. It’s his fault, he reminds himself. He earned this. God, the day he fell for Cas and his mind spat out his first “what if,” he wasn’t careful what he wished for. Now he has Cas without a war, without a stick in his ass, a Cas that wants to fuck him (obvious from how he touches him and how he looks at him when he thinks Dean doesn’t see) and somehow it went wrong. This isn’t what he wanted, but this is what he has and he’ll have to deal with that.
Apparently unbothered by it at all, Dean sits behind the steering wheel covered with a white sheet and bleeds through it like it’s the most normal thing in the world. Knowing Castiel’s thoughts, Dean offers, “It was until you fucked with the natural order.” And he shrugs.
“Of course it’s not. But your perspective is the only one that matters, right?” Dean smiles bitterly. “Any special effects I should expect from this sudden gain? Headaches? Clairvoyance? Augury?”
“Oh, yeah? Then when?” Dean asks, agitated because it makes no sense. He agreed to the whole thing at some point between very late last night or very early this morning. And he does not recall Cas getting up to conjure a speech in the middle of the night. The hold of his arms was firm and strong and it lasted until the very morning, without a pause. So something’s fucking not right here and it stinks.
“I forgive you,” he croaks, barely holding his shit together, whatever the fuck it is that he’s close to exploding with. “Were you... led into a stroke, Dean?” Stupid asshole is trying not to laugh. Asshole.
“I don’t. More than one hundred fifty thousand people die on Earth each day without me having anything to do with it.”
“Nadya,” she admits shyly, afraid of her words being overheard by the wrong sentient massacre on two legs.
It’s getting into t-shirt making too, huh? Family picture: Mother-slash-Father in a “Why” shirt, holding a rugrat wearing “Oh” rompers. Father Two-Slash-Thing just Being A Bitch And Ruining Everything This Time With That Fucking Face Suggesting He Understands And Knows and Owns Everything (also too long; this one Dean code-names Fucklahoma).
“Your brain is trying to cope with your situation,” Castiel explains, putting a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean decides there is no point in shrugging that off. You probably can’t shrug God off, anyway. “But it doesn’t have to be like this.”
Lain in their conjugal bed, Dean is left alone (not breathing yet, Castiel’s rational mind tries to supply). Castiel needs air and time before he approaches him again. His anger needs to simmer down. By the time he’s back, Dean’s probably going to be awake and sulking and hissing like a cat thrown into a shower. This is going to be a hard conversation. Upon taking his leave, he commands for his betrothed to be properly taken care of.
There’s no way they’re gonna believe a promise of better times coming out of a swollen mouth and a ripped lip. Unless he starts his grand sacred vow with ‘I fell down some stairs,’ which ruins his plan quite a lot since he intended to go with ‘I’d like to thank the Academy.’ Whichever option he chooses in the end, the big stupid idiot with no understanding of the concept of a joke will strike him down, which is weirdly liberating. Then again, Cas, the perfect strategist and thorough caregiver, might actually spare him physically and go with something more effective, like setting people on fire. So much for his speech and liberation.
“And if you won't be contained, Castiel will come here and contain us all for good!” she cuts Dean off before he can whine more, which is a good call because yeah, he would. “Now sit!”
“Me? Oh, I’m just,” he chuckles with something resembling honest embarrassment. “It didn’t want to drink. I’m just touching it lovingly so it would understand that it was necessary. I need to go deeper than the skin, Cas. Just like you.”
“Dove, Dean, baby,” Castiel tries, his voice soft like mush and almost begging. “You don't want to walk around with white spots and confusion in your head. Don’t do that just to spite me. What do you remember?”
“Giving you any amount of false hope would be too cruel. All I do is try to spare you the pain, can’t you see that?”
Castiel snorts a little but collects himself with Nadya’s grace. Still makes sure to roll his eyes on his way back to nonchalant grandeur.
“If it’s because you want him to look at you when you fuck him, you can just make him, you know? You’re not, just not, going to get the real deal back. Or your name. Considering the astronomical size of the horse you’ve fallen off, you’re the biggest loser in this house. And you’re competing with a bunch of refugees, a comatose prop, and, your favorite, the blackmailed, pregnant, trapped abusee who used to think you hung the moon, once.”
But Dean is now functionally existing enough to remember and plain accept that this is the wonderful set of fleeting impressions he’s smacked with when he gets clocked out so fast, sudden and deep that he doesn’t even remember the gong hitting him in the first place. And that it’s completely normal and nothing to worry about.
