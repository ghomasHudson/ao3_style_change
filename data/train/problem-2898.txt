A couple of days passed when Sam and Dean bring their new "guest" home. The first day was rough, Dean had to explain a lot to Tim, one of them being how to work a shower, which went surprisingly well. But with no news from Bobby, Sam had taken it upon himself to scour the internet for any small piece of information.
Dean cradles Castiel's jaw with his hand as the other one manages to find its way onto the angel's leg. Their kiss is tender, just as Dean hoped. They slowly pull apart, each not wanting it to end.
Vanessa gracefully flips herself onto her stomach, she pushes off the bottom of the pool with her hands and glides through the water to the surface. Once she breaks the surface she takes a deep breath of the cool air, smiling to herself as she slowly heads for the edge of the pool.
"Then he just couldn't bring himself to do it, he thought you would be mad at him for not calling, so he didn't," Sam says, he makes a left turn down a narrow road, out into the countryside.
"Yes tomorrow is technically my hatchday as my mom didn't give birth to me, my sister, or my brother," Vanessa says nonchalantly.
"That's good," Dean says, Vanessa moves her head and meets Dean's gaze. She gives him a sad look and shrugs. "I guess."
"Matter of fact I didn't, I just threw it on a bed and called it a day," Dean leans back into his chair and crosses his arms.
They carefully walk up the small old steps to the front door, Dean and Vanessa wait patiently for Sam to unlock the door. When he does, they quietly infiltrate the house. The front door leads into a small room with one couch and a small table facing a window with stairs facing the door.
Castiel looks at her, his electric blue eyes bore into hers. "It's not, I know for a fact that you like Dean, and I am messing with that."
Well, I hope that was nice and fluffy as can be, I have a Tumblr if y'all wanna hit me up and chat! I post art sometimes (ran out of ideas) and i've been meaning to put the fic up there but I'll do it eventually.
"You guys would love her, she's funny and nice, well, she is until you get her to play games," Vanessa shivers. "She's ruthless when it comes to monopoly."
By the time they reach the Africa area, they notice that there are a lot more families here, most of them with little kids in strollers.
Vanessa saunters her way through the kitchen, her dad had left during the first round of drinks while her dragons are outside (masked as dogs) doing their business. Vanessa slowly crawls up the stairs to find Dean at the top, laying down.
"That's fine, " Vanessa says smoothly. She looks up at Cas, his stunning wings nearly taking up the long room. "But you'll stay out there with me, right?" Vanessa says, almost using her puppy eyes on him.
"I'm an angel remember?" he explains as he stretches out his wings more. He rolls his shoulders and keeps them that way, almost like a dominance display that birds do.
"You're one to talk" the one with the knife points it at her and says "considering you've just revealed yourself, and working with hunters? This is a new low."
"I'd advise against it," Daniel smiles, leaning back into the couch. He watches with joy as Vanessa tears into the gift to reveal a large egg.
"Wow," both men say, astonished by what they're seeing. Vanessa quickly changes her eyes back to brown and her fangs, gills, scales, and fins disappear as well.
"Fine. You're lucky you're my date," Dean smirks as Vanessa summons her phone in her hands and hits shuffle on her playlist. Dean should like most of the songs considering they have the same great taste in music, but Vanessa doesn't know about the rest.
"Here you go, " Dean picks up a tall glass vile of iridescent gray scales and places it next to the stove.
With her vision blurred, she notices that she is in fact in her room, but she recalls falling asleep on the floor with Dean.
Their drinks arrive along with their food. Dean happily bites into his bacon burger as Sam drizzles a small container of ranch onto his salad.
"What?" He yells from the kitchen. She turns around and speed walks to the kitchen, where he's sitting at the table eating an apple.
"A-abuela, please help me," Sarah looks at her grandmother for help, but Maggie turns away. "Fine then," Sarah throws her arms out, slamming Castiel and Vanessa back into their seats so hard that the chairs almost tip over, Vanessa tries to fight Sarah's magic with her own as Sarah runs out the front door.
Sam smirks at him. "You wouldn't, you'd have to be sober almost 24/7 and you can't swear in front of five-year-olds."
Dean turns to glare at him, he takes a seat right next to him and groans. "I'm fine, it's just the damn sun, it's too bright" Dean complains, if the curtains were open any longer, Dean's small headache would've gotten worse.
They finish their breakfast in awkward silence, Vanessa finishes her tea and stands to put everything in the sink. She brushes her hands on her shirt and heads for the living room. Behind the stairs is where Vanessa's small office is, the door is in the living room beside the archway. Vanessa opens the door and switches on the overhead light, breathing in the stagnant air, she closes the door behind her.
Dean tilts his head and stays quiet for a moment. "I dunno, blue?" He shrugs, they stay quiet for a moment, enjoy the sounds of small waves crashing onto the lake's beach until Dean comes up with another question.
"Okay, my favorite TV show...of all time...is probably..." Dean sighs before saying. "Doctor Sexy MD."
Cas grunts unhappily. Vanessa turns to look at him, his lips turned into a small frown, and his hard gaze is on Vanessa, unhappily watching her talk about Dean. "You okay back there?" Vanessa asks as she raises a brow.
Vanessa sits next to him and shrugs. "Well after lunch is when we have, well, lunch, then dessert, and then presents."
"Now you handsome," Vanessa says, pushing the bottle towards Sam as she pulls the herbs and bandages towards Castiel. "Is it okay if I call you Cas too?" She asks.
"I'll meet you, Sam, and Vanessa, there," Bobby tells Dean as he scratches both purring dragons, "and Dean."
"Yeah, you don't have to actually help us with killing anyone, but you could accompany us, " Dean explains poorly.
"Sam I suggest you just sleep on the couch, no way any of us can carry you up the stairs, but Cas you could go sleep in one of the guest bed..." Vanessa trails off as she remembers that she blasted him through the door. "I'm so sorry for shooting you through the door"
He swings his legs off the bed and stands, quietly stretching put his back and wincing when it pops loudly. He takes one step towards the door before he feels his whole body freeze unnaturally.
"Exactly," Dean says before pulling the angel into another kiss, this one more passionate than their first, leaving them both breathless before they break apart. "Now let's go before the food gets too cold."
"Or, I can just eat it right now," Vanessa replies, but she doesn't. Instead, she holds her dying fish and Dean's fishing pole as he runs to grab the cooler that he keeps in his car. Once all the beer is removed, Vanessa places the trout in and closes the lid.
"Perfect, I had this whole thing planned, but would you be okay going to a lake and fishing or something along those lines?" Dean's gaze breaks from Vanessa. She watches him lick his dry lips before she answers. "Cause we can do something normal, like a movie or dinner."
"Not really, don't know why," Sam grumbles. Vanessa grabs another mug and fills it up with tea, she moves around the scrambled eggs before handing it to Sam.
As always, if y'all wanna find me and talk to me, I'm on Tumblr at blueberryrock! I don't actually ever use the side blog I made to put up my fics, but I haven't deleted it yet, but go follow me over there and say hi!
Pot in hand, Vanessa brushes past Dean to put the pot in the sunk and rinses it out. Once she's done, she looks him up and down and licks her lips. "C'mon now, Sam is probably reading the books you left and that'll probably take him a while, so we'll have plenty of time, " Vanessa says, biting her lip, walks over to Dean and grabs his hand.
"Well, I was gonna drive us up to a lake house just outside of Dallas, so it's an eight hour to and from so we'll probably stay the night," Dean grabs a steaming of what smells like coffee and brings it up to his lips.
Voices are coming from another room that connects to the first room. They slowly walk towards the voices to find an archway that leads into the kitchen where the whole coven is located. Five witches surround a small bowl on a table, they're chanting something but one of them gets up to grab a cup of what Dean assumes to be the cow blood and one of the victim's hearts.
"Did you know that they can sleep upwards of twenty hours?" Castiel smiles as he watches them. "They hunt mostly at night and the females do all the work even though the male eats first."
"Sure I'll take a few slices" Sam replies as he eats the rest of his apple and tosses it in the trash can, next to the island. Vanessa walks past the table, walks around the island, and towards her fridge. She grabs an egg and heads to her stove, with a snap of her fingers the stove turns on and a pan appears. She quickly grabs a bowl from her cupboard and gets to work. After making at least half a loaf of bread, she splits it between her and Sam and brings it to the table.
"No, like the ones with scales and wings," Vanessa says as she puts her nearly empty bottle on the coffee table and stands up. "How'd you think that got torn off?" She points to the corner of the coffee table that's propped up with books.
"Sounds good, let me go change then we can go," Vanessa says as she walks out of the living room at up the large wooden stairs. As she opens her bedroom door she starts taking her soft t-shirt and pajama pants. She closes the door and throws on a black sports bra, an old AC/DC shirt, and a new pair of leggings that make her legs look great. She quickly grabs a ponytail from her nightstand and starts putting her bright pink hair up in a messy bun.
Dean groggily opens his eyes, finding that he actually feels refreshed, that was probably the best sleep he has ever gotten...he should thank Vanessa for that. Speaking of Vanessa... Dean turns to his side to see Vanessa peacefully sleeping and hogging all the blankets. She made a little cocoon again, Dean leans down and plants a small kiss on her forehead before he turns to sit up.
"Can I have it now?" Vanessa asks, licking her lips hungrily, knowing that her eyes are probably yellow.
"The case is in this city, we had originally thought it was demons with all the cattle deaths and the missing people, but it's actually a small coven of witches killing the cows for blood spells and taking the people for sacrifices" Sam explains as he takes a small drink of his beer.
"Cas, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to blow up on you like that," Dean starts his "shitty" apology. "I was just so anxious about this ever since Sam suggested I invite you, I didn't mean any of it. I'm sorry," Dean finishes, and as soon as he does, he feels like a weight has been lifted from his chest. Although he can feel another one falling in him as he watches the silent angel.
"Be on your best behavior," Dean whispers to Tim, placing his hand on his very warm shoulder, Dean leads him up to the front door.
Vanessa smirks when she feels Dean's hardening member press against her. She leaves little kisses and pushes him upwards until she reaches the hem of his shorts.
"Really?" Vanessa's face starts heating up. Oh shit, Dean doesn't understand what that means to her, if a siren provides for someone and that they're attracted it counts as courting, while she did it yesterday she didn't tell him and pushed down any feeling that came up. While yes, Vanessa did blow him the other day, she has done that too a few people before Dean, but he's one of the few that are very special to her.
Vanessa squints at him again, her fin ears twitch as she clears her throat. "Soorry, goood moorning Deean," she slurs.
Dean nods and looks around for the remote. He grabs it and hits the bed red power button and selects Netflix. He knows that this will not turn into a Netflix and chill kind of thing but rather Netflix and actually relaxing. "You know what's on here," Vanessa hums. "Red vs Blue! Oh wait I think they took it off, but it's on Youtube which I also have up here."
"You don't have to do that Dean," Vanessa places her hands on his hips. "It would be a whole process of me getting dried and that takes forever, I'm sure it'll be better if you let me do this."
"No, we're at a diner," Dean says as he pulls into a parking spot. Dean pulls the keys out of the ignition and steps out of the car. A late spring breeze blows as Dean closes the car door and walks over to help Tim.
They hop in Vanessa's car, with no need to pack any extra weapons, they leave as quickly as possible. Vanessa turns on the radio, humming, and kind of dancing to whatever energetic song came on, while Castiel watches her lovingly from the back seat where his wings won't get in the way.
"We have guests?" An unfamiliar voice says, Vanessa looks at the girl. Her honey-colored hair is pulled into a high ponytail, her hazel eyes scan Castiel and Vanessa, Sarah has a small smile and paint all over her face ranging in different vibrant colors.
Or if Dean just had manned up and asked the angel out instead, it would have been fine too. Dean rubs his face tiredly, if he hadn't overreacted this would have worked out just fine.
Dean sighs, he opens the door and slides out of his baby, walking around to grab the groceries in the trunk, Dean shuffles through the bunker door and starts down the stairs.
Vanesa opens her eyes with a gasp, the aching in her chest from the dream is still there. While she knows it's probably around midnight, her bedroom looks as clear as day thanks to one of her sirens abilities.
She slowly moves her hand up and down the length of his shaft, twisting ever so slightly and she draws out a low moan from him.
"What'd I miss?" Dean asks as he steps past Tim, whose eyes are glued to the screen, and slides into his recliner and takes a sip of his new beer.
"Sounds good," Castiel nods, not tearing his gaze away from his creation. Dean turns to the angel, he's never seen such pure bliss on his face before, and if they were on a date (which they are totally not) Dean would shower him with compliments on his smile and the way his eyes seem to crinkle when he does smile...
But that's one reason why she loves the southern states, the summers get so hot that you can cook an egg on the sidewalk and she has reasons to stay home most of the time. Weeks after her sister's brutal death, Vanessa refused to stay anywhere remotely cold, which is why she had a house built in the south that still stands today.
Hello beautiful people, I'm back with another chapter! This one will be a bit short and somewhat of a filler chapter, but the next one will be quite interesting! Enjoy <3
"We have weapons in the car," Sam says, not wanting to move in case he angers the still purring Pluto.
Vanessa skips towards her kitchen where Sam is currently getting everything set up. "I have everything ready, I just grabbed some random bowl" Sam states as he starts putting the ingredients in the bowl, then he dumps all the blood that's in the vial into the bowl and stirs it all together.
For such a large zoo the gift shop is on the smaller side, which isn't much of a shocker considering that there are multiple around the park. And it's packed with families with little kids.
"And the case in Texas the victims were killed in locked rooms with no signs of someone breaking in over two months and the third was hanged from a flagpole," Sam says before Dean adds "so a ghost? That's easy enough."
"Sorry, they don't take the bacon off," Vanessa says as she puts the burger in front of Dean and puts down her food. She starts passing everyone their beers before she sits down but someone rudely bumps into her making her spill hers and Dean's beer all over her dress, but it bounces off and splatters all over the floor. She closes her eyes in anger and turns around to confront the person.
"It's adorable Dean," Vanessa coos as she flips it around. It's the mother of dragons shirt that he found, he knew she would like it but he had doubts.
"Morning Sam, want some eggs?" Vanessa asks before adding "I'll be making crumb cake too." With a snap of her fingers, the bottle of rat poison disappears before Sam can notice.
"Sure, were-witches. Nasty son's a bitches too, they kept pelting me with rocks and all kinds of hex bags, made me see rainbows the next day" she says as she smiles at the memory.
"Somewhat" Vanessa shrugs as she continues to mix in the seasoning. She leans over the pot and takes a deep whiff of it and sighs. Dean stands up straight to look into the pot, the boiling redish water with the gray salmon scales and the gross slimy calm guts that Dean helped squish and unshell. The smell alone is starting to make Dean nauseous, but he's smelled worse.
"I like all of them, but if I'd have to narrow it down, I'd say yellow." Vanessa shrugs. "Like a nice easter yellow or a yellow daylily color."
Tim grabs the straw between his fingers and twirls it. "Tear the top off," Sam says before he tears into his salad. Tim does as Sam says and turns it upside down, letting the straw slide out. Dean swallows down a bite of fries and plops the straw in the chocolate milk and takes a sip.
"Here we are." Dean closes his door. The bright early sun warms him as he and Castiel start heading for the entrance.
"At least you like bacon! I once dated a vegan girl, well we didn't really date, only went out twice, but she was one of the vegans who made their cat vegan too," Dean says before adding. "I hate those kinds of people."
"Thank you? Did you spend this time exploring my house?" Vanessa asks with a small smile as she takes another bite.
"Well if you're going for the big boys like a Phytosaur then yeah, but most of Texas was underwater when the dinosaurs roamed so it won't be that hard," Vanessa glances back up to Dean, his face is a feeble shade of red, probably from putting so much energy in to keep afloat, Vanessa couldn't imagine not being able to breathe underwater.
Dean scans over the bottom of the exhibit to find a massive snake coiled under a light. "Wow," Dean whistles when he lays his eyes on the snake. "That's fucking huge."
"You made those?" Dean gasps as he watches the cobra lift his head and glance over at the squealing children to their right.
Dean now watches in horror as the person breaks apart into pieces. The biggest piece looks just like a normal human being, Dean watches it comes closer to the earth and he feels the ground beneath him quake as it makes contact. Thankfully it didn't land at the campsite, just nearby.
They pause their interesting discussion as the sound of growling grows loud. "Sounds like Sam's back," Vanessa runs out of the kitchen to greet him.
"Cas, look, there's a little baby." Dean leans on the railing separating them and the fence, and points to a small gray chick. His fluffy feathers make him look adorable in Dean's eyes.
"Thanks for the help Dean," Sam grumbles as he pushes his legs off the coffee table and sits next to him.
Dean takes his seat and sandwich next to Vanessa as Sam comes shuffling into the kitchen and takes his seat next to Vanessa. "I expected Cas to be back by now, " Dean says taking a big bite of his delicious sandwich. After the first few bites, he realizes how hungry he is, which is a relief that the potion is working wonders.
Curiosity bubbles inside him as he realizes that he is only a few feet away, he could just slowly peel back the blankets to see what she grabbed or he could just leave and complete his goal of wrapping her presents.
"Hey doofus, watch where you're going" she growls at the person, the person's deep laugh makes everyone but Vanessa nervous.
"Sounds great, when would we go?" Vanessa asks excitedly. The mention of fish gives her stomach something to growl over.
I wonder just how many of y'all caught my reference lol, hint hint, it's the thing about the lumberjacks! Also, the thing about the Platypus is true! I learned it from my brother!
Dean slowly blinks and stifles a small yawn, last night was exciting, so exciting that no one but Tim could sleep. Part of it was Dean didn't want to die in his sleep, which he didn't, and he got maybe two hours, three at most. But as much as Sammy offered to drive, Dean refused and said he's fine. Which he is.
Vanessa cuts Dean off. "Dean, I have a car, I am currently loading it, I know how to fucking drive Dean, you don't need to come and get me, I'll be fine."
"Oh trust me I do, but isn't my turn to return the favor?" Dean grins, his nose nearly bumping into Vanessa's.
"Really?" Castiel looks Dean in the eyes. His gorgeous blue eyes watch his every move with precision.
"Are you watching?" Dean tries to push the wing out of his face but his fingers sink into the downy feathers. All Dean can hear is Sam laughing, which Dean wonders what this looks like for him, then a large splash and Castiel finally moves his wing to find Vanessa is in the pool.
"But I found something cool, and you can keep it if you want," Vanessa hands Dean the rock with the tooth embedded in it.
Dean sighs, glancing down to his plate, stabbing a piece of his pancake, not wanting to admit that his brother's right. "Fine. Whatever."
Vanessa nibbles a delicate part of his neck, drawing out another moan, and sinks her free hand into the soft feathers that are wrapped around her entire body. Castiel's long feathers brush against her thighs and some even manage to make their way past the waistband of her pajama shorts and they don't go any further
"Dean wait," Sam follows after him. Dean weaves his way through the dense forest, over fallen logs and rocks, and in between trees.
"I'll take a cup of coffee," Dean replies, yawning as Vanessa lets the cupboard slam close as she grabs the coffee pot.
"That was saving our lives" Vanessa replies, she pulls her arm towards her chest and the knife flies back at her, but into her hand instead.
Dean shivers as Vanessa drags her tongue across the hem. "Nessie," he moans, Vanessa starts to tug his shorts down when Dean tries to flip them, but nobody is willing to admit that Vanessa did most of the work.
"Of course, don't want to distract you any more than I already have," Castiel nods as he straightens out in his seat. "Thank you for a wonderful first date."
"I'll have to take you up on that" Vanessa says flirtatiously, "I wanted to make it up to you by not calling, " she says tracing a heart on Dean's cold thigh "but it'll have to wait"
He falls onto the ground as Vanessa jumps on him, pinning his arms with her legs and she stabs him in the throat and turns the blade. She pulls it out and saws off his head. Vanessa sighs as she stands up and wipes the blood off on his shirt.
Castiel beams at the compliment, his face turning all shades of red. "Thank you, Dean," his voice going even lower from the compliments.
"Ugh," Dean tries to sit up, but he manages to prop himself onto his elbows. He rubs his tired face with one hand, fragments of his dream come back to him as well as the now very low humming in his head. "Vanessa?" He croaks.
Dean opens his mouth to reply with his request, but his mouth goes dry. Her now pale coffee-colored brown eyes gleam in the afternoon light. "I-uh," Dean manages to say, Vanessa watches him and crosses her legs. "Wanted to know if it would be okay with you if I stayed in your room with you." Dean swallows the lump in his throat.
Vanessa pauses to listen to the guy on the phone, Dean watches as she slowly frowns. "I'm working on it, she'll be de-" she gets cut off.
And honestly, Dean doesn't mind. As much as he was dreading going to the zoo alone with Castiel, it feels natural and Dean's happy, really happy.
They wander around the building looking at the rest of the animals, Dean stands in front of the jellyfish, mesmerized by them floating in a circle colored by the changing rainbow lights, until Castiel grabs Dean's hand and pulls him away.
Most of the gifts that Dean got her are shirts, which he hopes that she doesn't mind, Dean has gotten her quite a few.
"You could come with us if we take one of the cases in Arizona, it shouldn't take more than a week?" Dean says. Vanessa pauses, if it's less than a week, it might not be a horrible idea to go, but she does have to get started on her bounty.
"I'm glad I'm one of those people," Dean says, "i-if you wanna do that scenting thing or whatever, I don't care."
"Voila!" She says as she puts it in front of Sam, with another snap of her fingers, her male syrup bottle appears between them.
Dean groans, wiping his sweaty face, he throws the blankets off of him, feeling like he's been on a roller coaster, he crawls to his feet, letting a quiet groan slip out. "I'm fine Cas, you just scared me."
"Now, let's get you outside" Dean turns Vanessa around and grips her shoulder, trying not to accidentally brush against her neck.
"Yes, there is an old family remedy that works, but I usually just sleep in the pool until the full moon" Vanessa sighs, fiddling with her hair instead of scratching her legs.
Dean grabs the angel's wrist and drags him out of the building. "Why the fuck did you say that?" Dean growls, staring directly into the angel's blue eyes. "Do you even know what a date is?"
"Why would I persuade you? I am the hatchday girl, you'll make what I say!" Vanessa lightly pushes him.
"Yes. I am very proud of this one. Didn't mean to make it so venomous or long, but everyone seemed to like it." Castiel watches as the cobra slithers his way over to them. "They are gorgeous, I could stand here all day and watch them."
"Somewhat" she mutters as they exit the house. They walk towards the impala, still buzzing from the hunt, and deciding on what to do to celebrate.
"What if she isn't home," Sam says. Dean shrugs and parks the Impala, or Baby, underneath the birch tree and turns her off. "Then we'll just wait," Dean says as he exits the Impala and groans at the heat.
"I'm sure we'll see them soon enough, it'll be nice to see how they act after billions of years," Castiel says, pushing off of the railing. "Let's continue."
"You have to find at least five to win, and if I win, you have to, hmm, go on a hunt with me and Sam."
Dean drums his fingers on the armrest of the couch as he watches the minutes slowly go by. It was currently five in the morning, almost six, but no one was awake beside him and Castiel. Castiel had decided he had things he needs to attend to so he left, but that was hours ago, Dean had spent all night not being able to sleep from almost being a vampire and reading at least a quarter of the books Vanessa owns.
"No. He couldn't have made all of them, there are billions of animals, alive and extinct," Castiel explains, his gaze also not moving from the wolves.
"I have heard of it and collected the ingredients for it just in case, but we'll need the vamp who turned him's blood," Vanessa says as she runs a hand through her tangled hair. "Do you know how many are there?"
"Helping you, you said that I turned you on by touching your wings, sooo I don't wanna leave you hanging when it's your first time having someone else touchin' your wings," Vanessa pauses unbuttoning. "Unless you don't want me to of course."
He turns to the other one and slowly opens it, he peeks inside to find that the room is completely dark and someone is sleeping in the bed.
Sam nearly folds the t-shirt and places it next to the other shirt as Vanessa throws the paper on the coffee table and grabs the last present.
"Ready to go?" He asks. Tim nods and stands, adjusting the sweat pants as Dean leads him to the Impala. "Now this is Baby be gentle, we're gonna drive you to our home," Dean opens the back door for Tim. "Get in."
Vanessa snaps her fingers and from what Dean can tell, the shirt becomes instantly dried. "So–" Vanessa rubs her hands together, "–where were we?"
"Well, umm, let's get you out of here," Dean motions to where Sam is standing, all the way at the top. The man follows his gaze and nods.
"How'd you know?" Dean chuckles, his laugh carries over the quiet lake. "How many siblings do you have?"
"I may not be your brother," Dean starts and pulls Vanessa into his chest, filling her nose with his woodsy scent. "But I'll never forget it."
"That's fucking awesome! I would kill for something like that, watching Blue Planet has made me want to swim with whale sharks since I first saw them," Dean exclaims, his green eyes seem to spark with excitement.
"I've missed you too, I'm glad I came a day earlier. If it was entirely up to me we would've been here a week ago," Dean says.
"Okay, now, hand me the salmon scales and the wooden spoon, " Vanessa says as she throws an herb into a tall pot that's on the stove.
"You ready?" Dean asks, shooting her a grin. Vanessa nods and turns to her dragon egg. "I've gotta set this up in incubation and we can eat here then go," Vanessa says as she scoops up the pink egg in her arms, holding it securely to her chest.
Vanessa groans and rubs her tired eyes. "Lir, it's like, two in the morning, why didn't you call at eight or somethin'," Vanessa grumbles and turns to face the barely awake Dean.
"Alright, hand me a towel," Vanessa watches Dean bound off to the cabin, she looks down at her lower half, now she regrets going swimming.
"This one's from me" Sam pulls it towards Vanessa. "Oh thank you. You boys didn't have to get my anything, I would've been happy just watchin' a movie," Vanessa says appreciatively. She slowly pulls out the tissue paper.
The sun blinds Vanessa for a couple of seconds as she follows Dean down to the docks. "You're not gonna push me into the water, are you?" Vanessa asks as she scans the lake. It's a very large lake, a few houses are scattered around it, but they are so far away that Vanessa isn't worried. Thank the seas that this dock has a roof, they'll be swimming in about twenty minutes if it didn't have one.
"I've gotta ask," Dean says as they walk to a tank filled with turtles in it. "How many snakes did Lucifer make?" He made sure to whisper the last part to him.
"No," Sam shakes his head, grabbing one of the books from Dean's small pile. "And Bobby still hasn-" Dean's phone buzzes in his pocket, making him jump in his chair. "Speak of the devil," Sam grumbles as Dean fishes the buzzing phone out of his pocket.
"I've never been able to taste the difference between turkey bacon and real bacon, but that is probably just me," Daniel shrugs and turns the stove off. "Plus it's healthier, less fat."
Dean searches for his keys for only a minute, when he finds them he immediately heads for the front door and then towards his baby.
The sun high in the sky bathes the whole kitchen in light. With her back turned to him, Dean's heart flutters when she pushes the jumping dragons out of the way and turns around.
So I think this will update every two weeks, but if anything happens, you can find me on Tumblr at blueberryrock!
And Dean knew it was his fault, if he didn't send Sam to deal with the monsters and gotten captured, everyone would have been alive. But no, Sam got hurt real bad and Dean had to pay for it, those girls had to pay for it.
Vanessa sits in the office chair and sighs her eyes start filling with tears, she overreacted at breakfast all because of the mention of a...the creature. Vanessa should be over it by now, it's been years since the incident and she is still sensitive about it. And they never said that they would actually take that job, damn it, she ruined it.
"He apparently had errands to run, he said he'll be back when everyone wakes up, " Dean says while scratching his chin "not sure what kind of errands an angel has but he'll be back soon"
Dean pushes the chair back and leaps from his chair. The last thing he hears is Daniel asking Castiel a question about his feathers and something about a spell as Dean quickly speeds up the stairs.
“You’re supposed to say ‘thank you’! But damn, I’m… eating you from here on! You’re so big! I feel so full but pull out a little and—dammit I want to see your face!”
” Dean said eagerly, almost petulantly, “Because you’re making me itchy. Making my insides burn just seeing you… You make me remember things… You make me want to hear you scream while I carve angel sigils on your body and let you writhe in pain and I’d laugh while fucking you. I’ll slam you on the floor and get high on your blood leaving your body…That… that gives me a thrill, you get, angel? But you won’t die… and I get to do it all over again because right now…you’re a temptation in that vessel, something I can see a break. If you let me just touch you… while you try to burn me away, I’d like to see you try and hurt this body, I’ll even recommend it. It wants pain as it wants you…
Dean chuckled and faced Cas behind him, body flushed against each other, fingers trailing at each other’s skin as warm water sprinkle above them. The glass cab started to moisten, and Dean thought Castiel always kissed so deliberately as to arouse him.
An eagle flew above. Castiel squinted. He planned to return before breakfast but he could not see the gates of CALS at all. He checked his watch and pursed his lips. There was no way he could make it back before the first-year orientation. He looked behind him to the thick woods. That’s when he saw a sign of
“I keep my words, Cas. Your house will be cat-proof and burglar-proof once I’m done with it.” It was food for thought Castiel kept to himself until Dean was finally satisfied with the brand knew doorknob. Inviting Dean, he led Dean to the living room (“But I look really dirty, I can remove my jumper— “, “Dean, I think one naked guy in a week should be enough for the both of us,” he countered, spying a smirk on the handsome guy’s face). He checked the clock then brought some soda from the fridge, careful to avoid the beers. There was no reason to show Dean another side of him when the handyman had met his low-blood, evil morning persona. Besides, Dean was driving. Castiel hated to think of him getting into unnecessary accidents.
The bed creaked. Cas grinned smugly much to Dean's pain, but he took him all in. The rattling sound of the bed fills his hazy mind with the force of their bodies in synch. Not to brag, but Cas is huge. It took Dean awhile to let him in with all that preparation which he was too impatient until Cas did something, he did... and Dean took him all in.
“I know your age. I know you have a lawyer for a younger brother. I also know your dental records, if that helps. In short, I have acquired the necessary information from your previous doctors. I don’t know what you think of me, but I am just doing my job.”
“Yes. To terrorize you.” Dean couldn’t see his husband’s face but the way Castiel’s body just stiffened, he knew the bomb squad officer was very displeased.
Castiel has had sex before, but with a man, it was completely different. Dean was able to reach inside him that no woman ever had. The way he thrust with such vigor and intent, the way his mouth and tongue salivated to eat him whole and raw. The thickness of his cock got bigger and bigger as they did it for another hour. The only guy who could rearrange his insides and burn flames under his skin. In the silence of the mountains, Castiel only heard the creaking bed, the slapping of skin and the rich moaning of their voices. The marks that Dean left, the bruises all over his chest, all were the evidence Castiel needed to remember and affirm this was not a dream.
“I'm nervous, my legs won’t stop shaking,” Charlie admitted as they waited for their turn with Dean and the more experienced seniors showed them the proper ways of jumping the hurdles. Castiel watched Dean attentively. He was really good. There were no errors on the hurdle jump and he looked so happy. Castiel aimed for that too. He had progressed well with practices; he was sure he could nail it. But at the end of the day, Baby would just stop before the hurdle and refuse to jump.
"Well, Sam and Eileen left an hour ago to check a case. They left a note on the library table for you so maybe..." his question hang in the air, biting his bottom lips, eyes fully interested in the angel's plush ones.
He was introduced later to two more first years from another class who joined the Equestrian club. One was named Kevin, a boy genius from what he heard, and the other one a carefree person with one of the nicest airs around her, Charlie Bradbury. But like every new club member, they were assigned to the hellish cleaning and removing of the manure in the stable houses.
Castiel didn’t ask, he pulled Dean in an embrace. It was what he wanted from the very beginning. The connection was set and Dean wrapped his arms under Cas’ elbow, trying to balance because he was still kneeling in front of the angel.
How attractive Castiel looked, how sexy and hot that was beyond measure, no wonder people kept staring. But this was his Cas and he was more than the vessel. This was the Castiel that stuck with him till the end, never have imagined they would both survive it. Now they’re here…
"Ummm…" Castiel inclined his head on one side before walking after the hunter again, "no problem. I will take care of your shirt, Dean. This is my next favorite wardrobe next to the trench coat.”
“So, we’re fine as we are. I mean, we both make each other happy as early as now so I’m thinking that’s a good foundation. And we just work hard on the farm and if that doesn’t sound suitable to you anymore, you can always… you know, ditch farm duties. Just not the Dean.” Dean shrugged as he ate his dinner.
Next thing he knew, it was Friday. Their next subject was making them view a slaughterhouse video. Their teacher did say those who want to watch it may proceed in the multimedia room. And those who could not stay and take their lunch. There were a bunch of his classmates left behind and as Castiel listened to their reasons, it had him considering his choice even more.
Dean visibly froze. He locked eyes with the doctor and there was no judgment there. He did see a flicker of interest but he piped down his horn. He remembered what Sam said. Was it his fault the doctor stirred his loins?
“D-don’t take this the wrong way. I know we have a deal—I—I’m really looking forward to it, but you don’t get to do this stuff. I-it’s confusing. I’m not a girl. I don’t need you to make me feel special—if that’s what you’re doing. I don’t need it.”
"D-do as you like," the hunter said, walking away as he covered his face with his hand, "but make sure you bring that shirt with you."
“FBI analyst would be Charlie. Dammit— she knows plenty of my secrets for blackmail. You’re going there professionally, right, babe?”
Castiel let out the air he didn’t think he was holding and just grabbed Dean back, clawing at his flannel, wanting nothing but to feel him nearer and buried his face in the crook of Dean’s neck. The pain all melted the way Dean pulled him deeper into the embrace, whispering his name like a prayer and Castiel was forever healed. It was comforting, it cleared his head having Dean on his arms and he basked in it. He would never love anyone the way he loved Dean.
Dr. Novak paused then gave a nonchalant shrug. “That may be my poor lack of judgment. A self-indulgence.”
“Oh, I’ve always wanted to try this.” Dean rubbed his hands and nodded at the personnel. “We’re trying one. You want to, right? Unless you want to take the wheels?”
Dean felt the sun burning his bare shoulder. He wondered if Castiel didn’t feel anything considering he was only wearing his beach shorts and nothing else to protect his body, but then that’s probably one of the perks of being an angel. Castiel who was beside him under the same shade of the colorful large umbrella with a deadpan on his face.
Dean’s face contorted madly. “You idiot!” Dean was on his face in a few steps, breathing angrily, “I told you we’ll come here together! Do you know how dangerous it is around here especially at night? There are many bears here, Cas! What if they got to you before I found you!”
Castiel stared at the locked door of Gas n Sip. The lights were all off, there was no one inside. He looked around him but the station was empty, Dean left minutes ago and probably driving home…
“That’s not it! You were hurt—it’s because of me! I know I must’ve done something worse the other nights! I’d wake up with my knuckles and elbows sore—I know I must be hitting something but I’m not bruised in any way! And then you—” he looked back at the doctor with tears welling up his eyes.
“It’s unique and cute,” Dean watched Cas hang around the ice cream line with Jack talking animatedly beside him. “Cas liked it, right?”
"DAMN YOU, Winchester! Hogging all the beautiful people!” muttered some envious team members and Dean couldn’t tell if they were jesting.
Dean turned to Castiel and stopped mid-sentence. Castiel had never really properly looked at the face still covered with the mask, but with goggles off, he saw the gem that was his eyes. Dean stared back at him, suspended there with his face almost the level of the fluorescent light Castiel distinctly saw his pupils dilate, expanding to the emerald ring as it fell on him. The mixture of awe on his expression didn’t escape the accountant who was left wondering why for a second until he became conscious of his appearance. He had just come out of the bathroom with really wet hair, not to mention—
“Are you supposed to be one of those wise barmen who preaches because he’s seen too much face in the crowd’ kinda guy?”
"Yeah, just a little beaten but I can move my legs, see?" to prove his point, he stood up. He really didn't need any assistance but there was Dean holding tight beside him.
“Here,” Dean threw a pillow in his direction which he caught aptly. Dean settled beside him, two pillows, and a blanket at hand.
The voice came from above and Castiel sighed in relief. Craning his neck to get a better view, what he saw took his breath away. If this was a painting, this man would be the muse in the middle. If this was a fairy tale, he was certainly the prince. Behind the horse was a face he thought he’d only see in movies. He had clean-cut chestnut hair under a cowboy hat, his greenest of eyes matching the shimmering leaves basking in the morning sunlight with his little sunspot freckles that added beauty to his unmatched perfection. He was a sight to behold, an oasis to dry land. Castiel managed to stop his mouth from hanging, but he certainly didn’t stop looking.
“Well, that’s just how it is. The teachers are the ones doing the monitoring and if you’re not in the place you’re supposed to report you’ll automatically receive a red card. Three cards and you’re expelled.”
“Dean, I’m here- I’m—” Castiel choked, cheeks tear-streaked. He wanted to be with Dean so bad. He wanted to fix it, he wanted to embrace him, apologize and see that he wasn’t left behind again— he needed to make Dean see—wanted to keep Dean safe— make him smile and protect him forever.
Castiel blinked, decided against responding before closing the door. He tried not to show Dean what was bothering him when he turned around. Dean's instantly brightened.
Castiel’s vision blurred and all he could do was to pray in Dean’s name as the Mark throbbed on his arm.
He moaned against Castiel’s kiss and rolled their bodies so he was on top of this time. The angel stared back at him with blue eyes so round and blown so Dean enjoyed the view. Packed muscles, full mound, toned in places Dean just wanted to kiss. How on earth he got the angel on the bed, he's sure he'll go to hell for it. But it's Cas fault looking at him that way, like Dean's everything he wished for served on a silver platter.
“Yes! Thank you for setting it up,” silence followed his words. He glanced just in time to see Dean still just watching him. Like he wanted to say something looking somber like that. Castiel stopped and would've touched Dean's cheek if he was near.
Growling, Castiel began undoing his buttons, Dean not shying away from the strip show his friend is providing, not entirely feeling guilty of the slight reaction it caused his nether regions because as far as he was concerned, he’s always reacted when Castiel does something.
Castiel’s ears pinged. Years on earth, he knew what it meant. And Dean was allowing him. But he knew Dean better and sometimes questions needed to be asked.
Gabriel ignored them both. “The Feds will take charge of him and consider this a terrorist situation. When we told him about it, he sounded genuinely concerned. But when we asked him about the guy who hired him, he was completely terrified. When we showed him the of Cartwright, he was downright readable. It’s Cartwright alright.”
“It’s an arranged thing with our parents but we’ve met up a lot during the school break. She’s studying in another school. She kept saying I’m her lucky charm because I got accepted into this school.”
“Don’t smile at me, you’re having fun at me fumbling,” Dean growled as he nipped at Castiel’s lips and tugged on the angel’s neck tie again, “Do you even know how to do it with me?”
It took about thirty minutes before the cages were closed and all chickens were in. Castiel could feel cold sweat sticking on his back as he and Inias met up with the sophomores who were grateful for their help.
It was a very good lunch that Dean was stretching his arms with a belly full once out of the restaurant. Jack is eyeing the ocean innocently, Castiel right behind him when Dean turned to Sam.
"It's a compliment, dammit, move!" Castiel sank to him with vigor relieving the memory of the show. "Shit, next time we watch it together!"
Dean’s eyes bulged as he whined in shock and let out a shaky breath. He bucked up against the touch as orgasm hits him, exploding his release everywhere on the bed with his body trembling as the doctor stroked him to it but he didn’t remember the rest as darkness consumed him. All he remembered was a deep voice whispering in his ear.
“You’re too damn hot, I can’t help myself. The moment my eyes fell on you I wanted you so bad, Cas.”
“S-shut up. You—you’re—” Dean swallowed whatever he was about to say when his gaze fell on the angel’s pants. “You want help on that?”
By the time the ‘Dean-Cure’ worked, the food needed reheating and then Castiel was pulling him up in their bedroom the second he finished washing the dishes.
“Alright, make sure you help out, Inias.” Gadreel crossed his arms, “Castiel’s already tutoring someone from class and now he’s helping out at other people’s expense. He’s sure a busy guy.”
“Wanted the ace already?” laughed Drake. Garth nudged his elbow and nodded at Castiel. Dean drew the attention back to himself. Cas didn’t look as angry as he looked a while ago but he certainly didn’t seem happy.
Dean left Castiel with the latter’s mouth hanging open. Had Dean turned around, he would have found Castiel all flustered and bright red in the face. He left Dean to his devices and stayed in the living room where his laptop is open to finish the report he was typing before the handyman came. He could hear Dean from the kitchen, knew when Dean crossed the hall to get to the front door and then returning from his impala carrying his tools.
Dean looked up and saw a man blonde man with deep gray eyes staring at the sleeping angel with wide glinting eyes. He was holding a camera in his hand and as if in a trance—he started to raise it to take a shot of the sleeping angel but then—
He closed the doorknob and missed the meaningful look Nora threw in his direction. “Is there anything else you wish for me to do before my shift is over?”
Dean glanced at Castiel who was staring out the ocean with squinting eyes like everything was right in the world when he noticed the hunter staring.
“Can’t keep the sheet wobbling, it’ll pop out the screws. So, where do you think this god-awful smell is coming from?”
“I don’t know him. His brother had become obsessed with me, he was possessive and when I tried breaking up, he became a stalker. That’s why I’m so relieved when he was caught—”
Then Dean leaned back and rolled his hips aiming to take him deeper. Castiel gasped in pleasure. But then Dean’s movements demanded mounting up Cas’ chest, almost letting Castiel’s cock to slip out— before slamming back down. Castiel lost the ability to think as Dean did it twice and thrice in arrow. It was as if Dean believed Castiel would never let him fall. The angel groaned and came apart at the slide of his cock at the precious tight heat, as if Dean was plotting to really make him a quivering moan of mess. Remembering he was the one who promised Dean pleasure, Castiel took hold of Dean’s hips tightly before slamming back and pounding deeper into the hunter. The sound Dean made were the memories Castiel will bury in his eardrums and the song he’d like to revisit every time he slipped into his nirvana. He was leaving his mark all over Dean’s body, leaving the memories here at the very dungeon that left too many painful memories for Dean. Now erasing all of that and changing them with something pleasurable to look back into and happiness filled the angel.
“Then what I promised…?” Dean began stiffly. Castiel glared at Amara because she wouldn’t take Dean, right? After everything she said—?
“Don’t be ridiculous, you’re my patient, not a housekeeper,” Castiel said firmly when he found him in his study. Dean was so glad he was there when he woke up after a short rest on the couch. “I take it, you resigned from your previous job?”
“Dean.” Dean nearly choked at the deep voice that called his name. He slowly turned around him and found his husband giving him a very dark look. “In your office. Now.”
“I’d really want to, but you should eat. I’m not here to eat everything you have. Well, maybe I am, but it’s too early in the day—”
Dean’s heart raced. It was Cas. Dean embraced him tight, fear melting into the abyss. Cas was here. Things will be okay.
“Or we really don’t have time to fill around, not even by choice,” Dean shrugged. Castiel looked at everyone around him. These are all just college students, no—even when they were in high school, these people had been doing their best. Castiel thought students here are mostly concerned about their future because it's what they needed to do for their parents. Just like him. What made his situation different from anyone else?
Of all the excuses. Do you remember you brought down heaven with you for one man? Castiel, you’ve been choosing him ever since you branded him your mark in hell. You really have no choice but to stick with it, y’know.”
Castiel and Dean exchanged looks, making him wish it was morning already so he can bask in Dean’s beauty. He just remembered Dean’s offer yesterday too.
Castiel stayed by the wall and pressed the earphone on his ear wishing Dean would speak and announce his position already. That was when he saw a shadow hiding on one of the containers and aimed a warning shot there. The shadow hid at once and Castiel's eyes glinted in the dark and the exchange of shots happened to the bullet missing his head by an inch. He took the guy down.
Castiel kissed his nape, a light touch that sent shivers down Dean’s spine, jolting his very excited rod. “Of course I’ll be asking questions. First of which—how do I make sure my lover doesn’t get in the middle of the crossfire with a mad bomb man?”
“I’m saying you really look shit. Maybe Crowley’s after your ass because you look dead and he will kick your ass after some test. Make sure you’re good to have in a closed space with company. What do you have, Dean?”
Frustrated at how his parents only saw his value in grades and exam results, Castiel broke away from the pattern and fled the life he was used to in the city. Yet, the moment he decided to rebel and be free, he found himself lost. Literally, at a vast landscape. Just land, with the sweet smell of green grass and the sound of hawks cawing above the sky. A scene worthy of a painting, except he was stuck in it.
Someone was beside him in seconds. The pain wasn't something he couldn't endure. He could still feel his numb body, but mostly the numbness of seeing something so spectacular from such a height. Castiel didn't know what was happening for a few seconds before green lights covered his vision. Castiel blinked up at Dean. He heard frantic words around, but all he could do was squeeze Dean's arm.
“It’s better in person!” Dean gawked as he dropped the bags on the white sand. It had black plank woods for a pathway that winded with other paths leading to the back of the barn. There were no other lodgings around it except the tall coconut trees as Dean didn’t want to have anyone watching if Castiel accidentally blasted a door using his palm.
. He jolted at the mere thought of his bedroom locked at the far end of the apartment. He had no need for it. So let it go, let it be over, let it be gone, let it pass.
His heart stopped beating when he recognized it. It was Billy. He wanted to check on him but his feet wouldn't move. He heard feet running in the hallway. There were other people in the mansion. Dean ran and escape the men and hid inside his bedroom when someone slammed a palm on his lips.
“Look at you people drooling after a client. Should we start arranging group dates again?” the thought had him grinning. The last group date he attended arranged by Ash from forensics team was something of a big deal. Dean would never forget it when Castiel joined them out of the blue. Dean was so flustered to see Castiel enter the bar. Safe to say, Dean figured something on his own when both colleagues and waitresses flirt with the bomb squad officer and that was how fucked up it was to not get Cas alone. It was an eye opener to Cas too who admitted he was bothered with escorts surrounding Dean left and right. It was a bittersweet memory.
Dean looked up with Castiel’s cock half in his mouth, green eyes bright. Castiel bit his lips. He caressed his cheeks and to his surprise, the demon leaned on his touch while he licked the head of Castiel’s cock. When he opened his eyes, they were still full green.
Castiel stopped whatever he was doing and gave him a steady gaze which Dean pointedly looked away from. Running his hands up his hair and feeling how wet they were from perspiration before pulling the covers up his naked chest and glanced beside him. Cas looked comfortable on his side of the bed wearing a loose shirt that looked so different from his stiff squad uniform. Dean would be lying to say he never got turned on of his partner in uniform, but Castiel was just as hot without them.
Castiel clenched his teeth. “Please, no matter what happens, don’t take Dean from here. Don’t take him from my arms…”
Dean’s mouth moved but no sound escaped his red lips. With each powerful thrust, Dean moved with his hips as Castiel’s head spun in pleasure and all he could focus was being drawn out and feeling the knot of the heat ready to explode inside his abdomen. Castiel screamed Dean’s name as he threw his head back against the bed, his cock pulsating and spurt all over his chest as Dean continued his miracle work. Hearing his name said with such ecstasy that left Castiel’s mouth open, Dean’s thick length reached its peak and exploded inside Cas, releasing the built-up tension inside his wet hole as a long deep groan ripped through his throat. Castiel embraced him, pressing their lips through Dean’s orgasm. Nobody cared that they were lying on cum, that there were smears of it between their pressed body. Both were more concerned at the thudding heartbeat of the other as they stared hard and intently into each other’s eyes before falling into another dancing trip of long hot kisses.
“Who wants to sneak here after dinner?” Anna said with a sudden determined face. Safe to say, Castiel was not one to rebel on rules, but with Dean’s eager face for trouble, he acquiesced. He couldn’t imagine letting Dean out prowling at night on his own with Anna, anyway. Not by how she kept checking Dean out.
Dean’s body stiffened. Castiel stood by what he said and waited for what he dreaded the most to steal him from Dean’s warmth, but it never came. Castiel sat up straight to find Dean watching him while Amara was staring at something they couldn’t see on the wall. Castiel felt it, the tug of something dangerous lingering by and he took extra measures to really dig Dean back.
“None.” Castiel ended with a smirk. “If anyone’s shown any interest to attack me…” he didn’t finish. Dean suddenly found his hammer appealing.
“Yeah, not the first time I’ve heard about it. The school property is just too vast, thieves can come from any corner since the forest area is open. I heard fugitives used to hide around here in the mountains too.”
“Cats don’t shed furballs,” Castiel slid off the tie and threw it in the trunk too. They stared at each other one with pressed lips, patience thinning, the other pure petulance, and unyielding. Dean raised an eyebrow.
Silence. Dean locked gazes with the doctor who looked so solemn unlike the many therapist who insisted they were right. With a sigh, Dean kept his eyes locked with the doctor.
“How in the world did you ended up like this?” Castiel said as he busily began to unhook the wires from the fiber of the jacket. “Did you get knocked out or something?”
“I… I meant only the school.” Castiel clarified, “If Gavin runs his mouth around, I don’t think you and I will have it peaceful until we graduate—” oh. Did he just think he and Dean could make it to graduation?
The angel manhandled him, their cold naked bodies heat up at every touch and grind. Castiel settled on top of him, the bulge on his front making Dean give a low moan, his aching cock already hard. Castiel nodded before pressing down between his legs and Dean lost it. The sound he made should not be heard by anyone. Castiel kissed him open-mouthed and sickly hot and wet, playing across his jaw, nipping his bottom lips while he grinds and grinds down hard and rhythmically, their voices breaking with curses and each other’s’ names and saying Cas’ name was, to Dean, would really make him so hard and good to scream.
Dean blinked at him and ceased the movement of his hand. Castiel groaned in disappointment but then found his cheeks cupped in Dean’s hand. The hunter distractedly kissed him wholly, slipping in his tongue and swirling with his own, making Castiel shiver pleasantly.
“Bedroom?” Dean asked, pressing their foreheads together, mouth wet from the kissing and Castiel nodded.
"The spell wouldn't have worked if our feelings weren't genuine, Dean..." he began slowly, "And I think... whatever form you were then, the fact that the spellbound us because 'love' prevailed inside you..."
there were more growl of that deep voice that intrigued Castiel more, but his head was aching pretty badly too.
Castiel froze because the sound came from someone so familiar that he was pushing the door open before he knew what he was doing. The dungeon room was dark but to Castiel’s angelic eyes, everything was vivid.
“I know you’re a narcissistic bastard who acts on impulse and threatened a high schooler so that his sister would do as you bid and that’s what? You wanted to show power after realizing we were on to you? You wanted to prove you could get the best of the FBI too, so you took the bait? You were planning to blame this to us? Your little game? Because we expected you to do so, is that it?”
The smile Castiel gave him was the softest, like he enjoyed seeing something in Dean that others will never have the pleasure to have. Dean gasped at the first power stroke and then another. “You like that?”
“Well, it’s true. For most farmer’s sons, being a firstborn is whole baggage especially if said farm is already in debt. I remember my college girlfriend leaving me for the exact same thing,”
“Don’t worry you guys, we’re only going to assign a hectare per student today.” Mr. Campbell assured them, “I’m sure we can cover it before the day ends and then we all can have a barbecue after.”
Castiel understood and felt relieved. He got Dean around the waist, let Dean climb on his legs and wrapped it around the angel’s hips. Castiel was speechless when Dean took the initiative to slip Castiel’s cock back in and then moved his arms around the angel’s neck. The position sent spikes all over Castiel’s back down to his rod deep inside Dean. The way Dean could take him all up was a miracle on its own.
“I’d make a full 380 and make a show just to see that look in your face. I’ve thought about it carefully. You can’t harm me, not with the mark on. So what else is left? You give yourself to me, you’re my demon cake and I want it.”
“This is an impressive pile, “Charlie said with hands on her hips, “The Field Crops department will get rid of this later to use as fertilizer on open areas and pasture fields. It’s just impressive.”
“Mr. Sergei,” Castiel turned an apologetic look to their teacher, “I’m so sorry, but we’re really in need of cheese for the pizza party tomorrow. Weren’t you the one who said the school will help us if we have anything we want to make?”
“Y-you better grab some clothes too, Cas, take a shower before that. It’s almost dinner.” Dean caught Castiel’s gaze on him without moving.
A beat passed. Castiel was sure there was something his brain was trying to tell him and that included not to laugh because it was all—
“J- just kilos,” Castiel bit his lower lip. His heart was thumping in excitement. “With that secured, I think I need to know where we can get cheese—” he turned to Anna expectantly who blinked back at him and gave him a thumbs up. She was, after all, the one who said she wanted to open a cheese shop. Her beaming face said it all.
Their next teacher for food science came in, heard what was being explained about food flavor and started writing on the board as well. Castiel listened aptly to the discussion of the two.
“But you didn’t,” Castiel sighed with his left hand playing across Dean’s chest. “Imagined what I thought when I saw you strapped in that bomb.”
Dean gritted his teeth with a sweat drop sliding down to his chin. Then he calmed his nerves and just looked at Castiel's face. Cas was as tranquil as ever and Dean envied him. Come to think of it, he needed to show the same resolve.
“I’m sorry for leaving you with this work,” Castiel was saying as he wiped his brow with his arm. The glove he was wearing was now very muddy so he removed that too.
Castiel worked on the wires, trying to connect which of the three colors to choose from when Dean touched his hand. Gadreel and Aaron finally made it to them to report, but it was brief. Gabriel also made a call to make the cleanup of both buildings saying he’d leave things in Castiel’s hands. Five minutes to show time, Castiel asked the Alpha team to move back. They didn’t budge away and remained to wait. Castiel did not say anything. Clip at hand, he could just choose any of the wires. One could kill them all.
Then we deal with it, but I don’t think you have to worry about him. I left him in the care of a trusted friend in a place I can only enter.”
“Oh, that was easy. Crowley’s that easy. Speaking of the devil, he was looking for you. Hey, are you listening? I said he’s on the lookout for you.” She brushed past Dean’s locker and shut it close. By doing so, she shoved who Dean nearly lost his balance sideward. He managed to catch himself on time before his knees gave away. That nearly gave him a heart attack knowing he could crash badly. He shouldn’t have gone to work. Glaring at the brunette with lipsticks, Dean grinded his teeth.
“I really thought I was going to get expelled,” Castiel admitted quietly as he watched Dean wrestle Gavin off him.
The sun was too bright that afternoon and the sky too blue, one of the dog days of summer. The cool waves of the ocean were inviting to all the surfers and swimmers around the area.
“Who is he, Cas?” Dean whispered behind Castiel who stared down the plastic bag with the drumstick in his hand.
“Dean, you don’t have to make time for me,” Castiel began a little taken by the gesture but Dean glanced back at him quietly. Castiel hesitated at the silence. Dean just looked at him, studying his face to the point Cas became self-conscious but before he could say anything else, Dean shook his head.
“We could arrange for another set of eyes. She’s already under surveillance from the beginning.” Gabriel pressed his knuckles on his lips looking thoughtful. Dean noticed the lawyer and Abaddon exchange another meaningful look before turning to the officers.
“Wow…and you still think he’s not bad after calling him a demon?” the surprised brown eyes had Castiel squinting but before he could say anything else, someone jerked the hand away from his back. Castiel turned and there was the man he was looking for, clad in his favorite red shirt, green eyes glinting in secret spite, twisting the gasping man’s arm up the air.
“That’s not gonna be a problem.” Castiel whispered next to his ear and “I’ll hold tight.” He promised.
“It will be alright, Dean. The way you slept last night was so soundly, I didn’t even have the heart to wake you up from your slumber.”
“Ready for battle too, huh?” Dean’s muffled voice was still deep and strong behind his white mask. Castiel squinted. So maybe Dean is more professional than he thought to be wearing his equipment at this early stage, or the man came from another work. In any case, he nodded.
Castiel snapped his eyes up to the corner of the room and felt a surging heat on his mark. He gasped when the dark corner began to form into a slender silhouette of a woman, a familiar lady in lively night maroon dress. Castiel couldn’t find words to say.
Dean listened as Castiel washed his face in the bathroom of the small office. They both didn’t say anything after the AFT team got there and Cas got his bomb gear good enough to disarm it. By the end of it, Cas had fallen in silent reverie, only exchanging a few words once the content of the improvised bomb was done.
“Yeah, we get around a week’s break so we can also help in our family field. But some students stay too, like me, I’ll be staying to take care of the horses. In your case you can go home to your family so you don’t miss them.”
Castiel held him fast. "Of course, it only needed one joining of the body, but... you were persistent. Did you notice how you're more susceptible to follow my command?"
“We told you before, it doesn’t matter anymore in these rural parts, what others say. And even in this school. We may live our lives in the countryside, Cas, it doesn’t mean we know less when it comes to same-sex relationships. Some parents might still be prejudiced about it, heck my dad was brutal when Sam called on the phone and talked about his boyfriend—”
They don't even bother to look at the exhibit next to the eagle, instead, they make their way towards the next big area.
"Ah shit. I've gotta make breakfast," Vanessa slaps a hand on her face but doesn't move out of bed. "And dad left yesterday."
Vanessa scowls and she walks back up the steps and into her room. She quickly turns the shower on and sets it as hit as it can go. As it heats up she quickly grabs a towel and a clean pair of pajamas.
"See like that," he says, setting the cup in front of Tim, Dean turns back to his plate and continues where he left off. Tim mirrors Dean and takes a sip of his drink, his eyes going wide when he swallows down the milk.
"If you say so," Dean starts up episode one and smiles when Vanessa quotes in the character's voices. They get through the first couple of episodes before Vanessa snuggles into him and sighs. He does the same and hits the next episode.
Dean glances over at him and bites his lip. "Uh, this zoo has tigers, polar bears, elephants, and stuff like that."
"You look like a mess," Sam says. She looks up at him, her browns eyes seem to be eerily glowing yellow in the dark.
Anger bubbles in Dean's stomach at what Vanessa said, is she being serious? She can't be...she did come in here basically unarmed, except for her little knife. Why would Bobby trust her enough for him to suggest them to seek her out?
After a few long minutes of Castiel chanting sweet nothings into her ear, she slowly falls back asleep in Castiel's strong arms. She dreams of nothing as she hears him hum some song.
"Your gums sore? Yeah, mine were when my fangs grew in too, unfortunately, you will lose yours, I still have mine." Vanessa states with a small smile.
The large man grunts and touches his now bleeding lip and walks away muttering. The three of then slide into their seats as Sam lets out a low whistle as Vanessa looks down at her still warm food. "Thanks, Dean" she looks up at him and smiles. Dean would've smiled right back at her and would've slightly blushed, but both Dean and Sam flinch back as they stare into her now yellow eyes.
"It's okay," Castiel says, he pulls her into him and wraps his large inky black wings around her. Vanessa turns into his chest and starts crying into his clean suit jacket. He pets her hair as she continues to cry.
The hours go by in a blur, they take a quick break to refill on gas and snacks, then it's back to joking around and singing every song that comes on; Dean even sings some pop songs with Vanessa.
"I was looking around then got distracted by these," Castiel turns to the stand, grabbing one of the necklaces from its branch. "It's a cobra, a king cobra perhaps." Castiel hands it to Dean to examine.
These chapters will probably be as long as this one, I hope y'all don't mind but I find writing them really fun.
"Alright, let's finish our drinks then head out," Bobby says. As soon as he said that, something large and heavy throws its self at a door.
"Yes. They are very aggressive, but they are a vital pollinator. Now let's see the next one," Castiel grabs Dean's hand this time making him blush, but thankfully nobody can see from the dim lights.
"Hey back off you two, " an unfamiliar voice says behind the door, they unlock it and swing it open.
After about an hour of walking and seeing the animals in the Africa area and swinging by the moose exhibit to take a picture, they're finally at their destination, the Shores and Aquarium.
"I fucking hate my boss, so while I was helping Sam and Cas rescue you, I was supposed to kill a very bad witch that hasn't done her revaluation, which it's just a way to keep track of how strong everyone is," Vanessa explains as she walks over to the fridge and pulls out a couple of eggs, " she also kidnapped people to use in spells" she quickly adds.
"Got it," Sam says before focusing on his breakfast. Vanessa watches the slop go into his mouth, she's never been a fan of oatmeal, the texture has made her spit it out no matter the taste.
Vanessa fidgets with her badge, opening it then closing it a few times, then turning it around in her hands, it's only when one of Castiel's wings extend to touch her arm. So, she starts fiddling with one of his flight feathers, twirling it around in her fingers then running her thumb over the rachis of the feather.
"Seven-thirtyish," Castiel replies, he watches in awe as Vanessa's tail starts crumbling around her legs. "I'll, umm, get you some fresh clothes," Castiel says, his face turning redder by the second, this time he doesn't bother going in the house, he stands up and spreads his wings and flies off.
"Put him upstairs and in the guest room closest to the bathroom," Vanessa tells Cas as he walks up the stairs, carrying an unconscious Dean bridal style.
But uh, thank you for reading, and feel free to leave kudos and comments, I try to respond as quick as I can! And if y'all wanna find me anywhere else, my Tumblr is blueberryrock.
"I'm sure she has some in one of the closets, it'll probably be in her room, be quiet when you go in there though she is somewhat of a light sleeper," Daniel says, pushing Malachite away.
"Well, I'm going to clean all this up, I hope you had a wonderful birthday today," Daniel leans over and kisses his daughter on her head and she hums in response. "I've got work tomorrow so I have to cut my visit short."
"I love fishing! I've never done it the human way, only the siren way. Which from what I've heard from one of my old friends, my method catches fish faster," Vanessa beams.
Sam tucks his still messy hair behind his ears and stands, "I'm going to make some coffee, you want some?" He asks as he starts heading for the kitchen.
"Mmm," Tim says in response. Dean sneaks yet another glance at him, his eyes are watching the trees zip by as they drive.
"Yes, well, there was no use of going down there then, so no one used a dinosaur as a vessel, but if we had to, yes," Castiel grumbles as Vanessa snaps her fingers and more drinks appear. "Okay, no more question please."
"So what? I have someone in my house! I didn't want to tell you guys this soon, now I need sleep," Vanessa growls.
"Okay, Dean, now I need to get on the road, I'll call y'all when I reach the hotel or something," Vanessa says, slamming the trunk door closed.
Vanessa seems to say a full sentence, full of jumbled up sounds, tongue clicks, and the tiniest hint of screeching.
Vanessa throws the ripped wrapping paper from the first gift onto the coffee table before tearing into the second present. She once again holds it up to her chest to look at it.
Ooooh, the story is getting spicy! Technically in the show, Anna's parents get killed and she gets attacked, but I decided to change that of course, I hope y'all don't mind.
Speechless from what he'd just seen, Sam just nods and pushes the body out of the way. Vanessa struts her new, tall, form through the door. The dead body is now gone and three of the five vamps still linger in the room, sitting on the couches that face the door. "Dave, I thought you went to check in the prisoner, " a short blonde haired vampire says, she walks towards Dave/Vanessa with a flirtatious look in her cold blue eyes.
"Yeah, c'mon," Dean walks up to the first big habitat, which the sign above the glass says is a Burmese python.
"I did however read all about how you guys shift and the, umm, great siren war, although I can't remember the name, they were fighting over the Atlantic Ocean," Dean says with a grin.
real, had Cas tell me that a thousand times," Dean kisses her forehead, making her look back at his face. "You have such pretty eyes."
Vanessa sings the first part beautifully as she grabs the spatula and serves Sam his breakfast, she eagerly turns up the radio and turns the song up, she clears her throat (and to Dean's amazement) and mimics the lead singer, Steve Perry's, voice.
"I wanted her to only have a bottle or so, but she kept wrestling them out of my hands," Dean explains as Vanessa throws herself onto Castiel.
Dean stares into his eyes, they are the most beautiful blue he has ever seen like the sky had a baby with the ocean. The grip on his arm becomes painful as the man stares him in the eyes.
Dean props her up against the wall to open the door, the crisp cold air hits him and even under the light coat, he still shivers. The light of the fire that Sam built glows across the patio, both Sam and Castiel are currently relaxing around the fire.
"I dunno, middle of nowhere Kansas, I saw a sign not too long ago about a little town," Dean pops his neck hoping that will help. "We'll stop there and eat if they have a diner."
Every picture and drawing showed is in detail and reminds Vanessa of a bird's wing. Seraphim only have one pair of wings and they can come in a range of colors, the one that they've captured had smaller wings that were a rich golden brown.
"Understood," Sam says bluntly, popping in a tape automatically, turning up the music louder than normal. "Bobby called again," Sam says lowly as Dean starts to head out of the gas station. "He said he's coming to the bunker, he'll be there in a couple of days."
The smell of nature, water, and animals fills Dean's nose as they reach the ticket booth. "Two adult tickets, please," Dean says as he starts to pull out his wallet.
She puts the feather on the bedside table then turns back to him, she slowly unbuttons his trench coat from the top down.
"Yes, unless you know you're name," Dean pauses to watch Tim shake his head no. "Then your name is Tim."
Dean continues to hum the song as he starts to gain speed. It's a beautiful day out, big fluffy clouds are gently floating in the air, blocking the sun from Dean's eyes. He would have the windows rolled down blasting music if the passengers weren't asleep.
"Oh yes," Castiel nods in confirmation. "His original design made their wingspan as big as a pillow and their body half the size with large stingers, but almost everyone vetoed the stingers and size. Which is why he made bees, then wasps."
Her hair once fully pink is now only pinkish-purple on the bottom, starting where her ear lobes would be while the top is a very dark brown almost black. Vanessa moves a strand of hair out of her face and behind a fin, or what Dean assumes is her ear. She has dark bags under her eyes and her usual dark tan skin seems a lot paler than normal. Vanessa is currently wearing a plain grey t-shirt that is a few sizes too large with black baggy sweatpants.
Vanessa looks away from his gaze and past his head and onto a lamp, it has so many flowers on it, Vanessa starts mentally counting the flowers instead of responding to Castiel.
"Dragons? Like the humanoid ones that kill virgins?" Dean asks alarmed, part of him wants to see them and the other half agrees.
Dean opens his mouth to answer when a loud crack comes from Vanessa. Dean can't help but shudder at the sound. "No thank you," he swallows his bite, hoping he doesn't get sick from the noise of Vanessa chewing.
Vanessa rolls her gorgeous brown eyes and heads for her kitchen. "Y'all are going to be fine, they are pygmy dragons and they don't bite and I had their fire makers removed so you guys will be just fine," she yells from her kitchen. The sound of a door unlocking makes Dean's heart rate go up. Both boys look at Bobby for some kind of reassurance but he just smiles back at them.
"Do you like it?" Castiel asks, he slides into the seat next to him and studies his face. "I know you would rather have a pie, but we tried our best."
"I am gonna go and put my things away," Sam stands up and stretches. "Thanks for picking up our lunch."
"He's going to murder us in our sleep and you're worried about movies," Sam snorts, moving to glance out the window.
"Thanks because my boss wants me to take on another job soon and my last hunt didn't go all too well," Vanessa sighs as she starts up the stairs.
"Oh yes, most of the animals I made were snakes but Gabriel said that they needed another animal for Africa and decided to give me that honor," Castiel says with a large smile on his face. "But between us, I think he was tired of getting the stuff he made sent off to that one island."
Dean sets the bag on the beat-up coffee table, he looks down to find one of the two dragons sniffing him. "Hello umm, Malachite?" He bends down to pet her, "did not miss you too much."
"Calm down, she's not a demon" Bobby sighs. Vanessa lightly touches under her eye then mouths 'oh yeah'.
Now, the memories of their first kiss and their first hunt haunt her, all Vanessa wants to do is reach out to him and talk to him again. She doesn't know why, but she feels like she has to, when they met she was drawn to him, like a moth to the moon. Her hand hovers over the keyboard, wanting to type something, but like every other night, she just turns off her phone.
"That is why you came here! To hide!" Maggie leaps to her feet making everyone else stand, "why didn't you go?"
Dean sighs, hearing the low rumble in the distance tells him that a storm is coming, but the bull shit weatherman said that there will be no rain all week! Which was why he and Sam went camping this weekend. No cases for the whole weekend!
Dean walks in the kitchen, the walls are painted a beautiful sunset orange and the tiles are a cream-off white color. There is a small table right by the archway, but it mainly has plants on it, next to the table is a door, hopefully to a bathroom. Next to the door is the large bookshelf that Vanessa was talking about, it's filled to the brim with books. Some with leather cover and others with regular covers, on some of the shelves, are more plants and beautiful large crystals.
Dean sighs, he knows he should listen to his brother about being careful, he's gotten into a lot of trouble for not listening, but the person down there could be dying! Plus, it's not that steep it's just deep.
"I like you both Cas, so who said I have to choose," Vanessa grins. "So if you'd like, I will start showing my love for you."
Vanessa snuggles into the soft blankets, which smell just like Dean, Vanessa's smile grows bigger as she remembers that she scented Dean! Claiming him as hers, too bad he can't do it to her like any other supernatural creature, the best he can do is leave a mark.
Dean reaches the halfway point as the figure becomes more and more human-like. Dean quickens his pace, not caring where he steps anymore, he trips on a branch of a fallen tree and tumbles the rest of the way down.
Since Sam has fallen asleep near the one-hour point, it's becoming harder and harder to keep his eyes on the road without Sam correcting him.
"I fell asleep on the floor with you, then I got up to use the bathroom," Vanessa quickly lies. "And before you ask, no I didn't bring us here, I fell asleep on the floor too," Vanessa answers one of Dean's questions. She watches with joy as Dean falls back asleep and stops asking her questions. And thank the seas he didn't ask her why she's up, Vanessa doesn't think she could answer that truthfully.
Dean moves from on top of her and lays back in the bed. "It's okay to say no," Dean watches her brown eyes slide over to him. "Do you want some delicious birthday breakfast instead?"
"Have fun on your little date," Sam quickly calls out before Dean can realize. He shuts the door and plays back what Sam said, turning a light shade of red.
"Hell yeah," Vanessa stands from her dusty stool. "Let's do some human fishin'!" She exclaims as she wipes dust off her butt.
After twenty minutes of walking in complete silence except for the creepy noises of the forest, they see something in the distance, something glowing blue.
Vanessa shrugs and then turns to Castiel, "and what I just did is a little skill of mine, I can perfectly mimic
Dean quickly licks his kips before they connect with the angels. Dean can't help but melt into Castiel's touch. They break apart for a quick breath and get right back at it.
"Morning love," his husky voice sends a shiver down Vanessa's spine. He plants another small kiss before Vanessa turns in his arms.
"Maaybe, " Vanessa says as she sprinkles in a little bit of the seasoning. "It has important ingredients in it and I find it amusing, "
"No Dean, I wasn't laughing at you, I was laughing that this is a proposal, not for marriage, but just for my love for you," Vanessa smiles softly, she takes Dean's hand and intertwines their fingers.
"Don't touch me, I might just breaking your fucking wrist right here right now" Vanessa growls as she slowly adds more and more pressure.
Dean abruptly stops in front of Vanessa's door. Knocking on it softly, he opens the door when she says he can come in.
"I do know that Dean, and I am all yours right now," Vanessa shivers as another small wave crashes over her tail.
"Are you sure? You had a pretty bad nightmare last night." Castiel says, still not loosening his grip on her.
"I thought people were trying to steal from me, so I made a ball of energy and shot him down the hall and through the door," Vanessa explains and sends an apologetic look at Cas.
"Are you sure?" Vanessa asks, as soon as Dean nods Vanessa moves back to their original position and starts delicately rubbing her face into Dean's neck. A quiet hum comes from Vanessa as she places a gentle kiss on his neck, she smiles as she feels him shiver underneath her.
"Tell me about it, right now you smell like you're supposed to be a couple of weeks dead, " Vanessa says with a smile.
Vanessa turns off her phone, Castiel had cleaned up all the shattered glass so she puts her phone back on the bedside table.
"God fucking dammit," Dean growls, watching Castiel happily go straight to jail past all of his property. "Now he can't pay me shit." His angry green eyes glaring at the angel's piece in jail.
Dean quickly walks out of the kitchen to calm down and finds Bobby petting Malachite. And as soon as he sits on the couch across from him, Pluto comes trotting up to Dean as fast as his wing-legs can go. "Hey buddy," he says as he cups Pluto's jaw and starts lightly scratching.
"Oh, uh, 's where they keep a bunch of animals, not like pets, they keep 'em in nice habitats," Dean explains. For the last ten minutes of them driving in complete silence, he has been having trouble focusing on the road. His thoughts keep turning from his memories of Bobby taking him and Sam to a zoo while their dad goes out on a hunt, to thinking about the angel right next to him.
Tim shakes his head. "No," he says, trying to put the magazine back but it flops with the ground. "I am fine." Tim forcefully shoves the magazine into the rack, his blue eyes gazing up and down, wanting to pull another one-off. His eyes immediately lock onto one at the top, reaching and grabbing it before Dean can see it. "Can I get this one?"
Dean rolls his eyes and turns her back around, her whole face is rosy from all the alcohol, her eyes are glowing yellow in the dim light, and her soft lips are pulled into a stupid grin.
Dean sighs and turns to look at Vanessa. "But it wasn't all bad, I got to spend time with you three."
Sam sighs, looking up from his laptop from where he sits on the motel's bed, to his brother. "Exactly why we can't take a day off Dean, we have to interview the witnesses again, not go to some zoo."
"You boys are kickin' my ass," Vanessa giggles after her drunken rendition of 'Stayin' Alive'. Usually, in monopoly, Vanessa wouldn't be losing this badly, but Sam is kicking everyone's ass with Castiel a hundred dollars behind, while Vanessa and Dean are barely paying off all that they owe to Sam and the angel.
"How festive," Vanessa smirks as she pulls the first one into her lap. She tears it open at lightning speed before Dean can even remember what it could be.
Dean opens his eyes to find a crooked cake with candles that spell out old, it's a chocolate two-layer cake with the top layer slowly sliding off the bottom layer. "Wow," Dean stares at the cake in disbelief. Joy swells into Dean as he watches the flames flicker in front of him.
"Yes, this is agent Flores and Hopson, they are here to see you," Maggie says, patting the couch for her granddaughter to sit.
"It's at the cabin," Dean replies and puts the keys into the ignition and smiles when he hears the low rumble of the engine.
Dean pulls out the map at Castiel's request, he quickly finds where they are and then finds where the reptiles are. "It's on the other side of the zoo, we can circle around to see the animals over here then walk over there."
"Well, I really like her," Dean measures out the flour he needs and dumps it in the bowl. "I was actually thinking about asking her out on a date, but I'm not sure."
"Then I'll get it for you," he says. Dean places everything in his hands and slides it over to the cashier that's been watching them the entire time.
