“You guys really want to do this now?” Carter asks, face disapproving, but otherwise fully collected – and it’s good she can be collected, good for her, because this is about to get a lot uglier than she thinks it will.
“You’re right about that.” Tony concedes, but then, because he can’t help it, he presses the bridge of his nose and squeezes his eyes shut, breathing in deeply to calm himself down. “But we need to take a look at those books as soon as possible.”
He really shouldn’t waste his time thinking about what if’s, but he is. Because… Because look at how his last months have been. Christ, how could he not second guess himself? He fought against the Accords believing with his entire being that they would be the end of the Avengers. But the Avengers have completely fallen apart, and the Accords are still standing. At the time, that would’ve been his worst nightmare— But… Scott has surrendered, and he’s fine. As fine as it can be expected, for a fugitive. He’ll be in prison, but a normal prison, and he will have rights to visits from his daughter and friends, he’ll have the chance for a reduction of sentence, he’ll have
and send me a message. I don't shy away from confrontation and I love arguing. Come at me. Don't be shy.
Tony averts his gaze, concerned, but unable to calculate just how much damage that means for DC – he tries to put numbers together, but his thoughts halt mid-way through like a train slipping off its tracks, a barrel of information that loses itself when it enters the deep fog of his psyche, a destination he cannot reach through the thick haze of what stands in his way.
“We have people.” Tony lamely replies, striding quickly towards them, itching to not be under the scrutinizing, pointed stare of the crowd. Tony goes directly to Pepper’s side, an instinct too old to avoid, but he only belatedly realizes that also puts him next to Rogers, and it’s too late to go around and stay next to Rhodey without being glaringly obvious about it.
Problem is, Tony is very obvious. He knows that. He knows because all the others make it their business to
Maybe Nebula can start working on it while Tony goes downstairs and checks the schematics for the IntelliCrops. Bruce could get a head start on reading some research on atmospheric pollution and proposed solutions to global sunlight dimming. There’s probably a lot of material there. Maybe not a functional, quick solution, but Tony can make it work.
Tony, readily, waves his hand at the screen and brings out a map, zooming in the current location where the mob can be found at, observing the path created by the collection of red dots that indicate the burning sites that have been identified, and tries, as quickly as he can, to establish a possible interception point based on where they are more likely to go.
But even still, a small, wary part of his mind can’t stop wondering how and when she stole these, from
, somehow, because Steve is so used to hold himself as still as a statue that when he feels jittery, it’s almost like is body has a mind of its own.
“Wanna switch places?” Tony jokes, flying close and pushing over one of the men running towards the White House with a bat in his hands, dodging his swing with barely any effort. “I get the strays, you zap some lightning on that fence over there.”
They don’t get it, they don’t understand that getting into the White House and killing – who, the President? The staff? Who – it won’t…
He now realizes why the Accords exist. Not the Accords Ross tried to showcase, no – the Accords that king T’Chaka proposed, the Accords meant to make justice for the seven Wakandans they had killed in Lagos, even if just by accident. Because that’s the thing, isn’t it? It’s
“Yeah. Fine.” Tony exhales, a little too winded. Mercifully it just sounds like exhaustion, which is the most perfect excuse he could come up with at the moment.
“Not like this.” Tony says, with frightening finality. “Not if we can’t pull ourselves together. This, this kind of stuff – it
Steve takes a step back, turning to her hesitantly, and the look in her eyes is... something he cannot explain.
“He finished his mission.” Bruce argues, as if that is enough reason for Thanos to fade away like a memory or an illusion. But Bruce doesn’t understand. Tony does.
Tony heaves out a deep sigh, feeling guilty for his overly-cautious posture when Thor is being so tortuously polite, and he forces his voice to be gentler and more considerate when he replies, “Did you need him for something?”
it makes you uncomfortable, even though I already know it’s because you’re overwhelmed by my amazing looks, brains, and—"
“Should we be concerned?” Sam asks. “What are the chances of the guy hiding a life-threatening injury and acting like nothing is wrong?”
of the tale, how easily Tony can see where the experience and the Accords discussion blend into one another, how many times this problem has happened over the history and just left unsolved, just building itself on top of the ones before, until no one can see a solution for it.
“We’re not a threat.” Steve says, curt and firm, believing it to his very core, wishing Bucky could see it as easily as he can. Bucky is not a threat, not anymore. He’s in control of himself. The Soldier is gone. None of them are threats now, they are just people trying to do what’s right.
What if there’s something out there even worse than Thanos? It rankles just to think about it, terrifying and unnerving, that there might be something out there even worse than this hell on earth – but what if? That’s Tony's entire state of mind. What if?
“I could.” Natasha assures. “I haven’t heard anything, but I could pull some strings just to make sure.”
“I enjoy being right.” T’Challa answers, and as much as it sounds like a joke, Steve knows some of it it’s true. “But it’s fine. The offer will stand, for as long as it’s needed.”
Not that Thor had ever been vengeful, or kept grudges, no – with a brother like that, Tony can’t imagine grudge is something Thor could hold very well, but…
Thank you all very much, friends! I'm very glad to have you all with me on this crazy journey! See you in the next one <3
He opened that door – he opened one door and the world exploded around him, a cacophony of decay and madness, and Tony doesn’t even know where to
– his name, Steve can only manage his name, because Tony’s name feels like an entire sentence in his tongue, an entire speech, a string of long overdue apologies, a plea to be taken back, a fight just waiting to happen, everything at once. He can’t choose one, he can’t
Pepper lets out a startled sound, something that is almost a scream, and she jumps back and pulls Tony along with her, dragging them both closer to the armor, who responds to her distress and activates sentinel mode immediately, a mechanical arm holding up a repulsor ready to blast right over Tony’s right shoulder.
Steve… Steve stays quiet. Logically, he knows it’s for the best. Having Vision here is already a risk much higher than they should be willing to take, but they will, all because of Wanda. Although the information Vision promised to give them could de useful, they could do without it. But for Wanda’s sake, Steve will allow it, because he is not heartless enough to stop these two people that so
when talking about her, to Thanos’ face, his grief and his despair, the tears he was holding back as he tried to take revenge—
Tony had known, and even if he never understood, he never stopped it. Why… Why would he? What sort of moral ground did he have to stop Vision from chasing the company of the person he cared for? Perhaps even loved, if… if he ever figured out if he was capable of that? Tony didn’t know for sure. He hadn’t dared to ask. It was not his place. Tony still remembers coming into the compound and seeing the destruction left behind, the lounge in disarray,
understands. This is a war he cannot win, because there is no way to win. Steve has prioritized his mission many times, and all those times, he did it because he believed he was saving people. He isn’t wrong about that. But
“You can buy me dinner tonight if you want to.” Steve lazily suggests, leaning his head back and looking at Tony with sharp, smug, defying eyes,
But Bucky seems distracted. He sounds distant and he sounds anesthetized, and Steve wants to punch himself for doing this to him. “Yeah, sure.” He says, in a breathy tone, before lowly muttering, “Bye, Steve.”
“He is going to be fragile.” Shuri says, as a matter of fact. Like this is all a mere scientific truth, not
it is now. It doesn’t hurt as much, this time around. He should be glad for that, he should be glad for the
“One of the Guardians?” Tony inquires, as kindly as he can, even as he lets out a pained grunt when an uneasy step makes him wobble and it stings in his stomach, and
They’re not ready. They aren’t ready to exist together anymore, they don’t know how to make this team work, and – if they can’t do it, all is lost. All of it.
“It’s fine, I won’t start a fight. I have no right to. I just want to know.” He assures, looking at them almost coyly, smiling lightly and keeping himself in a relaxed position, elbow atop the counter and feet crossed while he supports them on the legs of the stool, a position that would not allow any kind of surprise attack if he were to do so. He doesn’t raise his voice. He doesn’t stare at them. He just spares them a glance, barely a second for each one, hoping he is coming across as non-threatening by making himself sound gentle and keeping his frame small.
“I’m gonna leave the Jet on top of the House if we’re gonna speed this up!” Clint yells, over the sound of the turbines.
There’s security and cleaning staff, and some family members – a few of them thought it would be smarter, understandably, to hide in one of the most secure buildings in the world instead of their own houses. Tony can see the logic in it. It’s also easier to sneak into the building when there’s no lights, no security system, no rules. But it’s easier, his mind reminds him, for both refugees and rioters alike.
.” Bruce shrugs forcefully, a little edge of panic bleeding into his voice. “What we do know, from princess Shuri’s scans, is that they are polymorphic. Something in them doesn’t follow normal laws of matter, like what we found in the scepter, so they possibly can change form, too.”
“Like he’s the only one who won’t die if he uses all six.” Nebula adds, in a voice that’s all venom and acid. “Which he
But he steps back, like Rogers warned him to, and here lies the problem. They will always follow Rogers, and Tony cannot work with him. He thought he could, or he tried to convince himself that he could, but he sees now that that was a lie.
Pepper wants him to compromise. Pepper wants him to stop and think it through, to find alternatives, to
“You’re a daughter of Thanos.” Thor exhales, voice raspy and raw, realization shining bright like lightning in his mismatched eyes. “Aren’t you?”
“I don’t need it.” Rogers says, with a very sharp edge of annoyance, not seeming to care much about the loss of his once most prized weapon. “Our mission is to stop the riot and clear the area, not attack the civilians and make things worse. We just have to scare them off.”
. And it’s not logical, and it’s not fair; In fact, it might even be mean, or inconsiderate, at the very least it’s contradictory, but it’s
“So that one is the one we need first.” Tony concludes. “Out of all of them, the most dangerous has to go first. The others may pack a punch, but we can’t
way he hadn’t known; But for a guy who had been hell-bent in killing all humans, why would Hill’s initial report of his attacks had indicated that deaths only occurred when actively engaged? Why not…
Jarvis refuses to accept all he’s been given – the house in California, the Ferrari, all those useless things -, except for one thing, the one thing he refuses to part with. He will sign whatever is needed, and he says so. He will fight for it, if he must.
It’s… It’s incredible. It is absolutely breathtaking. It’s sleek and tight, but in all the right ways, the kind of fit that would make him agile without restraining his movements. He knows jus by looking at it, because Steve has the terrible habit of not checking the sizing of his clothes when he buys them, and he always has clothes that are too small or too tight for his now too-large body. So he knows about fitting. The suit is darker, much more minimalistic, no longer cluttered with pockets and straps and lines, perfect for stealth, discreet enough that he could wear it under his civilian clothes and no one would ever know.
The Quinjet cuts through the skies as fast as it dares, drowning in the midst of the foggy cloud of ash and dust, the panels and radars unreliable and unhelpful in every way. Rhodey and Clint have to pilot because they are the only ones who can be trusted with these conditions, the only ones who have the skill and expertise to navigate hostile skies in such speed. And all the while – black is the only thing that greets them. Black, black, and more black, no city lights or stars, not a single beacon to guide them in the night into a safe place; And it’s awful, an experience not even being stranded in space can replicate, this feeling of absolute darkness, like they’ve dropped over the edge of the world into an endless abyss. The cold from outside seeps in through the walls even though the Jet is well insulated, and Tony shivers in his T-shirt, resisting the urge to run his hands through his arms to try and gain some warmth by friction.
Tony stands there for a second, baffled, annoyed, and he watches Thor, Nebula, and Rocket stomp to the elevator to stand beside Natasha, all of them rigid and anxious, the doors held open by seemingly just Natasha’s sheer force of will, as if waiting on Tony to make his mind.
. Thor is looking at Tony, and then at his axe, like something is eating him from the inside out, like there’s a question almost bursting out of his lips that he’s holding back just because he won’t stand to hear it out loud, and Tony doesn’t
, misshapen mass of it, jammed across the street before it disappears beneath a mountain of concrete blocks on their left.
“For you, anything.” Tony says, and Rhodey rolls his eyes with such force it’s a wonder it doesn’t hurt him, and he says
“We should do this again.” He says, as they’re both walking back in the direction of Stark Tower, lazily strolling through the long way around on campus.

He has no idea what Thor and Cap are going to do with an entire floor, though, but he figures some things you can’t go wrong with.
“I wouldn’t have said it if I knew you were there.” Steve admits. “That’s not how I wanted to tell you.”
Thor slumps heavily on his seat, while both Bruce and Rocket flail confusedly, and Romanov whips her head towards Rogers so sharply is a marvel she doesn’t hurt herself. Nebula’s back goes as stiff as a board, her eyes hot as coal,
For your final consideration, I've also brought some gifts, of sorts. As I've mentioned to some of you, I have a list of Post-CW fics that I enjoy immensely and recommend at every chance I get, because they all had a little something to contribute to my analysis and outlining of this fic - and now, you can find these fics in this
“None of it. I don’t think it’s worth it. Thanos has probably wiped out two of those locations already.” She explains, pointing to two recurring coordinates, making Tony feel more hopeless by the second.
Also, now is the time for the other members of Team Cap to speak up a little bit more - especially our favorite russian spy, most forgotten, who for some reason is also not having her actions analyzed enough for my personal taste. As someone who signed the Accords and then backed out, I'm sure she would have a lot to say about this subject. So, Natasha, you're up. A penny for your thoughts.
“Both dead.” Natasha shakes her head. “I don’t know which one was which but Vision killed one and the other got hit by the giant weapons the Outriders brought with them.”
He’s not stupid, you know? Yes, maybe during the fight, and for some time after they escaped - those first few months that were soaked in anger and resentment and impatience -, Steve had blamed it all on the Accords. He thinks that at the time, that’s what he really thought it was. He was high on the adrenaline, on the rebel feeling of invading the Raft and freeing his friends, of telling Ross and all the governments in the world to just fucking
And for a second, he wonders how deep it goes, the metal, if the steel in her spine is metaphorical or literal, and if that has any bearing in the way she holds herself together even though, like Tony, her life seems to have pretty much been completely wiped away with a snap of Thanos’ fingers.
The war had taken tolls on them. He knows this. Sometimes, desperate situations ask for desperate measures, but those measures should never include a plan that allows a HYDRA agent access to American intel. Never. Jarvis is absolutely sure Zola was not the only one – how many other enemies had SHIELD brought inside their home, people like Zola, who had once associated with imperialist maniacs and hateful organizations? How many others had had the chance to sink their claws into their security system?
“Not completely.” The being contradicts but doesn’t press, not actually trying to offer a solution, just being contrary to his words. Tony gets the impression that much like Quill, this one also likes to disagree just for the sake of disagreeing. “You can work with machines. You fly a metal suit of armor.”
“Where did he use to hide, before he decided to attack?” Rogers frowns. “Maybe that’s a good place to look.”
“I’ll retire.” He says, hopelessly, interrupting even though she asked him not to – but the worlds keep bubbling in this tongue, pushing forward desperately as if they could make any difference if he said them faster, like he could cut her train of thought before it reached the dreadful, heartbreaking conclusion that awaited at the end. “After this. I’ll be done. For good. I will never use the suit again.”
“Ok.” Tony braces himself, pretending he can’t hear the tiny whistle his nostrils give when he takes in a deep, careful breath, willing his hands to remain steady for this. For this decision. For this… whatever the hell this is. “Let’s see if it works.”
No one can offer any comments about that. After a moment of silence, Natasha leans forward, resting her elbows on her knees, and asks Clint:
Tony twitches at the chance to be unnecessarily nosy, fishing for a diversion so desperately is almost funny to watch him fumble. “You need more art supplies? I can get you more art supplies.”
“With other soldiers? No.” It’s unsurprising Steve catches so quickly Tony’s implicit question. He might have even prompted in on purpose, and Tony simply fell for the bait. “I was—”

more. Shuri’s eyes are clever and sharp, taking in every detail of his posture and his speech, and he knows it, he simply knows she’s filing all that information for later for some reason.
“These are the news I have for you. I’m sorry I cannot give you any more details, but I will remain in contact and keep you all updated on Mr. Lang’s legal process, if that’s what you’d prefer.”
“You think the Mind Stone spoke to you—” Tony prompts, to make sure he’s following Thor’s logic correctly.
That’s not news. Apparently, the tank top, sweatpants, barefoot look is a common occurrence, because Tony either sleeps too much or not at all, and eventually, he starts to lose the notion of whatever the hell he’s wearing and he just walks around looking like a sleepy mess all day.
, probably. He says it like he knows it’s bad, but it’s done, and now all he can do is admit it and hope it wouldn’t blow up in their faces.
He stopped drinking. His nightmares are… rare and barely bother him at all anymore. The anxiety attacks, well… They’ve gotten better. Somewhat. But he’s better. He stepped out from active duty, as he knew she wanted, he started exercising, eating healthier, trying to be nicer to his body.

The idea is terrifying, the dark, a warning sign to a tragedy they all know its coming but have no way of stopping, the approaching of the end not by the hands of an enemy, but of the world itself, of the universe – depriving them of light, of the right to live beyond the fall of all others who are now gone. Like a taunt –
You guys saw that, right?” They all nod, confused. “It’s on every single news network in the world. The guy is a playboy, has two sex tapes online, known for not holding up one single stable relationship in years, and now, all of a sudden, he’s engaged. Hard to ignore that kind of story. It’ll keep everyone distracted for a least a week, and the timing? Is

doesn’t care, because he’s so tired he can’t be bothered to go back to their hotel room and change, just so he can have breakfast somewhere. He can only guess that Nat and Sam don’t mind either, as neither of them has complained about Steve’s recklessness, and they’re too in ridiculous disguises, eating bagels and chugging down watery coffee with sluggish hands and eyes hazy with sleep.
Steve couldn’t have managed to do this on purpose even if he tried – But he did it anyway. He’d hurt
Not that he’s stupid, or not capable of following their logic or learning about wormholes and Bridges – Tony knows better than to fall for his boy-next-door look or his innocent blue eyes, battered and weary as they might be in his… Lawless Bandit, Righteous Vigilante outfit. Tony knows the guy is way smarter than he looks, he just – he wasn’t expecting Steve to
“You think it’s possible?” Natasha asks, as soon as Tony is in her line of sight. Her face is smeared with soot. “To bring them back?”
“We brought some of Dr. Cho’s equipment with us when we moved here.” Tony answers, although he doubts anyone but him remembers it. He had only remembered it this morning, after all. “The synthetic tissue cradle is somewhere around here. I’m gonna close this wound and I’ll be good as new.”
“How long?” Steve insists, because he has to know. He needs confirmation. It doesn’t matter if he can’t do anything about it now, he needs to know, he needs to make sure he didn’t do what he fears he did.
“We’ve fought aliens before.” Bruce reasons. “Hulk fought the Leviathans and Loki and all sorts of crazy beings before – he never felt fear. Now he’s afraid of Thanos?”
The haze in the city. The grey sky. The dust on top of his bots. The thing choking up Tony’s lungs when he tries to breathe in too deep.
Steve, paying him a hundred bucks for a kiss? That’s funny. It is! Steve is much more of a bastard than most people would give him credit for, and despite what you might think, these kinds of comments are not unusual in the Tower. Every single one of the Avengers has a bit of a money problem, it seems, thankfully Tony has a lot of it – though he will be nice and admit that Bruce is very responsible when he wants to be. But the others? Fiends, heathens. Even Steve. In fact, Steve might be one of the worst, and Tony’s thankful Steve keeps his bets confined to their little band of misfits, or else he’d be completely bankrupt by now, from betting on every single team playing against the Yankees out of pure spite.
enemy has already come and gone, and has already taken his victory with him. Stopping the mob won’t stop the
Steve raises his eyes, but otherwise doesn’t move; and Natasha is not even looking up at him from the spot she was staring on the floor.
The fucking television turns on in a random channel, a reality show Steve could not give two shits about and while Sam tries to put it on the news channel, Steve turns back his attention to the phone, his mind going haywire with all the horrid possibilities. “Bruce, where is Tony?” He demands, “Did he give you this phone?
Years and years of longing and impossible dreams of another life, a fantastical, idealistic, maybe even naïve life – those are gone.
“Then perhaps, if you’d like to keep her friendship after this night…” T’Challa says, and his tone might sound like a suggestion, but Steve is well aware that it
And suddenly, despite how Nebula might react to his intervention, he steps forward, and decides this conversation needs to stop focusing on her
“Well, besides the fact she suddenly became Queen and lost her brother and her mother to Thanos’ snap?” Natasha says, with an edge of annoyance sharp and dangerous.
“Thanos wouldn’t have picked me. Not over her.” Nebula twitches, and Tony realizes she has just stopped herself from shaking her head despairingly, locking her gaze on the projections and not turning to look him in the eye. “She was his favorite. He used
“Not if she’s already set some sort of plan in motion herself.” Rhodey counters. “Knowing those guys in Wakanda, they’re already doing what we’re doing, only three times faster. We insult them and we don’t get anything.”
That being said, Vision being here does pose a little problem; Because Steve wants to talk to Wanda, about Clint leaving, about her powers, about
because so many reasons, and just because it’s not a personal vendetta doesn’t mean these people can’t be collateral damage in case they come back.
Sam’s posture is relaxed, but he doesn’t seem completely at ease. Steve wonders if he should assure Sam that he’ll be fine, and then, he wonders if it would even make a difference.
“That might not be true. Technically Vision wasn’t supposed to exist at all. Biologically. Well, not biologically, you know—” Bruce waves his hand dismissively. “The thing is that when Ultron was building him, when he was
Tony stares at the snarling crowd, considering the people shoved right at the front, the furious, rabid ones, and wonders how this could possibly work with people like them, who are so desperate to take this opportunity, the worst opportunity of all, to inflict pain in response to the loss they all just suffered. Raging enough to
The lights are still on, the glowing panels working just fine, no alarm, no indication that there’s anything wrong with it.
“I just…” Barton exhales, forcefully, and tries again, slower. “I think we need to talk. You and me.”
Tony feels a shiver run down his arms, hairs sticking up on their ends, and he hates the intense heebie-jeebies this magic talk gives him every single time. At a loss for words, the only thing he thinks to reply is, “I think I saw that on a Disney movie once.”
How could Steve simply trust like that? He couldn’t, could he? He couldn’t—How would he place his life, his strength, his convictions in the hands of a world he doesn’t belong to, where everyone is hiding a mask or five, and when Steve had always been so quick to
“So we need something that will distract him long for us to do the same.” Thor concludes, nodding heavily.
“What do we do?” Natasha asks, no louder than a murmur, as she turns her back to the hostages to make sure they can’t even read her lips, leaning forward so the only people who can actually hear her are Rogers, Tony, and Agents Carter and Ross.
It doesn’t have gold, because Pepper always preferred silver. It looks like Tony’s old armors, before he made his current one of nanotech, a model closer to the armor Pepper used when the Mandarin attacked, because it was an armor she would recognize better. Also, Tony would never create for her a suit that functions like his, one that demands implants and it might feel too invasive, when, in an ideal world, she would have never even used it. Because she’s thinner, the armor looks slimmer, and she has less bulk than his own, not focusing on the heavy-hitting force, but speed. The shape of the shoulders and the lines of the torso, flank, and legs is more dynamic that his’ or Rhodey’s large, wide top-half of the suits.
“There’s nothing going on with the team.” Tony reflexively says, and wants to slap himself for it, because that’s exactly the

“I don’t think we’ll have a choice.” Cap somberly admits. “But things are going to get ugly. There’s too many of them – we scare them off too suddenly, they’ll hurt each other when they escape, they’ll trample and swing all over the place, and we have no way of giving them medical aid without any access to rescue services.”
He thinks of stepping back, but Natasha suddenly looks over Steve’s shoulder and spots him, and her smile widens – he can’t escape now, or else she’ll pull him back by force.

Tony also has the very distinct impression that Barton just wants to be alone for a while. He doesn’t know why, he just feels like that’s the case. If it is… Well, Tony can’t
Thor takes in what seems to be a self-encouraging breath, before explaining himself, “When Jane was carrying the Aether, my father told me of the Stones. Not in so many words, but he did.” He recalls, somberly. “And when I searched for the Norns to ask for guidance, they told me of the Stones too. Two warnings that I did not know were entwined, until last night.”

but he does need to head down and see what’s going on – why had FRIDAY not informed him as soon as the first responder showed up? Suddenly, the absence of Pepper on his side seems less lonely and much more pressing. Tony leaves with a final nod and a quick glance at Barton, who still sits curled in on itself like he’s trying to disappear, and Natasha wraps her free arm around his shoulders and pulls him to a half-hug that makes Barton’s shoulders hitch in a sob Tony can’t hear.
of the day before, and how Tony, the only person who could agree with Bruce on his side of the debate, had left him hanging for the other option.
“The last time he was out was when Thanos attacked the ship.” Bruce recalls, somberly. “There was a fight, and I was thrown back to Earth still as Hulk – I came back when I crashed into Strange’s sanctum.”
“Yes, I am monitoring the situation.” T’Challa says, but doesn’t offer any other commentary, and Steve has the distinct impression that if he doesn’t say anything else, this conversation will run dry very soon, because T’Challa is giving him
Tony is not a man of faith, or fate, for that matter – but even scientists love symmetry. Opposing forces, balancing points; There is something meaningful to it either way, no matter how hard he tries to deny it. And he doesn’t try very hard.
Tony blinks, taken completely off guard. He looks at Rogers for clarification, helpless – why is Wong asking
He stares at the communicator on his palm, holding back all his instincts that scream at him to ball his hands into fists, to crush the metal between his fingertips, to find some sort of physical relief,
The problem is not Iron Man. The problem is that, at the very core, Tony and Pepper are driven by the same force - but they fly in different paths.

So now they’re going to have to break whatever little hope there’s left in the rest of this team too.
“Do you know what those mean?” Tony croaks weakly, looking over his shoulder to look at the looming presence with him on the ship.
“Tony.” Bruce calls, a little urgent, leaning forward and raising his hands in a placating gesture, as if he’s getting ready to steady Tony if it’s needed, like he sees something in Tony’s face that makes him frightened, makes him worry. “He didn’t take only the people—”
Rogers walks slow, slow enough that compared to all the others it almost seems like he’s avoiding each and every step forward, rethinking it at least twice every time he takes a stride, even if the expression in his face is just blank calm and determination.
shame, the one that makes him feel like his face is melting from embarrassment or rage or both, and many other feelings that are far too complicated to put into words.
Feels like the beginning of something he doesn’t yet understand, and he’s afraid and curious and awed by what it could be.
is bristling, but he pays it no mind, because the rest of him is utterly despising himself, hating the realization that once again, a huge sore subject for one of his teammates has completely escaped his mind,
Steve looks at her right in the eye, unyielding and firm, and his posture is so clear Natasha immediately grits her teeth and sits up straight, expression hard,
and every time Tony makes the slightest attempt to turn back and catch one last glimpse of the hospital, or of the street… of the
Maria Hill might’ve liked to have it around, for security and practicality purposes, maybe – but Maria Hill left to find Fury, and Tony hadn’t protested against it, and that was it.
“No, but – that’s – that’s not a bad idea, write that down.” Tony points to absolutely no one, but FRIDAY will surely make note of it. “But what we know is that the Sorcerers in the Sanctum have dark energy figured out, or at least some of it, and hopefully Lang is still alive out there and will come back with good news.”
Tony, irrationally, kind of takes offense to that, a little. “As a matter of fact, I did. Pepper can confirm it.”
Steve shakes his head, trying to will away the memory, and he realizes Sam is still watching him. He leaves the papers on the table, taking in a short breath before asking cautiously:
Thor nods, though his expression turns somber. “Wormholes are… stronger. The Bifrost worked well because it was controlled, and Heimdall was… the finest of guardians.”
“And you want me to believe you have no way of tracking Rogers? Through his shield, or his suit?” Ross raises his eyebrows, unimpressed.
But the Raft can’t hold him back now. Steve opens the cells and their reunion feels like coming home, feels right, feels
like he’s breaking down – almost collapsing, but not quite there yet, a crumbling building that’s somehow still standing, because one single column refuses to give into the weight.
“They were in a really rough spot, it seems.” Steve says, and they all look at him at the same time, and he’s back to feeling extremely uncomfortable again. He shrugs stiffly. “I didn’t ask.”
Thor and Tony look at each other for a moment, a stretch of silence that feels oddly… honest, despite no words being said, only the weight of the truth between them more than enough to fill the workshop in a sentiment much warmer than Tony thought himself capable of feeling in this morning, when slowly, the conversation starts to catch up to him past his first initial shock, and he can manage to shake himself out of his stupor long enough to say:
How is that ok? Goddammit, how could he ever think that was ok? They had killed people when they leaked all those SHIELD files.
Tony knows better than to believe everyone hurt by his weapons would forgive him just because he had a change of heart, pun not intended.
“What I’m saying is that you better be ready to do something, if you want to save your planet.”, she says, firmly.
“We shouldn’t be above the law.” Tony growls. “We don’t have the right – not even being superheroes. What’s gonna happen to the families of the people
“Hey, you two.” He calls, “Why don’t you go down to the lab and grab me the toolbox? The blue one, you know which one it is. Bring it here. With all tools, Dum-E! No throwing the hammer at the wall again!” Tony is damn near screaming by the end of his sentence, because the bots just start running as soon as he mentions the lab, but it’s fine. It’s not like he was lying when he said they get restless when they stay still for far too long, because they do.
Sam is rendered completely speechless. Steve knows what that feels like. He watches out of the corner of his eye as Sam paces around like a madman, rubbing his head as if it hurts, staring blankly at the ground and muttering curses under his breath.
hates the idea that he once again went through a surgery he wasn’t fully awake for, even though he doesn’t know if he wanted to be. He simply doesn’t know. His emotions are a mess, his still slightly groggy mind muddying the present and the past together, recalling with far too accuracy the feeling of the uncomfortable, unnatural heat he used to feel on his sternum when the car battery was still there, the bruises on his ribs and the bruises he sported for weeks into his captivity, his entire torso throbbing constantly, the
She can pretend it’s her baby, just the way he used to be, as he wriggles and moves, trying to get away, so he can run and play and squeal
It's finally time for us to discuss the so infamous subject of guilt. How it ties up with responsibility, which Steve is so fond of, and finally discuss the thing that bothers me the most and everyone refuses to acknowledge: how guilt and responsibility impact Wanda's and Bucky's personal identities and sense of self, and how exactly have they (or HAVEN'T they) dealt with it so far, because of Steve's overbearing nature and refusal to allow them to deal with it. But we won't be unfair. Let's bring out some of the skeletons in Steve's closet too, how about that? Because there are a few that I haven't seen a lot of people talk about - and there is one tiny little detail I feel like its important to bring up, a detail that some of you might be already acquainted with, maybe from some Anti-Cap speeches and some bitter Tony stans around the internet, but it is a detail founded on truth. And it only makes this whole thing a hell lot worse.
“No one thinks that.” Steve shakes his head, exasperated, but the corners of his mouth tug upwards a little without his permission. But he can’t help it. It’s working. They’re here, just Steve and Tony, and look at that – they’re having a normal conversation and no one has been hit yet! And Tony’s smiling too, he also likes spending time with Steve, and this is everything Steve’s wanted for months. “Not with all the new people we got now. You want to go tell Hawkeye and War Machine and Spider-Woman you think they’re not good at long range?”
became a team, and started to come to these events together, a whole new world opened before Tony’s eyes; No longer he’s juggling the attention of all the guests alone – Natasha and Clint are great at small talk in all forms, Bruce and Thor make everyone feel amazingly polite, and Steve, well, everyone likes Steve. How could they not?
“Much like the story I mentioned about the Bifrost and the creation of the Universe, and how it allows us to travel across long distances with dark energy – our myths, in Asgard, speak of the power of the Stones from way before any of the Sorcerers like that man Wong were ever born.” Thor elaborates. “We’ve had books on them in Asgard long before
“We fought for a good cause.” Tony says, hollowly, not sure if he’s trying to make Bruce feel better or himself – or if he says it for any other reason at all, just to hear himself say it, just to make sure the words exist, that they won’t get lost in the long list of mistakes they all have to carry on their backs at every second of the day.
this. He chose this, and he tries to remind Bucky, as much as he reminds himself, that this is the path he picked, and he will not regret it. Bucky doesn’t seem to understand that.
“It’s the Ancient One’s private collection. None of these others are as detailed as the Book of Cagliostro, unfortunately, but they could be helpful.” Wong admits, like it’s something regretful, and not
“I wouldn’t be surprised if he tried to punch you again.” He says, but it doesn’t sound like a joke. It just sounds like a statement of a fact. “But I wouldn’t be surprised if he forgave you either.”
“What’s wrong?” Tony’s brows furrow in confusion. “The ship was working just fine, Nebula flew us here in it.”
, anyone they might’ve missed in their haste of the first-days search. They have Tony now. They have FRIDAY. Although sometimes it does feel like pulling teeth, they have been known, on occasion, for working better together.
“We can do both at the same time” Pepper offers, gently. “While I can help down here, I will. And you can help upstairs.”
He would take Bucky’s place if he could. Steve would’ve taken another seventy years frozen if it meant Bucky didn’t have to be in there.
is more than just that. Is more than just a joke. Steve is a man who lives in unbelievable, unbearable circumstances, and he recognizes he didn’t adjust to the future as well as most people think he did. He does get tunnel vision, he does get nostalgic to the point of being
Vision hesitates for a second, looking around the apartment to give them all a calculating glance, but he lowers his head respectfully and gives it a light shake, in a very polite refusal. “I’m grateful for the offer, Agent Barton, but I should be leaving. There is no need to endanger you with my presence any longer than necessary.”

that operated on him. “Hard surgery. Bad wound. You might never be the same. Your body can’t heal like it was before.”
Tony remembers T’Chaka, and T’Challa, and he can’t stop the flush of shame and rage that whorls like a hurricane inside his stomach, heavy like a boulder, sinking into his guts hot like he’s swallowed burning coal. He remembers, even when Rogers seems so determined to forget. He

They make sounds. Sounds of depressurization and recalibration, hydraulics as smooth as always, sounds of wheels tumbling clumsily and beeps and whirrs that feel too much like words. They wheel closer,

that he does, because he knows better than to do so. He knows any pleas he might have will fall onto deaf ears. He has learned this ten years ago. And just as he did ten years ago, he will cling to the only presence he has by his side, he will keep himself grounded on the touch and on the words, even as the darkness of a cave or the vast quietness of space try to suffocate him, because he needs to remind himself that he is not alone. That although the body beside him is not human, it is living and breathing, it is an ally, and it is
“Go figure it out.” Natasha commands, and as she turns the TV on and settles in her spot, Steve knows he is, somehow, being dismissed.
“I promised I wouldn’t get emotional, so no tears, please.” He jokingly says, and it’s ridiculous enough that they all actually laugh a little, disbelieving. But he sobers up, his smiling face not lasting very long, his eyes a little sorrowful and lonely even if he tries to make light of it.
to them, they are all watching him approach the same way one watches a very rare, easily spooked animal, with fascination and careful movements, and Tony, in some other life, might have felt insulted.
“Maybe.” Tony exhales. “We don’t have time to go through thousands of hours of footage of Vision, but from what I can tell, Vision never said or did anything that might seem like the Stone was warning us about Thanos. Unless someone else has something they wanna share?”
She says, in a whisper, after the tears have already stolen almost all of her voice away, that she has been helping whoever she can.
And Tony wants to answer back with soft, hopeful words, wants to offer comfort and call her pet names, wants to feign normalcy because all else he can provide her is
A coward, who has tried to convince himself that he can live with the decision of choosing to step out over billions and trillions of lives.
“He stabbed you.” Nebula says, as if it’s a reassurance. As if that is an explanation for his failure.
“Captain.” The king answers in no more than a few seconds, sounding as calm and wise as ever, as regal as Steve remembers even through the projection of the comm on Steve’s palm. “It’s been a while since we last spoke.”
The scream echoes through the walls, sharp and piercing like glass, and if anyone has any particularly shocking reaction to his screams, it’s not like Tony can see them; Not past the haze of rage and tears that cloud his eyes and judgment, that forces him to lock eyes with Barton and not even blink, refusing to give him a single inch after Barton has just tried to throw everything on Tony’s face as if Tony was the most horrible person he had ever seen. Barton’s teeth click together audibly when he shuts his mouth in a quick, startling movement, lips twisting in an ugly expression, his eyes dark and full of emotions Tony cannot comprehend, not when his mind is stripped so bare.
For now, I hope you enjoyed it! Thank you for reading, and remember, my twitter and tumblr are always open to you guys, and if you like my writing, consider checking out the pinned post in my twitter, you might be interested in that!

so I guess that answers that question. God knows what Tony thought, no one knows what goes on in that guy’s head.”
Despite his enhanced hearing, Steve doesn’t actually hear a word they are saying to Tony, the blood rushing inside his temples so loud it reminds him of the train in Italy, when Bucky fell, the echo of imminent danger and hurt he can’t identify when he’s deep into his nightmares, just a trigger to a physical reaction that has become harder and harder to justify over the years. He hears the vague tones of a voice he hasn’t heard in years, and that alone is enough to trigger a reaction so strong that makes him break into a cold sweat, the uncertainty of what lies beyond the false safety of the jet’s walls too overwhelming for him to reign his irrational response in.
(He doesn’t think she would be followed around by the guards when she’s still inside of the palace. Not if they weren’t here.)
More specifically, Bruce is hiding in Rocinha, which is the biggest favela in Brazil; and to the blessedly unaware, let me tell you what that means. If you've never been, as I'm sure none of the writers and producers of this movie had, it's very easy to miss one essential thing about them: it has its own set of rules. Like many other slums, those rules are not written, they are simply known, if you live in a place where they exist for long enough to learn them. Bruce is hiding in Rocinha for what seems to be a very long time, months at least, and trust me when I say this is more than enough time to understand that there are a few things you simply cannot do if you live inside a place like that. Much like any other place that is built on the necessity of the poor to have a place to call home, where survival meets ingenuity to show how exactly how far people are willing to go to create a community for themselves - people who live in these conditions don't take lightly to those who dare to trespass their borders. Especially, if those trespassers are armed.
Tony’s body flinches violently, and quickly, he’s grateful that Bruce is holding him in place, or else he would have jostled out of the position under the bright light of the regenerator and completely messed the procedure. But that also means that Bruce

“Pep, check the right side for me.” Tony asks, pointing to the side, the one with the least impact of the plane. “Scan the floors, see if you find any civilians.”
“I can get him out of there but I don’t think his adoring crowd will appreciate that.” Natasha muses.
He is sorry. He is legitimately sorry for how things went in Germany. He wants to say he had no choice, despite Tony’s voice screaming inside his head that this isn’t true, but he feels like he had no choice and he is sorry for that. They destroyed the airport, he
Thor visibly steels himself for this conversation, sensing that Tony does not believe him, but refusing to not be heard. There is a hardened, solid strength to the way he clenches his jaw, and straightens his spine, after taking in a sharp, strong breath – and Tony recognizes the posture as one he does himself, when he’s bracing himself for an argument with someone he
“Buck?” Steve asks dumbly, feeling a little lightheaded, the great dam that holds back his emotions overflowing with relief and happiness, his eyes stinging with unshed tears.
” She orders as Steve opens his mouth to argue. “Tony won’t reach out. You know it. And you won’t either.”
“Boss.” FRIDAY calls, urgently. “I’ve detected an aircraft nearing the grounds. It is approaching at high speed, and it seems directed to the building.”
“And nothing Wanda has shown us could be a message of any kind. We would’ve known if it was.” Natasha affirms.
Tony hates himself, he hates that deep down, beneath all this resistance; he actually kind of wants to tell them. It feels like a masochistic impulse, to rip open old wounds he knows will sting and bleed – but also he… he wants to tell them and know if he’s
Natasha, who trusts no one, Natasha, who changes sides and always has three or four alternative plans,
He hates that he recognizes what this is. He’s not a hypocrite to say he doesn’t see the mirror image of himself in her.
Well. You know. Marriage. Tony hadn’t been the kind of guy anyone would have married at the time, granted, but it didn’t – he still thought about it. What if. Isn’t that Tony’s entire shtick? What if. He thought about it, because he had to, because—

“You can’t do this.” Pepper says, all sorrow and anger, desperation and hopelessness, an inescapable storm. “Not now. Not now, Tony. Please, any time but now.”
“Good.” Tony nods, pretending he can’t hear how winded he sounds, that he almost went completely insane and drove himself into a panic attack just because of that scare. “Can’t wait to leave this place. Do we get to watch a movie during the flight? Or it’s not available to economic class?”
Tony knows, with no reservations or doubts, that he is part of something bigger than himself, something he can contribute to, to ensure the world will be better and be safe, and that’s all he’s ever cared about. He’s a futurist – he’s
“The point is that even if it’s too late to stop Thanos from snapping his fingers, if the Stones were worried enough to send us a message, they might have left us clues on how to destroy him.” Thor conjectures.
nonetheless. Maybe Tony is just as eager to hang out as Steve is, not that Steve would allow himself to believe that, even if the mere idea is enough to make his chest feel all tight and warm with happiness.
. Even if it makes a shiver run down his spine at the strength of Rogers’ blue eyes, even if it makes a bead of sweat run down his back unpleasantly, he stares
The Accords might not seem like a threat now, but they have no guarantee they will stay that way. First, it was the Avengers. How long until they were being forced on every single enhanced individual in the world, even those who don’t fight? How long until people stopped being treated as people and started being ranked by threat levels, losing all sense of their humanity, because power-hungry agencies would try to control them or push them into fighting each other?
He tries to breathe, tries to take in a large gulp of air to calm himself down – but when he inhales, the dust and the smoke come with it, and they taint his lungs like poison, and it

“Pepper, honey.” Tony whispers into her hair, sweet nothings laced with despair, feeling himself shake in her arms so intensely he knows he’s moving her, but her hands go around his torso and settle against his back and they are shaking as well, her nails digging into skin, holding as tight as she can.
All things considered, it’s lightning fast. Compared to other projects, a year is almost no time at all to get something done; but Howard is brilliant after all, and he has a clear advantage on every other person in the world that could attempt the same thing he just did.
They are sitting at a table inside a tiny and cramped shop, at early hours in the morning, after a night making rounds and fighting off some gang members on the east side of the city. They sit by a dimly lit corner of the room, behind so many other tables full of people taking their first coffee or eating a sandwich, all of them so sleepy and distracted that Steve, Natasha, and Sam are only kind-of hiding behind baseball caps and cheap sunglasses, and nothing else. It’s a bit risky, but they don’t care. Well,
“Stark.” Nebula warns, startled, and she extends a hand fast enough to grip him by the shoulder, pushing him back into his seated position, and the entire world goes white for a moment before it shifts back into place, except now it’s all rotating around him.

“Not like we had a lot of things in common. Motivation, for one – we were very different on that.” She chuckles humorlessly, a sound that comes off more from her nose than from her mouth, continuing over Steve’s emotional thoughts without hesitating. “But she was a woman who knew how to keep secrets, and she kept them well, and I
He is working on the security panel, frantically looking from screen to screen as he types in commands he can remember from previous experiences, guesses a few things here and there, just enough so he can access the cells without causing much more damage. He’s already rendered unconscious the four guards of this room. He would like to avoid any other unnecessary encounters, because this whole thing is already messy enough as it is.
in a way the Court never is, never has been, not since Antonio could remember. Their music thumps directly into his chest, drums and flutes played with vigor and strength, and it should be disturbing, maybe even scary, but it’s… not.
Rogers takes the opportunity of silence to step forward, to stand beside Natasha, and after exchanging a quick look with her, he says:
” Tony barks back at whoever spoke, because he’s not coherent enough to discern which one of them was. “It can’t happen like this.”
“You brought Sam as your reinforcement?” Steve sneers, unthinking, ignoring the way Sam makes an offended sound.
When he speaks next, his voice is level and collected, no sadness and no regret, just the distinct, unmistakable sound of a
Not because Nebula has no feelings, because Tony knows that is not true – and he has known it for quite a while now, ever since the Benatar, the salty chips, and a steady arm around his back –, but because Nebula likes to pretend she’s all metal and strength, no cracks, no wounds, no soft spots, when she’s really not.
, even if he’ll never truly be, and he needs to have metal in him to keep himself together or else he always,

they’re here. He most likely does. But there are no alarms blaring, no guards coming after them, so Steve doesn’t know what to think of it.

But there it is! There it is, folks! Pepper is here, and Rhodey is on his way - and not alone ;) We're about to open the world's biggest can of worms! Don't let this Pepperony reunion fool you, that SteveTony tag is firmly in place and it'll stay there - and I wonder if any of you have any idea how I'm gonna make that work, seeing I'm keeping Pepper alive and Tony still very much caring for her.
Tony swallows down a whimper of agony, reducing it only to a flat, emotionless question of, “What kind of part.”
“No.” Lang exclaims, but reigns himself in before explaining, “The suit doesn’t just allow me to change sizes, it can let me talk to the ants too. Well, not
“Carter? Can you hear me?” He asks, barely after a breath, hoping Carter won’t freak out about suddenly hearing him invade their so-called secure comms.
“I’m just saying they can help.” Lang lamely finishes, trying to make his explanation sound a little less nonsensical than it is. Luckily for him, they’ve seen weirder – at least, that’s what Tony tells himself, when a little voice inside his brain asks him of taking Lang with them in this ride is
Now, I have a question for you. A friend of mine mentioned she'd like to see my interpretation of Steve in IW, especially about a... certain statement. You know the one. If you're here for the Stony, you know. As of now, this fic is tagged as Possible Spoilers for Avengers: Infinity War, because it's now up to you to decide if you'd like to see that extra scene here. So let me know! It wouldn't really change my initial plans for this fic, it would just expand a little bit further into the character arc Steve will go through in the Part 2 of this series. If you're not planning to read that, it might be interesting for you, because it'll basically conclude Steve's emotional analysis of all canon content until IW without any further plot to build upon. But if you guys rather have this fic focused only in CW, I can always make a separate one shot to expand on my thoughts about the canon IW content and how it would fit into my Fix-It later on. So drop me a line and tell me what you think.
If the Hulk has some private reason not to show up to the fight, even when Bruce tries to force him to… Seems like Tony hasn’t been giving Hulk as much credit as he was due, then. Maybe Bruce hasn’t either. They need the big guy, they could certainly
During the first month, Steve anxiously took the phone with him everywhere, sometimes taking is out of his pocket to rub his thumb over the sides, tapping distractedly at the back, wondering if Tony had already received the package. He knew he could trust Natasha to bring the package inside, but actually delivering was another matter altogether, and no matter what year was it, 1945 or 2015, mail delivery was never too trustworthy. So he waited. Waited for like what he felt was a reasonable amount of time for package to arrive at the Tower, for Tony to read the letter and think about it a little, and then call Steve back.
, the emotion echoing inside his own body in perfect, deafening acoustics, so encompassing he almost doesn’t comprehend where it all came from. Rocket immediately tries to reign himself in, ashamed of his reaction, turning his face and wiping his fur frantically as if he could be quick enough to hide the damage that has already been done; And though it’s useless, they all pretend it works, because none of them know how to react to such an open display of vulnerability, none of them confident enough to comfort each other in any way other than their mere presence or an awkward pat on the back.
Rocket screams into the night like his heart is being ripped out of his chest, and the feeling echoes in Steve’s chest, in all of them, and they can’t do anything but watch as Rocket breaks down, completely, and the blue woman can’t react in any other way than placing a hand on his shoulder, gripping tight, probably past the point of pain, as her own face twists into a grimace in a feeble attempt to hold back her own tears.
“Jane helped us create a trap, of sorts, that incapacitated Malekith. She and Erik Selvig helped me in the fight, and when Malekith was dead, the Stone just…” He makes a wavy gesture with his hand. “Escaped from his body. That’s when we gathered a proper place to keep it, a case specifically made to contain powerful objects such as the Aether. And when we secured it, I returned to Asgard, and my friends took the Aether to the Collector, hoping it would be safe.”

Howard is giving her a tiny piece of her baby back. To keep safe and hidden, so no one can hurt him anymore.
Today is the day. I come with hammers and nails, to seal the fate of two people who, in another universe, could have made this work. That is the sad thing of the multiverse - sometimes, the one you're in is not the happy one. This one isn't. Not for these two. Not because I'm evil, or because I have no other option, but because I get it, and I'm doing it anyway. Tough choices, friends. I hope, that if nothing else, I can make justice to both of them, to who they are as individuals and what they believe in, and the reason why that's exactly the thing that's important; and why I feel like it's a mistake to pretend their relationship never happened because the story would have never been the same without her.
“Now that you mention it.” Tony shuffles, changing his weight from one leg to another, crossing his arms in a thoughtful motion. “I didn’t see Strange use the Stone.”

Steve has been out of the loop for a while. He knows that now— this is what Natasha meant when she said he was
“We’re fine, Lang, don’t worry. No hard feelings.” Tony says, a little mollified by Lang’s desperation, but with complete honesty. “You can help.”
“It’s not an Arc Reactor like the one before. Not really.” Steve ignores her comments and keeps going with his planned explanation,
So let me put it out there, to make sure it's very clear. Let me show you the consequences up close, so you can understand. First up: immediate consequences.
Tony shakes his head frantically. “That wasn’t your fault. If anything, it was mine. It just - a lot of things happened, and-”
The rest of him, everything else he is, all of him that is a soldier and a hopeless man, stands very still and waits for what’s to come the same way a prisoner waits for his sentence.

“I’m thankful anyway. But even though I was not the best mother, Jarvis, I still am his mother. And I miss him terribly. So, you must understand that when Howard gave me this, gave me a tiny piece of him, I couldn’t refuse it. I can’t deny myself whatever of my son I can still have.”
Tony feels like something is wrong. Something is wrong, and he doesn’t know what. Irrationally, he thinks the mere act of catching him already asleep must have clicked something on her mind, even though Tony knows he was just
We're gonna start with Thor. Consider this a part I. With a sprinkle of plot, and lots of introspection, let's gently pry open a discussion that, at first, might look like it begins and ends here - but believe me when I say it doesn't. Thor is much more intelligent that most people would give him credit for, and canon has made him a mess of a character, different portrayals as movies went by making his character a very layered, very interesting puzzle to unravel; so it's gonna take some time, but without a doubt, it will be worth it.
He doesn’t recognize his location. He’s laying down on something hard, a little chilly, and there’s a blanket thrown over him, but it’s not doing much considering the cold feeling is coming from
“So if you think we can get past this and actually take down the son of a bitch, I think we should try.” Barton tells him, he tells
“It’s fine, really.” Steve sighs, forcing himself to get back in the conversation. “Natasha isn’t the only one who’s cleaning up the evidence. SHIELD does have a training program for this kind of stuff.”

(How many hours of oxygen are there left? He can’t calculate. He doesn’t know anything about this planet to be able to make an assumption.)
“You can't keep doing this, Tony.” She tells him, in a sharp, firm tone. “You can't do this. Not again.”
“Well, I did have a great night, Tony. Thanks.” Steve looks down for a second, sheepish, as if he’s not sure if he should be
But he was so blind. Grieving. Once he learned about Charlie Spencer he stopped thinking, he was desperate, he was so desperate for someone to come along and take the weight of the guilt off of his shoulders he just ignored all the warning flags and signed his name— and signed away his freedom.
“We have reasons to believe the Winter Soldier was the one sent to eliminate Howard Stark in December 16, 1991, in a mission designed to steal a secret project of his. A project that would’ve changed the world, they believed. Something revolutionary.”
Nebula extends her hand at him, careful and deliberate, and asks “Can you stand up?”, but Tony is reaching back before she can even finish the question, and his fingers are so cold her blue skin feels warm under his digits.
He peeks to the side, and yeah – Thor walked around the corner of the table and placed himself next to Tony, his entire body postured in a comforting, open, perfectly amicable expression, a willingness to be present and to be a safe place for Tony to lay his grievances on that he had
I had way too many questions to just ignore it - so we're going to roll with it. Thank you, Feige, for this piece of information. You might never use it, but I am going to have a lot of fun with it.

how hard it is for us when we fight about this, but – I really feel like I should say it, okay? I don’t want you to – to assume the worst and then we get angry at each other and we can’t talk. I can’t do that. So I need you to listen, please.”
He kind of wants to ask what they’re doing here, but at the same time, he’d rather just assume they’re here to continue with their research and just… never talk about the others again. That would be great, he feels like. Probably a mess if anyone else decides to join them at any point – but they probably won’t, Tony reminds himself – but that’s fine. Rhodey is probably the only one who will eventually make his way down to the shop; And it’s
Wanda raises her eyebrows at him, humorously. “You won’t try to convince me this is a bad idea? That it’s not safe?”
” Tony says, but as he stands there, divided, the others rush in too, all scrambling to gather their bearings and settle as quickly as possible, grabbing weapons and finding seats with none of the elegance they once had, when they were a team and knew how to navigate through each other’s paces. Now, they’re scattered, and they bump into each other painfully at every single move, like ants scrambling beneath the hot laser of a magnifying glass.
It’s the fizzling sound that makes him turn. Tony knows that sound. He looks over his shoulder, confused, and for a moment, he thinks he sees a flick of red bursting into existence out of nowhere in the air and he frowns deeply, his entire face scrunching up in bewilderment—
Thor takes a moment, analyzing Tony with unnerving patience, making him feel caged, vulnerable, practically see-through.
She can also see the way he hesitates even harder at the suggestion, his shoulders tense and mouth tightly closed, and although he can’t see himself, the moment the flash of a dark, dark tub and the phantom spasm his body gives, the memory of a bright, stinging shock, blooming from his chest into his limbs, the discharge of a car battery lodged in a place it shouldn’t be.
“Captain Rogers asked me why you weren’t listed as an official Avenger.” Nick says, with all the casualness only a person as smug as him can have.

“No.” Wanda exhales, after barely a second of deliberation. “No, I can’t stay. We can’t stay there forever.”
“Do they have energy where they’re at? Food, water?” Bruce interrupts, stepping forward anxiously to make himself more noticeable.
He shouldn’t be surprised that when the blurriness starts to fade, the destruction they left behind them becomes crystal clear.
“Not Ross’. The people.” Bruce elucidates, his eyes dark. “They keep guns. There’s a whole society in there,
“Before JARVIS got uploaded into Vision I had to piece him together from scraps scattered around the servers. It was the only way he could hide from Ultron without being caught. When that happened, some bits of Ultron got left behind too, from before he cut himself off from the Tower.” Tony explains, for the sake of clarity.
“Did you not hear Scott’s verdict a few minutes ago?” Clint points to the television, accusingly. “No Raft. So yeah, it’s cool. It’s getting

Bucky, it's your turn. I am done with Steve making harsh decisions using you as an excuse. There are no more time-pressing matters. No more reason to grab a gun and run. How do Steve's arguments hold up, I wonder, when they don't have the adrenaline to hide the less than polished corners of his armor - Or should I say, his shield? Did he think any of this through? That's what we're about to find out.

at the cost of something else he deserves, which is acknowledgment and closure; An honest, meaningful, real closure to all the problems he's faced so far. So this will be a hard journey. This will be painful. This will be horrible.
” Tony has to scream, using all the power in his voice modulators to be heard over the deafening noise of the riot. Thor stops in his tracks, just as he touches the ground from a quick jump from over the fence, and mercifully, he reacts quick – as soon as Tony darts towards the invaders, Thor follows him, no questions asked.
Shuri shuts down all projections with a sigh, taking a second to look at Bucky’s peaceful expression with a thoughtful look on her face, and when she looks back at Steve, her will is as strong as ever, unshakable and assured, and the very small part of him that can appreciate her bold nature is completely overshadowed by the sheer feeling of
“Not everything has to be something he must learn about. Videos are nice. He could have some fun once in a while.”

I am 100% serious. Just because this fic is over doesn't mean I'm done talking about it. Also do keep in mind that you can also find me on my tumblr and my askbox and my chat is always open.
“Wanda told us,” Barton says, with worrying deliberation, “that she got to you too. Inside the Base, in Sokovia.”
Even now, this bothers him. There was no determining the origin of Ultron’s distress then; Tony still doesn’t think there’s a way to do it now. Either it had been the Stone echoing the hatred it happened to absorb from the people around it, or some twisted, flawed version of the code Tony put into him in the first place—
Natasha lets out an elegant snort, so soft it almost sounds like a huff, but the mocking is as strong as it can be.
As soon as the doors open, Tony maneuvers himself out clumsily and passes by Nebula, who stays inside proffering all sorts of insults and threats at him, but Tony doesn’t care.
at the pain that bursts into his foot, unconsciously bending over to soothe it with his hands until a sharp twinge on his torso and the painful creaking on his knees stop him still, awkwardly balancing himself with his arms open in the air, like a crazy drunk trying to stand on his feet while walking a straight line.
Tony clicks his teeth together in quick, minuscule movements, the rhythm a soft distraction he can redirect his anxiety to while he thinks. “What would be strong enough?”
“You’ve got some fight in you.” The man says, as if he’s pleased. His eyes are focused on Jarvis’ hand on the gun, but he is not afraid. “I see why Howard Stark would like to have you around. Men with no spine can’t take much of his ego, I guess.”
Thank you for reading, friend. I hope I made myself clear despite how sad this had to be, and I hope you can trust me when I say this is not pointless, and it will get better. The journey is just rough. And I told you it would be.
“It’s not SHIELD business.” He quickly corrects. “And I know. It’s not that. It’s something personal, and no one else knows about this, not even Peggy or Obie. It’s just us. I want you to keep it safe, and keep it hidden, until the time is right. Can you promise me that?”
Ross barks out a weak laugh, nodding curtly to himself, as if terribly amused. “If you had told me that just a few years ago I would have
FRIDAY pulls up a screen full of graphs and readings, heat-signatures and demographics, cross-checking information in real time, right in front of him – and a number, blinking uncertainly as many, many other documents and serves pass by behind it, calculations running wild before settling,
Steve’s smile is adorable, soft and sweet at the edges, just like the pastry he’d given Tony last night, just like his kisses – and Tony wonders if it would be just as sweet in the morning.
And Tony hates that he’s upset about it. He hates it, because why the fuck should he care about what Barton thinks?
“Seriously, you need to stop, you make that sound like a threat and I have no idea how you do that. I’m not comfortable with it.”
“They were attacked?” Tony interrupts both FRIDAY and his own thoughts, focusing on Visions’ wound, worried.
“No, wait, that can’t be true.” Sam complaints, and then he looks at Steve earnestly, expecting him to agree.
, because watching to closely meant more than admitting he was going against the thing he was fighting for every day – it meant admitting something Tony already knew, but wasn’t ready to think about, because he doesn’t like what it says about Vision, about their agreement, and about
So, he doesn’t think twice. He grabs his tools, he goes to his lab in the middle of the night, when no one else is going to be around for at least a couple of hours, and he gets to work.
The Guardian stands, then walks around aimlessly, their footsteps incredibly light and incredibly loud at the same time, in Tony’s overwhelmed mind.
Wanda gives him a tiny nod, her eyes gleaming with happiness, her expression so grateful Steve doesn't know what to do with himself. So he just pats her shoulder, awkward but kind, and he gives her a tight smile as he passes her in the direction of the door to his own room, assured she will be fine. From now on, she will be fine.
“Might just be the blood loss.” Tony points out, unhelpfully, distantly realizing he’s sounding a little slurred, and his sweat feels cold. It’s clamming at the back of his neck and going down his lower back, his hands starting to tremble a little. “Are you cold? Or is it just me?”
Steve is not one to dwell on such matters, usually. Truth be told, he’s probably the one who avoids thinking about it the most, because after he’s woken up, everything he does is to avoid looking backwards too much, fearing he might get lost in his own head if he allows himself to miss it. It’s exactly what he did at that night at the bar, so many years –
“Where are they?” Tony asks with a frown, his brows drawn close together in deep concern. “Are they still in New York?”
Tony can hear his blood roaring in his ears, loud and chaotic, deafening, and past it all he exhales shakily, nearly a sob, and answers her back.
Tony’s left leg is bouncing anxiously with restless energy, his eyes almost dry from looking to fast from one graph to another, one paper to another, one
, in battle. We put our lives at risk every goddamn day, and sometimes… Sometimes we run out of luck.”
“If we get a Gauntlet, the next step is to figure out what to do about Thanos and the Stones.” Tony proposes, logically. “We have to find him, to immobilize him, get the Stones, and snap. Considering we don’t know where he is yet, we have to focus on the next part: stopping him, and stealing his Gauntlet.”

“Then, Ultron. A crazy robot. Not even a living being. When we caught him, he was destroyed, but there are no repercussions in killing a machine, is there? If that’s the case, they shouldn’t even have bothered with presenting Vision with the Accords. What does it matter? He has no rights. Machines don’t get the privilege to sign
Not for the first time, Tony wonders if it’s something that developed over time, of if initially was Bruce’s refusal to work with the Hulk and not against it that prevented him finding a way of living peacefully with it before he could fall into the despair of losing control. Tony can understand the need of
When you're on edge, you sometimes say things you don't mean. And sometimes, you say exactly what you mean. Whether it's fair or not, whether it's mean or not - whether it's true or not.

asshole, he would get himself into a fistfight with an enemy who was twice his size and five times stronger than he was before he would call Steve for help.
He didn’t have to do it. But he did it. He threw the accusation in Tony’s face, knowing fully well that his fake tone of resigned acceptance would never fool him, only make him feel worse for
this new truth, because if magic cubes can exist, how weird could it be that magic people also exist?
“It’s ok, Wanda.” Steve almost stutters, and he tries for a joking tone to mask how off guard she caught him with her apology. “I can’t really blame you for using your powers on us when we we’re fighting in opposite sides, can I?”
Steve tries to tell Tony it’s fine, but he never gets the chance. He wonders if the Iron Man boots are meant to make him faster when he runs, or if he really is that fast on his own, but he also never gets the chance to ask.
He smiles politely, all American Boy charm and clear blue eyes, despite the fact his posture is as stiff as a board; using a brown leather jacket, jeans, tidy hair and a box on his hands. It’s like he came out from a vintage magazine. “Thank you, Mr. Stark. This is more than enough.”

This discussion is not over yet. In fact, it's only half of it. Peter Parker, Harley Keener, the Barton kids, Nebula and Gamora, and Groot; This is our list so far.
They huddle together on a corner of one of the secret rooms, only found thanks to Carter’s impressive skills and fortunate previous knowledge of the House – and if that advantage comes from personal experience or SHIELD interference, there will never be a right time to ask, now. They cry and sob and hug each other, trapped like abused animals in a cage, behind a table that provides little to no cover in case of an actual attack, much less one like the crowd that roared outside just mere minutes before, had they been able to get past the gates before the Jet had arrived. Tony’s entire body shivers in fear for what might have happened to these people had they gotten here too late; because he doesn’t even know what would have happened. He can’t even imagine. There’s no logic to be applied here to rationalize this, because this is just…

Soon enough we won’t have sunlight.”, he gestures towards the pitch-black night outside, to emphasize his point, “The ashes didn’t disappear, they just scattered. Eventually, the chemicals and particles will rise to the atmosphere and they will block sunlight, which will kill the rest of the plants that are left, and it’ll slowly take down the entire food chain with it. Not to mention the

“Doesn’t Pepper disapprove of Tony being Iron Man?” Steve presses for information, not sounding nearly as calm as he wishes to. He actually sounds kind of
“Just a rough estimate. You must have one, don’t you?” Tony motions to Bruce, trying to seem as unassuming and respectful as he can, even if he can’t help but feel like he’s pushing Bruce against the wall on this. “You read some papers, you have
“Oh, good! That’s… That’s good!” Scott stutters, a bit more happily. “That’s really good to know. I’m glad, Captain!”
the Accords take it all from him. He’s ceasing control, and it’s ridiculous, because Tony is the most controlling person Steve has ever met. That damn futurist mind of his, going through every scenario and trying to prevent all the bad ones from happening all at once, how can he let this kind of thing happen? First Ultron, now this?

“An hour and a half. And counting.” Clint makes a resigned expression – the kind of expression an aggravated father would make over his child –, turning around and going back to his chair. “I’m not sure what’s going on there, I’m trying not to think about it too hard or else I feel like I might regret it. Not sure why, but I feel like I would.”
“Bruce is probably in the lab.” Tony guesses. “He might want some Indian. Maybe Nepalese. There’s a nice place downtown that has amazing take-out. JARVIS has the number. Order it and put it on my tab.”
He goes downstairs, looking sharp and precise as always, and accompanies Maria in her charity event, as a dutiful husband should. Everything goes very smoothly.
How can he not overthink it? Is this normal for rich people? No, it doesn’t seem like it. It sounds like a Tony Stark thing. But would he really invite them, invite
I'm pushing Tony into a very specific situation. A very particular dilemma. One that's not new, but this time, it's going to change everything. Don't let Tony fool you. Don't let this on and off, together or not, this mess of a relationship fool you. Whether you like Pepper or not, whether you
in some sort of way. How else would he describe it? Bruce always spoke of Hulk as if he was a different person – so Tony tried his best to think of it that way too, to be respectful of Bruce’s feelings on his other half. Honestly, he doesn’t know if there’s any accuracy to it on scientific terms, but he thinks it doesn’t matter much; Bruce is the one living with him, inside his skin, every day.
, she exasperatedly claims. She says he has nothing to prove. And it’s true – and at the same time, it isn’t, and Tony can’t explain it properly to himself, much less to her or Rhodey, or anyone else.
That is the occupational hazard of his profession, he is aware of that – but he is also aware that people often don’t remember that fact. They don’t want destruction. They never do, no matter who it comes from, the heroes or the villains. The war they created between them, the war they brought with them to that airport in Leipzig – it wasn’t the German’s war. They had no right. They did it wrong.
She’s not asking about the charge. Tony knows. The way her eyes lock onto his form, scanning and assessing, taking in every detail the same way he does when he finds a piece of tech he can’t comprehend, Nebula is trying to

to face him now - his absurdly blue eyes, his cheekbones, his lips - oh, Christ, Tony might still be a little bit in love with Steve Rogers.
At first, Steve just hovers a little, and plays with the bots. Dumm-E likes to play fetch. But then, he starts to bring in a notebook. And he won’t let Tony peek into it, but he says he
Tony realizes he can’t find in himself the strength to answer Nebula’s question, whatever answer that would be, mind going too fast to process words – so he doesn’t. He simply stands there for a second, barely hesitating, before grabbing Pepper by the hand and making a gesture towards the side at Nebula, and says:
“It was always him. He gives the orders, and we just…” Tony makes a vague gesture with his hands, fully aware that it doesn’t really explain anything, but he doesn’t know how else to say it. How can he explain? Maybe at first it made sense, but over the years, as the fights with Pepper became more frequent, he became more and more aware that the Avengers’ dynamics had shifted into something Tony found extremely hard to put into words, even more so since Ultron. “We follow. Maybe that’s wrong – it
. No matter how much the kid said he had fun. Tony is the adult, he’s the one who should have known better.
“Thanks, baby.” Tony hums, and then, in the cold dark of his empty bedroom, just because he knows no one will hear him, he asks:
Where are Barton and Romanov?! Where’s Rhodey and Nebula and Rocket, where’s Bruce, and Carter and Ross, where
Tony knows he’s right on this. He has to be. “He won’t part with that thing so easily. Wherever he is, that’s where the Stones will be.”
There isn’t much he can do about access to SHIELD files with his limited skills, but his friendship with Howard Stark had not come without its benefits. He’s learned a thing or two about hacking into computer systems without leaving a trace, and he honestly doesn’t need much. Just a lead. Howard made very clear that Tony came to be as a secret project, and no other person but himself was involved in the process of his creation or coding, but by now, Jarvis has learned to doubt every single authority organization Howard Stark has ever worked with. Even if said organization was also founded by Ms. Carter and Mr. Stark himself.
“In a week?” Clint whistles, which is impressive, because he has his mouth full of chicken nuggets they bought from a local fast food joint for dinner at the same time. “They really want to get this shown on the road, don’t they?”
And then, she points up, and Steve follows her finger only to realize this part of the glasshouse it’s connected to the inside of the palace – and there is something that looks like a viewing gallery a few meters away. It’s an entire wall made of glass, allowing the view of a long corridor about two floors up, that was obviously created to allow a scenic view of the entire garden, even the part that’s far away, where the glasshouse just opens up to a huge balcony that allows a view of the entire field behind the Wakandan palace. It must be beautiful. Even from down here, at this hour, the setting sun makes the rays bleed through the glass roof and bathe the multi-colored garden in an almost ethereal light, making the small part of Steve that is still an artist at its core sing in delight. The reds and the yellows against the bright green of the leaves, the unusual colors of a particularly large flower that grows much taller than all the others, like the crowning jewel of the garden. He can only imagine what it looks like from up there. It’s probably breathtaking. He imagines Bucky was most certainly joking about finding this place relaxing, because Bucky was never one to stop and admire the scenery like Steve is, but if there is one place on Earth that might’ve changed his mind, it would be this garden.
goes unsaid, but perfectly clear by his tone. “I am against them, and I always will be. I will never support something that was made to stop me from helping people when they need me. I don’t care about governments and their agendas. I don’t care about politics. We are not weapons to be used when they think it’s convenient— We’re

Tony, who hid the fact he used the scepter behind their back. It only goes to show that keeping secrets between is never the best course of action. They can’t support each other if they are hiding the game.
“HYDRA has a little secret they call the Winter Soldier Project. Very top secret. Very dangerous.” He says in a business-like tone. An almost emotionless tone. “We have information on an ex-soldier of the Soviet Forces, a man named Vasily Karpov. He was a colonel for the army before he was recruited by HYDRA, and according to sources he’s directly involved to the Winter Soldier Project.”
But Tony is, in his heart, a multitasker. He has to be. His mind fires in too many directions a once, and for now, this might actually be a good thing; Because he won’t have the luxury to have some downtime later to think about the other elephant in the room calmly. The issue will not go away if he stops looking at it, as it usually and frustratingly does. In fact, the longer he ignores it, the more dangerous it will become. So he needs to do
When Rhodey nods at Tony, he’s the last one left, besides Tony and Rogers himself. It’s simply instinct to follow him, despite his hesitations. Tony thinks he should be more worried, or more annoyed at the sight of Rogers alone in his workshop as he leaves, but he isn’t. The slope of his back, hunched and heavy, and the bow of his head – nothing in his posture is confident, or arrogant, or assured. The beard gives him a more solemn look, but the posture is what really doesn’t let him be anything but concerned; It’s not
A gunshot cuts through the night, loud and dry, and collectively, they all drop low in instinct, crouching and throwing themselves on the floor, panic wrecking through them like an explosion, unleashing chaos upon the entire block. It so unexpected, so sudden; Tony feels disoriented, like everyone else, just as helpless, and it awful that it takes him even longer to react, because—
” He unhelpfully answers, his brows twitching in confusion, and with a huff, Nebula ignores him in favor of slowly taking off his bandages without aggravating his wounds.
He can’t be the only one who is so completely consumed by this need to reverse this, he can’t. They are all so insane, all of them, a group of ragtag maniacs full of traumas and violence, people who have made the mission of their lives to throw themselves at the line of fire, and now Tony is the only one who is thinking about this? He is the only one that can taste the insatiable hunger for revenge? No matter the odds?
“I am angry about the Accords.” She almost makes it sound like an insult. “Is that what you wanted to hear? I’m
Tony doesn’t break it no matter how hard he wants to, because he doesn’t know what to say. He wats to get up and hug her, but it wouldn’t do any good.
Steve looks at him like he’s amused, smirking at a private joke. “Jerk’s late. I set him an alarm and everything, but you know how he is.”
“Neither would I.” Steve says, to Tony’s complete shock, and his face blooms ina flush of heat, mortifyingly. “But I had enough problems on my plate without Jarvis breathing down my neck.”
Both of them, only extending olive branches when it’s convenient. Only when it’s too late. Only when the war is already at their doorstep, forcing its way in, and they’re too busy looking away to hold it back. And now they’re here— worlds apart, in opposite sides of the fight, when they should be together and helping each other.
, after Johannesburg, and the comparison rankles deep, it aches in the most fragile of places inside his chest.
And in the end it was Zemo, a man consumed by grief, heart heavy with sorrow for his lost family and nothing more than his convictions to push him forward to destroy them for revenge - he was the one that succeeded.
“The windows don’t open.” She says, as if she’s giving him a report, the very same tone she used while they were inside the Benatar – the out-loud strategizing, going over possibilities and options at a quick pace, the very same way
When Tony is standing there, in the middle of this charred scraps, black dust beneath his boots and the smell of burnt metal on his nose, with his helmet pulled back so he can feel the nearly unbearable heat of the cabin, a sharp contrast to the biting cold of the world outside this explosion site, so he feels the dirt sticking to his face, the disgusting feeling of his hands sweating cold beneath his gauntlets – he looks at the floor of the plane, to the burnt bodies of those who didn’t manage to get out on time, Tony remembers why.
” Carter stares them down fiercely, no chance for misinterpretation in her voice, and even the security guy on the floor looks a little intimidated when he reaches for the small device in Carter’s hand. “All you have to do is call Agent Klein. He’s just a few blocks away, and he has three other agents with him. If you need backup, you know who to call.”
For a second, he stares at her, a mix between scared and daring, not truly jutting his chin out in defiance but very nearly doing so. If Tony had the option, he would retreat, turn his back to her with a charming smile and an annoying one-liner, to push her away in the most effective and quick manner, but Nebula has already seen
Tony ignores him with a grunt, paying him no mind even as he sits right beside Steve and points to the TV. “Doesn’t matter. Movie’s starting.”
“That’s not news, I never sign the paperwork on time.” Tony complains, though he knows it’s not the best argument. “And I don’t spend all day with Steve and the others. But Avenging takes time, and that time has to be spent on… Avenging.”
Steve nods, because that’s all he can do without losing his composure, and finally – finally – T’Challa decides it’s enough. He takes a step back, a step that doesn’t really influence anything about Steve’s trajectory to where Natasha was headed, but as soon he does, Steve recognizes the silent permission to proceed the king has just given him. That’s all he wanted. It’s all he needed.
the effect it’ll have, and he’s not above using it to get what he wants. “If you get here fast enough, you might still find me there when you arrive.”
“Hello, Vision.” Steve greets with a nod, keeping himself very still as he waits for Vision’s next move.
“And his daughter, Hope Van Dyne. I don’t—” Lang stutters. “I can’t find them. Please, if you guys know anything—”
To look through the glass over Natasha’s shoulder as they flew back to New York, to watch the Compound as it came closer and closer, tangible and
he doesn’t say. He won’t throw the attention back at her like a hot potato – or a bomb, because apparently that’s how strongly Nebula feels about it. He knows she wouldn’t appreciate it.
?” Wanda gasps softly, her hands gripping tight at the armrests of her flimsy chair, her entire body vibrating with a nervous energy that is almost visible in the air. She looks like she is about pass out.
“I’m just worried.” Steve says, almost growling the words, hating the way he sounds so desperate. His head is pounding, his

– JARVIS had been concerned all the way through. The insistence in redoing tests with every single element in the periodic table and every combination of elements at least five times hadn’t been all at Tony’s own request. His worry showed in many small ways, ways that Tony tried to ignore, but really couldn’t.
to scream at Tony, but can’t. Maybe his throat his closed tight, so tight he almost can’t breathe. Maybe his tongue is swollen and too big and the words don’t have room to fit in his mouth, too heavy, too horrible, too
Now that he thinks about it, that he sees the book pass from hand to hand behind him under the scrutinizing gaze of his teammates, it doesn’t seem right, to have something that can simply control Time existing out there – and that this book, sitting here right in front of them, is an instruction manual on how to use it. That the Time Stone was just hiding here, and any crazy person who learned some magic and decided they could just pull on the threads of reality itself could simply have grabbed the Stone and changed everything.
Steve has once let Bucky beat him black and blue so he wouldn’t fight back. Steve doesn’t trust anyone the way he trusts Bucky. He
“To bring back Vibranium? You really think the Wakandans are just gonna let us waltz in and grab their stuff?”
“Ah, it’s not… A good idea, it doesn’t last long, and it’s pretty exhausting.” Lang admits, almost sadly.
“When Maximoff attacked us, back when they were helping that man Klaue steal the Vibranium, I had a vision.” Thor tells them after a pensive pause, measuring his words with surprising care, the gruffness in his voice a hypnotic tune that seems to fill his words with powers unknown.
“We might not have a choice.” Bruce raises his eyebrows, surprisingly assertive. “The truth is that if she can help us, we might be able to pull this off. To go on rescue missions and save the planet at the same time.”
“Actually, you could have, and it would have helped a lot.” Bruce mutters, mostly to himself, just to try to wave off the awkward intensity stifling the cabin, but to no success.
“Agamotto was the first to discover there were other Stones like the one he held, and he began a research to discover what were elements that created and controlled life in the universe. From learning about the body and soul, he learned about the universe, and the knowledge that there should be more Stones out there balancing the scales of life became obvious.”

Steve had never actually told his team what went down between him and Bucky during the fall of the Helicarriers, not in detail, but they all
Right now, there is nothing else they can do. They are outside the city limits, hours away from their current hotel, and there is a Wakandan jet waiting for them right ahead, with a pilot Steve can’t really see from his position. Clint tells him that it’s not Nakia, but it’s a pilot sent by the king himself, and Steve supposes he’ll have to take this information as it is and be satisfied.
been a little suspicious, a little wary, a little concerned for Ross’ intentions with the Accords. Steve
“Okay, we’ll get back to that.” Tony quickly intervenes, for both Bruce’s and Thor’s sake, stepping forward so he can bodily block the vision between the two of them, hoping a barrier will make them retreat instinctively. “So we actually have some information on the Reality Stone, and that’s good. How did you get it back, after the… whoever took it from your girlfriend?”
“Yes. Colonel Rhodes is fine. He is in rehabilitation and physical therapy, and with the help of the right aids, it is possible he will be back to walking with no difficulty in a few months.”
Sam does not deny or confirm the fact. Steve is torn between appreciating the gesture and feeling scolded by it, the seconds of silence ticking by like the countdown to the explosion of a bomb, the eerie anticipation for a revelation Steve is not quite sure he’s ready to hear.
kicks back in, and his gaze turns genuinely earnest when he asks, “But are you sure we can’t be of any more help?”
, and Steve at this point is so accustomed to it he doesn’t react to the obvious assessing in his eyes. “You are not as concerned, this time.”
“That sounds exactly like the kind of thing he would expect.” Nebula adds, with a curt nod and a sneering expression.
“There’s a forge, in a place not many know that exists. It was the home of the Dwarves, the mightiest blacksmiths of all Nine Realms. Eitri, the Dwarf King, said Thanos forced him to make the Gauntlet in exchange for the life of his people.”
, to make the Accords stronger, but every time he picks up Steve’s calls, every second he allows Bucky to live in secrecy inside Wakanda, he is betraying the Accords.
“And?” Rhodey presses, and Bruce lets out a breath so deep that Tony fears it might hurt his ribs, and when he raises his head, Tony
for the so very obvious sorrow Clint feels at the idea of letting a person he cares for to feel any kind of suffering. In this moment, as in many others, Steve wonders how exactly Clint sees Wanda in his mind, a strange mix of as a friend, a protégé, a daughter; especially when he is so far away from his family, from his wife, from his own
of a meeting with—!? You gotta be kidding me.” Tony scoffs, wry and tired, running his hands through his face roughly. “There was no better time to do a great, dramatic entrance? Really?”
Steve tells himself he will let it go. He will not fight about it. He will not try to stop his teammates who choose to sign them, even if he cannot agree with the Accords still. Steve will still be hiding, because he didn’t back down when he was asked, and he still won’t back down now. He will fight, when he can. But he won’t let anyone get hurt. No more trading lives. And despite the fact that he already is trespassing, that he already is inside a country who doesn’t want him here, he will wait and pray, every single day, until the day the people ask him to come back.
“We were so lucky to act freely for as long as we did. You don’t even realize that.” Natasha whispers, much more gently, her whole body deflating and turning soft and tired, so drained and weary, exactly how Steve feels inside. “Look at our missions. Loki, the Chitauri. Aliens who never had to face trial in any human court in the world. The Chitauri fell. Thor took Loki back to Asgard. And we walked away free.”
He thinks back to all the times he ignored Tony’s attempts of reconciliation, and he feels bile rising up on his throat, rancid and burning and
Building a slightly more compact version of the reactor into the machine is not really a problem, procedure-wise, but the need for secrecy becomes even more imperative after he’s done it. It actually makes him a little concerned. He hadn’t planned this in advance, had not even considered it would be necessary, but as the months came and went and he struggled to find something that would fix some of the critical mistakes his programming was causing, the arc reactor was the only solution he could find that wouldn’t take at least five more years to develop. It was already at hand. No one except Vanko knew Howard had the reactor and he needed to hide it, somewhere not even Vanko could’ve found it if Howard didn’t want him to, and suddenly, his new project was there, the perfect opportunity, the perfect circumstances, and Howard just couldn’t resist.
There are moments when a direct attack is shot in Tony’s direction, and sitting here, where the threat has long since passed, is still not enough to stave off the kick of fear and adrenaline Tony feels in his blood when a huge purple beam comes straight to his face in a lighting strike, and Tony only has a second to recall he’s not actually in danger before the camera is obscured by the armor’s shield, instinct acting before the mind can even think about it.
It’s dangerous. It will… If they manage to pull it off, chances are some of them might not come back alive. Maybe even all of them.
Of course, Tony can only wonder how much the loss of his hammer weighed on him, especially when it was seemingly destroyed by his
“I didn’t know how to tell you.” Steve admits, and it’s painful to do so. It feels like pulling teeth. Steve doesn’t really know how to be vulnerable; He has spent most of his life making sure no one would ever see him when he is. Exposing himself, putting his feelings on the line for the judgment and scrutiny of others, even of his friends, is something he still hasn’t learned how to do.
“What did he do, Tony?” Pepper asks, and the idea of saying it out loud again stings in him like a physical blow, drilling painfully into his temples, making him close his eyes and his face twist in a grimace.
But Steve is more careful, now. There is a lot about Bucky he doesn’t know anymore. And a lot of it involves a deep, encasing feeling of
He knows what it says about him, that he kept the shield. He knows how it shows how… how he’s such a—
, is what he’s truly asking, but he has learned the hard way that this question cannot be asked with those words.
“And what does that change?” He says, a little too desperately, a little too rejecting. “Nothing. Right? It changes nothing. So what, you saw Nebula? Could still be a coincidence. I’m not convinced.”
, and nods at it, blinking confusedly, and it is only at her request that the armor complies and stands down, going back to resting position and deactivating the system until further requests.
is what he had in mind to avoid the issue I’m not sure I trust his judgement.” Natasha grumbles with seething sarcasm, her lips pressed tight into a line.
The corridor in which Tony’s bed was cornered into was completely empty, ever since he woke up, and all doors across it are closed tight and never once moved. The lights are off, he belatedly notices. Far down the hall, where the corridor meets the circulation area, the fluorescent lights are on as they should be, and the walls and floor are so white they hurt his eyes. But the corridor, his corridor, is dark. Dim and secluded, a small space where he feels totally detached from the outside, a tiny piece of a world that feels like it shouldn’t exist.
