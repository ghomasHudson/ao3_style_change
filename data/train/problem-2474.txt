On rare occasions, I feel obliged to relate a case without being able to offer a satisfactory resolution. This happens in fact more often than the written record would suggest because I often see little enough value in dwelling on Holmes’s failure, either in instructing the reader or even in providing a thrilling story for their enjoyment. But the case of the unquiet dead, as Holmes took to calling it, is worth remembering. Those familiar with my accounts would be forgiven to think Holmes some sort of calculating machine, where forensic detail is put in, computed upon by his remarkable mind, and out pops the correct conclusion so justice might be served, with no hint of bias or even perspective.
Ah. It seems there was no paper after all. Ajua, the girl tasked with watching over me, has informed me I have spent the last twenty minutes tracing letters into the blankets she wrapped around me. Quite fervently, it seems. I am ill. Or not ill, but quite injured, and also quite enjoying the effects of whatever they put in this tea to dull the pain. I knocked my head quite soundly, when I fell some days ago. Don’t tell Ajua, or she will fetch her uncle, the closest thing they have to a doctor here. When it comes to doctors I only want the one. And they would almost certainly not give me more tea.
, and I always thought that enough. I did not know him well -- he went abroad for a while when I was quite young, and when he came back …. well, he was not fit for Bedlam, but he was in a sorry state, that much even I could see. He would sit for hours, in near total stillness, only to break it with these sudden bursts of energy. Mycroft was a year away from university, and he was locked away in his room with his studies, most days. There was a concern, too, that Sherrinford would be less …. restrained than he was around me. My parents thought it would do him good, to have reason to hold himself in check. I don’t doubt they thought I’d be safe, and that I’d give our poor harried mother some respite while I sat with him. But even so."
Perhaps Watson was correct; perhaps we provided the deeper challenge.
. At that Watson moved his hand back and shook his head in exaggerated dismay.
"And do not suggest you could go in alone, carry my watch in your pocket and take the risk solely on yourself. Losing you again would be worse still." I knew I was venturing dangerously into the sentimental, into those things we always left unsaid, but his determination to know at all costs was leaving me rather unnerved.
Those words were so similar to ones Holmes had spoken two years ago, in Cornwall. They were etched in my brain, as unalterable as ink on parchment. So much of that case had proved unforgettable to me, it was all so ghastly, ghoulish even. But Holmes seemed comparatively unaffected by it once we returned to London; or else he hid its effects from me quite expertly. I wondered: was he quoting himself intentionally, or had the episode simply weighed so heavily on his brain of late, those old words came back to him of their own volition.
I'd balanced my weight, then, and gritted my teeth against the pain in a way I hoped wasn't too noticeable (yes, in those days I still harbored fantasies of deceiving Holmes, on occasion) and bided my time until Holmes could help me back to a chair. He looked at me with his eyes shining brightly, swallowing hard against a lump in his throat. Was my old friend afraid? That was an impossibility, but even so, the words came tumbling past my lips before I could stop them: I was fine, it was but a scratch. And then he cut away the cloth and ran his fingers along my bare thigh in a touch that was both probing and intimate. I turned away, hoping against hope that my grimace hid the blush coloring my face. He stood up, turned to face my assailant, and left me to my thoughts. The worry on Holmes's face, the relief on seeing I wasn't so badly harmed as I might have been: those glimpses into the true depths of his affection were hard to forget, and by Jove I was not overly inclined to try.
“You were a budding chemist at the age of four?” Watson asked. I felt the curl of his lips against my skin and found I was smiling, too.
"My apologies. Our esteemed Mrs. Hudson, or rather her less-than-esteemed brother --"
Watson arched an eyebrow at that. “With malice aforethought?”
“There was an old fish-pond back behind the house. I liked to watch them, and the hawk-moths, you know, they favored the jasmine-bushes we had planted near it. Hawk-moths fascinated – fascinate – me, their social structure can be nearly as intricate as bees. And the anatomy of their wings: they simply should not be able to beat so quickly. And the sturgeons and the minnows, sometimes they would pause in their swimming and look up at me.” I knew I was obfuscating, unintentionally perhaps but even so. My childhood had been a lonely one, and I did not enjoy letting others see the child I’d been – even Watson. Especially him, perhaps. But best to get on with it. “I could lay there for hours on end, under the bushes’ shade, and lose myself in their company.”
Holmes ran his hand through his hair and rubbed hard at the base of his skull, as if he could scrub this puzzle away. "What would you have me do?"
“Woman.” Ah! So I could still surprise him. “Or girl. Josie was our stable-master’s daughter, sixteen at the time, and a master of all things horticultural. Or a mistress, I suppose.”
To his credit, Watson did let me proceed at my own pace. He simply held me, his grasp and his breath and the warmth of his body a steadying presence. I turned myself in his arms so I faced him, could read his expression for any clues to a negative reaction, but I found only curiosity, and patience.
is, apparently the exception to that rule, blasted overachievers."
"First you will forget the mystery for the next hour," I said. "We will go out and have our tea, and fortify ourselves against the cold weather. And then you will ask Master Haynes your questions. There are other people we might talk to as well. Our Mister Lewis’s uncle, and his friends, if they can still be found. And we should ask Liza Smythe if she remembers anyone else who served on the organizing committee with her mother -- they might tell us more about Mrs. Peace. We can run other tests on your tissues, too, see if we can learn more about this mysterious gas."
Mercy is most often called for, and a recognition of how little we understand our fellows’ circumstances.
The next ten days were crammed full of festivities both professional and social for Holmes and myself, and Christmas drinks (twice rescheduled) with Holmes’s brother Mycroft that somehow fit neatly into both categories. Holmes himself begged pardon on that occasion, claiming a winter’s cold that was much improved by the next morning. Finally we were free -- to be locked in a small train compartment with a three-hundred-pound accounts clerk with a truly appalling case of halitosis. That night, though, saw us ensconced in our rooms in Cardiff.
"I thought I might go up to Cardiff for the new year," he said, apropos of nothing at all so far as I could tell. He effected a passable imitation of a smile. But …
"This all happened so long ago,” I said after Holmes completed his account. “Some might say time’s passage has made it near unsolvable.” Holmes nodded noncommittally. "No clues to be found after all this time, no future crimes to be prevented. No innocent man sitting in prison unjustly for all these years." He did not answer me; half turned away. "What aren’t you telling me, Holmes?"
There often was. Beside me, Holmes leaned back in his chair, adopting a more welcoming stance. For my part I met the man’s gaze, inviting him to look at me and ignore Holmes for the moment, judging that of the two of us, even in my irritation I must be the less imposing audience. "You seem a decent man," I said. "I’m sure you’ve done nothing to warrant such discomfort."
to serve. Eldest son of a country squire -- he could have had the best education, the best of opportunities, just for the asking. Yet he went away, and then he came back like
“Sometimes the goose gives you no option.”
"Murder, yes. Perhaps. A near forty-year-old murder, three of them in fact, if it’s more than a simple accident. The parties involved are likely dead themselves or scattered to the wind; but for my own peace, I would know the truth. And for the sake of bringing peace to the sister of the natural suspect, who seemed most eager to clear her brother’s name."
"Our esteemed Mrs. Hudson, or rather her equally esteemed brother --"
“This was your family’s estate, yes? Your father was lord of the house?”
Holmes sat in silence, sharp-edged as a tempered blade. "I had my suspicions after you told me how he acted, that summer after his return. It reminded me too much of some men from my own regiment. So I had an old friend from my own days in Her Majesty’s service confirm my suspicions. Sherrinford was a commissioned cavalry officer in Johannesburg, and was sent into Rhodesia. He might have wanted to see a bit of the world, leave his mark on it in a way mere tourism would not allow, before he settled down to mind the family’s affairs in Cornwall. I do not know what he saw, of course, but I know the artillery sent into those conflicts. Mechanized guns with a truly fearsome power to take life. I can well imagine."
“And did you catch your man?”
Holmes hummed in agreement. "Your theory, Watson, that Dickens meant these records to be found gains some credence. Mister Lewis, have you any idea why the papers only came to light now, nearly forty years later?"
The effect was almost immediate. I sat down behind him and pulled him into a sitting position, massaging his chest, but from the way his breathing was evening out and his body had stopped shaking from the exertion of  dragging breath past his constricting throat, those efforts were almost unnecessary. I held him anyway, leaning close against his back and inhaling the scent of him as I traced curlicues along his wrist that I assured myself were soothing enough to count as medically pragmatic.
He looked Holmes straight in the eye in a bout of courage I would have thought him incapable of. "I don’t believe in ghosts, sir. I can’t explain what happened with Mrs. Peace. It’s just a good bit of custom. And Master Haynes wouldn’t thank me for ruining his scheme." Beside me I saw Holmes pressing his lips together, a barely-suppressed smile threatening to show itself. People really could be such fools. "And it really is just as the paper says. I’d only add Mr. Dickens left earlier than planned, and at an odd hour: returned to his rooms past ten and did not settle his account until near three in the morning. He left the very night Mrs. Peace was --well-- spotted."
"An Inspector Hughes with the Cardiff police force has offered to send me some tissue samples they retained from the explosion. Yes, after all these years; some in their office have a modicum of competence. The samples are sure to be dessicated, possibly worse, but I will run what tests I can on them and see if they at last yield more light than smoke."
“And the illicit allure of a shiny laboratory. You never have suffered from an overabundance of patience, love.”
. If you have other such writings I hope you will share them, without delay or when you believe the time is fitting; and if such moments lie decades in the future, I cherish the anticipation and look forward to the result.
"Or perhaps Miss Davies witnessed something that Sneed wished to remain hidden, and in trying to silence her he caused his own death as well. Or perhaps there was some other party at work in their deaths. But that is not the story as Charles Dickens relates it, and he was so sure of what he saw! You saw it in his writing, of course, but look how he canceled his engagements and rushed home to his family. And how he took those hours to record what he saw, preserved the pages so they’d be found, even when his account could well make him appear the fool. To write of ghosts wandering the streets of Cardiff; or worse yet, beings from another planet!"
that this table must be put to other uses is beyond me." She waited for him to move a small pile of clippings to a new home of his choosing before setting down the biscuits in their place.
Come home soon, Dearest. I will wrap you in blankets and ply you with sweet tea, and gladly listen as you recount the adventure that was your day. And if you have other plans for our evening, you may well find me amenable to those as well.
Ajua says I should rest and has promised to bring me paper and pencil when I’m well enough to sit, if I will just stop this trace-writing now. Sleep seldom means rest these days, but I suppose it cannot be avoided forever. I will return.
So I was quite surprised when he raised the question again some ten weeks later, completely unprompted by me. It was unseasonably warm for early December, and as both my patients and the cleverer members of London’s criminal classes had conspired to leave us alone, we’d decided on a stroll through Regent’s Park. The fresh air would do us both good, I judged: elm, beech, and cypress rather than the slaughtered holly and other evergreens with which Mrs. Hudson insisted on decking the halls seemed a welcome change. For my part I felt as content as a house-cat napping in a spot of sun, but Holmes resembled more closely the kitten with a feather held over-head, poised equally to pounce or flee at the first provocation.
." I did not say: I thought you would have learned this lesson in Cornwall, that my near death would have had a longer-lasting impact even if you cared not about your own.
First: I am now in a small village not far inland from the African Gold Coast. If I was ever told its name I did not commit it to memory. We are perhaps a half-day’s walk from Takoradi, and for me that was its chief and only attraction. You might question the wisdom of a white-faced European seeking anonymity in a small African village, but the cacao-beans they grow here are much sought-after, so my presence here, while unusual, can easily be explained.
That said, the first time I'd set foot in Nathan Garrideb's rooms off Ryder Street, I was taken aback, so similar was it to the parlor from my dreams. I said nothing of my fears to Holmes, even once he'd found out the other Garrideb's true identity, and I followed him the next day back into that house with as much courage as I could manage. If this was to be my final end, I told myself, I'd had a good run of it; and in any event I still had one more death-dream to fulfil. So I wasn't wholly surprised to feel the burn of the bullet working its way through my thigh, nor the realization (instinctual by that point but also well-supported by professional knowledge) that his bullet had missed the bone and the major blood vessels, that the leg seemed too much under my control to be suffering from nerve damage, and that – though the pierced muscles burned with a fire I had not felt since Candahar – it was what I had described to many a soldier as a flesh wound. A graze. Not dangerous.
Holmes clapped my hand at that, and we rose together, making our way out toward the dining room.
John-
, the – my breath caught at the intimacy, no longer charged with erotic intent but still a possession of all that was vulnerable in me – the
"Is that it?" Holmes cried out. "Do you have it?"
“The path was quite narrow,” I explained, “between the jasmine-bush and the wall of the pond, and narrower still on the other side. If I went round that way I knew I’d come out covered in sap, and as I said, my mother was a force to be reckoned with. So I opted for the more direct approach, which would hardly have posed a problem if not for the goose blocking the path.”
“No; they were up by the house, framing the porch.” Somehow that thought had never occurred to me in all these years, that even had those chemicals got into the pond, that would hardly have violated my mother’s orders. “I was quite young,” I said in my defense.
To his credit he did not give voice to those deductions. Instead, he turned to extinguish the candle before once more settling beside me. “Perhaps, Holmes; perhaps.”
Though to have his judgment on that point he’d have to admit me into his confidence and talk to me about the whole thing. At first he’d been all excitement, with not a hint of embarrassment or reserve, giving no indication the parcel was for his eyes only, but over tea our conversation had come to the letter I’d been answering. To my nephew Peter; I was sure he’d be married come spring, though he hadn’t yet admitted it, and thought Holmes might enjoy the clues that had led me to that conclusion.
Last night I dreamt of Maiwand. Of the desert sand and the blinding sun and the glimmering bullet passing through my shoulder, and leaving only blood and pus and above all pain in its wake. It is your shoulder, of course, but in my dreamscape it feels so much like mine. I hope you would not begrudge me this use of your crucible; I have my own, I know, but I grow weary of the dank, chilled rocks under the Reichenbach Falls. Sometimes I long for a bit of warmth.
"Would that we could," I laughed. "But I have patients still, and you still owe the grocer’s bill. And we have social duties as well: Mycroft has asked us round to his club tonight for Christmas drinks. Are you sure you won’t join us?"
"I do not see how it could help," Holmes said, but I could see his mood shifting ever so slightly, like clouds letting in the first half-beams of light after a thunderstorm. Still portending future rain, perhaps, but for the moment letting a bit of sun shine through.
, but he was noticeably absent from his scheduled encore recitation the following evening. He’d left town on a midnight train, with no notice or explanation, and was next seen a week later in Gads Hill. Something unnerved him, certainly." Holmes shrugged at that. He never shrugged, rarely left his meaning to so imprecise an instrument. "I see no reason to disbelieve his account."
"Ghosts again," Holmes said derisively. "This whole case seems shot through with them. And for all this affair seemed a way to escape the lure of supernatural explanations that has so gripped our clients in London."
“You are a menace, Holmes, and a scoundrel,” he said, “and clearly think more of my virulence than I would speak to with any confidence. But
~*~*~*~*~*~
“Clearly.”
"No, Holmes."
I admired the man I thought died at Reichenbach, but it is no great leap (if you will pardon the wordplay) to say I more truly love the man who returned. Would that he had endured such growth beside me rather than continents away; but that is a well-hashed argument I must do my best to set aside.
"What of the paper itself?" I asked. "Is this the kind you have on-hand?"
"That implies a change in its basic state," I said. Holding out the envelope Mrs. Hudson had entrusted to me, I added, "Post for you. A Mrs. Smythe of Cardiff."
interest."
, inching down toward the
“Why does anyone try to fight a goose?”
"And Llewellyn’s, the man with the Cardiff force? And in light of Dickens’ account? Watson, I do not like not knowing."
Watson had let his arm fall while I was deep in those thoughts, and now the hand not resting on my hip was mapping other parts of my body. He wrapped his hand around my forearm, over the discolored skin from an acid burn, a relic of my university experiments. Then with his forefinger he tapped the uglier needle-pricks along my wrist, the price of a 7% solution. Caressed the well-healed knife wound on my shoulder, acquired in Surrey when I had only Hopkins for company but stitched by my doctor’s own hand.
Another act of penance, this time to the scapular head. “A skill you have much improved in the intervening years, I am sure, but at such a young age…”
– I only meant you seemed intent on proving the priests wrong and making room for us in that old rite. Melting into me, and I into you, until there could be no more distinction but only
“I don’t think you’ve told me of this one yet,” he said, tracing the line between the scar and healthy skin. I turned my head away, trying to hide the giggle threatening to make itself known, but Watson was not so easily fooled, these days. “Are you
Stepping over the glass shards from the window Holmes had broken to catch my attention, I threw open the door and made quick work of surveying the scene. Holmes was gasping for air, his eyes were wide with something akin to panic, but there was no injury I could see. Then my eyes fell upon the bee-stinger almost tucked under his rolled-up sleeve.  I plucked it out, but it seemed to be only a common bumblebee. Surely Holmes wasn't so daft as to work with bees if he was allergic to them? Or was he? I ran my hands along his back and throat but to no effect. His breathing was still laboured, and he braced both hands against the table for balance.
. Not only in our joining but beyond it as well.”
“Perhaps,” Watson answered; “or perhaps not. Father Joseph would argue otherwise, don’t you think?” We had spoke on more than one occasion of the chaplain he’d known in Afghanistan, how he’d taken such a progressive view of the comforts men engaged in her majesty’s service might take in each other’s company. Watson had been impressed by his pragmatic streak, and his sympathy for the daughters of a nearby village who could not easily reject a soldier’s attentions. But even his Father Joseph would have fallen short of sanctioning what had grown between Watson and myself, so many years of acquaintance and growing intimacies that surely by now approached the sacramental. Disordered, he would call us, and think himself being kind in that mild condemnation.
"That
Holmes scoffed at that. "Don't be an idiot. They're not, or not generally.
My Watson-
If Holmes’s body had spoken of resistance before, now he sat as a sentry on guard. But I have never wanted for courage in these situations, though perhaps more often with Holmes than with any other man, where the stakes are so high. "Holmes," I began. "Sherlock. You should know -- I have made my own investigations. What do you know about Sherrinford’s travel abroad?"
“Well,” Watson said after a long moment’s silence. “I do hope you gained some wisdom at least, from hiding your injury away. Though my own experience would argue against it.” That puzzled me – surely certain aspects of the investigation could have been handled with more forethought and less risk, the goose not least among them, but hiding the wound particularly? Watson lifted my thigh again until my leg lay bent against his torso, kissed his finger and traced the referred intimacy over the puckered skin.
"Not so little a bit, then," I noted.
“As for the algae,” I continued, “when I at last confessed the cause of my injury and told Mother about the new strain, she chided me, and told me as she redressed the wound with antiseptic how we were getting a new fish the next week. A koi-carp; it thrived on different vegetation. So there was no mystery after all: simply my overactive imagination and the boredom of an autumn's day.” I frowned. “They never did invite me to join them. Mycroft, or Father. Mycroft didn’t poke fun, which I suppose was nice in his way, but he didn’t invite me in either.”
I’d told him the stories behind each of these marks and others in moments like these, willing ablutions for the mischief I’d gotten into when he wasn’t there to watch over me. But some tales remained untold, the scars a testimony to the confidences we have still to share. And my Watson, my Boswell, is of course the master when it comes to words and story-telling, but I do love bearing my past to him like this. So I was not so surprised when he grasped at my thigh, pulling my leg against my chest so he could better see the puckered skin some six inches beneath my knee.
"Yes, yes," she answered, "though how you knew -- " Holmes fixed her with an accusatory gaze, or what would have passed as such between two people less well acquainted. After fourteen years with him as her lodger, she could hardly claim such surprise. A change in tack, then. "And how you can spot it so deep in my pocket, yet still not notice the sun’s passage across the sky and
"Certain details led me to believe him. Claims borne out in the official records, which he would have no way of knowing if he were not also a witness. And Dickens was in town that night, engaged for a dramatic reading of his
That night I dreamt of bees, and bee-keepers, and nothing else.
, and this time I did not hold back. “I would have thought whatever misadventure marked you so would have dulled the nerves as well.” A kiss to the nape of my neck, a manipulation clearly meant to make me more amenable to sharing, but I hardly minded.
I mustered as warm a smile as I could manage. "Mr. Lewis. You clearly know something of Mr. Holmes." He nodded, threatening to bite his lip plain through. "You have read my stories?"
He shrugged again, the second time inside a quarter-hour. It unnerved me, but I let it pass. "It was the unpredictability of it all more than anything. I quite liked rule and order, even then.” In an obvious (some might say artless, for him) effort to lighten our conversation he added, "But I quite liked doing the voices -- well, you said once that the stage lost a great talent when I took up the investigative sciences. We did
You asked for my judgement on your actions, as a soldier. As a soldier I can only say such judgement cannot be easily rendered. We are all fighting our own wars within ourselves, soldier and citizen alike, and those of us who fight the external war as well must often act
"I’ll leave you gentlemen to it," Mrs. Hudson said. Then, leaning in closer, as conspirators might: "Abigail’s minding the bread alone, and she’s as like to burn it as not, poor dear. Dinner at seven?"
That actually earned a rare chuckle from Holmes. "A sensible man would have traded me in years ago."
Night is nearly upon us here, and still I have not completed my tale. Miracle of miracles, I slept through the day, and then Kofi wanted to tell me of the slugs he’d found under a large stone, and I found myself quite obliged to hear him out. But now our little household is getting ready for sleep, and it seems the right time for somber reflection. More crucially, I made you a promise, and I have broken too many of those already. I should delay no further.
"You're a damned fool, you know that?"
know. But there are still avenues to explore. And even if it comes to that -- we might emulate our Mr. Lewis and admit our ignorance, should rational explanation evade us."
That was just the kind of word-play Holmes knew I loved to engage in, but I would not be distracted by his bauble. "We’d have made it in one by train," I said. "Less still if we’d hired one of those new mechanised carriages you’ve been keen to try."
"He." Holmes frowned. "He
. Mycroft’s intelligence came together more quickly than either of us had dared hope, and I went to Budapest, confirmed our suspicions, and then did what needed doing in Odessa. At the time I found it exhilarating, though there was little to excite the intellect in that particular chapter, and the work required more blunt force than I often employ. Now, though, I find I have quite lost my taste for those events. Suffice it to say the web’s strands have been severed one from the other, I hope for good, and Ivanov’s associates now pose no further risk to us.
"The sample could have been polluted. Or your tests could have been wrong."
Second: for a man you once credited as in possession of a “
You may have guessed my brother Mycroft has played no small role in orchestrating my travels; if not, I will tell you more fully if (no, when) we meet again. He has provided funds and identities, made introductions to acquaintances of his in the cities where I found myself. If I had made use of him when investigating van Dijk I might have avoided my current injuries altogether; but I had been impatient to begin.
"Perhaps she simply didn’t know of the plan," I allowed. "Liza Smythe. What is your next step?"
"Cardiff? Really, Holmes?"
I had hoped to share in the mystery of Holmes’s anticipated parcel. After tea, or after dinner perhaps. At a glance I could see it was a leather wallet of the sort couriers used to protect documents from the weather, thick enough for perhaps twenty sheets folded thrice; perhaps less. But that revealed nothing of their contents, and I could guess no more until Holmes chose to reveal it.
~*~*~*~*~*~
"We could make a trial," Holmes ventured at last. "We could go back to the house -- "
of interest," Holmes said. "Were there any theories at the time?"
I could not give my true name if captured, and I had no convincing alias. I could by no means allow myself to be arrested. So I fled Takoradi that very night. I ran as fast and as silently as I could, making my way first along the beach and then inland across the coastal plain once I could find my way.
He half twisted himself around to face me, but I placed my hands on his shoulder blades and forced him forward again. "Eyes forward until your breathing returns to normal," I said. Then, after a pause: "Why would you study bees if they're such a danger to you?"
We had years to learn each other's secrets, I realized with a giddy thrill. My dreams may have heralded death, but it was a partial death and one accompanied by rebirth, the excision of scar tissue that kept me from healing into a better sort of man. And Holmes would be there at each step along the way, to catch me and hold me as I found my balance as he always had. The words would come, and I would share them when he'd have no cause to think them the fumblings of a brain overexcited in the wake of his near-death. Just then I said nothing, choosing instead to hold him against me and breathe in the unique smell of tobacco-smoke and lye and pollen that was Holmes.
“I was four,” I started. “Or five? Quite young in any event, but just old enough to take an interest in my father’s laboratory. It was a hobby of his, you see, chemistry, and he’d converted an old carpentry shed into a workspace. The equipment was quite expensive, perhaps he didn’t think I’d take proper care; or perhaps he just enjoyed having a bit of space for own use.”
, to be precise. They are preferentially nocturnal but not exclusively so – one of the most intriguing species I've yet to study."
~*~*~*~*~*~
I felt my head rolling back against Watson’s shoulder, felt too his bristled lips against the nape of my neck, as he – was he laughing? Even now? I started to pull away, the indignity not lost on me even in my much relaxed state, but he tightened his grasp, holding me still. “I was only thinking:
Watson-
“My magpie,” he said fondly. Watson released my thigh, wrapping his now-free arm around my waist. Anchoring me. “Will you go on?” he said after a moment’s silence.
This, Watson, is my confession.
"So you say," I said. "I’m sure Wales is lovely at the year’s end."
We did not speak of the matter for some two weeks after, though I knew by the telegrams and mail that his own investigation continued apace. For myself, I wrote to Bill Murray, still employed with the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers after all those years, to confirm a suspicion I had about Holmes’s brother. But one Tuesday evening, perhaps a week before Christmas, Holmes made it quite impossible for me to ignore our official case any longer.
, taking the parts in turn. Holmes insisted it might be relevant to our recent investigation. Charles Dickens was writing it shortly after the strange events in Cardiff; it might give some insight into his frame of mind; and so on. I suspect, of course, that that is for show, but should Holmes discover something further, I have no doubt the
was hardly the image I most wanted to call to mind just then, and I found myself wrinkling my nose in distaste.)
I am reminded particularly of an hour I spent with Agnes in Mrs. Hudson’s kitchens, one rainy Thursday afternoon, when our landlady taught us both how to defeather a goose with the least violence to the meat below. It was a necessary skill if Agnes was to gain employment in a certain butcher’s work-room, and so overhear the gossip that passed between his workers. But what I most remember were her questions. Why did the feathers curve just so, was it perhaps some aid in flight; why did they maintain their stores of fat rather than burning it as they consumed it; would a pointed beak not be a more potent weapon when they hunted for their dinner; and on and on and on. I didn’t know half the answers, nor was I inclined to invest my own time to find out for her, but the questions! The way she saw details and wondered at their cause, and could their arrangement not be improved in some way. I may have to seek her out when I make it back to London and find answers for at least some of her questions. It was quite soothing, sitting around that table and hearing her ask them.
For you, though: for you, John, I will try.
Equally, perhaps too much of the evidence has been lost to time, and a true account is simply impossible. I will follow Lewis’s lead here, and declare that I do not know.
Holmes cocked his eyebrow at that and moved to open the parcel straight away but then he hesitated. "Some pleasures are better savored, don’t you agree?"
“Or five,” I corrected. “And truly, it was the lure of being so near them – Mycroft was home from his first term at Harrow – that, and the gleam of all that copper piping, and the bright-colored solutions. As I said, I was quite young.”
I looked up in surprise, but Holmes’s questions had not been directed toward me. Mrs. Hudson had slipped in, unnoticed, and was now standing by the table, the tea-tray balanced against her hip. Certainly there wasn’t a clear surface large enough for the sugar pot, much less the full service and the plate of lemon biscuits she was eager to set down.
"It could have been the gas," I said, though even as I said it I knew I was grasping at straws. "Headaches, nerve damage, brachial trauma -- who is to say it might not have other queer effects?"
For you, though, I will chance judgment just this once. As a soldier, it seems to me you are not quite fair to yourself. You killed no one in Takoradi, certainly no children, and if that came down to luck, well, when does it not? I would remind you, too, as one who trained as a doctor and then went willingly to war, I have been called to use weapons against others in defense of my fellows. Some were little more than children; yet you have called me a war-hero. Consider how your standard would judge me, and if you cannot easily accept its conclusion, perhaps be more generous with yourself.
The design was indeed clever. It employed a lever you could use to keep the gun from firing prematurely, but if disengaged, and with the cock of a single hammer, you could fire again and again with no need to load additional bullets or powder. The combustion in its barrel moved the next set of ammunition into place. One could even delay the explosion once the hammer had struck the firing-pin, just by holding the trigger in place. Mycroft was justified in his concern over this cunning new gun, and I, I thought at the time, in my admiration of its designer.
There was a sea-captain in Takoradi, a man of Dutch descent named van Dijk. His family’s fortune was made in the slave-trade. Though that business has grown less lucrative in recent years, this latest scion still peddles in human souls when he can find no more valuable cargo. The women unfortunate enough to fall under his control are now destined for a more carnal servitude, in the ports around the Mediterranean, and in recent years he has expanded his reach even to the Black Sea. Some elements of his business suggested a connection to our old friend the Professor, but after close observation I have determined he is but a garden-variety fiend. To my shame it was this possible connection and not the personal injustices he was well known for that drew my attention.
The silence returned, this time much less intentional. We’d long since passed our goldfinch but still Holmes stared down the path, unseeing. "Mycroft is seven years your senior," I said at last, "and Sherrinford …."
"By Jove, Holmes."
This was hardly unusual. As always, I was content to melt into the cocoon of blankets Watson fashioned for me, letting him clean us off and see to other necessary practicalities as I lay there, waiting for his welcome warmth beside me and capable of little else as the haze of our amorous congress for once held all other thoughts at bay.  And now that he’d joined me once more, why should I think of anything beyond this bed? With his breath ghosting across my shoulders, his callused thumb tracing over my hip, first the
"Burges has done quite interesting work in his renovation of Castell Coch, I’ve heard."
"You scared him," I said, willfully putting off comment on Holmes’s other claims. I will admit it: I derive more pleasure than perhaps I should from pushing him to irritation (in small quantities, at least). But then I have never claimed to be a good man.
, and the
I ran my thumb along his lower lip. “Granted. And yes: I fought a goose. In retrospect I might have approached the situation otherwise, but at the time it seemed quite necessary.”

I looked upon a tool of destruction and marveled at it, and nearly helped small children bring down that destruction on themselves. Now I must lie abed while my leg heals and see those same children run about day after day. God grant me the strength.
You will remember the homeless children who sometimes offered their services to us at Baker Street. You must have thought it purely a utilitarian relationship: they needed coin to buy food and shelter, and I needed eyes, ears, and hands that could pass much more unnoticed in areas of London than I would have been. But I have always had something of an affinity for children at that age. Their minds are so malleable, and particularly primed to understand how the world works. They were necessary, and useful, but also a rare pleasure.
and were well started on
Quite the contrary: whether the it was talk of marriage or of family generally, Holmes had grown distant, and when he came back to me he pressed his lips together tightly, as if guarding against some words that might slip past. Later, when we sat in our chairs after dinner, pipes in hand, he kept putting me off, dancing from one idle topic of conversation to another. The upcoming trial of the albino cobbler (how the barristers had mangled his pretty evidence!); or whether we could hope to obtain tickets when Balakirev played at the Royal Philharmonic (unlikely, barring a grateful client with sufficient connections). The papers remained untouched and uncommented-upon.
– I felt myself utterly deboned, as formless as one of the sea-mollusks.
You did not ask for it, but I will take my chance and offer one more judgment, as an author. Reading this account, it was evident you had struggled to pull the words up from within yourself and commit them to paper. I have seen dentists extract teeth with more ease! Do not take this as a critique of your writerly skill, but rather as praise of the courage you showed in the writing, and now in the sharing. I remember how exposed I felt, sick and in distant lands, yet in that moment you dug deep within yourself and chronicled what you found there. I once likened your mind to a delicate instrument, as you remember, but the man who returned to me is something more. The well-honed lens is still a part of you, but so is the man who gives full credit to our more emotional selves.
“There was algae,” I continued at last, “all along the pond’s surface, around the stone-rim, but mostly it was green and clumpy. Near the jasmine-bush, though, I had recently noticed a different kind entirely, more blue and stringy than I’d seen before. And I’d heard Mother warning the gardener against using a certain chemical as fertilizer on her hydrangeas. I knew enough, from reading over Mycroft’s shoulders, to know certain chemicals had different effects on different strains of plants, encouraging the growth of some and killing off others entirely. And so, I remember thinking: this was much better than catching our gardener in the act, this was
, not so far from the other parts of my anatomy he had so recently laid claim to, was perhaps involuntary; as was the way I pushed back against his grasp, reveling in the pressure just
"So it would seem."
One spring day, as I sat writing a letter to my cousin Erin, the sound of breaking glass rang out against the morning's silence. I grumbled about the idleness of youth and took up my cane – more a tool for chasing our young vandals off than a support against the leg that had never quite recovered after the war, I told myself – and made my way out into the gardens. "Watson!" a voice gasped as soon as I came in sight of the greenhouse. Holmes stood hunched over against a table, massaging his throat and clearly struggling to breathe. My cane dropped to the garden path, clattered against the paving-stones, and I sprinted to the greenhouse like a man half my age.
So, to resume. I mentioned earlier, in my account of my dream, a certain Archduke Salvator. Perhaps you wonder at the name. I do not expect you to recognize it, for he has never featured in any of our shared investigations, nor is he well known enough to have rated a mention in an English paper. He is, instead, that rarest of all creatures: a nobleman with a scientific curiosity to rival my own, though his secret passions have always been mechanics while I favor chemistry and the science of deduction.
Do they have caves in Kandahar? I wonder.
I crumpled the sketches into a tight ball and threw them into the fire, watching them reduce to ash. My copy is gone; but my quiet admiration for the workmanship remains, an indelible image in my mind. This is the fruit of our age of science and reason: tools that can kill great numbers of people in the shortest amount of time possible. And I too must bear its mark. Am I not after all a great advocate of this same science?
You were a soldier, and one left injured far from home; perhaps you would understand.
Then came the necessary interviews: with the retired police inspector, who had dismissed so readily the possibility of an unapprehended intruder in Sneed’s mortuary; with the Widow Wellington, the neighbor from across the road who had seen a man matching the great Mister Dickens’s description, along with his odd companion dressed in a natty jumper and trousers and not much else. And of course with Augie Hudson, who asked after our health and his sister’s and then promptly directed us to Ian Lewis, a jack-of-all-trades at the very inn where we were staying, who had sold him the documents.
"Perhaps," Holmes said. "Well, Mister Lewis: I believe I am satisfied for the moment, though I may have more questions later. Will you give us the room for a few moments? I would discuss matters with Watson. And tell your master we would like to clarify a few points with him as well, when he will speak to us."
life, Holmes. Why is it so important to you to know? You have had other cases you could not solve before."
If I'd dreamed only of Death in the general sense, that would have hardly been surprising given my circumstances, but as I grew, my capricious mind instead insisted on devising dreams where I was the one struggling for my last breath. I dreamed of a harsh white sun above and desert sands beneath, glinting all around as I grasped at my shoulder and my blood dyed the sand nearest to me a deep red. I didn't think to say anything of it the next morning, for it was hardly the first time I'd dreamed of that particular demise. But the next night, I found myself ensconced in thread-bare velvets and surrounded by specimen bottles and artefacts that would tempt any archivist into envy, my trouser-leg gone wet with blood; and then the night after that, as if to complete the set, dreamed of standing among shattered glass with the cloying smell of rich flowers making my head spin as I gasped for breath against a throat grown tight, a cold east wind chilling me to the bone.
"Good man," Holmes said. He offered me a wry grin. "Are you sure I cannot tempt you into starting our journey early? If our clerk with the vampire-milkman is any indication, I could be persuaded to leave London tonight."
I must have murmured something – I certainly
"I had a way about me," Holmes said, whether in explanation or defense even now I am not sure. "I acted older than my age, and often had even myself fooled. And Sherrinford never laid a hand upon me. I would sit by the window and read to him. Dickens, clearly. I did the voices, you see; it drew him out of himself better than most anything else, and it gave me a raft to cling to. It was summer, and I had the afternoons to fill; or to be filled for me, at our mother’s insistence. I most remember the rooms being unbearably still, and wishing I could escape to my chemistry set."
Holmes opened his mouth again, as if to say something more, but then he closed it without further comment. "We were in Cornwall two years ago," I prodded him. "The Cornish Horror." Still Holmes walked in silence, his attention singularly focused on a goldfinch perched in a cypress-branch some small distance off. "You never mentioned that you had a brother."
Naturally suspicion had fallen on Mr. Sneed. They had been alone in the house. He was newly deceased, and strangulation such a sudden way to die; it seemed unlikely (said the police reports) that someone could have escaped while he lay dying, or slipped out of the house unnoticed before Mr. Sneed claimed to have found the corpse. And Sneed was an undertaker, grisly work. Men drawn to it often had a certain temperament, didn’t they? (I thought of my own father, a butcher who’d had the spark of insight to sell organs from the higher mammals to medical schools when human cadavers were not forthcoming. How rarely those reputations were well-earned!) But Sneed had no motive and quite a lot to lose by assaulting a grieving relative in his own house. And he was a quiet man by all counts: widowed, a regular parishioner at St. Mary’s. Respectable.
, Holmes," I insisted. "You really have so little regard for your own health, and for mine? Either there will be no effect of any kind after all these years, in which case we gain nothing; or else you risk a wholly unpredictable effect. We could well
“You’ll notice my more recent scars,” I said. “The after-effects of infection are much less common. Nearly nonexistent, I’d say.”
I nodded our agreement and thanks, and moved the tea-service to its more proper home on the now half-straightened table. Holmes, never one to leave a boundary untested or a last nerve untrodden, thought fit to issue her out in song:
(I fully admit I no longer have full right to that endearment. You have plighted your troth, and while I would not deny you your chance at that happy life, just now I find I am in desperate need. Let me be yours once more, if only in my mind. He must needs go that the devil drives.)
"The account -- our best source of information here, aside from the official reports which make Scotland Yard’s seem positively helpful -- is from the famous Charles Dickens."
“And what? Have you ever fought a goose?”
"Likely the gas has fully dissipated, after all these years, but if we could replicate -- "
Salvator stood behind me, and above, turning the gun in his hand and marveling at it. “Isn’t it a clever thing,” he said. “Note the cunning mechanics – one must only fire a bullet and a new one is loaded, nearly instantaneous! Truly there is little limit to what the well-governed mind can achieve.”
Ajua was true to her word, and a board that could serve as a lap-desk along with some small supply of paper was found; and I have been true to mine, and written out the letters I had previously only composed in my mind. Now there is nothing left to continue with my account. It is my turn to be the storyteller, it seems, and yours to serve as judge. The ‘features of interest,’ as you so often had me say, are these.
But when at last we came back to their village, I was confronted by my own luggage with the drawings of Salvator’s pistol secreted inside. I had spent a pleasant afternoon glibly refashioning the necessary components of a similar weapon, so absorbed in the geometry and physics of it that I was blinded to its intended purpose. A skilled artillery officer could fire hundreds of rounds with such a gun in a matter of minutes; they were merciless and efficient. So, too, was Salvator’s pistol that I had so admired.
“Yes,” I lied. “I will help you.” I would help them smash it to bits if I could; at a minimum I would find some component I could destroy beyond all hope of repairing. I needed these boys to show me the gun they’d found; I would never find the blasted thing on my own. So we went, and I did as I had planned. A shame how the firing pin was bent beyond all recognition and the box of gunpowder was somehow kicked into a nearby tidal pool.
,” I sometimes fall far short of the mark when it comes to the execution. When I saw those women in manacles, with one guard called down the pier and the other napping, I took my chance and liberated the key from their captor’s pocket. Never mind that there were perhaps two hundred yards of docks before those women could even hope to reach safety, or that the whole expanse was well-lit and with little enough cover where they could hide. You may applaud the impulse, but the probable efficacy of this little plan surely left much to be desired.
That earned a smile. She set the tea service in my as-yet-unoccupied chair, then crossed the room to deposit her parcel on the ottoman before Holmes’s chair by the fire. "Augie bought it from an innkeeper in town. Named it ‘rubbish’ so he got a good price, though of course he knew better. Said it might be of some literary note. Though" -- here she nodded at the VR etched in bullet-holes along the far wall, and I wondered how infamous that story was among her relations and friends -- "though it was the more criminal elements he thought might spare my sitting-room walls another assault."
It was not so surprising, then, when I felt the bullet shatter my clavicle, the harsh white sun above and the desert sands beneath, nor even when I fell ill again at Peshawar. I promised myself, then, that if I made it through and back to London I would get myself to Aberdeen as soon as I could. And I did just that, after I was settled in with Holmes and both my body and purse had recovered enough to make the trip. Once I had made it back to the house I'd grown up in, though, sitting across the table from my father and his new wife, I knew that while they may still be blood, I would never be more than a visitor there. That honor was reserved for a humble suite of rooms on Baker Street.
Beside me, slouched low in her chair beside my bed, I see Ajua is sleeping. Those images had seemed so true, but she is only asleep. Her chest rises and falls in shallow breaths, and almost imperceptibly over the breeze outside the window, I can just make out her snores. It was only a dream, I’m sure you would remind me. Ajua and doubtless Kofi are alive, as are you.
,’ and she’d gladly have played her part in the bit of excitement, if she’d been made aware."
…. Truly, how could I wish to be anywhere else?
“That particular opportunity never arose on the streets of Aberdeen,” he answered drily, though from my improved position I could see the good humor in his eyes.
One of the captives was knocked off the pier, and whether she drowned or was recaptured I never learned. The other two made it at least as far as the warehouses, so I hold out some hope they were able to escape. But the first’s splash into the water called back the guard who’d stepped away, and the pier as I said was well-lighted. I was spotted; seen; perhaps recognized. I had no way of knowing if these women had been seized off the street or if they’d perhaps been acquired through more legal means. Were they the victims of lawful commerce (for who knows better than you and I the great distance between
will welcome his account.
The dream is an old friend: not constant companion, perhaps, but familiar enough I truly should not still be caught so off-guard by those particular phantasms. Somehow, I still am. Most nights I would shake myself awake, gulp down a cup of cool water, brace myself at the window-sill until the night’s breeze could pull me back to the waking-world. But last night there was no water to be had, and when I tried to pull myself to my feet, I howled at the pain that shot through my broken leg. Just as well; I had slept under the open air, and even if I had a window-sill there would certainly be no cooling breezes in these tropical lands.
I pulled his wrist to my lips, enjoying the way his elbow bent so easily at my prodding. “Yes. ‘
Sherlock sat in silence, shaking his head in disbelief. "That sentimental fool," he said, then --almost as if hearing the words for the first time once they’d left his lips-- hurried to add: "I mean no disrespect, Watson. It is a noble thing, I’m sure, and it certainly did you honor. You are a medical man, after all. Well trained. But he had no
Holmes. Sherlock. My dearest. I offer them all to you, and other names beside; take whichever you most prefer.
"Cardiff," I repeated, as if tasting the word in my mouth. "Holmes, there is precisely nothing of interest in Cardiff." I could well understand his desire to leave London behind for a while; this new year, bringing with it a new century, had driven all of London’s least rational elements straight to our door, each one ready to attribute every creak in the attic floorboards to fae folk, disembodied spirits, or other agents supernatural. But there was Sussex, if he wished a change in location. Brighton. The Continent. Even Aberdeen; the future Mrs. Peter Watson would surely welcome a visit from the famous detective. If it were a professional obligation, he needn’t plan so far ahead, nor tempt me to Wales with talk of architecture. But there was perhaps one explanation.
"You wish to speak with Augie. Mrs. Hudson’s Augie; or his innkeeper-customer, perhaps." I smiled, wolf-like. "You found something in those papers. And they thought it would distract you in the absence of contemporary puzzles. What puzzle could possibly intrigue Sherlock Holmes? There is something -- criminal, in those papers, is there not?"
After Odessa I found myself without definitive leads, and thus, for the first time since our parting, without purpose. Van Dijk was not unknown in that city, and I told myself he was just the sort who might be useful to an international network like the Professor’s. He had a reputation for ruthlessness, a disdain for all vestiges of morality, and a skill at operating across national borders. Really, though, it was little more than a whim, and a chance to put some distance between those vast arrays of well-organized criminality. I took my chance and sailed for Takoradi as soon as I could book passage.
By Jove, though! What I would give for a gulp of water, cool or hot; or a steadying hand at my shoulder.
“Or five,” I objected.
I nodded. “But my mother was a proud woman, and there was too little coin and too many obligations to meet them all easily. She put a premium on appearances, and he I think was most himself when he was pottering around that workshop in well-patched slacks.” I felt myself shrugging, as if he’d needed justification for excluding me, at that age. “Mycroft he allowed in, as his school-work required. I suppose I thought they’d let me in too if I only had a reason.”
"Of course, sirs." Lewis rose to exit but paused at the door. "Perhaps it means nothing, but you told me to hold nothing back. It was the queerest thing. My uncle was one of the men who helped clear away the wreckage, looking for survivors that night after the mortuary exploded. A horrible business, to hear him describe it: limbs blown off their owners, and the smell of charred flesh all about.
"So you know, to Mr. Holmes, the smallest detail can often prove invaluable." Still he hesitated. He was too young to be a genuine suspect, of course, but he was certainly holding something back. "If there is anything you can add," I urged him, "something you might have thought trivial at the time perhaps, we would be most grateful."
This was not as macabre as it might at first seem. I was not blind to the true cost of illness and injury, the way a suffering body could torment even the most well-ordered mind, but I was also a butcher's son – and one with (I daresay) an uncommon gift for the natural sciences. If anything, my sensitivity on the first point drove me to turn an unflinching eye to places politer society would shy away from. I wanted to understand these bodies we were all bound to, and animals were not so dissimilar as to be useless to that task.
One day they brought me a metal gear, badly rusted and corroded but not so ruined I could not work out its original design. They asked for my help, and as van Dijk had given me frustratingly little to work with, I put off my planned errand in favor of helping them repair it. We traced out its shape and I taught them something of geometry, and together we fashioned a pair of makeshift compasses using twigs and twine so we could map out the proper dimensions of the gear before it had been most damaged. At the boys’ insistence I went with them to their blacksmith and we devised a gear of the right diameter, width, and shape that I thought stood a fair chance of functioning in place of the damaged component.
Lewis picked up a sheet and held it to the lamp. "No; we’ve had our own stock printed, blank but with a watermark in the corner. This looks to be Mr. Dickens’s own stock. Though the case you brought it in -- now that
"There. Are. No. Ghosts," Holmes said, punctuating each word with his fist against the wall. He rubbed peevishly at his temple; I would have to have Mrs. Hudson brew him some ginger-root tea, lest he reach for stronger medicines. "No spirits wandering the streets of Cardiff so they might see the great author. No, Watson: she was declared dead some six hours prior. No breath, no pulse, no movement in her eyes to suggest she was at all aware of those around her. I have her certificate of death from the police. If this case’s resolution lies beyond the established laws of nature, then how I’m to manage it, I’m quite unsure."
I was three the first time I dreamed of Death, and eight when I first dreamed of dying.
"So I thought, when he told me the story as a boy years later, perhaps his imagination was run away with him. But there were some details I couldn’t so easily dismiss. His two friends with whom he was sharing rooms, they all went in to that scene together. They all worked for the railway and so their watches were set to the station-clock, within a second of each other; yet when they came out of that house, my uncle’s was forty-seven seconds ahead, and his friends’ more than a minute behind: one minute seventeen for the one, and one minute thirty-two for the other’s. And they were all in good enough health before, but they all came out the worse, and in such different ways as well: blinding headaches for one, and the other coughing up green phlegm for a month. My uncle got the worst of it, his hand mangled as if it had been caught in a vise though he swore nothing of the sort had happened."
When my quarries were ensconced in more formal social circles such delays were often a necessary evil, as was the case in Budapest. There I suspected a gentleman art-dealer named Ivanov of selling antiquities smuggled out of Istanbul and Odessa. He seemed a likely intermediary between various Russian elements of our old friend’s criminal web. In this instance my suspicion was well-founded (indeed, correct), and Ivanov’s own enterprise was extensive enough, I could not simply lurk on the periphery as I had with van Dijk. No, to investigate him properly required a precise operation, and for that I needed information; hence, Mycroft, and even Mycroft could not assemble that information in a moment.
~*~*~*~*~*~
And he was equally dead come morning. A gas line had exploded in the mortuary, wreaking all manner of havoc on the town’s recently departed and leaving two fresh corpses to add to their number: Sneed with his head caved in from a fallen ceiling-beam, and Gwynneth apparently dead from the fire itself. Price had insisted Master Sneed simply could not have done what they said. That he’d not hurt a fly, much less Gwynneth, for all his dour ways, and that the lights had been flickering in recent weeks anyway. Likely there was something wrong with the gas. And with neither suspected killers nor witnesses left to interview, the official investigation had petered out rather quietly. Even so, thirty-nine years later, people still would talk.
