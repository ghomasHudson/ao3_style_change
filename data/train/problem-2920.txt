When he’s finished, he picks the two bowls up and moves to walk out of the kitchen, forcing Dean to give up his spot on his shoulder. As Cas moves out from behind the counter, Dean slaps his ass and follows him into the living room.
Dean takes one more look at himself in the mirror before getting up and shaking himself off. He can do this. He’s got his favorite lucky boots on, plus Bobby and Cas are right, he knows these songs like the back of his hand.
There's a late-night “can we try again?" call one of us wants to make
Cas obeys, but he goes slow, keeping his eyes on Dean to make sure he’s enjoying himself.
Sam backs up against the wall and slides down, sitting with his knees up to his chest and burying his face in his hands.
“No comment,” he says as he turns to follow Cas into the car waiting for them.
He strokes himself to the same rhythm and he's already really close.
“Don’t say that. This isn’t your fault, Dean. You did everything you could to keep it secluded,” Sam pauses for a moment before saying, “did he ever tell you why? I mean other than the usual reasons.”
“Bart!” She yells into the house, “Castiel is here!”
” Cas says back.
He looks around and sees that the couch is empty. Maybe Cas moved into his bed last night after Dean fell asleep?
He looks her up, meets her eyes, and smiles back.
Night two of the Cancun tour goes just as well as night one, if not better. Dean is on cloud nine after their set and he can’t stop smiling. He decides that he and Cas aren’t going to stay for Luke’s whole performance tonight, so after about two songs, he tells everyone that they’re headed out.
Nah there ain't no in between, when it comes to him and me
“Did I say something wrong?” Jack asks Sam.
“You’re not welcome here, dad,” Sam says.
“Yeah,” Dean clears his throat as well, “Bobby’s wife, Jody, made it. She’s amazing, it’ll be the best damn apple pie you’ve ever tasted.”
“Wanna take this upstairs?” Dean whispers against Lee’s lips.
He sits in his car for a moment, running a hand over his face. Then he pulls his phone out of his pocket and checks his notifications. He sees a few missed texts from Cas. Shit, he told Cas he’d text him back later.
“Oh, I think I can handle it.”
“I don’t know but we’re gonna figure it out because that’s what you do when you love someone. You don’t just give up on them,” Dean says.
He watches out the window as Cas drives away, trying to replay the events of the night in his head to figure out what’s bothering Cas, but aside from not spending more time with him, he can’t think of anything.
“Damn right. I’ve got more contr-fffffuck,” Dean arches his back and bites down hard on his bottom lip as he comes.
“Well, I wasn’ plannin’ on comin’ here. But drunk…yeah,” Dean’s face falls a little.
Dean’s eyes are closed and he’s moaning Cas’ name along with other obscenities. Cas relaxes completely, satisfied that Dean is no longer uncomfortable, in a bad way, at least.
“Yeah, Dean, give us the juicy details!” Storme pries.
Dean leans over and kisses Cas’ lips. Cas turns his body so he’s facing Dean, keeping his eyes closed as Dean kisses him again.
Dean puts his hands over his face and groans.
The kids climb off of him and he sits up, breathing heavy.
“Good thing it wouldn’t be an imposition then,” Dean counters.
“Oh, come in, come in. Sorry, I, uh, sorry,” Cas says as he steps back to let Dean inside.
He pours the coffee out into the sink and rinses the cup out. He quickly gets dressed in the clothes he had on yesterday and heads home.
One of us sleeps good, and one of us hates to face the night
“What the hell, Bobby?”
Dean looks at Cas softly for a moment before remembering he hasn’t said anything yet.
“Alright, well I gotta get going,” Dean says as he starts to get up.
Trigger Warning// Conversation about HIV. The conversation is brief, it's right after Dean and Cas get home from the diner. It's not bad, it's just an uncomfortable topic so if anyone would like to avoid it altogether, you have been warned lol.
“Alright, so what’s she like? Jewelry? You can never go wrong with jewelry.”
“I just put it to music. The song practically wrote itself.”
Cas stops what he’s doing and looks down at Dean, “are you really not ready or are you still being stubborn about bottoming?”
I had to, I just had to
On Dean’s way out of the studio, he pulls his phone out of his pocket. Several texts from Bobby, Sam, and his band’s group chat and two missed calls, one from Benny and one from an unknown number. He immediately taps the unknown number and puts it up to his ear as it starts to ring.
“What?” Dean asks, turning his whole body in the seat to face him.
Dean nods and shakes himself off. They head back out on stage and Benny picks his guitar up off the stand. Dean apologizes to the crowd and they cheer.
The whole bar cheers as Dean takes a breath between the chorus and the next verse. He’s surprised the song is receiving this kind of reaction considering he wrote it in a day. This song isn’t on the album. In fact, Dean hasn’t sung this in front of anyone before, not even Bobby or his band. But they’re loving it, so he jumps into the bridge full force,
“Benny’s just an affectionate person, Cas,” Dean cuts him off. “Benny’s as straight as an arrow. Trust me, he’s not interested in me like that.”
Once they’ve finished eating, they go for a walk along the beach. They walk up and down the beach for a while and it feels like hours have passed. Then they watched the sun go down as they sat in the sand near some dimly lit wooden torches.
“I was,” Dean says in a low voice.
“Benny, you ask me that every time y’all come in here and it’s the same damn thing every time. Burgers, wings, and beer. That’s it, so you gonna order, or are you gonna keep acting like a dumbass?” The woman glared at him.
“Sam’s been with him every day, making sure he knows he’s not alone,” Jess says, glancing at Dean. It’s so quick, yet so subtle, if he’d blinked, he would’ve missed it.
“Until you,” Castiel says.
“I don’t know, man. Something’s goin’ on with Cas,” Dean takes another sip of his beer. “He was all cagey last night leaving the party and he didn’t say a word the entire ride back to my house. Then, the weirdest part, he went
Dean rolls his eyes and shakes his head. The snark would normally turn him on a little if he wasn’t so irritated with the topic at hand.
Cas knocks on Dean’s door just after seven.
They pull up to Cas’ building and he stumbles out of the car. Dean asks the driver to give him a few minutes as he jumps out after Cas.
They spend the rest of the night talking, laughing, and drinking. They talk about the album releasing in a couple of weeks. Sam, Cas, and Jess talk legal shit while Dean and Benny sit there completely lost. They talk about random things too like who they think is going to win the Titans vs Redskins game on Sunday. Overall, Dean ends up having a much better time than he’d expected for this night to go.
“I’m sure. If worrying about how the rest of them will respond is the biggest thing holding me back, then I need to address it in order to move forward with you.”
“You’re insane, Baby is a classic. She’s perfect just the way she is. Besides, a car should drive, Sam, it doesn’t need all of this extra bullshit,” Dean argues.
Cas laughs and wraps his arms around Dean’s waist, resting his chin on his shoulder.
Dean steps out of the bathroom in what looks to be a pair of jeans and a t-shirt that haven’t been washed yet, after one or two wears.
“I’m really proud of you,” he says, lifting Dean’s chin up with his finger.
“Castiel?” John says, making a face, “where’d your folks come up with a sissy name like that?” he laughs.
“Dean?” A man’s voice comes through the other end of the phone.
“Hm,” Sam says furrowing his brow a little, “we’re here.”
“Nice of you both to finally join us,” Bobby says. “Everybody ready to go?”
Cas squeezes Dean’s hand, smiling at him as he walks away and then turning his attention back to Sam.
“Yes ma’am, I’m his son, Dean Winchester.”
Sam looks up at Dean and then he stands to hug his older brother for what feels like ages.
“Sam has court in the morning, Dean. He needs to be well rested,” Jess says, glaring at Dean in a way that looks innocent, but Dean can tell there’s underlying sharpness to it.
“I postponed the tour,” Bobby says. This catches Dean’s attention.
“Dean, I-“ he starts.
Dean didn’t realize he was crying until he’s standing and trying to catch his breath.
Dean puts his hand on Cas’ knee under the table as Cas continues.
He wracks his brain trying to piece everything together, but the last thing he remembers clearly was whooping Crowley’s ass on their 5
“I try not to imagine any of that happening, Dean. We did get very lucky,” Cas says, placing his hand on Dean’s knee.
The truth is, Dean doesn’t really know what happened. He remembers going to the strip club. He also vaguely remembers getting a lap dance from a stripper. After that, it’s fuzzy.
“Well, I’ll be damned. What are you boys doing in here on a Thursday night?” A raspy voice asked from behind the bar.
Dean goes nearly a week without speaking to Cas. Ignoring any messages and any calls he gets from him. He spends most of his time with Bobby and the band, working on tour details for the one they’re planning next fall. Benny asks him about Cas a couple times, but Dean tells him to drop it each time, so Benny finally stops asking.
,” Dean says again, this time with a little more emphasis.
Dean laughs, nearly choking on the food in his mouth.
“It was fun though,” Lee smiles at him, “just like old times, right down to you being first.” He winks.
“I’m sorry, Cas. It truly wasn’t something I was aware that you were uncomfortable with at the time. When we met, I didn’t know you weren’t out. Hell, I didn’t even know you were straight. Not the way you had me pinned up against your bedroom door with your tongue down my throat and your knee between my legs,” Dean teases.
“That’s me,” Dean flashes her a sloppy, drunk smile.
When he steps onto the bus, instead of the normal whooping and cheering that usually occurs when he enters the bus, he’s met with silent stares of concern and pity. He tosses his bag onto one of the couches and makes his way to one of the bunk beds where he stays until they get back to Nashville.
“Dean, you don’t have to,” Cas says.
Sam pulled Dean to the side earlier while he was cooking to let him know that he’s not planning on proposing to Jess this morning because he wants it to be more private, but he assured Dean that it’s definitely going to be today.
“I’m meeting a guy here. Took him home the other night and we made out, but I hadn’t heard from him until about half an hour ago when he called and asked me to meet him here,” Dean says.
“Mr. Winchester is in the intensive care unit, only relatives are allowed to see him at this time. Are you a relative?”
A tear falls down Dean’s cheek as he gets up and leaves the room. He doesn’t say another word.
“Cwaire!” AG yells, running into her arms.
“What the hell was that?” Dean asks, annoyed.
As he pulls his jeans off, he realizes he’s still half hard, so he kicks his boxers off and makes his way into the bathroom to jerk himself off in the shower.
than one.”
“That’s not the-,” Cas stops and buries his face in his hands.
Dean is silent. He’s awake, but he can’t bring himself to care about anything anymore. So, what if the world is ending? His already has.
“I’m listening, Dean,” Cas answers, still not looking up from the menu.
“Snooping through my drawers, now, are we?” Cas says playfully, putting the sweatpants on.
Benny’s face falls, but he gets it. He tells Dean to take the limo back to the hotel and that they’ll catch a cab back later. Dean thanks him for the lap dance and heads out.
“Si, por favor,” Dean answers and the waiter begins pouring the red wine into two glasses.
“Not everyone’s childhood is all sunshine and rainbows, Cas. It is what it is. It shaped me, in a way, into who I am. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not giving that bastard credit for making me who I am. But the shit I dealt with, I made myself who I am because of that shit.”
Cas stares at Dean with a smile on his face as Dean watches the waiter.
“Nothing, it’s fine. I’m good,” Cas says as he leans in to kiss Dean.
“C’mon Dean, we’re in
Cas is looking at Dean with so much concern and pity on his face, Dean thinks there might even be a hint of guilt in there for pressing him about the bruise.
“I already told you, you were amazing,” Cas smiles down at him.
“Yeah,” Dean laughs, “yeah, it’s not about anyone I’m seeing. I don’t know what to say, I met someone in a bar a few nights ago and the whole thing just kind of sparked a few good lines.”
He groans as he rolls over to turn his phone back on. The notifications start rolling in and he immediately searches for Cas’ name.
“I, um, I made garlic bread, but, uh, I kind of burned it,” Cas says, looking down at his feet.
“I can’t say for certain right now. After surgery, I’ll know more. Excuse me,” he says, turning to leave.
“They’re fine, no worries,” Cas signs back to her. “Come in, please.”
Dean closes his eyes and throws his head back, “I, uh…fuck. Okay,” he gives in. She gets up and holds her hand out, waiting for him to take it so she can lead him into a back room.
They both get up to leave and Dean pays the tab, of course not without multiple objections from Cas claiming it’s his turn.
“Just…don’t be John, Dean,” Benny says, leaving Dean by himself.
“Castiel Novak,” the man replies, seeming to have no recognition of Dean’s name.
“I missed you so much!” Claire says. “Can you say hi to Kaia?”
“Castiel,” Cas says plainly, ignoring John’s outstretched hand.
“I, uh,” Dean thinks, still looking down at his cast. “I don’t know.”
“My invitation musta got lost in the mail,” John slurs.
“And when he found out I’m bi?” Dean looks so broken, like something fragile just shattered inside of him. “That I’m not the, the perfect image of a son? That right there pretty much just sealed the deal for him and me. I was fifteen when he caught me kissing a boy in the woods behind our house,” Dean’s quiet for a while as he tries to keep it together. “I was out of school for a week and a half because, uh, because he beat me so bad that he didn’t want me showing up to school like that to raise questions.”
“Can you say something please?” Cas pleads.
“Dean,” Castiel starts as Dean opens his eyes and stares at the ceiling, making an ‘o’ shape with his mouth and breathing heavily.
He stumbles into the living room, visibly drunk, and Dean and Sam jump up immediately.
Once everyone is in position, Sam begins the summoning spell. Within seconds, Chuck is standing before them. Dean rushes him and stabs an angel blade into his back. He doesn’t even flinch.
“Cas?” Dean says, sprinting towards him as if he couldn’t get there fast enough.
Dean laughs and gets out of bed. Cas is off today so he doesn’t blame him for not wanting to get up early. He jumps in the shower and then heads out to meet Bobby.
Dean stumbles backwards and he sees Cas jump up to his defense, but Dean puts his hand up, telling Cas not to engage.
“That’s just it, I don’t know. I asked him but all he said was ‘it’s fine’," he says, mimicking Cas' gravelly voice. "Like, whatever happened was fine, but he wouldn’t tell me what
“Oh, good. You’re up,” Cas says, walking up behind Dean to kiss him on his shoulder.
Dean doesn’t know what to say. He’s always sort of known he was attracted to both men and women. Even when he was younger, and his dad tried to ingrain in him that boys like girls, not other boys whenever he expressed interest in someone of the same sex. It was never something he struggled with internally, only externally with others.
Cas. He wants to explore every nook and cranny of Castiel’s body. But then something dawns on him.
“I don’t know. If, uh, if it’s okay with you, I would like to explore this,” Castiel suggests.
Bobby has been texting and calling him nonstop to schedule rehearsal dates for the tour that’s rapidly approaching. Benny has called and texted a few times and so has Sam. But Dean’s not in the mood to talk to anyone other than Cas, so he just isn’t. That is until Sam and Benny show up to his house unannounced (or maybe announced, who knows. It’s not like he’s been checking their messages).
“Make a wish,” Cas says.
“Happy birthday, brother,” Benny wraps an arm around Dean’s shoulder. “28, huh? How’s it feel to be old?”
Ash is pretty firm in this idea of a medley, for some reason. Dean, however, is pretty certain he doesn’t want to do one, but in order to move on from the conversation, he tells Ash to go ahead and rework it and he’ll take a listen.
Benny knocks on Dean’s door around nine in the morning. When there’s no answer, he lets himself inside and heads up to Dean’s bedroom.
Cas notices the slight shift in Dean’s demeanor. He looks up at him and smiles, then he wraps his arm around Dean’s waist and squeezes, letting Dean know that he’s okay with this.
“They’re a good-looking couple. I don’t blame you,” Cas responds as Dean lets out a quiet sigh of relief.
“Dean, this place is huge. Don’t you live alone?”
Dean’s stomach flips. He hadn’t pegged Cas for the kinda guy who listens to country music. He would’ve guessed classical, jazz maybe.
“Is everything okay?” Cas asks, concern beginning to spread across his face.
Cas doesn’t say anything, he waits for Dean to continue.
“See you later, Dean,” Cas says as he shuts the door and rushes into the building.
“So, presents first or breakfast?” Dean asks.
“I’m really sorry, Dean,” Sam says, watching as Dean grabs a bag of peas from Sam’s freezer.
I’m so terrified of the world knowing…,” he trails off.
“No worries, man. We’ve all been there. Good to have you back in the studio. Song’s almost over, then I’ll introduce you and start the interview. Sound good?” Storme asks.
“Bud Light, my favorite,” Castiel replies, matter of factly. Dean laughs and wiggles two of his fingers to signal to Ellen that he’ll have one as well.
Dean sets down the spatula in his hand and walks over to them. He puts a hand on her back and kisses her on the nose.
Dean sucks in a breath at the cold touch, then he grab’s the back of Cas’ neck and pulls him in closer.
“Sounds like a plan,” Sam says.
“Yes.”
“I get caught up in my cases sometimes, please feel free to stop me whenever I go into too much detail,” Castiel says, as he gets up from the table, “I’m going to get the spaghetti.”
Dean slides his hand up the back of Lee’s shirt and Lee moans at the touch of Dean’s fingertips against his skin.
“Alright, we ready to get rid of this cosmic douchebag for good?” He claps, walking over to the freshly made pot of coffee on the counter. He pauses for a moment, remembering all the times Cas would sit with him in the mornings while he drank his coffee. Even if Dean was acting like a grumpy asshole, Cas never seemed to mind.
“Hm? Oh, yeah, that sounds good Dean,” Cas says in a sleepy voice.
Tell me everything ‘til there’s nothing I don’t know about you”
“Now, Dean, didn’t Castiel tell you? We’re huggers in this family,” she says, holding her arms out. “Come on, bring it in.”
. He laughs at the design but throws it on anyway.
They pull into the parking lot of a little hole in the wall sandwich place that Bobby used to take them to when they first moved to Nashville. Sam hopes the memory will boost Dean’s mood a bit.
It’s a bittersweet victory. As much as Dean would rather top, he was kind of digging the idea of letting Castiel take control. Oh well, this means there has to be a next time since Cas so desperately wants to top, too.
Dean looks him up and down for a moment. His hair is longer than he remembers and he’s bulked up a little more since the last time they’d seen each other, almost ten years ago. But he looks good. Damn, does he look good.
Castiel laughs and raises a wooden spoon with sauce on it up to Dean’s face. He blows on it and motions for Dean to taste it.
“I got it earlier that day. My, uh, my jaw connected with my old man’s fist,” Dean says, laughing it off to try and hide how hard this is for him to talk about. Cas looks him in the eye, concern spreading across his face again. “I didn’t wanna say that because, because it begs the question of ‘why’, right?”
He walks out of the bathroom and glances at the clock. It’s a quarter after 3 so he should probably get ready. He does the same song and dance as last night, trying on different shirts and pants before settling on a pair of dark wash jeans and a gray Henley.
“Not too late to turn around, Cas,” Dean suggests.
Cas hasn’t looked up from his menu at all since Dean started talking and he kind of wants to look Cas in the eye when he tells him the news.
“Here, lemme do it,” Cas says, noticing Dean’s trouble with the machine. “You pop the pod in, push the lever down, click start and it brews it for you.”
Dean stands there with his arms crossed awkwardly across his chest as Benny sits up in the bed and stretches.
“Nah, nah I didn’t sleep in it last night, apparently,” Dean laughs. “He’s gonna look for it and get it back to me when he finds it,” he shrugs.
They make their way to the end of the carpet and then they’re escorted to their seats. Cas is sitting with Sam and Jess, Bobby and Jody, Ash’s wife, and a woman Benny met a few weeks ago that he practically begged Bobby to get a ticket for. Angela is her name…or maybe Andrea. Something like that.
“His dad’s a preacher, he grew up in church. He’s just scared of his family finding out, even if he is hundreds of miles away…,” Dean trails off and then, “oh, fuck.”
“Yeah,” Cas chuckles again, “yeah it’s definitely not the best couch in the world. I was gonna ask you if you wanted to move to my bed last night, but you looked so peaceful, I didn’t want to wake you.”
He sighs and decides to shoot Cas a quick text, just in case.
“Look, Dean,” Meg shoots back, noticing his name on his visitor tag as well, “I’m not the doctor so I can’t give you any more information. You’re gonna have to wait for him to get out of surgery.”
“We’re heading out today. Supposed to be this morning, but I’ll tell Bobby to give you a little more time.”
“Damn, Cas,” Dean says, breathlessly.
He hooks his arms under Cas’ armpits, resting his hands on each of Cas’ shoulders and his head on top of his right hand.
Castiel smirks and wets a wash cloth to wipe them both down.
“Everybody ready?” A woman with a clipboard and a headset asks, peering her head around the doorframe.
“Should. Bottom shelf,” Benny says. “Little early for a drink though, huh?”
“Uh, hmm,” Dean stutters, looking down at the dark brick, “well, Cas, usually my old man’s trick works, but, uh, I think this one might be a little too far gone.”
“Dean, I told you, you don’t have to cook tonight. It’s your birthday dinner. Eileen and I can handle it,” Cas says.
Colette comes back over and sets their drinks down while she takes their order down in her head.
After their shower, Dean heads back to the kitchen to start on breakfast while Cas goes to wake up Alma Grace.
“Mind if I ask what ya do?” Dean pries.
Dean’s silent for a moment. He knows better than to bring up Mary Winchester in front of his dad. Sam knows better, too. But that doesn’t make it okay for John to react the way he does.
“How long have you and Castiel Novak been together?” The reporter asks again, shoving a microphone in Dean’s face.
“Aw, where’s El?” Benny asks.
Dean smiles and looks down at his feet.
I fully intend on topping next time, so prepare for that however you see fit,” Castiel surrenders.
“Sorry,” he says, “here’s one.”
“Your dad is bleeding internally. That’s all I can really tell you, you’re gonna have to wait for his doctor,” she finally says.
Dean kisses him back, reaching his good hand up to grip Lee’s long hair while the other rests on his waist.
“I’m good Dean, what about you? It feels like we haven’t seen each other in forever!” She says in a slight British accent.
Cas can’t argue with him there. He goes to put the DVD into the blue-ray while Dean makes himself comfortable on the couch.
Cas laughs and brings Dean’s hand up to his face to kiss his fingers.
“Merry Christmas, Sammy,” Dean smiles and hugs his little brother. “Merry Christmas, Jess.”
Dean pulls back into the parking lot of Cas’ office just before two.
When Dean finally stops crying, he pulls off of Cas, wiping his eyes with his hands.
They pull into the parking lot of a local diner about 15 minutes later. Cas follows Dean inside, keeping a reasonable distance between them.
Dean’s cab pulls up to his house around two in the afternoon. He thanks the driver and heads inside.
“Are you sleeping with Benny?” Cas blurts out, breaking the awkward silence.
“I hope you like spaghetti,” Cas says, breaking the awkward silence, “it’s really the only thing I know how to make.”
Castiel swallows his food and looks up at Dean,
“I’m sorry, Cas,” Dean says honestly.
“Fuck,” he breathes out.
“To be continued,” Dean says as he pulls away, walking over to greet them.
“That’s awesome, Cas,” Dean smiles at him and leans in to kiss him.
“I don’t know. Something about bleeding and they need him to get his strength up before they can operate so he needs to not be around anything stressful,” Sam says.
“I brought your clothes back,” Cas says, holding up a gym bag. “I washed them, that’s why I’m a little late.”
Dean leaves the note and the pen on Cas’ kitchen counter, grabs his jacket, and heads back down to the lobby. He pulls out his phone to call for a cab when he sees a missed call from Benny, so he decides to call him back first.
“I’m staying here. I have a court date on the 24th, so I elected to miss family Christmas this year.”
“No, no, uh, it wasn’t you,” Dean says, giving Cas no other explanation.
“I know we said that, but-,”
Dean apologizes for what happened and Sam, like Cas, assures him that it wasn’t his fault.
“With…,” Dean prompts.
“Yeah, Cas, it’s okay, but uh, I was kinda thinkin’ we could…you know, before Sam and Jess get back,” Dean says.
to perform? This is something he’s been dreaming about for years and now it’s actually happening?
“C’mon, buy me a drink,” he says as they walk towards the bar.
“It’s okay, Sammy. I’m on my way,” Dean says as he gets back in the Impala and heads to Nashville General.
“Uh, yeahhhhh? When were you gonna tell me?” Sam asks, in an accusatory tone.
They walk up to the door and Cas knocks three times. A few seconds later, a small woman with silver hair wearing a flour dusted apron opens the door and her face lights up.
Dean clears his throat as he stands up and allows Cas to pass by him to head into the bathroom. He kicks a pair of boxers over his mess and follows.
“I thought I was-,” Dean can’t find the words he wants to say. “I-I thought I was okay…enough to perform that song, at least. I, uh, I wasn’t,” his voice cracks, “I’m not.”
Dean shoots him a look and Benny makes an apologetic look back.
“Dean, cut it out!” Sam scolds, pressing the button again to close the roof, “I like my car. You need to update the Impala. Or better yet, upgrade it.”
“Tested?” Cas asks, caught off guard.
“Me and the guys fiddled around a little in prep for the Grammy’s, we played pool, got drunk, you know. Ended up gettin’ real late so rather than drive home drunk, I just slept at Benny’s, which is why I didn’t get your letter ‘til this morning when I got home.”
“Are you sure?”
“So,” Castiel starts, “you mentioned the other night that you moved here to pursue a music career?”
“I don’t know about master chef,” she says, “but I think I can handle a birthday dinner.”
“This is where you live?” Cas says in awe.
“Hey, Lee. How ya been?” Dean snaps out of his trance and pulls him into a hug.
“Well aren’t ya gonna introduce me to your guests?” John asks him.
“What can I say, Sammy? Your big brother’s movin’ on up in the world,” he says as he throws a sloppy smile Sam’s way.
Dean grabs a beer out of the fridge before heading upstairs and slamming his bedroom door.
“Hmph,” Dean grunts.
“Keep goin’, you finish,” Dean says, out of breath.
“Look, Cas, I-I’ve never bottomed before,” Dean says, shyly.
When Dean gets out of the studio around 12:30, he shoots Cas a text.
“Anytime, brother,” Benny grins as he lays back down in his bed and closes his eyes, “anytime.”
“It is, but I don’t want a lecture. I overreacted at the studio. It-,” he hesitates, “the situation was more complicated than I realized.”
“Dean!” Benny yells from outside on stage.
Dean pushes his index finger into Cas. Cas tenses up at the sudden pressure, but then he relaxes himself. Dean leans up and kisses him again.
The giant curtain opens up and all Dean sees is lights. He’s used to that. He can sort of see the first few rows of people, mostly made up of fans because they’re not on the center stage. He relaxes a little. He’s got this.
“What the hell, come on,” Dean says as he holds the door for Benny to walk out with him.
“Yeah?” Dean answers, realizing he and Cas left a trail of clothes from the door to their bed. His face grows hot and he runs his hand over the back of his neck before he starts picking up each article of clothing. “Oh, sorry about that.”
“We, uh,” Dean closes his eyes as Diamond begins unbuttoning his shirt. “We were t’gether for, uh, for seven months.” Diamond starts kissing and nibbling at his chest and down his abdomen.
As Dean walks over, the curly haired woman across from Charlie sees him and a huge smile appears on her face.
Dean smiles as he stands in the doorway awkwardly, looking everywhere but Cas’ face when it dawns on Cas,
“My place?” Cas whispers with a shy smile.
“That song?” Cas’ tone changes, he’s angry now too. “Do you really fucking think that’s how it is? You think I’ve already moved on? Really, Dean?”
He and Cas just sit there in silence for a long time. Dean’s actually grateful for the silence because he needs a minute to put himself back together.
Dean finishes the last few lines of the song and they all take a bow as the crowd cheers.
Dean hates to admit this to himself, but he’s kind of jealous. He never had experiences like that with his dad.
“That’s not what I said, I-,” Dean groans as he rubs his hands over his face. “Benny and I are not sleeping together, Cas. The only person I’m sleeping with is you,” Dean says, taking a step towards Cas again.
Cas doesn’t answer. Dean knows something is still wrong, but he doesn’t want to fight with him this early in the day. Well, this early in his day, at least.
Castiel laughs, much to Dean’s relief. Sam has always told him that his sense of humor is one people need to get used to. It never really mattered to him if people didn’t understand his jokes until he saw the look on Cas’ face after he cut him off.
Dean closes his eyes for a moment and then blows out the candles.
“Alright, Imma be the one to ask the awkward question no one seems to wanna ask. Sam, how’s your daddy doin’,” Benny says.
“Yeah, yeah he does,” Sam says. “Dean’s a natural born performer. He’s always been the center of attention for as long as I can remember.”
“Christ, Dean,” Benny says as he shakes his head.
Dean laughs, and they lay there for a moment until the come gets tacky and starts to dry.
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
“You gonna actually come in, or…?” Dean jokes, eyebrows raised.
“Always know how to make a guy feel good about himself, Ben,” Dean says sarcastically as he claps Benny on the back with his good hand.
Dean whistles when he sees Cas.
“Got inna fight,” he responds. He doesn’t think the doctor needs to know the fight was with a wall.
Sam rubs a hand over his face.
Dean cuts him off.
Dean knocks on the door and Cas opens not even two seconds after.
“Absolutely,” Cas says as he raises his beer. Sam laughs and hits his beer against Cas’.
“We should clean up,” Cas says into Dean’s mouth.
“No, no it’s cool, I, uh,” Dean pauses for a moment and looks down at his feet. “My mom was religious so I grew up around it…,” he pauses again.
'Cause one of us can't even think about bein' in another's arms
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
“I knew I wasn’t ready for this, I knew. I never should’ve tried to push myself into being okay with it before I was ready,” he says.
A few minutes later, he walks into the kitchen with a half asleep four year old on his hip.
“Dean…Dean, Dean, Dean I-I’m gonna, I’m so fucking close, I-,” Cas warns between breaths.
He wraps an arm around Cas’ waist and brings the other up to rest behind Cas’ head in response.
He fumbles with the buckle on his jeans, but Cas takes over and slides them off, leaving Dean in just his boxers.
“I-I don’t know,” Dean says, pulling out his phone and searching his name. Dozens of articles come up, all with headlines claiming to know the identity of Dean’s ‘mysterious lover’. He clicks on one of the articles and sees pictures of him and Cas on their date in Mexico. Their date that was supposed to be private.
The first few cords begin to play and the entire crowd starts screaming and cheering. From backstage, Cas feels bumps raise on his arms and on the back of his neck. He knows exactly what song this is.
He knows it shouldn’t bother him, Cas doesn’t do it to offend him, but he can’t help but selfishly wish Cas would come to terms with his sexuality already so Dean can just be flirty and hold his hand and kiss him and wrap his arms around him in public.
“Oh, yeah, of course. Dean can give you my number, right Dean?” Cas turns to him.
“Don’t take off the blindfold yet,” Dean says, guiding Cas to their destination.
“…That she reminds me of mom…” Sam adds, “And, well, you know how he gets when we mention mom. Anyway, we were arguing, and I said that he didn’t have to always shut down conversations about mom. That we can still talk about her and our memories of her. And I guess he just kind of lost it. Started throwing anything within arms reach and I tried to grab something from him to stop him from chucking it across the room and he jerked his arm out of my hands and elbowed me in the eye. You walked in when he was about to take his second swing at me,” Sam finishes, looking defeated.
Cas nods and Dean kisses him before getting up and walking over to his closet.
Sam sighs, “I was just telling him about Jess, ya know? How she’s smart, funny, beautiful…” Sam trails off.
Instead, he wraps his hands around Lee’s face to pull him in for another kiss, only this time, he’s walking him back up against the wall.
Cas follows Dean into the living room and they sit down on Dean’s large leather couch.
“Locking Chuck away must’ve brought everyone back,” Sam says, a huge smile spreading across his face.
“I know…I said…I’d let you…top but…” Dean tries to get his words in, in between kisses and then Cas pulls away.
“Couldn’t get any more than you did. Said we gotta wait for the doc to get out of surgery,” Dean says as he sits down next to Sam outside the hospital room door.
“I genuinely have no recollection of this conversation,” Cas says, sitting up in the bed, “why the hell would I turn down shower sex?”
No answer.
“Good thing I won’t either, then,” Dean grins, sucking a mark into Cas’ neck.
“Ready,” Dean manages to get out in between kisses.
He heads into his kitchen and pulls a beer out of the fridge. Before opening it, he checks the oven clock. 2:30. Eh, late enough in the day. He pops the cap off and tosses it onto the counter.
Sam has a point. Dean hasn’t let it go. He has no idea why he’s so hung up on this guy he just met. Something about him just caught Dean’s attention and he can’t seem to think about anything, any
“You’re the first man I’ve ever been attracted to, Dean. And I didn’t call because…because I wasn’t sure-I’m not sure-what that means,” Castiel continues.
Dean unlocks his front door and kicks his boots off in the foyer. He hangs his jacket by the door and sets his keys in the little bowl Sam bought him for Christmas a few years back. ‘You’re always forgetting where you put your keys,’ Sam would criticize, so he bought him something to set by the front door to make sure he doesn’t leave them in random places anymore.
He pulls out his phone and opens the messages between him and Cas.
“I don’t know how to do this,” he says almost in tears.
“Dean,” Cas moans, “I’m-, fuck, yes, Dean, I’m good. Harder.”
“It’s not stupid if it upset you. What happened?”
“Yeah, man, m’sorry. Met a guy at the bar, brought ‘im home.”
“Hey, look, I really do have more control than I did when I was 17. You just…I don’t know, it’s probably because I was shit faced,” Dean says in his defense.
“Thanks, Sammy. Good to see you,” Dean says, pulling himself up off the floor. “Hey, Eileen. How are you?” He signs as he speaks.
I know you got my heart beatin’ in this bar
Cas is silent for what feels like forever. Dean has a lump in his throat. He shouldn’t have let Cas kiss him again. Cas was drunk, he didn’t know what he was doing.
Dean laughs and hugs him back.
Dean tangles his fingers in Cas’ hair, kissing him so deeply, you would guess he’d been planning it for years.
Dean smiles at him.
to finish our conversation,” John taunts.
“Holy fucking shit, are you serious?” Dean says, barely able to contain his excitement.
Once Dean is three fingers deep, he asks Cas if he’s ready. He nods, and Dean rolls the condom on and positions himself at the entrance of Cas’ hole.
“Pancakes?” The little girl asks, perking her head up.
“They get better every day,” he grins. “I’m gonna go take a shower. Care to join me?”
Dean blushes even more now.
Dean shoots a text to Benny before locking his phone and hopping in for a quick shower.
“Woah, woah, Cas. We’re eating here, man,” Dean says.
The doctor sighs as he looks at Sam and then at Dean.
“You got it.” The waitress winks and walks away to put in Dean’s order.
“Positive,” Dean smiles.
“Sure,” Dean clears his throat, “uh, where do you want to meet?”
Cas smiles fondly at him and Dean squeezes his side.
“If you say so,” Dean says, doubtful.
“I’m gonna step out onto the balcony for a minute,” Cas says to the room.
“Hey, Cas. Nice apron,” Claire jokes.
“That’s really awesome,” MC says.
He still hasn’t spoken to Castiel, despite his continuous efforts to reach out to him. Now that he’s about to leave for his tour, there’s nothing he would rather do less since Cas won’t be going with him this time.
“Man,” Dean starts before he takes a big, long swig of a Pabst Blue Ribbon. “Trust me, I need it.”
“Steak, baked potatoes, veggies. Steaks are on the grill out back, come on,” Dean says.
It quickly dawns on Dean that this may be more affection than Cas is willing to display, so he moves his arm from Cas’ waist and brings it up to brush the back of his neck.
“Work,” Castiel replies.
“What, Dean? I said I’m listening,” Cas finally looks up at him, slightly annoyed.
“Hear that? Need to rerecord it, too flat.”
“It’s fine. I’ll talk to you tomorrow, okay?” Cas says as he kisses Dean on the cheek. The other cheek.
Dean looks down and notices the cast on his right arm. What the fuck did happen to his arm?
“Ladies and gentlemen, Dean Winchester.”
“Yeah, well, sort of,” Dean hesitates. He doesn’t really want to delve into family issues on their first official date. “My manager, Bobby, was transferred out here about fifteen years ago and he brought me, my brother, and my dad with him. Bobby’s kind of like my uncle, he’s the one who saw my 'potential'," Dean says, using air quotes around the word 'potential'.
“You mean her sous chef?” Dean manages.
Dean, Sam, and Jack head out on their mission to kill Chuck once and for all.
“Stressful? What the fuck? How’s his sons sitting with him in the hospital a stressful situation?”
“Alright, Sam. I believe you, and I’m happy for you,” Dean smiles, clapping Sam on the back, “let’s go look at rings.”
“Are you sure? Because we can stop, Dean. I won’t be mad or offended or anything,” Cas says, studying Dean’s face. He really can’t tell if Dean is enjoying this.
“Anyway,” Dean continues, shaking his head, “I showed up to Sammy’s apartment yesterday and my dad was in there screaming his head off. He said a bunch of shit to me about me not being a real man and shit and, uh, yeah that’s where the bruise came from,” Dean finishes.
“Shit,” he mumbles, rubbing his face with his hands. He throws on a pair of dark jeans, a Led Zeppelin t-shirt, and a black blazer. On his way out, he pulls on his favorite cowboy boots and locks the door behind him.
“Thank you,” Dean says as he bolts to the elevator.
On his way home, though, Dean passes Charlie’s. He decides to make a quick U-turn to stop in and see her first.
“Bud Light, my favorite,” Cas says.
Shit. Dean forgot about the huge ass bruise John gave him. He bets it looks even worse than it did yesterday afternoon.
“C’mon Cas, they’re my best friends. And, again, this was all before I knew. Plus, Charlie’s gay so she’s gonna be the last person to have any sort of negative opinion about it,” Dean says to his defense.
“Are you doing the pie now?” Cas asks.
Dean walks back out of the closet and stands in front of Cas, grabbing his hands and pulling him to his feet so that they’re at eye level.
Dean glances at his phone and notices the time.
“Dean, I-,” Cas finally speaks, but Dean cuts him off.
They talk for what feels like hours, through many songs and a lot more beers and Dean thinks they’re really starting to hit it off when Castiel stands up.
“I love you, Cas,” Dean whispers.
“Yeah, I just, I don’t know. I like having the space. Gives me room for expansion without having to move, ya know?”
“That was awesome, Dean. We’re really excited for the album release. And I mean it about you coming back and giving us the scoop on your mystery boo,” MC says, still fishing for details.
“If you ever need some spiritual guidance, or just someone to talk to, you can always give me a call,” he says, handing Dean a business card. Dean lets out a small laugh. He didn’t know preachers had business cards.
The door to the hotel room opens and Dean pulls away from Cas and grabs a towel to wrap around his waist.
“I don’t want to stop this,” he says. “I don’t-I don’t want to lose you.”
“Oh shit! Hell yeah! That’s my b— oh shit m’I interruptin’ y’all?”
Dean looks up at him, a look of horror on his face.
Dean sighs.
“I pulled a few strings with the hotel staff,” Dean winks. “I’ve been working on it since we got here. I figured, since it’s our last night, we should make it special.”
Cas trusts that Dean knows what he wants, so he picks up his pace. He develops a steady rhythm, pulling out and pushing back in a little harder each time.
The rest of the brunch goes a lot smoother than it started. They get back to Dean’s house around 2 and the second they shut the door behind them, Dean has Cas pinned up against it.
“Looks like you guys are having fun,” Sam laughs. “Happy birthday, Dean.”
One missed text and two missed calls.
“He-mmm,” Dean starts to say before he realizes what Charlie said. “He’s this guy I’ve been seeing,” he finishes, shooting Charlie a playful glare.
Dean stops in his tracks.
“The deal was Cas for Jack, but not right away. The empty would come when Cas was…was truly happy and take him forever,” Dean says, his voice shakes.
“What do you need me to do?” Michael responds.
“What’s wrong, Cas?”
“What happened to your hand?” Cas asks, abruptly changing the subject.
Cas nods, jokingly rolling his eyes and holding out his hand.
Dean laughs.
“So, Dean, tell me a little about yourself,” Bart says.
Cas has tears running down his face. So does Dean. Bart and Naomi get up from the table and wrap both boys in a hug. Dean struggles to keep himself from completely breaking down in front of them. Obviously Bobby accepts him for who he is, and as the only real parental figure in his life, that means more to him than anything. But Bobby isn’t like this. He didn’t react this way. It was more of a pat on the back and a “you like what you like, don’t matter to me”. All of this is so foreign to Dean, but it’s also so comforting. Even though the Novaks are not his parents, he’s never going to forget this feeling of family and acceptance that he’s feeling right now.
Lee smiles up at Dean and puts his hand on Dean’s cheek. Dean leans into the touch as Lee pulls him down and kisses him, tasting the whiskey on his breath.
Right around three o’clock, there’s a knock at the door. Cas goes to answer it and he’s met with Sam, Eileen, and their two screaming children who bolt into the house, nearly knocking Cas over.
Dean lifts himself up from his seat, taking every ounce of energy left in his body.
“Nailed it!” Dean says, holding his hand up to her for a high five.
“What’s the matter with you, boy?” Bobby asks him, noticing Dean’s strange demeanor.
“Ready?”
He sits down with his song book and immediately starts writing down the lyrics he’s been playing around with in his head,
He stands there for a minute and thinks about what Benny said. And what Bobby said. And then the hurt creeps back in and reminds him that he’s still far from okay. He grabs his keys and heads to the liquor store.
Dean takes a deep breath and nods, squeezing his eyes shut before Cas even touches him.
What the fuck happened at the party? What did he do?
“Just not feelin’ it tonight, Ben. Tired.”
“So, this new album, Laps Around the Sun, where’d your inspiration come from? What are the songs gonna be like? What can you tell us, Dean?” MC asks.
Cas sighs. He doesn’t want to go into this right now. Dean’s on such a high over the album’s placement on the charts and the news about the Grammy performance. The last thing he wants to do is bring him down over something so trivial.
“Nananana, okay, yeah, nope, mm-mm. Don’t have to dive into that one tonight,” Dean cuts Sam off, tossing a playful glare his way.
They walk in the restaurant and they’re immediately hit with a decadent scent coming from the kitchen. Dean closes his eyes and takes it in.
Dean ignores him, flipping over so that he’s facing away from them both.
The doctor walks up to Sam and Dean about an hour and a half later. They both jump to their feet in anticipation.
It dawns on him that he elected to stay at Benny’s last night to avoid driving home drunk.
“Have Bobby bring you back here.”
“Hello?” That deep, gravelly voice answers.
But if you feel like talkin’
“Perfect,” Dean smiles.
“Dean?” he hears Sam call from down the hall. He doesn’t respond. “Yeah, Jack, do you mind starting to dig into the lore? I’ll be right there once I find Dean.”
“Not yet,” Dean says as he repositions himself. He looks Cas in the eye and slams into him one more time, making sure to veer slightly to the side, just enough to hit Cas’ prostate in the most pleasure inducing way.
He straightens back up and walks towards the giant whiskey barrel of beer on ice as the band starts strumming some instrumentals, obviously trying to stall.
Cas pulls away and gets out of the bed. Dean’s coming to realize Cas isn’t really the type for after sex cuddling and making out. He sighs and gets out of the bed, meeting Cas in the bathroom.
Cas shakes his head.
“I’m uh— a uh— lawyer. I’m a lawyer,” Castiel manages to stumble out.
“So, Dean, we got word that you performed a new song last night at Sushi Sal’s. A couple of fans posted videos on our Facebook page. Now, there haven’t been any stories in the media about your relationship. So, Dean, I mean I gotta ask, who was the special someone that inspired that song?” Storme asks, throwing Dean for a loop. How the hell is he supposed to answer this?
“Alright, Bobby. Thanks. Need me for anything else?”
They clean up their dinner and Cas heads home, despite Dean’s numerous objections and pleas for Cas to stay the night again.
“I’m really not in the mood for a lecture,” Dean rolls his eyes and walks into the kitchen to open up a beer.
The girls look at him with pity as they get up from their seats to hug him. Charlie hugs him for a long time and whispers in his ear.
“We’ll start rehearsing in a couple weeks and I was hoping you could maybe help me pick which songs I should perform. A lot of people do medleys, but I don’t know if I wanna go that route,” he says.
Sam claps him on the back and smiles.
Cas doesn’t answer right away, so Dean gets up and walks into the bathroom, closing the door behind him.
“Damn, Dean. You didn’t have to do all of this,” Sam says.
kissed me and pulled me into your apartment. I tried to stop you cause we were both drunk as shit and not thinking, but, uh, you didn’t care, and you pulled me back in. We made out for a little and managed to make it to your bedroom. You told me to get condoms out of your drawer, but when I turned back around, you were passed out on your bed, so, uh, I left.”
“Amazing,” Dean says through a mouthful of pasta.
“No,” Dean hesitates, then takes a deep breath.” He didn’t know…he didn’t know that I’m in love with him, Sam. He didn’t…”
“You’re a baby,” Cas says back at him. Dean smirks. He’s digging the little jabs Cas is throwing at him, so he makes it a point to complain some more.
Cas takes a deep breath,
I knew I'd found amazing grace
“No, it’s nothing. It’s stupid. Just forget it,” Cas pleads, shaking his head out of Dean's grasp.
“Cas sacrificed himself to save me. He told me-,” Dean swallows. “He told me he loved me, Sam. And the empty was coming, there wasn’t enough time. There just wasn’t enough time and I…I didn’t get to say it back,” his voice cracks. He covers his face in his hands again, his shoulders shake.
“If you’re happy, I’m happy, boy. But if he tries anything cute, I’ll be the first one to knock him on his ass, with the boys to follow.”
“You boys doing okay over here?” Ellen interrupts.
Cas takes a move out of Dean’s playbook and after slamming into his ass a few more times, he veers to the side on the final thrust and hits Dean’s prostate, sending white, hot pleasure through Dean’s entire body.
He stands to unbuckle his own pants as Dean leans over and retrieves the bottle of lube from his bedside drawer.
“You know I’m not-,” Cas pauses, searching for his words. “You know I don’t know how to do this. I’m not completely comfortable expressing that kind of affection publicly.”
“That’s awesome. I wish Sammy owned a bakery, I’d get good deals on pie,” Dean says as he licks his lips, “Sammy’s my only sibling. I think my parents were considering having another kid when, uh,” Dean hesitates, “when my mom passed away.”
was.”
didn’t deserve that. He was pissed at me and he took it out on you. I’m sorry for all the shit he said. You know he didn’t really mean it.”
“Mmm,” Cas groans as he rolls away from Dean, “tired,” he mumbles.
Dean wakes up hungover as fuck around ten am. He props himself up on his elbows and blinks a few times to allow his eyes to adjust to the strange surroundings.
Dean leans back to take everything in. The Grammy’s want
Dean smiles through the kissing and interrupts saying,
Dean tenses up at the stretching heat, but quickly relaxes into Cas’ lips.
Dean picks out a t-shirt with a giant shrimp on the front of it. The shirt reads
“Back to the hotel,” Dean answers.
“Woah, wait, hang on,” Dean says, catching Castiel’s arm as he turns to leave, “Can ya ‘least lemme walk ya to your car?”
Right after dessert is brought out, Cas stands up and clears his throat to get everyone’s attention. They all fall silent while Cas briefly scans the table, landing his eyes on Dean.
“We don’t have to talk,” Cas says quietly as he sits down on the bed.
“Tell me everything, tell me everything
“What?” Sam asks as he turns around in the booth to look at the front door.
“No worries, man,” Dean says, stepping aside to let Cas in.
fallen in-,” Cas stops himself. He turns his back to Dean, putting his hands over his face.
As he stands there fucking around with the stupid machine, Cas walks out of his room in nothing but a towel.
“Oh yeah? Like what?” Cas starts to pry as Dean walks back over to them.
Sam sends him the eye roll emoji and Dean laughs and locks his phone.
Shit, Christmas. Dean forgot the holiday is coming up next week. Does he get Cas something? They haven’t really been seeing each other all that long. But what if Cas gets him something and he doesn’t have anything in return?
“We love you so much, Castiel. Nothing is ever going to change that,” Naomi says, squeezing his hand.
The backstage crew rushes them off stage so they can set up the next performer as Dean pulls out his phone to text Cas.
“Yeah, uh, yeah I’ve been really good too,” Sam says as he rubs a hand over the back of his neck.
Sam walks into the bar with Dean in tow. He heads straight for a booth near the back with three people already occupying it.
“I’m sorry, Sammy. You didn’t deserve that,” Dean manages.
“Hanger box over there,” Benny grins and points to a tall moving box with a built-in metal bar that a portion of his clothes are hanging from.
“Oh, yes please!” Sam says, excitedly taking one of the mugs in both hands and bringing it up to his nose. “Mmm,” he says as he closes his eyes and takes in the strong scent.
“Alright, well up and Adam, I’m starving,” Dean says as he starts to get up.
“You don’t remember calling me last night?”
“Come on, sleepy head. Let’s go get lunch,” Dean says as he pulls the covers down off of Cas.
Dean sees himself in the mirror for the first time since he left Sam’s. He looks like hell. The left side of his jaw is already black and blue. Shit. How is he supposed to explain this to Cas? He’s not really ready to delve into his fucked-up home life on the second date.
“Hmm,” Sam says.
Cas reluctantly pulls himself away from Dean, leaving him panting up against the door. This time, Cas goes to retrieve a condom from the drawer. Dean grins and pushes off the door. He pulls his shirt off over his head and practically jumps on top of Cas, both of them falling onto the bed. Dean presses his lips to Cas’ again, letting Cas slide his tongue into his mouth and returning the favor.
“What the fuck did you just say to me?” Dean says, walking towards John.
Dean’s not sure how to talk to Cas right now, either. What does this mean? So, Cas is attracted to him. That doesn’t automatically mean they’re gonna start dating now. Clearly, he’s uncomfortable with this new-found revelation.
They sit like that for the next few hours, neither of them moving or saying a word.
“Oh, your buddy’s place, huh?” Cas says, playfully rolling his eyes at yet another one of Dean’s many Nashville connections.
“Can you take this blindfold off now, please?” Cas counters.
for Christ’s sake. Let’s go explore!” Sam says, throwing one of the rolled up towels from the neatly stacked pyramid at his head.
“How?” he asks.
“Yeah, well, I’m gonna head out. Got some things to do before my date tonight,” he winks at Charlie.
“Dean,”
“Gone? What do you mean gone? What happened?” Sam asks again, bending down to Dean’s level.
“And…”
“Benny told me you had yourself quite the night last night,” Bobby says, eyeing Dean’s cast.
When they get back to the house, Cas helps Dean inside and they head up to the bedroom.
“I-I don’t know what to say right now,” Dean manages.
They make their way to the bedroom, leaving a trail of clothes on the floor as they walk. When they make it to the bedroom, Dean gently pushes Cas down on the bed as he climbs on top of him.
“Cas, it’s me,” Dean buzzes up. “Please let me in so we can talk.”
“Yours or his?”
Cas’ immediate reaction is anger, but his face quickly relaxes and turns into more of a worried expression again.
“Please,” Dean says, taking a plate from Sam’s hand as Cas grabs the other.
“I know, Dean, but I have a job now too. And stop calling me Sammy.”
“Dad, this is Dean,” Cas says, introducing them. “Dean, my dad, Bartholomew.”
“Bobby’s got us set up back here with a tv, I think,” Sam replies.
“Yeah,” Dean laughs, “yeah, guess so.”
“Hey, Cas,” he finally says, “sorry, uh, you look good.”
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean moans against Cas’ shoulder. He reaches for down to work on his own erection.
“Famous, huh?” Dean laughs, “yes ma’am, that sounds great. Thanks.”
“We should really go, but Cas, maybe Sam can call you some time for advice?” Jess asks. Sam nudges her and she mouths ‘what’ to him.
Dean stands there, staring at the callbox for a moment before pushing the call button one more time.
“So, Cas, you wanna get outta here?” Dean asks.
He leans forward and begins kissing Cas again, taking in the taste of his mouth. Dean can taste the apple pie still and that makes this so much sweeter.
Cas moves his fingers around, stretching him open just enough so he can fit himself inside Dean, but still cause him a little bit of pleasurable pain.
“Dean, I ca-, I can’t, I’m gonna come.”
