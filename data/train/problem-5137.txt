“No!” Clint said, and the sound that came right after was definitely caused by him kicking one of the walls.
"No. I mean, yes, I said no because, what I meant with no was yes, but I got confused," Tony babbled. Steve smiled in sympathy and pulled him closer to his chest, a hand cupping his head to keep him in place.
Tony’s eyes snapped open as he sat bolt upright, hands moving to his mouth to choke back a scream that never came out. Learning not to shout was essential when the objective was to prevent anyone from finding out you had bad dreams regularly, and Tony had mastered that; he had gotten very good at hiding things over the years.
Even if it didn’t happen very often, whenever Steve had needed to babysit Clint, he had noticed that Tony fell into his little headspace almost immediately in his presence. But that was not the problem, Steve didn’t deny it was a bit complicated to look after two littles at the same time, though it wasn’t something he dreaded doing either. The problem was that little Tony seemed to truly dislike little Clint – and only little Clint, because the playful relationship they had when they were in their adult mindsets was still intact.
"It's okay baby, daddy's here," Steve coaxed, cupping the back of Tony's head. Tony hid his face in the crook of his neck, and felt relief when Steve continued walking until they were in front of the windows, not to the couch. "It's just Clint, he's feeling little too," he explained once he noticed the reason behind Tony's uneasiness.
Retrieving a carton of milk from the cupboard, Steve opened it and poured enough of its contents to fill a bottle in a pot. Then, he placed the pot on the stove and started to heat it up. He was tempted to turn around and lean over the kitchen island so he could see Tony, but he stayed by the stove, stirring the milk occasionally. And he was happy he did, because only a few minutes later, he could spot Tony out of the corner of his eye, getting up from the floor and walking until he left Steve’s visual field.
Tony glanced back and forth between Steve and the bottle he was holding up very close to his face, clueless of what to do. Well, he did know what he had to do, he knew he was supposed to open his mouth and let Steve get the nipple inside. What Tony didn’t know was whether he wanted to suck from a bottle teat or not.
The only thing he knew was that he was running out of time for two reasons: one, Tony was getting increasingly skeptical and he didn’t fall completely for his excuses anymore – Steve could tell Tony knew there was something beyond those reasons he proclaimed, though he couldn’t put his finger on what it was. And two, Steve’s conscious couldn’t take it anymore. Steve couldn’t shake the feeling he was somehow lying to Tony, because, even if he did mean it when he said he was treating Tony like he was just for the sake of it, Tony’s hunches were right, there was something else.
After taking a moment to cuddle his baby, Steve took a few steps to his left and set him down on his feet right in front of the bathroom. Tony looked up at him confused.
Steve waited a bit more before leaning over and rolling Tony over onto his back once more. Tony moaned because of the forced change of position, but he made no attempt to get away from him. Steve stroked his thigh affectionately and got up from the bed to get the supplies he would need, a goofy smile on his face.
"C'mon sweety, say daddy," Steve would ask, lowering his face to Tony's level, "or can you say Dada?  C'mon, try it baby, say DA-DA," he'd suggest, causing Tony a funny feeling in his stomach. If he felt ridiculous saying daddy, dada was even worse. He couldn’t deny the way Steve’s face light up made up for it, though.
Guilt flared in Tony’s stomach, he didn’t want to disappoint Steve. It wasn't like he hadn't liked the toys. There were some pretty good ones that had caught his attention, like all those pipes and cogs building toys that suction to the wall and made different things when water was pour into them. The problem was Tony didn't know what to do with them. That is to say, he obviously knew toys were meant to be played with, but was he supposed to do something he had never done in his life?
Hum. I'm experiencing a bit of writer's block again. It sucks, because I did have some time during the week to write. Anyway, I promise next chaper Steve and Tony will finally talk about what's been going on.
Before he even realized it, Tony was already comfortably settled on the bed, back leaned against the headboard, legs resting on the mattress, one on the top of the other, and the hour hand of the watch on his wrist pointing at two numbers ahead of the number it pointed when he arrived to the bedroom. Yes, definitely Tony lost track of time when checking his e-mail.
That was the reason why Tony tended to lock himself in his workshop for days in a row, because an idea that was not carry through could be something frustrating and unbearable. He needed to see those mental pictures making their way into reality. An unnerving feeling of anxiety would pervade his whole being until he had created or done whatever it was the thing that had occurred to him. So, a little sleep and food deprivation was a small price to pay in order for his mind to be peaceful, even if everybody else disagreed.
“I already answered to that. If you’re not clever enough to remember, it’s not my problem! Now, move!” Tony ordered once more.
And that was absolutely terrifying. Needing someone in such a way could cause many consequences Tony didn’t know he was prepared to deal with.
Out of the corner of his eyes, Tony could see how Clint turned his head to look at them at the mention of his name, and stare at Tony. However, the TV seemed to be more interesting than Tony, because just a few seconds later, Clint focused his eyes on the screen once more.
“Bought them,” Tony said, a blank expression still on his face. He had bought dozens of toys for nothing.
Tony vacillated for a moment, but only because he didn’t want to seem too eager, and when he nodded shyly, Steve patted his thighs encouragingly. Tony stared at Steve’s legs. He stared at Steve. Then, he stared back at the legs. Why didn’t Steve just leaned forward and lifted him to place him on his lap like he began doing after they started age playing? Tony didn’t know, though he actually didn’t care much about it right now.
But now, Steve could ensure Tony did. And if Tony could already reach that state of mind, well, Steve figured it was alright to take things a little bit further. Maybe having a nursery would come in handy. Maybe the more realistic this was, the easier it would be for Tony to ease himself into his little headspace and stay like that a bit longer.
“I’m sorry sweetheart, but I have to check on Clint,” Steve apologized, patting his bottom. Tony always grunted when he did that, though Steve was sure Tony found those pats comforting.
“I’m not, your daddy must have forgotten to restock them,” Steve lied, feeling awful for doing so. “Come on kiddo, just this time, I promise I’ll take it off if you want to go to the bathroom, just let me know.”
Slowly and hesitantly, Tony raised his head just enough to see Steve out of the corner of his eye – if he wanted the answers for those questions he was afraid he had no choice but to face Steve – and Tony didn’t know whether to smile or cringe at the other man. Steve was looking at him with such affection, with such unbridled love and with such stubborn pride that Tony felt compelled to wonder if Steve hadn’t meant to look at somebody else. The ease with which Steve showed the intensity of his feelings never failed to be a bit overwhelming.
At a speed that could certainly be taken as superhuman, Tony uncurled himself, got on his hands and knees, and crawled to the corner of the crib, where he rose to his feet and clumsily tried to swing a leg over the rail. Steve barely had time to reach out, grab him by the back of his t-shirt, and pull him back. Tony struggled a little to break free before finally losing his balance and falling back down onto the crib, on his bottom. Quickly and panicky, he moved back from him, and stopped until his back bumped into the crib bars on the opposite corner.
It was undoubtedly easier to scrub Clint when he wasn’t attempting to get away from him, and in less than five minutes, Phil had already rinsed him, taking him out of the shower and dried him off.
“I didn’t lie, I told you I’d give you some cookies once you finished eating your lunch,” Phil pointed out, sounding falsely calm. “And I maintain it, no cookies until I see that plate completely empty.”
"Why do you do this to yourself, Tony? Why do you try so hard to deny yourself what you want?" Steve questioned, moving closer to Tony.
“What happened here JARVIS? Why is everything wrecked? Did somebody break into the Tower? Were we attacked?”
But maybe the problem was that Clint’s toys and his were different. It was no secret that Steve wanted him to pretend to be a very young kid (if Tony still struggled to call Steve ‘daddy’, using the word ‘baby’ to refer to himself was something he couldn’t bring himself to do either), so his toys consisted of blocks, stuffed animals, stacking towers, coloring books and puzzles. Those things were definitely not striking enough for his adult brain. How could Tony play with something that his brain considered to be anything but fun?
“Let’s get on with it,” Tony told to himself as he got off the couch. If he hurried, he might be able to finish checking all the toys by the end of the day.
After what seemed an eternity, Steve reached the nursery. He put a hand on the doorknob and pushed the door open, sensing how Tony’s body tensed behind him. For a moment, Steve was afraid his baby got all worked up and oppose to enter, though the most he resisted was walking a bit slower than he’d been doing so far.
Daddy wanted to be a daddy and he had never denied that, quite the opposite, actually. If Tony wasn’t willing to let Daddy take care of him, he couldn’t really blame Daddy if he looked for somebody else who did enjoy and did need his attention and care. Tony couldn’t blame Daddy if he wanted to replace him, and what better replacement than Clint? That outcome shouldn’t be shocking, not really, Tony should’ve foreseen things would turn out that way. Clint was much better at age playing than Tony, and even though Clint’s headspace was a bit older for Steve’s liking, they got along pretty well.
It would be hard for Tony to get over the Captain-America-had-already-known-about-this-dirty-little-secret fact. His mind would be totally focus on that, preventing him from coming up with an excuse to get out of the second talk Steve will surely want to have with him. Tony had been told to go and look for him whenever he was ready – whatever that meant – and he obviously wouldn’t do it, so that would make Steve come and look for him instead, and Tony wanted to be ready for that. Still, he didn’t hide or tried to avoid Steve this time, that would have reduced the time it would take Steve to bring the topic up again, and Tony needed that time. Although that didn’t mean he was trying to spend time with Steve either. If there was no reason for them to be in the same room at the same time, Tony didn’t think twice about leaving. But if it was something that had to do with a total different matter, Tony manned up and dealt with it.
By the tenth swat he was already gasping for air and fighting some tears treating to fall, his legs kicking more because of his reflexes than for the intention of escaping, which was, well, impossible. Sitting at the table and having dinner would have been so much better than this, now he started to feel stupid for not doing that since the beginning.
Tony had no doubt that this was what he wanted, though it was way much easier and less embarrassing to let Steve be the one in charge of everything related to their age play. If his brain suddenly began condemning him for sucking on a pacifier or wearing a diaper, he could still appease his conscience by arguing Steve had been the responsible for those things. That would no longer be possible. Tony had to accept that whatever childish action he found himself doing – and enjoying – would be the result of his own decision.
At the beginning, Tony was emphatically determined not to make use of the cameras for that purpose, and focused hard on trying to think of something else he could do. But as days went by, that seemed to be the only option and temptation became harder to resist, until one afternoon Tony finally succumbed, finding himself having JARVIS show him on one of the screens placed in his workshop what Steve and Clint were doing. Five seconds, enough time to see they were simply training, and Tony had JARVIS vanish the footage, feeling extremely guilty for violating their privacy and promising he would never do it again.
Steve knew it was just a way to keep him occupy and refrain him from playing with Clint, though he couldn’t understand why nor he could bring himself to contradict Tony. The mere thought of making him cry oppressed his heart. It was better to wait. Tony was looking more and more tired by the minute, so Steve might be able to put him down for a nap soon and that way he could have some quality time with Clint to avoid making him feel left aside.
“You haven’t come to bed for at least three days in a row,” Steve reported, trying to keep a serious face.
Steve promised not to say anything to anyone before leaving the room, a bit taken aback. Though his astonishment hadn’t been caused by all what Phil had said, but by his own brain. Because that scene he had witnessed, Clint curled up into a small ball, wearing a diaper and sucking his thumb, while resting his head on Phil’s thighs, was well imprinted in his mind.
Or not. Tony didn’t know. It wasn’t like Steve would make fun of him if Tony asked him to change his diaper – Tony was afraid Steve would even have that expression of dorky adoration plastered on his face if he did ask for such a thing – nor would that be as distressing as actually having his soaked diaper changed; therefore, Tony was struggling to understand why he was so reluctant to just go for it.
“You’re such a brave boy, daddy’s so proud of you” Steve whispered in his ear. Tony would’ve like to beg to differ, but he already was way too close to his headspace to argue. It’d never cease to amaze him how Daddy’s presence never failed to make him feel very small.
“I–,” Tony trailed off, his heart pounding so badly that he was sure he would be able to see his chest bounding in and out if he peeked under his t-shirt.
It was just by chance that one day, when he was doing extra chores that had been assigned to him as punishment for retaliating against a senior who had picked on him, he discovered that the school kept a supply of pull-ups. Surely there were some pretty young students who had problems with keeping their pants dry – poor kids, they were sent away at a pretty young age, even younger than he had been. Pull-ups weren’t exactly diapers, but they were the closest thing he could ever have gotten while living there. Tony hadn’t even hesitated to take one package to his room, adrenaline running through his veins all the way back, afraid to run into somebody. As soon as he got inside his room, he locked the door and looked for the perfect place to hide the package, but not without trying one on first. It fit, a little bit tight, but not that much. This was the first, and only, time he was grateful for being small and thin for a kid his age.
Slowly, Steve took his hand and pulled him with the intention of getting him to stand up. Tony refused, shaking his head effusively. Steve waited for a few seconds before pulling again, but Tony kept resisting, he really didn't want to look at Steve's face. It was until the third attempt that Tony allowed Steve to pull him closer, and that sensation of feeling very small took over him again when Steve made him stand between his legs.
“C’mon, let’s get something to eat and then we can cuddle as much as you want,” Steve suggested, pressing a kiss against his hair.
Infantilism, that was the term they used, and he surely had no idea what it was back then. The books in the library had no information about that topic, and the Internet wasn’t completely available back then.
Tony should have known by now that the more ridiculous the situation was, the higher the chances there were for him to be wrong.
What was Tony going to do when they broke up? (and Tony said ‘when’ because he wouldn’t dare to dream that they were going to stay together forever, his record of failed relationships deterred him from doing that) Drinking, burying himself in work, having meaningless sex, there were a lot of things that he could do in order to get through that breakup. But what about his little self? How was that part of him going to get over it? Would Tony have to hire someone to give him a bottle and change his diapers? The mere thought of that made him shudder. Besides, this was something he had agreed to do because Steve had requested it, Tony couldn’t even imagine age playing with someone else.
“I wonder how it ends,” Tony wondered out loud, his mind already picturing himself on Steve’s lap, leaned against his chest, listening to him while he read the words in a way he brought the story to life. Tony never told Steve, but the nights he had read to him, Tony had had such peaceful sleep.
Steve’s eyes narrowed, “that’s your favorite one, I bought it because you liked it,” he reminded him, and he wasn’t lying. Clint had seen the purple sippy cup advertised online and had found the dancing penguin stamp on it amusing. According to him, the sippy cups he owned were either too dull–Phil’s taste–or too babyish–Steve’s taste–so he had convinced Steve to buy it, as well as some toys he had liked as well.
Music, there was some music being played in the distance. Tony could hear it; it had woken him up. A quick glance to the window was enough to verify it was still dark outside. Who the hell was playing music at such early hour in the morning? No, wait, it wasn’t music. Well, it was, but it was a ringtone. A cell phone’s ringtone. Who the hell was he calling him at such early hour in the morning? Did Tony have an early meeting that he had forgotten about and that was Pepper wanting to know if he was ready to go? No, Tony didn’t remember having forgotten about any meeting.
“Look! It’s just like a bed,” Tony said to his brain, which would have been a bit odd if it hadn’t been for the fact that he considered his brain an entity apart from him, due to how much they seemed to differ in everything sometimes, “it has a bed frame, a box spring and a mattress, just like beds do, there’s no difference with this bed and the one there’s in the bedroom, so there’s no reason why you can’t sleep in the other one,” he explained, frustration in his voice, because there was no way he was going to make his brain believe something he was well aware it was a lie.
“Well, everything you do on a computer, cell phone or tablet is automatically saved. Advertisers keep a watchful eye on your browsing habits, so, if you look for cars on the Internet, there’s a great possibility the pop-ups you see are from car agencies or websites,” Tony explained, voice serious. It was far from the first time Tony explained him something related to these topics, but Steve couldn’t shake the feeling there was something off. “I usually get ads about gadgets and stuff like that.”
First there was work, then vacation, then the hype for the Endgame movie, and then depression after watching it. I just couldn't get around to continuing this. And I guess the inly thing that drove me to sit down and write down one more chapter was the fact that I do feel sad because of how the movie ended. I mean, there was plenty of fanservice and I loved every minute of it, but you know, the ending, Am I the only one who's grieving?
"No!" Tony yelled, smacking a hand over his mouth right away. It was too late, Steve had already stopped and turned around to look at him.
pay her, not the other way around, and second, Pepper told me you didn’t have any deadline for anything, just paperwork you need to sign, which I’m pretty sure you weren’t doing down there,” Steve divulged.
“Don’t you want to go with me to order the pizza?” Steve questioned when Clint refused to stand up, his focus still on the straps of the overalls.
Afraid he would scare Tony away, Steve refrained himself from opening his eyes or showing any signs of being awake. Was Tony there to stay or had he come here to look for something and he would leave once he found it? Steve hoped it was the former.
"I'm not immune to pain, I do feel pain," Steve clarified, though he doubted he would feel nothing but a tickle if he stubbed himself, "besides, you don't need the serum, you just need to be more careful and pay more attention to the things that are surrounding you," he said mockingly, knowing perfectly well what Tony's answer was going to be.
“Tony! Are you OK?” Steve asked as he approached him, but Tony was already on his feet, pulling up his jeans. “Jesus Tony, I asked you to stay there. See what happened. Did you hurt yourself?” Steve reprimanded as he tried to get closer to check if there was any kind of injury, but Tony moved further away.
After some more time had passed, he stood up carefully, not wanting to wake him. Steve really had to find a way to help Tony to get into his Llittle headspace without having to throw these kinds of tantrums beforehand, otherwise negative feelings would be always attached to this process, and well, that could not end well. If this was one of his ways of coping with stress, it should be something that helped him to relax, not to get more stressed.
“Yes, sweetheart?” Steve asked as he stood in Tony’s field of vision. Tony would never admit it, but he felt uneasy every time he woke up and didn’t see him around when he knew Steve was supposed to be there.
His chest tightness worsened, more tears flooded his eyes and his legs became so wobbly that Tony had no other option than to plop down right there on the floor, finding himself with no strength to leave that room as he wanted to. Daddy had set up that nursery especially for him, and Tony’s heart sunk as he realized there was a high possibility he would never get to use it properly.
Jealousy, it had to be jealousy. How else could Tony explain why he hadn’t been able to get rid of that mental picture of Clint snuggled on Steve’s lap?
The dreams that were automatically forgotten when awakening were the worst ones. Whether they were good dreams or bad dreams, it didn't matter, Tony would like to know what had caused the smile or frown on his face. Feeling uneasy without knowing the reason just made him feel worse, that make it impossible to reduce the impact.
Steve’s lips pursed, “There are no more sippy cups, baby, that’s the only one. Come on, just try drinking from your bottle,” he proposed as he held it up in front of his face. Tony shook his head stubbornly.
A bit hesitantly, Steve turned around after staring at Tony for a few more seconds. He was going. Steve was going and leaving him alone. It shouldn’t matter, in two hours he would be back and then Tony might dare to ask him to play daddy for a while. Two hours wasn’t a long time, Tony could certainly wait.
Tony bowed his head and shook it almost immediately, a blush sweeping up his face, so intense it was visible even if his face was somehow hidden.
“Sorry if you came to hang out with him, but I’d rather you postpone whatever it was what you’d planned to do,” Phil asked, still murmuring. Now that Steve was closer to them, he could see Clint was sucking his thumb, which only confused him more. What exactly was happening here? “The last mission was a hard one, and he was having nightmares all night,” he sighed. “In short, he was having a very bad day. So, I want him to sleep as much as possible,” he finished saying, hushing Clint tenderly when the latter twitched in his sleep. “Is there something wrong?” Phil questioned, looking up at Steve. He had just stayed there, staring at them without doing or saying anything.
Sparring, watching TV, having lunch, playing video games, Tony had always known there wasn’t any mystery on what they did. Steve wasn’t really known for liking to do thrilling things, and even if Clint liked to go crazy every now and then, Tony was sure Steve kept him in line. But that was before Tony found out about Age Play, and before he knew Clint was into it.
Even if Tony hadn’t really complained or fussed about Steve going into Daddy mode when he was evidently avoiding to slip into his Little headspace, Tony would do it and he may even try to get away if he woke up now. This wouldn’t happen if his boy was far too deep in his dreams. Steve had found out that, when being Little, Tony literally slept like a baby, which meant that he didn’t wake up that easily and was barely aware of the way Steve manhandled to get him ready for bed. So, hopefully, Tony had already gotten into his Little mindset.
“Do you trust me?” Steve questioned with a tone of voice that gave Tony the feeling Steve doubted what his answer was. Tony pulled away just enough to be able to see his face, brow furrowed in confusion. “Do you?”
“Tony?” Steve asked, rolling over so he could face him. The arc reactor illuminated the room, and Steve could see Tony raising his leg to take his right feet in his left hand, wincing. “Are you OK?” he asked, sitting up.
“You know, online advertising is very annoying sometimes,” Tony mentioned from the sofa, his eyes still glued to the screen. “But people have to admit it’s very ingenious too.”
Hum, not such a big reaction from Clint. I guess I wanted to show he already reached a point where he's comfortable with his little side, he's not struggling with any of this anymore.
“But–” Tony trailed off, failing to translate into words everything that was going on inside his head.
Programming was something that Anthony FUCKING Stark could do while sleeping! And yet, he was coming across a lot of glitches he didn’t even understand why they were there, it was so frustrating. He didn’t know why he just couldn’t concentrate. Well, he kind of did, but if it was something he hadn’t wanted to deal with a week ago, so, obviously, he didn’t want to deal with it now either. He should have finished the prototype at least three days ago. Pepper hadn’t tried to get a hold of him yet, she always tried to give him enough space when he was dealing with one of the Board’s requests, but Tony was sure it was a matter of time before she started calling him because she couldn’t deal with the greedy assholes in the Board anymore.
"The fuck! Are you even listening to me?!" Tony accused as he threw his arms to the air in frustration.
Dinner went uneventful. Clint made jokes about Wolverine while Natasha kicked him under the table every time one of his jokes went too far. Thor talked about how this battle had been very alike to one he fought back in Asgard. Bruce asked slyly between talks if the Hulk had destroyed too many buildings or hurt somebody. And Steve compliment every one of them, lying his eyes on Tony every once in a while.
“I told you I’m not feeling little,” Tony reminded Steve when he surrounded his waist with his arms.
Hastily, Tony uncovered himself, setting aside the blanket carelessly, staring at it with disdain. Then, he almost had a heart attack when he looked down and got a glimpse of himself: he was wearing a onesie and, of course, a diaper. Steve hadn’t even tried to cover up the fact he had been the one who dressed Tony like that, since the chosen onesie had been the blue one with the shield of Captain America printed in front of the cloth. Of course Tony had been the one who bought it in the first place – in his defense, he had bought one themed onesie of each of The Avengers, not just one of Captain America – but he had never worn it.
And as usual, if you spot any typo or mistake or incoherent line, please let me know. I actually didn't re-read this chapter as much as I usually do n_n''.
After some more kicks and punches, Steve placed Tony in front of him for the fifth time already, a little bit closer now, causing Tony’s legs to end up dangling beside the bed. Without hesitation, Steve simultaneously undid the jean’s button and unzipped its fly, pulling both the jeans and the boxers down. Nudity wasn’t really an issue here, besides the fact that they had shared showers in SHIELD several times after a battle and decontamination, Tony wasn’t exactly known for his modesty – someone who had several photos in his birthday suit out on the Internet couldn’t be modest, not really. Therefore, the blush on Tony’s cheeks were caused by the whole situation itself and not his nudity.
“I know you do, but your daddy’s busy right now, he can’t come. And you can’t stay there until he arrives,” Phil hurried to clarify, knowing perfectly well that thought had crossed Tony’s mind. “You need to come out here.” Tony shook his head. “Yes, you have to change out of those clothes.” Tony refused once more. “Tony, your daddy wouldn’t want you to stay there, he would be really sad if he comes back and finds out you preferred to stay here instead of letting me help you.”
The goofy smiled reappeared on Steve's face as he tickled Tony some more on his way to the kitchen. Things were definitely good, and as Steve saw it, they were in the point where everything could just get better.
“Okay baby boy, I need you to tell daddy what you wanna wear,” Steve requested as he sat down on the edge of the bed, close to Tony. “You’re free to choose whatever you like, there’s no wrong or right choice in here, Daddy’s gonna be happy with whatever outfit you pick,” he explained, earning an edgy look from his baby, “and just because you decide to wear something in particular today, doesn’t mean that you won't be able to change later nor that you'd have to wear the same kind of clothes every time we have a playdate," he clarified, knowing perfectly well that would be one of Tony's main concerns.
“Yes, you are! You’ve kept me locked in here and you won’t let me go until I do what you want me to do!” Tony accused, fisting his hands. He really wanted to punch Steve, the only thing that stopped him from doing it was that, well, it would hurt him more than it would hurt Steve.
“Me?” Steve asked, “Would you like Daddy to help you change?” Tony nodded almost inappreciably, clearly mortified. “What about the diaper? Would you like me to help with that too?” A second nod, and the blush, which had started to fade, was back in full force. “Alright, then.”
With very good agility that would fool anyone into believing he had been doing this for ages, Steve proceeded to change Tony’s diaper, fighting the urge to tickle him or something of the like to avoid stretching on the process more than it was necessary. There would be plenty of time to do those things once Tony learned not to be embarrassed.
Tony would have to leave the Avengers who would surely make fun of him once they found out about this. He would have to kick them out eventually not being able to put up with the constant jokes – a shame really, because Tony had gotten used to living with them. The Board would somehow find out too and would make him quit his own company, not wanting to have a boss who was so fucked up. The news would be talking about this for months, making it impossible for him to ever leave the Tower again. Tony got the felling he was going too far with these speculations, but he didn’t feel like being rational right now, because Steve knew. He knew!
Tony had looked quite troubled when faced with the diapers. His expression had clearly showed that he hadn’t been expecting Steve to go that far during the first day. For a moment, Steve had even thought he was going to use their safeword, but he didn’t. A bit hesitantly, he had consented to be diapered, and then fed with a bottle. Tony hadn’t refrained Steve from doing anything. He was even sleeping with a pacifier in his mouth and a teddy bear in his arms after age playing for just four times. It just proved how genuinely Tony wanted this as much as Steve.
By now, Tony had read pretty much everything there was about infantilism and age play. That helped him to understand why he was the way he was, and he kind of accepted it as a part of who he was. But that didn’t mean he liked it. He still hated that part of him and he wanted to get rid of it. All the information he had read didn’t give him any clue on how to do that, though.
“Captain Roger’s schedule is clear for the day, Sir,” JARVIS notified matter-of-factly, making Tony glare up at the roof. The A.I. had been informing him about Steve’s activities and whereabouts all day, and it was starting to get annoying.
So that was what Tony had been doing for the last three weeks, and it was going smoothly so far. He focused on the improvements of his suits, alcohol made his mind numb, preventing him from thinking clearly and he was getting pretty good at turning a deaf ear to JARVIS’s recommendations. And the best of all, nobody dared to bother him when he was in his workshop, the only one who did was Steve, and, well, apparently Steve wanted to have nothing to do with Ton anymore. This guaranteed success to his plan.
Well, I did want to have a little bit of drama in this one, I mean, Steve way of handling this wasn't the best option, and I wanted Tony to made him see that.
“No! I don’t like broccoli!” Clint expressed, kicking his legs once. Phil took a deep breath, and wondered if he would witness a tantrum for a first time. He wished he wouldn’t.
"Shhh, you’re clearly tired. Tomorrow you can continue working on whatever you were working this afternoon, but right now we're going to go upstairs, Daddy's going to give you a nice bath, get you ready for bed, feed you some delicious dinner, so you can go right straight to bed all relaxed and with a happily satisfied tummy," Steve informed, his eyes fixed on Tony's. If there had been a slight doubt whether Steve was carrying their play date out or not, this cleared it.  "OK, baby?" he asked, though Tony knew Steve wasn’t giving him an option. Not really.
“Here you are,” Tony said to himself when he found it, selecting the save button right away. Now the only thing he had to do was logging into his email and attach the file. “JARVIS, why didn’t you notified me I had a lot of emails?” Tony asked once he saw his inbox. This was exactly why he sometimes abstained from getting his hands on any device, he tended to waste a lot of time checking and answering emails.
Once dinner had been over, they moved to the couch in the living room, which made Tony’s face burned one more time. The living room was directly connected to the elevator, so, if anyone decided to pay an unexpected visit, one of the first things they would see would be the sofa where both of them currently were. Tony knew JARVIS wouldn’t let anyone in without their authorization, but he couldn’t help feeling nervous. His mind played tricks on him, making him see the doors of the elevator opened when they actually didn’t. That was why he kept hiding his face against Steve chest, and no coaxing had been able to force him out of his hideout this time.
That had been unnerving. Tony had been aware of everything that had been happening; yet, he hadn’t been able to do anything about it. It had been like he was just a spectator, watching how someone else controlled his actions. And the fact that the one who had been controlling him was just another side of himself hadn’t helped that much.
Steve brushed a kissed on Tony’s head and stroke his hair with affection, “alright baby, why don’t you get changed while I put away everything else?” he proposed as he pushed his baby away just enough to be able to stand up without shoving him by accident.
“I promised to buy a pizza and that’s what I’m doing, but if you keep interrupting me, I’ll never finish ordering it,” Steve scolded. Clint leaned over the counter, arms folded over it to cushion his chin, murmuring something about Steve being a liar.
With that in mind, Phil placed his hands on the closet doors, and he was ready to slide them open when someone beat him to it from inside. Before Phil’s brain had time to analyze what had happened, Tony rushed out of the closet, knocking Phil over in the process, and disappeared into the bathroom, closing the door behind him.
“Oh, this is bullshit and I’m going to prove it to you,” Tony said to his brain once more, climbing into the crib peevishly.
With movements a bit too brisk, Tony lowered his head and stretched his arms toward Steve in the universal pick-me-up signal. Steve felt excitement beginning to pound hard in the pit of his stomach.
Steve sighed. "Clint, even if it was bigger, which it’s not, why would it matter? If you're still hungry when you finish that slice, I'll give you another one,” he reasoned, voice a bit tense. He held up the fork in front of Tony’s mouth, waiting for him to finish chewing the last bite.
“Sir, I know you want to make sure everything gets properly signed, but I highly doubt Ms. Potts is going to be happy when she sees you’ve signed three times the same sheet,” JARVIS commented, snapping Tony out of his stupor.
Every new thing Tony tried allowed Steve to draw a further line to the limits. He might have called himself ‘daddy’ in the hope of encouraging Tony to do the same, though he refused to answer if he was called ‘Steve’ and not ‘daddy’ not before Tony himself had used that word for the first time. Cups and glasses were taken away as soon as Tony showed him he didn’t mind drinking from bottles and sippy cups. Cutlery stopped being placed on the table after Tony made known that using his hands or being fed was something he was willing to do too. As long as it truly didn’t disturb Tony, Steve was determined to not let him back down once he had moved forward.
Of course, Steve wasn’t going to sit back and do nothing. It was true that he had promised to stop if so requested by Tony, and he had every intention of staying true to his word; but that was proving to be difficult due to the fact that Tony hadn’t giving him any reason or justification whatsoever.
event, the one Tony had been trying not to think too much about with very little success; the one that had made him rethink a lot of things; the one that had made him realize that, the more he waited to put an end to this situation, the more Steve would put up a fight, as he was evidently growing fonder and fonder of Tony’s little self. If Tony wanted to keep this whole age play situation from going further without repercussions, it had to be now.
“Are you really rejecting me?” Tony asked, moving his head away a little to be able to see Steve’s face.
“Let’s make a deal, I’ll read a chapter, if you don’t like it at all, I’ll stop and we’ll do anything you want,” Steve suggested, giving him an encouraging squeeze.
“Daddy, I’m tired, I wanna sleep,” Clint repeated from the bed, making Phil turn his head around to look at him.
After Phil told him everything that had happened, remorse had taken over Steve. The mere idea of imagining Tony being little, feeling bad, crying and calling for him made his heart twitch. He was supposed to be there for Tony. Always. He had made that promise. And now that Tony had needed him the most, Steve had failed him. He had failed
“Agent Barton is already in the elevator, waiting for you to allow him into the floor,” JARVIS answered.
Those and many other questions flooded Steve’s head as he walked throughout the living room, intentionally slower. His hand rested over the doorknob for several seconds before he brought himself to turn it, and all nervousness, discomfort and insecurity vanished as soon as he stepped into Clint’s bedroom and saw him.
Yet, three hours had passed and Tony wasn’t even halfway through. Maybe he should really mute JARVIS, because having the A.I. constantly telling him that he should go and hang out with Steve for a while was distracting him more and more, especially when he had been craving for daddy desperately for the last two hours.
Still, Tony knew this behavior wasn’t normal at all, what kid wanted to be babied? Most of them were anxious to grow up as fast as possible to be able to do whatever they’d like. So, even though he had managed to get a packages of pull-ups, he didn’t let himself wear them unless it was one of those days when he was certain his bed wouldn’t stay dry, and not just for the pleasure of it.
“No,” Tony denied, voice determined, whining loudly when Steve tried to pry his hands away. Steve stopped cold when his lower lip began quivering, the last thing he wanted to do was hurt him.
So, after thinking it over in his mind for a few days, Tony decided that the other best way to proceed in this situation was hinting Steve at his eagerness to find out if this kind of role play could work for them. If Steve got the hint and played along, Tony would have avoided an awkward conversation; if not, well, he really didn’t know how he would react if Steve had lost interest in it – especially if Steve kept somehow interacting with Clint when he was Little – but he’ll cross that bridge when came to it.
“Seriously, how come the only thing that can make you leave your workshop is coffee?” Steve asked as he got up from the couch to follow him, walking into the kitchen just in time to see the horrified look that appeared on Tony’s face when he saw that the coffee machine was empty. Steve couldn’t help chuckling, earning a glare from Tony. “Sorry, we ran out of coffee. I was going to go downstairs to get more, but I somehow forgot about it,” he apologized. Tony kept glaring at him, but said nothing. Instead, he hugged the mug to his chest once more and walked past Steve. “Hey, where are you going?”
“You know better than anyone that that’s not an excuse. So, what do you do? You ignore me, you don't face me. You make me drag you out of your workshop so I can make you do something you should do by yourself. And I was patient, I really was, but then you go and throw that tantrum-”
“You’ll feel more comfortable when you’re out of those icky clothes,” Steve commented, turning his head around to give him an encouraging smile. Tony didn’t quite smile back, just looked up at Steve with a mixed of shyness and anxiety. “Why don’t you go sit down on the bed and wait for daddy to fetch your clothes?” he suggested, already heading to said piece of furniture. Tony’s grip on his hand tightened and he shook his head slightly as he whined, though he didn’t put up much of a fight when Steve pushed him down gently onto the bed. “It’s okay sweetheart, I’ll be right there,” he soothed as he pointed at the closet.
Nevertheless, the fact that Tony didn’t like to be mad at Steve didn’t mean he was going to let what had happened pass just like that. Tony undoubtedly had the right to be upset, Steve had gone too far this time. Yes, Tony knew there would be some people who would say he was overreacting, after all, Steve hadn’t done anything but feed him, bath him, put him to bed, entertain him and some other things that supported Steve’s claim of not being doing anything wrong, just pampering because he loved looking after him. Tony wasn’t going to say that hadn’t been true, but that hadn’t been the whole truth and that was what made him furious.
This time, Tony got more fidgety. Little whines escaped him as he looked back and forth between Steve and the diapers, until his thumb headed to his mouth and began sucking hard, perhaps as an attempt to soothe himself.
But, most of all, what made Steve sure of that change in Tony was the way he looked at him. Affection and admiration aside, there was something in his eyes that was different and was only there when Tony was little, something that Steve had previously seen in Clint’s – and that had helped to convince Steve Age Play could be something real - a certain curiosity, a certain innocence. Those big brown eyes twinkled in a way Steve have only see in children.
"Wow, I thought I'll have to drag you out of the workshop so we could have lunch together," Steve declared when he saw Tony stepping out of the elevator walking towards him.
"What's wrong?" Tony asked when he heard Steve ending the call and felt him getting up from the bed.
It was okay, it wasn’t like Steve was complaining. He loved cuddling with Tony and he didn’t really mind spending a few hours doing that. But that didn't mean that was all Steve wanted to do. The fact that Tony hid like that meant he wasn’t comfortable with all this yet. He was still getting stressed by the situation and he was supposed to be doing the opposite.
Half way through the movie, his eyelids began to feel very heavy; all the tiredness, stress and worries of the last month overpowering him. By then, Tony has pretty much given up his pursuit of finding a way to escape. Now the only thing that he was focusing on was trying not to fall asleep right there. Besides the fact he didn’t want to wake up with ink on his face – damn Clint – the mere fact of imagining Steve carrying him out of the room like a damsel in distress made him shudder. Or even worse, what if Steve scooped him up? – Tony doubted Steve would do such a thing when being in the same room with the others, but Tony couldn’t really help his paranoia sometimes.
Steve tucked the bottle under his arm so that he could scoop Tony up, and headed to their room. There was no hesitation in Tony’s movements when he wrapped all his limbs around Steve’s neck and waist, and he even tightened his embrace after Steve whispered in his ear how much he loved him. He also grunted when Steve began to pat his behind.
“No,” Tony kept denying. Steve pressed a kiss to his temple, not wanting him to get the wrong idea of him being mad.
“Because you had already agreed,” Steve couldn’t understand how Tony was able to change his mind so fast and easily. Had he done something wrong? Something that had scared him away?
“Easy, baby, Daddy got you,” Steve soothed, tightening his embrace. Tony hid his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, not wanting Steve to see the blush that had surely appeared on it. Seriously, why did that word uneased him that way? “We’re going to get you dressed and then we’re going have dinner while we watch a movie. There are some that look really good, and JARVIS assured me you haven’t seen them,” he informed on their way to the bedroom.
“I don’t recall making you come to bed,” Steve said, putting down the book on his lap, “but I’m very glad you’re here,” he hurried to add, not wanting Tony to take his comment in a bad way.
Certainly, Steve could argue every babyish thing he had done was caused by a valid reason, though he knew there were also some other things that hadn’t exactly happened because the circumstances so required. Lulling Clint to sleep on the rocking chair, giving him a sippy cup as if it was a bottle, and putting him down in the crib were definitely not necessary, and Steve was a little ashamed to recognize they were just the result of nostalgia.
Steve usually trained on his own for a couple of hours – at least – before he sparred with somebody, otherwise, by the time the session was over, he felt like he hadn’t exercise at all. However, Clint had been the one who had showed up in the communal living room looking for someone to train with, and as Bruce hadn’t seemed interested in that at all – he disliked to do anything that involved aggressiveness – Steve had felt obligated to go along with the proposal. It was just fair, Clint was the one who usually agreed to do anything Steve suggested when he was bored too.
“JARVIS, can you tell mister liar here that I don’t snore,” Tony asked, folding his arms over his chest.
“Ms. Potts won’t like it either if you give yourself a concussion,” JARVIS said when Tony banged his head down on the desk, a bit harder than he had intended. “May I make a suggestion, Sir?”
When Tony began doing things like getting all cuddly and clingy, sucking his thumb in apparent obliviousness and slipping the word ‘daddy’ here and there, Steve just smiled at him fondly – but knowingly – ruffled his hair affectionately, and continued doing whatever he’d been doing without commenting anything on the matter. Even the night Tony decided to take things perhaps a bit too far and wet the bed on purpose, Steve didn’t take the bait. He helped Tony to get into the shower, got rid of the soiled sheets and retrieved some new ones, made sure to comfort Tony but without making a big deal out of it, kissed him goodnight, and went back to sleep as if nothing had happened.
“Yes, you are,” Phil stated with a warning tone of voice. “Clint, I told you to stop that,” he ordered firmly when he heard Clint continued kicking the books. "Tony, I need you to tell me, does something hurt?"
Measuring himself was not something Steve tended to do when they – Clint and Tony, most of the time – sparred, after all, both of them were skilled in multiple forms of hand-to-hand combat, and were more than capable of defending themselves. But hitting any of them while there were in their littlespace was something Steve couldn’t even imagine doing without getting goosebumps. Steve would have never accepted to train with Clint if there had been the slightest chance that he might slip into his little headspace while they fought.
Tony tried to turn around and leave, he still wasn’t ready for the conversation Steve surely wanted to have with him, but Steve never lost his grip. Tony was literally dragged into the living room and pushed down on the sofa, a hand on his shoulder keeping him from standing up.
“Sit down,” Howard had ordered, and Tony walked to the chair in front of him, sitting down unsteadily. “What’s the meaning of this?” he asked, straight to the point.
But first, Tony needed to climb out that damn crib, which he was going to destroy too as soon as his feet were back on the ground. He stood up and staggered a little, the mattress was too soft to be able to stand still on it, so he held onto the side of the crib in order to maintain his balance. Once Tony could keep straight, his breathing stopped abruptly. The diaper had felt squishy when he tried to close his legs. No, this couldn’t be happening to him. With hesitation and dread, Tony took his hand down his diapered crotch and squeezed it. Yes, he had definitely made use of it.
Steve shook his head in disapproval, “no wonder why Pepper gets so angry with you sometimes. But don’t worry, we’re already here, you’d be able to go back to your workshop to continue stalling your duties,” he promised. Although, if everything turned out the way Steve wanted, Tony would stay there, having some quality time with his daddy.
Unlike Steve’s patience, Tony’s was practically non-existent. When Tony saw the other man open his mouth in order to ask him the same exact question again, his anger clouded his judgment and silenced the internal voice that was telling him no to do what he did. Tony threw a punch at Steve’s face as hard as he could. Obviously Steve didn’t even flinch, while Tony let himself fall onto the floor, holding his wrist with the other hand, a grimace on his face.
As carefully as possible, Steve closed the door and sighed with relief. When Tony had come back, he had been cranky and on the edge, and even if his eyelids dropped with exhaustion, Tony had been unable to fall asleep. Steve had had to give him a long relaxing bubble bath and rocked him back and forth for over thirty minutes before Tony could finally driff off to dreamland. Dealing with a fussy Tony was something Steve didn’t mind at all, he even thought Tony was kind of cute when he was a bit moody, but as much as Steve wanted to look after his baby and spend time with him, he preferred Tony to sleep.
“Daddy!” The words came out before Tony could stop them. He felt a sob finally managing to escape from his throat and his mortification increased greatly once his sight turned blurry. Was he really going to cry?
Fortunately, Tony was not one to give up easily, and he still had some ideas to finally get Steve to understand what he was trying to say with his actions.
“You really don’t get it, do you?” Tony snapped, not refraining his face from showing how angry he was anymore, “For someone who’s always saying communication is the most important thing in a relationship, you sure can be very manipulative and evasive when it’s
“I. Said. Shut. Up,” Tony repeated, maybe a bit too roughly, but, dammit! JARVIS deserved it, because if it hadn’t been for him, if he hadn’t been nagging him ceaselessly until Tony had no other option but to call it for the night, he wouldn’t have gone to bed and he wouldn’t have had that stupid bad dream. Chances were that he would’ve ended up having a serious accident if he’d stayed in the workshop, though right now that scenario certainly seemed much more appealing than his current one.
They headed towards the guest room that somehow had ended up turning into a playroom for Tony over the last weeks. Steve had taken out all the unnecessary furniture and had refurnished the room with stuff more accurate for Tony’s little self. The only thing that Steve had kept was the bed. Now, there was a street map carpet that covered almost all the surface of the floor; several chests, baskets and shelfs to keep all the toys he and Tony had bought – which were a very considerable number – a bookshelf with plenty of books from which Steve liked to choose and read to Tony, sitting on the rocking chair next to it; a changing table big enough to support Tony; and some other stuff. Steve had even taken the time to repaint the walls and now one of them showed cartoonish dinosaurs on it – the fact that Tony had acquired a certain attachment to a tyrannosaurus rex stuffie hadn’t gone unnoticed.
But it wasn’t, this wasn’t okay. Tony was an adult and he shouldn’t need someone to comfort him after a nightmare. And yet, Steve arms around him made him feel so good that Tony couldn’t bring himself to regain his composure and send Steve away. Instead, he let Steve console him.
A nursery. Steve had set up a nursery for him. That shouldn't have caught Tony by surprised, after all, Steve’s intention of what role he wanted Tony to play had always been clear. Turning their guest room into a playroom showed perfectly well that a nursery would eventually be the end result. Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t expecting it somehow. It was never a matter of whether it was going to happen or not, but rather of
Honestly, Tony was glad he had ended up falling asleep, he wasn’t sure what Steve would have tried to do if he hadn’t. Perhaps, Steve would have kept trying to persuade him to do something he wasn’t comfortable with yet – even if he kind of wanted to be – so this had been the best ending scenario. Tony yawned deeply, feeling how his eyelids became heavier and heavier. Certainly, he would have to deal with Steve the next day – or in a few hours, he really didn’t know what time it was – but right now he was feeling to sleepy to force himself to do anything but going back to sleep.
Trying not to feel so nervous and impatient, Steve fidgeted a bit and slipped his hands in and out of his pockets, not really knowing where to put them. His eyes were fixed on Tony, looking for anything that could give him a hint of what was going on inside his mind, but Tony’s face continued inexpressive. After what seemed forever, Tony opened his mouth as if he was finally going to say something, but no words were uttered, so he closed it again.
Did Steve miss Tony that much? Well, apparently, he did. He wasn’t handling this situation as well as he had thought. They hadn’t broken up or anything of the sort, their romantic relationship was pretty much stable as far as Steve concerned. Their daddy-baby relationship, on the other hand, had been practically non-existent. The decision Tony had made had been decisive, and ever since that day, Steve hadn’t had the chance to hang out with his baby.
Things got even worse after that day, at least from Tony’s perspective. Besides constantly finding himself wanting to suck his thumb, hug a stuffed animal or run to Steve’s – daddy’s – arms; now, every time he knew Steve was going to be away for at least a day, Tony felt very tempted to go to the nursery and nap in the crib. He knew he shouldn’t, if he was ever going to leave all that stupid Age Play thing behind he couldn’t continue allowing himself to succumb to those urges anymore.
Tony bent down and pushed a button on his suit, which immediately pulled all the pieces together and flew them out of the room. Feeling surprisingly heavy, he walked toward the door with the intention of leaving once and for all. He would take care of the mess later, otherwise he was sure the remorse – which he wasn’t really feeling yet – would make him try to put everything back together again.
"Wow!" Clint expressed after Steve opened the door of the former guest room. "Can I really play in here?" he asked, excitement clear in his voice.
“It doesn’t always turn out well,” Tony pointed out, and soon after a thoughtful frown joined his eyebrows together, maybe as a result of realizing that statement didn’t help him that much. Luckily for him, Steve had no intention of discussing that subject, at least for now.
Steve crouched down beside him, “don’t you think it’s a daddy’s job to provide his baby with toys?” he asked, lips curling in that condescending smile he always wore when he was in what Tony came to recognize as his ‘daddy mode’. “Why did you buy them?” he insisted after a few seconds, once it was obvious Tony wasn’t going to answer the previous question. Tony shrugged. “Not in a talking mood?” Tony shook his head, earning a sigh from Steve. “Okay, I guess we’ll have to clean this up in silence.”
At the beginning, Steve had thought about taking it slowly, restarting with the things that he had already done when he was trying to get Tony into Age Play. Steve knew from the start he wanted Tony to be a baby, not a toddler like Clint, but he doubted Tony was going to be so keen on giving that a try. So, taking it little by little would help the idea to sink in Tony’s mind.
For some reason, he had thought that once he slipped into a littlespace, his adult self would somehow go to sleep or something, and that would be when a younger version of him would go to the surface and take control of himself. That was the only way Tony could make sense of how a person could behave like he had seen Clint doing. Clint cried, had accidents, amused himself with toys, made mischiefs, and so on. No even once had Tony gotten the sensation Clint was faking it. It felt real. Tony couldn’t see that behavior happening if the adult side of a person was consciously there.
It would take Steve a few more days to realize there had been only one thing Tony had never pointed at or touched, but for the time being, he was more than satisfied with how everything turned out to be that day.
“Do you think you were the only one who was distracted?” That earned Steve a look of disbelief. “I was out of focus during all battle, maybe even more than you. I should’ve seen the attack coming long before I did, but I didn’t, and that’s why I didn’t have enough time to move you out of the way and avoid the hit too.” Tony looked up at him, brows drawn together in clear disapproval. “Yes, Tony. I’m the Captain, I’ve got to keep my head in the battle all the time, no matter what, otherwise, I won’t be able to lead you correctly. If anything, what happened was nobody else’s fault but mine,” he acknowledged.
“JARVIS, is Tony coming to this room without letting me know?” Steve asked, hands still holding the dinosaur printed sheet, face looking up.
“Yeah, I’m still here. Yes, a large pizza with extra cheese, that correct,” Steve said into the phone, “are you sure you don’t want peperoni?” he said into Tony’s ear, but Tony shook his head as the grip in his shirt tightened. The small frown on Tony’s face told Steve he was still a bit resentful for being put down on the counter while he made the phone call, so Steve refrained himself from insisting. “Okay, thank you so much,” he said before hanging up.
“Shut it, you should know better than to betray your own creator,” Tony said, looking at the roof. He had mocked everybody for looking up every time JARVIS spoke, but instead of making them break that habit, he had picked it up himself. “One of these days you’re gonna try my patience, and I’m gonna turn you into an alarm clock, so the only thing you can say is the hour and everybody will hit you when you wake them up,” Tony warned, though everyone knew those were empty threats, Tony couldn’t live without the A.I.
Keeping everything the way it was also showed that Steve would always be there waiting patiently, that Tony could give Age Play a second chance if he wanted to. If anything was given away, Tony could think he didn’t have that choice anymore.
“But there are not any pull-ups left.” It was true. Steve had gone downstairs to Clint’s and Phil’s floor and he hadn’t found any pull-ups. They must have run out, and Phil had been summoned to SHIELD before he had the opportunity to buy more.
"Actually, I'm starving," Tony declared. The fact that he had been staring at the clock ever since JARVIS announced him Steve had started to cook, waiting for the hour Tony knew Steve usually finished, had nothing to do with the reason why he had decided to go upstairs before Steve went to retrieve him. Except that, it kind of did.
leaving you,” Steve assured, eyebrows lightly drawn together in a frown as he looked back on the last weeks, attempting and failing to spot any action that might have caused Tony to get that impression. “I’m serious,” he said when he heard Tony giving a non-comical noise. “Hey, Tony, hey, look at me… Baby, look at me, please.”
So far, all play dates had been pretty much the same. Steve retrieved Tony from his workshop, fed him, bath him, and right after Steve put a diaper on him, Tony went on ashamed mode. Steve had to spend a lot of time coaxing him to stop hiding behind whatever Tony had gotten his hands on. And that only last for a few minutes, because Tony would latch onto him as soon as he had the opportunity, so tightly that there was no way Steve could detach Tony from him without feeling remorseful.
“Is there something wrong, baby?” Steve questioned, sensing Tony’s reluctance. Tony shook his head hesitatingly.
After a quick trip to the communal kitchen, where he left some burgers just in case someone wanted some, he walked back the elevator, and asked JARVIS to take him where Tony was.
The downside was that, Steve tended to borrow Tony’s tablet without letting him now even if Tony had given him one for himself. It wasn’t a big deal, Tony was all ‘what’s mine if yours’ with Steve and he really didn’t mind lending it to him. The thing was that, even if Steve was a pretty organized person, he tended to forget giving his tablet back, and when Tony needed to use it, it was never on the place he had left it. Which led him to his current predicament, where the hell had Steve left his tablet?
Tony was jealous, yes, he had no doubt about that. But he was also sure Clint himself wasn’t the one he was jealous of, but his little counterpart.
, Phil thought to himself before turning around and starting walking towards the door; adult Tony didn’t seem to be very fond of being touched, so it was very probable that little Tony didn’t like it either. Out of the corner of his eye, Phil could see Tony squirming a little, clearly indecisive whether to follow him or not, only taking some steps forward when Phil reached the door and open it.
Well, I know I promised the next chapter to be longer (and it is, but not that much) but then it would be too long, and when I started this story I promised myself I would keep the chapters shorter so I didn't get too stressed or took a lot of time to update it.
“Don’t you want to go and play with Clint, baby?” Steve encouraged after realizing Tony’s eyes were fixed on Clint. Tony shook his head and snuggled closer to him, sucking his thumb with a rhythm that told Steve he still was a bit uneasy. Steve couldn’t complain, at least he had stop crying and didn’t seem upset anymore. “Why not? It’s going to be fun. Maybe you two could take your remote control cars and race them,” he suggested, Tony kept refusing.
Steve had no idea for how long he rocked Tony back and forth trying to get him to sleep, but Tony just wouldn’t close his eyes. In any case, it was him and not Tony the one who was falling asleep. That was certainly unusual, since Steve never took naps, and if he did, it was only because Tony didn’t want to sleep alone. Maybe he was more stressed than he realized, and that was draining his energy away.
"No! It's nothing like that! You got it all wrong!" Steve assured, walking around the kitchen's island to move closer to Tony, though he stopped when Tony looked like he would leave if he got any closer. "It's nothing about sex, its nothing about wanting to humiliate you! It's just,… I… I thought it would be a viable way to help you to cope with everything," Steve informed, staying a few inches away from the sofa.
Steve didn’t think that was a big deal, the fact that Tony had progressed that much didn’t mean that he had stopped being ashamed for liking such childish things. He blushed when he was being bathed, he blushed when he was drinking from a bottle, he blushed when he found himself sucking his thumb. It was understandable, Steve figured Tony’s adult side had to be struggling a lot trying to come terms with all this. Eventually, Tony would cease blushing, and Steve had to admit he would miss it. According to him, that blush made Tony looked cuter.
“Next time you’ll look after both of them, and then you’ll tell me whether it’s hard or not,” Steve challenged. Phil chuckled once more. The way Steve sat up a bit to be able to press a kiss on the back of Tony’s head as his left hand ruffled Clint’s hair showed how little he minded taking care of them.
Steve kept smiling as Tony squirmed trying to figure out what to choose next. The rocking chair was one of the things Tony wanted to keep, that meant he liked being held and rocked while being read a book or fed a bottle, right? Because Steve had no recollection whatsoever of seeing him sitting there by himself, not even once. That certainly made Steve happy, since having the chance to cuddle his baby and see how he adorably fought a lost battle against sleep was something he really enjoyed doing, and it would’ve been a real shame if he wasn’t allowed to do anymore.
It didn’t take a lot of time for Tony to lean his head down on Steve’s shoulder, feeling sleepy as a result of the stress, his tiredness, hand numbness and Steve’s rocking –when had he started to do that? Tony couldn’t tell.
“No, I’d be a daddy. A very good one, if I may say so,” Steve assured, leaning a bit so he could speak to Tony in the ear, “and you know what daddies do when stubborn kids don’t do as they’re told?” he asked, Tony shook his head as an answer, “they-tickle-them-until-they-agree-to-obey,” he informed slurring fast so Tony didn’t have time to react to what he was about to do.
“Wait a minute, sweetpea, daddy needs to calm Clint down.” Steve explained, Tony shook his head for the umpteenth time that day. Steve took a deep, deep breath.
“I don’t like them, they’re all baby books. I’m a big boy,” Clint declared after kicking some of the books.
Tony threw his hands in the air as he exclaimed, “oh, c’mon!”, before letting himself fall backwards. “I hate you,” he muttered behind a pillow.
After a lot of soothing, Phil had managed to calm down Clint enough to listen to him, and he had made him promise to be a good boy, to listen to Steve and do everything he asked him to do. It hadn't been easy, and Clint refused to agree to anything until Phil promised to come back home that night at the latest. Phil then told Steve he was going to do everything in his power to stay true to his promise, and Steve hoped he really did. He wasn’t sure how to handle a disappointed little Clint.
Clint’s presence didn’t bother him as much as he had thought. Tony would probably avoid him for the next couple of days, after all, wearing a diaper in front of him was embarrassing, but not as embarrassing as it would have been if Clint hadn’t been wearing – and using – one too. However, what did bother Tony was the fact that he was still there.
After some more minutes of being frozen there, the armor bearer gave up and sat down on the floor next to the door, arms crossed in front on his chest. He hated how shaky he was feeling, he hated how Steve’s tone of voice could almost make him feel like a grounded child. He was starting to get into that headspace which he loaded so much, and exhaustion wasn’t helping at all.
“Now it’s your turn, baby boy,” Steve announced, turning around to face Tony. Tony shook his head vehemently, and resisted a little when Steve placed both arms on his upper arms and guided him towards the edge of the bed. “No? Don’t you want daddy to help you change into something more comfortable?” he asked, Tony had never been reluctant to let himself being changed. Embarrassed, but not reluctant.
“My pleasure, Captain,” JARVIS answered. “Just one thing Sir, Agent Barton is asking for permission to be given access,” he informed just after Steve had sat down on the couch. “Should I let him enter?”
What exactly did Steve have in mind? What would he do after Tony told him he wanted to play? He’d said he wanted to know what Tony liked and didn’t like, but how would that happen? Would Steve ask Tony to sit down and plainly tell him everything? Would Tony have to admit to Steve he’d come to like pretty much every babyish activity they’d tried? Did Steve want Tony to start asking for everything and not only for a play date? Would Tony have to request diaper changes and all the other stuff?
“Tony, baby,” Steve called, left hand caressing Tony’s belly gently, “it’s time to wake up sweetheart.” Tony stirred slightly under the touch, but he gave no signs of opening his eyes any time soon.
Though, having his baby sound asleep next to him as he saw how the city slowly came awake made it all worthwhile.
“Well, then we need to talk about it and come to a mutual agreement,” Steve explained before dropping a kiss onto his cheek. Tony leaned in closer, clearly enjoying the display of affection. “So?”
“Do you want Daddy to carry you?” Tony nodded enthusiastically, face still hidden. “Come here, then,” Steve said, and Tony was already running towards him and throwing himself to his arms before Steve had even finished that sentence.
“How about an animated movie? There are a few I still haven’t watched, which one do you recommend me?”
“Hey,” Steve greeted once Tony was brave enough to glimpse at him. If he noticed and minded the several inches Tony had decided to leave between them when he flopped down onto the sofa, he commented nothing about it, though the way he pursed his lips indicated he’d already begun wondering what Tony was up to.
“Sir, do you want me to run the test again?” JARVIS asked him. Even if it wasn’t technically possible, Tony could sense some annoyance in the tone of JARVIS’s voice. Perhaps this wasn’t the first time the A.I. asked that question. Unfortunately, Tony was finding very difficult to concentrate. He got the feeling he had been staring at the hologram in front of him for a long time, and somehow he wouldn’t be able to say what was he working on if someone asked.
Was there an emergency? Was that Fury calling him? That was very unlikely, if any of the Avengers was required for a mission, Fury had JARVIS notify them, since sometimes they didn't hear their phones ring – especially Clint.
“Don’t you like Clint?” Steve blurted. If he allowed Tony to continue talking, he would never stop. He tended to do that when he got nervous, and serious conversation always had that effect on him.
But Steve never intended to raise the subject again, Tony became aware of that later. His method was subtler. Nobody would have never noticed but Tony. And when he put two and two together, Tony had already been a lost cause, gotten too used to being paid attention to and cared for to be truly mad at Steve.
Indeed, Tony hated not being able to completely understand why Steve seemed to be OK with the whole situation.
After what seemed forever, his brain began registering his surroundings, realizing he was in fact not back in any cave and there was nobody trying to drown him. His breathing went back to normal little by little, and, with his heart still beating faster than normal, he flopped back down to the bed, grimacing when he felt the cold and sweat-dampened sheets under him.
“I don’t want to,” Tony said, his eyes staring at the diaper that Steve had put on the nightstand. Steve’s eyes followed Tony’s.
With hunched shoulders and evasive eyes, Tony reached for the now-free pillow and hugged it against his chest, lowering his head and pressing his mouth against the soft material. “I dun wanna.”
“Do you really want to go to bed without wearing one while we are sharing the bed?” And that was the only thing he needed to say in order to convince him. Because Tony might not like the idea of wearing diapers, but he liked it more than the idea of wetting the bed while he was sleeping next to Steve.
Steve cleaned up his baby, diapered him and manhandled him into the onesie, movements quick and nimble but cautious and loving at the same time. To his surprise, Tony didn’t try to hide nor did he look away as he tended to do; his cheeks never quite lost its reddish shade and his thumb never slipped out of his mouth, but his eyes were fixed on Steve during all the process, and there was a glint in them that revealed how he was enjoying this.
“I… I don’t need th-them.” he mumbled as he ducked his head and looked at his hands, making eye-contact was something Tony couldn’t bring himself to do right now.
“You’ll be late,” Tony said with a surprisingly tiny voice, and even if he was kicking Steve out in a way, his hands kept clutching his shirt.
A few minutes later, after he’d gotten a little bit more hold of himself, Tony felt tempted to turn his head around to look at Steve’s face to see his expression, and that desire only got stronger when Steve failed to utter a single sound. Why was he so quiet? Was he waiting for Tony to proceed? Was Tony supposed to list the things he liked and disliked at that very moment? Or had Tony been wrong and Steve hadn’t been paying attention to him and, consequently, he hadn’t heard him?
Tony refused to drink from anything that wasn’t the sippy cup, and Clint refused to lose his grip on it. He even kept holding it when they finished having lunch and moved to the living room. It was until Tony snatched the controllers of the video game console which Clint planned on playing with, that Clint agreed to let him use his sippy cup.
However, when Steve recovered a week later (and Tony couldn’t help feeling a bit jealous of the serum healing properties, since the last time he broke one of his ribs, it took him five long weeks to recuperate) Tony was left without any excuse. Fortunately, on the following days, some board meetings, as well as various unfinished projects and a few calls to assemble hadn't allowed Tony to even think about that issue.
"Tony?" Steve called with a drowsy voice, propping himself up on his elbows. Damn timing! Why had he woken up just now? Tony hadn't even had time to register what had just happened. "What’s the matter? What are you doing there?" he said, reaching for the lamp on the nightstand and turning it on. Tony felt his face heating up, his diaper would surely look different now that it was soaked, and Steve would definitely notice that.
How thrilling it was to see his baby selecting the crib! Steve had assumed for a while that the crib had been one of the things that had broken the camel’s back, and he regretted having taken things that far to the point he was going to get rid of pretty much every babyish item he’d acquired. Therefore, it felt really good to know Steve hadn’t been that amiss.
A hand on his shoulder made him jump for the second time that day. Apparently, he had dozen off again while trying to figure out how to get out of there. Was he really that exhausted? Falling asleep like that wasn’t that common in him even if he hadn’t closed his eyes for more than twenty minutes in a week.
However, Tony wasn’t going to give in. He had been dealing with this being-caught-between-two-headspaces thing for more than thirty years now, so this was nothing he couldn’t handle. Tony just had to do what he always did in these cases: bury himself in his workshop, drinking unhealthy quantities of alcohol and ignoring any comment JARVIS may say about it. That always worked. That helped him to distract his mind and force it not to think about the craving.
"Well, is there something you wouldn't like to do?" Steve wanted to know. Tony shook his head as an answer, feeling worse. If this was something that had been running through his mind for a while, he should have at least an idea of the things he would like to try. Apparently, all the research he had done had been in vain, he felt extremely clueless. "Hey, relax, it's OK," Steve soothed, surely noticing how tensed Tony's body was getting.  "C'mon here," Steve asked.
By the time the night fell, Phil was exhausted. Tony’s fever had decreased considerably, though he had started to cough more often, complaining about having a sore throat. Clint had gotten fussier than ever, and demanded Phil’s total attention, making Phil suspect that he was feeling a little jealous. He drew on the walls instead of looking after Tony like Phil had asked him to do while he went to the kitchen to fix dinner. He made a complete mess when he ate, and Phil had to shower him for the second time that day. He ran all over the floor trying to prevent Phil from dressing him. It became very obvious that Clint was behaving that way to keep Phil away Tony, but Phil couldn't do that.
His bladder clenched again not happy with the hold-up, taking Tony out of his stupor. He needed to go
Not wanting to extend the process more than it was necessary, Steve hurried to clean Tony up, tossed the soaked diaper into the trash and a put a new one on after sprinkling some powder between his thighs. By the time Steve snapped the onesie shut, Tony had closed his eyes again, and when Steve got away from the bed to put away all the supplies, Tony took advantage and rolled over his tummy, hugging a pillow tightly.
“This is nice,” Steve informed before brushing a kiss over his forehead. Tony looked up at him, his cheeks growing faintly pink; and even if he smiled back when Steve smiled reassuringly at him, he ended up hiding his face against Steve’s chest. “Sweetpea, I was serious, I meant what I said. I’ve got no problem with being your daddy again. I
Why was Tony already there? He didn’t even know that himself. He had had one more hour to think up something, but apparently his brain was rusting, because he could literally think of nothing – or at least nothing that wouldn’t end up in a spanking. Maybe during dinner Tony would come up with a brilliant idea.
Everybody left, that was what Tony had stated, and Steve couldn’t refute it wasn’t a well-grounded assumption. Some way or another, people had abandoned Tony throughout his life, and even if some of those departures had been for the best – Steve didn’t even want to imagine how Tony’s life would be if Obadiah Stane were still alive – that didn’t mean they hadn’t left a mark on Tony. They had hurt, and they had scarred his trust on people in a way that it would take a lot of work and time for him to heal.
I wrote this in my job, with no internet (we haven't had Internet in more than a week, which is awful because we can't really work like that and is soooo freaking boring) so, I couldn't really look up for some words or expressions that I wasn't sure how to express. So, if there are more mistakes than usual, sorry in advance (let me know if you see any n_n')
“Come on, it can’t be that hard,” Phil commented, walking towards the rocking chair. By the time he sat down on it, Steve had opened his eyes and was now glaring at him, though Phil couldn’t feel any malice or resentment in his glare.
“Hey Tony, would you like to…” Tony heard Steve say, startling him out of his stupor. He had been so lost in thought that he hadn’t even heard Steve’s footsteps as he descended the stairs. “Jesus, what happened in here? What are all these boxes?” Steve asked, looking around, eyebrows furrowed in confusion.
“Well, actually that's good to know. I was talking to Phil this morning and he told me he was going to go on a mission that might last a week or so, you know that undercover missions can last more than expected,” Steve commented, playing close attention to Tony's reaction. His features certainly hardened in spite of himself. “The thing is, he asked me to look after Clint while he's away, you know, just in case he’s feeling little, and now that I know you have no problem with that, I’m gonna tell him–"
"Lying!" Clint accused, and he had all the right to do so. Truth to be told, Steve didn’t even know if there were pull-ups in Phil’s and Clint’s floor, he hadn’t gone there to check.
“Because, unlike you, I do like healthy food.” Steve commented, poking some broccoli with his fork and taking it to his mouth.
Steve’s brow creased. “Sorry? Sorry for what?” Tony gave a shake of his head as he curled up tighter. “Oh, no, no, no, we’re not doing this, Tony, not anymore.” Steve warned, “I don’t want vague or incomplete answers that are probably going to lead me to draw incorrect conclusions. We’ve been doing that, and look, it hasn’t gotten us anywhere good. So, please, stop hiding and tell me what you’re apologizing for,” he finished, a note of firmness in his voice. He wanted Tony to know he was bound and determined about this.
“C’mon Tony, it’s not that bad, I’m pretty sure you’d like it! I mean, I’ve been showing you how it’d be like and you haven’t really hated it, have you?” Steve risked saying, because pointing out that wasn’t a good idea right now.
bath toys, Tony felt something he couldn’t really understand, and found himself experiencing a strong urge to cry.
Even though Steve was certain Tony was trying to be as silent as possible, he heard him since the moment he opened the door. Perhaps because he had been awake, perhaps because the serum had improved his hearing greatly, or perhaps because Tony’s mere presence disencumbered Steve, the knot in his chest uncurling a little.
“Tony, buddy, why don’t you come out of there?” Phil suggested, peeking under the bed where Tony had hidden. He had reached the door just in time to prevent Tony from locking it, but he hadn’t been able to stop him from crawling under the bed. “It was just an accident, you don’t have to worry about it. It happens,” he consoled, stretching his arm so he could caress Tony’s leg, but that only make him curl in tighter.
No matter how much Phil called Tony, for the next several minutes the only thing Phil could hear were Tony’s sobs as well the quiet pleas for his daddy to come. Phil may well have gone inside the closet and tried to comfort him, but he thought it would be better to give Tony some space and time so the idea that he would have to spend the rest of the day with him and Clint sank in. Perhaps that was also one of the reasons why Tony was crying.
Phil held out a hand, smiling encouragingly at Tony, but he just stared at it without any intention of taking it.
When Tony nodded, Steve proceeded, “Thank you, sweetheart, you have no idea of how happy I am to be your daddy again. But you know, if we’re going to keep doing this, I want us to do it correctly,” he informed, earning a wary look from Tony. “So far I’ve led you through this because you weren’t sure about what you wanted. I took a lot of liberties because I wanted to show you that there was no limit on what you could have, what we could do, or how far we could take this. But I think you’ve experienced enough to know now what you really like and what you don’t.”
“You can’t be by yourself, kiddo. Remember you promised your daddy you’d stay with me when you’re little and he’s not here,” Steve reminded, leaning enough to reach Clint’s knee, which only caused Clint to curled in tighter. “Don’t you want to be with me?” he asked, and he couldn’t deny it hurt a bit when Clint shook his head. “Come on, let’s go and order another pizza, I’ll let you dial.”
This wasn’t the first time Steve looked after them at the same time, and he had no problem with doing that. But, somehow, his gut feeling was that this time wasn’t going to be as easy as it had been the last time. While he left the bedroom with a sobbing baby in his left arm and an energetic toddler by the right hand, Steve mentally wished they could spend an uneventful afternoon.
“What the fuck?! Put me down right now!” Kicking was never going to do anything to Steve, but at least he had to do something to try get rid of his grip. Steve didn’t even bother to answer. “JARVIS, close the door!” He demanded when he realized Steve started walking toward it.
“The fuck Anthony, I don’t have time for this shit!” This time Howard emphasized on his words by slamming pounding his fists down on the top of the desk, making Tony literally jump in his seat.
Clint might have said that the whole age play thing was something between him and Phil, and there was no doubt he had meant that, because neither he nor Phil – nor Steve – had brought up the topic again. Good, Steve did not want any other metal picture to stick in his mind and keep company with the one he was already having problems to get rid of. But now that Steve had found out about it, he had a hunch that the this-is-just-between-us thing wasn’t going to last long.
"Yes, you already slept enough. Now, why don't we go and make your tummy happy by giving it some delicious pasta?" Steve suggested, stroking Tony’s back. Tony whined again while he curled up into a ball. "You can continue sleeping after you eat something."
"Pizza will be here any minute," Steve informed as he started to set up the table. Tony kept glaring, slouching at the chair. “And sit up, please.”
Putting Tony to sleep wasn’t any easier than it had been earlier that day, he’d gotten pretty clingy throughout the course of the evening to the point of being shamelessly whiny if Steve stopped petting him, cuddling him, kissing him or doing any sort of display of affection for more than five minutes, but it wasn’t like Steve minded at all. That was why, after several failed attempts, Steve decided to climb into the crib with Tony and let him practically roll over him, perhaps as a way to assure he wouldn’t sneak out on him while he slept.
But the Board’s requests weren’t the problem. Adding new stuff wasn’t the problem either, he already had thousands of ideas. The problem was he just couldn’t put his mind into it. He’d been locked in his workshop for more than…, actually he couldn’t remember how many days, but at least he was kind of sure it wasn’t more than a week. His cell phone was turned off. No alarms rang to summon him to SHIELD. Bruce was off to somewhere around Africa doing who knows what to ease his mind, so he didn’t share his space with anyone at the moment who could distract him. Even DUM-E hadn’t set his workshop on fire! He hadn’t had any distraction at all! And even like that, he hadn’t been able to completely concentrate! And that’s what was starting to give him a headache.
“Leave it to you to stub with furniture every time you can,” Steve commented, refraining himself from moving closer to Tony and rub his toes.
And it would have been great if the little quarrel had stopped there, but Steve’s luck seemed to be failing colossally that day. Clint hadn’t wanted to play video games by himself, and he had asked Steve to play with him. That wouldn’t have been an issue if Tony hadn’t insisted that Steve held the sippy cup for him while drank the juice. With both hands.
Not wanting to believe it, Steve sighed deeply, because, despite what he wanted, what JARVIS had said made sense.
“Tony… hey buddy… relax… come on, breathe buddy,” Steve said as he looked how the other man’s expression changed from worry to terror. “Tony, it’s all right, I swear it’s all right. I really don’t care about it. I’m totally OK with it, I promise. And I will never tell anyone about this if that’s what you’re worrying about, I promise… come on, calm down.”
It didn’t hurt that much, Steve’s pain threshold was quite high, so he’d flinched and groaned through sheer reflex, something that Tony hadn’t been able to understand at that moment. In between sobs and apologies, Tony ran to hide under Clint’s bed, and it took Steve far longer to lure him out of there; his baby’s babbles and cries preventing him from hearing Steve’s claims that everything was okay, that he hadn’t hurt him.
“I–,” Tony trailed off, failing to find a valid excuse to justify why he was still there, why he hadn’t run off with Phil and Clint when the former got informed Steve was allowed to receive visitors. There was no way Tony was going to tell her he was afraid of seeing him. What if what Steve wanted to talk about was bad news, and this incident just worsened everything?
turn of saying what’s in your mind. You’re a pain whenever I don’t want to talk about something, but now that you were the one who should’ve talked, you go and do this?” he reproached, “Why didn’t you come and tell me what you wanted? Why did you prefer to be all sneaky about it?” he asked, voice serene, but pissed.
Stupid, stupid, stupid. Tony couldn’t find another word to describe himself right now. Steve was bedridden and wounded because of him, and the only thing Tony could think of doing was to make a scene like the one he’d done. What the hell was wrong with him? He should’ve apologized to Steve, he should’ve asked how Steve was, he should’ve found out what Steve’s injures were, he should’ve done something to make Steve feel better, but he didn’t. Instead, Tony went and hurt Steve even more, because shoving off Clint of Steve’s lap the way he had when they were hugging must have put some pressure over Steve’s wounds.
Steve sighed. “Let him in,” he said, getting up from the sofa and walking towards the elevator, voice hesitant.
Steve would have liked to say that Tony fell asleep no longer after that, but he didn’t. Tony kept dozing on and off for almost an hour, stiffing several times when his eyes opened and his adult mindset was stronger, whimpering almost imperceptibly when his little mindset had won the battle and he could sense the pain coming from his hand. But thankfully, Tony didn’t try to get away. All Steve needed to do was to pull him closer again and to keep rocking him, humming a lullaby he didn’t even recognize. Tony had been craving for this his all life, he just needed a push in order to gather the enough courage to take it, and Steve was more than willing to give that push.
“I’m sorry, I don’t get what you’re saying,” Steve declared, finally taking his eyes off Clint to look at Phil. Maybe eye contact was necessary for him to understand what Phil wanted to say, because he was not following him at all.
Whatever the reason it was, taking a nap sounded like a wonderful idea for the time being, the only thing Steve needed was to figure out how to get both littles to sleep. Tony wouldn’t be a problem, even if he was obstinately trying to stay awake, Steve knew it was a matter of time before he finally surrendered to sleep. Clint, on the other hand, loathed naps. No matter how they tried to reason with him, nor how tired he was, for Clint naps were something only babies did, and he was not a baby.
Why was Clint there? Wasn't Jarvis supposed to denied all access when Steve and he were in the middle of a play date? Or had Steve been the one who had let him in? Why? Tony might not have cared that Phil and Clint knew what Steve and he were doing – after all, they were into the same thing anyway – thought that didn’t mean Tony was willing to hang out with them. Not yet at least.
“You don’t?” Tony shook his head. “So, you’re also a liar on the top of all of this. I didn’t raise you to be a liar, Anthony.”
Unless Steve didn’t consider himself Tony’s daddy anymore. It had been that thought the one that had made Tony lose his temper, because it could be perfectly possible. And the worst part was Tony wouldn’t have the right to complain about it, since he himself had been the one who had drove Daddy away.
Steve hadn’t really minded, urine was far from being the worst thing he’d had to deal with and he’d already known that accidents as well as other kind of incidents would become commonplace once Tony got used to his baby role. The problem was that Tony didn’t take it as well as Steve, and cleaning up an even fussier baby when you could use just one arm turned out to be utterly grueling.
“In my defense, I can’t make myself do anything else until I finish a drawing. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with an idea, and I need to draw it, otherwise I can’t go back to sleep.” Steve confessed, a hand scratching nervously the back of his neck, already knowing this wasn’t what Tony would like to hear.
In spite of himself, Tony frequently wondered how it would be like. How it would be like to have a father who truly worried about him, who cared about his wellbeing and happiness, who gave preference to his needs and likes, who could be completely trusted. How it would be to let himself be a kid, because Tony had to face it, he was never really given that chance. And yes, he was aware of the fact that he wasn’t a kid anymore, and Steve was the furthest thing of being a father, but, that was the whole point of roleplaying, wasn’t it? Pretending to be someone you weren’t in real life, and Age Play was just that, a form of roleplaying.
"Clint, pleased stop moving," Steve begged, trying to catch his knees to prevent him from continuing squirming.
“Sorry, baby boy, this is not up for discussion.” Steve warned, giving Tony another cuddle before he had to maneuver his way out of the crib. They could really use some shut-eye, but for that to happen, some painkillers for Steve as well as a bottle for Tony would be indispensable.
“I can’t say anything about something I don’t even know what is,” Steve replied, “Really Phil, I’m completely lost here.”
“The freaking bed got in my way,” Tony explained, sitting on the edge of the bed, his feet still in his hand. Steve couldn’t help chuckling, he would never understand how Tony always managed to bump into things in his own room. “Did you move it?” Tony accused.
“I can’t, I have a lot of work to do,” Tony stated, trying his best to look as he was busy with something. If he could just remember what that something was, his act would have been more realistic.
“That’s cheating!” Tony yelled right before Steve stopped tickling his ribs just to proceed to blow raspberries against his sensible belly.
Tony’s whole body hurt. Not in a way that made him think there was something seriously wrong with him, but not in a way he could ignore either. Even if it was hard for Tony to admit it, chances were he was coming down with something, which wasn’t that surprising.
“No! I-I w-want the bri-icks,” Clint refused, just as he had been doing over the last fifteen minutes.
“I won’t even start on how wrong and blasphemous that phrase was,” Steve commented, a smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. A low groan escaped from Tony’s lips, the sound muffled by the mattress and the pillow. “How are you feeling?” he asked. Tony mumbled something not even Steve’s supersoldier hearing could comprehend. “Okay, I don’t know about you, but I think that pillow’s in the way.”
“It doesn’t look like it,” Tony accused, his pout deepening. “Looks like that book’s more interesting than me.”
Although they would never reach that point if Steve kept stalling the talk, if he just kept tricking Tony into have moments like this. Yes, they were great, but they would be much better once Tony knew the whole thing.
“'teve,” Tony called, breaking Steve’s train of thought. Shoot! He had gotten up to go and wash the dishes from the dinner, and he had gotten distracted watching Tony sleep.
“Rocky? Really? I thought you’d already watched it,” Tony commented as nonchalantly as he could manage, making a mental note to include the movie theme song in Steve’s playlist before the next time he went running.
think he wouldn’t have fallen if daddy had been there to lift him out of the crib as daddies were supposed to do, because Tony didn’t want Steve there, absolutely not – and JARVIS had to reassure him several times that he himself had been the one who had gotten there, that nobody had taken him, and that no one had entered the room while he’d been sleeping there.
With the intention of giving him some space to cool off, Steve had waited a few hours before going to look for him. He shouldn't have waited that long. When he went to the workshop and didn't find him there, he started to get suspicious. Then, when he had looked in all the places where Tony usually hid when he was sulking and didn't see him there either, he started to get anxious. And when JARVIS told him where to find him without having to ask, he started to worry for real.
How could Steve demand Clint to lend the sippy cup to Tony if Tony hadn’t wanted to lend his Lego bricks when they were in the playroom before? It wouldn’t have been fair and the three of them knew it.
Without a doubt, giving the circumstances, letting Phil look after him would have been the wisest thing to do, the adult thing to do. It was no secret to Phil that Steve and Tony were age playing – Steve had even gotten the idea from him and Clint – nor what role Tony played; therefore, Tony knew he had had no valid reason for acting the way he had. He had certainly not handled the situation like a grown-up should have.
“Because I like to do it? Because I love you? Because I want to make you feel loved and cared? Do I really need a reason to pamper you?” Steve asked, sounding serious. Age play aside, Steve liked to take care of Tony, and he had always felt bad when Tony rejected any kind of attention. Steve had gotten to know him well enough to be sure the reason Tony did that was his lack of acknowledgment of truly deserving that treatment.
No matter what Steve said, he didn’t manage to coax Tony into leaving his fetal position on the floor, and when he finally did, he regretted it almost immediately. As soon as his baby got a glimpse of him, his face crumpled in dismay and guilt, and the crying, which had finally begun to subside seconds earlier, was back in full force, body heaving up and down in convulsive sobs.
On the face of it, Steve didn’t seem upset at all; but his eyes said otherwise. Tony gulped loudly when he was put down on his feet. He might as well could have apologized or something, but even if he opened his mouth, no words came out from it. Taking a napkin, Steve tried to clean his face as much as he could with it and stood up, shaking of all the noodles that were laying on his lap.
It sounded like a good plan. That way Tony wouldn’t have to beat his brain out trying to figure out what he was supposed to do or how he was supposed to behave. Tony had read a lot about Age Play, but Steve had more experience in this area, surely the time he had spent with Little Clint must have taught him a thing or two.
If Tony had thought peeing in his diaper was the most difficult part of all this, he had been more than mistaken. Going through a diaper change was more difficult and more embarrassing, especially when Steve didn’t cease to praise him.
“So? Do you like it?” Steve questioned after Tony opened his mouth for a third time and failed to produce words once more. He tried not to sound too anxious, but he was afraid he couldn’t hide it well.
Tony shook his head stubbornly. “Yes, it was. That blow was meant for me, and you had to step in because I was too distracted to dodge it,” he explained, still whispering, words muffled by his knees.
“Stop this now Tony. You’re going to stay still and finish your food which by now should be cold, thank you very much.”
Knowing Tony, Steve could bet that he hadn’t really wanted to give it up, that it had rather been an impulse he’d gotten due to an idea that occurred to him; a reason that, based on previous experience, would make no sense to anybody but Tony. Chances were he’d been struggling, having conflicting thoughts about all this, deciding whether to do what he thought was the correct thing to do or what he wanted to do, and the events from yesterday had been just the last straw.
Once Tony decided to get out from under the bed, everything had gone so smoothly that Phil even dared to think things would be all right from then on. It was true that Tony had refused empathetically to take a quick shower, but considering de fact that he didn’t like water, Phil was afraid he shouldn’t even have proposed such a thing. However, Tony hadn’t resisted when Phil undressed him from his waist down in order to wipe off with a wet cloth all the dried urine from his skin. He had continued sobbing as he called for Steve every now and then, and an intense blush never faded from his face, but besides that, Tony had been quite docile. He hadn’t even complained when Phil informed him he was going to go downstairs with him and Clint.
Practically dragging his feet, as if they hadn’t gotten the memo that his mind was already made up, Tony made his way to the living room where, according to JARVIS, Steve was supposed to be. And the A.I. hadn’t been wrong.
I couldn't sleep yesterday, and I felt like writing, so, here's the result. Kind of a short chapter, though.
“Daddy,” a tiny voice said from the other side of the door. If Phil still doubted it, that confirmed that he was dealing with little Tony.
Without having to tell JARVIS where he was heading, Tony rode the elevator to his floor, and made a beeline for the bedroom. He collapsed onto the bed as soon as he was in front of it, his muscles throbbing in protest. Kicking off his shoes, Tony gathered enough strength to crawl to the center of the bed; lying down with his legs over the edge of the bed was not a good idea anymore, that would surely cause him more pain after a while.
It had been one of those rare nights when Tony had left the workshop by his own decision and had gotten into bed at a pretty reasonable hour. That didn’t mean his head was off of whatever he was working on at the time, so he usually had his tablet or cell phone with him, and typed until late at night. Once he finished, there were two options: Tony would either get to sleep to try to make up for all his previous sleepless nights, or do exactly what he was doing now, demand attention.
"Well. Then we're not leaving this room until one of these two things happen: you rather let me diaper you or you tell me why you changed your mind." Oh yeah, if Tony thought he was the only stubborn one here, he was so wrong.
“Wait a bit more sweetheart, these things are stuck,” Steve said just before a sob escaped from Clint’s throat.
“That won’t be necessary, captain, Sir is having a panic attack, he just needs to breathe,” JARVIS informed.
Tony had been aware of his Little side from a very early age. Back then he didn’t even realize what it was, he just thought that the uneasy feeling he had in his stomach whenever he saw a kid being taken care of and loved by his or her parents was jealousy. His parents never gave him that kind of love and care, and he craved it. He needed it.
“Yes, you do! You used to wear it when we just started dating, it was annoying. I mean, we were already dating, you could hug me whenever you wanted," Tony informed, swinging his legs over the mattress, crossing them.
Steve had to do something about it. He needed to find a way to make the idea that this was okay sink in Tony’s mind. Something not very easy to do, it would be easier to make Clint start writing his own reports on time than convincing Tony to take something as acceptable when his mind already thought it wasn’t. Otherwise, Steve wouldn’t be able to get rid of the feeling that Tony was still doing this just because it was something Steve wanted. And Steve surely didn’t.
“I’m sorry buddy, but this is something you have to do because your daddy’s asking you to do it,” Phil stated, hoping that was enough to make Clint come to his senses. He wasn’t that surprised when Clint stuck his head out of the vent, sticking out his tongue at him.
Somehow Steve managed to settle Tony on his lap, while continuing to soothe him. He put an arm around his waist, a hand tenderly rubbing his stomach –he had noticed that this particular gesture comforted him. When Tony finally calmed down, Steve waited a little while longer before asking him what happened. He wished he had waited more, though, because his little one whimpered as soon as he did, huge and hot tears falling freely from his eyes.
“Wait, don’t you think it’s time for you to take a break?” Steve suggested, sounding serious. The large bags under Tony’s eyes were too dark and protuberant to ignore. Convincing Tony to follow a regular work schedule was something that Steve didn’t even bother to do anymore, since it fell on deaf ears, but what he would never stop doing would be talk Tony into calling it a day when it was obvious he had overworked.
It had been one of the best days in Steve’s life. Taking care of Clint, playing with him, making him laugh, the whole experience had been so… relaxing? Yes, Steve couldn’t think of a better word to describe it. He had always had this need for looking after others, it gave him a certain sensation of fulfillment. Saving the world, helping citizens by defeating any threat, those things did help Steve to satisfied that need, but the experience was always more rewarding if he got to help the people who was the closest to him.
“JARVIS, what the fuck?! Open the fucking door now!” Tony totally ignored the question he’d been asked. “Damn you JARVIS, I think you broke my nose!” He accused the AI, a hand covering his nose.
And then, Phil explained him everything. How sometimes Clint had a really hard time dealing with, well, life. A superhero life. How they had tried an endless number of things to help him cope with stress, and how nothing had worked. How they had come across with a website which talked about age play and how they had decided to give it a try. How odd it had been at the beginning, and how everything had fit in eventually. How it had helped Clint, and how both of them came to really enjoy it.
Had Tony not been so distracted, Steve wouldn’t have had to shove him out of the way and receive the attack that had been meant for him, a strike a fully-focused Tony could have dodged easily.
“You can’t possibly be sleepy now, I think someone’s just pretending to be sleepy because he wants more cuddles from daddy,” Steve accused with an amused tone of voice as he tickled Tony’s ribs slightly. Tony squirmed a little and then Steve heard one of the most heartwarming sound he had ever heard: Tony's giggle. Not a laugh, but an actual giggle.
Regardless how futile he knew it was, Tony kept kicking, hitting, yelling and swearing all the way to Steve’s floor, he wasn’t the kind who gave up that easily. He even attempted to hold onto anything that could prevent the captain from keep walking, but his strength was no match for his. The elevator’s doors wouldn’t close because his feet stood in the way of the sensor, and when Steve realized it, he got so distracted trying to move them out of the way, that he didn’t notice Tony pushed all the buttons, causing the ride to take more time than necessary.
“It’s not that,” Tony said, looking down at the tiles like if they were the most interesting thing in the world, perhaps to try to hide the fact that he was blushing a little, irrefutable proof that he had liked Steve’s gestures more than he would let himself admit. “It’s just that–” he trailed off, failing to put his thoughts in order.
A shame his brain wasn’t good at letting things go just like that. So, Tony wasn’t really the one to be blamed for what he found himself doing days later, his fixation was. And he couldn’t really control it.
, just much much lamer. My creations don’t turn against humanity, just against me. And they don’t even have the intention of killing me, just making me miserable,” Tony complained, sounding more melodramatic than necessary, according to Steve.
“Always, always, always,” Steve repeated as he nuzzled Tony’s neck playfully, causing his baby to let out a soft and surprised giggle.
Steve could feel his heart breaking in two, he hated seeing Clint cry. “Oh, sweetheart, come here, don’t cry, your daddy’s gonna be home soon,” Steve soothed as he grabbed Clint’s hands and pull him closer, guiding him to his lap. He had already gotten JARVIS to contact Phil, and he had said he would be back as soon as some rookies finished their mission.
“That’s what I thought,” Steve said, turning around to fetch some glasses from the counter. Tony bit his tongue to keep himself from talking back, he didn’t need a pissed off Steve on the top of it all.
So, the fact that Tony was so openly eager to know every little thing Steve did all of a sudden did take Steve aback, especially because of the look in Tony’s eyes. Whenever Tony questioned him about his activities, there was certain embarrassment, insecurity, nervousness as well as longing. But, why?
It went without saying that that had been one of the things that had upset Tony and had made him realize there was something off in Steve’s behavior. Who would have thought it would also be one of the things he would later want Steve to keep doing.
“Stop doing that, they’re gonna think this is a prank call!” Steve whisper yelled at Clint, a hand over the transmitter of the phone handset to avoid the guy on the other side of the line to listen to Clint’s unusual requests.
Regardless of whether Steve’s gut was right or not, when it told him Tony had made that decision not because he was sure he wasn’t going to like it at all, but because of the way Steve had handled things.
," Tony said as he pointed at the fork Steve held in front of Tony’s face. "I can feed myself, you know."
“Just one more thing,” Phil interrupted before Steve could hang up, “I don’t want to sound like an ass for asking you this, but… please give him some space if he doesn’t want to be around you. You don’t really have to babysit him, just keep him out of trouble.”
Phil said nothing to that, but the grimace expressed his disbelief. “What happened?” he asked, walking to the bed where Clint had fallen asleep and leaning over to pressed a kiss to his forehead. Steve didn’t have to be a genius to know what he was talking about.
“Tony, I don’t want to state the obvious in here, but correct me if I’m wrong. You’ve been here since I left, and that was a week ago. And knowing you, I’m sure you haven’t gotten any decent meal or sleep all this time, so please, let’s go upstairs and rest.” Tony found himself facing a not-so-happy Steve, yet obviously trying not to show it in his expression. When had he moved in front of the desk?
Sometimes, when someone from the team made a comment of how better their weapons would be if they were capable of doing certain things, Tony’s brain worked at the speed of light to visualize how he could make those improvements possible, and he developed them. That was alright, he didn’t mind carrying out those ideas, he enjoyed improving things, and helping others during battle by providing them with more powerful and useful weapons was always kind of fulfilling.
“You can also decide not to wear any of them, sweetheart,” Steve proposed, and he couldn’t help feeling a bit disappointed when he spotted a sigh of relief in Tony’s eyes. “So?” he exhorted, getting a muffled whined as an answer. “Baby, Daddy needs to know,” he stated, voice soft but stern. Tony whined one more time before pointing at the colorful diaper, his cute pink blush turning into beet red. “Are you completely sure?” Tony nodded, and all of a sudden, he threw himself at Steve, something for which he was thankful, since he was sure he’d fail to hide a smile this time.
Good grief! Steve had blown raspberries several times over the last months, so he might do that to try to cheer him up. Tony’s body tensed up one more time.
“I don’t know.” His voice never sounded as thin as it always did when he was talking to his father, and he hated that.
By the time Steve reached the rocking chair, Clint had empty most of the contents of the chests and was now sitting in the middle of a pool of toys, deciding which of them he should play with first. Steve sighed while he sat down on the rocking chair with Tony on his lap, already thinking about the cleanup. It would undoubtedly be hard to get Clint to help him put everything away once he had finished playing; if Tony didn’t like tidying up, Clint disliked it even more.
But that didn’t mean Tony thought Steve would cheat on him. Tony wasn’t going to deny the whole Age Play thing was a bit unusual, and if someone else had seen the scene he saw on the screen, that person would have certainly thought there was something else going on. And Tony’s thought process might have led him to the same conclusion over time thanks to that habit of his of turning everything over in his mind countless times. However, besides the fact that Tony couldn’t imagine Steve and Clint having that kind of relationship, the other footage he saw made sure his mind discarded that idea.
“Tony, enough with the swearing. Why don’t you go and refresh a little while I cook dinner?... or is it breakfast?” Playing oblivious to his frustration and anger was just making Tony angrier.
But worse of all, if Steve had known about it already, he may have noticed all the slips Tony had had when he had forced himself to stay in his adult mindset for a long time. Steve may have seen Tony putting down his hand when he was about to suck his thumb unconsciously. When he got all jumpy due to the annoying vulnerability and insecurity that took control of him. Steve may have realized how the leaned more than necessary to any kind of touch. And what about the time Tony had fallen asleep due to exhaustion on a stool in his workshop and he had woken up with wet pants, Steve had gone down to see if he was interested in hanging out with the team for bonding. Tony had been pretty sure Steve hadn't really noticed the wet spot on his pants – they were black after all, and by the time Steve had shown up in his workshop, they had almost dried off – but now he wasn't that sure.
The rest of the afternoon was an ordeal. Phil never imagined how stressing looking after two littles could be, and the fact that Tony was sick and Clint was overtired just made everything worse.
Afraid Tony wouldn’t let go of him, Steve sat down on the edge of the bathtub. Maybe if he was sitting down, he could manage to shift Tony to one of his knees and settle Clint on the other. Tony’s face did screw up like he might start crying when was rearranged, but thankfully, he said nothing and just hid his face in the crook of Steve’s neck.
For that reason, Steve hadn’t wanted to go down to look for Clint’s pull-ups, Tony would have never agreed to stay put while he rode the elevator to Phil’s floor, and taking Tony out of their floor while he was in his little headspace wasn’t an option either. If Tony got all jumpy and uneasy when they were in their living room, Steve didn’t want to imagine what going anywhere else in the tower would do to Tony’s nerves.
A bit hesitatingly, Tony waddled further into the nursery and headed for reading corner. For a moment Steve thought the bookshelf would be Tony’s first selection – something easy and not that incriminatory to begin with – but his baby went past it and extended his left arm to reach for the back of the rocking chair. Wary brown eyes glanced at him, as if looking for approval, and it was clear some of the tension left his shoulders once they ran into Steve’s smile.
If it had been possible, Steve would have hugged JARVIS. Calling Phil had turned out to be a good idea.
So, I can truly see Clint and Tony acting like that. With that I'm not trying to say they're gonna be brats or they're gonna be very mean to each other, but they might not be like best friends like we've seen in other stories. They might in the future, but I don't know yet. Who knows n_n'
"I got distracted checking some things, but I do have to go downstairs to finish some things," Tony informed, his eyes fixed on the tablet in front of him. He looked very concentrated, up to the point of not kissing him back as he usually did. Weird.
Steve couldn’t help noticing there was something really off about the way Tony was behaving lately. Little things that might not be considered weird themselves, however, coming from Tony, they gave the impression there was something fishy going on.
Frustrated, Tony sat up on the bed as carefully as possible to not disturb Steve's sleep. Or maybe he should. Steve could help him, just as he was helping him to get used to calling him daddy. It hadn't been completely intentional, the word had slipped out before he could stop it and the jealousy he had been feeling right then had unquestionably been the one to blame. That hadn't made Steve less happy, though. After the shock was overcome, Steve pulled him into a hug and kissed him non-stop all over the face, glazed eyes showing Tony his contentment.
“Or maybe I should turn you into a toaster,” Tony wondered out loud, ignoring his A.I. comments on purpose.
As much as he tried to get all the air he needed, he couldn’t. A panic attack, he thought he was having a panic attack. Again. His hands started to shake a little, his body felt cold and his chest tightened too.
“I don’t know, I’ve been wanting to read this book but some time now, JARVIS showed me this website were people comment about books, and this one has very good reviews,” Steve commented, sounding serious. “I got interested in it just by reading the synopsis.”
"Well, I don't fucking care if you agree or don't. Just stop this bullshit!” How could Steve get into his nerves like this? How could Steve be like this situation was the most normal thing in the world? Tony just didn’t get it.
The first thing Steve would have to do was get Clint to stop playing video games, he might have disliked the fact that he had to play by himself, but taking into account how he was yelling at the TV now, he had long forgotten that and he was really enjoying himself. Taking away a toy which Clint was playing with was never a good idea. Steve could blackmail him, there were some chocolate cookies in the cabinets Clint loved, and he would do whatever Steve asked if he got one of them. But, if Steve’s purpose was to put Clint to bed, giving him sugar wasn’t the right way to proceed.
“Tony, this is the third glass you drink, you can’t possibly be still thirsty,” Steve uttered when Tony demanded a fourth refill.
“I know you know what I’m doing. I told you what I wanted to do,” Steve confirmed, confused. Tony’s jaw dropped almost comically.
Phil preferred to ignore that accusation, and kept eating his lunch while he waited for Clint to stop whining. If he continued insisting him on stopping that nonsense and go back to the table, it would be worse. After fifteen minutes of hearing Clint calling him a liar, a meany, and many other things – something that Phil never took as an offense, since he was perfectly aware of the fact that Clint’s crankiness was the one that was talking, not him – he seemed to calm down. Phil beckoned to him and smiled when Clint didn’t hesitate to stand up and walk towards him.
JARVIS had been making that suggestion every twenty minutes for the last three hours and it was getting on his nerves. Not only that meant he had been making mistakes regularly, but also that his capability of concentration was decreasing considerably, something Tony couldn’t afford to do right now. He needed to sign all those papers as soon as possible if he didn’t want to be dragged to his office – it had happened before, so Tony knew it wasn’t an empty threat – by a furious Pepper and locked up there until he had caught up with all the backlog, which usually turned out to date back a year or so.
"Don't you wanna play a little bit before we leave?" Steve proposed, still encouraging him to take the rubber duck. Tony grabbed it, but did nothing but stared at it. "Maybe the toys I chose are not appropriate for your age, huh? Perhaps I should’ve bought some for bigger kids?" he wondered with a slightly disappointed tone of voice while he put his elbows on the edge of the tub and looked at Tony.
“Promise,” Phil assured, turning Clint around so he could sit down on his leg. He reached for Clint’s bowl and held it in front of them so Clint could grab the fork, as being fed was something he considered too childish. Hesitantly, Clint ate some of the pasta, and judging by his expression, Phil knew he didn’t dislike the taste of it. “We can watch some TV after you finish,” he suggested, deciding not to make a big deal of what just had happened.
“I don’t need a nap. You can’t even take naps at night! If you haven’t noticed, it’s night already,” Tony pointed out.
“I know you’re a big boy buddy, it’s just in case you have an accident,” Steve coaxed, extending a hand to Clint. He had already spread the changing mat out on the floor and had retrieved all the supplies he needed to diaper Clint, the only thing that was missing was Clint himself.
Or, had that particular characteristic of Tony had something to do with his sudden decision? Perhaps it had. Maybe all the attention and love Steve tried to give Tony every time they age played had sparked off that habit of his of rejecting everything that was good for him. Instead of soaking all that affection like a sponge – as he definitely should – Tony might be running away from it. That certainly sounded like something he would do.
,” Tony stated, folding his arms, not caring in the slightest to be sitting on Steve’s legs. “I’m older than you, you know.”
Clint. Since that night Phil asked him to look after him, Clint had been more open about the whole situation. If by any chance he needed to spend some quality time in – what Steve had come to known as – his little headspace and Steve happened to be around, he would just slip into it.
“Oh, I will, in a couple of days,” Steve replied. Tony and he had this thing of giving each other some days to cool off every time they had a fight, both of them having agreed it wasn’t such a good idea to try to fix things when anger was talking for them. “But to tell you the true, I don’t really know what I’m going to say,” Steve confessed, rubbing the back of his neck with his right hand.
Once they were in the kitchen, Steve hurried to the refrigerator and took out as many ice cubes as he thought necessary and wrapped them with several napkins. He returned to were Tony was standing and sat down on the nearest chair, drawing Tony and pulling him down so he ended up sitting on his lap. Tony was so tired, sick, hungry and in pain that he didn’t even think about getting away. So he just sat down there, still holding his hurt hand with the other one, feeling a little ashamed about it. He had had far worse injuries during battle, so this should be nothing to him. But not having adrenaline running through his veins due to the rush of the battle just made the pain unbearable.
“No one wanted to give green-light to your departure.” Phil informed. Steve had already figured that had been the problem. Nobody in their right mind would allow someone who had suffered several concussions, had a dislocated elbow, two broken ribs as well as various cuts and scrapes all over his body leave only a few hours after being admitted. Steve reckoned Phil had had to scared the hell out of some people in order to be able to get him discharged, and Phil would probably have to deal with a furious Fury once he realized Steve had left before he was supposed to.
“Clint, seriously, I need to go upstairs and you can’t stay here by yourself,” Phil informed. There was no way he was going to leave Clint unsupervised, who knows in what state he would find their floor once he came back. Phil was not in the mood of spending his free afternoon cleaning crayon marks from the walls, or drying the remainders of Clint’s attempts to have a pool in the living room.
Sorry for taking a lot of time to update. Life's been too stressful lately (My students had been just awful, but the parents are the ones that get on my nerves most of the time) and I just haven't been in a mood of writing.
“I dun wanna,” Tony mumbled. Steve refrained himself from saying anything, though he raised an eyebrow questioningly. Surely his baby didn’t expect Steve to remind him once more that the answers weren’t optional, he had to have realized that by now. And he apparently did. After wiggling restlessly, whining quietly but distressfully, and pouting deeply, he turned to face Steve with a look of resignation in his eyes that informed of his inability to talk his way around this time.
"No, it's not, it's the same size as yours," Steve assured, stabbing another piece of chicken and some lettuce with the airplane-shaped fork.
He was almost out the door when he spotted something that caught his attention, something plushy, something that looked very familiar. He walked over to it and picked it up, immediately feeling the blood drain from his face when he recognized what it was. His teddy bear. The only one he had. The one that Steve had given to him.
“You fucking traitor! When did you start being on the side of the fucking national icon?! Open the fucking door right now or I swear I will turn you into a fucking alarm clock which can only be stopped if you destroy it!” OK, he was never going to do such a thing, and he knew JARVIS already knew that, but it was kind of frustrating that the AI always pair up with Steve in this situations.
Tony clung to Steve’s t-shirt as if his life depended on it, and if Steve tried to get away, Tony would wake up and get restless all over again. As a result, Steve had to stay with him throughout the night, which shouldn’t have posed any particular problem, except that Steve had considered a good idea to climb into the crib with Tony, afraid his baby would flee or just wander around without Steve knowing if they slept in their bed. Had Steve known he would end up sharing the crib with Tony, he would’ve bought a bigger one. The lack of space to move freely hadn’t helped his current condition.
Well, let's just say that Phil will never doubt Steve when he says looking after little Clint and Tony at the same time is more than tiring.
“Oh,” Steve expressed, already walking beside Tony, “you know, you could use your diaper baby, daddy wouldn’t mind changing you,” Steve suggested, and he wasn’t surprised when Tony shook his head slightly. Without saying anything further, Steve leaned over to put the sheets down and proceeded to remove the diaper.
After several minutes, Tony could recover from his shock and gather the enough strength and will to stand up and ran as fast as he could to his room, slamming the door and locking it. Now that he thought about it, that had been a very childish reaction. Damn. Steve knocked at the door and apologized for going in without a warning, and asked Tony to please go outside so they could talk about what happened, but it was obvious that Tony wouldn’t do that. He was too busy trying to get through the worst panic attacked he had ever experience in his life. There was no way he could face Steve after what had happened.
Now that Steve had finally succeeded in keeping Tony still and getting rid of his trousers, the only thing left to do was diapering him up. That’s was a problem, Steve had no idea how to do it considering that he had never tried it before – it wasn’t like he had a lot of opportunities to be around children with the war and everything that was going on before – and he wasn’t sure he could do it. Even worse, the diaper had ended up a couple of meters away from the bed when Tony had accidentally – or intentionally, Steve wasn’t sure – kicked it in the middle of the struggle. Sighing exasperatedly, Steve tried to reach it while continuing to keep his partner in place, but it was impossible, the serum had made him unnaturally strong, but it hadn’t given him any kind of elasticity.
to give it a try. That was pretty much decided. It was a possibility Tony ended up not liking it, but it was also probable that if he didn’t let himself experience what the whole Age Play thing was like, he would never get that peace of mind he desperately looked for and needed.
With clumsy movements, Tony got up from the couch, bridged the distance between them and sat down on Steve’s – Daddy’s – lap, throwing his hands around Steve’s neck and hiding against his shoulder almost right away.
“C’mon, honey, Daddy’s getting hungry and I’m pretty sure you’re too,” Steve cheered, something that earned him a huge pout.
“NO,” Steve denied, maybe a bit too loudly, because Tony shuddered a little. “No, Tony, it wasn’t your fault,” he continued, calmer.
Steve carried him only because Clint had fallen off the vents and had hurt his ankle slightly–Adult Clint’s threshold of pain was high, but Little Clint’s wasn’t. Steve fed him only because Clint had come up with the idea that food wars were the best thing ever and he had begun throwing any food he could get his hands on. Steve diapered him only because he hadn’t realized he had actually run out of pull-ups and going downstairs to retrieve more would have upset an already sleepy Clint.
Okay, Tony had to admit it, he had played dirty, so he shouldn’t be complaining. But it hadn’t been fair, Steve was freakishly strong and he could flatten the boxes with his bare hands unlike Tony, who had to step on most of them to obtain the same result. Steve’s pile of boxes had been obviously bigger than his, and Tony just couldn’t sit back and do nothing. While he was retrieving another box, the said RC car had materialized under it and the temptation had been too big not to succumb to it. Tony had taken the remote and had sent the car right into Steve’s pile.
Peevishly, Tony walked up to the couch and flopped down onto it, curling into a little ball. Being rude to JARVIS always left a nasty taste in his mouth, and that was the last thing he needed right now. However, if he apologized, JARVIS might feel the right to advise him and Tony was not in the mood for that. He just didn't want to hear anybody, not when his mind was a total mess.
After a lot of coaxing, and the promise of making him a strawberry smoothie and letting him have some cookies, Clint agree to lay down on the changing mat and let Steve diaper him, though a huge moue appeared on his face when he realized the diaper was way thicker that the pull-ups – or diapers – he usually wore. Steve didn’t buy regular adult diapers for Tony, he liked to buy diapers made especially for people you enjoy age playing, and, apparently, those people preferred thick and crinkly diapers. Up until now, Tony hadn’t seemed to mind. Clint, on the other hand, disliked the fact that that diaper prevented his pants to fit anymore.
Of course, at the beginning, Clint had been very shy, insecure and twitchy. He wouldn’t really interact with Steve unless it was strictly necessary – like Steve being near something Clint wanted to grab or still having some food on his plate when Clint’s had been already empty and he was still hungry – staying beside his daddy – Phil – almost all the time, and even hiding behind him sometimes.
“Well, you should’ve thought about that before making a mess. What on earth were you thinking about? You know you’re not allowed to use any appliances,” Phil scolded, leaning forward in order to scrub Clint’s legs.
“What?” Steve sounded stunned, “Why? You already know why I’m going to look for him,” he admitted, like if that statement explained the pressing necessity about why he had to leave.
"Hey, you're done early," Steve pointed out while he stepped out of the elevator and walked towards the living room where Tony was sitting on a couch, leaning over to press a quick kiss on his lips.
With a speed that made Tony believed Steve had somehow learned to teleport, he materialized in front of Tony and picked him up, cradling his head gently as he began to rock him. Tony threw his arms and legs around Steve’s neck and waist, hugging him in a way it would be painful for anyone else who didn’t have a super-soldier serum running through his veins.
Tony hesitated for a millisecond, but he ended up leaning on Steve’s chest and letting the latter feed him until his plate was completely empty.
“This morning, he wanted to block the door and deny you the access to the workshop, I had to promise him you wouldn’t get lost there, Sir.”
“What is it, sweetheart? Didn’t you want juice?” Steve asked, confused. Tony shook his head and pushed the bottle away.
Eventually, Phil reached a point where he just couldn’t believe how everything was going downhill gradually without being able to do something about it. Clint refused to take a nap if Phil didn’t finish reading at least three more chapters of the book, something Phil couldn’t afford to do because he was busy placing wet cloths on Tony’s forehead as an attempt to reduce his fever. Tony was clearly uncomfortable, and the fact that Clint began playing with some of the toys from the chests in very noisy way didn’t let Tony rest peacefully.
Was Tony going to get sick? Had he done something he knew it was going to make Steve mad and that was why he was trying to be nice to him, to tone things down? Was he experiencing a mental block, exhaustion finally catching up with him, and he was just trying to distract himself? There were endless reasons why Tony could be acting like that, he never ceased to surprised Steve. Until one day, an idea crossed Steve’s mind when Tony seemed so eager to get him to play with some drones – something Tony had never done, he even disliked when Steve played catch with Dummy – Was all that was happening related to Age Play? Was it possible that Tony had gotten interested in it and wanted to give it a try?
After a lot of persuasion, Steve had managed to remove the pillow from his face. Tony hadn’t last too much without covering his face though. As soon as Steve had pulled him into a sitting position and manipulated him into a t-shirt, Tony had curled into a little ball and hid his face behind his arms, realization hitting him hard. There had not been any pants or shorts in sight, which could only mean that Steve planned to leave him just in a t-shirt and diaper. A diaper that had proved to be crinkly and thick enough to not go unnoticed, but far from being as uncomfortable as Tony had thought.
Eventually, Steve planned on turning the room into a nursery, the website where he had bought the changing table from also sold cribs and highchairs, but he thought it was still too soon for that. Tony hadn’t been that thrilled when he saw how Steve had redecorated the room, so Steve figured it was better to wait a little more.
There was a long pause, where Steve opened his mouth with the intention of saying something, but sighing heavily and rolling his eyes, he decided just to let this go and walk to the kitchen. He really didn’t want to lose his temper right now, and he was actually really hungry.
“Captain Rogers is not in the tower, sir. He’s on a mission,” JARVIS informed. Tony definitely didn’t like what he’d just heard.
Why the hell had he come up here in the first place? What had he been thinking about? What was he supposed to say now? “Hey cap, would you like to be my daddy?” That was so lame. So inappropriate. So sick. Damn nightmares and their ability to unsettled him, Tony would have still been safe in his workshop if it hadn’t been them.
Steve chuckled slightly as he got up from the table. “Let’s train or something,” he suggested, not wanting to discuss the matter any longer so Clint didn’t feel uncomfortable or offended in no way.
I wasn't in the mood of working today, so I wrote instead (I didn't have a lot to do anyway, so no regrets).
That was indeed something not easy to do, and also the reason why they hadn’t had a play date in over a month. So much for having his daddy back.
“You might not, but I assure you, I do,” Tony bragged and Steve had to bit his tongue to keep himself from reminding him about the time they had ran into a killer toaster in the kitchen. Tony’s inventions didn’t always turn out well, especially when they were the result of hours of sleep and food deprivation. “Are we there yet?”
For a second, Steve supposed Tony’s gesture had been a display of irritation to show how against he was to his demands; however, when Tony began shifting weight side to side as his face turned crimson for the umpteenth time that day, Steve understood what he’d meant.
Without further delay, Steve stood up, took off Tony’s top tank, rested his hands on Tony’s shoulders, and gently encouraged him to lower his back against the mattress. Then, once the baby was lay down, he proceeded to unfasten his jeans and pulled them down and off along with his boxers. It would certainly not hurt Tony to get a bath, though, giving the circumstances, a quick rubdown with baby wipes would have to do. Steve needed to get him dressed so that they continued with what he’d planned.
Of all the people who had moved into the Tower, it had been Steve the one who had struggled the most to get used to it. As hard as it may be to believe, it had been the luxury the thing that had refrained him from feeling comfortable living there, as it contrasted immensely with the places he had lived in. Tony even remembered seeing him sleeping on the floor a couple of times, and when he had asked him why was that, Steve had told him the mattress on his bed was too comfortable to be comfortable. Huh?
Damn X-Men and their stupid idea of requesting The Avengers' help. Damn Magneto and his ability to control metal. If it hadn’t been because of him, Tony’s suit wouldn’t have been damaged, he wouldn’t have needed a ride home, and therefore, he wouldn’t have had to sit down in front of Steve where he could perfectly notice the havocs of being struggling against his Little headspace for more than a month now.
“Playing?” Tony echoed. Did Steve considered what they had done as playing? How come? They only reason they had grabbed the toys had been to take them upstairs and put them away, they hadn’t played with them at all.
Ignoring Clint’s weak groans, Steve slid his hands under his armpits and scooped him up. Clint squirmed slightly at first, not happy with having been taken out of his hideout, but soon Steve’s rocking and patting calmed him down.
Tony didn’t want to be little right now. He couldn’t. But the more he tried to get rid of those mental pictures of Steve hugging and cuddling him, the harder it was to keep his little self at bay.
“You don’t have to do anything,” Steve assured, rubbing his thumb against the back of his left hand. Every time they talked about something serious, Steve insisted on keeping some sort of physical contact, arguing it was important. Tony didn’t completely agree with that, but he couldn’t deny either that Steve’s touch was always comforting.
Thirty minutes after the movie started, Tony’s mind was still blank. What if he just let Steve have his way? After all, it was kind of Tony’s way too. What if he just accepted this was something he needed? Something that he wanted? What if he just let himself enjoy it and save himself all the drama he usually caused? Tony could actually do that. He wanted to do that. But what if Steve took that as a green light? What if Steve thought he could push Tony into his Little headspace whenever he felt it was necessary? Tony certainly didn’t want that to happen.
"Would you like another one, sport?" Steve asked, pointing at the pile of shaped pancakes in front of them. Clint nodded, and Steve served one more on his plate, refraining himself from commenting on how unhealthy it was to add as much whipped cream as Clint was doing. Seriously, the pancake couldn’t even be seen anymore.
But Tony wanting to stop this role-play because he thought Steve would leave and thus, he would be left without a daddy, well, Steve’s mind didn’t even know what to make of that. What on earth had he done to make Tony believe he would leave him?
Steve had been there indeed, and stayed there for most of the morning. He cooked breakfast – bananas, strawberries and waffles that were arranged in a way the plate seemed to have two ice-cream cones on it, plus a huge milkshake – and made sure Clint ate it, having to chase after him all over the living room before Steve finally managed to settle him on his lap and feed him. Apparently, Clint’s mischievous behavior increased considerably when being in what Tony had read was called Little headspace.
“I don’t care, I’m leaving so you can continue with your book,” Tony snapped, struggling to get rid of Steve’s grip, but the only thing he managed was making Steve pulled him more until he ended up sitting on his lap, trapped in his embrace. “I’m starting to think you have a thing for having me on your lap,” Tony insinuated, not attempting to get away anymore, but continuing glaring at him.
“Is he okay, JARVIS?” Steve asked, not waiting for the elevator doors to be completely open to step out.
Why hadn’t he gone back to the bedroom and gotten changed? Tony was certain that Steve wouldn’t have stopped him. Then, what the hell was he doing there? Why the hell did he insist on clinging to Steve? It was true that, even if he couldn’t seem to understand why nor how, Tony was feeling little, but he could easily change his mindset if he wanted, unlike Clint, who seemed to be deep in his little headspace and do need someone to look after him. Then, why didn’t Tony do that?
Steve crossed the room in a few long strides, reached the closet, opened it and grabbed a stack of clothes he’d previously selected and put aside especially for this moment, keeping an eye on his baby at all time just in case he decided to flee. At the same pace, he walked back, smiled at Tony once more, and laid out the outfits on the mattress in front of him: a light blue onesie with the stamp of a screwdriver and a wrench as well as the words “DADDY’S ASSISTANT” printed across the front of it; a red polo bodysuit and some plaid overalls shorts with a car embroidered on the chest; and some plain khaki shorts with an orange and white striped t-shirt.
The following morning, when Steve had failed to show up in their room, Tony couldn’t help wondering if he still was with Clint. After an internal struggle whether to invade their privacy or not, Tony succumbed yet another time and had JARVIS show him what was happening in Clint’s living room.
All that made sense, and Tony understood it. However, understanding and accepting were two different things, and Tony couldn’t bear the idea of his Daddy looking after someone who wasn’t him. He didn’t want his Daddy to be anyone else’s daddy, regardless of the fact that Tony wasn’t willing to be his baby anymore. Or was he?
It took Tony several more minutes to be able to control himself. To be honest, Steve’s reassurances didn’t help a lot, Tony did hear them, but he wasn’t really paying attention to them, he was more concentrated on the fact that Steve knew about his Little side, which meant everything would change from now on.
Though five minutes passed. Then ten. Twenty. And Tony didn't seem to be able to relax. The mental picture of daddy's strong arms surrounding him, protecting him from whatever was stopping him from calming down got so sharp, it became impossible to ignore.
“Shut up, no all of us were injected with the serum and are now immune to pain,” Tony pointed out. Finally looking at him.
Though this afternoon, Tony couldn’t help focusing more on the advertisement that was displayed on the websites he was visiting than on the content of the websites themselves.
“Well, it’s up to you. I told you Daddy’s okay with whatever you decide,” Steve promised. Tony glared at him one look of dismay. “What? I mean it,”
“No, I didn’t. JARVIS would have already warned us about it if I had done it. Here, let me see.” Steve took Tony’s hand into his hands and looked carefully at it. The knuckles had already started to swell up, but Steve couldn’t feel any broken bone when he tenderly touched the hand. “Some ice will have to do. Come on, let’s go to the kitchen.”
It's been a while since I last updated. I'm sorry. Beisdes the fact that the last two months of the year is when I'm the busiest, I haven't really felt like writing. I hope I have time to update soon, but I promise nothing n_n'''
“Hey Tony, why are you…” Steve didn’t finish the question, freezing at the sight of the scene in front of him. “My God, what happened in here?” he asked, shocked, looking at the mess. Steve laid his eyes on Tony and approached him right away, afraid that he was hurt or something, given the fact that he was hyperventilating and his lips were starting to look blue-ish. “Tony, buddy, what happened, are you all right?” Steve demanded as he kneeled in front of him.
I thought about making this chapter longer, but when I do that, it takes me too much to update, or I get busier and I don't have to finish it.
“You’re gonna give yourself a tummy ache if you continue drinking like this,” Steve warned as he opened the fridge and reached for the bottle of apple juice. Tony kept shaking his head and pressed the sippy cup against Steve’s chest.
Cursing himself under his breath for not seeing it coming, Phil turned on his heel and chased after Tony right after he asked Clint to wait for him there. Perhaps it was a very bad idea to leave Clint alone when he was evidently in an unstable mood, but Phil was afraid of losing sight of Tony as there were plenty of places in the tower where he could hide, and spending all afternoon playing hide-and-seek with him wasn’t in Phil’s plans.
“Ohh! You want to keep the crib, is that it baby?” Steve asked, and he was truly impressed by how much redder Tony’s face could get. With long fast strides, Steve bridged the distance between them and reached for his baby’s head to ruffle his hair, “Well done, baby boy, Daddy’s very proud of you,” he praised.
That would definitely explain a lot of Tony’s odd behavior, and nothing would make Steve happier than Tony changing his mind about not wanting them to try Age Play. It was nice to hang out with Clint when he was Little, but Steve still believed it would be much better if it was Tony instead of Clint.
? Was this how it felt to be in a little headspace? It couldn't be, Tony wasn't even sure if he was going to be able to slip into such a headspace. Perhaps it was just embarrassment caused by being self-conscious of how odd all this could actually be, his boyfriend was referring to himself as his
However, now that he had experienced that headspace himself, he realized his theory had been mistaken. Tony was well aware of what was happening. He knew he was drinking from bottles, he knew he was wearing clothes that weren’t meant for adults, he knew he was using diapers, the only difference was that Tony didn’t really care about that anymore, he didn’t get mortified as he did when they had just started age playing. Every now and then Tony could feel his adult self trying to take over, still struggling to come to terms with all this, but a cuddle or a praise from Steve was enough to help Tony settle back.
Internet had proven to be a very helpful tool to find cute baby stuff that fitted Tony, and Steve made sure he got as many as possible. Tony’s face had been hilarious on the day he found that the side of the closet Steve had never filled because he refused to buy more clothes than necessary, was now full of things that Tony could wear on their play dates.
"What up?" Tony heard Steve slurring, finally picking up the phone. Tony kept his ears open so he could hear who was on the other end of the line, and the silence that reigned in the room let him make out Phil’s voice. "Yes, yes, no. I’m awake now. It's OK, don't worry, I really don’t mind, I'll check on him," Steve finished saying, his speech getting clearer.
“Not really,” Steve answered, looking at Tony with a confused expression, unwrapping the hamburgers to put them on a plate.
“So, what happened? Are you really here to get some sleep?” Steve asked, still sounding a bit startled.
That weird feeling increased when Tony was made to walk behind Steve, as impossible as Tony knew it was, Steve looked somehow bigger than usual when looked from that perspective, making Tony feel even smaller.
“Jesus Tony, you are really sneaky,” Steve told him at the same time he grabbed Tony by the arms so he wouldn’t fall down. Really, Tony couldn’t be blamed for staggering, running into Steve was like running into a huge rock.
“Consider it a warning. Don’t think I can’t tell what you’re thinking in that little head of yours. So you better go upstairs, take a shower and come down to have dinner without even thinking on doing something you know I would disapprove, otherwise I’ll go and get you,” Steve finished saying, mussing Tony’s hair without losing the seriousness in his voice. Tony just glared at him.
If Steve had gotten the feeling Tony wasn’t going to go along with the Age Play thing, why did he try to involve him in it anyway? Why didn’t he just tell him what he wanted to do? Who knows how many arguments they had had at the beginning of their relationship, most of them due to his lack of communication skills, and now Steve went and did this? As if Tony had never asked Steve to try new things! And Steve might have been a bit reluctant a few times, but they had always come to an agreement.
“I really have to go sweetheart,” Steve affirmed, apologetically. Tony felt his face even warmer because of the endearment Steve had just used. “I promise I’ll come back as soon as I can, and we’ll talk about this, but right now I do have to go with Clint, can you let me go?” he pleaded, and Tony shook his head even if his embrace loosen considerably.
“No, I don’t,” Steve denied, looking away. He had never been able to hold a stare when he was lying. Because what Phil had said had been totally true.
Perhaps that was why Steve refrained himself from verbalizing the pending issues for several more minutes, wanting to extend the moment as much as possible; and it was until Tony raised a hand to slip his thumb into his mouth when he knew he couldn’t wait any longer. If Tony sank into his headspace any further, reasoning with him would be difficult – if not impossible.
Tony looked at Steve. He looked at Steve’s hand. Then, he looked at Steve’s lap, foreseeing where he was going to end up, and looked up at Steve once more. Rolling his eyes at him, Tony held Steve’s hand and let himself be pulled off the chair and led towards him, being turned around so he could sit down on Steve’s lap sideways, an arm surrounding his waist.
"JARVIS didn't tell me anything this time," Steve informed, still holding the fork up. "This is the first time you emerge from the workshop for two days, I just figured you haven't eaten anything substantial while being down there," he explained, moving the fork closer to Tony's mouth, "c'mon, open up," he asked, but Tony moved his head away while he pushed Steve's hand.
“You want what?” Steve prompted, and Tony could tell he had his full attention even if he still refused to look up at him.
“Maybe you won’t, but I think it’s better if you let me put it on,” Phil suggested as he kneeled in front of him. Getting down at Tony’s level was essential if Phil didn’t want to make Tony feel more uncomfortable than he already was.
Okay, this was supposed to be a little bit longer, but it would've taken me more time to update. The conversation is not over, there are some other things they still need to talk about, so, that's gonna be in the next chapter.
Going straight to Steve to tell him about his curiosity seemed to be the best thing to do. Or it had seemed, because Tony had already blown that chance. After the huge commotion he had caused when Steve attempted to get him into age playing behind his back, Tony couldn’t just tell Steve he had changed his mind, could he? No, Tony didn’t think that would be a good idea. Besides, he didn’t even want to imagine how that conversation would go. What was he going to say?
His hands didn’t move fast enough to cover his mouth before saying that sentence, the sentence that fucked everything up.
Assurances that he was fine and that it hadn’t been anybody’s fault fell on deaf ears. Starting to feel overwhelmed by his inability to bring comfort to Tony, Steve leaned forward with awkward movements, his body slightly numbed by the not so comfortable posture as well as the pain of his wounds, and tried to hug Tony. Another bad idea. Steve should’ve remembered Tony’s first instinct was to shy away from an embrace, especially when being that upset, and he should’ve have foreseen Tony would flail and wriggle. But Steve didn’t. Tony slapped Steve’s abdomen unintentionally in his attempt to get free. Right in one of Steve’s broken ribs.
There was a time when those kind of comments would have made Steve reconsider whatever he was denying Clint. But after babysitting him for a few times, Steve realized how improper – and sometimes dangerous – it would be to please little Clint all the time.
At the beginning, Tony had taken as an excuse Steve’s state for delaying age playing, the man had had two broken ribs and a dislocated elbow among other injuries, so it wouldn’t have been fair for Tony to demand being looked after when Steve had so much trouble moving. The day they’d amended things between them, Tony had stayed in his little headspace until after midnight, and recalling how complicated it had been for Steve just to change his diaper deterred Tony from wanting to be Little.
“You broke my fingers, I think you broke my fingers!” Tony accused, seeing how his hand literally throbbed.
Although he spilled the water on himself, Tony refused to change, and Phil got the feeling that was due to the fact that Tony didn’t want to be dressed in a onesie. Fortunately, Steve kept some of his t-shirts there, in the closet of the nursery. Unfortunately, that reminded Tony about Steve, and even if he clearly tried not to, he ended up sobbing once more.
And the diapers. Tony couldn’t figure out why he wanted to wear them. Diapers were for babies, for God’s sake! Well, and for adults too, but for very old adults who couldn’t control their bodily functions, and he wasn’t either of them. He could excuse himself a little bit by saying he just wanted them because they would help him with his occasional bedwetting problem, but deep inside he knew that wasn’t the real reason.
“Then I’ll read one of those, pick one, whichever you want,” Phil suggested, earning a glare from Clint.
"I am," Tony answered, fighting the urge to throw himself into daddy's arms. Instead, he walked towards the bed where Steve was seated on and stood next to it, awkwardly.
“I–,” Tony trailed off, not knowing what to say. Squirming a bit, he looked back and forth between Steve’s and Phil’s scowls and Clint’s hurt expression, and when tears began welling into his eyes, panic spread though Tony’s body.
It hadn’t been necessary for Tony to ask Steve what he had meant by that. It was quite obvious he had referred to the play date they both had agreed to have a few days ago, the one Steve had promised to organized. Nevertheless, Tony wished Steve hadn’t said that, because he had been a bundle of nerves since Steve left, anxiously wondering what would happen once he came back.
Steve smiled at his enthusiasm, even so, he couldn’t help wondering if it was due to real hunger or relief for moving on to something less stressful for him. “But first, I need you to do something else for Daddy”, he continued. His baby’s face dropped. Steve guessed that cleared his doubt. “I know, baby, I know. But I still don’t know all the things you enjoy.”
“Tony, look at me, please,” Steve ordered. “Tony,” he said, his tone of voice indicating it was definitely not a good idea to disobey him right now. Tony squirmed a bit more and his eyes darted around for several seconds before finally meeting Steve’s eyes. “
"That's perfect, because I made a lot of food and we're the only ones here today," Steve informed, stirring what was surely soup in a pot.
Without more delay, Steve stood up and took the cushion away from Tony, sliding his hands under Tony’s armpits and lifting him up. Steve expected his boy to complain about it as he usually did, what he didn’t expect was the frightened expression that appeared on his face as his eyes desperately asked him why he had done such a thing.
"JARVIS, do you know where my tablet is?" Tony asked after having checked, and not found it, on the places Steve usually placed it.
“Ask them to put chocolate inside the crust!” Clint said a bit too enthusiastically as he jumped up and down on the other side of the countertop.
Needless to say, Tony didn't either remain still or close his eyes. He struggled, cursed, punched, hit, kicked and even tried to bite Steve, but this one didn’t even flinch. On the contrary, every time Tony managed to release himself a little, Steve pulled him closer again, never loosening his grip or stopping rocking back and forth. Steve even started to cooing him by humming a lullaby. That just frustrated Tony more, writhing and stamping more, but nothing freed him from Steve’s hold.
The ice feel of the duvet under his skin made Tony wonder if he was running a fever, but before his hand reached his forehead, it came across with something fluffy. He lifted his gaze and raised an eyebrow when his eyes saw his stuffed dinosaur: Raawry (in his defense, Steve had been the one who had named it, not him, though he wasn't sure when he had started to use that name to refer to the stuffie)  How had Raawry emigrated from the playroom to their bed? Tony had no idea, though he was too exhausted to care. He wasn’t really feeling little, so he pushed him away and reached for Steve’s pillow, closing his eyes and pressing his face into it. It smelled like Steve.
