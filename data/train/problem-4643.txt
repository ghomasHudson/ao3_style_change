he was being harsh. Lying to get him to eat at his favorite burger joint wasn’t the same as lying that killed Charlie and caused the
Smirking with feigned bravado, Dean opened his mouth to say something witty about the situation, but a low hiss came from his left and he shut his mouth and turned. More soft green light revealed Ivan, looking much like Vera, only with longer claws and larger patches of scales across his human-like skin. Upon closer inspection, there was also something around his neck. Dean attempted to scrambled further away from the two, which only made Ivan hiss again, causing
“I don’t know, Dean. It’s a difficult decision to make. But after rejecting the throne in Heaven, I’m not sure if I would be allowed to split my time between there and here. Very few angels have spoken with me since I turned down the role of God. Only a few angels from my old Garrison and Ariel have been willing to speak with me.” Castiel responded sadly. Sam and Dean had treated him like family far more than the other angels had since his rebellion, but it still saddened him to know that so few of his family members were even willing to speak to him.
“You were good at magic, but it turns out my mother is a little better. Good enough to bring you back, at least.”
it happen to them. Dean knew there was already something in him that was broken, and falling in love only to lose that person would shatter what remained. He had his family anyway, and that familial love was enough. He could get laid with no strings attached just fine, and didn't need the fairytale of a happily ever after to complete him.
“Not really. I just hadn’t heard from you this week. I wanted to check in. How’s life?” The familiar shuffle of books could be heard in the background, and Dean figured Sam was either at work or had just finished studying.
Dean smiled. “Awesome. Well, uh, I think this is the right house.” He changed the subject as they pulled into the driveway, grasping at the opportunity to change the subject that he had brought up. Cas leaned forward, looking through the windshield. “You should wear your seatbelt.” Dean growled.
The moment Sam left, Cas sat directly across from Dean and tried to meet his eyes. Dean avoided his glance and grabbed a napkin. He began ripping it up in tiny bits just to have something to do with his hands. “Dean.” Cas said softly. “Don’t be mad at Sam. This was my idea.”
Dean glared at his brother. He actually
Cas’ eyes never left the screen and suddenly his face lit up. “We’ve been arguing for over an hour, but she has finally agreed to tell me. She’s typing it out right now.”
Dean immediately froze. He snatched his hand back, a blush spreading all the way to the tips of his ears. What they didn’t notice that when he pulled his hand back, he had a vial of holy water. He splashed it in Charlie’s face, and she blinked at him boredly.
Dean was incredibly pleased to find that Cas liked not one, but
fucking talking about this.”  Dean growled.
Dean immediately tensed and turned over in the bed so that he was facing Castiel with wide eyes. “Y-you don’t have to do that. It took forever to get here, and you didn’t sleep at all in the car.” He bit his lip nervously and slid over to the opposite side of the bed, making room so that Castiel wouldn’t have to walk around to the other side. Castiel finished taking off his slacks and removed his socks while Dean looked everywhere in the room except at Castiel.
Sam was far too excited to let Dean sleep on Christmas, and Dean couldn’t even be mad at him. Sam had been forced to miss out on this excitement so many times as a kid, so when his brother knocked on his door enthusiastically, reminding him that it was Christmas, Dean woke up with a grin and crawled out of bed, grabbing some pajama pants in the process.
The footsteps finally stopped, and he mustered up just enough strength to lift his head high enough to see who the footsteps belonged to.
Dean knew this before even grabbing his, because Cas had all of the contents of his stocking poured out on the ground in front of him on the floor. Dean grinned, reminded of one time when he took Sam trick-or-treating when John wasn’t being a dick about holidays. Sam was leaned against the arm of the couch (wearing a fucking Santa hat), picking out exactly what he wanted from his own stocking, and Dean plopped down next to Cas to empty out his own. When Sam wasn’t looking, Dean slid Cas his Skittles. Dean liked them too, but he knew they were one of Cas’ favorites. The Den was warm, and cozy and Dean was still pleasantly floating from the Djinn juice from the night before, even if it was only slightly.
“Charlie, I’m thrilled to see you, I really am, but-“
From further down the hallway, Dean heard footsteps, and the closer he got to them, the harder his heart beat in his chest, almost deafening the echo of feet. The Mark on his arm thrummed in eagerness at the adrenaline coursing through his veins, and he ignored its desperate chanting, rounding another corner to find himself abruptly smacking into another body. Dean raised his machete and was about to bring it down when a voice stopped him.
Sam looked over at Cas and wasn’t shocked to find that his facial expression was fairly neutral excluding a slight twitch to his eyebrow. He may have been surprised that Dean liked both men and women, but angels saw things like sexuality completely different than humans did, and he didn’t seem phased by it in the least. “Why are you not having any luck?” he asked.
“And you’re having trouble doing all of it by yourself.” Sam finished for him. Cas just nodded. He was back to glaring at the table.
The good mood was short lived though. About ten minutes from the bunker, Cas received a phone call. He revealed that it was Ariel and involved important angelic matters or whatever, and he flapped out of the car before Sam or Dean could even say something to him. If Sam noticed that Dean’s mood immediately soured, he didn’t say anything about it.
“Talk to me, buddy.” Castiel narrowed his eyes at the interruption, but Dean didn’t care. He was clearly upset by something the winged dick heads upstairs had done, and it was already making Dean’s blood boil. Cas was one of the few good things left in this world, and Dean’s need to protect was suddenly making an appearance.
Cas sat down on the edge of Dean’s bed. Reaching out with two fingers to warm Dean with his grace. Dean smiled shyly. Cas was going to end up spoiling him now that he was mostly fully powered up again. The angel thought for a moment. “A group of vampires isn’t going to feed too close to their nest. It risks too much of a chance of them being found. You know that, Dean.”
Hating this question the most, Cas dismissively replied “It changed a lot.” Before hiding behind a sip of his cola.
“Sam is fine. He’s awake-“
“She… she attacked you? Why didn’t you say anything?” Sam’s eyebrows were raised in concern, and he was looking at Dean with those stupid puppy eyes of his.
This. This was the being that Castiel had chosen to be the object of his desire. He was coarse and rude. Inappropriate and imperfect. He cared far too much and showed respect far too little. He sometimes treated Cas like he is a child instead of a man, because he failed to remember that Cas was neither. Cas was often disgusted by how he shoved food in his mouth but was completely captivated by the lips that wrapped around his fork. He was impossible to talk to before at least two cups of coffee and considered ketchup a vegetable. He angered Cas to no end and was perhaps the most insufferable human to have ever walked on the planet. And Castiel wanted him in ways that he couldn’t even begin to process.
. At least not for long. Dean thought about praying to the angel again, or at least shooting him a text, but instead he swallowed hard and turned up the radio when his cassette played Creedence Clearwater Revival.
When Dean realized that Cas had no intention of quickening the pace or bringing him any closer to finishing, he let go of Cas’ hair long enough to reach for the night stand, blindly fishing around in the drawer for the lube without looking away from Cas. He felt Cas’ lips stretch around his cock in something that resembled a smile as he tossed the bottle closer to Cas, and Cas grabbed it before it could even bounce on the bed.
“Fuck, that was a close call.” Dean sighed weakly. “You know she was trying to
“What do you
, he was supposed to have control over bodily functions and carnal thoughts. “Dean!” Castiel whispered urgently. He wasn’t sure why he was whispering, they were alone in their room and Sam was in his.
Later that night, back at Briar Cliff Inn, Dean was in the bathroom brushing his teeth while Sam snored in the next room. He spit the toothpaste out and wiped his mouth, looking up at his reflection. His eyes were immediately drawn to his freckles, and he leaned closer to the mirror to get a better look at them. He had never really paid much attention to his freckles, but they seemed to be exactly the same as they were before he got dragged into the pit. A faint smile appeared on his lips as he eyed the freckles across the bridge of his nose. Cas liked them, and had worked hard on them, and the thought of that made Dean appreciate them a little more.
Dean woke before Cas. Their fingers were just barely tangled between them, taking up the space between their bodies on the plush California King bed. Dean swallowed hard, withdrawing his hand and carefully crawling out from under the sheets as to not disturb Cas. He was holding his breath, had been since the moment his eyes opened, and he made his way to the sliding glass door that led outside to the wrap around balcony, trying not to scream.
that this kind of place was charge and arm and a leg for just a single night stay.
If Dean were the ‘I love you’ type, he was pretty sure the words would have slipped out of his mouth and wouldn’t have stopped coming. But he wasn’t, and instead he just smiled, reaching down and taking Cas’ hand into his own before bringing it to his lips. It was cheesy and gross but it always made women melt, and maybe not just women because it seemed to have the same effect on Cas. Dean was completely and utterly shocked by how easy this was. He was expecting an inevitable freakout once he came down from sex, and sure there was that anxious hum in the back of his mind, but it just felt...right. It felt normal to be sharing a bed with Cas, to be sneaking kisses and giving each other soft smiles. And Dean couldn’t even blame it on the liquor, the whole experience was very sobering.
. He gulped and shuddered, the thought of putting his gun to his head slowly creeping into his mind.
Jay was pretty decent at pool. He was nowhere near as good as Dean, but he was doing a good job at making up for the fact that Carey was either awful at pool or had a few too many drinks to have the best hand-eye coordination. Jay didn’t seem to mind, he just ordered her another drink and smiled at her tenderly when her stick entirely missed the cue ball and she couldn’t stop giggling at how bad she was.
“You… you probably don’t remember me.” He insisted. “God… that was almost 16 years ago.” He ran his fingers through his hair again and looked around quickly to make sure no one was watching them or listening. He dropped his voice lower. “My name is Ricardo. You saved my mother Maria and I from a demon in Wisconsin.”
“Don’t be weird, Cas.” Dean groaned sleepily, looking up at the angel. He had taken his trench coat and suit jacket off and rolled up his sleeves since Dean had fallen asleep. He had also loosened his tie, and unbuttoned the first two buttons of his shirt. Dean swallowed. Hard.
Before Cas could respond, Sam was back, wiping his hands on his jeans and sliding in the booth next to Cas, causing Cas to scoot over.
Dean laughed good naturedly. “Yeah… I guess you could say that. It’s just been a rough couple of months.”
Dean grinned, giddy and child-like. He stood up and offered Castiel his hand. “Whatever you want, Cas.”
that Dean also watched. Even though Castiel preferred this shows antics to the medical inaccuracies of
looks that pissed him off to no end.
“Hey, Cas, how do you feel about Thanksgiving?” Dean asked, turning the radio down. Castiel tented his eyebrows, thinking for a moment.
Cas hadn’t said a word about what happened. The angel wasn’t exactly being avoidant of the topic, he just barely spoke period. Dean would greet him and receive a grunt in response. Dean was going to lose his mind. He didn’t need to know exactly what happened, he just needed to know that Cas was
“And if you’re wrong about what they are?”
Some of Dean’s irritation slipped away as hard as he tried to hold on to it. “Thank, Cas.” He said softly.
This is also the chapter where the angst starts, and things get a bit dark.
“You have my word, Ariel.”
“Yeah, you will be, ‘cause I sure as hell ain’t. I’m getting too old for this, son.” Bobby reached for the hook on the back of the truck.
Sam glanced over at his brother’s sleeping form that following morning, lacing up his boots quietly. He had never told Dean, and never planned to, but there were still nights when Dean woke him up while he screamed in his sleep. They had both been to Hell, and Sam was sure that he probably returned the favor just as often. They just had an unspoken agreement where they didn’t talk about it. There was no need to.
. You made it out and dragged my sorry ass with you. I highly doubt those other dumbass angels could have done that.” Cas’ back twitched slightly, and Dean knew by the way that his wings raised proudly that he was smiling. It made Dean feel like a cinderblock was removed from his chest, and he couldn’t help but grin while he continued preening.
“The show is about banshees?” Castiel asked, trying to deter his thoughts away before he began growing too worried about Dean again. He worried about him enough without fixating what he was doing about the mark.
“I’m actually already packed up, I didn’t really unpack in case we had to get out of town fast. If you give me like five minutes and I can head your way. Just text me the info and I’ll meet you there.”
ended and shifted to reruns of
Dean balled up the wrapped to his burger and crammed it back in the empty paper bag between him and his brother, scrubbing his hand down his face for a moment. “Uh, yeah. Eileen. Hunter chick that you’re learning sign language for that Donna introduced you to. She seems pretty cool.”
. Cas had brought him back to life after finding him overdosed in his own bed, kissed him on the forehead like he was some fucking Disney princess, and then
Vera laughed. It was sincere and as sweet as honey, and Dean…kind of really liked this girl. She gave him a grin so big that he noticed dimples. “You expect me to tell them not to go out on the water? Dean, I think you and I both know that all of this isn’t going to stop me, and so I can’t expect it to stop them.”
.  Castiel fidgeted with one of the buttons on his trench coat as soon as he took a seat on the zabuton, wiggling his socked toes beneath him. Ariel insisted on meeting at a new location every time, and this Japanese café in San Francisco just so happened to have her favorite matcha tea.
“It’s not a ‘date’.” Cas replied, narrowing his eyes. “These were the circumstances that Ariel insisted upon, and these are the circumstances I am willing to provide for her. I will return in a few hours. Good bye, Dean.” He didn’t give Dean enough time to reply before he made it the rest of the way upstairs and out the bunker door. Dean saw him vanish before the door even swung close behind him.
. There is no cure without an archangel, and we have no archangel.”
, but during his developmental stages when John fell short, Dean had no one. It had forced Dean to learn how to talk about his feelings much later in life and in ways that weren’t always conventional or positive.
“Yes… everything is fine for the time being.” Cas hadn’t told Sam or Dean about the angel that might have information on the mark. He didn’t want to get Sam’s hopes up and didn’t want to hear the ‘but at what cost?’ lecture from Dean again. Sam went around to the back of the Impala to grab the holy oil but tossed Dean an angel blade when he passed him.
Cas pushed in agonizingly slowly, and Dean held on for dear life. The intensity of it combined with the way Cas was looking at him was almost too much. He wrapped his legs around Cas’ waist, pulling him in closer. A needy sound escaped Cas’ lips and Cas lost all his composure, bracing himself on his arms on both sides of Dean as he began thrusting deep inside his boyfriend. This was Dean’s favorite part of sex with Cas. It wasn’t the mind-blowing orgasms (those were pretty great too), but it was how it was like Cas was physically unable to stop touching him, stop kissing him.
“Are you sure? I never even heard of this guy until this morning when you told me about him. He could slow us down.” Sam stated.
“I… I don’t really need help with the flesh wounds.”  Cas admitted. “It’s just my wings. My grace can only do but so much-“
“That’s
finding someone with similar interests as him was slim, and Sam knew it. He was hoping that eventually Dean would become so frustrated that maybe, just maybe, he would tell Cas how he felt.
Cas just stared at him for a second before bursting into a fit of laughter, tears of happiness making his blue eyes sparkle. He leaned forward, kissing Dean like his life depended on it. “I've always been yours. Of course I’ll marry you.”
. Of course, there were plenty of books at the Men of Letters that discussed the rumors around angels…but to see one in person? To figure out the perfect combination of magic to force his wings out-“ Sam didn’t let him keep talking, he just lunged with his blade. Magnus rolled his eyes, and with the flick of his wrist, he was sending both Sam and Dean sailing across the room and smacking painfully into a wall with a sickening thud. He immediately looked over at Cas to gauge his reaction, and Dean didn’t miss it. Cas was peaking through his wings again, still trembling. But there was a storm brewing behind his blue eyes. Magnus grinned again. He motioned with his hand again, and Sam’s back was pressed against the wall. He strained against the invisible force but could not move. Dean on the other hand stood up, his right hand going to his left arm. He was pretty sure his forearm was broken, and when he tried to move it was as if his feet were glued to the ground.
“How am I supposed to
“Your freckles. Do you not like them? You seemed angry when that gentlemen pointed them out.”
“Okay, Dean, I’ll stay.” Cas said, that too familiar barely-there smile dancing across his lips. Dean’s face lit up, and Sam smiled at the two of them.
“Do you like it?” Dean asked, appearing so entranced with learning about Cas that his pizza went untouched on his plate.
Dean swiped a hand through the mess on his stomach, figuring it would be better than spit, and yeah, this was definitely one of the gayest things he had ever done. He didn’t have the chance to over think it though, because the moment he had Cas in his hand, Cas’ hips stuttered forward and the only thing on Dean’s mind was making him come, getting to be the reason that composed, calm Cas completely lost it. It was kinda odd and awkward to get the angling right for Dean at first, but the moment he did, Cas was matching the rhythm by fucking into his fist, slouching closer to Dean’s chest and moaning into his ear in between sloppy kisses to Dean’s neck. Dean was positive if he were just a few years younger, that alone would get him raging hard again. Cas writhing and thrusting in his lap certainly wasn’t helping.
The angel was leaned against the door frame that connected the kitchen and the living room. His arms were crossed, and though his facial expression looked curious, Dean could detect the barely-there smirk on his lips. “Hello, Dean.”
Dean had feelings for Cas! He had been making jokes about it for years, had picked up on the longing glances and intimate moments. He had commented on Dean’s willingness to sacrifice so much for Cas regardless of what happened between them. Sam knew he and his brother didn’t exactly have the best record when it came to making and maintaining friendships, but he knew Dean well enough to know that he saw Cas as more than just a friend. For a long time, Sam just thought it was because Dean saw Cas as family, and nothing meant more to Dean than family. But Sam had seen how Dean was with Cassie all those years ago. He had been there to witness the soft side of Dean that he so rarely saw from Dean, a side Sam was now fully noticing was also shared with Cas. When Sam had tried to bring up Dean’s relationship with Cassie, Dean had gotten flustered and just told him to get in the car… the same exact reaction that he had when Sam had tried to tease him about the fact that he and Cas were a couple in the musical that was being produced by the all-girls school. As often as Sam was given fuel to tease Dean about Cas, he couldn’t believe he was just realizing he was right about why there was so much fuel in the first place.
When the song was over, Dean opened his eyes and looked over at Cas, smiling softly. “I know I told you about how much mom used to love The Beatles, and how she used to sing that song to me when I was little, and Sammy was a baby.” Castiel nodded. “But I bet I never told you how dad
“Fine.” Castiel growled, shedding his trench coat and suit jacket and draping them over a chair not far away from the bed.
“Adam was such a good boy. I don’t understand why he would have done this to himself.” Mrs. Brayden sniffed and wiped her eyes. “I mean, he and his boyfriend had broken up recently-“ Dean flinched at the word ‘boyfriend’ and Cas shot him an annoyed look “-but he wasn’t very upset about it. He was the one that ended things.”
“And why did she attack you, Dean? I was under the impression that she only attacked a
“You’ll essentially be doing what you’re already doing except harder-“ Dean swallowed. “The feathers that are loose will come out once you apply more pressure. Don’t worry if I seem to lose a lot, there is already more than enough growing in and many have already grown fully. Some need to be readjusted.” Cas took Dean’s hand in his own, guiding it to an area on his left wing where the feathers seemed to be sticking up haphazardly. “They just need to be straightened out.” Cas looked at his feet nervously.  “I should warn you that once you start preening, my wings will begin to produce an oil. It’s essential for the health of the feathers. You… you may want to get gloves.” Cas blushed, and fuck did Dean want to kiss him. The angel was clearly embarrassed at the thought of his bodily fluids coming in contact with Dean’s hands, and it took a lot of will power for Dean not to make a downright filthy joke.
“Nathaniel Spellman.” Sam filled in for him when he realized Dean had forgotten the victim’s name.
Dean immediately began searching for Cas, cradling the feather like it was fragile glass. He couldn’t stop his fingers from constantly running over the soft plume, completely in awe. There was a weird part of him that wanted to keep it, because an angel feather? That’s
an accident, and receptionist filling in for Ricardo laughed and insisted that he not worry about it when Dean made him go downstairs  to the front desk and apologize about it.
Cas peered over his shoulder curiously. “We have the
. Angel or not, that’s not exactly something that just anyone would do, and it was something that Dean would always be thankful for. So yeah, maybe he
Castiel was completely captivated by Dean during the dinner. He was so relaxed, so at ease with being surrounded by the people he loved that it was hard to believe that this was the man baring the Mark of Cain, a man that had recently tried to rip a Tulpa apart. He was more that willing to give Claire hunting tips but made sure that she was very aware that he wanted her to be safe. It was one of the only times that Claire put her phone down during the entire meal. Dean got medical tips from Alex on things he should probably add to his first aid kits, and even though Castiel knew that Dean already had everything she suggested, he still listened and focused on her words, exchanging ideas with her when it came to sewing up a wound since she was a nurse now. He made sure to tell Donna how great she looked, followed by a vivacious wink because he knew how self-conscious she was and was picking at her food. The delighted look on Dean’s face when she actually started digging in and enjoying herself pulled at something inside of Castiel. Dean complimented Jody’s cooking and new gun she bought and flicked green beans at Sam when he made a bad joke. He raved about how good the mashed potatoes were and made sure everyone knew Cas had made them. He didn’t stop talking about the potatoes until everyone at the table had complimented them. He laughed until he nearly choked on his beer and ate way too much pie. He chastised Claire and Alex for being on their phones, but then asked Alex what app she was playing because he wanted to download it. His body language and actions said it all. He loved every single person sitting around with the table with him.
Castiel didn’t move another inch. “…Dean?” He called back nervously, his voice quiet.
Dean didn’t hug back, still too weak, and even coughed a little against a lapel on Castiel’s trench coat, but Castiel didn’t mind. Dean was alive. That was all that mattered. They could deal with the drug abuse later, Castiel first needed to feel Dean in his arms, feel him living and breathing. “I thought I lost you.” He mumbled gruffly against Dean’s hair. “My grace was weaker than I thought it was, and I was afraid I couldn’t bring you back.”
Dean just glared at him and thought
Cas just rolled his eyes. “If I were asking you on a date, I feel like I should probably drive. And it doesn’t look like that’s happening.” He frowned at his car sadly.
“Uh, like putting mistletoe in doorways I knew they would be standing under during Christmas? It was supposed to be a joke, but…”
“If I’m being honest, I haven’t really explored much outside of my apartment and work.” Cas replied, avoiding Kevin’s eyes. Every time he moved somewhere new, people always asked questions. He knew they were only being nice and trying to get to know him better, but he preferred his privacy.
A bit of a short chapter with an important realization on Cas' part.
***Trigger Warning: torture***
Castiel sighed deeply, jerking the glass out of Dean’s hands and downing its contents. Dean just blinked at him. “As you would say, angels are dicks.”
“Well, I’m sure I’ll see you around. Or at least I hope so, Cas.” Dean shortened Castiel’s name because he felt like pulling out a term of endearment was laying it on a little
“No, keep going!” Sam smiled reassuringly. None of this heaven made sense to him, but it had his interest. Castiel looked down, clearing his throat in embarrassment. But Sam was doing what Dean affectionately called his ‘puppy eyes’, and he knew he could trust him. He inhaled shakily and reluctantly continued.
Dean swallowed. He wasn’t expecting his motives to be questioned. “I dunno. It just feels right. Me doing it.”
them. Who does that?”
The man pulled out his phone, licking his lips and looking a little surprised that his pickup line had worked. He gave his name (Todd, or something) and Dean spouted off his number with a wink. God. He was so dumb. Cas was right there, and it felt so wrong. Despite Todd being attractive and having big, muscular arms that could easily lift Dean and pin him to a wall (whoa, where did that come from?), Dean had no intention of ever texting the guy back if he actually messaged him. He could feel Cas’ eyes boring into the back of his head. Cas’ attitude earlier had made it immensely clear that he didn’t give a shit about Dean’s sexuality, but it still felt so
Cyrus Anderson was even more beat up about his husband’s death than Mrs. Brayden was about her son’s death. With every question that Dean asked, he would only get a few words reply before Cyrus would be a sobbing mess all over again.
“Fuck off, Sammy.” Dean growled, internally wincing when he felt the skin over the mark tear and draw blood from his nails still scraping over it.
“Thanks, Molly!” He shouted over his shoulder, heading for the stairs towards the lobby.
were attractive?
Cas shot him a dirty look, and it wasn’t one of the ones Dean enjoyed being on the receiving end of. “When they sting someone or something, it rips their stinger out along with their entrails. Can you imagine how traumatizing that has to be?”
“Dean, are you okay?” Cas suddenly asked, his concern showing in the tent of his eyebrows. Dean thought maybe his flirting was a little too obvious, but Cas clarified by adding “After what happened today.”
Dean ran his fingers through his hair again, and drew in his knees from under the covers, leaning over them. “Oh. I didn’t know.” He said uncertainly. Of course it made perfect sense. Alastair had always mocked him, reminding him that he was never going to be free of the pit, no one was ever going to be able to save him. But someone had. Dean looked up at Cas, slightly amazed by how his eyes were shining bright blue through the darkness of the room.
Cas finished cleaning the bowl and started drying it, his lips pressed in a tight line of annoyance. And like always, Dean caved. “Why are you washing dishes all of a sudden?”
Dean could hear screams while Cas pressed his palms to vampires and burned their eyes out, leaving nothing but an empty shell. He could hear Sam grunting, fighting his way tooth and nail through the nest. He could hear the swing of his machete, and the sickening
Cas smiled back. "I love you, Dean."
. The universe’s most badass angel. I just think it would be cool to keep.”
Dean heard a familiar whooshing sound to his right, and looked over to find Castiel sitting on the barstool next to him, his elbows on the bar and his hands folded.
. He was pretty sure Sam was going to marry this woman, and while she was incredible at reading lips, he felt like he should at least learn a little sign language.
With Cassie there were no expectations. He loved her, but he knew that it would never work, that it would never last. At the time he had wanted it to, but he was young and dumb. He just took everything a day at a time, not thinking about the fact that one day soon John would tell him to pack up his shit and get in the Impala. The conversations they had were good, the sex was great, and Dean knew it was the closest thing he would have to a relationship as a hunter. When it was time to leave and move on to the next town, it sucked, but Dean wasn’t surprised. He had expected it long before it arrived. He knew that he and Cassie never stood a chance.
Instead of placing two fingers to Dean’s forehead like he normally would, Castiel placed his entire trembling palm to Dean’s head, the flesh of his hand lighting up blue as he pushed his grace forward to bring Dean back, to push life back into him. His hand tremored violently against Dean’s skin. Castiel thanked his Father that he had been rationing his grace since it had been restored because the terrifying thought of not having enough to bring Dean back was at the forefront of his mind. He couldn’t lose Dean. Not again. Not like this.
Dean’s jaw dropped like he had been slapped, and it made Cas chuckle. “Keep bad mouthing my car and I’ll just make you walk home. Baby is a
“Come here.” Natasha, the female demon, demanded once the door was unlocked and opened. Castiel’s wings shuddered. He knew Natasha was glaring at him from across the cage, waiting for him to heel. He cowered in on himself more, and felt his flesh pull at a recent wound on his ribcage, carved by his own angel blade. Castiel imagined what Magnus could possibly have in store for him on this day, and he couldn’t force himself to move. “I said
that instead of choosing any of those he chose a playlist of AC/DC, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Styx, and a few more classics because he felt like he was crawling out of his skin. His hands were shaking so bad that he accidentally exited out of the music player twice before finally being able to select it. He made his way back to Castiel, their lips drawing together like it was exactly what God had intended all along.
“Fergus, I demand that you make these oafs unhand me right now!” She replied shrilly. Crowley frowned. Her thick Scottish accent was like nails on a chalkboard. Maybe he should have just directed the demons to feed her to the dogs once they found her.
Dean was going to have a heart attack. Were they flirting? It kinda felt like they were flirting. If the circumstances were different, less morbid, it seemed like the plot of a terribly cheesy, bad porno.
As he locked the Impala, Dean glanced up at the store, catching sight of the employee behind the register through the window, and he froze for a moment. Even through the dirty window of the gas station, Dean could tell the man was attractive with his wild bird’s nest of dark hair, tan skin, plush lips, and angular nose.
Vera shrugged. “Of course. Do whatever you need to. I would really like the whole ordeal to be fixed sooner than later. All these people losing their lives at sea…not to mention it hasn’t exactly been great for business. Each boat is attached to a numbered post, and if you’ll take a look at that paperwork, all the information you’ll need is right there.”
After fiddling around for a little while, Dean straightened up with a small frown, taking a dirty cloth from his back pocket to wipe his hands on. “You’re not gonna wanna hear this, but you’re gonna have to take this into the shop. It’s not the battery. I’m thinking the alternator needs to be replaced.” Cas just blinked at him and Dean smiled. “It means it’s not something I can fix right here, right now. I would have to fix it at the shop.”
“Her number. I finally got her to give me her number, you perv.”
“Listen, I’m tired of you fucking up the settings on our coffee machine to make your dumb lattes. I tried to make coffee the other day and it came out
He hadn’t realized that Carey had heard him until she spoke up. “I don’t blame you for wanting to get him out of clothes.” She said just loud enough for Dean to hear, nudging him with her elbow and giving him a wink. “I’m a sucker for blue eyes. That’s how Jay got me to agree to this date.”
“I’m leaving.” He narrowed his eyes at Dean. “And I’m bringing the Djinn essence with me. My grace should have gotten rid of any lingering traces of it in your body. It’ll buy us some time while I search harder for a cure.” He didn’t mention the lengths he was about to go in his search for Dean
Ariel sat her coffee down and took a small bite out of a mixed berry macaroon before speaking again. “I have some information that I think may help you and your human. But I need your promise that the information will stay between us.”
Cas pondered it for a moment. “I just want to be happy.”
Dean avoided Castiel’s gaze and rubbed the back of his neck shyly. “They already looked awesome.” He muttered. “I just spruced ‘em up some.” He finally stopped staring at the floor and looked back up, meeting Castiel’s gaze. “Do you need help with them again, or somethin’?”
“I suppose we do share a few similarities. Did you mean it as an insult? I quite liked Spock.”
“They took me seriously when their houses went up in flames-“
“You were dreaming…” Cas pondered, finally realizing. “What were you dreaming, Dean?” Cas tilted his head slightly, causing Dean to roll his eyes.
, so much
Castiel was a lot of things. An angel of the lord, a warrior of heaven, a skilled and sure badass in hand to hand combat, a righteous and wrathful smiter… but one thing he was not, was a natural at shooting a gun. Dean hadn’t really expected
meet his sexy ass. You know, maybe I could remember more about last night over dinner tonight?”
The last boat in the marina was a sleek, black Century 2901 with the name
occasionally changing what exactly the computer systems were supposed to be checking for, but not once had they had a lead on Rowena, or even Crowley. They both seemed to be flying well under the radar, and Crowley wasn’t returning any phone calls.
"I understand that it can be awkward when someone confesses their feelings and they're not reciprocated-"
. I wanted to hear it. God, I've wanted to hear it for so long."
Dean smirked. “So, Crowley is looking for Rowena. All we have to do is track Crowley or his demons and-“
to the guy, and Dean wasn’t interested. He had tried to complain to Eileen since Sam and Benny were still making fun of him, but then she chastised him about being rude and revealed that Castiel was a “total sweetheart”. He apparently knew sign language on top of various other languages, held charity events at the Farmer’s Market every month, and kissed babies and helped old ladies across the street or something. Dean had managed to avoid the (sweet) weirdo since his trip to the Farmer’s Market. Thank god for the privacy fence.
"What?" Dean asked, his voice barely above a whisper. "Cas isn't in The Empty? Where is he?"
“A good thing?” Dean asked, not bothering to hide his frustration. “How could this possibly be a good thing?”
Cas shook his head and started peeling himself away from Dean again, fully willing himself to break the physical connection.
“Cas, how do we get out of here?” Dean asked as Cas slouched to the floor, immediately pulling his wings in on himself but keeping his eyes on Sam and Dean.
Sam studied him for a moment. His little brother’s eyes were raw with emotion and understanding, and it cut Dean to the nerve. Sometimes Dean could lie to Sam’s face and convince him grass was blue and the sky was green, and then sometimes he couldn’t keep a damn thing from him and it was terrifying. “Somethings wrong.” He said softly. It wasn’t a question. They both knew. Somehow, they just both
Christmas Eve passed by in a blur of more eggnog and preparations. Dean baked two pies with Cas’ help, and wasn’t really sure he had managed to keep his hands to himself when the angel ended up covered in flour and looking at a rolling pin like it personally victimized him. Dean managed to sneak outside to set up part of Cas’ gift, and he really needed Sam’s help but refused to ask for it after Sam’s little joke. Of course, Sam had no way of knowing that the joke hit a little too close to home, and he was just being an annoying sibling, but Dean was still a little pissed at him, and still really frustrated over the look on Cas’ face when he mentioned kissing. A huge part of him wished he could have used the mistletoe as an excuse to kiss that confused look off of his face. It seemed that no matter how many times Dean tried to remind himself that Cas was an
Dean pulled some music up on his phone before he started mopping. The music kept him distracted, and kept him in a fairly good mood. The bunker was too quiet with no Sammy and no Cas. Listening to nothing but his own breathing and heartbeat was going to send him to the looney bin, especially with all of the dark thoughts that tried to fill the silence. Dean shook his head and started in the living room first. He turned up the volume all the way on his phone and tossed in on the table, not wanting to bother looking for his headphones in his room. After a few minutes of cleaning, his mood continued to lift because he was too preoccupied for the invasive thoughts like how he should apologize to Cas. The shuffle music option on his phone was making him proud and playing only upbeat songs and he found himself singing along, and even dancing a little. He paused the strum at his mop that he was currently using as a makeshift guitar.
was getting a little stir crazy, it turned out, and they hadn’t really hunted since Cas’ rescue from Magnus. “So, I just got a call from Garth.” Dean snorted and Sam ignored him. “He was working on a case in South Carolina… and he’s completely in over his head, Dean. He has no idea what he’s dealing with, and no other hunters seem to know either. I… I, uh, told him that he can head back to Bess and that we’ll check it out.” Dean immediately opened his mouth to protest but Sam held up a hand to stop him. “I know the hunt it completely out of our way and we could send someone else, but I don’t know about this one. Garth was able to list off everything it’s
“Then, I guess just go…go get laid.” Sam gave him a look and Dean knew Sam expected Dean to storm out right then and there, checking his coat for his keys and not bothering to say goodbye. Instead Dean just stood there, tapping his pointer finger against the neck of the bottle of whiskey, staring at him. Sam sighed, adding “There’s like six bars in a ten-mile radius of the bunker and Uber is a thing.”
“Don’t be so moody, Sam.” Dean shot him a look before returning his eyes to the road.
“The last time I let you cook, the pasta was so salty-“
Castiel didn’t reply, but instead his eyes were drawn to a smudge of ketchup that hadn’t been cleaned on the table. Ariel was right. There was no way anyone would approve of opening Lucifer’s cage to have he or Michael perform the spell. Not even Dean himself would allow anyone to risk that, especially not for him. “Thank you.” He finally said sincerely, looking back up at her.
“So, uhm, I’ll go first.” Sam said through a mouthful of Milkyway bar. “It’s just really simple stuff, guys.” He muttered, tossing Dean and Cas their gifts. “Next year we should go all out, and not wait until the very last second to do Christmas.” He directed these words at Dean, an amused expression on his face.
Castiel jerked the feather out of his hand the moment he laid eyes on it. “Why do you have this?” He asked gruffly brandishing the feather. His eyes went from wide and nervous to a hard glare in a split second.
“Lots of weird stuff is going on.” Sam said, as if that weren’t obvious.
“Dean, can we not relax for five whole minutes without you talking?”
“I was waiting for your return.” Cas replied, standing up straight. He narrowed his eyes and surveyed Dean. “There’s something not quite right about the man you were speaking with. It was concerning.”
“And have you had any luck, Dean?” The angel asked.
“Oh, come on, Dean. Bee stings really aren’t that bad.”
Vera and Ivan didn’t have a lot of information to provide on the case. Vera was in charge of the marina, owned one of the boats herself, and was more than willing to let them check the cameras that scanned the dock. She handed over all information that belonged to the boats that went missing, including their latest GPS locations, and she continued to flirt with Dean the entire time. Every time she crossed and uncrossed her long, tan legs, Dean tracked the movement and licked his lips. There was no real desire, and the interest and flirting were little more than a muscle memory reflex, but Dean
Maybe Dean was selfish. In fact, he knew he was selfish. Seeing Sam like that should have made him happy, it should have made him proud. Instead, it just
On the other side of his neighbor’s yard, barely visible from where he was standing, there were beehives. More than a dozen of them. Right in the middle of the hives was someone in a beekeeper suit. Across the broad shoulders of the beekeeper in swooping lettering the words “Castiel’s Honey” were embroidered. There was even a cute little fucking bee embroidered right under that.
Dean cleared his throat, accidentally a little too dramatically to be casual. “He hasn’t eaten since he got back, Sam.” Dean was pretty sure this particular piece of toast was black on one side since he couldn’t remember flipping it.
“Dean? Cas?” Sam’s confused called from just outside the dressing room. Dean blushed furiously, glad it was taking some of the blood away from his dick, and pulled the door open, stumbling out of the dressing room. He took a giant gulp of air since he could finally breathe, waved awkwardly at Sam, and made up his mind. He was going to fuck Vera.
of the products that he sells here. He even showed me pictures of his hives.”
act this childish since he was an actual child. He was Dean Winchester for fucks sake. He had been to Hell and back both literally and figuratively, he shouldn’t be losing his shit over pining over his best friend. The problem was that while he knew he was in love with Cas, he didn’t think that his ideal life with him in his dream would have been so… domestic. Dean had never even allowed himself to fantasize about that. The closest he let his brain wander to was maybe tangling their fingers together in between hunts, and on an extra rare occasion, sneaking a quick kiss while Sam wasn’t looking. But now that Dean had experienced what it was like to have the whole shebang, he was
“Dean. There’s no need to be upset.” Cas smiled slightly at Dean being so quick to defend his honor.
Dean let out a whining noise, but didn’t protest any further, knowing it was a lost cause. “How are you reading? It’s dark.”
“Thanks, Cas.” Dean whispered. He wanted to continue, blurt out every single thing he was thanking Castiel for, but he stopped there. The angel smiled ever so slightly, and removed his hand, suddenly leaving Dean feeling much colder. “How’s Heaven?” Dean asked, taking the opportunity to change the subject. Cas shifted on the bed uncomfortably, so Dean pushed on. “You know you can come to me if you need anything, right? And you can stay here. You can even hunt with us if you want.”
“You research the town. I call violent deaths.”
Dean just looked at Cas softly, reminded of the time that Cas had lost his mind and showed up on the hood of the Impala naked, covered in bees. While at the time, the situation was alarming and heartbreaking, looking back now it was endearing and funny. “That’s awesome, buddy.” He noticed reusable canvas bag that Cas was holding in his arms from a recently made purchase. Dean tried to lean in and look into it, but Cas shuffled it out of his vision with a glare. Dean wanted to smack himself when he realized it made him pout like he was
from where the hunter had fallen asleep next to him after preening his wings. It had been far too many weeks for most living beings to still pick up on the scent, but as an angel, Castiel was still able to pick up on the smell that was so
Cas looked up at him, their faces much too close. As a hunter, Dean had plenty of close calls, but it was as if with every single one that happened, it was only making things harder. What if one day Sam or Cas didn’t come to the rescue? What if one day he died without exploring this thing between them? He reflexively licked his lips, shivering when Cas’ eyes were drawn to them. Every cell in Dean’s body, every fiber of his being was screaming for him to move in even closer. He knew he should stop, but he didn’t
Sam didn’t attempt to stop him or say anything more as Dean made his way back to Cas’ room. He managed to juggle all the first aid items in one arm so that he could rip Cas’ door open and close it behind him before his brother changed his mind. Cas was sitting in the middle of his bed, wearing nothing but Dean’s sweatpants, with his lefts crossed and his hands in his lap. He already had his wings out, and even though they were significantly duller than the last time Dean had seen them, they still caught the little light in the room, and they were stunning.
Dean got out of the Impala, trying to shut the door quietly. He was feeling generous, and didn’t feel like dealing with Sam’s bitch-face if he woke him up just yet. He pulled his wallet out of his back pocket, sliding out a fraudulent credit card. Today he was ‘Timothy Melbourne’, and Timothy had impeccable credit. Despite the nice digs, he would have no problem booking a couple of nights at the Inn.
Hearing his name said in a familiar, gruff voice had him thrusting his hips again, pleasure shooting through his body. But then consciousness crept up on him further, and realization slowly dawned on him. He was in Bear Creek, North Carolina. In a shitty motel. On a cheap, most likely soiled bed. Next to a very warm, soft, delicious smelling angel.
” Dean practically growled. “I just think it’s kinda messed up that he wouldn’t let me go. What if he needed back up, Sam?”
“Jesus, Dean. You’re a terrible host.” Sam said, laughing. He grabbed the plate and piled on all of the sides so the steak wasn’t quite so lonely, and then handed it Cas. “What do you want to drink, Cas?”
“You’re welcome, Dean.” Cas nodded to him, meeting his eyes in the mirror again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“None of this was your fault, Cyrus.” He knew he should be remaining professional, and still referring to him as ‘Mr. Anderson’, but Dean would be damned if he didn’t feel absolutely horrible for the guy. He looked over at Cas. Between Cas and Sam, Dean knew exactly what it felt like to lose someone and blame yourself for it. “Just contact us if you need anything, okay?”
Dean sighed contently, somewhere between consciousness and sleep. Someone was in bed with him, and they were warm and soft and smelled
“Thanks, man.” He grunted. The guy was scrawny. His clothes were ill fitting, his shirt so large that the collar hung around his neck, revealing prominent collarbones. His jacket was equally oversized with the sleeves pushed up to his elbows. He needed a shave and a shower, but he looked incredibly content, and Dean almost asked him how he managed that. Instead, he lit up a cigarette of his own, leaning against the wall. He wasn’t going anywhere near a gas tank with a cigarette at hand and Baby nearby. “You look like you’re having a great day.” The man finally offered, sarcasm sticking to every word
“But they’re using
Cas shimmied over to the side of the bed that Dean had been lying on, and peered down at him with worried eyes. “Are you okay, Dean?”
“Yes, but that one is
When Dean walked inside, he immediately slid the lady behind the counter his credit card. “Can I book a room with two beds for the weekend?” He asked. The lady grabbed his card, nodding and smiling warmly. Dean couldn’t help but check her out. She was quite a bit older than what he normally went for, but he could tell that she was an attractive lady, and probably even more so back in her prime. She had dark curly hair that reached her shoulders, and bounced every time she moved. Her skin was a soft caramel, causing her hazel eyes to pop. Dean smiled at her flirtatiously, maybe she could tell him something about the case. “So, do you own this place?”
. Sam had tried to dismiss Dean’s New Year’s resolution, thinking that maybe Dean had just been keeping something from Cas and the resolution was to finally talk to him about it. None of them were exactly great about being open with each other. But deep down, he knew it, he
“Yes.” Cas answered, his hands immediately fumbling with the button of his pants. “But if you would’ve just given me a second-“ the jeans finally came undone, and Cas looked back up at him. They were just inches apart, and Cas let go of his grip on the denim, the jeans pooling at his feet. Dean soaked in every detail of the situation from Cas’ bird’s nest of hair to his muscular arms in the v neck,
keys?
“Well, can you move out of the way for us people that want to?” Dean and Castiel turned to both look at a petite, very irritated looking woman. She tossed a lock of brunette hair over her should to punctuate her point.
At first Dean thought it was cocaine. Most hunters had dabbled in it when sleeping was not an option during a hunt, and could result in a very unpleasant death. But that wasn’t Dean’s thing. Having to do it was usually the result of a screw up somewhere, and if there was one thing that John had taught him, it was
The pool boy was standing there holding a pool vacuum, looking just as awkward as Dean felt. “Uh, you guys might want to take this to your room.” He lifted the vacuum to show them. “This thing is pretty loud. Not exactly music for a romantic setting.”
“Oh.” Dean breathed a sigh of relief. “I mean, yeah it was kinda freaky. But that comes with the job. Freaky shit happens all the time.”
“Oh wow, thanks for attacking me like that on my birthday.” Dean muttered sarcastically before letting his head drop back down on his pillow.
. You should go check her out!
Please pay attention to the tags for this fic. There is at
Dean glared at him. He was busted, but he took another sip at the disgusting whiskey. He figured the Men of Letters would have more expensive taste. “It’s my birthday, Sammy. Why not celebrate?” He raised the bottle to Sam but was pretty sure the smile he tried to force was more of a grimace.
Unlike last time, when he realized his predicament, he didn’t flail and jerk away. Instead, he just met Castiel’s eye’s awkwardly before they slowly slid down to look at where his thigh met Castiel’s crotch.
Dean had no expectations that they would find anything in the library of the bunker, but when Cas looked at him with hopeful eyes, Dean followed the angel and his brother out of the dungeon.
Dean didn’t say anything. Sam didn’t get it. Maybe Dean had forgotten to mention how he couldn’t just
“I’ll help.” Dean said following in his footsteps. He popped the trunk to the Impala and huffed in annoyance when he saw Cas disappear from the backseat and felt the gust of air of him appearing behind him. He didn’t say anything, because he knew Castiel was excited about getting his wings back and he refused to be a dick about that. Dean reached into the plastic Walmart bag that Sam had tossed in the trunk when he had went shopping for more spray paint. He pulled a can out when the color on the cap caught his eye. “Really, Sam? Bright pink? Is there a reason you bought
So their first time wasn’t perfect. But it was perfectly imperfect… and neither of them would have it any other way.
Dean groaned. He wasn’t drunk enough for this. “I don’t know! I’ve never really thought about it! They’re just there!” He snapped. Castiel suddenly looked very sad, and Dean wondered what the fuck was wrong him. The angel took another sip of his beer, but he looked like he was about the zap out of the bar any second.
to make himself suffer as much as possible. What the fuck was wrong with him? Was he just going to keep pushing his luck until Cas finally socked him in the face?
“The holy water won’t work.” Cas interrupted. “At least I don’t believe it will.” He exhaled deeply. “I’ve never heard of a Tulpa taking the form of the devil. It could take a number of things to kill it. That’s why I’m uncomfortable allowing you two to do it alone. I’m here for assistance.”
A few minutes into the video, Dean’s hand picked up speed as he felt heat tightly coil from within him. But a few moments later, the video had ended, and he hadn’t come. He groaned in frustration, using his clean hand to restart the entire video. He imagined that he was the guy in the video, and it was his cock that the woman was drooling over and swallowing down. He imagined his hands fisted into her dark hair, pushing her head up and down, and a little moan escaped his lips. He was so close that he could taste it. But the video ended
“In theory, it does sound ‘awesome’. But feathers…. They’re complicated. When it’s time for them to molt, they don’t always come out when they’re supposed to. When it’s time for them to grow back, they don’t always align perfectly. Then, in order for them to be healthy they need to be properly oiled-“
when all he wanted to do was kiss Cas. "No- I mean yes- I mean... I knew what you meant Cas."
“I’m not worried about your little boyfriend.” Seb snapped. Dean smirked. The fear in the vampire’s eyes told a different story.
“Me too.” Dean confessed, helping her up with every intention of pulling her in for another kiss. Instead, she giggled and danced out of his reach, suddenly grabbing the hem of her shirt and pulling it over her head. Dean swallowed hard, not intending to move this fast, but 100% on board with it.
Seb grinned and wrapped an arm around her waist. “Oh, well it’s quite the story…” Dean felt his face burn hot and pulled against the ropes binding his wrist again. “Who knew the famous hunter was into ladies,
I'm starting to think I'm becoming a narcissistic writer, because I got so meta with this chapter. First Sam saying that their life isn't a show, and then mentioned Dark Angel when Jensen actually stared in it. Whoops. If the show writers can get away with it, so can I.
As the days passed and January melted into February, Sam knew his idea was working. Dean had ended up making an account on “Cupid’s Arrow” and was spending a lot of his free time swiping through the app and filling out the questionnaires on it. Each time, Dean would make a frustrated noise and slam his phone down. What Dean didn’t know that Sam did was that “Cupid’s Arrow” was absolute
doing it for him. “Yeah, okay.” He said smally. He was pretty sure Cas could tell him to do anything and he would agree. Cas smiled down at him, and even though Dean was drunk on both liquor and just
Dean smiled reassuringly, taking in her big, blue, empathetic eyes. “You just leave that up to me and my partners, sweetheart.” He assured her. “The best thing you can do is be safe. If you really want to go the extra mile, you might want to warn the owners of all these boats that uh… undercurrents and bad weather have been causing a lot of issues and the water could be dangerous. Try to convince them to stay out of it.”
Vera chewed on her bottom lip and avoided his eyes for a second. She plopped down on the seat behind the helm sighing deeply. “I know you can’t tell me… what’s going on here.” She met his eyes again. “Feds are sworn under oath or whatever, right? I guess I don’t need details. I don’t even know if I
. Because he has stupidly forgotten that he had called Crowley. He tried to stand again, but his legs immediately gave out under his weight. A wide grin spread across Magnus’ face and he snapped his fingers.
“I wasn’t even aware this place existed.” Cas answered honestly.
She hopped up excitedly, once gain grabbing Dean to steer him in a certain direction, this time to the front of the boat. “See, the thing about a Century 2901 is-“
A strong gust of wind made its way through the forest surrounding the grass-less circle on the earth, causing leaves to rustle, twigs to snap, and branches to bend. When the gale reached the tramping ground, it kicked up a cloud of dust causing Sam and Dean to cover their eyes momentarily. Castiel squinted through the dust and dirt, his angel blade dropping from his sleeve. The dust settled, and Dean blinked the dirt out of his eyes, revealing the massive beast that the Tulpa had manifested as.
had gone soft for the hunter.
Neither of them would be able to tell you how they made it to the bedroom if they tried. It was all in whirl of sloppy kisses and uncoordinated, wandering hands. Dean’s skin was alive under Castiel’s loving hands, and for the first time in his life, he felt truly loved by someone other than family. He pulled away from the angel long enough to mutter something about playing some music. Of course Dean had some cheesy 80’s romance ballads (that would cause Sam to snort) that would set the mood. But he was so
you. Besides, this thing is really on here.”
“Dean, do you know how many years it takes to be a lawyer-“
Dean just swallowed. He was surprised that Sam hadn’t come running but was thankful that he hadn’t heard anything. Sam would worry, and it was bad enough having Cas looking at him like he was a fragile little tea cup that might break any second. “I…” Dean started but he didn’t even know what to say. This was the closest they had been in each other’s personal space intentionally in a long time, it was bordering how Cas used to stand before Dean gave him the personal space conversation… and Cas still hadn’t let go of his face. “Thank you.” He said softly, completely captivated by the blue of his best friend’s eyes. So fucking blue and deep like the ocean. If Cas was the sea, Dean wanted to fucking drown in him. Dean wasn’t sure if that made sense but he didn’t care.
“Yes, I
By the time Dean reached the den wearing his worn pajama pants and Led Zeppelin shirt (he was a little proud that the red plaid pants matched the red in the font on the shirt), Sam had already made peppermint hot chocolate and was having an animated conversation with Cas. Dean smiled sleepily when he noticed that Cas had once again ditched the trench coat and suit jacket. He felt like Cas was making himself at home a little more every time he did.
Of course, Sammy cleared his throat because he thought it was weird. “Well, there is Michael and Lu-“
It was then that Ariel gave him a knowing look. A teasing smirk appeared on her face. “You know, you’re going to have to get help with that-“
“I will be able to contain their power and prevent their energy from harming you. Are you ready?”
. He would even deal with some holes in his clothing here and there. But once something had bleach on it, it went in the trash. He was not about to be one of the douchebags that wore acid washed jeans, even if it wasn’t intentionally.
Dean just rolled his eyes in frustration and went back to blankly staring at the book in front of him as Cas left the library. Dean tried to focus on the page, but it was a lost cause. With Cas no longer there to distract him with his too blue eyes, barely-there smile, and skilled large hands wrapped around a book, all Dean could think about is how he almost brought a machete down on his brother’s neck. All he could think about was how regardless of how hard he had been fighting it, he had no control over what the mark was making him do, how it was making him feel. He had almost killed both Cas and Sam now, and no matter how much he drank, no matter how hard he tried to stay calm, the mark was winning the war that was raging inside of him.
Dean was just pulling his broccoli and cheddar stuffed chicken out of the oven when his doorbell rang. He gently placed the pan on a cooling rack, and tossed his oven mitts on the counter, wondering who was paying him a visit. He expected Sam, Eileen, or maybe Bobby, and was surprised to find Cas on the other side, gently cradling a giant jar of honey. The honey had a black and yellow ribbon around it with a perfect little bow tied right under the lid. As soon as their eyes met, Cas blushed slightly, and Dean grinned.
Cas swallowed his last bite slowly. He wasn’t sure what he was expecting. Normally when people offered so much personal information about themselves, they usually expected the same in return. “I finally moved away from my mother. She was… very overprotective and over bearing. I was a… sick child. She always worried that I would get sick again, or that people would treat me differently if they knew about it.”
Ten minutes later, and Dean was next to Cas on his bed, surprised to see the angel stuff breakfast in his face. Conversation was surprisingly easy once Cas got some coffee in him, and Cas was thrilled to know that Dean had checked on his bees while he had been virtually comatose over the past week. Dean couldn’t hide the blush that crept over his face while Cas praised him to the bee care and applying the honey to their breakfast.
“He doesn’t know, Vera.” Ivan reasoned. “You know how unaware humans are of what they do to impact the world around them.” Ivan swam over to the two of them, standing up in the water next to his sibling. “This is a last resort.” Ivan explained. “Our numbers… we’re almost extinct
“I promise.” He responded loyally.
A particular loud snore from Sam jarred Dean from his thoughts. He felt sick to his stomach, and angrily flopped from his side to his back. He tried to avoid the memory of Daniel at all costs, because it reminded him of all the backhand comments John had made towards gay people when Dean was growing up. It wasn't that John particularly had a problem with gay people, but when he had made it abundantly clear that he didn't want that for his sons when he assumed that Dean was flirting with a guy as a teenager. He shuddered, remembering how the next day after Daniel, he had scrubbed the backseat of the Impala like someone had spilled a bright red slushie all over it. If only he had been able to scrub the memory from his brain.
Claire glared daggers through him. “It’s just some guy.”
, Dean. This… this lock is enchanted. I can’t get it off.” Dean’s eyes went back to Cas, but the angel had once again wrapped his wings around himself. “Why… why can I see his wings? Why are they out?” Sam asked quietly, sadly, like he already knew the answer.
fans.” Dean snapped.
Dean remembered Daniel well, almost too well, despite his inebriated state. Dean had been shot down six times that night, and he was growing increasingly frustrated. Even though his stomach was full of beer and liquor, he still felt painfully empty, and he had been hoping that maybe being drunk
“What’s so funny?” Dean asked, trying to distract himself as he took another sip from his beer.
Sam shot him another disgruntled look, but Dean smiled noticing that his expression immediately softened when he looked back at Eileen. “I’m in South Carolina right now. I could swing by on the way back to the bunker. It would be a few hours though. ‘A few’ being generous.”
“Can I use the library?” Cas asked abruptly.
that wouldn't remove the Mark of Cain, but would placate it and buy them more time. Castiel and Sam provided her with the ingredients and the spell worked, but Rowena used it as a distraction and and escaped with the book. Dean, noticing a change in the Mark of Cain, returned home afraid that Sam and Cas had sacrificed themselves somehow in order to dull down the Mark's urges. Dean, much more like himself than he's been in weeks, moved back into the bunker to help Sam attempt to track down Rowena, and find a cure for the Mark.
Dean thought to himself.
The rest of that night had been a bit of a blur. Well, Dean always tried to convince himself it was a blur. He was sure that if he tried to remember hard enough, he would be able to remember the entire night in detail. But he didn’t
“She didn’t. Hasdiel was able to track her down anyway. He was able to get her to agree to meet me, even if just for a short amount of time. She agreed under the promise that she pick the location and time.” As if that was a sufficient comment towards being late, Castiel began making his way up the stairs.
"I noticed that you liked her, so I brought her back." Jack's voice made him jump. He didn't notice that Jack had appeared in the grass a few feet away.
of humans. You pollute and you litter, not caring what it does to all the other living creatures on this planet. There already weren’t many of us. We’ve never had large numbers like werewolves or vampires. In the 19th century, humans caught on to what we are. Almost, at least. Many of us were mistaken for witches and burned at the stake.” Vera shuddered. “Throughout time, humans have only killed more and more of us. Every time there was an oil spill, some of us died. Every broken net has the potential to trap and kill one of us. Some of us have starved because of humans over fishing, depleting the number of edible fish for us. We don’t
going to explain a wet dream to you, and I am
Sam shrugged. “They were out of red and black and it was on sale.”
“Why’s that?” Dean stripped his jacket and kicked off his boots, keeping his voice quiet while Sam snored away in the bed he had already claimed. Dean couldn’t stop shivering.
Dean’s face visibly lit up with a huge grin, suddenly paying more attention to the conversation. Sam huffed a disproving sigh. “So, what exactly did the women report?”
“You… kept my feather?” Castiel asked in wonder.
Dean just blushed and looked away quickly before walking over to Cas. Jay kept shooting adoring glances at Carey that she didn’t return because she was too busy playing on her phone now that Dean had walked away. Dean shuffled closer to Cas, leaning in to whisper in his ear. “Listen…those two are on a date and we need to let them win so that Jay can impress Carey. So no using your powers.”
The bar was strangely crowded for a Thursday night, and Dean was already uncomfortable. It’s not that hanging out one on one with Cas was awkward, but Cas was being…weird. Granted, he had been acted weird ever since Dean had been trying to distance himself from him again. There wasn’t really a point in submersing himself in the online dating world if he was still being clingy towards Cas and pining over him. But at the same time, he knew that Cas had no way of knowing why Dean had been practically ignoring him over the last couple of weeks, and Dean felt bad. He also missed his best friend. A lot.
“I enjoy all music. It’s one of my favorite things that humanity has created.” The angel’s eyes had returned to the field when Dean finally glanced back at him again.
, Sam?” The annoyance in Castiel’s voice was clear.
Dean laughed and tried to ignore the warm feeling in his chest at Cas remembering and ordering his favorite beer. “Okay, so maybe we’ve both been kind of brats lately.” He gave Cas a warm smile and grabbed his beer when Cas slid one over to him.
“You’re wrong. You know nothing about Dean.” Castiel’s voice was hoarse from disuse, and it stung his throat.
“And I
But the part that perplexed Sam the most was that he didn’t think Dean
“Are you even listening to what I’m saying, or are the too busy sulking over Cas not letting you go with him?” Sam finally groaned, realizing that Dean’s eyes weren’t even on the computer screen. Dean was sitting down in front of Sam’s laptop while Sam hovered behind him, trying to explain that they may have a lead on Rowena. Dean’s eyes were focused on periodically darting to the bunkers entrance as he waited for Cas to return.
“How do you…survive?” He asked, looking concerned.
Dean felt something flip in his stomach. He hadn’t exactly gotten his hopes up about Cas coming home with a win, especially since it seemed like things always came to a dead end when it involved the mark. It wasn’t that that was making him feel bad. It was the utterly defeated look on Cas’ face. It was him being even more disappointed about not bringing home a win, and Dean was too much of a dumbass to tell him that just having Cas come back period felt like a pretty big damn win. “We’ll figure it out, Cas.” He said hoarsely. Cas met his eyes and stared into them unblinkingly. Dean held eye contact with him, trying to be both reassuring and get comfort of his own in return.
The flames of the candles began flickering, as the speed from the pencil picked up, causing both Olivia and Bethany to back away as well. The pencil spun so fast that it flew off the ground, barely missing Bethany’s head before sticking into the hotel room wall with such force that half of it disappeared in the drywall. The flames of the candles whipped back and forth for a moment before they went out, shrouding the room full of darkness as it filled with the girls’ screams.
He knew it was probably stupid, getting his hopes up to have a semi normal Christmas. Chances were always that someone would be working, or have a hunt, or
Listen.....I
Every time he thought about the impossible possibility that he could actually have something more with Cas, he couldn’t breathe. Thinking about holding Cas’ hand made his hands shake violently because of the fear that he fucked up everything he touched. Thinking about kissing Cas just reminded him of all the horrible words that had escaped his lips when he was mad at the angel, proving that Dean would never deserve him. Thinking about having Cas in anyway that was more than what he already had reminded him that he wasn’t allowed to have good things without it being violently ripped from him or used against him.
between two angels. Sometimes Castiel was convinced that Dean being human was possibly the most infuriating circumstance in the world “Thank you.” He replied tightly.
It was easier to accept now that he was pleasantly high, floating on a worriless cloud. It was easier to accept that Cas would never return this want, return these feelings that Dean had been trying to shove in a closet with his sexuality for years. It didn’t matter. Cas just being Cas, just being there, it was enough. Dean would take him in any way he could have him.
“The chick from Harry Potter?” Dean asked.
When Dean looked back over at Cas, there were two women in the early 20’s speaking to him, unintentionally blocking his path. One kept touching her pretty, red hair flirtatiously and the other touched his arm as she spoke. Cas’ eyes were huge and nervous, and Dean grimaced, realizing he was going to have to step in. “Excuse me.” He mumbled to Tom. He didn’t hear the other man mumble ‘not boyfriends my ass’ as he made his way over to Cas. “You ready to go?” He asked the angel, making sure to scowl at the girls before looking back at Cas.
“If we’re being honest, yeah I do. I feel really bad for him. I can’t believe on top of everything else he’s doing upstairs, he's been working cases so that we could relax. He’s one of the good guys, you know?” Sam looked thoughtful and empathetic, tugging at Dean’s heartstrings.
“Dean!” and that was
Magnus strolled towards them, not even acknowledging the angel blade Sam was wielding. “I wouldn’t quite say that he put me up to it.” He shrugged. “It didn’t take much convincing once he told me he had an
Cas thought for a second. “That’s your favorite band.” He finally responded.
“I’m burning, I’m burning, I’m burning for you.” Dean sang along to the Blue Oyster Cult song that blared from the Impala’s speakers. He had the windows down as he looked over the car for the third time that day. Baby was clean enough to eat off of, but Dean was so
Castiel raised an eyebrow. “We?”
Now was not the time for sexual innuendos, but it didn’t stop Dean’s brain anyway. He shook his head. “Actually, I’m your neighbor.” He said dumbly, unable to take his eyes off Castiel. Wasn’t he supposed to be cursing the guy out or something?
“But they don’t?” Charlie asked, frustration clear in her words.
Castiel had been around since before the dawn of mankind. He knew that a ‘wet dream’ was a name that humans had given to dreams about sexual intercourse. What he didn’t know was what this had to do with him, or why Dean was so embarrassed…and he was beyond curious as to why.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever, Sammy. Let’s head out, I’m starving.”
“Son of a bitch!” Dean yelled as a now dead honeybee fell from his hand. Dean ripped the stinger out of his palm unceremoniously and didn’t want to think about how he was used to it by now.
Dean turned on his barstool to see a man staring at him, his blue eyes full of mirth. The man had perfect, straight white teeth and a short beard that framed a handsome face. His brunette hair was longer than Dean’s but shorter than Cas’ and pushed back out of his face. The man’s outfit was similar to Dean’s, so he too looked out of place in the bar.
(See the end of the chapter for
When he got to his room, he slammed the door and locked it. He didn’t have to think twice about reaching in his jacket pocket for his small Djinn juice kit.
“I know how to shoot a gun. I also have my angel blade.”
Dean forced himself to snap out of it. Yeah, the weirdo was hot, but his bees were still being a menace. “Uh, yeah. Are you Castiel?”
Sam shrugged. “Sometimes colds come on fast.” Dean opened his mouth, most likely to let Sam know he wasn’t buying it, but Sam kept going. “Just do me a favor, and on the way back, stop at a gas station or something and get me one of those little bottles of orange juice.”
Dean was already fucking this up, but it was so hard to just
The waiter came back with their food, almost dropping it when he saw Castiel. He looked over at Dean who refused to meet his eyes, and Sam picked up on the guy blushing bright red. Sam almost started laughing again, realizing that the waiter thought that Cas and Dean were
Charlie sighed. “Bathioul returned later and gave me a get out of jail free card.” She shrugged, but her face suddenly became sad, and she avoided Sam, Dean and Cas’ eyes. “He was able to pull some strings with the bosses upstairs. Since I wasn’t truly happy in Heaven, he let me come back just long enough to meet Emma Watson. Then…. I have to go back.” She said the last sentence softly.
Dean hadn’t even noticed Sam had entered the dungeon again until he cleared his throat. Dean dropped his arms and took a step back, schooling his face so he didn’t look like a kid that had just been caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
“It’s in Quantico, Virginia, and it’s malevolent.” Cas replied simply. Dean scoffed. He hadn’t exactly expected Castiel to give every detail, but some elaboration would be nice.
“Oh?” Sam’s tone immediately perked up with interest. “You gonna ask her out?”
“Really? I’m sure that most have been very hard for you. Are the cops certain that they’re suicides?” Molly fixed him with an annoyed look. "I mean, I just want to make sure you and all the guests are safe."
“Cas… I know what we talked about last time, but-“
Dean didn’t have the energy to judge himself for the strangled, worried noise that escaped his throat. “Cas…” He croaked, looking up. Maybe if Cas didn’t answer the prayer, an abandoning god would. “Buddy, we haven’t heard from you in weeks. We’re… we’re worried about you. You said…” Dean inhaled shakily. “You said before you left that you were just a prayer or a phone call away.” He could feel Sam’s eyes on him. “Please.” His voice cracked around the word. Dean closed his eyes, praying for the rustle of wings or the swish of a trench coat, but the only noise he was greeted by was the sound of his own heart beating in his ears. He only opened his eyes when he heard Sam’s sharp intake of breath followed by his fingers clacking on the keyboard in front of him.
Dean wasn’t gay. He just
“Oh, kill them. I’ve definitely never thought about that. Especially since when they die, they come back. Every! Bloody! Time!” Crowley yelled.
Dean laughed nervously. Okay then. The guy had a weird sense of humor, and a voice that sounded gravelly and just perfect for fucking. Dean could handle that. He rubbed the back of his anxiously but kept his smile intact. “It, uh, was just a joke. A really bad one, apparently.” He raised his hand holding the pie. “I’m just here for this.” He added before placing it on the counter.
Sam dropped his hand from Dean’s shoulder and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “What was that terrible advice you gave me in high school? ‘The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else’? or something like that?”
That backfired when an employee asked him if he needed any help and turned around and yelped “I’m fine!” before walking directly into a wooden swing set on his way to get the main part of the gift. He ended up having to get a cart and was being hardcore judged by a little old couple for dropping his packets of flower seeds everywhere because he was too busy grinning over a picture that Cas had texted him of the inside of the bunker lit up with Christmas lights. Dean picked up Cas’ gift and carefully placed it in the cart, thankful that the Impala had a backseat with how massive it was.
Dean opened his mouth to say something but closed it when he realized that
“That sounds awesome, Cas!” Dean said enthusiastically, but his grin fell when Sam looked at Cas sympathetically.
As Dean slowly regained consciousness, he was certain of exactly four things. The first thing was that there was a sharp, searing pain shooting up his arm from the Mark of Cain, causing his blood to run hot with anger that was stronger than he had felt in a long time. The second was that he was sitting in water from his abdomen down, and his hands were bound behind his back with some sort of coarse rope, judging how it was digging into his wrists. The third thing was that him trying to stamp out his feelings for Cas was making him a dangerously sloppy hunter. The fourth and final thing he was certain of , was that he had sand all over him, especially in places that sand absolutely did not belong.
“What?”

was the last thing Dean thought before everything went black.
“Sam, I told you-“
Dean’s mood began to lift a little on the ride back to the bunker. Cas wasn’t
“Why I’m your new master, of course. Though I suppose I
A relatively short, clean cut man in an expensive suit was staring down at Castiel like he had just won the lottery. “Crowley suggested using a ring of holy oil. Can you imagine? Me using magic so weak? Between the dark magic that I’ve been dabbling in for decades, and a little help from
Sam immediately ran over to him, Cas at his heels. “But Cas was there, Dean. There has to be another way.”
Their lunch was awkward at best. Sam tried to force conversation and assure Dean that there would be a real lead soon, that Crowley or Rowena, or someone working with them would slip up and leave a trail. Dean didn’t want to hear it. It was his birthday and he would be petty if he wanted to.
Dean didn’t really remember setting any of it up. He didn’t really remember getting the awful plastic bag or syringe and needle out of his med kit. He didn’t really remember taking his belt off to tighten it around his arm. He didn’t really remember heating up the spoon. All he remembered was drowning. All he remembered was feeling like the entire weight of the world was attempted to make his chest cave in. Then he remembered a needle in his arm. He remembered a fleeting moment of regret and hysteria fighting against the overwhelming pain and loneliness… and then nothing. He didn’t feel anything. No pain, no doubt,
“Never said he was.” Ricardo replied with a grin. Dean decided to shut his trap because the kid was way too amused by all of this.
human mates by any means, Dean Winchester, but if we don’t do
“You know, I’ve spent my whole life thinking I was good at pool.” He mumbled as the 6-ball bounced off of a corner pocket instead of going in.
And Dean didn’t think that would ever stop being terrifying.
Cas smiled at him gratefully. “When I was able to restore Heaven, and all the angel’s graces, it manages to repair the feather follicles from where they had been burned and heal the feather’s quills.” A look of realization was coming across Sam’s face, but Dean was still completely confused. “The feathers that we had lost were able to grow back, and the remaining damaged feathers could also be replaced by the new growth.” Cas sighed in frustration.
“I’m trying to tell you I’m in love with you, you fool.” The beer bottle slid out of Dean’s hand, hitting the ground. But neither of them broke the electric eye contact between them.
The employee was helping check in an order of a few cases of El Sol from its delivery driver as Dean glanced up at him, making his way to the aisle that had pie. The pie was cheap, and the ingredients were lacking, but Dean had a sexy doctor in cowboy boots waiting for him on his TV screen back home, and he didn’t have time to be picky as he grabbed a barely-passing apple pie. He thought about grabbing a bag of Doritos and a 2 liter to make his purchase a little less sad, but winced when he realized that more junk and sugar probably only made it worse.
(See the end of the chapter for
about that anymore. Now it was about finding Crowley so that Dean could rip him apart for his role in what had happened to Cas. The mark dully throbbed at the thought, and Dean absentmindedly scratched at it.
Sam knew it was a long shot, and that was an understatement. He had been there while angel’s blamed Castiel’s rebellion on Dean, blamed Dean for all the bad things that had happened to him. And he knew his brother well enough to know that Dean thought he was toxic for the people he loved. It wasn’t true. Dean was the best person Sam had ever known, and probably ever would know. But there were few good things in life that Dean felt he was worthy of.
“Worrying. Because this is a big step for you. Everything that happened tonight is huge for you.”
Dean barked out a laugh. “You’re not wrong.” He sighed. “How many times have I gotten ‘kidnapped’ in the past few months? I’m getting sloppy.”
what we sensed.” Ivan finally spoke up. “That’s why he’s special.”
Dean licked his lips nervously. “Sure. What is it, Vera?”
“Angels don’t breathe.” Dean said, swallowing hard. Castiel shot him a disgruntled look, so he added “Uh, listen, Cas. I’m not sure what you’re doing. I’m not sure
“Have a good day, Dean.” Cas replied, and
people, to make people’s lives better and provide them with faith and hope. Dean had broken the first seal. Dean had taken the Mark of Cain. Dean was too toxic and messed up for an angel to ever love.
There was the sound of rustling feathers and a gust of wind that caused a few napkins to go flying, and Cas appeared next to Dean. “Hello, Dean.” He turned his attention to Sam. “Sam.”
I promise there’s a reason for the app, and it’s not just to make this slow burn slower. Sam knows the app isn’t going to make Dean get over Cas. We know the app isn’t going to make Dean forget Cas. Just hang in there.
Dean was pretty sure Sam was talking about the case involving a shapeshifter that he had just helped a hunter named Eileen wrap up, but Dean wasn’t paying attention. He was in the front seat of the Impala, stuffing a double bacon cheeseburger in his mouth even though the thought of food turned his stomach and tasted like ash in his mouth. Normal. He had to act normal. He had to act like Cas hadn’t just found him dead in his own vomit a couple of hours earlier. He had to act like Cas definitely didn’t give him a kiss on the forehead before he left. A really sweet, tender, thoughtful kiss that still had Dean reeling. It had taken every ounce of Dean’s will not to wrap his arms around Cas’ neck and haul him in for a
“Singer’s Auto Repairs… that’s where my boss Nora suggested I take it this morning. You work there?”
Dean looked down at the Mark of Cain on his arm. “Because of the mark? And Rowena and Heaven?”
Sam felt his heart clench because of how proud he was of Dean. Dean had a long way to go when it came to development such as expressing his feelings and being honest with himself, but Sam had seen how much he had grown and changed just in the past few years alone. Dean wasn’t emotionally stunted. So many people from the outside looking in probably thought he was, but Dean was just doing the best he could with how he was raised. Sam’s upbringing was different because he had
Cas smiled at Dean. It was a barely-there smile that just slightly turned up his lips, but the way it lit up the stunning blue of his eyes more than made up for it. “Of course. I didn’t get your name…?”
house, make fun of
Dean felt himself blush slightly, not expecting Cas to remember that. He kept his eyes firmly on the road. “Yeah, it is. Uh, this might be a weird question, but do you have one? You know, a favorite band, or artist? Do you even listen to music?”
“Hello, Dean.” Cas responded as usual, but he looked particularly tired.
Rowena pulled the ribbon bookmark to the page she was on and closed the book with a snap, feigning innocence. “I just don’t know why you would have a witch as powerful as me wasting away her time rereading
. Castiel only tightened his wings around his body. The feathers were no longer the same silky black that Dean had managed to bring out of them so long ago. They were mangled, missing feathers in multiple places. One ulna bone had been broken completely and hadn’t healed properly because Magnus hadn’t disengaged the warding long enough for it to completely heal. The feathers were now dull and dusty looking, sticking up in odd directions around numerous spots of scar tissue. Dean would be disgusted by these wings. Dean would-
“I’m not going anywhere, Dean…I love you.” And at first Dean choked on trying to say 'I love you' back. He coughed and cleared his throat, terrified that if his clumsiness earlier didn’t mess things up, then this certainly had. But Castiel was all loving, blue eyes. And even though Dean's words didn’t come out smoothly, they came out honestly.
-“ Dean shook his head and pointed at the target. Cas’ shoulders slouched slightly but he reluctantly turned back to the target.
“Dean, no!” Cas’ voice rang out right before the angel’s body collided with Dean’s, sending them spiraling to the ground. Dean flailed beneath Cas, trying to reach for the machete that had flown from his hand. “Dean, stop. It’s over.” Cas growled, pinning both the hunter’s wrists to the dusty, blood-soaked floor of the warehouse.
bad. Cas had forgiven him for so much throughout the years, there was no way in hell he would’ve forgiven Dean for
“I remember him.” Ricardo nodded. “I work most shifts during the day here. I…I can’t tell you much about him, honestly. Some rich guy in his 40’s. He rented a double bed just for a few days. He was talkative and said he was just staying here on business. He was out most of the time, but when usually got back in the afternoon around the time I was getting off. He always went straight for the bar. That’s actually the last place he was seen here. We have some video footage if you want to see it….” He smiled and added “…detective.” with a wink.
He removed the clothing from the upper half of his body, carefully hanging it on the coat rack. He was wearing the hoodie that Dean had gotten him for Christmas, and he could’ve easily removed it using his grace, but he was putting off his return to Heaven. He straightened his shoulders and flexed, causing the massive black wings to manifest and unfurl from his back. Castiel gasped. They were
“Whatever you want, buddy. Here, take the French toast and I’ll grab us some.”
Andrisha laughed. “You’re not from around here, are you? What brings you to Woodward?”
There actually was one guy caught Dean’s interest a little bit. He was kind of nerdy in a hot way, with his thick rimmed glasses, a Zelda shirt, and perpetually messy, blonde hair.  His lip ring was a little much, but Dean liked how he would bite at it and play with it when he blushed after Dean laid on the flirting extra thick. He admitted that he felt like Dean was way out of his league, and that he was surprised that Dean had asked him out. It was one of the few dates that Dean was himself on, nerding out over which super heroes were the best and arguing whether Star Trek or Star Wars was better. Halfway through the date, he realized the guy (Eric? Ethan maybe?) was looking at him as if he were the entire world, completely smitten over the fact that he had landed Dean. It only reminded Dean that
them, he was
in Cas’ eyes. The incredible blue of them was suddenly taken up by so much more pupil that wasn’t there just a moment ago.
Dean chuckled. He was flirting so hard that he didn’t even bother to introduce himself. “I’m Dean. Dean Winchester.”
With Lisa, it was different. He had tried to create a future with her. He knew he was just “playing dad and husband”. He knew it was absurd to think that he could just impose himself in this normal life and hoped it worked. Sam was gone, and Cas was gone, but Lisa and Ben were there. He knew now that they were just poor replacements for what he was missing. Lisa was just someone that was replacing Cas in the sense that she was someone that he loved that he could actually
“It’s still pretty early, but the sun is about to set. I say we go out in my boat. Have you ever been out on the water during sunset? It’s beautiful.”
Dean blinked the sting of saltwater and the grit of sand from his eyes slowly. It barely helped with his vision. Wherever he was trapped was dark, but there was just a sliver of moonlight peeking in from a hole above him, and as he squinted through the darkness, he was able to make out that he was in some sort of cave. He could hear the waves crashing somewhere outside the cavern. Based on how the pool of water he was sitting in was gently sloshing against him and then pulling away, he assumed that the mouth of the cave was connected to the ocean. He took a deep breath and coughed, causing his lungs to seize and splutter. He groaned at the pounding headache he was developing that throbbed in rhythm of the mark’s pulsing. Wondering how long he had been underwater, Dean tried to stand. He almost immediately lost his balance, and stumbled onto his knees, thankful that the sand helped soften the impact. He was getting too old for this shit.
He could hear Cas undressing, but neither of them said a word. Dean kept counting his breaths until they stopped coming out so fast, but he stopped breathing completely when he felt the covers shift and the bed sink in. He fully expected Cas to just roll over and go to sleep, so the arm snaking around his waist and pulling him in almost caused him to yelp. He froze completely, wondering what the hell Cas was doing when he felt a soft kiss just behind his ear, and the gush of breath as Cas sighed.
Castiel didn’t reply at first, but just poked at his food. Sam laughed and handed him a knife and fork before sitting down. “I’m thinking about leaving Heaven. Completely.”
The angel didn’t hide his concerns or suspicions at all and wanted
Cas moved gracefully, dodging many of the Tulpa’s attacks and then ramming his angel blade into any exposed area he could reach. The Tulpa finally caught him, and slammed him to the ground by the throat, and Dean had
Dean wasn’t having trouble staying awake and ran a hand through his hair, wondering if it was just an effect of the Mark. Right as he was about to say something to Cas, the angel’s cell phone rang. Cas took the phone out of his trench coat pocket, his eyebrows tented in confusion as he stared at the screen. “It’s a text message from Ariel. She wants to meet again.”
“I’m referring to her as a ‘she’ because she took a female vessel. She always has in during all the times she returned to earth. I’m not the only angel that grew found of a particular vessel.”
Dean woke up the next day to a throbbing head from the amount of whiskey he had chugged the night before. He winced and rubbed his temples, willing the pain to dull. He heard a knock at the door and groaned in response, tossing an arm over his eyes to shield them from the light he knew would flood in from the hallway as his door creaked open.
. The AC unit is running now but if it shuts off tonight because the room gets too cold, the bed is going to be furnace with you wearing an entire suit in it.” Dean himself was only wearing boxers and a plain black shirt that he often wore under one of his plaid over shirts.
Mia gasped and pulled her knees closer to her chest, muttering about how this was a bad idea while Bethany raised a curious eyebrow at the paper, and Olivia felt the need to pick her jaw up off the floor.
Cas nodded. “He must be interesting if you’ve been texting him all day.” He said sincerely.
Dean slapped his hand down on the counter enthusiastically, practically beaming. “Bring ‘em out.”
Castiel was running his fingers through his primaries when Dean entered the room without warning. “Hey, Cas-“ He froze, the color draining from his face at the sight of Castiel, shirtless and with his wings out. It was so endearing that Dean could still be embarrassed or flustered by something like this, as if Cas hadn’t seen his bare soul. “I, uh, I’m so-sorry, I should’ve knocked-“
Dean didn’t reply again for a moment before calling Cas’ name out again, followed by sleep slurred, unintelligible words, confirming that the oldest Winchester was still asleep. It completely threw Cas off. Dean was completely asleep, and yet he still called out to him, and it wasn’t even because of a nightmare. It was because he was finding comfort in Castiel’s presence, even if it was in his unconscious state. Cas swallowed hard. He wasn’t reasonable enough or strong enough to deprive Dean of this, to deprive
Ross nodded, looking around before reaching in the inside of his loose fitting jacket. Dean almost wanted to roll his eyes at how cliché it was, the whole situation was like something out of a really shitty movie. Ross pulled his hand out of his jacket just enough to expose a little bit of what he was holding. At first, Dean thought it was a plastic bag, but then he realized that it was the plastic from a cigarette pack, burned at the top to seal it off. Inside was a very small amount of white powder.
Claire looked him over for a moment before cautiously stepping forward to give him a hug as well. Cas hugged her back, a little shocked, and when he looked up, Dean was beaming at him encouragingly. “I dig the tie. I’m glad you decided to keep it.” Claire said, smirking at him.
Cas had noticed Dean’s distraction and how Dean was always on his phone. He had picked up on the fact that Dean was spending a lot more time in this room clicking away on the screen than begging the angel to watch some crappy cowboy movie with him. Sam watched him glare at Dean’s phone when Dean was too distracted to answer one of his questions. Sam watched him look at Dean longing when he entered the room to grab something but didn’t even say anything to him. It was only a matter of time before the levee broke.
. It looked no different than the other uninhabited rooms in the bunker. It had the same antique, worn dresser with an attached mirror that had collected dust. Castiel hadn’t bothered to dust or clean anything in the room because he rarely used it. It had the same rickety, broken-in chair that had its fair share of stains and worn fabric. The chair did have a little less dust because there were times that Castiel had sat in it and read, but other than that it was just another carbon copy. His bedroom had the same bed as all the others. The only difference was that his still smelled slightly of
“In the form of carnal pleasure?” Cas raised an eyebrow, causing Dean to choke on his drink.
had happened between Dean and Cas before Cas had up and left. Knowing him being the girl he was, he probably thought Dean proposed to Cas or some shit.
Cas sat down awkwardly in the wicker chair across from Sam on the other side of the coffee table, his hands placed just as stiffly on his knees. He squinted at the coffee table before looking up at Sam and saying “I think it’s a rusalka.”
“What do you want with me? Where’s Dean?” Castiel struggled to stand, but immediately collapsed in on himself again. The magic in the room felt like a physical weight, forcing him down. He could even feel it on his wings.
Dean stumbled out of bed, knocking a half empty beer off his nightstand to the ground. He nearly slipped on the puddle of beer as he made his way to the door, gasping and choking. He clutched at his chest, his fingers crawling at his shirt because everything felt too tight, too hot and constricting. His heart was beating against his chest painfully, he was sure his ribs were going to splinter. He felt the sweat beading at his temple as he tried to choke air into his lungs, floundering to the door and ripping it open. He needed to get outside. He needed air. He needed to
about the mark that could help them remove it since Rowena had escaped, and there had been absolutely no sign of her or the book. The spell she had used had temporarily “reset” the way that the mark had been making him feel, but seeing the Tulpa attack the two people he loved the most? Dean almost lost it. He was able to pull himself back from the brink better than he had when he had attacked Cas, but even as he helped stumble-carry Sam to the car, he could still feel the mark pushing him, wanting him to kill. Dean had accepted that there wasn’t a cure for this, and that’s what terrified him. He knew Sam and Cas wouldn’t give up, and he was still beyond pissed that they were doing shit behind his back, shit that
Dean laughed shakily, trying not to think about the searing pain coming from the mark of Cain on his forearm. “A lot better now that you’re here. Where’s Sam?”
. It wasn’t like the touch Castiel had experienced because of humans. It was something he had realized the first time Dean had hugged him. Humans liked touch. It could console, reassure, please. And slowly but surely, as an angel, Cas had learned when touch was appropriate, and picked up on the social graces of humanity when it came to touch. He finally understood why humans exchanged the contact, and while he didn’t experience it himself, he partook in it.
to deal with.
Sam sighed, “We’re going to have to ask Molly where she’s buried, Dean. It’s almost dark. What if she attacks again tonight?”
When Dean returned from the restroom, he glanced around for Todd for a moment, but seemed slightly relieved that he wasn’t there. “Hey, man. Where did Todd go?”
“Well, we gotta change that.” Dean motioned for Cas to follow him to his car. “Just don’t say anything bad about my driving, or I’m kicking you out of the car. While it’s still moving.”
Feeling the all too familiar feeling of guilt, Dean finished off the bottle. He had to try, even if Castiel didn’t show up. Sam’s life could depend on it. He tossed the bottle, watching its glass shatter against the dewy ground.
"Stop." Dean interrupted. "Just go get Eileen. I'm fine. Just go."
. He wanted to feel what those muscles felt like under his fingertips. He wanted to know what Dean’s hands felt like on him. This impulse had gotten a lot worse ever since the dream that Dean had while lying in bed with Castiel. Now Cas knew what Dean was like when he was aroused and longing. He knew what Dean’s voice sounded like when he said his given nickname while his voice was rough with sex. He swallowed and looked back down at his potatoes right before almost slicing open a finger. He had been thinking about the nature of his thoughts and feelings towards Dean a lot since he had moved into the bunker. The impulses and the thoughts weren’t new. Cas had changed a lot in his time on earth, his desires had changed a lot along with his priorities. The angels never failed to remind him that he always chose Dean, remind him that the human meant far too much to him. It didn’t matter what the situation was or what the consequences were, he always chose Dean. The most compelling part of that was that Cas never felt guilty. He never regretted choosing Dean. He never felt culpable for wanting Dean’s touch and attention, for wanting to keep the human alive at all costs.
me touch them-“
. At first things had been a
The Winchesters were back to staying at cheap, seedy hotels, but Dean couldn’t care any less. He flopped down on the stained, springy bed fully clothes, and immediately closed his eyes. He inhaled deeply but immediately regretted it, his nostrils filling with the scent of dust, and stale cigarettes, regardless of the no smoking sign on the outside door.
Cas’ lips quirked up. “According to Tom at Sunshine and Serenity, both of those products are very good at maintaining hair health and volume.” He said, pleased with himself.
Dean swallowed roughly and took a sip of his drink before continuing. “I was talking to Eileen and she said that the rumor in the Farmer’s Market community-“ Sam rolled his eyes. “-is that the guy has never had that much honey or sold that much in one given weekend. I get that they’re
“Still no sign of Rowena. But we haven’t covered the inventory part of the library in awhile and I was going to hit the books.”
“Guilty?” Dean suggested.
you’re in love with him, Dean.”
He was Dean fucking Winchester, and he wasn’t about to quit, about to kill himself. But it hurt. Everything hurt. And he wasn’t strong enough to do it alone, wasn’t weak enough to go someone as unsympathetic as his father, and wasn’t selfish enough to pick up and call Sam. But he was drowning. And despite how much air he gasped into his lungs, it was only met by sobs that shook his entire body, and pain like he had never felt before. He could deal with concussions. Being sliced open by a werewolf or chewed on by a vampire hurt, but it was bearable. Anything hunting had to throw at him, Dean could handle. But this? This was different.
Vera laughed and turned her seat around, smiling up at Dean as he approached her. He smiled down at her, returning a smile at how effortless this evening at been with her. He hadn’t thought about Cas once, and of course this thought reminded him of Cas and his smile dropped. As effortless as this date had been, and as much as he liked Vera, she certainly didn’t give him the same feeling that Cas did. It wasn’t like he had expected her to, this was the first day he had even known Vera, and Cas… well, he was in love with Cas. This date had felt fun, but Cas made anywhere Dean was with him feel like home.
“Yeah, and we can do all those things as
. “Or… not.” Dean added when he didn’t reply. “Talk to me, man. Are you okay? What can I do?”
“Are you really thinking about food right after you inhaled an entire plate of fries and a sandwich?” Cas asked, sounding both skeptical and amused.
Sam smirked at him. “On that show don’t you have to be attracted to the vampire for glamouring to work?”
“You seem like you’re having fun, Cas.” Dean said, an easy smile on his face when he approached the two of them, glancing at the employee’s nametag to find that his name was Tom. Dean was expecting a name a little more free-spirited. Tom gave him a nod in acknowledgment.
The inner flesh of Dean’s arm where his forearm met his bicep was littered with little, angry red dots.  Castiel cautiously dragged his index finger over them as the gears began grinding in his head. He had been so panicked, so terrified of finding Dean in such a bad state that he hadn’t even allowed his brain to process what could have possibly caused it. The little red marks where the home of injection sites. Dean had been doing drugs.
“No, Adam was loved by everyone. Of course there were the occasional people that didn’t agree with his, uh, ‘lifestyle-“
“The longer you use the app, the more likely you are to match with someone.” Sam suggested, having to immediately hide his smile by taking a sip of water from his glass. Cas was practically fidgeting in his seat. Who would have thought Cas was the jealous type? “We should go out tonight.” He added. “I checked for cases this morning and it was a bust. Everything that came up was way too far out of the way, so I called who I could and contacted Jody or Garth for the rest.” He shrugged. “Let’s go shoot some pool or somethin’.”
back from her, even if they had to pry it from her lifeless fingers. Sam would want to keep it. But the moment he let his guard down, Dean planned on burning it. Charlie was dead because of that thing.
“Oh, c’mon!” Dean’s annoyed voice rang out through the crowd to Sam’s left, and Sam made his way through the crowd to his upset brother.
The hunter just shook his head. His restlessness wasn’t something that was immune to being fixed by a little while on Busty Asian Beauties website. He locked his bedroom door behind him, and quickly stripped down to his his boxers before grabbing his laptop. He flopped down on his bed, placing the laptop on his left side on the bed. He leaned over, opening his nightstand drawer and pulling out a bottle of lube. Dean Winchester wasn’t a diva about many things, but when it came to using lube versus lotion, he would be a diva every single time. Lotion dried too quickly, and sometimes he wanted to do things nice and slow because it wasn’t every day that he had ‘me’ time.
Regardless, Dean was slowly warming up to the idea when Cas brushed by him on the way to the bunker’s door, nonchalantly announcing his leave.
Cas fiddled with the label on his beer bottle. He only ever drank to humor Dean and would probably end up babysitting two beers over the entirety of the night. “Do you remember the case we had in Quantico?” Cas asked quietly.
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean responded dismissively, even though he completely agreed with Sam. He tore into his gift like a toddler, grinning when the wrapping paper finally fell away to reveal a massive car care kit that included everything from a waxing kit to carpet cleaner.
“Of course. Kevin said it’s over on Hollowell street.”
It didn’t take Dean long of freaking out before he caved and turned to the Djinn essence for some moral support. He went to sleep that night no longer freaking out about Christmas gifts, and dreamt of drowning in a vast, beautiful ocean, but for some reason, he wasn’t afraid.
Sam slung his two duffle bags over one shoulder and hesitated before saying “Uh, actually, I was gonna head that way by myself. I can meet you and Cas back at the bunker.”
“About this hug or your panic attack?”
“No, I get it, Cas. It’s fine. You gotta go get all juiced up and shit again. That means you gotta go to Heaven. And hey, I’m sure you could stop by and see Ariel while you’re at it!” Dean knew he was being bratty and weird, but that panic he had been worrying about was starting to sink in. With the lights blown out, he was too far away from Cas to be able to see his facial expression, but he could see the outline of the hardset of Cas’ shoulders. He ripped the sheets back with way too much aggression and crawled into bed, squeezing his eyes shut so hard it gave him a headache.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re making a mistake.” Sam tried hopelessly.
“Are you alright?” he asked, noticing that Dean was buttoning his pants up and was unable to stop himself from tracking the movement with his eyes.
The bedroom door opened and Cas stumbled out, his hair in complete disarray as he rubbed his eyes sleepily. Dean’s stomach flipped at the sight, and tried to convince himself that it wasn’t the feeling people described as butterflies. “Hey, buddy. How ya feeling?”
Dean didn’t even know Jay had returned until he awkwardly cleared his throat. Both Cas and Dean were so startled that they jumped, and Dean had to pull back immediately because that was all sorts of friction against his dick that he absolutely didn’t need while pressed against Cas like that. “Sorry to interrupt. I was just letting you know that Carey and I are heading out. She had a little too much to drink and feels like she’s going to be sick so I’m taking her home.” He shook his head. “Tonight, of all nights, right?” He chuckled, and Dean laughed with him, even though he had no idea what Jay was talking about.
“No, uh, I just finished wrapping up a case with Dean and Cas. Everything okay?” Sam was pointedly not looking at Dean, despite Dean trying his hardest to get his attention making sexual hand gestures.
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. "Look kid, I know you're the new god in town or whatever. And you wanted to be hands off. I get that you don't want to be like Chuck. But you've brought back everyone. Everyone except for-" Dean swallowed hard and blinked. "Everyone except for Cas. That doesn't sound hands off to me."
and he just needed the mark to shut the fuck and needed to stop thinking for five seconds. This time, the affects weren’t immediate, and Dean panicked. He stared at the empty syringe in confusion. Every other time, he had felt different, felt lighter, once he had emptied the syringe into his vein. Was it because it was building up a tolerance? Or because he had gone three days without it, and the mark was so angry after his last hunt? What if it stopped working completely when they were no closer to finding a cure? What if he hurt someone? What if he
Dean felt a slight shift in the table and Sam moved closer to him to lean against it. “I can’t tell you that Dean. I
love with him, but I definitely love him. I worry about him a lot. Sometimes he thinks he can take on things completely by himself and I wish he would just call me, so I could help him with the hunt. But he always tells me I would be a distraction.” She didn’t fight the smile that formed on her lips. ”But Jody is really over protective, and I feel like I should tell her, but if she doesn’t like him…” She shook her head, finally meeting Cas’ gaze again. “Alex just keeps telling me to go for it. She said that he reminds her a lot of Dean- which is fucking gross- but she said that Jody will love him as long as I’m safe. I just know that she’s going to completely grill him the first time they meet.”
