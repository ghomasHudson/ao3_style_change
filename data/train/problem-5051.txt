Steve hadn't hesitated. As soon as Tony had been bludgeoned overboard with a sickening thwack, by the tail of the serpent, Steve had slapped the shield onto his back and had dove in after him. Even though the monster was obviously dead, thanks to the self sacrificing, irresponsible idiot he was now trying to find in the murky water, he'd seen Tony's eyes roll up before he even got hit, so he knew the man wouldn't be able to swim. The visibility was crap and he had no clue if Tony was still holding onto the armor's gauntlet and therefore sinking fast or if he'd still be relatively close to the surface. The air was burning in Steve's lungs but he didn't bother going up for air. If he could survive 70 years without breathing while stuck in ice, he could survive fifteen minutes without air in water.
"Forever," stated Tony decisively. "Huh. I never thought of it like that. The way he talked about you, I could have sworn... But I guess I would say the same things about the armor or JARVIS if they were lost to me." He went back to scraping his branch and Steve got a new one out of the fire. They worked in companionable silence for a while. Percival was snoring softly on the other side of the fire. Tony shivered once, but kept working.
Tony laughed for the first time in weeks. He did remember that. They had all given Bruce a wide berth for ages. It was good to know this let down was a normal reaction.
“Jump, Steve.” It was as if Tony had whispered it directly into his ear. Goosebumps ran down Steve’s arms. Steve slid one hand up Tony’s back and Tony came forward without resistance. With his heart hammering in his chest, Steve leaned forward and kissed him. Tony’s lips opened eagerly under his and effortlessly, his tongue slid into his mouth. Tony’s arms slid around his neck and with a small moan Steve pulled him flush against his body. He reveled in the feel of Tony in his arms, Tony’s fingers in his hair, Tony’s scent in his nose. He couldn’t believe this was happening, couldn’t believe Tony was letting him kiss him, was kissing him back as if he wanted Steve just as much as Steve wanted him.
“You’re leaving, then?” Tony stomped down on a sinking feeling of disappointment. It’d been nice, hanging out with Steve. Really nice.
. He'd made sketches of Tony at work, and he'd worked out, which had been completely distracting and sex had been inevitable after watching him do a zillion push ups with no shirt on. He'd made sure Tony was fed at regular intervals, he had listened to Tony rant with apparently infinite patience and had made sensible suggestions now and then, which showed that he was actually listening and could tell when Tony went off on unrealistic tangents. Now, standing next to him at the railing Tony realized he wanted this. This closeness and familiarity. This sense of Steve being by his side and staying there, because he belonged with him. Belonged to Tony. It was crazy, but somehow not as crazy as it had seemed even just a day ago.
Tony had taken a shower himself and changed out of his spunky T-shirt and was busy being disappointed by the contents of the fridge, when Steve entered the kitchen in snug sweatpants and a snugger T-shirt. And freshly shaven.
"Keep dancing. Don't act suspicious. We'll go by again." Steve waltzed an illegal u-turn that earned them a frown from Antonio and steered them by the doors again. Yep. That was definitely the right fellow. And he was looking at them. Steve gave him a friendly smile. Couldn't hurt. They went around the room again, cutting a few corners, but next time they went by the doors the man was gone. Tony struggled again, but he wasn't as strong as Steve.
"Alright then. You asked. See, Steve has this uniform from the forties. Looks reeeaaal good on him, you know. And when he wears it to bed, he's insists on proper - " Tony's mouth was suddenly covered by Steve's hand and he only caught a quick glance of Steve's blush before his head was unceremoniously pinned under Steve's arm.
Tony repeats himself, hotly breathing the words into his ear. The intimacy is devastating. Steve tries to say stop. He really does. But when Tony's hand slides down with his fingertip stopping just barely under the waistband of his pants, what comes out is a croaking “Please.” He doesn't even know what he is asking for. For Tony to stop or for Tony to do...
So, he leaves early and heads over the bridge. Unfortunately, group time seems to have changed and there’s just a few guys left in the hallway who are on their way out. He doesn't see Sam. Maybe Sam doesn't even do the groups anymore. He feels ashamed now, of the way he ghosted the man until he stopped calling and that's bewildering: how it feels now like he did Sam wrong while at the time it felt like he was saving Sam from the burden of his own company.
His thoughts went around the same circle several hundred times, until he got so fed up with himself that they finally settled in a grey funk that persisted until the storm broke loose. He made his way home amid the groups squealing students that were caught out in the rain with him. Lightning cracked across the sky as he opened his front door. He toweled his hair dry and peeled off his clothes. Leaving them in a sodden heap on his bedroom floor he sat down at his computer and started to write a scathing dissection of the current state of research in his field.
"Stark, you have access to the same files as I do, don't even try to tell me you don't. Just because you avoid your old man's stuff like the plague doesn't make it my duty to point out when you're wearing blinders. You could have known and you chose not to. Tough fucking shit." Fury's was flatter and colder.
Tony's tale trailed off into silence and for a while neither of them said anything. The fire crackled and threw odd shapes over Tony's face, obscuring his emotions. The wind whispered in the grass and an owl was hooting not too far off. Neither of them was still working on the charcoal. Finally, Steve deemed it safe to speak.
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. "Morgaine, please. I know you were worried about me, but I have a massive headache right now."
“That isn't justice! You killed them for your own glory and pride. What about these women they victimized, did they not deserve to see justice done?”
"Steve, it isn't that I don't want you on the team. You'd be perfect. It's. It's just. You and me, it'd never work. You haven't seen me at my worst. You have no idea what you're getting into. I'm rude and obnoxious, I don't know how to deal with problems that can't be solved by building something or throwing money at it, I hide in my workshop because I am emotionally constipated, I don't eat, sleep or shower and then take things out on everyone else, I can't follow orders to save my life. Literally. I drive people nuts, Steve. I am a nightmare to put up with. It'd never work, you'd get sick of me so fast and then then whole situation would be... horrible." Tony had been staring at his hands the entire time he spoke. If he'd looked at Steve he'd never had been able to say anything except
"Tony is angry with me." Steve didn't know why he was even talking to a complete stranger about Tony, except that it felt like such a relief to talk about him. To talk to somebody who knew him. He suddenly felt starved for information.
“Nah-ah,” admonishes Tony, using his knees to spread Steve's legs a little wider and even that stretch feels good, as if Steve is even more open, even more helpless now. Then Tony slides in in one fell swoop and Steve drops his head on his forearms and keens. The feeling of Tony inside him is at once overwhelming and grounding and so very, very good. He can't believe he hasn't done this in way too many years, can't even recall the last time he had anyone's dick up his ass, but he knows it can't have felt like this or he would have remembered it.
“Nothing. Just thinking about how you'd react if I took pity on the poor princess's aching feet and carried you off the ice, bridal style.”
Once they hit the hallway, after exiting the bar, Tony turned on Steve at the same time Steve turned on him.
"Sounds like a sound strategy, Iron Man." Steve said with a smile, and it was a little weird because Tony was fairly sure Steve had smiled more at him in the last 12 hours than in all the time he had known him. Combined. And he had to stamp on a fledgling preen that threatened to rear its head. Because that felt a little like the approval seeking behavior and Tony Stark had not sought anyone's approval since his teens. Especially not from anyone of his father's generation, which Steve technically was. The idea alone was ridiculous.
"Natasha. Natalie. Brigitte. Which one of your names should I use? You have so many more than I ever knew. Good to see you, by the way."
"What are you doing?" He spoke softly, not wanting to wake Percival on the other side of the fire before the man had to get up for last watch.
“Happy will be pleased to take the motorcycle in, Master Stark. I’d like to inform you that Master Thistlethwaite is waiting for you in the parlor and I believe Pepper has some paperwork you will need to sign.”
“Yeah, sure, but, you know, crippling jet lag. We like to stay in the first couple of days whenever we cruise in Europe.” This got a chorus of agreement and a full 15 minutes of jet lag one-upmanship, complaints about general insomnia and then the discussion veered off into fascinating tales of various aches and ailments all around the table. Tony had not had a minute of jet lag in his life, thanks to his irregular sleeping habits, but he could bullshit with the best of them.
hand knitted jumper. In Gryffindor red with a gold S on it. Sam had given it him for Christmas three years ago, before Steve had hit his growth spurt. Even with expansion charms it couldn’t possibly fit Steve’s current frame, but he hadn’t wanted to toss it out, because, you know, it was a Real Molly Weasley
“Captain Rogers, that is not my decision to make. You can take it up with your superiors of course, but I think it would not look good on your record.” Rogers shuttered his face and didn't even salute when he left the room. Tony leaned back in his chair and squinted at Fury.
"I am not going to be an engineer," the kid scoffed right back. "I am going to be a geneticist and create griffins!"
"I rode my bike in! It's better than going in with just jeans and a T-shirt!" Steve yelled right back.
Tony sighed heavily, because that was always effective. It was giving in. He knew it, Fury knew it, and judging by the tiny smirk he sported the fucker was enjoying the shit out of it.
"They were unarmed," Steve said angrily. “Killing unarmed men is not heroic. You should have captured them to face a fair trial.”
Tony embarked on a lengthy spiel about his own delightful family dynamics and how he’d ended up in Delft and Steve listened quietly. He got less tense by the minute though, so Tony made sure to dredge up plenty of details to stretch his tale. When he finally wound down, they were both kind of melted into the couch and Tony suppressed a yawn. Steve yawned too.
Steve got more water from the rain barrel and used it to carefully wipe away the salt and grime on Tony's body and he rinsed his hair. Then he washed himself and their clothes and he cooked some of the grains that were left in a jar on one of the storage shelves into a mush that Tony refused to eat no matter how much Captain America Steve put into his voice. So he made Tony more tea and ate the mush himself.
"Right-o. Here's the thing, Mr Bell. I am going to need to see the last three reports that were sent."
"Uhuh. I have hard time picturing you even eating any oatmeal at any point in your life, to be honest. I imagine you being weaned on caviar and champagne."
"I think this ended very well," said Steve, "I'd like to say Sir Percival and I had it in hand, but I don't think that was true." Percival nodded.
Tony's tactic of waving a great big flag with 'I am here! Come find me!' on it, and counting on the word to spread and reach Steve, seemed particularly suited to a one man search party that just couldn't cover the entire country by himself. Of course, the 'lookit me!' approach was eminently suited to Tony's personality, so maybe that just had been his default strategy. Whichever it was, it had worked and Steve was going to go on the assumption that it was just Tony. Now he just had to figure out where the man's home base was. Tony hadn't thoughtfully provided him with a map, but given the scarcity of parchment, it wasn't very surprising. Steve would have to go by word of mouth. It wasn't like people wouldn't recall seeing a red and gold flying demon.
"I cannot access my databases, either, Sir." JARVIS sounded mournful. "I only have the actual data you've uploaded to the suit." The way he said it, Tony had a sense he might possibly come to regret deleting a bunch of data to make room for the entire StarkTunes music library recently. It had been an emergency, of course. He'd been stuck on a long boring Avengers mission without a particularly obscure Black Sabbath bootleg he was jonesing to hear, and the experience had been so traumatic, he'd had to make sure that would never, ever happen again. Still. Now he was wondering what he had decided to delete. And if it would be relevant in his current situation.
"Yep. Crystal clear. You got it. Not spending Christmas alone. But why are we cooking? I can't even make Ramen noodles. Really, J.A.R.V.I.S. has some excellent caterers on speed dial. I'd be happy to order whatever we want. How about a buffet? I like buffets. Who doesn't like buffets? Just give J.A.R.V.I.S. a list and-"
"You've become part of a bigger universe, Mr Stark. You just don't know it yet...." And with that Fury launched into a spiel about the so called Avengers Initiative, which sounded like something out of Tony's nightmares, full of teamwork and responsibility and accountability and camaraderie. But he kept expecting Steve to jump up and shout "Me! Pick me!" It would be perfect for the man with the overdeveloped need to protect all of humanity from evildoers. But Steve said nothing and Tony politely declined the offer, because he really wasn't a team player and he sure as hell wasn't going to take orders from guys in black leather trench coats. There were special clubs for that kind of thing, where everything was safe, sane and consensual, if he ever felt that need. And maybe he shouldn't have said that last part out loud, but what was done was done and Fury got to make a pissy dramatic exit and Tony thought the man might secretly enjoy that.
Fury actually chuckled at that, the asshole. "It is. That's why you're coming back to the Avengers, by the way."
“Steve, you’ve met Bruce and Natasha. The big one is Thor and the mean one is Clint. Guys, this is Steve. He is staying for dinner.”
Before Steve realizes what is happening, Tony has slid to knees and uncovered Steve's cock. The cool nighttime air does nothing to cool the feverish heat that has pooled in his groin. Tony looks up at him, his eyes invisible in the shade of the sockets and Steve looks back, certain he looks utterly ridiculous, his eyes as wide as saucers and his hands scrabbling faintly at the wall. He can't believe what's happening. Tony can't mean... Tony isn't going to...
It had been quite a shock when the vet had told them the day before. Not only that he had misgendered Stevie, but really, five cats were plenty and now he was going to have even more. The coaster had rolled all the way under Clint’s chair and he had to use his foot to drag it closer before he could pick it up. When he finally resurfaced with it everyone was staring at Steve and Steve was giving Tony looks of a very not amused quality. Tony replayed in his head what he had said.
“Why does he speak for you? Why do you not know our language? Are you a Viking? You don't look like a Viking. Your color is wrong and you're not so large. Are you-”
“I gotta. I need the money.” He glanced over quickly and then away again. “I could come back in a few days, though?”
Thistlethwaite was a disapproving older man with an elegant mustache who radiated a air of being extremely inconvenienced, yet flattered. He dismissed Steve on sight, at least as far as making any decisions about his attire went. Within a couple of minutes he and Tony were in a heated discussion about silhouettes, fabrics, shades, button holes and seam widths. Among several hundred other things that were apparently important. Steve busied himself with drinking numerous cups of tea out of china so fragile looking he considered levitating the cup to his mouth so he wouldn’t risk crushing it by accident.
"Oh, sure," said Tony, "That must be it. None of our concern then. Let's just go back to the party. Wanna dance, Clint? I can Waltz now. I'll even let you lead."
The trial lasted three months. Three whole fucking months. On Elisa's advice he laid relatively low and only went out a few times with an obviously female companion. Darcy Lewis, Jane Foster's assistant, was more than happy to help a guy out if it involved new clothes and expensive food.
He'd stayed put on the island for as long as he could, because he remembered his mother's adage 'When you are lost, stay where you are, so I can find you', but after a few days his stomach had forced him to leave the island and find food. That's when he had found out how truly and utterly lost he was. For the second time in two years he was a man out of time.
Tony turned around slowly, so he was leaning with his back against the railing. Now he could look Steve in the face.
“Oh, come on! You had enough on your plate and it’s not like you could help. If I couldn’t fix it, I thought nobody could fix it, so I was giving you a clean break and all that shit… I thought it was very noble of me at the time, actually.”
Steve pondered this and then conceded the point. "If they want to talk they can find us on the boat easily, nothing good can come from meeting them off the boat."
wake up. He looked so fucking fragile and beat up, pale even in the firelight. With a shuddering breath he pulled himself together. He hung his own clothes next to Tony's. He really should have rinsed the salt out of them before he did so, but the pull of exhaustion was too strong. He carefully laid himself next to Tony, making sure not to jostle him and fell asleep instantly.
“Okay, that’s settled,” Pepper butted it. “Happy will pick you up in an hour. Be showered, caffeinated and dressed. Captain Rogers, I have been so free to bring something suitable to wear for you and I will have to brief you about modern press conferences.” She tugged Steve along and Tony watched them go, already feeling bereft. By the door she looked back at Tony.
"Yeah you do," Tony barreled on. "For Fury, you do. Pretend you're kissing his ass or something." Steve didn't think he'd ever seen a stupider picture than the one Tony eventually sent to Fury with both of them cheek to cheek making kissy faces at the camera with the Colosseum behind them. Tony captioned it: "Blissful. You?" Steve kind of wished he had a copy of it.
And then the trial ended, but it didn't end. They won, and Steve was free to go and he did. But he didn't come to Tony.
He brought his arm up and ripped the damned shirt off his head. He almost cursed out loud when he saw Tony had stopped mid change to assist him and was also shirtless. Tony's back muscles rippled as he worked his tongue over the little barbell and then slid his mouth up towards Steve's neck. Steve had an excellent view of the swell of Tony's ass disappearing into the waistband of his dark grey slacks. He closed his eyes and pulled his head back but that only made him more aware of what Tony's tongue was doing to his neck, that Tony now had full access to. Holy cow, how was he supposed to
And they abruptly came to an end when Tony finally eased the bike down onto the lawn of a manor so fucking fancy that Steve knew instantly he was in way, way over his head.
“Very well, Sir. Shall I add some appropriate shrieks to the translation? Perhaps I ought to impersonate you doing the Macarena while inebriated?”
"Right. One! Two! Five!" And he swung the lamp overhead. It sailed in a perfect arc towards its goal. The nuking of the Chitauri motherhip would always be Tony's favorite hit, but this was satisfying in a supremely visceral way. The resounding thwack when the lamp hit the undead creature in the small of the back was immediately followed by the whoosh that accompanied a pillar of flame and then some godawful screeching as the thing was apparently dragged straight to hell. It was awesome. He pumped his fist in the air. Steve and Percival scrambled back and then came over to stand with Tony to watch it burn.
Tony dropped the thesaurus on his foot and barely managed to grab the phone before it could follow the thesaurus.
Steve got up and came back with a box lined with an old towel for Eve, as he insisted on calling the cat. They had bickered about it for days, but neither of them had scored a decisive victory, so now the cat had two names. They put the box in a quiet corner of the living room, but Stevie had other ideas and after the third time in two days that she had dragged all her kittens, one by one, to Tony’s sock drawer, they just left her there. Tony could always buy new socks.
"So. What's next, do you think? You gonna go back in the army? Fight with the boys in Afghanistan? Or should we present you to the public first? Hey! You could be part of the Stark expo! That'd be a hit. Or, I can introduce you to this senatorial committee that wants to see me. And while we're at it, you could let them know how ridiculous it is they're even asking for the Iron Man armor. It's not like they'd ever ask you to hand over your shield. Or-"
“Only because I have been programmed by one,” said JARVIS in a distinctly less friendly tone of voice.
Tony poked at the artificial hand, causing Bucky to jerk from the shoulder. It must go all the way up then.
"As long as we're sharing," said Natasha with a small smile, "I am Russian Orthodox and all we need is vodka to make it a holiday. Any holiday. But not any vodka. None of that horse piss they drink over here."
"I don't think we have to worry about the ceiling height in the tower, " said Steve. "Let's go with the Noble Fir. How about that one?" He pointed to a tree that looked identical to all the other trees as far as Tony was concerned at this particular point in time, so Tony nodded silently. Whatever. He shoved his hands back in his pockets to stop himself from touching his nose in wonder.
He gently dislodged Tasha and deposited her on the warm spot his ass left on the couch when he stood up. She didn’t even budge. Then he freed Steve from Clint and Thor and piled all the cats in a furry heap. They seemed fine with that arrangement. Steve watched him intently while Tony dug some clean pajama pants out of his dresser drawer.
He gets to the Safeway at the worst possible time, right in the middle of the oh-shit-we-need-something-for-dinner-crowd. It doesn't matter. The hustle and bustle flows right by him as if he isn't even there. He picks up a box of pasta, then puts it back down. He heads for the produce section.
"Tony," he started, and his tone of voice must have given away his trepidation, because Tony barely looked up from his work, suspiciously regarding Steve through his lashes. "You don't have to answer, but I really wonder... Nobody could or would give me any particulars and all I ever got was 'He changed', but... What happened to Howard? How did he go from the decent guy I knew to somebody that nobody wants to talk about? I mean, I wouldn't have pegged him for father of the year material, really, but was he really all that bad?"
Steve made an exasperated little noise in the back of his throat and the next moment they were kissing. It started as a 'shut the fuck up, please' kiss, with too much pressure that implied punishment rather than passion. It was equal parts anger and and equal parts 'thank fuck you didn't die' and Tony knew in his bones that if he let it be that way, if Steve broke the kiss before Tony could convince him that that wasn't all it was, then this would be all they would ever have. Then Steve would pull back and shutter his face and then they would be even less than friends from then on. And that was so not on.
"Are we in a relationship?" Steve sounded a little stunned. Why the hell was he surprised? He was the one who had started it with all the touching and the kissing and making Tony fall for him.
"Oh look, Antonio Banderas is in charge, " Tony whispered, nodding to the Hispanic man with long wavy hair who was currently welcoming everyone, "That is a bit of a cliché." Steve knew better than to say 'who? 'or 'what?
Then, seemingly addressing the stars, Tony said softly: “I guess deep down he loved me anyway. A couple of years ago I found this film that he had recorded when I was young in which he said I was his greatest creation.”
And that was how three Avengers ended up freezing their asses off on the top of Stark tower watching Falcon whooping and doing loop-de-loops over the city's Christmas light displays. It was the weirdest start of the holiday season that Tony could remember. Not the worst, though. Not the worst.
.” The man sounded genuinely surprised. Which meant Steve hadn't said anything to him. Well, this was just getting better and better.
“Sir Percival, your mother was a wise and compassionate woman. Let's go inside and determine what needs to be done.”
He pulled back abruptly. Tony looked at him, questioningly, his lips swollen and red and it was the hardest thing not to kiss him again, immediately. Softly this time, maybe. But-
Tony almost choked on his coffee before he realized she probably meant Bruce and Steve were her friends, not him. Whatever. Good for her. Bruce helpfully patted him on the back, then turned his attention to Steve.
He hadn't even noticed he had started to lower his head, when a full body shiver went through Tony, and not in an excited kind of way. His breath started to wheeze and Steve threw himself off Tony with alacrity. Jesus, of all the stupid things he'd done... he was way too heavy to lie on top of Tony like that.
Steve wondered how long Tony had been here in the Middle Ages and how he was getting on. The damage Tony could do here was astronomical if the man was unchecked. On the other hand, he wouldn't have the limitless resources he had at home. Still, Steve would be a lot happier if he himself was close by to keep an eye on Tony. To make sure he wasn't doing anything stupidly reckless. Ah, who was he kidding? As long as Tony got him out of here he could overlook a whole lot of stupid recklessness. And he didn't doubt for a second that Tony could get them out. And that the end would justify the means. Somewhat.
year's KENZO swimwear?” Pouty princess went extremely pouty at that point, but was apparently smart enough to know a lost cause when she saw one and beat a retreat. Tony guided Steve back to the lounge with a hand on his ass, just in case she was watching. She was. And boy did that feel good. Steve's ass too.
came on and everyone shut up. Somehow Tony had ended up next to Steve and he spent most of the evening being viscerally, painfully, aware of the two inches of air between them. They talked occasionally, Tony pointing out some of the less obvious connections between the seemingly random group of people in the movie and Steve asking the odd question or two about general history. At some point, Clint on Steve's other side jostled him and Steve's knee fell against Tony's thigh. He left it there. It kept sending little jolts of electricity through Tony, but he he didn't move his leg either. He'd rather have cut off an arm.
"Superior genes," suggested Steve smugly, "I might not ever get gray hair." This set Tony off on a long and spluttering rant that Steve only half listened to. He smiled to himself as they pounded the ship's running track, the pace very slow for Steve, but he'd been ordered to keep his identity a secret so this slow jog was all he was allowed right now. Tony was getting a workout, though, it wasn't slow for normal people. The sun was just coming up and there was barely a soul in sight. The whole garish atmosphere on board was muted somehow. These last few days had been surreal, to say the least. Like a Dali painting. Or like Dorothy arriving in Oz. Except he wasn't looking for a way back home anymore, not really, more like he was looking for something to fill the emptiness of his new life. He was the Tin Man, then. He snorted when he realized the running track was an ugly mustard yellow.
"Yeah?" Tony pulled himself out of his visions of technical nirvana to throw Steve a questioning look. "So...?" Steve looked back with a slight frown. "Oh! You morally object to electrocuting minors! Of course. Yes. My bad. But I think we can safely assume that Hydra won't send any children after us, right? And
Steve groans. But it somehow helps to know what the plan is. The fear of flying into a panic recedes somewhat and the experience of getting nailed by Tony goes back to 'amazing'. Still, he's sobbing with need by the time Tony's relentless rhythm starts stuttering and Steve can feel the man's cock pulsing in his ass. It's almost enough for him to come untouched,
“Couple of months ago they interviewed Obadiah Stane about the future of the weapons industry and S.I. He mentioned you coming of age and reaching out several times, but apparently you are lost in ‘personal pursuits in Europe with the money you inherited’. So  S.I. was going to look into officially removing you from the company. You didn’t know this?”
“Oh, he probably likes it, but he doesn’t want his father to think he does, so he won’t get cut out of the family’s potion business. See, that is his father over there, in almost identical robes. I bet our friend has fun in all kinds of unsavory ways on the sly, though.”
“None of these ladies gave up their virtue willingly!” exclaimed the lady at the center of the group on the stairs. “It was those depraved sinners who forced them. It is not fair of you to judge them for it." Some of the younger women huddled closer together as she spoke, one was crying softly. The slightly older ones looked mostly pissed off.
And yet it wasn't surprising to find himself on his knees 30 minutes later with Steve pounding into him like he was never, ever going to stop. Steve was a little larger than Tony normally preferred, but even that seemed right, at this particular moment. And Tony felt a grim sense of satisfaction at being Steve's first, even as he was being fucked to within an inch of his life. It was not at all a pretty feeling and utterly selfish, but the idea that Steve would never completely forget him made him push back onto Steve's dick a little harder. Shit, he was going to lose it, it was too fucking perfect.
"Exactly." Steve's smile was a little less wobbly. "I lit some candles for people that are gone and I sat and listened to the music and just allowed myself to miss them." He gave a little huff. "I lit one for your dad... It's weird, Tony. You're so different, yet so alike. Lately I miss him the least, because you are more than filling the hole he left and I think we're closer than he and I ever were. But then I feel like I am betraying his memory by replacing him with you. I feel that way about so many people."
"To Malibu?! That'll take hours. And you're in your shirtsleeves." Tony gestured to Steve's suit pants and button down. "You'll freeze to death!"
Steve flicked his eyes away and cleared his throat. Tugging the ends of the scarf in place he said: "Right. Okay. Let's get this tree home then, shall we?"
“Close enough,” muttered Tony, loud enough for everyone to hear. Everybody knew that the late Howard and Maria Stark had left a very substantial sum to Hogwarts, School of Wizardry. Not that it had made a dent in the fortune they had left their only child. Tony overtook Steve with a swift and sinuous sidestep and cast him a quick look over his shoulder.
Jesus fucking God. Natasha had been right!  Tony jack knifed up to sitting. “Wait a minute. The army? Where the hell were you in the army?”
started this, now stop it. Stand the fuck down and shake the man's hand, you whacko fanboy." He could see the hesitation in Rhodey. "You're embarrassing him, Rhodes.” he sing-songed. “You're embarrassing Captain America. You're embarrassing
“Of course. You gave it to me. It’s not my area of expertise, of course, but it seemed to make sense.”
"Sure." Tony knew he sounded odd, but he was doing a pretty good job considering that he felt like the world had just tilted on its axis.
"Seriously, I fucking hate you," Tony panted next to him. He must be starting to feel better if he was using actual words. "There is no reason whatsoever to go jogging at any time, but I particularly object to it at five thirty in the fucking morning when I have a hangover!" he continued.
He tries to get back to his own, but his eyes keep slipping to Tony, who has wantonly taken possession of the couch. Really, the man is deriving a level of hedonistic pleasure from a moderately comfortable piece of furniture that makes Steve suspect that that trailer is as dilapidated on the inside as it is on the outside. Tony is shifting constantly, burying himself deeper and deeper into the pillows, one hand on his book, one splayed on his belly. Under his shirt. Steve can't stop watching it. He imagines the feel of the skin and the happy trail under the fingers, he imagines it sliding lower, into the lounge pants. He imagines it closing around Tony's rapidly swelling dick. He has always loved stroking a man to hardness, feeling him go from soft and vulnerable to throbbing and wanting, filling his hand with need.
Tony interrupted her with the first thing that popped into his head. “I am French.” JARVIS translated that with something that sounded like 'Frankish'. Must be the temporal equivalent. She nodded sagely as if that explained so much. Tony repressed a smile. Franks or French, things hadn't changed much, apparently, and they weren't that much more popular than Vikings. “The armor is Frankish, too.” He added on a whim. She nodded again. She obviously did not recognize what Tony and JARVIS were speaking as anything other than what passed for Frankish. William the Conqueror had not made it over then, yet. Which put his current place in time at before 1066 AD, anyway. Not that that knowledge did him any good, but imprecise numbers gave Tony the creeps and any success in hemming them in felt like a triumph. It was a good thing she didn't know any French, actually, because Tony's knowledge stretched to 'oui', 'non', 'merci' and 'Voulez vous coucher avec moi?' and even those were hundreds of years out of date.
“Come on, Stevie. I’ll take good care of you. Just come home with me.” Swallowing down an uncomfortable pang of regret, he tried very hard to pretend he wasn’t also talking to another Steve. Maybe he wasn’t as sober as he thought, he usually had that shit under better control.
Phil Coulson didn’t answer until he had gotten to the top and Tony had stepped aside to let him pass without forcing him to crowd into his personal space. Phil shook his hand earnestly.
He had barely taken his tie off at home when Fury walked in with a woman in black leather, who was the spitting image of Natalie. She stabbed him in the neck with a syringe.
Tony elbowed him in the side and Steve laughed and it was a wonderful sound and a wonderful sight and Tony couldn’t believe he’d almost ran away from this guy a few hours before.
Tony waggled his eyebrows suggestively and a small pool of dread settled in the pit of Steve's stomach. Or was it excitement? Both?
“God, yes!” Steve's mouth started watering. “Not those horrible fast food ones, but an honest to god, inch thick, medium rare hamburger on a fresh sesame bun with an ice cold Coca Cola.”
"Upgrade my toothbrushes," Tony answered, "I figured that if I can take down a wonder twin with what I have, a bit more firepower should bag me a full grown man at least. And it might be possible to extend the reach of these..... You know the repulsors are mighty final in most cases, I may want to integrate some of this technology into the armor and...."
Steve slipped his hands out of Tony’s and cupped his face while he deepened the kiss. Just for a second or two. Then he pulled back. Tony wanted to protest, but recalled they had an audience, so he just looked at Steve. Steve’s smile was small, but steady.
"Nat, go fetch a spare arc reactor from Tony's lab. JARVIS, show her where it is and disable all the security on it. Bruce, get him an antibiotics shot
"Fuck you," said Tony, "I am not outsourcing anything, therefore I am not cheating. I'm just having J.A.R.V.I.S. project some lines onto the undecorated cookie. Would you accuse your grandmother of cheating if she showed you her paint-by-numbers masterpiece?"
Steve bit back a involuntary laugh. "You don't like it? It's got Stark logos all over it, I thought you liked that kind of thing."
"I'll have you know I was very restrained with that purchase. I was very tempted to get you a pink one. I remember you looking lovely in pink." Steve spluttered and Tony started singing.
“Preliminary specs only.” Pepper smiled at him sweetly. “Now that you're back, I'm sure you'll be able to get your grubby little hands all over them soon.” Tony didn't trust that smile.
Steve and Percival were circling the place, back to back, swords drawn, their gazes sweeping the place for the source of the sounds. Tony inched further inside, his back to the wall. He was about a third of the way to the altar when he felt, rather than heard, something launching itself at him from inside the wall. He screamed and flung himself away from where he had been standing. Steve and Percival were by his side in seconds and all three of them stared at the part of the wall where Tony had been. From behind the inscribed stone that closed off a wall crypt came a moan and snarl and then something that sounded a hell of a lot like someone trying to claw his way out of the crypt. Tony swallowed hard.
Part of it was that he couldn’t stop wondering where Steve was now. Rotterdam? Brussels? London? Had he gone south or north? He felt so fucking helpless in the knowledge that he had no way of finding him, no way of contacting him, no way at all. He didn’t even know Steve’s last name. The idea that he might never, ever find out what would become of Steve ate at him like a cancer. So did the inevitable turn those thoughts would take as to what Steve was doing to stay alive. Multiple times a day he’d have to shut his eyes and grit his teeth and find something else to do really quick as he tried to banish the image of Steve on his knees on some dirty sidewalk in front of some unsavory stranger.
“The guy behind me is kicking my heels. Can you and Tony discuss the finer points of the stitching some other time? We’re holding up the line. Steve, so nice to meet you!”
But then Steve grinned at him and suddenly he looked ten times better than he did yesterday. And, aw, shit. Under the grime and the other signs of hard living Steve was obviously just a human being, like everyone else. One that needed a friend, like everyone else. As long as Tony didn’t have to try to fix him, he’d be alright.
For reasons unknown, the kittens seemed curious about the stranger in ways they had definitely not been curious about Tony and it was not a little bit irritating to see them gingerly venturing towards his outstretched hand. Once they had started sniffing his fingers, he gently scooped them up and rose to standing. Tony got a better look at him now. He was taller than Tony and probably a couple years older. He would have been classically handsome if there hadn’t been a gaunt look to his face, as if he had missed a few too many meals. His eyes seemed a little haunted in the way they would focus on Tony and then slide away, only to come back a second later. He could be a junkie, but if he was, he hadn’t been one long as far as Tony could tell. The man offered him the kittens. It was a strangely appealing sight. Big man, big callused hands, tiny balls of fluff looking deceptively innocent. Tony smiled but didn’t reach for them.
Steve had thought of something to say. And now Tony had to say something. About the cats. He sure as hell hadn’t been scrambling for things to say about the cats the last few minutes, so it required a bit of a mental u-turn. Cats… Right. The cats.
"Why don't you get some fucking popcorn and sell tickets, Barton?" Tony yelled at him. "Stop talking about us as if we can't hear you!" Fuck, they weren't breaking up, were they? Steve wasn't allowed to break up with him before they'd even gotten together.
He didn't smell anything when he opened the door of the chapel this time. That was good news. At least some of the stuff was being filtered out. Of course, it was perfectly possible that the actual culprit was an odorless compound and there would be no way to find out if the filter got it out until he started seeing dancing unicorns, or something less benign, but that couldn't be helped. He struggled a bit with the manhole cover and when it came off a cloud of yellowish smoke billowed out, dissipating quickly. Tony peered down the hole. There was a flickering light coming from somewhere under the hill the chapel was situated against. He could see rungs leading down the shaft, but nothing else. Right. Down into the belly of the earth, into what seemed to be another fucking cave. Nothing good ever happened to Tony in caves.
"Yeah. Well. Judge not, lest ye be judged yourself." Steve was running out of patience rapidly. "Go back to sleep, son. You need your rest to heal." Galahad obediently closed his eyes.
“You used a weird mixture of glamour, illusion and charms, so it looks like an apple, it feels like an apple, but it smells like plastic and hair and it probably tastes like that too, which I am not going to even try, just so you know.” He tossed the apple in the air and caught it, looking pensive.
"Me," Tony blurted. "Well, not me in the literal sense," he continued before Steve could make a hooker joke. And he would, but it would be a horribly awkward one and Tony couldn't handle that level of adorkable while he was stone cold sober. "We’re selling Tony Stark products that aren't weapons. They're a hard sell when that's all you're known for."
He let himself fall onto his back as he tried to catch his breath, endorphins rushing through his body, not trusting himself to speak. What did you say after something so mind blowing anyway?
Tony dove under the bed where he kept the suitcase and dragged it out. He had it open and assembling when Steve entered the room through the sliding glass doors. Tony stared at him, couldn't help it. It was like that time he'd come to Tony's rescue in the catacombs but with the intensity cranked up to a hundred. He was magnificent and beautiful and he was grinning at Tony like Tony was the prince in Sleeping Beauty that had woken him up, and he was just so very happy to be back among the living. He was also a complete fucking stranger. Well, maybe not complete. Tony could see the shape of the Steve he knew, but it was like the Picasso version of Steve. Tony searched for words, but couldn't find them. Nothing to connect him to the Steve he.... The faceplate clicked into place and then the issue was moot.
“I still don’t get it. Why did you want me to hire her if you like her so much? I mean, she’s fantastic, so I am not regretting anything, but...”
Steve blushed and looked down at his hands, which had a white knuckled grip on the railing. He hesitated so long that Tony had to fight down disappointment.
Steve would have a problem with being rude to women, he probably referred to hookers as 'ladies' too. Tony's job, then, to go stake his claim.
“The paranymphs are more for moral support these days. I’m bringing Natasha to glare them all into submission. And you can look like you think all their questions are dumb, if you want. I can’t believe you read it. You’re officially more qualified than Mike now.”
Natasha received his offering of tuna and a new dish pan without comment. As she wrote her name on the cans, she asked offhandedly:
Steve sighed. "Yes, it is. If you want to, I can order the others to not take that spot, so it doesn't offend your sensibilities to take an order from me. But you'll still end up in that spot."
It was hard to tell. Objectively, Tony looked like shit. He was pale and clammy and had circles under his eyes. But his eyes were sparkling and his smile could have lit up Manhattan.
Tony couldn’t see Steve’s face. The side that was turned towards him was shrouded in shadow and a glint of his eye was all he could make out. He wanted to reach out and slide his hand along Steve’s jaw, draw him into an embrace, maybe. But that wouldn’t be a good idea. He settled for placing his hand on top of Steve’s, thinking that might be accepted by the other man. The skin was dry and rough under his fingers and when Steve’s hand twitched under his own, he gave it a quick squeeze and let go.
"Alright," said Tony, studying the map on his wall. "I think we can rule out Ireland, that's too big to qualify as an island like Percival described it. So it would either be the Isle of Man, or one of the Scottish islands. And I think even Percival would have noticed if he'd wandered into Scotland." He side eyed the man, but Percival gave no sign of even knowing what Tony was talking about. He suppressed a small sigh. "The Isle of Man is closest anyway, even if it is all the way on the other side of the freaking country, so how about we start there and if it's a dud we work our way north?"
"Well, I was too busy blaming myself. Just like you, apparently.” Tony looked at him sideways. “You sure you don't actually think I am the fuck up in this scenario?"
He tried getting back to his exercises for a good thirty minutes, but questions and doubts kept intruding. And so did the need to
When he drives down the hill to school, he is struck by how the sunlight illuminates the hills and sparkles on the water of the Strait. It is beautiful.
“Don't apologize, dude! We're having a moment, you and me. Don't ruin it with explanations. I want to bask in your brilliance for as long as possible.”
“Oh, come on!” exclaimed Clint. “You didn’t bring a cat in here! Now my eyes will be itching for days!”
“Good morning, Master Stark.” Jarvis popped up in the still life of a bowl of fruit that Steve had looked at every morning and evening for almost seven years. It was a little creepy, the way Tony’s house elf apparently had the run of the castle, painting-wise.
“Okay, but let’s get off the floor then.” He pointed his wand at a stool and transfigured it into a couch. “Come on.” He dragged Tony off the floor when the boy held up his hand and lowered him onto the couch next to himself. Tony had gone practically limp and flopped against Steve’s shoulder when he could no longer keep his head up.
Tony looked him up and down with a speculative look on his face. Steve tried to glare at him, but his face just wouldn’t do it.
That was a bit of a sore point. Tony felt responsible for his witches, he did, even though he hadn't asked for them, but he really felt much more responsible for Steve. It didn't even compare.
“I'm not trying to... You can stay,” Steve fumbles. There is at least a couple of hours left on the dryer, anyway, that thing is getting old. “I can put fresh sheets on my mom's bed.” Oh God, what the fuck is he saying now? He feels his face heat up and knows there's bound to be blotches on his cheeks. Tony's going to know. He can't possibly have missed the way Steve has been devouring him with his eyes, anyway, and now... It's not normal to just invite people to sleep over.
"Fucking finally," came Clint's voice from far away, but Tony ignored him. He was too busy being mauled. Steve's warm, wet hands were wandering all over. When he squeezed Tony's ass, Tony's hand involuntarily tightened in Steve's hair and Steve groaned and thrust his tongue even deeper into Tony's mouth. Tony could hardly believe this was happening. Cool, dispassionate Steve was kissing him as if he'd been dying to do so for ages. It was heady and overwhelming and completely fucking exhilarating. He pulled on Steve's neck, trying to get even closer and Steve responded by lifting him up as if he weighed nothing. How fucking hot was that? He wrapped his legs around Steve's hips and, oh sweet Jesus, now their cocks lined up and he could feel the press of Steve's erection against his own. It was Tony's turn to moan and renew the onslaught on Steve's mouth.
"Listen, Steve," Tony started, as soon as they were back in the cabin, "I don't know how I fucked that one up, but I obviously did, and I am sorry about that, I really am..."
Natasha opened her mouth to speak again, when Steve didn’t answer. Tony shook his head at her silently, mouthing ‘no’. She shut it and started working the trimmer over his ears.
the same. Tony didn’t want it to be the same. But what if it was? What if he was reading it wrong and Tony was the only one who was about to lose it from a little thumb rub?
“Do not hold me down,” he says, deadly serious all of a sudden. “Not right now. It's... I'm just trying. Just. Just don't.”
"I'm sure she has picked up on something, somewhere along the line." Tony muttered. "Why are you laughing? This isn't funny."
“Maybe. But it also refuses to play my Throwing Muses CDs. We’re reduced to Thor’s vinyl collection.”
they like what they like, because I personally am not that interested and as long as everything is consensual.... Yay for consensuality at all times!" He gave Steve two thumbs up and his best deranged camp councilor grin. "As long as everything is consensual and doesn't involve children or animals, other people have no right to bitch. So I am just going to go through a list and you're just going to nod for 'yes, I know what it is' or shake your head for 'what the hell are you talking about'. Okay? Okay. So our French friend was into cuckolding, among a few suspected other things. How about watersports? Feet? Furries? Cross dressing?...."
He knew it was going to be pointless, but there was no way he would get any work done now, so went outside anyway. He wandered all over town, hoping, wishing for a glimpse of Steve that he
"Dorothy?!? Just because I happen to like dick, doesn't mean I am Judy Garland in this scenario! Dude, I am
“I am getting the feeling the good Captain left out a few parts of the story,” he said with an air of smug satisfaction. “Please, continue. This is fascinating.”
Tony didn't think so. Tony thought the whole soul stealing scam wouldn't have worked if these visions hadn't somehow had a root in the victim's own minds, but he sure wasn't going to tell Percy that. Love-hate relationships with parental figures were one of the few emotional issues he did understand. So he just nodded.
"Depends on whether he secretly has the hots for Natasha. Then she'd be number one. What do you think, Nat? Does he want in your pants?" Clint waggled his eyebrows at her.
Sam came forward to shake Tony's hand and gave him a much more genuine smile than Steve had. Having overseen the introductions, Steve continued: "We're looking for my old friend Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier. We tracked him to New York, but we seem to have lost him. We were hoping J.A.R.V.I.S. would be able to run some data for us. Bucky may have a chance of regaining his memory now that Hydra is more or less defunct and..."
Steve turned back to Tony. He couldn't help the fond smile that spread over his face. He loved these little reminders that no matter how tired and weak Tony was right now, he was still the same cranky asshole at heart. It was probably all sorts of wrong that he liked Tony when he was bitchy, but it was so much better than Tony being serious and quiet.
Steve is really starting to get into the game (it's been ages since he's seen Bumgarner pitch and it's even better than he remembered) when Tony's voice cuts through it.
“No, no, you did well, considering.” This wasn't entirely true, but Tony wasn't Howard and he wasn't going to make Steve feel like a failure when was doing that just fine on his own. “It's just... you know... you need to be seen to be more comfortable around me. You need to be able to kiss me and stuff when the situation requires it.”
and it was as simple as leaving through a different exit and making his way to the race track without Steve spotting him. Of course, that would only last until the tv crews had caught on, but with a little luck he would be going a couple hundred miles per hour by the time Steve figured it out.
"I thought adding the good Captain as our leader was meant to bring the Iron Man back into our ranks, my good lady Widow?"
"Me too." She looked a little sad. Tony had always wondered if she'd had a crush on the man or if it had just been professional admiration. Hero worship, maybe? But that line of thought suddenly hit a little close to home, and to his own little crush, so he looked around for a distraction. He immediately found one right in front of him where Falcon and Bruce were stringing popcorn and cranberries into garlands.
This one they had been trying to drown. Tony was peeved by these people's compliance with the letter of his law, but not the spirit, so he burned down one of their granaries. The wheat was still in the fields, so he presumed it was empty and they wouldn't starve anytime soon. This particular witch was much older and actually kind of looked like one. But her name was Florrie and she told Tony dirty jokes until he felt his ears burn. And that was with JARVIS cocking up the punchlines on half of them. It wasn't like Tony got embarrassed by dirty jokes, usually, but this woman was tiny, and ancient, and really didn't look like she should be insinuating anything about what men like him and sheep got up to together. She cackled and patted his cheek, calling him Laddie. Her relocation didn't seem to bother her and she barely listened when he tried to explain the situation like he'd spun it for Elayne. There were no tears, praise god, and she wasn't even very scared of the suit. The overgrown rose garden in one of the walled gardens delighted her, though, and after locating some rusty tools in a shed, she set to work in it. Tony watched in wonder as she started pruning dead branches and wayward shoots, marveling at her ability to take her altered circumstances in stride. Then she caught his eye, leered at him and started singing with gusto:
“Yes, mom.” But Tony said it without his usual sarcasm. The bitterness from last night seemed to have worn itself out.
As he stumbled down the stairs to the front door, he wondered for the hundredth time why he hadn’t put in an automatic door opener yet, not relishing the blast of cold, wet air he would have to face when opening it. He’d only just started to feel warm again after biking home from the faculty.
“We’re as good as we’re going to get, Happy.” That would have to do, since there was no chance in hell they could manage looking like they didn’t just have sex. “Ready when you are.”
He forced himself to slow down when he noticed he that the people he was moving out of the way were flying through the air a good distance before they landed, and weren't popping back up. His progress was agonizingly slow. He was yelling at people to get out of the way, but he was barely making himself heard of the noise of the crowd. From behind him suddenly came the blast of a horn. Repeated two, three times.
“Yeah. Rotterdam is just south of here. About 10 miles. Biggest port in the world. Not as pretty though. The Germans bombed it in World War II, so it’s much more modern.”
"Oh man! These are awesome!" Sam exclaimed. He slapped a scowling Clint on the back. "Good job averting a Hulk crisis, my man. Worth a cookie, I'm sure."
“No. Yeah, I mean. I gotta…” Not be here. Tony got it. He could almost see the man twitch with the need to leave. It was a small miracle he’d stayed as long as he had, but Tony felt bad about letting him go back out into the wet evening. He didn’t know where Steve was going to sleep, but he knew it wasn’t going to be in a bed. Probably not even indoors.
And that was like being dunked in a bucket of ice water. Shit! There was no time to lose. He ran over to Steve and knelt beside him.
"Sir Stephen!" intoned the scruffy man, "Your task is to rid the church of Scunthorpe of its vile hauntings. Sir Percival, it will be your duty to follow him, because he is good and pure and your assistance will be well rewarded." Then he frowned and glared at Tony. Tony gave him his best PR smile in return. It had never failed to piss off earnest people before and this self proclaimed oracle was no exception.
Steve braces for a cold squirt of lube or a slippery finger. Therefore, he is completely unprepared for the warm slide of Tony's tongue over his rim. He gasps and his elbows almost buckle. There is a fleeting notion that Tony shouldn't be doing this, that it's not hygienic, even if Steve has just showered, but the wet heat of it feels too fucking amazing to voice any of that and Steve shamefully submits to the incredible feeling of Tony's tongue teasing and caressing his hole. The tickle of Tony's Van Dyke against his balls is exquisite. He loses all sense of time, lost in sensation, relishing every lick, until he notices he's dropped down onto his elbows, ass in the air and his cock weeping profusely. Whimpering.
“You don't think you were friends? I had the impression you were more than friends, with the way he searched for you after the war.”
Tony made to sit down, but Rhodes held up his hand. He scribbled something on a piece of paper and beckoned Tony over.
"Alright, everyone! Let's take a twenty minute water break and then we'll reconvene to go over all we've learned today!" Antonio called out after clapping his hands. Steve would have happily dunked his head in the water cooler right there and then to gather his wits, but they had their contacts to worry about. He made his way over to the cooler with Tony, staying close behind him until he could get his erection under control. The other couple wasn't at the cooler.
"No, no! The movie thing where Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are in the bow and.... Don't tell me you've never seen
Still shaking the handful of snow out of his hair that had been Bucky’s way of saying goodbye for the Christmas holiday, Steve opened the door of the Great Hall. Breakfast had long burned off and he was starving. He could hear the echo of his footsteps, they sounded hollow. Only this morning, the hall had rung with the voices of hundreds of overexcited students who couldn’t wait to go home on the Hogwarts Express. Steve had been caught up in the excitement, even though he wasn’t heading out with them. He never did. Being an orphan, he pretty much lived at Hogwarts. Wasn’t so bad, usually, because Bucky always stayed too. But this year Bucky had been invited to spend Christmas with Natasha’s family, which had been fertile ground for future in-law jokes, but still not something Buck would (or should) pass up, no matter how much ribbing he got about his Slytherin girlfriend. Sam was in trouble for getting shitty grades and so he hadn’t been allowed to invite Steve over after all. No matter, Steve could use some quiet study time himself. N.E.W.T.S. were coming up in only a few months, after all.
“Tony!” Steve almost shouted, mortified to the depth of his being that Tony somehow knew the nature of his sinful thoughts.
“How do you what?” Stark's head snapped up and now Steve was staring into fierce brown eyes and somehow that felt like a punch in the gut.
“You can’t expect me to wait three more weeks to redo the processor! What the hell am I going to do for three weeks?!”
“He’s not ready to be thrown to the wolves, Pep. He has been Sleeping Beauty for seventy fucking years, you can’t just toss him into the real world.”
"And now my life is reduced to a fucking Sting song. How absolutely depressing and cliché." He flung himself on the couch with an arm over his eyes, because that was just too close to the truth to be borne in comfort. Pepper sighed and hoisted herself back up on the workbench, picking up the abandoned tablet.
Steve was still in a decidedly good mood when he neared the heli pad. Deciding he could risk a peek, he pulled himself up high enough to peer over the edge. Later he would wish he hadn't done it, that he would just have waited, unseeing and unseen, for Tony to pick him up and take him to the quinjet. Then he would have had more time. More time and a chance to explain and maybe a chance to repair.
the sex. He pulled Steve in for a kiss that would promise just how much sex they would be having, but somehow it turned into a kiss that promised something tender and fragile instead, something that already felt a little like goodbye. Stamping down on that, Tony forced himself to replay the events of earlier this evening, the way Steve had bitten that bottom lip when Tony had been worshiping his dick and soon arousal wiped out everything else. That, at least he could deal with.
That evening in his motel room, he marked all the places he had letters from in the Rand McNally. He didn't plan on purposely visiting all of them, maybe a few, maybe more than a few, but this way he wouldn't miss one if he was close anyway.
"It sounds like the Grail, to be honest," said Percival and both Steve and Tony swung to look at him.
It was full dark now. Food came from the kitchens and over the evening meal they discussed the details of what would happen next. Three of the women chose to stay with the lady, whose name was Eloise and who was the daughter of the murdered king. Steve could tell she was grateful for their company. Shared nightmares were better than lonely ones. He'd learned that the hard way since losing the Howling Commandos. Waking up on a wet Austrian forest floor with someone grumbling and jabbing an elbow in your ribs because your whimpers were keeping them awake was unpleasant. Waking up in cold sweat with your heart hammering in your chest with no one nearby to answer your screams made you feel so hollow that you wanted to die. He hoped Eloise and her companions had the good sense to all sleep in the same room.
Tony laughed. "Sure. If you say so, Captain. Although I haven't done any decent playboying for a couple of years. I guess I am getting old."
Tony rushed back with the paper towels and the tub and handed the former to Steve, who started to painstakingly wipe off little muzzles and tiny paws. The kittens squealed and squirmed in protest, but they were held firmly, yet gently, in the big hands. The whole picture did a funny thing to Tony’s innards. He tore his eyes away and looked for something with which to fill the makeshift litter box. He settled on some of the less relevant articles he had photocopied for his research and started tearing them into little pieces. Steve set the kittens down and they started curiously exploring their new digs.
Christmas Eve was a very subdued affair in the tower. Thor and his entourage had left all bleary eyed in the morning. Falcon had dragged himself out of bed at noon and left for his aunt's house. Everyone else was barely mobile by the end of the afternoon and still a little green around the gills. Everyone except Steve, who was fine, unsurprisingly, but he was kind enough not to rub it in. Bruce made a light soup for dinner to cater to the delicate state of their stomachs and they watched
He has a hard time getting up early Sunday morning, after three bad nights in a row. He makes himself do it anyway because it is going to be another scorcher today and if he sleeps in his usual Sunday run on the trail behind his house will be seriously uncomfortable. Not that he hasn't done worse, in fatigues and with a full pack, in Afghanistan, but he didn't enjoy that then and he doesn't enjoy it now. And he has nothing left to prove in that department. Still he feels guilty somehow for not waiting until the temperature nears the triple digits. The plastic orange fence runs along one side of the trail for about half a mile, before the trail veers off to the left, leaving the fence to run along a hillside, but he can only spot a few goats. He wonders if one of his neighbors left their back gate open and the goats are eating their wastefully watered lawn. The one time he left his own back gate open, he was visited by a family of deer. They were kind of cute, but Gwenna almost had a conniption and his mom's flower beds suffered a lot, so now he is more careful about closing it. Despite the early hour, he is still drenched in sweat when he gets back. He glances surreptitiously at the trailer, under the guise of wiping the sweat off his forehead with the hem of his shirt, as he walks past it on his way back, his breath still ragged. Is it even safe to have those canisters of gasoline sitting out next to the generator in this heat? Right next to his mom's fence? At least the generator isn't on at the moment. He still worries about it all the way to the shower.
Tony laid awake a while listening for the sound of the front door opening and closing. If it happened, he didn’t hear it, though.
"Whoa, there!" Tony interrupted indignantly. "First of all, I never claimed to be a knight and secondly-"
“They were fleeing,” said Gawaine, obviously irritated with Steve's arrival. “The cowards.” He spat on the ground.
Tony was... exasperated, by the sound of it. Steve inched closer and peered around the corner. There was a person on the floor, but it obviously wasn't Tony, because Tony, shirtless and arc reactor uncovered was wrestling with a slim figure who was flailing wildly and screaming curses. Steve didn't hesitate. He ran out of his hiding place and slammed Tony's attacker against the wall, arm bent painfully behind his back. The man screamed and started.... crying?
“Well, now I think it was utterly stupid. Obviously martyrdom isn’t for the likes of me and I shouldn’t aspire to it. Especially not when I am not dead yet. It leaves you fucking lonely as hell when nobody knows you’ve miraculously survived.”
Steve shook his head too. "It doesn't sound familiar at all." Well, it would have been too good to be true if Steve would have known somebody who kept a spare one.
Rhodes leaned a shoulder against the doorjamb. Tony figured he should probably ask him inside, but he didn’t want to interrupt.
"No. No! That's quite alright. I'll be fine. You guys do whatever you want and I'll get some quality work time in. I don't like Christmas, I really don't, I much prefer to spend it alone. In fact, I'll leave you to your discussion and I'll just -" He made to stand up, when Natasha pinned him with a glare that had nothing of her new found softness in it.
Obviously they had gotten overconfident. The Waltz was being a bitch. Steve found it difficult to go from the four count of the Quickstep to the three count of the Waltz, even with Jarvis's help, and somehow it felt similar to ice skating and he had to keep stopping himself from plowing forward as if it was a race to be won. It didn't help at all that they were supposed to hold their partners closer during the Waltz and he could smell Tony's shampoo. When they didn't move quite in unison, which happened all the time, Tony's hair would brush along Steve's mouth and it was difficult not to bury his face in it. He gritted his teeth and stamped down on the urge, but apparently flustered and tense wasn't a good state to Waltz in.
“Partner?” Tony prompted, making sure his misgivings could be heard just fine. “Why do I need a partner?”
"The king is ailing and as long as he is incapacitated, the land cannot thrive. You must make haste."
"She scares me,” Steve admitted, “But... Tony. If you don't want me on the team, I'm not going to force you to put up with me." Tony looked at him out of the corner of his eye. Steve was staring at something high up on the opposite wall, as if he wasn't able to look at Tony right now. God, they were hopeless. He looked back down at the mangled thing he was holding, looking for words.
Steve looked up with trepidation to the top of the cliffs that embraced their patch of rocky beach. They had to get out of here. There was no other choice. If they spent the night here, on this beach, in their soaking wet clothes, Tony would still die. Of hypothermia rather than drowning, but the end result would be the same. He had no idea what the tide was doing, but there was a chance there wouldn't even be a beach in a few hours. He hoisted Tony's wet, grit covered body up over his shoulder and staggered towards the wall of rock. Someway, somehow, he was going to climb that rock wall with Tony in his arms. He didn't know how, just that he would find a way.
show up for the next part of the itinerary. What are the chances they actually want to talk to us in the Vatican or in the Vatican Museum, both of which are hugely crowded at the best of times?"
They had sex in the morning. Between his morning wood and Steve’s adorable I-went-to-sleep-with-wet-hair look, Tony couldn’t help but pounce. Steve laughed and playfully tried to fend him off, but the wrestling match soon turned into groping and before too long Tony was pushing into Steve while Steve clutched at the sheets, pushing his hips back against Tony and breathing his name. He raked his nails down Steve’s back and then down his front, before he closed his hands on his hips and pulled him closer. He groaned with how good it felt, the deep slide in and out of Steve’s heat, feeling it clench and ripple around his dick. Desperately, he reached for Steve’s cock, he wasn’t going to last long at all, and he didn’t want to leave him hanging again. Steve moaned when he closed his hand around it and for a moment Tony was filled with an absurd sense of pride that he’d done that, that Steve was moaning for him. And when Steve shouted and spilled hot over his hand, his muscles squeezing tight around Tony’s cock, he couldn’t help but follow him over the edge while he buried his face between Steve’s shoulder blades, trying to keep from biting him.
"In this case," Tony thought he might as well add his two cents, "it's the overly simplified symbolism." Percival didn't get it, but Steve smiled at him, in a way that drove the morning chill right out of Tony's bones. Refusing to let that distract him, he continued. "So far, everything we've met that was black turned out to be evil and everything that was white has been good. Insultingly simplistic, really. As if we're too stupid to handle a little ambiguity. I wonder what would happen if we ever meet a hermit dressed in orange, or if they even make them in any color besides black and white? Heaven forbid we'd be asked to tax our feeble brains."
"Oh. That one. Yeah, sorry, no can do. I'm in the middle of something here." He turned his attention back to his work, figuring that was that. But Steve didn't leave. When Steve's presence remained stubbornly close, Tony looked at him sideways. Steve was grinning now. That didn't bode well.
Tony decided that arguing that particular point would be pointless and as long as they were going to do what they had decided to do anyway, it didn't matter. So he nodded.
“Told you he had a temper,” Tony grinned at Steve, while Clint went grumbling to the kitchen counter. He pushed Steve towards his room and when there, he tossed him the bathrobe he always used and a clean towel. “Get out of those clothes and put this on. Meet me in the hallway when you’re done.”
Steve decided against hunting up dinner and busied himself with cooking up some of the dried meat and vegetables into a marginally edible mush, and then set to repair some of his horse's tack. Super strength and leather tack weren't always a good combination and he tended to be hard on his gear, used as he was to Tony's more sturdy designs. For about the seven hundredth time that week he wondered if Tony was here alone or if the whole team had come along. He couldn't be sure, but he got a feeling it was just Tony. He realized he was a needle in a haystack in country as large as this, at least while modern communication devices were non-existent. You could pass the person you were looking for on the opposite side of a hill and not be any the wiser until you met again a month later and you finally realized how closed you'd been. But still, he thought that if it had been the whole team, he'd have met more of them by now.
A small redheaded woman slid into the booth opposite of Steve. He was just about to take a bite of his toast, but he lowered it back down as he looked at her.
His discomfort must have been visible from across the room, because fairly soon Antonio, whose name wasn't Antonio, and a woman he introduced as Vanessa came to their rescue. Steve was to practice the steps with Vanessa, while Antonio would take Tony through his part. Things were easier with Vanessa, mostly because he didn't want to stick his face in her hair, but also because she danced like a drill sergeant and would not let him stray a step out of line. All while she made it look like she was meekly following Steve's non-existent lead. He finally felt like he was getting the hang of things, but then he happened to spot Tony and Antonio. Antonio had Tony pulled flush against his chest, and his right hand was way below the waist, practically on the swell of Tony's ass. Tony was laughing at something he had said and he looked like he was having a grand old time. Steve's stumble took Vanessa by surprise and he accidentally kicked her in the shin. He felt his face flush and apologized profusely, but he couldn't even focus on that properly, his eyes kept straying to Tony and Antonio and he knew he was glaring, but he couldn't seem to stop.
"Honor to meet you, Captain Rogers. And I am aware of the situation. I have been briefed most thoroughly." Steve looked for it, but he couldn't see even the hint of a smirk on the man's face. He liked him already.
." Tony didn't stoop to doing air quotes around 'trial of the century' but he couldn't avoid a little sarcastic emphasis on the words.
And Tony's wits were scrambled. It was absolutely, completely and utterly pathetic. He'd gotten off twice in the last two hours, the second time a lovely mutual jerk off session in the cramped shower stall (cramped, because Steve was fucking huge) that had involved lots of hot water, slippery skin, wandering hands and a frankly ridiculous amount of kissing. He was going to have to get some chapstick soon. Tony couldn't remember this much kissing since he was a teenager, and he wasn't a goddamned teenager anymore. No, he was forty-something and getting off twice in one evening should be enough to last him for days. It should at least be enough to clear his head. Yet here he was, staring at Steve's plump bottom lip and his smiling blue eyes and counting the seconds until he could drag him back to the cabin and get him naked again.
As they came running across the deck, it was obvious what was wrong. Next to the ship a serpent had come rearing out of the water. It was twice as large and twice as pissed as the one they had dispatched yesterday, and Tony wondered for a fleeting second if this was mommy serpent. It was ugly and vicious and it smelled like briny death.
“Oh, honey, I thought you'd never ask.” He can practically hear the smirk in Tony's voice. But then there's another foil packet being opened and before he fully realizes what is happening he feels the head of Tony's cock against his entrance. He pushes back, needing this
They bitched back a forth for a bit and then Tony was alone in his house. He cranked up the music and picked up his welding torch.
Clint apparently felt no urge to answer that. "Who's the pretty boy?" he leered. Tony glared at him. Clint glared back. "Seriously, Stark. Who is he and does he qualify as damsel in distress or do you just need to kiss him bye bye and get his phone number before we go? Or if you don't want it, can I get his number?"
"Dude, how fucking strong are you? Do you know how hot this is? We are so going to fuck this way. Some time, some other time. Jesus, Steve." Steve buried his face in Tony's neck and inhaled deeply, the warm scent of him more intoxicating than the buzz he was getting from alcohol these days. Tony was breathing fast and squirming, and Steve wanted,
"Your torso is like a fucking work of art." he breathed. He placed his hands on Steve's hips as Steve stepped between Tony's spread knees. Tony leaned forward and pressed a kiss right under Steve's navel, then trailed his tongue down the path of where his happy trail used to be before the day at the spa. It tickled a bit, but in a way that only ratcheted anticipation up another level. Steve bit his bottom lip to stop himself from making embarrassing squeeling noises. When Tony's tongue reached the waistband of his capris, Tony tilted his head up, brown eyes holding Steve pinned.
"Good. Excellent." Tony started to scramble onto his feet. "Do you want the front side or the back side of the China Barn menu?"
"Those who wish to go home should be given that chance." she said sharply. "But those who would fear their welcome there can either go to a convent if they so wish, or they can stay with me. I should be glad of their companionship while we all recover from these trying times."
"I've missed you so much, you jackass," said Tony, dropping his head back onto Steve's shoulder, while Steve's mouth started tracing a hot trail up his neck.
“I’m afraid this is going to be confidential, Mr. Stark. But here is my assistant’s phone number. Call Ms. Potts and ask her for the Times article and have her call Nick Fury for you. He is the lawyer you want to hire.”
Unbidden, a mental picture of Steve on skates popped into Tony's head. Cheeks pink with cold and smiling that rare smile that transformed his face. Would he wear a hat? Or a beanie? No. No hat, but a ridiculous scarf, Tony decided. He yanked his attention back to his stubborn circuit design and fiddled with it for a bit. Until he started wondering if super soldiers had super skating abilities, or if they had to learn like anyone else. Would Steve be clutching the railing or would he be the epitome of grace, like a a more muscular and heterosexual version of Brian Boitano? Both possibilities were appealing. Damn it, he wasn't getting anywhere this way. He stubbornly poked at his schematics, but they weren't cooperating at all.
By noon Tony couldn't hold on at all anymore and Steve shifted the shield to his back and carried Tony bridal style. It was at once easier and more difficult. Easier because he had a better grip on him and he could go faster, but more difficult because he could see the grimaces of pain passing on Tony's face with every step he took and the clammy, sallow skin under the blush of the fever. The arc reactor had barely any color to it and Tony's breath was fluttery and uneven. The worry became dread. Tony was going to die in his arms if they didn't get to that Grail today. The thought was unbearable, so he pushed it away and focused on finding a gait that was both fast and didn't jostle Tony too much. He ended up with some kind of loping half run that ate up the miles.
Then he beckoned Steve and they trudged through the snow towards the fairy tale house. Steve wiped his hands again.
He wrapped an arm around Tony, because it seemed like he needed it, but was surprised when Tony leaned into it a bit. It was unsettling. Any sign of Tony Stark needing comfort was alarming, even when it was barely noticeable. Steve hadn't realized up until that moment how much Tony being unflappable was something he counted on. He looked around the makeshift workshop and tried to see it through Tony's eyes. It fell way short. The man must have felt like he was in prison. Or paralyzed.
Steve heard a soft whoosh behind him and both he and Percival ducked instinctively. A figure made of green flames came flying over their heads and over the crowds. Screams of rage turned into screams of fear as the man of flame swooped low. It was an almost perfect replica of Iron Man, Steve saw, except its flying style wasn't as cocky as Tony's. Steve couldn't pinpoint the difference exactly, really, he just knew the person behind this green fire Iron Man wasn't as full of swagger as Tony usually was. This person was more goal oriented. And if his goal was to scare off the crowd, it was doing an admirable job. The pressure on Steve and Percival had lessened considerably and once the fire creature started shooting flames from its hands like repulsor blasts it wasn't too long before the people turned and fled altogether.
Natasha decided to tag along to make sure he got the right thing, or some such bullshit. As if Tony hadn’t grown up with all possible permutations of men’s dress attire and hadn’t been an expert on fit and style by the time he was fourteen. Not that Natasha knew that of course. And it was kind of nice to have the company. It -mostly- kept him from wondering if Steve was still in Rotterdam (chances were really, really small) and if he’d run into him (considering where Steve would hang out looking for money and the location of the tux rental place, chances were infinitesimally small).
Tony sat down in the chair with his legs wide and motioned for Steve to recline with his back against Tony's chest, his head on Tony's shoulder.
“Thank you for your input, Stark. So, yes. Both of you are booked at a spa. Captain Rogers, you will get your hair bleached, a full body wax, manicure and pedicure and a spray tan. I've been told the tattoos on your ass can be done so they will hold for at least a week.” Tony tapped out a quick instruction to Jarvis to create a meme featuring the Dos Equis man stating
“I'm not sure if I should lick every inch of you or if we should just skip straight to the fucking. I'm really torn,” whispers Tony, his breath hot on Steve's chest. And as much as Steve's dick is on board with the licking, to make it last and last, he knows he'd be tormented by second thoughts, and third thoughts and thirty-fourth thoughts. It wouldn't work. He needs it fast, and hard, or he's going to chicken out.
Tony’s extremely witty retort was lost in the scuffle of chairs, when everyone stood up for the entry of some Military bigwigs, Steve and Rhodey. Steve was wearing a cheap suit, and not the military uniform that he’d worn when Tony had testified, and Tony didn’t know if that meant anything and that was frustrating as all get out. Steve’s eyes scanned the crowd and as they landed on Tony a little bit of the tension went out of his shoulders.Tony pulled himself together and smiled at him encouragingly.
“Okay. You get some sleep. Get your bedroll and put it next to mine. I want to keep an eye on you. Oh, don't forget to cover up the charcoal first. I am going to wake Percival for the next watch.”
