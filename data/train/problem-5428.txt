“You love him and he knows that,” Tony says. “That’s more important than anything else right now. He’ll come around.”
Pepper throws him funny looks every time they video chat about the latest prosthetics and/or communications models Tony is working on for Stark Industries. Sometimes, other Avengers join him for a while, most often than not Steve or Natasha, but once, surprisingly, it is Clint who spends two hours sitting a few feet away from Tony. They don't exchange more than a couple of words the entire time Clint’s there but it loosens something inside Tony that he hadn't even known had been knotted up.
He was standing in front of the windows of an old hardware shop, the display presented to the public full of 80s and 90s technological devices.
He has never been particularly interested or amazed by astronomy, not even as a kid had he been into imagining himself amongst the stars, much more interested in engineering of every type, robots and machines and things one could find in this Earth.
He’s supposed to be alone in the Compound. Natasha is in Washington for a meeting and Clint went with her, Thor’s been gone for the past week visiting New Asgard, Bruce left in the morning for a volunteer mission to South American regions that were disproportionally affected by the Decimation; and Steve is supposed to be in a group therapy session like he’s been doing every Wednesday for the past 2 months.
“And now he’s gone. I’ve truly lost him,” Pepper laments. “He made the world so much better as Iron Man and he died saving so many people.”
If Steve had thought he was mortified before he had no words to explain his feelings in that moment.
Tony finds Steve where he said he would be: in his office. He must have finished the shopping he wanted to do because he’s now continuing his read of his book, turning pages carefully with the pad of his index finger.
He feels like two people at once and he’s not sure which of the two Steves he’d prefer to commit to.
He calls Pepper at one point, at first just to hear her breathing, then needing to hear her voice. When she tells him she did remember the date and even organized a Stark Industries vigil on Malibu he hangs up on her. He feels guilty and then he doesn’t and then he does again. She doesn't call him back. He doesn’t call her either.
“But really,” Steve says. “I know no one would expect this answer from me but my favorite part of the shows was the little kids. I felt so useless doing that stupid tour but the kids… They made me feel important. They were always so enthusiastic.”
Pepper’s voice disconnects him from his musings and brings him back to the present, pulling his eyes from his hand and Tony’s towards her. She’s standing from her chair and grabbing the wine bottle with her left hand as she grabs her glass with the last. She’s smiling lightly and looking directly at him.
Rhodey falls asleep only fifteen minutes into the first movie. His neck is bent at a weird angle so Tony carefully places a pillow behind it. He knows Rhodey way too well at this point and he can already picture him tomorrow complaining about the pain while denying it having anything to do with his age.
Now he shares communal living spaces in one of the tallest -and definitely the flashiest- building in Manhattan with a team of people so different from anyone else he has ever known in his life.
Most mornings he wakes up feeling the need to move and do something almost immediately. He’s never particularly needed a lot of rest and when he was younger he was very good at running on little to no sleep. These days it has more to do with how repose calls to grief for him. The minutes Tony spends not doing something are minutes when a thousand unwanted thoughts can make their way into his head and Tony’s become proficient at avoidance. Staying in bed does him no good, especially when the other side of it always stays empty. Every morning. Every night.
Steve, Natasha and Tony haven't talked about it since then but their conversations have had a tint of stillness and their silences are constantly shadowed by worry. They all feel both hopeful and hopeless and they can only guess what Bruce is going through, on his own, halfway across the world, trying all by himself to bring Thor, or at least a piece of him, back to them.
They’d had conversations about it, both back when they were just friends and since they started dating but Steve could have never seen this coming.
Natasha goes silent for a few seconds and then takes a deep breath, making Tony think she’s going to continue speaking, but she doesn’t. She stays next to the counter, her glass almost empty now and her gaze somewhere faraway, somewhere that Tony doesn't know if he can reach.
And the next moment he refutes his own comment, “And then I’d feel guilty for feeling that way because I was not there on vacation I was there chasing a guy that wanted to destroy our whole universe.”
As Steve reaches them, something inside Tony breaks and reshapes itself back together, making it easier and harder to think, easier and harder to breathe, easier and harder to live
After he’s eaten a slice of his pizza Steve looks at Pepper again and she swallows the mouthful of pasta she had in her mouth and dabs delicately at her mouth with her cloth napkin.
It’s been over a year since he proposed to her in what was one of their greatest periods of time together.
The gasp Steve lets out at the sight is so low that Tony sees it more than hears it. It’s all in Steve’s body language: it’s in the way his shoulders tense and come up from where they had been slumped, in the way his fists tighten around Tony’s sheets, in the way his mouth falls open in surprise but he rapidly closes it as he swallows harshly.
Objectively speaking, the two couldn’t be more different but Tony still feels in his bones like this is all some kind of big and sick deja vu, like the universe has never gotten over any of his past transgressions and is trying to punish him by making him relive one of the worst experiences of his entire existence.
It just doesn’t make sense. He has enough clothes to change outfits twice a day and still not repeat them for six months. He has jeans and sweatpants and yoga pants and khakis (Tony shudders just thinking about wearing those again and anyway, those
“Huh,” Tony wants to smack himself from not coming to that conclusion sooner. The pants are one of Steve’s favorites track pants, after all. “Yeah, I guess I took them from the floor or whatever when I last got dressed thinking they were mine.”
Everything around them is moving quickly now, nothing like the small stroll they had been doing for the past weeks and Tony, for the first time in what feels like an eternity, starts feeling that warm ache inside him, that overwhelming grip of hope in his heart.
A short silence follows Tony’s statement and he feels ready to look back at Steve again, finding him already looking back.
But maybe that is actually what Steve was trying to ask him because, maybe, Steve knows as well as Tony does what their weaknesses are.
Steve’s question halts Tony, making him swallow against the bitter taste of copper in the back of his throat. It’s a question Tony has asked himself countless times since Titan.
September 1st arrives before Tony’s truly conscious of the change in the calendar, and it isn’t until a few days later that he even notices summer is coming to a close. The days are getting shorter and the air is getting colder all while Tony misses the simplicity of the early summer days.
“Tony would have loved to introduce you to all these 21st century things,” Pepper says. “The big ones and the small ones.”
30 seconds go by and Steve doesn't say anything. He’s got his hands on his lap and he is wringing his fingers together almost aggressively, cracking all his knuckles until they all stop making a sound when he bends and presses them.
There’s a slow movement to Tony’s right and Tony opens his eyes, not having realized previously that he had closed them. Everything is blurry around him but through the daze Tony can make out the shape of Steve in the doorway, so imposing and comforting at the same time.
Tony takes a deep breath, holding the air in his lungs for a few seconds before exhaling loudly through his mouth. The chime of the oven ringer breaks the silence that has settled over the room and Rhodey moves towards it, putting on an oven mitten and taking out the tray where the cookies are now fully baked.
DUM-E seems content with the gesture and he goes back to his previous position next to Steve. Steve, for his part, is getting to his feet slowly, having to maneuver a little bit around the movements of the bots but not motioning them away.
It takes a while for Steve and Tony to find the aid that fits them best. Throughout the process there are near misses between them, attempts at quitting and bouts of anger and frustration. Some people would say the difficulties make the positive results that much more rewarding but Tony just thinks hurt is hurt and it’s never pleasant no matter the outcome.
An image pops into Tony’s head and although it was Natasha who said the sentence and it is Bruce and her that Tony should be thinking about, it isn’t.
perfectly and comes down just past his bellybutton, leaving a strip of skin visible between the shirt and his pants. A delicious, very bitable, very appealing patch of skin.
Steve nods and Tony places his hands on Steve’s shoulders, gently guiding him backwards towards the couch so Steve can sit down.
The whole weight of the cooking falls on Steve and Bruce because Tony prefers to sit back and let them do the work and because the only time Natasha tried to help everything went so catastrophically bad and none of them exactly have any idea how. Since then she has only tried a handful more times and the results have been as unfortunate as the first try so she’s mostly given up and has taken to joining Tony on the watch team.
Steve swallows and the movement of his Adam’s apple is so harsh it draws Tony’s eyes to his neck. As soon as he realizes he’s staring Tony pulls his eyes away.
He hates the constant anxiety of not knowing if his decision is the right one or not. He hates the guilt that comes when things don’t go according to plan and he can’t help but ponder over and over and over again the things he could have done differently, the things he could have made others do differently.
Tony loves Steve, and it isn't so much a realization or an epiphany that Tony has. It’s an acknowledgement, a long-time coming acceptance of a truth.
Finally, Nebula’s eyes move towards Tony’s and for the first time in 3 weeks she gives him a true, soft and voluntary smile.
This time the cough is totally involuntary and it lasts longer, making Tony bend on himself from the force of it.
Steve’s head turns abruptly to the left, letting him look at Tony directly in the eye. The pain and anguish in his expression nearly breaks Tony in half.
Tony hasn’t even finished saying the sentence completely when Rhodey’s voice is heard from the right to them, so loud compared to the tones of voices that Steve and Tony have been using.
Life goes on like this for almost two weeks. Steve is almost sure he hasn't been able to properly assimilate things. He’s just been going through the motions, blinking every time Tony was in front of him to make sure his mind wasn't playing tricks on him.
It’s accompanying Steve to support group a few times, hesitant -because he would never want to infringe on Steve’s private spaces, but touched when Steve tells him he wants him there.
The man brought his gloved hands up to his face and wiped his eyes off, trying to get rid of the snow that was still clinging to his eyebrows and goatee. Steve had thought he couldn’t be more embarrassed but he was proven wrong when he finally took in the man he had hit. He was
The smell of garlic never fails to take him back to hours spent with Jarvis in the kitchen, reading books or working on small, child-like projects as Jarvis hummed and stirred and fried. The sound of boiling water reminds him of college dorms and Rhodey and him living off of pasta for six days out of the week.
Everything that could have made Steve fall in love with Tony was erased and blown away when Tony didn't come back from the portal, when Steve made the call to close it.
When Rhodey is serving the cake on small dessert plates Clint declines his by abruptly standing up from his seat. Natasha glares at him but Clint starts moving away from the table and heading for the exit.
Tony rolls his eyes and pronounces fondly, “Yes, doofus, it is. And today I’m actually wearing my own pants but lately I’ve been finding myself wearing your clothes more and more often.”
Steve is looking at him in the same way he looked at him before Pepper and him broke up -fondly and directly, the force of his gaze hitting Tony in the center of his chest- and perhaps that’s what finally prompts him to take the plunge.
Tony watches as Natasha stands up from her seat to join Clint on the opposite sofa. She curls up next to him, her head on his shoulder and her hand on top of one of his. Clint slowly but surely curls back into her, resting his head on top of hers. When the screen brightens up their faces Tony can see the silent tears that are rolling down their cheeks.
Steve wouldn't say he and Tony are boring, predictable or narrow-minded in bed. But Steve also wouldn't say they’re the most adventurous people on Earth. At first this worried him, a little bit because of Tony’s objective past and a little bit because of Tony’s rumored past. He thought maybe Tony would get bored of him, that he wouldn't be enough to keep Tony interested. But it’s been months since they worked those insecurities out of their relationship. With time they’ve actually found that they’re more compatible in bed than they ever could have dreamt.
“I would love for you to fuck me,” Tony states and Steve gasps lowly. “But I’ve seen your dick before, sweetheart, and I think I need some training for it.”
Pepper’s tablet is still in her hands and she’s not moving towards the chair to sit down. The position is uncomfortable because it makes Tony have to look up at her and his neck feels stiff already so Tony gestures towards the chair, a silent question.
Steve stays silent and this gives Tony the opportunity to go back through his own words and analyze them better.
“Those are our speciality, right?” Tony jokes, but he can see Bruce is more nervous than he had first let on and he quickly grows serious again.
After long minutes of looking away Steve looks into Tony’s eyes again and everything becomes sharper again, more transcendental and hard-hitting.
Tony doesn’t really know what to say, and although he could blame it on his sleepy state he knows it has everything to do with the bluntness and decisiveness of Steve’s statement. It shouldn’t surprise him because if there’s one person in the world capable of leaving him speechless that’s always been Steve Rogers. He just wasn't expecting it to happen now, in this moment that by itself, without any words, already seems to hold so much significance.
Pepper smiles softly and Steve thinks he can see her flush a little under the light make-up she’s wearing.
He physically can’t. His legs are shaking and his hands are too, and he’s still trying to regulate his breathing. Not too fast, not too slow.
But as time continues to pass Tony thinks they’re all going to have to open their eyes to the reality of things: there are consequences they can’t avoid whether this gets solved or not,
Still, Steve knows a good deal of Tony’s complaints are valid and true and he works hard to do better, to become more understanding and flexible, less demanding and controlling of things. Knowing Tony is aware of this part of Steve, the less than stellar part, is exciting in a way. It means Tony accepts him, likes him despite the parts of him that could do with a change.
The fear Tony feels when thinking of a next time or their future hasn’t completely vanished. It’s still there, looming around Tony’s mind and heart, waiting to pounce at any given moment and he knows this.
“I thought maybe this was our time,” Natasha begins explaining. “We’ve been dancing around this issue for so long and I thought maybe now was it. But Bruce thinks differently.”
Tony shrugs ad Thor finally meets his gaze. His face is hardened, rough stubble painting his cheeks and dark circles under his eyes. He looks defeated, not just by Thanos, not just because of all the battles he lost but because of all the days he’s still have to live.
Bruce must have really just made it back, probably not even five minutes having passed since his walking into the Compound, because when they reach the room Bruce is unzipping the duffel bag he took with him to Norway.
Her hand leaves his face as she starts to move back a little, setting herself fully into her chair once again. This time her posture is more relaxed but there’s still weariness there, set in the subtle frown of her brows and her sad smile.
Steve tilts his head in confusion at the name. JARVIS never calls Steve Sir, only Captain or Captain Rogers, no matter how many times Steve’s tried to get him to just call him by his first name. Sir is the name JARVIS used for Tony and Steve knows he would never use it for anyone else.
Steve loves the world and it’s always been a dream of his to see as much of it as he can, but Steve’s only ever been away from the States in Captain America business.
However, he knows Steve finds comfort in touch when he’s had bad episodes like this so, forgetting all about killing charged moments and ignoring dangerous paths, he moves his stool closer to Steve’s and moves his arm around Steve’s shoulders.
“Pep, I just want to say… I want to say I’m sorry. I’m sorry for a lot of things but I guess I’m most of all sorry for not keeping my promise that there would be no more surprises. This must be a pretty big surprise. I wish my surprise could have been coming back to you but… Oh well. I just hope… I don’t know. I guess I hope you’re still okay, and that Rhodey is too and that you’re there together helping each other. I also hope Happy is okay and—“
Natasha follows his instruction and sits on one of the high kitchen chairs as Tony gets back to making the salad. He moves towards the refrigerator to grab more ingredients so the salad will be enough for both him and Natasha. The process is almost mindless -clean, peel, chop, clean, peel, chop- so he starts up a conversation with Natasha while doing it. There’s so many things to catch up on and most of it comes from Natasha.
Natasha’s always light and silent on her feet but Tony must have been making sounds as he walked because Bruce notices their approach immediately as they make it to his door.
Tony chooses a little girl this time and brings her confidently to his shoulders. Instead of sitting her on them he instructs her to put her feet on each shoulder and grab the suit’s gauntlets with her hands. The girl’s blonde pigtails sway as Tony moves her around and she looks overjoyed for the whole twenty seconds she’s up there.
The memories come to him in less than a millisecond. It is definitely proof that he’s finally completely awake and alert.
Before leaving the room he takes a deep burgundy robe to pull over his thin pajamas and he sets course towards the living room.
Steve rereads the last text message five times, his fingerings hovering over the touch screen but not moving. He sits up and rests his back on the austere black bedpost so he’s reclined instead of completely laid down on the bed.
They started off in Paris and celebrated their actual six-month anniversary day there, in the fanciest and most delicious restaurant Steve has ever set foot in. After their dinner and for the following four days they’d done every possible clichéd thing they could have done as tourists.
She’s not interrupting anything, really, as Tony and Rhodey are not going any real work that is time-sensitive or crucial.
During this brief period of time Steve has started putting his own coat on and Tony turns around just in time to see him finishing zipping it up.
Steve nods because he remembers it perfectly well. That conversation precipitated all of his revelations about his feelings for Tony and it’s accompanied him through it all.
Although the conversation ends there it keeps haunting Steve. It keeps haunting him in a way he doesn’t quite understand.
Natasha bids Tony goodnight at around 10:30pm, after having helped him clean the dishes and hugging him gently. Tony is still in the kitchen when Steve gets to the Compound almost an hour later.
Tony feels dread fill up his body to the brim because no, Steve wasn’t just leaving but Tony’s last idiotic comment has made him want to.
All these questions have ran through Tony’s mind at least once in the past few weeks and they’re all piling up, crashing into each other at the moment.
Soon enough, though, Steve stops thinking about cameras and pictures and trying to capture the moment and it’s all for the best, anyway, because there are certain things only meant for Steve’s and Tony’s eyes.
“Fuck,” Tony groans, biting the inside of his cheeks when he feels his dick spluttering pre-come. “Yes, yes, yes.”
The table is still between them and Miss Potts extends her hand across it so Steve can take it and shake it.
Steve’s answering smile is blinding but there’s something underlaying it too. It’s something Tony recognizes.
He’s been thinking he lost the fight but maybe what he’s saying now is true, maybe there was never really a fight to lose.
“I guess I’m getting too old for this,” Rhodey jokes as he gets up from the couch. He bends his waist a little back and forth and then to the sides, making his back crack.
Tony keeps pulling on Steve’s arm and guiding them further away from Natasha’s room. Without having consciously decided to do so, Tony finds that he has moved them towards his own room, and they’re now standing in front of his ajar bedroom door. Steve seems to realize this fact at the same time that Tony does and he makes a shrugging motion with his shoulders that dislodges his arm from Tony’s grip. Tony takes a step backwards, putting some distance between his body and Steve’s as soon as he notices Steve’s deliberate move.
It’s not something to worry about, at least not for Steve, who has now vowed to himself that he will make it work. It was only the first try and there are tons more to perfect it.
Not for the first time in his life Tony feels undeserving of him, but he allows this one good thing to warm him from the top of his head to the tips of his toes and he holds up his right hand towards his best friend.
His breathing takes a little way to regulate and his heart also needs a few minutes to resume beating at its normal pace, not at the wild staccato it had taken as he had woken up.
The last time Tony and Natasha saw each other things hadn’t quite gone horribly wrong yet but they were about to do so, the team had already been split up and Steve and Tony were about to apply the last nail to the team’s coffin.
He groans pleasantly when his knees crack from having sustained the position for too long and moves measuredly to straddle Steve’s legs, leaving him perched on Steve’s crotch, like the king of everything.
Steve’s breathing through his mouth and although it’s not a very loud action in the silence of the room it feels clattering.
“It really has,” Steve says and he places his hand on top of where her rests on his arms and squeezes lightly, making Pepper smile sweetly at him.
Tony takes a step to put himself in front of Natasha instead of standing slightly to her side. This also serves to put his body between her and Rhodey.
“And I’ve been trying to convince Bruce to come with me but he’s having his doubts,” Natasha says in the middle of telling Tony about the latest project she and Okoye have been working on.
There are around ten kids running and jumping around in the video and the sound of their delighted screams is so loud Steve winces for a second until it balances out.
He walks to the left side of the bed and reaches under his pillow to retrieve his pajamas. He changes into them as Pepper leaves the phone back where it had first been and walks into the bathroom, leaving the door ajar as she starts brushing her teeth.
Tony’s solid and real under his arms but he’s also standing stiff as a board, his arms hanging by his sides until he brings the right one up to pat Steve on the back four times in a very slow manner.
It’s Steve he takes down into his workshop, Steve he wakes up next to, Steve he cuddles into when the team settles into the common floor living room, Steve he is building a life with. And while doing so, Steve has made him feel comfortable wearing anything
His mind has always been able to conjure up the weirdest of sensations, the strangest and deepest fears Tony never even knows he has in the first place. The bottom of the ocean, for example. Tony hadn't even been aware of it being a possible issue for him but here he is, feeling stuck like it’s really happening, like this is really the one thing that’s going to kill him.
Steve doesn’t say anything at all, not that Tony would have heard him through the soundproofing of the workshop. He beckons Tony closer with his right hand as DUM-E starts approaching the door.
“I don’t know how we’re going to handle this but I need to go to HQ to see how badly things have hit us and to create a plan. I don’t know what’s going to happen to Stark Industries and it feels so wrong to say this because at this point there are a million more important things than a freaking company but-“
June starts off rainy and chilly, like summer is refusing to even hint itself. But by the second week of the month the Avengers living at the Compound find themselves needing to turn on the AC more often than not. Heat and humidity -and the weather in general- aren’t what they used to be before the Decimation happened.
Distance in Afghanistan always seemed daunting too. Afghanistan and its real desert. Afghanistan and its endless dunes. Afghanistan and its infinite sea of sand.
Since the time Steve awoke from the ice he’s been able to see what the legacy he left behind became, what his memory inspired and what his name started to represent. He became more of a national symbol that he was even alive. He was used as a capitalist tool and as a social motivator for people. Captain America became, above all, a legend. People venerated him as Steve Rogers but all they actually praised was Captain America. Very few people were still around to remember his as he truly was. Peggy and the Commandos, that’s all. Howard, maybe.
“It’s okay,” Tony interrupts, trying to spare Steve the pain of tangling himself up more on his words. And also trying to spare himself further blushing than the one he can already feel growing on his cheeks. “I know what you meant.”
Steve has to almost carry Thor inside, the man stumbling every few feet and smelling of beer, grease and sweat. He’s mumbling uselessly all the way to the living room, where Steve drops him not too carefully on the couch.
“That was hard to say,” Tony states, his voice trying to sound breezy and light. “I hope you appreciate the lengths I’m going for you, Capsicle.”
Exiting his text conversation with Tony and feeling a lot more content now that he knows he’ll be seeing him soon, Steve lays down on the couch to wait, clicking back to the Photo app of his phone and looking through the pictures he took of the sunset before taking his own selfies.
All those things are personal, Tony knows this. The mere idea of sharing even a small smidge of his therapy sessions with anyone who’s not his therapist makes Tony want to burn down his brain and all the information inside it. He knows Steve must feel the same way about it.
She starts asking Steve about himself, about his experiences since he woke up from the ice and his memories as Captain America.
Tony raises his eyebrows in surprise when he hears the comment and the action doesn't go unnoticed by Natasha.
Ronin is proof of what people can become when they think they have nothing left to lose, Tony thinks.
“We should probably, um,” Steve stutters and clears his throat, his gaze still focused on where Natasha and Rhodey had been only seconds before. “Maybe go to bed, too.”
Pretty soon Tony has to pull back to gasp in air and he opens his eyes to gaze at Steve. Even though Tony knows Steve can go a lot longer holding his breath he looks as breathless as Tony feels. His cheeks are flushed and his lips look wet and puffier than before. Tony can’t stand the distance any longer and he buries his fingers in Steve’s hair to press their mouths together again.
Tony knows deflation and avoidance pretty well when he sees them, almost as though he invented them, and he hasn’t wanted to push Bruce too much, especially when he knows Natasha is the one who could be more successful than anyone at bringing Bruce out of any funk, and even she hasn't had any luck yet.
“Sure, Steve,” Tony pronounces. His eyes are narrowed and he’s looking at Steve like he’s trying to solve him like one very difficult math equation.
He made a promise to her and he couldn’t keep it and the fate of the world was on the line but… This is not the first time, not the second, not even the
Steve stays silent but he nods again. Pepper sighs and that compels Steve to finally look at her. She’s wearing a sad smile on her face and her eyes aren’t focused on Steve. She’s looking towards the left and her eyes seem a little lost on some imprecise point of the restaurant.
All his friends have turned their gazes to Steve who is still drinking unaffected. Tony looks at each of their faces, trying to solve the mystery, and he can't help but gasp when he finally realizes what they’re all looking at.
The third or fourth time Tony opens his eyes he finds Steve already looking back at him. He hasn't moved at all but his eyes are blinking lazily as his gaze is focused on Tony’s face.
Steve feels even worse then because Tony is completely right about that and it’s something Steve’s learn about Pepper and Rhodey both during their friendship.
Natasha’s glass is half-empty and Tony’s grabbing another serving of the salad when Natasha speaks again.
Perhaps that is the worst part of it all, this uncertainty Tony will have to die with, the not knowing if there is anyone, anyone at all that he’s leaving behind.
The look in her eyes tells Tony she knows just as well as he does how difficult it will be to actually make that happen, but neither of them shatter the fantasy yet.
After a few shared meals Tony starts to notice Thor’s change of demeanor. At first he was silent, very still, unobtrusive even. It was unsettling to see and experience. Thor, whose entire existence has always seemed to consist on being seen and heard and followed. But after a while it feels as if he starts going a little manic. The drinking doesn’t stop but instead of making him morose it turns him hyper, too eager.
“Well, hello,” Tony says and although Steve can’t see his face he knows his expression must be one of confusion.
The doors open and Natasha walks inside promptly, giving them both a sweet smile. Her steps are silent and graceful as they always are but for a second Tony swears she almost hesitates on her fourth step, like she’s maybe regretting having came in. The idea leaves his head instantly as she keeps walking confidently inside towards them.
It’s Steve playing video games for the first time and becoming obsessed with Mario Kart, him always choosing Princess Peach and Tony always choosing Yoshi.
Tony smiles at her and sees how she looks over his shoulder toward the kitchen entrance. Tony turns around to find Steve there, when he had previously walked away from the kitchen when they’d finished eating.
name- is Carol and the first thing she tells Tony after she gets Nebula to open the ship’s door and she makes her way to where Tony is still sat, no energy left in him, is: “Your friends asked me to come get you.”
There are a few new Stark Industries’ things Tony can tell him back but most of the conversation on his part has to do with interpersonal Avengers’  business. Thor, Clint. Natasha and Bruce. Rhodey wants to hear it all and his insights are helpful for more than one thing.
Both Steve and Tony are slumped down on the sofa, their backs pressed against the back of it and their butts almost hanging in the air. Steve only has to turn his head slightly to the left to observe Tony directly and when he does he finds Tony already looking at him.
once as she had kissed his forehead and let him go back to sleep. His 48th birthday had been as unremarkable of a birthday as most but pain, during the few minutes he had been awake that day, had been the real protagonist of it, not Tony.
Tony lets himself lay down on the bed without thinking too much about it when the clock on Steve’s bedside table tells him Steve has been gone for ten minutes. He rests his back against the decorative pillows places upon the headboard and stretches his legs in front of him.
The use of his name brings some clarity to Steve’s unfocused eyes and he finally seems to be coming back to himself, his breaths regulating slightly.
It was cold outside. Really, really cold. A true winter day in Brooklyn. But Steve had his gloves, his hat, his coat and Tony with him. He started talking and wondered if Tony would be interested in enjoying the rest of the seasons with him.
“Perfect. I love you,” Steve says, and he pats Tony’s butt when he turns around to walk out of the kitchen.
“Yes, you. The change you’ve shown since Tony’s been back,” she explains. “I mean, you’ve changed since the Battle of New York and it’s obvious that you needed time to settle after waking up and finding that everything you knew was different. But now, since Tony’s return it’s like you’re… I don’t know how to explain it.”
Tony’s eyes quickly move away from Steve’s own and Tony makes no attempts to hide the fact that his gaze is now focused on Steve’s lips. Unconsciously, Steve licks his lips as he swallows, feeling suddenly nervous and restless. Tony mirrors his movement twice and ends up with his bottom lip pulled between his teeth.
“It means I wouldn’t want you to change even those less than stellar parts, Steve,” is what Tony says one day when Steve’s talking to him about it.
Steve closes his eyes and bites his lip as he feels his heart breath erratically at Pepper’s comment.
They get interrupted by a different waiter this time, this one carrying their two plates with her. She quickly sets them down on their table and leaves with a smile and a wish for them to enjoy their food.
He must have opened the package backwards because it takes him a second to realize he’s looking at the back of a picture frame, the metal claws that fix the thin wood layer and the little clawfoot meant to help it stand.
Tony flinches back instinctively, scooting back on the bed and moving more towards the center of it. Steve’s face darkens and his hand falls on the mattress, palm facing up. Tony focuses his gaze on it, willing his brain to work so he can apologize to Steve but also desperate for Steve to leave him alone.
The world already knows, of course, after having witnessed what has now been baptized as The Battle of New York, so they do as well. They did as soon as it happened, as it was streamed and televised and radio narrated live in thousands of channels and by hundreds of people.
He sits down on the chair next to Tony’s and opens the ice-cream carton, ripping the protective plastic seal. “You don’t have to eat everything, anyway. I just brought you some options.”
“No, Tony. Pepper’s coming and I wouldn’t ask you to cancel on her,” Bruce says. “And Natasha, don’t you even try. You’re needed here.”
This is something Tony has always known. Or at least something Tony has known ever since he first became Iron Man.
And then Tony understands: this is not a rejection, it’s a statement. It isn’t Steve telling him this is not something he wants, it’s Steve making sure they make it happen at the best possible moment.
These thoughts and feelings come and go, they stay for minutes or hours or days, they make Tony roll his eyes or they make his stomach clench and his chest go tight. These are things he believes wholeheartedly and things he doesn’t trust even a little bit. They exist, they’re part of him, and Tony is constantly faced with choices they influence.
“It’s not that I don’t think you can do this, it’s that you shouldn’t have to. Let someone else shoulder the responsibility for once,” has been Tony’s response time and time again.
“You know that’s not what the problem is,” Tony says as he leans forward on his chair. “You spoke on behalf of all of us and told people we can fix the world.”
“I should have gone to see you again when you were still recovering,” Steve says. “I’m sorry I didn’t. After that comment you made, when you said that…”
The man’s gaze was intense, making Steve feel hot even in the cold winter weather. He shook his head and a small smile grazed his lips.
“You… You should go check on her,” Tony tells Steve after Bruce has left, his eyes focused on the direction of Natasha’s room.
Tony moves to pick up the piece of paper they’ve using to play paper football from the floor and returns to his place in front of Nebula.
Before Tony can move to take his bulky coat from Steve’s arms and put it on, Steve drops his own coat on a nearby chair and holds Tony’s coat from the shoulders, extending it so Tony will just have to put his arms into the holes.
Steve keeps watching her for a few seconds and then his eyes travel from her face to the half-full bottle she’s holding and to her face again.
The nightmares still happen and there are nights when fog floods his lungs and electricity paralyzes his muscles, but they’re getting easier to deal with now, maybe because Steve knows he’ll be able to actually get better sleep the next night.
He continues by saying that nothing made any kind of sense when they got there because Carol proclaimed Thanos was completely alone, no defenses, no allies. Just him.
Natasha nods her confirmation. “I know what the four incidents these past months have been like, yes.”
Tony’s lips are already moving against Steve’s, but it’s a slow and somewhat chaste movement. It’s only lip against lip in the smallest of ways, like a caress given to a lover in secret as you’re trying not to get caught. Steve wouldn’t describe it as shy but it feels tentative, too tentative, as if Tony has doubts about what Steve’s reaction will be. Tony should never feel doubtful about them and that’s why Steve lets go of the sketchbook he’s still holding in his hands and brings one of them to the back of Tony’s head.
It’s now coming to that time when, once again, they both can see themselves heading towards the inevitable and yet neither of them are saying it yet.
Steve places his elbows over his knees and lets his head hang forward, only supported by his hands tangling in his hair.
The short answer is no, it hasn’t. Tony is not harboring any thoughts or ideas of letting go and dying because he needs to be here, he needs to be alive to give his all once again. He has to be here because Pepper is still here, because Rhodey is still here. He needs to be alive because if he wished he wasn’t that would be dishonoring the memories of everyone that isn’t alive.
Tony loses his mind for the entire time that Steve is eating him out and the sight of Steve enjoying it just as much as he is only serves to magnify the experience and make it even better. It’s something so intimate and passionate that Tony knows balance has just shifted between them.
The air is cool and it drizzled throughout the day so a slight dampness hangs in the air but Steve feels perfect in his long-sleeved button down, his elbows resting on the railing of the balcony, his eyes roaming around the streets as far as his eyes can see.
Slowly, Tony opens his eyes and, for a second, everything is so bright it hurts to look at. His hand comes up instinctively to cover up his eyes and protect them but Tony still feels groggy and, above all, confused.
“But you guys will get through this,” Tony says and he regrets to hear his voice sounding less convincing that he’d like it to. “I know things aren’t great right now but you guys can stay friends. You can go back to normal.”
Sleep takes him into its arms gladly, but Tony doesn't find the comfort of rest in its body. Instead, Tony’s dreams are filled with faceless entities that chase him and chase him and chase him to the ends of the Earth. The locations twist and turn around Tony and they all look familiar: first it’s the ruins of Sokovia, then it’s the boarding school he attended when he was a child and lastly it’s New York City in the midst of an alien attack.
He knows it isn’t true, he knows it was only a matter of time until Peter upgraded from petty thieves and street criminals to the bigger leagues, and he knows Peter never needed his help to become the big hero that he was. But the
“Tony,” Steve’s kneeling next to him in the blink of an eye, placing his hands under his head and checking for injuries. “Tony, I’m sorry.”
What Valkyrie’s been saying, every time one of them calls her to check up on Thor, is, essentially, that Thor is in a state no one would have ever been able to imagine him in.
He spars with them in a gym enhanced by motion-detection technology. He cooks for them in a kitchen that has a device that can heat any kind of food in such a short amount of time (because yes, he will never stop being in awe of microwaves no matter what other technological wonders he encounters). He regularly spends night after night with them watching movies he never would have dreamed of watching before.
Steve leaves the Compound late in the evening to have an emergency session with his therapist. The fact that he’s willing to face the risk of running into the press while being outside proves how much Steve is really in need of it.
They settled on one of Disney’s newer releases because even though no one would have ever predicted Captain America and Iron Man would ever pick that one, it seemed like the safest choice at the time.
When the TV flickers off he finds himself thrown in the middle of the darkness. The sun has disappeared from the sky in the time Tony was too transfixed by watching TV to notice anything else going on around him.
He’s not fully smiling but he’s not looking too serious either. The left corner of his lips is slightly turned upwards when he presses down on the camera shutter, once, twice and then a third time.
“They kind of are like kids,” Steve reiterates and is rewarded by Tony’s face subtly lighting up as the right corner of his lips curls upwards.
Steve purses his lips and moves his eyes away from Tony’s. He keeps his body facing towards Tony and that feels like a hard-earned victory in itself.
He keeps laughing for about a minute as Tony watches him nervously, out of depth. The only thing he can think to do is bring his hand from Steve’s shoulder to his head. Tony starts stroking Steve’s hair delicately, careful and attentive to any signal that Steve is uncomfortable with it.
“I’ll help too if you give me the go ahead then,” Rhodey accepts. “I’ll act as the middle man like always.”
Steve stays in the same position for a couple of minutes but he stands up when Tony keeps his silence. Steve sighs and a tiny spark ignites inside Tony because for a second there the sigh sounded almost exasperated.
Steve’s eyes roam and start searching for something, some kind of answer or explanation, on Tony’s face.
Tony doesn’t want to give up, and he won’t, but he lets Steve walk away from these situations knowing that sometimes that’s the best he can offer.
“You said what you thought would make people happy without stopping for a minute to think if it was true,” Tony disagrees.
It’s Pepper catching him working on Avengers’ projects and becoming so silent it leaves him feeling uncomfortable even as she walks out of the room. It’s Pepper trying to ask him about Peter and Tony instantly wishing he had a Scotch glass in hand.
“But I guess I’ve also always been on Steve’s side. I wasn’t agreeing with him in that moment but I couldn’t stop being on his side. And you two, even though you were also disagreeing, you’ve always been on the same side too.”
“I think Pepper texted you!” Steve yells in the direction of the kitchen, where he can hear Tony’s voice as he talks to someone on the phone.
He almost leaves the room without saying goodbye to Steve, but when Tony’s walking by him, Steve grabs his wrist and gently pulls him close to where he’s still sitting. In this position, Tony’s a lot taller, looking down at Steve, his hands resting on Steve’s shoulders. Steve places his hands on Tony’s hips and he squeezes lightly on them.
He decides to avoid the question which consequently means avoiding talking about his doubts and his fears just one more time.
Steve chuckles as he shakes his head. “I won’t. I’m just going to do some online shopping. There’s some gym equipment I’ve been meaning to try.”
How does he dare to make it seem like all Tony did was have a fucking tea party with the guy that killed half the universe?
Everything feels like a luxury that day, starting with the fact that Steve’s day is mercifully free. Tony arranges it so the only thing he’ll have to do is be on a video-call with a group of Stark Industries employees from Johannesburg early in the morning, making it so he’ll be able to share the whole day with Steve.
Tony’s screen shows both of them -Steve and Tony- laying down against the white sheets on their bed. Steve’s got his eyes closed and based on how he has no recollection of the picture ever being taken he guesses he was truly asleep in that moment.
He’s standing next to the couch, Steve’s phone having been deposited on the coffee-table Tony obviously done with his call.
The dial tone goes on and on and on until the voice on the other end on the line is telling him to leave a message after the tone. He hesitates and thinks about hanging up but he takes a deep breath and starts talking as soon as the beep informs him to.
They hadn’t explicitly said it but it had been a tacit agreement that there would be no gift exchange at the Compound for the holidays and, up until this moment, Tony believed they had all complied to it.
Tony turns his head to the right to look between Steve and Natasha and he’s not surprised to find their faces looking determined.
Yes, the Decimation is something the whole world shares. But no, it’s not the same for everyone. It’s definitely not the same for them.
Tony looks at him and is surprised to discover that, for the first time, he really can see only him as Steve. A blank canvas of possibilities for what he could end up meaning for Tony, no past expectations, no forced interactions or unwanted conflicts.
Tony drops Steve’s hands hastily and he spots the confusion and slight hurt on Steve’s face before he realizes what Tony’s doing. Tony stands up from his chair and he makes his way around the table, pushing at Steve’s shoulders when he reaches him so he’ll leave enough space between his chair and the table so Tony can sit on his lap.
Tony’s hand tickles. He is now rubbing his whole palm against Steve’s cheek and not just his thumb and the hairs on his arm bristle at the full contact. It’s a pleasant feeling and Tony can’t deny that he’s been thinking about how Steve’s stubble would feel tot he touch for the past three days.
“I’m so sorry,” Tony whispers in the space between their faces. His tears have started falling as well. “I wish I could give you something more than this.”
Natasha sounds chocked up, her voice full of pain and regret. Tony has seen her vulnerable before but never like this, never so vulnerable she forgets to even hide it. Or maybe it’s not that she’s forgotten. Maybe this is what the fight has taken from her, the desire to hide herself from everyone.
“Bruce,” Natasha responds in kind, but before she can say anything else Bruce abruptly turns around and heads down the hallway he came from.
He’s gone before Tony has even had a chance to assimilate the words. He still isn't sure if he dreamed Clint using his given name or not.
They don’t make a real point to tell the rest of the residents of the Compound, but it’s only because they don’t really have time for it. The day after their first kiss, Natasha is having breakfast with them in the kitchen and she announces her congratulations in the middle of Tony’s rant about the last book he read. By the end of that week, every one of their co-habitants has expressed their knowledge about their relationship in one way of another.
Pepper clears her throat and moves some of the food in her plate with the fork held in her right hand.
The sound of someone clearing his throat into the microphone resonates through the gigantic speakers placed around the building and in front of the crowd.
Steve has been told not once, not twice, maybe more than a hundred times, how good of a leader he is. He’s never told anyone before but this is a quality he knows he grew into, not one he was born with.
“We helped her,” Tony says, putting all of his conviction of the fact into his words. “I know it seems like we did nothing but we were there for her. We helped her.”
“Well, I sure hope so, Nat, or else I’m going to start thinking you’re trying to set me up with a savage snowball warrior.”
“Reminiscing,” Steve answers before moving his right hand to the back of Tony’s head and guiding him to fully kiss him on the mouth.
He doesn't go to anyone’s door, he doesn’t walk into anyone’s room, he doesn't check on anyone. Not even Steve.
That’s where the sadness comes from: the thought that maybe Pepper and Rhodey were right, that maybe Steve and Tony really could have been something great.
Steve smiles at Tony before turning his back to him and taking a few items from inside, but Steve’s body blocks Tony’s view of them. Steve turns around after a few seconds and Tony can’t help but chuckle when he sees what Steve is holding. A huge carton of ice cream -mint chocolate chip, Tony’s favorite flavor-, a box of Oreos and a bag of gummy bears.
Not even when the full original team was living together at the Tower did they set to an schedule like this.
words. But there’s so much he can say, so much that has been building up inside him for months and that it’s all for Steve.
He hasn’t yet opened his bedroom door but his body is still half turned as if he was just about to walk inside it.
When Tony and Steve go out there is no one following them from one place to another, trying to find the scoop on their life. They hold hands and less people ogle at them that Tony would have thought. They share meals in quiet restaurants, where conversations are practically whispered, like people have grown zealous of opening up their lives.
There’s so much inside him that eventually it has to be released and it comes out in the form of a sob. As it escapes his throat Steve incorporates in bed and his shoulders shake as more and more sobs rip through him. There’s no tears but there is pain, so much pain that gets worse and worse as Steve can’t gulp down any air.
It sounds exactly like what Tony’s been waiting for months for someone to tell him. It also sounds exactly like what he’s been fearing for months that someone would tell him.
The twenty-first century has much to offer, so many things in fact that it would be impossible to mention them all. From technological to social advancements, passing through cultural and artistic developments. Clothes and architecture. History and science. The Earth is a world of endless wonders and the best part of it all is how so many of them are yet to come.
Tony looks between her and Rhodey and wonder if it’s his friend’s presence making her uncomfortable or if the fact that they’re not in space anymore with only each other for company plays a part in Nebula’s aloof demeanor.
Steve sniffs loudly and though his face is free of tears his lips are pressed together so tightly they’re almost white, as if he’s trying to compose himself and hold back a thousand emotions that want to spill from his very being.
His shoulder feels cold when Steve removes his hand from it but suddenly it’s his side that warms up when Steve occupies the space to his left. They’re not touching but Steve’s big and strong body cuts off some of the wind from making it to Tony. He’s also sort of like a furnace, a small star emitting heat that is making its way into Tony’s bones.
The helmet stops recording as soon as Tony presses the inside button and, with as much strength as he can muster, Tony pushes it away from him, making it face the wall.
Tony’s throat clogs up and his chest goes tight at the certainty that Steve’s words paint. He wants to deny it and say that they can’t know that. He wants to not get his hopes up. But he wants to put in the work, as well. He wants to do more and to do better.
Bruce smiles and takes a seat, his legs bent in front of him and his arms resting comfortably on his knees.
Sure, Tony can recognize the familiar feeling of survivor’s guilt he’s been carrying with him for years now, maybe sharpened now since the moment Peter vanished in his arms. But has it evolved? Has it grown into the wish for oblivion?
Is Rhodey okay? Is he, too, mourning unconsolably at not having been able to fix things? Have Natasha and Bruce taken refuge on each other? Has Nebula been alone all this time or is she finding comfort in having one of her old teammates back? Is Thor feeling in any way better after having been able to kill the man responsible for all this pain?
Tony doesn’t hesitate before continuing his ministrations and he pinches Steve’s nipples between his index fingers and thumbs. He rolls Steve’s nipples a few times, tugging at them every few seconds. Steve’s hips have started moving against his and it’s clear it’s an instinctive move on Steve’s part.
“But there really is nothing you can do,” she states, shrugging her shoulders as she meets Steve’s eyes. It looks like she’s almost challenging him to try and think differently.
No matter how many times Tony has had panic attacks before he always feels the same staggering fear inside. It never gets easier although he’s now more equipped to deal with them.
Tony can feel that an IV has been inserted into his left hand once again and it itches but he has to admit the fluids it’s pumping into him have him feeling a little more human already.
“I don’t know,” Tony confesses. “I have absolutely no idea. You think I don’t ask myself that every day? Why am I here? Why not Peter? Why is it me instead of him?”
Steve takes Tony to a baseball game, thinking that the setting is casual enough for a first friendly outing. It’s not a major league game and Steve thinks they will have time to talk without it being too serious. However, their conversation never goes past some casual small talk and most often than not some unsettling silences fill the space between the two of them.
Steve’s face reflects the confusion he’s feeling plainly: his brow is furrowed, his tongue peeks through his lips like it always does when he focuses hard on something, his eyes are closed like he’s looking deeply into himself.
Tony gives a small shrug in reply, turning his head back to look across the lake once more instead of looking at Steve.
“You made a decision when you took on the role of Ronin and that decision has consequences. You will face those consequences, Clint, I will make sure of that,” Natasha states. “But you think I went through all this trouble to get you back just because of that? I just wanted my best friend back. I wanted you here with me so we could support each other.”
“It’s still pretty early,” Tony informs him after looking at the digital clock next to the television set and seeing the numbers 6:27AM reflected back at him. “Maybe we both could use a bit more sleep.”
“I know you’re not excited for this party and I’ve known it since the topic first came up,” Steve continues making his point. “I just want to know why you’re not saying anything about it to the others.”
But then Tony looks at things a little closer, reads the signs twice over. Steve still has a tight grip on his hand, he has even intertwined their fingers. Their noses are still touching and Steve hasn't moved his body away.
Still coughing lightly Tony makes a vague gesture and hold his hand out waiting for Steve to hand him the bottle.
Questions after questions are flying around in Tony’s head, morphing and evolving into full mysteries, when the door to the bathroom opens and Steve steps out of it, surrounded by a cloud of steam.
Tony becomes the first person to call Steve a riot in bed. Steve’s been with other people before, a few, not many, and none of them ever had any complaints. The way Tony speaks about it, though, is something Steve will never get used to. The words Tony whispers in his ear when they’re together, the compliments he pronounces as they’re laying in bed panting while they try to catch their breath, are something Steve won’t ever repeat in public.
Steve has to press the right button again to illuminate the screen when it turns off so he can continue to stare at the picture.
Tony blows off the candles as he looks at Steve’s, Rhodey’s and Natasha’s grinning faces. His only thought as the fire flickers out is how he just wants to see more of that joy painted on their faces everyday.
Most times the texts don’t even require a response from him, they’re just silly little commentary on things the bots do or annoyed complaints about the press or business rivals or some of SI’s shareholders. Nevertheless, Steve has gotten used to always replying to Tony promptly if he has a chance, and, now that they’re approaching half a year of dating, Steve finds himself more and more drawn to being the one to start messaging conversations with Tony.
For the first time in probably all of his life -or at least since he was a small child- Tony wakes up at the same time every day and goes to sleep before midnight every night. He doesn’t lock himself away for days at his workshop and if there are things that require more attention than normal from him someone always makes sure he takes breaks, is fed and keeps a healthy balance on things.
“Just give me the word and this can go back to where it came from and we’ll try it again some other time. Or say the word and it’s yours again. Not that it ever stopped being.”
It’s nothing Tony couldn’t have figured out on his own, it’s not an Earth shattering revelation, but it is of major importance just the same.
He doesn’t force Tony’s head closer, he just buries his fingers in Tony’s smooth curls and runs circles on Tony’s scalp. The pressure makes Tony moan deeply and the sound awakens an all-consuming heat in Steve, a burn that starts in his veins and travels all through his body.
Tony knocks softly but firmly on the door and brings his ear closer to the wood to try and catch any response that could come from the inside of the room. Tony doesn't hear anything but he’s unsure if that is because there is nothing to be heard. He brings his hand to the doorknob and turns it carefully until the door opens. Tony doesn't open the door fully, just enough to be able to look inside the room, towards the bed and then the desk. There is no one there and there is no sign that Steve has been here before during the evening.
At the moment, Tony thinks if anyone were to be granted a look at them from the outside, all they’d see is two adversaries, two clearly divided sides going one against the other. Tony is desperate to break that illusion and bring them back to the same side, back to being partners and having each other’s backs in all battles and wars.
But now, living with Natasha, Steve and Bruce at the Compound means participating in a lot more shared meals than he ever expected and it means being treated to a lot more home-cooked meals than he has had in decades.
As time passes Tony feels his eyes start to drop, his eyelids growing heavy, and at some point after 3:10 AM -the last time his eyes drift over to the clock and check the time- he must doze off because next thing he knows he wakes up slouched down on the living room couch as Pepper whispers his name and pushes a strand of hair away from his forehead.
“What a poor excuse for a super soldier,” Tony says, looking over his shoulder at Steve who just flaps a hand in his direction but doesn't deign to give him a verbal response.
Tony turns his head to look at Rhodey and finds him already watching him. Their gazes lock and Rhodey lifts his left eyebrow, a question clearly written in his features but also a go ahead for Tony to lead the situation.
Steve’s steps get louder and louder as he gets closer to Tony. Tony opens his eyes just in time to see Steve crunching down so he’s eye-level with him. Steve leans forward and rests his elbows on the edge of the mattress as he looks Tony in the eye.
But Natasha’s patience is visibly running thin and Tony decides to intervene to give her a much deserved break as she brings her thumb and index finger to press high on the bridge of her nose.
Steve lowers his gaze and hopes the warmth he can feel in his cheeks hasn't transformed into a blush that is too visible.
When Nebula comes into his room, Rhodey has plopped back into his seat and is tapping away at his tablet, most likely sending an email to one of his military contacts trying to solve one issue or another.
Tony uses his right hand to run soothing circles on Steve’s back, working with some of the things that have made Tony feel better in the past in the moments when things have seemed too out of control and his shoulders had wanted to crumble under the world’s weight.
“Well, thank you,” Tony says, lowering his eyes to his pasta and pushing it around the plate a little. “Pasta is really the only thing I’m good at cooking so at least there are a lot of ways in which you can make it.”
Every few seconds a sniff and a wet sound leave Steve’s nose and throat respectively as he tries to take in air. He doesn’t appear to be successful at it because even Tony can feel how little air is making its way towards Steve’s lungs at the moment.
Tony has stayed quiet about the situation for the most part. He’s not sure Natasha or Clint -but most importantly Natasha- would like any contribution he could make. He’s not sure he’s even entitled to make any sort of comment about it, given his past and his own track record, anyway. Sometimes he thinks he came away too unscathed for some of his sins. Other times, more often than not while discussing things with his psychologist in therapy, he thinks he’s probably paid more than enough for them.
He stays silent and waits for Steve to continue because if they’re going to be having this conversation Tony is in no condition to be bearing the heavy weight of it.
The first several minutes are filled with small talk, mostly Pepper suggesting some of the restaurants dishes to him. A silence falls upon them as the waiter comes back again, this time to write down their food orders, and then leaves, leaving them both alone and with nothing to do but really talk or else the silence will still be keeping them company.
at around mid afternoon. Steve chuckles lightly and then goes on uploading his selfie to the conversation.
She turns away promptly and soon enough her and Rhodey have left the room, leaving behind Steve and Tony still laid down on the bean bag chair, only this time there is a little more space between their bodies.
Tony swallows, trying to calm his dry throat. “So what—” Tony clears his throat. “What are you doing here so early?”
“I want you to have the best birthday,” Steve declares. “I don’t want you to have to do something you’re not feeling up to.”
Tony brings the spoon over to his mouth and eats the spoonful of ice cream, letting out a pleased hum after swallowing.
It’s not that Steve doesn’t have authority to speak for the Avengers as an enterprise. Even though they’ve gone through many ups and downs and they’re now only a speck of what they once were Tony still holds Steve as a leader in his mind and he knows the rest of the group does too.
It’s after the second minute has gone by and Tony has grown tired of counting seconds in his head that he makes the decision to leave even if that feels somehow like being the one to surrender.
Steve listens attentively, like he always does where Tony’s concerned, and makes a mental note to chastise Tony for being up this late -just in case Tony thinks Steve hasn’t noticed-. He also reminds himself to ask Tony about the shareholders meeting he had had that morning, whether Pepper had liked her birthday present or not, and he’ll make sure to sneak in as many “I miss you-s” as possible in between all that.
“You never annoy me, I love it when you come to the shop even if I am sometimes too distracted to tell you.” Tony promises. “And I missed you too.” This time it’s Steve’s turn to blush. “I promise that I won’t spend another night away from you in at least a week. Deal?”
“It’s not really logical, or something that I can explain but,” Tony’s voice turns into a whisper. “ I guess we have never been that easy to explain either.”
And if there’s one thing he knows it’s that. Pepper loves him and he loves her even if they don’t have the best track record at loving each other.
The last time Steve had seen Tony’s phone his lock-screen had shown a picture Steve himself had taken. It had been a photo of Tony and Peter holding up Peter’s first place trophy from a state-wide science competition the teenager had participate in and that Steve and Tony had gone to to support him.
Tony starts to stand up when a hand settles on his knee, stopping his progress. Tony looks at the hand and then follows the arm to end up looking at Steve, whose face is set in a concerned expression.
The first time they both got there the place looked morose and lugubrious but Tony made sure that from then onwards the place would be fit for them to make a visit every once in a while, employing some staff to take care of its upkeep when they go for a relatively long period of time without stepping foot in it.
Before Tony can complain, however, Steve’s hands move to the buttons on Tony’s shirt and Tony quickly gets with the program and helps Steve undress him. He’s quickly down to his underwear and Tony would mourn the loss of a sensual stripping down if it wasn’t for the fact that he knows he’ll have time for that another time.
Steve had, not surprisingly, been waiting for him on the helipad, and by the way he had slammed his body into Tony as soon as he had stepped a foot on solid ground, the days spent apart had affected him in just about the same way.
“This is about you. It’s all about you,” Natasha emphasizes, bringing her finger to poke at Clint’s chest. “About the things you’ve been doing since the Decimation. You think Laura would be proud? You think your kids would be proud?”
And as terrifying and uncomfortable as it is to think about it, Nebula has also become somewhat of an expert at reading Tony. She knows when to push him to keep trying to find a solution to their problems and she knows when to let him go to that dark place in his mind where all hope is lost.
That last part is merely whispered, almost just mouthed. Tony feels his hand trembling and it takes him a couple of seconds to realize he’s not the one shaking; Steve is. It takes him another few seconds to notice Steve is laughing and not crying.
The minute Tony’s eyes set on Steve there is a feeling of serendipity tying around its heart. This is Tony’s safest space and it seems likely that it is one of Steve’s safest spaces too.
Little by little Steve has grown used to his presence all around the Tower and his awe about JARVIS’ existence has turned into gratitude for him many times.
The whole process takes less than a minute and Tony doesn't realize at first that it has ended. He stays seated in the same position, looking at Bruce, now completely turned into the Hulk. Bruce’s pants have stretched with his body without having ripped and Tony figures that it is one more think Bruce must have worked on during this whole “experiment”.
She’s there making coffee when Tony walks in and when she turns around to face him the bags under her eyes are more pronounced that Tony has ever seen them. Her eyes look glossy and the redness under her nose gives away just how much she’s been crying.
“He kind of would have hated to hear that,” Rhodes informs him. “Tony didn’t do these things… He wasn’t Iron Man for the heroics or the glory… He was just…”
Tony sits up in bed with a gasp, the dream clinging to him like a stubborn toddler that won’t allow to be put down. Peter’s name tastes funny in Tony’s mouth and he isn’t sure whether he pronounced it in his sleep or if he said it as he woke up.
When he’s done in the bathroom Tony walks back into the bedroom and sees that Pepper is still in the same spot he left her.
“I need you to hang tight, Tony. I’m getting you back home but I need you to hang tight just a little longer, okay?”
“The option is always there,” Valkyrie mutters but Natasha pretends not to have heard her and Tony thinks they all decide to follow her lead.
Through it all Steve works very hard to never be left alone with Tony. It hurts in ways he can’t even understand but it feels easier than the alternative.
The images fade away as soon as Steve pronounces the sentence and he turns around to face Pepper and Rhodey again. Their hands are joined over the table as if they're both taking strength from the other and their faces both show tear tracks.
“You’ve been on the workshop for almost two days, Tony. You need to sleep.” Steve pronounces. The blonde moves away from the bed and walks towards the closet entering the room that he was once scandalized about (
“I know we said we have time and we don’t have to talk about everything today but there is one more thing I want to apologize for.”
Tony is Tony and he can’t help himself so he takes a step back and gives Steve a complete once over before saying, “I get now what you said about me looking good in your clothes, sweet cheeks, because wow are you rocking my t-shirt.”
“And if I may, Captain, we could try to create some protocols and routines together ourselves,” JARVIS offers. “I could show you some of the research myself and Sir did and point you towards some of the things Sir found most useful.”
Natasha comes in as his conversation is ending and she only catches him saying, “That’s fine, Pep. Talk to you later.”
Natasha leaves for a while to retrieve her own tablet so she can work on composing emails and strategies while sitting next to him.
Natasha’s bottom lip starts to tremble and she has to bite it to stop it doing so. Her eyes look glossy under the shop’s LED lights but Natasha closes them before any tears can escape from them. When she releases her lip Tony can see that it shows the slight indent of her teeth from how hard she was biting it. She opens her eyes and takes a deep breath.
The question makes Tony focus more intensely at Steve, his brow furrowed and his bottom lip caught between his lips. Steve looks back and forth a couple times between Tony’s eyes and his lips before catching himself and settling his gaze in the space between Tony’s eyebrows.
Bruce looks towards the direction Clint took. “You really think it will help? We don’t even know what he’s going to say.”
His eyes are still closed but through the grogginess that still clings to his mind he makes an effort to move his arms. His whole body feels overheated and the minute Tony manages to get his arms free of the covers it feels like instant relief. The cool air feels nice on his hands and some of it makes its way through his sleeves, and down his torso.
Steve’s chair squeaks unpleasantly against the tiled floor when he pushes it back and stands up abruptly. His hand rips away from Tony’s hands, leaving them hovering awkwardly in the air.
Tony has to take a two week-long trip to California for Stark Industries business but Steve keeps him updated on most thing that go on back in New York.
“I know there’ll be things we need to do if we bring him back and I promise we’ll deal with that, Rhodey. I’ll work with whoever I need to work with,” Natasha assures.
The reprise doesn't last long, however. By the time it’s been a week since Tony and Steve have had any kind of meaningful contact -be it in person or through the telephone- Tony can pick up Steve’s confusion and impatience in each one of their short and rare interactions.
sorry. We’ve both had to apologize for many things but if there’s one apology I want you to believe it’s this one. I am sorry for not telling you how your parents died and I am sorry you had to find out that way. Please believe me.”
Rhodey comes back towards the kitchen island, cookie plate in his right hand. He deposits it in front of Tony and immediately takes one of them between his index finger and his thumb and offers it to Tony. Tony blows lightly on it and takes a small bite of it. The cookie has been baked to perfection. It’s soft and chewy, just like Tony likes them, the chocolate chips melting in Tony’s mouth before he even starts chewing.
There is a tug, a pull, a magnetic force stronger than any other power Tony has ever known that wills him to pull away from Nebula and rest his entire body against Steve’s chest.
“Steve,” Tony whispers, feeling a little dumbstruck. “You wouldn’t have made things worse, I promise.”
Tony doesn't think he has to remind Bruce of some of their unorthodox experiments and the problems they had brought.
Tony can now see that the pants do, indeed, drag through the floor swallowing his feet, and that the shirt nearly falls from one of his shoulders.
“Tony brought me here for the first time,” Pepper comments as Steve sips on the best milkshake he’s ever tried in his life -strawberry, raspberry, white chocolate and honey-. “He loved going places  that are like this: small, family owned, kind of off the grid.”
He gets a little reward in the form of Steve’s admittance of his doings the same day he suits up as Iron Man for the first time in months.
Pepper insists Tony should get medically checked out even when Tony reassures her firmly that he’s perfectly fine, and, in an amazing display of her resourcefulness, a team of doctors appear in the building in less than ten minutes. All their tests and checking confirm Tony’s assessment and when they finally leave the premises Steve realizes how late it has gotten and deems it appropriate to leave Tony to rest after all the excitement of the day.
And alas why they had been finding more and more Disney movies to play, even if they could hardly ever agree and they always spent at least 10 minutes trying to convince the other their choice was the legitimate one until they gave up and finally settled things by a game of rock, paper scissors of which Tony was 99% of times always the loser.
He crosses paths with Pepper in the foyer. She's about to exit the building just as he’s walking inside and she changes her trajectory to reach him.
“I didn’t fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while a Bleecker Street magician gave away the stone. That’s what happened. There was no fight.”
“I didn’t say that,” Bruce explains, looking apologetic and also maybe a little offended that Clint would think him capable of thinking that.
Steve doesn't move his head but he squeezes Tony’s hand almost hard enough to hurt until he relents his strength and just holds tight enough that Tony feels grounded and he hopes Steve does too.
Steve’s kisses had started out ferocious and hungry, raw in the most visceral way. Tony hadn’t even felt the cold for the whole half hour they had spent kissing outside, Steve’s warm body keeping him sheltered for the whole of it.
“Paper football,” Rhodey murmurs in the background but his voice gets lost in Nebula’s indignant reply.
They’re having dinner with Steve and Natasha and there’s a certain feeling in the air like maybe things aren’t right but they soon will be. Like this is how things were always meant to happen. Like fate was really testing them all along and the final grade will soon be here.
In recent times, every time he has stayed in New York, either by himself or both Pepper and him have stayed at the old Stark mansion.
Tony looks pointedly at the glass walls of the recovery room but he doesn’t comment on it, knowing they’re all way too preoccupied with the fate of the world at their hands to notice insignificant details like that.
Rhodey looks up from his tablet at the same time that Tony opens his eyes from where he’d been trying to catch another nap and ward away the headache that is building from his forehead to the back of his neck.
but I maybe suspected. I just… I was deep in denial. Still am, a little, not going to lie,” Steve explains ruefully.
He comes in looking like his night hasn't been an ounce better than Tony’s. The serum allows for him to be comfortable with very little sleep for long periods of time, but that doesn’t mean Steve enjoys it. The last few months have taught Tony what signs to look for: the tightness of Steve’s shoulders, the redness around his eyes from Steve’s constant rubbing at them, the slight dragging of his feet as he walks, the way he pops his ears every few minutes like his body is betraying him by not properly working.
The sun hasn’t even risen yet and the Compound is mostly still asleep, or if there is any activity it’s still being confined to everyone’s private quarters.
They don’t say anything, the only audible sound their combined breaths, a little out of sync and a little too loud in the quietness of the room.
In the blink of an eye Tony grabs Steve’s phone from where he was still holding it with only one of his hands. Steve pronounces a weak and not very believable protest as Tony’s hand that’s not holding Steve’s phone goes towards the back pocket of his faded blue jeans.
He bends his back and rotates his shoulders until he hears them crack to relieve himself of the stiffness accumulated in them.
“Hey, Pep,” he starts. “Actually… Hey, everyone. I don’t kn- I don’t even know who will see this recording. I don’t even know who’s—“ His voice breaks and his eyes water but he closes them firmly, refusing to let the tears fall. “I don’t even know who’s still there.”
He’s been holding onto unfounded expectations and they’ve all just shattered in his hands from how tightly he was squeezing them.
Steve’s breaths are quieter now than before but they still feel terribly loud in the stillness that surrounds them.
“I also promised to show you Europe and I’ve only shown you some of it,” Tony says, evoking a promise tacitly made, a promise he’s taken to heart just to make Steve as happy as possible. “We’re missing Vienna and Prague. We need to go to Poland and even further north to Norway and Sweden. It’ll be nice to have a home base here and I want it to be this. This right here. This can be home, too.”
He’s feeling in the mood now and because he’s gotten so much better over the years at not denying himself things that will make him truly happy, Steve clicks the few buttons he needs to press to take him to the folder he created where he stores all of his favorite pictures to start going through some of them.
“The point is I know Tony would have ended up loving you,” Pepper says. “I also wish it could have been the three of us and him.”
It shouldn’t happen like it does, but the six month anniversary of the Decimation goes by completely unnoticed and unremembered at the Avengers Compound.
Tony studies these little bits and pieces of life as Steve does as well and it’s impossible to deny that Steve has made a home for himself down here too.
Steve sighs in relief, like his concern for what Tony’s reaction would be to the revelation had been pressing down on his chest for weeks and he’s now finally able to breathe properly.
Clint joins Natasha, Rhodey, Steve and Tony for lunch and Tony can see in everyone’s faces how baffled they are.
Steve nods at her but it feels particularly difficult to look her in the eyes so he focuses his gaze on the salt shaker that’s placed on the right side of the table.
How many more of these days will they have to live through? How many more times will they need to be painfully reminded of what they lost?
As opposed to the Thor problem, where they at least knew where he was at all times and they had someone to keep them updated as best as they could be, the problem with dealing with Clint was his constant dropping out of the face of the planet, leaving no trace to be followed. It left them adrift most of the time, incapable of forming a plan between themselves to deal with Clint when it seemed like Clint didn't want to be dealt with.
“I love you,” Steve repeats, chucking a little. “I do. I know maybe it feels sudden but the thing is, Tony… I’ve been falling in love with you for a long time. When you were gone, when we thought you were dead, I got to know you. Kind of.”
Tony can smell her before he can even hear her, her distinctive floral smell, rich and fresh. Tony knows the smell by heart, since she first started working for him, because yes, Pepper Potts is the kind of person who’s been using the same perfume for decades now, something about it a personal trademark.
“I was just making myself a salad but I can make us something else,” Tony says, putting down the knife he was using to slice the vegetables.
Steve halts in his movements and turns to look at Natasha, who is seated on the floor stretching her legs.
Only a couple of weeks ago Steve wouldn’t have asked the question in the same manner that he is doing now, concerned and caring but also showing a hint of impatience, of edge, most likely based on Tony’s completely closed-off demeanor. Steve would have most likely waited indefinitely at Tony’s side, possibly in absolute silence, getting null acknowledgement from Tony who’d have, after a few hours, simply stood and walked away, leaving Steve and his non-intrusiveness behind.
Tony opens his eyes and then closes them again immediately when the brightness of the room hits him full force. Based upon the light it must already be past 7 in the morning and Tony is confused. FRIDAY always regulates the amount of light that passes through his bedroom windows and she knows he prefers to sleep surrounded by total darkness. He never needs to tell her to make the glass in the windows opaque, she always does it on her own.
