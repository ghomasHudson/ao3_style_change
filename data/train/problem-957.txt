"What are you blokes doing clear the hell out here?" John asked the main three.
"Are- oh god," Mycroft put his head in his hands and then drew them down until the tips of his fingers pressed over his lips. He sighed deeply. "Are you leaving my brother, John?"
"You never gave me the chance to like you. You have been rude. You have been possessive. You have been clingy. And even if you hadn't been any of those things, you are still twenty and I am still thirty-five!" John's breath was coming out in hard pants as he fought down the anger that had begun to boil over.
"I played clarinet in school." John smiled.
Which was why John was sitting in the library, his leg bouncing up and down nervously, his heel tapping against the leg of the chair as he waited for Sherlock so they could start their French lesson.
quickly," John panted.
Sherlock lifted his head a little and looked down at John. "Why 'thank you'?"
who would care that that cunt Sherlock kneed him the bollocks.
"And as for the notion that another stalker might come after me, may I remind you that my meddling, interfering, older brother has provided the security for this trip, I doubt I'll be able to sneeze without him knowing." Sherlock bumped his shoulder into John's. "We'll be fine, John," he whispered.
Just two days from Christmas and Sherlock was getting desperate. He cornered John after breakfast.
"I'm guessing that relationship didn't last long," Greg commented, dryly.
"I knew you'd get it," he said fondly.
"They certainly do," Mr Holmes agreed.
"I want you to suck my cock, just not tonight," John explained as he lathered up some lube on his fingers.
Sherlock barked out a bitter laugh, "No, he broke my heart."
"As it is coming to be a tradition, I have written a piece for John's first dance. Again."
Sally glared at him a moment and then yanked the phone out of his hand. She angrily hit the call button. She tapped her foot as it rang through.
"My full name is William Sherlock Scott Holmes," the publicist replied. "It was just the easiest."
"I can promise I'll try." He turned to walk away and then turned back. "Thank you for not just killing me or shipping me off somewhere dismal."
"Whatever," Sherlock said, waving her protest away. "If you want to come to one of our performances, I'll make sure to leave two tickets under your name at the will call."
"You do now. Someone who understands better than a man trying to leave Purgatory. A man who loves you."
"I'm not sure I get you, mate," Greg said.
"What was that?" John asked, setting the games down on a nearby table.
"I thought that was filled with old detritus; broken childhood toys, torn and falling apart books, trophies and ribbons for things no longer cared about," Sherlock murmured. "Things like that."
Greg laughed. "I know just the place."
He turned to Mary and opened his mouth to admonish her. She gave him these big doe eyes and pouted.
"What?" Sherlock bit out.
John put the book on his lap as he read the reviews. "Holy shit! That was from this morning. Where are they getting the book to read it?"
Critics raved for
John nodded and then pressed his hand to his head.
"So I'll do it," John said, draining his beer.
"I always thought that I wanted a normal life. A wife, children, a white-picket fence. You taught me that I didn't need that. I may have wanted it, but I didn't need it. I needed the life you gave me. You keep saying how much I have saved you, but the real miracle is how much you have saved me. I will probably never know what made you look at me and say to yourself 'he'll do'. But I can't help be grateful that you did."
"Thank you," Sherlock told him, putting everything he felt for this former soldier in those two simple words.
"Mrs Holmes? John Watson," John greeted sticking out his hand.
Sherlock smiled. "Well, he does love to be of use."
Sherlock looked at the bloom mournfully. "Perhaps it should be yellow or white."
Bill laughed. Bill Murray (not the film star) was John's shiny new literary agent. He specialized in former veterans, and especially war or battle stories written by said veterans. And he had picked John. Which still blew John's mind.
"Indeed," Mycroft purred, a smirk coloring his tone. "Though considering you said the meeting went badly, I wasn't expecting him to contact us at all. To say it came as a complete surprise would be an understatement."
After dinner, they sat on the sofa sipping the scotch Sherlock had brought. They were sitting so close that John could have sworn that they were cuddling.
So what have I been doing while typing up this wonderful story? Other little johnlock ideas, just fun little jaunts of writing exercises. And well...writing some Good Omens fics. But GO fics are my treat for writing Sherlock stories (not that they're a chore, they are just my main fandom and deserves my full attention even if GO has sparked interest for the moment). So I guess what I'm say is we'll see what the future holds.
"I need your help," he explained, as she twittered at his lack of manners.
"It's Wiggins, my PA," he explained as he accepted the call. "He knows not to call unless it's a emergency.
Sherlock strolled into his room and hastily got dressed. He threw on his coat and gathered up his wallet, mobile phone, and keys. He was out the door before he could change his mind. This was the solution. He just had to have the guts to do it.
"Hey, Sherlock," the former soldier greeted warmly. "What's up?"
"Is that a challenge, Sherlock Holmes?" John growled.
John buried his head into Sherlock's chest, the shorter man's arms tucked between them. There was silence for a few moments, before Sherlock spoke.
Just then a group of kids passed by calling out, "Nerd!"
"Can you ensure that such a thing won't occur?" Sherlock pressed.
Anthea jumped up and tried to see over the crowd. When she finally managed to catch sight of him she said, "I'd tap that, he's hot."
The con man stopped in his tracks and turned to Sherlock with a look of pure shock.
Sherlock got in on the passenger side, fidgeting. John just shook his head and got behind the wheel.
He went to the buffet table, pleased to see that Mycroft was as generous here as he had been in Sussex. And to his immense enjoyment, the table had all his favorites. Sherlock must have had a hand in the selections, considering how well the man knew John.
As they backed up through the narrow road, John settled back into the seat and sighed. This was the worst Christmas, ever.
"Can you check it for me?" John was saying when Sherlock's brain had come back on. He was leaning away from Sherlock, having pulled down his collar so Sherlock could get a look at the shoulder in question.
"So what is it that you do, exactly?" John asked.
They were dancing so close, they were almost breathing the same air. John wasn't sure what made him look up just then, but he wished he hadn't. Sherlock was standing at the door to the club and he looked stunned. Horrified, even. John went to go to him, but he was jerked back by a rather large hand. He was whirled around and found himself face to face with Mary's Marine.
Sherlock chuckled. "Thank you, but no. He doesn't deserve the attention. No, John. I'm quite happy where I am at now. I didn't need to go chasing that past any longer. I have you."
this thing! That terrified him.
Sherlock stared at him like he'd grown an extra head.
"You're late," she repeated.
Okay, so he knew where that thought had come from. He was seriously attracted to the dancer. Even though Sherlock had been in a perfectly tailored suit, John couldn’t help but imagine him in tights and nothing else. It was a real problem.
They passed David's Jag and found Mycroft's rented Land Rover closer to the road sign that let people know that they were entering private property than to the actual road itself. The five men dug into to the snowbank, careful not to damage the vehicle.
"Oh yeah, I'm seeing someone," John replied with a smirk.
." Sherlock stormed off.
I just hope this chapter makes up for the super long wait.
Sherlock gulped and nodded. He missed the heat of John's palm and his mind helpfully supplied other ways that hand could be touching him.
"That, and the head publicist was actually incompetent," Sherlock said with a grin. "He was out my first day as intern to his office and Mrs Hudson came in."
Sherlock and John stood in front of the official performing the ceremony, waiting for him to begin. They stared at each other like the other was a gift and a revelation, their perfect fit.
He threw his arms around the publicist, who chuckled and hugged him back. "I thought you weren't going to make it."
"You might not be my brother's keeper, Dr Watson, but surely it hasn't escaped even your notice that he tends to eat and sleep more when you are around than when you are absent?"
"So why William Scott?" John asked.
Sherlock nodded. "When they were first published, they were credited to Frank Hudson, Mrs Hudson's then husband."
Mr Lyons looked Bertie dead in the eye, "Unless he beat your arse, I'm not interested."
"What did you want to do?"
Just as John was finishing his dessert, Sherlock got up and left. He came back a few minutes later dressed only in his bathrobe and gently drew John to his feet. John without question followed his lover and was surprised when instead of the bedroom, they had made their way to the bathroom.
"I'll head out first thing in the morning," Sherlock told him.
John shook his head; it was nice of her to offer, but he didn't want to get her in trouble.
Mycroft's eyes blazed. "I have no need for your pity," he snapped.
Have fun! I always do, especially reading your lovely comments. :D
John was grateful that Friday was here at last. Mrs Hudson had teased him and Sherlock about their "date" at every opportunity. Despite both men repeatedly telling her that it wasn't
Just then a rather large boom shook the house enough to make the chandeliers shudder and Sherlock dropped to his knees to cover his ears.
"Hey, I've been looking for you everywhere," Greg said by way of greeting.
John kicked maliciously at the plastic snowman the surgery had put up to make it look more festive. This was the third time
"Of all the days..." Greg murmured and then shook his head. He sat down and looked Sherlock square in the eye. "What's up?"
John was impressed. He wavered between starting to eat now and waiting for Mycroft to return.
The young woman smirked.
"I'm a rugby player who knew going into the sport that I'd be retired at thirty-five and would need a post-sport career. Not a lot of people know. Mike does. Went to med school with him; my sister, of course; and now you."
Greg blinked. That was the last thing he wanted to do. Even if Mycroft was speaking to him, which he wasn't.
Greg cocked his head to the side. "You still get together to watch games with your old rugby team, right?"
"I have another surprise for you, but I left it in my luggage at Mycroft's, so it will have to wait until the after party," Sherlock said.
But of course, John hadn't heard a damn thing from Sherlock. After a couple of weeks of trying to get ahold of him, John had given up.
John cleared his throat. "Right. That night produced a change in me. A shift. Subtle, but very crucial. I shifted my priorities from what I thought I wanted, a normal life, to what I truly needed, a lifetime of adventures next to Sherlock Holmes." John wiped a tear from his eye using the hand that held Sherlock's and then Sherlock kissed it away from their joined hands.
"Hmm," Sherlock murmured into John's ear. "That was a good cure for the boredom, but I'm hotter than ever!"
"Please, John. Don't tease."
Sherlock buried his head into John's shoulder, "I blame you for that."
"I-I'll think about it," Sherlock promised.
"What?" John asked. "Why not?"
Sherlock leaned in close, "And what if I decide to play for keeps?"
"When I took medical courses, I had to do one year of a psych rotation, which considering I was still playing, took closer to two years. So, yes. I am far better qualified than a ballet director and his politician husband."
What's next? Well it's supposed to be Curses! But I keep stalling out on it. But now that I don't have an excuse not to write it, it might help getting it out. However, this means that in the mean time you will most likely see more of my Good Omens stories being put up. I have a different beta for those and with how fast I was churning out chapters for this story, I haven't had time to get them edited. So now that this story is done, I should be able to devote the time to getting those edited and posted.
"Why, I thought you were out?" Greg asked.
"Getting completely pissed, isn't that what you're supposed to do at parties?" Mycroft snarled.
So...you'll notice there has been a slight increase in chapters. By one to be exact. And that is because after all the lovely comments I just HAD to put in Sherlock's take down of Jim. But it did kinda alter things a bit for the next chapter. But not a lot.
Greg shrugged. "You were upset, it's fine. And since he's out there playing, I'd say he's fine, too."
"Go to sleep, John," the publicist chuckled. "We'll talk more tomorrow."
Thanks as always to my wonderful beta, who just makes everything better. If you know who I am, then you know who she is.
"But you told me that the other party had canceled, when I arrived at a quarter til," Mr Watson said, his frown deepening.
John lowered his arms, stumbling back into a bookshelf, and leaned heavily against it to keep his knees from buckling.
They were still dating. It was one of the reasons he turned down their invite to come out for Christmas. He couldn't take seeing them so god damned happy and raining on their parade wouldn't be a very brotherly thing to do.
"Not likely," Sherlock bit out through gritted teeth.
"That thing is going to fall and smother us in our sleep," he said, deadpan.
"I'm glad," Mr Holmes replied, "and please call me Mycroft. Mr Holmes makes me feel so old."
"Uh...no. I did eat foie gras once, though," Greg teased.
"Annoyingly hot," Anthea retorted. "Besides, he is obviously interested in you."
John typed out his response, ignoring Mrs Hudson's knowing looks. "Too late.-JHW"
Greg half shrugged. "I merely took up John's suggestion of evening the score." He poked at his food, a small smile on his face as he thought about how hard Mycroft had laughed.
"I came here because I knew it would ghost free," Sherlock murmured. "All the other spirits in the house decided that they wanted to come and thank me for getting rid of Milverton and Mary." Sherlock rubbed his temples.
Before Mike rang off, he said, "I just wanted you to know that I kicked David and Mary out after you left."
"They can't do anything until the rain stops," Sherlock replied.
"She must have been so disappointed having two boys."
Sherlock blushed. "Shall we go on?"
Mycroft smiled at him, "You know, you can't go around buying me guitars every time I'm pissed at you."
Sherlock waved his hand non-nonchalant. "Just make sure you put them back where you found them."
"Was?" Mycroft asked.
John had been tempted to "forget" the cane in the cab, but he decided that it would better if he "forgot" it at the restaurant after dinner, so Sherlock could see.
Sherlock gulped, but did what he was told. Soon he wasn't Prince Siegfried, who sacrificed his life to be with his love forever, but Sherlock Holmes, a pretty dancer, who was in love with a rugby player named John Watson.
. I honestly don't know how he felt." He winced. He was starting to sound like a Jane Austen heroine.
"Ah, John," Sherlock said turning around. "Good, you're home. Go get changed. I have a lead on her purse and her murderer."
"What?" John argued. "He'd be perfect."
Thanks again to my awesome beta, Old Ping Hai. She really tried to help in cutting this chapter down to fit the previous chapters length. But I was way too choosey. But I hope you all enjoy!
"Oh, Sherlock," Mrs Hudson said fluttering her hands. But as she did so, it knocked Sherlock's coffee out of his hand and onto the floor where the hot liquid splashed on his legs.
Bill took them off and handed them out to the nearest person. Molly squeaked and took the glasses from him.
"Apparently the Moran side of Moran & Moriarty Prints showed up and doused everything Jim had planned with cold water. Seriously, the man walked out of there looking for all the world like a drowned cat."
The more Sherlock talked, the harder John gripped the edges of their table. By the time Sherlock had finished explaining, John had a white-knuckle grip on it.
"That would do it, yeah," John agreed.
The publicist merely shrugged.
"Good luck," Mycroft said.
"Really?" Mycroft asked, moving in close.
John looked up and what he saw took his breath away. Sherlock was bedraggled. His hair was matted to his skull, his fancy clothes were ruined and clung to Sherlock's far too lean frame. He looked so vulnerable.
Sherlock roused slightly, "I don't believe in coincidence, if that's what you're asking; the universe is rarely so lazy."
John pulled out the bottle of wine he had been saving all year and poured them each a glass, bringing Sherlock's to where the detective WAS carving the turkey. Sherlock put down the fork and took a brief sip.
Mycroft blushed, "And maybe you aren't as vile as I thought." He took a deep breath and then leaned over to kiss Greg.
"They what?" John asked in horror.
"What do you mean the printer says the images for 'Kellen's Den' are wrong? I've sent them the same size files I always have. How can they be wrong?"
It had taken John a lot of work and maybe just a bit of emotional blackmail to get Sherlock to even agree to come out with John and his friends for John's birthday party. But now that he was out, he wished he had taken Sherlock's advice and stayed home.
And sure enough, when Sherlock Darling walked into the shop with the usual coffee and raspberry scones for Mrs Hudson, there was that little self-satisfied grin he always got when he was right. He opened his mouth to say "I told you so" when Mrs Hudson came hurrying over to greet him.
"Great," Mycroft said hiding his blush from the other students and without looking back added, "Now, I'll go show it to the rest of the team."
way possible. I'm happy where I am. Very much so."
John looked back into the room. "Thank you, but no. He'll go right back to sleep once we get home. And if I can't take care of a sleeping detective, I wouldn't be much of a doctor now, would I?"
There were some other mumbled words from the official and the exchanging of rings, then finally after what felt like ages, the official pronounced them husbands and that they could finally kiss.
He was dressed in a black suit with a purple shirt. She couldn't stop staring at the shirt, it was so tight that the buttons were threatening to burst free. She found herself willing them to do so. Sherlock coughed and her eyes drifted up that long column of throat to those pale, Cupid's bow lips and those cheek bones. She reached out, but Sherlock mistook the gesture and shook her hand.
Greg looked up and smiled. "Hey, Sherlock. What's up?"
"Speaking of phones," Mike replied, "there is no way that your phone could go from being able to text me to dead in mere seconds. How'd you do it?" He jutted out his his chin.
A minor word; Greg knowing about John BEFORE his conversation with Mycroft is NOT a plot hole. Greg lovingly lied to his husband to give him the reaction he so richly deserved. But I don't like putting "he lied". I think it pulls you out of the story unless it's done for comedic or dramatic effect.
"John," Greg warned, "I get your enthusiasm. I do. But it could seriously backfire."
"I have a very fine beauty regimen that I must follow. My skin is already in distress after using whatever it was that was in the bathroom."
a mad bastard, but there was something niggling at the back of his mind, saying that this was a bad idea.
Greg frowned at the non-sequitur, "What?"
They stood smoking for a bit before Sherlock asked, "What have you got for me?"
Stage four skin cancer. She was gone in two months.
"Do we have a deal?" Bertie asked.
Thanks to my wonderful beta, old ping hai who makes sure this stuff is all pretty for you people. :D
He watched as Sherlock hurried off and then looked at his phone. He laughed and then showed the message to Mrs Hudson.
Mike tilted his head to the side and smiled sadly, "Since before we met, I'm afraid. Car accident."
Sherlock worked his throat, trying not to cry. "He didn't know it was mine at first, but finding that out didn't change his mind. And-and he liked the kiss, too."
Sherlock had already deduced where the spare key was, and the front door stood wide open.
Greg sat down with a satisfied smirk.
"John?" Sherlock asked, his concern growing by the second.
"That was an assumption on your part," Greg replied with a smile. "I was a well-known editor when I met Mycroft, so I kept the name. I wasn't about to make him take mine, not when his belongs to the biggest publishing family in Great Britain."
John grabbed that arse and moved his cock between them. Sherlock and John groaning together. While John took his pleasure, Sherlock worked on opening his hole, using his come and sweat to prepare himself for John.
"Oh no," John said. "You tell me what it is says." His voice was low and deadly. "I really want to know what is so bloody mind-blowing that you would fob it off to your brother to deal with."
Sherlock hung his head. "I can't bring Rosie back, and Mycroft's trying to find Mary. But he says that she will only be found when she wants to be."
"I brought a candle, make it more romantic," Angelo said, beaming down at them, looking pointedly at their clasped hands.
"Good, now get out there and go snag yourself a hot rugby player," Victor insisted, all but pushing his friend out the door.
2- Soldier On!- Queer Eye fusion- Sherlock Holmes is part of the Brit Fab Five going to help "straight" guy John Watson propose to his long time girlfriend. But when John admits he's bi, it's up to the Fab Five to get John to come out to his friends, and maybe fall in love with one of their own.
Victor and Janine snickered. They all followed Sherlock out to where John was waiting for them.
Sherlock looked over at Mrs Hudson, who sighed heavily.
"Good, what else?" Sherlock asked, feeling the excitement rise.
this!"
"Shit!" Mike muttered. "Did they catch the bastard?"
Sherlock sighed and placed his head on the top of John's. "I don't feel confident about this, at all."
John popped the cranberries into the fridge to chill and began to work on the vegetables and dressing.
"Good boy," John said, stuffing the scarf in his pocket. "Down."
"When they would 'pick up' Mike, what they were really doing is going to both flats to pick me up. They'd pull up to Mike's address, wait 15 minutes and then come to my flat. When I'd be talking to him in the car, the driver assumed I was talking to myself or on the phone with my assistant. They just chalked it up to me being crazy."
"I still can't believe that he would have such a positive reaction to something that had been the object of scorn for so long," Sherlock went on. "I hadn't met anyone outside this room that had really liked it–"
"Mike?" Sherlock asked, as he set aside Brook's dossier on top of Molly's.
Sherlock's hips bucked for an entirely different reason. John rose with the movement, taking his lover's cock into his mouth.
Sherlock shrugged, trying to play it cool, "Who hasn't?"
Greg smiled, "Fair enough, but I do something that we could talk about‒"
Sherlock put on the outfit Mycroft had chosen for him. He put on the skin-tight leather trousers, and then chunky thick-soled boots with belt buckles. He pulled on the ripped v-neck tee. It was Sherlock's favorite because it had hints of silver around the rips so that it drew the eye to the bare skin underneath. Then came the tour de force. The old fashioned overcoat. It looked like something that had been pulled off the rack of a production of
From fantasymagonline.com, an interview from writer Toby Gregson and fantasy author Sherlock Holmes. Spring 2019.
Greg leaned down to check Mycroft's pupils when John came up to them.
Anthea broke into a grin. "Only good things I hope."
"Well, then," Mycroft said, astonished. "I'm grateful to him."
Hello! Third chapter this week! Aren't you the lucky devils? Not much John in this chapter, just a bit at the end.
Half the orchard was relatively normal, a bit overgrown and wild from lack of care. About what you'd expect from a haunted house. The other side, on the other hand, was filled with massive burnt and blackened stumps of what was left of the trees.
"If you're sure, Lockie," Mycroft said.
John looked up, his eyes sparkling from the thrill and asked, "You sure this is him? I mean, he doesn't look very strong. Those murdered blokes were massive, he doesn't look like he'd do much more than be annoyance for those guys."
"Like hell you don't."
Mike called out to Mary as she stood staring into the dark. She jolted as if she had been awakened from a dream and followed him to the lodge. Mike looked out into the darkness, but not seeing anything closed the door tight against the storm.
But they were right and it ended where it needed to.
"Well, you're here, for one," John rasped, before turning to sneeze into his handkerchief.
shipment of multiple books. Roughly seventy to a hundred books per shop," Sherlock bit out.
"Holy hell, that's young," John said. He thought back to Mike's comments about the book being juvenile and written by a 'rich white boy', but he didn't think Mike had been talking about an
"You could have made it difficult for me. Asked what the money was for, questioned my motives," Sherlock whispered.
"Please God, let me live," John coughed, blood welling up from his lips.
"Thank you all for coming," John began. "I know all of you think that we are here to support Sherlock's recent success-"
Mike and John rolled their eyes while Sherlock muttered something about a pig's ear. John grabbed a couple of Mycroft's bags so that Greg didn't have to carry them all. Mike helped Sherlock with the rest of their things.
"No. I saw it," he replied.
"Come again?" John questioned, feeling his temper flare.
you."
James blushed deeper and turned his head. "Sorry."
She ran out to the room John had shared with Sherlock and Mike. She found him throwing his stuff into his duffle.
John squeezed his eyes shut. "Not that, Sherlock. I've made my peace with both of those facts. Honest. I just don't have the words to describe what it is I want."
you have, Mycroft?"
"So we have all sorts here at Baker Street Academy," Mike began. "Over there we have the posh snobs."
John shivered with desire, "And who says I'm not?"
"I know, thanks, Dillon," John said.
Mycroft called his husband as soon as he got off the phone with Sherlock.
John had a vague idea what the silent ones were trying to say most of the time; but the one that haunted his bathroom, he had no idea what the hell
The one game that was surprisingly absent was Cluedo. John thought that game was mandatory for every English household. He shrugged and took his finds back to the library.
Sherlock had offered his spare room for John to rent. It was a relief to have some place to go and with the help of the minions of Sherlock's brother, Mycroft, John had moved out was before Mary came back to the flat.
"I fell in love with him," Greg said.
John took his turn, brushing his teeth and taking a quick shower. Just because the heater would last, didn't mean he had to make the others wait too long for their turn. He walked out and stopped short. Either the water was louder than he thought or the bathroom was soundproof. Because what he saw before him was Greg glaring at the now very long of people waiting to use the loo, tapping a police baton on the palm of his other hand.
Mummy tilted her head to the side and asked coolly, "Really?"
He had hoped that the meeting would convince her to stop trying to headhunt him, but it had just made her more determined.
The door to the office tore open to reveal a very worried Wiggins.
"Please," he begged again.
"It's just business, John," Sherlock implored. "It's not like that."
Sally and Sherlock were talking about their English assignment and didn't know that they were being discussed.
Mycroft grinned up at his mother, "Oh you know, just a drug den orgy. With lots of drugs and sex. Lots!"
I hate the way you drive my car
"Madder than a wet cat," Wiggins replied cheerfully.
"I'm really sorry for this, Mr Holmes," Barbara said after watching Julie leave. "What can I do to make this right?"
Sherlock helped him to his feet. "Come on, let's get you some fresh air."
The writer in John thought Sherlock looked rather like a maiden from those ridiculous romance novels. "Abandoned by her lover, she seeks the solace of her father's library, to drown herself in the tales of honorable men."
Molly frowned. She really didn't know what to make of that statement. It was just so strange.
"I would have to be completely stupid to take an offer that would be a cut in
"So rewrite it and release it again," John said.
John had promised to never leave Sherlock's side the whole night. And possibly their whole lives. The thought shook John to his core. But he'd promised.
"And well...after that I
He was derailed from that thought by a girl with long, brown hair and deep brown eyes throwing herself at him.
"It won't be like that. It'll be more like with Molly, just nudging the person in the right direction. I think he's hoping you debunk him, to be honest," Mike assured him.
"Not really," Sherlock admitted. "But if my going will prevent bigger, more expensive mistakes and get us back on track, then better me than someone else who might mess it up further."
John took it and turned the book over. "Treasure Island" was embossed on the forest green cover in faded gold lettering.
He looked out at the falling snow and sighed. He really didn't want to go without it, it's what made Christmas dinner for him. His mum's recipe was divine.
Mycroft scoffed.
"Fuck," John said from the doorway. They turned to the sound and then sprung from each other as if the other suddenly turned too hot to touch.
That wonder slipped off Sherlock's face and he grimaced. "I assume that they are releasing me tomorrow after a night of observation."
Sherlock simply shrugged.
Sherlock laughed. "I'm on my way."
Sherlock gave it a squeeze. "And you were right about people being awful. Sally wasn't really my friend and Bertie had a bet with Jim that he'd fuck me."
John looked them over, "They can't be that bad."
"Right..." John grumbled. "No pressure
There's also a little wink to Houdini and Doyle. See if you can spot it. It's actually pretty obvious. ;)
The politician tapped on the paper in front of him. "Would you care to explain this?" The please was so heavily implied that John took a step back, before surging forward to pick up the paper.
Greg wanted to curse in French
Mike scoffed but agreed. "Pretty much."
After security sorted everything out, Seb had been hauled away while the Manchester owners looked on in worry. John and Sherlock were nestled on one of the sofas nursing their drinks.
"You'll thank me later," John insisted.
"And you aren't. I promise. Me working at the surgery was my last-ditch effort to appear normal. Your accident just made realize that I don't want normal. I never did. If I had wanted normal, I would have become a GP in some little country cottage with two point four children, a white picket fence, and gotten older and fatter as I dealt with colds and broken bones for the rest of my life. But even when I tried for the white picket fence, I married a former assassin. I just
So Sherlock told him the whole story.
"So don't," Murray agreed. "Just be careful who you tell."
"What!" John and Greg yelped. Greg moved away from Mycroft to look him the eye.
Mike tugged on his shirt, "I knew I should have worn the tie."
John shook his head, "I'm too knackered. This case has been hell. And nothing against you lot, but no one worked as hard as Sherlock and I."
John blushed. He knew who the customer was referring to and so did Mary. He couldn't help her crush on him, so he did his best to ignore it.
"Why didn't you call after Halloween?"
"Polo isn't exactly a poor man's sport," Mycroft explained, indicating the well-worn jeans and boots that were about to fall apart on Greg. "I mean no offense."
It was a race to see who would go first, her or John, whose failing health had emaciated him.
"You touch me a lot," Sherlock said, leaning into the touch.
He looked down at his empty plate with amazement. "I usually don't eat like that, sorry."
"How'd that happen?" Molly asked.
Trigger Warning (see note at the end)
"I'll see you tomorrow at 221Books, right?" John found himself asking.
"You're incorrigible," Sherlock muttered, pushing him away.
"You gorgeous thing," John murmured against Sherlock's lips.
"Thank you. -SH"
The goth boy was up first.
"There's always David."
"And that's just one of the reasons you can't be here, John," Dillon said with a frown. "You can't even make it through a speech like that without trying to cough up a lung on the floor. Can you imagine trying to diagnose somebody?"
"Don't let it happen again," the creature said, standing up, giving John an even better look of the man's body. John's knees went weak at the sound of this man's voice. It was liquid sex and velvet...John nodded.
The detective blushed and ducked his head to open his present. Inside was a small leather pouch.
"Someone is having fun," Janine teased as she looked down at his lap.
"I hope they can get the car fixed," Molly said as she helped cut vegetables for Divya's curry.
"And if I was?" John asked seriously.
"It looks marvelous, Sherlock," John said with a grin. "You've really outdone yourself."
All of John's nerve endings lit up like the Christmas tree. He hastened to get their trousers and pants off as quickly as he could.
"Don't worry, Vicky darling," Langdale said with a chuckle. "We're just going for a ride to the airport and on the way there, the three of us are going to have a lovely chat about you never setting foot on this continent again."
Hello darlings! Chapter two is up for your viewing pleasure. I'm going to try to keep to a weekly schedule, updating on Saturdays. I have five chapters written up, with another one or two more to go.
The man stopped in front of a set of heavy wooden doors and opened them for John. The doctor was used to the silence of Mycroft's underlings, but this coupled with the loneliness the house seemed convey, made everything oppressive. The doors closed tightly behind him and in the dim light of one desk lamp, John could barely make out the figure at the desk. John knew internally that it was Mycroft, but the creature before him was so unlike the well-kept-together man that John had trouble believing it.
He rang up the client and hit total. The machine sprang to life and the customer paid John the amount owed.
"As in, you will have access to your trust fund, Sherlock," Mycroft clarified.
"Nothing," Sherlock admitted softly.
John laughed. "That one is always the hardest not to sleep through. I'm glad you made it interesting."
"But I'll come as soon as I can," Sherlock assured him.
"Well, I'm starting to regret that choice, if that's what got me this," he said, waving to all of Sherlock.
He looked to see Molly jumping into the arms of Mike Stamford. Standing next to the very happy couple was an amused John Watson.
He decided that she wasn't his type anyway by the time they got to the estate. Which was absolutely gorgeous. It was a stately home that wasn't big or ostentatious. And was nestled in a set of woods that would make Jane Austen fans green with envy. John fell in love immediately.
John heaved out a sigh. Sherlock wasn't a mate that he could tease and rib good-naturedly. This was someone who up until...he looked at his watch...two hours ago he had been quite antagonistic with. John watched as Sherlock ran his fingers along the spines of well-worn and well-read books. He paused, stroking a particular book's spine before moving on.
Sherlock shook his head. "I couldn't do that to her."
"I'm just glad my dad doesn't think to put trackers in our phones or cars, otherwise I'd be seriously fucked up," John said, finishing his story.
Sherlock's lip quivered again, this time in relief. Yes, he and John would be okay now.
"Who?" Mycroft asked.
"I've managed to work it out with Mycroft; our tours will be together, well..." Sherlock explained. "Mine will technically start two months into yours, but I'll be traveling with you the whole time."
"Well," John said, "despite its cliffhanger ending, I still want to finish it. Though, I might kill you for it."
When everyone shook their heads no, Mike pulled out his phone and called Greg's number.
And the next few days followed that pattern.
"That's bullshit. Everybody's different and if you want to drive, then you drive," Greg explained.
"Did Molly come up with you or did she drive herself up?" John asked as he got the skis down from the roof of the car.
Molly dashed back to grab it and then smoothed out her dress with her spare hand. "Okay, let's go."
She grabbed his file and began flipping through it. "Nine schools in ten years, an army brat, eh?"
She squealed in delight at Sherlock's tux and Molly's dress. "Well don't the two of you make quite the pair."
Sherlock nuzzled his neck. "You are so good at this."
Sherlock nodded. "We needed the money and what's a little hit to my pride when it will make our lives that much easier? I've caught us up on all the bills and set up to have them paid automatically. Same goes for Mrs Hudson. The rent will deposit on the first of every month in her bank account."
Greg started going over how the process would work, what his deadlines would be, what the average number of drafts was, how and when to stick up for certain things.
"Are you sure he's going to be here?" Sherlock asked, staring into the remaining amber liquid.
Across the hall, Greg Lestrade was playing with his lighter, lighting it and putting it out with the tips of his fingers. He stared back at John.
"So how do you do it?"
"The prettiest," Sherlock agreed.
Sherlock ran his other hand down his chest and over his abdomen to stop just above the band of his pants.
"Your head still hurting you I see," Murray said as he began the routine of checking the machines, changing the saline bag, and making notations on the chart.
Greg grabbed Mycroft's shoulders to steady him and to look at his eyes to see if they were dilated, "Because you might have a concussion."
Coming back from Afghanistan was even more hair-raising than the actual war. At least there John didn't have to worry about moving out of someone's way, only to find other people staring at him funny because the person he stepped aside for wasn't really there. Or the ghosts that would stand on street corner, in hallways, or in the middle of the room and scream. Just scream, nothing else.
"Seriously?" John asked after wiping the beer from his face.
"People being enormous cunts is what happened," Mike growled. "He wrote a book and it was good. It just had some...themes that people didn't appreciate."
"What the hell?" John muttered. He didn't even like Sherlock and already he thought that was going too far. Especially for a first book.
So John started to bring coffee and scones for James, Mrs Hudson and himself to cheer himself up. Winter was coming in and still Sherlock was in Ireland.
John's other hand caressed Sherlock's stomach. "Then there's this part, it makes you scream when I do this," he bent down and nipped next to the belly button; and as if on cue, Sherlock screamed in pleasure.
Greg knew what was going to happen the second he saw the look of disgust on Mycroft's face.
I just want a normal, fun evening with friends and a boy I like."
Just then the music started back up and Greg huffed in annoyance. Mycroft began to dance his way through the crowd.
He looked at his watch. He had just enough time to catch lunch before heading back to his hotel room and getting his things in time to catch his plane.
Anthea nodded and quickly got in on the passenger side. Mycroft yanked open the driver side door and Greg had to leap out of the way to avoid getting hit. Mycroft slid into the driver's seat and turned on the engine.
Mycroft leapt on his horse with such grace that Greg let out an appreciative hum.
Greg called out, but he doubted he was heard over the roar of the engine and squealing tires.
"Forever," John agreed.
Sherlock took in a deep, shuddering breath and wrapped his arms around John's waist. "You were surrounded by blonds while I was away," he joked.
"He turned me down the next day!" John objected.
"Give me everything you've got. Bring it all here to Baker Street. I'll do what I can from here."
"Of course I did," she said proudly.
Sherlock glowered, but Victor ignored it. "I was hoping to catch you here," he said with a wink. "A little bird told me."
"Oh." Sherlock blinked. "I'd like that very much."
"I saw the lovely meal in the dinning room," John murmured into Sherlock's neck, dragging his lips across that long column of throat. "Did you cook for me again?"
"I wish I had your luck. I just can't think of anyone."
"Yes, you know my skill set, Sherlock. You are the best at mass connections in a small amount of data, I am the best at finding details in a mass of information. Imagine what I could do with the stock market if I wasn't a government man."
Sherlock shrugged, "It boils down to the same thing, you got drunk and now you're paying for it."
Mary and David were tangled up in each other by the window. David held up her leg by the thigh, the other on her breast, Mary had her head thrown back in pleasure, her hands twisted in his hair.
The horse flicked his mane as if to say, "What do you think I've been trying to get you to do?"
want to be his editor."
"Sent an entire shipment of books with their covers attached upside down to three major bookshops in Leeds."
"Well, guess who he's got?"
Greg threw his arms up in frustration. He knew Sherlock wasn't going to budge from John's side.
Sherlock: True. He didn't.
Sherlock removed his hand from his mouth. "Yes," he cried. "God yes!" He put the deed on the side table and proceeded to snog the living daylights out of his newly betrothed.
None of this showed on his face, of course. "To what do I owe this pleasure, brother mine?"
"That's Sherlock for you," John explained, phone still in his hand.
"It's better to show you both at the same time," John explained quietly.
Greg shrugged, "Too many offenses at once."
Mike chuckled. "I don't care what the reason, I'm grateful. You get kept alive and bad guys go to jail. Really, it's a win-win situation."
Sebastian shook Sherlock's hand. "Thank you, I will."
John and Mike got out of class at the end of the day and Mike hopped on his Vespa.
Sherlock looked at the newly created contact in surprise. "You provided your number as well?"
Sherlock's face lit up in a soft smile. "I only have the leftovers my landlady left before she went to visit her family."
"Let's get started, then," Sherlock said, indicating that John should sit at one of the nearby tables.
"She came up with us," Mike replied.
"I don't know," Sherlock admitted. "It's just nice to be invited out again."
John chuckled and led him up to his flat. "Close your eyes, Sherlock," he instructed, covering Sherlock's eyes with his hands from behind.
Sherlock's eyes grew wide and he nodded.
Mary had come down and she patted him on the cheek on the way to the coffee machine. "I know it's one of the reasons I keep him around."
John looked down at the book in shock. "No way!"
"You can't use that in a court of law," Jim interrupted. "You have to inform us that you're recording in order for it to be admissible."
Mike just laughed. "Actually, I know just the person."
Most of them involved being horizontal and the two of them having little to no clothes.
This time the look between Bertie and Jim was shocked.
A cheer went up and Sherlock ducked his head.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and sat down next to him. "It's a large country, John. Richard would actually have to give a damn to come to one of my shows, and trust me when I say he doesn't."
"What did the wall do to you?"
acting like Mycroft around me,"
you don't," Greg scoffed.
"You were a doctor," Sherlock sparred.
Just then the crowd parted to reveal John Watson, chatting with a pretty blonde who kept touching his arm, his shoulder, his face.
"The Key to the Castle in the Air"- struggling writer John hates the stuck up prick that comes to the bookshop he works in every morning. When John's book is picked up by Shercroft Publishing he is sent out to Sussex to go over the book. But when Mycroft has to rush off, it is up to little brother, Sherlock to finish the meeting with John. That self-same prick that drives John up the wall.
Molly blushed. "I'm sure he was just excited to see Sherlock is all."
The other man let out a sigh. "How are things going with you?"
John frowned. No one ever called him "doc."
John laughed. He held out his hand, "John Watson."
The Machinist's Wife'
Sherlock and John didn't have a garter or a bouquet, so they made their own things to toss.
He had to find Mycroft before Bertie did, otherwise this night might go up in smoke. Or worse, completely set the place on fire.
Sherlock nodded and slipped out of the office. Mycroft slumped against the front of his desk. John Watson had done the impossible. He had been the making of his brother. He had taken a great man and made him a good one.
Sally folded like a house of cards. "It's just one party, Mrs Holmes."
"It's all right, Sherlock, dear," Mrs Holmes soothed. "It was a silly old wish anyway."
moaning about how a woman beat you? Upset that a woman decided that you were rubbish and put you down like a dog." Sherlock shook his head. "Begone!"
John chuckled. "So I'll pick you up at your office at seven?"
"If you can't bridge a pair of scenes, don't," came the cool reply.
"If he were to agree to never do it again, would you be willing to work with him on the rare occasion I may be unavailable?"
"Come on, John!" Sherlock hollered. "We have to catch him!"
As much of a speed reader Mycroft was, he still had five cases to go through. Well, six by the time they caught the bastard. That had infuriated the elder Holmes so badly that upon catching the murderer, Mycroft had actually hit him. Full on fist to the face, no less. Greg had been impressed. Especially when the suspect had cried police brutality.
"Nice car, a bit beaten up but still a great car," Greg replied after taking a long drag of his cigarette.
He felt a soft hand on his shoulder and looked up to see Sherlock and John standing there.
Sherlock nodded shyly. John launched himself at his lover and kissed him hard.
"It means instead of saying a character is sad, say that the character's shoulders were rounded as he clutched his chest, tears streamed down his face as he choked out a sob," Sherlock replied.
"More games, I guess," John replied. "Unless you know of something else we can do in this massive house with minimal power."
Mycroft decided it was time to duck and run. Greg chased him, tossing his paintballs at Mycroft, sometimes hitting, sometimes not.
"Look, I'll be at the Criterion Bar most nights, so if you guys got anything, come see me there," Greg told them, and they both nodded.
They made proper introductions, of course. They were British, after all. Sherlock was apparently a consulting detective and worked with the police on occasion. And if Sherlock was to be believed, his brother was the British government. Somehow in the introductions, it was missed what Greg did.
"Hmm..." Sherlock said as he pulled John close. "What's going to happen to the house?"
One of the older books in the company's catelogue was being turned into a TV series by the BBC, and Sherlock was tasked with updating the covers of the book. Unfortunately the proofs that they sent were the wrong size and he was forced to spend an afternoon chasing down the right person to get him the size he needed.
Mrs Stamford clicked her tongue in disapproval. "What I saw was bad enough, come inside. I'll make us all a cuppa, and you tell us as much or as little as you want. How does that sound?"
Sherlock stood on the pavement and looked up at the building that was the headquarters of the BBC in London.
John at least was smart enough to give Sherlock a hug when the publicist dropped him off at his flat, but now he wished he had taken that kiss. Then he could have something to shore himself against the childish wiles of Mary Morstan.
Abernathy handcuffed their suspect and led him to the police car that Sherlock had been leaning against. She shoved him in and was about to slam the door when Sherlock stopped her with a quiet, "Wait."
They were going to regret playing him for a fool.
John itched to take Sherlock's hand again. He could still feel the warmth of the other man's touch on his palm. A warmth that was working its way into John's blood and warming his heart in ways he didn't believe was possible after being forced to leave the army.
"Mhmm...just last week, I lectured to his class about exotic poisons. Mike said it was a success. No one fell asleep."
That forced Greg to look up and the expression on John's face was thunderous. Greg huffed out an irritated sigh but followed John far enough away that Mycroft could not overhear.
"John..." Sherlock whined, throwing himself back against the passenger seat of their rental car.
Is this a bad time to mention that I know NOTHING about publishing?
"James, I'm flattered," John said, cutting him off. "You're a great bloke. But I only think of you as a friend, and a good one at that. But I like someone else."
"Is this...?" John breathed.
Sherlock: I tried writing it so many times it made my head spin. But whatever I wrote didn't have the same punch, the same innocence that original had, so I left it alone.
John sat in the now-demystified study. Whatever Sherlock had done, it seemed to be permanent. He swirled the dark amber liquid in his glass, watching the whiskey slosh around.
John sighed and then straightened his shoulders, "No, you're wrong. And I'm going to prove it to you."
I've also found a transcript of the movie and learned that I've done a few things out of order. Surprise, surprise, I am actually okay with this. My other fusions weren't as faithful to the movie as this one mostly has been, and I honestly needed the wiggle room.
He was just reheating the wontons when the doorbell rang. He counted each dish to make sure he hadn't forgotten anything and then wiped off his hands. He opened the door to a very dashing Sherlock Holmes.
He sat John down in one of the big, cushioned armchairs and then made his way around his desk to his own chair.
"Text him. It could be anything. Just text him."
left him hanging," Sally said smugly.
Sherlock blushed again. "Oh. Thank you."
John chuckled. "It's something that I should have done. But when I got home and the ghosts were just everywhere, if I started on one, it would snowball into this...thing."
"Oh hell no," Greg snapped. "The last deal I made has made my life a living nightmare."
He went searching through his phone and then turned it so they could see. It was a photo that Greg had snapped while they were on some case or another.
James was a good listener and John could feel the weight lifting off his chest, finally being able to talk about Sherlock with someone who didn't know him before John did.
John shook his head, "Evidently, two years is long enough for the insurance company to believe I spent it all. That or Mycroft intervened."
Sherlock was taken back, "I'm not sure I understand the implication."
Mary laughed.
job. Not mine."
He woke up the next morning to a text from John wishing him a good morning. A warm feeling washed over him. It was starting to get ridiculous how much this one person had turned his entire world on its head.
John snorted. "Only because you showed up before he could."
Avez-vous vu le crayon de mon oncle?- Where is my uncle's pencil
John got out his phone with a frown, and then his face lit up. He smiled warmly at his phone, before looking around for Sherlock.
my notes," Sherlock growled. "They are Mycroft's."
to enjoy my life," Sherlock went on. He waved Mycroft off, "Run along and do the same."
John fell over laughing and Sherlock followed, reclining next to John, almost draped over his lover.
“No, of course not, but...” John said.
Sherlock just shrugged.
"Yeah," John agreed.
John laughed. "Thanks for having us."
"Oh gosh, John!" she exclaimed. "Of course you'll want to sit next to Mary. I'll move."
"Harry is short for Harriet, and ever since she came out as a lesbian, she's being out partying every night. She's in her gap year, so Dad can't do anything about it. She says she'll be home for the weekend and then we don't hear from her for days. It's better if she stays away." John finished off his tea and then rubbed his hands over his face.
Sherlock typed back angrily,
"Hey, Sherlock," John muttered as he shuffled past. He was so focused on the thought of a cool drink he missed the crestfallen expression on Sherlock's face, the lovely meal on the dining room table and the wine chilling next to his beer. He pulled it out and took a sip after popping the lid off. He blinked for a few seconds as his brain finally processed what he had seen.
Sherlock helped his mother into their car and looked back to see John smiling at him. He thought John was the most interesting person he had ever met.
John grabbed Sherlock's hands and began to rubbing circles into his wrists.
Mycroft huffed. "I'm not sure either one would have classified their relationship as such, but yes." John's other eyebrow raced up to mirror its mate, eyes wide in shock.
"What have you got for me?" the TV host asked.
John was standing next to the large fireplace that framed the back wall of the lodge. The kitchen, dinning area, and sitting room were not separated by any walls. It was just wide open and cozy. The upstairs had three bedrooms but much to the ladies' dismay, only one bathroom.
A cheer erupted behind them and they broke apart, breathless.
"Oh thank god!" Mike huffed. "I wasn't sure if you two were going to make it. It's really coming down out here."
John waved his hand dismissively. "No one you'd have heard of. They're a smaller company."
"Oh dear, that couldn't have been very comfortable," Barbara murmured. "It'll be taken care of the next time you come back. And there will always be a standing reservation for you both. He was rather insistent about that."
Sherlock was leaning against the bonnet of a police car as Brook struggled with two uniformed officers. Off to the side stood a grizzled detective inspector. Sherlock had taken the car back to Baker Street, where he knew the con man would have run to first.
"I thought you'd never ask!" Mycroft whispered joyfully in his lover's ear.
John scoffed. "You act like you've been
"Are you talking about Sherlock? Is that who you're interested in? Are you telling me you're gay?"
"Hey, come on, Sherlock," Mike said. "Let me get you home."
"He actually manages to like all three, thank you," Sherlock huffed.
The nerd merely screamed, "No!" and bolted back to the others when asked about dating Mycroft.
"I like them with a pulse," John said with a grin, "Even if yours is a little thready at the moment."
Sherlock smiled and just replied, "Thanks!"
Enjoy!
John glanced up at his husband in shock.
Ajay grunted and began filling his order, "Your mum know you're here?" he asked, as he slid Greg his drink.
Um...cliffhanger? (author runs and hides)
"What is your type, then?" Sherlock asked.
"Always," Sherlock agreed.
John handed Sherlock a set and sat down to eat. They talked and laughed, enjoying each other's company.
The restaurant that John took them to was upscale but not overly expensive. John had made the reservation for eight, so they had a little time to chat before being seated. Sherlock still wasn't sure what he should do or say, but he let John lead the conversation.
Sherlock chuckled. "Well, that's certainly true."
"Like the god you are," John murmured.
Mycroft closed his eyes pained and let them pass, but at the last second, he reached out for Sherlock's hand. "Wait, Sherlock! I have something I want to tell you."
just to understand what my female co-stars were feeling. I did to stand out. The competition is fierce for male dancers and I had to do something to get noticed. I'm damn sure that the only reason that I still dance after...," Sherlock shook his head, "is because of sheer nepotism. My brother is on the board for the Royal Arts Society and his husband is the director."
She clenched her fists and gritted her teeth. He was right, of course. There was no show without him and the smug bastard knew it. As long as Sherlock Holmes wanted the job, it was his. "Unmasking the Supernatural: The Science of Demystifying the Ethereal," for all its cumbersome title, wouldn't be popular without its eccentric host.
And as such, John immediately discounted the desk. That was for files and things of that nature. He went to the side bar first. But it was stocked neatly with bottles of the best whiskeys, wines, and other spirits. And judging from the labels, this was even better than the stuff Mycroft had put out for him.
"Yeah," John said weakly. "I was supposed to be meeting with Mycroft, but he had an emergency meeting come up and left Sherlock to take over. And I couldn't keep my temper in check. So, no, I don't think they'll want to publish my book ever. Might even make sure no else does, too."
"Where's your brother going?" Mummy asked curiously.
Toby: But "The Spring of the Gryphon" is not that book.
John immediately went over to where the former soldier was standing, holding a couple of books.
Anthea tried on the dress and it only needed a couple of quick tweaks. She could pick up the dress tomorrow and it would be ready for her.
"So, who then?"
"Sarah Sawyer spread it around I buy my clothes from Selby's instead of Selfridges."
James held up the two books in his hand, "I have a couple of books and I don't know where to shelve them."
Sherlock twisted in his seat as far the seat belt would allow. "And how on earth did that happen?"
The customer laughed. "Don't tell Mycroft, you know jealous he gets."
"You knew he was going to say that," Sally accused him.
"Mycroft called me brave just now," Sherlock murmured. "I don't feel brave. But I have confidence in my writing for the first time in years. Maybe ever."
Also this is where it earns its mild angst tag.
"This is more important than my nose!" he bellowed.
Sherlock was stricken, but Greg didn't care. He walked up to the younger boy, and as he shouldered past, he hissed, "I hope it was worth it."
John licked his lip again. There was a lot to be excited about. Meeting Sherlock Holmes, whom he had a lot of respect for. Showing said idol that there were people out there who can speak with the dead or see ghosts. That John Watson was the real deal. And to top it all off, John was leaving London for the first time since being invalided home. He loved London. But he was used to traveling all over the world and it was a nice change to get away from the four greying walls of his bedsit. He couldn't wait.
Sherlock: Sure.
"Sherlock, you just barely got well enough to make it to the loo on your own. You shouldn't go tearing off after London's criminal class, not until you get your weight up a little more."
"It's a small consolation. But thank you."
Sure enough, not five minutes had gone by when Sherlock appeared at John's elbow to take his tea.
Mary gave a half shrug. "That, or you got pissed."
"Really?" he asked, with a raised eyebrow.
Just then the room again lit up in an impressive lightning array. Followed closely by a near deafening boom of thunder.
"Mycroft
The officer simpered. "Oh, come on," she implored. "I'd make it worth your while." She put her hand on his arm.
It was filled with hay bales, metal structures, plastic partitions, and wooden barriers.
"When did you get home?" John gasped as he finally let Sherlock's feet touch the ground. "I thought you had another week in...California, wasn't it?"
"Oh. Then I'm glad someone did him in proper," John agreed. He looked up at Sherlock and frowned. He was standing closer to the cameraman. Which if Mike was to be believed, the two men
"You look nice," Mycroft murmured. "Where did you manage to find a tux at such short notice?"
Sherlock cuddled John close, "Me, too. Me, too."
John heaved out a massive sigh. "Right, if I'm going to survive this, I'm going to need a few things. First, where is the nearest bathroom?"
Archie was Greg's assistant, a clever chap, eager to learn.
"Doctor, then?" Sherlock offered.
Janine raised an eyebrow as she watched her friend awkwardly flirt with Mike, tucking her hair behind her ear and smiling at him.
John's nose wrinkled in confusion. "Know what?"
Just then the door banged open and the two boys scrambled to create space between them.
Sherlock sat up and shrugged his other arm out of the robe and moved the rest of it to the side. He threw his head back and moaned.
One of his mates had decided to play a prank on him in the form of swapping out his sunblock with Harry's coconut oil, resulting in one fried John Watson, who had spent the entire time bathing in aloe and cursing his friend.
any coffee," he told Sherlock as he added a couple more eggs to the pan.
"Go ahead and tell them," Sherlock murmured.
"Hey, love," Mycroft greeted.
"I love you, too. Forever, John," Sherlock whispered.
He got into the car and directed the driver to the first set of shops he needed to visit.
"I hate you," Mycroft growled.
"I'll make sure she gets talked to about that," he assured the customer.
Standing up for John were Bill Murray and James Sholto. Both men wore dress blues: Bill because he was still active duty, and James because he was gifted the honor. Both looked sharp, and Bill was engaging James in conversation, drawing him out of his shell. Mike and John weren't in blues; with Mike not having any, they opted for the groom and best man in military-
John burst out laughing. "You've got me there."
Toby: Tell him I'm betting on you, too.
Sherlock waved his hand. "Well, you know, talking to people about your book, reading the first chapter, and if you're lucky maybe a signing or two. And that's just when you first get started; if you become popular there's more to it."
Sherlock sighed. "It really is lovely, John. Thank you for bringing me."
"Well, I don't need it," Sherlock growled.
A real problem that was starting to manifest below his waist. Just thinking about those thick curls, those long eyelashes that framed those amazing technicolored eyes, that long, lean body, whose legs went on for miles. Yes, it was a real problem.
," Sherlock said, sticking out his thumb toward the maitre d', "gave away because we were only five minutes late."
