It’s John’s voice, so close that his stomach turns over with joy. But John is dead. His body floats miles away now, a mere speck on the horizon that he can somehow still see. He opens his mouth to yell, but only a dry whimper crawls from his throat. When he blinks, the handrail is gone. He’s not on the deck anymore. Everything is dark.
It was cyclical, this pleasure of being praised and the pleasure of giving that praise; they fed off each other, lifted each other up. The more amazing Sherlock made himself, the brighter John shone by his side, and it was through that lens that Sherlock honed his brilliance to a crystal edge. They had created a positive feedback loop that only ever gained energy the more it circled around, picking up fresh vigour on every pass.
John holds up a finger. “Wait. Just let me speak for a bit. I know you were just trying to help. And if I’m honest, I think part of me must have wanted this. I’ve been avoiding it for so long, I haven’t the first idea how to properly deal with it. I knew you’d been planning something. I could have just carried on avoiding you this whole trip. But instead I rushed up there, even after seeing on the map what you were leading me towards.
But these things were meaningless to Sherlock— they might even make him supremely uncomfortable. Sherlock simply wasn’t like that. He didn’t,
“Perhaps. However, I’m not the one about to ruin both our shoes.” Before John even knows what’s happening, Sherlock shoves him towards the outer railing, and a hand on the back of his neck is bending him low, and then he’s doubling over to vomit.
He lifts Sherlock’s head to look at him properly. Sherlock’s eyes are scrunched tightly shut, teeth chattering with pain. John brushes the wet hair from his forehead and rests their heads together, lowering his voice to a hush. “You’re right, I don’t, so here’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to stop talking like that, Sherlock, and listen to me now. Either we both stay here, or we both make it back to shore. Either way nobody’s being left behind. So how about it— are you gonna help me swim, or do I have to carry you the whole way?”
Now he was panicking that they could never go back to how things were. That he could never look at Sherlock again and not think about what happened. Sherlock could see it clouding his expression, even now. He had to make him see that it didn’t matter.
“And secondly,” he adds, jerking his head towards the Tiki bar, “that sign over there says the pool’s closed. Bad luck! No swimming today.” His cheeks pull tight with satisfaction, but his victory is short-lived. Sherlock rolls his eyes.
The coffee-soaked air has grown too sour to bear another second. Sherlock storms out of the café, ruffling his heat-flattened curls to feel the breeze through them again. If John needs this to take his mind off things… Fine. But he won’t need it for much longer. Tomorrow, Sherlock is going to teach him to swim. No more nausea, no more coping strategies, and no more flirting with anything that passes by him on two legs. No more
He turned abruptly, meeting Sherlock’s eyes and locking him in place with an intense, pained look. The clock on the wall stopped ticking.
“I’m not going to bloody smudge it,” he mumbled. His tongue poked between his lips in concentration. After a few stars, he could feel Sherlock’s eyes burning at him. “What? I’m being careful.”
His face pulls back, revealing a fresh gleam in his eyes. “There’s no value in my existence. What we do doesn’t even make a dent in the criminal underworld. Life will go on, just as it always has.”
A final sputter of energy lifts his flaring nostrils out of the water for one last, desperate breath. Then he goes under.
“I’m not afraid of death, but I am afraid of dying without having let you know how much I’ve appreciated your companionship these past few years. You’ve become incredibly important to me, and I believe you have a tendency to undervalue your worth. But that is, admittedly, partially my fault.”
important, and is looking entirely too smug about it. He casually raises the tip of his umbrella to peer at its metal point in false interest.
“Then that’s what we’ll do. We’ll backstroke all bloody day if that’s what it takes. You need to get to a hospital.”
, which was something of a tradition in itself these days, as if he still felt it necessary to do everything in his power to atone for his part in the
Eager to keep John riding the crest of his orgasm, Sherlock quickly started pumping him with his fist as he clambered back up towards eye-level. His hair was wild and his skin gleamed with sweat, but John was in no better state. He was a wreck; breathless and whimpering, unable even to properly move his lips as Sherlock snaked his tongue between them, tasting of salt and John’s own heady arousal.
Sherlock pressed his lips thin, a crease deepening between his brows. “You’re worrying about what happened. In the boot.” It wasn’t a question, but John shook his head anyway. “You think I’ll think differently of you. Judge you badly for it? I can assure you, John, that there is absolutely nothing to be—”
John laughs so hard that he nearly spills his tea. Oh, this is going to be good. He should snap a photo of a tanned Sherlock for posterity. Or possibly blackmail; the kitchen is overdue for a good cleaning. “So where are we going, Mahon? Ciutadella?" he asks, reigning in his amusement. "Do we know where this bloke is hiding?”
“You realise there’s a height difference between us,” he said, matter-of-factly. “There was little friction being applied on my end of the equation. And even if there were, you weren’t in the correct position to feel any evidence of it.”
As John’s other senses came back online, he realised the crowd was cheering around them. His muscles relaxed, and Sherlock pulled away slightly, roaming his eyes over John’s face. He was barely holding back a fit of giggles.
Sherlock turned to him, a decidedly smug grin on his face. “I believe they expect us to kiss now,” he said matter-of-factly, bringing his face close to John’s.
John pumps his own cock faster, bringing himself back to the edge and willing Sherlock's body to cum beneath him. His arse has a tight grip, his hole twitching longingly against the silky flesh and their hips roll forward over and over, pressing firmly together. Sherlock's is even doing so of its own accord now, in its desperation for release. He's so close now, John knows, convulsing on the sofa, arms limp at his sides, features drawn tight on his face. He’s grinding his cock against John, nudging his bollocks with every thrust. John can feel Sherlock's long overdue climax fast approaching in the thickening of his prick, the rush of heat in his balls as they draw up and tighten against him.
John huffed a tired, defeated laugh. They came to a stop outside their front door. John fished his keyring out of his jacket pocket, making quick work of the lock. Sherlock quietly followed him inside.
But one thing bothered him still. It was all well and good that Sherlock wanted to do these things for him, to touch him, pleasure him as a lover should— but John also yearned to feel Sherlock’s burning skin beneath his fingertips. Would he even want to be touched; to be as close as they were now, only lying in bed, skin to skin?
The sound of the door latch rattling open sends John bolt upright where he stands. Someone enters the room behind him, and judging by how quickly the affection melts from Sherlock’s face, he has a pretty decent idea who it might be. Biting back a curse, John hastens to compose himself before turning to their untimely intruder.
“No, Sherlock—” John grabs his arm. “God, no, don't be silly. It’s not that. I'm not tired of you.” Sherlock waits. John’s hand falls away. “It’s just, you know. On a cruise. It’s not like you actually get to enjoy the island itself, do you? You spend the whole time out… out there.”
Sherlock glanced up from where he was sat cross-legged by the coffee table, wrapped in his navy blue dressing gown and surrounded by a scattering of junkmail booklets and magazines. A pair of scissors stilled in his hand, threaded halfway through a glossy page with a printed headline that read, if John squinted hard enough, ‘
Sherlock stopped fiddling with the placement of his newest acquisition (the final ‘Y’ he needed to complete the word ‘Birthday’) and glared up at him. “John, I am not going to spend two or three quid on a mass-produced piece of cardboard printed with some obnoxiously fluffy sentiment and designed by a total stranger.”
Disappointed, and with the thrill of the chase fizzling out into such an anti-climax, John had felt the stirrings of a need to touch himself. They were standing in the midst of so many happy, jovial strangers, and once his mind hooked onto the idea it wouldn’t let go. There was only two ways this could end up.
For the first time in his life, Sherlock found himself grasping for excuses to keep someone in his life, rather than push them away. Luckily for him, it had taken very little persuasion to have John pack up his meagre belongings, leave his dour little bedsit and move into Baker Street with him.
Beside him, Sherlock was perched on his leather chair, knees drawn up, socked toes gripping the edge of the cushion. He looked like an owl.
John stared into his beautiful, nebulous eyes, and the answer that came to him — the one closest to the truth of what he was feeling at that exact moment — was to a slightly different question. Hugging him closer, he replied anyway: “I’ll
Sherlock’s breath is foul from his long sleep, and John doesn’t care. This is still sweeter than anything he’d dared dream. His face is wet again, fresh tears smearing against their cheeks, somehow even finding their way onto his tongue, turning their kisses tangy with salt. And John’s heart is full to bursting.
“I thought you were busy people-watching?” he says, almost accusatory. “Please tell me we’re here because our man’s serving cocktails at the tiki bar.”
“Not from there, you won’t.” John takes another bold step forward. The fool is clearly underestimating him based on their height difference. An amateur mistake. John stands battle-ready and evenly balanced, ready to strike. He’s close enough now that he could reach out and snatch the knife away, but patience is key. He must wait for the right opening.
The mystery of it piques his curiosity enough that he wills his fingers to move. They twitch, then curl in on themselves, weakly grasping the hand that covers them, and that voice —
The fixation began in his teen years, during that ungraceful transition from boyhood to manhood when surging levels of testosterone in John’s body shot up his height by three inches in six months, and dropped his tenor voice by a full octave. And, like most boys his age, there would be occasions when his body would rebel at the most embarrassing of times. Unable to control itself amidst the flood of new hormones, random, spontaneous erections were a constant threat— and a reminder to always wear loosely-fitting underwear.
“Alright,” Sherlock murmurs. “It’s okay. You’re okay, John. Let’s get you out.” He manages to pull them over towards a metal ladder, the nearest point of escape, and helps to stabilise John’s weight as he drags himself out. Sherlock climbs out after him and trots over to the chairs to grab a dry towel.
Pulling out his phone, John manages to snap a photo as he circles around to the stairway, texting the image to Sherlock as he races down to the floor below. The lingering traces of his motion sickness are forgotten, pressed to the back of his mind by the urgency of stopping what’s about to happen. He’s at the bottom of the stairs when his phone pings with a reply.
of getting an erection, but I don’t find it particularly comfortable or enjoyable. It won’t happen so long as you don’t touch it too much. Accidental brushes are fine.”
“But Sherlock, I am bloody angry. At myself, too. Maybe even moreso. I just… I hate being brought low by something so pathetic. This isn’t a game to me, and I don’t appreciate you turning it into one.”
“The frailty of genius. Yeah, I know,” John says, watching him with such fondness that he feels his cheeks reddening.
“Um, Greg…” Molly squeaked, her dainty fingers playing around the stem of her glass. She had been conspicuously quiet for a while, and when she looked up, her expression was timid. “If Mrs Hudson isn’t playing, then that… That makes me the only… girl.” A shy smile pulled at the corners of her mouth, spreading it thin.
the world— he autopsies it. But you just don’t get scenery like this in London. Having spent his life picking apart every scene piece-by-piece, it’s difficult to pull back and take in the wider picture. But even he has to admit there’s something striking about a sunset over a wide open sea.
“Well well, the great detective got something wrong! Are there pigs flying over the streets of London? Did Hell suddenly freeze over?” he mocked. John, hidden by the back of his chair, grinned victoriously into his drink. Huffing like a teenager, Sherlock blindfolded himself again.
A strained whimper escaped John’s throat as Sherlock moved down to press his mouth to John’s carotid pulse beneath his ear. He let his lips tease against skin as he spoke. “I want to learn everything there is to know about you. I want to hear all the sounds you make when you let go, when you’re experiencing bliss under my hands, my lips,”—he dragged his tongue along the side of John’s neck, causing him to shudder and moan helplessly— “my tongue.”
It’s been one of those days. They’ve just finished up a month-long case for the Met, concluding in a heart-stopping showdown inside a circus tent when Sherlock had chased the killer (a homicidal clown) up onto a tightrope and wrestled him into submission, all without losing his balance. He'd then addressed the shocked audience and stated not to worry, the vast majority of clowns
want them to be something. He wasn’t sure what, exactly, but this wasn’t enough for him anymore. But that carried with it its own set of problems that he had no idea how to manage.
The first time his head dipped under, the rush of water through his nose jolted him awake and sent a flash of adrenaline to his legs, spurring them into action. When it happened again, half an hour later, he had to cough up a cold lungful of water.
“No, I won’t be working with security,” Sherlock explains. “Too risky. Word travels quickly through a ship’s crew, even one of the Aurora’s considerable size. I can’t afford to give him forewarning of my presence. I’ll wait for him to make a move on somebody, then catch him in the act.”
Sherlock leans back in his chair, pressing his hands together in satisfaction. That’s one less worry to be dealing with. John will be fine. He’ll forget to be angry soon enough, and with any luck he might even start having fun. For all that they bicker over the small things, John must be aware that he is an object of Sherlock’s quiet obsession. It would be difficult to miss. The way he can't help but stare at John in the hallway after a long, heart-pounding chase through London, just glad that he's there, giggling and breathless and enjoying himself every bit as Sherlock is. How he can't resist any opportunity to stand close to him, or touch the exposed skin of his wrists, or his fingers as John hands him a freshly brewed cup of tea. Just to sample the texture, of course. Catalog the temperatures of various parts of a living body that isn't his own. There are purely clinical, scientific justifications to everything he does and somehow continues to get away with.
John curses himself for not keeping a closer eye on him these past several days. Perhaps if he was better fed and hydrated he wouldn’t be in such a state; as it is, there’s no telling how long he’ll last once the sun rises and begins to beat down on them. At this rate, they may not even make it that far.
“I’ll play, too!” Molly chirped, suddenly much more into the idea for some reason, though nobody seemed surprised. When Anderson also sat forward and declared himself in, Greg raised his eyebrows at John questioningly.
John fishes the room key from his shorts. Fumbling to unlock the fancy sensor-based lock, John musters a few embarrassing words of thanks. “Yeah, I’ll be fine. Thank you. For the help, that was very… I appreciate it. Thanks.”
Somewhere over the English channel, John flops back down into his aisle seat and releases a huff of hot air. “Typical. Five minutes after takeoff and there’s already a queue for the loo.” He throws his head back and addresses the seat controls above him. “Why did I agree to this?”
Sherlock’s mouth quirked into a sheepish smile and his eyes flicked down, showing off for a moment the dark fans of his eyelashes. “Thank you. And I don’t mind at all. I love to hear it, coming from you.”
Behind them, other passengers waiting to board begin to mumble complaints, and Sherlock manages to pull John aside to let them pass. He leans John against the solid wall of the deck as if to help ground him, and it helps a bit, but he can hardly hug the walls for the entire trip.
“Sure,” John croaked, the hint of a sad smile in his voice, as if he fully expected this to be their final conversation. A lump formed in Sherlock’s throat. He had to get this right. Losing John was not an option.
Outside, he could hear people approaching the car. A door opened, then another, and the suspension bounced and sank as their captors boarded. He dropped his voice to a strained whisper. “So, what’s the plan?”
He hated it, wished that he could turn it off. But the more he fought his urges, the worse they’d seemed to get. Life for John had become increasingly difficult once he reached adulthood, found his independence, and was required to move about in public without a parent or sibling on his arm. And so, reluctantly, he’d become a public masturbator. Despite a few close calls, by the grace of God he’d somehow never been arrested for public indecency. But it was a difficult life. He felt so alone, so ashamed of himself. That is, until he met Sherlock.
But on that first night at Angelo’s, there had been something more. Praise of a different kind; a deeper, fuller appreciation, something all-encompassing. Something hungry, carnal, possessive. It was a look of sheer
“Can I?” he said, and John lifted his hand away to allow him access. Sherlock’s fingers curled around him, his grip surprisingly firm and warm, and resumed the pace John had been going at.
John’s grip on the banister tightens. He doesn't like the sound of any of that. Alone, no backup, not even from the crew. And he expects to take down a dangerous criminal who, by the victim's own testimony, is probably twice his weight in muscle-mass alone? Turning back towards the stairs, he swallows thickly, ignoring the rising anxiety in his gut. Against all better judgement, he gives a nod. “Fine," he says. "I’ll pack.”
After Angelo’s, John hadn’t asked again. He respected his friend’s feelings and didn’t question their status in each other’s lives. But part of him always wondered if things might have developed differently, if only he hadn’t jumped the gun like a giddy teenager.
The air takes on the quality of his breath and Sherlock breathes it in, revelling in the fresh data; tea, toast, mint. If he had the ability to, he would be smiling right now. Just from this he understands that it must be morning. John’s had breakfast and his coffee was made extra strong today. It isn’t the brand they use at home, so they must be somewhere else— a hospital, most likely. Their beverages are usually terrible.
The Kiss Cam moved on to its next target couple, and soon the attention around them died off enough for John to surreptitiously fumble at his jeans and put himself away. Fortunately, he’d kept the napkin Sherlock had brought with the food in the bottom of the box, so not a lot of his deed had spilled visibly on his jeans. Suitably re-clothed, he stuck the box under his seat, thinking a silent apology at the poor clean-up crew who’d eventually find it there.
Mikhail’s arm jerks forward. Sherlock swiftly dodges with a boxer’s grace, saving himself from a strike that would have cut clean across his neck. But another swipe follows right after the first, the metal of the blade singing in the air. It passes an inch from his face and sends him stumbling off-balance. Mikhail presses the advantage and knocks him against the deck wall, slamming into him with his full weight and knocking the wind out of his chest.
It was tempting to ignore his wishes, to pick and pry at it, pull at the thread until the whole problem unravelled. Sherlock could get to the bottom of it, he knew. He could help, somehow. There would be something he could do, something he could say to make the whole thing go away. But John would probably appreciate that even less.
John stroked his hands up and down Sherlock’s thighs. “What a prat. I’m so sorry. That must have been awful.”
“Sorry,” John said, leaning into his shoulder. “It’s just… I don’t want to make an arse of myself. I don’t want to scare you off.”
“Oh, good,” Sherlock says without a hint of sincerity, “I was wondering when I would be getting a visit from the Queen.”
John’s heart was still pounding in his chest when Sherlock pulled at the ropes again. John could feel the difference in the tension, but it still amazed him when Sherlock’s right arm slipped up and out of the coils, followed by his left. Then, having created enough extra slack in the rope by freeing his limbs, Sherlock slid his torso down through the coils around their chests. Honestly, the man was like a god damned contortionist.
. How long ago did he last hear Sherlock’s voice call back to him? It suddenly feels like an eternity ago. The sea is terribly, horribly quiet. How did he not notice it until now? How could he not tell when two sets of splashing arms diminished to just his own? A wave of cold panic threatens to overcome him, but he roughly shoves it aside, throwing himself back in the direction he came from. All ideas of preserving his strength are abandoned as he calls out, backstroking furiously, lungs burning with exertion. He doesn’t bother to mask the distress in his voice. The thought of Sherlock slipping silently beneath the waves without John even noticing makes him sicker than all the days he’d spent getting used to the swaying of the decks beneath his feet.
It takes thirteen long minutes for John to respond, probably too busy flirting. Sherlock’s hackles raise in irritation.
But after the final note of The First Noel sung out through the air, there was a brief and satisfying round of applause from their guests, and John’s eyes lit up with that same look that Sherlock hadn’t even realised he’d missed so much until now. His heart clenched. He wanted John to look at him like that all the time, but it was something he knew he could never have. From that point on, his mood began to sink.
He can feel John slipping through his grip. But John isn’t getting heavier— his own arms are losing their strength. The additional strain is pulling relentlessly at the muscles at his flank, where a white-hot pain is pulsing with heat through his midriff. It takes a great deal of effort to keep his face neutral. “Kick your legs, John,” he urges again, gritting his teeth.
Leaning forward, Sherlock shot a smoldering look at John, who saw in his eyes the same kind of intense energy that he’d often witnessed during a particularly stimulating case. He recognised that look. Apparently, the game was now
“Here should be better,” he said in a small voice, watching the discreet motion of John’s arm working himself under the coat. “You’ve been anxious for this all day, haven’t you?”
“What is it? I don’t think I’ve ever heard of Kiss & Guess,” John asked, his words forming a tad slower on his tongue than usual. He was sitting back in his familiar armchair, which had been repositioned with the rest of the furniture to form an intimate circle of seats around the coffee table at the far end of the living room. Despite an encroaching sense of boredom, John was in a very good mood tonight. He was willing to try something new. “Something about… kissing someone and then guessing something about them? Sounds pretty fun.”
“Ah.” He took out a piece and started munching, and was visibly surprised when Sherlock did the same, but his friend either ignored or simply didn’t notice his incredulous look.
.” Sherlock’s voice captured his attention like a magnet, impossible to resist. They gazed at each other, and as Sherlock stepped closer, invading his personal space, John felt his pulse kick up several notches in his throat.
John turns fully to face him. “Sherlock, you really are an impatient sod sometimes. If you’d let me finish, I’m trying to say I was gathering information. Asking around for gossip, that sort of thing. I wasn’t
John, who trusts and admires him and asks so little, yet gives so much in return. Trustworthy John Watson, his steadfast moral compass, capable of making him belly-laugh one minute and seethe with unadulterated annoyance in the next. Surprising and predictable, mundane and fascinating. A life without John would be a very boring existence indeed.
Eventually, John took a steadying breath and started over. “What you do for me. What you let me do… It’s a bit more than… It’s not the sort of thing—” He gestures between them. “
Sherlock seemed oblivious to it. In fact, he seemed to be quite enjoying himself. “I may do one for Graham next.”
. But this time he hears it in his own inner voice and it rings with startling truth. The pieces begin to settle into place, an answer solidifying into purpose, into motion, and before he knows what he’s doing he tilts Sherlock’s face to his and boldly presses a kiss to his lips.
“Well? Are you going to do it, so I can get this over with and win?” he said, hoping nobody noticed the sudden huskiness that had somehow crept into his voice. He was keenly aware of exactly whose eyes were mere inches away from his face, observing every movement, every twitch of his muscles. And he was no idiot; Sherlock had set this up deliberately, he must have. Perhaps even from the moment he’d declared he wanted to play the game at all. John knew it. Probably everyone in the room knew it.
Anderson huffed. “By and large, I don’t think any of us is particularly keen on kissing or being kissed by anyone else here. I don’t think we have to worry about any funny business going on.”
“Will you be staying again?” Mycroft asks. John nods. “Very well. Anthea will be along with a fresh set of clothes for you in a few hours. I must return to work, but I would appreciate a call as soon as anything changes.”
The truth, too painful to voice in the face of John’s trusting expression, catches in his throat. He swallows it back. “We’ll swim.”
Soon, his steady pace had John’s thighs twitching and his breath coming in irregular gasps and chokes. “I’m close,” he managed to say between gasps. “What should… When I come… what do you want…?”
It’s difficult for him to put it into words, but when he’s touching himself in public, he’s getting off as if nobody else in the world knows what this feels like— as if he’s the only person on the planet who can feel this way. They see him, just as Sherlock sees him now: flushed, breathless, losing control over his own reason, his mind overtaken by crude images of sex and dripping cum and voratious fucking. But to them it’s like none of that is pleasurable. When they look at him, they see something not quite right in the way he moves. The way he’s breathing. His dark, half-lidded eyes unfocused, lost in a haze of arousal. His entire world shrunken down to that one imperative need that becomes his only desire, the only goal left in front of him. And yet it would only alarm them; they’d be repulsed, disgusted by it.
Sherlock cracks a reassuring smile, fluttering his hand in the air. “It’s fine. Water over the bridge.”
John’s breathing had become irregular, his pace increasing. He felt hot, and tense, and ready. His fist pumped over the head of his cock, making it twitch, making his legs shake. And he had no other choice— he had to ask.
“Christ, Sherlock, that’s good…” he heard himself say. It was a different angle than he was used to, in a pleasing way, and felt better than his own hand. Sherlock seemed surprisingly good at this for somebody who presumably never masturbated himself.
“Boyfriends?” One of them asked, beaming a broad smile. And even as John began apologetically correcting their assumption, Sherlock wrapped a gentle arm around John’s waist and pulled him close.
Gasping, Sherlock claws at Mikhail’s sweat-streaked face while a pair of heavy fists tries to get a grip on his collar and choke him with it. Mikhail boxes him in with his thighs, but Sherlock manages to wriggle away and escape under his arm, only to catch a fist out of nowhere that sends him sprawling backward.
John’s cock was trapped between them, twitching insistently and leaving a patch of wet against their stomachs where the head was leaking tiny beads of pre-come. But Sherlock didn’t seem to mind it. His stomach muscles rolled in a wave, and John moaned into his mouth.
John rubbed his chin. Well, maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. Of course, there was the danger of having to get entirely too close to Anderson’s face for comfort. But if Molly was playing, then at least there was a chance of not having to kiss, or be kissed by, someone with a face full of stubble. He’d never really fancied her, but it wouldn’t be unpleasant. And Sherlock seemed so confident he would win this. John simply couldn’t resist the allure of finally having a chance to beat him at a game. Because if there was one thing John was certain he knew better than his brilliant flatmate, it was the intricacies of human touch.
Now, if this was still just about the game, then this was when he should have straightened and headed back to his seat, and maybe John would guess him, maybe he wouldn’t. It didn’t seem all that important anymore. But Sherlock couldn’t help himself. Leaning on John’s chair for support, he repeated the motion, took John’s mouth in another kiss, and this time it was unmoderated and uncontrolled. This time, it was more like he was… exploring, discovering something vital. About John, about himself. About them, the both of them, something he’d always suspected lied buried just beneath the surface but which he’d never been able to touch before. Didn’t know how. And now, with one physical point of contact, it was like a circuit being completed, old disused bulbs burning back to life in the dark corners of his mind, places that he hadn’t dared revisit in so many, many years. Emotions he’d all but forgotten even existed. Yet there they were, like relics from another life hurtling forward into the present, becoming relevant again.
The gallery owner, Mrs Patterson stood between them, with her back to John while she spoke to the detective. “You are as good as they say, Mr Holmes. Very good indeed. I can’t thank you enough for your assistance in this. That piece was a priceless work of art; our reputation would have been utterly destroyed had it not been recovered in such a timely fashion.”
John had closed his eyes against the truth laid so bare, his hands clenching and unclenching at his sides.
But that tamped down flame of desire burned brighter than ever now, and he didn’t know what to do. The entire future of their friendship now pivoted on the fulcrum of his troubling emotions.
“But I… If we were…” He shook himself, forcing it out. “If we were together like that, like… more than friends. I might want to… touch you. And to have you touch me. You’re… God, you’re gorgeous, Sherlock. You’re so bloody attractive. And I couldn’t stand to only appreciate you from afar. The last thing I want is to make you uncomfortable, but I need the physical stuff, too. Even kissing…”
After wiping his hand as best he could inside his boxers and zipping himself back up, he indicated that he was ready, and Sherlock stepped back from him, drawing his coat closed. The loss of his body heat made John shiver slightly in the breezy air.
Sherlock lies flat on his back on the sofa, the same position he's been in for the past hour. “It was your idea to drag us along to that god-awful function,” he snipes. “Do you have
“What would have been the point?” His brow creases in confusion. “Two outcomes: You either accept or decline. If you declined, we would get nowhere and the problem would persist. If you accepted, then how is that any different? What changes?”
He waited. A minute later, it seemed John had given up his train of thought. Sherlock couldn’t bear to leave it alone. “Didn’t even what?”
As they made their way home, Sherlock stared ahead, seemingly lost in his thoughts. He looked every bit as perfectly
He has no idea what he’s doing, but he’s not going to stop it. His mind blanks as he leans over, bringing himself close enough that he can feel Sherlock’s breath quickening against his lips. Sherlock’s eyes fly open, pained and pleading, locking to his as if terrified he would never set eyes on him again. John brings his hands to cradle Sherlock’s head between them.
Mycroft glares at Sherlock, who is too busy wiping his face dry to retaliate. Apparently this was something John was never meant to hear.
of him. The expected moment of shock passed, and he felt John relax, but he didn’t pull away. Neither of them did. He really should, shouldn’t he? What was the plan, again?…
Sherlock gasps, tensing beneath his touch, and John’s hands are shaking but he knows he doesn’t want to pull away. God, he knows that now. The scratchy texture of Sherlock’s stubble against his chin is an entirely new sensation to him — unabashedly masculine — and if he was worried at all that it would feel weird, he needn’t have been. John is soaring. He feels exhilarated, his pulse racing, warmth spreading through the very core of him.
“What app?” John's eyes bore into the back of his head over several minutes of obstinate silence. “Sherlock, what app?”
“Learn anything useful, then, in the bar?” Sherlock asks, seeking a way to not-quite-apologise for his outburst earlier. John shifts his weight, idly kicking his toe against the metal rail.
“Right. So he takes them to some secluded area and then attacks them. No evidence, no witnesses. By the time anyone might suspect him he’s off serving aboard another ship. Clever son of a bitch.”
“Protecting you,” Sherlock whispered, and rested his forehead on John’s in an outward display of intimacy. “Go ahead. Anybody who looks will just assume we’re partners, embraced in a kiss. Do what you need to do.”
He can barely stand to swim more than a few meters before his posture collapses and he is unable to mask the sound of misery that claws its way out of his throat.
True to Sherlock’s word, his penis hung soft and light between his thighs, in stark contrast to John, who was so hard by this point he was desperate to escape his own confining clothes. He set to work quickly stripping everything off, tossing them aside, until they were both exploring each other with their eyes. Sherlock seemed every bit as absorbed in the sight of John as John was with him, and for a moment this was enough for both of them.
Sherlock presses closer to him, one hand coming up to grip his jumper. He scrunches the material between long, pale fingers. “Make it go away,” he begs, his voice almost faltering. The pitiful sound of him makes John’s heart clench in sympathy. The ordeal finally seems to be breaking his resolve.
It’s easy to be hypnotised by it, this lack of sensory input. It reminds him a bit of one of those sensory deprivation chambers: Coffin-sized metal tanks big enough for a single occupant to climb inside, windowless and filled with water. Once the cover is closed, the inside is plunged into total darkness and silence, with gravity a mere afterthought. Supposedly, people find this therapeutic in small doses.
And hospital means that he’s alive. John is mobile enough to be at his bedside, which is another good sign. The only unknown that remains is what happened to his hands.
John shrugs. “Doesn’t sound like a problem to me,” he says, grinning. The corners of Sherlock’s mouth turn up.
Just as he begins to drift, John's phone pings with a new message. He fishes it out and holds it over his face, squinting tiredly at the glowing screen.
As John studies the image, some movement in his peripheral vision catches his attention. Through window at the far end of the room, a flock of gulls glide and circle above the water’s surface. John’s gaze slips past them to the Menorca coastline as it recedes into the horizon, fading to a hazy blue as it shrinks away along with the last traces of dry, solid land. He shudders, closing his eyes against the stark reality of the view. There's no going back now.
He recoils from the touch. Terrified of letting him get too far, John’s hands fly out and pull him back. “What are you doing?”
John’s fought guys like this before; big men who get all cocky and confident as long as they’re hiding behind a weapon they barely know how to use. Just looking at his grip on that blade, John can tell he’s never had to seriously fight with it. Probably relies more on his size to intimidate and overpower his victims with sheer brute force. You couldn’t pin the word ‘finesse’ to this guy with a piece of paper and a thumb tack.
The ringleader of the group stepped forward, an older man in a bespoke suit. Bald, gruff in both voice and appearance, his expensive attire did little to pretty up his image; John couldn’t help but think he looked like a dressed-up boar, for all the good it did him.
“No problem,” John remarks. It’s the last thing either of them says for a long time, both conserving their energy for the long swim ahead.
“Fuck… I don’t… Don’t think I…” John’s mind clouded over. The smell of Sherlock’s skin, the press of his body, the
“No rest for the wicked,” Sherlock quips, not quite feeling the humour in it himself. John raises his brow pointedly.
Sherlock also took a moment to observe them. Then, taking John’s arm, he guided them both over to a spot by the south wall, in between the twin entrances on either side of the room.
They seem caught in the moment. Some unspoken question hovers at Sherlock’s lips, and suddenly John can’t look away from that, either. Finally Sherlock’s gaze breaks away. Laying his head back down, he releases a quiet sigh. “John, what would you do… for someone you cared about more than yourself? Wouldn’t you die for them?”
Heads turn at the spectacle of the drowned man and his tormentor as they paint the carpets a darker shade of blue. John has never felt so humiliated in his life.
Behind him, John’s voice climbs to cover the distance the brief swim put between them. “Sherlock? You alright?”
He’d hoped not to resort to this, but proactive measures are called for. “John, hand me your phone.”
“You know I would,” he says. They both know. But this is the first time either of them have openly acknowledged it, how far they would go, what they would sacrifice to keep each other safe. As for why? John isn’t even sure he could answer that. There is an answer, but it scares him to even think about. Instead, he says: “Now’s not the time for it,” and reassures him with a squeeze.
Before he could finish voicing the flawed sentiment, Sherlock stole another kiss from him, cutting off the words. This time he parted his lips and ran the tip of his tongue pleadingly against the pliant seal of John’s mouth, and John surrendered for him almost immediately.
John drops them back into the bag and crosses his arms. “First of all, I never want to know how you knew what my size was.”
On the plus side, there’s still a couple of hours left before the crew rotates again— time enough that certain other important matters can now be attended to. Thusly, somewhere in the straits between Tunisia and Sicily, Sherlock summons John up to the Lido deck with a vague but urgent-sounding text.
Sherlock had no control over this situation from his position across the room, and neither did John; this was
, he types back, then takes a look at the attachment Sherlock sent him. It’s a police sketch of their target, a man named Mikhail Petrov, based on the description provided by the victim: Bald, muscular, with broad shoulders and a thick, sinuous neck. No distinguishing marks or tattoos. He looks otherwise fairly nondescript. John does his best to commit all the details to memory, but wonders vaguely how on Earth they’re meant to find him on board a ship with over three thousand people roaming around.
The results of Sherlock’s cognitive tests give him the all-clear. It looks like he may not have suffered any long-term effects from his ordeal, though his thirst since awakening has been insatiable. He spends two more days recovering in bed until he is declared well enough for surgery. John wishes him luck, and they part with a tender kiss.
Blood is trickling from John’s nostrils and his nose looks crooked. “The ship,” he croaks, his voice hoarse and nasally. “Is it coming back?”
“They snuck off downstairs, I suspect somewhere around the point when you started sounding a bit breathless,” John said, half-giggling. His hands curled around the nape of Sherlock’s neck, fingers playing through the soft tufts of hair there. Sherlock turned back towards him. John rested their foreheads together, smiling softly, until he felt the tension lift from Sherlock’s body again.
As John struggled to kick his mind back into gear and figure out exactly what this ploy was supposed to be, he felt a pair of hands come to rest on the back of his chair, and then the lips returned, firmer this time, and with them came the uneven breath Sherlock had been holding back before. He felt Sherlock’s body looming over him, and he had to tip his head up further to accommodate him. Sherlock’s mouth slid against his own, parting in a manner that could be nothing short of deliberately intimate. Before he knew what he was doing, John was returning the kiss with zeal.
He flicks at the water, teasing in and out of the range of John's clumsy fury. He makes it appear random, but is tracking their positions carefully, baiting him onward in just the right way. And John, oblivious, beelines for him without noticing that Sherlock is no longer bouncing along the bottom of the pool. When he lunges forward for another swing, his feet find nothing beneath him.
“’Something about kissing someone and guessing something.’ Astute deductions as ever, John, however did you figure it out? You’ll be putting me out of business one of these days, if you keep that up.”
“Don’t talk to me,” he warns, fists clenching so tight that his nails dig into the skin. He can take a lot of abuse, but this has been a step too far even for him. Sherlock doggedly follows him all the way back to his room, hovering behind him even as he fights through the soggy material of his shorts to untangle his room key. By some happy miracle, the electronic key still works. John throws the door closed behind him, imagining for a brief but satisfying second that it gave Sherlock the smack in the face he deserves.
A heavy boot smeared a muddy print on the back of John’s shirt as the brute jerked the rope back. The coils tightened at once, his and Sherlock’s bodies squeezing even closer and forcing a rough grunt out of John’s lungs.
But sometimes he dreams of a different trauma. Something much older, buried deeper in his subconscious. He doesn’t fully remember what happened, he was too young. He only knows the lingering effect it had on his psyche. He was nine at the time, and his young mind did a good job at shielding him from the full horror of it, he supposes. But sometimes, when the night is dark and the air is still, flickers of light and sound drift to the surface of his dreams. He feels the violent roll of the deck beneath him, smells the thick, rain-whipped sea air in his nostrils. He hears his father’s voice sending a panicked mayday on the radio.
He can just see Sherlock’s bare legs dangling off the foot of the bed, his youthful face at the other end pouting at the unfairness of it all like a stroppy teenager. John giggles to himself, playing with the fantasy for a while as the tension in his nerves gradually uncoils. Maybe he should let himself snooze for a few blissful hours, let his body acclimatize to the rolling waves while he sleeps. All the better for him and their mission if it does. According to the ship's itinerary, they won’t be arriving at their first destination, Cagliari, until midnight.
John doesn’t let go of his hand as he leans back, his legs rising up until his toes peek out of the water. He must have kicked his shoes off at some point. Good idea; Sherlock follows suit. Free of their extra bulk, his feet float marginally higher, leaving his wet toes to chill in the night air.
Sherlock isn’t listening to the words so much as the slurred way in which they’re being spoken. He catches a whiff of gin-soaked breath in the air and draws a troubling conclusion.
He hums affirmatively. “I didn’t dream of working with anybody before, but it’s difficult to imagine going back to that now. Being— working alone, I mean.” He pauses, shocked for a moment that the sentiment rings truer than he’d anticipated. He covers it with a coy smile. “There’s something to be said for having a captive audience.”
The fabric fell from his shoulders, bunching around his elbows and exposing his broad chest. Tentatively, John’s hands traced over the firm mounds of his pecs, stroking along his heated skin, feeling the muscles jump and twitch underneath. John grinned into their kiss.
It catches him off-guard. Denial hovers at his lips, but John is once again being too observant at the worst possible time. “It’s superficial,” he says, attempting to wave it away with a half-truth. “Mikhail caught me with the knife. Just stings a bit, that’s all.”
His eyes drifted shut hours ago and feel lightly stuck that way now, crusted with seawater and sore from sleeplessness. It’s nearing morning when he first notices something amiss; he calls, and for the first time, Sherlock doesn’t answer.
They finally arrive at the harbour. John practically leaps out of the oven-like cab, leaving Sherlock to pay the driver. He's so grateful for the breeze that whips at his hair and cools his damp skin that he doesn't even mind that the place stinks of brine and gutted fish. Gulls screech and swoop overhead like flying velociraptors against the deep blue of the sky, and when he turns towards the dock, there it is: The Aurora. A brilliant white behemoth, towering over the far end of the wharf like a wayward cliff of Dover. His mouth falls open. He’d been imagining something half this size; even Sherlock seems impressed by its stature.
“I wasn’t trying to.” Slowly, Sherlock climbs to his feet. “You were struggling. I thought I could help.”
But he can't deny the way his heart expands to bursting whenever John looks at him with pure admiration in his eyes.
The boot on his back shoved them away, sending their bound feet scuffing a clumsy tango along the concrete, grit scattering underfoot. Dark suited goons jeered at them from all sides, drunk on power and victory.
Before he could prevent it, John’s tongue automatically darted out to wet his lips, and they both gasped as he ended up accidentally tasting the tip of Sherlock’s finger. There was a soft pinch, and Sherlock slowly withdrew his hand, presenting a tiny gold fleck.
Sherlock had known this, and everything else about him instantly. Because of course he did— he’s Sherlock Holmes. And he’d accepted it, recognising it as something John simply couldn’t help about himself. It wasn’t a perversion; something more along the lines of a nervous habit, or a tic. John explained to him that while the company of family, friends, or even just people that knew him (but didn’t necessarily know of his unusual proclivity) was a horribly tempting environment, bordering on mental torture, there was also a singular thrill for him in the company of strangers, too.
Sherlock could still remember the way his skin had tingled with delight the first time John had called him ‘amazing’. Even now it still had that same effect. His praise was a novelty that never wore off, steeped as it was in such genuine affection.
Trying to get into the man’s pants after only a day of knowing him? God, he must have seemed a right prat.
He waved it away. “Don’t worry. I’ve never actually tried it, and not sure I see the appeal in doing so. Seems a bit… destructive, physiologically speaking. It’s enough of a worry knowing most of us end up incontinent in our old age. Seems a lot of people are in a hurry to get there far sooner.”
The floor is still wet, but John's knees are aching and Sherlock’s scrutiny is reaching unbearable levels. He needs to retreat, otherwise he’ll just end up blurting it out himself to break the tension. He heads for the stairs up, brushing past Sherlock whose stern gaze is still fixed to the floor. As he reaches the first step, Sherlock speaks. “You’re right, I should turn in. I’ll wash this properly later. Good luck on the boat.”
Sherlock straightens reflexively. “No need to look so shocked. I believe a certain state of undress is allowed up here.”
John found their spot, a pair of aisle seats about midway down. They would have a decent view of the game from here. Down on the field, the pregame ceremony was already underway. John marvelled at how lavish and extravagant it all was. Teams of synchronised performers displayed the national colours while a U.S Army band drummed up a military beat, which tickled John’s sense of nostalgia for his service years.
Mikhail wavers hesitantly, sweat trickling down his neck. His eyes flick over John again, and perhaps this time, he picks up on the subtle clues of his body language, because his lips curl into a sneer and he steps aside, keeping the knife raised. “Fine then,” he rumbles, placing his back to the wall. He ducks his head towards Mindy. “Go back to quarters. Maybe I find you later for another… chat.”
John always gave his best effort to behave himself in public, but there were certain places and situations that proved too much of a temptation. Sherlock’s patience with him was boundless, never questioning the matter whenever his friend gave in to his troublesome needs. He simply did what he could to accommodate him, trusting that John had done everything he could to resist the urge, and never did John detect any amount of shame or disappointment when he couldn’t hold back any longer— only acceptance.
“We have a description and a name, thanks to the testimony given by victim. Enough for me to be going on with, certainly. But they don’t want to make any arrests without what they classify as ‘solid proof.’”
Too far gone to argue, John obeyed, unable to tear his eyes away from the sight of Sherlock unclothing himself. The shirt fell to the floor, and John couldn’t help but admire the sight of him as he divested of his own plaid button-down. Sherlock’s pale body was perfectly toned— not an ounce of fat on him. If not for the muscle mass, he would probably look gaunt. Instead he appeared sleek, powerful, like a jungle cat. Muscles flexed and tensed beneath his skin with the twisting of his frame. John drank in the sight of him.
Hazy-eyed and flushed, lips swollen and red, John gazed at him, his eyes flicking back and forth between Sherlock’s own. “They look…” His lip trembled and his eyes began to gleam with fresh tears. “They’re beautiful.”
Close-up, he could see that Sherlock had already cut several letters out of various magazines, and had arranged them in rows by his feet. There were a multitude of colours and typefaces; some bold, some elaborately curly, some with drop-shadows. It took John a moment to realise that he’d spelt out most of the phrase ‘Happy Birthday’ and had the beginnings of what would probably end up being ‘Mrs Hudson’.
It feels like passing the baton of survival as he demonstrates how to move his arms through the water, to skate them across the water’s surface like a paddle; fingers closed and outstretched, angled just-so to provide stabilisation and lift. John watches, attentive, but his arms stay locked around Sherlock’s shoulders, as if he doesn’t trust that his own body isn’t made of stone and won’t sink just as readily as one.
Mikhail whirls around, and for the first time gives John a good look at his face. It can be summed up in one word: Grizzled. He’s tall, almost as tall as Sherlock, and powerfully built; his pale blue crew uniform does little to hide the muscles straining beneath his skin. The thick tendons in his neck look like roots holding up a tree stump.
“Um, Sherlock…” he began. Sherlock, still moving, didn’t reply. His whole weight was on top of John as he rhythmically worked his limbs against the ropes. He shifted them up and down, up and down, flexing and relaxing his muscles. His breath started coming in shallow pants that made John’s skin raise in goosebumps. Worse still, the motion was causing their hips to rub together in a way that simply couldn’t be ignored.
“Nnnnope,” Sherlock said, side-eyeing John with a mixture of astonishment and competitive jealousy. “It was—”
Talk is sparse once they get going, but he calls out to Sherlock every hour, or what he approximates is an hour, and Sherlock’s strained voice picks up in response. It’s a rasping, pitiful sound, but it’s always nearby. Sherlock’s plan to slipstream in his wake appears to be working, letting John really put his back into it. He cuts through the water despite the drag of his wet clothes and the cold creeping into his muscles. It’s given him hope. They can make it.
“Stars?” Sherlock scoffed, his breath accidentally blowing a scrap of coloured tissue paper off the table. “I thought this was a day scene. You can’t have a big yellow sun
He’s tried to capture these so-called ‘looks’ that Sherlock purportedly gives him on the sly. If he does it at all, he’s very good at hiding it. And as for himself? He doesn’t do that.
The sound rings out over the water. Scanning the vicinity, he sees nothing but reflected starlight. Rolling waves slap against his face unrelentingly, each hit making him deaf and blind for precious seconds when he might have heard a cry for help, or seen the tell-tale splash of a man drowning. But he sees and hears nothing. Nothing but blackness, and the furious pounding of his own blood in his ears.
Sherlock wasn’t repulsed by it, but nevertheless he didn’t feel those things. It’s something he could even get bored of, perhaps. John tried to imagine it: Sherlock pinned under him much like this, naked and flaccid and looking supremely disinterested. And John would be sitting on him and jerking off into his face. The fantasy was surprisingly hot. Would he let John do that? Could he cum all over that beautiful, bored face, and then lean over and lick it off him while he remained passive? Would he pretend to be disgusted by it? The more obscene his fantasy spun, the harder it was getting him just thinking about it.
John was a soldier. He was also a doctor. He’d been to war, had men die in his arms. He was not a squeamish man. Natural bodily functions didn’t phase him, not usually. Not in the time Sherlock had known him, and he had shown John a great many mutilated corpses during their time together.
“You’re doing it wrong. Your face has to go under the water. You’re going to exhaust yourself like that.”
. He couldn’t help it. One sultry glance from Sherlock right then would have brought John fully hard again in seconds.
John rolled his eyes at the remark, refusing to let Sherlock bait him so easily. He was being a moody git for some reason tonight, but he'd been alright earlier. John wondered if something had upset him, but knew it would be pointless to ask. Sherlock's moods were as changeable as the wind. Maybe, hopefully, he'd perk up again soon.
That kiss — not to mention that orgasm — would remain one of the most wonderful moments in John’s memory for the rest of his life. And, knowing Sherlock’s cunning and ingenuity, there would be many more of those in the future.
John didn’t stop packing, or turn to face him when Sherlock asked, redundantly, “What are you doing?”
“Fine,” he forces out. His hand seeks the wound at his side, and finds it: A slim, neat puncture, perfectly in line with his kidney. The area burns where the salt water is seeping inside. More worryingly however, is how warm the surrounding waters feel to his sea-chilled fingers. Judging by the spread of it he must be losing a significant amount of blood.
John sets his tea down on the table and sighs, scrubbing a hand over his face. “Well… What exactly do you want
Sherlock seemed to realise his mouth was hanging open, and shut it with a click. It took John a second to realise what could be troubling him, but when he did, he couldn’t help the warm smile that spread across his face and wrinkled the skin of his eyes.
After a delay that should by all rights embarrass him, John’s medical training kicks back in and he remembers that it’s a good idea to run a few checks on someone who has just emerged from a coma. Still, he can’t help but feel reluctant to untangle his hand from Sherlock’s, burying his excitement beneath something resembling a professional veneer as he sets about checking vitals and responses.
Last to arrive, looking slightly haggard and apologising profusely for the delay, was Greg Lestrade. It was a sad fact of life that this time of year was typically one of the busiest at Scotland Yard. Thefts, murders and rapes all saw a sharp increase during the festive season, and it was difficult to drag a dedicated Detective Inspector away from his work. But he needed this, a short break from the constant pressure and stresses, the harsh realities of life that a man in his line of work was forced to acknowledge every day. He hadn’t missed a 221B Christmas party yet, and he wasn’t about to break his streak. Still, Sherlock told him off for being late.
But that fascination had also scared Sherlock in a way he couldn’t quite comprehend, or explain even to himself. The way John looked at him when he played was unlike anything he’d ever seen directed at him before; it was almost too much. Too raw. It gave him a strange sensation of second-hand vulnerability, as if John looking at him like that could flay him open somehow and physically hurt him, even if he didn’t intend it to. Which was ridiculous, of course. He recognised it as such. But he couldn’t shake the feeling that growing too attached to John’s admiration would leave them both at risk for some terrible, unnameable pain. And so, whenever John paid attention to his music, Sherlock would pretend to be uncomfortable, would stop playing whenever he noticed John staring at him with that look that made his stomach do flips and his fingers forget the notes. Eventually, John stopped paying attention. Nowadays, whenever Sherlock played, John ignored him entirely.
John’s phone vibrates in his pocket again, reminding him that Sherlock is still trying to catch up. Shit— what was the last direction he gave? A little backup would be handy right about now. He can’t drop his guard to read his phone, much less answer it.
Perhaps it was the food. To John’s amazement, Sherlock had helped him clear the entire box of wings. That was more than he’d seen Sherlock eat in an entire week, sometimes. John was about to fold up the box and put it under his seat when Sherlock stopped him.
After a moment to steel himself, he got up and tip-toed as quietly as possible over to Sherlock, who straightened reflexively when he sensed the man approaching. He hesitated for a moment, thoughtfully scratching his chin. Of the group, he had probably the bushiest beard, which could end up being a dead giveaway. But would Sherlock be able to tell? Surely his own stubble would mask some of it? Best be safe, though. Crouching down in front of him, Anderson angled his face in a way that would allow him to give Sherlock a kiss on the chin while preventing most of his own facial hair coming into contact. He also stole John’s idea of holding his breath, keeping his drink of choice secret from the detective’s sensitive nose. It was foolproof; there was no way he could tell who it was.
John climbs into bed beside him, but he doesn’t go back to sleep. He’ll keep watch over Sherlock throughout the night, listening to the calm sounds of his breathing. And whenever he stirs, whenever the another bout of coughing wracks his trembling form, John’s arms will slide around him again and hold him steady, until sleep draws him under once again.
—one thing to use against me,” John managed, pressing himself into the warmth of Sherlock’s palm. The deep chuckle by his ear was satisfying in ways that made little sense for mere sound. The smooth baritone rumbled through him on an express journey straight to his cock.
further up in his schedule, but first he needs to become attuned to the ebb and flow of this new environment. Then, like the silvery dart of fish scale that ripples the surface of a calm pond, any disturbance in the natural rhythm will be all the easier to pick out.
But the message is lost in translation. John recovers quickly, slipping smoothly back into what is no doubt a truly
“Bye Johnny! Sorry we couldn’t get better acquainted. But to be honest, you were never really my type.”
So he did it— John slipped his hand down the front of his trousers to touch the hard length of himself, in front of his best friend, while standing in broad daylight on Regent Street amidst hundreds of people. And it was incredible. Dangerous. So wrong, but it felt so good.
Glances were exchanged around the group. Yes, that did seem like a problem. Not that any of them were particularly uncomfortable with the idea, but what would be the fun of it without any girls playing?
Sherlock’s face is pale, his eyes lightly closed. Swallowing his dread, John cups a hand beneath his flaring nostrils and is relieved when he feels the warm gust of his breath. The tightness in his brow relaxes.
At this, Sherlock’s expression hardens. He lifts his chin and stands taller on his feet. But the confident front is betrayed by the wavering tension in his voice, which comes out a fraction of an octave higher than his usual tone. “Respectfully, John, I don’t think you were dealing with it at all,” he says.
His eyes say what both of them are thinking: Sherlock hasn’t exactly earned trustworthy status recently. Nevertheless, John tilts his chin up and mutters something that sounds like a prayer. Then the weight of him lifts away from his shoulders entirely. For the first few seconds, John’s limbs swish wildly back and forth, frothing the water around him, but soon he finds a gentler rhythm, the movement tightening into something smooth and controlled. The deep lines of worry above his nose loosen incrementally, reflexive fear giving way to a quiet awe, and even joy at his new accomplishment.
And yet, he couldn’t push it out of his mind: The memory of how it felt to be so close to him, being brought over the edge by him, with his scent in his nose and his body pressed close. He couldn’t delete things like Sherlock could. It would be with him for the rest of his life.
don’t do this sort of thing, Sherlock.” He gives up with a sigh and stares resignedly at a spot on the floor.
John takes him further into his mouth, sliding his tongue back and forth as the thick erection presses against his palate. It’s a tight fit. Sherlock’s dick isn’t enormous, but it has a healthy girth to it, and John presses it as far as it will go into the back of his throat without choking him, swallowing around it. The contraction of muscles elicits another voicy exhale from Sherlock, who thankfully remains unaware of John’s decidedly non-professional solution.
“S’pose I deserved it,” John mutters, hooking the glasses into his shirt collar. “Sorry about the drinking. Really. I did go a bit overboard with it. It’s just been a bit… difficult.”
“Worse still, my admittance to being incapable of sexual attraction in the first place made you feel as if you were somehow taking advantage of our friendship, of the naivety you assumed I must have about romantic interests and signs and signals and everything else that comes with being in love.”
The second he steps onto the ship proper, John’s brain refuses to accept the wooden deck as solid ground. Even at a standstill, the gentle rocking of the ship is doing a number on his sense of balance, so much so that his stomach begins churning and making threatening noises at him.
He delivered the last bit with a knowing glance at John, who hid his grin behind a scratching of his nose. His other hand was already preoccupied at the front of his jeans. His cock was out, albeit hidden under the coat, and he was stroking himself covertly.
. As he rotated the paper, he seemed to be cutting a circle around one of the letters. After a full rotation, the cut piece fluttered to the carpet by his toes, and he set the ruined page down beside him.
“Good lord!” Mrs Hudson exclaimed, her hand fluttering at her chest. “No, I’ll definitely be sitting this one out, thank you. This sounds like no game a dotty old lady like me should be playing!”
His diaphragm spasms, and unable to hold it back any longer, Sherlock doubles over in his seat, coughing heavily into the crook of his arm. His laptop slides to the floor with a clatter. His chest squeezes over and over, even as his throat resists, already dry and wrecked from two days of non-stop hacking.
And when John licked his lips, tasting the residue of himself he’d left behind, his breath hitched. Sherlock’s name seemed to catch in his throat. And Sherlock’s brain short-circuited. His heart skipped a beat. The bottom of his stomach dropped out, and it felt like he was falling out of a plane. And then John was kissing him back, softly but eager, as hungry for this as Sherlock himself was. This wasn’t a game anymore, for either of them.
Greg threw his hands in the air, looking defeated. “Well I didn’t expect the ladies to sit out, did I? Oh, forget it, I’m rubbish at this. Someone else pick a game, for gawd sake.”
Sherlock had come up with the coat idea several weeks ago, and so far it was proving itself an invaluable tool for his secret wanking pursuits. It gave John many more varied opportunities to play with himself in plain sight, so long as he held the coat a certain way to cover his groin, and left Sherlock free to act more naturally in public, rather than always having to be in John’s space to shield him from wandering eyes. It was a little safer this way, which was a weight off both their minds.
Sherlock tangles their fingers together. "Angelo's," he says, his eyes sparkling. "Ask me again there."
“You’re going to exhaust the both of us,” he says, his strength ebbing. “You need to tread water so you can float on your own.”
If pressed, he’d struggle to pinpoint the reason why he feels such a strong desire to stay close by Sherlock’s side. To protect and support him, obviously. To help him with the Work, not that Sherlock typically needs it. But there’s another reason, and he thinks it has something to do with the way the act seems to fall away whenever John tells him ‘
"I found that I enjoyed those acts with someone I truly cared about, even if I didn’t receive physical pleasure from it. But I could never be someone’s casual boyfriend. It’s all or nothing, with me.”
John glanced around warily. “You think so?” to which Sherlock nodded in response. “You’re right, then; time to leave.”
It doesn’t matter now; he isn’t letting Sherlock out of his sight again. But floating like this isn’t going to last— they’re rapidly losing steam. John eases them back, pulling Sherlock over him and allowing him to lay supported by John’s chest, and it’s almost by necessity that John has to begin swimming like this, pinned underneath him and dragging him along. Without the movement, there wouldn’t be enough lift to keep him high enough to breathe, every upstroke plunging his ears and nose back under, sending pangs of fearful adrenaline down his spine.
John was infinitely grateful to have someone not only accept this odd trait of his, but to help him through ordinary day-to-day activities. It was truly a Godsend. He had no idea how he would cope without his friend’s non-judgemental support. And rather than offering distractions or urging him to stop, as any well-meaning therapist he’d avoided discussing it with might suggest, Sherlock had surprised John by proposing a rather unorthodox solution to his problem.
His voice breaks. The sound of it shatters something inside John, and he slides out of his chair, mind and body on auto-pilot. “Christ, Sherlock…”
“Yes you bloody did!” John yells, the outburst startling Sherlock and causing a few nearby passengers to turn their heads towards the commotion. “This is about you having to control everything, as usual. You saw the reaction I had and couldn’t leave well enough alone. You had to figure it out. You had to try to
“Closeness,” he replied, breaking the kiss to rest their foreheads together. Affection wrote itself in the lines of his eyes, the upward tilt of his mouth. “It makes me feel warm inside, and glad.”
He takes a shaky breath and closes his eyes, as if he can’t bare to see John’s reaction. “I am so sorry if this means the end of our friendship, John, but I fell in love with you the first day we met and it only got worse from there.”
“I don’t want to,” Sherlock pouts, his vocal chords catching on the roughness in his sore throat. He feels a familiar twinge in his lungs, another coughing fit threatening to bubble up at any moment, and suppresses it with all his might.
On the day of Sherlock’s release from the hospital, Mycroft sends a private car to take them back home to Baker Street.
. That’s well within acceptable health standards. Human beings can survive up to two weeks without serious long-term side-effects; that’s a fact pulled straight from one of your own medical textbooks, by the way. Honestly, your proclivity towards time-wasting activities like sleep borders on unabashed gluttony.”
“You think I care about carrying on living in a world that doesn’t have you in it, you mad sod?” He hugs Sherlock’s trembling body closer to him, his finger disappearing into the soggy mess of dark curls. He presses a kiss to the back of Sherlock’s head. “Don’t be daft. It wouldn’t be worth it.”
John gripped his coat, taking a moment to steady himself, before putting his softening penis away and giving his friend the hardest glare he could manage given his sleepy, post-orgasmic state.
John knew it to be true, and it was one of many things he’d grown to cherish about his friend. He slipped into his coat and they made a speedy exit, before someone were to discover the messy evidence of his misdemeanour. Sherlock later informed him that the gallery cameras still hadn’t been fixed, so there wasn’t any incriminating video footage. And nobody would assume the spill was a bodily fluid; more likely, someone having smuggled a drink past the security guard and then spilling it accidentally.
Salvatore’s grin widened until he broke into a rattling, sickly laugh. His goons joined in, right on cue. “Oh, Mr Holmes! You forget your current predicament. What nets should I need to slip, now that the fisherman himself has been hooked?”
John hoarsely called after him, but he was already across the room and pointedly not paying any attention. The other visitors idled and shuffled slowly between displays around the gallery, and none of them were currently looking his way, but he knew that could so easily change at any moment. And despite the very real danger of discovery, John simply couldn’t stop himself; he was rooted in place, terrified and excited, his heartbeat racing. He couldn’t make himself tuck it back in or turn around to hide it; the risk only spurred him on, a singular thrill that coiled tight like a spring in his abdomen, urging his hand to fly faster over his stiff and blushing dick.
“Last night,” Sherlock says, bouncing on his heels. “I’m surprised you didn’t notice. It wasn’t exactly subtle. But then, you weren’t exactly at your most observant at the time.”
Greg was proving to be pretty awful at this so far. But another spin landed on Molly again, who decided to just get it over with. This time, she kissed his cheek, leaving behind a faint red smudge of lipstick. It was by a blind guess, literally and figuratively, that he finally got it right. He looked relieved to finally rejoin the group, leaving his wooden chair behind for the others and opting to perch on the arm of the sofa next to Mrs Hudson for the remainder of the game. He finished off his beer and opened another.
And then so many pieces click into place at once. It’s like the cypher to all the coded messages Sherlock has been subconsciously sending him over the years. The reason he never showed any interest in romantic involvement is the same reason he criticised every one of John’s dates: He was in love with him. He was jealous. He was
But now that this is really happening, he feels at a loss how to proceed. Sherlock hasn’t moved except to grip his sheets, as if he expects the ground to give way to a sinkhole any second. Maybe this isn’t what he wanted at all. Perhaps the whole idea of expressing himself in this way is so alien, so unpractised, that he’s as lost as John feels. Sherlock’s thoughts are difficult enough to read at the best of times, but it’s impossible to tell what’s going on inside his head as John retreats just enough to look into his face.
He giggled at that. “Yes sir,” he answered with a mock salute. He slid out of his underwear, tossing them unceremoniously aside.
“Show me, John,” he whispered. “Don’t hold back. Let me be everything you need. All I want or need in return is
John eyes the loosened tie around his neck; it’s unusual to see Mycroft Holmes anything less than immaculately dressed. He really must be worried. “I know,” he offers. “Sorry. I just don’t like saying it.”
Sherlock seems mildly amused by it all, obstinately blocking him even as John tries to pry his grip away. Beneath him, the ship begins to tip in an entirely new direction, and he has no choice but to stop fighting and grab fistfuls of Sherlock’s shirt for stability. He swallows down a wretched wave of sickness, squeezing his eyes shut against the rising urge to vomit.
John moved to clamber his way out, but Sherlock gripped his arm. “Not yet,” he said. “Wait until the car starts moving. They’ll notice the weight let up if we get out now.” They sat poised like stone statues, waiting for the moment. Then, the lurch of the engine. “Now!”
“Glad you’re in such a giddy mood,” Sherlock’s voice came out rough from the exertion, his breath hitching between the words. “You could help, you know.”
