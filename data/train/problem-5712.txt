“Cut the shit, Rogers. You may have been born 70 years ago, but I know for a fact you knew what it meant for guys to like guys.” Tony interrupted, seething. If Steve didn’t want him, so be it. But at least give the real reason and not some bullshit excuse about not knowing what was going on.
“I wish there was more we could do for Mr. Stark, but there are some things that even science can’t heal.” The doctor said. His voice sounded further away, as if they were leaving already.
“I’m the worst man in America. Maybe even the entire world. I took you for granted and I mislead you for months and I'm so sorry. I don’t know why I was so scared, you would’ve been the best soulmate. You’re intuitive and brilliant and so fucking funny. I’m sorry I wasted your time and I’m so beyond sorry for not telling you.”
The pages were packed with Tony. In some, he was smiling, or laughing. In others, he was focused on his work, building various things with a look of intense focus. In others, Steve had drawn what their life could’ve been. In a few, he’d sketched a beautiful lake house, surrounded by lush trees and grass. I another, he’d drawn two children out on the banks of the water, collecting shells and grinning. The next was the worst, he hadn’t been able to look at it in months. It showed the children from before presenting shells in their pudge hands to Tony. His hair was grey at the temples, and his smile lines were slightly deeper, but he looked so happy. To his left, Steve had sketched himself, looking at the scene and smiling contentedly.
Steve couldn’t respond, he just looked at Tony. When he saw the other man, the messy hair and dark circles, he felt his face crumple. He didn’t want this to be over. He didn’t want Tony to play with him like this.
He held up his hand, signaling for his teammate to come sit with him on the couch. Tony looked confused, and possibly annoyed, but sat down anyways.
“Yes, there is. There’s someone out there wearing the same mark as you and counting down the seconds until they get to know you.” She comforted, approaching him slowly.
“It’s just your mark, Tony. Nothing more.” The doctor explained, chuckling as he pointed to Tony’s bare chest.
“It’s not right? Do you have some kind of issue with me, Rogers?” Tony asked. Here we go, Steve thought. The fight was unavoidable.
Another month passed and Bucky had returned to Wakanda again, preferring to send most of his time alone in the peaceful quiet he found there. The security and routine were good for him, better than busy life in the tower was. Steve missed him though. He was so fucking lonely without him. Tony still wouldn’t speak to him, preferring to glare over morning coffee and stare on the way to the battlefield.
“You were just going to let me live my life thinking I didn’t have anyone!” Tony roared, hoping Steve could understand how hurt he was. “I thought the reactor ruined me, Steve! I thought I would never find someone with my mark on them! And this whole time you hid it under your stupid t-shirts and your suit and acted like it wasn’t even there. You never even mentioned it.” His voice cracked at the end, revealing just how affected he really was by the whole thing. He wanted to curl up and cry, but he couldn’t when the other man was staring at him like that. He was too angry.
One night, a few weeks after his departure, someone was banging on his door. It was too late for any SHIELD visitors, Steve thought as he grabbed the shield and walked to the door. He assumed it was Bucky, they’d discussed a visit the day before, but he’d assumed it would be him flying out to see Bucky, not the other way around.
“Alright, alright.” Tony laughed, moving away from Steve so they could remove any articles of clothing that were separating them. Steve hadn’t heard Tony laugh in- it didn’t matter. He had to focus. When Tony climbed back onto Steve’s lap, he pressed a bottle of lube into his hand.
He was. But that wasn’t what caused Steve to freeze. In the photo, Tony Stark was shirtless. Steve had seen plenty of shirtless men, he was in the army for God’s sake. Regardless, this was shocking because on Tony’s chest, spread across the tan expanse were red lines. Not just any red lines either. They were raised and specifically patterned in a shape that Steve had only seen on one other person. Himself.
Steve just shrugged and pressed the slice to Tony’s cheek, laughing when it stuck momentarily and then fell to the floor. Then, it was just two men pressed together against the wall. Steve could feel Tony’s heart pounding against him. He was sure his own heart was beating just as fast, if not faster. His blood was roaring in his ears. He’d never been this close to another man before. More importantly, he’d never been this close to his soulmate before.
“What in the actual hell gave you that idea?” Tony asked, forcing Steve to look at him again. “I didn’t come here to hurt you, Steve. I came to tell you that I miss you and I want you to come back. And maybe, I want what’s in that picture too.”
“Couch” Tony gasped between kisses, trying to steer the larger man towards the inviting cushions. As they made their way over, Steve sat, pulling tony onto his lap and grasping at the hair on the nape of his neck. This was nothing like any kiss he’d ever had. Sure, he didn’t have much experience, but it wasn’t his first time kissing someone. But this, this was far better.
He stomped to the lab, imagining hundreds of things to yell at the other man. ‘Why are you doing this? Why can’t you see that I’m sorry?’ or ‘Stop being so childish!’. Maybe he could hit him with a ‘I’m Captain America! I’m not leaving my team.’ or ‘Stop, please. I love you and I’m sorry.’ What? No. No he would not say that. When he reached the door he didn’t pause to think, just stormed in and demanded that Friday cut the music.
“If it wasn’t for the team, I wouldn’t have ever called you here. But teams have to be united, that’s just how it works. So, I’m asking you to come back. If you have a problem with me, you don’t have to see me. I avoid the main floors for the most part.” Tony began, voice devoid of any emotion.
One night, after one too many drinks, he kissed her. After only a few seconds, she pulled away. “Tony,” She said, staring at him. “We can’t.” She turned her hand over and removed her silver cuff bracelet that he had bought her on one of their business trips in France. There, on her dainty wrist, was a blue swirl.
“It’s not what it looks like.” He says, bringing a large palm up to cover the mark. Tony clambers off his lap quickly, leaving him vulnerable to the cold seeping into his bones as the weight of his mistake sunk in.
Tony wrenched his arm from Steve’s grasp, finally showing a bit of emotion as he turned to face the larger man. “Last rule, do not ever touch me again.” And with that, he was on the elevator, doors sliding shut as Steve crumpled to his knees.
Steve tugged Tony’s shirt over his head, peppering kisses across his skin before moving back to his lips and letting his hands explore the other man’s chest. His fingers moved to the reactor, noticing the way Tony’s skin raised slightly where scars had been left. He traced each one, listening to the way Tony’s breath hitched slightly.
“Stevie, you have to relax!” Bucky laughed as he prepped Steve for his night out with Miss Carter. Steve had been jittering about the camp all day in anticipation.
After the first week or so, Steve settled into a routine. He would wake up early and meet Sam for a run, completing a few miles before and after their meet-up as well. Then, he’d return home and shower and dress before going to his balcony to read or draw for a few hours. After that he’d review any new files from Fury and meet with any officials. He was still the team leader, after all.
“On, Steve, don’t cry.” Tony murmured, pulling the larger man into him and wrapping his arms around Steve’s shaking shoulders.
“You don’t know how badly I want to be here, Tony. You’ll never understand how impossible it is for me to walk away from you.” Steve argued, walking back towards the other man, furiously wiping a tear off his own cheek. He was supposed to be strong right now, for both of them.
As Tony flopped onto the couch next to her, she laughed and relaxed back into her seat. “He’s really not bad! Sure, he’s a bit behind the times, but he’s a great conversationalist. And he draws too!”
If someone would’ve told Steve that one day, he would miss Tony’s jokes, he would’ve laughed. Now, he could cry. He missed the name calling and the stories and the jabs. He missed it all and he couldn’t do anything to get it back. More than that, he missed the relationship he thought they would have someday.
Steve knew he had to leave. He couldn’t keep hurting Tony and he couldn’t keep allowing Tony to destroy him. It had to end before they ended up broken beyond repair. It had to end if not for themselves, for the team. He stood slowly and walked to the door. He could feel Tony’s eyes tracking his movements as he approached the exit.
As Steve closed the distance between them, something inside Tony snapped. His eyes shone with new conviction and anger.
Tony broke the kiss again, peppering kisses down Steve’s neck instead. Leaving marks that would fade within minutes due to the serum. He grasped the hem of Steve’s shirt and tugged it up. “Off. Want this off.” He said, tracing Steve’s abs with his hands as Steve quickly tore off his white tee, forgetting about the light red lines that it had been hiding.
“I’m sorry, was that too much? I don’t know how much you’ve done with a guy before. I just couldn’t resist I guess--” He began, trailing off as his eyes quickly moved over Steve’s chest. “Wait. Just a fucking minute.” He said, leaning back to take in the faded lines.
Steve didn’t fall back to sleep that night, or the next for that matter. He didn’t go back to the lab again, vowing to be satisfied with the looks he received every once in a while.
Steve’s eyes were wet with unshed tears and Tony wanted so badly to say sorry and pull him closer. But how could he? How could he apologize when the only one who’d done anything wrong was Steve?
At some point, Tony flipped them, straddling Steve’s lap and raking his nails along Steve’s back. When one hand trailed down to Steve’s waistband, he couldn’t stop the moan that ripped from his chest.
Steve’s heart sank. Bucky still hadn’t met his match, no matter how much effort he put into her. He wasn’t the only one on the hunt for his match. Many of the Commandos had allowed their marks to be photographed for some article, hoping their lady would see it and send them a letter. Apparently, their celebrity status had caused the magazines to sell out within hours. The strategy had worked for some, but not Steve or Bucky, who were left with no matches, not a single prospective soulmate in all of America. But now, Steve found his girl and Bucky was still alone.
“Oh.” Steve said. “Yeah, no, I guess you’re right. Don’t know what came over me. I’m just gonna-” He gestured towards the door, holding his sweats and his t-shirt in one hand.
Pepper had just laughed and asked him about the deal they were trying to cut with a company in Sweden, distracting Tony from the pang in his chest as he thought about how Steve wanted nothing to do with him. He couldn’t figure out why it mattered so much to him. Sure, Steve was attractive—practically an Adonis—but he’d had silly crushes before, and they never left him feeling so torn up about little things like this.
“I didn’t know what to say to you. I’d just gotten out of the ice and I didn’t even know that this was a possibility and--” Steve continued on.
He never even got a chance to prove that he could do it. He could be a good soulmate. He would’ve done anything to make sure Steve knew that. He thought that as his friend, Steve would’ve been able to see that he wasn’t so bad after all. Wrong. Obviously.
“I don’t know what you want me to say to him, Miss Potts. He made things awfully clear last time we talked.” Came a reply from Steve. He sounded somber. Good, Tony thought, he should be sad. Tony tried to uncurl from his position when someone entered the room again. It was humiliating to be rendered practically useless in front of anyone, but especially Pepper. She was so strong. And Tony felt so weak.
There, near the center of his chest, dark red lines were bleeding up from under his skin. “Oh my god!” He breathed, reaching a shaking hand up to touch the lines as they began to raise.
Tony didn’t leave his lab for days. He spent most of the time laying on the small couch and doing everything in his power to avoid thinking of Steve. He felt empty inside—completely drained of emotion. This whole time, his soulmate had been right there. He’d been so close, and Tony hadn’t even gotten a chance.
When Steve stepped into the tower, things felt so off. It used to be his home and now it was a place filled with so much pain. So much pain, and he was the cause of all of it. His heart sank. As he stood glumly, waiting for instruction on where to go, the elevator chimed.
A tearing feeling spread through his lower region when two rough, spit slicked fingers showed themselves harshly into his hole. He cried out and tried to close his legs but the man standing in between them prevented him from doing so.
“That was for dropping out of school without a word, that was for not calling us, that was for not letting us know that you had been kidnapped, tortured and fucking raped! Six months ago! We had to find out from Mrs Jarvis! We were worried sick! We tried to call you but you had changed your number! We dropped everything to get here the second Ana told us where you were! What were you thinking!?”
“Okay. Okay I'm on my way.” Said Bucky before hanging up. He quickly wrote down the car's registration number before he could forget it and took a deep breath and started to run back home. He texted the number of the car to Phil and told him to find it ASAP.
Bruce gave him a confused look but did as he was told. He pulled over and looked at Tony, waiting for an explanation.
“I know, love. It's okay, you'll see them soon again. I don't think that neither Pepper or Rhodey will let you go that easily.”
Steve looked up from his phone and towards his team in silence. That silence probably would have continued of Bruce hadn't spoken up.
In the middle of it all stood a distressed Clint and no sign of Tony. He had told them that it looked like this when he arrived and that Tony was nowhere to be found. But he had overheard a witness to the whole thing tell the police that it had been a man dressed in black with a red octopus with a skull as a head had thrown the grenade but that was all that he remembered before the explosion went off.
Tony told him about the reason why he was up so early. He told him about his father's abuse and his mother's neglect. Steve got to know that the only good thing about the life in the mansion had been his butler Jarvis and his wife Ana that he still called and met up with whenever he could.
Brock used a hand to press his chest down and pinning him on the floor and used the other to tug Tony's pants and underwear down. He immediately started to spread the younger one’s legs so that he could settle in between them.
“Because I don't have the right equipment for the amount of injuries you have and because you look two seconds away from passing out.” He deadpanned, however he could not conceal the concern he felt at the sight of his best friend.
“Great!” Ty exclaimed while feeling satisfaction spread inside of him “How about we meet at Starbucks around six this afternoon?”
After calming Tony down they were both so exhausted that they just curled up together and fell asleep on Tony's bed, like every night. Tony slept better when he knew that Steve was there to keep him safe and Steve felt better knowing that his fella was safe with him.
“Hey, hey, calm down, calm down. It's just me, you're safe now Tony, I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you, I promise.” Came Steve’s gentle but firm voice. Tony's eyes found his and he started to calm down. Large arms wrapped themselves around him protectively and he was pulled into a strong chest. They sat like that for a few minutes before Tony's breathing had gone back to normal. Tony cleared his throat and and opened his mouth.
Anyway here is another chapter for you who are still reading this garbage and I thank your for your patience. I love and appreciate you so much!
Btw, did any of you guys see Infinity War? My soul is broken and I wanna sue MARVEL for psychologically destroying me.
“Anthony Edward Stark, don't you ever say those things about yourself again. You are the best friend a guy could ever ask for and you deserve everything good in this world, especially after all the shit you have gone through. You are the smartest, nicest, most generous person I have ever had the pleasure of befriending. I knew it from the moment I first saw you on campus, fifteen years old, looking lost and with a black eye that this guy was gonna be my responsibility and that I was gonna enjoy every single second of it.”
“Tony, you know that you don't have to force yourself into anything because you think it'll please me, right?”
Steve froze for a moment before kissing back and wrapping his arms around Tony's waist who wrapped his own around Steve’s neck in return.
Steve still kept his hold on Tony while he settled down on the bed and pulled his darling close to him while whispering reassuringly. After a few minutes Tony had calmed down and Steve loosened his grip a little bit so that he could meet Tony's eyes. Steve's heart broke at the sight of Tony's bruised face now covered in tears and his eyes bloodshot. He cupped the brunette’s face with both hands and wipes away his tears and then pressing a kiss to his forehead before re wrapping his arms around Tony, cautious of his injuries.
Natasha, Clint and Bucky were smirking at him when they saw him in only his pants and hickeys covering his neck and parts of his chest.
“Well, mr Rogers is out of a successful surgery and is now resting, but as you all probably could see mr Rogers was in a very bad shape. He has many injuries like burns, deep cuts and some internal bleeding. He has several broken fingers and ribs and his right collarbone is fractured. We are very lucky that one of those ribs didn't puncture his lung since it had been poking at it when you got him here.
“Hey.” Tony steps further into the apartment, each step edging closer to Steve and their daughter. “How was the compound?”
“You didn’t.” Steve shakes his head and makes an attempt to sit up, only to get as far as half way and propping himself up on his elbows. “It was him. He was…”
The rest of the party isn’t all bad. The cake was delicious and the games weren’t the worst party games in the world. Tony would be lying if he said he didn’t grow upset when he lost. He blames his hormones.
Tony huffs and sits back down on the sofa. He’s not sure what they’re supposed to do now. It also didn’t help that Jarvis had abandoned him. He thought for sure the AI would’ve continued to speak and try to get to know Peter more. But of course that wasn’t Jarvis’ job. It was Tony who needed to get to know his son.
Dodger is there for all of Peter’s high and low moments. He’s there to offer warmth and comfort when Peter is sick or scared. He’s there to make Peter laugh, and he’s there to run around and play.
Peter doesn’t say it out loud but there was honestly more his dad can do for him. Making a suit was nice, but Peter wanted more from him. It was just a matter of if and when he’d get the relationship he so badly wanted.
“You can talk to me. I’m always here if you want to gush about cute boys or vent about school or how being a teenage girl is the worst thing in the world. I’m here for those things.”
He takes small, cautious steps toward the toilet. He already knows what he’s going to find, but it steals his breath away when he glances down in the bowl. The bloodied clump of cells will forever be burned into his mind. He wishes he didn’t have to see this; wishes he didn’t have to clean up his child’s remains. This was all wrong.
Peter’s tired of hearing those words. Everyone was sorry for him and his loss, but those weren’t the words he wanted to hear. He wanted to hear that this was just a nightmare, that his papa was still alive.
“You know you could slow down.” Sam hunches over, grabbing his knees and panting heavily. “Some of us aren’t like you.”
“He’s being looked over now,” Natasha says, gesturing toward the room on her right. It’s tempting to rush through the door to find out for himself, but it’s like she can read his mind and she stops him from following through. “Wait. Let me take the baby.”
“Not pregnant,” Steve sighs. He folds his arms over his chest, closing in on himself. The tears are burning now but he doesn’t let them fall. He can’t cry again.
Steve is already in bed and on the verge of falling asleep. Tony joins him, spooning up right behind him and wrapping an arm around him, his hand splayed over the large bump. The activity from their son has died down; Harly was asleep.
Tony smiles and situates the tray over Steve’s middle. It’s a little wobbly due to the large baby bump he’s sporting. Tony curls up beside Steve and snatches a strip of bacon from off the plate, munching on it happily.
“Good. I had him print some pictures.” Tony holds up an orange envelope. He steps closer into the room so he can hand the envelope to Steve. “I figured you want new ones. I don’t know if you’ve ever-”
Steve continues with his story, vision blurring with tears as he’s forced to relive the horror Hydra brought upon him. He tells Fury about the pups and the plan to create the perfect alpha. He tells him about Alexander Pierce and how cruel and evil the alpha really was.
Once the call ends, Peter drops his phone and jumps out of bed to be ready to meet his new lab partner.
Steve nods but refuses to turn around. “I know. I didn’t mean to push you. That wasn’t my intention. I just thought I could get to know you a little better. Especially since we’re…” his hand falls to his belly.
Tony gasps dramatically. “You are!” He tickles Peter and the little boy erupts in a fit of giggles. “Is it daddy?”
Peter rushes out of the jet, a smile forming on his face from the small victory. But he’s reminded that he had more to do than sneak off the jet.
Steve watches as they leave, and for the first time, wishes they wouldn’t. The door shuts behind them.
He’s running late but that was to be expected. Running late for a meeting in the same building he resides in shouldn’t be a thing-even Pepper would agree- but this morning Tony decided to switch up his daily routine.
“Okay, okay,” Steve knows better than to keep his little one waiting. Peter usually didn’t throw tantrums and scream, but he was still two-years-old and it wasn’t called the terrible twos for nothing.
The pain tapers off into a dull throb and he’s able to relax again. It’s not for long, and the pain returns, this time starting in the same place and wrapping around his belly. It makes him gasp, and attract attention from
“Lift your shirt for me please,” Bruce instructs and Steve does as he’s told, lifting the hem of his shirt until the fabric is bunched up above his belly. He flinches when a cold gel is applied to the bump. “Sorry,” the beta apologizes with a sheepish grin. “It’s a little cold.”
Peter sighs and stretches out his fingers again, letting his palm roam over the shield the statue has in its hand.
Sam rolls his eyes again and shakes his head. “I’m not getting into this. I don’t need you to punch me again. The cat’s all yours.”
“I don’t know,” Tony repeats. “Everything seemed fine before I had to leave and then...I don't know. He-he called and...this is my fault. I never should’ve left.”
“Hey, Pete, you hungry?” Bucky asks. His question goes unanswered, just like he knew it would. Peter always shuts down after Steve leaves.
He was extremely good looking. Tony didn’t know such a person could even exist until he met Steve Rogers. Steve’s eyes were Tony’s favorite feature. Sure his Adonis body didn’t go ignored, but his eyes were addicting. It was easy for Tony to get lost in them.
Tony peers up at Steve from his mug and nods. “Of course,” he says after taking a drink. “I’m gonna be there every step of the way. Trust me, I’ll be that hands on dad. Dirty diapers are not a problem.”
Peter sniffs and wipes at the tears running down his face. He chokes back a sob, and cups his mouth to hide any suspicious sounds from his parents.
Sam was easier to open up to. They could talk about anything and everything. Most of their conversations consisted of Sam trying to catch Steve up to date on what he’s missed. Apparently Steve’s missed so much that he’s started to keep a journal of everything just so he can remind himself.
Steve inhales sharply. “I just don’t understand why now. You had no problem with this job in the past.”
He gets his answer when she begins to cry. Tony lets out a heavy sigh, hating the fact that he had to wake up his tired husband. It was times like this when he wishes he could bottle feed her.
“Beautiful.” Tony pulls away and rests his hands over Steve’s shoulders, meeting his husband’s sad eyes. “Honey, I don’t know how many times I have to say it but you’re so beautiful. I’ll say it every second of every day if I have to. Why don’t you see it?”
Tony is closer enough, close enough for Steve to reach out and touch him. He’s careful when he does it. He cups Tony’s cheek, their eyes locking. Tony’s never appeared so broken.
“Oh. What are you doing here and-” Tony stops himself. The last thing he wants to do is comment on Steve’s appearance and make him even more uncomfortable than he already was. But Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t intrigued.
“Steve, I panicked and I’m sorry. I just...hey, it’s going to be okay. We’ll fix this. We’re a team, remember?”
“Yeah or we can cancel the whole shower and do this. It is your birthday, remember?” Tony chuckles and pulls Steve even closer and presses his lips to the side of his head.
“Hey, bud,” Steve greets and cranes his neck to peek over Peter’s shoulder to greet Ned with a little wave, then he turns back to his son. “I know you guys are doing homework but I just wanted to make sure you were okay.”
The call ends and Tony heaves out a heavy sigh. He hates leaving her in the dark. She was usually the one he confided in, and now he was keeping a secret from her. She wouldn’t understand the situation no matter how hard he tried to explain it. He didn’t even understand it. He didn’t have all the details, and a part of him isn’t sure if he wants to.
Nick nods as he considers this. “He would be useful. His abilities are extraordinary, I’ll give him that. Are you sure you’re ready to step down? The world still needs you.”
Peter immediately props himself up on one of his elbows and turns to face his father. “Are we both giving up the superhero stuff?”
Ever since Peter’s birth, something shifted between them. They hadn’t fought once since they learned about their son. Even when they should be during those sleepless nights. Instead they’ve managed to work together. They’ve even grown a little closer.
He plays along and paints the room and even goes baby shopping with Steve and Natasha. They’re not sure what the gender is yet. Steve’s already admitted that he didn’t care as long as their baby was healthy. That’s all that mattered.
His eyes burn with tears and he blows out a breath to calm himself, not wanting to give into the pain. He needed to be strong. He needed to pick himself up and keep fighting.
“Yeah,” Peter nods and buckles himself. “We talked about Alpine. Or I talked. I guess he just listens now.”
Rumlow returns back to his leader’s side, the pup held tightly in his arms. Steve glances toward his mate, whining softly, hoping he’d get some kind of response in return. He doesn’t.
Knowing there was no winning when it came to Tony and his stubbornness, Happy is forced to surrender and back off. Tony walks him out.
“But if you do want to meet him, talk to me or Nat or anyone but Buck. He’ll...it’s going to take some time for him to come around.”
“Hon,” Tony starts and Steve rolls his eyes, glad that Tony can’t see him. “He’s a teenager. Teenagers lie and do stupid shit. I know I did.”
Tony takes a deep breath to calm himself and plops down in one of the chairs near Steve’s bedside. Steve is still asleep, enjoying the bit of comfort he has before the contractions are too strong for sleep.
It’s tempting to return back to his apartment and spend the rest of the day locked in there, but being away from his friends is the last thing he needs. There were still times when Peter would grow fussy and refuse to calm down despite Steve’s best efforts. It was getting better, but it wasn’t just his upset baby that Steve was worried about.
“You okay?” Tony asks, running his hands on the inside of Steve’s thighs. He keeps his eyes glued to the omega’s face, searching for any indication that they should stop.
Steve lets out a yawn and reaches for Tony’s hand, interlacing their fingers. He doesn’t fall back asleep right away. His mind is racing, preventing him from finding any rest. He traces his finger along one of Tony’s, relishing the familiar feeling of rough skin against his own.
“Shut up.” Natasha warns him, then she’s coming over to get a closer look at the new babies. She coos softly. “They’re so beautiful. Can I hold one?”
Steve knew when something was wrong with his son. Peter was a quiet kid, but when he was sick or dealing with something, he shut down. He was doing that now and Steve just knew Peter was being secretive. The issue was Steve didn’t understand why. They had an open door policy and Peter usually came to him or Tony when he needed advice or was sick.
Im updating again! This chapter is a little fluffy too since all the drama is finally over! Well, almost. I’ll get into Steve’s therapy and all that stuff later. I’m not done with this story yet! 😊
“You didn’t know. How could you? I didn’t even know his name until the other day. Crazy, isn’t it? For years I’ve been under his watch and never knew his name.”
Tony finds that he doesn’t have to try too hard to adjust his mood. For once he’s not complaining about his sore back or the heartburn-never say never because eventually he’s going to start once he helps himself to the food- and he’s able to enjoy the party his friends have thrown for him.
The move back to New York wasn’t for a couple of more weeks. Steve had wanted to wait until Peter was a little older before they packed up and moved to their forever home. It was exciting to be going back, but at the same time there’s a fear that hangs over Steve. New York was his home, but it was also the home of his abuser.
Peter is eight now. More and more every day he was surprising Steve. He was smart for his age, something he mostly likely inherited from his father. He resembled Tony more now than the day he was born. It was difficult to see so much of the man he loved in his son.
With a yawn, Tony makes his way toward the kitchen to set up a pot of coffee. He still remembers where Steve keeps everything and in no time he has the pot going and two mugs out on the counter. He doesn’t bother with breakfast, knowing he’ll end up burning the place down if he were to try. They’ll just have to grab a bite to eat while they’re out.
Steve nods and gestures for Morgan when she starts to whimper. “I think she’s hungry again. I can feed her before Nat comes.”
Tony scoffs. “I had my moments. My mother loved me. I guess she was like yours. They did the best they could.”
“I guess. At least you don’t have to do this. This was the plan all along right? You get to stay buff while I blow up.”
Tony smiles sadly. His husband was strong and overcame a lot in the past. But this time seemed different, this time he gave up the fight. He was broken.
“Yeah, guess he is,” Steve agrees and he gives Dodger another pat on the head. “So you’re really okay with this?” He asks Tony.
For once everything seemed right, but the project was still Nick’s priority. After two years of trial and tribulation, he was ready to give the world back what they had lost.
“Oh right.” Steve leans back in his chair with a huff and runs a hand through his hair. “Guess it’s just been a crazy day.”
“I know I said I wanted to do this,” Tony begins, the smile never leaving his face. “And trust me, I’m not only doing this because we have our pups, but because I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
“Your appointment is today, remember?” Steve says and he steps into the room to open the curtains and let some light into the dark room. Peter groans again and turns away from the bright light.
“Fuck. Gonna…” Is the only warning Tony gives before he’s coming inside Steve. He ducks his head down, burying his face in Steve’s neck and grunting against the skin he’s marked up. His body shivers and his hips stutter. He pulls out and rolls over onto his back.
“Hi, sweetheart,” he coos, and adjusts the makeshift blanket around her. She continues to announce her displeasure with her new home. It’s a beautiful sound. “Shh. It’s okay. You’re all right.”
Steve huffs out a laugh and a small grin forms over his face. “If the circumstances were different…”
Tony immediately senses the hurt and decides to change the subject. He doesn’t want to ask about Steve’s death when they were supposed to be celebrating his birth.
“Maybe not,” Tony says. Their eyes meet and for a moment a single thought crosses their mind: would they talk now?
It's tempting to do just that, but avoiding the other wasn’t going to fix anything. Communication wasn’t always their strong suit. They were getting better, but they still had their moments.
Tony keeps himself pressed up against the omega, chasing after his release. He forces his knot inside, grunting as he comes undone, spilling his hot seed into the omega’s fertile womb. His alpha side is pleased.
Steve sighs heavily and leans back on his heels. “Second thought...maybe you don’t need to walk. I’ll carry you.”
“Yeah.” Steve’s tone is still off and his eyes grow misty again. He turns away when Morgan stirs in his arms, and it’s not long until she’s growing fussy.
They’re left panting and curled up in each other’s arms by the end. Steve lets a contented sigh and buries his face in the crook of Tony’s neck, inhaling the comforting scent only Tony can bring.
Steve shushes him quietly and comes over to investigate. Peter has broken free from the blanket he had been swaddled in and his mitten covered hands are flailing. Steve scoops him up and holds him close.
“I was just about to say the same thing. I thought I was living the life. I had everything I could ever want. And then you literally crash into my life and I don’t regret any of it. I love you and our pups. So much. This is the life I want.”
Between the process of signing over his company and taking care of any business that needs his attention, there is barely any time for Tony to work on the preparations for the nursery. The last thing Tony wanted was to plan another trip out to New York to build the room, so with whatever time he does have, it goes to Peter’s room.
Peter grows silent again and uses his dad’s wounds as a distraction. Tony hisses when Peter begins cleaning the cut on his cheek.
Tony shakes his head and makes an attempt to get off the floor, only to sink back down and hands flying out to grip the sides of the toilet. He vomits again.
His uncle keeps moving and Peter waits until he’s out of sight before dropping back down. He grunts when he hits the floor and quickly wipes the dust from his jeans, then he keeps moving.
Peter peers at Tony for a second before dropping his gaze down to his lap. “Sorry,” he sniffs and turns his direction out the window.
Steve smiles and leans closer to press a chaste kiss to Tony’s lips. James gags and hides his face away.
“And the spider!” Peter points at the black spider on the chest of the suit. “That’s how he drew it!”
“I guess,” Tony huffs and he comes over to investigate the piece of furniture. “Didn’t we just order a crib at the other store? Why does he need two beds?”
“Couldn’t sleep,” Peter replies and he sits down beside his uncle. His eyes land on the dog tags in his uncle’s hand. Peter had given them to him after his father died. His uncle deserved it more than anyone else. “I miss him.”
“Hop in, kid.” Is the only greeting Peter gets. Peter glances around nervously, making sure no one has noticed him yet. “Come on,” his dad urges impatiently.
“I know what you’re doing,” Steve says, his voice taking on a dark tone. His eyes narrow in the beta’s direction. “I’m not a whack job. I’m not someone looking for money or whatever it is you think I’m here for. I wasn’t even looking for you,” those last words are directed at Tony. “I’m just trying to get by in a world I don’t even recognize. I’m just trying to take care of my pup, and I don’t need anyone’s help to do that.”
“I know,” Steve says and he gets up from the chair to stretch. He wanders around the small room, taking note of the posters on the walls.
“Hey I only knew him as the stubborn captain. I really wish I had the chance to learn more. Sorry. I’m ruining the mood, huh?”
With Bruce chatting with Clint and Bucky, Tony steps away and makes his way back to the kitchen. Peter had offered him a drink earlier and Tony had declined, too nervous to put anything in his stomach. He decides to get something now just to keep himself distracted.
Tony sighs. “There’s more. I swear I’ll tell you everything. Just don’t tell anyone where I’m at. If they ask, I’m on business okay? No one can know. Not Pierce-”
Tony decides to take the two boxes in hand up to Steve’s apartment, making a mental note to bring up the rest once Steve is well rested. They ride the elevator up in silence and it’s not until they’re standing outside of Steve’s front door does he say something to Tony.
Peter deserved to know what SHIELD had planned for his father. He had been the one suffering the most from the loss. But Nick didn’t want to give the boy false hope, and instead he kept a tight lip and watched as the boy eventually came to terms with the loss and grew from the grief.
It’s difficult now to get him to latch on when Peter is so frustrated. His son’s attitude isn’t helping his own; in fact it’s overwhelming and Steve is wishing Tony was with him right now.
Steve’s jaw clenches. He’s getting angry, but the pink hue that appears over his face isn’t from the anger. Tony’s only seen Steve blush like this before, back when he had too much to drink and Steve had some of Thor’s mead. Tony never expected after that to have the famous Captain America in his bed.
Bucky places a hand over his belly, his daughter pressing back gently against his palm. “Good. She’s wide awake now.”
Tony thought for sure when this day came that he would be more put together. The past nine months should have been enough time for him to prepare for his son’s arrival, but now as he waits in the medbay for his son to make his grand entrance, it felt as if all of his preparations had gone out the window.
Peter quietly leads his dad away from the party and toward the elevators. He’s glad no one has bothered to rush after him and make him stay. He didn’t want to be at the party anymore. It was ruined.
Steve is left panting from the fight, but he doesn’t have time to recollect himself, and he rushes through the corridor as fast as he can. The wound in his shoulder stings and his vision blurs with tears from the smoke, but it’s not enough to slow him down.
“You okay?” Tony pauses, waiting for Steve to adjust. Steve nods his head and Tony presses more of himself inside until he’s buried deep. They both moan.
Steve smiles again, this time a little brighter than before. He rests his forehead against Tony’s, his eyes filling with tears again, albeit for a different reason.
Steve chuckles and rises to his feet, then he’s extending a hand to pull Tony to his. Tony gasps suddenly and sits back down in the chair.
“Steve, what’s wrong?” Tony asks, immediately regretting asking the question when Steve’s expression hardens. The way his jaw clenches is just one of the signs indicating that he was getting agitated.
He had his suspicions, back when unusual symptoms began to make themselves known. He had pushed the reason behind his sudden illness aside, not wanting to believe that the night he shared with Tony all those weeks ago could result in this. It wasn’t until he confided in Natasha did she suggest he take the test.
“Exactly! He’s a kid. I didn’t want this for him. I wanted him to be better than me. Now he has to sacrifice everything like I-”
“This is the one.” Tony beams happily, tapping against the glass display case that holds the ring he’s been eying for weeks. The clerk behind the desk smiles brightly and reaches for the keys to unlock the case. “Look.” Tony shakes Happy’s arm and points excitedly at the ring. “It’s perfect, right?”
“It’s okay,” Tony is quick to assure. He rushes to his mate’s side, slipping one arm from around the sleeping pup to pull Steve close to his side. Steve buries his face in Tony’s stomach, sobbing softly. “It’s okay. If you are...it’s okay. We’ll handle it together. I promise.”
“Everything’s good,” Tony assures. He doesn't miss the relief expressions that cross over both Happy and Steve’s face.
“Steve,” Tony says softly, crossing the room to be beside him again. He doesn’t bother with the chair anymore, needing to be closer to Steve, and he sits near him on the bed. “Hey, it’s okay.”
“We come in all shapes and sizes,” Clint says and he eyes Steve up and down. “Damn. You sure you’re not an alpha?”
Steve seems cheerful the morning Tony and Morgan stop by. His face lights up the moment he sees his daughter. Morgan doesn’t even fuss when she’s in his arms.
“Thanks.” Steve hastily grabs his shoes and rushes out of the room, slipping them on awkwardly as he moves.
“Y-yeah. Sorry. I don’t know what’s come over me. I guess the movie…” Steve gestures to the screen. “It’s so sad.”
How could Steve love him after what he had done? They were known to get into a few verbal arguments, but never have they put their hands on the other. Tony vows to never hurt Steve like that again.
“I’m sure he didn’t mean it,” Steve tells her, hoping she’d understand that her little brother didn’t know how to properly play with her big girl toys. But she only cries harder.
I’m so sorry that I haven’t updated in a while! I’m so distracted with other things and I’ve lost my motivation and inspiration to write. I finally had some time and a bit of inspiration, so this chapter was able to get done. I hope you all enjoy it!
True to his word, Tony picks Peter up from school. This time around he’s not as nervous around the teenager, and they actually have a pretty normal conversation about Peter’s classes.
“Steve?” Happy’s voice tears through his thoughts. Steve peers up at him with glistening eyes. “Just hold on.”
“It’s fine.” Tony shifts and slips free from the arm Steve has around him. He lies down on his side, his back facing Steve.
It proves two is better than one when it comes to building the crib. Steve had faith from the beginning that Tony could complete it on his own, but he doesn’t regret offering to help. They were both tired and not in their right minds.
“Sure you can. There’s plenty of supplements on the market. We can work on getting your body back to-”
“No, I know. I just…” Steve sighs and pulls back the blankets on the bed and crawls in, wincing slightly from the tenderness in his lower half.
“He can stay with us…” Sam trails off and he sighs again. “Dammit, I don’t know. I guess we need to ask him who he wants to live with too.”
Steve takes a deep breath and pushes as hard as he can. He moves his hand away quickly, and cries out when the head inches forward. The doctor replaces his hand with her own, and with another strong push, the head is out and cradled in her hands.
Peter was fine and in Natasha’s care. There was no reason for Steve to be so nervous. He could trust Natasha with his life, so there should be no reason not to trust her with his son’s. Peter was going to be fine. It was just for a few hours.
Tony’s given up on sleep. The pressure in his belly was one of the most uncomfortable feelings. It prevented him from getting any rest. He can’t lie down anymore and Steve helps him into a sitting position. He leans forward, his hands resting on Steve’s shoulders for support and his head bowed to his chest. He breathes deeply through the intense pressure.
Tony has never seen Peter so nervous. He knew the kid could be a ball of nervous energy on occasion. Honestly, Peter was just a ball of energy in general. But Tony has never seen him like this. It makes him a bit nervous.
“Yeah. Bucky and I would always go to this one place when we were younger. God, I bet it doesn’t even exist anymore.”
Tony squeezes his eyes shut when more tears threaten to fall. His heart aches for his son. “I’m sorry. I never should’ve let you do that. It was a mistake.”
“You did good,” Tony says and interlocks their hands as they follow Agent Coulson back to their private room. Steve smiles and turns to hide the growing blush on his face. “I mean it. Talking about this stuff isn’t going to be easy.”
Oh! I was also thinking of doing a prequel of sorts. Nothing too long but maybe showing what happened to Steve during his time with Hydra and Pierce. It's just an idea.
“What about the omega?” Rollins asks. This captures Tony’s attention and he glances at Pierce, his stomach coiling at the smirk the alpha wears.
There was still a chance for them to start over, but Peter was hesitant to try. He was afraid that his dad would only let him down again.
It was difficult enough to accept that Steve was gone, and attending his birthday didn’t seem appealing. It would be depressing because Steve wouldn’t be there to celebrate his special day.
The nails retract, leaving the skin bruised and broken. Steve whimpers when his hair is tugged again and he’s forced to stare into those evil eyes.
And I changed Clint from a beta to omega. I’ll explain that too 😛 Thank you so much for reading and I’ll update soon!
Rhodey doesn't even flinch. He’s been around Tony like this more times than he can count. It makes Tony feel guilty for putting his friend though this crap again.
“It’s not work,” Steve corrects and takes Sarah’s hand. They all make their way toward the house. “It’s my duty to help them.”
Peter sniffs and quickly wipes away the tears that roll down his face. “I just wish you were here. I keep thinking about you and dad and...us being a family. Maybe he would be different. I don’t think he likes me very much.”
“Wait.” Tony said, unmoving from his position by the elevator. “We should talk. Don’t worry, I’ll start since we know one of us struggles with honesty.” His voice was scathing, cutting Steve right to his core. He was so stupid.
“Are you trying to get me to take care of myself or are you trying to set me up with a guy who hates me?”
Tony slammed down, gasping as Steve entered him fully. “Fuck” He gasped into Steve’s mouth, fingers scrabbling at his shoulders.
As soon as he began to unfold the page, his hands began quivering. No one was supposed to see this. Ever. It was the scene from the lake house. The completely fictional scene he’d created months ago. The page he’d thrown out before he left. His face burned with embarrassment and a tinge of guilt. He didn’t mean for Tony to find this.
“Oh friend Anthony! While your heart and attitude might be mighty, I must admit that your physical form is not one of a warrior, though not unappealing.” The gigantic blonde wiggled his eyebrows before a pair of familiar arms were wrapped around Tony and pulled him into a large chest. Steve started to kiss his neck while mumbling “mine”. Tony just chuckled while trying to contain a moan and fed Steve the last piece of his waffle. A loud groan was heard from Clint and then a cry of pain when Natasha smacked him.
“It was just fine, love.” he replied “Nothing special. Except those two men who have been coming over a lot lately.” That caused Ana to sit up straight without breaking eye contact.
“You were gone for quite a while, we were starting to get a little worried that something had happened to you.” The blonde said with a small frown on his face.
There were probably more damage to the young genius but she just swallowed and turned to Clint who was closest.
BAM BAM BAM!!!! What do you think will happen next? I'd love to hear your opinions in the comments! <3
Tony looked around him, feeling helpless. He lowered his gun and one of the goons that had been flanking Schmidt stepped forward and reached for the weapon.
I would love to see who you think it is and you can leave your guesses in the comments if you want to.
"Yeah, pretty much." admitted Bruce. "I should probably introduce everyone. For starters, when I'm on the field I am mostly known as the Hulk." That earned a snort from Tony "The woman who tried to shoot you is Natasha, also known as the Black Widow, next to her is Clint, also known as Hawkeye" he said, gesturing to the blond he had been patching up who gave Tony a little wave.
‘All good things have to come to an end though’ Tony thought as he walked his friends to their car with a heavy heart. Pepper walked up to him and cupped his cheeks before pressing a light kiss to his forehead.
“What?” Thor said “Is there something that you are aware of that could contribute to the rescue of our dear friend?”
“Yeah” Tony croaked out “let's get to the hospital.” The last thing he remembered was Steve’s terrified gaze at him.
“A few more days in here will do you good.” Howard spat out “Then, you are gonna clean up, put a smile on your face and represent Stark Industries like you were born to do. I will not let you drag my name through the mud anymore, do you understand that? Ad don't think for a second that your Captain will come for you, because he won't. Who on earth would ever want something as ugly and broken as you? You should feel grateful that I chose to give you a second chance, I might as well could have simply given you to Stone and Rumlow rather than letting them play with you here.” Tony paled at the mere thought of being given to the two rapists. Here he knew that they couldn't do any permanent damage since Howard wanted him to represent Stark Industries, to be the face out. But if they had gotten him without any restraints there were no guaranties of what they would do to him. He shuddered and backed away from Howard as much as his damaged body could manage. Howard simply smirked at him and walked towards the door.
Tony shot straight up on his bed, covered in sweat  and barely contained a scream. His heart was beating fast and his breathing was heavy. He sat like that for a few minutes, not noticing DUM-E’s worried beeping by his side. When his heart and breathing had gone back to normal he swallowed thickly and rubbed his eyes, wiping away tears.
Tony barely contained a laugh at the sight of one of New York's biggest mob bosses looking like a little kid.
Suddenly everyone's expressions turned sour and you could hear the metal in Bucky’s arm creak when he balled his hands into fists.
“But I can tell you all one thing, none of this is anyone's fault but HYDRA’s. If Bruce hadn't taken him in when he did Tony probably wouldn't be alive or he would be back with his father.
They showered together, trying to hurry and Steve helped Tony avoid getting much water on his face since it gave him panic attacks. Most of Tony's nightmares were about the waterboarding and he started shaking if he even thought about it too much.
Suddenly Natasha saw a very familiar form laying still on the ground around 15 meters away from them. Without alerting the others she ran forward, the team hot on her heels.
They came to an abrupt halt when they saw Erik and three of his men pointing their guns at two other men who were half kneeling on the floor, blood and cuts covering every one of them. Before anyone could pull their trigger Steve called out.
“Oh Tony” Howard tsk’d “Tony, Tony, Tony, whatever am I going to do with you?” The older Stark slowly stepped forward with every word with his hands clasped behind his back and a cruel smirk on his lips. He bent down so that he was right in front of the injured boy and lightly, almost caringly stroked the boys hair. Tony tried to flinch back but got dizzy in the process so he settled for putting all the heat he could into the glare he sent Howard and hoped that the older man would get blood hon his hand.
Steve turned around and what he saw broke his heart all over again. Tony stood there in one of Steve's to large shirts with his hair tousled and his arms wrapped around himself. His face was turning pale and he was trembling slightly. His eyes were wide open and they were filled with fear and tears were welling up in them.
“Wha- I.” He took a deep breath and started again. “I want more. I want to get to know you. I don't want to be just some fuck buddy. But you probably don't want that, I mean, why would you? Wow, ok, forget I said anything.” Tony flustered in embarrassment and started to walk away when a strong hand took a hold of his wrist.
“And last but not least, Steve, but he is also called The Captain and he is our leader. We are commonly known as The Avengers." Finished Bruce.
Steve startled awake and his hands automatically went around Tony to keep him from falling off the bed. Still bleary eyed he looked down at the grinning face that belonged to his sweetheart and he let out a groan and settled back on the pillows while tightening his arms around the body on top of him.
“Hey, it's not your fault. You didn't know that my dad would be following us like a crazy stalker and attack me in a toilet stall.”
“Like you are one to talk. I was at my morning run. Coffee? Bruce tells me that you can't really function without any.”
“Bucky!” Steve hissed. Bucky smiled apologetically at his childhood friend before returning his gaze back toward the distressed and now confused couple on the couch.
Tony was panicking. His ass felt like it was being torn apart but more so. He couldn't breath. His heart was pounding in his chest and black spots were filling his vision from the lack of oxygen.
“Yeah man, you just disappeared one day and it was just radio silence since that. We were about to report you missing when one of the professors told us that you had dropped out.”
Tony chuckled a bit which sent vibrations through Steve’s cock and he started to slowly bob his head up and down while pumping what he couldn't each with his hand. He suddenly let go of the member which caused Steve to open his eyes and sit up straight against the headboard. Before he could ask if anything was wrong Tony reached to the nightstand and pulled out a bottle of lube from the drawer. He then opened the cap and coated his fingers in a generous amount and rubbed them together for a few seconds to heat up the substance.
He stopped and raised his gun when he saw Schmidt standing in front of the door flanked by two HYDRA goons.
Steve nodded his head and slowly rocked back and forward. After a while, Tony's grunts of pain had turned into moans of pleasure and he wrapped his legs around Steve's waist and his hands around Steve's forearms that were gripping Tony's hips hard. Tony knew that there would be bruises there tomorrow and he moaned at the thought.
Steve was trembling slightly when he knelt down by his lover. He stoked his large hand through Tony's curly mop of hair and turned his head to Coulson and his team.
The older pair just smiled softly, trying to hold back their own tears and failing, and held their boy close to them. Tony could feel Ana press little kisses all over his face while her husband strokes his hair. They stood like that for a while before Tony started to shift in discomfort as his leg started to ache. It didn't go unnoticed and the butler and his wife ushered him back to his wheelchair without letting him go. Ana was fretting and looking him over for injuries all while shooting him with questions about “what's hurting?” And “stupid boy, don't risk harming yourself further!”. Jarvis stood behind him and smiled warmly at his wife and the boy he had come to love like he was his own.
When Howard didn't move from his spot Natasha stepped forward and gripped his shoulder tightly before basically dragging him out of the cafe, screaming how “you aren't getting away with this” and “you will hear from my lawyers”. No one was concerned, the Avengers were very well known off and no lawyer would go against them unless they had a death wish.
Steve looked ashamed standing in front of the woman. How could he have forgotten to tell Tony's surrogate parents that he had been taken by the people who had basically made his life a living hell? Steve bit his lower lip hard and looked down at the floor while trying to come up with an answer.
“Well, it's kind of a long story. I met him over a year ago at a silence convention where he was presenting his robot-” “A robot?!” “Shut up Clint.”
Steve started to think back on the first time that Tony was taken from him. The horror, pain, anger he felt when they couldn't track him down, not knowing what was happening to him or whether or not he was even alive. And when they finally found him and the state he was in just made him feel helpless and like a failure for not being able to protect him and how determined he was to keep him safe for as long as he lived. Once again he had broken his promise and now Tony could be anywhere and having God knows what being done to him.
It had been a few weeks since Tony and Steve had their first date and it had been great so far. He had gotten to know the other Avengers, like that Thor had an adopted brother that used to be a part of them but had betrayed the group and then mysteriously disappeared.
When the couple couldn't reach the team they unlocked the door with a spare key that Steve had provided for them in case anything were to happen. They reluctantly stepped into the empty mansion and dread spread through their bodies while they walked in since they knew that the mansion was never left unsupervised.
After the encounter between Tony and Schmidt they had moved him to an empty room with no windows except for a heavy looking door and a small lamp on the roof.
“He is not safe there anymore, neither one of you. If you wish to protect him you are gonna have to move him here where we can keep an eye on the both of you. The sooner the better.”
Blood covered Tony's face as he fell on the floor, forced down by the full weight of Howard Stark on his back. He quickly pushed off the now still body of his father from him and struggled up to his feet and turned around to get a look at his savior. Not in a million years would he ever have guessed who it was.
Of course, Tony thought, why would anyone wanna hire him just for him? He is worthless and stupid, just like Howard always told him.
“I'm right here big guy, no need to shout. And thanks, but I'm fine, I've had worse.” That caused Steve to tense up and wrap a protective arm around the smaller man, a faint blush visible on his pale cheeks.
Tony moaned into Steve's lips as he kept rolling his hips down, his and Steve's clothed erections grinding against each other.
He turned around in his bed and rubbed his hands on his eyes. Why was he thinking about a guy that he had just met, hadn't even said a word to and was certainly much older than himself and you know, technically a criminal.
“How do you know the Captain!?” Shouted the man, his face a mere inches from Tony's own and he could smell the stench of alcohol coming from the man's mouth. “Answer me you little shit!” Roared the stranger before delivering a punch across Tony's face.
“Yeah, Tones. We were worried that you weren't gonna wake up, but you always did love proving people wrong.”
After what felt like hours but was actually twenty minutes they reached the hospital and Steve immediately grabbed Tony and carried him bridal style into the main entrance, Bruce and Bucky hot on his heels.
“Please never let me go.” Tony whimpered, Steve just pulled him impossibly closer and raised his head with hand. Pressing a soft kiss to the brunettes lips he looked into the whisky brown eyes he loved so much with his own wet ones.
It had been three weeks since his kidnapping and he was slowly starting to lose hope that the team would ever find him. Each night he would dream about the days with the team, the times he and Bruce would spend in the lab, the nights he would be wrapped safely in Steve's arms. This was his only comfort and each time he woke up he would feel his heart break more and more and tears stream down his face. He would also try to figure out ways to escape this hell hole and had gotten some ideas of what he could do.
Jarvis happily slipped of his work jacket and shoes and settles down next to his wife and put an arm around her shoulders while kissing her red locks that she had put in a braid that laid on her shoulder. She leaned into his side and returned a kiss of her own on the corner of his mouth.
“Tony. Who was it? Who attacked you? I swear to God when I find those bastards who hurt there will be hell to pay.”
With the thought in mind he headed towards his and Ana's room where his beautiful wife was peacefully reading on their bed in her pajamas. He couldn't help but smile when he saw her concentrated expression when she pushed her glasses up from where they had slipped down on her nose while keeping her attention on the book, one he recognized as a birthday present from Anthony. He smiled at the thought of his boy and stepped into the bedroom.
“Yeah shrimp!” Exclaimed Clint from the other couch where he was cleaning his bow “Where are you going? You and Cap gonna go on a date or something?”
Tony just shook his head and burrowed closer to the redhead. Rhodey took a deep breath and settled down on the unoccupied side of Tony and wrapped his own arm around him.
He also learned that Tony's own mother had been from Italy and that he spoke Italian and multiple other languages fluently. Tony's mother had taught him both Italian and how to play the piano before the drugs and alcohol had taken over her life.
“Don't you worry about that Steven. That terrible man got what he deserved, you just focus on taking care of that fella of yours. Oh, and by the way, I had Joshua pack up your pancakes so that you can eat them back home.”
The Avengers looked at each other uncomfortably. How could they have forgotten to tell the Jarvises that the boy they loved as a son had been kidnapped by his own father and past abuser and had God knows what done to him?
The shop, S.H.I.E.L.D where Tony worked opened at 8.00 and Tony got there around 7.50 just as his boss was opening up.
He finished the sentence and quickly wiped away the few tears that had managed to escape his eyes. Immediately he felt large arms wrap around him and looked up to see Steve stare down at him with sadness and adoration in his eyes.
The explosion went off and sent Tony flying forward before landing on the cold, hard ground. Before Tony's world went dark he used the last of his strength to turn around to see the HYDRA facility in flames. He let out a watery laugh and felt tears well up in his eyes. The adrenaline that had kept him going slowly melted away and he laid his head down on the ground and closed his eyes.
Everyone was blinking at the still smiling woman except Jarvis who was just staring at his wife fondly.
The team was openly laughing now and Clint scowled before grabbing another egg and throwing it at Thor's direction. The blonde giant only ducked and it hit Bucky instead. Soon the whole room erupted in chaos and there was food flying everywhere.
“Tony, listen to me. I promise that I wouldn't do this if I had any other choice, but I promised to protect you and that's what I'm doing. You are not safe there anymore! And you don't have to worry about your job, we spoke to Fury. And we brought everything you needed here. Your tools, your laptop, your inventions and even DUM-E. Everything is in your room I swear.”
“I don't know, he just said that he wanted to apologize over a coffee and I agreed to meet him.” Steve's eyes hardened when he answered.
He had to stop for a second if he didn't want it to be over to soon. He knew that none of them would last long but he wanted to drag it out as long as possible.
“I know, Tony. I wish it could’ve been me too. But it’s not me for you and it’s not you for me. And that’s okay; we’ll be okay.”
The next day, he moved into the new apartment. His new home. There was a bedroom and bathroom, both big enough for Steve. The kitchen was small, far smaller than what he was used to at the tower. It was nothing like the place he used to sit and watch Tony stumble around and make coffee. It was lonely. But Steve new it was better this way, at least he wasn’t hurting Tony anymore.
“He doesn’t hate you!” Pepper defended, sounding a bit unsure. Tony knew Steve hated him. Sure, they hung out when the team was around, but when they were alone Steve would clear out instantly. Not that it bothered Tony, okay, maybe a little, but he just didn’t get it. Every time Steve came around, he felt drawn to him. Clearly Rogers did not feel the same, he just didn’t understand why.
“How could they? You’re brilliant, and handsome, and incredibly funny.” Pepper smiled, resting a soft hand on his cheek.
When Steve returned to his room, he dug through his top drawer for the pamphlet Tony had left for him so many weeks ago. The apartment looked nice, actually. Steve knew that leaving was for the best. All he ever did was break Tony down.
That was it, then. Steve had to leave. He couldn’t drag Tony out from behind the walls. He couldn’t do this anymore. It was so painful. But the worst pain, by far, was turning around and leaving the lab, for good.
Tony’s legs shook wildly as he approached the man in his doorway. Before this, he had been so so angry with Steve. He’d wanted nothing to do with the big, broken man. But he was beginning to think that Steve might not actually hate him and that he might actually be sorry.
Tony pulled Steve into a hug, wrapping his arms around him and burying himself in Steve’s broad chest. “Then I’m all yours, Rogers.”
Steve nodded sharply, failing to hide the disappointment from his face. Tony seemed to soften for a moment, taking a tiny step forward, but Steve knew it wasn’t substantial enough to change anything. It was too late. He’d really fucked this up and there was no coming back.
Tony just nodded and tugged his clothes back on, not waiting to see if Steve was leaving. Not to worry, Steve thought, he knew when he wasn’t wanted somewhere.
“Woah, buddy. No ‘how are ya?’ or ‘long time no talk’ maybe? I was expecting more.” Tony replied, continuing to work on his suit.
When Steve first saw Tony Stark, he didn’t know how to react. The inventor was cocky and brazen, sweeping into the room like he owned it and infuriating Steve in the process. On the other hand, he couldn’t help but feel a swell in his chest at the sight of Tony, something he hadn’t felt since Peggy, but stronger. He pushed it away quickly. Captain America could not like men like that.
“This doesn’t change anything.” Tony gasped into Steve’s mouth as Steve picked him up and moved them to the couch.
Steve awoke to pounding on the door of his tiny apartment. He’d left the tower a few days ago, unable to watch as Tony wasted away. It was all his fault and he couldn’t fix it no matter how hard he tried. He lied, and he lost Tony because of it.
He ripped the page out of the book. It would never happen. He’d given up any chance of that long ago. He’d ruined everything. He wiped a tear from his eye as the page fluttered to the bottom of the trash can in his empty room.
Steve packed his things as quickly as he could, throwing all of his clothing into a few boxes and shoving his notebooks and sketchpads into a backpack he’d taken from Bruce’s vacant room. As he packed his things away, he flipped through on of his sketchpads, his favorite one from before.
“I didn’t ask you to do that either. But think you owe it to each other to try to talk. If not for him, do it for the team. We’re nothing without you two.”
Steve looked down at the sleeping teen in his arms and felt affection and protectiveness swell in his chest at the sight. Tony just looked so small and vulnerable laying on Steve's massive chest.
“Not really. I mean, some say it weakens the initial bond. But over time, the bond will grow to its normal strength.”
When they collapsed on the couch, sticky with sweat, Tony reached for a rag and began wiping himself off. Steve turned to face him, a lazy smile playing on his lips. He was not met with the same look. Tony’s eyes were lifeless when he looked at Steve.
“Yeah I know.” Tony mumbled. Once again hating himself for sounding so weak. “You can send him on his way, though. We don’t have anything to discuss.”
After that, Pepper found her match, and she continued to work by Tony’s side, never to become anything more. His weapons business was thriving, and he was quickly skyrocketing to stardom. With his fame came a new wave of hope for finding his soulmate. He often allowed magazines to publish pictures of the mark that took up most of his chest, hoping some stranger would catch a glimpse and realize he was waiting for them. He needed them. And yet, no one ever came forward as his perfect match.
Steve flipped them, pressing Tony into the wall beside to door to the lab. His body covered Tony’s perfectly, shielding him from everything else. Steve wished he could do this forever, maybe he could. He considered asking, but Tony began kissing down his neck, tugging at his shirt. They broke apart for a moment to strip off their shirts before falling into each other again.
Tony nodded eagerly. “Yes. Yeah. It’s good. Just haven’t been touched there since--” He trailed off, kissing Steve again. Steve wanted to break away and look at Tony’s chest, examine what little of the mark was still there. But that would give it all away. Tony would know that something was up and the moment would be ruined. Steve settled for tracing the raised skin with his fingertips, feeling for the circular outline of the red mark that he shared with Tony.
“I have never wanted anything as much as I want you, Tony Stark. I want your crazy and your obsessive and your egotistical and your sleep deprived and whatever else you’ll give me. I just want you. And I'm so sorry for not telling you that you’re the only one for me.” Steve said, giving Tony a little smile.
Again, nothing. Steve could feel panic rising in his chest. He was sorry. He was so sorry. And Tony refused to see it! They wouldn’t be able to fix anything if they never spoke again. He just wanted to fix everything.
“It’s his soul mark. Huge, isn’t it? He used to show it off all the time. But after being held hostage he started covering it. We think it might’ve been totally destroyed by the reactor. It’s sad, really. Poor thing never found his soulmate and now he doesn’t have the mark to match them.” The agent said, looking solemn at the end of the statement.
Steve lost his train of thought as Tony came over and stole a grape out of the bowl of fruit on his lap. “Get your own, Stark.” He laughed.
She sighed, pity flashing in her eyes. “He’s gone. Left a few nights ago, Tony. He said you thought it would be better this way.”
“What? What do you want me to say? That I'm going to forgive him for lying for months about what we were? That we can just go back to normal like our chests aren’t literally fucked up for each other?” He yelled.
“Is it something you still want?” Tony asked, curiosity shining in his eyes. Steve was shocked at the lack of anger, but he knew it had to be coming.
After a while, it became habit for Steve to seek Tony out in the field, covering his back any chance he got. Sometimes, he considered approaching Tony off the battlefield. It couldn’t hurt to get to know him a little better. For team purposes, of course. Steve was still hoping the soulmate part of things could be avoided. There was no way they would work as a pair. Stark was brazen and cocky and infuriating. And Steve was, in his own opinion, a gentleman. And to make matters worse, Tony didn’t seem to like him at all.
“You can’t.” The other man said solemnly. Tony heard Pepper gasp softly. Had his heart not been burning, it would’ve broken for his best friend.
“Yes.” Steve whispered, unable to look at the other man. He felt so stupid. He knew he deserved this, the confrontation and subsequent rejection, it was just so hard. He could tell his eyes were watering, again, he was so stupid.
“I want to know, Steve. I’m not asking for anything else, I’m just asking if you’ll let me forgive you so we can move on.” Tony replied softly. He could see the effect the past weeks had on Steve now that he was up close. It looked like he hadn’t slept in days and his eyes were red and swollen, as if he’d been crying. The sight broke Tony’s already shattered heart.
Steve felt wrecked. He’d only been hiding this stupid mark because he didn’t even know what it meant for him. He’d never even considered the possibility of being with a man, let alone the son of one of his friends! The whole time he’d been thinking about what hiding it would do for him, rather than what it would do to Tony.
Steve opened his mouth to argue again but was silenced as Tony raised a hand in his direction. The least he could do was let Tony speak.
“I don’t care. Steve.” This time, it was Tony who began to walk away. Retreating to the elevators, back to his lab, no doubt.
When she pulled back, she held his face in her hands, staring into his eyes for a moment before speaking. “You, Tony Stark, are beyond good enough. If you don’t want Steve to come back that’s fine. I’ll tell him to stay away. If you want to try, even for an hour, I can tell him to get here. I know what it’s like for your soulmate to break you. But every day, every single day, I wake up wishing we could try again. I won’t let you face the same fate.”
“I can’t! You know I can’t!” Steve exclaimed, tossing the pillow back onto the small bed. His hands were shaking as he began pacing again. It would happen any minute now, he was sure of it. Bucky had gotten his mark the year before, a delicate star symbol on his left shoulder. Steve had burned with jealousy as Bucky wailed in pain when the mark was etching itself onto his skin. Honestly, the jealousy had been present every day since. He wasn’t jealous of the thought of someone else loving Bucky and joining their two-man team, he was fine with that. It was bound to happen, Bucky was amazing, after all. He was just jealous that Bucky had someone. A perfect match. His mother had never gotten a mark, instead choosing to marry an unmarked man rather than remain alone like many of others did. Steve Rogers was beyond terrified that, like them, his skin wouldn’t bear a mark either.
“Please listen to me Tony.” He begged. Tony shook him off and walked away, leaving Steve on the couch alone, like always.
“Is this a joke? Because if it is I don’t think it’s funny.” Steve said, voice breaking. “I know what I did was far worse, but please don’t play with me right now, Tony.”
Steve’s heart broke just a little more. Why wasn’t he understanding? Why couldn’t Tony see what he was feeling? It should be obvious.
“Oh God,” Tony groaned. “Not Mr. Self Righteous. I’ll never get anything done if he’s looking over my shoulder all day Pep!”
After weeks of tears and pain and sadness, Tony finally felt whole. He’d finally gotten his soulmate, the one he’d been waiting for his entire life. Sure, he was nervous that Steve might change his mind, but in that moment, nothing mattered more than being wrapped up in his soulmate.
He tugged Tony even closer, trying to avoid his wild thoughts and focus on the beautiful man in front of him. Tony gasped into his mouth as his hands slipped lower, finding the hem of Tony’s t-shirt and slipping under, hands meeting warm, smooth skin. Tony’s rough hands scrabbled at the front of Steve’s shirt, trying to tug it off.
She flipped the blades over in her hands when he thrust them at her, busying himself with a pile of various nuts and bolts.
“And here I thought you looked like this without trying. I guess I was expecting too much.” Steve joked, feigning disappointment.
“And to be quite honest, I don’t want an explanation at all.” He snapped, trying to sound angry instead of completely devastated. “Message received Rogers. Loud and clear. I’m not good enough for America’s hero and that is A-okay, buddy.”
Steve didn’t say anything, just looked at Tony with sad eyes. “Answer me, Steve.” All he wanted was for Steve to say that he would stay. That this was all one big mistake and he would accept forgiveness and he wanted Tony to be his soulmate after all.
Years passed. No soulmate. One day, as he was patching up one of his suits, Jarvis announced an incoming call. Nick Fury.
Later that night, once it appeared Tony had fallen asleep again, she slipped from his room. He wished she would stay, she never stayed with him and he missed her terribly. With a heavy heart, he tossed and turned, trying to clear his mind. After what felt like hours, Tony climbed out of his bed in search of a distraction. On his way to his makeshift “lab”, he noticed light coming from the kitchen. Maybe Jarvis was awake and could be persuaded into making him a cup of tea (or something stronger considering how much pain he’d been forced to endure that night). As he went to poke his head into the kitchen, he caught hushed voices.
Steve nodded aggressively, making Tony smile just a little. He could watch this man for years. For a moment, they just stared at each other, neither man breaking the silence that had settled around them.
He was broken out of his thoughts by a tapping at the door. “Go away!” He shouted, feeling like a child who’d been caught having a tantrum in their room.
“Tony,” Steve tried to interrupt again. Heart sinking as he realized he’d finally slipped off the edge he’d been walking on for months now.
Steve felt his face split into a smile. He was going back. He had a chance to apologize. He had a chance to make things right with Tony—his soulmate.
“I could never hate you. I was hurt, yeah, but I didn’t hate you. I’m practically addicted to you.” Tony laughed softly.
Before Bucky, and Siberia, and the fighting, Steve used to imagine what could happen between them. He’d developed some type of ‘crush’ on Tony and he’d always thought that maybe Tony felt the same. Even after all of this, he’d thought maybe they could work through it and explore whatever had been developing.
Tony sighed loudly, hoping she would hear his exasperation and return to her quarters. No such luck. She remained planted outside the door. “Fine, fine. J, open the door for our guest.”
At the sight of the great Tony Stark curled up in his giant bed, Steve’s heart broke. He truly was the worst man on Earth. They should’ve just left him in the ice.
He called and expressed his interest in the apartment that same evening. Once hearing his name, the woman on the other end informed him that the apartment was his as soon as he wanted it. They agreed on the next day, 8:00 am.
“So, you’re telling me that my best friend is going to be a shell of himself forever?” Pepper asked. Tony didn't want that at all. He wanted to build and go to galas and tease Pepper. He felt a tear slip down his cheek, wishing his body would allow him to participate in his own life.
Steve had assumed this meant Tony had finally gotten his anger out. He’d thought this meant they could be okay. He though wrong, apparently.
“Please” Her voice broke and she moved away from the bed again. “The both of you are wrecked. It’s bad for the team and it’s bad for SI.”
“Something about lying for months and hiding the fact that he’s my soulmate might’ve had something to do with it.”
After the first three weeks, Pepper had called a doctor and a psychologist to the tower to examine Tony. He barely had the heart to answer their questions, remaining curled in his sheets. After the exam, Pepper had led them outside the room, far enough for them to speak freely but close enough for Tony to hear. She knew he hated secrets, and after the last secret that was kept from him, he had begged her to make sure he knew what was going on.
“You’re my teammate. We have to act that way when we are on the battlefield and when we are in the public eye. But beyond that, I do not want to see you or speak to you. I think it would be best this way. That way, the bond will fade out a little more.” Tony continued.
“You know, I get the feeling you know damn well what happened.” Tony snapped, trying to shove his emotions away.
“You were just going to let me live my life thinking I didn’t have anyone!” Tony roared. “I thought the reactor ruined me, Steve! I thought I would never find someone with my mark on them! And this whole time you hid it under your stupid t-shirts and your suit and acted like it wasn’t even there. You never even mentioned it.” His voice cracked.
Tony stopped for a moment. Why would he do that? If Steve couldn’t be bothered to stick around, then fine. So be it. He would be fine without him.
“Listen,” He started, trying to find the right thing to say to calm the other man. “I didn’t know what to say to you. I’d just gotten out of the ice and I didn’t even know that this was a possibility and--”
Fuck. He wasn’t expecting Steve to sound so sure of himself. But there he was, telling Tony that he would do whatever he wanted.
Steve nodded solemnly. “I understand. I really fucked things up.” He reached a hand up and swiped tears off of his cheeks, blushing when he noticed Tony glaring.
“Talk to him.” She said. “He seems really sorry. If it was all a misunderstanding, we have a chance to fix it.”
As the doors slid open, Steve could see Tony. He was wearing sweats and an old t-shirt. He looked absolutely wrecked. Destroyed, even. Steve wanted nothing more than to sink into the floor. He caused the broken look in Tony’s eyes and the tremor in his hands.
After that, it was as if they were in a panic. They moved together quickly and efficiently. Steve flipped Tony over and fucked into him over and over, faster than he thought he could. Tony egged him on the whole way, panting and moaning and begging until the very last second.
“Don’t speak yet, Rogers. I want you to know that I forgive you. I do. I understand why you would try to hide the mark. I’m a tough guy to love. It’s not the first time I’ve gotten that kind of response. And lucky for you, you’re off the hook.”
“Can you kiss me?” Steve asked. He didn’t want to talk anymore; he was afraid he would ruin it. He just wanted Tony to want him.
“Maybe she doesn’t exist. And that’s okay! I can find someone. There’s plenty of people who don’t have a match. Ya know?” Bucky said, turning away from Steve. Steve knew he was trying to hide his disappointment; Bucky was always hiding things to keep him happy.
“Then stay.” Tony said, reaching out to touch Steve’s arm. As soon as he made contact his mark came alive. He felt more alive than he had since their kiss in the lab months earlier. “I can’t say that I’m over everything, Steve. I can’t say that I’ll get over it tomorrow or the day after. But I’m willing to try if you’ll let me.”
“No. We can’t. Go back to bed Captain.” The dismissiveness in Tony’s voice broke Steve’s heart. He’d really lost one of his best friends.
“I can’t--” He paused, fighting back the tears from his voice. “I can’t look at him without remembering that I wasn’t good enough.”
“You’re not ready,” Steve tried to argue, emphasizing his claim by pressing another finger into Tony and giving him a pointed look when he gasped.
If Tony Stark knew anything it was that good things never lasted for him. Over the past months, he had built a tentative friendship with his teammates, inviting them to stay in his tower and interacting with them daily. For the most part, he didn’t mind the company. And Pepper loved that he had people around constantly, convinced it would force him to take care of himself when she was away. He knew it wouldn’t last, and that’s why he chose to lock himself away in his lab. If he avoided human connection, he wouldn’t be disappointed when they decided he wasn’t all that great to be around. Pepper was not impressed, to say the least.
“No.” Tony croaked as his legs finally gave out and he slid to the floor, hot tears rolling down his cheeks. His own soulmate didn’t want him. It was never that he didn’t have a soulmate, he’d had one all along. It was that his soulmate found out who he was and decided they’d rather not be with him. What kind of cruel decision was that?
After Afghanistan, his mark was destroyed, marred by scars and interrupted completely by the arc reactor. At first, it didn’t matter, but as everyone around him found their matches, he was devastated by the loss of his mark that could’ve tied him to someone. What if they didn’t want him anymore because of the damage? Would that effect their bond?
It was July 3, 1932 and Steve Rogers absolutely, under no circumstances, could sleep. The following day was his birthday and within the next few hours he would get his mark. It happened to everyone, but he couldn’t fight the nervous churning in his stomach. What if it hurt? Or worse, what if he didn’t get a mark? The anxiety of the whole process was eating away at the skinny boy.
Tony didn’t respond to that, just returned to sleeping, or whatever he’d been doing before Steve’s arrival. Steve wiped his hands on his pants and looked around. He’d never felt more out of place and yet, he felt lighter somehow, just seeing the inventor was working wonders for his broken heart. The wet-blanket feeling that had settled around him had loosened just the slightest bit as soon as he’d heard Tony’s voice. He brought a hand to his chest as if he would feel a change. He didn’t.
There were no pleasantries. Tony simply looked at him and pulled a crumpled piece of paper from his suit pocket.
Once they were alone, Steve sunk into the chair that was next to Tony’s bedside. He let out a sigh and rested his head in his hands. He didn’t even know where to begin anymore, Tony was done with him and he didn’t know how to change his mind.
“I can’t continue to sleep with you. It’s not right.” Steve said, hoping Tony would understand how much it was killing him to have Tony for brief moments and then get kicked out immediately. It was so hard for him. Too hard.
“Listen, I’ll tell them about the rule if you can’t follow it by yourself.” Pepper said, perching on the couch in the lab as Tony tinkered with one of Natasha’s knives. She was in the middle of explaining, for the thousandth time, her rule about Tony eating at least two meals a day and leaving the lab to sleep at for at least 5 hours.
“You’ll see one day. You’ll be so happy, baby. You’ll see” She said, perching on the edge of his bed and taking her son’s hand gently. There was something sad in her eyes, despite her words of comfort.
According to the information relayed by JARVIS, he was to help a newly thawed Captain America save New York—or maybe the world. It was all just semantics, he supposed.
“We can’t just edit soul marks, Mr. Stark.” He chided. Tony had always had a complex of sorts, wanting to control every aspect of his own life. This mark went against every fiber of his being. He didn’t ask for this. His skin was marred and unrecognizable, raised red lines replacing his once smooth chest. What if he never found his soulmate and he was stuck with this eyesore?
“Next time you think you miss me I want you to change your mind. Don’t come back here again, please.” It should’ve sounded scathing, or demanding, but Tony’s voice was shaky and quiet as he made his request.
Tony chuckled. Of course she did. “She’s always worried about me. Doesn’t really love the ‘mad scientist’ thing I’ve got going on.”
“I shouldn’t cry. This is on me. I just. I wish there was something I could do to show you that I’m so sor-”
Steve wished it was an isolated incident. It wasn’t. At least twice a week, he would find himself wandering down to the lab. They’d fight, throw scathing words across the room at each other. Then, Tony would grab his face and pull him into a kiss. Then he would rip Tony’s shirt, and Tony would pop the button on his jeans. It was all angry and harsh and mean until Steve was inside Tony. It was only then that they could slow down. Steve would drape himself over Tony’s back, or Tony would entangle their fingers and take control, sometimes they would pause for a moment, completely entangled in each other. It was only then that Steve could kiss Tony lazily, taking him apart slowly. The problem was, as soon as they finished, it was back to cold stares and harsh words. The emotional whiplash was taking a toll on Steve.
The worst time was when night fell. Loneliness would settle into his bones, forcing him awake at the worst hours. It was then that Tony would invade every thought he had. He couldn’t shake the feeling of loss that had plagued him since he’d left with Bucky the first time.
“You can stay. If you want, I mean. There’s plenty of space and Pep hates when I’m alone for too long.” He rambled, waving his arms about the room awkwardly and shoving his thoughts away.
Somehow, things had spiraled out of control and he never got the chance to talk to the other man. Before he knew it, Steve was fighting side by side with Tony Stark. Of course, during battle Stark was clad in his iron suit, but Steve couldn’t help but want to remain at his side—just in case. He didn’t like Tony, not by a long shot, and the inventor clearly didn’t appreciate his company either. Yet, they ended up together on the battlefield constantly.
Tony put his tools down abruptly and looked up at him, annoyance flashing in his dark eyes. Before he could speak, Steve held up a hand and began yelling.
Natasha didn’t speak, she just pulled him into a hug, something neither of them did. And despite everything, it was nice.
“Of course.” Tony smiled, pulling him closer and kissing him slowly. It wasn’t like their other kisses, dirty and angry, it was soft and slow. It was exactly what Steve needed to slot the pieces of his heart back together.
“I’m not asking for anything anymore.” Steve said. His presence was hurting both of them more than he’d realized. He was trying to take from an empty man and Tony was trying to get rid of his own hurt. They were tearing each other apart and Steve knew that it would go on forever if he didn’t step up and end it.
Before he could protest, as if he actually would, Tony had leaned up slightly and closed the gap between their lips. When their lips met, Steve felt a sort of ‘click’ in his heart, maybe even his soul, and it was as if all of the emotions he had been avoiding came crashing down at once. Was this what soulmates felt like? Was this the bond that was missing at first?
“And what, Steve?” Tony seethed, moving closer. “And not save Bucky? No. And not lie to me? No, that couldn’t be it either. And not abandon me? Oh, wrong again. There is nothing that you would really change. Don’t pull that shit with me.”
No. No, Steve didn’t even like men like that. How could his soulmate be a man? An obnoxious one at that? Not possible. Sure, he’d always loved drawing men. And yeah, maybe he’d once or twice wished Bucky was in love with him. And so what if he didn’t really like dames the way the other soldiers had? It didn’t mean his soulmate had to be a man. Tony Stark, at that. What would people think of him?
“Yeah, well, for starters you could stay the hell away from me. I’m not your friend. I’m not your pal. I’m not even your acquaintance. And honestly, Rogers, I wish I wasn’t your god damn soulmate. Get out.”
“Wait,” Tony said, climbing out of his bed and walking towards Steve. When Steve caught sight of Tony, his heart sank. He had obviously lost weight, and his face was pale and gaunt. “What if I told you that I forgive you.”
He opened the door slowly, peering out at the person on the other side. His heart stopped. He wasn’t expecting Tony, in all his manic glory, to be waiting for entrance to the apartment. He stepped out of the way without a word, allowing Tony into his home. The one place he thought he would be alone.
“Started watching the Star Wars movies again. Can’t believe I missed out on those for so many years.” Steve chuckled, trying to break the ice that had settled into every crack in their friendship. It was so hard to sit and watch Tony forget about him and what they had. It was so hard to know he’d given up his friend.
Steve woke slowly, blinking the sleep out of his eyes and reaching blindly for his phone. It was only 3 am, two hours too early to wake Bucky for a jog. He knew sleep wouldn’t find him again, so he began to run through a mental list of anyone in the tower who might want to chat at this hour. Only one person came to mind, and they definitely weren’t speaking. They’d started this little game of ignoring weeks ago, falling victim to the tension that had been building for months.
He wished Pepper was his match. Sure, he didn’t get tingly or anything when she was near, but she was beyond perfect. She kept him on track and made sure he was okay without smothering him. He wanted her to be his soulmate so badly, maybe then the mark would be worth it.
“Fine.” Steve growled into Tony’s mouth, pulling him close again. Maybe this was for the best. Maybe they’d never get their house and their beautiful life, or even their friendship, but they could have this.
Steve was stunned. He didn’t realize how angry Tony was about the entire situation. He had figured that time would heal things. He had figured Tony would’ve said something if he was still this angry. Tony pressed closer, getting into Steve’s face.
“Would you stop acting like I’m here to hurt you, Rogers?” Tony snapped before softening again. “Just answer my question, is this something you still want?”
“Oh, my dear, congratulations.” A soft voice said, announcing the presence of Tony’s mother. He looked up at her in awe, she never visited his room. She was often locked away in her wing of the house, sedated with different concoctions from the cacophony of doctors that swept in and out of her quarters.
When he met Peggy, he felt so giddy. Sure, everyone he’d ever known had said that their lines had burned in the presence of their match, but the doctors had warned him of weakened sensation due to the altered form. Maybe this was enough, light butterflies in his stomach. He was fairly certain that she was his match. Later, he became more certain when he caught a glimpse of a raised line peeking from the collar of her blouse. He’d never seen someone with a mark over their heart like his before. He asked her if she wanted to go out the following night, of course he did. She was his soulmate for crying out loud!
“He used to do advertisements, before he had to man the company.” The agent chipped in, noticing his gaze. “He was cute, right?” She asked.
Tony’s mind was racing a mile a minute as he took in the sight before him. Sure, the lines weren’t raised, and the color was a bit faded, but there on Steve’s chest was his mark. He’d never expected to see it on anyone and then there it was on his teammate’s—his friend’s-- chest. Steve had to have known about it. He’d seen the old ads, he’d even teased Tony about a few. And still, he’d never thought to mention that they were supposed to be fucking soulmates.
By the time the sun rose, Steve Rogers was the proud owner of a soul mark. He had never seen a mark this large before. It spread across the small expanse of his chest, slightly offset, with the center covering his heart.
The pounding didn’t quit. It rang through his apartment as he tried to ignore it. It was probably Sam again, he’d been coming to check in every day now, forcing Steve to eat and shower and leave his room at least once a day.
“This is too big!” He wailed, looking to Jarvis for help. “There must be a way to shrink it down a little.”
“Every time you come back, I’ll let you. I can’t, though. You always leave and then I sit here and wonder why you can’t get yourself to stay. And then I end up wondering why I couldn’t get you to stay.”
“Did you know?” He asked sharply, searching Steve’s eyes intently. Steve didn’t know what to say. What could he say? Before he had the chance to speak, Tony jumped in again. “Holy shit. You knew! You knew this whole fucking time! And you never said anything at all.”
Years later, when he awoke from the “procedure” that made him Captain America, the first thing he reached for was his mark. After years of having the raised lines across his chest, they had become a sort of comfort to him. No matter what was raging on outside, he knew there was someone out there with the same marks waiting to meet him. Panic arose in his throat as he felt for the raised lines. The doctors must have noticed his fear because a voice to his left explained that it was still there, but the lines weren’t raised. He wouldn’t have any scars anymore, including his mark. The only thing left that tied him to his other half were faint red lines.
Between the feeling of Tony’s hands all over him and the kisses and his oddly romantic thoughts, Steve could hardly focus. He slowly slicked his fingers and pressed one into Tony, swallowing his gasp that came at the feeling. Ever so slowly, he worked the smaller man open, loving the whines and moans he was receiving in return.
After Steve had sulked back to the tower with Bucky in tow, his apologies fell on deaf ears. Tony wouldn’t even look at him for longer than a few seconds. And conversation? Out of the question. But sometimes, after missions, Steve would catch Tony’s eyes and blush at the heat behind his stare. He couldn’t pinpoint when, but Tony had started looking at him again. It wasn’t necessarily a nice look, but Steve had missed those eyes all the same. He wanted to fix things with the other man, so he responded with equal stares; it was the only way he knew how to get closer to Tony again.
If anyone were to ask Steve what happened next, he wouldn’t know what to say. He couldn’t tell who moved first, but they were kissing. It wasn’t soft, it wasn’t sweet. It was rough, all teeth and tongue, it was a battle.
Tony didn’t know what to say. He was breaking her heart and he was ruining the team but what else was he to do? Steve made it very clear that he was not interested by hiding his mark for months.
“Wait- I thought this meant we could be... friends, or something.” Steve argued, tugging his boxers on and standing up.
Steve’s heart sank. He used to wish that he was Bucky’s match, that way they wouldn’t ever have to leave each other. But Buck loved dames, probably a lot more than Steve did. He wasn’t gay, no. That was a dangerous claim to make. He was just picky. The only one he liked was Peggy. And that was okay with him.
“And next time you can’t sleep find someone else to harass.” Tony said to Steve’s back as he walked out of the lab.
“It is. But I’m giving you the chance to fix it. I’ll be back in 10.” Pepper said sharply before moving to exit the room. “Pull it together Rogers.” She snapped, reaching past him to open the door.
“I replaced the original materials with some lighter stuff. And the blades were reinforced too. I’m thinking about trying some new designs for you as well.” He gushed. Talking about weapons was so much easier than thinking about Steve. So much easier and so much less painful. Natasha seemed to understand because she didn’t push for answers, just walked around the lab, occasionally asking what things did.
Bucky was at his side before he knew it, easing him down onto the bed. “Take off your shirt. Maybe it’s your mark! Mine didn’t hurt nearly at all, but maybe yours is a little bigger.” Bucky reasoned, helping his friend tug off his shirt so they could get a glimpse of his bony chest.
Steve felt a flicker of hope ignite in his heart. His mark was pulsating under his skin as Tony took another step towards him, one hand on the bed for support.
“In the picture, we were- well, you know.” Tony said with a waive of his hand. “Was that something you wanted?”
Steve felt panicked again. This was never supposed to happen. Steve was never going to have to admit to any of this to Tony. This was never supposed to happen. It was just a silly dream.
Without opening his eyes or breaking out of Steve’s gentle grasp, he voiced the concern that was weighing heavily on his mind. “Are you sure you want me? I know I'm not all that. I’m annoying, and obsessive, and I don’t take care of myself. Maybe you were right to keep this from me.”
Something flicked across her face—understanding, maybe—before she spoke again. “I’d love to see them.” She said softly, approaching the inventor cautiously, as if he might crumble if she moved too quickly. Honestly, Tony felt like he might do just that.
The door opened and Natasha walked in slowly, glancing around at the weapons and other tech strewn across the tables and the floor. “Nice place...” She commented, not looking in Tony’s direction. He knew she was trying to make him feel more comfortable with the intrusion, but it was still weird having someone invade his lab like this.
“Get in me now or get out of my lab, Rogers.” He snapped, moving off Steve’s fingers and stroking Steve languidly. Steve couldn’t argue any longer, positioning himself at Tony’s hole and pressing in slowly. He loved the control. He loved knowing that he had what Tony wanted and he could control how soon he got it. He loved Tony- no, he couldn’t.
Steve didn’t try to argue again. He simply nodded and left the lab, leaving Tony to his thoughts. Once the door had swung shut behind him, Tony spoke once more. “Remove Mr. Roger’s access to my floors, J. I don’t want to see him anywhere.”
When Tony awoke from his nap, he noticed a new voice outside his door. “get your ass in there and fix this. I don’t care who said what and I don’t care why.” Pepper said, taking on a business tone that was reserved for board meetings. Tony wanted to laugh.
By the third month of their little hangout sessions, Steve couldn’t imagine being anywhere else. On days that he didn’t see Tony, he felt like something was missing. Of course, he didn’t love him or anything. He couldn’t. Sure, he may ‘like’ guys, but not Tony. If he confessed everything now, it would ruin everything they had. He couldn’t love his beautiful eyes, and his hands that were marred with tiny scars and burns, and his soft hair, and his arms, and legs, and t-shirts, and--
“Tony, no! Please let me explain.” Steve begged, feeling tears well in his eyes as his soulmate dismissed him. “It was a mistake! I never should have acted the way I did! It was wrong. I was wrong. I’m so disgusted with myself and I want nothing more than to apolog--”
“Tony-” Steve paused, trying to think of a way to word things to prevent a blow-up. “I don’t think- actually, I know I can’t do this anymore.”
“Don’t worry, pal. I get it. Your boyfriend is finally healed up and ready to roll and you don’t know how to tell me.” Tony continued.
“It’s too hard for me to separate what’s real and what isn’t.” Steve said, eyes pleading with Tony to understand the pain he was in. It was too hard to be treated like some doll that was cast away after Tony was through playing.
When Tony looked down, he froze. It was huge. Far larger than any other mark he’d seen before. His school friends had gotten their marks years before, as he had skipped a few grades. They had tiny designs on their arms or legs mostly. He’d never seen something so large before. The red lines bled across his chest, creating a circle with lines crisscrossing throughout it. It was intense, to say the least.
“I didn’t say it was a bad thing, Steve.” His voice was so soft, so comforting, Steve nearly melted. He hadn’t been on the receiving end of such kindness in so long.
“What?” Tony was already annoyed and leaving his newest suit unfinished didn’t help his mood. Why couldn’t they just leave him alone? His soulmate didn’t seem to have a problem doing it.
At first, it seemed like Tony wouldn’t notice at all. Then, his kisses trailed from Steve’s lips to his neck, tearing a moan from the blonde man. Taking the encouragement, Tony’s kisses trailed down further. That was when Steve’s blood ran cold as he realized what Tony would see should he open his eyes. Steve froze, hands ceasing their movements on Tony’s back. Slowly, Tony’s pulled back, opening his brown eyes and staring at Steve.
Sometimes, he would sit and picture a life where they had retired. They would’ve moved somewhere quiet, away from the danger that plagued cities all over. Tony would’ve bought them a house, something big, hopefully near the mountains or a lake, something for Steve to draw while he lounged on the porch. Tony would have a lab, but he would spend more time outside with Steve, exploring and relaxing and being happy, for once. Every once in a while, Steve would picture children, maybe a boy who loved to tinker and invent, like Tony. And maybe a pretty little girl who stuck with Steve. It was all a hopeless dream, he knew, but he wished it wasn’t. It could’ve been real, but he gave it all up.
“What if they hate me?” He asked. Tony had never had much luck with people. His own parents couldn’t stand to be around him for very long. He had two friends who were driven up the wall and back down by his antics constantly. And lastly, he was very, very single. People had a hard time connecting with the genius, for obvious reasons.
“I wouldn’t dare.” Jarvis said sadly. “I’ve already alerted Howard and he claims to be taking care of things—getting rid of any evidence he might find.”
“Oh, you hear that J? Steve here is gonna build his own lab.” Tony laughed tossing a grape at Steve’s chest.
Steve launched forward, hand closing over one of Tony’s arms. He felt so much smaller than before, Steve’s heart broke a little more and the lines on his chest absolutely throbbed. “Tony, please!” He begged.
“He told me a few things—but I’m having a hard time understanding why you kicked him out.” She said.
“The only one who acted irrationally was you. I will not apologize for reacting to your bad fucking ideas.” He seethed, breath grazing Steve’s cheeks.
“What if I told you I wanted this too?” Tony asked, pointing towards the picture in Steve’s trembling hands.
“Listen,” Steve tried, looking like a wild animal caught in a cage. Tony wanted to hear what explanation he could possibly have for doing this, but at the same time he knew better. Sitting around and listening to his soulmate explain how he just wasn’t quite good enough would break him.
“We’re not friends, Rogers. I don’t like you. I like sex. Now get out of my lab, for the love of God.” Tony said, as if he was exasperated with Steve for even assuming they could be anything less than enemies. The home Steve envisioned in his dreams started to burn, beautiful walls adorned with family photos of vacations and Christmases crashed to the ground. THey would never be anything more, he’d really ruined it.
“I really am sorry Tony. I’m the luckiest man on Earth to have you as my soulmate.” Steve said again, thinking it may be best to walk out of the room.
Tony’s little “rest” lasted for weeks. He felt like he was drowning constantly, unable to stay above the rising tides of his own sadness. Pepper visited as often as possible, making sure he was at least semi-functional. Tony didn’t speak most days, but he hoped she knew how truly grateful he was.
Steve’s lips quirked up in a wry smile. Tony felt like his heart was stuttering. “Anyway, here’s this. I’ll be back in a couple hours to make sure you get to bed.” Steve said, turning swiftly to leave the room.
He paused, turning to face Tony. All of the sudden, Tony couldn’t breathe. Jesus Christ, what was going on with him? He’d never acted like this before, not even with Pepper. If he didn’t know any better, he would’ve thought Steve was his soulmate or something. He didn’t have a soulmate though. He couldn’t, not after Afghanistan and the reactor. His mark was basically gone and regardless, Steve Rogers was absolutely straight and absolutely not interested in Tony Stark.
Steve lifted Tony’s face until he opened his eyes to look into Steve’s eyes. They were so blue. A tear rolled down Steve’s cheek, breaking Tony’s heart. They had just started to fixed things and he’d already made Steve cry again.
After what felt like hours, she looked at Tony, face giving off no indication of what she knew or what she wanted to know. “What happened?”
“Just get out Steve.” He said instead, walking away from the other man. “I can’t even look at you right now.”
“I’m having a heart attack!” He wailed, clawing at his chest and collapsing onto his bed. From the doorway, Jarvis smiled. “This is not a joke! I am actively dying!”
“Tony please don’t make me do this.” Steve begged. He could feel the rejection coming before it even left Tony’s mouth. “I know it was overstepping a lot of boundaries. I know you don’t feel the same. Please, please don’t make me say it.”
“I’m not going to kill you Rogers. It’s a workshop not a torture chamber.” Tony said, glancing up at the stoic man.
According to his doctors that examined him after his return, his bond would be weaker than usual at first. The altered state of his chest would affect the immediate reaction, but not the overall connection between him and his soulmate. If he ever found them, that is.
Later, Steve would find himself directing a SHIELD agent to get him all the information they had on Stark. For research purposes of course. As he was assisted in scrolling through articles and pictures and video interviews on a tablet, he noticed an odd photograph. It had to have been years ago, when Stark was far younger. College, maybe? He was tiny, perched on a leather sofa and looking into the camera with huge, puppy-dog eyes.
“Stevie, you gotta stop pacing. I need sleep.” Bucky groaned from his place in Steve’s bed, tossing a pillow in his general direction.
“I always hurt you.” Steve said, trying to show Tony how bad this could be. If they actually tried, and Steve messed it up, he couldn’t live with himself. He couldn’t. Not again.
“What do you want, Steve? A little cuddle sesh? An ‘I love you’? That’s not what this was.” Tony snapped, tossing Steve’s clothes at him.
Tony had apparently sensed his discomfort, breaking the kiss to glare up at the larger man. “Ever heard of hate sex, Capsicle? I don’t want to be your little girlfriend or something, I want to fuck.” He snapped.
Tony heard Pepper shut the door and begin moving about the kitchen. If her sniffles were any indication, she was still crying. He knew she wouldn’t return to check on him until she was composed. He felt awful. And tired. So tired.
“I’d love to see you try to get Steve Rogers to make sure I’m following your rule. The guy won’t get within 15 feet of me if there’s no one around to buffer!”
He stopped at the exit to the room, turning to face his friend once more. “Listen, Pep, I wanted it to be you. I needed it to be you. There’s no one else for me.”
He walked into the lab as Tony was deconstructing an old suit. He glanced up from his work for a second before instructing Steve to wait on the couch for him. Once he finished, he approached the couch, tugging his shirt off before reaching Steve.
