He turned until it stopped. It certainly took a minute, then suddenly all the lamps stopped glowing.
The rock was large and formed an entrance to a cave that admitted humans to fall into it. Steve swallowed as he stopped a few yards in front of it. If Tony was not there, he would not know where to look. The hints were too clear. Panic came over him. What if someone had found him before? Or if Tony was dead?
Tony, too, was cold, though he had been in the armor all the time. "Here," he mumbled and pulled off his jacket, which he immediately put over Pepper's quivering shoulders. His black T-shirt stuck to his body due to the water.
The journalists stood in front of the building and even under the trees to get a glimpse of the City Hall. One even seemed to be serving a drone, but he couldn’t see it.
Rhodes sat next to Clint and raised his hand in greeting, but studied him thoroughly. His brown eyes seemed to scan Tony.
"Not much," Rhodey admitted. "Some of us are on missions. Scott Lang and Wilson are now in Europe, along with some agents. There have been a couple of power cuts in Norway. As here, just before the plane arrived. Natasha and Clint were traveling in the States, but are back now. The information haven’t been sufficient and-"
"Even when I was five, Rogers," Tony replied quickly. The smell of Steve hit him in the nose. "But yes, in Sokovia, too."
There was an empty chair almost at the end of the table. Only when he had sat down someone else moved.
Cumbersome, Steve picked up his shield from the ground and tried to carry it somehow. More and more pressing was the weight of the man on him and with each step, Steve realized that a sip of water would have been important. And yet he went on over the sand.
"Wilson had no cartridges with him," Tony argued more aggressive than necessary. He just wanted to go back up and beat this killer until he could not move. He had not spoken to him since the fight against Steve and him. But he knew he had to stay professional.
"Howard," Maria exclaimed in pain, but the man did not hear it anymore. The biker needed only seconds to kill Howard Stark. He put the lifeless body roughly back in the car and ignored the passenger's weeping. Slowly he rounded the car, fully aware of his task.
"You should have done the ‘being-nice’ before, so shut it," Tony pressed back, trying to escape. He could tell by the weight in his shoulder that the severed hand was still inside of him. Suddenly a loud noise came from behind him. He managed to turn his head enough that he could see the two smaller aliens fall over simultaneously. His brain worked. Did they just kill their own brain because it was ... overstrained?
Tony winced when Natasha's voice reached him. "Oh Jesus fucking Christ – “ he started looking for the redhead. She was standing next to the couch; several files were on the table and a hologram floated over it. Tony was unsure how he could not have seen her.
"That's Steve! We’ve got Steve!" he shouted, cheering. If Clint had not joined in the jubilation, he would probably have wondered that the man can show such emotions.
"I would go up to seventh best," Natasha interjected, facing the two men. The living room was flooded with sunlight and Tony even had to squint for a moment to avoid being dazzled. Natasha leaned back in her chair and put her hand on her stomach. "My stomach would say it’s the best thing." Tony chuckled. "I can’t believe you didn't invite us if the food was so fantastic."
"One moment, please, yes? I need to show you what happens if any of you become inattentive." The image of the mouth disappeared and another, to Tony only too familiar image opened. "I give them something to pay attention to. A friend gave me the video. I recently helped him out of jail."
Another man emerged from the group of followers. In the dark, Tony barely recognized the man, but he would think he came from the Middle East. The general knelt next to Pepper. Her eyes opened in a flickering panic and she looked at the man in front of her.
"Clint, go left!" shouted Steve Rogers to his companion. The huge flying ship was littered with unconscious or dead aliens.
Now the inventor got up tired and stretched. The therapy would only take a few minutes but definitely wouldn’t feel nice. His bones should grow together within the next few days and then be hard-wearing again. The new technique was good, but definitely not pleasant.
Tony could not help rolling his eyes, secretly knowing it was true. And he wanted everything to be as it used to be, before the deal. Memories of how he was drinking with Steve or watching movies came up in him.
"Well, now I should hopefully have your attention now. Yes, crazy, who is working in your own ranks."
"Three," Tony explained quickly. "Three. I get it that you don’t give all of them away at the same time. But at least three would have been appropriate." His voice trembled more than he wanted, and his heart beat unusually hard. It felt like it had slipped several feet down.
for me? Where were you the last time you said that? When we didn’t see each other for three months? Where were you when my villa was blown up? Where were you after the Chitauri? Where have you been when I saw the video of Barnes?" Tony got angry, but Steve did not stop moving towards him. He hesitated for a moment and the mechanic could see that the other felt hurt, but then he slowly moved on towards him.
Somehow they had to bring the ship under their control. If they were able to take control, they could at least avert the danger from the vast city of Philadelphia.
"Quiet," said Agent Dragenbach softly, turning her head to see Tony. He was still standing next to Burkwill, whose knife was dangerously close to his neck. The mechanic barely suppressed his anger and clenched his - probably blue - hands into fists as the General touched Pepper in various places to check her health. He spoke something in Arabic and Burkwill answered something and made waving gestures. Someone from the retinue came up to the general and put something in his hand. Tony did not know what it was at first, but Lang and Dragenbach could see it.
"Why didn’t you ask about Friday? You could’ve saved time doing whatever you're doing," Tony murmured to himself rather than to Steve, but the soldier understood anyway.
"But why did the thing had to die?" asked General Astif, a Syrian war veteran who had been working for Burkwill for several years.
Steve could not move. He thought he heard Rhodey screaming wildly but was not sure. Tony was gone. He was dead. And the last thing he had ever heard of him was the question of whether he minded his death.
"What?" Steve asked, torn from his thoughts. The Avenger had stood next to Steve and apparently watched him. "Sit down," Steve told him, pointing to the white leather chair across from him. "I'm not restless."
Again, Lady Elise answered. Of all the people in the room, she was probably the second smartest. He liked her very much. Her stern eyes met James'.
“Yeah, but the Tony Stark who wouldn’t have done that is still sitting in a cave in Afghanistan. Don’t fool yourself, you know I had to do it."
"Who?" Tony finally asked hoarsely. Burkwill laughed. "You will see that, soon. I expect you in the Boston Public Garden in two hours. Alone."
It had gotten worse. Each breath made him feel that several ribs had been broken or at least bruised, a wound over his eye had become inflamed and throbbed, just like his head, as he could not drink anything.
Natasha was at the cockpit and immediately steered the plane out of the hangar, but the rest of the Avengers looked at Tony expectantly. Vision almost seemed relieved and Wanda kneaded her hands uncertainly in front of her stomach. Barnes was standing behind Steve, who jumped right up when Tony and Clint entered the plane.
"And can you tell us where?" one of the agents asked. Agent Riggs, Tony thought. He could remember the scarred face.
People had to believe he was dead, they wouldn’t have to look for him, it would be a waste of time. They had to deal with an alien threat.
"Because I've been working for you all the time," Vision said loudly, and again Tony became mad. It had become unnaturally quiet, but the mechanic just wanted to jump up and kill the two people on the other side of the bridge. Even though he had to go through a lot of extraterrestrials and a hail of bullets.
A crack in the line made him think he had lost the connection. Frantically, Steve looked around. Another plane, another threat? Even if it was much smaller, it could very well cause great harm.
He shook his head. Slowly he walked ahead and turned right where the therapy room was. It should begin soon.
Then Burkwill answered in a cold voice. "I want Stark to suffer. I want him to suffer as much as I did. I want him to leave loved ones when he comes to me. And then I will use his technology to end the war in the Middle East."
"The last time I woke up like this, Steve, I wanted to eat something," he muttered, feeling the blood loss already. The words were not as fluent as usual. Steve pulled him out of the armor that was assembling and looked at him exhausted. "Nothing has changed."
"But remnants of his equipment would still have to be found, especially in the puddles," the Winter Soldier retorted, his voice calm. Tony shook his head, though he knew the man was right. "Chemical changes in the water due to reactions in the weapon," the killer probably read out.
At first, he had been disoriented and felt the sand around him until he remembered what had happened. Fortunately, he was able to fall asleep again, because the painkillers he had brought down with a sip of a whiskey in the evening tugged at his capacity.
"We are east of Trondheim, the information from the boy brought us here. We were in a valley that has no name. About three hours east of the city. As a small river flows through, which comes exactly from a mountain. The valley was still large, and there was much of a slimy liquid beside the water. The creatures are said to have come from here, at least that's how the boy described it."
"You’ll shoot as soon as I'm gone with it a few hundred yards. All guns on me and the thing. All the monsters will die and you can get to the cockpit. You’ll take control quickly and land it safely. No one in Tom's River, and certainly no one in Philadelphia will die."
Tony inhaled audibly and kneaded his lips, but then he lowered his eyes and looked at the older man. Crystal blue eyes looked at him and white hair on top of it. The bushy eyebrows were already wet and drops of water were collecting in the beard. Nevertheless, the man still grinned. "Now, this is good. Thank you. Oh," he grinned like a child. "I'll have your people brought right away, by my special guest."
"Friday, do we know anything about the people at the New York air force?" he asked, leaning over a little cable that he needed to connect to another one.
He saw pictures popping through his head again. His father came home tired from work, pissed off because there was no news of the whereabouts of Captain America, his great hero. He grumbled at the little boy because his toys were lying on the floor, and besides, he did not practice playing the piano as he had agreed to but read a simple children’s book.
Tony just looked at his buddy but said nothing, but that was enough answer for his longtime friend. "Was he able to stop you?"
Natasha's shoes were not in the entrance, so Tony figured they should continue to wear them and he and Steve put their jackets on a small cupboard that didn’t even close properly anymore. Through the second door on the left, a small woman with glasses in her hand pushed first, and Natasha followed.
With a loud noise everything he shot bounced off the creature and something was even thrown back in all directions. Some of the monsters fell to the ground, but Rhodey's cheer also shifted to a fearful one. He was thrown several feet through the air and fell hard on the ground.
Too much had happened. The fight in Germany, the prison, the break. The fight against the aliens. Tony.
James watched in amazement as an elderly gentleman stared into the air with tears in his eyes while two younger men next to him complained loudly about the incompetence of the
In the middle of the room stood a huge wheel, which probably switched off the power to something important. "Got it," Steve murmured, running to the metal wheel. Here, too, some guards had been posted, but they were also dead on the ground. The diameter of the wheel was approximately six feet, but Steve managed to turn it. The beginning was the hardest. He tensed his muscles and just managed to get the wheel to move. After that it was easier.
It took a while before he could calm down. Before he slowly got his breathing under control again and the tears finally dried up. Angrily, he wiped the wet marks off his face, but he sat and stared wearily at the wall opposite him. He wondered if Jamie Handerson had been sitting here like this before when he had to leave, or if he had volunteered to show the Germans that they could not simply destroy American ships. Whether he was happy, whether he had celebrated. Tony's fingers slipped weakly over the rough ground over which several people had walked over before him. Nevertheless, his fingers faltered over an irregularity in the expired wood. Curious, he bent down to read the incised message. Somebody, just like him, had sat there with a knife, writing a number in the floor that Tony could easily read. A shiver ran down his spine.
Hey! I figured I'd be able to post two times a week. I hope it stays this way, but I certainly think so.
Tony could only make a tired grunt. He was drained, but his brain was still downstairs, by his suit. The scan must have been finished by now and he could keep working, he knew that, but he had no strength.
"I wanted to see how you're doing," he replied, watching Tony stiffen. Of course, he wanted that. Because he was as interested as he was three months ago in Siberia. Tony snorted briefly before letting his head hang down.
There was a brief silence on the other side of the pipe. Then the road noise suddenly disappeared. "I just want you to know we care about you."
Tony dropped his head a little. He did not want to hurt her. "I barely had time, sorry, Pepper," he tried to answer. "I was mentally absent a bit, too, I guess.”
Again, Tony just nodded, trying once more to pull away. His eyes fell on the suitcase, which was his armor, and still stood only a few yards away. He coughed. Water flowed into his mouth and he choked, but the coughing sensation did not stop.
She did not seem to really notice them, but went through the third door, opposite the entrance, gesturing for Natasha to follow her. Steve and Tony followed her as well and entered a small living room. A wooden table stood right next to the door and two chairs stood there. Under a window stood a small couch, which was at the same time probably the bed of the woman, because blankets and pillows lay messily on it. Cabinets lined the walls, and a few pictures, painted and photographed, covered the last vacant spaces in the room.
"Holy ...", Rhodey muttered. Tony nodded. He did not expect that. Burkwill was a psychopath who had not only predicted his own death, and seemed to be okay with it, but also betrayed his own coworkers because they were not smart enough for him. Because they were too dangerous for him. Again, Tony thought of Bucky and immediately recognized what Burkwill meant. Zemo had been one of his co-workers, and Steve's friend was the first victim in search of revenge from his people. Slowly, he put his hand over his mouth. The room was dead quiet and everyone seemed to be thinking.
"There was rumour you weren't allowed to search for him. What happened to that? Did the US lose control about y'all already?" another man asked. He had a strong southern accent and already seemed to be unfriendly. "How are we supposed to
Normally, his body would never react that way, but those cursed injuries made everything else impossible.
"Yeah, I did" Tony admitted and still did not break away from the bigger one. "But I think you convinced me." Tony paused. His thoughts circled again, but he had to pull himself together.
"Natasha thought she saw something behind the ice cream truck. She is encircled, but I'm trying to get there."
Tired, he slumped onto the bed just to the right of the door and closed his eyes, just for a moment. The bed was dusty and uncomfortable, and the pillow barely a hand wide. A cold wind swept through the window, though it was summer. By now it was dark outside and Tony could hear chirping crickets. Of course, he did not carry a suitcase with him, he did not have to unpack anything, but before he went back to the others, he wanted to have a moment for himself.
Tony nodded slightly. "I promised not to seek Burkwill," he said softly. "Now I'm looking for Pepper."
"The SHIELD files said that during the time, two hundred and twenty-eight people worked in the department. Two were ill. About half of them were not necessarily concerned with the radar. But none of them has a motive to harm the US. All are married, have children or are at least in a relationship, are successful or have many friends. No one is alone, very few have recently suffered severe mental damage. If something happens, you can’t work there. It's about security."
His heart throbbed painfully in his chest, and his ribs were heavy. Tony was glad the suit hid the shaking of his hands.
"How's she?" It hit Tony like a blow that he had not thought about his best friend since he woke up. His thoughts had been with Steve. He felt the fear come back, but Steve squeezed his hand a little tighter. "She's fine so far."
"The cars are ready. But maybe you would want to know something before, James," Peter Krum said more quietly, pointing meaningfully at Tony. The last bit of color disappeared from his face and, appropriately, he heard the thunder of heavy footsteps behind him. He did not have to turn around to realize that another
The sun was shining again, but next to him was Steve sitting in a small chair. He looked at him. His face was pale and sunken, with many wounds, but he smiled wearily at him. Tony could not resist a relieved breath.
Tony could do nothing. The words had disappeared from his mind as his friend talked so excitedly. The man could see that it was also a burden on him. A traitor and a crazy, cold-blooded murderer who had changed the whole situation within a few minutes. Not only were they looking for someone who had a connection to extra-terrestrial life, but also used it to seek revenge on someone who was a whole other person twenty years ago. Rhodey touched his forehead with his hand.
He stared into the darkness. His breathing quickened as he suddenly remembered being quarantined in a dark room as a child when he was ill. He had vomited several times during the night and finally woke up to a nightmare, shouting, but his mother hadn’t heard him. He hadn’t found the strength to get up and search for her, so he just sat there in the cold, dark room in Brooklyn, crying.
A beam from Rhodey's hand and one from Visions head shot quickly at the brain, but when it was hit, it just yelled as if in pain, but didn’t go down.
"It's enough!", Burkwill called and hit Tony against the temple. The blow came unexpectedly and the mechanic fell screaming to the ground. "It's enough!", Burkwill repeated. There was a rushing sound in Tony's ears and he felt warm blood mingling with the cold rain and running down his face. The
"Some agents have gone to where the signal came from. There were no traces of them there. Right now the agents are in the cave. It should be a -"
A sad smile crossed his face as he thought of what had happened. All those years, all that time, Tony Stark had been scared. Afraid of the reaction of a man whom he had despised at first because he had fallen in love with him. And now, at the end of the path, the other one told him that he felt similar.
It felt like an eternity before Steve finally reached the big door to the hall with all the planes. The door had already been pushed open and the soldier remained disturbed. Slowly he went to the door and noticed that a small bag with a note was hanging in front of it.
That seemed to offend Tony. He huffed, “Because I can’t guarantee the standards of someone else’s Courting Ceremony. What if they served fake crab meat and played Bieber all night? What kind of first experience would that be for you?”
Then, there was Tony. Tony’s inclusion in the sketchbook appeared in high frequency right from the moment the Avengers met for the first time. In the beginning, Steve had told himself that it was just irritation that kept Tony on the forefront of his mind and that was why he kept drawing Tony over and over again. And maybe that was true at some point near the start of their rocky acquaintance.
Bucky smirked, looking at Sam from out of the corner of his eyes. “I save the charm for those who still need charming. This guy’s a sure thing.”
Tony seemed to still be admiring the box, rather than making a move to open it. The large box was made from sturdy white cardboard Steve had put together. Along all four sides of the box was a painted skyline of New York against the red and gold backdrop of dawn, the Avengers tower featuring prominently as part of the skyline. On the lid of the box, the red and gold of the sky came together to meet in the middle in a white-blue glow. In the middle of the glow, Steve had painted faint lines to resemble an ethereal arc reactor, like there was an arc reactor instead of the sun lighting up the sky.
Their lips were locked, mouths moving with such hunger that they looked like they were about to devour each other. Steve’s hands were cupped around Tony’s cheeks, tilting his head and holding onto him, as if afraid to let go. Which was ridiculous because one of Tony’s hands were digging into Steve’s shoulder, the other clenched in Steve’s hair, so there really was no danger of Tony going anywhere.
But Tony was already shaking his head, body half hanging out of the plastic bag to stare at the space beside the bathtub.
There was a beautiful, dark haired woman on stage, sitting on the stool across from Tony. She was describing what sounded to be a penthouse. “—with beautiful views over the Hudson river, custom-furnished for Omega needs. It has
“So you threw a huge Courting Ceremony that’s so big, you had to host it at Flushing Meadows, just so I can experience one from the sidelines, without any pressure?” Steve said in near disbelief.
But Tony could be covered from head to toe in a burlap sack and Steve would have still been able to recognize him. It was impossible for Steve to be in Tony’s presence and not know without a doubt that this was Tony. There was something about the way he moved, with a grace and energy that was distinctly Tony’s. Then there was his scent, impossible to mistake as any other person’s with how he smelled like a day out in the middle of summer, hot asphalt and fresh air, happiness and warmth all entwined together.
Every inch of the place was decorated. There were gold satin streamers and silver balloons across the ceiling, with soft blue light mounted in a wave pattern along the walls. Plush gold carpet covered the floor and beautiful glass tables with tall arching metal legs were set periodically against the walls. A round stage was set up at one end of the hall, its burnished steel floor bare.
Steve looked at him, looked down his body in sheer awe. Tony had done it. He had created a power source that could power his size changes without require blood and flesh sacrifices.
“That’s what I’m here for, to help you learn more about us ‘two-legs’ and our world. Not that I’ve been of much use up to now,” Steve said with a self-deprecating smile. He was well-aware that Tony didn’t really need him, was learning everything he needed from the Internet.
Tony looped an arm around Steve’s neck and pulled him down to rub their cheeks together. “Aww, don’t be upset. I thought you sounded very, very adorable. I’m flattered you remembered all those things I like. But putting them into scents...”
“Yeah, well…” Tony bites the inside of his cheek, trying not to look like he’s pouting. “I can’t fix it. I didn’t pack tools. I should have known something was going to go wrong.”
Tony sounded defensive, like Steve had given his approval by playing a mobile game once and was now renegading on his words.
T’Challa nodded, somehow managing to make it regal despite the cute cat mask. “May your courtship be blessed.”
“I wasn’t aware,” Steve said, although a lot of things made more sense now. But it hardly made him feel better. “So you want Tony to join the three of you.”
Thanos was so distracted, turned into a howling mess from his previously composed, vainglorious genocidal self that Vision and Wanda easily restrained him with their powers, in time for Thor to crash down onto him with a gigantic axe. Unceremoniously, Thanos was defeated and dispatched.
Tony squirmed, and didn’t flush because he was much too old to be blushing, no sirree. “Yeah, I’m wet for you,” Tony said, and he wasn’t so far gone into his heat that he didn’t also roll his eyes and say, “Are you proud, you caveman?”
“I’m hallucinating,” Steve wondered aloud. “Maybe it’s a heat stroke.” Never mind that it wasn’t possible for him to get heat stroke.
“I can’t wait to hear your explanation for this,” Tony said with a grin, looking all too amused. “There’s no one else here so I don’t want to hear anything about how someone else did all this. So tell me, Steve, my regular totally normal illustrator, how did you manage to destroy six killer robots?”
Steve startled, looking at Tony with wide eyes. Fury glanced between them and threw up his hands before saying to Steve with a heavy amount of wryness, “At least you didn’t tell him all your secrets on your own.”
Tony was still sufficiently in the grasp of his own mind to realize that he couldn’t actually summon his Iron Man suit to repulsor blast a diplomat, so he instead took out his seething anger on the nearest targets.
Steve rolls his eyes, laughing at his boyfriend’s antics, before a mischievous look crosses his face - and Tony yelps as he finds himself picked up under one arm like so much baggage.
Yes, that was the real concern here, that someone could harm a fire-breathing dragon with scales so tough that Clint’s arrows had bounced right off her when she had unexpectedly turned up in the training room.
“Um, he likes the scent of grass?” Steve said, thinking about Tony’s green smoothies which he drank constantly and always tasted like grass to Steve.
But he was running out of time. The guy with the electrical whips was just about to round the pillar and Tony’s armor was still unfolding across his torso.
Thor waved a hand while thrusting out the large box. “I understand enough, you do not need to worry about it. Now, examine your gift. She’s particularly rambunctious but her scales are like an activated Bifrost Bridge.”
Despite the lack of physical exertion, Steve felt breathless, like he was the one who had been thoroughly fucked over. Taking a deep breath to steady himself, he gently pulled out the pen, drawing a little whimper from Tony who was still slumped in his hand. Steve put the pen down and cradled Tony close, feeling a sudden overwhelming rush of protectiveness for the precious cargo in his hold.
Steve didn’t really care if it became a trend. He just wanted to own who he was and his own history.
Now, the two of them had taken to napping together. Right at that moment, Steve was lying on his side, sprawled out against the cool marble floor. Tony was lying on top of Steve’s side, eyes closed but paws kneading continuously into Steve’s thick gold fur. It was very, very cute and they looked extremely comfortable together. Which didn’t really make sense considering how they were still at odds with each other.
When Steve wasn’t playing silly games on his phone, he was also drawing Tony a lot. Tony was the most interesting sight in the whole house, possibly the whole planet, and he could be so unbearably cute sometimes, it was impossible for Steve to resist putting pencil to paper with the little merman as his muse.
“Alright, listen up, punk.” Bucky stared hard and tightened his grip, obviously trying to impart some important but comforting advice. “You’re screwed when it comes to the dancing.”
The man shrieked and Tony took the opportunity to elbow him in the ribs while ducking out of his hold. Amber was still clamped so hard around the man’s hand that he couldn’t even let go of the knife. The man instinctively tried to swing at the dragon.
Then Steve saw the familiar red and gold Iron Man suit stride around the pillar and Steve quickly released his hold on the other guy. He saw the headbutt coming, could have easily dodged it completely.
Maybe it was just a Tony and Steve thing, as Rhodes had said. They were always going to be weird when they were together, because they were really weird about each other.
Steve’s a veritable lobster at this point. Tony winces, thinking of how much sunburn they’ll both have after this. Which makes him think they’ll need aloe. Which makes him think of rubbing aloe all over Steve’s body. Which keeps him distracted enough for the next few minutes until Steve gives him a
“Wait, what?” Steve interjected. “How? There’s the whole size difference and he’s human? And I thought she ended up staying on land instead?”
Slowly, Steve drew his nose down to Tony’s neck instead. There, he seemed to lose some of his vaunted control, suddenly pressing deeper, burying his face into the crook of Tony’s neck. He drew in a sharp breath, moving his nose from side to side like he was inhaling as much of the scent as possible to remember it for good.
“Okay,” Steve said, tightening his hold around Tony’s waist to stem the flow of words momentarily. He didn’t know if he should be insulted at Tony’s lack of confidence in his feelings or if he should be insulted on Tony’s behalf that all those reasons were more plausible than genuine feelings for him. Either way, Steve couldn’t listen to this anymore. “Okay, first, I wasn’t swept up by the hype of it. The hype...was not what I was used to. Courting Ceremonies used to be private, more personal. And people were saying such lies about you.”
Steve stifled a laugh, knowing that if he laughed, it would just encourage Tony to wax poetic about his gorgeous gigantic cock. Obeying the order, Steve used his gloved hand to spread his copious precome around and slicked his cock up with it. He groaned at the feeling of the soft leather glove and his bare fingers against his erection, felt beads of precome leak out when he imagined it was Tony clenched tight around his cock. Steve squeezed and stroked, with Tony on his other hand, upclose and personal with Steve’s cock. He could feel his building excitement, knew he wouldn’t last long after the arousing show combined with that implicit statement of total trust from Tony.
“It’s hard to tell with Thor,” Steve said through gritted teeth. Were all their comrades in arms going to turn up to have a chance with Tony? Steve had no idea they were all interested otherwise he might have come up with more strategies on courting Tony.
He gasped as strong arms swept around him, jerked him against a hard body. Steve’s arms and scent enveloped him, pulling him close as Steve buried his face in the side of Tony’s neck. Tony held stiff, too upset, not wanting to be comforted after the fact.
Steve was going to tell Tony that would never happen, when Fury said, “You would be surprised what S.H.I.E.L.D. can do with sufficient motivation.”
Tony said, widening his eyes in a way that Steve knew right away was him trying to look cute, and damnit, he did look very cute. Steve tried to hold strong against the concentrated amount of adorableness in those big brown eyes set in a small pointed face.
His face looked pale under the bright white light and his hair looked thin while plastered to his forehead. The way his lips were pressed together made him look grim, unfriendly. He tucked the towel around his waist with a sigh.
Last week, they had discovered all their socks, pens and cufflinks missing. Every single one of those items from every locked room had gone entirely missing, only to turn up in a huge pile in Amber’s nest in her own suite. At least the stories about dragons and their hoard was right. They hadn’t been able to get any of those items back either and they hadn’t discovered a way yet to buy new socks, pens or cufflinks without them going missing within a day.
M’Baku raised an unimpressed eyebrow. “Kissing in greeting is the Jabari way. Surely you don’t believe I should forfeit my customs for your rules.”
The books that Tony was standing on hadn’t been balanced properly, and stepping forward in his agitation, Tony had unbalanced the short stack. The first book was very thin and tipped forward with Tony still on it. His arms pinwheeling for balance, Tony fell forward off the stack. Even though the fall to the table would have been a short one, Steve’s heart leapt in his chest and he swooped in with an open palm, catching Tony gently on his open hand. He barely felt the weight of Tony’s body through his fingerless leather glove.
And he wouldn’t say anything because he couldn’t begrudge Tony the experience of having a dragon for a pet.
Tony groaned and thrust again, before shuffling back a little to lean against Steve’s slightly curved palm. He started stripping hurriedly, not even bothering to stand up to do it. Steve helped, feeling a little like an overgrown, clumsy giant as he lightly pinched tiny fabric between his fingers to pull them away as Tony wriggled out of them. Gripping the hem of Tony’s jeans, he helped pull them off as Tony raised his hips off Steve’s palm and gave Steve a provocative look. And of course, with the pants discarded, Tony was completely nude because he had been going commando. Stretched out completely naked on Steve’s hand, a pale contrast against the dark brown of Steve’s leather glove, it was even clearer that the situation was really turning Tony on. His cock, that looked very tiny but was proportional to the rest of his body, was hard and leaking. He arched his back and stretched his arms up, shamelessly on display for Steve.
“No, I mean, fuck me with something. Use something and fuck me with it, move me around and hold me,” Tony groaned out, his cheeks flushed again but his hips moved with his words, more aroused now at whatever he was imagining.
He lightly tapped a short staccato beat against the lips of Steve’s mask and hummed with satisfaction. Just the feeling of Tony’s fingers so close to his mouth, even through the barrier of a mask, was enough to make Steve’s lips tingle, to wish the mask hadn’t been there at all. Steve realized that must be why Tony wasn’t recognized by his voice as well, he must have had the modulator on earlier.
The platinum links and silver fabric went around Tony’s narrow wrist as Steve did up the clasp. It was just the right length, with enough give that it wasn’t tight and uncomfortable against his skin. Seeing his bracelet on Tony... It was breathtaking. He could only hope that one day, Tony would put his own bracelet on Steve too, signalling that the courtship was successful and he was agreeing to an engagement.
Obediently, Steve lifted Tony up, higher and higher based on Tony’s impatient gestures. When Tony was on eye level with Steve’s face, he said,
“Steve,” Tony said in his ear in a long and entirely satisfied exhalation, like he was just luxuriating in how the name rolled off his tongue.
The greeters took their invitations, scanned them while making small talk and ushered them in. When Steve presented his suitor’s invitation that F.R.I.D.A.Y. had sent him, they beamed at him and put a slim black bracelet around his wrist. Apparently, it was a communication device that the suitors would need for the events of the night.
“Sure, blame me,” Bucky said. “Hey, one person did accept your gift, which was the one gift you spent more than one minute thinking about: Peggy Carter.”
Bucky sat on lush green grass, ignoring the goat chewing on the sleeve of his shirt. He held the tablet up so that Steve could see the rest of the goats scattered around the field.
A Courting Ceremony for everyone? So Tony was turning this into an open Courting Ceremony, instead of one just for himself? The whispers started up among the crowd, but Steve kept his gaze trained on Tony.
His eyes landed on a lingerie store. Maybe Tony would prefer something racy for a Courting gift. No, not for Tony, because then that would be a present for
Preen and plunge his mouth downwards again, fucking himself onto Steve’s wonderful erection. Seve cried out with pleasure, and his hips moved restlessly, trying not to thrust too much. Which was ridiculous because Tony wanted him to thrust, so he moved his hands to Steve’s hips and encouraged the motion, beckoned him forward.
When Steve followed that jawline, followed that sharp line of a dark goatee with his thumb, all the while still kissing Tony, he felt a low vibration against his lips, against his chest as Tony groaned. Tony’s hand dug into Steve’s hair, scratching lightly into his scalp, and Steve could only sigh into the kiss, part his lips for another taste-test, for more of the same.
Steve couldn’t keep his eyes off Tony, didn’t even care about the audience. So when Tony turned to face him, Steve could see the moment Tony shed his public mask and gave him a soft look, just for him. “Want to get out of here?” Tony asked hopefully.
Now, Steve could feel Tony holding his hand in return, like he needed the support. Steve squeezed his hand, hopeful that it felt reassuring.
Tony swanned in knowing that he was more than 20 minutes late to team brunch, which was currently held on a balcony at the Cuckoo Clock, their favorite hipster brunch place. They often reserved the balcony table as it afforded them some privacy from other gawking diners since there was only room for one table and the balcony was situated towards the back of the restaurant.
Happy leaned down and whispered something else, a little sharp. This made Tony blink and clear his throat again. He opened the first sketchbook and flipped through the pages, before turning the sketchbook around so Steve could see which one he had stopped at. Finally, they were in sync again because Steve could clearly read the question in Tony’s eyes; he wanted to know if Steve was fine with Tony showing this particular sketch to the world.
, showed that there were worse things than rejection. Steve had been thinking — that was all he was doing, thinking, not
Smiling, Tony nodded in relaxed agreement. “What Captain America says.” Because there really was absolutely no way that Rhodey would have invited Ty. Rhodey was more likely to punch Ty’s lights out than invite him anywhere, let alone to his wedding. “Let me guess, you’re someone’s plus one and you decided to come just to be a nuisance to us.”
Grinning, Steve shook his head. He should have known that it wouldn’t be long before Tony mustered text messaging so he could communicate with Steve no matter what.
Now, Bucky watched as Tony leapt onto the conference table and laid down with his paws tucked neatly under him, resulting in his body resembling a little loaf of black bread. It was too cute and Bucky was finding it hard to reconcile this with Tony Stark. From the way the others kept looking Tony’s way, he wasn’t the only one.
Steve grumbled under his breath, “Tony’s eyes are perfect, they don’t need stupid fur to bring out their depths. Their depths are perfect as they are.”
Too many pages were practically dedicated love notes to Tony, just in art form. It was impossible not to see Steve’s feelings once anyone looked at the sketches.
The light on Tony’s chest flared sharply and spilled outwards, sudden enough that Steve found he couldn’t see, blinded by the abrupt white blue light that filled the room. He shaded his eyes with his arm but it was too late. He was still blinking away little starbursts of light when he slowly tried to look around.
At their wedding, they invited John Oliver too. He cried a lot during the ceremony and wasn’t ashamed to say it at all on his next show.
“I’ve got a spare shirt in my gym bag,” Steve said quickly. “I can get back to work, Mister Stark, don’t worry.”
“Tony,” Steve interrupts, trying not to laugh, “we are not going to die. Last time we looked at the map we were thirty miles to the nearest town, so it’ll be a bit of a walk but we can find a mechanic and be back on our way in no time.”
How could Steve question him? Tony pulled at Steve’s cock, massaging at the knot he could feel there, tissue not yet engorged but hardening under his ministration and in the soup of heat pheromones. “
, felt Steve touch him, thumbs pressing on the cheeks of his backside, long fingers massaging his flesh as he was held open for Steve’s inspection. For all of Tony’s experience, he trembled at this, certain he could feel Steve’s gaze as he drew over his body. What a sight he must make, wanton and completely naked, spine a long swoop to present his ass up for the taking, legs parted in welcome.
It was a fair question. Tony had a way with computers and the way he got into Steve’s bank account so easily meant that he likely could do it for other people’s bank accounts too.
“Well, I mean, I also approached him because of his aforementioned lovely mouth and pretty blue eyes. And you should see how he runs on the beach. All those muscles and glistening sweaty body, you expect me not to approach him?” Tony asked, grinning as he enjoyed how Steve was blushing.
Tony blinked slowly. “You’re used to getting black eyes?” Then his surprised expression shifted into a worried frown. “Steve, what’s your situation at home? I’ve got a lot of resources, if you tell me what’s going on, I can help you.”
Then Fury rolled his eyes. “I don’t care about what hanky panky you get up to on your down time, Cap.”
Steve realized the lift’s doors had opened while they had been talking and it was about to shut again before he noticed that they were on level 35, his floor. Scuttling sideways to avoid touching Stark with his dirty shirt, Steve quickly held the doors and stepped out. “Sorry about the mess, Mister Stark. I’ll let someone know and help clean up.”
“This looks ten times larger than what the Stark Expo used to be,” Bucky said, looking a little uncomfortable at all the people and staying closest to the wall.
Carding his hands through Steve’s entirely mussed hair, Tony said softly, “I accept your suit. We can begin our courtship.”
Bucky turned to see Steve had abandoned his food as well and had wandered closer, but his ears were drooped and his tail was tucked a little between his legs. Bucky rolled his eyes.
“I thought it was unlikely for me to wind up with a true match at this point in my life,” Tony said, still looking at him straight on.
Tony felt the moment Steve saw and recognized him, the way his forearm tightened behind Tony’s back. Steve always had an eye for faces and it was clear that he remembered this one from the Courting Ceremony. It was a handsome face, objectively, with angular features and longish blond hair slicked back from chilly blue eyes. If one didn’t know the viper coiled within, he might even be attractive. Maybe.
Steve shook himself out of his daze and stepped towards the kitchen to put his leaking glass in the sink. “I know that, Sam. I’m not that out of touch.”
Steve caught him, having leapt to his feet with more success when he noticed Tony’s imbalance. His arms wrapped around Tony’s upper torso, and Tony’s hands were pressed to Steve’s chest. Looking down, Steve realized that Tony was a few inches shorter than Steve now, which was an interesting thought to have considering that Tony was only a few inches high in totality a few minutes ago.
Steve stood by the rockpools, staring out into the sea. It was barely dawn, the sky mostly dark with the sun just peeking over the horizon.
Clapping Vision on the shoulder, Clint asked, “I always meant to ask but what’s your primary gender then? You don’t have any scent, so it’s hard to tell.”
Tony snorted, an inelegant sound unbefitting of Omegas. “S.H.I.E.L.D.’s assessment vastly overestimates Ty. I don’t know for sure, but in retrospect, Ty was probably Obie’s pawn. Ty really isn’t clever or strong enough to be a threat to anyone, let alone Obie. He would have been easily controlled by Obie, and if I had married Ty, then it would ensure that there wasn’t any random Alpha in my life that Obie didn’t have full control over. But of course, I didn’t know any of that back then. I just knew that Howard and Obie were hellbent on continuing with the ceremony and I would likely be pressured to choose Ty.”
Steve stopped, feeling his jaw hurt from how much he was clenching his teeth, and the muscles of his back were all stiff from how badly he was holding himself.
“I have, but outside of Courting Week. I never saw the point of waiting until Courting Week,” Steve said absently, stopping at the next store to stare in. Row upon row of beautifully tailored suits, and they were all useless to Steve. Tony’s closet probably cost more than the entire store put together. And Tony’s favorite well-worn T-shirt had little kittens on the front. Steve doubted that would be the kind of clothing he would find in this store.
Steve was crying out and moaning in turns, his back slumped against the wall. It was a good thing Tony had positioned them so close to one. He was really enjoying how heavily Steve’s cock was leaking now, and he pulled back to suck on the flushed vulnerable head, lave his tongue against the little slit like he could coax more precome out.
Suddenly, he realized that dancing with Tony was actually...easy. It wasn’t stiff, awkward and daunting, all his usual descriptions that he applied to dancing. It was like having Tony here with him made dancing easy, because that was how things were like with Tony sometimes. They fought, they clashed, they had to work through so many issues. But then sometimes, they just clicked into place, on the battlefield, in a conversation, and now, on a dancefloor. They synced up totally, and it was like they just intuitively knew how the other person was going to move.
Now it was Tony’s turn to gape at him. It was a really funny sight, with the way Tony’s mouth fell open a little and how he just stared with slightly wild eyes. Steve brought his hand up to rub his nose in an attempt to hide his smile.
Half submerged in the rockpool, upper body pushed out from the seawater and leaning against the warm rocks, was a person.
There was a moment of stunned silence, the wide space packed full of people completely still as they took this all in.
Steve looked at him sharply and for a moment, Tony thought that Steve had somehow managed to miss all the coverage on the old sordid history between Ty and himself. But Steve instead said, “It’s
“What...what even— Why?” Steve said, rather incoherently. “Why do you— Did I do something that made you—?”
Suddenly, Steve was acutely aware that he had an armful of naked Tony, whom he had just realized was scorchingly attractive.
“Sounds like a hell of a lady to like a gift like that,” Sam said, clapping Steve on the shoulder in light reassurance.
Rolling his eyes, Sam started patting Steve’s head and Steve closed his eyes as if to settle down for a nap as well.
“Hey, why am I hearing about Steve joining this courtship madness from the press instead of from any one of you assholes?”
He turned forward again, let his forehead rest on the mattress. Then he reached backwards and with both hands grasped his own cheeks, holding himself wide open for Steve.
Steve’s mind just couldn’t comprehend what he was seeing. His jaw worked as he took in the dark hair swept back from the little face, so much like a doll’s, with large brown eyes and a neat little goatee, framing a small but plush mouth. The little being was frowning, head tilted. On his bare chest, was a tiny circle of illegible scribblings, glowing faintly blue.
That voice...it hadn’t been speaking aloud. That smooth voice had been in his head. What the hell? Steve stared wildly at the little face that looked affronted at Steve’s reaction. For some reason, a tiny merman was shocking but
“Seemed like a bad one,” Steve said with a grimace of empathy. Then he asked tentatively, “Do you want to talk about it?”
The glass doors to the penthouse opened silently and Steve trailed after Tony, a little worried about Tony’s quieter mood, which was very unlike him.
a dragon, Tony.” Steve stared up into the sky. From a quick count, there were about a dozen dragons up there, ranging from ones as small as a large dog to a couple elephant-sized dragons. “And can we park this discussion until after we save New York from all the dragons?”
When Steve opened the box, he grinned down at the contents. Despite Rhodey’s complaints, he crowded in with the others to peer at what Steve got.
Did he want Tony to want him for who he was? Because right now, he felt like Tony set a masquerade dance for a reason, so he probably wanted someone who could dance. Forget all that stuff about wanting Tony to want him for who he was. Steve wanted to be the kind of person Tony wanted. Not a boring old-fashioned Alpha who wasn’t fun and didn’t know how to dance.
“Captain, I wish you good luck on your endeavours in courting Tony. I am, as they say, rooting for you,” Vision said from beside Wanda, looking a little uncomfortable in his black suit.
Thanos steps forward menacingly, looking between Steve and Tony. “Even without the bomb, you can’t stop me. You aren’t prepared, you’re on
Rhodes said with mischief in his voice, his dark eyes amused even through the mask’s eyeholes, “So that I can tell him that I spoke to you and I know you’re serious.”
Well...he didn’t have to, it turned out. Tony had figured it out on his own and he hadn’t treated Steve any differently anyway.
Tony cried out, jerked and shook as his hips rolled with desperation, as he fucked himself back on Steve’s magnificent cock. His body pulsed and squeezed around Steve, his own cock surging and shooting come. He pressed into Steve’s teeth, keened as he felt Steve suck and lave at his bond mark, felt his body shudder and jerk as he came again on Steve’s cock.
Tony turned his wrist so that his hand was cupping Steve’s cheek, drawing his face up. Steve didn’t know when it happened, but his eyelids had fallen shut. He opened them again now and looked into Tony’s dark eyes, molten with heat.
The lights all snapped off to plunge them into total darkness. When the lights gradually came back on again, there was a stool on the once-empty stage and Tony was perched on it. He also had Happy standing next to him, looking distinctly disgruntled. With Tony sitting down and his side facing the front of the stage, Steve could see that the waistcoat only covered the lower half of his back. From this angle, he couldn’t see much of Tony’s bared skin but his imagination helpfully conjured up sharp shoulder blades and the graceful line of his spine. Steve had to adjust his collar, feeling a little heated under his own suit.
Tony sighed and looked away finally, before mumbling, “I heard you haven’t been to a Courting Ceremony before.”
“You’re both supposed to be on my side, not ganging up on me,” Tony complained, leaning an arm against Steve’s.
“It’s gorgeous,” Tony said, tracing the suit with a finger without touching the canvas. His voice was soft, unusually quiet. “I love it. Thank you.”
Tony got to work. He licked all over Steve’s cock to start off with, leaving no inch unlavished. He nuzzled into the dark blond curls at the root of Steve’s hard length, breathing in the heavy Alpha musk that left him throbbing, that caused him to leak from his hole as well. He was wet enough that it felt slippery between his cheeks and he shifted on his knees with some pleasure. From Steve’s sharp inhale, he could smell Tony’s arousal too.
“That’s true. And you want Tony to want you for who you are, don’t you? And he knows you can’t dance,” Natasha said in a soothing tone.
“It’ll take awhile before the aquarium will be usable, maybe about four to six weeks. There’s all these things about cycling the tank and curing the live rock. So you won’t be able to use it right away,” Steve explained. He moved over to his desk from the large tank so that he could touch a finger to Tony’s outstretched hand.
Bucky interrupted Steve’s morose thoughts. “What? You want to start looking for a Courting gift for a billionaire from Dollar Tree instead?”
“Hello, everyone,” Tony greeted with a blinding grin. “It’s time for the most exciting part of the event: Which Pokemon I’m going to choose.”
Tony reached up and touched Steve’s wrist. The metal gauntlet curling around his wrist was surprisingly gentle as Tony carefully pulled his hand down. For all the destructive power behind the Iron Man suit, it could be wielded with a shocking level of delicacy and restraint.
“You have the shoulders,” Tony points out, eyes narrowed as he gives Steve’s shoulders a look Steve’s painfully familiar with. He usually keeps it for analysing the Iron Man armor but Steve knows better than to encourage it.
Steve strode forward, ignoring the photographers who were quickly snapping shots of him in his deep blue three-piece suit and white shirt. His suit jacket, vest and fitted slacks had the finest dark red, almost black, pinstripes through them, the color only visible on close inspection. He wore a deep red bowtie as well to finish off the look. When Sam had seen what he was wearing, he had whistled and said, “Captain America formal wear. This is gonna become a trend, mark my words.”
“Isn’t she amazing?” Tony said, which was probably the hundredth time he had said that about Amber at this point. She preened under his attention.
Tony nodded, lifting the normal-sized arc reactor and the tiny arc reactor he had on a chain around his neck. “I’ll hold onto it when I shift, I know how this should be done.”
“I believe Mister Stark is having a nightmare,” J.A.R.V.I.S. explained, sounding calm and not at all surprised. It wasn’t the first time then. Since Tony usually slept in his glass or in his aquarium, Steve probably never found out about this.
“The two of you should try to get along since you’re both stuck in the same situation,” Bucky suggested when they walked by him.
Amber was covered in deep gold scales, with claws in a dark bronze shade and two streaks of brilliant royal blue against her cheeks. It made her look like she had somehow dipped into Steve’s paint supplies to color her cheeks.
Tony could probably easily rebuild other larger, helper bots, but Steve already knew he wouldn’t. Once Tony was attached, he didn’t let go easily. He even had a favorite wrench he slept with.
“S.H.I.E.L.D. wants to know what’s the cause of your recent unusual behavior,” Steve admitted, feeling calm for the first time since Tony had walked through the door, finally settling down now that he didn’t have to make up bullshit excuses. “And I’m going to guess it’s got something to do with the black lines creeping up your neck.”
Oh god, that was really the stupidest answer he could have given. Steve tried, “I have a very bad sense of direction?”
Suddenly, Steve stopped and turned to the journalist who had called out that last question. It was unusual for any one of the Avengers to stop for questions from the press, so immediately, several cameras turned his way. Steve smiled, summoning a good all-American grin that he used to wear for the USOs and directed it at the journalists and photographers. Camera flashes went off by the dozens.
Tony met Steve’s gaze and rolled his eyes, like he was so over this. Steve wanted to at once kiss Tony and shake him. Tony’s cavalier attitude towards his own safety and inability to take threats against his life seriously would drive Steve completely crazy one day.
With Nat left in Legal working closely with Miss Potts instead since Tony hadn’t taken the honeypot bait, they were reduced to old fashioned snooping to find out the reasons behind Tony’s recent erratic behavior. Donating away his entire modern art collection, making Pepper CEO with little preparation… It all spoke of something else going on behind the scenes.
Tony looked around the audience and took a deep breath, exhaling slowly. “I have to admit… I had a whole speech planned out. Regardless of who I chose, there was this whole spiel I had about what an amazing universe we live in, and life being worth living, how we have to keep going and moving, how we couldn’t let things get us down for good no matter how astronomically weird it gets. If we stop living, then ultimately, we’ve lost, no matter how many lives we’ve saved.” He tapped against his chest, a nervous tic he fell back to when he wasn’t sure about what he was doing.
Steve pulled away and licked his flushed wet lips, the sight surely enough to drive better men to madness.
“In my defence, I was under the influence of my heat hormones,” Tony snapped, before softening. “And in your defence, you were probably under the influence of my heat pheromones.”
Steve cupped Tony’s cheek, running a thumb along the sharp line of his goatee, blue eyes soft as he said, “I am always interested. Trust me on this, Tony. There’s no one else in this world that interests me like you do.”
Steve turned from the television embedded in the wall to look at Tony, hair completely rumpled and standing in wild crazy spikes. There was a pillow crease imprint on his cheek, his goatee less neat than usual since they hadn’t taken any breaks to groom over the last three days of Tony’s heat. Tony smelled delicious, his scent during his heat a siren song to Steve’s senses, a lush tangy taste on Steve’s tongue. It was all the more enhanced by how Steve could smell his own scent wrapped around Tony’s, could feel his Alpha instincts rumble with satisfaction at how they smelled, the two of them,
Gently, Steve cupped a hand against Tony’s curved back, where he was curling up into a ball of miserable merman. He laid a thumb on Tony’s shoulder and patted him very, very softly. “Tony, Tony, wake up. Tony, you’re safe.” He kept up the soothing words until those small dark lashes fluttered. Then Tony blinked up blearily at Steve.
“Now, now, Steve...that would be cheating,” Tony murmured, eyes glittering with happiness as he leaned in and rested the side of their faces together. The move was hindered by the masks that they still had on, but it was clearly an attempt to rub their cheeks together, share scent, and Steve revelled in the gesture coming from Tony.
“M’Baku has joined the mud-wrestling contest and Nakia is suggesting we change his mind about his so-called Jabari customs,” T’Challa said, sounding amused through his mask.
After a moment, Tony seemed to relax a little, expression softening as he seemed to remember they were meant to be having lunch together. He scooped up food to his mouth.
“Mine, this is mine,” Tony growled, bending down to suck the head of Steve’s cock into his mouth, flicking his tongue against the slit until Steve arched, until his feet drummed against the floor. Tony pulled back with satisfaction, looked at Steve’s open-mouthed pleasure. “Mine. Not Kevin’s. I’m not sharing.”
“Good…point,” Steve conceded. Then he took a deep breath and looked at the camera on his laptop. “Thank you, F.R.I.D.A.Y.. If I do earn his favor, I’ll do my best to make him happy.”
“I’m giving you five Lamborghinis, two Porsche and two Ferrari,” said a haughty-looking older man, gesturing at the photos Tony must have been looking at on his Starkpad. A fleet of nine cars were projected on the large screens as well, so that the audience could see what he was getting Tony.
Tony looked at the lid of the box for so long that Steve had to fight not to squirm and in the end, couldn’t help but say, “I wanted to decorate the box but it’s not the actual gift. The gifts are inside.”
Their kisses slowed eventually, from deeply passionate and exploratory plundering to softly savoring and sweet pecks, always going back for another kiss like they couldn’t quite stand to stop now. Steve rubbed his cheek against Tony’s, unable to resist at all, and Tony responded by dragging his wrists against the sides of Steve’s neck. The mutual scent-marking sent shivers down Steve’s spine and he gasped, to which Tony only rubbed his cheek with enthusiasm against Steve’s ear.
Bucky and Sam drew back slowly, their passionate, biting kiss had turned soft and lingering. If Tony hadn’t interrupted them now, they might have started making out right at the table. It was worse than being around a couple of hormonal teenagers.
The approach of it was also unsettling. There were no discussions, no warmth during the gift presentation. No one declared their intentions when they presented the gifts, be it an interest in a trial courtship or a devoted intention for a marriage. It was all taken for granted, like this was just a game.
“I knew it! I knew you couldn’t be a normal human! Captain America, oh my god. Captain America tried to tell me his superserum healing and strength is due to
Doctor Strange waved his hand. “I’m sure it’s doable and we’ve put some people on researching this, but we don’t have time to make it a priority. We need to prepare for Thanos.”
Steve remembered Natasha saying something about a pick-me-up, but he had been hoping that Tony had a more personal objective behind the Courting Ceremony, that it wasn’t all just for show.
“He’s never been to a Courting Ceremony either,” Bucky chimed in. “Said he didn’t see the point and people should be able to decide who they like without a ceremony.”
“You could have just asked me out for a dance,” Steve said, feeling a little bold, feeling his chest tighten in anticipation.
The next few suitors were similar. They got less than three minutes on stage, most of it spent describing their gifts. Tony accepted or rejected with varying levels of interest, and the suitors weren’t given much of a chance to react before they were ushered off the stage.
Oh god, the big puppy eyes on that little face was just too cute. Those tiny little lashes that rimmed the deep wide eyes was just too much. Steve tried to stay strong, tried to be rational, rubbing his forehead as he stalled. “I don’t know… This is a lot to take in.”
Steve tried to distract himself, tried to focus on T’Challa’s chosen topic. He suddenly realized there was something that he wanted to raise. “It was fine. Got a little intense at times. M’Baku was a suitor at the ceremony too. I didn’t—” Steve cut himself off, cut off his seething anger at the memory of M’Baku kissing Tony. He forced himself to stick to something that wouldn’t sound accusatory. “I wasn’t expecting him there.”
With hair coiffed a little higher than usual and a goatee that had been shaped into perfection, Tony smirked at the crowd.
Despite the giant aquarium that was finally ready for use in the living room, Tony still seemed to prefer working on the desk, where he was near to Steve. Steve was used to being at his desk and having Tony there with him as well, usually with two little robots zooming about on the wooden surface.
He squinted into the water, trying to see a small figure with a flash of red and gold. He looked around, worried. They always met up in an hour. Where was Tony? Was he in danger? Stopped from coming back? What could it be?
“Can I help you, sir?” an assistant offered, dressed in a gray cashmere sweater and dark slacks. His name badge said ‘Lee’ and he smelled like an Omega. “This is our current bestseller and a real hit among the Omegas right now.”
Steve winced, rubbing the back of his neck. “I just mixed up the glasses. I wasn’t looking when I reached for my milk.”
The woman’s face lit up with joy when Tony accepted her gift, clasping her hands to her chest in disbelief. On one hand, it was a relief to know that such gifts were well received by Tony. On the other hand, her artwork looked a lot more professional than anything Steve could ever produce. He was starting to feel a little sick at how inadequate his gifts might be.
“I’m glad you’re not using the voice modulator too,” Steve blurted out, possibly sounding kind of stupid.
Steve blinked, holding his coffee in front of him like it was a shield. He was careful not to hold it too tightly, having learned from his lesson.
Steve and Tony exchanged looks. Already, there was the telltale hint of red on the tips of Steve’s ears. Tony on the other hand didn’t blush easily, no matter what stereotypes there were about Omegas. There was little that embarrassed him these days.
Curling his hand into Steve’s hair, he turned his head to press his own face to Steve’s cheek, barely able to move when Steve refused to budge. He drew in a deep breath and felt more slick dampen his briefs at the deep scent of oak and old paper and rain on hot tar. It was delicious and too much all at once.
“What were you saying about my size difference kink? Do you want to instead talk about your manhandling kink?” Steve asked with a smile.
But they said they would wait, and so they would. Tony squeezed that knot a little mournfully, which caused Steve to groan deep in his chest and shoot out another weak pulse of come. His knot was subsiding already, growing soft under Tony’s touch. It had still lasted a surprising length of time outside of a grasping hole. Tony felt proud at the realization.
Steve sucked him down, swallowed him as Tony gasped and shook, trying not to come immediately. When Steve let Tony’s cock slide with excruciating slowness out of his mouth, Tony almost cried out in protest. But he didn’t have time to marshal any demands because Steve was moving back to where Tony was dripping with want and dragging his tongue over puckered skin with the barest of touch.
Steve dutifully bit down into one but also said at the same time with some exasperation, “Eating doesn’t actually improve my mood, you know.”
Steve had been watching the news in the living room but he turned it off, not finding anything of particular interest beyond some rebuilding going on in New York city. He wandered towards his desk, immediately holding out a finger for Tony to grasp.
Steve blinked in surprise and Tony smiled in response, saying, “Tit for tat, I thought it was my turn to do some undercover work.”
He had gone for his usual coffee break and came back to his floor only to find Tony Stark lurking outside the lift waiting for him. Yes, waiting for him specifically, because Steve had tried a casual greeting before walking by, except Tony had held out a hand to stop him. So many of Steve’s coworkers were stealing glances at them, probably wondering what on earth an illustrator was doing chatting with Tony Stark. Maintaining a mild-mannered nobody-important cover was so hard. How did anyone do this?
“I, uh, I’ll get you some clothes to wear,” Steve said, sounding more breathless than he would prefer.
Sam and Bucky were making matching disgusted faces, which really, it was obvious why they were both Courting now.
Steve got into the lift with several other S.I. employees all shuffling in. Most of them got off on Level 14, leaving Steve and one other person in the lift. Steve glanced over and startled badly to find Tony Stark staring right at him. Those dark brown eyes gave him a slow once over, dark lashes lowering as his gaze swept down and then up again.
All the graceful couples and groups spinning together and laughing as they danced the night away buoyed him with thoughts of, “That’s because of me.”
The little smile on the corner of Steve’s lips belied his irritation at Sam, but Tony leaned in anyway to press a soft kiss to that lovely curve. He murmured, “My dear Alpha, now we have matching earrings and funny scents, yes?”
“Business as usual then,” Natasha said with a lopsided smile while Clint mimed being stabbed through the chest.
Tony gestured wildly at his own neck, demanding, “Can’t you tell when I’m in heat? Everyone else could. There were all these people who kept coming up to me and there was Vicente and Alexandre circling and circling.”
Steve only had a vague idea that many of the fairytales consumed by the general public were vastly changed from the originals told by the likes of Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm but he hadn’t actually known The Little Mermaid was one of them. He listened on in somewhat of a daze.
After the bath, Tony had curled up in a nest of clean cloths — including Steve’s own T-shirt that he had sacrificed for the cause — and fallen asleep on the workbench. Even his snoring, which was much less peaceful when he was in full size, sounded adorable and tinny now. Tony’s sleeping face, with slightly parted lips and those tiny dark lashes fanned across his cheeks, was somehow even more adorable, which Steve hadn’t known was even possible.
Tony was full human-sized, except maybe even taller if he could somehow stand, because he still had his merman’s tail. The tail was very thick and long, about two feet longer than Steve’s own legs. The tail’s red scales shimmered with a rich gold lustre under the indoor lighting and the tail fins draped over the fallen coffee table that had been knocked over when Tony changed in size. Steve’s eyes traced up Tony’s body, up and past where scales turned to soft pale skin. Tony’s body was leanly muscled, something he hadn’t noticed before, with broad shoulders and a firm chest tapering down to a slimmer waist. His arms looked strong, his fingers long and graceful.
“You’re hardly a regular Alpha yourself,” Tony commented as he ran his hand up and down Steve’s arm. “Most Alphas would have run away at half the things that happened in my Courting Ceremony. And they definitely would have made me delete the mud-wrestling photos.”
As if to prove Bucky’s point right at that moment, Steve lifted his head up and turned to look at Tony, not making a sound. After a few seconds, Tony opened one golden eye and hissed, glaring at Steve. He dug his claws threateningly into Steve’s thick fur, as if promising to draw blood if he got serious. They stared at each other for a long silent minute. Then, Steve put his head back down on the marble floor with a big sigh and closed his eyes again. After a silent moment, Tony released his clawed grip and relaxed against Steve’s side, continuing his lazy kneading with his paws. A purr started up from deep within Tony’s chest, loud enough for even Bucky and Rhodes to hear it.
Tony didn’t look fazed in the slightest. He turned back to Steve with a grin and then looked into the box with interest. “What’s next then?”
He knew he was being selfish and unfair. Tony gaining more independence was a good thing. Soon, he might not even need to stay with Steve anymore. With the creation of his bots and with a butler like J.A.R.V.I.S., with the modern world that delivered practically anything you wanted to your doorstep, Steve’s presence in Tony’s life would soon be superfluous.
Steve smiled. “No, you didn’t. But I recognize that expression by now after three days of you saying it aloud.”
Tony shook his head. “I should have known that I couldn’t fool a supersoldier with enhanced senses by just putting on a mask.”
He leaned forward and nuzzled the knot that had popped up during Steve’s orgasm, closing his hand around that hard protuberance and squeezing. Steve trembled and his cock shot out another pulse of come, splashing against Tony’s chest. Humming in delight, Tony leaned forward and mouthed at the knot, licking and sucking, rhythmically squeezing it between his reverent hands and lips. Steve came again and again, little pulses of come every time Tony squeezed harder, sucked teasingly on the knot.
That was...technically true. Steve laughed ruefully, aware that both Tony and him seemed destined to be managed by their respective Jameses at every turn.
The way she said the last sentence was very suggestive. Tony was looking at something on his StarkPad, probably the photographs of said beautiful apartment. Photos of the apartment were also projected onto the big screen which explained what would happen when a gift was too big to be carted onto the stage. Steve couldn’t see what made the place custom-furnished for Omegas and wondered if it was euphemism for something more risque. The thought made possessiveness roil in his gut which he had to grit his teeth to ignore.
Tony grinned. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I had a Courting Ceremony and everything, and tied the knot with an Alpha. I’m a good ole regular Omega.”
The thing was that Steve and Tony were fine. They were fine, completely alright. Oh sure, there had been tense moments, harsh and low arguments late into the night, but they had worked through their issues. Shouted, cried, apologized and hugged it out. It was hard to hold grudges when Tony had staggered off that plane with Nebula and nearly collapsed straight into Steve’s arms when Steve had run towards him. They had both clung to each other, obviously amazed and relieved that the other was alive.
As Tony and Steve ran through the living room to their rooms, the Avengers were gone. Steve turned left, pulling away from Tony, to look for his suit, while Friday sent the now-completed version of the Iron Man Suit into the plane. Tony was a little proud of his armor extension. Friday's control allowed her to help him in critical situations. If he was in the suit but only if his breathing slowed, she would take over control completely. With trembling hands, the inventor run into his room and rummaged for the medication, which he still had to take. His arm had almost healed thanks to medical technology, even though scars were still visible. It still hurt, but he could move it.
He was startled, apparently confused that Tony spoke to him. "It was something with ... a hacker who made the mess possible," he explained. "Something with servers and IPs and ... read yourself."
Tony grabbed the soldier's arm and pulled the man behind him. "Come on," he shouted in the out race. "We're flying to Boston."
"Looks like nanotechnology", he mumbled but was sure his friend understood him. His arm hurt. His shoulder felt like shit. He cursed again. "Fuck", Rhodey said again and said exactly what Tony thought.
Bucky had touched Steve in his panic and even tried to help, which was hard due to the injuries. Eventually, at some point, he spat everything that was in him until Tony could only strangle and apologize. He felt bad because he could not calm Steve's panic, but only made things worse, but was more than grateful for Bucky's presence at the moment. It was probably the point where Tony forgot everything the Winter Soldier ever did.
"Fury has provided a safe shelter just south of Boston for us," said Natasha. "He’s checked Tony's statement, and find it appropriate; several agent teams are following us now. In addition, some aircraft are traveling to other cities, because of the distraction."
The elevator doors opened in the moment and several people stepped out. In the front, there were Fury and Natasha walking, who limped a bit. Tony remembered: She was shot, too.
"We’ve got them!" Clint cheered in the microphone to the others. When the cheers of the others arrived over the communications system, Clint sought a suitable place to land. Fortunately, the plane was built so that it could come down and start almost anywhere without problems. Clint didn’t see what happened, but Natasha suddenly shouted and then put her hand over her mouth. Bucky took a deep breath and suddenly seemed tense. Clint looked over a mirror at the others. "What happened?" He asked curtly.
Their footsteps echoed in the garage as the three got out and headed for the entrance to the building.
Steve raised his hands as Rhodey's gun was aimed directly at him. He swallowed. "I'm afraid I completely underestimated it."
A dog barked in the apartment to her right and the three went straight on. A staircase led upstairs, there was no elevator.
Her eyes fell on all the technical devices behind him. She was right. He could have finished it. But there was an even better way.
"I'll stay here too," Rhodey said, but Tony looked at him dumbfounded. The man was most likely to need a bed, he was about to say, but his friend interrupted him. "I do not feel the legs down anymore. I don’t need to take a big bed, the sofa is enough for me."
Steve could still remember the big shadow that had suddenly darkened the whole environment. Just then did they look up and saw the danger: The grey floor of the huge plane had a threatening effect. Slowly the ship had pushed through the afternoon sky; Steve had wondered why no one had seen it, but there was no time to think about the question. As fast as they could, the group had suited up with their partially badly repaired or even newly made armour and somehow Falcon had managed to transport them all gradually to the ship.
On them was a large weight that restricted all movement and only at second glance, he could see that they were spilt by sand and debris.
Carefully and with watery eyes, he tried to turn his head. It worked to the left, but when he turned the right side the stinging pain passed through him again. He put his head back on the sand and rested.
solve it by freezing all in self-pity or choosing to go all alone. Or stir up hostilities that nobody wants to have."
"It should be a tunnel system," Clint explained again. The video was closed, and Tony's plans of his suit covered the entire screen again. "But not a natural tunnel system. At least it was never known before. Nearby, there are no cabins or houses where they could be and all possible tracks were blurred by the storm. We have nothing. The signal was sent out three days ago but was received as I said only a few hours ago by SHIELD. They just sent it to us. They could be everywhere again."
Steve drew in a sharp breath and said in a low steady tone against Tony’s ear, hot breath burning against the sensitive skin, “The tall Alpha with red hair wearing a blue tie and the shorter Alpha with dark hair, wearing a green turtleneck with his dark suit. I wanted to
Turning, Tony leaned into his touch, nuzzled his face against Steve’s hand. He pushed forward, pushed nearer, wanting to brush his cheek against Steve’s own, the way he always did.
“Tony, you’re alright. You’re fine,” Steve said, trying to sound reassuring. “You’re a little dried out from staying out of the water too long. Do you want to go into your glass?”
Steve wasn’t used to the courting methods of the modern day, where there wasn’t necessarily any formal declarations of intent, of how serious the courting would be. So he had declared his intent in the only way he knew how for a situation like this. After Tony flipped through the pages, there would be no denying Steve’s feelings and how seriously he was taking this.
Natasha made a face and explained, “The two of them kept bickering so I think the alien sorcerer was offended that they weren’t taking him seriously enough.”
Tony sounded genuinely surprised that he wasn’t somehow able to consider every possible type of technology a week into his research on human tech.
Tony sobbed at the wet pleasure snaking into him, clenching heat washing through him as Steve ate him out thoroughly. Steve pulled out, causing Tony to whimper in the back of his throat, but Steve was only taking the time to lick around Tony’s opening, catching any dripping slick sliding out. Tony felt his hole clench with want, felt more slick dribble out as his arousal pulsed higher.
I seriously considered writing some kind of rose ceremony ala the Bachelor but I couldn’t do it, lol. So, this is my first a/b/o fic, and I was pretty worried throughout if I actually gave it enough a/b/o elements. I read the genre, but I never thought I would write it because I lack confidence in making it a satisfying read. The original prompt asked for no explicit smut, which is why I couldn't lean on that. I hope this was a satisfying a/b/o courtship read in any case!
On one such day, Steve finally decided to tackle some paperwork which he had procrastinated on for weeks now. It was tedious and boring work, but the bright sunlight shining through the wide windows by his desk warmed him, and he fell into a steady dull rhythm.
Tony called the two little bots DUM-E and U, which was a sign that even geniuses had their limits and in Tony’s case, he was very much not a genius at naming things. They were about eight inches tall, and they mostly consisted of wheels and a jointed arm each. Tony seemed to spend just as much time berating them as actually having them help. They seemed to be able to understand Tony’s high pitched squeaks and clicks, arms drooping or perking up accordingly. Steve felt absurdly charmed by the little bots, often feeling a pang of sympathy for DUM-E who seemed to be the one prone to accidents.
Steve tapped the off button on the television’s remote control and left it at the foot of the bed. He turned around and crawled forward, knowing he was letting himself be manipulated by Tony’s unsubtle machinations. Grinning, Tony reclined back until Steve crawled right up over him, arms by Tony’s shoulders so that he was hovering just over Tony now.
Fortunately, Steve’s other hand was already hovering beneath Tony, predicting the accident from the way Tony couldn’t keep still. The top quarter of the plastic bag folded over and Tony tipped out straight onto Steve’s hand. Tony wriggled around until he flopped onto his back, blinking up at Steve as he leaned back against Steve’s fingers, his bright fins draped over his wrist.
Tony murmured. But he clasped Steve’s hand and tugged him deeper into the welcoming currents, into the endless blue seas ahead of them.
“Next time, we take one of my cars.” Tony takes a baseball cap from Steve’s outstretched hand and adjusts it on his head. “Or I’m flying us to one of my islands.”
Coming back to bed, Steve leaned over Tony, brushing his hair back and meeting his gaze. Whatever he saw, it was clear he realized that Tony’s heat was over. He smiled tenderly. “You feel okay?”
bed,” Tony complained, crossing his arms in a sulk. The blue throw slipped off one shoulder and Steve had to wonder if that was on purpose, even as he eyes were drawn helplessly to the dip of Tony’s clavicle, to the elegant lines of Tony’s shoulder.
Steve took a step back. It wasn’t vigorous shaking, just the occasional random thumps that moved the box, like something inside was trying to get out. Maybe there was a very small puppy in the box? God, Steve wished it was a very small puppy. But he could guess who this present was from and that maniac didn’t give small puppies as presents, not unless those small puppies would also morph into giant acid-spitting wolves later on.
Steve leans forward and gently kisses Tony’s nose, sweeping black locks away from his slightly sweaty forehead.
Steve trotted after Tony only to earn another hiss from him. Not that it was enough to deter Steve. Now, Steve stuck to Tony’s side as they both explored the hall. Bucky watched in amusement as the two pretended to ignore each other while moving around the hall at each other’s side. Occasionally, Tony’s curiosity seemed to get the better of him and he would move to explore in more detail, wanting to stick his little face into nooks and crannies. But Steve would let out that loud echoing bark which would make Tony stalk away, looking affronted.
Somehow, Nat had been able to get the access codes to Tony’s office, but she was too caught up with the work Miss Potts had her doing, so Steve had to go in her place. Steve wasn’t keen because while he was good at frontal attacks and military strategy, spywork and sneaking around wasn’t his strong point at all. But needs must.
Tony preened at those words, glorying in how Steve thought he smelled amazing, relishing the idea that Steve loved his scent so much that he seemed to be losing control.
“I can talk,” Tony said, as if testing the words. Then he looked down at his legs. “And I have legs! Oh sweet anemones, I can walk and talk!”
While Steve had received a large sum for his backpay, being on the run after the Accords had eaten into that. They weren’t penniless or hungry, but he didn’t exactly have a lot of spare cash to throw around.
Chased by a sense of unease, Steve waded out of the water and started his usual routine when Tony came down to the beach with him, keeping his morning jog to the beach.
Steve smiled. Of course Tony wouldn’t want his research time to be taken up by any travelling time. “It’s why I’ve ordered an Alltab. It’s a tablet that works under water.”
And he probably was right: Steve probably had burned himself. But his superserum healing handled minor burns like that in less than a minute. Other than the sticky residue leftover from the spilled coffee, his skin was fine again, and whatever redness resulting from the heat was already gone.
Steve shook his head and said, “You don’t have to pay me in pearls, I’m sure you’re not going to cost me this much.”
It didn’t help that he couldn’t seem to stop thinking, ‘Gosh, he’s so cute’ over and over again, which probably meant his common sense was at an all time low at this point. But the little half-fish-person really was incredibly cute, with his small frowning face and his tiny hands.
The attacker was short, with dark brown hair and wild eyes. He was smart enough to keep his body almost entirely hidden behind Tony, not providing any line of sight for any attacks from the front. He kept his back to the wall of the cafe, preventing any sneak attacks.
“I want him to pay,” screamed the man, voice wobbling with fury and emotion. “This is all his fault, and I want the world to see it.”
But Steve’s shield was already slicing through the air and it slammed into the attacker’s shoulder with enough force to send him toppling over. He was out for the count by the time he hit the ground.
“Amber is not going anywhere near any battle,” Tony said firmly. “She’s too small. What if someone harmed her?”
T’Challa shook his head sharply. “Look at me, not my feet. If you look at my feet, you will step on them instead of avoiding them. Talk to me about something. How has the ceremony been for you?”
Apparently dragons didn’t have names, not the way humans did, but Tony still maintained they had to call her something, so he settled for Amber. It was probably the most sensible name that Tony had ever come up with in his whole life. Steve was almost disturbed by that.
Steve wanted so badly to ask if Tony felt the same, especially after he had bared his feelings so completely to him. But that wasn’t how this Courting Ceremony worked; he couldn’t ask Tony to tell him now. And he wasn’t sure if he wanted an answer now, if he could deal with a rejection while they were swaying together to the music, arms holding each other, faces close together in intimate conversation. Let this moment last instead, let Steve have this moment before he had to accept reality, before he found out which path his future was to take by the end of the night.
That seemed to break Tony out of his surprise at least, since he rolled his eyes. “You know what I mean.”
Tony tugged Steve to the recessed living area and towards a couch, saying, “Hey, F.R.I.D.A.Y., mute all incoming calls please unless it’s a Godzilla level emergency.” He shot Steve a wry look. “Happy is going to be blowing up my phone with complaints that I just bailed out of my own Courting Ceremony and left him to get rid of the guests.”
Steve drew a deep breath, trying to take his advice. He forced his shoulders to drop and said, “It’s fine. I’m alright.”
my dad debut an upgraded car in your era?” Tony crosses his arms over his chest. “It wouldn’t have been any different if you had let me-”
Thor leaned in. “It was explained to me that this is a ritual to earn your favor. I have always thought we would be most compatible in carnal matters.”
Even though it should have been obvious, Steve’s focus on everything else to do with the event meant that he had not realized until this point in time that everyone thought he was just here as one of Tony’s guests, present like any other Avenger to support his friend.
Steve never stopped blushing when he got a cheek kiss and Tony never stopped looking disproportionately smug and amused at that.
Steve let out a deep breath. So, he was in. He had passed. And in another week, it would be time for the Courting Ceremony.
“Tony, I am here with a gift,” Thor said, throwing his cape back dramatically to reveal a large box.
This time, when discussions were ongoing, Tony and Steve stayed in the room. Shuri was already working on the Mind stone and on Vision, with Wanda in the same room to hold Vision’s hand or something equally sappy.
Sam said with raised eyebrows, “Wait, back in the old timey days, wasn’t bonding during heat also about having sex for the first time during heat? Wasn’t that the whole point? Are you guys telling me you aren’t having sex, because I don’t believe it.”
. But not just Kenny. There were always young and sexy Omegas interested in Steve, because Steve was painfully attractive, eye-searingly gorgeous even, but worse than that: Steve was a genuinely good person. He was funny and wry and bad-tempered, and underneath it all, just so good. He had his pick of Omegas, all young and beautiful and with more than Tony could give.
He looked up to realize that he had been divested of all his clothing, except for his briefs, still riding high on his hips. They were clinging to him, showing wet marks in the front and in the back. Steve was staring down at the slip of red cloth, breathing heavily, like this was taking a great amount of concentration. He touched a hand to the front of Tony’s damp briefs, nudging Tony’s obscenely hard cock. The touch was electric, and Tony arched, cried out. He started pushing at his briefs, trying desperately to get them off. Steve helped with his large clever hands, pulling the red cloth down Tony’s long legs, kissing the curve of Tony’s calves as he went because he was just a complete weirdo sometimes.
It was enough to spark a surge of satisfaction in Tony and he curled a hand around Steve’s neck, ran his fingers through the fine hair at the nape. He breathed out, “My Steve.”
Bucky mentions Steve not having gone to a Courting Ceremony before back in Chapter 1, in case anyone wonders where that came from. :)
Steve stepped forward, well into Ty’s personal space. But to give credit to Ty’s courage, or possibly his stupidity, he stood his ground and didn’t move, even though he swallowed involuntarily. Steve and Ty were about the same height, and at a glance, they looked superficially alike, with the blond hair and blue eyes. But where Steve’s expression was hard, with eyes flinty from fury, Ty’s was a sneering mask, with his eyes darting down to Steve’s arms in a way that gave away his fear. They might be close in height, but Steve was much broader, his hard muscles visible even through his tailored suit.
“I can’t believe no one called me immediately and I had to find out from the army that Tones has been turned into a
Then he startled again as his hand and the front of his shirt were suddenly drenched in scalding hot liquid.
“I’m going to use technology to clean the ocean. It’s full of two-legs’ garbage nowadays, too much for magic to deal with, not without a great cost. But tech? Tech is perfect for it. All we need is advanced machinery and money. And I can get both.”
Steve let the water run over his body, trying to wash away his anxious pheromones. This was not what he wanted to be smelling like when he walked into the ceremony hall.
Tony lapsed into a short silence at that, eyes watching Steve thoughtfully from behind his mask. They danced to the melodic instrumental music, moving easily with the throngs of other masked dancers with Tony leading the way. For the moment, Steve savored how he had his arms almost completely around Tony, how they were pressed up-close, moving gently to the music, Tony’s scent mixing with his own. Steve wanted to pull Tony close and bury his face in that neck, breathe in deep. But he was happy with what he had as well. Tonight, he was happy here, swaying with Tony to the music.
That was it. Steve just had to do his best to make Tony happy, and in the end, the decision was in Tony’s hands.
Steve ran soothing hands up and down Tony’s sides and then said with intense need, “I want to see you.”
Tony could feel himself shaking, his heart pounding as he clasped a hand over his mouth, trying to keep in the sob, but his shaky inhalation sounded loud to his own ears. So weak and pathetic… “Don’t you want me anymore?” he cried, muffled, into his hand.
Steve asked, a little quietly even as his hand tightened inadvertently on Tony’s, “So there was no other reason you held the Courting Ceremony?”
He met both their shocked stares to show he was deadly serious and that this wasn’t a threat made lightly. When they stepped back, both wide-eyed at his venom and a little afraid of the promise he was making, he smiled with satisfaction and started to turn away. Then he turned back to them and added, “And I also much prefer my partners to be honorable, stoic, stupendously moralistic assholes by the name of Steve Rogers. With a massive knot. Seriously, it’s such a huge knot, you would not believe it unless you saw it. None of you could possibly come close to measuring up.”
Wanda found them next, dressed in a deep green thigh-length dress. “We almost got mobbed out there.”
He thought it because he knew it was true. Tony was a genius and he noticed things, he knew Steve didn’t even care he was in heat.
He listened to the sound of the waves and enjoyed the warmth of sunlight against his skin, just like any other morning.
Then they came together again, soft and full of joy and love until their bodies sang out for them to join in a more carnal way.
Steve gritted his teeth and stepped away to put the drink down on the coffee table. He caught Nat’s sympathetic gaze and decided he needed some time with a punching bag. Purely for training’s sake.
“I know it’s weird alright, shut up, we don’t have to talk about this,” Tony said with a hard glare upwards.
The scent was intoxicating and Steve couldn’t help but press his lips against Tony’s pulsepoint, resting his mouth there as he felt that heartbeat against his skin and inhaled their entwined scents deep into his lungs.
She was a small dragon, smaller than the smallest one that they had seen flying around outside. Maybe she had hidden right from the start, because Steve never saw her, not until the moment he heard Tony gasp and he had come running out of the kitchen to see Tony with a dragon the size of a large cat curled up in his arms.
“You’re late,” Steve said through gritted teeth, still feeling the fear sour in the back of his throat. He bent down stiffly, holding the opaque plastic bag in the water so Tony could swim into it.
Steve had to choke down a laugh at the casual arrogance. But was it arrogant if Tony really was a genius of unusual proportions of intelligence?
Over the next couple days, Steve had let go of the idea that this was a hallucination. It was too strange to be a hallucination.
Then Steve’s fingers were gone and Tony was going to protest when nothing happened immediately except he heard the sound of the wet slide of skin against skin. He turned his head to the side, craning, until he saw Steve running his wet palm over his cock. Oh god… he had used Tony’s slick on his own cock. The thought and sight made Tony throb, made his hole clench with want. Steve met his rapacious gaze and drew his hand slowly down his hard length, parting his own legs so Tony could better see how his pants, only unbuttoned and unzipped, strained around his thick thighs. His thick cock was wet with Tony’s slick and Steve’s own precome, standing out proud from the open pants, peeking out from between Steve’s large hands.
Was that what zumba was?? Steve had overheard a few S.H.I.E.L.D. agents talking about taking zumba classes, how difficult they were and how they helped so much for their training in S.H.I.E.L.D.. He thought it was some kind of martial arts! It sounded like one too.
Steve turned away from the window, straightening up from where he had been leaning against the quinjet’s inner hull wall and smiled. “That wasn’t what I was worried about.”
“Oh, do you have something in mind? We have a lot of new Courting promotions going on right now. We have the Prince & Princess line, the Earth series, and also our own personalized Scentears.”
“That would be a good idea,” Steve said inanely, trying not to stare at Tony’s face, at the quirk of his lips. But then his eyes shifted to the overly large shirt Tony was wearing — he was wearing
Steve moved forward at the press of Tony’s hand, breathing shallowly when he noticed Tony drawing closer too. Soft pink lips framed by neatly shaved facial hair parted, drawing Steve’s gaze down until he couldn’t look anywhere else as he leaned in and in until…
“Just to lie down.” Tony turned and ran a hand over Steve’s bare chest, content that this wide beautiful expanse was his, all his.
Steve didn’t exactly make every part of the Scentears earrings by hand. For one, he had no idea how to work with metal and turn it into fine DUM-E and U-shaped earrings. But when he had turned up for the very pricey scentears course, they had a little machine that could make whatever shapes you wanted out of metal, as long as you drew out the parts you wanted and designed how they fit together. Steve had fun with that machine once he had figured it out, carefully working it so that he could create moving joints for the earrings. Then he had made the scent himself, guided by the tutor there, who had listened with bafflement as he had described what he wanted.
“Oh god, I’m such a fucked up pervert,” Tony said, looking away, before admitting, “I want you to fuck me.”
It was unusual because typically, Steve was the one who had to push Tony to come along with him. He was frequently worried that Tony cooped himself up all day indoors, never seeing sunlight that wasn’t filtered through windows. Steve had tried to institute daily morning swims in the sea to which Tony had bargained it down to morning swims every three days. It tended to be less than that because sometimes Tony got stuck into work right after breakfast and refused to go out.
In that hour, an alien spaceship had apparently entered Earth above New York and a few aliens had descended to demand the Time stone and the Mind stone. A huge fight had broken out in the streets of New York, which somehow resulted in...whatever the fuck this was.
“Okay, good,” Tony said with a faint flush to his cheeks. “That’s, uh, good to know. It’s serious...for me too. Just so you know.”
The reference obviously made sense to some, since there was a smattering of laughter, but Steve had only heard about Pokemon in passing before without knowing what it meant, so the joke went over his head. But he didn’t care. He didn’t care if he didn’t understand anything else for the rest of the night, as long as he got to hear who Tony was choosing.
On one hand, Tony’s warm concern was so sweet, Steve felt like he was melting on the inside, like gooey caramel on a hot day. On the other hand, now Tony had the completely wrong idea and Steve felt like the worst scum to have that level of misplaced concern directed at him.
“Don’t get attached. We might have to use lethal force to take them down,” Steve pointed out. Already, one of the larger dragons had spouted fire in the direction of another dragon. The only positive was that the dragons seemed to be flying erratically, not really coordinating any attack on the people on the ground or in the buildings.
Everyone had to send in their gifts before the Courting Ceremony to be scanned by F.R.I.D.A.Y. for any hidden dangers. It also meant no one had to awkwardly carry around the heavier gifts with them. Steve took the large box and stepped onto stage. He could do this.
“Just lie down?” Steve asked, even as he climbed over Tony, stopping briefly to press a kiss to his cheek, before reclining beside Tony.
Okay, it was pretty amazing to have a real dragon hanging around the Avengers tower, to see her fly through the air and snap her wings out to slow her descent, landing with care on Tony’s shoulder.
F.R.I.D.A.Y. must have responded directly into Tony’s earpiece, because after a short pause, he said with some incredulity, “You’re not on the approved list. Are you actually crashing my party here?”
Stark lightly touched Steve’s hand with two fingers, which really, it was just two fingers, why was Steve holding his breath? “Hmm… If you say so.” Those dark eyes were so intense when they looked up at Steve that it was hard for Steve to remember to breathe again. Then Stark continued, “But your shirt is all ruined anyway. I don’t think you can go back to work like this.”
Steve felt a light touch against his shoulder and he turned to see Tony, back in his merman form with his brilliant red and gold scales. He looked down and was glad to see the glowing arc reactor was in place in Tony’s chest to replace the one sacrificed for the spell.
Shaking his head, Parker just waved his hand, biting the inside of his cheek to keep from hissing out. "It's n-" Peter grunted, "-othing." Although the Avenger couldn't see it, he was sure Deadpool was raising a sassy eyebrow. Peter's eyes replicated the size of saucers, shit, he didn't have his mask on! Swallowing the saliva building up in his mouth, Peter Parker only prayed that Wade wouldn't go spilling his 'Spider-Man Secret' around town, though, Deadpool doesn't seem to be the type of person to do something like that. But, you never know. Just because a person doesn't look it, doesn't mean they aren't.
"Now, Flash," Jacoby turned to the student who seemed like he refused to leave his side, "Please repeat what I have told you outside, and explain the rules for those who don't know, while I get the materials." he smiled a thin line down at the boy before walking off towards the supply closet, opposite end of the gym.
Duffel bag tight around his hand, the brunette walked towards the Avenger's Tower, trying his best to keep warm in the cold weather of December.
He wanted to just sit down and laugh happily over a stupid joke that May heard during her shift at the hospital. He wanted to laugh --
With that, the auburn haired girl dipped her head with a small smile on her face, signalling that the doctor could continue. Nodding his head, Bruce slowly began to lift the shirt off of the comatose teen. Clint's eyes landed upon his torn up binder. "Jesus, and he wears that everyday?" he questioned towards Natasha.
Rolling his eyes under his mask, Wade grumbled mentally at himself, causing Peter to turn his head. "Thank you, Wade." Peter said sincerely, stepping over a piece of paper and sitting down gently on the couch, wincing audibly at the binder he kept on.
"You planned this out very carefully, you know that, Peter?" Natasha smiled softly, amusement clear in her facial expression.
Sure, it hurt like hell, but at that moment, Peter could have cared less. His mind fluttered back to the conversation that he had with Death and Hel, and he sighed gratefully.
After finally shaking off Wade, he reentered his bedroom, taking off his Spider-Man mask and suit. Stretching he plopped himself on his bed, grinning at how comfortable the mattress was. He must have dozed off, because the next thing he knows Aunt May is shaken him awake with a strong arm.
Tony placed a hand on his shoulder, gripping it tight as they walked to Aunt May's room. Nearly choking on his own breath, Parker pushed back the glass door that blocked him from his aunt. He was now able to see her much clearer now.
Laughing to himself, Peter Parker shook his head with a smile on his face. Out of all the things he was thankful for, he was probably most grateful for his makeshift family. Sure, it wasn't perfect, but it was family. And for that, he couldn't have been happier.
“Hey, Peter, my name’s Steve Rogers, you would know me best as Captain America.” Rogers said, walking up to the brown haired boy and held his head out to him.
Raising an eyebrow, the female hero took the dark purple and red box. The package itself was beautiful, but the item inside was even
"That's not very gentlemanly of you." a soft voice spoke. Nearly jumping onto the ceiling, Parker whipped his head towards the unknown guest.
"Ugh, yes, could you point us to the men's section?" Romanoff asked politely. Nodding her head eagerly, 'Amber' pointed her finger behind her and towards the right.
Loki sighed. He knew what Parker meant. After trying to take over New York a couple years back, he returned to Asgard, facing his punishment there, and as he walked down that dreaded isle, all he could see was the anger on Odin's face.
"Sorry, Pete, but I'm warn out, we've been cooking all day." Nat spoke up, Wanda nodding sadly in agreement. If she would, she would help the poor teenage boy in a heartbeat, but she was quite exhausted.
"My father does not really concern this subject, but if you would like to know, I shall tell you, dear mortal. My father is Loki, the god of mischief." Peter's eyes widen. "My father has heard good stories about you, from his brother who watches over the so called 'Avengers'. Come to think of it, I'm not sure you have met him yet." Peter shook his head, his throat running dry. His heart began to beat faster and faster, sweat droplets appearing on his forehead.
Still, the old woman protested. "Listen here lady, I'm in charge of this station, and what happens back here is under my supervision -- meaning I'm the boss. If I say
Sam wanted to go and talk to the two boys, but Rhodey placed a hand on his shoulder, stopping him. Looking towards the other male, the older just shook his head, almost as if he was saying 'not yet'. Understanding to an extent, Sam remained still.
"Peter," Natasha spoke loudly, pulling him out of his thoughts. "Breathe, try to breathe. Please, Peter, try to. For me."
xX Please mind the spelling errors, this is unedited for now until further notice. Also, sorry for the boring chapter.. >~< Xx
“It’s just..” the boy sighed, throwing a random pair of pants on the bed before walking over towards Aunt May, sitting down besides her. “What if I screw everything up?”
Wade agreed silently, seemingly lost in the boy in front of him. "W-Wade..?" Peter stuttered out, probably without his own consent. Snapping out of his thoughts, Wilson realized how close they were. They were right together, face to face,
Turning on the light, he walked over under the sink, pulling out a worn out purple bag. Once untying that, he pulled out his Packer, placing it in the new black bag, only finding the bag to be a couple inches wider.
"Hun, I'm a high level trained assassin, I pick up things most people don't usual get." she smiled with pursed lips.
"Why--" Peter's voice cracked. Damn, it was time for his shot. Clearing his throat, a blush on his cheeks, he restarted his sentence. "Why did you send the both of them?"
"I'm here to free Bruce Banner and Clint Barton." Natasha spoke to the woman behind the counter. Nodding her head, the lady started typing into her computer before standing up. Grabbing a set of keys, the woman led Romanoff to the holding cell.
So sorry if Wanda is out of character in this, and/or if this seemed very weird for the character. I tried my best, but lately, I haven't been in the mood to write for this book. But, I'm going to keep updating whenever I can. :)
Tony shook his head. "You don't know that. For all we know, we could have just seen MJ's killer, but we didn't because the camera was facing the fucking
Nodding, Peter picked up his bags and turned towards Mr. Stark who was leaning on the doorframe watching the scene go down. For a moment, Peter could have sworn he saw remorse flash across his eyes. But as quick as it was there, it was gone.
All the young boy wanted to see was Aunt May opening his door with a smile on his face, telling him that dinner was almost ready and that she was making his favourite; spaghetti.
"Mr. Parker, sir. Mr. Stark has ordered to tell me that dinner will be in five minutes." a voice spoke from out of nowhere. Jumping nearly a half a foot, he shot his head up and looked around the room. When he found no one there, he furrowed his eyebrows.
Bruce, bless the man, cleared his throat, snapping the team out of their daze. And then, they set to work, all hovering over in a group to see Stark's every movement.
Slipping on his underwear, he pulled them up to say the rested on his hips. Grabbing the Packer, (that he had to take back out of the bag because he realized that he didn’t have an extra), he positioned the realistic looking penis in the pants, making sure it didn’t look like he had a boner the entire day. ‘Never again’ he thought to himself as a shudder when down his spine.
"Peter," Wade spoke, ignoring the boxes, as he helped the boy to the couch, sweat shining from his forehead as his breath became ragged. "What the hell? Shouldn't you be getting fixed up by doctor Hulk?" Parker pulled down his hood, suddenly getting too hot in the thick material. Wade took a sharp intake of air, eyes widening to the size of saucers.
Turning to the side, he looked at his slight bump, frowning. Turning to the other side, he expected it to be totally different, but to his misfortune, it was just like the same on the first side. Frowning even deeper, he then face the mirror, and tugged at the hoodie. Looking down, he nearly whined aloud. Getting frustrated, he stripped of the red thing, throwing it on the bathroom counter near the sink.
. At the moment, Peter was stationed on one of his go to rooftops -- the one Deadpool and him always seemed to meet at.
"Hey, Peter." Natasha smiled softly. Closing the door gently behind her, she made her way over towards the still slightly red faced boy.
"So, when are we eating? Because, I don't know about you, but I'm starving." he smiled under his mask, though no one could see it -- but the smile was clear and evident in his voice as he joke around, somewhat seriously. Parker chuckled under his breath before answering.
Repeating the steps from last time, Peter clicked out of those messages and clicked the one from the unknown number.
Placing the needle and thread on his lap, the mercenary opened the packet and took out the wipe with his clothed hands. Facing Parker, Wade carefully cleaned the opened cuts, which earned a wince from the younger. "I'm sorry, baby boy.." he whispered under his breath. Peter's heart thumped against his rib cage, his eyes shut tightly as Wade picked up the needle. "I really wish I didn't have to do this."
"Morning, mom." he smiled back as he sat on one of the barstools on the counter. "Whatever you're making smells delicious."
"Hey," Peter greeted back warmly. Walking over to the fruit bowl, he grabbed an apple and sat down in the seat he was sitting in last night; Thor's chair. Speaking of Thor, Peter has yet to meet him.
The billionaire continued to watch as the screen intensely as both Nat and Clint made their way to what seemed like the lab, both holding up a comatose Spider-Man.
Currently, they were at a special store -- that Clint has now forgotten the name of -- trying to find  Peter a binder that fit, using the measurements Nat gave them. "For the last time, Clint, no." Banner huffed, crossing his arms to show the Avengers that he was serious.
"I know this is the men's changing room. I am only going into my respective gender's changing room."
Peter's ears rang as he stayed stationed on his small bed. He was currently at Aunt May's. He was staying there until the landlord finally sold it to another person -- or persons. Mr Stark knew he would be staying there, and even offered Peter to stay there with him. But, of course, Parker declined.
Peter cracked a smile at this. Maybe he wasn't breaking their usual order after all. "So, Peter. How's school?" Bruce questioned, trying his best to make small talk, unlike the rest of the surrounding people -- they would rather just observe. The young, fragile boy almost dropped his fork onto the plate.
"Clint, call Bruce and tell him that we're bringing someone in who is seriously injured and needs medical attention right away. Don't let them know it's Peter -- and do
"What's wrong?" Steve questioned, looking up from his lap and directing his attention towards the electronic.
Parker didn't speak for a moment. He sort of zoned out. His breathing made no progress of slowing down, either. "Because I'm a disgrace."
May would shake her head and grab a rag, wiping it off of her husband's skin, playfully scolding him while doing so. Peter would watch the interaction with pure admiration in his eyes, hoping one day that he could find someone to care for him like Aunt May does for Uncle Ben.
"Afraid not," she spoke sadly, a playful frown on her face. Loki sighed in the same tone, a small smirk threatening to appear.
Romanoff shook her head again, letting out a few more small laughs. "It's just your such an easy target, kid." she smiled before blinking a couple of times, then looking over at Peter. "But it's not what you did wrong, it's what I simply observed. Believe me, it took me a while to figure it out. The way you slouch over is a strong hint. Or the way that you pull at your shirt covering your chest area when you think no one is looking. Maybe it's the -- "
Walking over and putting the objects on the table, Wade turned around and pulled his lover into his chest. Peter smiled warmly as he wrapped his arms around Wade's middle, pulling him even closer.
"Hey, Spidey, what's wrong? Are you hurt?" Wade fired questions suddenly, his voice laced with both concern and worry.
Once reaching his room, he closed and locked the door. Leaning up against the door, he took a breath, closed his eyes, and counted to ten, just like Aunt May had told him to do.
"Really now?" Peter raised an eyebrow, not being able to stop the grin that was on his face. Wade chuckled under his breath as he lifted up his mask slightly and bent down to capture Spider-Man's lips. Eyes fluttering closed, Peter smiled softly against the kiss as Wade nibbled slightly at Parker's bottom lip. Allowing entrance, Peter sighed softly under the touch as he gave up the fight for dominance and let Deadpool explore his mouth like a cavern. The two continued their, wrapped in each others presence, that they didn't even hear a person enter the room, that is until they clear their throat. Eyes widening, Peter pulled away and dark red blush splash across his face. Wade only grumbled under his breath before pulling down his mask and turning towards the person who disturbed their little moment.
Wanda's eyes widened and her throat began to close up slightly. "Oh, uh, nothing! Nothing! Just, uh, a gift is all.."
“One of the most amazing scientist known to human race? I’ve read almost all of your works, and I found them very interesting, ecspecially the one about--”
Peter simply watched as they placed two metal things upon her bare chest, and he watched as her body jolted upwards, but her heart monitor stayed the same -- lifeless. Peter screamed, his voice echoing the hallways of the building, grabbing the attention of many staff members and patients.
"A-Aunt May?" Peter called as he felt hands wrap around his midsection. Doctors and nurses began to flood the room, all shouting different things at each other -- but the young hero didn't hear. Tony tried his best to pull him out of the hospital room, but that was a mission itself. With his super strength, it was nearly impossible. "Aunt May!" he shouted as he tried his best to run towards her.
Taking a deep breath, Peter inhaled through his nose and exhaled through his mouth, just like Aunt May had said when he needed to calm down and stop an oncoming panic attack. Then, Peter Parker told Wade everything. From all the bullying at his school, his uncle Ben, his wide range of disorders, how he was staying with The Avengers, his depression, and finally, him being transgender. At the end of it all, Peter was holding back tears at the strong silence that made its way over and between the two. Suddenly, Wade stood up, and the young boy thought he was going to loose it. 'What if he doesn't like me anymore?' 'What if he thinks I'm disgusting?' 'What if he thinks I'm a disgrace?' 'What if--'
I would like to apologize sincerely for the lack of uploads. During summer break, my family has been taking trip after trip -- and now that school is starting, (I'm getting ready to start my second week into the school year), it's just kicking my ass. Between making Instagram updates, working on my multiple books, and schoolwork, I am hella stressed out (and not the top song).
Exiting the mall with pure anger written over her face, Natasha unlocked the car and carefully placed the bags of clothing into the car. Closing the trunk with a slam, Peter jumped slightly from the noise. Quickly apologizing, Natasha got into her side of the car and closed the door; Parker doing the same thing on the passenger side. Both of them buckled up. Pulling out of the driveway, Peter got lost in thought as Natasha continued to drive, her knuckles white from how tight she was gripping the steering wheel.
"Please, Ms Ainsley, this is my home!" Peter begged his landlord. They've been discussing this matter for approximately five minutes and fourteen seconds. The young hero was running out of energy -- and fast too. "This is where I grew up -- this place has all of my memories! All that's left of Uncle Ben and Aunt May!"
"He did?" Romanoff raised an eyebrow, giving a side glance to the young hero. Eyes going wide, Peter tried to correct himself.
"I agree with Nat," Clint sighed, running a hand over his face, a coffee pot filled with to the brim with said coffee in his hand. "This isn't healthy for them. Peter's lost so much already -- his uncle, aunt, mom, dad...
"You can't go in there. It's says men's changing room, not girl's." she spoke from her spot, pointing up to the men's sign that was hanging above the young boy's head. Natasha raised an eyebrow at the old woman's bluntness. She was about to speak up when Peter interrupted her, trying not to start the fight that was threatening to break out.
I would like to also apologize for how short this chapter is. I just felt super bad for not giving you all anything after weeks -- and I know this is shitty, but still. Again, I'm sorry for disappointing you.
Steve wasn't sure if he was supposed to hear that or not, so he simply ignored it. Instead, he looked back towards the screen, a smile on his face.
The AI was reluctant, but did what he was asked. "As you wish." Opening the window, the young teen retreated down the side of the tall tower.
Peter stopped dead in his tracks, eyes wide as he looked into the kitchen where his loving boyfriend, and part time merc, Deadpool was standing, his mask long and forgotten. "H-Happy Valentine's Da--"
Once the turkey was in the oven, Natasha began working on the mash potatoes. Pulling out a cutting board, the Avenger also pulled out two bags of large potatoes. Sighing, Romanoff poured all of the potatoes into a very big bowl, and began to wash each of them carefully -- but quickly at the same time. Once that was finished, Nat skinned the potatoes, Peter helping her out as the stuffing was cooking. After what seemed to take forever, the potatoes were finally peeled. Instead of cutting them up smaller, then smashing them, Natasha just muttered a small 'fuck it' and threw them back into the bowl, taking the potato masher and smashed them together.
Parker gulped. He nodded his head before bringing his knees up to his chest; trying his best to hide the soft lumps in his hoodie. "Sorry, Nat.." he whispered out an apology. Natasha shook her head.
"I honestly don't know what that means, but, I like-like you." Peter answered honestly, causing Wade to gasp. Peter chuckled, positioning his hands to where they hooked around Wade's neck.
With that, the doors opened and Loki stepped out. Eyebrows still knitted together, he quickly followed after the demi-god, and, some might say, he walked with his head held high.
Sharing a glance, both Avenger's laughed loudly, tears forming in their eyes. Pulling into the mall center, Natasha turned down the radio, shaking her head as the song came to an end. Peter quickly wiped the tears in his eyes -- all from laughing to much. Once they parked in a close by parking spot, the two got out of the car, locking it behind them. "That was fun," Peter commented. "I didn't know you had this side to you. Mr Stark always made you out to be some kind of emotionless war hero."
"You better hurry that sweet ass of yours, Spidey." Deadpool whined, bouncing up and down in the same place. Peter rolled his eyes, throwing on his blue and red beanie. Huffing, Parker walked out of Wade's bedroom and looked up to the male.
"So we all know that Peter is going after Michelle's killer, correct? Correct." Tony spoke, his hands wrapped around a giant coffee mug that was half coffee and half something a little bit stronger.
Stark sighed, turning back and rubbing his face worriedly. "He wouldn't listen to any of us. No one understands the situation enough, plus, add the other
Shortly after that was finished, he took the towel that was on the back of his neck and began to dry his hair with it, only after turning around so he couldn't see his anatomical errors. Once his hair was nearly dry, he placed the towel to the side and began to dress himself. Picking up the new binder (courtesy of Natasha, Bruce, and Clint), he stared down at it, running his thumbs over the soft material of it all. Thinking for a moment, he decided to do something daring. Placing the chest-reducing material back down, he picked up his tight tank top and placed it on, his large hoodie following shortly after. Sliding on his boxers, he placed his packer in properly before sliding on his sweats.
Parker, however, was making something a little more time consuming. His 'project', so to speak, was mincemeat pie. Though, it was mostly served during Christmas, Peter couldn't resist, seeing it was one of his all time favourites -- beside the turkey and all the different kinds of pie. Grabbing, yet another, bowl, Peter emptied the meat, pecans, apples, figs, brown sugar, lemon peels, and a touch of brandy. Stirring it all together, Peter set it aside into the fridge. While that set, Parker began to work on the fruit salad. Taking different kinds of fruits (kiwi, strawberry, grapes, etc.), the male began to work.
think of that again, baby boy. You are worth every penny, every second, every bruise, and every fucking thing in the
, person would never tell someone something without the original person's consent. So don't you ever think that I would tell someone something without your permission to do so. The only exception, however, is if you are, or going to, hurt yourself." she smiled softly.
I would just like to thank you for reading this chapter (and book). You guys are all apart of the story, with out you, this story wouldn't come to be. So, thank you.
The group sat in silence for a moment before Wade spoke up from his spot. Standing up, he walked over towards the hologram (that JARVIS so graciously pulled back up). Staring at the object with a hand on his hip, he devised a mental plan. The Avengers didn't even notice that he wasn't sitting anymore.
Grinning mischievously, Flash clapped his hands and looked around the students that were lined up against their own free will. "You know what time it is, bitches." he spoke once the coach was out of hearing distance. "Dodge ball time."
And then Peter started to pale. ‘Dammit!’ he thought, ‘I knew this would happen, I should’ve declined Mr. Stark’s offer’ he scolded himself.
"Hi, welcome to Forever 21!" the woman smiled widely, looking more like a forced grin. "My name is Amber. Is there anything that I could help you with?" Peter forced a smile and shared a quick glance with Natasha, who was doing the same thing.
Tony and Steve shared a look at each other as the latter walked up to the shorter and wrapped his hand around the other. Natasha and Clint also shared a look, though their's was both of anger for letting this happen to the children, and one of pure, grief-stricken melancholy.
Peter's eyes suddenly felt heavy, his lack of sleep getting the better of him. Seeing this, the god quickly scooted over to where his back was against the wall and opened his arms. "You can lay on me if you would like. You are deprived of human touch, this is the least I can do to help you, for now at least."
I don't understand why you choose not to stand up for yourself. Flash needs payback for what he does, Peter.
Wade spun on the heel of his foot to face the circle of confused adults. "This isn't the best plan, and sure as
When entering the boys locker room, Natasha stopped dead in her tracks. Clint was right by her side as well, shock and anger on his face at the sight of the young teen. "What the fuck?!" he nearly shouted, causing Peter to flinch even more at the loud noise.
Using his Spidey Senses to make sure nobody was around, he pulled his black bag out of the backpack and walked over to the bedroom's bathroom. "Holy shit.." Peter whispered to himself as he looked around the bathroom. "This bathroom is as big as my old bedroom." he muttered. Biting the inside of his cheek, he opened the doors below the sink and placed his bag in there. Making sure it was out of site and secure, he closed it back and walked back towards his bags.
"Wanda -- Wanda!" Clint called, snapping the female out of her panicking thoughts. "Please be quiet. We can't let Tony find out about this -- at least, not yet."
The group of adults were all deadly silent, Wanda finally able to clamp down her grief, as they listened onwards, afraid they'd miss something vital.
Sniffing, the male shook his head and started walking once more. This was stupid. Everything was stupid --
For the first time in a while, he smiled. A true smile. Natasha took note of this, observing from afar. Her hand rested under her chin, watching Peter's every movement. "Jesus, Nat, scare the child why don't you." Sam muttered under his breath; earning a swift punch to his face. "Dammit.." he hissed while rubbing his nose.
"Thank you." Slowly moving Peter to where he was laying down on the couch, the mercenary placed his hands at the hem of Spider-Man's shirts. Looking up, the merc saw Parker chewing his bottom lip, drawing the tiniest bit of blood. Lifting his shirt up, he saw that Peter wasn't wearing his binder, let alone a bra. This was going to be way easier then.
Nodding his head slightly, Peter trudged over towards the end chair, scooting it out and sitting down in the thing. To his right was Wanda, and to his left was Captain America.
"You have a problem with this, Steve?" Tony questioned, his eyebrow raised as he stood up to get his laptop, which was conveniently placed on the couch-side table.
The team begrudgingly moved to their partner's sides, waiting for Deadpool's further instructions -- and
“Woah, hold up a second, you can.. Understand, them?” Bruce asked bewildered, eyebrows knitting together as he tilted his head slightly to the left.
"Ah," he said, turning his attention back to Peter. "Peter," he talked, looking through the papers on his clipboard that he carried around. "I've been looking at the students grades for gym, and I've noticed, that from last year, that you're falling a bit behind, both grade wise, and physically." Peter sighed, so
Shaking the feeling off, Peter waked over to the food storage closet and pulled out random ingredients, all ranging from potatoes, apples, rolls, and much more. After two trips, Peter finally placed all the ingredients on the counter, it filling up more than half of the surface. Wanda pulled out a couple of pots and pans, turning on the oven as well for Natasha (who was taking putting the turkey in the oven). Going to the sink, Peter took one of the pots and poured some water into it. Placing that aside onto the top of the stove top, he waited for it to boil. While waiting, he started to prepare the stuffing. Peter has had quite some bit of practice with cooking -- seeing he would help Aunt May a lot with Thanksgiving.
The young hero was quiet for a short moment as he clutched onto the hem of his shirt tightly, tugging on the fabric as he held back those salty tears. Clearing his throat, he talked once more. "I don't understand how you're supposed to help me be trans -- out of all the people, why you? Why do you say you understand?" he repeated his question unknowingly. At the moment, his brain was barely working.
Peter began to feel wave after wave of fear and his stomach almost gave out on him. He could hear his heart pounding so loudly he thought it would come out of his chest, exploding like in that one movie he watched with Ned and MJ. Pains were shooting down his body as he became so afraid he couldn't catch his breath.
With that, the two Avenger's picked up the boy carefully and began to walk back to the car in a hurry. "But whoever it was, will have to answer to me, personally."
Opening Peter's door, both Loki and Peter walked towards the elevator. Getting in, Loki glanced down towards the human. Shaking his head, he sighed. "Keep your head up, child. Shoulders back and posture straight. No one of high-importance such as yourself should be walking around as if they're in a ball."
Running a hand through his short, hair, Hawkeye squinted as he glanced around the room. Shaking his head with a sigh, he turned around and walked towards the back of the store. As he passed by the jewelry section, a
Rubbing small circles on the boys right cheek, Deadpool stared down at him as Peter's mouth parted. "Thank you," he spoke in a horse whisper, almost startling the mercenary.
Sighing, Jacoby stood up and dismissed the group, going back to the middle and picking up the strewed balls. Ned walked over to him with an apologetic look on his face. "Oh, don't give me that, shit, Ned. You know I could beat him any day." Peter mumbled under his breath, huffing as he tried to discreetly adjust his binder.
Nodding, Bruce sat on one of the chairs circling the table and telly. Cap was already sitting on one end of the sofa. A few minutes passed, Peter swaying from the heel of his foot to the ball, his hands in his hoodie pocket. "Oh, for God's sake." Tony grumbled, turning and looking over the back of the white leather couch. "Get over here and stop being so... awkward."
." he started, listing off things to the older man. "And then helping me by cleaning me up after I just barged into your home like I owned the place,"
Sam, James, and Wanda breathed in a shaky breath at the information. They wanted to deny it so much, but no matter how hard they did ignore the fact, the doctor was correct in the end. The only thing keeping Peter Benjamin Parker alive was his vengeance.
"What are we going to do?" Wanda spoke almost silently. "What if we never see Peter again? What if -- what if he, he ends up like his friend?"
"Are you fucking kidding me?" Tony growled from his spot. Banging his hands on the table, a stray coffee pot fell off of the table and splintered into a million pieces on the ground.
"The last thing we need is an emotional, angry Iron Man flying around and threatening each student with death until one of them cough up." Clint added, crossing his arms over his chest as he and Natasha watched from a slight distance.
"Do you want an ice cream?" Natasha then asked, remembering how they haven't ate anything for lunch yet. Spider-Man simply shook his head no. Understanding that Peter just wanted to be left alone, Natasha dropped the subject.
After Michelle's death, Mrs Leeds took the offer that both Steve and Tony offered; Ned to move in temporarily with them. The woman was confused at first, that is until Steve spoke up from his place -- correcting what Stark had said previously.
Though Peter's breathing evened out, tears still fell from his eyes and onto the shirt he was wearing (which happened to be Wade's shirt that he was gifted). "They k-know.." was all Peter could say, and even those words burned his throat. Natasha nodded stiffly, sadness in her eyes. Another stray tear rolled down Peter's cheek. Frowning softly, Romanoff reached up and wiped the tear away with her thumb as she caressed the young boys cheek.
Standing up, Clint placed his coffee pot on the table as he summoned a holographic city off the map, courtesy of Jarvis.
Whether it was snowing, hailing, raining, or whatever Mother Nature decided to throw at him, he would find MJ's killer.
“Good, I’ll go talk to your aunt.” Mr. Stark smiled, unlocking the door and walking out of it, leaving Peter petrifyed in his spot.
"But I wasn't even finished," the scientist pouted slightly, causing Aunt May to giggle, trying to cover a hiccup.
So sorry about the wait! I was originally going to post this yesterday, but, I'm falling behind on my own human needs (eating, sleeping, etc.) So, I hope you can forgive me. Yeah, I know, I hate myself too.
Sam fanboyed over his graphic t, making sure to stick his tongue out, and flip off, Clint on the down low when no one was 'watching'. Rhodey was greatly happy with his handkerchief, and even Vision was slightly amused by the bell. Aunt May thanked her nephew for the new glasses case, complimenting the colour and painting choice.
Peter looked up to her, only now hearing her. Texting a goodbye to Ned and Wade, separately of course, he closed his phone and put it back on the bedside table. "Decent, I guess." Peter finally answered her.
On the same day, Bruce Banner and Clint Barton were put on trial in court. Five minutes into the session, Natasha reluctantly bailed them out; threatening to get Tony Stark on the judge's ass if he didn't let them go.
It was a normal morning for Ned, as normal as normal could get. Checking his phone, he looked at the broken phone screen, sighing as he saw that there were no notifications.
Nodding his head quickly, he grabbed his backpack and duffel bag, pulling it along as he followed Tony. A wave of excitement washed over himself as he entered the elevator that lead up to the Avengers.
“Hello, Peter. Nice to finally meet you in person.” Stark smiled, placing the rest of his uneaten scone on the napkin (that May laid out) in front of him.
Peter's eyes widened slightly, a grin plastered on his face. "You like this song?" Natasha asked, looking away from the road to glance at the boy before looking back. Peter only nodded his head, humming along with the lyrics. Natasha grinned as well. "So do I," and with that, she turned up the volume ten folds.
"Ned." Someone spoke. Looking up, he found the dreaded scene. Peter was on the floor crying, and by the looks of it, he's been like that for a while now. All of his favourite superheroes were around the teen as well.
floral. "How about you go try that on?" Natasha nodded her head towards a black long sleeve covered in different white doodles. Nodding his head, Parker took the cloth off the rack and made his way to the dressing room, which, conveniently, was just a couple of steps to the left.
Parker held back a sigh. Did anyone really want to go back? Sure, he had Ned and MJ, which he has texted here and there over the break, but, to be honest, he didn't
"Mr. Parker, your heart rate is sky rocketing. Shall I call in Mr. Stark?" the same voice questioned.
"Follow me, kid. I'll show you to your room." Stark smiled, placing his sunglasses in his suit pocket. Nodding his head, Peter followed Mr. Stark out of the room before he made a bigger fool out of himself.
(When did you become so-- oOH! PRETZELZZZ!!!) Wade snapped his head to the left, sniffing the air. His eyes then landed on a random pretzel shop.
Stark agreed, saying he wouldn’t accept nothing else. While Peter was packing, he heard the door to his bedroom open, revealing Aunt May. “Hey, Aunt May.” Peter smiled, biting the inside of his cheek.
Natasha laughed -- not at his voice crack, but at the question. "Because I sure as hell don't trust Barton going by himself. I sent Banner to parent over him and all, but now that I'm thinking about it, Clint's probably already convinced Bruce to do something idiotic -- turning him to his dark and sinister ways."
"I said go away!" he spoke, grabbing a hold of his pillow and threw it sideways, not looking as he threw it at his door. Instead of it banging against the wood, it clanked against something that
