The locksmith finishes and leaves their invoice with the new set of keys. Dean is appreciative that she was a quiet and efficient worker, because he was not in the most chatty mood. He's more than happy to fall back on the couch after locking the door after her.
Castiel was silent. His next words were like air as he couldn’t help asking, “Do you miss your brother?”
Dean turns his face up to the darkened sky; it’s just barely misting now, and he closes his eyes as he allows the cold moistness to coat his exposed skin. He mindlessly puts his phone in his jacket pocket, allowing himself a moment of peace, when his knuckles bump into something inside of it. He pulls out a pack of cigarettes and his old silver zippo.
“That’s cool!” Jack replies. He thinks everything Dean does is “cool,” even though Dean doesn’t think he’s remotely cool at all.
Dean thrusted down and slotted against Castiel’s cock again. Castiel gasped, and arched his back as Dean pulled away. Dean growled and bit Castiel’s lip too before he tested thrusting again. Castiel moaned and licked into Dean’s mouth.
Drex and Ash were sound asleep together. Dean looked around the room, but Castiel wasn’t at the window or loveseat. He bent his head to peek around the small alcove, but he couldn’t see any light coming from the bathroom.
Dean balked at the unconscious thought that had suddenly inflicted his mind. He felt his heart pound rapidly and his breath got short. This was stupid, it shouldn’t be a problem to share a bed with Castiel any more than any of his other teammates. Hell, he’d had to share beds with Sammy and plenty of others before too.
Castiel blushed; he’d gotten the waiting job for the winter break because the family could use the money, meager as it was. Besides, he prophesied that he wouldn’t be spending much time hanging out with Dean anyway, so it’d be nice to stay busy.
The urge to pee can be strong enough to wake a person up from deep sleep, and that’s exactly what happened to Dean. His eyes opened as if someone had punched him in the gut. He inhaled sharply as he looked around.
He sets his bowl of sugary cereal down on the counter and starts rifling through the pantry as Dean fumes in the foyer, watching the bastard with growing anger. The heavy construction outside echoes loudly through the thin apartment walls and mingles with the playfully annoying tune of the cartoon on the TV. The cascade of noises pounds in rhythm with Dean’s heated blood. His head won’t stop questioning what his eyes are seeing: Is this kid just playing with him? Does he know about Dean already, and to what extent? Who
His legs feel unsteady as they carry him up the steps to Cas’s door. The place is pretty shabby, although spacious, as far as cheap apartment layouts go. Anyway, it’s better than anything Dean has. But he stares at the peeling paint on the door as he swallows down his nerves and manages to knock. No response. Dean knocks again. He sighs in agitation, not really wanting to have to use the key that he had been considering earlier, but he’s getting antsy and doesn’t know how long he should wait. So here he is, putting the key into its slot.
“Hm, well,” Jack thinks through quick bites, “My dad is that Luci guy - the one that attacked me earlier this week.”
His breath is getting as lost as Cas’s, but they get lost together, breathing each other’s air. Cas loves the sound of Dean’s breath working to pump through his lungs; loves that he does that to him.
She lifts her own, half-sipped shot. They clink, hit the bartop, and throw it back. Meg hisses and whoots, but Cas just starts chasing it with the beer. He doesn’t stop until it’s more than three-quarters gone.
Cas almost misses the call because he’s so shocked, but he finally finds his wits and answers as casually as his beating heart will allow: “Hello?”
” Sam chastises him. Dean rolls his eyes and moves his phone over to his other ear as Sam continues on, “
“Like you’re one to talk…” a gleam flashed across Dean’s eyes, and then he was pouncing on Castiel, “Come here!”
He partially cringes at his rude behavior to Dean’s work as a trucker, but in actuality he was a soldier. Also, imagining that part of Dean’s life reminds Cas of how distant he’s kept Dean in their current relationship.
He nonetheless lost his breath before Castiel was pushing his lips back against Dean’s. Dean slid his tongue against the boy’s as Castiel’s hand snaked away from his cock. Dean’s hands on Castiel’s ass felt the material bunch up, and soon a hot mass was laying against Dean’s dick.
Castiel bit his lip to stop the tears. Dean’s words made Castiel feel crazy and gaslit; he didn’t know what to believe. But he was still angry, and a savageness took over him then.
Cas groans to himself. Claire… Despite her not always being the best teamplayer, he’d rather have her than nobody tonight. Still, he knows he’ll get an earful and a half if he effectively lets Jack go to this party and not Claire. Afterall, they are just teenagers just starting their senior year.
Dean pulls his tongue away from Cas’s ear to respond, “I haven’t even fingered you yet. And there’s no lube.”
Cas looks slightly relieved. Dean has a million and one questions, but he pushes those all aside just to see Cas relax. But Cas looks anxious again suddenly, responding, “Thank you...” He looks away as he continues: “I understand I probably owe you an explanation... But everything is just a lot right now and-”
Castiel cleared the space between them and lightly pressed his lips against Dean’s again. Dean hummed and pressed back. Castiel’s heart wasn’t working properly, but still he felt like all was right. Kissing Dean was better than anything he ever experienced before.
Now that he thinks about it, Cas is pretty heavy in his sleep. He had figured in the past that Cas was just ignoring him so Dean couldn’t say goodbye by acting like he couldn’t wake up, but now he knows that he was just genuinely asleep.
Cas forces himself to roll his eyes and suppresses a lustful shiver - he’s trying to pick a fight here. His eyelids flutter and he looks away, hissing sarcastically, “How flattering.” He looks back over at Dean and continues skeptically, “And here I thought you had a career as a truck driver or something. Didn’t know they were so easy going about making detours.”
The wind was knocked out from him, but the fall hadn’t been too harsh. He got up, rubbed at his sore tailbone, and began to walk away from the house. But only a few paces away he whipped back around, his mind reeling.
“Dean,” Cas mutters between moans as he fully seats himself on Dean. It’s somewhat dry - even from the water and mild lube - but Cas is twitching to move back up. Dean doesn’t let him, pressing so hard up and into Cas that they're pressed against the tiled wall, his arms being pinned upwards. Cas yelps out while Dean tries to control his breath, feeling Cas clench around his cock.
At the beginning back then, Dean had seemed like a knight in shining armor, coming to Castiel’s rescue; so chivalrous and kind. Cas wants that back, but knows it will never be. He is happy enough with feeling it only through the weakened memories of his youth; resolved that he will never have another encounter with Dean Winchester.
Cas sucks Dean’s mostly hardened cock into his mouth, feeling each ridge pass over his tongue. His eyes slip close, enjoying only the sensation. Cas sees no point in pursuing small talk, especially since that opportunity seemed to have already passed when Dean shoved his tongue down Cas’s throat at the door. Besides, this is what Cas really wants right now anyway - fuck pleasantries.
Dean can feel himself filling Cas inside, and he hopes Cas can too. They rut together for a moment in shared post-cum glory. The shower water has run cold. Dean won’t stop kissing Cas, doesn’t know if he can. Cas’s saliva tastes spiked.
Cas sets the mug and saucer next to Dean without looking at him. He moves to the side to top off the two officers’s drinks. Cas notices that, unlike himself (who is trying very hard not to look at Dean), Donna and Jody are all but gawking at him.
Dean was getting worked up too, finding Castiel’s hand and gripping it as he stared at the boy’s closed off face, “Then why? Why can’t we be together?”
Bobby sighs, looking at his glass in his hand, “Anyway...I was able to have some of the boys take a better look at the Peterbilt,” Bobby pauses, pouring him and Dean another couple fingers of whiskey, “Dean, I’m going to give it to you straight: she’s a goddamn mess. I could even tell you that just by lookin’ at ‘er.”
Cas clenches, but quivers an exhale and relaxes once more. Dean pulls his fingers out of Cas, moving his arm back around the man so their chest and back are pressed to each other again. The movement makes Dean cockhead push past Cas’s rim. Cas loses his breath, shaking in Dean’s arms. He bites Cas’s ear as the sensation of being inside Cas starts to take him over.
Jack chuckles, “Thank you. Oh, and you don’t have to whisper. Cas is such a heavy sleeper. What’s that saying? A bomb could go off and he wouldn’t wake up.”
“Nnn!” is the only response that Cas can get out of himself, moaning and panting unabashedly otherwise.
Castiel’s brow furrowed. He couldn’t speak to Sammy's character, but Castiel did wonder why he had been bullied. But he didn’t get a chance to ask, as Castiel heard Dean clearing his throat, asking, “Anna’s your sister, right?”
Castiel blushed and looked back up at the sky. He didn’t know why that thought made his heart pound, and it scared him. He shook his head, “No, I need to make breakfast in the morning. Nobody knows I’m not there.”
Cas takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. He’s exhausted, but he needs to make it clear to Dean that he doesn’t want him back in his life. He shrugs, keeping his eyes closed as he says, “I hate you.”
On closer inspection - especially to someone considering if they’ll sleep on something or not - the couch was less of a couch and more of a loveseat. A really shitty, broken loveseat that had more than one tear and stain. Dean frowned. He considered just sleeping on top of Drex.
“Ah, it’s not so bad,” Benny shrugs, “Gas is still a highly valued commodity, after all. Besides, it’s almost always in state.”
He watched as Castiel slid away from Ash’s grasp, saying, “I’m not sure. Jervis and Raul were saying something to me about a room, so…”
“A lot, I suppose… Asmod hates you now and it’s all because of me,” Castiel’s face contorted, “That’s why you shouldn’t have helped… Nobody will like you if you’re with me.”
Dean might as well just steer the car off the road right now and save them all some trouble. It’s not as if he’s very keen on finishing his conversation with Charlie - he knows they can always pick up where they left off later - but he’d been planning on calling Cas once he rolled into town. Now, that isn’t an option. He’s really beating himself up, thinking of what he can do with his newfound circumstances.
“Not a bit,” Cas bites out, moving into Dean’s space, in between his legs. He looks down at Dean, their noses only inches from one another.
Anna sighed, “I’m sorry, Castiel… Argh! It just makes me so mad! They shouldn’t be able to get away with that!”
“I was talking to Dean about next week’s tournament,” Coach Singer started, “I’m thinking of putting him in, but he still needs a lot of practice.”
Cas can hear the atmosphere on Dean’s side change as wind and cars come through. Dean’s voice is more hushed now, “
“What are you doing?” Dean asks in a husky voice. Cas takes the slick digits out of his mouth and slowly gets to his feet. Nose to nose with Dean, he cock pressing up against Cas’s bulge in his pants, he says, “Fuck me, Dean.”
Cas’s eyes slowly trail up from Dean’s feet up to meet his eyes. Cas wants to scream in his face like he had his pillow, assault Dean’s tall handsome figure like he had his mattress. He thinks of all his options, not daring to speak until he’s certain what action he’ll take.
Cas is shaken out of his reverie, looking slightly embarrassed as he responds, “Nothing... Well. I guess I was just thinking. About what a coincidence it is.”
Sometimes, Dean wishes he was dead. He’d probably put a bullet in his head, or hang himself. He’s considered drowning too, but feels that’s too Edwardian. Probably just overdose, like he almost accomplished that one time after leaving Lisa and Ben... He thinks so many people would be better off if he weren’t alive. A burden to breathe - that’s what his dad had always said. Dean really felt like that sometimes - a waste of space. He just hates himself so much, he wonders how anyone could ever love him, especially someone as wonderful as Cas. If anything, being close to Cas was just poisoning the man he cares for. Dean understands that’s why Cas has been keeping him at arm's length, because he knows Dean will just ruin his life. But now they’re getting close again, and everything’s changing...
Dean moans. The heat in Cas’s pelvis has rocketed to his pulsing cock. Dean’s own hardened member rubs against Cas through their pants. Cas gives a soft moan of approval. Dean’s hands grab and press at Cas’s hips as he slots their trapped dicks together and thrusts up. Cas bites down hard on Dean’s shoulder. Dean moans again against Cas’s ear, hissing out, “Is this what you wanted?”
Cas slightly deflates at that defense. He’s able to at least offer: “Jack usually lives in the loft above the diner. He’s staying here with me for a while.”
The group chuckled, but Castiel’s eyes were trained on Dean as he lifted the first glass up and then downed it. Dean quickly slammed the empty glass upside down and took the second in line. He drank it, put it on the low table upside down, and took a third. He started drinking it but coughed and set it back down.
But about a half an hour in, a sweaty Ash approached Castiel and Drex’s mat, followed by a hesitant Dean.
A sharp slap comes at his ass, encouraging Cas. His hips rock lewdly, grunting and moaning every time Dean’s cock rubs up and over his prostate. Dean holds Cas’s bouncing ass cheeks, pulling down roughly every time Cas rocks up. Dean is so deep, Cas is losing his control as his moans stream out evenly.
Castiel turned his back to Dean, took a deep breath, and did his nearly flawless back handspring into a backflip.
No kidding, Dean figures. The brief explanation explains the lock changes and cautious atmosphere, but it also brings up a hundred more different questions. Like, how Luci has anything to do with Jack, or why he’s wanted from the federal government. But another, more incessant question is gnawing at Dean: “Wait. Isn’t Jack just at school now? Shouldn’t he, I don’t know, lay low?”
The crying sniffles to an end and Cas gets out of bed. First, he goes to his phone. There are three texts from Jack, one from over an hour ago and the other two from over thirty minutes ago. Cas’s heart races and he checks all of them. The first one reads: “
Dean tried to adjust, embarrassed at how obvious his body reacted to Castiel. But Castiel stayed strong, moving with Dean so that he didn’t go anywhere.
Castiel didn’t answer either, didn’t look at Dean. He just wiped his eyes with the back of his other hand, punctuated by a single sniffle.
“He asked for you by name,” Jack adds. Cas reels around to him with wide eyes. Jack’s face is confused as he asks, “Do you know him?”
“So, Asstiel,” Asmod said to him as if talking to a child, “You’re going to write the essay before Monday, right?”
Waking up with Cas splayed out on top of him on the couch would be a dream come true if not for two factors: the first being that he feels like his injured body has broken all over again under the prolonged weight and awkward position. The second factor is that there is a commotion coming from the kitchen, so loud that he can hear it over the TV that was left on.
“Then I’m your boyfriend,” Dean gently kissed Castiel’s eyelid as it slipped shut, “And you’re my boyfriend. We know that. That’s all that matters.”
Castiel was pressing himself up against Dean’s body, wriggling as Dean’s lips worked against his ear curiously. Dean’s arms loosely wrapped around Castiel’s shoulders, and Castiel’s fingers played with Dean’s hips in response. Castiel’s voice was raspy as he explained: “I’ve been thinking that I want to try something with you that I’ve always...fantasized about.”
Dean stops himself from banging his forehead on his steering wheel at a red light solely because he probably shouldn’t hit a concussed head. One of the smartest decisions he’s made all week.
“Everything go down alright?” Cas asks as politely as he can without sounding too smug. The man looks up with a start, but not from his phone but from deep thought. Cas’s brow furrows as the man gives Cas a blatant once over silently.
Dean shook his head and let go. He got up and looked around, “Man, we must have really gotten into it.”
He was about to get to his feet, when an open hand was offered to him. Castiel bit his lip, looked away, and took the hand.
Dean seems to ignore him, his chin bumping past Cas’s cock to nibble at his hip bone. Cas grumbles but manages to keep his lips sealed. Dean says against his skin, “Cool tattoo. Mean something?”
Castiel didn’t look at Dean’s face, but he did as Dean asked. Still holding the bag of peas to his other eye, Castiel scooted sideways and laid down, gently setting his head against Dean’s thigh. He was still so suspicious of Dean’s motives, but he decided not to question him further for the time being.
Castiel kept his eyes down. That was true, Coach had entrusted Castiel with the keys to the gym and locker room so he and some teammates could practice after hours. Everybody had gotten really excited at getting into state sectionals, and it seemed like they stood a chance at going to nationals; that’s why everyone was willing to put in the extra hours.
“I don’t think Cas has seen this either, y’know,” Bobby suddenly says. Dean looks up at him as he continues, “I remember he didn’t buy a yearbook that year. Or his senior year.”
Castiel took a deep breath, “My dad is on a book tour again. My step-mom lives in a different town.”
An understanding smile grows on Coach Singer’s lips, “I’m not going to stop you from helping me with the try outs either.”
Coach Singer made them repeat Dean’s bottom position until he got crowding down. Dean was able to slip above Castiel and lock him down. He pinned Castiel with his stomach to the mat. Coach Singer blew his whistle, “Yes! Great work!”
Castiel sighed and eyed Jo before he lifted the drink to his lips and knocked it back. This one tasted even smoother than the last, so Castiel wasn’t too unhappy about this previously unknown “rule.”
Just as Dean was getting adjusted to Castiel’s temperature, he took it away to mutter, “Dean, uh, will you follow me?”
“Excuse us, Met,” Cas replies curtly. Dean gets the impression that this guy isn’t Cas’s favorite either.
Dean smiles to himself at the brotherly concern, “Ugh, I mean I guess I can move my extreme motorcycle stunting lesson to next week.”
Castiel looked back to Dean as he felt two fingers hook underneath his singlet bundled at his waist. Sparks flew through the half inch of space between Dean’s lukewarm fingers and Castiel’s blood hot cock.
“Okay Dean, are you ready to try top?” Coach Singer called as two boys left the mat. Dean stood and came to the front. Coach Singer also called for Ash. Ash got up with a long groan, shaking his head.
Cas blinks and looks away, blushing. The first time he ever got drunk was with Dean; even then it had surprised Dean how much Cas could put down.
Dean’s brow cocks in surprise. His eyes follow behind Cas as Gadreel comes back around with a tray of food. He smiles triumphantly, saying politely, “Yes, please.”
How last year Naomi had informed the faculty and principal about Castiel’s “condition,” meaning that he was outed to everyone in town. Ash had said that parents of the kids from the football team Castiel was on at the time called to complain, resulting in Castiel being kicked from the team. He’d joined wrestling at Naomi’s recommendation to Coach Singer, but that had gone down just as well as anyone would expect.
Cas rolls his eyes obviously, saying before lifting a bag out of the trash and tossing it into the dumpster, “Don’t tempt me.”
Dean quickly pulled back and tried to tame his racing heart. Castiel’s head ducked down and curled against the space between Dean’s arms, nuzzling into his chest.
Cas quickly tries to save face, eyes moving over to the other trucker everyone else knows he is acquainted with: “Benny. We, uh, have a veteran’s discount.”
Castiel bit his lip, knowing it was wrong to do this here. Seeing Dean take off his shirt made it all very real to Castiel; being wrong felt so right.
Castiel watched from the side as Coach Singer showed Dean where to put his arms and hands as he knelt over Ash. The whistle blew, the match began, but was quickly over as Ash was unable to switch. Dean, to his credit, held tight and was able to maneuver away from Ash’s reach.
He managed to roll his eyes as he leaned against the locker too, responding with as much sarcasm as he could, “Oh, yeah. All the time.”
His brain went into overdrive as it immediately jumped to the idea of Castiel waking up to come lay next to him. The sudden, tired thought had Dean unabashedly whipping around to face him.
Dean was breathless as he watched Castiel get on his knees, fingers still hooked on the front of Dean’s waistband. Castiel looked up at Dean and couldn’t help but bite at his lip, finally continuing to ask in a breathy tone, “Is it okay if I taste you?”
“Oh, yeah, that’s real nice,” Dean replies, keeping his smile as he sips at the fresh round of coffee.
“No, I mean it’s cute. Met and Meg? The names' commonality alone just spells out fate, don’t you think?” Dean jests further.
Dean’s countenance remains the same, despite Cas’s insult. Cas bites his lip and looks back up at the ceiling.
Another hour flies by - this time feeling like an eternity, as if he’s overslept and missed some important meeting - and Dean’s dead sleep comes crashing down on him at sharp, loud knocking. Dean’s heart is in his throat, jumping up and racing over to the door.
Cas holds his breath, wondering if Dean will put up a fight. But he merely sighs, bringing Cas in closer as he complies sadly, “Fine.”
The soft ambience of the hotel comes back to him; the shitty heater humming, a dim glow of light and the soft chatter from the beat up TV he’d left on. His lungs stop trembling and he sighs defeatedly, rolling onto his side. His feet hit the floor as he sits up, leaning forward to dig his elbows into his knees as he rubs his dry eyes with his fingers.
Dean faced the darkness of the room, getting his bearings and definitely not stalling. But exhaustion overwhelmed him as he stood in the bathroom’s door frame, so he eventually returned to the bed with a violently snoring Ash. Drex had spread eagle on the half where Dean had been laying, and Dean nudged him impatiently, “Hey, move.”
Cas’s eyes skim over the kitchen and catch Hannah’s. She’s paused over the stove, meat sizzling as she stares at Cas. Cas’s eyes bug out and he clears his throat, trying to save face. Hannah doesn’t buy it. Her brow cocks, “You see a ghost?”
Typically at this point Cas is just begging for Dean to fuck him already. But right now Cas is being suspiciously silent as Dean slowly works his fingers in and out of him. Well, the man isn’t all quiet, moaning softly, but he doesn’t try to take the reins like he usually does.
Castiel felt all his anger - about everything - come to a head as he was able to lock Dean’s legs with his, flip them, and pin Dean’s neck, shoulders and arms with his forearms.
Castiel took a deep breath. He peeked up to Jo, who raised an expectant brow, grin still plastered on her face. She crossed her arms.
Ketch takes a long drag and looks away again. Seeming to cool off a bit, he asks, “How long did the doctors say?”
“Dean,” Bobby cuts him off from rambling. Dean seals his mouth, knowing that his attempt at changing the subject was pretty obvious.
“Thanks,” Dean replies shortly to Cas as if he is any other wait staff, turning back to Benny, “I heard you got stuck with suicide jock loading, though…”
Turning around to the other bed he saw Ash and Drex intertwined as well. The image would have been funny if not so cosmically tragic. Perhaps it wasn’t that odd for people to do that, and Dean didn’t think he’d care if anybody else had done what Castiel did. A little strange, sure, but not enough to get out of bed. But Castiel
Dean’s arm wrapped around Castiel's shoulder and the worry was easily replaced by a different, stranger set of nerves. Dean started them walking, saying, “Good! C’mon, can’t keep Dr. Badass waiting.”
“Castiel!” Anna called in warning, but Al was already behind him, and only Castiel felt a painful kick in the back of his knee before he was hitting the floor. He had tried to catch himself as he toppled onto his scattered papers, but it only brought a sharp pang to his wrists. He stared at the ground, now only inches from him.
“I’ll be right back,” Dean promised, walking to the bank. Castiel opened his mouth to protest, but Dean was already traversing the creek to the other side, hopping precariously from one large, slick rock to the next.
Castiel tugged at Dean’s arms, and Dean came to him easily. But although he was leaning over Castiel again, Dean stopped. He looked at him and asked, “Yeah?”
Dean expertly licks into Cas’s mouth and caresses Cas’s tongue with his own. Cas moans and runs his hands up into Dean’s hair, sucking on his tongue. Dean reacts to that - he’s always liked it when Cas plays with his hair - and presses his thumbs into Cas’s hips.
The man chokes on his words as their eyes meet. The trucker is surprisingly handsome, no doubt, but something about his face and the green sheen of his eyes catches an old familiarity.
Dean exhales harshly like a bull being provoked with red. He pulls out to the tip and then pushes in until he’s up to the hilt. Cas loses his breath and holds on tight to Dean as he shouts out loud in the surprise stretching.
Dean quickly forced his eyes to stare at the TV, but he wasn’t receiving any of the images or  sound, being replaced with a ringing in his ear. His mind raced as he felt himself getting hard. Shame took centerstage, his only reprieve was that Ash was deep asleep and that the other two weren’t facing him.
Despite all the drama and heavy subject matter, Dean figures that their interaction has been pretty therapeutic. He offers a small smile as Cas looks back at him, “I’m glad.”
Dean’s thumbs are pressed against Cas’s hips as he stoops over further to nibble at Cas’s collarbone. Cas sinks against the countertop, leaning back and submitting.
“A little,” Dean admitted, looking away from Castiel to keep his temptation low, “Did you see the party out there?”
The tension snaps and Cas cums with a crash. He can hear Dean behind him, his voice stuttering as his hips twitch.
He was looking down at Castiel in full body. He was holding on tightly to the pillow, his face planted on Dean’s old pillow as well. His body made a little “o” silhouette under the disheveled sheets and comforter. Dean shook himself free of those thoughts; it was super weird to stand and watch somebody while they slept, and Dean wasn’t going to tick another thing off that list tonight.
The lock turns, his hand moves the knob and he follows as the door swings open. He takes a steadying breath and looks around.
Cas steps back and snaps his eyes back at Dean. Oh, shit, he’s still pissed. Cas growls, “That doesn’t matter right now, Dean. Explain, why are you here? It’s only been a week since you last left, and-” Cas seems to lose his propulsion as he looks over Dean, taking in his injuries for the first time, “Um, what happened to you?”
Castiel’s eyes slid from the window to the front of the class. There stood the green eyed boy that had been with Asmod and his gang. Castiel could get a good look at him now: he was much taller than matronly Mrs. Doyle. He was wearing a beat up leather jacket, a flannel, some ratted shirt, jeans and boots. A sad get up, but one that oddly fit him. Around his tan neck was a golden pendant on a black chord.
Castiel shook his head, then looked over to his sister, keeping her head down and picking papers up quickly.
Dean chuckles and moves his hand away, traveling over Cas’s ass before he falls on the bed next to him. But Cas is still leaning against the headboard, feeling unable to move, even to lay down.
Dean turned back to Castiel, but Castiel merely cocked a sarcastic brow at Dean. Dean huffed a laugh in surprise. He shook his head, “Oh, fuck you, man. I could be good, but that teacher is such a drag.”
“Cas, you idiot,” Dean muttered to himself under his breath, knowing the door handle auto locked after being closed. He took one of the keys, slipped on his socks, shoes, and his coat, Dean snuck out.
He groans and tosses his phone into the backseat. Just great. The Impala is a beautiful classic, but Dean has never modernized the old auto in keeping with its old school qualities. To be clear, he has no way of charging his phone as he drives.
Castiel thought he saw Dean’s eyes soften for a moment, but then they suddenly hardened and Dean looked around the hall. Castiel did too, quickly becoming aware that most of the students were gone.
Castiel turned away and kept walking. He heard Ash and some other teammates’ voices, but he didn’t care. They all wanted to be with Dean, anyway. That was fine by him. He only wished that he could fully disappear and never come back. Instead, he kept his head down and mind far away the rest of the night.
Castiel groaned and rubbed at his temple. He really didn’t care at this point. Or, rather, he really didn’t want to care.
“I said I’ll be fine, besides,” Dean replied, “Sonny would kill me if I wasn’t there in the morning. And Ash is waiting up for me any-”
Cas spares a smile and Dean’s grin meets his as he manages to bend down and kiss him. They lose their smiles as their tongues push into one another’s mouths. Their spit slides against one another and Cas is in a surge of ecstasy at the simple sensation of tasting Dean’s tongue.
“Dea-” Cas can barely get out before Dean’s hand is off his cock and is covering Cas’s mouth and nose. Dean shoves himself all the way in Cas, pressing their bodies flat against the wall and oh god, Cas is so close. Dean bites into Cas’s neck as his body gives a wicked shudder.
Castiel’s breath caught in his throat. The air seemed to be sucked out of the room. Anna’s voice seemed distant as she gasped, “What! Oh my gosh, are you going out with her?”
“Jesus, was that seriously our homework for history?” Dean asked with an impatient sigh, carving a whistle from a reed with a pocket knife.
His eyes trail back up to Dean as he feels him walking towards him. Cas’s eyes shift to look out the diner’s front windows. Cars are still passing. Cas quickly turns away and goes into the kitchen, floors already ruined thanks to Dean.
Castiel rolled his eyes, standing up suddenly. Dean watched him as Castiel stood next to the bedside. The other boy tapped on Dean’s side, “Roll over.”
But he doesn’t leave just yet, his eyes readjusting and noticing something that is typically not there: a torn sheet of paper. Castiel picks it up and sees numbers scribbled on it, under it is written, “Dean”.
Cas quickly selects all, and deletes. He sighs and looks away. His eyes fall upon Met’s door. He bites his lip and turns back to his phone screen.
Dean’s hips come alive, his other hand moving to grip the other side of Cas’s head as he thrusts his own dick in and out of Cas’s mouth. Dean all but yells, “Ah! Here!”
Dean is wearing a flannel, buttoned down with nothing underneath, and his classic leather jacket. He’s clean shaven, eyes bright as he leans against Cas’s door jam in the dark.
Cas shakes his head, glancing to the side, “No, I mean it. Today was good. Like, really good. And… I just appreciate it a lot.”
Coach Singer claps his hands together and begins walking in front of them, saying, “Alright fellas, we’re going to start with a dynamic warm up. Do RDLs first, so remember back straight. Nice and slow and controlled…”
He turned the light off harshly and opened the door, too absorbed in an instinctual self loathing to be afraid of the ridiculous matter he was entering.
Cas’s thoughts had done nothing but make him more manic. He had arrived home and, among all the other activities, did something sinister. He cleaned his anus and lubed up a buttplug. He ignored his hardening cock as he worked it in and pulled back on his pants.
Castiel did turn around to Dean at that tone, met with a gaze that was equally as fiery as his own. Dean broke eye contact first, sighing and shaking his head. He gave Castiel a once over and walked towards him. He grabbed Castiel’s wrist and kept walking, saying, “Come with me.”
Cas’s heart pangs as he catches Benny’s endeared smile, sonorous voice answering, “That’d be the polite thing to do.”
Still, he had meant it when he had sent it. Also, he can’t deny that his attitude when he’s with Dean could be construed as hostile… Alright, he is downright mean.
“His gym bag? We already checked,” Coach replied, eyeing an increasingly nervous Castiel. Dean tried not to smile at Castiel’s endearing squirming.
Dean loses his smile and takes even breaths. He presses against Cas more, so much that his back starts to hurt as it digs into the edge of the counter. He doesn’t mind, totally entranced with feeling the weight of Dean.
Dean bites his lip and holds Cas’s eyes. He chuckles and looks down at his coffee, “Alright, you got me. I didn’t come here for a meal… Although, I really did dig that burger from last time.”
“I want to taste you,” Dean says, his tongue flattening at the underside of Cas's cock. Cas loses his breath and presses his head against the mattress behind him with a choked groan. Dean continues, “You said I forgot a lot, so let me remember.”
A rough kiss on his cheek comes and Cas gasps with surprise. Dean’s fist strikes the mattress beside him and Cas looks over with wide eyes. Dean growls angrily, “Goddammit!”
“Ah, yeah. And you give the best head too,” Dean is pushing Cas hair through his fingers, plush lips parted as his breath stutters through. His cock twitches and bounces on Cas’s face as he licks the underside of it. Cas watches Dean bite his lip before flashing a cocky smile and asking, “So got an endgame here, or does my dick really just taste that good?”
Uriel reminded Castiel of himself, despite them being half-siblings. Uriel always had his headphones on and his walkman blaring, not talking unless absolutely necessary. When he was younger, he’d cry to Castiel all the time. He was bigger than most kids his age now, and made sure to keep to himself.
Castiel’s eyes roamed to the side. He felt stupid for not thinking of how he’d get back in after sneaking out. Castiel shook his head, “No. It’s nothing.”
Castiel looked as if he was trying to desperately harness his tears, eyes closed. Dean’s hand moved to Castiel’s wet cheek, the other boy wordlessly pushing his face into his palm in response. Another sniffle, and Castiel blinked his eyes half open as he continued: “I just want to be close to you again.”
Cas gives one last long moan, Dean’s breath hitches. His body stiffens against Cas’s as Dean buries to the hilt inside of Cas. Cas is spellbound by Dean’s green eyes as he gives one more rough thrust into Cas, and then he falls over the edge. His eyes squeeze close as the pleasure overflows, hands scratching madly for purchase of Dean’s sweat slicked skin. Cas’s cock twitches wildly between their bodies as warm streaks of cum leak against their chests.
“Oh, come on, it’ll be way past their bedtime,” Dean begged, leaning against the other side of Castiel’s locker. Castiel opened the combination and started pulling his books out.
Dean takes a deep breath, pulling the two fingers out but catching Cas’s spasming asshole with his thumb and tugging. He hears Dean huff, “Shit… Okay, okay.”
Cas is shocked. He doesn’t want to care about Dean, but he also can’t help but not want Dean to feel sad. But Cas is on the outside of what has happened in Dean’s life, and Dean is content with that. The shock transforms into an urge to be in as much physical contact with Dean as possible. He wants to hold him closer.
“I don’t know, that she’s liked me for a while? Ha, I think she was ready to head to the janitor’s closet or something,” Dean chuckled.
Dean pushes further inside Cas. The good hand that’s not touching Cas’s cock is pulling Cas closer from the throat, the man sensually moans deep and gravily that vibrates against his hand. Dean’s mouth is loosely fitted over the top of Cas’s ear, breathing hotly as he pulls back out to the tip.
All eyes shift to Cas, but all Cas sees is Dean looking at him with a shock that Cas feels mirrored on his own face. He is just as surprised he said something as anybody else in the proximity is.
The burger comes and Cas asks Jack to take it to the man’s table. Cas peaks over after a while only to see if he’s actually eating it, and feels a pang in his chest at seeing the man scarf it down. A small smile spreads on his face that he swiftly wipes away.
“Because they lost,” Dean said triumphantly. Castiel grimaced. He hoped that Dean was right, but he also knew Ash’s tongue had no fidelity.
Dean leans in and steals another kiss. Cas caves under his touch and they get wrapped up in one another yet again.
Castiel unfolded one of the towels on the bed and poured ice cubes on it. He put another towel on top, explaining, “We don’t have ice packs, so…”
“Keep your voice down,” Cas whispers harshly, ignoring the blush spreading on his cheeks, averting his eyes to look around the diner cautiously.
Dean already knows what the scraps look like, and he doesn’t think he can bear to look upon her now. He shakes his head, “No, not tonight. Thanks.”
Dean heard footsteps approach the bed and he tried to wriggle away without turning over to face him, “I’m feeling better, really. Great job, Drex. I’m just going to lie here and-”
Dean has to restrain himself from just jumping up, instead trying to be inconspicuous. He gets out from under Cas to investigate, working past the pain in his aching joints. A small clatter comes from the kitchen, grabbing Dean’s attention and making his heart pound. He’s sure this is Luci, breaking in to do his sick psychopathic stuff. Dean peeks over the couch.
Dean can’t look at Cas, but there’s a moment of quiet astonishment before the other man exclaims, “What?”
Dean swallowed, his last words sounding broken. Castiel was listening patiently, his brow furrowing in sympathy. Dean always talked in bits and pieces about his life before coming to Smallville, but Castiel had never pressed him about it.
Dean’s hands fell away as he got up on his knees. Castiel awed as Dean reached over his head and tugged off his henley shirt, exposing his own tanned, youthfully muscular chest.
“What is going on here?” a male professor’s voice boomed down the hall. The other students started to scatter, but Dean didn’t look away - neither did Castiel.
Time doesn’t phase Dean. He feels like a piece of dust being blown around the face of a rock as it hurtles towards a big ball of fire - wherever the sun meets him is just a chance, not as a schedule. Instead, he measures minutes by miles. He’s always had the inclination of being a nightowl anyway, never really having a good relationship with sleep.
Cas opens his eyes finally and is relieved that his sight has returned. He looks over his trembling shoulder to Dean, who’s lying with his eyes closed. Cas trepidatiously lowers himself onto the bed, laying on his stomach and burying his face into the crook of his arm, facing away from Dean.
Despite Ash’s serious snoring issues, Dean felt like he was already drifting back to sleep. But as he began to lull away, he became aware of a distinct lack of presence in the room; specifically from the other side of his bed. He halted his breath for a moment and listened, only being able to hear Ash’s incessant nasal drip and Drex’s steady breathing.
“Yeah, I guess,” Dean bites his lip and closes the trunk with a loud thunk. The construction workers aren’t there right now, so a silence settles between the two lone souls - not even the thunder disturbs them.
“No,” Dean said. Castiel’s eye leapt to his face. Dean was in front of the canopy overhead, his brow furrowed in concentration as he continued to deftly nurse Castiel’s wound.
The minuscule buzz Dean had accomplished in the motel has waned to a calm thrum in the front of his head. He feels docile and comfortably empty, enough so to give a small appreciation to the sun as it peeks over the rolling hills.
Cas’s hands immediately reach up to paw at Dean’s chest, but Dean is leaning over him again, pressing their chests flush together. Dean ducks his head past Cas’s; he can feel Dean’s lips and teeth on the side of his neck. Cas gasps at the contact, but his hands have other ideas.
“Leave him alone!” Anna screamed. Castiel could feel the other students gather around them and heard their excited chatter.
They lay there like that for a moment or two. Cas feels Dean’s breath against the sensitive skin of his neck. He blushes, but the blood soon drains. Cas suddenly wonders if Dean will fall asleep like this. He quickly mitigates this possibility, saying, “You can’t stay here.”
“Oh, yeah?” Castiel asked, only slightly interested. He knew it was already happening; most of the school was talking about the Sonny Halloween party. Asmod had been boasting about his costume in the locker room earlier, and Dean had mocked him a little. The tease had gotten a small chuckle out of Castiel.
“Did you see where Castiel put the keys after he locked up? He seems to have misplaced them,” Coach asked, eyeing Castiel haughtily.
Cas’s eyes widen as he gestures to a mantle beside Dean. It holds several framed pictures of Cas and Jack: at Disneyland, at the park, laughing, smiling, past and present. There’s a picture of them at the diner and Dean suddenly remembers seeing Jack working there once - hell, he’d even spoken to him! Dean’s head swims as if he’d just found out the sky is green, “Have these always been here?”
He looks off into the pitch black sky and wonders when he’ll stop letting associations with bad relationships rule his current outlook. He didn’t want to see Dean everywhere he went, thought he had left that kind of delirium back in his twenties.
Bus fare is getting expensive, or maybe Dean is just really starting to feel the emptying weight of his bank account. The ride had been uncomfortable - he still couldn’t get the smell of baby vomit off him, no matter how many sani wipes the mother had offered him. Anyway, he finally managed to make his way to Indiana. If anything, the journey has reminded him how much life blows when he doesn’t have his own set of wheels. And at least the rain has stopped and the clouds are beginning to clear as the day winds down.
Through the lens, he spies a shorter, middle-aged Asian woman in a jumpsuit uniform. Definitely not Luci, Dean deducts. He lets the locksmith in and lets her do her job as he goes to check his recharged phone.
He barely caught onto the pillar. He took a deep breath before beginning to shimmy down. But his footing slipped and Castiel fell the rest of the way. He landed with a thud onto the grass below.
“The dude literally did nothing, okay?” Dean whipped around, gesturing towards Castiel behind him. Castiel couldn’t understand why Dean was doing this either, so he was watching and listening intently. Dean’s shoulders raised and lowered before he continued, “Going to fuck up an innocent person with a dollar store knife for something stupid? Sounds pretty twisted to me.”
That’s a good question, Dean thinks. He wonders how he can explain to Cas that he’s just trying to pick up the pieces of his life, “I got her body sitting at my buddy’s salvage yard in Sioux Falls. Was going to bunk down there and work on her.”
Cas downs the rest of the tumbler’s contents and drags himself to his bedroom, slumping face first onto his bed. Burying his face in his covers, he holds back his tears. Damn that Dean. Fuck him for making Cas think that something would happen tonight. But no, he is truly upset with himself for putting himself out there like that.
Dean felt rejected like a stab to the chest. This was sort of the last thing Dean expected, totally blindsided. He bit his lip, sighing and moving his hands away from Castiel as he replied, “Oh. You know, you could have mentioned you weren’t into me before I went and made a total fool of myself.”
The side of Dean’s body was riding the edge of the mattress, head barely pressing into the pillow; he was tense, to say the least. He didn’t dare close his eyes yet, and his sight had adjusted to the darkness; he looked at the small, draped window above the “couch,” thinking about how ridiculous he must look. Licking his lips and blinking his painfully tired eyes, he sighed as he slowly rolled onto his back.
Castiel’s hand gently pushed back on Dean’s shoulder, slowly laying him back down on the pillow, “I’m convinced you can’t relax on your own.”
“Ah,” Cas groans, palm rubbing at his eye and the other coming down to pet the top of Dean’s head. Dean ducks lower, hands lifting up Cas’s ass as Dean’s tongue massages his perineum. Cas’s eyes squeeze close, and he can’t help but let the string of exclamations leave him. He manages to huff, “I’m going crazy.”
Cas takes a deep breath and hesitates. He really doesn’t want to go over there, doesn’t want to let this guy walk all over him and demand a free meal or something.
With one last deep breath, he hopped onto the roof’s ledging under his bedroom window. His room was in the back of the house, and the roof wrapped around to also provide a cover for the back porch on the first floor.
Cas sits back and sighs, briefly closing his eyes. Dean watches him, the television filling the silence between them. Dean thinks about how tough it must be for Cas right now with Jack. He also hates himself for intruding his weedy roots into them like this. Not just today, but ever since he had seen Cas at that damn diner. He should have just walked away. But something tells him deep inside that he would have never been able to do that.
Dean huffs a chuckle and readjusts. His lips wrap around Cas’s cockhead; he pushes down. Cas bites down on his lip, trying to control the onslaught of pleasure by measuring his heavy breaths. Dean is shallow, and it is by no means a skillful blowjob, but it is Dean’s mouth on Cas’s cock, moving up and down at a slow rate that threatens Cas’s sanity.
Dean does have a new face to Cas, afterall. The image has Cas pondering what aging truly means. The Dean from tonight has only a shadow of what he had been as a teenager. So much so that Cas hadn’t recognized him at the diner at first. But Dean had seemed to recognize him right away… Cas washed off the rest of the soap and turned off the shower.
He feels a response start to come out of him just as a fully clothed Cas enters again, patting Jack on the shoulder, “Come on, I have a meeting with Principal Mortem so we better get going.”
“But yeah, I came to see you,” Dean continues, licking his lips. Cas isn’t able to control his face this time as he gets caught in the tractor beam of Dean’s eyes. Dean offers a flirtatious smile, “I mean, come on, can you blame me? I can’t stop thinking about you.”
“Yeah?” Dean whimpers, spitting before Cas feels the trickle of cool saliva run around his hole and fingers. Dean catches it with his thumb, rubbing at Cas’s rim as he pulls his stuffed middle and ring finger apart, spreading Cas. He spits again, the drop hits his rim and slides down into him.
Cas’s expression is so astonished and offended that it’s enough to shut Dean up on its own. He takes a deep breath and feels as if a fraction of his steam has been blown off.
Dean made to step away, but Castiel just looked at the ground, not moving. Dean was still pretty tired, so his patience felt worn. He was about to coax Castiel to come along when he felt the corner of his jacket being tugged.
“I will if you say it again. Tell me that all of it didn't mean anything to you,” Dean says, looking back up to meet Cas’s gaze. His eyes glisten with unspoken emotion.
Castiel tried to turn them both around but he himself stumbled and lost his balance. Dean and him hit the asphalt with a thud. Castiel grunted but felt no pain as he looked over to Dean, who was rolling over on his back and laughing. Castiel laid on his back and started laughing too.
Cas grips onto Dean's shirt and leans into his shoulder, “I thought you’d be out with Benny tonight.”
He jets off before either one of them can say anything. Cas turns back to Dean, crossing his arms and hissing out under his breath: “I am
Dean continued walking along for a moment before noticing that Castiel wasn’t with him. He turned back and saw the other boy just standing there at the edge of the brush, looking at his empty hand. Dean thought he looked sad, and Dean understood because the fact was that he was sad too.
“Are they all younger?” Dean asked. Castiel couldn’t figure if the small talk was out of place or felt proper. He took a deep breath and played along, “No, five are older and three are younger. Alfie is still in kindergarten, Uriel is in middle school, Anna’s a sophomore, Naomi’s a senior, and the rest are all adults.”
Dean swallowed thickly, mesmerized into silence by the visage of Castiel as he fully pulled off his team hoodie from the back. A blush exploded on Dean’s face as his youthful dick reacted almost immediately and pressed up into Castiel.
Dean groans and presses his eye into the palm of his hand. Yeah, it’s pretty bad. Cas isn’t saying anything, so Dean dares to look at him. Cas’s face looks troubled and brooding, as if he’s working through something in his head.
Dean smacks Cas’s ass again and he grunts around Dean’s dick with pleasure. He sucks in the length of Dean’s cock, pushing into his throat. Dean bites Cas’s asscheek and Cas gives a long moan around Dean’s cock. Cas rocks his ass back and forth on Dean’s flattened tongue, pushing his mouth up and down on Dean’s cock simultaneously.
Cas and Meg turn to her back and see Benny Lafitte stumble up to the bar. He gestures to the bartender, “‘Nother, boss.”
“Okay,” Castiel said calmly, slowing her manic pace by measuring his own. He kept his voice even as he said, “You’ve already memorized the quadratic formula. You’re pretty good-”
Cas isn’t laughing. His head is foggy from the alcohol, but his tipsy conscience is holding back his tongue instead of loosening it. He considers pouring another one as he gets the bottle of rum out.
Castiel’s air stuck in his lungs upon hearing his name. He couldn’t protest the coach, not in front of everybody. Castiel slowly got to his feet and walked up to the mat, staring down at the ground as he stood next to Dean.
Cas hums in protest, but Dean’s mouth is so soft and the kiss so passionate that Cas melts and stops resisting. His own hands, which had been idle at his side, come to life of their own fruition and lightly touch Dean’s skin. Dean’s arms squeeze Cas and his knee comes up to slot between Cas’s legs. They kiss and Cas can’t remember the last time he’s felt so cherished through something as simple as a kiss.
“I’d fight him if he did come to pick me up,” Dean said suddenly. He turned to Castiel and gave him a smirk, “Don’t want to let the team down.”
“Happy Holidays, Metatron,” Cas replies indifferently. He turns away from Met, hoping that will be the last of it.
“Let me see your eye,” Dean said. Castiel looked over to him before presenting the other side of his face. Dean whistled, “That’s a nasty shiner. Will your parents care?”
Dean took a deep breath and looked at her with a smile, “Nuh-uh, I’m not answering more than one question.”
The memories of the accident are rough to relive as Dean thinks of how to tell Cas what happened. And although he’s recounted events to several different people by now, he’s never revealed to anyone the full events. It’s painful, but Dean works through it for Cas, “I was on an unfamiliar route the other night through Colorado, ‘cause I decided to take some stupid side contract... Anyway, it was raining pretty hard, and there was a rockslide - hit my trailer. The debris blew my tires and I lost my brakes going downhill, so I used a runoff. Rig got totaled... So did I, I guess.”
Dean’s stutters to a stop deep inside of Cas and his breath seems to have stopped just as Cas’s has. Cas opens his eyes. Dean is looking down at him with a furrowed brow and one more wave crashes down over Cas.
Yes, afterall, these thoughts are familiar to Cas by this point. He’s run around them day and night ever since he’d realized Dean might not be coming back.
He was still getting used to everyone being friendly with him when he felt so awkward inside. The last three nights Castiel had come early to avoid walking with Dean. He had the key, and he thought it would save time to set up beforehand. Because of this, the team also looked to him for structure.
Dean looked back down at Castiel with surprise. Castiel held the gaze. Dean swallowed and nodded, “Yeah. A lot.”
Castiel pulled another card and furrowed his brow. He couldn’t remember what seven was, so he just said it aloud, “Seven.”
Castiel’s hands touched Dean’s hands as he considered the question. Castiel couldn’t imagine going home after all this, not knowing if he’d ever have this kind of time again. His hands traveled up Dean’s arms. Castiel liked Dean’s skin.
The backdoor hit the wall as it swung open. Lucifer slammed it closed and crossed over to Anna. He only muttered, “Fucking finally,” as he took the plate from Anna’s hands and swayed back to the living room.
Dean rolled his eyes and caught Castiel’s look. He smiled and shook his head. Cracking open the beer, foam started overflowing.
The storm had rolled in just as predicted. It’s already busy, Hannah and Bart are throwing out food left and right; Jack and Claire are being especially amiable to the customers that filter in and meander out. Soon, the bar is full, not a table in sight, and the mild music from the radio is drowned out by the hum of chatter and pounding of rain. At times like this, Cas has to do a little of everything around the diner to help where he can and keep this machine oiled. Seeming to pay off, Cas is soon pleased at the register amount by the time noon comes around.
That was his seventh time Dean had made a detour to Bootbock and seen Cas (not like he’d admit to anyone that he was counting). And although the sex had been great - as usual - and Cas had been amiable - unusual - something still gnaws at him… Dean wonders if Cas is seeing someone else.
They typically didn’t go for two shots… Castiel couldn’t help as he looked behind his shoulder at the group. They were all laughing and egging him on, but one - a new face.
Dean can’t stand the position any longer, but he doesn’t have to - Cas pushes his ass backwards, bending forward again from Dean. Dean’s hand that was at Cas’s neck is cupping the nape, pushing Cas to try to slow his hips so that Dean can feel himself fully enter Cas.
“Hey,” she greeted with a broad smile, “Thanks for waiting. Do you have that essay? I have to hurry to class.”
Dean felt Castiel’s skin get warmer before he noticed the blush through the darkness, a small smile building on the boy’s lips. Castiel’s voice was softer than all of tonight as he confessed, “You made me feel good too. I’ve never felt this comfortable around someone.”
Dean takes a breath and lets a little silence fall in between the lecture and his reply, “Pretty much the plan.”
Cas nods shakily, feeling Dean’s skin slip against his. Cas is ready. Dean maintains eye contact as he bites Cas’s lower lip, growling as he boxes Cas’s shoulders in with his arms. Cas grips tightly as Dean thrusts into him faster and harder than they have all night.
He gets on his knees and puts his face in the pillow, bending over and closing his eyes as he reaches around and pushes the tip of the lubed vibrator. He knows the rhythm, how slow he needs to go and how to work the vibrator in just right. It was all so expected and routine… Typically this consoled him and felt right, but now it was just dull.
While watching, Dean adds facts about the production while Cas can’t help but react to the violence on screen (sometimes grabbing on to Dean, who doesn’t mind in the least). Jack keeps shushing them both, completely engrossed in the film.
Castiel was a little taken aback by the sudden turn, but he kept face as he replied, “Chores, probably. Why?”
“Directions,” Cas says quickly. Jack’s head tilts curiously, opening his mouth with no doubt another question, but Cas cuts him off, walking away as he says, “I’m taking a break.”
This is all very well known to Cas and, although he is not in the habit of taking out the trash himself, he could do the run with a blindfold on.
He sets the mug in front of him and pulls back out the order pad once more. Asking with a more tense but similar tone as before, “Anything to eat?”
He finds Claire as she rounds the counter with a pile of dishes on a tray. He stops her briefly after putting in a rush order to Hannah, saying, “Hannah’s bringing out some to-go dishes, could you bring them to Jody and Donna in their car with some coffee?”
Castiel bit his lip; he could tell that Dean had lost his patience. Or perhaps not. Dean took a steadying breath and added one last time, “Please?”
Dean pulls away, sitting up on his knees with Cas’s legs spread in front of him. Cas wonders at what point he started feeling this comfortable being so exposed to Dean.
Dean’s skin was hot, as if he had a fever. But his muscles were strong and clenched under Castiel’s grip. Dean was slightly bigger too, making Castiel have to get up higher and closer on Dean in order to properly wrap his arm around Dean’s chest.
Dean’s brow furrowed, about to get up when his peripheral caught the movement of a shadow. His breath became shallow as he peeked over to the source next to the window. He immediately recognized Castiel’s silhouette.
Castiel could feel his heart in his throat and he felt terrified. He broke eye contact, taking the peas off the other side of his face as he sat up slowly. He said, “I should head back soon.”
He’s so swept away by having Dean fuck him that when Dean moves his hands away from Cas’s wrists he doesn’t try to get away, just wraps his arms around Dean’s back and holds on like his life depends on it. Dean grunts happily, letting up on Cas’s legs too, who promptly wraps them around Dean’s waist.
But Jack has his own place now, and it has been weighing on Cas to how much he really masturbates. His sex life isn’t healthy (or existent), but he does what he can in a small, nosy town like this. He doesn’t feel as if his community will disenfranchise him, he’s just fearful of any drama that may arise from Cas having a love interest.
Dean chuckled again, “That’s a delicate way of saying she’s an overbearing bitch, but okay. Huh, guess you really are a nice guy, Cas.”
Cas leaps off the bed and speeds to the door. His hand is on the handle, but he hesitates. Taking a deep, steadying breath, Cas attempts to clear his mind and fix his face with the most unassuming countenance he can muster.
Taking a deep breath, he sits up gingerly. The pain isn’t unbearable, but damn near close, so nothing broken per se. He sits up and looks around; his radio is smashed, the walkie talkie dangling from its coiled cord. He searches for his phone and finds it on the floorboard; no service. Finally he checks his wristwatch; almost half past four.
Dean caught himself leaning forward as his fingertips connected with Castiel’s lax jaw - the want to kiss Castiel had briefly overwhelmed his senses. But he couldn’t kiss Castiel while he was sleeping, that was just plain creepy. Still, though, Dean was already touching Castiel’s face.
Dean watched as he dared to let the back of the forefinger gently trace along the skin of Castiel’s face. His finger lightly traversed the sharp corners of his cheekbones, wandered over the pronounced brow, trailed down his flat ridge of his nose. He took a detour over the spot between the eye and nose, amazed at how soft the skin became. And his touch moved to Castiel’s lips…
Dean’s head whipped back to gape at Castiel’s back as he walked away, but his sight was cut off by Ash throwing Dean’s singlet in his face.
The sun has melted any shred of winter away. Dean had left in the early morning, and Cas hadn’t asked for his key back. But most importantly, he had been there to say goodbye to Dean. He didn’t know how to feel about how good it was to make out with Dean over coffee.
Jack smiles from ear to ear. Now that Dean looks at the kid without a lense of fury, he suddenly realizes that Jack and Cas actually share a lot of the same features. It’s really creepy in an uncanny way, but if it weren’t for the lighter hair and brown eyes, he would look just like the meek kid in the yearbook picture that was stowed away in Dean’s bag.
Dean puffs his stog and dares to peek up at Peterbilt. In all her glory, the entire image is utterly tragic. The cab is busted from the surface to deep within, the trailer is irreparably torn, and almost every tire needs to be replaced, not to mention the axles... Hell, it’s going to cost him at least $2,500 alone to get his rig towed. Ketch is going to blow his lid. Maybe he’ll lose his contract.
Dean’s breath caught and tried to measure his heart as he put on a poker face, turning back to Coach Singer and Castiel. He didn’t dare let his mind wonder if the Coach had just noticed what he’d done. Or worse, had somehow known what they’d done last night on the gym floor. Instead, Dean smiled nonchalantly to an ashamed looking Castiel and scowling coach as he approached them, “What’s up?”
Dean and Jack both turn to the owner of the familiar deep, rumbling voice: Cas. Dean tries not to completely blow up when he notices Cas’s moist bare chest under a towel he holds at the corner of his hip, body and hair still rolling with droplets of water. Cas is staring daggers back at Dean, and he feels a worthy challenger arises.
Dean wiped away the rest of the blood, saying thoughtfully, “The cut is pretty shallow. Head injuries always seem really bad because they bleed the most. Close your eye.”
Dean gets behind Cas’s ass, but his sore arms come up to cover Cas’s, fingers intertwining with his on the wall and moving them lower. He keeps moving forward so that he straightens Cas up, his chest now the one against Cas’s back. Dean's mouth finds Cas’s ear and nibbles at it as he moves his cock up and down against the length of Cas’s ass teasingly, still holding on to Cas’s splayed hands. The soft skin feels great against Dean’s member, and he whispers deeply against Cas’s ear, “Then we gotta be close. I’m still in bad shape, y’know. I gotta go slow...”
Dean looked shocked. Castiel bit his lip, figuring that he’d already messed up. But then Dean was kissing his cheek and Castiel felt like a puddle again.
“Mm,” Castiel thought, trying to remember the rules Dean had told him on the walk over. The memories were all fuzzy, though. Still, he rolled with it and gestured to Ash randomly.
The alley is enclosed, which is rare for a spread out middle American town. The building adjacent is owned by a tailor that only comes in for her specialty wears, like wedding dress modifications and the like. To Cas, it serves as a neighbor to cozy against his own establishment. Their roofs barely touch, creating a sort of shade from the elements above. The two older, similarly styled brick walls from each respective building frame a rectangular alley with only Cas’s exterior light from his side to illuminate the walk to the dumpsters that sits against the end of the wall. Between the service door and the dumpster is an exterior stairwell that leads up to Jack’s loft. And where the two buildings end is an opening to the great outdoors of Kansas’s wide, green planes.
“Yeah, I’ve applied to a bunch of places,” Jack replies, poking his fork at this plate, “But I’ll probably end up going to Kansas University.”
“You hear about that storm rolling in?” Donna asks in her midwestern drawl, cutting into the omelette Cas had brought her.
“Hey, Jack,” Cas starts, rubbing at his head that is beginning to form a harsh headache, “I’m going home for a bit and I won’t be back by the time you head out.”
Castiel watched as Coach Singer showed Dean how he’d start with his hands and knees on the mat as Raul came from behind and held him in the referee's position. Coach Singer called for another round; Dean tried to reach over, but Raul moved his leg away and pinned Dean down.
“Well, it doesn’t matter now,” Castiel’s hands were suddenly at Dean’s back. He jumped under the touch and he tried to get away once more, but Castiel’s hands were different from Drex’s; he pushed down firmly on Dean’s back, forcing him to stay as he kneaded into his skin.
Calling his name was less of a warning and more of a begging; wanting to know how something could ever possibly feel this good.
Dean’s wrist burned as it slid against the smooth skin of Castiel’s forearm. Dean was watching his shaking hand, eventually getting it out from between his face and Castiel’s skin. Castiel muttered and sighed at the loss of the mass there. Dean looked from his hand to Castiel to make sure he hadn’t woken up from the movement, but Castiel just buried his face into Dean’s pillow.
Cas huffs, frustrated Dean doesn’t know what he’s getting at, “It’s not like we’re… ‘dating.’ But, I suppose I’m realizing how much I don’t know about you.”
Dean tries not to panic, jumping to the conclusion that Cas has confided in his apparent son about their relationship while keeping Dean in the dark. He decides to act skeptical, “You do?”
The man doesn’t move, just eyeing the three of them. He lands on Cas, raising a brow at him, “Your hired protection goes grocery shopping for you, Castiel? Seems like a bit of a meathead, if you ask me.”
Dean sighs heavily, wanting to do anything but that. He’d refrained from letting Cas know what had happened for several reasons: one, it was actually shameful. Two, he thought it put him in a bad light that he didn’t have a job and was out on his luck. But both those reasons don’t matter anymore. He shakes his head softly, “You really want to know?”
“Yeah, yeah, I just…” Cas says, not being able to take his eyes off the mug in front of the trucker.
He let go of Castiel, as if just then realizing he had still been holding on to him. Dean rolled over and laid next to Castiel.
A gunshot echoes loudly, bringing the snarls to an end. The pain focuses and intensifies in a pinpointed spot. The heart’s been hit. The bullet’s still in there, a sharp lump around all the aortas that desperately try to supply blood to gushing wounds.
Cas is still silent, his racing mind finally landing on an idea… A sinister, awful idea. An idea that has his heart skipping and filling his mind so that it seems like there are no other ways to get a real rise out of Dean - to hurt him.
Dean looks away, feeling cornered. Dean mentally curses his own big mouth as he attacks in defense, “Why do you even care?”
“Dean-” Castiel’s voice was like sandpaper, rubbing Dean down and smoothing his edges. Dean’s hips moved of their own accord, wild and wanting. The waves of ecstasy washed over Dean, and he could feel his cock twitching as he came.
Cas pulls it away, “Hey, c’mon, it’s already late. You still have school tomorrow, and I have to get back to the diner.”
Dean has their bodies flush, his arm pushing against Cas harshly. Dean is so close Cas can feel his heavy breath tickle his lips. Cas holds his glare, lust exploding at the look of anger on Dean’s face.
Castiel merely cocked his brow. Dean sighed in submission and slowly rolled over so his aching back wasn’t on the terrible mattress, arms folded under his head.
“Does this sound familiar?” Meg asks before loudly and rhythmically pounding her fist against the bartop, calling out in a mockingly rough voice, “‘Oh, Dean! Dean, yes! Dean, you’re going to make me-’!”
He pressed the peas harder against his eye, trying to fight back the frustration swelling in his mind. He heard Dean sigh, “But an underclassman. So innocent.”
When Jo approached them, she slammed down four shot glasses on the table. Dean and Castiel looked from the glasses up to her. Castiel gulped thickly as she held up an unopened handle of vodka with a broad grin.
Dean looks away, ignoring his rising blush. He knew it had been a mistake to confide in Bobby that he’d reunited with Cas. He’d been kind enough to exclude the nitty gritty, but unfortunately that didn’t leave much else to tell. Dean had merely said it was casual, that he was just going with the flow and enjoying what he could. Bobby thought it was straight up weird.
Castiel needed to brace himself for the rest of the school year. Dean was with Asmod’s gang now, and he was Castiel’s first two periods, and may soon be wrestling too. Really, Castiel was doomed.
He sighs loudly with agony as he sends the text. Cas now does regret his time with Dean, because he wasn’t able to be there for his son. He trudges to the bathroom and begins cleaning himself of all this self loathing.
Cas counts quickly as Hannah and Bart come around with their personal belongings. They give one another proverbial pats on the back for a good day’s work and say goodnight. Finally, Cas is alone again. He exhales deeply, glad that he can take his time closing and get lost in methodical work of cleaning.
Peterbilt eats the asphalt and Dean effortlessly drives along. To pass the time, he sings along to the same twelve tracks, argues with the radio, talks on the CB, or looks down into passing cars to spy on traveler’s lives, imagining what their lives must be like. Occasionally a kid will pump their fist for a honk, and he happily obliges. And traffic inevitably comes and Dean sometimes crawls forward in a sea of cars for hours.
