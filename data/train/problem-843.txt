Sherlock’s eyes met with John’s eyes and the pair had a silent conversation. “If Papa goes downstairs with you, you can wait for Aunt Molly outside.”
‘Lock shifted himself closer to his Omega. “Runs in families. Always on the left hand. Not both partners get it. In fact, there’s only been two documented cases of spouses having Soul Marks that have defined shapes… Mostly, they’re just shapeless blobs.”
Rosie stood up, and walked over to her Daddy’s armchair. She kneeled down, and smiled kindly at him. “Daddy, Papa is right about you. You’re too tender-hearted.”
“Why would you be homeless? Mycroft’s got more money than many third world countries.” Sherlock wrinkled his eyebrows.
“All three of them, Mycroft. You’re a lucky man.” John said, with a small tight smile. “Also, Greg said ‘Tell him that the March sisters are happy to meet him’. So, don’t be afraid. Pick them up. Hold them. The nurse will be in shortly.”
“Myc’s known me my whole life. You’re still learning me.”  ‘Lock grinned, then reached out with his other hand. John reached out for the hand, studying it. There were dark lines clearly visible on ‘Lock’s palm.
John exited the bedroom, and wandered into the kitchen. Rosie glared at him and Sherlock cut his laughter off. “I, uh, apologize-”
John eagerly dug into gobbling down his meal, while Sherlock opened his tea and dipped his biscuits leisurely into it. He stared at John’s military-efficient eating before he spoke.
“I’ll get you something nice, John. Do you want to go back to MI-6, well now that you’re married again?”
“Prove it,” John looked at his husband, smiling. Angelo returned with John’s meal, and placed it in front of him.  John dug in. After a few minutes of silence, John glanced up to see Sherlock study him.
Sherlock smirked, and ruffled his own curls, but didn’t answer the question. John slipped his hand from Sherlock and crawled into the cab that pulled up. John turned his face towards the window, and turned to his thoughts.
Sherlock made brief eye contact with John before he turned back to the window. “I have four degrees in anything from Chemistry to Biological Engineering. I’ve been in uni since I was fifteen years old. I have filed for seventeen marriage exclusions. One for every year of university, and two extra since graduating with my final degree.”
A hushed conversation, and less than a 2 minute wait, and the British ambassador, himself, was walking over to Greg. “Mr. Holmes, it’s an esteemed honor to meet the man who finally snagged Mycroft.”
The man on the other line choked back a sob and cleared his throat. “If it was your daughter, wouldn’t you want to know?”
“It’s going to be a defined shape. It’s already more than just swirls.” John leaned forward for a kiss. ‘Lock leaned in and kissed him sweetly. “‘Lock, you and your kisses will be the death of me.”
John glanced at Sherlock and nodded. “Thanks for your assistance, Sherlock.” He waited for Mycroft to gather himself and let go of the wheelchair, then led the way to the operating room, opening the door for the two men.
“Do you miss Mary or do you miss the idea of a wife?” Ella asked in a soft voice, knowing that John was listening to her.
“The day you and Myc got married, I opened a trust fund account for them. I don’t know what all it’s doing, but there’s thousands of pounds in there and they’ll be able to buy a nice home or build a university. I did put a clause in there that they have to admit Uncle Sherlock is better than Dad, but.” Sherlock shrugged. “I’m the young brother. I get to be petty.”
“You’re nervous for your brother in law.” John comforted him, voice soothing. “Completely normal. He’ll do great.”
“John…” ‘Lock exhaled, as his right palm burned. He clenched it tightly, then shook it out. “Do you really mean it?”
Sherlock smirked, and headed back to the car to let the husbands enjoy themselves. It felt like less than a minute and the two lovebirds joined him. He glanced over his brother-in-law and the words
“Stop thinking so loudly,” Sherlock said, as he shut the door on the cab. The driver pulled away from the curb and Sherlock sighed. “Please don’t make another decision for me.”
“Give me my granddaughter and get out, acushla. I’m furious with you. Go, bréagadóir. I need time, and you need to meet your Alpha.”
“I’ll be down in about twenty minutes. I’m not on call this weekend, so I just want to finish my two charts.”
“Are you two ladies done gabbing? Let’s get tea!” Moran called down the hall to them disappearing into the cafeteria.
Sitting in front of the funeral home was a black SUV idling. John approached the car, and forced a smile and wave. The driver exited the SUV excitedly, and helped John get his daughter in the car before he helped John in himself.
“Sherlock,” John agreed, stepping past him. His eyes roamed the filthy room, and he carefully started walking through it.
"Mama! Why is that Omega in public without his husband?" Greg heard a little boy whisper to his mom.
A buzzing in John’s pocket told him his ride was waiting for him. He walked over to the funeral director. “I’d like to settle the bill.”
“John, please email the client with our enhanced COVID fees, and remind him that payment is due sooner rather than later,” Sherlock said in a brisk voice. “Also, there may be-”
“John,” Sherlock whined, as Rosie slid off him. She grabbed his wrist and started pulling it. “Your daughter is a beastie.”
“Again?” Mycroft asked, with a slight growl. A delicate sniff revealed nothing but the underlying fetus smell.  “Who fucked my husband?”
“Alright brother, let’s get you boys home.” She took the sign and slid it into the recycling as she led them to her car. She held the door open, while the boys climbed in. She settled in herself, and took off.
John sighed quietly, and thought What if it were Rosie? He shook his head, and scribbled aimlessly on his notepad.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, and took the toddler into his arms. “You don’t speak for me. I’ll hold my daughter whenever I want.”
John watched the kettle boil, but didn’t say anything and he listened to his daughter in the other room. He felt Abby leave his side, and knew she was watching Rosie.
John scrolled through his email on the phone, but didn’t click into them. Most of them were concerning his other job and those could wait.
“Why do you always fuss with that thing? You know, I could make you coffee.” ‘Lock wrapped the afgan around his shoulders.
He pulled his phone out again, and snapped a picture of baby number two. Again, he tucked his phone away. He scooped up the third baby, and looked at her lovingly.
“I’m not in my mind palace.” Mycroft laughed, pressing his lips to Greg’s neck. “I was thinking about how your arse always seems to find my cock when we’re snuggling.”
“Of course I am. I have been building their financial future since the day since you two got married.”
The Alpha looked him over with a steely look focusing on the slight bulge at his abdomen. “Your passport, right.” He rolled his eyes. “You just want your child to be born in Britain.”
The flight to America was as smooth as possible. John slept snuggled up against his Alpha, while ‘Lock himself got lost in his mind palace.
“Pardon me,” John sighed as he placed the phone down on his desk. He sighed loudly before he appeared at the door frame. “Stop it. Now,” John said sharply. “Oi! I’m on an important phone call and you lot are so noisy.”
“What do you mean?” John asked, with a sly glance. Sherlock was looking down at his hands and wringing his hands together.
“I agree, John, it’s completely less than ideal, and honestly you’ve had a really shitty run lately. I don’t know why I am worried about this…”
“The Beta ripped from asshole to navel after giving birth.” James laughed. “Well, a medicine man tried to perform a c-section. Watson here rushed in and saved the day.”
John kissed ‘Lock’s neck again, and settled in. Slowly he felt his Alpha drift off underneath him. John shifted his body to still be snuggling, but allowing ‘Lock’s body to move.
John smirked, and returned to his job application. John was so focused on the job application that he let the biscuits be stolen.
Greg stared at his husband with tears overflowing. “Please, Myc-” He asked, then threw himself into his husband’s arms, crying.
“I’m sorry, John. He really is a good man, but he gets so wrapped up in his family’s old school manners and who he thinks he should be.”
Slowly they made their way into the lobby of the private surgical facility. They were greeted by a pretty young aide in pale blue scrubs pushing a wheelchair. She chatted animatedly with them, and walked them to a patient room, leaving them there.
John took a deep breath, and fumbled for his phone. He blearily logged in, trying to even his breathing out. There were two text messages.
Greg climbed on top of his husband’s lap and swallowed the rest of Mycroft’s words down with a kiss that was feral, all teeth and tongue.
The tall thin man glanced over John and his daughter, then asked, “Why do you blame yourself for the embassy?”
“Why don’t you shower when we get up there, and then I will. After that, we’ll lay down on the bed and do some skin to skin.”  ‘Lock ran his hands down John’s back causing the older man to shiver a bit.
The husbands sat at the table, as Angelo waddled off.  “That’s not necessary,” John started to say, but stopped himself.
“Yes, I did,” John agreed, watching the lines of his husband’s back move. John made his way to his armchair, and sat quietly in it. “How shall I make it up to you, my love?”
“Is there anywhere to get tea?” Sherlock asked, before the two service men could continue their conversation. “John’s hungry, but won’t admit it.”
John stood up on his tip-toes and kissed the man’s cheek. “Next time I’m in Central City, I’ll look you up, Flash.”
“She’s yours.” John confirmed with a nod. He pulled his cell phone out of his pocket, snapped a quick picture and put it away again.
"Hes out in public because he's either unclaimed or a whore, darling. Shame! Shame! Don’t make eye contact. He’s probably a thief as well. Hmph!" The mom answered with hate in her voice.
‘Lock pressed the emergency button on the elevator halting it as they went up. ‘Lock very calmly turned his Omega to face him, and ran his hands from the shoulders to the wrists. “I know you hate traveling… Why don’t we lay in the bed and practice some skin to skin before we start our vacation?”
The driver passed the building and pulled into the garage. Two tall figures dressed in black were waiting for John and his daughter. The driver slammed the car into park and jumped out to help John out of the SUV.
Greg grinned at Sherlock, and glanced over his shoulder at Mycroft. “I don’t need luck. I’ve got a skilled surgeon.”
“So the truth is, you’re not broken. You’re healing, and healing hurts like a bitch. The wound is there, but it’s like the skin healed over the wound that just grew down and out. Now you have to rip off healthy skin and get rid of the bad tissue before you can heal again.”
“Greg, I must say these girls are beautiful. You did a good job,” John said, as he switched the second baby for the third baby. John cradled the second baby for just a minute before he placed her in with her sister.
“Mr. Holmes, I’m sorry, but I need to get your Omega’s measurements,” the stylist said, in a low, slow voice with just a hint of southern twang.
“You must enunciate, acushla,” John instructed, picking up a biscuit. “Would you like a biscuit?” Rosie slid off the chair, and giggled out a “oop!” before she ran over to her dad with her hand out.  “Manners!”
Mycroft wrapped his arms around his hurting Omega, his husband, the man he loved most in the world and pressed him tight to his chest. “I’m so sorry I wasn’t there, my Gregory. I’m so sorry.” Mycroft kissed his husband-his Omega- his soul in another’s body, and settled into his thoughts as Greg cried. “My darling Gregory, I’m so sorry.” Mycroft apologized again, whispering it in his ear.
That night as Greg laid curled into Mycroft’s arms, “Who will love Sherlock?” came floating to the front of his mind.
Sherlock laughed, and moved her hands to his mouth. He kissed each one before she lowered them down to her side. “I have never forgotten Syph at home. I don’t intend to start now.”
Mycroft Holmes paced on the tarmac as if that would bring his beloved Gregory home sooner. His brother stood with him, bundled up to the nose in his wool Belstaff and blue scarf. “Myc, stay still.” Sherlock said, dryly, watching his brother pace.
John scowled at his Alpha, and muttered, “I should get up. How did you talk me into sleeping on the couch?”
‘Lock stared at their joined hands while he thought about what John asked. Absentmindedly he flexed his right hand. “Don’t give up on me?” he finally asked.
had cut it off him and thrown the pieces into a fire. He ran his fingers over the scar that used to be his soul mark.
John Watson had his arms full of his daughter and her supplies as he eased his way into his grandmother’s flat door open. “Nan?”
“Are you pinching the bridge of your nose? Knock it off. My wife is dead.” John asked, wiping the tears off his cheek.
“But not the person who mattered the most to me,” John said, evenly. Rosie held her arms out to Sherlock. “No, acushla.”
“You’re fighting a losing battle with that boy,” Greg said, resting his hands on his stretched abdomen.
“I can’t afford rent elsewhere,” John said, as the three men made their way down the steps to the lunch room.
“I liked it, and I hoped to do it with you one day.” ‘Lock announced, shyly. “I’ve researched it a bit more since the last time.”
John laughed, “American? Oh, that arsehole! He hates my American procedures and my British attitude of “get out of my way”.”
“You have access to MI-6 records,” John stated. “You looked me up too. You were probably bored this morning-”
“He was really good in bed,” John sighed, then touched Sherlock’s arm again. “The base was a lonely place. Part of me thinks I knew there was no future, but when you could die at any moment, the future means nothing.”
“I wish there was, Mr. Holmes. We’ve already reviewed palette colors and his height, but I need to measure his feet and his sleeve-”
Sherlock sighed, as he snapped his violin case close. Sherlock whirled around and pointed his bow at John accusingly. “Watson, my boy, you owe me a debt!”
Suddenly the slam of the bedroom door, and a shout of “Daddy! Papa’s attacking me with flour!” interrupted John’s train of thought.
John turned the faucet on, and rinsed his hands ignoring how his heart hammered in his chest. “I’m not your Omega. I nev-”
“Well, Nan, I’ll have to check with my Alpha about that,” John said, as he took a sip of tea, casually.
Ella Johnson finished pulling her dreads back into a ponytail. She turned on her professional but caring face. “Good afternoon, John. Thank you for taking this time to invest in yourself.”
“Wish I could say the same, sir. These agents are right bastards.” Greg cast them a filthy glance, then turned back to the ambassador. “Regardless, I need to get home. I’ve been away for far too long.”
“Oh, hell yeah. Let’s have some babies.”  Greg huffed, his eyes bright, then glanced up at the door.
John kissed the offered palm, and grinned, “I wish it would hurry up and take shape. I’m excited to see what it becomes.”
“Ah. That sounds like Myc.”  ‘Lock nodded, then pulled his cell phone out of his pocket. Quickly he shot off a text to his brother.
He opened his eyes and focused on the counter in front of him. It had a desk and bullet proof glass that was all scuffed up.
“Mr. Hudson was a very bad man, and he hurt Hudders. So I did what I had to do to keep my pack safe,” Sherlock said, nonchalantly. “Now, that pack includes you and Rosie.”
John nodded his head, a bit surprised at how smart Rosie is. “You’re gonna change the world, remember?”
I love you guys. Chapter 7 is at my beta (who's having computer issues) and I have most of nine done, but none of 8. Because my ADHD kicked in and now the BOYS MUST DO THIS OR I'M NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON ANYTHING ELSE.....
John elbowed him, then turned back to Greg. “Please excuse us. So Greg, this is my surgical nurse, Patrick Moran. He and I used to work together back in Germany and then again in Afghanistan.”
Greg had reached the end of his patience. “Stop being such a meddling nosy fucker and be the caring man I know you are. Be the man who changed the country’s laws to join my life. Remember why I choose you. Remember what I asked you for. Just remember what I deserve. Do I need to remind you what I left behind? Do I need to show you pictures of the bruises and marks that so often littered my skin?”
“Graham’s never going to willingly leave his job,” Sherlock scoffed, handing Mycroft a cup of coffee.
A loud text tone woke John Watson up hours later. He fumbled with his phone in his pocket to get it to his eye level. Blurry eyed he looked at the screen, but couldn’t make it out. ‘Lock twitched in his sleep knocking the phone out of John’s hand. “You arse,” he huffed, as he fumbled for it.
“I know I do, but I don’t know how to work it,” John admitted peevishly. “Besides, you’re the work horse on this team. I’ve spent decades trailing after your father-”
“Yay, thank you Daddy!” Rosie said, launching herself at John. John wrapped his arms around her neck and gave her an extra squeeze. “Be a good girl, Rosie Josie.”
“Oh, Mother-” Bethany started to complain, but a stern look from John quieted her. “Johnny Watson, I’ll never know what goes on in that head of yours. You are a dreadful child.”
Greg sighed, then cleared his throat. “Please, call my husband, Mycroft Holmes.” Greg looked at the Alpha, but didn’t see any sort of recognition at the mention of his husband’s name. “Get a phone. You need to dial internationally.”
“Goodbye, Mr. Miller. Please get the information to me as soon as possible,” John said politely before he hung up his cellphone. John placed it on the charger, and stood up. He stretched his body out, and sighed.
Sherlock grabbed a package of ginger snaps, and a hot tea for himself. John took a full meal, two snacks, water, and a hot tea from the commissary. They walked to the cashier, and John paid for them both before Sherlock could protest. There was a table near the exit, and they sat down together.
Sadly, John placed the framed photo back on the dresser, and glanced at his daughter who was sleeping peacefully. John went back downstairs, and ducked into the living room. “Nan? I’m heading out.” Abby nodded, and turned the page in her magazine. “Ro’s sleeping.”  no response from his grandmother. “I can’t believe you kept all those old pictures of James and I.” John watched his grandmother not respond to him. “Well, I love you Nan.”
Sherlock glanced over at his brother as they rode in a sleek town car to the private hospital, and made a childish face. Sherlock was feeling a bit stroppy about being left behind with his pregnant brother when there were things he could help Dr. Watson achieve.
“I’m worried about Sherlock.” Mycroft admitted quietly, then added, “I want him to have this. What you and I have. I want him to have a spouse- a partner in crime. An Omega to care for. He’s really an affectionate child.”
The little girl giggled, and hugged her Dad around his neck. John held her close to his chest, and whispered, “Daddy loves you, acushla.” In response, she grabbed a fistful of his jacket and tugged.
John’s smiled slid from genuine to polite. “Major Sholto and I were never engaged. In fact, he was married the entire time we were together. Thank fuck, I was never stupid enough to get pregnant, but you’d have known that if you had kept in touch.”
“Oh my goodness!” John exclaimed, switching back to Daddy mode. He grinned at his daughter, and she grinned back. “Is breá liom tú, acushla.”
“Oh, Watson’s so fucking far from perfect. Fantastic OB, but he’s so bossy. He doesn’t let anything go. If you forget to count the sutures once--”
John cleared his throat in an attempt to stave off a fight. “Does that machine tell you anything about Hurricane Sadie?”
For just a moment, he held the jumper to his chest, and breathed deeply. Under the wool, he could almost smell him. John shook his head, and pulled the jumper over his head. He grabbed a pair of socks from the drawer, and headed out to the living room.
John stared at Sherlock a moment more before giving a slightly mystified shrug. His eyes glinted with sudden mischief.
is so important that I can’t even mourn my own wife?” John snarled, hot tears welling up in his eyes.
Quietly, John whispered, “You are the best thing about this life, Sherlock Holmes. I love you so much more than I ever thought possible.”
“Of course, I am!” John shouted, then glanced over to him. “Sherlock,” He sighed. “I am sick of not having a job. I am bored of being at home all the time. I am exhausted of playing maid.”
“Alright, Greg, let’s do this. We’re going to deliver those babies. I’m going to hang up a privacy shield, and we’ll bring the babies around for you to cuddle for a moment.”
“An Omega slut like you having a mother.” The  Alpha laughed, then called to his friend, “Amir, Greg here says that he has a mother.”
“Dear girl, your Daddy feels it is too personal for you to investigate it with us. I, however, disagree because-”
‘Lock nodded, thinking. “The one turned out to be a very convincing hoax, but by the time it was discovered, one of them was dead. I mean, it’s Russia, so they probably froze to death. The other was from Argentina in the early 1900’s. The Alpha had three dots going up his left ring finger, and the beta had the same three dots. The photographs are a bit blurry, but they’re legitimate.”
Rosie laughed, as she entered into her fathers’ bedroom. In a sing-songy voice she said, “Come on, Papa. Let’s get baked!”
Greg slid himself off Mycroft’s lap with a thud, then looked at him with worry clearly written on his face, “What about Sherlock? Who’s going to take care of him?” Greg started crying again, and Mycroft pulled his husband’s head to his chest.
“Daddy!” Rosie groaned. “It’s a cell phone. You have one too, you know. Uncle Myc made sure of it when I went to America.”
“No, love. I can’t sleep anymore. I’ll hold you.” John offered, gathering up the container and spoon. John went out to the kitchen and got waters out of the fridge. He carried three of them to the living room before he carefully maneuvered around ‘Lock’s legs to sit. John handed him a water bottle, and sipped his own cautiously. He then reached for the food. Mindlessly he tuned into the ‘Blue Planet’ episode on BBC.
John Watson ran his fingers over his suit, in an attempt to smooth out the wrinkles. His eyes roamed over to the 13-month-old toddler that was being passed from his Nan to his sister then back to the closed casket where his wife lay. He squeezed his eyes close, trying to stave off the incoming tears. He sniffed loudly, as a squeaky little voice called, “Dada!” John quickly wiped his eyes before he swung around to his little girl. He held his arms out for her, and she snuggled into his arms.
“Of course he’s my friend,” John responded without thinking, annoyance clear in his voice. John picked up his tea mug and took a sip, trying to remain calm.
“So it must have been Fantasticland in 2017,” Rosie said, pulling her phone out. “According to Google-”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and said sarcastically,  “Oh no! Gasp! My big brother sleeps naked with his pregnant husband!”
“You’re fascinating,” Sherlock announced. “Angelo! Bring us some gypsy tart!”  Sherlock took a sip of water. “Tell me about your wife.”
John set to work, increasing the medication as necessary, before he carefully cut down Greg’s abdomen. Slowly and carefully, he freed each child. Dr. Rami spent time cleaning and caring for them as they came out and laid them in their cot.
John laughed, and pulled his daughter into a hug. “Good thing, I already spoke to Auntie Molly and Uncle Greg about taking you. They have a room starting tonight, and-”
“I’m ready whenever Dr. Watson is.” Mycroft smiled, like a wolf trying to reassure a sheep he wasn’t hungry.
“Figure out my address and pick me up at 10 a.m.,” John said, before he ducked around Sherlock and went back to his surgery.
“I’ve got more money than the British bank,” Sherlock said, leaning forward to pluck the menu away from John. He placed it to the side with his own. He picked up his phone, typed something, and then smiled widely at John. “You’ll never have to work again. I don’t want to have sex. Really John, you could do worse.”
Once the plane landed, ‘Lock gently woke his Omega up and helped him off the plane. They cleared Customs quickly. They left the unloading area and made their way to the baggage claim.
A joyful shout of “Thank you! Thank you!” came just before the other man shed more tears. “You have no idea what this means to me!”
Mycroft’s eyes scanned the outside of the plane to see if he could see Greg. He threw his arms around Sherlock’s neck, kissed him on the forehead, and ran over to the steps that were lowering.
“You teased me! You-” Rosie gasped, pulling her hand away from Sherlock’s hand. “ You said that I was just a little girl and Daddy wouldn’t let me travel there.”
“I’m the Alpha, John,” Sherlock said, as he handed the driver cash. John nodded, realizing his faux pas.
John rubbed his face and rolled over into the warm body next to him. He turned his face away to stifle a sob in his pillow.
to ask Mrs. Hudson to make you tea?” John kicked one of his trainers off, and then the other. He picked one up and stumped off to the kitchen. He grabbed a beer from the fridge and came back. He flopped down on his chair and put his trainer on the arm. He popped the beer open, and took a deep draught.
John smiled at that, and fussed with the collar on his shirt.  “Rosie, why don’t you go see if Mr. Sid will give you some sweets?”
John smiled, realizing that Sherlock knew he had looked him up at some point. “It said ‘The World’s Only Consulting Detective’ but that’s not a job title.”
“Johnny,” the voice expressed in a disappointed tone. “I made it so we could be together, and yet, you still thwart me. When are you going to be the good Omega I know you are?”
“Any further questions, Greg?”  Greg shook his head in. “And did you sign the consent forms already?”
Sherlock blinked at John, and burst out with a laugh. “No one’s ever been brave enough to ask me to my face.”
“Holmes here.” He heard his husband say for the first time in 3 months. Greg cleared his throat, trying to push the emotions he was feeling away, but failed.
John exhaled a bit before he continued, “Thank you for coming into my life.”  ‘Lock snuffled in his sleep. “The engagement ring on my finger is fantastic, but the best bit is that blob on your hand that you hate. It’s going to be something. It’s going to be a part of us. I think it’s the beginning of us.” John pressed his Soul Mark against ‘Lock’s bare chest. “I’m not like you, ‘Lock, I’m not well-spoken like you are, but this is everything.”  John nodded against his Alpha. “Thank you for loving me.”
“Yes, please.” Greg nodded. “You brought them in safely, you’ll make sure they get to Papa Myc and Uncle ‘Lock safely.”
Sherlock stopped pacing to dash off to the book shelf. He pulled one of his home made tomes down to page through it. “Ah, yes, Fresno. I thought the name sounded familiar.” Sherlock took his tome over to where his daughter sat and perched on the arm of the chair. “Johnny Fresno is an Iranian-American businessman who’s mostly interested in the amusement industry. He has spent several years-”
“I love skin to skin,” John murmured, as he wrapped his arms around his Alpha’s waist. John buried his nose in the crook of ‘Lock’s neck and breathed deeply. Scent of sweat, the earth, and tobacco. “When did you have tobacco? You always smell like it, but you never seem to have it.”
As he walked past his trainers, John snagged them on his way to his chair. John sat down, and started putting his socks on.
“Yes, Dr. Rami. Fine with me.” Greg said, as he handed John his third daughter. John placed her gently in with her sisters, before he patted Greg’s arm in comfort.  “Dr. Watson, can you tell Papa Myc one thing for me?”
John stared at the retreating figure, and made a decision in an instant. He ran out of the flat, and down the stairs. His heart racing. He threw the door open, and paused to find his target, “Hey! If you’re going to retrieve him, I’m coming with you.”
John sniffled, and wiped the tear out of his eye before he scooped up baby number two. He placed her in Greg’s other arm, and took the first baby back. John smiled at her and cooed, then placed her gently in her cot.
John thought ruefully, as he felt his pocket go off. He shifted his daughter to the other arm, and pulled his phone out.
Mycroft stared at his husband’s face, lightly tracing over the scar of the soul mark on his left ring finger. “It’s so frustrating. No one gets soul marks anymore, and you get one, and they steal it from you.”
“Tá tú suite orm, Acushla!”  Abby shouted, startling Rosie into tears. John put his teacup down, and scooped her up. He held out her cup to her and she hid her face in his shoulder.
John popped the lid off the soup and stirred it. John let the odor waft over to the sleeping man. ‘Lock rolled back towards John, and pushed his eyes open. “Did you say soup?”
Sherlock squeezed his brother’s hand. “Well, go get your man. What are you waiting for?” Sherlock asked.
‘Lock stalked around the suite, and found it to his satisfaction. The rooms were cleaner than clean, and it was decorated in a modern way. ‘Lock opened the door out to the balcony before he pulled his suit jacket off. He slung it on the back of the nearest chair and pulled his shoes and socks off. He placed them by the door like he did at home.
“I do.” Greg agreed, zipping up his coat, and smoothing it out. “Listen, my name is Gregory Holmes-”
John cut his own thoughts off with a sigh, “Fancy a cuppa?” he turned to the stove and started making tea. Abby came over to the stove, and placed her calming hands on John’s busy ones.
“American, obviously, Papa. If it had been an English girl, he never would have started the way he did.”
“You do. I only fell back to sleep because I was still not feeling my best.” ‘Lock pulled his legs back to his body and tucked his chin on top of his knees.
“Yes, of course you will,” John agreed soothingly. “Now, won’t you join me in our chairs-” Sherlock closed the gap between them, and flopped down in John’s lap. John laughed with pure glee as his husband wiggled into a comfortable position. Rosie appeared with the tea for her fathers, and her own iced coffee. She placed the two steaming mugs down on the table next to her Daddy’s chair. She flopped into her Papa’s armchair.
“Not enough for my Omega,” Lock murmured, kissing the top of John’s hand, before he began fiddling with the older man’s engagement band. “Did you really mean to propose to me?”
“He-” ‘Lock started, then shook his head. “He proposed to me and made it a terrible evening. I know that you don’t intend to rape me, or force me-”  ‘Lock bit his lip. “I love you, John. I love you in a way that I never loved Victor. You never once… I just- I’m trying. To love you my best. And I’m not very good at it.”
An elderly lady wearing a smart suit opened the door. “Oh, Sherlock!”” she called excitedly, turning away from John. “Your Omega is here!” She turned back to John, and smiled politely. “Come in, come in. he’s upstairs in B. up those stairs just there.”  She stepped out of his way, and shut the door firmly behind John. A gentle hand touched his shoulder.
“I wish I had met you years ago. After Victor and I parted ways, I was so lonely. I saw all these Alphas and Omegas or Alphas and Betas together. I’d watched Molly Hooper meet five different Alphas, and marry one. I watched my big brother, my favorite person, my only friend for so many years, meet Greg and marry him. I watched them get pregnant.”  ‘Lock paused, clearing his voice.
“Will you look at me?” ‘Lock asked. John looked up meeting his Alpha’s eyes. “Thank you so much for coming away with me.”
John shook his head, “Just important in the way you are to us.” John slid into a seat at the kitchen table.
“John, no personal attacks,” Ella said gently. “We both know you’re the better educated of the two of us.”
John smiled into his cup of tea, before he took a sip of tea. “American. She worked at an amusement park and died there-”
“It’s so hard to be you, Sherlock Holmes.” John stumbled over to the counter to poke at the coffee pot.
John held his free hand out to Sherlock, before shaking it. “You’re no better. Your brother said, “danger” and you’re here.”
“Robert Miller. Speaking,” A pause which John heard muffled, “Yeah, thanks. As soon as I’m finished with this phone call I’m all yours.”
“John,” Sherlock said, touching his arm gently. “Thank you so much for bringing my nieces safely into this world. It means more to us than I can say.”
“Yes, dear,” Sherlock sighed, standing up and brushing his Bellstaff off. He reached down to help John stand up, and pulled him to his feet. “You ok, John?”
Sherlock helped Greg stand to transfer from chair to bed. He looked at Greg, and smiled. “Are you ready to pop those brats out?”
After the babies were free, John glanced at the resident to his left and smiled. “Dr. Rami, would you please start work on the hysterectomy while I talk to our patient?”
“Yeah, I’m good, Sherlock,” John said, as he looked Sherlock over. “You’ve gained some weight.” Sherlock looked John over, and smirked.
“Of course I don’t,” John said forcefully. “My wife isn’t even cold yet and he’s fucking-” John cut himself off, and wiped more tears away. “Jesus fucking christ, Mycroft. What can I do?”
“Oh, Daddy, stop. You’re just fine!” Rosie grinned, as she turned to start her Daddy’s tea, and her own iced coffee. “Is this new case really important?” Rosie grabbed two ceramic mugs down, and a tumbler with a lid.
“Race you!” he shouted, as he took off. Sherlock ran after him and only managed to overtake him when John stumbled. Sherlock grabbed his hand and tugged him along.
“Hey, hey.” Mycroft said, trying to break into his thoughts. “Can I hold you tonight? Tomorrow we’ll worry about fixing it.”
“I refused James several times before Mary.” John interrupted Mycroft. “You don’t have to remind me that his spouses died suspiciously. I know more about that man then you do. Also,” John started, but stopped to adjust his grip on his flailing daughter. Sherlock rolled his eyes, and pulled her into his arms. John sighed, but let him. “I just buried my wife. I have a mourning period, as is customary.”
“Nan, you’re the first person I’ll call. I swear to you. Please go home.”  John leaned into the warm hand and closed his eyes momentarily. “Thank you, Nan. I’m so glad you could come.”
Rosie laughed, and kissed the tip of his nose. “I’ll email Mr. Miller and let him know we are taking the case. As for the fee, I’ll say whatever he feels comfortable with sending us is acceptable.”
John nodded his head, and quickly kissed Sherlock’s cheek before he sat down at his desk. The smile on John’s face didn’t fade all night.  John burned through his charting and made it downstairs just as Rosie, Molly, and Greg were pulling away. Sherlock turned around and saw John exiting the building. His entire face softened, and happiness twinkled in Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock slammed his book close, and stood up. The cell phone clattered to the floor as Sherlock stamped into the bedroom. He slammed the door.
Abby shuffled off with the toddler in her arms and made idle conversation. John watched them go, before he opened the smartphone.
“Ah, yes, we should return to him.” John smiled kindly at Sherlock. “Sorry to interrupt you, love, but I’ve eaten something now. I say it’s time to deliver some babies.”
John Watson clicked off the video visit in front of him and sighed. He had a few minutes until it was time for his therapist to call and do a video consultation.
John reached over to feel if it really was a dream. There was a warm, hard body near him. The heat they were throwing off was stifling.
“Goodbye, Ella.” John turned the video chat off, and pulled up one of the charts from earlier today.
John nodded, and leaned his face against Sherlock’s chest. His Alpha wrapped his arms around John, and held him for a while. “Yes,” John finally whispered. “I want more children.”
“Oi!” John said, with a mouthful of food. “Sherlock was talking, Moran. Don’t be a little bitch. Wait your turn.”
“It’s not weird. Just let me think about it, before we do anything,” ‘Lock said, thinking hard about it.
“She was stuck in Fantasticland during Hurricane Sadie. So, I’m sure she’s dead, but no one can tell me how. I just-”
“The Science of Deduction, John. It’s my website. You should look it up.” Sherlock smirked, as he followed Moran down the hall.
“It’s John!” John hissed, fumbling with his phone. He looked around, and saw his Nan. He made his way over to her, dodging the few remaining mourners. “Nan? Can you hold my daughter for a mo’?”
“I want your knot.” Greg panted, breaking the kiss, leaning back so he could see his Alpha’s eyes. “Please, Myc, claim me again-”
“They won’t. They stopped looking years ago. Well,” Robert exhaled loudly. “They never looked, truthfully. They just assumed.”
“You’re correct, but your brother sent over fifty-seven pages of information on the company.”  John stood up from the laptop and stretched.
Rosie grinned as she stood up, “I’m brilliant, remember! Are you going to go make up with Papa or shall I get him stoned?”
Sherlock studied John, and finally shook his head. “Next time we go for a walk, I’ll point out all the queer folx.”
“Rosie, baby,” John said, stepping towards her. “You know how Papa gets when he doesn’t have a case on-” Sherlock kissed the top of his daughter’s head, then John’s, before he disappeared into the living room.
“Yes, I am.”  Greg confirmed. “I was in the local ER for a concussion, and they ran a pregnancy test.”
The man stood up, and took John’s hand. John walked him past Mycroft and down the seventeen steps to the street level. “I’m sorry about him. He’s my roommate’s brother. He loves to ruin lives.”
‘Lock cleared his throat, then smirked, “Avia and I spent years telling him I was an Omega so he’d stop being a pompous arse. It worked.”
“I didn’t know that story.” Moran laughed out loud as he pushed his plate away from him. “But, I have to tell you, it doesn’t surprise me. Watson always did have a thing for a man in power. First, the real Doctor on the base, then your second C.O., and of course the commander of the base. That was just Afghanistan, so I can’t imagine what a ho you were in Germany with Americans about. Everyone knows Americans are extremely easy.”
Sherlock nodded his head, and leaned in to kiss John again. John eagerly leaned into the kiss, and grabbed a fistfull of curls.
“Yes.” Greg nodded, and glanced up as Mycroft entered the room, pushing a wheelchair. “Myc, you alright? Ready to be a dad?”
. You will let your obsession with his future go, and you will focus on your duty to me, Alpha. I am your responsibility and I need your support now more than ever. This is my third pregnancy…. As you know, we were here once before and it ended poorly. So-”
‘Lock used his foot to knock John’s phone out of John’s hand. “You should view that e-mail on the laptop anyway.”
Sherlock glanced over at John and rolled his eyes. “I’m going to find Myc,” he announced then departed the room.
“Mr. Holmes,” Moran said, with a grin. “I’m going to take Dr. Watson and show him our operating theatre. Dr. Watson, if you would follow me.”
Soon John’s breathing evened out, falling into a steady rhythm. ‘Lock nuzzled close to his Omega and whispered thoughts that have been in his mind for weeks.
“She used to be my Nanny. I helped her during some trouble with her husband a few years ago. He was sentenced to be put to death.”
John cleared his screen, threw his phone down. He heard the toilet flush, so he made a grab for his pj bottoms. He pulled them on, and leaned back against the headboard.
“What if Papa packed Staph instead?” John asked, in a teasing manner. He finished his tea, and handed the empty cup to Sherlock. Sherlock put it up on the desk.
“I think you said something about crap telly and Angelo’s?” John walked over to Sherlock, awkwardly. Sherlock smiled, and held his hand out for a taxi-cab.
Sherlock didn’t respond, but kissed John on top of his head as he walked by. Rosie appeared in the doorway and grinned at her Daddy. “Did it work?”
“You get my last name, my money, a safe place to raise our- your daughter.” Sherlock paused a moment before he added,  “Most of all, protection from Sholto.” Sherlock bounced Rosie on his hip while he talked. “Would you like to be a Holmes, little girl?
Rosie put both her hands on either side of John’s face and pressed them together. “I’m going to be a melittologist, I need to see all the bees I can, Daddy.” Rosie removed her hands from John’s cheeks, and kissed his forehead. “‘Sides, Daddy. Uncle Greg is going and he loves Auntie Mol and I.”
“Oh, John! Of course I’ll hold my acushla.” Abby Watson held her arms out for Rosie, who John easily transferred into her arms.
“I could say the same thing for you Mycroft Holmes,” Greg called back before he ran down the steps. He jumped off the bottom two steps and threw himself into Mycroft’s arms. “I’ve missed you so much, darling.”
“Myc,” Lock announced, then ruffled his curls. “When.” He started, struggling to sit up. Finally ‘Lock was in an upright position before he chugged an entire water bottle. “When I was little, our cook would make us that soup when we had a sick day. We found this crappy little Indian place by my old apartment and basically Myc bought it… I know it’s stupid, but it’s my favorite.”
“Congratulations Alpha and Omega. You are now registered as one family. Go forth and repopulate this Earth.” The marriage podium whirred off, and the lights in the room lit the exit path.
Sherlock smiled, and picked Rosie up to talk to her. “Would you like to be a Holmes, also, little one?”
Sherlock studied his new Omega and quite liked what he saw. The man was obviously intelligent enough to keep up with him, and for a moment-a very tiny one- he was grateful his big brother knew him so well.   “Dinner?” He asked, crisply.
“Lost husband. Need to send :  Xanax 0.5mg TID #30 0 refill. Son is helping with her medical needs. Needs psych referral. Check narc database.”
“Your Uncle Mycie said that,” Sherlock pointed out. “I said that Canterbury is far too long for you to walk.”
John counted them. Sometimes it was to ground himself after a nightmare and other times it was to slow his racing mind.
“Ah,” the tall brunet started, but stopped when there was a sharp knock on the door. It squeaked open and soon a man dressed in a sharp suit entered the room.
“This is cleaned up,” Sherlock said, blandly, glancing around. He picked up a few books, and shoved them in the nearest box.  “There’s an attic upstairs and I thought we could split it in half for you and her.”
“It’s true,” the cab driver spoke up. “Me Nan’s a giant lesbian and she’s like seventy. She’s been divorced three times!”
John gasped as his eyes flew open. In the dim light of the room, his eyes struggled to adjust. In a moment, he could see the ceiling tiles well enough to count them.
John smiled sadly, before he hugged his grandmother tightly. “Thank you for last night. I really appreciate you coming to the funeral.”
John nodded, before he pushed the cot out of the room. “Say goodbye to daddy!” he said to the girls, as he carefully guided them down the hall. John stared at these three miracles that he’d helped bring into the world, and felt overwhelmed again. He allowed himself a moment to mourn for his daughter,
Greg laughed, and placed a calming hand on his husband’s arm, “Don’t panic, love. He’s being sarcastic.”
John sighed, and ran his fingers through his hair. “Rosie, stop whining. Sherlock, get off your arse and do it unless you want to call a client-”
“We don’t do missing persons cases,” John stated evenly. He picked up his biro and started doodling in the margins. “Especially because that’s something local cops can handle.”
“Because I was on duty. I wasn’t supposed to be drinking, but I’d just filled out my first death certificate and the older medical staff tried to ease my pain. So I hid and when he found me, I vomited in his face.”
Rosie was too happy to be annoyed with her Daddy. She hugged him around the neck and said, “Does Papa already know this?”
John glanced up at Sherlock, and watched his mind shift through what he should do next. He turned the kettle off and made two cups of tea. John took his gratefully, and sighed happily. Sherlock joined them on the floor, and Rosie reached over to take Sherlock’s hand. John switched his tea from one hand to the other as Rosie crawled off his lap to sit in between her fathers. Rosie took John’s empty hand.
“You’re going?” Mycroft inquired, as his brother exited the car. He pushed the button to lower the window, and shouted, “you should!”
“No, I came here to tell you that you have twenty-four to forty-eight hours until he’s home and returned to his precious Baker Street.”
“Fine,” John said, his nostrils flaring. “You call Mr. Miller back and tell him that you’re going to charge him actual money to investigate the death of his daughter.” John pulled his phone out of his pocket, and tossed it gently to Sherlock. Rosie caught it and laid it on Sherlock’s lap. “Go on, call him back. Tell him the price of his daughter’s life is-”
Rosie laughed, and sipped her coffee. “Daddy, tell us about this case. Papa and I will decide if we can take it.”
“Fuck Tex!” John laughed, his eyes crinkling up at the corners.  “Anyway, I’m so glad it’s you. I need a man like you by my side for this one.”
‘Lock lowered himself onto the bed, and moved his body close to John’s. He wrapped his arms around him, and held him close. ‘Lock kissed the back of John’s neck, but didn’t rouse him further.
“The audacity!” Mycroft tried to sound affronted, but his eyes were too busy scanning the sky for his husband.
“Sherlock,” Greg said, gentle, waiting for Sherlock to lazily turn towards him. Finally Sherlock made eye contact with Greg. “There is
“I know what I signed up for joining MI6, then I met you and everything in my world shifted. The danger became less fun. The physical aspect of it reminded me of taking your knot. The mental part started to bore me. It was nothing-
“Oh, Johnny!” Abby smiled at her grandson, and clapped her hands in glee.  “I knew Jimmy would find you! He’s always had such a crush on you.”
John sat in the cab on the way to the flat at Baker Street, counting on his fingers as he rode. He was thinking about his life with Mary and how it was as close to perfection.
“I guess you’ll just have to count the nights that I have a sock tied to the door,” John said, before he walked away from Sherlock. “You coming ‘Lock?”
Rosie glared at Sherlock meanly, but took his hand again. “Did we stop by to pick up Daddy before we went to Aunt Molly’s?”
“Because I wrote these books,” Sherlock replied simply. “JF has a wife, three children including his heir to the park, Ritchie, and both parents live-”
“Oh!” Sherlock said, as he dusted his hands off. “Hudders said that she’d rent ‘C’ to us too if your Nan wants to live with us.” Sherlock paused, then glanced again at John. John wasn’t used to being studied this intensely, and he moved away from the window. He picked up a new book, and added it to a random box.
Sherlock stared at the cool hand resting on his arm. He could feel the chill through the two layers of shirts. “Why are you so cold?”
They approached the podium in the center of the room. Sherlock pressed the red button in the center.
“Alpha, place your second finger of the left hand on the lighted panel,” a cool electronic voice said. Sherlock placed his finger where appropriate. Sherlock focused on Rosie, and ignored the marriage podium.
“John!” a shout came from outside the bathroom, then arms wrapped around him. “Hey! It’s Sherlock. It’s me.” John forced his eyes open, and glanced into the mirror. Concerned eyes, a handsome scarless face, and no beret look back at him. “What happened?”
Sherlock cleared his throat, “I’m not giving up my name. Sherlock Holmes is a strong name and I like it.”
“We weren’t kids in Germany. We weren’t kids in Uni. We weren’t fucking kids when you married my sister… My sister, Johnny. What a fucking power move that was,” the man laughed, the scars on his face crinkled more. John squeezed his eyes shut, leaning hard against the sink unable to move or break free, waiting for the touch to come.
John rolled his eyes as he managed to start the machine. “Next time it’s time for coffee, you make it.” John chewed his lip as he waited for the coffee pot to brew.
With a note of finality, John shut the laptop and glanced around for the biscuits. “You git. You ate them.”
“Oh my innocent lad, you have no idea how much I owe you,” Mycroft smiled. “Brother mine, now that you are married, you are no longer mine to babysit. Good luck, Dr. John Watson.”
“Watson!” the short Irish man cried happily. He embraced his friend, and pulled back. “So you’re the idiot American doctor I’m working with.”
“It’s just Myc,” ‘Lock grumbled. “When he puts his mind to something, he comes through. He probably waited until the sun was up to send it to you.”
Neither man spoke, but John’s brain was whirring and his heart was racing. For the first time, since Mary died, John felt safe. In the intervening years since her death, John had returned back to Baker Street and found a normal job. He even helped Sherlock with some sleuthing.
“Oh, John!” Mrs. Hudson said, scoldingly. She was rushing down the stairs, waving a tea towel. “He’s such a hateful man. When is Sherlock coming back?”
A sharpish knock roused John Watson from his nap. He slipped out of ‘Lock’s grasp, pulled on pj pants, and answered the door. A tall man with dark hair and a delivery bag stood there.  “John Holmes?”
“Absolutely not, ‘Lock. I was thinking of how fucking amazing you are.” With a smile, John looked at him, then turned to his friend. “Lead us to tea.”
“Oh, piss off, Mycroft,” John said dismissively. He tucked his laces into his trainers, and stood up. John walked over to the brunet and held his hand out to him. “Come on, dear.”
“I was waiting for you to fall asleep,” John admitted, with a yawn. “You weren't paying attention or else you’d have known I was slow breathing.”
“Pees, Da!” Rosie said, making a grabbing motion with her outstretched hand. John laughed, placing the biscuit in her hand.
Sherlock glanced at his brother, and nodded. He smoothly stood up and fell in step behind the doctor and the nurse. “Thank you for saving me from my brother. He’s a right git when he wants to be.”
“Before you, the deductions were too fast, and I felt overwhelmed with them. Ever since that day you came to my brother’s house and bossed him around like you did.” ‘Lock chuckled. “When you limped out of the recovery room after delivering the babies, I knew I was screwed. You made the drugs useless, and the tobacco was good, but nothing like what it used to be.”
“You have access to MI-6’s files. Figure it out,” Greg grinned. “But it’s apparently S.O.P. to run a pregnancy test on any and all Omegas and Betas who seek treatment.”
“When she’s done, we’ll get you back in bed, and then I’ll join you,” ‘Lock promised his sleepy Omega, playing with the blonde hair resting on his shoulder.
“Omega, place your second finger of the left hand on the lighted panel.” John put his finger on the podium. A quick blood sample was collected from the two men.
“I’m not really sure that’s me, but I’m going to do my best,” John said, as he turned to go upstairs.
“We need to talk,” John said, elbowing his way out of Sherlock’s arms. He pulled a couple paper towels free and dried his hands.
“Thanks, Watson. We have Dr. Rami joining us for the surgery. He’s a third year resident. He’s fantastic.”
“Congratulations, Mr. Holmes. You have three healthy, perfect daughters.”  John scooped up one of the babies, and placed her in Greg’s arms. Greg was crying, staring at his daughter.
John came out of the bathroom, and leaned against his Alpha. ‘Lock tucked the phone away, and took John’s hand. “John.” He nudged his Omega with a grin. “We’re in America.”
“One time, ‘Lock,” John mused. “I was cross-eyed pissed and I tried to hide from my C.O. for roll call.”
“Sorry, Daddy,” Rosie said, kissing John on his cheek. She wiped most of the flour off his face before turning back to go into the kitchen. Rosie must have nudged Sherlock or made a “apologize!” face at her Papa.
Nothing felt like home like this did. Before John could overthink or second guess, he stood up on his tippy toes. John took a deep breath, and pulled Sherlock down to him. Their lips met and John groaned into the kiss. Sherlock tightened his arms around John, and sighed into the kiss.
John settled back into his seat and got buckled himself. He reached over to take Rosie’s hand while they rode to MI-6 headquarters.
“Let me finish please. I’ve held this in for so long.” John sighed, then gave his Alpha’s hand a squeeze. “I saw all these babies coming in from other GIs … Coworkers of mine, people who knew our secret. It was the worst kept secret on the base. Everyone knew I was Mr. James Sholto in all but name, and here’s the fucked up thing, ‘Lock, I kept telling myself that my time was coming. That something would change. It was nothing but magical thinking.” John shook his head, reflecting on the years spent with James.
“You feel just as guilty about the embassy bombing as I do. You hand picked me for the mission and it ended both my marriage and my career.”  John said, pointedly, clenching and unclenching his fists. “If we’re going to do this, Sherlock, it’s going to be a proper marriage. We’re going to talk about things and work as a team. I’m going to expect you to pick up your socks.”
Sherlock bounded out of the car as soon as it stopped. He ran over to Greg’s side to help him stand. Greg took a moment to gather himself before he allowed Sherlock to pull him upward. He pulled his hands out of Sherlock’s and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck. “I’m so glad you’ve been here so much. I’m going to miss you.”
John shook his head, and went up the seventeen stairs to his flat. He took a deep breath, and came into the room. Mycroft was still waiting for his return. “I thought you’d leave. Why are you still here?”
“There is no rule stating that you can only have one marriage, John. Maybe you should spend some time thinking about that until we talk next.”
Sherlock grinned, flushed bright pink at the endearment. “If you want to go ahead, I’ll meet you there.”
“Hullo, Papa Myc and Uncle ‘Lock! Your girls have arrived.” John said, as he stepped into the room. He forced his voice to sound cheerful. Myc dashed to John’s side to stare at his children.
John shook his head, but couldn’t stop the grin that came upon his face. “You are your papa’s spawn through and through.”
Sherlock made eye contact with John, trying to read his expression. “I’m not a very good Alpha. I don’t have very many instincts that guide me. So I use my brain, but-” Sherlock sighed, throwing a few more things into a box. “I have blind spots about humans-”
John hummed non-committedly as he watched the resident work. He was doing great and nearly had the uterus detached.
“The personal shopper and the concierge will be up momentarily.” The hotel clerk smiled politely. “Your bags have already taken up.”
The whistling kettle brought John back to his task.  He flipped the stove off, and poured two cups. He put the kettle on the tray. He added one of Rosie’s cups and a few biscuits to the tray. John picked it up and carried it into the sitting room where his two best girls were. Rosie was sliding off the plastic covered chair, and laughing about it. Then she’d stand up and do it again.
“Of course,” ‘Lock kissed the top of John’s head before he reached behind his Omega to restart the elevator. “I don’t want to get the boot before we even start to terrorize anyone.”  John chuckled, not wanting to pull away from his Alpha.
Greg narrowed his eyes as he climbed back up into the bed. “He called me ‘Mother Hen.’ That fucking beastie. I shall murder him and roast his eyes.”
“Something to discuss, I guess,” John agreed, following Sherlock into the building. Sherlock walked over to a table, and flung himself into a seat. John rolled his eyes, but pulled his own chair out. He sat down in the chair, and studied his dining companion.
“I’m too angry to do anything,” John said instantly. Regretting the moments the words were out of his mouth. “I don’t have an anger problem though.”
‘Lock exhaled loudly and stretched his body out. “That’s how he is.” ‘Lock mimicked his big brother’s speech when he said,  “Don’t be smart. I’m the smart one, Sherlock.”
As if on cue, ‘Lock’s phone beeped. ‘Lock pulled it out of his pocket and glanced at the message from Myc. “Found you and John a flight that leaves in three hours. I’ll send you more details when I get them. Myc Holmes.”
Quietly John spoke to her, “Acushla, I’m going to take care of you any way I have to. Is breá liom tú. I love you, my darling.”
“Well, then, please explain it to me in your simplest manner so that I can understand your thoughts.”
“Speaking of Papa, you better go apologize before he removes his headsets and we have to listen to his awful violin screeching.”
“Because I made a promise,” Sherlock said, simply. “I am dedicated to making our marriage a peaceful one, if nothing else.”
“Hey, cut the sexist remarks out.” John said, slipping by to grab himself food. Sherlock followed John with a snicker.
John placed his hand on top of Lock’s hand. John waited until the Alpha looked up at him. “You’re doing brilliantly. I’m so proud to be your Omega. You have no idea how you’ve improved my life.”
“I need help…” Sherlock said, switching Rosie from one arm to the next.  “Consulting, I mean. I have a bored landlady. She’ll love your daughter.”
