Laughing, the DI pushes a fresh beer in front of John. "That bad? Talk to me... Did he set the kitchen table on fire again?"
“Don’t worry about him, he won’t call you anymore.” He frowns, changing lanes quickly “unless, you want him to of course.”
“You are a famous ANONYMOUS writer,” Mike stated, seriously, “does anyone know that you write? That you are the man behind John Baker?”
“Who was it Sherlock?” Molly asks curiously “You’ve been saying that for nearly two years but I don’t know who it was.”
Leaving him to his rest after he gives him the generic non-addictive painkillers, the government man left the pile of cold cases on the nightstand near the untouched muffins and fruit.
“Who’s asking?”
"No! Don't say that, that woman used me to get to you, tried to kill you... How could you turn this into something that's your fault!"

“Let go for a beer then. Molly, are you joining us?”  The DI asked, looking at the cute pathologist expectantly.
“Hello,
"Yes," he mutters to himself "I'm really happy for him. I should write him a letter or something. Isn't what people do My'?"
Sherlock remained silent, unmoving while John’s words echoed in his mind.
Agitated, Sherlock was fidgeting with his spoon and avoiding Greg's eyes, he shakes his head slowly. "Don't say that... He... he chose her." His voice was cold, devoid of any apparent emotion. "Leave me alone... please."

"Well, when on a date?"
“Tell me what happened, please. I want to help you. I’m with you, always, you know that.” After a moment, he pressed his brother against him, trying to calm him. “That criminal, Moriarty, John told me, flew away but we are going to find him, don’t worry. You are going both to be able to have a great life without his interferen -” Interrupted by understandable muttering, Mycroft tilted his head to be nearer, “what did you say?"
Choosing to continue the charade, John spits out angrily, “recruiting me for what? Who are you? What do you want from me!”
December 24
“Good, but don’t count on a make-out session in a booth or something, this is a formal vets’ social occasion after all.” After a small kiss, he placed his hands on the heavy collar of Sherlock’s cape and pulled it straight, making the perfect dramatic backdrop to the vampire’s striking figure. “Voilà! Now it is perfect.”  Hand in hand, they left the flat to slide into Mycroft’s car that was waiting in front of 221b.
The first thing he remembers is the absolute silence, as the loud explosion completely deafens him for a moment. Automatically, adrenaline kicking in, he turns towards the men and women of his small expedition group to check if everyone is okay. Helping one to get to cover, pushing on a wound to keep the blood loss to a minimum. Pushing with one hand.
What happened at the museum to spook Sherlock?
The doctor turns swiftly as a laugh echoes from behind a nearby wall.

Turning a bit to check his surroundings, John sighs as he sees William’s brother and steps out of the car, shaking his head.
Looking around her to be sure that no one was listening, Lucy murmurs, “It was after the exams, Smith – who used to be a model student with A+ in everything – had an E in is Chemistry’s final.”
I know, I am really far away from Never Been Kissed :-)
December 26th: Sorry / Really sorry for last night rambling. I think that... Christmas, you know. It's not easy right now. I think about how special Christmas was when I was in the army. The other medical team, the soldiers, it was like a big family. It wasn't special and extraordinary, it was the sum of a lot of small things. The excitement of expecting something from home, the camaraderie between us, a special meal - not from a tin, thank you very much - at the mess. A bit of music and fun to forget for an evening the horror outside of the camp. Right. That's cheerful. Apologies to my 2 readers. 3 if I count 'anonymous' from the other night.
“Can’t believe you’re still unable to wink, Mike. God, you are terrible!”
The noise in the room rapidly died down as the hundred or so students stop talking and moving around. The man surprisingly, as he wasn’t that imposing, generates instant respect.
Pointing out the cane to Clara with an amazed grin, Harry asks quietly, "and then he just... disappeared?"
"Both at a separate place for Christmas, not really magical." Clara protests sweetly with a pout.
“It’s going to be fun... we just need to find you someone, now!”
And suddenly he realizes. The blood isn’t only from the other soldier, it’s his. Turning slowly, he looks at his shoulder with a professional and distant eye.
“Shush, darling, shush... Come here, we will work through things,” he gently pulled the vampire in the direction of the sofa, “I can’t guarantee you that I won’t be killed by a car next week, and it’s okay, it’s life. I can say though that I will never leave you because of your past, I have done horrible things myself because it was necessary for my survival.” He kissed his eyebrows, trying to chase away the look of concern. “Regarding Moriarty, the way he killed those vampires, I am also afraid that something is going to happen to you. Don’t you think it’s better to be there to protect each other? And regarding my so-called human fragility, your brother said that he’s going to have his eyes on me, whatever that means.”
unwise. “Do you want to go for a coffee?”
In a coffee shop near Barth, Molly smiles at Greg after she checked her phone, "It only took two hours! You owe me another fancy latte, extra-caramel!"
They had spent a great day, the three of them together. The restaurant was great, followed by a lazy afternoon in a coffee place with board games and great music. But, after dinner, Harry had insisted that they get dressed nicely and go out to the Millennium Pier. "The view is as beautiful from the other side of the river, or even a bit further away."
"We are both adults, we can get over this... We... We slept together one night two years ago. As you said, it shouldn't change anything. I am willing to try if you are."
A little discussion...
"For love!", an army friend catcalled, theatrically blinking his eyes seductively.
"Invigorating... What a nice way to put it, My'." Greg tone was definitely flirty as, now that Sherlock was stable and on the road to recovery, they felt more inclined to return to the intimacy of their relationship that had been neglected over the last months.

Greg was looking at Molly with worry.
Scoffing at Ella's comment (You don't! You are going good John, just keep on doing this and it's going to be easier.

“I didn’t know what to say!” The detective chuckles, so happy that John was there with him.
He smirks at his sister's reply asking if Ella was a good prospect as a girlfriend and asking for a picture. Could you imagine, dating a therapist... Someone who's able to read everything that you don't want to say out loud! Horrible!
WG, really?
that happened a long time ago affect my - our - life today..." He waves his hand dismissively, fixing the tea after he asks John how he takes his. "...but I totally understand if you want to turn and run away."
It was at the beginning of the fourth chapter, the evening was in fact really relaxing as he only had two patients that he was able to deal with by phone, when his computer pinged at him. Curious, he wasn't expecting to chat with Harry - they did it the afternoon - he drops his book on the coffee table and opens his old PC. Unable to restrain his surprise, he laughs an astonished "What?" as a little flag appears on his blog page.
"Who knows, the fright of seeing me again could spontaneously cure your psychological limp!" Handing a slightly abused mug to John, he looks at the man trying to deduce what was new since... since that night. "If you want to talk to your therapist before moving with me..."
But it wasn't what John wanted for now. Quivering with desire, he moans until he was able to finally talk to the divinity who was spread over him, hovering like an angel. “Take me... Please... I’m all yours...” The lips on his shoulder smile, chuckling softly, sending another wave of shivers that resonate directly to his sex. “It's not funny...” The doctor voice was harsh as he swallows hard. “You... you teased me long enough...”
“I am 36 years old... since 1895.”
The young man was so beautiful in the candlelight. His usual witty t-shirt was upgraded by a smart button-up shirt in deep purple.
Looking back at the few pictures in the file, he tries to link them to the black and white face on the blog. Far from the energetic and smiling man that posed in Afghanistan with his team, or that teen running on the soccer field. Eyes glued on the small portrait, Sherlock wasn’t able to read anything.
"That's my line, John, you're the one who... anyway, I wasn't supposed to come here, but as I am... I just need to know that you are not busy drinking yourself into oblivion or something like that. But, you are obviously doing fine." John's heartbeats accelerate as his friend leans over him. "Eating waffles... no American pancakes."
"It's... it's nothing... I don't know what to say." And, without being able to stop himself, he tells her the strange string of events.
“Why are you saying this? You really think that you are both not good for each other? How could you -”
"You shouldn't," John shrugs. "I am not as fit, but I used to be a soldier... I think I can manage a little village."
"Anyway, it wasn't... It was ordinary, not really worth the effort probably."
"It's a blog --"
“The police got him an hour ago, he was hiding at his girlfriend’s place.”
The class is over and most of the students are heading to the cafeteria or the library but Sherlock, able to escape a little group of new ‘fans’ after a flimsy excuse to Alan, hides in a corner of the corridor and waits for Watson to exit his classroom. Uncustomarily, his judgment is clouded by his opinion of the man.
Holding John closes, she asks seriously, "how are you really doing, brother?"
The lecturer was talking about head trauma – in car accidents, in sport, etc – when someone raises his hand. Nodding at the student, Watson took the opportunity to sip his coffee and sit back down at his desk as at some point he had jumped to show things on the screen and had been energetically walking around.
“Stop it, the two of you!” turning red at the attention and the innuendos about Watson, Sherlock didn’t know how to react. Being the centre of the attention like that, by people who – for whatever reason! – actually seemed to like him felt weird. He is trying to find a way to stop Lucy’s cooing when Marcy joins in the discussion, hugging Sherlock out of the blue.
Of course...
"I'm on my way to a meeting outside of the office, today of all day poor me, and I decided to come and see how you're doing." Sitting at the kitchen table, he smiles as John pours coffee. "Thanks, mate!"
“Oh, Sherlock! Who is it! Do you truly like him? Is he here tonight?” The pathologist was turning on herself to look around.
“Murray! You must be crazy,” he muttered quickly his eyes unable to look away from the sexiest man alive, “he’s out of my league!”
In answer, Victor merely picked up the plates that had held their dinner and stormed off to the small kitchen.
All of a sudden, his head collided with the lamppost he was standing next to, and a pathetic excuse for a teenager picked up his skateboard, bellowed some crude insult toward Sherlock and ran off.
“If I had no ethics, would I be discussing it?” Victor groused, staring at her.
Mycroft Holmes’ sardonic smile didn’t waver. “Now, now, brother mine. I’ve been speaking with the Chief Inspector for a few minutes before you came barrelling into NSY with your analogies and theories of what happened to Mr and Mrs Carpenter of Surrey, some twenty years ago.” He smirked and turned back to the Chief Inspector. “I would apologise for my younger brother’s tactless entrance, but I’m afraid he’ll only try to override what I’m trying to say. Good day to you, Chief Inspector.”
“I’m your friend.” Irene began laughing, amused by his temper, as well as his predicament. “I’m here to help you!”
go away
In the hospital, Sherlock lay down on the bed, against his will as the nurse put a sticking plaster to the stitched cut on his brow.
Sherlock huffed in annoyance and turned to ascend the stairs once more.
“No!” Sherlock protested. “Come on, Victor! I’ll be sick all over.”
“Yes, of course!” Victor smiled. “Good luck with this new client!”
Sherlock gave a defeated sigh and looked about to find a seat to sit on while he waited for the next train.
“There’s something I want you to know.” Sherlock said, sitting on the couch, not facing Victor, who sat at the rickety kitchen table behind him. He turned his head. “Molly doesn’t drink whisky, Victor, it makes her vomit.” Victor frowned, silently asking where this was going. “And that whisky only comes out for when Mycroft comes around, you know that.”
Mycroft quirked an eyebrow at the thought. “I suppose you have a point there.” He steepled his fingers under his chin. “I’m not going to just give you money. But perhaps you can do an investigative job for me…”
“Hello?” He asked again. “No, sorry… can’t hear you!” And he rang off. “Didn’t even know it still had juice.” He said with a grin. “Okay… cheers.”
“I’m sure there were.”
“How did a glass end up in the laundry?”
“I know.” Jim said, apologetically. “It’ll only take a second, I promise… I just need to show you something.”
“Well, I got knocked over by a-” Sherlock was interrupted by Victor jumping over to the bed and switching off the radio. “What the hell?”
“Oh, well good. You had me worried for a minute.” She smiled.
The heart monitor beeped constantly. He was the sound that drew Sherlock out of his sleep. He blinked, tiredly, focusing on Victor sitting off to the side.
The cab pulled into the drop off bay of Barts and the cabbie helped the much taller man into the Accident and Emergency ward. Passing off the bleeding man to a student nurse, he big Sherlock adieu and went back to his car. Sherlock mumbled a thank you and was led to a bed where the nurse could assess the damage and stitch the wound.
“Well,” He stopped. “He’s not happy, of course, but he will be… you know, when he’s thought about it… I gotta go. I want to be back before Sherlock gets home.” He took Irene’s wine glass and took a sip, making a sour face. Irene merely laughed at him.
“Actually, I was working for my brother.”
your friend Molly
Sherlock turned and fled, taking the stairs two at a time, ignoring Victor as he raced after Sherlock. He felt the sleeve of his coat catch on something and turned slightly to see Victor grabbing it. The motion made him lose his balance and tumble down the stairs.
“I don’t mind.” Victor cocked his head to the side as he went to open the curtain.
“Well, I can tell… you look like you’ve been run over by a bus!” Victor swallowed and Sherlock all but fell on the bed, back to him. He turned over.
“Ah, sure, Irene. I’ll be there.” Victor smiled. “Yep, sure. No worries.” He hung up. “Irene’s clueless sister is coming to stay. She wants me to help make the house a bit plainer.” He chuckled. “I gotta go over there, tomorrow evening.” He made his way back toward the bedroom, before doubling back and looking into the kitchen. “Sorry, was there something else you needed to tell me?”
Sherlock only nodded as he shut the door behind him.
“I mean it… when I came home from the station two weeks ago, I’m sure there was a bottle of single-malt and two glasses on the dresser.”
“Whoops!” The much shorter man bent and picked up the dropped folder and handed it back. “Sorry about that!” Before disappearing into the tidal wave of pedestrians that crowded the walkway.
“Yeah… called in to take a half shift. Someone got sick on the job. I was about to write you a note.”
“Oh, no… you don’t ask.” Victor said, throwing his dressing gown on. “

Sherlock and Sliding Doors belong to their respective people... I merely play and put the toys back in the box when I'm done.
“Really? Oh, that’s great!”
The shower turned off quickly as Sherlock walked into the bedroom. The room was in a state worse than when Sherlock had a tantrum. “You’ve been sleeping all day, you lazy shit.” He said. Victor came into the bedroom, rubbing at his strawberry blonde hair with a towel.
“You have your own.” Mycroft said, shaking his head. “Does investigating missing kittens and discovering who ate the last Jammy Dodger not pay as well as you’d hoped?”
“Oh, Victor.” Jim laughed. “I’m a jealous lover. I don’t say what I want. You have to figure it out… but, I do reserve the right to hold your balls in a vice if I don’t get it! That’s what makes me so fascinating… and maybe just a little bit frightening.”
Dimmock was first to entre the office, somewhat meekly, followed by Sherlock, whose scowl only deepened when he saw who else occupied the room.
“Well, he’s not doing a very good job of vetting his employees, is he?” The man waved him away disdainfully. “You’re lucky I don’t sue you or your brother. Now, excuse me, but I have to find someone who will do their job properly and find the real culprit.”
Sherlock mumbled something unintelligible and allowed the cabbie to guide him to the back seat, shutting the door and getting into the driver’s seat, heading toward the closest hospital.
Sherlock alighted from the cab after paying the driver and hurried down the street to his door. Unlocking the three bolts, he pushed the warped door out of the frame and let it swing open, the hinges squeaking in protest. Toward the back of the flat, he could hear the shower running. Ah, so Victor had been sleeping.
“What?I bought those because I hardly ever buy you flowers and I thought it was about time!” The blonde stated. “Why would I cheat? I try to do something nice, and instead of being thanked, or even given a kiss, I’m instantly public enemy number one?”

to get you back! This whole idea was that I could get you back! But apparently you are so fucking indecisive about whether you want me of Sherlock, I’m never going to get a straight answer!” He grabbed his Westwood jacket off the bed and slid it on, angrily, picked up his suitcase. “So, if you don’t know what this is Victor Trevor, let me enlighten you.” He picked up his shoes, slipping them on, wincing. “This is me, leaving you.” He stormed out the door. “AGAIN!” The door slammed, causing Victor to jump.
“C’mon.” Victor said with a gleeful grin. “Wash your face and put on that best suit of yours… we’re going out.”
“I asked, has Victor invited you along to Doncaster for this trip?”
Sherlock, having not expected the collision, was shaken. He jumped violently as a hand touched his shoulder.
“Bloody hell, Victor. What are you doing here?”
Sherlock groaned softly. “As much as I hate to admit it, I’m desperate. Tell me what you need done.”
bad sign.”
“Well, the smaller thing is that someone might have a job for me to investigate a missing person case in a private capacity, as they don’t really trust the police to do their jobs.”
“Oh,” Victor paused. “This little B&B I’m at has some couple next door who seem to be trying for the Guinness World Record of marathon sex. Crazy stuff.” He glared at Jim as the other man came hobbling in from the bathroom, still groaning.
He picked up his briefcase and umbrella and all but glided out of the office, shutting the door with a soft
“Soon, love… soon.” Victor said, stroking his hair. “Sherlock… there’s something I’ve been meaning to confess… it has a little bit to do with the glass in the laundry, and a little bit to do with the fellow you met today…only, please let me finish before you get angry…okay?” He looked down at Sherlock. “Sherlock?”
“You have no compassion!” Victor explod3ed angrily. “Why do I even both confiding in you?!”
Victor sighed. “Fuck.” He mumbled.
Hours went by after the ambulance had brought Sherlock to the closest hospital. Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s emergency contact, had been called and his paperwork had seemingly disappeared, only to return fully completed.
“The club called. I had to go in for an impromptu staff meeting.” Victor said, running his hand through Sherlock’s curls.
“Tell me about it.” Victor waved a hand to get Jim’s attention as he sat on the bed, but the other man ignored him. Panicking slightly, Victor shook his head. “I’m going to go and knock on the door, tell them to keep it down… some of us were up til God-knows-when looking at potential clubs that their boss can buy out.”
“Yes, very unwise...” Sherlock murmurs, knowing that it was in fact  really

He eventually kills Novak which Sherlock and Mycroft are hearing over the intercom. (Sorry, I don't really know what has gotten into me here...)

"6, 5, 4..."
Anthea, watching as Sherlock's pod arrives back to the platform, presses the doors open and motions John to step in first. Closing the door after him quickly, leaving Harry, Clara and Molly outside. Thinking it was an error, he quickly bangs on the door, shouting. "What's going on? HEY!"
Giggling, one of his friends at the end of the table (who was a bit too drunk to say cohesive things), knocked on the table theatrically. “Proof it!”
he turned his attention to his friend.
The generic upscaled bodyguard look of the man who ‘asked’ him to jump in the car, the good quality shackles that hold him in place by tightening the detective to a bolt in the back of the seat (
"No, I'm done here... let me grab my coat." As Donovan nods a last salute and rushes outside her boss office, Greg shakes his head. "Don't be so hard on her, I think that she realizes how easily Anderson and her fell for Moriarty's master plan. She's trying to change her but she's hated your brother for so long, it's hard."
"John..." Mary was trying to calm him "we don't know everything, it's hard to judge the situation right now. Of course, it does not look good for them, but
“The man in the navy trench? I do not think he is going out with this Adonis.”
“Shush,” he peppered small kisses all over his lovely face, “it’s the first time it happened since you stopped drinking human blood, isn’t?” As Sherlock nodded, sad and troubled, John kissed him again until the need to breathe forced him to break the connection, “that is so fucking sexy! I, ordinary John H. Watson, was able to trouble your great mind enough that you lost control after a century!” He laughed, grinding their manhoods together, wanting to be lost in the pleasure of having the tall man behind him until they were both panting in exertion.
Until it isn’t.
Rolling his eyes at his brother’s actions, a shiver of shame rushes down Sherlock's spine. “Don’t tell me he kidnapped you?” As John remains silent, with only a ghost of a smile on his lips, the young man grabs his phone.  A moment later he places it on the table with an air of smugness.
The idea of having a whole week with them was really pleasant and John was nearly feeling himself again. He raises his head as the walking passengers start to make their way out of the door connecting the terminal to the dock. He saw them quickly, his sister jumping up trying to spot where John was.
30 minutes ago...
Opening the files on Watson, he surveys what happened after he left the Yard. Nothing special, he walked home, the light went off an hour later
On the morning of the thirty-first, John was alone in the living room. Apparently, Harry's 'emergency' was now a thing of the past and she was free as a bird to go for brunch and relax until the big event at midnight. He was pondering the idea of getting up to make coffee when his phone buzzes. Hoping it wasn't something related to work, he swipes across his screen happy to read that is was Mike.
As the woman was approaching Mycroft with a smile and an extended hand, Greg mutters, "Sometimes I'm a kind of afraid of what I've gotten myself into..."
"To Doctor Stamford's house, Sir, Mr. Lestrade told me that you are going to pick up Doctor Watson on your way home." Ready for the argument - Greg explained the situation succinctly - the man remains silent to let the news sink in.
Looking at the young man with worry, he argues while still trying to get his thoughts together and thinking that the shots were definitely too much! “but, I need to go with him!”
(See the end of the chapter for
"DONOVAN, I won't let you disrespect my husband or his family!" He points to the door.  She tried to apologize, she wasn't stupid and she was now aware that she had been manipulated by Moriarty, but Greg wasn't ready to listen.
His thoughts were interrupted by a hysteric Anthea (Mycroft’s opinion, not mine) “Mister Holmes! He’s taking is bloody phone out of his pocket!” Grabbing her boss harm, she laughs as The Science of Deduction appears on her surveillance screen “He’s reading the bloody blog! Finally! God, men are useless sometimes!”
Holding the hand that was somehow left unbroken, Mycroft was feeling useless.
"Ohhhh... youtubing again!" She playfully slaps him on the arm while giving him his tea. "I have a good feeling about this one." She knew how hard it had been for her new tenant to find a flatmate.
"Doctor Watson is clearly curious! And now that we know that he interacted with Sherlock on his blog..." She smiles. "Maybe we can set up something!"
I'm so late from my usual 'one chapter per week rule', job is kind of hellish nowadays. Going to relax tomorrow and work on chapter 4!
Surveying his new friend’s face, the young man frowns, “you look like you haven’t slept very well…”
Sherlock was inside his room at the Ryde Castle Hotel, looking at the glorious view on the tormented water without being able to appreciate any of it.
It was the best kiss that they ever exchanged, ten times better than the sum of all the kisses they exchanged that night, in that little pub. So long ago... The sweet scent of Sherlock's hair product, the taste of his favourite tea that was surrounding the heat of his mouth. John groans as he pulls the detective even closer, the shivering in his limbs clearly not caused by the still pouring rain. Finally... the dancing of their tongues, the little noise Sherlock was making as he ravages his mouth, his neck... licking the saltiness of tears from under his beautiful eyes.
"No, don't really want to go back to my dingy flat."
John looks up, impressed by the brightly illuminated structure.
“Sorry, really!” Shame was reddening her cheeks, “do we need to send a team boss?” She turns to look at the screen where Sherlock was effectively defending himself and wasn’t looking too much in trouble then went back to look at Lestrade.
“And quite expertly, if I may say” he laughs “Case closed but still available for experiments!”
Chuckling sadly, she kisses him on the cheek. "John has the right to have a life outside of Sherlock's memory."
"I need coffee! Then a good shower, then we are going for a nice brunch..." She is strangely happy for someone who just woke up a few minutes earlier.
"I give them five hours. No, four!" Molly smiles proudly.
The man, John’s friend for nearly ten years now, is always there when needed. A harbour  when the other man is lost.
"Yes?"
"It's YOUR fault, Molly Hopper!" Sherlock shouts as he barges into the pathologist's office the following afternoon. "I've wasted too many hours, a few hundred pounds and... my dignity!" Dropping his bag loudly on the floor he sits in the chair in front of her desk. It was a bit before lunch as Sherlock, after a restless night in his hotel room, took the first ferry from the island on December 29th before jumping on the train.
"Oh, Gregory..." With a sob, the imperturbable man finally broke in his lover's arms. "What they have done to him... it's horrible. I don't even know... if he's going to be okay."
“John Watson?” a man with a foreign accent asked.
"You are an idiot! Do you know what's going to happen if he knows your little plan!” The man’s voice is heavy, strong, but edged with fear. “The boss won’t like it, not at all!”
Sherlock is going to a meeting…
Without reacting to the rowdy catcalls from the others pods.
The finger, to the CCTV, really mature brother mine. MH
Strangely, the thought of the lonely doctor hadn't left his mind since he read his poor example of a blog in Molly's office. And he wasn't able to resist reading it daily since then.
Stepping back and holding a hand before him, he shook his head, “we don’t have time for shenanigans, later, I promise.”
“Who are you? You have no right to -”
Sighing silently, he knocks lightly one time, finding the idea of entering the room without being invited now that Sherlock was awake, inconceivable. Smiling as he remembers the argument he had with his brother when he showed him the rooms when he purchased the house.
"There is the possibility that you are going to have a wonderful time, did you ever think about that?"
“Perfect. It’s still early, Anthea, we have work to do.” Eying the big bowl of popcorn, Mycroft frowns in disgust thinking about the amount of chemical involved in the creation of fat-free-butter-flavouring, “you shouldn’t eat that crap, dear.” With a handful of kernels, the young woman was ready to follow her boss when he objects, “if you think you’re going to eat popcorn in my office, dear, you are delusional!”
Unable to cope, John faints, heartbroken.
for me?"
Explanations will have to wait.
Mycroft was back into the kitchen after a quick shower when Anthea enters the room with a heavy document case. "All this already? I've been away for only two days..."
Let me explain, please. You have to let me talk to you! WG
December 24th: The sky / It's Christmas Eve, the sky is wonderful and full of brilliant stars. I wish you all, where ever you are, a peaceful night.
“I thought I lost you,” the doctor murmurs, his face now in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. “You are the same, you are the man I fell in love with.”
He chokes as he mouths
“You’ve got the money?” the first student asks, roughly.
John, unable to stop himself, turns to look at the building and quickly spots the camera, which turns slowly to point in his direction.
The rescue was executed brilliantly, exactly as planned. His role as a general, allied to their cause, easily opened the door to the cell. The vicious warlord was anxious to please and eager to get rid of the prisoner.
“Sir! The idiot is still in Hampstead!”
Not really long sorry, I am under a tight schedule with RL.
"Same, don't really want to go back to my sister's sofa."
The detective was anxiously waiting in front of the station, 10 minutes before the time of the rendezvous. Looking over his phone, he confirmed that the museum he chose was still open, that no catastrophe was going to ruin everything!
Turning on his heels, the vampire finally realized that he wasn’t alone.
"But maybe... if we talk to John..."
Back with their drinks, Mike argues with a laugh, "it's true that your blog isn't perfect! But it's always hard when you start something like that."
“Sorry, did you say something?”
“It’s so hard to find the perfect fit! I hope you are right!”
An hour later, everyone was relaxing, eating greasy food and chatting amicably at a table in the back of the pub. John, relaxed but not really drunk, smiled as he looked around the table. His friends were having fun, talking about work, life, girlfriend, kids, teasing each other when the possibility arose. But they know they are always there for anyone who asked for help.
“Holmes! You’re going to do as I told you!” The beefy man was pushing hard against his classmate, angry that he wasn’t cooperating. “You’re going to complete the work I’ve gave you or –"
Murmuring, Molly tries to catch her friend attention. “Sherlock! Stop that, it’s a wedding, we are in church!”
Quickly, he texts back before asking Donovan to leave and close the door.
?, is looking at him with worry.
"Yes, I would like to." The older man was looking at the screen, the little dot in Serbia showing the stronghold where Sherlock was probably incarcerated, only an hour's flight from Vienna.
“It’s okay John, it’s break time, you don’t have to be Doctor John H. Watson every minute of the day, you know.” She went to get two fresh cups of tea, handing one to her new colleague. “So, is it a woman? Your girlfriend?”
Molly, taking a pad, shakes her head "I haven't yet! Do you want to help me to write something?"
Sherlock frowns, and interjects, “Never talked about this with them.”

When he takes his eyes off Sherlock’s mesmerizing lip and looks into his eyes again, he nearly drowns in those green-grey-blue irides. His heart goes faster. He can’t move when Sherlock leans toward him a bit, tilts his head and pulls John closer with his wet hands. Sherlock’s lips brush against his, feather light and warm. They rest against each other for the blink of an eye, then John exhales and kisses back. Moving his lips, Sherlock opens his in invitation. When John’s tongue touches Sherlock’s, John feels like coming home once more tonight. Sherlock tastes like spices and Sherlock and feels absolutely breathtaking. Sherlock pulls John even closer, not caring about John’s shirts getting soaking wet and water running over his face where Sherlock touches him. John’s hands run through Sherlock wet hair, along his neck, his collarbones. They dive into the water to touch his chest.

John closes his eyes. He concentrates on the light strokes of Sherlock’s hand on his chest as he unbuttons his shirt. Sherlock runs his hands over his bare skin, his stomach. When one of his hands touches his collarbones and shoulders, his other hand runs from his pelvis up along his spine. John shudders. These slender, elegant hands, which he has secretly admired countless times when he watched Sherlock playing his violin. They are touching his skin, caressing him, down his spine again, his lower back, his ass… Sherlock tightly grabs his cheeks and John leans into the touch, moaning. He can’t help but touch Sherlock as well. He reaches for his broad shoulders first. Then he imitates Sherlock’s movement and lets them travel down his back until they rest on the delicious curve of Sherlock’s butt. Sherlock sighs and kisses him again, harder this time. John pulls Sherlock’s pelvis to him.

Closing his eyes, the detective tries to focus his attention to be able to mutter that 'he's absolutely fine' but the pathologist's voice keeps pestering him.
he chuckles,
"Home, for an experiment," she turns to look at the clock, "John's shift ends in five or six hours."
Sherlock attention falls upon the woman who was stealing his John.
“I’ve got an offer for you...” his voice is only audible to Sherlock, but clear enough to be captured by Scotland Yard team, “I heard that you are a proper genius, I need you to do my next assignment in Holt class.”
Looking at the computer, Sherlock reads "I am an experienced medical doctor recently returned from Afghanistan." He nods in appreciation, guessing that the small picture of the doctor was probably previous to his period abroad.
The morning after, John is suddenly scared for Sherlock.
Jumping from her chair, Anthea smiles and rushes out of the office. Mycroft shakes his head,
"Really interesting fellow, even if he's a bit peculiar! He was looking for a flatmate, maybe I can put in a good word for you!" Mike smile drops a bit as John shakes his head.
Letting go of Sherlock,
But instantly he was the only thing Sherlock was able to think about.
They left the hall quietly, while the party was in full swing, the guests eating hors-d'oeuvre and drinking wine.  Mycroft was the first person John saw when he steps outside. "You! Get out of my sight!"
"No. Really?" Sherlock mutters sarcastically.
“Watson?” John’s friend called, waiting to get the doctor’s attention before continuing, “we found our candidate.” With a Machiavellian smile, he discreetly pointed his hand in the direction of the tall and breathtaking man who had entered the establishment a moment ago. “Come on, do your magic.”
Mike, knowing that his friend is getting there, asks calmly. “What do you don’t understand?”
“But...” Marcy interrupts, placing a hand on Sherlock’s arm, “maybe it wasn’t a suicide after all!”
“True, you are really good at getting but not really good at keeping,” one of his army mates chuckled before Murray quickly slapped him on the shoulder.
"John," Clara argues quietly at his image on the screen, "you won't get better if you don't give yourself a chance..."
He didn't know clearly what was Sherlock's life was like when he was away, but he wasn't an idiot!

"I know that I will give anything to be able to go back in time and be with you in front of the crowd..."  Tears were flowing freely, hidden by the rain. "Because when you are absolutely in love with someone --"
Not arguing about the statement, Sherlock asks worryingly "Is something wrong with John? Or with Ma -- " he choked on the name. "... Or with that woman?"
With a small chuckle, John kicks his bad leg with his walking stick. "I'm not doing a lot of running nowadays..."
“Don’t say that mate, you are a really good man, surely you can find someone!” Stamford protested.
Shaking his head at his brother-in-law, Greg interrupts, "Sherlock, it's not --"

Rolling his eyes, John protested, "do not call me that, it was a long time ago and -"
Lost in his thoughts, John never realizes that students were flooding his classroom. The murmurs, the questioning look, the giggles from the female students... all that stops when Sherlock enters the room and drops into his usual place, Alan in tow. The silence persists as minute went by, the students eagerly waiting for Watson to say a thing, for William to exchange a heated gaze with the older man, for anything! As their teacher remains unaware of them, a young man on the first row clears his voice. “Sir? Are you all right? It’s five past ten and...”

“William! Should you be here already?” He promptly kisses his girlfriend before taking Sherlock’s computer bag from her hands, “I’ll take care of this, we’re together for the next hours, Will and I.” Wiggling his eyebrows, he winks. “It’s Doctor Watttttson’s class, your saviour!”
