Sherlock had been dropped off at Speedy's, a deliberate choice, where he walked the rest of the way to the bus depot, getting its location from the phone book. He'd even gone so far as to wear gloves while holding it so there wouldn't be any prints. He had to make sure he had some time to talk with John before either his parents or Mycroft showed up and dragged him back home.
Molly looked at the clock on the wall. "Goodness, it's almost eight. What a whirlwind of a day."
"Wow," John breathed. "Hate to say it, but it sounds like they all deserved each other. But what does the song have to do with it?"
It was Halloween, and St. Bart's was throwing their annual costume bash at the Student Center. This year, the student union teamed up with the LGBTQIA+ club to host the party and the theme was genderbending. Attendees were encouraged to dress up as a genderbend version of a movie, comic, tv show, or book character. John decided to be a male Harley Quinn and Sherlock was Catman instead of Catwoman. John's friends Molly, Mary, and Janine helped him with his outfit. He had decided to be the Suicide Squad Harley after finding artwork online and together the four designed his costume.
"She's right you know. We would make a nice couple," Warren quietly stated.
John responded with a coy smile and instantly disrobed, revealing those form-fitting red boxer briefs that hugged his package in the perfect way, his tanned and muscular chest showcasing the silver dog tags. "Merry Christmas, my beautiful madman."

"I'd like that. Goodbye Molly."
John decided to attend the Homecoming Committee meeting. It had to be held in the cafeteria because so many students showed up. Mrs. Stubbs and Mr. Turing, the teachers who were the committee supervisors, along with Principal Harold Saxon, were also there.
"Well, if you're absolutely sure---"
John stiffened, surprised. Sherlock never mentioned another sibling. And he said
"I can't believe those goons blame Molly for Carl's death," Sebastian said.
Sherlock softened his face and kept silent.
"Sounds great Sherlock. I can't wait to meet them."

“Sit down, I’ll see what I have.” John opened his fridge. “I have bottled water, diet Coke, and a a few bottles of Guinness.”
"And you'll also bring in the clients with a military kink. I can tell you served," Irene added.
(See the end of the chapter for
A month later, Sherlock came to London to spend time with John, and Rosie made her chicken parm dinner. Sherlock judged it most excellent.
John nodded. “Right, I agree. I know she’s only two, but they pick up so much at this age. Let me see if Mrs. Doyle across the hall can take for a bit.” He scooped Evie up into his arms, who started giggling. She waved bye at Bryan as he stepped out of the flat. He knocked on Mrs. Doyle’s door, and she answered in seconds. He explained a friend was over and they were discussing something he didn't want Evie to hear regarding a mutual acquaintance. The woman readily agreed to mind her. John thanked her and went back to his flat. He rejoined Bryan at the kitchen table.
John nodded. "Yes, how did you know? He's not a client is he?"
Sherlock meanwhile, was staring intently at Jodie. "How long have you known her?" he asked.
John couldn't help but grin. The same young man that could reduce others to tears or anger with his brusqueness and deductions on campus was also a gentle sweetheart shy about asking for chocolate chips for his pancakes. "You got it love. I'll add it to my list."
Molly, Mary, and Janine were at Janine's house, in her big bedroom. Molly and Mary sat on Janine's queen sized bed watching Janine go through tons of dresses in her closet. Janine was trying to find one to wear for the sock hop on Saturday.
Luke is based off Idris Elba.
John took the items out of the bags and began to put them away. "Sounds yummy."
John was gobsmacked. "Wait a minute! Mycroft Holmes is his brother?"
Henry Knight was lying on the chase lounge in the tastefully decorated living room of the Wilkes mansion, reading Tales from the Crypt comic books. The radio was tuned into the live broadcast of the sock hop. Henry wouldn't have minded going, but he knew Sebastian wasn't interested, and seeing how his mate's parents were out again---his mother at a dinner party in Beverly Hills and his father on a business trip in San Francisco, Sebastian wanted his boyfriend all to himself.
, he once told her. But she and the others didn’t dare tell their parents. Some things were meant to be private.
Molly blushed a little. "Thanks. My favorite is this one." She pointed to the third photo, which had her striking the pose Katy Perry did on her Teenage Dream album cover.
John and Sherlock exchanged glances and shook their heads. "She's got the greatest timing hasn't she?" John said with a sigh. "You stay there, I'll attend to her."
“Guinness sounds great,” Bryan replied, taking a seat at the kitchen table.
"Have you thought of a name for her?" John asked his daughter.
“No!” he exclaimed. I broke up with Irene because I want to date you! I want you to be my girl Molly.”
"Uh, for about a year."
Irene clicked off the TV and turned to look at her lover and business partner, her pretty face ashen. "This is getting scary Molly. I'm worried for John. All these victims resemble John."
John was nearly to the bus stop when he happened to glance across the street, and saw none other than Sherlock Holmes. He was in front of the Belstaff store, and he looked pissed. Then John saw another man behind him, the same one he saw on his date with Victor Saturday night.
Sherlock worms his way onto a crime scene at a posh hotel. Of course John is working at the same hotel! And sweet, handsome Victor asks John out (because Sherlock is still too much of a hot mess at this point).
human?" Molly asked again with a swish of her ponytail.
Dave remained calm. He had enough years under his belt to know many people who accused someone of murder did it because they didn't like said person. But right now anything was better than nothing. "Who do you suspect?"
John felt like he had no control over his body. A phantom force was compelling him, possessing him to wrap his arms around Sherlock's waist, holding him in tightly. The same force propelled him to lift his head, eyes meeting Sherlock's. The taller boy softly smiled and bent down, lips meeting John's.
Dave turned on the recorder. "This is Office Dave Morstan, Sherrinford Police Department. It's Thursday, September 21st, the time is 4:20 p.m. I am about to record a statement by Henry Knight regarding The Sherrinford Slayer. He has given us permission to record without an adult present." He looked at Henry. "Will you please state your name and age?"
He decided to walk, it was just ten minutes away and he could use the fresh air. The street was somewhat crowded with people on their way to their Friday night activities. Another Halloween had come and gone and now the Christmas rush was on. Some of the shop windows already had Christmas decorations displayed.
"Oh Angelo, I'm so happy to see you doing so well," Martha said cheerfully. "I was so worried when they took you away in the other ambulance. They wouldn't tell me anything, only that you were conscious and the wounds were superficial."
"Look Sherlock, I need to hang up. Everyone wants to go out to get some ice cream. I'll talk to you later yeah?"
Sherlock was studying the man intently. I braced myself for whatever would come out of his mouth and prayed he'd keep quiet.
Rosie squealed and toddled over. John retrieved a box cutter and sat on the floor, carefully slicing open one side of the package. He pulled out the item and grinned at his little girl. "Now it's time to start getting ready. Hopefully by the time we're done, Papa will be home."
He heard the door close, and he smiled. John was home. And he was actually hungry for once. Sherlock slowly stood up, got out of the tub, quickly dried himself off, and wrapped himself in a fresh tan dressing gown.
"John feels guilty for not keeping up a relationship with Harry, even though she was the one that ran out on the family and completely severed ties with him for so many years. I've said my peace about him dropping everything for her whenever she calls and cries to him when her life falls apart. He holds hope that one day she'll get it together, I told him to stop believing in that delusion and make her do it on her own, but he got angry and said he couldn't."
She silenced him with a kiss. Greg wrapped his arms back around her and melted into her mouth.
John turned on his radio, which was was playing A Day in the Life by the Beatles. He smiled and laid down on the blanket, putting on his sunglasses. The Sgt. Pepper album was one of his favorites. He closed his eyes and laid his head down on the blanket, letting the warm breeze and peaceful sounds of the ocean pull him into a state of peaceful contentment.
*****
The couple looked at each other and beamed. "We'll stay," Greg told her.
The alpha glared at John. "Why wouldn't he be?"
Molly vehemently shook her head. "Oh Lord no. Sherlock doesn't think astronomy is worthwhile. He told me he actually deleted the solar system from his mind palace."
"Too bad," he spat.
Warren stayed silent, still face down, not daring to peek at what John was doing. John had retrieved some rope from his bag and stood in front of the bed. "Turn over soldier and keep quiet."
"Yes." Wanda frowned. "Hal, what's wrong?" John sharply turned his head at hearing his mother's voice change, and he stood up and walked towards her.
Sherlock huffed and looked away, his lips in a full pout. "I should have never introduced you to Piecroft."
"John!" Wanda called out. "We're going to Dairy Queen, do you want to come?"
Sherlock smiled. "It's more than okay. After I left the store I couldn't get you out of my head. I felt guilty, but after catching Victor, the guilt was gone."
Sherlock saw John's reaction and grinned deviously. "So John, I made a special trip today and the results of that trip I'm holding in each hand. Now all you have to do is choose one of these results," Sherlock said huskily.
"Back off Jeff. Now's not the time to to be self-righteous. And you of all people should know, considering how you like to try and trick people into taking your sister's birth control pills," Tim shot back.
John couldn't help but laugh at the sweet logic of his little girl. In a way it made sense, and he was sure Sherlock would get a kick out of it. "I think it's a nice name Ro. It'll definitely fit in our household that's for sure."
John sighed. "His parents are very wealthy. You know how it is with money and the law. When you're rich, you get off. Not only that, I didn't want to sit through a court trial and have my bisexuality come up, as well as the incident with Sebastian last Christmas. Lawyers would say it was my fault because this is the second time I've been attacked. Third actually, if you count that kid in our old neighborhood five years ago. I seem to be this psycho magnet, and I hate it."
John took the other and followed Harry to her car. "Is Clarence working at the garage?"
*****
. Now things were getting more interesting. A former Army veteran turned DJ. Quite interesting. And he wasn't bad to look at either.
I apologize to any readers named Tiffany or Crystal, or have kids with those names. The opinions expressed by my characters are not necessarily my own. ;-)
John stared at the man with the long blondish white hair. He looked familiar but John couldn't place him. He paid him no mind as he bundled Evie and himself into a cab, headed for his daughter's nursery. Then from there, he would do some shopping, clean the flat, and check his appointments and answer emails.
"Her favorite part was being able to climb all over the fake dinosaurs. I got a lot of good pictures." John pulled out his phone to show Victor.
Sherlock smiled. "That makes me feel even better." He beckoned to John. "Come and lay here with me."
“I don’t know why it’s so different with me when our sister…”
"Good thing Sebastian came, or it would have been me confronting Jim," Sherlock replied with a frown.
Wanda smiled as she watched her son eat and talk with his friends. This is how it should be all the time, she thought. Carefree, innocent, and without having to be frightened of faceless maniacs waiting to jump out at you in the dark. She prayed the killer would be caught soon.
"Come on, let's go back to my house. My kids have prepared a really special meal for us. They've been up all morning cooking."
*****
Another couple had now entered the hall, and when Janine saw who it was, she gasped loudly. Others heard her and turned to see Eurus Holmes and Jim Moriarty, arm in arm, both sporting cheeky smiles.
After lunch, John had returned back to the flat to put on a fresh T-shirt and shorts and to grab a book before heading back to the beach. Harry and Clara had left a note letting John know they went to Cliff Beach and would be back by dinnertime. John wrote his own note explaining he'd be at the end of the pier reading, and left.
He felt Sherlock's finger stroke his cheek and he shuddered, violently cursing his body for betraying him.
John heaved a sigh of relief. "Thanks Bill, you're a life saver. Can't stop the dancing!" He motioned to Sherlock. "Come on Sherlock, let's get back inside."
John laughed, and the fizzy feeling in Sherlock's body reappeared. His laugh was like honey being warmed by the sun.
"Hi honey," Harold greeted her affectionately. Did you have a nice stroll?"
"I know who are you are. And if you know what's good for you, you'll find that son of yours and go back to where you came from."
"Do you want me to honey?" his mother asked back.
"Well, at least he's off the streets, so thank you for that Mr. Holmes."
The familiar croon of Elvis Presley soon filled the air. As he asked "Are You Lonesome Tonight," Eurus returned to Jim, embracing him and planting a gentle kiss on his lips. "I really like you Jimmy. Will you take me to bed?"
"It was murder wasn't it? That's why you fled England and came all the way to America. But why? There was no need to leave..." John's voice trailed off and a wave of nausea rapidly began to crest in his stomach as began to suspect the unthinkable. "It was you, wasn't it? You killed your own brother. What did you do Eurus? Push him into the pool? Hold him down under the water?"
Jeremy gave his sister another squeeze and helped her up from the ground. "Come on, let's get back on the road. The sooner you get to Harold, the better you'll feel."
"Done with your fun Eurus?" Mycroft asked coldly.
"Yes we do, Molly added.
Sherlock won't to get experience the Captain just yet. Good things come to those who wait...
*****
London was like a town covered in ice cold marshmallows. John couldn't get over how everything looked more peaceful and serene when covered in snow. There weren't many people on the streets walking so it was a lot less noisy. John had to stop for a moment and just take a deep breath, looking up at the gray sky with crisp white flakes falling down. No longer having to get up at the crack of dawn and brave those icy, frigid mornings when it did snow and John had to go to work, the white stuff was a lot more pretty and relaxing.
"I definitely will. I'm glad you were working tonight to see John," Sherlock told his friend. "And Happy Christmas to you too."
Warning for some mild bullying. Teenage boys can be idiots.
John took a deep breath, hand that was holding the bat clenched. "I will. Thank you."
"We cannot disclose their whereabouts due to safety reasons, but they are in a safe and secure location," James replied.
Bryan nodded. “Oh yeah. He started rubbing my back, telling me what a gorgeous thing I was, how much he liked fit soldiers. When I pushed him away and told him I was straight and didn’t swing that way, he got angry. He was offended I turned him down, told me he’d be better than any woman. He was really in my face. And even though I’m a soldier and consider myself tough, he really intimidated me. Luckily the bartender, who used to bounce in a club, intervened and kicked him out. Hours later, I was leaving and he was right there on me, blaming me for being kicked out, and he threatened physical harm.”
John grinned, stretched and yawned. "Yeah. That nap is just what I needed. My brain felt like it was disintegrating into jelly. But I'm pretty sure I aced that final."
"Bill, you gonna be okay?" John asked, a little concerned. It hadn't been that long that Bill's previous relationship had ended, and he didn't want his friend to wind up in a dubious situation.
"Yes, that will make me feel a whole lot better." Irene put her phone to sleep and set it back on the nightstand. She wrapped her arms around Molly and softly kissed her. "Unfortunately we can't stay here all day. We've got a business to run." Her lips formed into a playful smirk. "But, we do have an hour. What should we do to pass the time?"
“You’re in a good mood tonight,” his friend and co-worker Mike Stamford said as the two took a short break sipping Cokes.
John chuckled. "Of course love. We wouldn't miss Mrs. Hudson's mince pies and plum pudding for the world."
John attends a soirée and finds a new friend.
Victor let out a low whistle. “No wonder Irene’s all ape over him. He sounds like a real sex god.”
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. "Ugh John, let's get out of here. Sebastian's alpha pheromones are starting to reek up this place."
"I guess that's my cue to leave. I'll be back in a bit," Greg said, making his exit.
"Yup. Is Hudders okay?" Sherlock asked.
Sensing an argument was about to erupt, Sherlock sat down next to John and pressed a kiss to his cheek. "John, I know how much you want to come and help me, but I can tell you're not at 100 percent. What if I call you from the crime scene and stream it on my phone. That way you can take a look for yourself and assist by video. What do you say?"
Mary, who was told of the Holmes’ actions earlier that evening by John and Molly, approached the foursome. She shot daggers at Mycroft and Sherlock. “You need to leave. John and Molly told me all about you, and if you don’t do as I say I’ll call the cops.”
Sherlock tends to a sick John and the two make some major decisions about their lives.
A stormy summer evening keeps the two lovebirds inside the flat.
Dave Morstan was driving around town making sure things were quiet and so far everything was calm. It was Labor Day, and many people had plans. He would be going to the Lestrade's barbecue later with his wife and daughter, trying his damnedest not to think about the murders but he knew it would probably be the only topic of conversation.
“A very interesting man by the name of Sherlock Holmes.”
Yay, an update! I've been busy starting my Christmas shopping, (and binge-watching 70's crime shows online). ;-D
Weeks after their initial meeting, John returned to Sussex and spent another glorious Sunday with Sherlock. This time, he helped him and the twins with their hives. Sherlock took a picture of John in a beekeeper outfit and sent it to a very amused and delighted Rosie.
Dave sat in his office, floored at what James had told him earlier today. But he couldn't make an arrest without getting evidence, and that meant requesting a search warrant. The town would be gobsmacked when there would be an arrest, but judging from what the bartender told James, and from what he knew, he could see why the killer did what he did, even if it was complete and utter madness.
Sherlock nodded. "Gloria Wilkes."
This time Sherlock blushed. "John you didn't. Those pet names were supposed to be private." But his voice had no heat or anger in it, and he pecked John on the cheek. "It is cute though."
"Your lunch bag has the initials H.W. on it. They've faded over time but still visible," Sherlock explained in a tone that sounded John should already know this.
Sherlock smirked and rubbed his hands together. This was going to be fun. "You don't have to tell me anything. I know you're former military due to your haircut - you could choose to grow it out but you're used to regulation length so you keep it that way. Before I came over to you, you reached up and self-consciously touched your left shoulder - so more than likely discharged due to an injury there, gunshot wound. You didn't come alone, but with a friend who is omega, as you have a faint trace of his scent on you, but he found an alpha that's trustworthy so you didn't have a problem leaving him and you're content to be by yourself. You don't own any pets, there's no scent of any other animals on you. You have a callous on your right middle finger caused by extensive writing, you must have kept a journal while you were in the military. The watch you're wearing looks masculine but is actually a woman's, it has a smaller face. Since you're in a gay club, it's not from a girlfriend, so either a sister or female friend."
Sherlock turned to face him, her eyebrows arched.
“A sheet is actually one of your most worn outfits, sherl.”
“I want to feel all of you.”
“I’m your mother darling. I thought there was something special between you, although at the time I just thought it was a very special friendship.”
“Hello, Sherlock. What an interesting name.”
“What brings you here?”
“What do you want to do?”
Sherlock’s.
“Alright. But...” John drawled, lowering his voice. “You have to stretch yourself... whilst I watch.”
“Gah!”
“Oh shut it you.”
He departed, and disappeared down the halls. He ordered coffee, and bit his lip to keep himself from telling the girl behind the counter that her clearly drawn on eyebrows just made her look permanently quizzical. He gave Mrs Watson hers, then went back to John, who had taken up his usual past time of staring at the wall.
“Where do you want to go first? The sweet shop? The art shop?”
I look at him from the corner of my eye.
“That was fast.” John said, his gaze switching between Sherlock and the wall.
Sherlock slowly swirled his tongue around the head, taking in the taste of pre cum. John groaned loudly, and threw his head back. Sherlock began to bob his up and down, comfortable with the weight on his tongue. He knew he could get four inches back before he’d start gagging, so he took in a little more.
"It was a guess. Anderson just has a much more punchable face."
“Ok, now I don’t have your gifts, you’re gonna have to tell me how you’re feel-“
I place my fingers under his chin, and tilt his head so he’s forced to look at me.
Mrs Holmes appeared in the door way, eyes wide at the sight of her two teenage sons having the first physical fight they’d had since Sherlock was six years old, which ended in him being shoved in to a chest of draws after he’d whacked Mycroft with a wooden sword. Mycroft was now sprawled over the table, newspaper discarded on the floor, and sherlock, also on the floor, was covered in jam.
With that, John slowly pushed inside Sherlock’s passage. Sherlock winced at the strange, imposing sensation spreading through him, and up his spine.
John will be returning soon! God, this story ended up being way more depressing than I planned.
“Thank you.” She said quietly.
“Come on then. We better make a move if we want to make that movie.”
"Always.”
“What about your chap?”
“John?” A woman’s voice asked on the other end of the phone.
John stared after Sherlock as he shrugged on his dressing gown, and disappeared down the hall. He sat on the bed, fiddling with the sheets, running them through his fingers, trying to take the focus off the pulsing erection between his legs. Sherlock was not only the first boy he’d been with, but the first person. He’d had a hand full of girlfriends, but it hand never gone very far. He had known Sherlock was the one for a while, but he had wanted to wait for Sherlock to make the first move. He was ecstatic that Sherlock was ready, and that their first times would be together. He knew it was cliche, but it was also kinda hot. The very thought that Sherlock had never been touched at all turned him on immensely. He got off the bed, and reached in to the pocket of his jeans to retrieve his phone. He scrolled through the list of songs, and selected ‘Ride’ by Lana Del Ray. He looked up upon noticing Sherlock’s presence. He was standing by the door, his cheeks flushed.
I frown at him for a moment before grabbing him by the ankles and throwing his legs over my shoulders.
John pursed his lips, but was soon distracted by Esme who was furiously tugging on his shirt collar, absolutely determined to get him to look at a peculiar rock she’d obtained from the floor.
“John?” She asked cautiously, slowly taking a stand.
The world was whirling, everything was upside down, time was spinning out of control.
“Shit! Baby, I’m sorry. Fuck, I’m hurting you. Shall I stop?”
“In about an hour.”
“Ok... What A-levels did you do?” I ask, wanting to start small.
“Sure.”
He twitches. He leans in to my touch. He stills.
“Are you Alright, John? You look a little tense.” Sherlock asked innocently.
“Sorry. I just get excited. He’s never had a friend over before.”
“There’s enough left for master John when he wakes up.”
“Against the door.”
Enjoy! Thanks for the comments, they really make me smile ;)
John bit back a chuckle as he watched the seductive display before him.
"It actually made me want to be a doctor."
John took a deep breath before grasping his cock and positioning his tip at Sherlock’s entrance.
God, I have got to stop watching porn.
Although our moments have gradually been increasing in their magnitude, they have yet to return to the extremity of that moment in the guard bubble, lack of opportunity and all that.
They walked side by side, playfully bumping each other with their shoulders. Sherlock felt all the sadness and frustration he’d felt that morning melt away. He couldn’t blame John for fucking up. They were both young, and of course they would make mistakes.
Another finger, and he cried out in pleasure.
“Joooohhhnnn...” I moan, my voice bouncing just as I do on his lap.
7th of April 1916
Sherlock could feel John’s erection pressing into his back, which fuelled his arousal. He shuffled awkwardly as he desperately resisted the urge to turn around again. His jeans were tented up in front of him, the inside of his boxers already damp.
“Are you sure?”
“Come now, darling, is that any way to greet a friend?”
*ring ring* *ring ring*
“It depends, what constitutes as weird for you?”
“Got Molly started on valentines, I see.”
This is so cringeworthy. I apologise. 😂 Also, it gets way smuttier later. 😜
John age: 15
Sherlock couldn’t help but grin.
Sherlock clambered out the side, and wrapped himself in his towelling dressing gown. John followed suit, and wrapped himself up before trailing after Sherlock in to the living room. The pair settled down in the front room, all curled up on the sofa. As they sat, Sherlock pondered how his day had started with an act that should have left him incredibly embarrassed, and ended with him making out with John in the bathtub. The universe works in strange ways, he thought, a quote made by someone who would probably curse him for applying it to his pig’s ear of a day.
“I’m sure he’s just a little busy.”
“I’m sure.”
“We’ll lie here for a minute, then go and get some tea, shall we? Mmm?”
“Sherlock!” Mike called out to a boy lent up against a table.
Sherlock spun around to see John, clad in full football gear, shoes coated in mud, sweat dotting his forehead. Sherlock felt his train of thought dithering as he stared at John.
Oh my god- Christ!
“Nothing really. I did a few experiments though.”
‘Amazing’ that’s what he called me.
“Why didn’t you say anything before?”
There was now a very noticeable bump beneath her dress that drew unwanted eyes and questions, shame too if it hadn’t of been for the diamond ring proudly displayed on her left hand.
I can’t believe this is actually happening.
“Sherlock?”
“John, that’s enough.”
I don’t know it’s only just dawned on me, but I know very little about him.
Sherlock’s giggling escalated to moaning as John continued to tease him.
Sherlock recalls what lead to him stood in his dorm covered in blood.
“I’m sorry about what happened yesterday.”
“Did you not see my status update on Facebook?” He chides softly as he runs his pale, spider like fingers over my bedspread. “I guess not.”
I’ve never been like this with anyone before. I don’t even really have friends. I have people I know, but they’re not my friends.
“So, where’s Gordon?
Enjoy!
“Oh god!”
Mycroft left the room when she heard a knock at the door, then returned with a nurse.
He was hot and hard, a simpering mess, unapologetically sounding out his desire to John. He needed John to touch him, but so far, John was keeping his mouth everywhere but where Sherlock needed him most. He ran his tongue back up Sherlock’s body, dipping it into his collar bone. He pressed kisses along his jawline, and proceeded to kiss at his nose and cheeks. Sherlock tried to move forward to catch johns lips in a kiss, but the blond sat back, just out of Sherlock’s reach. He whimpered in frustration, yanking his arms forwards in vane, his wrists aching.
The brunette murmured happily as he rolled back in to John’s arms.
There was no point trying to deal with him during this phase, and the easiest way to get him to the next one was to actually treat him like a toddler. John had made this discovery on Sherlock’s birthday. While trying to get Sherlock to stop biting him, John had shoved Sherlock’s thumb in to his mouth. The brunette calmed down, suckling his thumb, and fell asleep on John’s shoulder during the cab ride home.
“No, not yet.”
Sherlock smirked devilishly before pulling John to her again by his shirt collar. The couple left hand in hand, running, well, hobbling in Johns case, down the road in a fit of giggles.
“Thank you. Is it alright if I smoke?” He asked Mrs Holmes.
“This is Sherlock. He’s a friend from school. I told you I invited him.”
John chuckled, then quickly covered his mouth.
He looks down at my lips, up in to my eyes, then back at my lips before leaning in and kissing me.
“Fuck, what the hell is she doing back?” John groaned. He sat back up, and ran a hand through his hair.
He swallows and nods his head somewhat lethargically.
“And you, my dear, are very beautiful.”
It was clear Valentine’s Day was not Mollys favourite day of the year. Sherlock on the other hand, loved it. He had something very special planned for John tonight.
“Oh!” He exclaimed when John’s large hand first came in to contact with his ass.
Bad news for Sherlock.
“No.” I say tersely.
“The timetable changed. It was meant to be a cooking class.” John explained.
“Ugh!” She exclaimed as she wiped her mouth on the back of her hand.
“You! I’m yours! Only yours- Agh! You own me!” Sherlock howled, digging his heals in to johns back.
“Come on. Medical, and I mean it.”
“Please.”
"Morning, darling, John. How did you both sleep?"
Irene slapped a tray of shots down on the table before collapsing next to Molly.
“They’re battle scars.”
Sherlock drew up a list of names she liked, the fact that she’d rather a boy made very clear by her handful of girl names as opposed to the large number of boy names.
“What was that for?”
“Ah, So it was Peru. I thought so.”
“Somebody’s eager.” He rasps by my ear in a mirthlessly chuckle that makes my insides quiver.
“Anyway, I won’t keep you. I’m sure Sherlock is looking for you.”
“What have you taken?”
John caught sight of Sherlock’s grin from the corner of his eye.
“No, no, I like them just fine.”
“I-“ Sherlock stammered, his legs flailing.
John wasn’t sure how to respond to this. Although he’d only known Sherlock a short time, he was already rather fond of him.
I pull away from him for a moment; not quite confident enough to do this without looking. I fiddle with his belt buckle for a moment before moving on to his zipper. Without the confines of his navy blue trousers, I can see just how... big... He is... His boxers are red with a small, dark patch wetted with fluid.
"Good for ratings am I?" the killer wondered, cackling.
Sherlock smirked at John. "Are you flirting with me---"
The flyer advertised the annual "Back to School Sock Hop" for next Saturday at the Sherrinford Community Center from 7pm -10 pm. It was the perfect event to start the bloodbath, and there were so many victims to choose from. No one would see this coming and by the time the police would catch on it would be too late. Revenge would be gained, and this hypocritical town would finally pay.
Sherlock stood there for a few seconds, desperately willing his brain to compose itself, and the pooling heat in his belly and groin to cool down.
The Wilkes family is in crisis mode. Wanda prepares for her date with Hal.  Sherlock and John head for the beach.
"I got tired of laying there. Can I rest on the couch and listen to the radio?" John gazed at his mom with hopeful eyes.
Once they selected their lunches, they quickly eased into pleasant small talk. John discussed his transition from invalidated veteran to dom, bragged about his daughter, and even mentioned his encounters with Sherlock, which had the couple cracking up.
(See the end of the chapter for
The other man snorted. "These two are no ladies. They're whores. I pay them for good times if you know what I mean, and now they decide they don't want me around anymore, that my money's no good."
John grabbed Warren's shoulder with his right hand and squeezed down while continuing to stroke, his movements picking up speed. Warren began to shudder, lips now tightly pursed. John's own cock began to harden and twitch while pleasuring Warren, but he put it out of mind. He would take care of himself later.
Veronica looked up. "Oh Sherlock, you should be in bed."
*****
Slowly, Sylvia Hooper came to. "What---what happened?" She looked from Molly to Kitty in confusion.
Henry's face turned ghostly white, and nausea began to seep into his stomach. "Oh God---what happened?" Dave placed a steadying hand on his back.
"There are times when I see something, or hear something, and it reminds me of Sheridan. He would have loved it here. He would have made so many friends, and he would have liked you." The corners of Eurus' mouth slightly turned up in a small grin. Sherlock would have been so jealous." She frowned again and looked down at the grass. "I can't take back what I did. Maybe that's why my family hates me. They believe I'm not remorseful enough."
Doctor Watson turned his eyes back to me. "Don't worry about that Doctor," I told him earnestly. Sherlock has me and his brother for that."
As the three had a grand time throwing their homemade snowballs around, and then they used the rest of the mixture to make a snowman, actual snowflakes started to fall. Rosie stopped her play and stuck her tongue out, letting the wet flakes fall onto her tongue. "Mmm, cold!" she exclaimed. "Like the ones we made better."
John found himself without a client this evening. He was supposed to entertain a well-respected member of The Diogenes Club at one of the private suites, but he got called into an emergency shareholder meeting that would last several hours. John understood, and rescheduled him for the following Friday at five o'clock. He was now free to spend the evening with Evie. He'd picked her up from nursery and stopped in to get a to-go meal from KFC, which he pretty much avoided, but Evie had been asking for chicken nuggets, and they did serve green beans, so she would at least be getting a vegetable. The little girl was utterly delighted, happily exclaiming "chick nugs!" to her daddy, who couldn't help but smile. Mary would have been proud at the way she was beginning to talk more, combining words, even if most of them were just partial words.
"And I'll get the fire going," Sherlock added.
John opened his door and got in. "You drive your motorcycle?"
"Give him time," Dave had told the two. "He did the right thing by coming to the police, but in his mind, he's torn a family apart, and he's afraid you'll throw him out on the street."
"Oh yes! And he turned out to be a very large fourteen year-old who wanted money to buy baseball cards." Sylvia shook her head. "If we're going to have crime, I'd rather it be a purse snatcher than a psycho killer."
"I know. I just hope Sebastian is rational enough to realize I'm not this Quinn person, and I could never be like him and purposefully hurt and maim someone."
Sherlock just smiled and put his violin up to his chin, and began to play again, this time Winter Wonderland. John went into the kitchen to make hot chocolate, and reached into one of the cabinets to pull out the tin of Christmas cookies Mrs. Hudson had baked them, continuing their perfect Friday night.
John opened his eyes, lifting up his head, just realizing he'd drifted off to sleep. He let out a sleepy yawn and sat up, stretching his arms. He glanced down at his arms and legs, which were slightly red. He pulled his suntan lotion out of his bag and opened up the cap, rubbing the soothing lotion onto his legs. Harry would definitely tease him for forgetting to put it on.
He unconsciously kicked his lips, and Sherlock couldn't help but stare at the sight of his pink tongue darting out. It was just an ordinary habit, but on John it was extremely sensual.
*****
There were surprised murmurs among the crowed and Mike beamed at his old friend. Sherlock could have told everyone the two men knew each other.
He nodded. "Steve's there. We're still busy selling guns. I hate to thank that nut out there, but I haven't seen this much business in years."
Sherlock pouted, and John giggled again. "I'm just joking. I love taking care of you because I love you too." He kissed Sherlock's curls again, and the taller boy was instantly placated. "I should show up to class just in this sheet," Sherlock joked with a sly grin.
"Yes sir," she replied, and she was off to attend to her morning duties. Mycroft was grateful Anthea had agreed to come with them to California. She was one of the most efficient housekeepers the family ever had.
Sherlock arrived at the Leather and Lace office, which was a downstairs below where Irene and Molly lived, which they bought and turned into the reception area and work spaces. Janine was sitting at her desk, filing her nails, which today were painted bright purple. Upon seeing Sherlock, she flashed a predatory grin. "Well, hello gorgeous. Couldn't stay away from me, huh?"
Sherlock was about to reply, but then he heard a rustling sound in the distance. "What was that sound?"
Eurus was lying on the backseat, eyes closed tight and mouth open wide, enthusiastically letting her boyfriend Jim Moriarty know how good he was making her feel. The two had decided to spend the afternoon together, and a heated makeout session led to a bout of wild, passionate sex.
Greg bent down next to Sherlock as the detective began to examine the body. "Harsh words, but then again, that might be what he needed to hear."
Sherlock opened his mouth to retort, but John placed a hand on his shoulder and shook his head, giving the other boy a look that mentally said not now.
Irene watched her lover exit with a playful leer, then turned to John. “This arrangement could be beneficial, since you told me part of his ‘stalking’ was to keep you safe from this maniac on the loose.”
"If you must know Gavin, I'm doing a stakeout."
Hours later, John was now at his flat, lounging on the sofa in a pair of pajama bottoms and his old ROTC shirt, answering emails and booking appointments. Tomorrow, he'd pick Evie up and the two would spend the day together at the zoo before his busy workweek began. John had never been happier, and when the clock struck two-fifteen in the morning, he'd fallen into a peaceful sleep free of nightmares.
There was stone silence. Everyone was thinking it. The killer would be caught as soon as Principal Saxon named him. Then things would go back to normal, they would it should be.
Henry raised his head to look at his boyfriend. He saw Sebastian's pained gaze. "Oh Sebby, I'm so sorry," he whispered.
While Sherlock was yelling at Anderson for something John wasn't entirely sure, as it was Anderson and he was a person you just yelled at, John studied the body. The stab wounds were mostly to her chest and stomach, and the teacher had defensive wounds on the palms of her hands and wrists, so she fought her attacker and tried to shield herself from the stab. The murder weapon wasn't found, so either the killer brought it with them or found it somewhere in the school, perhaps in the kitchen. If they found the knife, maybe they worked at the school.
“Let’s forget about Mycroft and anyone else named Holmes, and have fun tonight,” John reassured his friend. Once the two entered the roller rink, the bright lights and the loud rock & roll music washed away Molly’s fears, and she broke out into a big grin.
"Well, you've got one with me. Glad?" Sherlock peered at him, his eyes, now a sparkling ice blue, and John felt like he was being devoured.
But before Harold could tell him who had attacked him, he blacked out, in true movie cliffhanger fashion. The doctors had put him under sedation, and he would be for a few more days.
Wilkes was “Big Seb,” a twenty year-old six foot lean but mean brown-haired machine with dark blue eyes. It was well known around town that Big Seb was a raging homosexual who preferred younger boys. He was out and proud and if anyone dared to call him a queer or a fag, he’d retaliate with his fists or a pocket knife he carried with him all the time. Big Seb’s family was rich, and their prominence kept him safe from the long arm of the law. It also helped that the boys he did go after had families who were afraid of having their children labeled as queer, so they kept quiet. The exception however, was John Watson.
Sherlock turned back towards John and nodded.
Before John could answer, the two women stepped forward. "This man protected us from a very nasty customer," the woman in white said appreciatively. He's been harassing us for weeks."
"I'll let you talk with him. Hold on." Wanda sat the phone down on the counter. "John, Mrs. H. wants to speak with you."
Teenage boys...what can I say? And do you like lil' Sophie Hunter?
"Your best dry red wine," Sherlock said, returning the grin.
Janine is having a slumber party. Carl Powers and his friends weren't invited but they still want to come anyway. Sherlock is back in Sherrinford and missing John, who is still in LA and gets some surprise visitors.
Things had been wonderful for them up until seventeen months ago. Sebastian had lost his warehouse job due to downsizing, and decided to become a male escort to make quick money. Jim didn't like it, but knew Sebastian was stubborn and would do it anyway no matter what he said, so Sebastian signed up with a company whose clients were wealthier, upscale gentlemen. Jim thought that Sebastian would be safer instead of selling his body on the streets, but he was wrong.
John quickly entered the house. He shut the door and slid down on the carpet. The living room was unbearably hot even with the windows open. But the stifling heat was not on his mind, just one boy who wasn’t taking no for an answer, and he didn’t know how long he could keep him away. Sherlock Holmes wasn’t like Sebastian Wilkes, or any other guy he’d met. This one was smart, too smart, and he had a feeling that he could do whatever he wanted and get away with it.
John hung up and started to bundle up, putting on his olive green parka with the faux fur hood, his black cashmere scarf Sherlock got him for his birthday nestled snugly against his neck, and his snow boots. He thought about getting a taxi but decided it would be easier (and less expensive) to walk, as the nursery was just a few blocks from the flat. And he didn't possess the seemingly supernatural ability that Sherlock apparently had in hailing a taxi. Once he was sufficiently dressed for snow, he was out the door.
"Sounds good, but how do we know what kind of car he's driving?" John wondered.
“We’ll talk about him later. Guess again love,” Irene replied.
John nodded. "Fish and chips from the new place down the street? I don't think I'm ready for any Chinese or Thai yet."
Sherlock grinned, putting an arm around John. This boring Saturday night definitely wasn't so boring anymore.
The day of the party was here, and both John and Warren booked a morning of pampering at an exclusive spa in downtown London. John had never had a massage, or a facial, or any of the beauty treatments women went through, so for him it was a little strange. Warren was used to it though, and had paid for everything, despite John's protest. He was making good money now and could afford more luxuries than he used to. Warren insisted, and said John could treat him to lunch, which he agreed to.
John looked up at Yvonne. "Okay Ms. Adler, I'll do it."
. The scientists from the first book will feature more prominently, and well, I hope you like the idea of a genetically engineered killer dog terrorizing the London countryside."
"Aren't you worried about the reaction if people see us walk in together?" Sherlock asked John pointedly.
The next week and a half couldn't come soon enough.
Sherlock nodded. John sighed and stroked Sherlock's hand with his fingers. "You need to stop blaming yourself for what happened. We didn't know he was armed with a knife. Everything turned out okay."
Jeremy sat down. "Do you remember anything about Friday?" He wanted to start off slow and not overwhelm him.
"Well, it certainly ended on a entertaining note." Victor grinned at John. "You know, I was going to kiss you before we were so rudely interrupted."
She felt strong arms wrap around her, and she smiled knowing it was her husband. "Hi honey," she sweetly greeted him.
The police, along with the mayor of Sherrinford, Jack Harkness, had placed a curfew on the town. Everyone had to be in by nine p.m. or they would face fines and/or jail time. Cops would share shifts patrolling the streets during curfew.
"No thank you, I'd rather walk." She began to move again, and Carl crawled along with her.
She watched him leave. "Looks like I'm not going into work. I'm not leaving my sick baby alone." She went into the kitchen and began to make phone calls to school and to her job.
“Couldn’t take no for an answer,” John interjected.
Sherlock looked up at him, eyes wide and gleaming. "You mean you're not going to make me open one each day?"
You want creepy, predatory Mycroft? You got it! Plus, Victor is a sad gay baby, Greg is a sad straight baby, and Sherlock shows up at the end just to give us a dash of the sexy.
John laughed, and affectionately bumped Sherlock with his shoulder.
Mrs Holmes smoked down at her grandson, then look back at Sherlock with a curious expression.
Shit, that took a grand total of three minutes.
“No, no, no, no.” John rambled, reaching out to grasp Sherlock’s wrist. “It’s... hot.”
“Mmmm...” He moaned appreciatively, responding with a thrust of his own.
John pulled back to look at Sherlock in surprise. Although the couple had been going out a few months, Sherlock still seemed unsure when it came to initiating anything. His eyes searched john’s as he waited for an answer. John leant in, and pressed a kiss to his temple.
Sherlock and John spend more time together, and find out more about each other.
“I’m sorry, I can’t eat anymore. I have to go lie down.”
Doctor Hooper asks as she looks at me over her clip board.
She heard John chuckle softly.
“Jolly good violin by the way.”
“Five to.”
“Oh shit... fuckinggggh hell... oh JOHN!”
Dear john.
“I want to stay with John.”
He took the footballs from Sherlock without a thank you, then effectively shooed him away.
John managed to remove the hot pink plug from Sherlock’s pulsing hole, and turned off the buzzing object. Sherlock visibly relaxed, and flopped forwards on the bed, cheeks flushed pink, eyes rolling about in his skull.
It wasn’t the most comfortable of ways to sit, Sherlock sat sideways with his back against the arm rest, John knelt on his chair, settled between Sherlock’s legs.
Now that I think about it, if I hadn’t been high as a kite, I still don’t think I would have understood what was going on.
“They keep teasing me.”
“Alright, we should go. Come on girls. Have fun, honey.”
Sherlock stared down at the plate of food in front of her, and picked up a forkful. She  hesitated for a moment before forcing it past her lips. She only managed to swallow another two mouthfuls before she felt sick. She pushed the plate away from her, and took a big gulp of water.
“I’m a medical student.” He explains to both of us.
“Anywhere in mind?”
He deposited the gag in the basket along with strawberry lube. That was Sherlock’s favourite. Said boy had currently wandered off, and was seemingly transfixed by a display of animal ears.
Sherlock was pleased with this reaction, and took it as his cue to continue. He opened his mouth, and enveloped his lips around the mushroom head.
“What?”
He was going to loose his virginity.
Mrs Holmes placed a pair of navy blue, pyjama trousers and a long, white sleeved shirt in his hands.
Was inscribed on the back in Mrs Holmes’s hand writings
“Joh-nnnn.” Sherlock gasped out in a breathy moan.
“Yes.”
After a few more minutes, they both began to feel drowsy.
“I was tested when I came here, anyway. I’m completely clean.”
He felt Sherlock’s whole body seize up suddenly, a long, drawn out whine escaping him. A wet sensation spread to the front of his jeans. Sherlock had cum all over himself, his ejaculate soaking both their jeans. Sherlock stilled completely, his breathing shaky. He looked so small as he sat in John’s lap, clearly embarrassed about what had happened.
“All clean?”
John stood up, and headed for the door. He paused for a moment, then turned back to Sherlock. He placed his fingers under the younger boy’s chin, tilted his face up, and connected their lips in a parting kiss.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks, his blood running cold.
John guffawed a laugh.
He grins.
John couldn’t get enough of him. He wanted to touch every inch of him, kiss every inch of him. He moved his hands down Sherlock’s body, lightly raking his skin with his nails.
“Mmm... Come on... we need to get up.”
“This.”
“How are you feeling darling?” Her mother asked in a soothing tone.
The contents in the bag stood at a pair of stockings, a suspender belt, a lacy thong, a cat collar, and a pair of black kitten ears, because one can never own too many.
That bastard.
“Oh... hey guys.”
“That was fun.” John chuckled as he did his fly back up.
Hope you guys enjoy this. Not long till John caves...
After letting him dither for a moment, John spoke.
“Oh come off it, John. No one is going to believe you were giving me a prostate exam.”
“Fuck... oh...”
He takes the bait.
His head is lolling about as if it’s suddenly becoming to heavy for the rest of him.
“Green.” Sherlock breathed, his eyes heavy.
“Ok, sure.”
Sherlock is curled up on a plastic chair in the common room, book in hand, tea in a mug on the floor, long legs folded up under him.
Sherlock was right. Clubs really did suck.
“Yes.” I groan with a roll of my hips, a sultry grin playing on my lips.
“Look at me John... shaking.” She said, gesturing to the teacup filled to the brim with stone cold liquid sloshing about.
“Of course. Is there anything you wish for me to report to mummy and daddy?”
“Yes. They’re my favourite. I have custard creams if you don’t like them.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows, his icy orbs searching Johns gunmetal blues. “Close your eyes, and don’t open them till I say so.” John ordered.
“I know darling, I know. He would be here if he could.” The eclectic woman murmured softly in to her daughter’s hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wet your hair now.” John said finally as he reached round Sherlock for the shampoo.
Those were the three words that would haunt Sherlock for years, although she didn’t know it.
“Greg, and he’s at work.”
Sherlock squirmed, his cock already hard again, pulsing angrily.
“Greg, and he’ll be here at four.”
I take fast showers, and I’ve learnt to like oatmeal. Killing a man isn’t exactly the next step. No, I believe that’s developing an obsession for reality television.
“It’s only cos he never has friends over, or dates-“
“Oh, that one’s lovely. You must wear a cardigan though, it’s cold out.”
John chuckled against Sherlock’s neck before moving down to place kisses along the brunette’s chest. Sherlock threw his head back, eyes closing in pleasure.
“I do believe you’re right... about that...” Sherlock groaned as he raised his arms for John to pull his shirt over his head.
“Sherlock.” Her mother said in warning.
“Good observation, Rosie. But yes, brunch. Sounds great. Doesn’t it Sherlock?”
Sherlock smiled against johns lips.
“I don’t think I can stand.” Sherlock responded honestly, his legs shaking.
That was a woman’s voice.
No number of mornings together will change that.
“You make me so fucking horny.”
“Come on. Medical, and I mean it.”
“Then turn the fuck around.” John ordered. Sherlock shivered before turning around again, on his knees, bent on his elbows, ass in the air.
John hung up, and went to his room to get his jacket. When he wore this uniform, he wasn’t John anymore, he was a soldier.
Sherlock looked up at John, a coy smirk on his face.
A few inmates watch our decent, but none of them intervene.
He rolls his eyes to himself then laughs.
He cupped Sherlock’s chin with his large hand, making him look at him.
“Well, as long as you think you’re beautiful, it doesn’t matter.”
“Hello Mrs Holmes.”
She handed over an envelope.
“Hello.”
“I said I’m fine!” John snapped.
“Oh fuck...” Sherlock moaned, tugging at Johns hair, pulling him closer.
“You should sit down.”
“I want you so bad... I want to know how it feels to have my cock inside your tight, pretty little ass.”
It was slippery, steamy and hot, the whole room echoing with screams of pleasure.
"Yes." Sherlock responded from the hall.
It’s a blur.
“It’s ok.”
John sat back with a grin, and applied a generous amount of lube to his fingers. He moved forwards again, and slowly parted Sherlock’s legs, dragging his fingers up his inner thighs till they were right by Sherlock’s tight ring of skin.
He reaches towards me, and gently brushes my cheek with the pad of his thumb.
“Thank you.”
"I never saw any point to it."
“Have a good day at work, honey.” I tease, still holding his hand.
"What did you do that for?" He asked, his attention going to the newspaper.
Sherlock stuck out her tongue, but Mycroft didn’t notice as she went to get the door.
Forget our different circles, now... now we are in our own little bubble.
“Tell me to stop at any point ok?”
I let out a quiet whimper, but John definitely hears it, I can tell that much by the grin that appears on his face.
They were actually going to have sex.
“We don’t have to do this if you’re not ready.”
“Yeah,” John started, unsure as to why Harry was being all... ‘sisterly’ towards him. “I’m fine.”
John lent down, and pressed a kiss to her lips, cold and chapped in the early April morning.
“Hi.”
“This is why I hate clubs!”
3rd of July 1917
“Where’s Jonny?”
As of now, I’m loitering in the utility cupboard down the hall from commissary whilst I wait for John to finish in the dorms. After numerous, tedious minutes of waiting, the arcane pattern of knocks sound on the other side of the door.
Sherlock had never tried on so many clothes before. The first thing he tried were some high rise jean shorts which he matched with a pink off the shoulder top. He awkwardly stepped through the curtain where the three girls were waiting for him.
“Thank you.”
“So how did you find yesterday?”
“Thank you mama.” She babbled as she pushed a curly blonde lock away from her dark blue eyes.
“Does She now?”
We have a few moments together, but those moments are always ‘a moment where I don’t have to be supervised’ and ‘a moment where he’s not on duty’.
I think he knows this too as he brings one of his hands down to my ass, running his fingers down the seam of my trousers.
“Sorry.”
“I’ll get it!”
It’s only when I hear John murmur a breathy ‘fuck’, that I realise I’ve said this all out loud.
Sherlock gripped his hands back.
“Sorry about that.”
He grins, and I can feel myself relax.
John rolled his eyes before pulling her up from the floor to sit on his lap.
“Shit. I just got a blow job in a cupboard.”
“Are you Alright?”
I don’t want to go to lunch. I’m not hungry. I never really am, and yet I find myself being dragged along to lunch everyday. Although, now of course, I have a reason. The guard is standing by the wall, standing straight, hands behind his back, eyes forward. He really is a military man...
“God you two are becoming a serious traffic hazard.”
“How is John?”
“Stay.” Was all he said.
“You mean sexual intercourse?”
I get to go home, and lock John in behind me.
Sherlock worried her lower lip between her teeth.
Then he felt Johns lips against his own, and johns hands in his hair, and he felt himself relax.
Every time one of them missed, they took a swig. After the first few misses, the gaps between swigs got a lot shorter.
The words hung in the air for them both to stare at, before Sherlock tried desperately to take them back and shove them away again, John not letting her, instead grabbing on to them and pulling them towards him.
“Sorry to disturb you sir. Telephone for you.”
“Your sofa is weird.”
At the end of the hour, he’d started arguing with a bloke about the lyrics to a Brittany Spears song. The girls took this as their cue to drag him away, kicking and shouting, and throwing cocktail olives in the direction of the bloke. Rosie spent most of the cab ride trying to stop Sherlock from putting his tongue in her ear, and sticking his head out the window.
Epilogue
His leg is healing.
Not sex... that’s too much now, but I want to touch him.
“Thank you, Sherlock. I’m so glad he has a friend like you.”
“Yeah, I love you too.” He said quickly, batting sherlock’s hands away from his waistband.
“Ah! Ah! Ah!” Sherlock groaned as John rammed his cock further inside him with each buck of his hips.
“There is a girl in your room, your hair is mused, your shirt is buttoned wrong, and your neck is covered with hickeys.” Sherlock inhaled sharply. “Need I go on.”
It’s too risky to go back to our break room. We got lucky with Irene. Someone else might have caused a lot more pain than a rather illegal favour... that has been dealt with and will never be spoken about again...
John arrived at two o’clock on the dot.
“You don’t know that.”
Sherlock shook his head.
"What?"
“You and John are staying here, right?”
“I wanted to be here. For Sherlock.”
“Well then let’s just hope he finds himself somebody the same way we found each other.”
He wasn’t sure where he was supposed to look, whether to close his eyes, whether to look at the ceiling. His heart was pounding, threatening to break his ribs, his lungs were desperately scrambling for oxygen, his brain short circuiting.
“Let’s do it.”
“Why does it matter where we are?” He whispers after a moment, sliding along the desk so our legs are touching.
John returned to the kitchen, and saw that the girls had relocated to the sofas.
“Where do you want it?”
“This will sting. I apologise in advance.”
“Piss off.”
“God, I want to do things to you.” John groaned as he brought his hand down in between their bodies.
“Even more of a reason not to go.”
“No, but I said to mike this afternoon I needed a new lab partner, now here he is with an old school friend. He doesn’t take chemistry. His next lesson is French, which is on the other side of the building. He wouldn’t have come all the way down here just to introduce you.”
Sherlock hesitated for a moment, then opened his eyes to look at John. He felt a wave of courage hit him as they stared at each other.
"You're so creepy." John chuckled as he crawled over to Sherlock.
“I’m five and a half.” Sherlock said, her attention splitting between Mrs Watson and their surroundings.
“How did you sleep?” Mrs Watson asked.
Sherlock tilted his head back so he was upside down as he looked at John.
“Can we sleep for a while?”
“Somebody should wear it. I’m sure John will love it.”
Sherlock rolled his head in John’s direction so the blond could kiss him.
He’s gentle at first, but soon he’s forcefully thrusting his tongue in to my mouth while he runs his hands down my body. I can’t help but let out a series of moans between kisses as pleasure courses through my veins. I feel myself getting hard as our kisses deepen, a rather noticeable tent forming in the front of my trousers. I don’t have much time to think about this before John grips my hips and hoists me up on to the table.
“You still good for tonight?”
“Could I have some chocolate milk?”
“Do you want me to fuck you or not?”
“Look after her John!” Mrs Holmes called from the porch.
“Because I fucking said so.” He barks.
“I forget I can ask now.”
“When no one talks to you, you use your own ways of finding out stuff about them. I forget that I don’t need to do that all the time.”
Sherlock noticed John wince beside her, then shake his head.
“Do you remember how excited my mother was when you came here for the day?”
"A little. But she doesn't even acknowledge we're there." Mycroft said calmly, sipping at her tea.
The metal is cold against my skin. If I swallow, he’ll cut me.
“I threw the racket up instead of the ball. It just... came straight back down...”
We lay like that, legs intertwined, fingers interlocked as we drift off to sleep.
I glare at him, but this only seems to broaden his grin. He falters after a second, and breathes in deeply.
Sherlock tried to hold back a giggle, her mind set on being annoyed.
“Yes.”
“Do I have to be there?”
“Yes! Yes! There! Oh god, don’t sto- Agh!”
“John, I miss you so much.”
As I become more comfortable with the weight on my tongue, and manage to fight off the intrusive thoughts of ‘oh my god, John’s cock is in my mouth’, I begin to experiment a little.
“Does this happen a lot?” Sherlock asked as they slipped passed the chemistry lab, where lestrade was no doubt waiting to corner them.
“Well, What do you want to do?”
“I love you too. So much.” He added, brushing Johns nose with his.
“Right, well I’m not your friend, I’m your commanding officer. From now on, you’re Thompson.” John said coldly. He regretted his tone of voice instantly, but didn’t say anything. He couldn’t afford to care about Thompson. He would probably end up dead. There was no point getting attached. But he could have been kinder. He knew first hand how daunting it was to arrive here. You wouldn’t know how long it would be till you could see your family. You would have to sleep in a cold, hard bed. And no one could prepare you for the knowledge that death was always following you, pressing a barrel of the gun to your head, waiting to pull the trigger.
“What’s wrong?”
“Watch his head.” Mrs Holmes said as Sherlock placed the baby in lucy’s arms.
“John darling, are you sure you’ll be alright down here?”
-lots of love Sherlock xxx
I’ve been given some ideas already including dirty talk, and I am currently working on that. ;)
He undid the knot, and let the towel fall to the floor. John gasped when he felt Sherlock’s lips wrap round his cock.
“Get out.”
A few hours later, John walked Sherlock home.
“Yeah, sure. Anything in particular?” John asked as he nuzzled Sherlock’s nose.
Although Sherlock had already worn his new clothes to one of his lectures last week, and that was all well received, this was a rugby game. The atmosphere here was a little different to a bunch of nerds listening to a ninety year old professor ramble on about carbon. Rosie didn’t want to leave him on his own.
She was sad and uncomfortable.
John narrowed his eyes at him, but a smirk tugged at his lips regardless.
“It could be.”
“I want to make you scream, make you cry my name. I’m going to shag you senseless.”
“We gotta go.”
Sherlock looks thoroughly fucked.
“You were right about the new guards.” I tell him.
“Oh god...”
“Are you sure?”
“I love you so much.”
“What...?” I ask, furrowing my brows.
Sherlock nodded, and allowed John to spoon feed him.
They had both been given very basic sex education their biology class, but that started with a talk on what periods were, and ended with being told not to have sex. Sherlock had overheard gossip in school, and looked in to the medical side of things from a scientific interest. John on the other hand had practically been strong armed in to listening to locker room talk, or trench talk...
As soon as the door shuts, I push his supple form up against it.
Sherlock wasn’t sure how long she’d been screaming. She wasn’t sure she was still screaming. She couldn’t hear her own voice anymore.
John grinned, and turned to look down at the brunette.
He was still lose from where he’d stretched himself earlier, but John wanted to make sure he wouldn’t get hurt, so he slipped a finger in to work him open further.
She followed her father into a gazebo, where he poured out some tea for them.
John’s voice tears me from my thoughts.
There’s shouting. There’s shouting and screaming.
“So warm and tight for me- oh fuck.”
Enjoy
“Mmmm... we should go to sleep. Getting you off really tires me out.” John stated dryly, making Sherlock turn a bright shade pink.
He inhaled the smoky air, breathing it down, warming his insides. He put his feet together, and brought his hand to his head in a parting salute.
The blonde inhaled deeply.
He’s deducing me.
John opened his mouth to say something, but closed it again.
John age: 16
John chewed the inside of his cheek as he tried to fight of a grin.
I tell her she can.
“Officer.” He nods respectfully, standing before me with his hands neatly folded behind his back.
He chuckles at my initiative, and responds to it by moving his hands down to my waist. I feel myself hardening at this, but I don’t care.
Sherlock age: 14
“I didn’t want to do it... He’ll never come home now. His family will never see him again. They’ll just be sat there waiting... waiting for him to walk through the door. But he won’t.”
“I love you so much, you know?” John murmured, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s stomach.
Sherlock lifted his head to give John a small nod. He felt excited, exhilarated and aroused as he always did when they tried new things. There were a few things he’d not taken to, but that didn’t stop him being optimistic. He let out a squeal when he felt the foreign object at his entrance. This was similar to when John fucked him with a dildo so he settled with it fairly quickly.
This time it was because she didn’t need to.
“What’s happened. Is it about John?”
“What time is it?” John asked in alarm.
John smirked back with a wink.
“Fuck me as hard as you can... hurt me... treat me like the dirty criminal I am...” he gasps in a raspy whine as he rolls his hips up in to my touch.
Sherlock had never been speechless so many times in his life. What was this boy doing to him?
JOHN’S POV
I haven’t smoked since my army days, but there’s a very real chance Sherlock will get home before me and might start making his own jelly.
“I’ll be there.”
John looked at the brunette quizzically from his spot on the floor.
Sherlock steered them into his room, and fell on top of his bed. He very quickly mounted johns hips, straddling his waist.
She opened her mouth to say something, but what could she say?
It stings, fuck it stings.
“Ah!” He gasped, his nerves tingling.
“I’ve had seven orgasms in the past two hours. I’m so- uncomfortable- mmmnngghh!” He sobbed. “And in a decent amount of paaaainnnn- ah!”
“You know you could help me.”
Sherlock struggles to bond with her new baby
He falters for a moment, his eyes scanning my face before he leans in to kiss me, soft and gentle.
“Oh. Well I guess I see that. I mean, that is after all, Why I’m here.”
“You know... well, you probably guessed... I liked that- What you said, I mean.”
“Me too.”
He still doesn’t say anything, but he wriggles closer stretches his legs out to tangle them with mine.
Credit to Zee for the ‘hair shaving’ prompt.
“Shit.”
“We’ll get him out of there. Have faith.”
“Sherlock?”
“What?”
I don’t need to be told twice, and make no hesitation in prepping him.
It was exciting, arousing, thrilling.
“I guess I’ll go home and get changed.”
Sherlock and John got into bed, and turned out the lights. Sherlock could only hope John couldn’t hear him crying himself to sleep.
“Jesse Christ- oh god- fucking hell... John!” Sherlock cried as he buried his entire fist inside himself.
“I’m here.”
“We’ll have to do this again.” He purrs as he leans in to nuzzle my nose.
John took a better look at the brunette, and saw that his bottom half was drenched in his own ejaculate, his cock red and engorged.
“I ummm... I thought we could go out for dinner tonight.”
“Oh, I see. There I was thinking this was a conjugal visit.”
“John... ah!”
“Agh!” John groaned, his jaw clenched as he watched Sherlock move his mouth down his length. He thought he’d loose it then and there when Sherlock hollowed his cheeks, and swallowed more of his achingly hard cock.
“What?” Sherlock asked nervously.
“You’re so beautiful.” He said finally, using all his will power to look up from between her thighs.
Sherlock followed John down the stairs and into the kitchen, where Mrs Hudson had laid out spaghetti.
He doesn’t need me to do anything, he doesn’t need me to say anything. He just needs me to be here.
Sherlock followed John down the stairs back to the party, and sat with their parents, siblings, and friends as they waited for the countdown. Sherlock and John had both been given some champagne, and had been sipping at it faster than they should have. It was fair to say both of them were rather tipsy.
“So, What do you want to do?”
At this, he pressed a gentle kiss on Sherlock’s head, hoping to wake him as even though he was right there, John found himself missing his company.
“God... Yes... agh...”
“I really do. Love him.”
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?!”
This makes him smirk.
“Alright. Do you need anything?”
Ok, I can do this. I can do this. I want to do this.
“Do you need me to stop?” He asked softly, pressing a gentle kiss to her cheek.
“I’ll miss you too. I’ll come home and visit, and... well you can’t actually come and see me... I guess I could sneak out to see you.” Sherlock said with a smirk.
Sherlock nodded, and settled down on the floor in front of him with her second cup of tea.
“Alright?” John asked, peering at Sherlock through his knees.
“Hand me the lube.” He panted out, eyes slightly bleary.
“Sherlock, you needn’t worry. I only have eyes for you.” John tried to reassure her, affectionately squeezing her hand. She furrowed her brows.
Hope you guys enjoy.
“Definitely.”
Sherlock inhaled deeply when she remembered how it was only five months now. That may seem like a lot of time, but not when you’ve got what feels like a time bomb inside you, just waiting to go off, and destroy everything in its path when it goes off, including Sherlock herself.
“Why should I?” I tease, digging my nails in to his thighs.
“What?”
“I didn’t think John was short was Jonathan.” She said, referring to the boys father.
“Yes, I’m fine. How are you?” He asked.
“Oh right.”
“John...” he gasped in pleasure as he threw his head back.
Sherlock and John come to the realisation that the latter may not be home for the arrival of their child.
“She didn’t believe me, but I managed to convince her.”
Train tomorrow cancelled. Excellent. Yes, you have plenty of warning to sort out a back up, only that back up happens to be a day earlier! So, no, having to pack hastily to get a train back to London that was departing in the next hour was not ideal, but at least he got to see Sherlock a day early. He gazed fondly at his lock-screen as he listened to the general noise of the train. It was cliche, and cheesy, he knew that, but he couldn’t help himself but set it as a picture of him and Sherlock kissing under a mistletoe. He rolled his eyes as he read through the text messages from the brunette.
“Can I walk you home?”
He snapped out of his daze, and looked up at her with his gunmetal blue eyes, tears brimming in them.
“Ok.”
“What is it?” John asks, slowly moving to stand closer to me, his fingertips just brushing mine as our hands hang limp between our bodies.
“What kind of a question is that?”
“Here.” I say, offering him an earbud as I move to sit with him on the floor.
He takes a big sigh, and looks back up at me.
I wait another hour till I can clock out, then go to find him.
John rolls his hips forward, pushing his cock even further inside me.
“God, there are so many things I want to do to you.” John groaned, his eyes hungry as they roamed Sherlock’s lithe body.
“Oh, Sherlock darling.”
I keep to my slow pace until my hips are snug up against him.
After catching his breath, he pulled out his softening cock, and rolled on to the bed beside Sherlock.
John entered the room, and settled down next to Sherlock.
John pressed his finger back in to her dripping, wet heat, and slowly began to pump his finger in and out.
He only had ten minutes to get down the road to Sherlock’s. He also had to get dressed and eat something. He cleaned himself up, then quickly pulled on a fresh pair of boxers.
“Sherlock? Are you listening to me, darling?”
“No.”
“Yes... I am.” Sherlock panted between kisses.
Sherlock went to rekindle the kiss, but John pulled back.
“Baby, You could never disappoint me.” John said softly, cupping Sherlock’s cheek.
When John came back with the bag, he had a devilish smirk on his face.
“These are something else, aren’t they?”
Sherlock woke earlier than he wanted to on a Saturday, but he didn’t even care. John had kissed him. John liked him. John promised he would lie to himself anymore. Sherlock had butterflies in his stomach, which had also spread to his groin. He knew the expression ‘ants in your pants’ but this was ridiculous’. He looked under the covers, and saw a tent in his pyjamas. He had a working knowledge of biology, but it was too early in the morning to apply it to this moment. He glared down at the imposing erection, and foolishly tried to push it back down. This plan sort of backfired as the contact sent a wave of sensations along his cock, and up his spine. He tried to silence a moan at the feeling. He slid his pyjamas and boxers down his hips, revealing his fully erect cock. He noted that the length had increased once hard, now close to five inches. He felt a sense of embarrassment as he reached down to touch himself. He let out a low wine as his long, nimble fingers came into contact with the soft, delicate skin. He gently gripped his fingers around his length, and began to move his fist. The pleasure that began to spread throughout his body, his every nerve, had him reeling. He increased his pace, which only made him moan louder. He shoved his fist into his mouth as he worked himself, his movements becoming sloppy. A pressure was building in his abdomen. He guessed he was getting close, and hurried his actions, desperate for release. As he came, there was one word on his lips.
They arrived at the university, and walked through to the lecture hall. A few students were already in their seats, scattered around the hall. A handful of them turned to look at Sherlock when he came in. He gripped johns hand a little tighter. One or two looked confused, but no one said anything. Sherlock felt himself relaxing by the second. His professor gave John permission to sit in, and barely noticed Sherlock’s outfit.
I notice Sherlock hesitate for a moment before he complies, and pulls his sleeve up to expose his arm.
He pulls his lips in to a thin line.
I read about the ‘lube cubes’ in Cosmo. They have some good shit in there 😆.
“Yeah, yes I’m fine. Thanks for asking, and uh, for the tea.”
Sherlock reaches over to grab his hand. It wasn’t spasming. Initially she’d believed it was a form of PTSD, but then she’d noticed that when he was stressed, like in moments such as this one, it stopped.
When he pulls back to look me in the eye, his are predatory, lit with a fire I’m afraid will burn me alive if I’m not careful.
"Mycroft, is that you?"
"Now love, be nice. Mycroft has really come around, even finding a mate for himself. And Anthony is a great guy."
John stood up to kiss Sherlock. "Perfect."
John was sitting on a bench at Regent's Park, hot cup of tea in his hand, Evie napping in her pram, when he ran into an old school friend, Mike Stamford. Mike told him an acquaintance of his was looking for a flatmate and that perhaps John would be perfect. He wasn't so sure.
"Okay honey. You two be careful, and if you need me, you have Charlie's number."
As soon as the doors closed, Sherlock walked by. Neither man noticed the other.
Big Seb slid down next Jim and leaned back against the tree trunk, taking a long hit off his joint. He blew out the smoke and grinned. “Now this is the life man.” He put the blunt in front of Jim. “You want some?”
It was at this time that Sherlock appeared. His dark curls were plastered to his sweaty face, and he was only wearing pale blue pajama bottoms. "Mummy? Eurus?" he softly called.
Dave and Jody exchanged grave expressions. Things just escalated to a whole new level. The killer was spiraling out of control. And if he wasn't caught soon, another person would lose their life.
"Oh, I think Sherlock will appreciate
John was not quite ready to date yet, but he didn't want to be stuck at home all the time, so one Saturday night, he went out to a pub for a pint and chips. His employer's wife had agreed to watch Evie for the evening.
John didn't believe that theory. He wasn't sure why, but he felt it was too easy a motive. He was sure the unseen prowler was the killer, and he felt that the person responsible had planned to do this, and Sally and Phillip were chosen because they were alone in a dark place. Anyone there could have been a victim. Whoever did this wanted to kill simply because they wanted to, and skin color didn't matter. He wasn't going to rush to tell the police what he felt. They wouldn't take stock in a sixteen year-old. He knew until something else came up, the belief that it was racial would stay.
*****
Sherlock turned to face him, still holding his hand, and he was frowning. "Don't tell me you've changed your mind. You promised me we'd be together tonight.
"How about lunch? There's a good Chinese place across the street," Victor offered.
"I have those every now and then," John playfully replied.
John wondered if it was raining in Miami, and even if it was, it certainly wasn't the chilly, painful kind. He welcomed a warm rain, especially if it involved palm trees and a vast blue ocean. But for now, he was standing in a classroom at Beacham Primary Prep, a private school in the heart of a wealthy London district, looking down at the body of early years teacher Cynthia Delbridge, a once attractive thirty-year old with curly strawberry blond hair and a face full of freckles, now lying on the floor near her desk, nineteen stab wounds the reason for the loss of her life. Blood was on the chalkboard, on the floor, and on the walls near the desk. It had been a horrific murder.
"Definitely. Our family's had such shit luck for such a long time it's nice things are looking up, especially before Christmas. It may actually be nice going back home to celebrate this year."
Trigger for mild homophobia and talk of homosexuality.
Veronica and Sidney were surprised to see John at their door. Surprised...and a little apprehensive. Sherlock wanted to tell John about Sheridan and they were terrified of the repercussions. Would John leave, never wanting to see Sherlock again? Would he run to the police? Would they have to move again? The two were nervous to say the least as they watched the two boys head outside.
Hal switched the radio to the jazz one John was listening to earlier. "I think it's the only one not talking about the murders."
Sherlock pressed a kiss to John's hair. "Have you had many patients with a sinus infection?"
John bust out laughing again. "I haven't had this much fun on a date since my first date with Mary."
"Oh that's a relief. Also, I'm heading to my sister's. The power is out in the building so there's no heat. I called an electrician but due to the storm I don't know if he'll be able to come soon enough to fix the wiring, so I let him know I wouldn't be here. Mrs. Turner and her boys have also left."
"Hey Sherlock it's John."
Molly hopped up and hugged her parents. "Thanks. I'll go call him." She headed for the house.
Sherlock was gazing down at the ground when Brett tapped his arm. "Dad, it's Mr. Watson and Rosie!" he said happily.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Well I am interested...John.”
As for the French maid and the pirate, they decided not to stick around and to admire each other's shoe choice back at Sherlock's flat. John texted Harry to let him know he was leaving with Sherlock.
“Hey Molly, Mike was telling me tonight about this new family that moved into Irene’s neighborhood. They’re British. You know anything about them?”
“Better pay me that compliment brother-in-law. Myc didn’t need to do anything. The Yard already had a file on him.”
"Your dad is ape Little Seb," Art Doyle said, but with envy. "I can't believe he encouraged you to do this. I had to tell my folks I was going with Carl and all of you to the movies. If they found out I'm going to play peeping tom they'd tan my hide so raw I wouldn't be able to sit for a month!"
"Seventeen to my flat and back down," Sherlock said. I noticed he was gazing at Doctor Watson with a weird look on his face.
"Daddy's going to make hot chocolate when we get home!" Rosie announced.
"Yeah my hot dancers, I just gave you a love hangover courtesy of Miss Diana Ross. I know you're still wanting to boogie, and my next diva is up for you. Let's see if we can try Donna Summer and make it!"
Sherlock frowned harder. "You're not going are you?"
"I'm going to murder that child," Veronica seethed. "How could she keep something like this from us? I've been worried sick about Sherlock!"
"You know I will." Henry shuddered at Sebastian's soft mouth on his skin. Despite his reputation for being a tough troublemaker, Sebastian was a very attentive and affectionate lover, and he would always feel grateful for him and his parents taking him in after his own parents died, and his aunt and uncle refused to have him come live with them due to his homosexuality. Luckily, Sebastian's mother and father didn't care about sexual preference. They were happy that Sebastian had someone to love, which kept him calm and satisfied, for the most part. His temper did flare up now and again, and Henry had given him a piece of his mind the day he came home bleeding after being cut up by Eurus Holmes.
Mrs. Watson was shocked to finally see the boy who had attacked her son; she was expecting a burly, brawny roughneck, not an impossibly tall, thin, pale child with delicate features. He wore a loose, white button down short sleeved shirt with several buttons undone, showing off his milky white chest, and tan shorts. He left his dark hair ungreased, revealing loose curls on top of his head.
Sherlock kissed him again. "I know you don't like feeling useless, but believe me, you staying here and taking care of yourself so you can be at your best when we get the next call for a case is extremely worthwhile to both me and the work." He got up and grinned at John. "I love you, and I'll call you as soon as I get to Regent's."
"Yes, and so is Daddy," Sophie said with a wink, also shaking John's hand. Sherlock looked away, blushing and smiling sheepishly.
There was a buzz of conversation as everyone left, trying to wonder what had happened to interrupt yet another school day. Sherlock had met up with Mycroft and Eurus in the parking lot. Mycroft and Eurus would be heading home in the Aston-Martin. Sherlock had other plans, and he hopped on his bike and sped away.
The detective followed his curly-headed daughter out into the white marshmallow winterscape, expecting to see imprints of John and Rosie's bodies on the ground. He was not expecting the display shown in the middle of the rooftop.
John obeyed, and shivers began to ripple through his body. As for Sherlock, he couldn't wait to use the new anal plug John chose. They would definitely still make use of the other one, but for tonight, Sherlock would be putting a heart inside his heart, his one and only John Watson-Holmes.
The two walked hand in hand towards the shore, enjoying the feeling of the warm sand between their toes. Yes, things were definitely going to be just fine.
He would soon find out it was easier said than done.
There were more cheers, clapping, and a few hoots before she spoke again. "Thank you ladies and gentlemen. I'm turning it over to Mr. Turing now." She sat down, and Mr. Turing, the popular chemistry teacher stood up.
"Yes, but she's very weak right now. We pumped a very large amount of Valium from her stomach. We did give her morphine for pain, and she's sleeping. We will need to admit her to the psychiatric ward for an evaluation."
Sherlock looked at the large monitor screen skeptically. "You can't be serious. You want me to try and find a partner on this site? And what's with this name, Your Turn? What do they mean by Your Turn? As in Your Turn to be suckered by romance?"
"Hello Billy." The voice was low and whispery, and was very sinister sounding.
John laughed and reached over to open the door for Sherlock, who grabbed his bad and hopped in the car. "Nice ride John," he said appreciatively.
Several minutes later, she was asleep.
******
"For now," Sherlock gently smirked.
But he'd left a bad impression on John thanks to his rude treatment towards him and dismissal of his child. He was determined to make John see Sherlock, for the first time in his life, had been wrong about someone, and that he wanted to start over again. Preferably with John standing over him, sweat glistening on his tanned, toned chest in nothing but those camouflage pants and dog tags.
The chemistry genius and the rugby player made for a sexy pair on the dance floor, with Sherlock swaying his lanky frame seductively wrapped around John, whose bump and grind got many appreciative looks from both men and women. And it was no surprise that John won first prize in the costume contest. He was definitely the hit of the night. Sherlock was proud of his boyfriend. John really didn't appreciate how gorgeous he really was.
Soon there was a knock, and Wanda opened it up. It was Hal, dressed in jeans and a short-sleeved white dress shirt. He carried a bouquet of carnations in colors of red, pink, and white. "Hi Wanda. He presented the flowers to her. "These are for you."
*****
Outside the Sherrinford Police Department, Billy Wiggins and Kitty Reilly were standing and waiting anxiously for Officer Dave Morstan and Officer James Sholto to come out and begin a news conference regarding the Sherrinford Slayer. The two were talking with each other when a KABC news van pulled up behind the KMOF van. A middle-aged man hopped out in a navy blue suit, followed by a younger man in a brown leather jacket and khakis, holding a camera. The two were setting up to tape a segment.
"Fair point," Irene said, signaling the bartender, asking for a pink lady cocktail.
John made his way to Rosie's nursery. Rosie was standing in her crib and upon seeing her daddy she raised her arms. "Up! Up!" she demanded.
"Your meal is on the house by the way. Compliments of the owner," Irene said with a grin.
Principal Saxon awakens but there's frustration as he can't remember the events which led to him being hospitalized, John visits a sick Sherlock, who begins to tell him about Sheridan, and as the town is sent reeling from the brutal murders of Art Doyle and Marty Freeman, the killer terrorizes another teenager.
John couldn't help but blush. "We are the worst," he admitted.
"Look Carl, I'm sorry about what happened to your son. No one deserves that. And we're going to do everything in our power to catch this maniac, but getting drunk and trying to hit a child isn't going to bring him back! Now get out of here. Go home and comfort your wife."
The second kiss was a bit more passionate, and soon their arms were wrapped around each other. When they came up for air, Sherlock burrowed his face in John's neck, savoring the musky scent of his cologne. "I think I'm falling in love with you," he murmured into John's skin.
Mrs. Hudson patted his hand with her wrapped one. "Thank you dear, but no, I'm not going to put all that responsibility on you. You all have school tomorrow, and you need to focus on your studies. I have enough money saved up to pay you for the week. Don't worry. The doctors say I'll be out in a couple of days if I continue to heal well. Same for Angelo."
Rosie was on the floor, the puppy lying on top of her. John and Sherlock grinned at the toddler. "Rosie approves," John said. "Now what do we name the little guy?"
John recovered, his tears drying up, and he looked up and smiled at Sherlock. "Thank you. You've made me feel a lot better."
While Sherlock was lavishing affection on him, John realized how lucky he was tonight. If Mrs. H hadn't let him and Mary go early, they may have been victims as well, injured so badly they would need to be in the hospital...or worse, dead.
A cryptic smile played on his lips. "You being in the car and talking with me isn't dull."
"Ears," his boyfriend answered matter-of-fact.
Sherlock meanwhile, was transfixed on the tanned strip of John's skin that revealed itself to him when the hem of his white shirt rode up as he stretched.
"Well then, until I'm caught, I'll continue to take more lives. You and everyone else have been warned. No one is safe...no one."
Sherlock shook his head vehemently. The last thing he wanted was a submissive omega. "Absolutely not. If I wanted any old omega I could have had one by now. But an omega who also has alpha tendencies? That's fascinating. That's perfect.
"He had a girlfriend. I'm not a homewrecker," Sherlock retorted.
"I hate you all," Sherlock pouted.
It's the day after the brutal murders of Sally Donovan and Phillip Anderson, and the town is in a panic. Sherlock visits John, who doesn't believe the murders were racially motivated. His theory is proven right when the maniac calls into Billy Wiggins' radio show, threatening more mayhem.
Sherlock's face wrinkled up in puzzlement as he gently shook the box. It was very light and it wasn't fragile, but it was something John felt he wouldn't like.
"Anything for you and John."
Sherlock quickly looked down at his sandwich. "Nothing."
He kissed John hungrily, and the blond felt himself being scooped up into Sherlock's arms, and being carried to the bedroom. John definitely had to thank his best girlfriends for this night of passion...
John held back a chuckle at the hostess' personality change as she led him to a back corner of the restaurant. Sitting at a round table next to a large window was Irene and Molly. John was glad he wasn't wearing jeans and a jumper. Both women were dressed impeccably. Irene had on a sleeveless red maxi dress with a low V-neckline, accentuated by a pearl necklace with a diamond clasp, her dark hair down this time but coiffed stylishly. Molly wore a navy blue sleeveless knee length sheath dress with a sapphire and diamond choker around her slim neck, and her hair was pulled up into a loose, but fancy bun.
The rain was steadily falling when John and his friends left the school. It had been a successful meeting, and everyone loved John's rough sketch of his poster. He'd promised to create some flyers to be hung around the school with the same drawing.
John explained all of this without eye contact, luckily for Sherlock, as the tears forming in her eyes went unseen.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is John still sleeping?”
“Oh-fucking-hell-Yes-Yes-Yes-ah!” He gasps out between thrusts as his eyes roll back.
“Oh god...” The athlete groaned, his eyes closing instantaneously.
He’s right. William really is too mundane for him.
“You don’t sound-“
The second they were through the door, John was attacking Sherlock’s lips with his own. He kissed him forcefully, desperately, and with passion, thrusting his tongue in and out of his mouth. He bit at his lips, gently clacked their teeth together and massaged his tongue over Sherlock’s. Sherlock was moaning without shame, no care to how loud he was. Items of clothing dotted the floor in a trail to their bedroom door. Sherlock was only in his briefs when John pinned him to the door with his hips, holding his lanky arms up above his head.
Sherlock threw his head back in sheer bliss, bucking his hips, and pulling at his restraints.
Sherlock’s curly head appeared from over the back of the sofa.
“Do you want me to pull out?”
We pause for a minute so she can put on her jacket.
“You climbed up the trellis...?” She said in a half query as she looked past him and out in to the dark.
He grins again, but this one is more seductive than cheeky.
“Tear it, rip it, I don’t fucking care.” Sherlock hungrily attached his lips back to johns, carving his lips with his tongue.
Sherlock returned his gaze to John, trying not to look too pleased.
He’d been shot. Shot, not killed. She’d been granted her miracle. He wasn’t dead.
Sherlock sucked his cheeks in between his teeth in a manner that rather made him look like a fish as he raised his hips again to allow John to push another pillow underneath him.
“Hold my shoulders, if you think it’ll help.”
“Thank you.” Sherlock added after a moment.
“What if they’re still doing stuff?”
“Oh Christ.” John groaned when Sherlock reached up to pull his trousers down.
“Thanks. Sorry about the mess.”
With a final chaste kiss, the pair settled down, and fell asleep.
“Sit.” Sherlock instructed, gesturing to his desk chair.
“What would you like, my darling?”
“Lucy. She doesn’t listen to anything I tell her.”
“Look at me, Sherlock.”
Mrs Holmes moved closer to her, and put an arm around her.
Colloquially put, ‘playing hard to get’ is an excellent technique.
John pressed a gentle kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
“When you’re out, we’ll be able to snuggle properly.”
“I’m glad. Those chocolate bourbons were expensive.” She teased.
Sherlock panted heavily, sheets balled in his fists, legs spasming.
“You’re welcome.”
Sherlock beamed back at him, a blush on his cheeks.
That was when he burst in to tears.
“Ok.”
Oh course he was nervous, everyone was on their first time. But it was going to be with John, and John loved him. A giddy feeling swept over him as he remembered johns confession of love to him. Obviously he was in love with john, and he had been for a long time, even before they had got together, but he had wanted to wait for john to say it first.
and there,
I feel a fluttering in my stomach, and I have to bite my lip to prevent any embarrassing noises from escaping.
“No, I did not.”
I slip my arms through the sleeves and I feel complete.
Sentiment... not something I am used to feeling, but I’m also not used to other people expressing it towards me. Perhaps that’s why I find myself whispering the same words back to him.
“Take these outside to the football grounds.”
Just as she’d grown accustomed to, she was awoken by screaming. She quietly got down from her bed, and went to meet Mrs Watson in the hall way.
No, I’m not meant to have my phone, but I get really bored on this post, and there’s only so much people watching you can do, so I snuck my phone in along with my headphones.
I don’t know what happened to the Sherlock that sat before me only a few months ago trying to figure out how to give me a handjob.
“Your trousers are still undone.” I whisper in concern.
“Yes, sweetheart, he is.” Mrs Holmes said.
John slowed his pace momentarily to add a third finger.
“I think it’s very hot.”
I reach down and fish his hair in my hands, tugging so hard it must be hurting him, but he doesn’t say.
“John, stop. You’re going to hurt yourself!” Sherlock yelled as the blond went to kick a rubbish bin.
“Can I ask a huge favour?”
“You better not mess up my sock index again.” Said the dark haired teen who was perched on his desk chair, critically watching her every move.
I take my other hand, and press a firm finger up against his right rim.
“No, no I don’t mean like those kinda details, I mean like... did you have fun?”
He offered up no words, but instead a bashful nod.
John threw his head forward as his cock spasmed, streams of hot, white fluid shooting from the end, on to the bed sheets and Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock grinned as he watched John orgasm in front of him. He’d done that. He’d been the cause of it. He’d made John feel so good.
Sherlock blew John a cheeky kiss before slipping away into the bathroom, leaving John alone with his thoughts. This was amazing; being with Sherlock was amazing. Why did he allow himself to talk himself out of his feelings, why did he deny that he liked him for so long? He’d never been so happy. Sherlock made him happy. These were some of the thoughts that ran through his head as he waited, alone in Sherlock’s room. That was when he heard keys in the door, and two voices. One was unmistakably Mycroft’s. And the other was a girl.
They walked back to the train station together, then made their way back home.
Sherlock comforts John his first night home.
Enjoy
“Thank you.”
He stills his hips completely, and reaches under me so one of his hands is on the small of my back. Then, he lifts me up so I’m straddling his lap.
My eyes fly wide as Moriarty grabs my hands and plunges the knife in to his own stomach.
From this angle, I can see the extremely present bulge in his trousers.
I feel my already hard penis throb at the thought.
Sherlock’s cheeks flushed as he did his school shirt back up.
John stepped in between sherlock’s legs, rubbing his thigh against Sherlock’s groin.
“Oh god.”
That’s what he told himself as he eventually dozed off.
We don’t need to.
John.
“I haven’t even talked to her at all today. Her sister called me. They said she was too exhausted.”
“What’s wrong?” Sherlock asked, rubbing his eyes as he leant forwards.
“I don’t want to be a mammal!”
Sherlock obliged, sauntered over to the bed, and settled in Johns lap. John put their faces together, but didn’t join their lips in a kiss. Instead, they just breathed each other’s air, the tension between them skyrocketing.
Sherlock age 5
Sherlock peered over in to the bag at the purchased garments. There was a gag, a bottle of lube, he was already wearing the kitten ears, and then there was a lime green vibrator.
“John.” She said somewhat firmly, her eyes searching his.
The Holmes and Watsons spend Christmas together.
His back hurt, his legs hurt, his rim hurt, even his neck hurt.
“Mrs Watson looks a little worse for wear doesn’t she?”
“Yes, now fuck me like I’m your bitch.” He chuckles, turning his head to grin at me.
(See the end of the chapter for
He seems intrigued as he crosses his legs in a manner that makes him resemble a small child, eager to learn.
“Thank you.”
He let out a low whine when he felt the tails lightly graze the skin between his shoulder blades. He shivered as John dragged the cat down his back, already so sensitive from the ice cubes, his nerves tingling, his cock throbbing painfully where it stood unattended between his legs.
“We have made quite the mess though, haven’t we...?”
“Listen, about last night.” John said after a moment.
“Ok, there, there it’s done. It’s ok, it’s ok.”
Sherlock’s mellifluous voice went straight to johns cock which was already rock hard, and straining against his boxers. He smirked to himself, then leant in towards Sherlock’s ear.
Sherlock turned to look John, his eyes questioning.
“Hello, Sherlock.”
“Yes... That is what I mean.”
His shoulders move back a little when I press the stethoscope to his chest. He’s toned, but not exactly muscular, with long arms and legs, giving him an overall, wiry figure.
The evening shift always seems to drag on, but that’s only emphasised by the fact that I’ve hidden my junkie, detoxing boyfriend in a storage room.
“No, I took a gap year to do some research projects. Where did you go?”
Just some ideas. I love knowing what readers would enjoy, so just let me know :)
He drew his lower lip in between his teeth to smirk at John.
“That’s not important. What is, however, is what you have to do with him.”
She found her hands going to the locket around her neck. She had been all alone in the world, and John had found her. She had sent a letter to him two weeks ago, along with a picture of Lucy, asking whether he knew the words to the song she’d been singing, but explaining a tune to somebody via a letter was rather difficult.
After I get over my initial surprise, I wrap my arms around his neck and tilt my pelvis forwards so our groins are pressed right together.
“I didn’t want to presume, but umm...” he explains. “I didn’t want to be unprepared if... you know?”
“Sorry.”
“I’ll ask Dr Hooper to keep an eye on you, but other than that, I think you’ll be ok.”
“Oh, that’s not nothing.”
In my dazed state, I manage to catch a glimpse of another guard running over and hauling Moriarty away, kicking and screaming
“Ready?”
“Hang on, let me try something. Can you get your legs over my shoulders?”
“I have to fuck you from behind.”
Good lord, I hope she didn’t ask me anything that I should have had a different response to.
I keep glancing up at him, locking eyes with him, his deep, stormy orbs.
Sherlock had never seen John cry before. She still remembered the first time John had seen her cry. She’d fallen off a chair whilst trying to reach a box of checkers, and he’d kissed her knee to make her better. John was hurting on the inside. She wasn’t sure how to make that better, but she went with the first thing that popped into her head. She leaned in, and captured johns lips in a kiss. His lips were warm, and soft, and tasted ever so slightly of ginger. It was only for a second before she pulled back. John was staring at her with hooded eyes. He didn’t say anything. He simply moved his arms in order to allow Sherlock to lie on his chest, where he stroked her hair till she fell asleep.
The start of the year was a few hours away. The Watsons and the Holmes, among with a few friends, had decided to have a dinner party. The youngest two attendants had no idea the start of the year would not be the same as the end. Mycroft and Harriet were swapping university stories, and John and Sherlock were up in the latter’s room discussing their plans and goals for the New Years.
“-simply doesn’t listen to anything I say... and neither do you. Sherlock!”
The intensity of his words, the depth of his voice as he spoke them, the consequences entailed if I didn’t follow them... I’m sure he wouldn’t tell me off, but what if he did?
“What did you do?”
“This ok?”
I need more.
“I’ve been assigned to the bubble tomorrow night. Come see me?”
I slam in to him as hard as I can, the sound of Sherlock’s groans and our skin slapping together fills the space.
“Did he ask you to ‘keep an eye on me’?”
The athlete pulled back to admire his handwork. Sherlock’s neck was dotted with hickeys, flushed with blood, lips glistening with saliva, eyes dark with arousal. His cock throbbed from where it was still sheathed in his trousers, painfully hard. Sherlock snapped him from his daze when he sat up, and grabbed a fistful of his shirt, pulling him back to him.
Sherlock was aware that whilst she could offload the child’s emotional needs on to other people, feeding it was a task that she alone had to carry out.
“There’s some in the bathroom. Mrs Hudson always has some on hand in case I get sunburnt. It happens more often than I’d like to admit.”
Connections sparked in her head as she added up her symptoms.
Like John, he had been drafted at 16.
John tentatively wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s midsection, and allowed him to lean his weight on him.
“Yes! Yes! Yes! Agh, oh god! Yes!” Sherlock screamed, and threw his head back.
“You’re sorry about the kiss, or what happened after?”
Unlike last time, I can actually feel my fingers.
“I love you. So, so much.”
“I’m in here babe, give me a second.” John called from the bathroom.
“John I’ll be fine.”
I did not proof read this... 😆
‘Everyone else really is completely oblivious...’
Sorry this is short. Hope you enjoy!
I don’t know exactly why he wants to see me, but I know I want to see him.
The slighter teen shivered and arched his back at the touch. John leant in to capture his lips in a kiss. He opened his mouth, opening Sherlock’s with it, and slipped his tongue past his lips. Sherlock moaned appreciatively, and moved his tongue to role over John’s. Johns tongue was warm and wet as it explored his mouth, the faint taste of blueberry evident. He groaned when John drew his bottom lip between his teeth, lightly tugging. John pulled back to kiss all down Sherlock’s neck, mouthing, sucking, biting.
“Jesus, Mycroft you make me sound like an escort.”
“And to hell with what happens to us.”
“Come with me. We can’t be seen talking out here.”
John pressed his lips to Sherlock’s in a gentle, tentative kiss.
“Fine, Thank you Mrs Holmes. Just ummm... ahem... went down the wrong way.”
He pressed their lips back together before bringing his hands up to cup her breasts.
“Oh yeah?” John drawled, running his hands down Sherlock’s spinal column and coming to rest on his hips.
“What are you...?” He trails off as I pull his prison issued trousers down to his ankles.
John.
I grab a book from my locker and flop down on my bed.
"Really?" Sherlock questioned, his lip curling in a smile.
“Do you even need to ask me, John?”
“We should probably get out there before somebody sober comes looking for us.” John sighed.
John grinned as he watched the brunette squirm under his touch, his eyes closing, his hands gripping the bed sheets. Sherlock was turned on to the point of painful, his cock throbbing between his legs. John kissed all the way down to his pubic bone, pausing to suck the skin in to his mouth.
John furrowed his brows. It was in that moment that he realised how alien the concept of having friends was to Sherlock. He’d never had anyone in his life who valued his opinions. John felt sadness creeping up on him as he looked at the younger teen.
“Sure.”
“Where have you guys been?!” Molly exclaimed.
FLASHBACK
He’s been quiet for a while. I would have almost forgotten that he was here if it wasn’t for the gentle grazing of his calloused fingertips across my knuckles.
John grinned, and shook his head, signalling for Sherlock to shush.
“Yes, yes please.”
I smile in to the kiss at this and wrap my arms around his neck.
All of a sudden, a buzzing starts and an intense wave of pleasure strong enough to  force a noise out of my throat hits me.
Hope you are well. How is tour family?
“You alright there?”
“And I You.”
“Mmmm?” He murmurs as he moves to place his lips on my neck.
“Yeah, well...” Mike drawls. “Now stop hogging the tub. Hand it over.”
John couldn’t wait any longer. He cleared his throat, making Sherlock jump. His eyes flew wide, and his whole body tensed.
“Yes. Please.” He moans with a roll of his hips.
“You can fill in the blanks.”
“Too smart for your own good.” I believe was the expression he used. “You need to stop running your mouth, and start running away from the thugs that are beating you up.”
Sherlock brought his hands to his chest, and with long, nibble fingers, he began to undo the buttons of his school shirt. John had caught a brief glimpse of Sherlock without his shirt before, but this was different somehow. He seemed exposed, not just of his shirt, but of something else too. The brunette watched John intently as he examined his chest, gently touching his pale skin, asking where it hurt. He couldn't help but wonder what the broader boy looked like sans his shirt. He found himself staring at johns still clothed body with lust filled eyes. When he looked back up, John's face was right by his own. He tried to control himself, taking deep breaths. Thankful, John pulled away, and sat back.
Sherlock was familiar with the mousey looking young woman from her appointments at the clinic in town.
“You’re a good man, Jimmy.”
Sherlock beamed up at him.
“Just some boys from school.”
“Yes.”
The front door was locked.
“Oh, don’t you two look lovely.”
“I do indeed.”
“Maybe.” Sherlock blushed.
I haven’t seen her since I was six.
I find myself getting light headed, a common occurrence nowadays.
John immediately pulled Sherlock in to his arms and held him close to his chest, kissing his cheeks and whispering words of love in his ear.
“You sure?”
“John...” Sherlock moaned, rolling his neck.
“Spread your legs.” I rasp by his ear, running my tongue over the shell.
John paused to see if Sherlock would do as he was told, then went back to pinching the little buds, and rolling them around between his fingers.
“You want to?”
“Oh god... sorry... are you ok?”
“You think you could... do this on purpose next time?”
“Use your hand, yeah?”
Everyone enjoying still? Let me know if anyone has suggestions. Thanks :)
“Ok. I... need to get your hips up. Here, hand me that pillow.”
Sherlock turned to see Mycroft lent up against his doorframe. He was basically a cat, always sauntering around, and inviting himself in places.
Why am I finding this so difficult to say? Maybe it’s because I know how inexperienced he is. I can’t just flat out say ‘hey babe, wanna smash?’ It has to be more tactful than that.
She may be annoying and way to talkative, but she cane forward and put herself at risk for my sake.
“I that am lost... mmmmm.” She hummed as she walked around the garden.
John reclaimed his hoodie, and slipped it on over his head.
I pull my sleeve down over my track marks. They’re fading nicely.
For starters, she wasn’t allowed to go to the station. John himself had forbidden it after tales of last time had been whispered to him over Sunday lunch.
Moly smiles sadly.
“Shut up Molly.”
“Rugby practice.”
He didn’t mind her too much. She was smart, kind, and probably the closest thing he had to a friend. She had a good number of friends herself who were clearly more tolerable of her bad jokes than he was. They were testing substances with iodine, which was rather dull, which left plenty of brain power for chatting. Oh goody(!)
John buried his head in Sherlock’s hair, breathing in his lemon shampoo.
Well, emotions tied to other people; those have never been my thing.
After a lot of fumbling, cursing, and giggling in Sherlock’s case, he managed to free her from the fabric cage.
“Sherlock?” She heard him call from behind her.
Sherlock rolled his neck from side to side, moans of pleasure escaping him. There was still a weird sensation of being ‘invaded’ but the buzz shooting up his spine was enjoyable to say the least. He began bucking his hips up in time with John’s thrusts, arching off the pillow.
“Ok.” Sherlock nodded enthusiastically. He definitely wanted to pleasure John, but a blow job was probably starting in the deep end. Sherlock climbed back on to the bed, and knelt down beside John.
He could feel Sherlock’s legs shaking.
“Quite pretty too.”
I can’t imagine how painstakingly slow this must have been for him.
Mr Watson came through the door a few moments later. He said a brief hello to Sherlock, then turned his attention to his son. With the help of his father, John managed to limp over to the other sofa. While she watched him moving, Sherlock noticed something odd about johns injury, but she couldn’t put her finger on it.
An empty bed. An empty coffin. An empty promise that he was coming home. Charlie Clark’s body hadn’t been found. No more car games, no more snoring. John never thought he’d miss the snoring, but it was painfully quiet now without him. Charlie wasn’t the first soldier to be lost, and he wouldn’t be the last. John had lost friend after friend. He didn’t think he could bare to see another one die. As he sat on his bunk, something Mycroft had said to him years ago came to mind.
“What time is Gavin getting here?”
It was in this moment that Sherlock was truly great full that other people weren’t like him. If John had been like him, he would have noticed his tears, and asked him why he was crying. He could hardly say he was crying about geography homework. He’d have to lie.
“I’ll get some make up, Rosie, get some outfits, Molly, put on a killer playlist. Let’s drag him up
“That was... the most... amazing orgasm... ever.”
“I see- taste- those pumpkin spiced lattes are back.” He grinned, licking his lips.
John age: 18
“You died fighting for your king and country. That’s an honour.”
Sherlock pulled himself up slowly so he was perched on Johns knee, then nodded his head.
Finally, an update! Life's been a little crazy but this weekend allowed me to do some work on my two WIP's. It's a short chapter, next one will be a little longer.
And it was on one of those pulls where he met the love of his life.
I nearly fell onto the floor. "You finally got my name right! After all this time! We're going to have a blizzard."
John still was unimpressed, but figured if it was cool with Greg, it was cool with him. Plus, Greg had hired two of John's Army mates, Bill Murray and James Sholto, as bouncers. Both had been unemployed and struggling to make it and jumped at the chance to get some steady work. Greg had promised to keep them on after Discopath was eventually captured.
"Yeah, sounds good. Harry's been craving a root beer float," John said, chuckling.
“These deductions of yours are really freaky. Brilliant, but freaky.” John picked the up the hose and unhooked it from the faucet attached to the side of the house. Sherlock followed him, multicolored eyes focused on his backside. He nearly reached out with a long pale hand to touch when John turned around. “Look, I need to get a shower and a nap before I go to work. I think it’s time you hightail it out of here, especially before my mom gets home. She doesn’t care if I have a boy in the house, but she’s not partial to greasers.”
"Rosie's going to Paris next spring with her girlfriend. She's so excited. Unfortunately we never had the funds to do a lot of traveling unless it was in the London area," John said.
Sherlock was grateful for the heavy rain that fell from the London sky this Halloween. But it's not like he and John could have taken Rosie trick-or-treating anyway. Due to a spike in Covid cases, going door to door was strongly discouraged by the NHS. The usual big public celebrations were also canceled, along with them the Yard's annual costume bash. Even if Halloween was to be celebrated as usual, little Rosie still couldn't have gone.
perfect.  The name's Sherlock Holmes. I have a tendency not to talk for hours, I play my violin at all hours of the day and night, and I'm prone to shoot walls when I'm bored. Want to bond? And dance too? I love dancing, always have."
Sherlock and John were late in getting their flu shots. In their defense, the fears of Covid had led to more people in general getting their flu vaccinations which led to a shortage. John had retired from the clinic before summer so since he was no longer a working doctor he wasn't eligible for the free shots his former employer provided for staff. With he and his husband busy with cases for the Yard and Mycroft, caring for Rosie, and life in general, the two had been jabbed a week before Christmas. Since the vaccine needs to be in the body for two weeks for it to be effective, the boys weren't surprised that they got sick.
The bartender approached Sherlock who waved him off. The detective turned to John. "Afghanistan or Iraq?"
Molly, Mike and Angelo were outside behind Mrs. Hudson. “They started it,” Molly accused Sherlock and Mycroft. “They’re the ones we told you about, the creeps who’ve been stalking us this weekend!”
John returned home from a successful morning of fishing. It had started to rain, and John went to the kitchen to begin cleaning and gutting the perch so he could refrigerate them for dinner later. John found preparing the fish relaxing. Most people would balk at the activity, but after years of stitching up and treating combat wounds, scaling and gutting fish was like child's play.
Sherlock frowned. "What do you mean by that? Oh wait---you think I'd bite you. I assure you I won't. I also know you can't be enthralled. I wouldn't even try that anyway. You're much too interesting to be a mindless slave."
*****
The siblings exchanged nervous glances. "Well, this is make or break time," Theo said.
John couldn't help but gape at his genius. "Christ Sherlock, and you think I'm a god. You look like you came straight out of a Greek fable. You're absolutely gorgeous. I still can't believe you chose me when you could have your pick of any man in London."
"Me too. I like it." Marty took a gulp of beer. "Pass that joint over."
Wanda nearly dropped the phone in shock. "What? They survived?"
*****
John told Sherlock to meet him at the coffee shop at six-thirty. It was at the end of Baker street, a well-worn establishment that became a favorite hangout for John, a getaway to escape the pressures of his divorce. Sherlock had only been in it a handful of times but enjoyed the low-key atmosphere.
"I really don't care Mikey boy," Jim replied dismissively. "Get used to my face, you're going to be seeing a lot of it. Ta-ta for now!" he sung, opening the door and leaving.
John raised his hands and shook them. "No way. Sherlock would think this is ridiculous. Not to mention, he'd be critiquing the technical aspects of the pictures so much, he'd get no enjoyment from them."
"Richard Wilkes...Christ, this is crazy...he's such a prominent member of the town," Fred said. "Why him?"
“Not sure yet. I’ll need his phone number so I can set the appointment,” John responded.
Sherlock broke the kiss and gazed dreamily at John. "John," he breathed.
, was written while I was in recovery. When I first enlisted in the Army and was doing basic training, there was a nurse on base who nearly all of the recruits were gaga over. These guys kept going on and on about how beautiful she was. One day, I came down with a pretty nasty sinus infection. I was sent to see the nurse. Well, I took one look at her and got really freaked out. She was gorgeous, but there was something about her eyes. To me, it looked like there was no soul, no feeling in them. She spoke in a very sultry, almost seductive voice, and her lips were blood red. After my visit with her, my bunkmates asked what I thought of her, and I told them she was weird, and I actually got scared while being alone with her. I actually called her a succubus."
"My sister's here too, so that makes us even." Sherlock smiled at John.
The DJ was playing "Closing Time" by Semisonic, a signal that the wonderful day was winding down. It had also started to rain, and everyone was grateful the weather held off until it was time to go home. It had been a fun reception, with Sherlock and John delivering humorous yet touching best men speeches about their favorite couple, a delicious buffet dinner of fish, chips, salad, bread, and a fruit bowl. Instead of a fancy tiered cake, Greg and Molly had opted for a white sheet cake with a small round cake in the center, decorated in yellow roses with whimsical cake toppers of two cute ginger cats dressed as a bride and groom on the top of the small tier.
"The neighbor reported hearing a gunshot in the home. He had his wife call police, and he went over to see what happened. He saw a young man lying in the living room, bleeding profusely."
"I'm sure everyone here has read all your books, am I right?" Mike spoke up.
*****
"Sherlock," Jim called out. "You're staring like a schoolboy in lust."
John wasn't a hermit. He gave up his car for a bike and would bike into town to run errands, do his shopping, have meals in the pubs with his friends, or spend time people watching at Regent's Park. John was still fit and the bike riding kept him active and healthy. He loved feeling the sunshine and breezes on his body as he rode, and enjoyed saying hello to people on their porches. Retirement was definitely the best thing he'd done, besides marry Mary and have Rosie.
Sherlock picked up John from his flat. The taller boy couldn't help but cast an appreciative glance at John, clad in a maroon St. Bart's hoodie, dark jeans, and white trainers, his blond hair under a black beanie. Tiny strands of golden locks stuck out under the wool, and Sherlock thought he looked gorgeous. At the same time, John admired Sherlock's lean frame in a black wool peacoat, blue cashmere scarf, and black jeans. Sherlock wore a dark purple beanie that matched the shirt John suggested he get at the store. John had dubbed it "the purple shirt of sex," to Sherlock's amusement.
