"Thank you very much," she said, lips curving into a flirty grin before she walked away. Sam rolled his eyes at Dean, pointedly glancing at Cas and then back to his brother.
It was things like that that made Dean pause whatever he was doing. Whenever Cas said something that made Dean think that maybe Cas had some kind of feelings toward him (aside from the obvious), it was a surprise. Yeah, Cas could be very direct with his words, so it was possible.
"We could have this if you just have a little hope," Cas said, sighing contentedly. "It's going to be worth the wait, Dean."
"Aha!" Dean truimphantly held out a faded T-shirt and sweatpants. "Change." He pushed the clothes into the angel's hands.
The food he handed to Dean smelled absolutely awesome. It was a cheeseburger, loaded with bacon and every other topping imaginable. "Mmm. Freaking amazing, Sammy."
Both of them were shocked. Dean downed about half of his third beer, as if adding more alcohol to the equation would make the situation better.
Cas didn't need to be told twice. He just closed the distance between them completely. The first press of their lips was indescribable-- the perfect action that conveyed Cas's hesitation, his eagerness to kiss Dean that he'd ignored for so long already, and their feelings for each other.
We slow dance to Elvis, his breath tickling my ear as he sings softly. I bite my lip and sigh, relaxing fully into his arms, letting his words wask over me, and when the song ends I pull him in for a kiss.
I rush to his side and comfort him, something that we've both become rather good at. I've never seen him this bad before, though, he was throwing up from fear. He falls into my arms and I hug him, gently rocking back and forth while stroking his hair. He continues to cry and I put his arm around my shoulders before walking him to bed again.
I nod my head and then shake it, I have told her but I never talked about it. Every time I did I had a panic attack and so did Cas, so I avoided mentioning that day. Bobby just sighs.
"Come on, Dean, was it really just a stress build up or something more? Family don't end with blood boy, you're like my son and I care about ya, so tell me what happened."
"These boys wanted Dean and you on the team, the team is their lives. So when you left the team for each other, well they didn't take it well. They hope that this treatment can change your minds." I yell profanity's at him through the gag and continue sobbing from the pain. I jerk forward and the feel of a broken rib pressing against my skin makes me hunch my shoulders.
"I'm going to clean this, then you're turning around and I'm cleaning whatever's on your back. Then we are talking to my father, whether you like it or not." He grips my wrists at that.
"Will you do me the honour of being my boyfriend?" I squeal (a very, manly squeal) and jump into his arms.
"Ahhh, Castiel. The little angel, so sweet, so pure, how's the anxiety? Is it kicking in yet? Can you feel it crawl up your throat?" I shift uncomfortably in my seat but shoot him a look of boredom in the hopes he didn't realise that my anxiety was kicking in.
"Hey sweetie, my names Ellen, I heard you're lookin' for work?" I nod politely and offer my hand, she shakes it firmly and begins a quick interview. I keep my mask up and try to be as convincing as I can, I really need this job.
Whatever happened last night obviously shook him badly and now he was reserved. I concentrate and focus on his soul, squinting a little at the white light emanating from it, but the emotions it was portraying were fear, sadness, happiness and pride.
I take a few steps forward and spin around to face whoever's in the doorway. My dad makes his way over to Dean, who was shuffling his feet in the carpet and staring at the floor. I tip toe to where my father was sitting at watch the scene unfold between my dad and Dean.
The football team silently take us to the locker rooms, making sure no one sees us. They drag us inside and throw us onto the floor, quickly tieing our hands up, I shuffle over to Cas and make sure he's okay. He sobs as large hands grab me and force me against a wall.
"He just hit me, that's how he did it." I rub my face with my hands and sigh. My stomach dropping even more when he shifts and tries to hide his grimace. Frowning I reach out and lightly touch the side of his torso, he jerks backward and hisses in pain, but I'm too busy staring at my hand, which had a smear of blood on it.
"Alright boy, the easiest problem first. Sammy's crush. Talk to me." I smile at him and he chuckles.
I pull into Cas' driveway to see him wearing his favourite black pants and tan trench coat. He grins when I pull in and then races into the car, instantly weaving his hand into mine.
Eventually he spoke again, as if he felt like he was being rude to a dinner guest by not engaging in friendly conversation. “The more I think about it, I’m actually quite glad that the demon I sent to kill you was unsuccessful. I hadn’t thought about torture before, but, you know, when an opportunity comes calling… I have been looking forward to this for nearly seventy years, after all, so I figured, why
Here’s the thing about dream walking: not only do you see what the dreamer sees, but you can also tune in to what the dreamer is feeling, and Castiel was hit with a feeling of dread and doom so fierce that it brought him to his knees. It was the feeling of knowing you’re about to die. Dean knew that he and Sam were about to be killed by this morphing monster and that there was no way to stop it. The demon reached for Sam’s neck with a blurry arm, but then everything slowed down and the scene in the street became nothing but background noise as Dean called out, “Cas! Help us!”
At least, if Cas died after this, he would die knowing that Dean didn’t have to live through the pain of losing his brother.
“Now it’s time for you to get some clarity, Castiel. Time for you to fully appreciate the gravity of the situation you have found yourself in. You asked what happened to me and why I am doing this. Well, time to show you.”
"I'll watch Dean. Promise." With that Sam nods and exits the room, limping slightly. I tense up as my dad moves and close my eyes before turning and facing him. A slowly inch my eyes open and see him standing there, open mouthed and slightly pale.
I shake off the epiphany and instead rush him to the car and slip into the driver's seat, I look back and see Sam has Deans head in his lap and is crying softly. He strokes Deans forehead and murmurs words to him quietly while I drive to their house.
I blink my eyes open and try to focus on the layer of pain, hoping it would wake me up. I squeeze my eyes shut and hear cruel laughter and a person's sobs. not just anyone's sobs, Deans.
I try to shake the ever growing feeling of hopelessness and heave myself off my bed, rubbing my face dejectedly. I sigh again and stretch, wincing a bit at the ache near my ribs. I would have to be careful at tryouts today. I weave my way around the junk littering our motel room and manage to reach the kitchen, which is the only clean thing about this place. I insisted upon a fully functional kitchen wherever we stayed so I could cook for Sammy and keep him healthy, even if I had to go without.
After driving to their house Sam got out the first aid kit and started to patch himself up. I tutted and grabbed the materials out of his hands.
"I'll never lie to you, Dean." At this, he covers his eyes and turns away, Sam frowns and touches Dean's shoulder lightly.
Crowley sneers and lunges at me, knocking me right on the jaw, I stumble back and he lunges again, but this time I pull my hand back and punch him straight in the nose, knocking him to the ground. The rest of the team growls and races towards me. I throw punches and hit a few people but they keep coming, my adrenaline wears off and my head swoons, sending me stumbling.
The butterflies take flight once again and look towards the door, freezing when I see my dad. He walks over and reaches for my face, but I flinch away, careful not to wake anyone. I frantically look for Chuck but he's nowhere to be found.
"When he was drunk he almost had zero tolerance or patience, so as a kid I had to learn very quickly and if I didn't..." I trail off and bite my lip.
"Only ONE TRUE PAIRING! It means you guys are super cute and we think you should definitely stay as a couple." Charlie starts skipping backwards while grinning at us. Dean just chuckles and we walk into class with her.
I knew Dean would want me to watch Sam, so that's what I did. Until another crack follows and I watch his eyes screw up in pain and he tries to make himself smaller, at that I begin to stride over to Alistair who is currently whispering something in Deans' ear and staring directly at me.
"Well, Dean, let's have dinner shall we?" I nod slowly and we both snuggle into the mattress, turning the radio onto an old station. We eat dinner and laugh together, the fairy lights becoming brighter as the sun went down and my smile becoming bigger the later the time got.
"Good evening Mr. Novak, my name is Meg Masters and I'm your nurse. Can you open your eyes for me?" I take a shaky breath and open my eyes slowly to the blinding light.
It all started innocently enough. On a case, he, Sam, and Cas were asking a witness questions and her gaze kept drifting over to the angel. Thankfully, Cas was socially inept to the point where he didn't notice her lingering looks or the smile that formed on her face as she looked his body up and down. Dean had pulled Cas away as quickly as possible, leaving Sam to finish the interview.
"So what, we have a chick flick moment and live happily ever after?" Dean asked, only partly joking.
"I never said anything," Sam defended himself, his face the perfect picture of innocence. Dean rolled his eyes.
"Nothing! I swear. He said he valued our friendship or something." Dean took another bite out of his burger.
"You can't prove it, can you? Shut up," Dean said without any kind of challenge or heat behind his words. "Things change." He stood up, ready to leave and get a beer or two, but Cas wasn't done with him yet. All it took was a hesitant touch on his arm to keep Dean in place.
Dean crossed his arms. "If we win, and that's a big freaking if, where the hell does that even leave you, Cas?"
Cas was, as Dean suspected, in the hunter's room. "Hey," Dean began, not sure how to say what he was thinking.
Dean nodded that he was ready and paying total attention, which wasn't a total lie at least. "I'm ready, Cas. Talk to me."
"You don't get it, do you? Cas, I'm worried you'll leave any day now, and I won't be able to do crap to stop it. I'm scared that Sammy and the kid are just gonna show up dead and we'll be too damn late to stop it." He paused for a moment and added, "I have too much to lose, and it's all ending real freaking soon." He shook his head. "I'm not about to ask for a fairytale ending or anything, because I'm sure as hell not getting one now."
"I highly doubt that will happen, Dean. You should know by now that my Father isn't about to do anything like that." Cas's eyes, almost as dark as the sky, softened and he reached out for Dean's shoulder, squeezing it reassuringly.
"Talk to him, Dean. Be honest, and leave my name out of it. Do NOT use the word 'brother.'" Sam chuckled at Dean's cluelessness.
"Know what?" Dean eventually said. "Get closer to me. Don't worry about personal space." And Cas did just what he was told, no questions asked. The angel's new position placed him almost against Dean's body.
"What's wrong with it? I always dress like this." Cas looked down at himself, then back at Dean, who was heading for his dresser.
"I vastly prefer it over the doubt and resignation you currently feel. At least I'm holding out hope still." Cas frowned. He stepped closer to Dean.
And now, he was stuck rereading the same few sentences in a lore book because it had happened yet again. Dean had insisted on checking out the bar in the town their current case was in and Cas joined him. The bartender, a guy with golden-brown eyes and black hair, had actually attempted to flirt with Cas.
If he and Cas weren't in his room, Dean would have been better at paying attention, but now he was badass and in total control of their situation, and the fact that he'd partly undressed wasn't helping things, even if it was just a coat. Then there was his hair, which still looked ridiculously good while being a bit messy. The look in his eyes was intense, and damn...
He looks back up at me through his eyelashes and laughs. That's it. If he isn't gonna the first move then I will.
I move my head back to position and nod at Sammy, who slips out of the room. whenever dad's drunk he has a shorter temper and is easy to infuriate.
"Did you just wake up Cas?" I ask, my voice frail and hoarse, smooth Winchester, very attractive. He nods and his angry pout disappears. He shakes his head and begins talking.
"I feel like the one thing I had control over in my life, has been taken and I don't know what to do. I feel lost and scared and I don't want Cas to feel the same." I notice the tears forming in Dean's eyes and I quickly interrupt.
"Good morning, Dean. Breakfast will be ready in about 10 minutes, Castiel is currently showering and Sams in his room. Get cleaned up after Castiel and then I'll bring you some breakfast okay?" He shuffles the newspaper before turning down to read it again.
"Normally, we would leave people like you after about a week, so it's unusual to keep at it for a month. No, hm, we, hmm, it's a combination of the things you've done. Cassie, you've hurt a lot of people at your old school, and Dean. Dean, Dean, Dean, you've done a lot of bad. You need to pay." He laughs and the rest of the football team follows.
"Can you bring some pain medication and lots of food to the Red Motel down the road? Room 221B?" Maybe my dad could help the brothers.
So that's what I do tonight. Curl into a ball on my bed, and cry to myself. Because I can't let Sammy know, I can't let anyone know, this is my problem.
"I-I suppose Christmas when I was eleven. Normally he wouldn't be sober or home but this Christmas he was. I remember waking up and seeing two full sacks at the foot of our beds and seeing Sammy's grin as he hugged me and smiled. He thanked me for not letting him give up on Santa when really it was mostly me finding stuff to give him.
"I'm going to become a surgeon, that's what I've always wanted to be," Cas says with a smile, I hug him tighter and smile when he kisses my nose.
I yank Dean down to the ground with me and make sure were sitting directly opposite each other. Sitting cross-legged, our knees touch and I gently push his chin up. I raise an eyebrow and he sighs.
"Need a ride Cas?" I roll my eyes at him and open the back door, sliding into the warm interior. Dean smiles and begins driving to school, but something's off about him today. I observe him closely, his usual worn jeans, work boots and a tight black shirt with...no jacket over it. I frown at him, Dean was always cold. I'd noticed that whenever I touched him or anything he always felt cold. But today was freezing outside, so why isn't he wearing a jacket?
"They raped him, dad." At this dad stands up abruptly and growls, punching the wall nearest to him. He runs his hands through his hair and when he faces us again, I see the tears in his eyes.
"Okay Mr Winchester, we have some questions for you. Do you have sufficient fund to manage you and your brother? Do you have current work? Are you going to finish school? We have talked to child services and dug a little into your past, can you confirm or deny allegations against your father?"
"You can come in Sammy, it's okay." He shuffles in shyly with a bag wrapped in a towel, I frown at him as he walks over and softly asks me to take off my shirt. I smile warmly at him, he bought my a makeshift ice pack. I'm so lucky to have such a compassionate brother, he's gonna end up doing something great with his life.
I didn't want to use my college fund because I wanted to save them for, well, college. Cas stands up and wraps me in a hug, kissing my cheek lightly. Chuck stands up and shoo's everyone out, claiming we needed to sleep for tomorrow.
He briefly glances at me and then continues to stare at Dean. I sigh and run my hands through my hair, trying to look anywhere other than Dean. I hear a sharp knock at the door and sag in relief, I race towards the door and yank it open.
I observe his face to get my ability under control, brown hair that hung around his ears and big brown puppy eyes, the colour of coffee beans.
We wander out of class to lunch and I notice that, once again, Dean doesn't have lunch. I grip his arm tightly, ignoring his wince of pain and drag him to a quiet spot underneath a willow tree. The grass is soft and the light green leaves wave in front of our faces, shielding us from everyone else. We could still observe the people outside but they wouldn't disturb us.
"Never, good man!" He then laughs and leans down to tickle me again. I end up yelling for him to stop as I profusely apologise. He stops tickling me and I groan at the aftermath of so much laughter.
"I followed you around tonight Dean and then fell asleep about two hours ago when you first got here. Why didn't you tell me why this was why you've been so tired all the time! You can trust me, Dean that's what best friends do!" His voice had risen to a loud whisper and suddenly he slumps in his chair, blinking furiously. He sniffles and I realize he's crying, he shouldn't cry.
Deans car turns left, the shiny paint reflecting the afternoon sun. My car follows and I notice the street is worse at this end. The curb is scuffed and covered in dirt, the air smells like cigarettes and the motels were falling apart at the seams, why was Dean pulling in here?
I start to piece together today's personality and wander over to my car, running a hand along the body. Damn I loved this car, my baby, the beautiful '67 Chevy Impala, the one I'd built from scratch. I slide into the driver's seat and glance around, the clouds are starting to gather in a grey heap and the people moving into the mansion down the road are freaking out. I snort at their frantic movements and start the engine. Listen to her purr! I
Cas' breathing evens and I finally look up to the other figure in the room, for a second fear stopped my heart as the sunlight hid the man's features. Then it cleared and I recognised Chuck, Cas' dad. I cleared my throat awkwardly and tried to ignore the look of pure confusion on his face, in all honesty, I didn't know what happened just then either.
When my next breath releases it shudders and my eyes widen in shock before a sob escapes my throat. I slap my hands over my mouth in surprise when another sob breaks through and tears stream down my face. I'd never had anyone other than Sam care about me, and Sam had stopped crying when I was hurt long ago.
Snap out of it Dean, you know what Dad would say! I grin at him and casually salute the principal. The idiotic jock role came too easily, I blame it on emotional constipation as Sammy would call it. She rolls her eyes and stands up, walking us out of the office. I automatically scan everything as we approach it and assess whether it's going to kill us or not. It's a habit I had to pick up after a few bad experiences and a lot of Dads persuasion. I feel a nudge at my ribs and winced, looking down at Sam's wide eyes.
Cas sits up and rolls off me, walking over to my dad with a conflicted expression on his face. He walks right up to my dad before hugging him, causing my dad to freeze and carefully hug him back. Then Cas pulls away and slaps my dad across the face, a glare set on his face. Chuck, Sam and I call his name out at the same time and I move to get out of bed, wincing as I walk over to him.
An old Elvis song comes on and I stand up, offering my shaking hand to Cas. He stands next to me and I rub the back of my neck.
"Good! Alright, can you flex your toes and move up your body?" I do as she instructs and wince when my chest tightens in pain. I study my room as I move various parts of my body, white walls with photos of nature, seas and forests, mountains and sunsets. The bedsheets are scratchy and plain white, with a pale blue trim, the equipment is all silver.
My heart constricts in my chest as the beginnings of an idea form, maybe they were poor, that would explain the numerous jobs, the absence of necessary items and their motel. I frown to myself and wonder about the life of Sam and Dean Winchester on the way to school but one question keeps circling around in my head.
"Morning Cas. You ready for today?" Dean asks gently, I close my eyes and groan again, shoving the container full of pancakes at him.
"Kevin, buddy, breathe. In and out, you'll do fine on the exam, don't worry." Dean assures Kevin and helps him calm down, holding my hand the whole time. Kevin calms down and smiles at Dean.
"Are you a virgin?" Dean chokes on his drink and begins laughing hysterically, I join in not long after and he tries to answer through fits of laughter.
"Yeah, yeah. I know, it's stupid but come on! How does being up high not scare you?" I just shake my head and wipe the tears from my eyes.
"Who, what, when, where, why and how. Go" I whisper harshly at him, scared that more than a whisper and he'd close himself off. His brows furrow together and he looks confused.
I watch Cas walk off with an open mouth and wide eyes. I slowly swivel back to Sammy and see that he's biting his lip and staring intently at the ground, I slip Cas' number into my pocket and instead make my way over to my little brother.
As black dots sweep across my vision, I try to keep my eyes open but fail miserably, falling into a deep sleep.
I notice his light smile and I grin waving a hand in front of his face, causing him to snap his eyes to my face quickly. He relaxes and then offers a small smile at me.
"We understand your father has given you legal possession of your brother, Samuel Winchester." I nod and hand the man the papers that I had signed. The man glances at the paper and nods slowly.
Azazel and Alistair let me drop forward and I curl into a ball on the bench, in too much pain to go to Dean. Then Abbadon stands up and I see why Dean was wincing, screaming at her I let all my anger at that one touch out.
Smiling, an elderly Castiel softly grips the hands of his children. His chest wheezes with each breath and the machines keeping him alive beep sporadically. Claire sobs beside him and Ben quietly comforts her, but tears are falling from his eyes as well.
"Dean, it's Sam! Sammy is a chubby twelve-year-old! And yeah,we can keep these ones." I laugh at his bitch face and drive to school.
"I've done something unforgivable, I've done something awful." I feel dread seep into my chest and I inch away from my dad.
Before I know whats happening he's sitting on my stomach and running his hands along my sides, causing me to laugh. He ontinues to ickle me as I gasp for air, tears streaming down my face and laughter bubbling from my throat.
"Yeah." Dean and I chorus together, giving each other surprised looks, I felt a swell of happiness looking at him. I feel drawn to his soul, I can't explain it.
"Novak's?" A petite voice asks. I glance at the person speaking and stand up, following my brother, Gabriel. I notice how the woman's heels rub a bit at the back and her blazer is perfectly fitted to her torso. She weaves her way into a pristine white office and waves a hand at the chairs in front of her desk, taking a seat in her comfy chair.
I grip his tightly and rub his back, murmuring soothing words as he cries into my shoulder, this seemed to happen a lot. He tightly grips the fabric of the jumper I'm wearing between his fingers and pushes his head into my shoulder. Two weeks he's been bottling up these emotions, two weeks and he's finally snapped.
"I'm so proud of you, Dean. You did it! And your score is incredible, you could do anything!" He laughs and pulls me up for another round of dancing, in which we manage to knock over the T.V stand. I hear a knock on the door and walk over to it, elation filling my chest.
The next morning we drag our feet downstairs and greet the rest of our group, Dean pours himself a coffee and pulls me in for a hug, kissing my temple softly. We hear a coo from the doorway and smile when Charlie walks in.
Dean turns and sighs, shaking his head. I focus back on his face and smile sheepishly, I always felt guilty checking in on him like that but he never told me what he was feeling.
"She, uhh, basically, um, well, they both..." I trail off and open my eyes, looking at Cas' bandaged foot peeking out from under the covers. A deep voice echoes throughout the room, the police officer.
"Okay, first question. Name all your siblings with one fact about each." He rests his head on his hands and stares into my eyes, stunning me for a second.
"Do you want to get an ice pack?" He whispers while evaluating my face. I shake my head and he leads me to class. Where the same routine as yesterday continues.
"I can dig Elvis, you?" He nods, a slow smile spreading across his face. I smile softly back and bow to him, holding out my hand.
"Alright kids, enough talkin'. Everyone this is Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak, new students to our class this year. All of you better make them feel welcome, Benny, get your behind up here, you're their guide for today." Mr. Singer sits down as a boy walks up to us with a smirk on his face. I glance at Dean and notice how his soul was dimmer now. He grins at Benny and shakes his hand, this confuses me. His soul is sad but his face is happy, people are weird.
"Look who I sent it to." My heart drops and I look at his texts, groaning when I see Cas' name as the contact. I scroll down and see his text back.
I walk through our old house, my fingers trailing along the wall. I follow the Elvis song playing through our radio and almost faint when I reach the kitchen.
"That's okay, sir, thanks for the address." I hang up and drive to Cas' house. I scoop him up and he clings to my shoulder, I awkwardly walk up to his front door and it's opened by his father. He chuckles and takes Cas from me, gesturing for me to stay he walks off into the house. I sway a little and rub the sleep from my eyes, I would need to eat soon, thank god my pay was due tomorrow or I'd have to earn some quick cash. Shuddering I watch the shadow of Cas' father come closer to the door.
"Done sweetie, be here tomorrow." I let out a breath of relief and drive to the next place, one down, three more to go.
"Go on a date with me. A real, proper date." I blurt out spontaneously, caught up in the feel of the moment. He grins at me and nods, his cheeks tingeing themselves red.
"Good, Dean, here's your second serve of pancakes, eat up." I see Sam's grateful expression in the rear view mirror and Dean's eye roll out of the corner of my eye. I chat to Sam about books as we drive to school and Dean eats his maple covered pancakes with a barely controlled hunger. We pull in and Sam runs off to his friends while Dean finishes his pancakes.
My dad sighs and drops his head into his hands, giving Sam a small smile. I leap out of bed and throw myself into my dad's arms, sobbing as the images of Dean's scared face flash across my mind. He hugs me back and then pushes me towards the bed again, gesturing to the whimpers coming from behind me.
"Dean! Table 43 is ready for the bill, bring it over to them, then your shifts over." I curse and hurriedly deliver the bill to a table of two families. The two fathers were enthusiastically talking about cars and the wives were comparing something on their phones, the three kids looked bored out of their brains.
of people touching me and I have to lock it up to keep working in the diner because I need the money. Cas moved in and I have to pay for him now, the extra water, electricity and gas. Don't get me wrong, I love having him here, it's just hard because he's paying for college."
"I have taco filling up my nose because of you!" Cas just laughs even harder and I notice Sam, Chuck, and all his siblings trying not to laugh as well. I smile evilly and stand up slowly, I make my way over to an unsuspecting Cas. He was still doubled over in laughter and I pull his chin up, stopping his laughter effectively. I grin at him and kiss him, smearing taco filling all over his face, he tries to push back and I move away a bit before I wipe my hand down my face and put in Cas' hair.
We sit down slowly, avoiding the gaze of everyone else and just stare and our feet. I hear a cough and look up, seeing a boy with a mullet smiling at us.
So here I am. I tap my fingers across the steering wheel and try to calm my breathing as I trail their car to where they lived. I was excited and scared at the same time, I was following my best friend but I was intruding into his life. The nervous flutter in my chest turned into a full on thumping as we pulled onto a familiar road. It was my street, the other end of my street, and that was my house up the road.
"Everything here is in order, but we have to question your choice of residence." I sigh, knowing that I would have to explain my life story.
I shake my head at the memory and tip toe downstairs, quietly making breakfast for Sammy. The usual morning routine, except this time I had to avoid passing out.
"I don't own a laptop so I kinda can't do" he gestures towards my laptop "that. Sorry man, I usually do my work at the library." He laughs and I try to join in genuinely but I can't help but observe his soul, quiet and reserved.
Sammy is sitting stifly on the couch, his expression fearful as he avoids my gaze, next to him is John. I sniff my surrounding slightly and smell whiskey, I glance back and Sammy and he nods his head slightly, it was our conformation code. I nod back slightly and straighten my back, holding my chin high and staring at a blank spot on the wall across from me.
I nudged Cas' shoulder with my own and nodded towards Benny, who was waving at us frantically. We grinned and walked over to him together, I still had a balloon of happiness in my chest from laughing with Cas. Benny walks us over to the jocks table and begins to introduce everyone to us.
The football team rushes at us and before we can even begin to fight back there are five guys holding each of us up in the air. I struggle and open my mouth to scream for help when they force a gag into my mouth, I frantically search for Cas and find him in the same position as me. He looks at me with tears in his eyes and erratic breathing, I just want to comfort him but I can't.
"Come on, Sam. I'll patch you up and then I'll go buy you guys some food, sound good?" He gave me a weird look and slowly nodded. As I patched him up I used some of my angelic ability, since meeting Dean I had been using it less and less. But this was desperate.
"Sam!" I call out "I need your help, somethings wrong with Dean." Sam's head whips up so fast it was a blur. I saw the brief look of pure terror before he dropped everything and ran across to his older brother. I worriedly look at Dean again and see he's shaking slightly and getting paler by the second. I grip his arm and gently tug him towards the ground, he sits down automatically, reminding me of a robot.I squat next to him and watch as Sam skids to a stop next to me. He pushes me out of the way, kneeling down in front of Dean. I let out a noise of protest as my body lands on the floor but decide against complaining, instead watching what Sams murmuring quietly to his brother.
That being said it was almost impossible to move away from Cas after that, even though my face hurt from the hard contact of his lips. We stared into each other's eyes and his hair was sticking up in every direction, his cheeks bright red. I pull back slowly and glance at Sammy who's grinning from ear to ear.
I wake up in a cold sweat with my heart pounding in my chest, I slowly untangle myself from Cas and stumble to the kitchen, my stomach threatening to empty its contents. I shakily pour myself a glass of water and spill it on my chest, flinching at the cold as memories spill into my thoughts.
"Move Dean, I just came back for some money and I'll be off." I glanced at his hands and saw all my hard earned money in a fat envelope, anger rose in my chest and I opened my mouth to scream at him that it was for Sammy when someone beat me to it.
"I'll tell the nurse, but you two have to promise you won't leave, or get upset." His voice is frail and petrified, Sam immediently jumps up and calls for the nurse. A crowd of doctors walk in and look surprised that Dean let me touch him, a police officer follows and Dean swallows nervously before opening his mouth.
"Why didn't you tell me, boy?" He asks, his voice wavering. "All this time, I never knew- never even considered. Dean, why didn't you tell anyone?" I laugh softly, the look of horror on his face etched into my mind.
"Dean Winchester? I''m Gordon Walker and these are my associates, Claire and Bobby. We've been expecting you, the manager let us in, I hope you don't mind?" I shake my head, keeping my shoulders straight and trying to avoid shaking in fear. The three people in monkey suits gesture for me to sit down and I do, shifting into a comfortable position.
He pulls me closer and I deepen the kiss, loving the feeling that it bought. He pulls back and rests his forehead against mine.
"Why must we do exams at the end of the year! We have one day to study guys, one day! Our exams start tomorrow and Charlene is giving Dean's face a massage." I throw my pencil at his face and we all laugh when he splutters and glares at me.
"I was hoping to be smooth about this but I can't find a way to slip this seamlessly into the non-existent conversation so here it goes." I take a deep breath, my confidence fading fast. "Dean Winchester, here is my number. Please call me and we can catch up outside of school sometimes, not right now cause my dads waiting in the car but, sometime." I wink at Deans flushed face and offer Sam a small wave, which he returned with a bemused grin.
He's pushed back into the lockers now with tears streaking his face, following the tracks of the nail marks down each cheek. His green eyes are dull and missing their usual spark, his lips are split and bleeding and he's shaking. I cry out, my heart aching for my boyfriend and I see him slowly look up at me, his expression falling for a second before being smoothed back into a blank, crying face.
"Dammit Cas, stop making me laugh! My stomach hurts!" He just grins in reply and nudges me with his shoulder, racing ahead to high five Benny, who was waiting outside our class. I grimace at the pain that lances through my ribs at his touch but shake it off, joining Castiel and Benny as we head to our next class. This making friends thing was fun.
The door to the locker room came down with a crash and I only had to second to understand this before my dad was kneeling in front of me and touching my face. The pain echoing throughout my body made the world appear slow and dull.
"See ya tomorrow, Dean" I smile at him and climb into the Impala, smiling at Sammy's sleeping form leaning against the window. I drive down the street and open the motel door before coming back and picking up Sammy.
All of his equipment, healthy complexion, hands full of food and a grin on his face. Why was Dean different? I decided I'd follow him next week and see what happened.
I struggle again and again as the team continues to hit an unconscious Cas, three cracks following their actions. My heart is racing and tears are blurring my vision, demons, demons were beating up my boyfriend because of what my father does.
I school my face into neutrality but inside I was a nervous wreck, my palms were sweaty and my heart was thumping wilding. Not the thumping that followed Cas but the thumping of fear. My father raises himself off the couch and starts circling me, something he does before a lecture.
Only then do I notice his eyes, intensely blue. I stare at them for a minute before he glances away shyly. I notice the pink tinge across his cheeks and he suddenly glances back and offers me a small smile.
"You, you killed my daughter, you know that? The demon in Mississippi? That was her." My heart sinks and I notice Cas' eyes widen.
"So your first day went well, I assume?" I nod vigorously and describe each class to him, finishing with an excited yell about making the football team with Dean Winchester. This was what I loved about my dad, you could to him about anything. I tap my fingers absentmindedly on the black dashboard and examine the scenery passing by my window but I can't help but compare the green trees to Deans' eyes.
"Yes but Caaaaaas! You know I like girls and Black Widow is just, ugh." We both groan and turn to Dean expectantly, watching him grin at us.
I walk into my room and giggle when I hear the shower running, Dean must be getting ready for bed. I get changed and crawl into bed, trying to generate some warmth before Dean climbed in with me. I hear a few shuffles and Dean walks out with his pyjama pants on and rubbing his eyes tiredly. I clear my throat and he freezes before bolting back to the bathroom, I know why.
"I'm so sorry, Dean. Could you ever forgive me?" I blink slowly at my dad, who was silently crying. He covers his mouth and takes a shuddering breath.
"What hurts, De? Mr Novak bought some pain medication over for us so you have to take some." I ruffle his hair and wonder how he was so amazing. He was kind, selfless, happy and serene all the time. I was lucky and incredibly proud to call him my brother.
I learnt that Dean and visited every state at least twice, his brother is the best thing in his life, his baby (the car) was the next best thing in his life, I was his best friend (which according to him was very important), he loved pie and he kept a lot of secrets. Secrets that I wanted to know.
I sigh and think about Football to myself, my face softening at the idea of being able to play the game. It helped get my mind off my social anxiety.
I glance up a Dean shocked and he just grins at me before giving my hand a gentle squeeze. I bite my lip and squeeze back as we turn to watch the movie. The entire time I can feel the heat rise to my cheeks and it almost completely distracts me from the words being hurled at us.
"You two make an adorable couple, just make sure your bedroom door is always open Cas, otherwise you two have to hang out in the loungeroom." Dean turns a vibrant shade of pink and dad just laughs at him.
I wake up before my alarm and lie in the warmth of my bed before it goes off. I sigh and push a foot out of the covers, shivering when it encounters freezing air. I groan and heave myself out of bed, shaking from the cold and hugging myself to keep some warmth.
"I know, Ben. But it was crooked." I grin and Ben smiles back, I hear heels behind me and Dean groaning.
"And no. I'm not ready but I'll fake it till I make it. How are you, Sam? Have you had breakfast?" He smiles sleepily at me and nods.
"Morning all, you ready for today?" We all groan and go our separate ways to get ready for the exam. I feel the familiar stone of dread seep into my stomach and nerves flutter, I hope I pass this exam. I feel Dean's lips on my temple again and I smile up at him.
"Alright, well everything looks to be in order and we are looking for new waitstaff. You're hired sweetie, what hours would you prefer?" I grin at her and think a little. I still had school and football so,
I dig into my breakfast as we make plans to move my furniture into his apartment, the longer we talk the more excited I feel. We plan where my things are going to go and eventually decide to make this an entire day job, starting tomorrow.
"You just gotta take it step by step, and start by talking to Sam and Cas, okay? Then let your daddy over and keep things calm, start with happy stories and when you build a better relationship, then talk about the dark stuff."
"Good Morning human." I grin and roll my eyes, shifting in my seat to avoid the rubbing of fabric against open wounds. He grins at me and winks, which causes Sammy to laugh in the backseat. Cas is amazing, he can make Sammy laugh after a night like that, I was so lucky to call him mine.
I pull out my laptop and start it up, but when I type in my password I look over the top of my screen and see Dean sitting there awkwardly. He looks up and grins shyly at me, I grin back and tease him slightly
"Okay Castiel, lets call the nurse back." They press the button and Meg walks in, her dimpled smile surveying Lucifer briefly. I explain quickly and Meg smiles, handing me my clothes. I awkwardly get changed, trying to minimalise the movement of my ribs and then I grab my crutches and slowly walk out to into the hallway.
I tidy my hair and straighten my clothes before I walk in the front door and head to one of the waitstaff. She was a petite thing, with wavy blonde hair and a cute smile. I grin at her and ask if there were any job openings. Same deal as every place I would be visiting today, I had to get as many jobs as I could to pay for Sammy, without him knowing of course. The girl smiles and runs off the get the manager, she soon returns with an older brunette.
I climb into my car and devour all of the pizza before I even open the door to my room. It was amazing and eased the pain in my stomach instantly.
"Dean! How are ya boy?" He asks as he pulls away, I shrug and look down a bit. After the 'incident' Bobby became a second father to me, I can talk to him without having to express my emotions. But I can't hide anything from him either, he's become a second father to a lot of people and he can tell when something's wrong.
"Well, the thing that's probably on your mind is the Dad insults, right? Well, remember when I told you my father was either loving or an ass?" He nods down at me and continues to stroke my hair.
"Of course, Sam. Anything for the Winchesters." He smiles a little at my words but I'm dead serious.
"Please, De. I deserve to know!" Sammy's heartbroken expression is what finalizes my decision. I feel Cas' hand on my own and I look at him surprised, my heart thumping wildly in my chest. I can feel the blush creeping up my face as he nods at me and smiles gently. I take a deep breath and summarize without details.
"Then when they started on me I was so glad Cas didn't see it, he didn't need to see it, then he had to watch it in a dream." Dean's tearing himself up over this? Over Castiel? My heart warms and breaks at the same time, dean cared about my son so much but there was so much pain in his voice when he spoke.
"What did Dad mean when he said to ask how you'd gotten quick money?" His question feels like a blow to the stomach. I jerk back and begin to scramble away, only stopping when Cas places a comforting hand on my shoulder.
He looks warily at my dad and angles us so he's standing closer to my dad. Dad just laughs and pats Dean on the back.
I would rank this dinner as probably one of the best dinners of my life, well, it was in my top ten. Chuck puts three packets of tortillas on the table and everyone just digs in, it takes all my willpower to eat with proper table manners and not just stuff my face with an abundance of the delicious food.
"You wanna catch up after school today? Maybe get milkshakes and work on history?" He blushes slightly and nods slowly, milkshakes it is. I feel giddiness rise in my chest and I know I probably look like a grinning fool, oh well, this was Dean we were talking about.
"Cause when you're scared I'll always calm you down, and when you're upset, it makes me upset." I kiss him, grateful for such an amazing boyfriend.
I was slightly scared, and by slightly scared I mean terrified. I was worried for Cas' safety and I was worried someone would jump out and yell 'kidding!' at us before we got picked on again. I hold onto his hand tightly and try to relax, letting myself fall into the conversation, finding that I liked it.
"I could kiss you right now Cas but we're in public. I'll do it when we're alone." He pulls the jumper on at it fits, it's even a little big on him. Black, with ACDC splashed in red across the front, perfect for him. He snuggles into it and shoves his hands in the pockets, proabably trying to warm them. I smile slightly at the sight of him in a big jumper.
I stand frozen as the football team kick the crap out of Dean. My hands are shaking but I can't move from the car for two reasons, the first, I think I'm in shock, the second is that if I leave I know Sam will try and help his brother.
and I'm back to working night shifts as well at The Roadhouse just to pay the bills again. I mean, I have to feed three people now! All the stress built up last night and then my nightmare was worse than usual and the therapy isn't helping anymore! What am I supposed to do?"
"Thank you, there are a few allegations. Did your father leave you for long periods of time to care for your brother? Did your father leave you insufficient amounts of money? Did your father abuse you?"
"We gotta be home in ten for the first interview, Dean." I visibly see Dean's shoulders sag and I pull his chin up, he smiles at me but I can see the sadness in his eyes. We walk out, me on crutches, Dean limping with every step and Sam soon joins us.
Dean finishes nailing the replacement post into place and straightens, dragging the back of his hand through the sweat on his forehead. “Spoken like a man trying to weasel out of pulling his own weight. You do remember—”
“So find out,” Sam says, cracking a smile behind the neck of his bottle. “We figured out how to save the world how many times? I think we can figure out how to slow down for a while.”
Dean pushes away from the counter, angling himself toward the door. Miracle perks up and gets back on his feet. “Okay. Cool. Good talk. I’m going to go… find some liquor.”
Dean catches himself on the railing. He stumbles free, dusts off his jacket, and says, “How much you asking for it?”
It doesn’t look like much the first time Dean sees it. The wooden siding and the slats lining the floor of the porch sit loose, all of them a rain-battered, sun-bleached grey. The roof slouches a little on one side, and the parking lot is more dirt than concrete. Weeds headbutt their way through the cracks between parking spaces. The door sticks and whines when Dean works the handle and shoulders it open. Inside, the tables are buried under eight years of dust that might as well be eighty. It feels more like walking into a crypt than a bar.
Dean swallows and clenches his fists in tighter, like he’s going to have to knock his own teeth in to get the words out. God, Cas deserves better. But fuck it. “I’ve had so many chances and I’ve wasted every single one of them. And I… I don’t want to know if this is the last one I’m going to get.”
They kiss until Dean has to break away to yawn. Cas cards his fingers through Dean’s hair and says, “You should sleep.”
“Didn’t have to.” Sam’s smile widens as he slips his hands in his pockets. “Mostly, I got about as far as ‘Dean wants to open a hunter bar’ and they were on board. There’s, uh — a little from Jody and Donna, and the girls, and Garth, and—”
But Dean’s laughing too hard to hear the rest. The phone gets pulled away and settles on Jody’s face. “Hi, Dean. Listen, I know what you’re going to say, so here’s what I’m going to say. Not a single one of us would give this to you if we didn’t want to. And we’re not taking it back. So use it. Or I have it on very good authority that Sam and Eileen are going to run away to the Bahamas with it.”
“You told me I was the most caring person you’d ever met,” Dean says. “You got that wrong. Maybe I convinced you to start, but… Cas, I’ve never known anyone that cares like you do. You turned on Heaven, on everything you ever thought was right, for me and Sam. You tried to give the angels a better way. How many times, how many ways, have you saved our lives? Hell, you went toe to toe with us just to give Jack a chance at life. You care so much it scares the hell out of me sometimes, and other times… other times I know it makes you the best thing that ever happened to me.”
“It’s falling apart,” he says flatly the second time Dean asks. “My back went out ten years back, and they moved the highway, so business dried up. No one wanted it. Don’t know why the hell you want it, but I ain’t askin’ questions.”
Dean digs his teeth into the back of his lip. He really needs to get a case of beer out here already. “Yeah, well. You know me.”
“I’m happy for you, though,” Benny says, painting a stripe down the next post. “It’s ‘bout time you got your shit together.”
“I ain’t, uh… I ain’t really one for speeches, so, I’m gonna keep this short,” Dean says when the room goes quiet again. “I wouldn’t have this place without you all. Hell, I wouldn’t even have been here to dream it up without some of you.” His eyes stray over to Cas, who squeezes his hand again.
The old man’s name is Henry Mason, and he doesn’t trust banks. Dean’s pretty damn sure it’s not that easy, that he’ll probably be begging Sam to do some fancy key work later, but whatever. If it means no one’s looking at his credit or his record or whatever the hell else he definitely doesn’t want anyone looking at, then sign Dean up. On the dotted line.
It’s Sam that gets him most of the money. When he hands Dean the envelope while they’re standing in the bunker’s kitchen, Dean has to drop onto one of the stools, stunned.
Cas smiles again. He catches Dean’s jaw, his palm wide and warm against Dean’s skin. Dean swallows down the nerves that jitter in his stomach and for once in his life, he meets Cas half way.
Then there were the calls that hadn’t come. Bobby’s voice never came through, and Mom’s name never lit up the phone. Ellen, or Kevin, or… Dad. Jack had promised them a choice. He couldn’t blame them for choosing paradise. But he’d be lying if he said it didn’t sting, if he didn’t keep lighting up his screen every now and again, hoping for a missed call.
Dean occupies himself swallowing half the water bottle in two gulps. He drags the back of his wrist across his lips and finally says, “Well, it clearly worked, didn’t it?”
Dean doesn’t mean to go back. It’s been a couple days since Jack put things back and brought Cas home and… and now Dean’s standing here, in front of the open door to the dungeon room. He doesn’t know how he got here. One minute he was pouring himself a finger of whiskey and the next he was drifting down the hall, glass in hand.
“So no,” Dean presses on, because he broke open the dam and now he can’t stop the flood. “No, you’re not getting another chance to tear yourself out of my life, like it’s worth living without you in it. Like I don’t feel the hole in every room where you should be when you’re gone.”
Dean lays there a moment. He listens to the bunker humming around them. Footsteps shuffle somewhere down the hall, and he hears the low hum of someone’s voice, too distant to pick out the words. A door shuts around the corner. And under Dean’s cheek, Cas breathes, slow and even. Dean finds himself thinking again of the roadside where Jack brought the world back to life, how much he’d missed these thousand little whispers of other people.
She snorts. “Not all of us have angel boyfriends that heal our old man joints at the bat of our eyelashes, either, but you don’t hear us bitching.”
“Sorry! I’m sorry, I just… I mean, you’re—” He cuts himself off, holding a hand up and then dropping it into his lap and schooling his face. “I’m sorry. Go ahead.”
“My feelings should not have been put on you like that, and I — your friendship means more to me than anything. I don’t wish for what I said to jeopardize that.”
“I won’t be hands on,” Jack says moments later, as Dean’s still watching the world take its first breath after a long, terrible coma. “Chuck put himself in the story, and that was his mistake. But I learned from you, and from my mother, and from Castiel that when people have to be their best, they can be. And that’s what to believe in.”
Cas’s breath hitches behind him. He knows the look Cas wears now without looking. He’s seen it so many times. The sadness that rounds his eyes, the pain tight at the corners of his mouth. Dean squeezes his eyes shut tighter and pictures it, the last time he saw that look, with Cas standing between Dean and the sigil barely holding the door shut.
“Yeah, bet you don’t even have to. He can feel a disturbance in the profound bond, or whatever,” Charlie says.
Dean yanks him into his arms. One wraps around his back, tight enough to bruise, while the other spans his shoulder. Dean’s palm cups the back of Cas’s neck, his eyes shutting. It takes Cas one surprised moment to raise his arms, but he does, pulling Dean impossibly closer as his fists curl into Dean’s jacket.
Cas swipes at his phone screen a few times. Then he hands it to Dean, presenting him with a paused picture of Claire’s face filling the screen. Dean presses the play button over her nose.
“I don’t know how long it took me. Three hours? Four?” His throat is so tight he has to force the words out one by one. “I couldn’t do it. For the longest time, I couldn’t do it. Because the thought—” His eyes start to sting. He shuts them. “The thought of walking out of here and leaving you behind for good kept me on my knees.”
Cas reaches over, pulling Dean’s hand away from his neck and catching it in his own. “Dean, do you think I wouldn’t say something if I didn’t want to be part of this?”
As fast as it had come, the relief Dean had felt drains. It leaves him hollow. Jack’s leaving too. Loss upon loss upon loss. A loss for every win. The Winchester lot. And the sound of Castiel’s name rips open the ache in Dean’s chest he’d been trying to ignore, to cauterize with the burn of whiskey. He drops his eyes down to Jack’s sand-caked sneakers. He feels Jack’s steady gaze, but he can’t meet it.
“I know. I didn’t even have time to get pissed at him because he — he cashed it in. To save me from Billie.” Dean drops his head and stares at his faint, twisted reflection in the chrome of the counter.
“All I’m saying,” Sam starts softly, pulling Dean’s gaze back to him, “is that maybe we’ve earned a little retirement.”
“Dean,” Cas says again. Dean hears him move closer. Dean just keeps going, through the second door and past the table in the corner, past the chair prone at his feet, until he’s standing right where he stood that night.
Cas carries the wood around the other side of the porch. Dean turns back to the railing and tests it with a few good tugs. It holds. Dean hooks a hand around the post and pulls himself to his feet with a wince, his knees popping as they straighten. He slots the hammer into the band on his tool belt and looks out over the parking lot. They still need to do something about all that broken concrete. And the roof, he’s dreading even looking at the damn roof. Saving the money and doing most of the work themselves had sounded good from the armchair he’d planned it out in, beer in hand, but the reality is, all thirty years and change of hunting is suckerpunching him right in the lower back every time he touches that hammer.
Charlie gives him a look. “Is this the part where you tell me you weren’t into dudes until a literal angel fell in your lap? And you’re dating him on a technicality?”
“Dean, I—” Cas seems to hesitate. At least Dean isn’t the only one struggling for words, here. “I shouldn’t have done it like that. At the time, I thought — it seemed like the only way to — to stop Billie, to give you a chance. Had I any other choice, I wouldn’t have burdened you like that.”
“Chuck made many mistakes,” Jack says, after a moment. “And those that fell victim, those that lost their lives for the sake of his story? Those that you miss? I’ll give them the choice they didn’t have. Their lives back if they want them, or they rest they’ve earned.”
Dean snorts. He can hear Sam hammering around the side of the building, and the distant murmur of Cas’s voice between the beats. He paints another stripe, this time along the handrail at the top.
“This was my idea, I know, I know.” Sam rolls his eyes, lifting the board back onto his shoulder. “I’m never going to live that down, am I?”
He looks at the spot he’d crumpled into on the floor. He’d wept until his eyes ached, until it left him shaking and nauseous. His head felt at once heavy and hollow, full of nothing but the echo of Cas’s voice, over and over. And one moment Dean would be angry, slamming his fist down against the floor as he growled, “You stupid son of a bitch.” And in the next moment the anger would bleed out of him as he tried to figure out who he was talking to: Cas, or himself. Cas, for pulling the kind of insane, reckless, ridiculous stunt he always pulls to save Dean’s worthless life. Or himself, for letting him, for not getting up again. Then Cas, for leaving Dean with words too honest and beautiful to look at, bright with grace Dean hasn’t ever deserved, and leaving Dean’s eyes burning sure as if he’d shed his vessel. Then himself, for his own words sticking in his throat, for answering with nothing but tears, for wasting so much god damn time.
There’s a pause, and then footsteps marching down from the library. Cas appears in the doorway. His coat’s off, and the suit jacket, and his shirt sleeves are rolled up to his elbows. It’s a damn good look on him and Dean’s mouth feels a little dry, all the sudden.
“It’s not! I said it’s not!” Dean throws his hands up. The pot sways again, the hook rattling a little.
“Come on, though, I’m serious,” Dean says, rubbing at his neck like that’s going to hide anything. “Is this what you want? Because shit, Cas, it’s not gonna be the dream if you’re just gonna wish you were somewhere else. It’s with you or it’s… we find something else.”
Dean smothers another yawn into Cas’s shoulder instead of answering. Cas lets go of Dean’s back to stretch for the bedside lamp. He could turn it off with a thought, if he wanted, but something goes warm under Dean’s sternum whenever he does things the human way anyway. When the light clicks off, Cas pulls him down until Dean’ half-sprawled across Cas’s chest. He slides his fingers back into Dean’s hair.
—the certainty of knowing they’re out there, living, working, being—until, like a banked fire, it was gone. To get it back after that stagnant emptiness is a feeling he’ll never have the right words for. He’s never felt so glad to hear the handbell of a passing bike, or the screeching laugh of a woman sitting at an outdoor table at the restaurant behind them. A car passes, ruffling Dean’s hair, and he smiles.
Charlie barks out a laugh as Eileen breaks into a wide grin. Dean can’t look at Benny or he might actually die.
“I’d still like to hunt now and again, if I can be useful. And Jack… when he brought me back, he said he’d like my help making changes in Heaven.”
Back down the porch stairs stands the old man that had walked Dean up from the roadside. His beard stretches below the collar of his button-up, and it's stained tobacco-yellow near his chin. He folds his arms and frowns as the last stair caves in under Dean’s foot.
Laughter ripples down from the library. Dean leans his head to the side. He can just see Eileen, half-turned as she is toward one of the bookshelves. He only catches the motions of one hand as she signs. The other is blocked by the back of Cas’s trench coat as he stands near one of the tables. She’s smiling at him. Dean watches Cas’s arm lift, watches his hand curl and turn, his fingers crooking into shapes Dean doesn’t understand. Eileen laughs again.
“No, shut up, just…” Dean stops at the counter’s edge. He takes a long breath. Miracle sits down at his feet and pants up at him.
“Between living and enjoying life?” Cas studies him for a moment. The refrigerator hums behind them. Finally, Cas sighs and looks down at their hands. “Dean, building a life with you is more than I ever dared to hope I’d get. I thought it would be too bold to imagine what it would look like.” He looks up, running his thumb over Dean’s knuckles. “But I think this sounds good.”
And because his luck apparently still hasn’t recovered from Chuck’s crap, right as he cracks the cap he hears Charlie say, “Cas! Come gossip about Dean’s flirting technique with us.”
There’s a name painted on the wall over the liquor shelves, like it’s headlining a tombstone. That’ll be the first thing to go. Dean walks the length of the counter, the wooden floor creaking under his heels. When he reaches the end, he raps his knuckles against the bar top, leaving a mark in the dust. He strolls back to the door. It groans open on the second pull.
Cas smothers the smile until it’s straining at the corners. “I’m very good at watching you. It’ll suit my skillset.”
Dean’s been calling it a second chance. But it’s more like the fourth, fifth, fourteenth, seventy-second. Who’s counting? What matters is, there was still one more. Jack got them one more. And Dean’s never gonna be able to repay the kid for that. Except by taking it.
Sam leans forward. “What do you mean ‘there it is’? That’s it? You just left him hanging when you could be making out with him right now?”
Laughter bubbles across the tables, and then more cheering as Dean lifts the glass of champagne that Sam hands him. He downs it one swallow to more cheers and abandons the glass on the bar.
“Jesus Christ.” Dean crushes his face into his palms, turning to taking a few steps toward the fridge. “This is a nightmare.”
Henry gives him two weeks to come up with five thousand in cash, even. Dean has to ask him twice if he heard the number right.
“I don’t know, Sam.” Dean glances over the blinking consoles lining the corner, and the map spread under his feet. His eyes wander to the bookshelves up the stairs, and then snag on Cas where he’s still standing by the table, turned enough now to have his hands curled around an empty chair. He turns his head, and looks up. Dean looks away on instinct, back down to the bottle now resting on his thigh. Dammit. He promised himself he'd do better than that. He takes a breath, and lifts his head again. Cas is waiting for him. His mouth quirks up a little. Half a smile tugs at Dean’s lips in answer.
Benny nods again. He leans back. “Well, if it helps, it sounds like everyone here’s just happy you two stopped circling each other like a couple o’ dogs. Sounded like no one knew if you were gonna fight or… fall in bed.”
Dean couldn’t have stopped the gasp that bursts out of him if he’d tried. For a moment, just a split second trick of the eye, Dean swears he sees wings spreading back behind the gas station wall, in iridescent colors that shift as the light does. He swears the sunlight makes a kind of crown over the top of Cas’s head, bending and circling above him. Then it’s gone, and Cas’s head tilts the way it always tilts, and his backwards tie sways a little where the breeze catches it, and it’s
“You’re acting like you’re about to tell me you have cancer or something,” Sam says, narrowing his eyes as Dean paces back toward the table. “Whatever it is, just say it.”
The bar is all dark, polished now, sanded smooth. Posters line the walls, old western movies and old concert ads, with a few framed records here and there. Scattered among them are photos, old prints of their parents and a few of Sam and Dean, a few more of their friends. One of Dean and Castiel that Sam took in the library when he took they weren’t looking. He caught Cas smiling, so that one sits where Dean can see it from the bar. And above that bar, painted across the mirror that covers half the wall and holds most of the liquor shelves, is the name: Second Chance Saloon.
Charlie and Eileen fall into a fresh round of giggles as Dean mumbles, “Nope, not doing this,” and carries his bottle toward the doorway Cas is still blocking.
Sam just smiles at him. “Let’s just say you got a lot of grateful friends out there that are just really happy the world didn’t end. And uh, you know. An anonymous, downstairs benefactor that’s really happy you ‘fixed it.’ She said you’d know what that meant.”
Cheers go up around the room. Dean casts his eyes down and keeps smiling. Cas starts to pull away but Dean tightens his fingers without looking at him. Cas stills, and after a moment, squeezes back.
He launches into a list of ingredients that makes Eileen’s eyes light up, and Dean catches Charlie’s eye and grins. She carries her dustpan over to a big black garbage bag slumped next to another table and dumps it. Then she leans the broom against a chair, shoving away a piece of hair that falls out of her long braid and into her eyes. She wipes her hands on the frayed edge of her oversized t-shirt. It reads, “Women want me, fish fear me,” and Dean had laughed for a solid minute when she’d walked into the kitchen with it that morning.
Even the months he’d stolen for himself with Lisa, he couldn’t really leave it behind. He couldn’t stop twitching at every wrong sound, every sudden movement. And that had blown up in his face, anyway. Same as always. He finally figured he’s just never been meant for that kind of life. And if he slows down now, he’ll have to think too hard about what “meant for” even means, now that he knows Chuck was the one with the pen all along. Christ. He needs another beer if he’s going to start down that road. But really, the settle down, sleep in, smell the roses life? Always seemed like the kind of thing that happened to other people. It’s not that it doesn’t have its appeal, it’s just… he’s not sure he knows who he is if he isn’t five minutes and a duffle bag from the next hunt.
He’ll never forget watching the world blossom back into life, the bright swell of sound opening into the air and flourishing. He’d never understood that feeling of
“I probably said a lot of things.” Dean tips his beer back, and his head with it. Miracle props his chin onto the arm of Dean’s chair, and Dean runs a hand down his back.
Sam had pulled Dean out of the kitchen, where a promisingly greasy smell keeps wafting every time the door opens. He stands behind the bar at Sam’s side, and as he wipes his hands on a towel he slings over his shoulder, he feels another hand catch his fingers.
God, taking him shopping is the best thing Dean’s ever done in his life. Really, it was the threat of doing laundry twice as often that sealed the deal, because a week of Cas stealing Dean’s t-shirts to sleep in—well, to lounge in while Dean slept—had piled up. Cas had balked at first, protesting that he liked his clothes fine. And it wasn’t that Dean didn’t like seeing Cas stretching out his old Zeppelin shirt, or draped in a hoodie Dean hadn’t touched since the first time it landed on the coat hook near his door. It’s just that… he wanted Cas to have his own things. To choose to have his own things. And choose to keep them in the bunker. That was the point of all of this, anyway, right? Choosing their own lives, their own paths, choosing where to go from here. Or not go. And anyway, Cas would’ve ruined that damn suit jacket carrying around armloads of wood in it. That’s the excuse Dean actually went with, in the end.
“Eh. Sorta always knew your heart wasn’t in it,” Benny says. He smirks a little at the post in front of him.
Dean clears his throat. “I mean, technically we didn’t actually… you know, get, uh, together until… uh, after Jack sprung you back.”
There’s a dent in the door from Billie’s fist. If he looks on the other side, he knows the sigil will still be there, that the blood of Cas’s palm will be dry and brown and flaking. The chair is still overturned in the middle of the devil’s trap. Dean stares at the concrete blocks the Empty had clawed through, a black, wet void ripping open between them. He can still see Cas slipping into its depths like he’d slipped beneath the waves of the reservoir in South Dakota. Loss upon loss upon loss. Dean’s hand curls tight around the doorframe. He knocks back the whiskey in one swallow and sets the glass on the nearest shelf, next to an old, yellowed box of papers.
“I hate you so much,” Dean says, marching the rest of the way toward the door. Miracle scampers after him.
“You seriously — Cas, Jack brought you back from the fucking Empty, gave you — gave all of us — a life without an apocalypse in it and you’re going to spend it burying your feelings and telling yourself it’s fine?” Dean’s hands bunch into fists at his sides.
To Dean’s left, Sam starts knocking a fork against his glass. The din settles, heads turning toward him. Jesse and the hunter he was shooting pool with lean their sticks against the table and lean themselves on its edge. Over the creaky country tune that keeps piping from the jukebox, Sam says, “Hey everyone. We know you’re hungry for the burgers Dean and Benny have cooking—”
And Dean hates it. He hates that sad bend in Cas’s brow, and on his lips. He hates it so much he grits his teeth and says, “All right, you know what? New rule. No more martyrs in this house.”
The sound that punches out of Dean then as he opens his eyes is too brittle and bitter to be a laugh. “Isn’t that all we ever do? Cause each other pain?”
Cas is wearing the dark teal sweater that nearly had Dean choking on his own tongue the first time Cas walked out of the dressing room tugging on his sleeves. Even in the low light of the bar, and the soft neon with it, it catches that bright blue in Cas’s eyes. Dean swallows and folds their fingers together. And yeah, so the height of the bar might be making him braver than any personal growth, but… baby steps.
Dean turns his face into his hand, chuckling again as he hands the phone back to Cas. He slides his palm down his nose to hide his mouth behind it for a moment.
“Rib-sticking food,” Benny says, smiling. “Soak up all that beer. I like your style. You know, if we—”
Benny hums an acknowledgement. He slings his arm up to rest against his knee and sets his can down on the porch in front of him.
“I don’t know what I’m doing, either,” Cas says quietly. He comes to a stop right in front of Dean. “But if we figured out how to kill God, I have faith we can figure out how to do this.”
“Yeah, Dean.” Sam sits back as he says it, beer bottle landing over the Atlantic Ocean on the table. “I figured—I mean, when we were in your head—”
He settles his hand against Cas’s chest and closes his eyes again. After a moment, he says, “You really don’t get bored just laying here all night?”
“Fuck! Fine! He made some kinda deal when Jack died the first time, to get the Empty to leave him alone. His life for Jack’s. But the Empty wanted him to suffer. So the deal was, when he experienced a moment of true… like, happiness, it would pounce.”
A few whoops interrupt him. Dean smiles, and glances back at the kitchen in time to see Benny lean out the door, half an apron tied around his waist.
Sam makes a soundless ‘oh’ sort of face. Dean looks back down at the counter, raising one hand to rub the back of his neck. “That’s why it took me so long, when you were calling that day, I—anyway. There it is.”
Dean tenses a little. He can’t help it. Cas tightens his hand before Dean gets one word into a reply and says, “He wants to reshape things. Make it better. I wouldn’t be staying.”
Sam just keeps grinning, rocking back on his heels. “Yeah, they figured you’d say that.” He cranes his neck a little toward the door. “Hey, Cas?”
“Showoff,” Dean says, dry-throated and softer than he means to. Cas just smiles, taking it for the endearment it sounded like.
Jack turns and raises his hand in that stiff little wave of his, and Cas smiles. Dean barely keeps from sinking to his knees. He watches Cas pull Jack into a hug. He watches him embrace Sam, who slaps his back and mumbles something before pulling away to swipe a hand under his eyes. Then Cas’s gaze falls on Dean. His smile falters, tilting uneasily.
Dean tucks his chin, leaving his head where it is as he looks across the table. He gives the dog one last pat and then rolls his bottle between his hands. “We just got the world back, and you’re already trying to get rid of me?”
“Thanks, bitch,” he says to Sam. Sam pats his arm and wanders out of the kitchen. Cas stays right where he is, his thumb stroking the curve of Dean’s shoulder. Dean tips his head a little and lets his fingers weave between Cas’s. “So you’re on board with this?”
A smile fights its way onto Dean’s lips. “Why do you always manage to make these things sound like a root canal?”
“Apparently I don’t need to!” Dean spreads his hands on either side of his head. “What the hell, Sam?”
“Thank god,” Sam says. “I thought I was going to have to watch you keep pretending not to look at each other across rooms for the rest of my natural life.”
“Well, I can’t let a lady down, can I?” Benny says, and Charlie snorts. She looks over at Dean and winks.
It’s well after two in the morning when they finally make it back to the bunker after the party. The dishes are done, the tables are wiped, the floor’s swept, and most of the guests are herded back to the bunker’s rooms, or wherever else they had to go. Dean drags his feet down the hall behind Cas, letting himself be led to the room they now share. Dean leaves a trail of clothes between the door and the bed, shedding them gracelessly and tossing them without looking to see where they fall. Cas chuckles quietly behind him as he hangs his sweater in the closet, behind a few of Dean’s flannels.
Cas steps back to let Dean through, but he catches Dean’s wrist before he can clear the threshold. He turns, blocking Dean a little from view, and whispers, “Dean, are you—”
“Nah, you ain’t had it right if it ain’t got a roux going,” Benny’s saying as Dean steps inside. He’s got one of the barstools overturned on the floor and he’s kneeling beside it, a screwdriver in his hand. His head’s craned up toward Eileen, who’s kneeling on the back counter and washing the dust from the mirror. Charlie’s closer to the door, sweeping dust bunnies out from under one of the high tops.
“I—” Dean shifts his weight to his other foot and dips his brush back into the can. “Yeah, I—I’m sorry, though. For how it ended.”
Retirement. Right. It’s been a couple weeks since… you know, everything. God is dead to them and Jack’s making the most of his promotion and for the first time in too many years of Dean’s life, they’re not staring down the barrel of another apocalypse. He’s sitting at the table where they’ve planned the deaths of gods and angels, sharing a beer with his brother, nowhere to be. It feels… weird. It’s making him itch.
“You know, you’d probably be better tearing this place down and starting from scratch.” Sam pauses next to the railing Dean’s hammering, a long wooden board braced against his shoulder.
Dean paces the length of the kitchen and back as Sam leans back on the stool and watches him. His eyebrows rise higher with every circuit Dean makes, but Dean can’t make himself stand still. If he stands still, he’s going to have to look at him. Why was this so much easier when he was practicing it in the shower? To make matters worse, Miracle keeps trotting behind him, nails scraping an uneven rhythm on the floor.
“No, I — he wanted to move on. I’m sure he’s got a mountain of god crap to do. But he should know. I should’ve… said it.”
Dean finally looks up at him. As he does, Cas’s hand comes to rest on Dean’s shoulder. Dean hesitates a moment before letting go of his face and sliding his hand over Cas’s instead.
“I think I’d be more useful in a supervisory capacity,” Cas says. Dean looks over at him. Cas raises his chin, looking down his nose, until his lips start to twitch. Dean drops his head and laughs, and Cas smiles.
Dean can hear the smile when Cas says, “If there’s one thing I have never been with you, Dean Winchester, it’s bored.”
something be in the way. One apocalypse after another, one excuse after another, and I don’t — I don’t know what the hell I’m doing. This part of myself — it’s never been easy for me to look at. It’s still not.”
Cas tilts his head again as he settles, stiff as always, his knees brushing Dean’s thigh. “I don’t know the particulars of mixing alcohol beyond its effect on the body and the make of the—”
Dean sighs. “Look, growing up like I did? There wasn’t room for anything that made you… you know. Soft. It’s all ‘toughen up, kid’ and ‘walk it off’ and… anyway, you learn what to bury, if you get me. No one ever said anything to me about it, but no one had to, if I was smart enough.”
Dean feels that old, knee-jerk tightness under his skin, the kind that makes him straighten out of his lean and square his shoulders. It’s an ugly feeling that digs in hard, one that would’ve launched him into some manly-man joke or some kind of “whoa, there, sister” backpedaling not that long ago. He breathes through it until it eases instead, and mumbles, “I don’t bat my eyelashes.”
He twists a little to look over his shoulder. Cas tilts his head, a gesture so old and familiar that it knocks something loose in Dean’s chest, easing that tight feeling caught under his ribs. The smile he gets back is what’s new.
,” Dean cuts in, “is this... what you want? Going from ‘angel of the Lord’ to bartender is kind of a... you know. Massive downgrade?”
“How did you even contact—never mind, I don’t want to know.” Dean sets the envelope down. “Did you seriously pull the world savior card with people and demand money? For me?”
“We just wanted to take a minute to thank you all for being part of this,” Sam says. “So, now I’m gonna make my brother embarrass himself and say a few words.”
Sam shakes his head, but carries the board around the side of the building. Dean crouches again and pulls one last nail from his tool belt. As he works, Cas passes by with an armload of boards slung across his shoulder, his arm stretched up and around to hold them. He’s got on the soft grey henley Dean made him buy a couple weeks ago, and the edge of it is riding up, leaving a strip of skin open to the sun above his faded jeans. He catches Dean’s eye between the posts of the railing, and the corner of his mouth eases up.
Benny’s call was the one that surprised Dean the most. Jack had kept his promise, and he’d heard from Charlie less than a day after Cas came back, and Jo after that, and a few others. But Benny’s call had been the one that had Dean nearly dropping the phone. He’d come back human, but otherwise the same old Benny, that gentle drawl and that easy smile Dean could hear in the voice as he said, “Hey, brother. Don’t suppose you remember little old me?”
The tables are packed for this grand opening. The booths along the wall are full. Dean knows most of the faces in the house, or he’s heard the names of the curious hunters that turned up to fill in the blanks. Donna tips forward over the high top off to the left and laughs, cradling a pint as she leans into Jody and watches Alex gesticulate. He hears one of Garth’s twins squeal from a booth in the corner. Claire and Kaia keep elbowing each other out of the way as they argue over the jukebox in another corner. Cesar shouts something over the din that has Jesse leaning through the open french doors of the side room where they’d set up the pool table piece by piece. Charlie and Eileen are sitting to one end of the bar chatting. And even Rowena’s here, perched on one of the barstools like she’s holding court, a martini held aloft like a scepter. She catches Dean’s eye and winks.
“Not a chance,” she says, elbowing him again. She looks at him in a way that’s all his Charlie. Not that Apocalypse World Charlie wasn’t still cool, but… god, he’d missed the real deal. The one who rolls her head toward him and twists her lips to murmur out the corner of her mouth, “You think I didn’t have you pegged after you talked me through flirting with that guy?”
Dean manages to look up at that. Jack’s already got that enigmatic, Mona Lisa god-smile thing down to a science, so that’s great and completely unreadable. Still, hope spikes through the ache, too sharp and bright to smother. Jack nods to him, just once. And then behind him, rounding the corner of the gas station to stand in a stripe of sunlight, comes Castiel.
Cas isn’t looking at Dean as he says it. He’s looking at the chair. Dean watches him draw in a long breath, shoulders rising with it, such a strangely human thing to do.
“I’ll show you what you can do with your skillset,” Dean mutters. He realizes a moment too late how it sounds, and reminds himself a moment too late after that that it doesn’t matter. That it’s... it’s fine. It’s fine now, to... you know. It’s
“I’m sorry if I put you on the spot yesterday,” Benny says, glancing at Dean between the bars of the railing. He’s crouched on the porch while Dean stands on the ground on the other side, both of them painting a darker stain into the wood. “Didn’t mean to.”
“I think it would be good for you,” Cas says. He gently tugs his hand free and moves to sit at Dean’s side. “You seemed happy, in your dream.”
"It matters, Cas, because," Dean began, "hell, I want that too. I was a little slower to realize it, but I'm not lying to you." Dean looked down at the angel. His blue eyes were wide, almost hopeful, as he looked up at Dean.
"You're one of the closest friends I have, okay?" Dean tried. Cas looked at him, an eyebrow raised, waiting for him to continue. "But I'm a dumbass and had no idea why the hell you were so important to me."
The hunt ended up being extremely simple. A young couple-- a vampire and a werewolf-- were working together to pull off the killings of their victims. It only looked weird because of the way the bodies looked: evidence of both monsters' work that caused their deaths.
It was an action movie, and a pretty damn good one too. But every thought of the movie left his mind as the bathroom door opened and Cas came out of it, looking casual and relaxed and utterly gorgeous.
