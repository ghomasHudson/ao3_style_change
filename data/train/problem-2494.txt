"Plenty of those around." Sam told her, casting a sideways glance at Cas, who shifted slightly, both of them remembering Castiel's drunken comments. "So, what are you?"
, and Dean felt a pulse of fear surge through him. He’d fucked up. God, he’d fucked up. And he was stammering over his words as his brain tried to catch up, tried to figure out how he’d got it so wrong.
"It was my pleasure." She smiled and moved so that she was now kneeling on the bench, her head level with the tired angel's. She leant forward and placed a brief kiss on his cheek, warm, forgiving and loving. And with that, she vanished, leaving him alone on the bench.
They ended the call pretty soon after. There was quiet in the kitchen for a few seconds as they digested. Dean worried his lip with his teeth. They got phone calls from past contacts fairly regularly, civilians and police officers alike, but generally they were cases for them; this sounded weird.
"It's just..." Sam sighed, closing the laptop. "You call me the geek." He chuckled, leaning back. Dean turned now, raising his eyebrows at his brother.
“You gonna be alright getting home?” She asked, gesturing to a card for the local cab company, and he waved it off. It was a short walk, and the fresh air would do him good. He fished out his wallet, leaving a way too generous tip. She needed the cash way more than him, and he saw her eyebrows raise in surprise.
Dean waited a beat, and burst out laughing again. “I thought you were gonna say all angels actually learned the harp.”
"Well... it is strange." The old man sighed. "That's the very spot that my wife had a heart attack and died."
Breathing was a human trait, not needed in angels, but he felt his vessels lungs contract and expand faster than before, and a gnawing feeling in the pit of his stomach set in. "What does that mean?"
“Cas,” Dean bit out as he pulled away to catch his breath, just for a second, looking up at the ceiling and inhaling deeply. If they were doing this, he wanted to do this with a clear head. Cas was right to refuse the drink tonight. Dean didn’t want an excuse, nothing to blame, no lowered inhibition… just him and Cas and nothing else.
"God..." Dean groaned, dreading the thought of spending time alone with the angel. "Where even is he?"
Sam, however, was like a hawk. Anytime the three of them were together, Sam was watching them, or definitely listening while pointedly trying not to look. It was fucking weird. Sam had even asked Dean “What’s going on with you and Cas?” - Dean had mumbled something unintelligible and pretty much ran from the room. Sam didn’t ask again, and Dean wasn’t sure how much he’d clocked, but it definitely wasn’t helping.
It scared him, the thought of what it would do to Dean. He didn't see how is brother could cope after that. But right now, he had to be the strong one. He had to push Dean through this.
"Oh, it's not like you've not handed out a few threats in your time." She scoffed, taking the drink in front of her. "Thank you, dear. We both know that, if you were in my shoes, you'd be out there, guns blazing."
She looked taken aback; she hadn't expected a genuine apology from him. She had seen his memories, she had seen how it had happened, but only now was she meeting the man who committed them.
They arrived at the storage unit quickly, within half an hour of making the decision to go there. Dean almost turned the car around twice, agonising over the choice to drive further away from Cas, rather than towards him, but Sam made him keep going.
He placed the bottle on the ground and clasped his hands together. With one last look to Cas, he closed his eyes and paused a second before beginning.
Cas peered up at him, trying to sense pity or dishonesty in his words, but sensed none. Sam meant it, as best as he could tell. “What does Dean think?”
The car was ahead, but the night was clear and the creek was right there. Dean led them over to it, the bridge lit up by the moon, and they walked in silence to the wooden platform, listening to the water trickle.
“We’ll think about it.” Dean repeated with disaffected confidence, and she raised her palms in concession.
But Castiel the angel was weak. He didn't start out as the strongest angel in the garrison, and despite being a high riser, he fell, and he fell hard. The being that forced its way into Livvie's body was not the bright, shining star that it had once been, it was a feeble firefly.
She threw out her hand, and Sam shot back, shoved against the wall. For good measure she mentally pinned down his arms and legs, leaving him completely unable to remove himself from it.
“Cas?” Dean checked, like it wasn’t obvious, like he’d forgotten about him. “He’s been better lately, not been hearing him anyway. Coping with it on his own, I guess. Where is he, anyhow?”
Dean laughed, and just about saw Cas look over. "Top drawer, there's tissue in there." He told him, uselessly gesturing over to the cabinet beside the bed. He listened as Cas fumbled, wiped his face, and blew his nose for the first time.
"We thought you were dead. Dean took it hard, though he wouldn't let on." Sam shrugged. "And now you're back; I thought it would've been good for him, but he's just gotten worse."
Not to mention, Cas had a very useful skill against their current Big Bad's. Having had them rocking around in his body for a little while, he had knowledge about them, a sort of sixth sense when dealing with them. He could tell them apart with ease, and he could track them as if by scent.
“What? No, that you’ll get hurt, or worse.” Sam knelt down, gently pushing on Cas’s knee until the stretch started to burn. “We just got you back, Cas, we’re not looking to lose you again so easy.”
Sam didn't ask him if he was sure. Sam didn't try to whittle him down, try to get an answer. He knew how much it would be killing Dean that it was Sam going out on a hunt while he stayed at home, doing nothing. But they knew that Dean wouldn't leave Cas alone, not yet. And there was no way that he would put their personal issue crap in front of the job. So, this was really the only route, and they knew it.
“I wasn’t looking.” He didn’t look up, still leading through the pages. He stopped at a page, offering a low whistle.
“Oh my god, guys.” Sam’s head jutted out between them from the back. “Can you cool it for like, two minutes? We’re literally going
.” She emphasised. “Anyway, it all came to a head a few months back, when someone pretty high up in the government turned out to not human.”
Sam and Dean had been watching this from the sidelines. Dean, torn between his anger at Cas, and that annoying, gnawing sense of... joy, whilst Sam was simply unsure what to do. Finally, he spoke up.
“Eating people.” She said, face dropping. “To start with I thought it was just like a joke, or a fetish, you know, except I saw a video. This guys face just like
“They get to have a house, a family… they make it work. They have the life and don’t get run out of dodge every other week. How do they do that?”
or whatever, Dean could help with that. He would show him what had always worked for him, a crowded bar and a mass of people who would happily help Cas get off. The instant they’d stepped inside he could see it, could see people’s eyes on Cas, shoulders broad in the shirt he’d picked, ass snug in that denim. Not that Dean was looking, really, but he needed to make sure he didn’t look a shambles. But no, Cas cleaned up good.
Missouri didn't stay long. She had clients to see and an exorcism to perform, and she really couldn't do anything for Cas.
He moved backwards, scrabbling for the door handle and quickly opened it. Cold air flooded the car, and Livvie shuddered.
"Garth's dropping over, actually." Sam explained, grimacing slightly. "Tried to talk him out of it, but he's pretty persistent. Wanted to see you."
“What about Cas?” He’d asked, because he had to be sure. He would throw this to the ground if Cas wasn’t safe, would take his chances with the next black eyed bastard who reared their head.
The room shone with the effort as he gave the last of himself. He poured his power into the wound, fusing and healing it, shaking profusely.
Sam raised an eyebrow. "Only when we're too tired to bother with getting changed. Or if we know we're going to move as soon as we wake up. Denim is too tough, you need something comfortable to sleep in. Here." He pulled out the sweatpants buried at the bottom, and the soft green jumper.
Dean himself was replaying the same logic in his head that Cas was. Mentally slapping himself out of it, he straightened up. "Sorry, Man. Carry on."
If ever there had been a time for Castiel to hug Dean, it would've been then. He might've broken through to what was buried beneath the anger, he might have managed to reach across the big, gaping hole in their friendship and put a tightrope where there once had been a bridge. But he didn't. Instead, they both got distracted by Sam, who had sat up, awakened by Dean's yell.
“Just trying to make sure we don’t crash!” Dean objected, and Cas instantly scoffed, the noise catching in his throat.
Sammy, are you okay?” Dean barked out - they were still a couple of miles out, he could be there in minutes.
"Never mind. I don't know if you're listening, I don't even know if you know what's happening down here. But it's pretty bad. And I'm willing to bet that just a tiny part of you still cares about this planet. And... I know you care about Cas. You wouldn't keep bringing him back if you didn't."
He dropped the wrist like it burnt him, and it flopped off the edge of the bed, fingers trailing on the floor. That last beat, that last thrum of Dean's pulse, didn't feel like Dean's.
"CAS!" Came the yell, and he was suddenly awake, scrambling in the covers, breath coming hard and fast, sweat sticky on his back. His heartbeat too quick as he tried to focus his vision, still half lost in the blue sky and the white clouds. His vision started to darken, the sky quickly fading as he adjusted to what was actually there. Dean Winchester, a hand around his ankle like it was the first part of Cas he'd grabbed for.
But going back to the bunker right now was fucking terrifying, and he’d already established he was a coward. He needed some courage first. He groaned, beckoning Tasha forward for another measure. Just one more.
He frowned, beginning to notice something that had been left ignored until now, something that, with all of the other sensations that were new in this body, had not been forefront in his attention. Now he looked down, glaring at his crotch as he realised that blood had travelled there, causing it to swell without his bidding. He remembered this had happened before, and at that point he'd simply willed it away, not an option now. He tilted his head, unsure how to proceed. He knew the mechanics, knew the biology, but faced with an erection, he was unsure what to do, or if he wanted to.
Snatching his hand back he pulled away, curling his fingers into a fist, trying to push away the echo of the warmth that he had felt, the lingering memory of the pulse. Grabbing his duffle bag, still lying at the foot of the bed, he threw it over his shoulder, heading for the door.
"You stopped, for a minute." He explained carefully. "Dean said you stopped breathing, your heart stopped." He trailed off. Dean clearly hadn't told him. "Doesn't matter. You're breathing now, that's all that matters."
“Could shoot the lock?” Sam suggested, and Dean pulled his gun out, stepping back and trying it. Four bullets ricocheted off, no dent on the door or the handle. Dean looked closely, trying to spot an indent - nothing.
"Is that what nightmares feel like?" Cas asked quietly, and Dean sighed, shrugging slightly as he turned away, looking into the forest.
“I was just gonna have a smoothie.” Sam said, looking towards the blender, shiny and out of place in the kitchen, and Dean groaned.
The girl was silent for a moment, breathing deeply to steady herself. "You took me to a den of iniquity. You would not let me die without..." Cas trailed off, glancing uncomfortably towards Sam. "You said it was the most fun you had had in years."
“They get that a lot.” Cas said, aiming for sympathetic but the heavy tone just landed her with more confusion.
, and maybe that’s what he was offering. What if Cas wanted a relationship, a real relationship, could Dean offer that? Cas deserved better.
"Son of a bitch." Dean spat, looking up the wall as it grew higher and higher above his head the longer he walked along it. Tall as he was, he couldn't jump that.
"I mean the rack on this one girl-" He motioned with his hands across his chest, indicating that the woman was well endowed in that particular area.
Cas had seen him torturing, had seen him at his most disgusting, filthy, horrific worst. And he was still here. He still cared about Dean.
"Can be, very." Sam sighed. "Dean's using it to forget everything that's happening. He thinks that if he walks round blind drunk, it'll be easier."
They both looked at her again. She hadn't moved, but at least the slight movement of her chest moving up and down told them she was still breathing. Dean grimaced and moved towards her, while Sam grabbed the shot gun, aiming it at the girl.
"You want me around." Cas surmised. "Even though I can't heal you when you're injured, I can't teleport-" He bit out. "I'm all but useless with no grace; I'm not the same 'Cas' you've always known."
Cas could feel the cold metal of the shelves digging into his back, and under his hands where he gripped it tight behind him. He wasn’t touching Dean, he couldn’t, couldn’t, couldn’t touch, couldn’t kiss him back. He was kissing him back, lips moving against Dean-
"So, uh." He began, before feeling self conscious of Sam's eyes still trained on him. He stepped into the bathroom, closing the door behind him. "What you doing?"
Cas looked at him, amazed once more at the hunter. Each time he'd thought he understood the man, he'd find out something new, and this was no exception. Since he had returned, all he had seen of the hunter was his cold side, the front he'd put up so as nothing could hurt him again. He had feared that this is all he would ever see of him. But that moment, that admission of warmth...
Dean hadn’t been great company after that, he knew. He’d kept drinking, the excuse of needing courage withering away the further he got in. Eventually he started telling Tasha about his day, about how his friend made a deal, a good deal but one that cost way too much. About how it was a deal he could never have made because he would never be willing to give that up. He couldn’t explain it to her, the ins and outs, and he sighed, necking down the rest of the drink. And she refilled.
, had kissed his neck, and gripped him tight. He remembered the feel of Dean’s erection in his hand, the silky soft feel of his skin in his palm, gone too soon. He remembered Dean’s soul, all the times he had seen it, so enmeshed with Dean, and his smiles, and his eyes.
"Well, the vacation is over" Balthazar closed the distance, towering over the short demon. "It's time to put you back in your place."
Dean shrugged, drawing the blade of the knife across his palm, smothering the wince that came with it - this was old hat now. “I’m just gonna say it, anything this obsessed with bloodlines is just weird.”
Oh, he liked it. There it was again, that flare of arousal in his gut, the tightening in his chest, not to mention his pants. He shifted, and Dean smirked as he made a decision “I raise.”
"I've had action replay." She pondered. "If Cas was in a body with breasts, or if you just got over this macho-heterosexuality thing, would you tap that?"
“Ours then.” Dean had said, and Cas had left Dean to it. Cas certainly had no claim on this place that was rightfully Dean and Sam’s, had no right to believe that they would let him stay here for as long as he needed, to create a home here. Cas couldn’t let himself hope that. There was every likelihood that once they had dealt with Crowley, once it was moderately safe in the world again for them all, they would take advantage of this newfound base. Maybe they would want it all to themselves, maybe Dean would find someone and move her in, create a family.
? A long time ago, if he was being honest with himself. Somehow that felt gayer than finding him hot.
"It's obvious, Sam; I'll bet he's the only one who knows how to wake him up. He's the one who put him there!"
“Yeah, I know hunters are paranoid bastards.” She laughed. “Run your checks, probably the person who deleted your records can take a good look at all this, who, by the way, will have a job offer. But this is happening, with or without you. I just think it’ll be a hell of a lot better with your help.”
Dean looked up, finally, looking him in the eye. They were so, so green. “That’s the one thing that won’t ever change, Cas.”
“A bunker?” Dean asked, already mentally planning the route. That was almost a days drive away, non-stop. It didn’t sound like much, but may hold up better than a cabin. “What’s there?”
Sam chuckled, letting go of his brother, but staying close. He didn't say anything, just waited for Dean.
Dean remembered the colourful drink at the bar, the way he’d liked the flavour, and how beer had tasted bitter afterwards. He remembered the shame he’d felt at liking it, at knowing that John would have laid that whole place to waste.
"About time too." Dean panted, but his eyebrows raised when he saw the angel on the floor, visibly feeble. "What's wrong?"
At some point, Sam sat down with them, scooting Dean along to accommodate his larger frame on the couch. He too seemed to enjoy the film, smiling and joking along with Dean about what was happening.
"You are so very young, Olivia." The angel sighed. "Do you wish for so large a sin to be on your conscience?"
“Fuck!” Dean peered through the windscreen, but they were too far out, no sign of anything through the trees. “We’re 1,5 out - on the road-”
As he turned the corner of the house, he looked up, seeing that the back of the ground floor had a large balcony across it that presumably came from the kitchen. Annoyingly enough, it didn't have any steps to the garden below.
And last night he’d done it again. He tried to fuck it up, he tried to self-sabotage, hell, he even kissed that woman. But he stopped because… because he didn’t want to fuck it up. He actually didn’t. He hadn’t wanted to throw it away without it even getting a chance in the first place.
“Not much here, really. Just people and shops. Farms, if you’re into that. There’s Vista, the cinema, that’s pretty much it. You wanna hit up Philipsburg if you want something to do.”
Dean frowned, biting back the snappy comment about his morning nightmare. No need to be a dick about it. "It's a phrase." He snapped. Kirsty glanced up as she smoothed the bandage with gentle hands.
"Maybe he's finally had enough. You told him to leave, and he left." Sam told him gently, shrugging. "He might just be... done."
Castiel loved all of God's creatures. He adored humans, had sacrificed himself for them time and time again. But, perhaps, he adored Dean Winchester most. None had captured his attention quite as he.
“’Course, Poker got us into that mess in the first place. Still wonder what that witch is up to.” Dean glanced up. “Your play.”
It was still warm. He was still warm. And despite himself, despite knowing that it would do him no good, he clung to that. And even, against his better judgement, he let his fingertips trail to the crease of his wrist and rest there, pretending that his own soft pulse in his fingers was the soft pulse of Castiel's. It wasn't hope, and it wasn't happy. But just for a moment, it was enough.
Cas looked straight on, not filling the silence with words. And this worked, for about half a minute, until the blinking orange light on the dashboard became too annoying, and frankly confusing, for the angel to bear.
"He fell asleep, I had to ask." Sam told him. "He didn't know how to tell you. You didn't give him a hard time about it, did you?"
Sam scoffed out a laugh. “You tried to keep Bobby’s soul.” He reminded him, and he saw Crowley’s eyes flare in anger.
"Well, the boys aren't that dim, are they?" She smiled. She pulled out her phone from her pocket and dialled a number. After a couple of rings, it was answered.
Their lives sucked, objectively. Sure, they had bright spots, but the constant knowledge that they could, and one day would, die on the next hunt was always looming. Each time Dean had watched a friend die had hurt so much, and life had gotten a little dimmer for a while. One day he’d have to watch Cas die, or one day Cas would watch him die. It would happen, it was inevitable. He knew what it was like, he’d been there before; he wasn’t sure he’d survive the next time, drink himself into a ditch or under the teeth of something and go out bloody. And if he went first? He knew it, Cas would be so racked with guilt that he couldn’t save him, that he couldn’t heal him. It wouldn’t be Cas’s fault, but he knew it wouldn’t feel like that.
Glancing down as if only just noticing himself, he blinked. "Yes." He walked over to the cup Dean had spilt, peering at the inside. "Is there something wrong with the coffee?"
Sam paused at the fridge as he put the groceries away, glancing over at Dean as he loaded the DVD. The requested beer had been neglected, still lying untouched on the shelf. He knew it was too soon to read anything by it, only barely a day had passed since they had been placed there, but by Dean's standards...
“Well, she gave me an A+. Mr Heisner failed me, but we moved on the next week anyway. I got what I needed.”
"What happened to Jimmy?" Sam asked, and Cas looked up in surprise. "I mean, is he still in there? Is he gone?"
“Alright, alright.” Sam was laughing now, and they headed to the door together. Sam put a hand on Dean’s elbow, holding him back for a second, just before they leave. “You think he’s gonna be okay now though? With his nightmares?”
How crazy to think that Castiel, former angel of the lord, heavenly warrior and celestial being turned human was more okay with this gay stuff than him. In the grand scheme of things, after everything he’d been through, Dean guessed it didn’t register. And hadn’t he said that in the bible it had never really been in there in the first place? Hadn’t he lain siege to that Christian bookshop over that very reason? Had he known then what he wanted? He could ask Cas, but that felt too close for comfort right now.
"Maybe not you." He agreed. "But, I'm sure they have a shot at dispensing with the cattle behind you." He flashed his teeth in a grin to the angel. "And don't bother trying to zap the lot of you out; I've angel-proofed the place." He looked to the Winchesters, who had been, as subtly as possible, trying to unplug Castiel from everything connecting him to the hospital; they were lucky he wasn't tethered into life support.
"Very astute observation, however there's a bit of traffic, if you hadn't noticed." He kicked a stray corpse across the floor, getting tangled in the mass that was now there.
But, despite Sam's past, despite their fallings out and his flaws in judgement, Cas trusted the younger Winchester. Sam knew his brother, and if Sam said it was good for Cas to be around, Cas was going to stay around.
He felt the words sink in to him. Sammy knew how much power John Winchester had over Dean, still does. He doesn’t know all the specifics, but he knew enough. He never knew how Sam managed to avoid it, how he could argue with the man that Dean followed with often blind devotion. He hoped it could be that easy, just not caring, not feeling the weight of John’s judgement on him every day.
“Oh.” Dean blinked. His mind flashed back to the groan he had heard before Sam came back in, that had tripped him up but then forgot about. Cas had jerked one out in the shower.
“Of course I-” He cut himself off. How could Cas not think he cared? After everything? Doesn’t he know that he did what he did… for him? Because Cas deserves better than waiting for someone as broken and fucked up as him? Cas looked back at him, his eyes cold and hard, his jaw set in stone. The warmth in his eyes felt like years ago, like it had never happened.
“I just… just cos we’re…” Dean gestured between the two of them. “Two guys, doesn’t mean I’m going all feminine, or whatever.”
Dean slammed the door behind him, wincing at the loud thud, seeing it shake the wall slightly. This cabin was barely more reinforced than a film set. He pulled his shirt off, throwing the sodden material to the floor, wiping the moisture from his torso. Damn coffee.
“I didn’t.” Cas turned round, his eyes dark as he looked at Dean, and he felt himself inhale slightly.
"Think fast." Dean snarked, throwing the bowl at Crowley who, on instinct, reached up to catch up, eyes widening in surprise. Sam felt the demon behind him flinch, reacting briefly to the distraction and taking his chance, swung his shoulder up and dislodging the blade. Spinning round he caught the demon by the neck and forced her back against the wall, stabbing her deep in the abdomen and watched the light in her eyes flash out, the spark of life the demon had left in it leaving the sorry vessel. The brunette crumpled to the floor and Sam span away.
Cas didn't say anything for a minute, just staring at the hunter. He could see the anger in his face, the hurt. The angel didn't want to fight – he had given everything for this man, and if he needed to give a little bit more, so be it.
"Man, the stars out here, Sam." He grinned, determined on pushing away whatever the hell it was he'd been feeling before. "No light pollution. It's like that thing I took you to when you were little. Where they put the stars on the ceiling and some old guy tells you about the constellations."
Dean wondered how Sam and Garth were getting on, and he felt the gloom descend again, as briefly lifted as it had been by the prospect of the spring. Sam was out there, putting his life on the line instead of Dean. And he knew that it would keep happening until Dean told him to stop.
Dean walked down the road, his sixth sense leading him in the vague direction of alcohol. He didn't know the town, and he didn't want to stop and ask for directions, so he figured he'd just follow his feet until he stumbled across a bar.
His breath was coming harsher now, through gritted teeth, fast and hard and a choked sound left his throat, and another, and another.
"Then I'm doing what I need to." Livvie took a step closer to her. "Why should he live while my Father is dead? Why does that backstabber deserve to live?"
Cas knew that, objectively, the placement of different colour tones next to each other would contrast in a way that could draw the eye, or create optical illusions, trick the mind. Could this be done to Dean’s eyes, to Dean’s beauty? Did his eyes look greener because of some simple aesthetic trickery, could his beauty, his soul shine brighter because of some daub?
Sam supported the angel, a hand around her waist as they walked into the diner, following Dean, who had walked in first. They sat at a table by the window, in clear view of their car, and a waitress quickly gave them menus. Sam noticed her trying to flirt with Dean, but he also noticed Dean completely ignoring her. He sighed, but opened the menu.
“Take a shower, Man, warm up.” He’d told Cas as he fished through the fridge. Burgers, definitely. Sam had even got potatoes, he could make real fries with this, if the stove held out. Cas had nodded, and Dean watched as he went to the bathroom, movements stilted by the damp denim clinging to his legs.
"Oh, and that went so well." Sam thought of Lisa and Ben, safe knowing nothing of the dangers they once faced. He knew that Dean checked up on them every once in a while, though he never mentioned them.
“So essentially you’d do what Crowley tried to do.” Cas pointed out, and Dean rolled his eyes at the likening.
Cas quirked a smile, the first since yesterday. “As him being happy has brought our safety, I can’t agree. I’m sure he’ll be creative.” He pulled forwards another few slices or bacon.
Dean should have stopped hoping. By now, all and every hope that Cas would ever wake up had been crushed, repeatedly. Holding onto that last remnant that stubbornly remained would only hurt him.
“Oh.” Cas paused, realisation dawning. Dean’s mirth was delightful, the ease there. “It’s safe, Sam; we aren’t having sex.”
“Sam…” He sighed, beginning to stroll to the next stall, eyes glazing over the ceramic pots. Here goes nothing. “Unfortunately, I appear to have complicated things… by falling in love with your brother.”
Dean froze, his eyes flicking back and forth to his brother and Cas. The demon pressed in the knife a little bit, drawing blood across the thin flesh that covered Sam's throat while Crowley leant over Cas, peering at him, almost clinically. If Dean had seen the way that Crowley had examined the monsters, the alpha's, it might have brought forth parallels.
Dean had wandered on by this point, onto his third bottle of the pack. He double checked the protection sigils plastered round the house, and found his way back to Cas's room again. He was exactly as he had left him, not a muscle moved.
“This body feels… better.” He trailed fingertips along his arm, and Dean can’t help but follow the movement, watching that slow tickle. He’s pretty sure Cas isn’t being deliberately sensual, but wow. “It didn’t fit, when I first… lost my grace.” His movements halted. “Like I was pressed up against the skin, everything felt raw, sharp.”
"Yeah, I think so." Sam frowned. "Cas should be safe here, though. Rufus really proofed the place, and Bobby."
Sam chose then to look at his phone. One missed call: D. There wasn't a message, and when he tried to call his brother back there wasn't an answer.
"Demons?" Sam asked, but Balthazar didn't answer, deeming it unnecessary as black-eyed meat suits began to make their way into the room. Leading the group of at least a dozen was a surgeon, mask pulled down under his chin, blood splatters on his gown, and a scalpel in his hand.
"Yes." He said simply, glancing down at Dean. His modesty from earlier forgotten, he was half perched on the bed, a long leg stretched off, toes resting on the floor. He dragged his eyes back up, breathing slowing down as he looked at his friend. "I'm sorry for waking you." His voice was lower than usual, husky from sleep, from yelling in his nightmare, and Dean shook his head.
Dean had only been there about an hour and a half. By this time he was slumped on the bar, various whiskey glasses and beer bottles around him. He was playing with the one immediately in front of him, peeling slightly at the paper label. He then put the bottle to his lips, taking a sip.
“You’re right.” Sam said, sighing as he flicked through the pages. “Could be a way to get rid of monsters in a controlled way.”
"Go home." She shrugged. "Get into a decent bed, get some air. We got visiting hours for a reason, and it ain't always for the patient."
they are able to enter a body and leave, why they are vulnerable to holy water and exorcisms, the hierarchies. Sam had even explained the process of how a soul is corrupted, so involved in the text that he initially missed Dean’s discomfort. Cas hadn’t. He had looked over to Dean, watching as his teeth gritted as Sam described the stages of tainting a soul, the philosophy behind it… he had seen Dean’s eyes turn cold, his fists clench in his lap. He hadn’t moved, not really, each tiny step infinitesimal, but shouting clear as a bell. And Cas remembered, again, that first time they met… how he had grieved for everything Dean had gone through, everything that Sam was listing right now. And Dean had looked up, just for a second, at Cas, their eyes locking in that shared memory. “
"Okay, where'd you want it?" She asked, all warmth and reassurance. Cas looked over to Dean, who shrugged. "Having trouble deciding?" She asked, sitting down.
Dean’s eyes looked down his body, tracking the arm, before back up to Cas as he breathed back in. His eyes were wide, and his mouth was pursed in surprise. “Fuck.”
He let himself look back up to Cas. He was watching him carefully, brow furrowed in worry, and Dean reached out to soothe it, to smooth the crease away. Dude was gonna get lines soon, fresh ones, new ones, ones that were all Cas’s own. They would suit him. “I’m sorry.” He whispered between them, and Cas smiled softly.
And with no hesitation Dean leaned in, finally doing what he had denied himself for so long, what he had taken once and told himself he couldn’t have again, what he had stolen and had snatched away. He kissed Cas, their lips meeting and feeling Cas’s breath against him. He was warm under him, and there was no rushing, no urgency and no guilt. But for Dean it felt like there should be fireworks, it felt like every schmaltzy romcom he’d ever pretended he hated. His heart soared in his chest and he kissed, kissed, kissed Cas, tracing the feeling of his skin, those nerve endings alight. He reached his free hand to cup Cas’s jaw and skimmed his thumb along the stubble there and he loved it, loved… Cas’s hand moved to Dean’s back and they pressed closer together, so warm and altogether intoxicating. Not just once, never just once. Dean would do this right this time, Dean would make Cas feel so good and he would do his damn best to make him feel good for as long as he would have him. He doubted he’d ever be able to let go.
. “You’re offering to fuck him?” He finally spluttered out, and Crowley rolled his eyes at his ineptitude as Cas patiently explained. He wasn’t offering his body, not really, he was offering his
"We don't have time, Sam! We need to go, now!" Dean looked furious, twitching with anxiety and downright fear. And for a second, Sam hesitated. This was the most emotional he'd seen his brother for a long time. For so long now, Dean had been burying his emotions, deep down, too deep to find, drowning them in alcohol and sex. But now, it was finally coming out – Dean was showing the cracks, and even though this is what Sam had been waiting for, for his brother to actually show himself, to share what he was going through, it terrified him. Because he didn't know if his big brother could survive this one. This might be the one that finished him.
She sighed, looking down at the comatose man and back to Sam. "Sammy, do you want a word of advice?"
"Guess I gotta teach you how to use these, huh?" He asked, his voice a little too gruff as he flipped up the collar, fastening the last button and wrapping the material around.
Around 4am Cas finally drifted off enough to dream, not that those were generally safe havens for him. He woke up past 6, gasping as he woke, having to relearn again that he was in a bed and not plummeting the the hard ground. He looked around for Dean’s comforting presence, but he wasn’t there. Oh, right.
The smile lingered on Sam's lips after she left. He always felt smug when a woman chose to spend her attentions on him instead of his brother when given the choice; it was a fairly rare occurrence.
It was probably something to do with the fact that he hadn't jerked off in a week; there's a reason why a guy isn't meant to keep it all backed up. But things had been happening, there hadn't been much time since Cas had come back, and the scant time he had been able to snatch for himself, he hadn't exactly felt like it. And Livvie's words, the goading and the hints... well that sure as hell hadn't helped.
Dean held it closer to his face, trying to get a better look at it. "Sammy, shine your light over here, would you?"
The cogs in Dean's head started to move, he started to actually think about who he was talking to. This was Chuck, prophet of the Lord. The dude who gets the sneak preview in what comes next in the Winchester Gospels. "You've seen something, haven't you?"
Dean held the phone to his ear for a few seconds, before lowering it slowly, staring at it. His jaw was set, eyes fierce, seething.
"I got a case." Sam told him, and Dean's eyes snapped back to his brother. Oh right, a case; their job. He looked back at Cas.
Sam nodded. “Okay. But if you wanted to talk… You make Dean happy, you’re his best friend. So you being in his life, in
"Because he's probably got all sorts of inside info on the Leviathan's." Sam pointed out. "From heaven, and from being possessed by them."
“Yeah, not really.” He sighed, gritting his teeth, trying to summon up the nerve. “The thing is with you, Cas, is that you make things really difficult for me.”
“Dean, would you just-” Sam pushed forwards, jamming past him and out into the open, completely unbothered by any concept of booby traps, and
Dean blinked, his hand relaxing slightly as he sat up, looking at his brother. "You woke me up for that?"
“Yes.” Cas agreed, guilt lacing his tone. “But I’m not talking about Crowley. I mean by humanity, I’d fallen for humanity.” He turned to face Dean properly, to hold his attention. “For you. I was able to process the physical in a way I never could before. Nothing in comparison to now, but still.”
"Atta boy." Dean grinned, peeling off the film, cautious as he saw it gently sticking to the raw skin, vaguely remembering the sting of it all those years ago. Dean was being far less gentle than he had been on himself, but then, that was him. Dean couldn't say it but he knew he had to go easy on his friend.
Cas nodded his head, almost imperceptibly. He was giving him nothing. The vague script he’d drafted in his head on the way over was gone, used up. He’d expected rebuttals, or anger, but Cas was just… quiet. Like he didn’t care. Like he’d given up. He’d given up on Dean. He didn’t want to hear what he had to say, he just wanted to be left alone.
He grinned, the first thing to have gone right that day. His car conveniently parked in front of a bar.
them for- OW!” She yelled, and then breathed out, glancing down at her arm. A thin line ran across the skin, blood welling in the fractured surface. “Okay, that was a bit overdramatic. But you guys are scary.”
"Some people find it helps. Usually does." She patted him on the shoulder. "Okay, this is going to hurt, so you're going to need to relax for me." He frowned, but allowed himself to droop. "You ready?"
"So, had heaven intervened at the time, the brother's wouldn't have fought, and this whole situation might have been concluded a long time ago."
Dean’s smile slipped a little wider, and Cas saw him take a deep breath, not unlike the ones Cas had been taking minutes before. Dean stepped forwards, slowly, hesitantly, and gently stepped in for a hug. No, not a hug, just pressing his lips to Cas’s cheek, a chaste kiss, yet a kiss nonetheless. He stepped back again before Cas could do anything, and Dean rubbed the back of his neck, suddenly unable to make eye contact. He really was nervous, Cas realised, and he suddenly felt a little more in control of his own nerves. He wasn’t nervous because he was new to this, he was nervous because it was human to be.
"No, I mean," Sam back peddled. "I've got backup. I'm backup." He explained, and Dean leant back a bit, raising his eyebrows.
The girl just looked at her with panicked eyes. "Where did they go?" She whispered. "Where did my friend go?"
Dean froze, hand on the banister. Cas was still, very still, lying flat on his back, as if he had learnt to sleep from a textbook. Dean felt the chain slide from his hand slightly as his chest tightened, throat closing up slightly. He felt panic slowly work its way up as he stared.
"Dunno." He tried to remember, running a hand through his hair as he recalled, frowning slightly in concentration. "Sam chose, I think. Something about it being close to the heart. Such a girl." He chuckled, looking at Cas as the man reached out and stroked a fingertip down a yin-yang symbol. "How about your lower back?" He grinned.
Sam hesitated, but then groaned slightly, seeing what Dean was thinking. "You think he needs to get inked up?"
He trod quieter, his heavy shoes still sounding in the room, but as they rang as quietly as he could muster. He crossed the room quickly, reaching the bedside and dropping the charm on it. No way was he putting it on the guy himself. He could manage to not get jumped until morning.
.” Cas roared at him, and Dean tried to steady himself. He had, but he wasn’t now. Surely Cas could see he wasn’t now. But Cas was right, he’d said yes before and then snatched it away.
"Do you wish Cas was a woman?" Livvie asked suddenly, and Dean looked up, distracted from his ministrations.
“Yeah, and I got this scar from a wendigo two years back. I get it. But another hunter mighta killed that shifter kid. Instead now he’s with a friend, he’s in school, he’s doing good. I didn’t do it the hunter way, but I don’t know that it’s not right.”
After a second of the angel merely staring at him scornfully, he slowly turned away, looking at the compartment. He reached down and pushed the button, watched it as it opened.
“I know you did, Cas. Because I do, I do trust you. And we work better together, not apart.” Dean gritted his teeth and looked out across the water, inhaling sharply as if to psych up the courage he needed right now to get through this. He gripped Cas’s hand a little tighter; he wasn’t pulling away from Cas, he was just building his courage. So he looked back, he ignored every little voice inside telling him to shrug it off and push this away, and instead grabbed his chance with the thundering of his heart. “All I know is that I like it a hell of a lot better when you’re around. I’m
Sam could probably hear all they were discussing, the halls in this cabin were so damn thin. He shouldn't feel self conscious at the thought of Sam being able to hear a perfectly innocent conversation, but just the idea of Sam listening in... the sooner he got out of here, the better.
“No, he did everything right. He never let go of his gun, when I did.” Sam shrugged. “He needs a bit more prep with people skills, but in a fight? I think he’s up to speed.”
"Balthazar?" Sam called. The angel didn't turn round, smiting a demon with one hand and slamming his blade into the belly of another.
He took his mouth away, breathing in deep again, before repeating the action, watching Cas's chest. Obediently it rose.
As Sam had expected, Cas flinched at the touch, jerking out of the loose grip and bouncing in the bed as he scrambled away, almost falling from the bed in a need to get out. Dean jumped back at the movement, and Sam spared a look at him. He looked like he'd been slapped.
Sam appeared, splashing water in her face, and she shrieked again, but only from surprise, rather than pain. “What the-” She paused. “I was expecting Borax.”
One of the problems about sleep is that once you get some, your body just wants more and more of it. Sam and Dean who routinely live on less than 4 hours sleep a night, are absolutely capable of staying awake, researching for hours on end, spending long nights in the car on stake outs. Cas, however, in a body that, before a few years ago, was used to a healthy dose of 8 hours a night, and had been comatose for the best part of a week, was wilting.
Cas stood stiffly, unable to slouch back against the car as Dean was, not with his back in this much pain. He sighed, turning his attention to the street as Dean pulled out his phone, hearing him greet Sam. As his gaze slid past the tattoo parlour and betting shops, the off license and the polish grocery store, he found himself struck by the Christian bookshop a few doors down. Pale and unassuming, with bibles lining the shop front, crucifixes and the simple fishes that the early Christians had used to signify their allegiance, Castiel felt the instant tug of the familiar.
He turned to Sam, letting go of the unresponsive hand. "What's all that?" He asked, not trying to hide the disinterest in his voice.
When he reached his room he started pulling items from his bag. He tried to check them, see what was clean and what was dirty, but he ended up throwing them all on the floor. What was the point, put them all through the wash, they were in the same bag.
They spent the next couple of hours researching. Or, at least, trying to. Dean was so agitated by the prospect of a chance that he couldn't sit still, until Sam snapped at him to sit down at shut up; she'd get there when she got there.
"I did." Cas said softly, hints of confusion, and just a bit of pride in his voice. "Though I do not understand the humour."
"I might be giving you a sponge bath right now, but it's not anything I was worrying about." He caught Cas's confused eyes in the mirror. "Was just curious. About why you were so angry about it." Dean clamped his mouth shut, aware he was babbling. He looked away, attempting to focus again on the tattoo, pressing a bit too hard with the rough cloth, not saying anything about Cas's small flinch.
“Oh.” He thought back over their interactions, the first conversation they’d had. “Is that why you appreciated the destruction of the Westboro Baptist Church?”
"Yeah, you are!" Dean yelled. "You used to be my friend, you used to be someone I trusted." He sighed. "But now you're just someone who keeps things from me."
“With what? Crowley’s got hoards of Demons on his side. We haven’t even got time to regroup. And with Cas-”
As his confidence grew, he climbed faster, though regretted it pretty soon when the ivy in his hand gave way and his foot below slid.
Dean pulled out the picture from his pocket, smoothing it out before he gave it to her. "That's going on Cas." He explained, watching her carefully as she looked it over.
“Maybe, maybe not. Sometimes people just don’t wanna be helpful, but you can always slip ‘em some cash, especially civilians.” He heard Dean sigh, a rush of static over the phone, and he had a vision of Dean pinching the bridge of his nose, holding the phone close to his ear as he found his words. “I’m sorry for not trusting you earlier.”
Despite being in such a hurry earlier, they stepped in slowly, almost reverently, switching on flashlights that they had grabbed to light their way.
A man came out of the backroom at this point, and the cashier hastened to explain the situation to him.
"No, not really." Sam admitted, throwing his brother a cushion from the bed. Dean blushed slightly as he realised what it was for and placed it over his crotch. Neither of them made a fuss of it; they'd been sharing the same rooms for most of their lives, and they'd seen a lot worse of each other than a simple case of morning wood.
“I’m saying yes, now!” He got out around the guilt that had smashed into his chest, but Cas was shaking his head. Dean had fucked up so many times, and each time he’d tried to fix it he’d made it worse. By giving him a little and snatching it away he hadn’t helped. Cas didn’t trust him, and why should he?
"It's just..." He sighed, not knowing what to say. How on earth could he put what he felt into words. How could he be capable of that. He opened his eyes, looking to Cas. He knew what Cas would say. Whoever was listening would get it. They'd get what he was trying to say, what he couldn't. They'd get what words wouldn't put together.
Dean turned, two steps ahead of Cas as he moved forward, one hand holding the gun steady and the other reaching for his blade.
He kicked open the bathroom door and went back into the restaurant, resolve sealed. They would get the damned angel his vessel back, they would put him in their rear-view mirror, and get back to cleaning up his mess.
“Okay.” Dean sighed, and he felt a rush a warmth come over him. He smiled, moving forwards to kiss Cas, and he felt Cas smile against him, felt him being tugged closer brought in to Cas’s naked body. It felt good. Safe.
And it worked, to a certain extent. Between the three of them they were killing a lot of demons, and none would make it past the three of them to the comatose man on the bed, but more kept coming, with apparently no end in sight. With the near constant flood, they couldn't even move from the room, could make no form of advance through the narrow door.
"Oh, of course." She cried, moving away from Cas and turning back to the boys. She took a step back, reaching the metal gate, stroking it with her fingertips. "I'm just an abomination, aren't I?"
Dean swallowed, and disentangled himself from her, turning around and standing by the window. "Don't worry about us, it's Cas you're here for."
And she saw. By God, did she see. She saw heaven and hell, and all in between. She saw everything about the Winchesters. And she saw her Father. She saw how he died. And she saw who was responsible.
There weren't many people listed in there. They changed phones so often it was hard to keep track. And he rarely scrolled through the names; usually just typing worked faster.
When they woke up in the morning it was all still there, all of it. It hadn’t been a stress dream cooked up while they took turns napping in the car, or a djinn situation (that they know of, how could they ever really rule that out), or a vivid daydream. They woke up in their
He knew the drill. He knew what to do. He and Sam had faced death a hundred times before, had buried countless friends. This was no different. He would wrap him up in a sheet, he would build a pyre, and he would pour salt and holy water on him and watch him burn.
“You set us up good.” Dean told her, eyes soft as he smiled down at her. Cas thought he might be able to see it now, how Dean looked at her. There was no heat there; there was affection and love, but anything romantic seemed far-fetched. Dean had even said she was like a little sister to him. “You gonna be okay?”
"Makes sense, doesn't it?" The smaller hunter smiled, sending Sam a wink. "Easy pickings on hikers, plus they totally rig the parking meter over here."
"Where did you get that?" Castiel asked in awe as Dean rushed over, throwing his jacket onto the flames long enough for them to be dampened so that Cas could cross over.
Dean winced. "God, I hope not." He took another slurp. "Lighten up. We're doing him a favour here, least he can do is shout me a drink."
Cas laughed, and Dean’s eyes lit up at the sound. “Yes, I am nervous.” Cas answered, and Dean’s face softened slightly. “Are you?”
"In the fight. Few years back, we couldn't've handled a fight that big." Dean told him as he finished the final stitch. "Even with the help of some heavenly host."
Cas frowned, not in the mood to try and decipher Dean's wording. The hunter, sensing Cas's mood, shrugged, rolling his eyes.
“Should be close.” Cas said, peering around. “I think… there!” He pointed in the trees, and they both had a second of wariness before seeing the figure hurrying towards them was Sam.
Dean’s chest tightened, and he flipped his hand over, gripping Cas’s hand tight. “And do you trust me now, Cas? To know what I want?”
Something was telling him that Cas was going to go veggie… and Dean was going to try to slow that day down every chance he could. He was going to have to learn how to cook tofu, wasn’t he. He didn’t even know what tofu was, for fucks sake.
"Did you hear me asking you to stop?" The angel said kindly. Livvie finally looked at her, confused by the passivity in the angels tone. "It is you who seems to be unhappy at the circumstance."
Sam was waiting for him, and they were getting close to the wire, so he tore himself away, walking over to the restaurant to catch Sam up.
Dean gritted his jaw. It ached, and Dean tried hard not to think about why. "I think we've had everything taken from us already. If Cas knows about it you think Crowley doesn't?"
Dean got used to Cas leaving the bunker, after the third time outside letting him go solo, knowing his was armed. Cas was grateful for this; initially he’d understood, he’d accepted the brothers caution, that their assessment of the danger was accurate, that he should be careful, that he was still learning. It stung to think this, this constant reminder that he was weak now, but his body was getting stronger, his human senses less agonisingly acute, less overwhelming, and fundamentally meaning he could now
, Dean realised. Cas was talking about him. He was really saying that he didn’t care what every angel and demon, every human and monster thought about him. All he cared about was what Dean thought of him. Despite everything.
A woman's voice greeted him, and he blearily looked up. He groaned and automatically reached behind him, grabbing for his gun. She grabbed his arm, her sober strength a little overpowering against his swaying drunkness.
“Yeah, I get it, Cas.” Dean snapped, grabbing an apple off a stall for something to do with his hands. He stared down at it, the crisp skin.
There was a Celtic rock that when placed in the mouth could cure the person of any poison. But Cas hadn't been poisoned.
Looking closer at the board, Cas didn't turn round this time. "How did you and Sam choose where to put yours?"
“So what happened, how’d the hunt go?” He took a sip, ignoring how it burnt his lips. They felt raw. “You’re both still alive, so good?”
“So. We’re doing this.” Dean summed up, smirking at Cas and cocking an eyebrow in a way that he just knew would get a rise out of him. Dean knew he wore that look well, and he saw Cas narrow his eyes, knowing he’d caught it. It was his old reliable move, calling people’s bluff, pushing a button and seeing how they reacted. Right now though, it was an invitation.
"Talk about what?" Dean asked, disinterested. He stumbled up and walked doggedly to the tap, getting a glass of water.
“Yeah, he’s right here.” Sam snapped his fingers to get Cas’s attention, chucking the phone over to him.
"Should we..." He began, eyes looking back to Dean, and, he noticed, Dean's eyes flitting back to his own a split second later. "Should we go back to sleep?"
"I've been a complete..." Dean's voie trailed off as he moved his hand from Cas's shoulder to the back of his neck, gripping slightly, and before he knew it, he had leant in, closer than Cas had ever breached Dean's personal space, and lips met lips.
Dean hollowed out his cheeks and sucked, pressure around Cas, and he clung on tighter. He wanted Cas around him, surrounding him, he couldn’t get enough of him. He grabbed his ass, digging his nails in and squeezing, feeling the muscle tense under his grip and he started to move up and down Cas’s shaft, not pulling off completely yet, getting further down every time. His hand moved up Cas’s shirt, feeling the muscles of his back, the tense abs hidden under skin, reaching up to find a nipple and brushing against and feeling Cas jump again, heard him lose a sharp “
Dean grinned, pulling a large pink carcass from a bag, hefting it onto the metal counters with glee. “And now I can.” His eyes were warm when he looked at Cas, grateful, if a little hesitant. Cas nodded at him, not saying more.
“It’s fine.” Cas asked. He stood up, grabbing one of the revolvers and started pulling it apart to clean it, despite the fact that it was only done recently. He found the process soothing.
They got back into the car, leaving the diner quickly after Castiel had a vicious coughing attack, spitting blood into the food. They all seemed to lose their appetite after that, but at least they managed to get a free meal.
He knew what the end game was. He and Cas in bed together, happy, several orgasms in. And, if he was lucky, lasting longer than that, him and Cas carry it on, sharing a bed together, both of them being safe in the knowledge that for the rest of whatever time they had, they’d be together. If Cas wanted that.
She reached out to Dean and grabbed his neck, pushing him against the bookcase. Cas looked around frantically, seeing Dean had dropped his poker. He tried to frantically remember where he had put his own, realising he must have dropped it somewhere in the house. Stepping forward he grabbed at the ghost, but his grip had no effect; there was a reason you don't pick a fist fight with a spirit.
Sam looked up after a while noticing the near complete silence that they had been sitting in for the best part of quarter of an hour.
"I need you to tell me if someone's been here. She's about twenty, light brown hair... probably wearing a black jacket. Goes by Olivia."
She opened her mouth to answer, but noticed a change. Cas's stance had shifted, his eyes wandered; he was altogether distracted.
"What, me?" Dean scoffed. "You're trying to set me up. She hot? Because if I'm going to get her killed, she better be hot."
“How was your first hunt, Cas?” He asked quietly, prompting him to speak, and Cas blinked, shaking himself out of whatever trance he’d been in, glancing self-consciously at Sam, at Charlie, but all of a sudden avoiding looking at Dean.
applies to your organs, Dean.” Sam shifted the logs with a poker, trying to get the new one to catch instead of smothering the whole thing. “Just, like,
“Another.” He gestured to the bartender, an empty glass in front of him. The world was his oyster tonight. He hadn’t really seen much of what this town had to offer, but this bar was a damn good start. The chicks in this town were fine too.
And that she thought Dean was harbouring latent homosexual urges to the comatose man in the bed? That was a theory that Sam certainly couldn't deny, not after what he'd seen Dean doing the day before.
"Because we've all screwed up, big time, at one point or another." Sam reminded. "He kick started the apocalypse, I jumped it into overdrive. You became God to stop a worse one." Sam sighed. "We all had the best of intentions."
A shriek, high and piercing, and Cas glanced back to ensure the destruction of the journal was working. He saw her form smothered in flames, her gnarled fingers clutching at her clothes, her hair as it caught. The shriek got higher and the shrillness surprised Cas, piercing his eardrums as he covered them with his hands, grimacing away from her until she was gone, burnt out, replete. He sighed, watching as the journal continued smouldering, flames licking at the pages, and he glanced back up at the rafters, remembering Sam’s words. He stomped on the book, smothering the fire until it was done.
Sighing again, he let himself look up once more at the man in the bed. Now closer up, he could see him in full detail, the slow in and out of his chest as he breathed, the slight hushed whisper of air. From here he could see that Cas wasn't lying completely flat, but that his head was tilted slightly to the right.
Dean knew gays could look like that, he knew they weren’t all small weedy guys with long eyelashes and plump lips, or skeevy old guys, he knew that. He knew that what he’d known when he was a teenager wasn’t the full picture, but damn… every person here was so different, and so, so similar.
They drove for fifteen minutes, Sam and Dean up front, Cas in the backseat. Unsurprisingly, the town was not unlike the last, with the slight change of the motel being on the high street instead of a walk away. But the motel was pretty much identical, though that wasn't saying much.
It didn’t go well. Sam had to actually duck out of the way. And Cas almost threw up afterwards, sitting on a log for a few minutes before feeling strong enough to get back up. Dean felt bad about that one.
“It’s fine. I’d lost my V-Card to Shirley Lester a couple years before anyway, so…” Like that had been the point.
"Dean!" Sam barked, and Dean flashed back to the present, shifting his legs under the table and turning to him.
Sam woke up at about six, launching into protective mode instantly when he sensed there was a foreign presence in the room. He reached for the gun in the waistband of his jeans, but calmed down when he realised it was just a nurse.
was a disappointment, but ultimately not a surprise for Cas. It was probably for the best, he knew. And so he trained, his body getting stronger and stronger, and he got more confident in his abilities, on several occasions sparring both the brothers away simultaneously. And yet, when the second hunt arrived that required their attention, Dean instantly barked
Castiel looked uncomfortable again, and the brothers simultaneously raised their eyebrows. He had always come across as completely indifferent to sex.
She tensed, and turned away, aware that those feeling she had been trying to quell had just visibly surfaced. She forced them down.
“Or just kill us to get rid of the lead.” Dean suggested, but he figured this was getting into the realms of crazy. Which, to be fair, was what they usually dealt with.
He saw a door leading out and shoved it open, finding himself in a small garden designed to cheer up the patients and visitors, but was clearly just used as a smoking area. But the fresh air felt good, and he frantically went through, scrambling as he went, until he dropped to the floor, cramming himself into a corner and put his hands over his head, and his head to his knees.
Cas glanced up at Sam, trying to keep his face impassive. Fine was putting it kindly, he knew. He watched Sam put people at ease, and recognised that each time he spoke he was met with confusion. He was getting it wrong and he didn’t even know how.
Sam entered the room, and the elder Winchester snapped back, swallowing hard, turning to look at his brother.
"Dean." He croaked, and the hunter turned round, almost unbalanced under the influence of alcohol. Cas could see the red in his cheeks from the liquor, and wondered briefly if this was to be a repeat of the night before.
Dean cleared his throat, and his two companions looked up at him, expectantly. He raised his eyebrows, putting down the newspaper as if he'd planned it all along. "Alright. Get dressed," He looked over to Cas, who was looking up from
“Yeah, I don’t think organisation was high on Sammy’s list of priorities. We probably lost some crap, we’ll hit some more shops when it’s safe.” He gestured to a similar pile on the bed. “Some of yours.”
Dean frowned. "Shut up." He muttered angrily, leaning back into her lips, his hands now moving down to her waist, tugging her forward and off of the stool. She giggled as she landed on the floor, falling into his chest, her hands catching on his shirt and clinging on.
"No, but you need something to sleep in." Sam shrugged. "Doubt Dean will want to bunk with you if you're sleeping naked." Sam smirked, and Cas glanced up. There was that smile again.
“Deal.” Crowley spoke finally, and it was done. They were safe. Cas… Cas was safe. Safe from Crowley’s threats, his life was safe. His reputation… was another matter. How could Cas just throw that away?
A noise rang deep from within the door, inside the mechanisms within. It whirred lowly, and everyone instinctively took a step closer, listening to each notch and pulley and winch. Sam drew his gun.
"I don't have to go if you need me here." Sam told him, taking a step forwards, ducking his chin and hunching down slightly, bringing himself down to Dean's height. "Garth knows other hunters who can back him up."
“I know we did this a while back, or tried to, anyway, but maybe that didn’t work cos of, you know,” Dean rambled, and Cas frowned, struggling to follow. He glanced outside now, seeing Dean had finally selected a parking space, sweeping into it. “Cos you were an angel, I guess, or cos I took you to a chick? Anyway, you weren’t into it then. But if you’re up for it now?”
, the warm pressure exquisite around himself and his toes curled as he felt himself fill out, get larger in his hand. He watched with fascination as he moved his hand up and down, the sensation of the movement curious against the visual, until his eyes rolled close and his lips parted, a low groan rumbling in his chest. He paused, aware of the thin walls, and pressed his lips back together. This wasn’t an opportunity to explore himself and the sensations, this was to deal with a
Cas sighed in regret, thinking back to Zachariah informing him dryly, like the information was of no more significance or importance than the green of Dean’s eyes. “Yes.”
Dean’s excitement reached fresh peaks when the followed the hallway along, finding bedrooms in the first direction he picked. Some had multiple beds, clearly an overflow dorm for backup, but there were several comfortable solo rooms. Dean’s face had lit up, disbelief shining for a minute as he looked around it, looking at the bed, the walls, the dressers. He checked, there were plenty of rooms, more than enough for one each for the all of them. “My own room.” Dean had murmured, freezing for a minute as he took it in. He hadn’t realised Cas had been near, shaking himself off.
The hunter hesitated briefly, looking at the doubled over angel, but as he quickly straightened up, his face betraying no more pain, he quickly went back to his anger.
“Dean…” Sam softly interjected, placing a hand against his collar, blocking any move he might take towards Cas.
"What the-" Dean bean, but got distracted as the light levels in the room grew to blinding levels. They shielded their eyes, aware of what angels light could do.
Dean had made it clear that he and Cas were friends, nothing more. Cas had rescinded that hope that he had kindled for a brief moment, yet he still found his heart sinking as he thought of Dean and Charlie, the inevitability that Dean would find someone else, someone female who he felt free with, suddenly staring him down. Dean now had a home, could create a life, a family, he deserved that.
"You know the cleaner wouldn't mind." Dean winked, remembering the previous morning when the middle aged employee had slipped her number to him.
And they did, Dean patiently explaining the different hands, that Aces are high, the difference between a Full House and a Flush. They played open handed, showing each other their cards, and Dean smiled when Cas suggested Dean’s next move. When Dean reached over to pull a card from Cas’s hand and swap another one in Cas smiled too, their fingers brushing, a tingle sweeping over him.
It had been a few minutes since she had started, and Cas was already sweating, teeth gritted against the pain. He hadn't said anything, ignoring Kirsty as she made small talk with Dean, failing to do so with Cas himself. He found himself staring hard at the yin-yang symbol on the wall, gripping tightly onto the armrests of the seat.
"You want a bedtime story too?" He cranked the smile back on his face, happiness not faded, the fact that Cas was there, with him, good enough. "Night, Cas." He kicked a foot out, tapping Cas gently on the back of the knee. He stumbled slightly, surprised by the jolt. "You're making me miss the film."
"Um..." Dean knelt, face level with hers, and gingerly shook her shoulder. He berated himself for being so scared of this seemingly harmless girl, when he barely flinched at things that were actually terrifying. "Lady? Wake up."
"I dunno," Dean shrugged, running his hand along the shelves. "Isn't there some funky angel power that means you can just... find something?" He squatted, looking at the lower shelves. "It'd make the job a hell of a lot quicker."
"You'll catch a cold if you stay there much longer." A voice behind him softly announced. Cas didn't look round, he didn't have to. He'd know that voice anywhere.
But Dean had said he was thinking about it. Cas was trying not to linger on it. It seemed unlikely that Dean would want to do this, and Cas suspected if he were to say yes it would come, yet again, from a place of wanting to fulfil Cas’s needs, rather than heeding his own. Cas couldn’t let himself consider that Dean might actually want this too, not after last time. But Dean said he was thinking about it. Thinking about them. There it was again… the hope that was too much to hope for.
There it was. No uncertain terms, no crossed wires, just honesty, truth. A statement of intent. “Yes.” Dean tells him simply. “You in?”
Dean eventually woke up, the dim light from the window hurting his eyes even when they were closed. He complained incoherently, but no-one replied.
So lost in what was happening, the men had failed to notice Dean's blood, or more specifically, where it was going. Livvie had oiled a pattern onto the floor, which the blood flowed freely into and filled it out.
"At Cas?" Sam asked. Dean nodded slightly. "Because... look at him, man; don't you think he's been punished enough?"
“Yeah. To be honest… it’s about time.” Sam laughed a little, and Dean blinked at his words. “I’ve been fed up of you guys dancing around each other. It’s really annoying.”
And annoyance sparked in Cas. Not new, he’d felt it often as an Angel, despite it being such a human emotion; anger was for angels, but annoyance… human. But here it was again, that same annoyance, with the same target as it so often was at, at Dean, at himself. He was
"And did you bury her?" Dean asked, perhaps a little too abruptly, and the old man looked a little surprised.
"You aren't going cold turkey." She smiled. "Your grace will dwindle, you still have a little left to use, but it shall run dry."
Sure, this wasn’t Dean’s usual type of place, but what’s one club to the next? He feigned comfort and ease that he didn’t quite feel, trying to make it look as easy and natural for Cas as possible - one of them had to be the expert here. And it wasn’t so bad, sure his ass got groped more than once, but everyone had been plenty respectful of his no, of him saying he was here with a friend. The guy at the bar who’d tried to buy them a drink was nice too, beefy, large, with a twinkle in his eye, and he reminded Dean of a hundred hunters he’d met before. Hell, the guy might even have been a hunter, he sure looked the part.
"Right. Clothes." Dean agreed, not looking back to Cas. He didn't need to see any more of the practically naked man, wet and dripping... "I'll go get some."
Cas sat alone on the bench, deep in thought as he watched time tick slowly by. He had been out there for hours, ever since Dean had returned home, though after the boys had fallen asleep he had returned and placed water and painkillers beside Dean – he remembered when Dean had shown him that kindness, a very long time ago.
Light. The room pulsed, thrumming as long forgotten bulbs warms up, filaments sparking and warming and breathing to life around the room. Dean flicked the second lever and it got brighter, and the sound felt full, like engines.
Sam smiled, shaking his head at his friend. "Yeah, pretty easy." He chuckled, pulling the packet of dried pasta from the cupboard. Cas nodded, understanding, before looking down at the carrots in front of him. "Start chopping." Sam prompted. He opened the fridge briefly, taking out a packet of minced beef and pouring it into the pot. The smell of frying meat quickly filled the area. Sam placed an onion in front of himself, chopping it deftly through the middle.
Crowley smiled, teeth and eyes twinkling as he took in the prospect. Cas had guessed well, had gotten to know him a little in their time together. “This could work.”
“Yes.” Cas said turning away to sit down. Dean breathed out, not realising he’d been holding it in, but seeing Cas standing down settled him. He pocketed his gun, and Sam followed suit, and Charlie visibly sagged.
"Yeah, yeah." He heaved himself to his feet, clapping a hand on Sammy's shoulder as he walked past him, heading for the bathroom. Dean somehow managed to turn this simple two minute task into ten minutes, dawdling in the bathroom for far too long. He stayed until Sam pounded on the door like a grouchy teenager demanding his turn, and Dean spat out the paste, reluctantly climbing the stairs.
“Hey, Cas.” Dean spoke lowly, softly, his voice a little gruff as Cas approached the car. He saw Dean track his eyes over his outfit, and he smiled. A success, then.
The grounds were as unexpectedly vast as the house was, and, unfortunately, sunk at the back. It made room for another floor underneath the ground floor, and made the kitchen now way above him.
After two days in the hospital, Dean had to make a very quick run to the car to smuggle in some whiskey. Despite the difficulty he had in tearing himself away, the second he got outside the need to run hit him. He itched to leave, to drive far away, leave all this behind; his brother and his angel, leave everything behind that was too much for the emotionally stunted hunter to deal with. But despite his urge to run, the urge to run back was stronger, to return to the bedside of his friend to wait for something that may never come.
"It can sometimes feel that way." Dean sympathised. He looked absently at the thermostat on the wall, tapping it intellectually, but doing nothing.
He’d been in crowds before as an angel, could smell each individual human, but it had never been like this. He had never been so acutely one of them. Abstractly this setting, this feeling of heat and sweat and debauchery reminded him of years ago, the heat and pressure and throng of the pit, of fighting his way through and feeling vicious hands grab at him as he passed.
"Well, then what?" Dean replied grumpily. He didn't really appreciate being woken up unnecessarily, even if he had gotten an inordinate amount of sleep. And the dreams last night weren't even that bad, more so a confusing, guilt ridden mess of memories, of Cas. He craned his neck round, checking the sleeping body in the bed. He could still see his chest moving up and down slowly, still breathing.
“Dean asked me on a date and I don’t know what to wear.” He explained, the words fast as he tried to figure out how to switch cameras.
He felt Dean try to shift underneath him, move his legs to knock Cas off balance, but he compensated, and Dean stayed firm. Dean huffed out a breath and Cas could feel it across his lips.
Dean digested the words, and he could see what Sam meant. He’s been surprised by Lisa’s neighbours, Greg and Joe, but no one had blinked an eye about it. And on TV he saw, he’d see happy couples, or unhappy couples, but he’d see them. He hadn’t looked too closely at first, he’d just nodded along, but it was just another in a long set of things he hadn’t realised about the normal world. People were gay, or whatever, and everyone got over it.
But it was a no. That wasn’t something he wanted, he knew that. Sure, Cas was a, what was it… a wave of multi-dimensional energy that just so happened to be housed in a body with a dick? But Dean just couldn’t go there. Cas was gonna have to find another way to get his rocks off.
Sam had laughed good naturedly as he rooted around the cupboards, finding old tins that would either still be good or they wouldn’t.
Sam showered quickly, aware of how fast hot water could run out in cheap motels. Despite everything they'd been through, the slings and arrows shot at them, the painful torture and all the broken bones, Sam still hated it when the water ran cold. It was the little things, he guessed.
"Oh, bully for you, Castiel is back." The girl sarcastically proclaimed. "Hugs all round?" She raised her arms furiously. Dean noticed with a wry smile that she had an English accent, something that hadn't been noticeable whilst Castiel had been inside her.
What followed in the next few seconds was the brothers silently discussing their options. It seemed a little suspect for an FBI agent to get in contact with them just a week after their FBI records were wiped. She was a fed now, and that didn’t exactly fill them with confidence. But she did cover for them, and probably caught shit for it. “We’re in Kansas. Why, you need some help?”
He could retract his statement of intent, could ‘let Dean off the hook’, to use a human phrase. He could tell him that he didn’t mean it, that he had simply been sexually frustrated and intrigued. Or he could tell him that he’d changed his mind, that he had rescinded his offer, he no longer wanted this with Dean. He could lie. Perhaps it would be easier. But it unsettled him, knowing how deep that lie would be, and frankly he was unsure of his own acting abilities with regards to a matter so human. He didn’t think he could sell it, no matter how motivated he might be.
"I'm quaking in my boots." She giggled down the phone. "I didn't realise you cared so much for the little angel. Whatever." He could almost hear her shrug. "Didn't you wonder why I called you? Why I didn't just kill him to be done with it?"
Dean’s mouth dropped open and he adjusted himself in his chair. He squeezed his eyes shut for a second. “Shit, Cas, I’m really not used to this.”
Sam halted, putting a hand on his brothers shoulder and swinging him around, halting him. "Balthazar? Are you kidding me?"
The cabin was quiet, Sam and Cas must have still been out for their morning run. He threw on his clothes, tidying up his side of the room real quick (seriously, who would’ve taken an angel of the lord for such a slob) and headed downstairs, sticking a pot of coffee on while he brushed his teeth. He even scrambled up the last of the eggs, a meal Sammy couldn’t complain about and would do them both good after their run. By the time they returned he was just wolfing down his portion, scraping the dregs into his mouth. He greeted them both with a wide smile, mouth full of egg.
He felt the knee-jerk defensive reaction rise. Those words would be so easy to read as mocking, making a joke about it. But it wasn’t a joke, this wasn’t. And Sam somehow knew it. “Would that be okay?”
“A catch? Obviously.” She finished with a grin, and Dean chuckled with her, weirdly a little nervous. “Or gay?” She asked, and Dean was surprised, though wasn’t sure why, at the freeness with which she said the words. “Yup. You hadn’t clocked that?”
But Cas had smiled. Soft, free, easy in a way expressions rarely were on Cas’s face… he was really learning. And a huge part of Dean wanted to lean in right there, kiss him not with passion and heat but with kindness, with deliberateness and certainty. Right there in front of all those people he wanted to wrap his arms around Cas and tell him without words how much he wanted to make him feel loved.
“Not as a human.” Sam pointed out from a few meters away. Sam was fearsome in a fight, he knew that. He was aware how much taller this human was than him now, how much taller he had always been than his vessel. Sure, before he had been the size of the Chrysler building, crammed into the just-shy of 6ft body, but now this was it. 5 Feet and 11 inches, no higher.
Dean looked at him again, where their hands were touching, and Cas’s careful study, so fixated on Dean. Dean felt his own discomfort, the urge to grab his hand back, to shy away. It would be so easy, so much safer; he fought monsters on the daily but holding hands with a guy, being… cherished… by a man? That was really fucking scary. Dean realised all of a sudden again how right Cas had been to refuse him, to force Dean into thinking about this, about what he wanted and what he was really scared of. Because a month ago Dean would’ve shoved him away, given into that fear. Now?
The door of the cabin banged open, startling them both as they turned to look at Sam carrying two six packs in, kicking the door shut behind him. The giant of a man banged the two six packs down on the counter, shucking off his jacket and complaining about the cold, the damp, how slow he has to drive the half mile to the Gas-n-Sip down the road. He was all noise and bluster, his presence taking up the whole cabin in the instant he arrived, popping this bubble that Cas didn’t realise they’d created.
“Not all of hell, just those loyal to Crowley.” Cas reminded. And so this went on, as this had before, still no closer to a solution. They crossed the marker to Kansas, and Cas switched back to the map, trying to plot a route to a door in Lebanon. It still took them another couple of hours after that, passing through town after town and not stopping, reaching the outskirts of Lebanon and pulling to a stop.
“I had just raised you from hell, I was expecting more gratitude.” Cas turned his body infinitesimally towards Dean, and he found himself mirroring him.
Cas had settled into the chair by this point, or as settled as he was ever going to get. It reminded him of stolen trips to the dentist that Dean had taken Sam to when they were younger; they may have been freaks on the fringes of society, but there was no way his little brother was going to grow up with buck-teeth. Even if there was a good chance that those teeth might later get knocked loose in a fight.
Her arm was grabbed by Castiel, her sleeve pushed up, and Sam poured cleaning fluid on her arm. No blisters. “That was Borax.” Dean told her, and she sighed.
Cas wondered at his words, playing the weight of them in his mind. Sam had said that just by being here he was making Dean worse, but somehow this was good? He considered that, perhaps, it would be best to leave, to stop imposing himself on the boys, on Dean; that perhaps the healing process for them would be far easier without him around. They were not the friends that they once had been for a very long time, and though the hunter meant more than heaven to him, he recognised that this feeling may not be returned.
He told her about his best friend, Castiel. He told her about the adventures that they had had together. He told her that of all the angels in heaven, he trusted him the most, and that if she ever needed something that her father was not around to give, Castiel could be the only one that might give her a chance.
“Cas would beat your ass at risk,” He told her, reaching for his beer. “He used to be a battle strategist for heaven.”
"CASTIEL, YOU BASTARD!" The girl yelled, and both Dean and Sam turned to look at her. She had risen off the rock, and, panting heavily, was screeching angrily at the water. "I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!"
Dean didn’t know what Sam wanted to talk to Mary about, it wasn’t really any of his business. If Sam wanted to trade secrets with a gravestone that was up to him. He knew where Mom was and she wasn’t there.
“A date.” Cas repeated, containing the sigh in him as he looked down at the potato planter. He stood up, adjusting its position slightly to catch the right amount of light from the window. “Where is Dean taking you?”
"Hey." Dean barked, finally succeeding in getting his attention. He swallowed, finding himself under the fire of Cas's glare. "Can you go in there and grab a tape?"
Dean looked at his brother, watching how easily he was able to make contact. He felt a surge of... something, inside him. Jealousy? Anger?
Dean raised his eyebrows. "Of course." He turned to smile at Bill, and went back to faux studying the thermostat. "So how long ago did your first wife die?"
Eventually bruised and bloody, and Garth with a minor puncture wound or two, the job was finished. Eight decapitated vampires lay around them, and the room was basically a blood bath. The smaller hunter picked himself from the floor, and grinned up and Sam.
Dean didn't know what to say. He didn't know how to react. He didn't know what to do. He just sat there, unmoving.
"Really? You think I hadn't noticed that?" Dean retorted. He ran his hand through his hair, looking around in the vain hope that the angel may have appeared without him noticing. "He does that. He doesn't always come when we call."
"Hello." He spoke softly, trailing a finger gently along the display of bibles, many with different covers. It was a far cry from how it had looked whilst it was being written down. For a moment, he was happy in amongst the serene nature of the shop, the peaceful reverence of Christian iconography.
"No, we can't." Sam sighed. He put down the pen for a second, readying himself for what he had to say. "Bobby died, Cas; a Leviathan shot him."
"You get that now that he's not in a coma, watching him sleep is just plain creepy, right?" Sam called up from the bottom of the stairs.
“Well-” Dean got out, and he suddenly looked small, somehow. He was hunkered in on himself, and Cas could see the shame radiating off him. He watched as Dean forced himself to look at Cas. “I’m saying yes, now.”
He could hear Dean’s tone shift, even if he couldn’t hear the words. Dean sounded happier, could hear a laugh even. Dean and Charlie had clicked fast, similar in many ways, and her manner put Dean at ease. He had watched them laugh, getting to know each other, had seen the easy way they had physically interacted with each other in a way that was never easy between the two of them. She made him happy, he could see that.
She sighed, hefting her duffel bag bag up onto her shoulder, emblazoned with patches, some Dean recognised as TV and film references, and some he didn’t. “How: the internet?”
Cas was clearly too thrown to take it all in, and Dean recognised that look, he’d looked at him the exact same way a couple of years ago at the brothel. But maybe tonight would go better, now that Cas actually wanted it. He felt a spark of guilt for not preparing him more, for not talking him through it outside, but he’d not wanted the conversation, the talk about
He leaned back, releasing Dean’s arms, feeling them push against him to throw him back. He felt the pressure sway him but stayed steady, taking a step back to balance himself. “We will see you in a few days.”
“Ugh…” Dean sighed. He liked to forget those books existed as much as humanly possible, each reminder felt like a smack in the face. Not the worst thing in his life, but it still was something he liked to avoid. Unless it was in a kinky way. Hang on, he was losing his train of thought.
"I think I'm done." Kirsty finally said, leaning back, admiring her work. Motioning to Dean, who peered over, a smile wide on his face as he looked over the perfect design.
He closed his eyes. He wasn't doing this if he could see. He couldn't pretend it was some large-breasted, blonde haired, nameless girl if he could see the stubbly male beneath him.
Cas ached to see it, but if healing it with a touch but now it was an impossibility, what was the point? He would be looking merely to look, to reach out and touch just to touch, and that was not wise.
“Don’t kill me.” He stepped forwards, toeing the line of the devils trap, raising an eyebrow in a way that bordered on seductive but landed in collusive. He smiled, teeth flashing. “You’ll be safe from demon attacks, and anything you need for Leviathans? Manpower? Magical artefacts? Yours. I’m a good ally to have.”
She was pulled back by a force stronger than a Leviathan, yanked from Dean and sent hurtling across the floor with little more grace than a goldfish that had jumped from its bowl. Something else was on her in an instant. Someone.
"You managed to be outside without getting yourself killed, then?" Dean quipped. "Sam will be amazed."
Somehow the room already looked like Dean, smelt like him even. Dean had laid out his guns on top of the dresser, had put his shoes by the door, had switched on a lamp. There was the old photograph of Dean and Mary on his bedside locker, placed carefully. It was beautiful.
"Cas got a visitor." Dean nodded to the angel, who looked surprised. It was the first time the hunter had said his name without total vehemence since he got back.
The car pulled up in front of him, and Sam wound down the window to speak. "I'm going to go ask about Olivia, Dean said she was at the bar before he got there."
Cas turned round at that, an eyebrow raised in what Dean perceived as incredulity, and to his surprise, slight sarcasm. "A tramp stamp." Cas stated. "Sam warned me that you might suggest that."
“Right…” Sam was still frowning, trying to piece it together. Surely if Dean hadn’t said anything, she would’ve said that, right?
“It’s good to see you.” Sam said, and Dean glanced around again. No one had reacted to her presence, except the waitress who was already in the process of dropping off a menu, plonking it down without grace.
He dropped to his knees, palms flat on the ground, the damp grass peeking through his fingertips. It was only then that Cas noticed the cold silver metal in his hand.
“The Angel Blade, Cas? Really?” Sam asked as he pulled it out of the wall, handing it back to him. “You could’ve got me.”
How did he let this happen, never had he let this happen before. Sure, he’d put on those satin panties for Rhonda Hurley, and he’d liked it, but that had been a red flag. He’d trod carefully since then, dabbling when a girl wanted to try something like collars or something, if she had a kink, but he’d been careful. And this wasn’t even sexual, this wasn’t doing it to get laid, this was just him and a friend, a friend there was zero possibility of a hook up on the cards.
“You really earned your room and board, huh?” He reached over for her, hugging her against his side for a few seconds, and she laughed, careful not to spill her coffee. He grabbed his own, sitting down at the table, and looked at Sam and Cas.
he had his respect, and his gratitude, and things he wasn’t brave enough to say. He held on tight, clutching Cas because he’d told himself no for way too long, and pushed closer because right now he needed to feel this. He needed to feel Cas against him, feel this wonderful, amazing man, his friend, his lips moving against his. He had promised he would do all he could to give him a good life, and
"Can I get you anything?" She said happily, leaning over slightly, her top gaping somewhat at the neckline. Dean smiled, happy with female attention even in the darkest of moods. Especially in dark moods; he could use a pick me up.
Cas didn't say anything for a minute, merely looked at the interior of the car. He had known the old one well, could list the kinks and scars that made the car theirs... the scratched initials, the army men, the rattle in the radiator. This car had none of that; it was plain, underwhelming; it did not fit.
don’t be gross.” Dean muttered, squeezing his eyes shut and taking a deep breath, shining the light in.
Sam looked at the shaking, weak girl that was the former mighty angel. The sooner they got there, the better.
So now they had to find the item anchoring grandma to this realm. Based on a conversation with Becky’s Mom, they figured they were looking for an old diary in storage, one that she’d poured her “heart and soul” into, and had left a lock of her own hair in. Sounded reasonable, except it was in the basement in storage, which meant it was going to take a while. Not ideal, when the EMF was sparking and they’d already run into a couple of cold spots.
Sam shrugged, trying to keep his face neutral as he took in the sight. “We’ve stayed in worse.” He pointed out, looking at the graffiti staining the door, old tags and dicks.
“Come on Cas, you gotta stretch it out.” Sam had called over, bending over to touch his own toes without bending his knees. He made it look easy, master and commander over his own form.
“Oh, no, god no.” He said quickly, mind briefly considering and dismissing it. He hadn’t sure what it had been in the last few days but the thought hadn’t crossed his mind once, thinking of her as more of a little sister than anything else. She frowned.
"Leviticus, man." Dean shook his head. "It also says not to wear those jeans with that shirt, but you haven't been struck down yet."
"After everything you've done for him, he still treats you like a pet. Doesn't he realise? You were a mighty angel, and you gave up everything for him!" She shook her head, ringlets bouncing. "The other angels don't understand your affection for him. I think I do."
"You're going to tell me what you know about the Leviathan's." Sam said. "Then you're going to tell me what you know about Olivia."
They all looked up instantly, the easy quiet of the bunker punctured. They had been sitting at the desks in the library, books spread out in front of them, and Sam and Cas were still poring through, sharing new information when it came up. Dean had kicked back, feet on the table and leaning back in his chair, half asleep but responding when an opinion was asked. Dozing. Lazy, easy.
"Wasn't the point of sleeping up there was so Cas wouldn't be sleeping alone?" Up again, barely a tremor to his voice at the movement. "Doesn't it kinda defeat the point if you wait until he's out?"
"Everything that happens to us is shit, Sammie." Dean sighed. "The people we get close to die; we keep dying, but we just can't get out of it. When do we get to be done?" Dean downed his glass of water, and poured another. "So for God's sake... let me drink."
In the last few weeks he’d been closer, physically, to Cas than he had in all the time they’d known each other. So many reasons to need to touch, acceptable reasons to hold eye contact, to stand close. Sure, Cas had never known much about personal space before, but now it was Dean who kept breaking those boundaries.
Similar to the night before, when he came upstairs the light was on and Cas was sitting up in bed, the Bible in his lap. Except tonight he was asleep, chin drooped on his chest. Dean pause, softened at the sight.
did they hurt, kneeling on cement was a young man’s game. Come was cooling stickily on his chin. Their fingers were still locked together, and Dean peeled away, the first nauseous wave of realisation washing through him.
“I didn’t want to intrude.” Cas said, straightening up a little as he approached. Dean instinctively reached out a hand to snag Cas’s fingertips with an ease that surprised himself a little; how long had that reflex been there, untapped and clamped down? He squeezed them a little, not wanting to drop them.
This was foolish. Dean had made his feelings about Cas perfectly clear. There would be no repeats of that night at the club, there would be nothing to hope for there. He would be grateful, no, he
Without looking, he reached down, and picked Cas's wrist back up. He firmly placed two fingers on the pulse point. He had to be sure.
”, had let Cas believe that he didn’t want this too? Because, oh man, this felt like nothing he’d experienced before. No, that’s not entirely true. It felt like when Dad hadn’t been able to look at him, after he’d thrown him clean against the room, half choked the guy in the bed to death before kicking him out with next to nothing on. The way he’d barely checked the blow to Dean’s head hadn’t killed him, and left the room, left him to clean himself up. It felt like that.
The Doctor looked at Dean warily. "As it's unclear why he's in the coma in the first place, I honestly can't tell either way."
He needed to return Dean’s items. The clothes could wait but he knew Dean might want the headphones, his Walkman useless without them. Dean would sometimes listen to it in bed at night, and what if he wanted it tonight? Cas scooped up the bundle, trudging down the hallway to Dean’s room, door still ajar. He knocked gently, and Dean looked around.
Castiel furrowed his eyebrows, in what was recognised as a confused, but curious, expression. "You find writing this down helps?"
Once he left the bathroom and was dry, he’d ask one of the brothers to put cream on the tattoo, it was a difficult place to reach. But, for right now, he’ll stay under the water for just another minute.
“Why?” Cas asked, glaring at Dean with suspicion, and God, Dean knew it hurt that Cas didn’t trust him enough any more to make
Right now it was his quad. His left quad. It felt tight, stretched taught. Oh, and his hamstring. He could barely put his heel down.
"Water vapour in the air." Cas muttered. "Introduce cold air to balance." He walked to the window on the far wall, fogged also, and tugged the wooden frame up. He shivered as a cool breeze instantly drifted in, and looked down at himself, seeing goosebumps forming on his skin. He frowned, the sensation uncomfortable, and he looked around. Seeing a towel handing beside the door, he grabbed it, wrapping it around himself. Looking down again he shifted it lower, leaving his chest bare, but hanging from his waist, covering all that he recognised would make Sam and Dean uncomfortable to see. Satisfied, he left the room, seeing the boys around the table, who both looked up at him.
Beside him a large man, stocky and built with muscle, scruffy beard and thick hair up his forearms was looking Dean up and down before nudging him, and Cas watched as Dean looked to him, breath catching in his chest for a minute. Of course this would happen, of course Dean would be the object of desire for men here. The most beautiful, wonderful man in all creation, the saviour of the world, walks into a gay bar in a small town in Montana… frankly it’s astounding that he got as far as the bar. Castiel’s chest grew tight when Dean smiled at the man.
She had a lot of info on them. She knew their family history, had stolen supposedly destroyed police records and confidential psych papers, knew everything about them. Dean liked Pie, Sam had morals. But she didn't know the truth about her Father, not yet.
It was going fine, nothing weird. Just a new normal, a new routine. A happy spot in the midst of this train wreck of a year.
“Hey, Cas.” He heard behind him, and he looked up to see Sam towering over him, three canvas bags full of produce. One of them was emblazoned with branding for this very market, and Cas supposed Sam had run out of bags. “Everything okay?”
“Stow it!” Sam yelled at them both, leaning forwards to physically get between them. “Not the time. Right now we get safe, we change cars, we drive three states over and find a motel somewhere. We plan while we drive. And we
Dean had always been into women. Sam knew he had no chance of counting all the women on his fingers and toes combined.
"Yeah, I guess." Chuck chuckled nervously, and Dean frowned again, looking over at Cas in the bed. He stood up and vacated the room.
He was thinking that, he was thinking that at Cas. If Cas could still hear prayers it would’ve rung like a bell.
“He’s right.” Sam said, looking at her. His gun was still in his hand, though pointed to the ground. Cas was still holding his blade up. “How did you find us?”
Angels are great at waiting. They can stand to attention for millennia and not think a thing of it. Nephilim, on the other hand... their human impatience intermingled with their angelic grace made tasks such as this far more arduous. However, it wasn't just her human half making this wait so difficult. It was her grace, the butchered, shuffled, shaken and stirred grace.
He answered, and Dean nodded, reaching for a sticky menu, grimacing as it tacked to his fingertips. He pointed at something which Cas couldn’t see in this light so he shrugged, which Dean accepted, and he started trying to get the bartender’s attention.
She drove into the nearest town, heading straight for the nearest bar. She'd managed to find a few dollars in change rattling around in the car, but she really struck lucky when she checked the book after she parked. Not more money, unfortunately, but the Winchesters hunting equipment. The trunk was packed full of the stuff, guns, rope, salt; everything. She grabbed a gun, a nice big bottle of holy oil, and an angel blade. Goldmine. Shoving them into a grimy bag she also found laying there, she then flicked through other bags at random, finding random bits and pieces, nothing too important; though when she found pages covered in Enochian sigils and writing, she grabbed them too - she was fairly fluent in the language, and there was a lot to read there; it may come in handy.
He just needed to figure out his own damn head. Now that he knew what he was feeling, he noticed every time the breath caught in his chest when Cas would walk into a room, the way a smile would come easily. He noticed how much he used to casually touch Cas, because now he was hyperfixated on how much he did - was it more, or less now? Should he hold it back, or would that be even weirder?
"He just went out last night, vanished." Sam told him. "When you got in you were bitching about him, saying you'd seen him."
"Sam, you alright to take upstairs?" Dean asked, not looking to his brother as he raised the gun, scouring the place with his eyes.
"Makes sense." Sam told him, and his brother shrugged, settling down on the sofa. He leaned back, looking at the blank TV screen in front of him, then at the ceiling. He started making noises with his mouth, squeaking and squelching, and obviously annoying. Sam put up with it for a few minutes until he abruptly lowered his laptop screen. "What?"
Doubling over in pain, not caring about the mud, he collapsed sideways, curling into a foetal position. His breathing was even heavier now, it seemed to be coming out in coughs and chokes and while did seem to be related to the screaming pain across his body, it felt like it was coming from another type of pain, one stemming straight from the shoves and words from the hunter across town.
Dean felt a gnaw of worry building inside him as he looked at the angel. He was hunching slightly, chin dipped a little too low. And then Dean saw it. Starting at the hands, a drip. One black drip. And at the mouth too. The ears, soaking the underarm of his trenchcoat.
Cas picked up the shirt that lay on the floor and placed it back on the towel rack, making sure it stayed this time. He shivered, feeling another line of water begin its way down is back, and he grabbed the towel, reaching around to dry it off. He had a little difficulty reaching back there, much as Dean had said he would.
"No, it wouldn't." Dean confirmed to himself. He exhaled firmly, looking back at the book, but his eyes wantonly drifted back to Cas.
Dean hummed in thought. If Sam was telling the truth, which he guessed he had no reason to doubt, Cas really was ready to get out there. He held his own and kept his cool, by the sounds of it. Though, was pretty pissed at Dean, which he only deserved about 60% of, in Dean’s estimation.
Dean was gone for most of the day, so Cas had focused on training. He and Sam had even tried yoga, which Cas had enjoyed (Sam was unsurprised). Sam had commented on Dean’s weird mood today, but Cas said nothing. It was too humiliating.
Dean smirked, replaying the film in his head, wondering if Cas was aware that he had just quoted Spock.
He followed the corridor, looking for the right window, brushing past four immediately before spotting the right one.
Dean undid his pants, reaching a hand in and touched himself, gripping tight and pulling himself out. He started jacking himself hard and fast, running his other hand along his scalp, pulling his hair at the top, scratching the nails along his neck. He came fast, catching it with his hand, the groan of
"Cas?" Garth repeated. "No, that rings a bell. Bobby mentioned him, said he was..." He looked back up.
"Atta boy." Dean grinned, making the first stitch, ignoring Sam's flinch. They stayed silent for the first few stitches, Dean focusing on the task at hand. He glanced up, checking on his brother. "You did good, though."
Balthazar chuckled, almost taken aback. "Crowley, darling; I'm an angel. You really think a thousand could have the power to stop me?"
“Don’t worry, I’m a super hacker. And modest too.” She flashed a smile, but dropped it fast, weary. “Why? I work for Richard Roman Enterprises.” Sam raised his gun imperceptibly, which she clocked, not taking her eyes off of it. “Worked, even, though never quite got round to handing in my formal notice, so… cool it.”
She didn't have much time for the ritual. It had to be performed at sun-up, which was barely any time at all. But she had the ingredients.
This sensation was new, so new. To be amongst a crowd of humans, to be one of them, feel the sweat of them around them and taste it in the air. It was loud, and heated, and the feel of being held close was heady. He could feel Rhys’s breath on his neck and he gripped his waist tighter. He could feel a stirring, a tightness in his belly, his groin, and the rolling pressure of the man against him was more than just a sensation, it felt
"I'm fantastic, dude!" He told him, breaking the hug and stepping back to look at him, the smile still wide across his face. "Just took down a poltergeist outside of Polson. That was one tough S.O.B." He shook his head at the memory. "Good times."
He didn't recognise the person. It was a woman of about twenty, tanned with mousy blonde hair, and she stood, swaying on the step. Her eyes were rolling back into her head, but she focused when she saw Dean.
Dean woke up again half an hour later, sweaty and still in his gown under the covers, splayed across Cas’s chest. He felt the soft sweep of Cas’s fingertips trailing up and down his back, lazy and content, and Dean stretched under the sheets before kicking them off. “Sorry,” He mumbled against Cas’s skin, looking up at those blue eyes. “Didn’t mean to crash again.”
“Shit, I’m sorry.” He looked up at Tasha, who was watching him cautiously. No, this was enough. “I should head. I think I’ve had enough.”
Strangely, what Cas was finding most fulfilling in getting used to this new body, not the exercise, not the training, not the regular sleep or nutritious food he was eating… it was orgasms. Masturbation. Every time he spent some time with himself he left the bathroom relaxed, happier, his body lighter, the stress of their situation lifted.
It was awkward, but Dean wasn’t sure Cas knew that. Cas seemed contemplative, head lolled back against the headrest. If Dean needed further confirmation that the moan in the bathroom had been Cas jerking off, the loss of all tension in Cas’s body, the freedom in his limbs so similar to that morning was so like for like that he was certain-
"No, what is it?" She asked again, noticing an unconscious flinch. And then she recognised it. It was a look she had seen before, a look she had seen in her Father's face before. And now that she had noticed it, she could feel it too, a twinge in her grace.
Cas looked back to her, realisation dawning on his face. Livvie saw the look on his face, the change, the quiet smugness of knowledge, and a flash of fear crossed across her face.
Cas stepped forward into Dean’s space, his mouth on Dean’s instantly and pulled their hips together, kissing through Dean’s surprised moan. Cas’s hands stayed on Dean’s hips but
“So I kept digging, and I came across you guys.” She looked at them seriously for a second, taking in the three of them. “They’re scared of you.”
“Yeah, well, now you’re just like us. We got along without all that, you’ll figure it out.” He shrugged, rolling his shoulders back. “And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with your resilience. You’ve always been tough, that’s not gone just because you’re human now.”
“And now she wants to meet?” Cas asked, turning to watch Dean as he moved around the kitchen. Sam tracked the movement too, seeing how they unconsciously revolved around each other in the room. Dean was tilted ever so slightly towards Cas, keeping him in his periphery, even though he wasn’t looking. “Why don’t you trust her?”
Time passed. They finished their food, Sam griping at the lack of salad in the house, claiming that they needed to go out and get some better food if they were going to stay here.
He hung up with a low groan, doubling over for a second out of sheer embarrassment. Fuck, he hated those books. Sam and Cas wandered closer, and Sam laughed at him.
"Pretty bad timing." Sam pointed out. "He isn't exactly in a position to defend himself, right now."
“Uh, I never said… I thought I did, but, well,” Dean cleared his throat, looking down at his feet. “You did good today. That was no small thing, what you gave… it’s something I don’t think I coulda done. I wanted you to know that.” He scratched the back of his neck, risking a glance back up to Cas. He was still staring at Dean, but his eyes had softened. Fuck, this shit was hard. “I know I fucked it up, and you’re pissed. You got every right to be but… I’m gonna try.”
"Really?" She asked incredulously. "After all his big old hissy fit earlier, he's not gonna come bust him boyfriend out?"
"Worth a try." Dean said, jumping out of the car instantly, quickly followed by Sam. He barely glanced around at the car park, heading straight for the footpath, heart thumping in his chest. He felt sure that Cas would be here, he was sure that as soon as he rounded the corner, as soon as he peered through that mesh fence he would see his friend in the worn out suit by the water. He would be there. He would be.
Dean groaned, remembering last night. Fuck. Genuine, actual, fuck. Oh, wow…. this was gonna be so awkward. Like, levels of awkward that even
"He's dead to the world for days, and all of a sudden he just wakes up?" Sam asked incredulously. He didn't miss the slight flinch at the word 'dead'.
“Hello?” Sam answered the phone, keeping it vague until they could place them; answering with a name could just confuse the situation, they’d likely used fakes. Detective Ballard… it rang a bell, but they’d met so many cops over the years, had saved tons of numbers. Some were in the know, but plenty weren’t.
“I don’t know if you want that, but it’s something I think that’s needed. You don’t gotta give me an answer yet, it’s still early days, but I’d appreciate you thinking about it.”
Dean waited for Cas to open his eyes. He could see the veins spider-webbed across his eyelids, his eyelashes fanned across his cheeks. Sweat sparkled on his forehead, droplets in his hair, and Dean gently swept his hair back with a hand, wiping across his forehead, softened out the crease between the eyebrows. He could feel Cas’s breathing settle against his skin, and then his eyes were open, bright, blue, wide. Trusting, hopeful. Happy. Dean smiled, truthful, and gently pressed a kiss to his mouth, lazy, slow, no rush anymore. Fuck, this felt good.
But he had hated himself for a damn long time. He hated so much about himself, he hated Dean Winchester, everything about him. He’d been putting on a show for such a long time he didn’t even know what he was under all that. And somehow Cas was chipping his way under it, he had for a long time.
After a half hour more of this, they came inside, shivering from the cold. Sam had even made them both a coffee to warm them up. Cas had winced at the feeling off the hot mug against his icicle like fingertips, and began to revise the theory that the itching was worse than the cold. Though, as the first sip of the hot drink touched his tongue, warming him from the inside out, he found he couldn't bring himself to care.
"And you left my conditioner in the motel! That stuff is really expensive! You made a huge mistake jumping into me."
Cas still had nightmares, some which Dean woke up for, some which he didn’t, but each day the dark circles under his eyes lessened a bit. His sleeping schedule, while still way off Dean’s small hours bedtime, approached something a little bit more reasonable, usually crashing about 11. And the training was going well. Cas was getting up early and going for a run every morning with Sam, which Dean slept through every time. Dean was focusing on hand to hand, how to disarm an opponent, while Sam taught him blocking, how to evade a charge or a punch.
"He's probably not got it in the hallway." Dean reminded, and Cas took a few steps further in, still looking around. "Try not to break anything."
Despite himself, Dean smiled. It was good to have his friend around, even if the guy didn’t know what boundaries weren’t there to be pushed.
"The modern version of pasta is very different from the original." He informed Sam, moving onto the second carrot.
Dean raised an eyebrow and cast a glance at the angel. He hadn't realised Cas had had any preference to the Impala. "We flashed up on the feds radar, had to change our style." Dean huffed.
“You’re both as bad as each other. And you’re right, he was testing you.” Sam cracked his neck, feeling his spine pop and ready. “Can we get started now?”
"No. I guess not." He replied. Handing Cas some ID, and motioning for him to put it in his suit pocket, he knocked on the door.
"Friend?" Dean repeated incredulously. These boys didn't have many friends. "Right. Whatever. I'll be down in a minute."
Dean was still on the phone behind them, though now looked more relaxed as Cas turned to look. He was leant back in his chair, clicking the pen in his hand up and down, writing nothing. Seeing Cas watching, he winked, before quickly turning away, listening to Garth. Turning back to the onions and meat in front of him, he dutifully stirred, watching as Sam chopped the carrots far more efficiently than he had. He frowned, looking away as he began to feel the uncomfortable notion of inadequacy rising, focusing instead on making sure the food didn't burn.
Under Sam's instructions, like the night before, he retrieved the packet of bacon, pouring some oil into the pan.
Cas had to be careful in future. He held a power over Dean, he could see that now. This friendship, this affection that Dean felt for him, he couldn’t abuse it. Perhaps he should even leave, let Dean carry on. Cas was human now, and humans survive. He would find a job, some income, rent a room and eat and sleep and defecate and do what humans do until they die. Maybe he would even find some joy in it.
Cas obediently stuck his finger in his mouth, sucking the injured digit. His eyebrows were still furrowed as his tongue worked the wound, and Dean watched him. His eyes followed, fascinated, as the angel sucked the finger, the angel still continuing to astonish him. This being of immense power, who had lived for millennia, who had helped stop the apocalypse, and who had been physically damaged on numerous occasions, was now sorrowfully sucking his finger because of a freaking paper cut.
"Dean," Sam sighed from across the room, still sitting at his laptop, but enjoying the film nonetheless. "Let him go to bed. Look at him, he's exhausted!"
Dean turned to leave, but Cas looked at the picture frame that he had dropped. It had not shattered, luckily, and he bent to pick it up.
"Cas?!" Dean stood up, to his feet in an instant, watching, hyper alert for a few seconds as he watched the man's chest. It still wasn't moving.
the hurt radiating off of him. The ease in his movements had vanished, and tension had filled Cas’s body. “Did you not-”
He brought his hand up to his face, looking at it, as if it would glean some special insight that he couldn't quite grasp. But instead of seeing anything on his hand, he saw... Dean. He could see the hunter, sat next to his bed, begging him to wake up.
Dean was sick of the winter. While Sam and he were the peak of physical fitness and didn't much let a bit of a chill bother them, it still sucked to hunt in the cold. Especially this far North. Spring was better, even if it had barely begun.
Dean. Dean was still in the motel, passing the time while probably doing very little. He knew Sam's instructions were to watch the angel, but Dean was undoubtedly unwilling; he had not come to look for him, and there was little chance that he would.
Silence. No one talked. Sam slumped back glaring at his arm again, grabbing the flask from the divot between the seats and wincing before splashing it on the wound. “Can I help you, Sam?” Cas asked, voice low and with all the effort of calm he could muster.
Cas hummed, accepting his words but not necessarily believing. He needed to get better at this. If he went on a hunt with Dean, with the Winchesters, and he got them hurt because of his own ineptitude… this wasn’t an option. He needed to be better.
Cas looked at them both. “Are we-” He cut himself off, shaking his head. “Let’s get in.” He reached for the door, brushing Dean in the process, and Dean tried to smother how he flinched away. Cas hefted the door open, it was stiff and creaked, and inside… pitch black. The light from outside lit a few feet, a short hallway, a kind of porch, and Dean gingerly stepped over the threshold, waiting for a booby trap, a giant rolling stone ball… nothing. He stepped forwards.
Sam nodded, heading straight over to the pan, grabbing an avocado from the pile of fresh stuff on the counter. Cas lingered in the doorway, watching Dean carefully before slowly entering the cabin. “Plenty for you too, buddy.” Dean said, looking away at the clock. He didn’t watch Cas come in, but somehow he was aware of him anyway, his quiet footsteps louder than Sam’s galumphing stomps.
“Oh.” Dean had wondered about this, the way he had reacted when he got his first papercut. “So the tattoo?”
Cas glanced at the mirror, remembering Dean's earlier words. For the rest of his life, this would be a permanent, visible feature on his body. He would see it every time he looked in the mirror, he would have an ever present reminder that he was less than what he used to be. He wasn't an all powerful angel, he wasn't invulnerable to having his agency removed from this body and something else jumping in. It was a badge displaying his weaknesses.
“If you’ve got anything on you.” He refused to get any more specific, god, he couldn’t get too close to naming it, naming what they’d done. This was a mistake, a huge, colossal mistake. If there was a way to put this behind them Dean couldn’t see it.
"Being gay." He started up again, the words exiting his mouth unbidden, the embarrassment he had felt appeased somewhat. "Thought the bible cared about that one."
“She’s expecting me and Sam. If she tries something, we need someone to get us out.” Dean looked at Cas, breathing in his frustration. “Cas, this ain’t a fight, this is tactics. What do you think?”
"Yeah, Dean; exactly! We also shot his daughter through the chest with an arrow. He'll kill us if we summon him."
Just as he was happy with the room, Dean and Sam returned, arms full of shopping bags. Dean blinked, taking in the room. “Man, it’s shining in here. You did this?”
"At the time, a little." Cas explained. "Leviticus was written more as a guideline for the society. Rules and laws that made sense at the time, but don't any more. Homosexuality tied in with 'go forth and multiply', but with overpopulation as it is, it's no longer an issue." He looked up at Dean. "As you are neither Jewish nor born three and a half thousand years ago, you don't need to worry about it."
The tightening grip on the wheel and the clench of Dean's jaw confirmed that it had, in fact, been precisely the right thing to say.
"Yeah, I know." Dean sighed, chewing the inside of his cheek. "We don't think you're useless. You just spent a few millennia fighting in a different way."
“Are you talking about sex, or sex with men?” Cas asked. “Or sex with you? Because you didn’t seem to have these reservations when you
But Dean was enjoying his time with Charlie, was happy. Dean had brought him to that club to give him the space to explore his sexuality, Cas could grant Dean the same courtesy. Give him one more night before they return and invade whatever space Dean and Charlie had created. If Dean was happy, Cas could be happy.
They drove for hours without stopping. They knew they had to put a good distance between them and the hospital, and they certainly weren't going back to the motel. They needed somewhere safe and secure right now, and seeing as they didn't have Bobby's, they went to the next best thing; Rufus's cabin.
"Oh, no; I think it is. Who is it, Cassie? Who could possibly be calling you?" She tilted her head. "I wonder..."
The man, Rhys, said back, and Cas nodded. They weren’t standing still by any means, the constant jostle of the crowd keeping them in motion but Cas was firmly aware that his movements weren’t anywhere near as fluid, as purposeful as Rhys’s. “
Dean was looking out of the window. He didn't want Cas to see his face, or his eyes, which were currently a little too shiny. He blinked away the slight moisture. Damnit, that angel was beginning to chip away at his boundaries... again.
“Where is he?” Dean hissed, as if being quiet right now would hide them better, with the tyres crunching on the gravel.
“Still managed the avocado though, huh?” Dean jibed, and Sam glared across at him. “No, you did good. We didn’t know where we were landing up, I figured it was gonna be a motel or something.”
“Interesting,” Cas rumbled out, dropping Dean’s hand and reaching for his shoulder, to place his hand over the memory on Dean’s shoulder. Dean fell into his orbit, knees slotting together, sandwiching Cas against the car but somehow still utterly at his mercy. They kissed, Dean clutching at Cas’s waist, the back of his neck, and Cas kept squeezing, almost bruising again the mark he made so long ago. And then he gripped Dean’s jaw, steering him back, lips tearing away. “I think I see what you mean.”
"What's the hold up, Cassie?" Livvie asked, leaning back on the chair. "They're taking their sweet time, aren't they?" She smirked. "They're not calling, either."
“The Xenophobic response would be astronomical.” Cas said, and Dean remembered again how much Cas had seen, the length of his existence. He’d seen humanity have to shift again and again, seen their reactions and how they adjusted.
Dean sighed. The thought should scare him… but maybe it didn’t sound too bad. The weight of the world had been on their shoulders for a long time. Maybe it could be traded off. “She said she’s gonna do it with or without us.”
“That you didn’t want it, you only did it to please me.” Cas moved away, shaking his head as he remembered the guilt he had felt, and it was morphing into rage. “But you wanted it too?”
"Yes, please." She agreed, ignoring the looks that she was getting from drinking so much straight alcohol so quickly. Even as a human, her metabolism far exceeded everyone else's.
He picked the first room in the hallway. The rooms were identical so the choice there was arbitrary, but it made sense. Dean had tactically chosen one further along, more time to get alerted to an intruder, more time to react.
Cas was like glue against him, as determined as possible to have as much body contact as possible, and Dean was on board as all hell with it. The flat planes of his chest, the slight muscle in the pecs pressed against him, it was a little weird that he hadn’t noticed how little he noticed the difference. Usually tits would be a prime focus, a barrier between them and something fun as all hell to play with, but the lack of them didn’t leave Dean feeling like he was missing anything, and that realisation was fucking thrilling.
