"You want?" He said holding out the lollipop and offering it to me. He was very kind and I was very hungry.
When Steve came into the water, I could tell something was wrong. So, being the amazing friend I am, I confronted him, it was the most sensible thing. So Tony, yeah, Steve has every right to mad and what upsets me is that, he isn't he's actually willing to keep it to himself and has been for s many years now. Its bothering. So I decide, to give Tony a taste of his own medicine.
Steve and Tony stand there pretty cluelessly for a while which may have been the first time Steve had bitten his nails and finally Bruce comes blasting into the room, panting. He looks around the room before his eyes set on the kid. He does whatever they do, I have no idea and soon enough, Peter's coughs fill the room.
"Give?" At this point, I'm full on glaring at at Tony.
"Hello fellow mortal acquaintance!!" Here we go again(reference, just saying. Not marvel but still). Lord give me the strength to survive this week by keeping that god away from my son.
"Hi." I know he's not gonna start and I have to strike a conversation before Pietro starts drooling over him in the other side. I went for a glass of whiskey that lay unattended.
At that second there was a wooshing of air suddenly and everyone turned to see what happened. I honestly couldn't care but of course my curiosity got the better of m.  They turned only to find Mjolnir soaring through the air and was caught by STEVE!!

"Hey Tony." Double f*¢*! Okay, calm down Tony, you can't let Steve see you like this. But I will totally punch the next person I see! Maybe I should try one of those punching bags Steve always uses. Plus, hot damn his ass is on point when he's punching. What, no shut up!!
"Maybe I can calm him down." Well Tony wouldn't dream of hurting Peter so yeah, this could work.

Hey, as most of you know, yes this is based on a stony picture but I really wanted to do so hell with the haters. Tell me if you like it!
Peter smiles softly before coming up to me and hugging me tightly. I hug back.
"Don't worry, they're just booping."
Yay! Another based on an image but again, don't read if you don't want to. But I think its good plus the title is like, at least in my opinion, amazing so yeah, that's that.
"Hey."
Summary:- This is I think my first one where they aren't dating...yet. And the picture says that anyway but if I'm being honest, I just liked the picture and decided to write something so get ready to be surprised cause I am too. Also, since I'm evil, I'm writing this in one POV so you have no idea how the other person feels.
"Fine." Followed by a world-breaking sigh directed straight at Tony. "Well since its been an hour since Clint and Pietro left, I'll just go myself, wanna come?" Clint and Pietro was a bad idea, well, learn from your mistakes.
"No! I don't need a bath, I'm already clean!!"
"Do you happen to know your last name?"
"Sea." And with that, I ran towards Pietro and Clint.
"Training with Wanda." Oh.
"Well, yeah. You know, you're Captain America but more than that, your Steve Rogers. You're sweet, loyal, polite and I'm Tony Stark, why would you possibly choose me!?" Wow, that may be the first time Tony truly came out to me, I didn't think he thought he didn't deserve me.
Finally, my elevator really needs to move faster. I'll work on that later. Anyway, I quickly got out, as fast as I could. I needed to get away from Loki and get to Peter ASAP. Thor wishes everyone who all kind of ignore Loki. And I'm back to usual to not feeling any guilt or anything of the sort. And unsurprisingly, half an hour later, Thor is still in the middle of explaining to the others how Loki isn't evil with only Steve paying any attention while Loki is happily trotting around the others is circles juggling knives which I have no idea where they came from seeming perfectly content with his life. You know what, hell with this, I'm getting Pete out of here and he will never leave my sight!
"Custody? Wait, are you'll getting a divorce?!"
"I'm going to my room." I didn't mean for it to come out blank but eh.
"Don't even think about it." I stared her dead in the eyes and watched as the last ounce of dignity she had left were shed. With that I let go, picked up Peter in one hand, grabbed Tony with the other and walked away. I also had to help Clint to hold back Natasha from committing another murder. Bruce had his green vein popping in his forehead and was a balloon pop away from turning. Needless to say, we had successfully lost Thor.
"Yeah, just picking out a shirt!" He shouted out without even looking up, not noticing my presence in the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Infant!?" Loki cut in. How nice, he's rude as well as commits first degree murder as a hobby. Must make a delightful brother. Oh wow, for the first time in my life, I feel pity for Thor. Its weird.
He blinked a few times then looked around. Tony ran up to him offering a glass of water while Peter and Thor who were still playing on the floor were in awe(mostly Peter). Nat though was the first to embrace him. She squeezed as tight as she could while he hugged back and smiled. Just then, Pepper ran in(rather fast) and hands Steve a pair of clothes that he had carried.
Shit! When did I fall asleep!? Oh crap!! Where's Peter!!
Then at the worst possible moment, Natasha starts calling me, and my AC/DC ringtone went off.
"Have I done something wrong?" Loki was talking very innocent which he was.
"Sir, would you like some help cleaning up?"
"Sorry, can you
"Faulty?"
A tall handsome man walked into our bedroom wearing a black cloak and a great striped scarf and holding a long stick with something bright shining at the tip. He came with uncle Thor.
Yess. Finally, I can go out after like two weeks. Tony has been sick and I have been home taking care of him not that I'm complaining cause I love him, I might not have said it out loud yet but yeah, I do. So today, I'm going out with Bucky, Sam, Clint and Scott. I don't know what it is but something is going on between Sam and Bucky. You could cut the sexual tension between them with paper.
"The 'Old Fashion'. Hopefully they're good for a first timer." What did he just say!?
Halloween Special Update! I'm so sorry that I haven't uploaded recently, but if you don't know, I have a new book that's come out and I've been working super hard on it, so go check it out. It is a Highschool AU with Stony, Hawksilver and like four more ships so go check it. Apart from that, I had this story idea a while ago so I had to do it. I will try to update this more often so...
"Well..." He sat down on my lap and straddled me. "It was kinda hot." Woah, not what I was expecting. Tony has a pumpkin kink? Then to top it off, he added,
The air was chilled and crisp. It was amazing. I took my usual route through about ten parks, I usually do almost double but I have to get back to make breakfast. Tony gets really cranky if he doesn't get his breakfast. I get home at around 8am and go straight into the shower, no matter how much I run or how little I sweat, I always feel disgusting after running. Sometimes Tony joins me but I didn't see him today morning actually, he wasn't in bed so that meant he was...SHIT! I jump out of the shower and throw the first thing I find, which was underwear. Then I run, like bolt to the kitchen hoping what I already knew wasn't true. But of course, the universe is cruel and Tony was in the kitchen a pan on the stove and an egg in it. Just in case you're wondering, the fire wasn't on and the egg had it's shell on. Where did the term 'Genius' come from?
So its an overall very quiet journey to the living room for some reason but we don't enter, we stop at the door. I look inside and see Steve painting. He has one of those humongous canvases on a stand. Suddenly, Clint grabs my shoulder and pushes me in. What the hell?! I don't stop to argue because Steve notices me and all of a sudden, his face goes vermillion(reference, comment if you know). I have no idea what's going on.
"Nope." He smiles that wicked smile of his and I don't feel so good anymore. My instinct is to protest but then I risk it not happening at all. Damn it.
"What is it, we'd literally do anything at this point."
Jarvis, can you scan him. Maybe get us a name and stuff like that or anything?"
Anyway, Pete and I start building a sand castle, Pietro and Clint are in the sea and Tony is exploring...not the beach, the women. It was really bothering me but Peter helped distract me. Soon enough, okay no way further than enough, Tony comes back over and I decide to just go and get in the water.
Damn it, what's taking them so long? Come back!!! Oh no, now Steve's talking to people, ooh, he's cute. Oh crap! He's cute, way cuter than me! This is bad, like really really bad. I need to go over there. Right now. No I shouldn't, I should trust Steve, right? Okay, to be honest I wouldn't trust myself with that hot piece of ass. But Steve isn't like me. Maybe that's why he's flirting, uhh. Frick it, I'm going over there.
"Yes, according to my scan, subject B1B25 appears to be Captain Rogers."
'THUD!!' What the hell happened now, is Peter okay? Is Tony okay? Am I okay?
I give them my version of the story, which is the normal version because all I did was wake up but they're all still very confused and if I'm being honest, SO AM I!!
"We just got in!" Clint is crazy.
"I'm sorry, I-"
About a minute later, everyone comes through the door(which in this house was not often) to see me sitting on the bed with the baby snuggled to my chest. Nat is holding a glass of milk and Clint has Peter in his hands. Peter runs up at the sight of me and stops when he sees the baby and burst into tears.
That's better. And sure honey." I may come off bipolar at times but I just have ranging moods. It's just misinterpreted.
"Pops, when will Daddy stop?" Aww, Peter actually looked scared, well Tony is quite scary when he doesn't get his donuts.
"Right away, sir!"
"Uncle Thor!!"
"Tony, stop. Okay? You're smart, kind, handsome and anyone would be lucky to have you. Don't ever think you're not good enough cause you're better. I love you." What did I just say, oh crap it just slipped out. See his eyes are the size of tennis balls, it was definitely too early.
Soon enough, Ma got back home with Thor and Clint felt obliged to tell her what happened. To all of out surprises though, she didn't flip out and try to kill someone but instead smirked. Now, I've known her for long enough to know all her smirks. This was her 'It's okay, I took care of it myself' smirk.
"Sure." Well that was easy.
Summary:- Contrary to popular belief, Steve is not an introvert. Let loves going out but Tony thinking suspiciously, can't let anything slip his notice cause he can't lose Steve.
"While that dies sound appealing.... I'm afraid I have a boyfriend I wouldn't dream of trading for a one-night stand." Did he just say that!? Oh my god! Wait what's up with the waitress, did she just- Oh My God!!
"What can I say bud, things aren't exactly looking the best as of now." Steve replied with tears forming in his eyes. He was trying soo hard to hold them in and look strong for Peter but he too couldn't imagine life without Tony.
"Thank you ma'am." He said with a kind of Brooklyn accent which almost never comes out.
"Well, I was just playing around. Why? Wanna test it?" What is he talking about. He must've read my expression cause he added, "Meet me here at five." Okay? Before I even replied, he turned towards Pietro talking about stuff I wish I could erase from my brain! Uhh.
"Do you spy on us when we are not clothed, Man of Iron!?" Thor boomed.
"....and then fill up a pot with water and bring it to a boil." It wasn't going that badly! I made the ravioli, not as well or pretty as Steve but I'll call mine authentic. I fill up a way too large pot with water and kept it near the stove. Okay, my next foe, how do I turn on a stove? It seemed pretty simple so I just turn this knob-thing I think? On crap, my sleeve!
"Yeah, why? How did you know?"
"Awesome", I pretty much run to the elevator overcome with joy and hugged Peter with all my might and kissed him on the forehead as he stepped out. He accepted and hugged me back. This is the first i've seen him in like two weeks and it has been like a never ending hell.
"...and then we walked to see the other part of the be- Tony, are you insane!?!" What the hell, that was abrupt. He started running, what the hell he knows I hate running. Wait, what is he running to? OH SHIT.
He bolted towards the tub at superhuman speed and dunking his hands in the water, grabs Peter, takes him to his room and lays him on their bed. Still panting and not having recovered the initial shock.
"Tony painted on Cal's shield." Ohhh.
"Then who's the kid?" Asks Bruce.
Word Count:- 1206
Okay as long as I keep my distance, I don't think he'll see me if I just lay low. I mean I'm in disguise but that never works in movies.
Its been a while before I've written. Right? I think. Anyway, hope you enjoy it! But no pressure, except on my friends, you guys better like it! I'm serious.
"He left about an hour ago, I believe to get a haircut." Oh, without me? Well I really can't blame him, his hair was so long.
My head hurts, like not even a normal hurts like a 'I just had a building crumble above my' hurts(Homecoming ref). What's the time? Where am I? Oh crap. Where are my clothes?!
"What do you want Tony?!" He spat out and the whole time, I don't think he made eye contact with me.
He looked at me for a moment unsure then pulled me to my heels and kissed me passionately. I wasn't like it on the outside but I was blowing with excitement on the inside.
"Sorry, Clint was really starting to irritate and I just couldn't wait!" It wasn't wrong.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hello, listen we're trying to find you parents so could you tell me your name?"
"Well, me and Pietro are going to 'explore' the forest." ('explore' was air quotes, you know for effect) Of course they are. I swear, by next year they'll have had sex in every country.
"What is it?" I had no idea and I think he knew cause it seemed like he had an answer at the ready.
"What are you talki- ohhh" Clint was really enjoying himself. Damn him.
"Sir, Master Peter is on his way up"
"What donuts do you like?" The first thing I do is throw in three boxes of 'Golden Chocolate', then throw in all the boxes Peter pointed to and got some 'Old Fashion' for me. I have no idea how it tastes but it sounds like my kind of thing.
Daddy's face lit up.
"Steve?" I heard Tony say but it was coming from ahead instead of from the person I was hugging, so I looked up to see Tony standing there with a confused expression. Then out of nowhere the person I'm hugging suddenly starts giggling. What is going on, is this the voodoo thing Tony warned me about?
"Sir, master Rogers doesn't appear to be in the building."
"Are you okay?" I realised I wasn't the only person in the room, and look up to see Steve standing there with an outstretched arm and a glass a water.
"Haven't you got enough of those?" Honestly, he's the only reason I'm not the most sarcastic person on the team.

"Not a clue! Oh wait! Jarvis put last night's footage until the time I woke up on the screen."
"J, where's Steve?"
Peter shrugs.
Yay another one!! I have no idea what you thought when you read the title and I was supposed to name it 'Burnt' like the movie with Bradley Cooper but I think this is a nice pun so...
"Are you insane!?" Step was mad, like really mad. He was hugging a crying Peter to his chest. When Steve got there, he was hiding under the sun bed scared to death.
"They await in the dining room near the kitchen." That's where I thought they would be. I actually have an entire floor dedicated to dining but that's only for like really special occasions. I should turn it into a party floor or something.
What the hell! Did the lights just go out?! I didn't think that happened in the Stark Tower with the fancy backup. Maybe it just needs a few seconds to start up. Okay, now it feels like I've been waiting for like a minute. If only I had a torch or, a lamp or anything. Oh wait, I have a phone! Great now how do I put the torch on?
"Steeb Wogers!" He said happily before grabbing the lollipop from Daddy and tearing it open. Now I'm hungry.
Summary: It's never too late Christmas!! And also because I forgot to write this during actual Christmas. SOOOO....Christmas!! Yay. This is not Superfamily and since the Avengers were working Christmas cause Nick's a byotch, late party. But Steve and Tony get into a huge fight because Tony is overworked and Steve hasn't been getting enough me-time which he needs because he's just a big teddy bear. Also, post wedding. Also Also, I couldn't help with the pun, I apologise.

make me breakfast?" Yes, yes I can.
"Honestly, if it meant getting to wake up to you even twice a week, I would gladly carry you up, even if it was at three in the morning and I had to climb twenty flights of stairs." It was true. I missed the days when I would wake up to Tony. It was a beautiful sight indeed: his messy brown hair all entangled, the blanket on the floor and his legs wrapped around me in ways that shouldn't be humanly possible. Unlike now, when I wake to a cold bed, no dip in the mattress. Just alone. Tony, after hearing my comment, had resumed his position and continued staring at the floor this time with pure guilt.
"Sea." Oh at least he's going swimming so I can spy on him from here. I get in the sand with Peter who was building a sandcastle and being honest, it wasn't half bad. I guess he got his daddy's building skills. Wait, what is he doing!? Why is he picking up Pietro?! Okay, can down, no need to be jealous. They're just very good friends. Right?
"Oh, sorry this is Luke, he's from New York too. Luke, this is my husband, Tony." I shook hands with him and he looked like he was about to explode. Well, I do have that effect on people so I'm not surprised. *pride*
Summary:- Steve needs a haircut. Badly. But he doesn't know a professional place so he just wings it.
"I don't find them cweepy."
Pops? Who was pops?
I head back to the tower for lunch. It was a hectic morning, finding a CEO is exhausting but there area few good choices, far better that Pepper. I actually have no idea why I ever made her CEO, that was dumb which is weird because I'm a genius. Wow, when did my ego grow? Oh right, every day. The elevator finally arrives and I step inside.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Let's just say their house looks like cotton candy on steroids right about now, and I'm not just talking about toilet paper, beleive me." For those who got the joke, which is everyone except Bucky, Thor and Pete who didn't know what steroids were, laughter erupted. And soon enough, it was time to go back to the Tower.
"Duh." I gotta get my sarcasm title back.
"I still don't trust him!" I walked up to him and dragged him to our bedroom and just as the elevator was leaving, I heard Peter telling Loki something though it was only because of my super hearing.
Summary:- If you haven't guessed yet, Tony is a donut person. Okay, that wasn't much of a reveal but still. And also, this is a superfamily and Peter is about six so get ready to be overthrown by cuteness. Also yes, this is based on a picture, don't read it if you're that person.
"So you noticed them." Of course I did, he's playing at something.
"Marco Polo?" Ah good times.
"Hey Steve, did you know Tony spie-" Clint started.
"Thwank oo." I replied taking it happily. I like him even more now.
"Great..... don't wait up although you probably will anyway and call me if there's an emergency, an actual emergency!" Then I pecked him on the cheek and left.
"What did you do?" I wanted to know what she did and whether it could harm someone.
"Good to know your lie reflexes work." He jumped in his chair at the sudden voice in front of him. His eyes widened in realisation and terror. In conclusion, he was not going to like what was in store for him.
"When was the last time we had dinner together. It's been a couple months and you've come down for dinner maybe five times! I take time and effort to cook so that you won't have to eat take-out and I feel like you deliberately wait till it gets cold!" He looked downwards, not out of shame but to process his thoughts. Soon, he looked guilty. He opened his mouth to say something,probably an apology, but I wasn't done and I wasn't going to be anytime soon. "Also when was the last you've slept with me?" His head shot up and I realised by badly chosen words. "I meant actual sleeping. Why is it that I always seem to be sleeping when you're working? Or do you just sleep in your lab to avoid me, do you hate hugs that much?!"
As you all know dear readers I changed a lot of things in the timeline of the story and one of them is Captain Marvel, I have been wondering if I should add her or not or what kind of approach I liked the best.
1991, Tony's twenties birthday, and Steve finding JARVIS and Dummy in Tony's room…
"You will forgive me… just like that?" Steven asked with wonder in his voice, which caused Tony to blink his eyes a few times and shrug, what was he supposed to do? Hate the guy for being an asshole? If that was true, then Tony would hate half the people living on earth.
Steve wanted to scream, he wanted to ask the man what he was doing here, why was he here? But the thing was; if the Alpha hadn’t shown up when he did, his Peter would have probably got hurt too. Not that far, Steve was able to pick up the sound of sirens, which made his tense muscles relax; it seems that someone did call the police after they heard the gun go off, which was reassuring. “Come on baby, stand up, we are going to May’s.” Steve whispered to his boy, kissing his son’s face, over and over, trying to calm his baby’s whose heart was pounding like a frightened rabbit in his chest. What wouldn’t Steve give to be able to hold his baby in his arms like a healthy person? Picking him up and walking toward May’s house without letting his child be separated from his embrace, but the thing was, Steve wasn’t able to hold his child like that since his baby turned six, not without Steve feeling strained and for his asthma to act up.
The man was silent, never talking, only blinking and looking around the place without a real interest, which made the Omega wonder if it was something that he did, or if that the Alpha was disappointed that Tony wasn't here to escort him around, the Alpha just shuffled around and followed Steve when the Omega directs him to the guest room that Tony has prepared for him, he left the Alpha to refresh after that while promising that dinner will be prepared soon, which gained him nothing but silence in return…
"Why you…" Tony growled at the man and nearly attacked him if it wasn't for Peggy holding him back while giving him a look that shut him up. "His name is
Edith said after she hacked into the towers speakers, which made Tony squeak at the words he was at the end of, his face becoming red from embarrassment and a little bit of anger, he never thought he will be sassed to death by an AI with his mother's voice, though if Tony was true to himself, he knows that these words will be the exact words his mother will say to him if she was alive. "Amateur? Do you even know who I am, I created J! You can ask him and Dummy about my excellent work!" Tony said waving his fist to the ceiling hoping that the sassy AI will see reason.
Though what really made her blood freeze was the runes on the Omega's bicep, runes that the last time they were seen on anyone was decades ago… runes merging together to form the word 'lífið'… life… an Omega that will give life to everything they touched, and Omega that was blessed by the Goddess Frigga herself, an Omega she knew that if he was brought to their village, it meant that they will be regarded as the superior in their homeland… an Omega that if their king mated… will bring power and life to them… Loki informed her that his village deep so deep into the northern mountains, when it snows nine months out of twelve, and the rest of the months are freezing coldness are the homeland of the Omegas with the same runes as that Omega, Asgard, a village that was named after the place their Gods and Goddesses lives in, village that no one knows its place, so modern and strange it said that no sane person ever went to it and return with his mind intact, and those who were born in it were the strongest of all, a place that was said to be the real Asgard, and that mating an Omega from them meaning the blessing of the Gods will be theirs… it made Nattalegg narrow her eyes at the thought of the Omega being from Loki's homeland, and if he was how did Johann's sticky hands fell on one?
"Fine!" The Alpha snarled as he hit the bars with his fists making a loud bang that made everyone jump, everyone but the Omega who was glaring harshly at the Alpha. "You got what you are after foolish Omega! Your people are granted their freedom, the only thing you shall worry about from now on is your ability to cook and clean, and hope that your son is as good as he claimed." The Alpha hissed as he turned away from the Omega, snarling at the servants making them jump in fear before he stalks toward the stairs, climbing them fast hoping that some fresh air will calm his fried nerves.
"Yes, baby, he is…" Tony ends up saying, trying desperately to hold into his tears, his baby's happy grin was worth it.
Whatever harsh words and actions Anton planned on spewing got stuck in his throat with no way for them to be out, because when Anton turned his head to the queen…. The queen was crying. Fat tears were rolling down the queen's cheeks, causing the queen's flushed face to turn red; Anton doesn't know if the redness was because of the queen's offers to hold the sounds of his pain back or if it was from how wound up he was. "He took, and you welcomed him back?" Anton's breath hitched when the queen's voice broke. Not once, not even when the queen lost his stillborn child did the man ever let someone see him cry, and to witness this now, part of Anton felt like he was gazing at something that he has no right to see. "No trust, you Alphas are all the same, liars!" The queen hissed before turning around and walking away from Anton, so fast that the Alpha had a hard time saying that the queen wasn't running.
Tony's blood ran cold in his vein, his breath freezing in his chest as he heard that voice… how? Just how? Without another second, Tony slammed the phone shut, holding Morgan tightly in his arms as he gazed at the landline like it was a beast about to attack him. Tears that Tony desperately tried to stop were finally running down his cheeks; denial and terror warring inside of his head at the realization of who he heard. Tony was sure he hadn't messed Rhodey's number, he was sure he dialed the right number, then how? How was it his father who answered him? Why was his father answering Rhodey's phone?
"I am an adult…" Tony said these words through gritted teeth, and Steven saw the flash of hurt and pain in the Omega's eyes.
The whimper seemed to increase when Tony reached the last box, which made Tony's smile widen even more as he kneeled down and opened the box, hoping to see a dying animal or something. What Tony didn't expect though, was him finding a baby… a baby… a child? Whatever, it was a squirming small human being.
"Because I… I ran away…" Harley murmured as he shifted on the bed, still staring at his hands like they were going to give him the answer to every question in the world; Steve raised his eyebrow waiting for Harley to continue. "And… and… I'm sorry?" Harley stuttered, glancing at Steve every now and then hoping to analyze his reactions, tough luck, Steve was in the army if he wanted he can have the best poker face out there.
Grumbling to himself, Steve finished packing the bags before he left his room, planning on having a long talk with Bucky about how he should move on and forget about him (Which is a little hypocrite coming from Steve) "Bucky, are you there?" Steve asked as he knocked on the door, waiting for a little while, wondering if Bucky went to sleep or he had already stormed out. "Bucky, we need to talk, please open the door." Steve tried to be gentle as he said these words, hoping that the man would show up so that Steve can finally end one of his unfinished businesses. "Bucky, I am coming in…" When he saw that the door was opened, Steve stated that Bucky was either waiting for him inside or that he already left the mansion.
"Could you please explain?" Mr. Barnes rumbled at him, narrowing his eyes darkly, merely for his wife to dig her elbow in his ribs with a scowling making the man back off. "What, I said please!" The man roared only for his wife to roll her eyes and send him a threatening glance, leading to the said man to groan and rub his abused side.
Steve was shocked, that was the only thing he could feel at the moment; he didn't know if his shock was about how Tony could act like this in front of his brother. It was then that anger replaced the shock he felt, anger at Tony for ignoring his calls, anger at him for abandoning him on the most important day of their life, anger at his husband for snapping at him when he was the one wrong, and the most important one, anger at his Alpha for embarrassing him in front of his brother. "Out…" Steve said through gritted teeth, it was the only word he can get out without him starting a shouting match with Tony; he doesn't want Bucky to feel out of place than he already was.
"P-Papa told me… about you two getting married." Peter said shyly, causing Tony to smile and give Steve a fleeting glance before returning his gaze to Peter who was struggling to say his next words. "You c-can marry him... c-can I… can I call you M-Mama?" both of Steve and Tony's eyes widen at that, Tony probably from the shock and Steve because he didn't think that Peter will accept Tony being his other parent as fast as he did not with what his boy told him not a few seconds ago.
So sorry for the late update but life happens.
Steven took a few shaky breaths as he leaned on the rough barks, looking at the sky that was covered by branches and leaves that were letting a few beams of lights through, making the Omega close his eyes for a second as he breathes through his nose scrunching his eyebrows at the disgusting taste that stayed in his mouth wondering if he had time to go and get a sip of water from the well not that far from the house.
The more he thought about it the more that Tony realized that Peter… that he could be his… his son? Tony didn't know, it just doesn't make any sense, just like how it didn't make sense that Peter will get attached to him when he practically fears Omegas, just like it doesn't make any sense that Steve or anyone of his family and friends never talks about Steve's supposed mate, like whoever they were, they never existed.
"What is it, Mama?" James asked as he saw his dam taking a few sheets of paper, a feather, and some ink, when he reached his mother, he was pulled into his lap, making the child hum and snuggle into his mother, watching as his mother start drawing a huge tree. "What is that?" James asked with awe in his voice, his mother was always amazing when he draws, James made sure to always hide his dam's drawing that his mother draws for him when he felt down.
But she was not anyone; she can see the hardness in his eyes, can see the anger, the rage, the promises, and the pain that was promised to her if she failed to deliver what was asked of her. "As the stars whispered, he disappeared." Nebula started her body tense unconsciously, ready to flees out of this barren place when she saw the anger shining in her father's eyes.
What do you think?
"What are you thinking about, sweetheart?" Steve's voice snapped Tony out of his deep thoughts, causing him to blink and turn his face toward his husband, his smile turning from wistful to happy as his husband held him in his arms, running a hand over his belly.

The next time Tony woke up, was to the sound of his door being knocked on, which made the man groan in pain and sit up, blinking his eyes in confusion when he saw that he was sleeping on the floor with his hammer beside him, which made the man tilt his head, he can't remember what happened last night after he went to bed. Before Tony can pounder on it more, the sound of the door and Clint's voice made him blink and stand up, rushing to open the door for the two of them fearing that they will break the door if he didn't.
"Why would I tell you something like this? So you can tell Stane who will end up proposing to do such a selfless act of mating me to protect my virtues… I prefer to die." Growled Tony as he took the book from the coffee table and return it with the other books in the box.
It was a normal day… well, as normal is it can be for fifteen years old in his last year of MIT, it was summer so for once Tony decided he was going home in New York, mainly to visit Jarvis and Aunt Peggy, if someone deserves to be treated with respect and love, it was those two. His first week there, was even good! His parents were in God knows where and would come by the end of the week, Aunt Peggy took a vacation and come to visit, she told him more stories about Captain America then his poor heart can stand… Aunt Peggy always laughs at his poorly hidden flushed face, but that doesn't matter he got to listen to more stories about his hero so that was as good as it can be. Jarvis took it as his job to overstuff Tony with his delicious food, stating that Tony was starving himself to death and that he won't stand it, for once Tony didn't complain he just drooled as the amazing food was laid in front of him, all in all, it was an amazing week… until he presents as an Omega by the end of it.
"Oh, don't say that Stevie, you were really good this time, a day or two of practice and you will master ballroom dancing!" Bucky said in a cheerful voice as he stood up, trying to hide his wince but Steve already says it and let out a sad sigh… Steve was really an idiot, what was he thinking when he asked Tony for a dance? He will embarrass Tony for years and years to come!
"Hey wait! Steven, Steven, Steve wait! If you don't come back here your name will become Stevie!" Tony squeaked as he rushed after Steven, Bruce, Clint, and Thor followed Tony and Steven too, probably wanting to know more about the reincarnation theory (In Bruce and Thor's case) or wanting to ask Steven for some of his good luck (Clint) needless to say when Steven saw them, he booked it toward his room with Peter in his arms. Natasha, Peggy, and Bucky looked at each other with and shrugging at what they saw, but when they heard the sound of something crashing they cursed and rushed after their fellow Avengers, in hope of saving Steven in time.
"Steve… are you staying with Master Anthony just because of the guilt you feel?" Jarvis asked slowly looking at Steve with a hard look, Steve, on the other hand, was furrowing his brows thinking.
The room if possible became deadly quiet everyone was looking at Howard and Tony, as the two of them were glaring at each other, Maria was leaning on the wall looking at her husband shaking in her place, not believing what she was hearing, looking at her son, she saw the hard expression on his face, it was a miracle he didn't attack Howard and kill him this instead. "You know… I always wondered why you are so cold… I never realized how much of a monster you were until now… I had everything I wanted, I loved him…" Tony hissed as Howard snorted at that.
"Oh, Steve, you are here…" Bruce smiled as he noticed Steve walking toward him; his smile fell as he saw Steve's grim face. "Steve…?" Bruce asked softly making Steve sit on the chair and put his head in his hands. Ever since Bruce tripped over his shoes and landed on Steve Rogers (Don't ask him how, even he doesn't know the answer) the two of them became good friends (Other than the few times Steve thought of him as another type of doctor) it was honestly surprising to see Steve come into his office with such a grim and pale face, it made him concern. "What happened, Steve?" Bruce asked as he closed his files and took his glasses off, taking the role of a therapist, as much as Bruce didn't want to, he knows Steve won't tell anyone anything unless it was him.
"Papa, Tony, I'm home!" Peter called in a cheerful voice out as he came inside the house, a huge grin on his face as he rushed toward the kitchen, which made both Tony and Steve give knowing smiles as they wait for the boy, it was only a few minutes before Peter rushed inside the kitchen with a happy grin. "Papa, Tony, you won't believe it! Uncle Bucky said that everyone gonna come to our house tomorrow, he said there will be a party! Can I invite Harley, please?" Peter hopped around the place, which caused Tony and Steve to gaze at each other for a second a happy smile taking over both of their faces.
How was Tony going to tell the poor soul in front of him that he was dead and that he was haunting Tony's house for the past two months now? A house that Tony bought a year ago because Steve's family ran away from the said house they build. "If you will excuse me, Morgan and I would like to return home, so if you will…" Tony stated, leaving the bed and turning around, planning to make a run for it and jump back in the lake, maybe then he will return back home. God what did Tony get himself into this time, this was insane, Tony was going insane; Tony really should have accepted Rhodey and Pepper's offer of going home with them.
Poor Tony! I'm so sorry baby!
He remembered the warmth and want he felt, and when morning came and the star went to sleep, Tony nearly cried, he wanted to cry because his lucky star just left him alone in the desert without guiding him home, but to his surprise, it was only a few minutes later that Peggy, Bucky, and Rhodey found him, and Tony… Tony's legs gave up and he ended on the sandy floor, gazing at his family with wide eyes, not believing what just happened.
"Steve…?" The woman asked which made Steve blink his eyes at that and tilt his head a little, wondering why the woman was so familiar and why he didn't seem to be able to remember her.
The change of position made the pup whine, but a few seconds later he hides his face in Steven's neck letting out a broken purr in happiness, making the Omega hum a little at that and start walking down the stairs, humming to the boy gentle as he headed to the said boy room, putting him in his bed before covering him with his furs, leaving the room and closing the door after.
Who was Morgan? Steve desperately wanted to ask the man what he meant by these words, who was Morgan and why does she need him? "Morgan… such a beautiful name…" Steve whispered to himself, his hand going to his belly automatically, smiling when he felt the flutter there. "Morgan is a beautiful name, isn't it?" Steve asked no one in particle, just talking to himself and his daughter; the flutter was more noticeable this time causing Steve to let out a chuckle, it seemed that his daughter liked the name a lot…
"Goddammit, Clint! Stop it with these childish games!" Natasha snapped, thinking that it was Clint, as the man usually loved playing pranks on her daily, the woman cursed in Russian as she went to the doll, taking it and throwing it in the garbage can with a huff.
Steven pressed his lips tightly to stop a cruel smile from crossing over his features, thinking about the answer took a few minutes but in the end, Steven turned to gaze at the king with empty eyes. "It does not matter what you think, two of my children died because of you; so if I wanted to blame you, I will." Steven started his words, swallowing as he shuffled around to sit, wondering if he should say the real reason why he hates the man in front of him. "Did you know that I would have given Johann the information he wanted to know about my people just to spar my children? I would have done that, I was close to doing that, but I knew it would not matter in the end." Steven admitted telling the king the secret that he promised to take with him to his grave. "But I promised myself to hold on so that I will take my revenge from you; you, the person who did not have the courage and honor to come when I send you all the information you needed about Johann and his palace, begging you for help as one of your people," Steven whispered, ignoring how the king's eyes widen at his icy words.
It took three hours before everyone left; in those three hours Steve nearly lost his mind with all the boozing around that seemed to happen. Tony had ended up giving the note Steve received and the photo to the police, only to be told that they couldn't legally do anything unless something happened; this nearly made Steve snap and start a screaming match of his own if it wasn't for Bucky holding him back and reassuring him that everything will turn out alright, Steve would have started a damn fight here and now.
The more comments I see, the faster I will update!
Aunt Morticia asked with curiosity coloring her voice. "Extremely." Steve stated, causing the woman to sigh in longing. Not a few seconds later Gomez and Morticia started their daily flirting, getting a giggle from his mother. "Ma, I want to tell you something… I'm in love." Steve sighed, causing the woman to squeal. She was probably happy that he was finally in love, something he always complains about not having time for.
"How 'Slim' are we talking?" Tony asked in a hollow voice, feeling drained and tired and so many other things, like the weight of the world is on his shoulder, crushing him with every whimper and cry from his mate; why? Just why wasn't he the one who took the hit of the poison, why was it Steve? Why is it always Steve?
The next morning did nothing to ease Tony's nerves, nor the night before that when he couldn't even sleep well at all, but Tony was grateful that today was his day off, which meant that he will have the house to himself to think. Kissing Steve and Peter on the cheek while bedding them goodbye as they went to work and school felt somehow like it was the last time he will do it, which made Tony's heart hurt unbearably.
Fury though didn't answer, he just looked at Tony with a knowing look that made the hair on the back of Tony's neck stand on its end. The look Fury was giving Tony, confirmed his suspicions, and Tony wondered if he needed to run away sooner than he thought. But thinking about the phone call two days ago, made Tony still and bite the inside of his cheek, wondering which choice was going to send Tony to his death…
"Yes, trying to protect me by lying and endangering my child's life!" Tony snapped, which caused Natasha to flinch and back away, looking at her shoes once more. "Do you know why I came here, Natasha?" Tony whispered, his tired voice making Natasha raise her head and gaze at Tony whose eyes fell to Morgan, who snuggled into his chest. "I came here to escape the abuse, to save my child from death and people who were going to use her; I came here for a fresh start. I didn't come here to be lied to and mentally abuse! If I wanted that I would have stayed back home and didn't endanger my child's life." Tony hissed, lowering his voice as to not wake up the sleeping girl in his arms with his loud voice.
. Tony blinks his eyes, tilting his head in confusion when he saw himself standing on the deck, when did he walk toward the deck? Tony let out a tired sigh, a sob that was a mix of laughter and a whine left his lips, even when his eyes refused to leave the sight of the lake in front of him.
"I am looking for the rest of my people; do you know where they are housed?" Steven asked which made the Alpha blink at that and nodded his head.
"…I do in fact mind, so No, Miss Carter, you are not allowed to meet our son," Steve said after a while of heavy silence, his words causing Carter to inhale sharply and look at the man with anger coloring her face. "You know that the only way I would allow you to meet my son, is after you are cleared by several psychiatrists and doctors, not to forget the news should arrive through your sister as she confirm herself that you are stable enough to meet Peter; after that, and only after that, I can grant you one visit and that is after Peter, himself, agree to it." Steve reminded the woman causing her to growl under her breath, but a sharp look from Steve silence her.
"My king! What a joyful sight it is to see you after all this time!" Tyber said in a sickly sweet voice when he saw him, bowing with his sister when Anton stood in front of them. Looking around the place Anton notice the servants and guards Tyber brought with him; Anton always wondered why Tyber brought many people to guard him if he was going to stay among friends, now Anton knew why, he was an oath breaker, and an oath breaker wasn't welcomed in any place they go.
For those who asked about Peter's age, he is 10 years old in this fic, and Steve and Tony were apart for eleven years.
P.P.S:- Also many thanks to my friend Stingray! Without Her, this chapter would have never been written at all!
In the year 1987, Tony was kidnapped at the age of sixteen…
"Hey…" Steve whispered to the man when he saw him awake and blinking, his eyes taking in the room with wonder. "Here, drink this; hopefully it will lessen the pain." Steve said as he took a seat near the Alpha, raising the coffee mug from the tray to give it to James, whose eyes never left Steve, even when Steve helped him to sit down and put the mug in his hands. "James?" Steve tilted his head which made the man blink his head and turn to his mug, taking a small sip while letting out a breath of relief at the taste. "Do you prefer cold or hot compress?" Steve asked, thinking that it will be better if he asked the man what he thinks, after all, the Omega didn't want to do more harm than good and trigger and even stronger migraine.
"Mommy, he peed!" Steve remembered hearing a child cry, which made him look down at the puddle of water under him, the woman with the child pale a little as she saw Steve sway with shocked and rushed to help him screaming at the bystanders to call the ambulance.
"You know, you could call me by my name if you want, no one is around, Margaret, or do you prefer Peggy, I heard Angela loved calling you by that name." he hummed with an amused look on his face, causing the Beta to flush and turn her face away from him, as she helped him wash his back.
Everything was doing great, good even… until the TV on his private plane start flickering on and off before someone by the name 'Mandarin' shown on the screen, going on and on about how he hijacked Tony's plane and how he was going to nuke the plane if Tony didn't answer to his demand or whatever. The man even showed Tony a clip of him bombing the plane of the vice-president, which Tony rolled his eyes at, it was only when the news start showing his Malibu mansion burning to the ground that Tony let out a gasp of horror, and he sower if he had pearls he would have clutched them tightly.
Whatever Steve was thinking of, it seemed that he reached a satisfying answer because he changed his direction to Peggy and stand in front of her with his hand extended to her for a dance. Peggy's eyes were wide as she took in Steve who stood in front of her which made Peggy glare dagger at Bucky who laughed nervously and backed away. It took Peggy a few seconds before she took Steve's hand with a smile; her eyes though, were hard as she promised Bucky death and pain when this was over…
"I am not foolish enough to forget that!" Anton snapped, trying to stop himself from doing something even more foolish, like shaking the Omega and scream in his face about how the idiot and foolish one was him and him alone for doing something as stupid as accepting a child as his betroth (And why would Anton become enraged every time he remembered that? shouldn't he forget about the matter already?) "But as you know hunting parties opened to everyone, you cannot stop someone from coming without a good reason, and someone accused to be an oathbreaker is innocent until his guilt is proven." Anton stated, walking outside of his workshop while closing the door behind him, ignoring the thoughtful look the Omega sent his way like he was studying him or something.
" The leader rumbled, once again silencing the room. His voice was husky and held harshness to it, which made Steven tense and pull his child toward his breast harder, afraid to lose him.
It was a few moments later that the salt that had been white even when Rogers was inside the workshop turned black, and a grimace itched itself on Tony's face, it seems that he will be hunted by an Addams for the rest of his life, trying to ignore his A.I.'s words of praise Tony went to change the salt and put the roses in the water, hoping they won't turn into ashes tomorrow…
We met a lot of surprising characters today!
"I will get better, I always do." Steven ends up saying which made Tony frown at that and look at Steven for a long time before he sighed and get a small notebook out of his pocket, he wrote something on a blank piece of paper before ripping it out and giving it to Steven.
Steve walked around Central Park, shaking all the while as he saw people from all Dynamics and ages, sitting in the park, children shaking, not leaving their parents' sides, people searching for their family members, teens running around the place helping people, paramedics, police, the army, all were here leading people to safe places far away from here, away from the battle, and dead bodies, and pain. The Omega didn't know what to do other than walking around the park going far away from the crowded places, wanting to be alone.
It was a few seconds later that the sound of breaking glass, made Tony and Steve flinch, and then Steve let out a shout of alarm when the sound happened once more, but closer this time; turning around Steve's eyes widen when he saw realize the office window lying in broken pieces on the ground. Tony snarled and ran toward the window, looking outside trying to catch the person who threw the rock that was now lying near the bookshelf.
"This is… what you wanted me to be…." Tony fires back, but his voice was too wobbly, he wanted to hold Steve, he wanted the Omega to hold him tightly and never let him go, he wanted the Omega to run his hand through Tony's hair as he used to when the Alpha was too stressed by everything around him, he wanted his Omega back…
"It's… a pleasant… surprise to meet you…" The man murmured as he put his hand in his pocket and pulled a black rose out of nowhere trying to give it to Tony, which made the man look at the rose with an eyebrow-raising, wondering why the man will give him a rose that was meant for a funeral. Tony took a step back away from Rogers who was gazing at him with a dark look in his eyes… and maybe Barnes' death glare as he hissed at Tony when the man dared to look at the rose that Rogers wanted him to have was one of the reasons he decided to turn around and walk out of the room, shivering as he heard a mad cackle coming from inside the room.
Shaking in his place was the only thing that Tony could do as he heard the thud of the door as Carter managed to break it down and enter the room. Tony couldn't help but swallow as he pushed his back to the wall, trying to make himself look smaller as he tried to hide, not making any sound and hoping that Carter would overlook him and leave his house… where was Steve? Was he still in his office like he said when he called him last night or did Carter got him too?
"Yeah… that's a good idea… takeout?" Tony asked which got him hum and a kiss from Steve, causing him to purr happily at how affectionate his Alpha was being more than usual, and his usual was not allowing Tony out of his sight without hundreds of kisses.
"J… is Steve home?" Tony whispered, not knowing why he was whispering but knowing deep down that it was unwise to make any sound. When no answer came from the A.I. after a whole minute, Tony knew that something was deeply wrong and he stood up fast from the bed, his breaths coming in fast puffs as he tried to calm himself, walking slowly out of the room, looking through the hallway before rushing toward his sons' room; praying that if someone was in, they haven't reached his babies.
At night Antonette will tell him stories from her imagination, she will whisper how he came to her and saved her from her mad husband, how he will take her away from all the pain and how they will fly in the skis together forever, how he will never hurt her, how she loved him. "Sir Steven… that will be your name from now on, such a beautiful and noble name..." Antonette said one night out of blue, and he stopped breathing for a second.
"Hello love, how are you today?" Steven hummed as he lowered himself and bought James in his embrace, which made the small Alpha purr happily and snuggles into his mother's breast, taking in his mother calming scent, making him hum and let out a sleepy yawn, which made the Omega chuckle at the six-year and pushed him a little bit tidying his hair and caressing his cheek.
If the room was deadly silent before, it was even more now; because everyone's faces paled at Tony's words, everyone was shaken in place at the hysterical way Tony was losing it. "His… bride?" Peggy choked the word out, the look on her face was one of disgust and horror, informing Tony of the line of thoughts everyone was operating on.
"Just this once, foolish king…" Steven finally managed to choke out after what felt like forever, taking the Shield away from the Alpha and inhaling when he felt like a lost limb was back after many years passed. "If you repeated what happened early that day, the next time I will not be that forgiven, I will kill you," Steven warned, getting a nod from the king, which ended with him huffing. "You are an idiot for not listening to me… and I am staying away for the next fortnight," Steven stated with his head raised high, turning away from the Alpha as he continued to his people's house with his heart pounding loudly in his chest, many different emotions were coursing through him at the thought of him getting his Shield back after years of pain and suffering…
"… R-Rogers?" Tony asked, unsure when he opened the workshop's door, tilting his head a little to gaze at the person that greeted him on the other end. It was clearly Rogers, but he wasn't wearing any black, leather, or his tactic gears, instead, he was wearing a white button-down with blue slacks, his slightly long hair was slicked back showing his blue eyes and face, and in his hands were a bouquet of roses, actual roses, not only the steams, but with roses attached to them. Tony had to admit, the man was handsome; he looked like a… a normal person, a handsome normal person, but seeing Rogers like this after getting used to the creepy version of him is almost concerning.
"Oh, this? That's also a tree, little one." Steve said when he saw pointing at a tree with yellow leaves, considering it was fall, Steve had a small fleeting thought that everything was going to get mixed for the small pup, which sadly proven to be true, when the pup frown at Steve's answer, and looked out of the window to look at another tree.
"P-Pepper Potts…" The woman answered shakily which made Steven narrow her eyes at her, he already knows that the woman was not the type to change her last name after marriage; she didn't even change her name when she married Tony, so he didn't take that as a fact.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, heartbreak, angst, crying, maybe a little fluff? Tony crying his eyes out while Steve being a protective AF! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
It was only when the door finally closed behind them that pieces of clothes start flying around the place as the two of them stumbled back toward the bed, their mouths refused to part as they kissed to their heart content. Tony never knew what unlocked the fever in them last night, but whatever it did, it made Steve more feverish, hot, refusing to let Tony out of his sight for a second, refusing to part for anything unless he was touching any part of Tony.
So Anthony changed the way he acted, and the world around him changed the way the saw him in, he became popular, people either wanted to be like him or were jealous of him, he went out parting all night, drinking like his father, when usually he always hated alcohol and parting, he acted like every rich bastard, showing people who was the superior, who was the boss, and some people loved him for that, they fell on their knees and bowed for him, even his father and Stane looked at him with a little pride in their eyes when he acted like he was the king… it made Anthony feel disgusted. It made his skin crawl when he had to sleep with another celebrity, it made him contain his disgust as he swallowed another mouthful of whatever alcohol was present in front of him, it made him try to stop himself from feeling bored every time he was forced to gamble in Vegas because that's what rich people do, they throw their money left and right without care in the world.
"Our room? No! We are not going to our room until you tell me where you have been! Did you know that I had to leave in the middle of an important meeting because you didn't stop calling me? Do you know what you did? I had one job, and that was to make Wakanda Enterprises sign a contract with us, one damn job, and you ruin it with your constant calling! And when I'm finally home, you tell me you were out without even telling me where! What the fuck, Steve?" Steve had to bite the inside of his cheek to stop a sob that wanted to get out, he never felt this small, not since he was fifteen years old nothing, who lived with a drunk and abusive father.
Harley narrowed his eyes when he saw the woman finally knocking on the door of their home, making Harley furrow his eyebrows when he saw the woman nearly entered their house when Mr. Tony opened the door to her. Harley saw how Tony frowned harshly as he closed the door behind him causing Harley to clinch his hands when he saw the woman trying to cage Mr. Tony.
Steve frown as his gaze fell on the envelope; Steve couldn't help but blink his eyes, a little surprised and confused, wondering from where did the envelop came. Steve was sure he shut and locked the doors and windows when he got out of the car; he was sure that when he went to see Natasha there was no envelope in the car, unlike now.
"Hello Ma'am, my name is Steve Rogers," Rogers said in the most normal voice, which made Tony's eyes widen, especially when Pepper giggled a little and took the man's extended hand and shook it before giving her name… so this was how he brainwashed his victims? Acting all nice and coy? The fuck? Tony whimpered at that as he shook Pepper, hoping that the woman would snap out of it, but it was no use, it was like trying to move a mountain… Pepper didn't give him any thought as she continued to talk with Rogers, something that made Tony tear up… he destroyed Pepper's life!
Steven hummed to himself as he opened the library doors, freezing in his place when he saw huge dogs/wolves? In the library, but what made him give a manly scream so loud that he was sure even the dead in Antarctica heard him (Scream not screech, thank you very much) is that the two wolves were actually fucking and were growling and biting each other. At the sound of his voice, the two wolves turned toward him, and Steven stiffens when the huge two meters blond wolf turn to him and growl while hiding the smaller one of the two under him… Steven wondered if he will be able to back away slowly and disappear without having something from him getting eaten, he wondered how these wolves even got here, I mean shouldn't the mansion be secured against such a thing?
The splashing coming from the lake made Anton still in his place, wondering if there was someone other than him who knew about the hidden lake (Which was unlikely, considering that Anton didn't see anyone come near this place ever since Mantta was built) and decided to use it for a swim. Anton could only frown, wondering if his journey here was for nothing; running his hand over his beard, Anton let out a huff as he walked toward the lake, deciding to take off his fur coat and take the swim he came here for. So what if someone came to take a swim before him? A harsh glare from Anton would shut even the chattiest person who wanted to get close to Anton. Taking his tunic off, Anton throws the tunic on the ground near his fur coat, taking the last few steps to break through the tree line toward the lake, hoping to take a nice dip in the water without being pestered by anyone.
"No, baby, no, that's not true," Tony whispered, looking at Steve who stood up and came beside them, crooning softly as he pulled both Tony and Harley into his arms. "You are our baby, sweetheart, why would you think something nasty like that?" Tony murmured, kissing Harley's forehead, causing the boy to whine as he held Tony tightly.
"What is the catch?" The Omega asked, already knowing that the Alpha wouldn't have given him such a generous offer without wanting something in return, and Steven tensed a little, already knowing what the Alpha wanted, what
(See the end of the chapter for
5-Essentially a marriage in Vikings' age was nothing but a business contract between two families. A marriage was arranged in two stages: the betrothal and the wedding. The initiative had to come from the man or his father, who would propose marriage to the woman's father or guardian. If the latter was agreeable, the groom promised to pay the bride price (Mundr). In Iceland the minimum payment was 8 ounces of silver; in Norway, it was 12. In return, the bride's father promised to hand over her dowry at the wedding. Both the bride price and the dowry remained the property of the bride after the wedding. The two men shook hands on the agreement in front of witnesses and agreed on a date for the wedding, usually within a year. The woman's consent to the marriage might be sought but it was not necessary. That's why Tony thought Steve was crazy for agreeing to marriage without any witness to confirm the agreement or have money to pay for the dowry. Not only that but widows in medieval usually wait three years before remarrying (The ideal waiting time) though every individual is different and could remarry if and when they decide to do so.
"No!" Tony shrieked, managing to unfroze as rushed toward Morgan, pulling her away before Steven manages to touch her, he ignored the shocked look on the ghost (Can Tony even call him a ghost?) as he turned around and start running away from the room, his heart was pounding so madly that Tony thought it will jump out of his chest any moment now. Tony had to leave the house, now, before the ghost behind him does something to Morgan.
Tony did so well this year; he was able to make a little family for himself with an understanding and loving Alpha, and an amazing pup, who considered Tony as a parent to him, so why will Tony destroy all of that just because he saw some freakish comic that might as well have been coincident?
"Hopeful…" Tony ends up saying which made Winnie laugh happily at that and hug the Omega tightly toward her, which made the Omega give a halfhearted protest as the dirt that clings to Winnie from working in her garden transformed into his suit.
And a long chapter to say how much sorry I was for taking too long to update!
Steven woke up with a choked gasp, his eyes wild and frighten as he darted from one place to another; trying to find the threat that will come toward his children and take them away from him. "James…" Steven's voice cracked as he sits up from his lying position, terror taking over him when he didn't see his son anywhere near him. Steven's heart nearly stopped beating; the fear of Johann returning back from beyond to take James from him to Hel is too much. "James!" Steven tried to call his son once again, hoping that his voice was loud enough to call his babe back, but unfortunately, his voice was faint.
"Sorry, I mean lifts, where are they?" Steven asked just to be a little shit, which gained him a growl and a pout from the Omega, before mumbling something under his breath that even Stevens super hearing didn't catch. Whatever embarrassing information Steven was going to share, it was forgotten due to the explosion that shook the place. Steven pushed Tony away, ordering him to follow the people out and run to get his suit from the car. When Tony was out of his sight, Steven let out a choked growl of pain when he felt a needle being thrust in his neck. It was only a few seconds before everything turned dark.
"Oh, Anthony you are back!" Tony looked at the owner of the voice only to see Winnie smiling at him happily and waving him over, Tony smiled at the woman and walked toward her crossing the road that separated their houses from each other. "How did your appointment go dear?" Winnie asked him once he reached her, making Tony smile a little.
The thought of that foolish defenseless pregnant Omega with a too big mouth in the middle of the brawl and his overprotective babe who was probably trying to protect him, made Starkad's Alpha let out a deafening roar inside of his head that nearly made Starkad stumble, but the Alpha righted himself and rushed toward where he was hearing the snarling and growling, informing him that he was close.
Aunt Peggy's voice made Tony sob relieve. "A-aunt Peggy!" Tony said in a shaky voice.
star. That poor star whose only sin was catching the attention of Thanos, the star that Thanos decided will be his queen when his time to rule arrives, the stars who dare to not gaze at the birth of Odin's son, planting the idea in her father's head, the idea that the star will stand with her father in his impossible quest. Nebula doesn't even know if she pities the star or wishes for its death, either way, as soon as Thanos catch up to the star, it will be over for everyone in the universe.
"I will go…" Steve said making Peggy and Howard look at him. "I will find him, Howard, I promise…" Steve put his hand on Howard's shoulder making the older man bit his lip but nod his head at that.
The frantic knocking of the door caused Steve to flinch, the fear of it being his stalker made Steve shakes in the tube without leaving the tube to investigate the knocking. It was only when Steve heard Sam and Natasha's voice that he stood up and rushed toward the door, tears were running down his face when he opened the door and saw his friends' pale faces gazing at him…
"I have stolen nothing, I am stating a fact." Steve grin a cocky grin as he raised his hand and trail it down Tony's neck and chest, making the inventor shiver and let out a sigh at the heavenly treatment, he could only hum and let out a stuttering sigh when Steve's lips start trailing down his neck and chest.
They walked for a few more minutes, with Tony thinking about upgrading his armor to withstand the Addams' creepiness, and Steve… well, Steve was probably thinking about creepy stuff and the souls he will torture next. "If I… if I stopped doing the torture in front of you and did it behind you without you witnessing it, will you allow me to court you?" Tony blinked and turned around to gaze at Steve who was giving him a hopeful look.
“Wakabi, I told you to stand down. T’Challa’s dead and I’m your leader now. Return to your quarters,
Nebula places her elbow on her armrest and rests her chin on the back of her hand. “But he is okay with his friend killing your parents.”
His eyes flicker over to Nebula, just once, he can’t help himself, and when he sees the pity her black eyes hold, he wishes he’d kept his eyes closed.
Tony takes a step back, towards the exit. “Wow, okay, I’ve got nothin’.” He gestures for Nebula to follow him. “Let’s go then. Friday, land us, please.”
“Would you stop for a second?” Tony begs, feigning weariness to hide his gnawing frustration. He sighs, annoyed that he’s lost his temper yet again today, and softens his voice a little, tries to reel himself in. “Our world has fallen to pieces. Agent Ross and the other people handling the Accords are probably long gone. If a building didn’t fall on them in New York, there’s a great chance they were wiped by Thanos. That means we all need to
“This isn’t Earth? Quill is from Earth,” she says, mostly to herself, before she steps back to let Tony stick his head inside the old car to see if there are keys inside.
Tony frowns at her from the jet’s entrance. “I tell you I’ve created artificial intelligence and you don’t bat an eye, but
here,” Tony says, mimicking her posture. When Shuri mashes her lips together in a fine line, Tony exhales loudly. “Look, I’m a friend of Steve’s. I’m also the number one financial support system of the Avengers. I have a right to know where there are.”
“Boss, we’re officially fifteen minutes away from Wakanda.”
Nebula just nods, taking it all in.
Ever the combatant, Friday stalls with, “Boss, I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
“Was he your child?”
Shuri stares at her, blank-faced, and then Tony realizes he’ll have to translate. He repeats what Nebula said, this time in English.
I’m ninety percent metal. I can handle whatever’s waiting for us down there.”
“Together,” Steve echoes.
“You watched your offspring turn to ash in your own arms. You’re already crazy.” Nebula isn’t trying to push any buttons, she’s really not. She just can’t stop talking. She’d rather at pick someone else’s festering wounds than acknowledge her own.
Nebula sighs, at a loss for words, and shakes her head. Tony wonders if his drama is too messy for her, the unfortunate daughter of Thanos who was broken and repaired too many times to count.
Nebula is quiet for a moment before she nods. “I understand. You said he killed your parents, this friend of Steve’s?”
Nebula smacks her cheeks, pinches her thigh, but the pain won’t go away. The damage has been remembered, the floodgates have opened, and so her only option is to take a deep breath before she drowns.
“Calm down, Pete, it wasn’t that funny,” Tony says despite how he’s grinning like a fool because Peter laughing has got to be his favorite sight in the world second to Steve Rogers sweaty after a battle and Pepper naked in bed.
Tonton was bright, and he had his whole life in front of him, ready to take the world by storm, but what broke his heart was that Tonton was betrayed by the closest person to him, and was killed for it, the boy was no older than fifteen summers when he was killed by his uncle, it was cruel, it was heartless, and Tonton's head was put on a stake to the whole tribe to see, as the people cried and wailed for the boy and for the dark fate waiting for them.
They chatted with Angie for a while before they finish, Tony went to the counter to deal with the bill; only to have Angie glaring at him like a disappointed mother and telling him that everything was on the house, pushing a foil of wrapped food toward him with a threatening look on her face that caused even Pepper and Rhodey to shift in their places. "Thank you." Tony whispered, taking in the bag that Angie handed to him with a shy smile, knowing that he can't win against Angie no matter how much he put his mind into it, he tried to ignore how Pepper and Rhodey were smiling smugly, happiness radiating from their expressions.
Hope you enjoy this chapter!
It started with Tyber and his sister's manipulating nature; the two of them were so desperate to try and twist the queen's tale, that the two of them started to give outlandish accusations. So outlandish that everyone started to doubt their honesty, which was nothing but a joy to those who wanted this play to end. It started with the queen's want for justice and revenge on the oathbreaker, that the Omega agreed to an alliance between Anton and him not caring for the consequences as much as caring about the results. As for Anton, the Alpha was thrown in the middle of this, not for the lack of trying mind you, but because Anton was being pulled between two opposing forces that tried to win his favor… well, one of the forces (Tyber) was trying to win his favor, as for the other (Steven), Anton was the one who forced himself on to try and win him, which gained Anton nothing but a twitch of an eye. Strange accordance, but not that unwelcomed.
"I am not dancing with a woman; I am dancing with Tony," Steve stated as he took his position once more, waiting for Bucky to get ready for another dance. Bucky pout at the words Steve spook, sending a glare to Peggy who was smiling smugly and recording the whole thing, the look on her face was that of a cat who was enjoying herself as she toyed with the canary in her grip.
"OK, I don't want to be a killjoy or anything because that's so against me, but what the hell was that and why does it sound like my mother?!" That was Tony who squeaked and looked at the ceiling with a suspicious face a little pale at the thought of his mother knowing Steve's full name… maybe that traveler Steve was right and that he was dead, because why would the voice of his dead mother knows his name if he wasn't dead already?
Maria wondered if she can have the courage to get out of the car, she wondered if she could go toward the house and knock on the door and introduce herself to her grandchild and Tony's Omega, but every time she put her hand on the car handle to open the door she freezes in her place not knowing what to do… secretly she was thanking to Happy, for the Beta didn't rush her or do anything of that sort, he was just waiting for her to decide on her own… the house's door was opened, and an Omega got out which made the pup look at the Omega and stand up when the Omega told him something, rushing toward the house, while the Omega was still outside, it made Maria's breath hitch a little especially when the Omega looked at her from his place, she didn't know what to do, frozen in her place with the Omega's icy stare, but then the Omega turns away from her and returned to the house which made Maria sigh in disappointment.
It was a few minutes of coughing and hacking and for Jarvis to try and air the kitchen before Tony managed to look up, glaring with his teary eyes at Loki who was smirking mischievously. A groan behind Loki pulled Tony's attention from the God, and Tony's eyes couldn't help but widen in shock, this time the tears that clouded his eyes were not from the green mist, but because of the person who was leaning on the wall clutching his head in pain. "Steve!" Tony cried out, running toward Steve, hoping against hope that this was not a cruel dream he was seeing, that Steve was here with him.
' and an arrogant Alpha that the Omega wouldn't mind showing him his place, but actually, the Alpha's request was not a hardship, so the Omega shrugged and nodded his head. "Where is your family, princess? I am sure they would have searched for you high and low, especially with those runes." The Alpha said as he pointed to the Omega's covered arm, making the Omega look away from the Alpha, his hands tightening on the mug once more.
This time Bucky's voice came from his left side which made Steve let out a confused noise and turn to the side, only to blink his eyes in shock when he realized that he was in a car… he was in a car and Bucky was driving… how? A gentle laugh left Steve's lips, causing his heart to pick up at how his body seemed to be acting on its own without Steve's input.
"You are a fool, Anton!" Jamti hissed as the two of them rode their horses, side by side, the rest of the hunting party was behind them, talking with each other and ignoring the two of them, that if you didn't count Tyber who was trying to talk with Anton for the past ten minutes but get ignored and growled at by both Jamti and Anton; for the tenth time in many minutes, Anton only sigh, whispering
It was two weeks since Tony's heat ended, two weeks of being anxious and jittery that his father finally had enough and send him home for a month to bond with his new family member last he blew up the workshops in SI (Everyone was so grateful to have anxious Tony out of the labs, that they begged Howard to make it two months. As if Tony was going to let them ruin his projects!) two weeks of him and Steve doing every last minute thing they possibly forgot and completing Harley's room with a few more touches here and there, not knowing what a twelve years old would like.
Steve could only stare at his hands in shock, his mind refusing to make a sense of what he was told a few hours ago; part of Steve was still thinking that he was crazy, that this was all just a dream, and that he would wake up once more in the bathroom, fearing for his life as his stalker knocked on the door to scare him. Johann Schmitt, that's the name of the man who stalked him, a known serial killer and rapist, who targets male Omegas, was shot and killed when the police managed to come just in time... A stalker who managed to stay hidden for over eight years ago was caught and killed yesterday.
Needless to say, everyone went crazy, either because Tony was going to marry the most handsome man alive (Which ended with Tony getting a lot of threatening letters ordering him to leave Steve) or because they refuse for the Merchant of Death to marry into the Addams family and increase his evilness and statue (Really? People still consider him, an evil person and ongoing arm dealer after all the times he nearly sacrificed his life protecting them?) It was madness, it was hell, and Tony had half a mind running away to the hills, leaving Steve and everyone else just to gain his sanity back.
"It is… it is not like that…" Peggy's words trailed as if she wasn't even sure when she gave her answer, which more than anything made Tony shift in his place, getting uncomfortable by the confirmation he just gained. Tony doesn't really know what to do with that kind of confirmation other than trying to hide his wince.
Part of Steve was a little pissed that it took a terrorist attack for Tony to get himself together, but another part of Steve was content and happy to have his mate back once more, his mate who finally start involving himself in Steve and their daughter's life. "Good… morning…" Tony murmured behind Steve, nuzzling the back of Steve's neck before the Alpha started rumbling deep in his chest, the scent of Mate/Happy/Safe, made Steve sighed and his muscle relaxed further.
Tony examined the box in royal blue color, nibbling at his lower lip, wondering if he should open the box; after all, it was his, right? It was an engagement ring, right? Steve was going to ask him, right? Or maybe Tony was overthinking things again, and this box was nothing but a gift from either Steve’s editor or one of his fans, or maybe it was Bucky who gave Steve the box, in hope of protecting it from his mother, which actually is more possible with how insane Winnie was about Bucky settling down.
The ride was silent, but Steve was fuming on the inside after reading the letter from Howard Stark, the fucker really thought that he can come and take his baby away from him; the fucker even had the guts to call Child Services on him! Steve will make sure that the fucker will wish that he didn't cross his road ever again.
Steve doesn't know how long he stayed in the gardens watching the children play and have the time of their lives; what snapped him out of his somber mood was the soft voice that called his name, causing Steve to blink his eyes and turn to the side to see the person who called his name. The sight that greeted Steve caused him to pause and tilt his head in confusion; the woman standing in front of him was familiar, she was so familiar with her short dark brown hair and blue-grey eyes. What made Steve's breath hitch was the child in the woman's arms, probably six months old or younger than that, seeing the child, a whine nearly left Steve as his heart sized up, pain and longing warring inside him.
"Are you sure?" Tony asked which made the pup nod his head proudly. "No cake, soda, or candy?" Tony asked as the two of them reached the kitchen raising the pup a little so he will sit on the kitchen stool as he went to get the ingredient out to make lunch for both of them. The pup shake his head at Tony's words which made the Omega smile a little at that, Clint's kid would have asked that he make them a triple chocolate cake by now, but it seems that the small pup isn't interesting in that. "Why?" Tony asked intrigued as he put the ingredient on the counter looking at the pup with a smile.
So other than a failed attempt to destroy his and his husband's marriage and happiness; the idiot had painted a target on his back that everyone from Steve and Tony to Serpentine was chasing. Personally, Tony wasn't even in a rush to find the fool, he knew his husband would bring him by the end of the night so the two of them would enjoy torturing him before throwing him into the shark tank.
"How old are you?" The Alpha asked with an interested tone, making the Omega huffed, though the Alpha did nothing but smirk and hide it behind his cup when he took a sip… the queen was an almost pleasant company when he wasn't screaming threats or give him sarcastic remarks that made his blood boil.
Tony let out a sigh as he reached the building, checking in his suitcase once more, he then put his hand in his suit pocket to see if the slip of paper that Clint gave him last night was still there, Clint told him that the person whose name Tony had because of the Coulsons will be able to help Tony with finding something about his son, he assured him he will, he was the best in his field. A year passes, with Tony doing the same routine, again and again, he worked with SI, he helped with the Omegas' clinic, he invents, helped with the support group, search for his pup, and have a get together in his house every week for his friends, Tony wondered since when his house became the heart of the neighborhood, probably when Winnie and Clint took a shining toward him.
The next morning everyone was sitting in the dining room when Jarvis served breakfast… blueberry pancakes… Steve saw the shock and sadness on every face… Maria rushed out of the room, Howard pushed his plate and stood up, Peggy sighing and followed him out, as for Angie, she throws her plate at the wall and throws Jarvis a glare while leaving the room. Jarvis sighs and shook his head a little and went to clean the mess Angie left, only to see Steve already cleaning the mess.
He was dying, Tony knew he was, the thing that kept him alive was slowly poisoning him, he knew that after six months of him being back, Stane was finally dead and his father was forced to do what Tony wanted if he didn't want a scandal to happen, Tony turned into Iron Man caused SI's stock to rise, which was probably the reason why his father was that docile, or probably it was because Tony lunch his first invention after the weapon manufacturing stopped, a robotic limb that was the perfect replacement, but even with all of his intelligent, Tony couldn't find a replacement core that wouldn't poison him.
Steven paused in his walk back with a frown on his face. "When was the last time?" Steven thought to himself with furrowed brows, wondering when the last time he bleeds was… continuing the days, Steven pales as he discovered that he was a week late, a week late and his heat was a month ago and he didn't bleed after it… suddenly the fatigue and nausea made since, his want for more food but always stopping himself last the king discovered he was using more than normal while making food, him always looking at the lining and soft clothes wondering which was the softest to make a nest… Steven shook his head and gave a nervous laugh at that, he was probably paranoid, probably got the numbers wrong, and that he will start bleeding today because there was no way… no way!
Steve huffed a laugh as he got out of the car and to his house, a huge grin taking a place over his face as he reached the door, opening it and humming a little to himself, feeling elation that he was finally able to put Howard Stark in his place after all these years. The only regret Steve had was that he didn't do this sooner, and if given the chance he will do it once more, but that thought was for another time because for now, he has to return to his home and give his baby the tightest hug out there. Steve reached the door toward his house, opening the door with his keys and then went inside closing the door behind him, a skip in his steps as he went toward the sound of laughter, smiling happily when he saw Peter playing with Ben and George, May was talking happily with Winnie and Becca, probably telling them about the first time she met Steve and the years after it.
Steven sighed as he looked around Asgard, taking in the places with wondering eyes, smiling when he saw the children run around the place laughing happily as they rushed to play a game only they know about. It left Steven sad to see that this Asgard was destroyed in his world, that all the people here died because of Hela and Thanos, that the old, young, and babes, were killed just for existing, a fate that made Steven rage… he still remembered Thor's hollow eyes as he gazes at what left of his people, only one hundred survivors, while millions died on that ship. The Asgardian never recovered, even in the new Asgard, even on an island far away to the north, they still distrust everyone who looked their way, even after thirty years and a lot of births and people trying to hold themselves together for their children… the Asgardian still grieved, especially when Thor left them with Val because, by the end of the day, Thor was the last royal from the royal family, their last link to their home.
There was a knock on the door before it opened to show Colonel Rhodes who looked like hell warmed him over, Fury was behind him looking annoyed especially when the Colonel pushed the spy away and rushed inside of the room. "Where is Tony? Is he OK?" The colonel asked as he entered the room, considering that he wasn't told anything after Tony directs the missile into the portal, he was strung tight.
The first time Steve saw Anthony again; his son was six months old. It wasn't really seeing him per se, that day a talk show had interviewed him, because in the last year or so, his fame has increased. When Steve saw him, he had to smile a little, as much as Steve will want to hate the Anthony he couldn't, he loved the man too much to hate him, and maybe that was a misjudge on his part, but he couldn't help it.
does." Howard grimaces at the word 'love' causing Steve to let out a pained laugh.
The wind suddenly picked up, causing Tony to let out a relieved sob, his body shaking hard as he tried to stop himself from spiraling down and start crying in an ugly fashion when he saw Rogers breaking through the lake surface. "Dear lord…" Howard's voice trailed off, causing Tony to let out a shuddered breath as he slammed his head back, catching Howard off guard as he slammed the back of his head into the older man's nose.
"As my husband wishes…" Steve said, leaning down to steal a kiss from Tony, ignoring the way the Omega let out a few more protests at the thought of morning breathes and heavy Alphas and being hungry as hell so Steve should hurry. Seeing his Alpha's naked body on display as Steve stood up, made Tony give an appreciated whistle at the amazing sight in front of him; which to be honest only gain him a laugh from his Alpha as he headed to the kitchen.
"You won't believe it, Pepper, it was horrible!" Tony whined as he threw himself at the sofa that groaned at the weight of the armor but thankfully didn't break, which made Tony fill a thought in his mind about buying one of those sofas in his workshop. "Barnes forced me to house his supposed dead friend from seventy years ago! And he is an Addams! My life is ruined Pepper, my house is ruined, my beautiful gardens are ruined, and now I have a Pet Cemetery in my house and voodoo dolls running around the place! Please, Pepper, help!" Tony squeaked as he looked at the woman with wide, pleading eyes, waiting for it to click in the woman's mind.
"Oh no bambino, no, it wasn't your fault, I should have told you why you are not allowed in the room, it's not your fault Peter." Tony cuddled the boy close to his chest which got him a small sniff and a nod from the boy, the teary eyes broke Tony, for the Omega never ever wanted to see the baby in his arms with such a sad look, he never wanted to see the pain and doubt on his face. "Tell you what, bambino, why don't we go to the zoo today? Me, you, and your Papa? I am sure the three of us will enjoy our day off, we can even eat out today." Tony put on a false cheer as he said those words, he wanted nothing but to hide in his room in his bed today but seeing his Peter look so crushed was the only thing that shook the Omega out of his pity party. The boy was his, as much as the baby in his belly was, and Tony will not accept making the child sad at any cause.
Rhodey licked his lips trying to remember furrowing his brows until he realized the missing link… he should have known… "In 1999, Howard came to Tony about the presentation in Japan, he practically ordered Tony to go, saying all the while that if the Alpha did it right he will be officially the CEO, Tony didn't care about that, but the money he will get will be what he needs so his plan will go into action… when he returned after a month the Omega had already left, took his clothes and possession with him, and Tony said he saw his ID sitting on the table the one that said he was a Stark, not the fake one he made Jarvis make him, his father came into his apartment after an hour of Tony's return telling him about how the Omega practically blackmailed him for money… I should have believed Tony when he told me that the Omega wouldn't do such a thing, but I just thought it was like Sunset's situation all over again and brushed it off… Tony searched for the Omega for two months after that, until he received a letter from him… I don't know what the letter said exactly but I am sure it said nasty things because shortly after that he starts drinking and sleeping around…" Rhodey said looking at his feet trying to think of what's going to happen, wondering if the Omega was dead, wondering if the pup was dead or was giving to another family, or worse.
"What's dat, Mama?" Peter asked as he looked outside of the window pointing at the big thing with small green papers attached to it, it made Tony sigh a little in sadness and kiss his head and look outside of the window, it hurt him deeply that his son had to ask what a tree was, never having the chance to go outside once in his small life until now that is.
The man gave Steve a sad smile before turning to walk away but not before throwing these words over his shoulder, leaving Steve more confused than ever. "Vu are ein kood man, Schteffen, vu schouldn't pe here...
(See the end of the chapter for
Time trickled away from Steven's grasp as Petrus continued to cry in his lap, getting comforted by both him and James; in the end, the little pup falls asleep, hugging Steven's mid-section and laying his head near Steven's wrist, taking in his comforting scent that caused Petrus to let out broken purrs. "You seemed to like him, are you two friends?" Steven asked, turning his gaze toward his son who was yawning.
Unfortunately, being in the tower meaning that he has to do his paperwork; something that he hates to kingdom come, he still didn't crack the secret of how his paperwork clones themselves under his desk. But doing his paperwork meaning not seeing Steve or his teammates, and that meant that Tony could finally rest in peace and eat his food without fearing that it was poisoned; which was a treat for his scared little heart.
The video was cut leaving everyone in silence that took place; Bucky could do nothing but ask for the address once again, leaving the room when the AI gave him the address.
Steven just hummed and turns his attention to the small boy who was pouting at missing the chance to play pillow fight, Steven gave him a small smile that made the boy flush and shy behind the woman from before. "Say is your name Petrus?" Steven asked, already remembering a lifetime ago where Anton was a chieftain of his own tribe and had a small boy named Petrus… sadly the boy died from fever when he was six years old in human time… he remembers how broken Anton was that day... Petrus was his favorite out of Anton's children…
So after agreeing on keeping the baby, Tony argues with himself about who to tell first, obviously his father was out, because let's face it, his father will worry too much about him, he will end up telling Stane and that bastard will end up manipulating his father against him, so his father was out of the picture, for now, that is. Rhodey was also out, mainly because he doesn't know where the Alpha was stationed, and because the Alpha would blame himself for what happened to Tony if he knew that the Omega got pregnant on the day of his party. And because Jarvis and his mother were dead (God rest their souls in peace) and he already told Dummy and his AI the great news. That left Pepper, who was supposed to return from her job interview right about now.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, a little bit of angst, Tony finally apologizing, and Fury is here! All reviews are appreciated...
Steven could only press his lips tightly together as he continued to hear the whispers around him increasing once more, forcing him to let out a harsh breath through his nose, especially when he saw a finger or two pointing in his direction. "Mama! The bear, I want to see it, please!" James called out, pulling at Steven's pants and causing the Omega to smile at the babe, not wanting to stay here longer, even if it meant disappointing his pup.
"I don't know to be honest…" Steve said after a while of silence, smiling at Jarvis who sat on the chair near the bed. "I mean, on one hand, this is my entire fault, if I just suck it up after the war if I just… didn't crash the plane this wouldn't have happened, I would have been here to stop Stane and Hydra earlier… on the other hand, my Alpha seemed attached to the pup and his mother, thinking of them as a family, chanting that I shouldn't be away from them… it's a mess." Steve sighed at that looking at the ceiling hearing Jarvis sigh.
Tony hummed to himself as he walked through the hallways of his house, planning on going out to the gardens, the only place he refused to let Rogers be in, not wanting the man to poison his flowers. He grimaced the whole way when he saw bloody words of threats written on the wall, and he was sure that he saw a creepy doll or two running down the hallways with scissors in their plushy hands as they give childish giggles, making the hair on Tony's neck stand on end… he always hated dolls…
Tony was only grateful that he didn't lock the door when he decided to play with Morgan outside; it meant that Tony had easy access to the house before Rogers managed to catch him. slamming the door and locking it on, Tony curse how stupid he was for going inside the house, a house that Rogers knew the inside and the out like the back of his hand, a house that even when locked Rogers managed to enter without permission needed.
Seven months pregnant, Tony was feeling down, not only was he expecting a child he doesn't want, but he was forced to stay behind as the Avengers made their move on Hydra. Rhodey and Pepper visit him from time to time, Jarvis and Anna were the ones who stayed behind to take care of him, but even with all of that he was feeling left behind, unwanted. He felt like he made the biggest mistake of his life and that he was the idiot who destroyed everyone's trust in him, even when Steven, tell him otherwise.
"Ah, so you finally arrived home, Tony." A bored voice answered, and Tony tried not to flinch at the dark undertone the words were spoken held. The man in question let out an annoyed sigh when Tony didn't answer him, leaning back on the armchair behind him as he gazed around the place. "I admit you have made yourself a very nice… place. But the time of you playing house is over, I'm sure if we go back home your father won't be angry… much." Obadiah stated as he stood up, his action finally snapping Tony out of his frozen state.
The workshop's door was knocked on, causing Anton to blink and turn his head to where the sound came from, wondering if Magna or Jamti were on the other side of the door. Walking toward the door, Anton stilled when he smelled the scent coming from behind the door, making his hands clenched into fists and for him to swallow the growl that wanted to be let out. "Open the door, foolish king, I know you are inside." The queen called out, causing Anton to bite his lower lip hard until he tasted blood.
"I am sorry…" Tony said only to wince at Peggy's hiss. "I noticed the rings when I was here the other day… it wasn't like any metal I know so I just… I swear I just borrow it and I would have returned it, I just made JARVIS do a little scanning is all!" Tony said not looking at his aunt who was glaring at the back of his head, but what really made him feel like he was the lowest of the low was the anguish look on Steven's face as he inspect the rings, lips wobbling as he saw a small nick that Tony accidentally made because of his aunt barging in his lab.
"If… if you managed to handle it for so long, then why? Why did you leave him?" Tony asked, wondering how Angie managed to find her way here, wondering how she even managed to find this town that no one knew about, how did she manage to fool her husband long enough for her to run away? He wanted to know why she would run away if she managed to live like that for sixteen years. Tony can sympathize; Tony knew why he had to run away from home, he did it so his baby was going to live. If he never got pregnant with Morgan, Tony knew that he would have married Stane; he knew he would have handled his abuse just like he handled Howard's. For him, it was the arrival of Morgan that changed everything.
Tony sighed in content as he smelled the scent of his pup, without sickness and death surrounding it. His baby always smelled like freshly cut grass and rain, it always made Tony hold tightly into his son to smell the scent of the outside, of the small pleasures he always adored as a teen, it always made him feel home. It had been three weeks since he was out of Stane's clutch, Tony still couldn't believe it, he is afraid that if he closed his eyes any second now he will return to the cell, seeing his baby dying before his eyes, but every time he close and open his eyes he was here, in the hospital, with his baby contently sleeping in his arms.
"I'm going crazy Peggy…" He said with hitched breath… "Always hearing that singing, ever since I woke up… it just won't stop, it cried, it begged, it shrieked and wailed, and… and… I'm going crazy…" His voice cracked. It had made Peggy look at him with a heartbroken look, it made her give a sigh calling herself stupid for not noticing earlier… she made him sit and explains that what Steve was experiencing was a rear type of bond so rear it said it doesn't exist, that Steve had a fated mate out there, and the singing he heard was just their voice… it made Steve give a hollow and crazy laugh at that…
"Sir, he's coming up in the elevator now."
"Me too, I didn't mean to insult you." Okay. But back to topic, damn I really need a haircut, usually Tony would come cause he knows the best places but he's working on a kind of high tech, expensive.....something. He's working on something. So, I guess at this point I'll have to go myself, not that I'm mad but I have no idea where to go. You know what, I'm desperate and need this haircut. Plus, what could go wrong.
We reached the enormous front gates and all three of us just stood there gaping, I could have legit burst. We stepped in and were almost instantly overcome by the colour and fun. We didn't know where to start mostly cause i wanted to try everything at least twice, but of course, Tony being rich af hired someone to take them everywhere. We hit ride after ride after ride but then I went to get some food and Tony took Peter to get a toy.
"What time is it?" I see Nat and wonder if she ever actually sleeps. I've never seen her sleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
Now I'm the kind of person who can't sleep after I've woken up so I decide to try to watch TV hoping that would make me tired. So I went into the living room only to the find the couch occupied by a semi naked Clint and Pietro wearing nothing but boxers and sleeping on each other. I just decide to start my day at 3am...*eye roll*
"Hey Bruce, I'm doing fine." And I quickly go hug Tony. I thought you couldn't work when there was no power which brings me to, "how is there no power in the Tower, I thought you were always bragging about how expensive this system is." He was not pleased.
"Come on we'll come back some other time."
Meanwhile with all the commotion, the entire gang ended up at the doorway and were simply watching and cheering but soon went back to what they were doing except Clint and Pietro who made their to the bedroom... (Bow Chicka Bow-Wow) Tony went back to business and Steve, well Steve was on the bed embracing Peter tightly and just happy that his son lived to see another day...
"Yeah, just too startled to react so my brain didn't work and I forgot J. A. R. V. I. S. existed." Didn't think that could be true.
"You wanna try the thing I was talking about now, don't you?" Wow, he's good. Well technically, he is an assassin so expected.
"J. A. R. V. I. S. turn on the sprinklers!!" And instantaneously, water poured from the ceiling and the dowsed the kitchen. See what I meant about Tony needing to stick to his areas of expertise. This is what I was worried would happen and it did.
"J, where's Steve?" Where could he possibly be.
We couldn't go on to the next street after that, Peter was probably going to get hypothermia if we did. So we headed back home. We got Peter changed while Bruce and Clint explained what happened to the rest of the team while Natasha said she was going to find Thor and disappeared to God knows where. We hadn't thought to bring spare clothes for Peter which seems really stupid in hindsight but he wasn't planning on going out anyway so. Me, Tony and Peter spent the rest of the night in the attic looking out of the window and watching the holiday go by. Until...
"We've worked out a negotiation." Oh dear God, what is it. Tony is smirking his ass off.
"PAPA!" Of course.
"Have y- you se- seen yours- self?" He was full on laughing now.
"Is that what rich people do when they're bored?"
"Hi." At least it wasn't raspy this time. Improvement! Somehow a conversation about Pepper strikes up? I have no idea how. I mention our situation and he gets all weird like he's embarrassed or something. No its not that, its like he's flustered or......nervous.
"Pete!" He ran toward my feet and I picked him up and sat down next to Loki. It was a really big couch, so I put my legs up too. Unlike the rest of the group, I had faith in Loki and Thor that he was good and I believed them. It was the right to do. I mean what would the world be if we didn't have faith. And besides, after talking to him, I realized he wasn't a bad guy, in fact very interesting. Actually he and Tony both have a bit in common. They both like flying, fighting, sleeping and they both had bad dads, though Loki's sounded downright terrible.
"I didn't there could be a power cut in a place owned by Stark." That was actual surprise.
So anyway the trip went pretty well in the end.
"Hey honey!" Tony calls out but his back is still facing me. Opportunity. I run up and hug him from behind really tight.
Ayyyy!!!! Two in a weekend?!? I am on fire. Anyway, comment and tell me what you think and I'll reply. Share your thoughts.
It may not be that great but I'm actually really proud of this one anyway if you have any ideas hit me in the comment section, Peace out.
I let out a grunt. I mean hungry that's no reason to cry especially at like 2am. I really need to talk to Peter, then I take Peter into his arms and carry him to the kitchen while Tony follows who is still clutching his head in pain. Still kinda funny.
"Hey guys." After a lot of 'hi's, I sit down next to Clint. Steve is wearing a blue tee this time and it feels or rather looks tighter than the last one. Not complaining though. But one thing I can't get my hand around is why Clint would put that on his shirts. Which is why I sat near him.
"What is wrong with you!?" I am pissed, Clint is smug af.
"Someone pinch me!!"
"I like 'em. Well, I've got to find a new CEO so I'll see you later." I don't want to leave!? I wanna stay here and lose myself in his eyes and then have him slam me against the count- wait what!? Uhhh, shut up mind! I'm straight and I love Steve as a friend....with benefits and someday have him fall in love with me and we get married under the suns- I need to desperately rethink my sexuality damn it. I've got to get out of here before I jump on him.
"Can I get four beers please and put it under Steve, please." Why is he always so polite damn it.
"Apparently."
Steeb simply nodded very innocently and Daddy raised an eyebrow which he seemed to understand.
Summary:- Steve of course loved drawing, it's how he spends most of his time with Tony in the lab. But what happens when there's a power cut so big, even the great Tony Stark can't control it.
"Scan Complete. But it must be faulty I'll rerun the scan." Woah, this must be bad, the roof is never wrong.
"Nothing, on the contrary I wanted to give you this", I held up an album which I made of all of us. He didn't seem too excited but my plan has barely started. He handed it to Peter or rather shoved and rode away before I could mutter another word.
"This asshole is!!" Steve wasn't having it but of course he is way too polite to say anything.
"Sorry?" It was genuine, actually and I really hope he accepts it. Thankfully his anger died down but I could tell he wasn't done with me...and not in a good way. He doesn't even reply but the rest of the day goes great. Clint and Pietro came back soon enough with obviously leaves and twigs and all kind of natural crap in their hair. Of course it didn't last because as soon as Pete was in bed in New York is when my slow death began...
The next morning, we woke up at 7 and started on our trip. Before leaving, Tony handed me a credit card that said 'Platinum', I had no idea what it was. I mean credit card, fine but Platinum credit card, what? Is it like made of platinum cause that's actually highly expected at this point.
"What." He replied with a 'what'? Oh hell no. Just because he's rich, doesn't mean he can do anything he wants.
"What's wrong with you?!' I yelled at her. I mean wouldn't you if she crushed a glass in her hand and beer fell all over your new Armani?!!
"Here you go." He walks in front and hands me hair, is it like a wig. No it isn't.
"No Pete, don't worry I'm not replacing you."
F*¢* Pepper! I am so mad, I can't believe she cheated on me!! I swear I might kill the first person I see!
"On the contrary, don't you think it's a little flashy?" He gave me one of his 'are you kidding me right now, you're literally the only one that thinks that and deep down you know I'm right' looks. Yeah, I didn't know a look could say so much either, but it can apparently.
You know what, I need a drink.
"I got a haircut!" I was excited.
So I head down to his lab where he is pretty much 24/7 until I drag him up.
"Language." Steve smiled before casually walking away.
"I realized Clint!" Okay that was really loud. But I'm mad. But that's no excuse to act this way.
Okay cool, that's out of the way.
PS. Thanks so much to all you readers, because I have officially reached 500 readers!!! I always though 100 was a max but now this!? Thanks so much you guys!!
"I'm bored so I guess, sure let's go." He's halfway through the doorway when I stop him.
"Did you take Peter out of the tub?" Tony hoped this was the case but seeing as to the fact there was no child anywhere around him didn't calm his nerves.
"No." It was plain and clear. I wanted to know what made him laugh so much.
Anyway, he was wearing a peculiar T-shirt. It was a while before I could get my eyes of his bicep long enough to read it but it was still weird, it read 'SINGLE AND READY TO GET NERVOUS AROUND ANYONE I FIND ATTRACTIVE' in pink with a black background. I would bet good money on the fact that this was Natasha's doing.
"Yeah." Finally, I sounded human! Now that my voice was back to normal, I finally got a chance to look at Steve. Ahh Steve, sexy, sexy Steve. Wait, no shut up, you're straight! Right? Eh.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you."
Okay, I'm gonna do it. I found this cute little place only like ten minutes from the tower and the people seemed really nice. And the place was cool, everyone was wearing very colorful clothes like bright jewelry and even the place itself was popping. My name was called so sat in the chair which weirdly enough had like no mirrors next to it. Maybe they don't believe in mirrors? Is that a thing? Anyway, let's get to it.
"Also I'm hungry so I'm gonna get something to eat." He kisses my cheek and walks out. I love Steve. Don't worry he knows. Oh damn it, I'm out of canvas. Shit what do I do now. Well, I could go to the store. No who am I kidding, I'm too lazy for that. Maybe I should send someone? Yeah right, like they'll go. If Steve were here, he'd have gone. Damn it. Ooh, I have an idea.
"Of course I do but-" I'm not saying he shouldn't be mad, no he has every right to but 'Love conquers all evils' right? I think.
"What's that?" Peter asked when his mother seat on the bed, the boy leaned on his mother to see the picture in his mother's hand; Steve smiled a little and adjusts himself until he was leaning on the headboard with Peter sitting in his lap.
To You, Seventy Years Later – The Valentine Addition: https://archiveofourown.org/works/29373717
Johann's forces didn't last two hours against the burly warriors wearing body armor and animal pelts, and their swords were no match for the heavy weapons the invaders swung with their terrifying strength. In less than a day, the Hydra Kingdom had fallen to its knees before the Viking, and now gathered in the throne room and fearing for their lives, the royal family and countless other royal servants along with what was left of their royal guard, awaited the final judgment by the hands of their conquerors, as much as it gave Steven a twisted pleasure that Hydra kingdom was brought to its knees, he knows that he nor his son or any of his friends are going to survive, it doesn't matter that Steven was one of the Vikings a decade ago, he will either be considered a traitor or a prize, and Steven doesn't really care because he knows that he will be either raped or killed by the end of the night, the only thing that Steven cares about is his son, and how to save him at all causes.
"As much as I would love running away from here, I am actually waiting for Officer Natalia Rushman to take my statement." Tony said looking around for the redheaded female, which made Mr. Rogers wince a little.
"Rumors has it that they are looking for the notes." Fury said as he gave Peggy a pointed look which made the woman scowl at that and looked at the notes once again, grumbling to herself about this and that until she returned her gaze to the Alpha who was standing in front of her.
"So you wanted me to kneel, huh?" The Omega asked with a bored voice, his sharp smile turned into a scowl as he walked toward Stane, smirking when he saw the man's eyes widen when Tony didn't follow his command. "Bet you didn't expect that, did you? But guess what, bitch? You can't control me anymore, you know why? Because I'm made of iron, I don't bend to your will or any other Alpha for that matter, I am Iron Man!" Tony's words were followed by a hard kick to Stane's nuts, making the man let out a choked sound of pain as he fell down to the floor, this time, the two Alphas by his side let go of him with a snort, watching as the man clutched himself as he let out pained huffs of breath. "A nice change of scenery, huh?" The Omega snorted and turned around, flipping Stane the bird as he did, walking to Steve whose jaw fell a little, though the grin on the man's face was wide as he gazed at Tony with pride, making the Omega try and stop himself from puffing his chest…
“How can I help you, Mr. Stark?” Mrs. Rogers asked after she put the teacup in front of him, and the flash of pain took a grip of Tony for a second, he hating how the two of them went from the first name phase back to the Mr. and Mrs. Kind of phase, he missed the time when Sarah Rogers will care for him like one of her own, but he will never regret dating her son and getting to know Peter, even when it hurt to be at the end of the cold shoulder from a woman he admired.
"Why… why are you doing this?" Steve choked out, flinching when Bucky shoved his face into Steve's neck, causing Steve's heart to skip several beats, as fear took hold of him. Bucky only let out a hum, nuzzling Steve's neck and shoulder scenting him and ignoring Steve's protests as he tried to wiggle out of the Alpha's tight hold.
They lay on the sofa in silence, save for the sound of them trying to catch their breath. Steve wanted to broach the subject, of why Tony still refused to mark him even after two years of marriage, but Steve decided to do it another time, he didn't want to ruin the good time he was having with Tony because he couldn't wait.
"Where is Margaret?" Steven asked, his question followed by a confused noise from the healer, which made Steven frown but give the Beta a raised eyebrow. "Margaret, a female Beta that I'm sure would have screamed the foolish king's ear off, even if she doesn't understand what he says?" Steven stated, which made realization paint the Beta's face as he let out a huff of laughter.
"Where is he?" Betty asked as her eyes fell on him, nearly pushing herself inside the house, looking around the place probably hoping that she was going to see Harley around. Tony only took a deep breath trying to calm down before he closed the door, following Betty who went to the living room, saying hello to both Steve and Peter while still looking around.
"I know Anna, but…" Steve saw Tony glancing at him before he leaned to whisper in the Beta's ear, which made the woman's eyes widen and for her jaw to drop, it took a few minutes before the woman shook herself out of her shock and when she did, she hit Tony's head with the board in her hand which made the Alpha squeak in pain and rushed away from the Beta's rang last she hit him once more.
"Well, it's a little hard to calm down…" Tony mumbled before leaning on Steve, furrowing his brows in deep thoughts. "Say, do you want a boy or a girl?" Tony asked suddenly, causing Steve to blink in surprise and turn his eyes to Tony who had a mischievous look on his face. "Don't you think we are already outnumbered with two adventurous boys? What about a girl to help balance things down?" Tony wiggled his eyebrows causing Steve to snort and let out a chuckle, leaning to kiss Tony's cheek before pulling back.
Anton's breath hitched as he was suddenly thrust back years upon years in the past, back when everything was simple and the only thing Anton had to do was make his father proud and take over his job of being the blacksmith of their village. Back when Anton had to do nothing but fix and repair and fantasy about the Omega who promised him marriage upon returning home.
"Mama! Papa promised that I will train with you today!" Peter squealed happily as he ran toward the Omega hugging his legs tightly which made a gentle smile taking over Tony's face as he kneeled down and held the baby, giving a happy sigh at the content scent he picked up, pride filling his chest until it felt like it was about to burst open when his baby spoke with a perfect pronunciation like was an adult, Tony thinks that he needed to thank his mother, after all, the woman took it on herself to teach Peter whatever his babe had in mind.
It was a week later since Steven woke up from his coma, a week and Tony walked into his room in Shield HQ followed by Peggy who was making a strange sound that was coming from her throat, it was like animal growls, it made Steven equal worried and fascinated, especially when Tony was pouting and his face was red from embarrassment or was it shame? Today Steven was with Bruce and Natasha, and where Natasha is, Clint follows, his counterpart was on a mission clearly not comfortable in being in the same room with Steven, the four of them were talking about something, Clint wanted to know if he had children or something like that.
but now everyone was staring at him like he had lost his mind, or like he was speaking alien, and that caused him to grimace and stab his food with his fork a few times, taking in the sinister pleasure at the few flinches he got from everyone sitting around the dinner table, the only one who doesn't seem to care about the scene in front of them was Pete, who was telling Goose about him beating Captain America yesterday in basketball, a sport both Steve and Tony start playing a few months back, which ended being a family thing that everyone was welcomed to, even Goose, who always ended up eating the ball.
"Don't move." The engineer gritted out when he had taken all of Steve, dragged his fingernails down Steve's chest. It made Steve hiss in pain but he held still. A few moments later Tony carefully lifted off his hips off Steve's cock and slid down again. He repeated it a few times before saying. "Now…" The word leaving his lips in breathless plea; Steve did as he was told and started a steady rhythm, watching Tony's face for any possible discomfort until the Omega tangled a hand in his hair and drew him roughly up for a quick kiss. "Fuck me already!" They kissed deeply, exploring the other's mouth while their body moved together. Pleasure pooled in their groins.
"A den deprived bear…" Anton confirmed, his free hand going to the reins as he tried to calm his horse, fearing that he would be bucked off if the horse continued to act this scared. Anton words gained many gasps and murmurs, the shock taking over everyone at the realization of who was the foe they were facing; this had never happened before, never happened and everyone accepted that it never will, especially when this neck of the woods doesn't have any family of bears in it since the start of their village, and even if it did, all bears should be asleep now that winter was approaching. Everyone wondered what they are to do, should they leave the bear alone and retreat? Or should they attack? So far the bear kept watching them without making a move.
"Shut it off!" Zemo shrieked out as half of his face and the front of his body was burnt, it was a few minutes later that the scientists did what he ordered them, and that was after the man passed out from the pain and shock, when the bearer was down the Avengers reacted fast and quick as they attacked everyone, not even turning to Tony when the man, powered his repulsors and flow away, everyone knew he was going to Steve's house, and everyone hoped that he will arrive quick…
It made Tony appreciate his friends more than ever; he knew he wouldn't have done it without them. A year passed with him being sober, it ends with him volunteering at the Omegas' clinic, hoping to help as many people as he can, just like his friends and other people helped him.
"Ah, the mouthy one, she is sleeping outside the room, poor girl, screamed until her voice was gone." Braes shook his head in amusement as he stood up, taking the cup from Steven and giving him a soft smile. "I will give you a few minutes to freshen up before calling the girl, then I will bring you some broth to eat." The Beta then left, causing Steven to sigh tiredly and turn to his baby, who seemed to have fallen asleep on his shoulder.
Opening the mansion's doors, Tony gets ready to shout at Steve to show his face. What greeted him when he opened the door though, caused his mouth to click shut and gaze at the ceiling with a shock that seemed to refuse to leave. There hanging from the ceiling upside down was Clint; Clint who was bandaged like he was a mummy, he was squirming and his muffled shout was heard all around the place, the rest of the Avengers were trying to reach him using whatever they can get their hands on.
"Do you want to talk about it?" Tony asked only to get a headshake and Steve burying his face deeper in Tony's thighs; Steve doesn't want to remember, he doesn't want to remember the cruel vision he had to see, he doesn't want that crazy nightmare to become real. It was only a few minutes later that the towers' alarms started shrieking causing both Steve and Tony to jump from the bed, Steve could only watch in fear as his mind remember the scary vision that he saw, as for Tony, it was only a few second later before he was fully clad in his armor. "Steve! Go and find Peter, Jarvis would lead you to a panic room, go now!" Tony's command broke Steve from his panic, causing him to gulp and jump off the bed running straight to Peter's room, being thankful that Tony and he wore pajamas to bed.
"Wait! So you are saying to me that people eat stars' hearts to become immortal, is that what you did?" Mr. Barton
"Say, my queen, do you know of a place called Asgard?" The Alpha asked, waiting for what the Omega was going to say, his heart pounding in his chest at the answer he will receive, most people who will hear him, they will think that he was talking about the realm of Gods, but only those who were truly his people will know what he was talking about, especially the slight different pronunciation.
Steve heard enough so he thrust the door open, startling both Howard and Peggy. "I'm sorry for interrupting but the mission is done…" Steve said trying not to look at Howard's broken eyes as the older man tried to get hold of himself…
"OK… you didn't tell her that you are taking me on a date, right?" Tony asked, fearing that his life was cut short fifty years early; if Pepper knew… Steve shook his head a no, which made Tony give a sigh of relief. OK, good, he can live a few more months without being targeted by Pepper's high heels. "OK, good, let's go." Tony sighed tiredly, preparing himself for the most terrifying night of his life, the insane grin that took over Steve's face, confirmed Tony's thoughts…
He wanted to make a good impression, probably because then maybe Tony's brother will like him, after all, getting the cold shoulder from Tony's family always hurt, even when the Omega tried to act like he didn't care about how his husband's family treating him like trash, so that day instead of getting to work on his art, Steve started tidying up the house wanting it to be spotless when James arrived.
It started harmlessly enough; that was until Pepper sprained her ankle falling downstairs after they rushed her toward the hospital, Tony finally could breathe when Bruce told him that Pepper's ankle wasn't a serious injury and that it should be healed from one to three weeks if Pepper didn't strain herself with work. The car ride was so silent that Tony felt like suffocating, especially when Pepper pointed out that she felt someone pushing her down.
Moving his left leg around, Tony discovered that there was no pain there anymore, no hurt, and no dislocated bones grinding and hurting Tony. That did nothing but pull a soft smile from Tony as he started walking toward the front door, already planning something crazy in his mind. Reaching the outside, Tony's breath left him as he found Rogers in the lake, his head peaking around the surface as his gaze was taking the house in… taking Tony in.
Steve's eyes widen as they took in the room, his mouth opened a little, and an 'Oh' sound escaped him as he took the room in, taking in the few ripped stuffed toys, the fallen crib, the dirty smudges on the floor, and Steve could see that Tony was breaking, especially when his eyes fell on the three children that were holding into the excited and dirty puppy that was parking happily as he was chowing on a blue blanky.
It took time, but in the end, Steve was left a relaxing purring mess in the water, taking in the soothing smell as he leaned back, resting his head, on the bathtub headrest behind him. Steve hummed to himself as he closed his eyes, his right hand trailed down until it rested on his stomach.
To say the truth the chapter was not to my satisfaction, I wrote and rewrote the chapter, only getting this far before saying enough… sigh…
"How did you know?" Tony hissed as he looked at Steven who was looking at his nails with amused look hidden deep in his eyes, no one, practically no one knew about this dark secret other than Dummy, and he made that AI mute just so his secrets will be saved! But this 'Steve' comes to expose him in five seconds flat! How did he know?
"Not unconsciously no." Loki said as he looked at Steven with an amused look, he already can feel everyone's eyes on him, especially his mother and Odin, Thor was looking at Steven with a confused look, and the rest of the Avengers didn't take their eyes off of Loki. "Do you remember this day?" Loki said as he wove his hand and a mist formed to show Thanos and Steven fight, in the fight Steven was able to grape the gauntlet with both of his hands and everyone can see the shocked look on Thanos's face, and it was mirrored by Odin and Frigga as they looked at the scene. "The stones are sentient beings, only those of powerful will can control them… you can say that your will was the strongest, stronger than even Thanos." Loki waved his hand once more and the scene changed, showing Thanos standing on the ground of his plant, the Avengers looked with wide eyes as they saw Thanos raise the gauntlet to snap his fingers, but the stones lashed at him and burned his arm, it took a while for the titan to regain control and when he snapped his fingers, everyone pale as they saw those who fought Thanos turn to dust. "Your will was stronger than Thanos himself, that's why when the titan wanted to use the gauntlet to erase half of the universe, the stones lashed at him, they were still 'working' under your will, and you only wanted to protect everyone from Thanos, protect the universe from him… and Thanos knew that, so to make your will waver, he killed the closest person to you first, so that he can use the stone." The scene change showing a Steven looking at his fallen comrades, but the whisper of his name made him turn to the person who called him, everyone can hear Steve's choked whisper of Bucky's name, and Peggy saw the horror on Steve's face as Bucky looked at Steven with confused as he outstretched his hand for him, just as Bucky took a step toward Steven, he tripped and hit the ground turning into dust.
it was usually followed by an uncomfortable silence as whoever caught sight of him tried to run away from here, either run to the town or run away from the town.
After him presenting as an Omega, a lot of things changed, his parents were the one who changed the most… his mother start paying him attention, as much as she can when she wasn't busy with her higher class friends, she started taking him out to shopping trips (Yuck!) she also start teaching him how a proper Omega should act (Yeah, right, like he will do that) and the most disgusting thing, she started pushing him 'gently' to choose a Good-Rich-Powerful Alpha… he storms out most of the time after that… his father, on the other hand, changed too, Tony didn't know what to do with the truth he learned after the heart to heart with his father… but Tony thinks the two of them may stand on common ground in the end. Apparently, his father's disdain of him was all an act! The story goes like this, he was young, he got kidnapped, and they found him after a month nearly kissing death's feet, his father starts acting coldly toward him in hope of protecting him by showing other people that he doesn't care about his son, and he succeeded, that lead to a huge shouting match between them… well, more of Tony screaming and shouting and maybe throw something or two at his father and his father taking everything with guilt in his eyes. After Aunt Peggy confirmed what his father said, and to his shock, she was the one who helped him with that idiotic plan… Tony didn't know what to do, so he locks himself in his lab for three days… in the end, after lots and lots of pleas and promises from his family, he decided to give them another chance… and he was thankful he did that, even though he will never tell any soul about that to his dying day. Aunt Peggy took it on herself to teach him advance self-defense, the defense that only spies know about, it was awesome! Jarvis starts teaching him how to cook and take care of the house… which was not awesome, but he loves Jarvis too much to say anything.
18-Hvað veistu um rauða höfuðkúpuna? -What do you know about the Red Skull?
"But Nat, I'm pregnant not an invalid person!" Tony whined, complaining about how everyone in the town practically babysat him and doesn't allow him to do anything just because he was pregnant, which made the woman growl at him, making the teen pout, even more, when Clint snorted and drank his coffee.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I will try and talk with Tony… I won't promise you that he will not go and sneak out with Rogers in the middle of the night like his threat implied, but I will try to talk with him, and advise him to slow their courting until we find Bucky, which may as well be the end of their relationship." Steven said which made Peggy take a shuddered breath at that.
"I… do not want any dowry! I already arranged everything; I found a plot of land to build a house on, and I am going to pay the bride price, and I… I…" Whatever nonsense the man was going to say or try to wave to convince the queen to marry him, Anton didn't stay to hear; as fast as he can Anton turned away, his hands were clenched into tight fists and he gritted his teeth, anger coursing through him at what he witnessed.
It broke Sam a little that he wasn't able to help the Omega, other than giving him that heart retching news, he had checked and double-checked his information for a hundred times, fearing that he missed something, that maybe, just maybe there was something amiss, but every time he tried to find another lead, it all ends in the same way, with a dead end.
"Good morning to you, Tony, also you are late." Pepper said as she raised her head from the papers so she did frown when she saw the man look at her with a tired and pale face. "Tony, what happened?" Pepper asked tensing a little in worry, wondering what the man threw himself into this time.
"Howard," Steve called out making the Alpha look up from his phone fast, the hope shining in his eyes. "He wants to see you…" Steve said making everyone stand up fast, Maria was the first to enter the room as she pushed Steve and run toward her son.
"Is that all?" Thanos asked, and Nebula tried desperately to think of a way that will save her; because now the smile on her father's face informed her that Thanos knew all of this from the start and that her information was useless to him. If she didn't act fast and tell him any good information, it will mean her death.
"No, Ma'am the universe I am from doesn't have an A/B/O dynamic, so technically I am not a Beta, just a normal human." Steven answered the woman's question, which made everyone's eyes widen at that, and a thousand more question was asked. Now if Steven was any lesser man, he would have whimpered in fear and run away like his life depended on it, which it does at this point, but Steven just smiled and waved… well, more like grimaced and waved Peggy's concerns as she looked at him then returned her gaze to the crowd, hoping to spot any suspicious person that could have been one of Hydra, Natasha and Clint not far behind, disguising as reporters and sitting with the rest asking questions with the others.
"… Who are you?" Peggy asked, unsure of the answer, it shocked her greatly how this man talked with her with such familiarity, no one joked with her like this, even Steve always act professionally with her these days.
"First of all language!" Snapped Steve making Natasha glare at him. "Second of all, what the fuck did you think, breaking people's phones like this?" That made Natasha look at him with an open mouth then she closes it and looks at her hand and wince.
When the suit was in its place Tony turned to look at Pepper with a dark look on his face, it made everyone take a step back at the rage and hate in the Alpha's eyes, this was the first time anyone saw Tony act like this. "The bastard who destroyed my life…" Tony hissed and the mask was snapped in its place, then Tony flow out of the room, making Pepper squeak as rocks start falling.
"Mama!" The small boy gasps happily and run to his mother who opened the door to his room, it has been a week since he saw his mother, long and boring seven days, he was stuck in his room today, his mentors left him books and ordered him to read and try to understand as much as he can from it, which he thought was stupid, and often than not he will ignore them and wait for his dam, who then will help and teach him important stuff, like using a sword or how to make winning strategies, or how to help the people who will be under his rule one day, not stupid history that only praise the king and the royal family, two-hundred pages, of how king Johann made his kingdom by killing the old king, then another five-hundred page, praising his cruelty as he killed people and conquer other countries, and turned people from the lower class into slaves, and them another three-hundred pages about Hydra's kingdom customs. James hated his father's kind of teaching because it only taught him how to be cruel, and how cruel and monstrous his father was, how he gained the name Red Skull, a name that will be his in the end, it was not like his mother who will teach him important things that James liked to know about.
She wipes her brow and sits beside him, sipping her own drink. "You still went easy on me." She leaned back on her hand, after saying those words, a chiding frown on her face. "What happened… for you to hate… Pepper?" Peggy finally asked after regaining her breath, her words made Steve frown and gaze at the bottle in his hand tiredly.
Tony made sure to back away without someone noticing; suddenly feeling a little claustrophobic, who in their right mind will come to talk to him, least made their kids take a picture with him? Wasn't it a year ago these people called him the Merchant of Death? Now he was their hero, Tony shook his head and turn around, feeling something slammed into him when he looked down he winces as he saw a small child with the Iron Man replica helmet and glove on. "Hey, kid, are you OK?" He asked the child and offered him his hand when the sat up.
That's how Tony spent the next hour or so, sitting under his desk as he explained to Rhodey what happened from when Rogers came living in his mansion until yesterday when he was informed by Serpentine that he was to wed her 'Baby boy' on a full moon on else…
The battering on the door made Tony tense for a few minutes, speculating who was knocking at his door at such an hour; shaking his head Tony stood up and reached for his bathrobe, heading to the door thinking that it was either Natasha or Clint, maybe even Peggy. “Who is it?” Tony called out when he arrived at the door, not picking up a response at first, which made Tony tense, reflecting about last night events he backed away from the door, before the sound of the police chief met him, causing Tony to furrow his eyebrows, wondering why police chief Fury is visiting him, but he opened the door.
Rhodey froze in his place his eyes were wide as the song continued. "The hell? What kind of song is this?" Rhodey hissed, holding Tony's hand as he walked him through the aisle, shivering when he saw the Addams family sitting on the right side of the room, wide creepy grins on their faces as they took Tony in; what made Rhodey gulp was not the creepiness he was feeling, but what he was seeing. Ghosts, corpses, zombies, and even voodoo dolls were in the Addams family row (And were those standing hairballs?), making Rhodey wonder if this was such a good idea.
Needless to say, Thanos and his army were destroyed before the rest of the Avengers arrived; leaving Steve and Tony laughing madly as they made the alien scream for mercy as they tortured him publicly before throwing him into their shark tank (Which now housed sixty sharks thanks to Steve's obsession with those creatures) after they left him tied upside down in Peter's web with the venomous spiders (Peter's obsession and friends) On another lighter note, that day…
That was accompanied by the noise of something striking the wall and smashing, which caused everyone to shift uneasily and stares at Peter, who was having a big headphone on his head, singing alone whatever song Tony downloaded on the brand new MP3 player, a recent invention that became famous and famous each day.
After Steven heard Tony's thoughts about himself, he was broken-hearted with how no one realizes how much Tony suffered; it made Steven realize how much of a failure he was dealing with this younger version of his husband, it ended with Steven telling Tony a little about his life with his husband, informing the Omega that nothing was as perfect as is seems but they could only move on, that it doesn't matter if he missed up this time, he still has tomorrow to fix everything.
Both Steve and Anthony were grateful that they had three weeks before the Alpha needed to go because not two days later, Steve's heat arrived, it was the first time for Anthony and Steve to share one, it was too intimate, too private to share a heat with someone other than a mate, but the two of them were going to get married, they were going to run away from this Hell and started their own life together.
"Huh?" Tony could only choke out, his body finally giving up on him and Tony found himself on his back staring at the ceiling in shock, not knowing what to do and how to act… Steve Grant Rogers just kissed him; Steve kissed him… the Winter Soldier kissed him! Tony's face flush, embarrassment taking over him as his lips tingled from the kiss Steve gave not a few minutes ago…
The first one is a horror story with a pregnant Tony and a cabin in the woods elements, "The Lake House" so if you like these types of stories check it out!
Sam pressed his lips tightly, staying silent for a few seconds before clearing his throat. "I was going to visit you in a few days, wanting to invite you for dinner; my husband Riley, chewed me for not bringing him and the kids for your engagement party. It seems that Natasha gave you the green light so Riley is all excited to meet you." Sam gave a small smile; amusement was clear on his face.
The Omega snarled as he stalked toward Tyber, probably with the intent to kill the Beta here and now, and Anton was held between wanting to get rid of Tyber or stop the Omega from causing himself more harm from Tyber's followers. "Did you forget about me already? Or is it just the people you break your oath to?" The queen hissed letting out a dangerous growl causing Tyber to take a step back. "You swore on king Odin and Queen Frigga that you will save my child if I gave you all the information about the Hydra king; you swore and you broke your oath!" It was when the queen bounced on Tyber that Anton and Jamti reacted by pulling him back. "They found you a day and a half journey without a child you oath-breaker! You swore on your life you will take him to Brookland! You gave yourself that scare on your face as a show of trust and truth!" The Queen screamed, trying to pull himself away from Jamti and Anton.
Steve closed his phone and stood up; he stretches his body, hearing the cracked coming from his back making him wince. He looked around the room until his breath hitches as he saw a Beta heading toward them. Steve power-walked toward the doctor which gain Howard's attention, the older Alpha gasped at that and stood up from his chair, waking up Maria and Angie in return. "How are they?" Steve breathed out when he stood in front of the doctor; the doctor looked at Steve and squeaked, he then calmed down as he saw Maria and Howard run toward them, Peggy and Angie not that far behind. "Well?" Steve snapped he knows he shouldn't have done that, but he was too worried to care about manners right now.
"The same could be said about you, for not once did you offer to give your name away as a show of friendship." The king stated which gained him a twitch of lips from Steven. "It is Anton." The king offered, which made Steven's heart give a painful pang at the familiar name; hearing this name made a pain like a hot knife pierce his heart, and Steven had to bit his lips hard as to not let a gasp out.
"Well, you see, because of you, that old bitch reported me to Barnes and Carter, and guess what? It seemed that you are their favorite out of everyone, which was strange considering they don't take a liking to anyone… anyone but the supposed monster living in this lake… do you know what they did?" Ty leaned to whisper in Tony's ear, making him choke and shake his head, hoping against hope that Clint or hell Fury was coming this way, but Tony could only give a pained cry when he was pushed down to the ground, and he sobbed as he tried to curl around himself and protect his belly from the man who was standing over him. "Do you know what they did? They kicked me out of the town and took everything! Like they have any right to do as they like! So what if I harass whores like you and drink all day long? It's not like your life matter or anything not after you whored yourself to the monster and carried its child." Tony sobbed as he tried to crawl away, letting out a shriek, when the taller man drops on him, taking hold of his hands in one arm while pointing the knife at Tony's belly.
Holding his breath, Tony bite his bottom lip to stop the smile that was going to take over his face and gazed at Steve whose eyes fluttered opened as he gazed around the room in a daze until his eyes settled on Tony and a huge smile taking over Steve's face. "This is the first time I have slept through the night…" Steve whispered inching closer to Tony, causing his breath to hitch. "You look more beautiful in the morning, do you know that?" Steve murmured, his lips leaving a butterfly trail of kisses, causing Tony's breath to hitch.
Morgan on the other hand start whining and moving around with no care for her wellbeing, trying to make Tony let go of her, which made Tony bite a curse and hold tightly to his baby, being mindful not to hurt his baby, or rumble her clothes last she got cold. The hair on the back of Tony's neck stood on its ends when suddenly, Tony starts hearing splashes of water behind him, causing Tony's breath to still in his chest.
21-Mjög vel. -Very well.
When ten minutes pass and Morgan refused to calm down, Tony let out a tired grunting as he looked around the room, pouncing Morgan in his arms as he tried to think of something to calm his baby down before Tony lose it and start crying too. After a few minutes of thinking Tony smiled as an idea come to him, of course, how didn't he think of this, Anna used to do the same when Tony become fussy and refused to sleep. "J.A.R.V.I.S., lights on 30%, and play 'Can't help falling in love," Tony ordered gently shushing his baby as he starts humming gently, waiting for the song to start before he started dancing slowly with Morgan in his arms.
Happy New Year!
"I gather that you will end up dead, either way, it's only fair that I tell you the reason why I hate you before you do that." Howard stated as he stood up from the chair, there was a cotton swap in his hand that Steve wondered from where he got it; he was afraid of the answer though. "I really hate you, I hate that you refused to take the money, I hate that you were true to your words when billions of people are nothing but lying actors, but what I hate the most was how you turned my son into a useless sniffling mess without you." Howard stated as he raised Steve's right sleeve and finding the spot he wanted and swap it with the cotton that was drenched in alcohol. "Knowing my son, in the poor state he is in right now, he will not only fail to take care of my grandson, but he will cause him to end up dead too, and if that happens, my son will follow the both of you. And maybe that's another reason why I hate you; my son became nothing but a fool in love who lost his vision of the future the second you are down, but I guess that's what real
"I have no one, only my caretaker, but I am already a grown-up, 2500 years old, give or take a few decades." Steven said with pride shining in his voice which made the metal female hum at that and eye him up and down, well, to be fair the creature's head didn't move, but Steven can already feel its eyes on him.
