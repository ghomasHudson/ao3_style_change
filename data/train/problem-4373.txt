When Anna was finished, they gave a little bow at the applause and ducked down off the stage. They looked pleased but embarrassed by the attention, their red hair swinging down to cover their thin, fine-boned face.
He put his hands into his pockets again. Walked with his shoulders set a little lower.
“Tell you?”
“Was it OK?” he asked.
“He was just starting to figure himself out when we were at school, senior year,” Charlie said. “He was confused a lot of the time so he used to talk to me and our friends about it sometimes. And then he figured it out and things got better in some ways and worse in others, honestly, because other people can be dicks.”
reruns. Cas smiled, and threw them in the basket - and as he did so, his phone dropped out of his other hand and clattered to the floor. He looked embarrassed; before he could stoop down to pick it up, Dean found himself bending down on one knee and scooping it off the floor, straightening and offering it to Cas carefully. He felt like a knight retrieving a maiden’s fallen kerchief.
Mariport was a small city, so most places besides the outskirts were within easy walking distance. This early, the mist was still enjoying a lazy morning in the empty streets, and Castiel breathed in the fresh air as he walked towards his childhood home. He crossed a bridge over a turquoise canal – it had only been a few days since he’d walked through the city, and he realised that he’d missed it. The buildings he passed were tall, some of them daubed with murals or decorated with pastel mosaics. He crossed a courtyard littered with fallen pink and white petals from the magnolia tree at the centre, and headed down a cobbled alley.
Maybe he did got it, Castiel thought.
His conversation with that damned Angel from the Underlight was playing round and round in his head, too. The good parts, and also the part where the Angel had insisted that it would have been right to take the attacker to an Angel base. That was just wrong. Whoever the Angel was, he was
“What?”
He thought he could manage it.
“Not if we just figure out a way to contain it,” Dean said, doing a box motion with his hands. Castiel mimicked him.
“Oh, really?” Cas’ eyes were bright. “What do you like to read?”
“Please, we already know each other. You can just call me Lisa.”
“Right…”
“Cas,” Dean says again, and gives another squeeze, and then lets go. “Your grace is
“Then what –” Castiel broke off. He heard Dean’s voice in his mind, warning him.
When they broke apart, it was without bashfulness. No more shyness on Dean’s face. What they wanted, what they both wanted, was too clear for embarrassment.
“You’re a good kid.”
“I mean, if you sing anything like I’ve always heard you sing for my whole life, then, yeah,” Sam said, and Dean made a half-hearted attempt to laugh.
Each time, the Dean in Castiel's mind looked almost angry as he waited for an answer. Each time, Dean's face softened when Castiel said,
“Sure,” he managed. “Yep. Yep, I can do that. Yeah.”
“I just wanted you to be taken care of,” Gabriel said. “And to have someone to take care of. Something that wasn’t your work to care about. I was worried about something happening, something like – like what happened at Angelus. And when it did, I thought you’d have Sarah, and when you told me she’d broken up with you I kept thinking about it, and now – now I find out that you went through the whole thing pretty much alone.”
Dean’s feet wouldn’t walk him away. Still, he kept thinking he might see Cas again, and that was worth sticking around just another few minutes. He gritted his teeth. Why in the
“So, uh, anyway. I got you the invite for sure, by the way. Christmas. If you’re still in.”
“Okay,” she said, “you win.”
“I have to go,” Cas said.
“Castiel,” said a worried voice. Castiel saw red hair about a foot below his eyeline, and scrubbed a hand over his face and then back through his hair.
“Made of dust,” Claire said. “In the wind.”
He saw something clear on Cas’ face, as though something that had been weighing on him had suddenly been lifted.
“Jody asked me to mention to you that you should be careful where you go and what you do for the next little while. We assumed you’d want your privacy so we’ve been taking steps to protect it. Jody and the team have been really careful with keeping your details quiet, so no one knows your last name or where to find you - and she’s paid off a couple of the more insistent news outlets.”
Lisa was here. Dean’s bride, she was here. It was happening. Here he was, in the moment he’d dreaded for so long.
He walked back into his house, and looked around. The red rug had a new verve to it; the bannister shone in the light through the door. The grandfather clock said,
of the oven, earlier, that had pulled him out of the dark.
Dean swallowed hard. These – these weren’t casual messages, thrown into the conversation. These were – these were – Dean didn’t have the words for it. Were they true? Were they real? Surely not, how could they be?
“Ah… it’s really got to be this song,” Dean said, trying to sound as though he really cared what the execs might think. There was no way he was agreeing to sing a Castiel song, on principle. Jody shrugged.
In his gut, Castiel felt the journey like a weight. He wanted to go back. He wanted to be in his apartment with evening setting in and a scented candle burning, reading up on his latest client’s background or looking up some obscure point of law in one of his books. He wanted to watch Netflix and eat too much pad thai that he’d ordered in. He wanted a bath. He wanted the smell of his place, he wanted blankets on the sofa. He wanted to go out for dinner with his colleagues at Angelus and discuss the latest developments in each of their cases. He wanted to be wearing his suit and tie. He wanted his office. He wanted Bartholomew to give him that single raised eyebrow that meant he was impressed.
“Practising?”
Dean breathed out, and Cas’ stare broke. He blinked, and looked down at the floor. His expression, which had been so certain just a moment before, seemed to sink back into confusion.
“I have no idea. Mom’s talking to the press. She said it’s gonna be rough. Someria isn’t against us, but a lot of people are going to be. But she’s happy, Dean. She’s really happy.”
“Oh, you live near here?”
“And still glad she’s seeing less of you.” Jo passed Castiel, and gave him a small smile. “All okay?”
“No smoke without fire, Angel.” The Hunter shook his head. “Whatever. You got anything on your spooky eyes? Raised heartbeats, or… anything?”
Castiel stared at it for a long, long second, and then met Dean’s eyes.
Dean grabbed for his phone, and pulled up his messenger. He scrambled to find his chat with Charlie.
They began to walk across the carpet, a light breeze buffeting at them playfully – and the group of bachelors seemed to have their mood lifted in front of the cameras, smiling and waving and calling out to the welcome party. Harry Spangler grabbed Dean’s wrist and raised it in the air, which Castiel watched Dean allow for a few moments with tension in his neck before pulling away.
“Right. Right. Obviously.”
Dean swore viciously.
“Absolutely. We should find you some
“The Duchess suggested we could spend a little more time together if we took food and had a picnic,” Dean said, and even Castiel couldn’t read his tone of voice. If he had to guess, Dean was feeling pretty good about the inclusion of food, and pretty bad about everything else that was happening.
“I’m doing better at shaving,” he says. “And I’ve learned not to brush my teeth before drinking orange juice.”
Mary walked forward. She picked up the newspaper on the table, and held it loosely in one hand. She was perfectly steady.
When Hannah stopped the car, Castiel lifted his head off the window and faced forward.
“I’m…” Dean leaned back in his chair. “I’m seven chilis.” He heard Charlie let out a staticky sigh of weariness on the phone. “I mean, come on. Like, being honest, we all know the truth is that it’s pointless.”
“Dean,” Castiel said, “Good morning.” He looked like he was going to say something else, but seemed to change his mind and went to sit over at his usual table with a mug of something that was gently steaming. Dean watched after him. Castiel retrieved a pen from his front pocket, and began to read what looked like an essay with his usual expression of intense concentration.
“Dean!”
“Come with me,” Dean said, looking down at him, using his free hand to guide Castiel’s face up into a kiss. “Mmm – mmm –”
Dean swallowed. He didn’t want to put any of it into words – how much it had really meant to him, what he’d felt growing between him and Castiel back in college. How happy it had made him when he’d thought that Castiel felt the same. And how much it had hurt when Castiel had blown him off for their first date,
said the voice in his head.
And then his stomach went cold.
Dean nodded.
And Dean was about to make a call that would, in essence, be taking a great swinging hammer blow at that fixed and sturdy and familiar thing. He was about to take his relationship with his brother and push it to see if it fell.
“Not exactly,” he said finally, when the refusal to group Castiel and Led Zeppelin in the same genre overrode any other impulse. “It’s more a pop… kinda thing. I’ve just, uh, I’ve been invited to take part.”
Dean pretended to inspect the toothbrush, flicked off a non-existent mote of dust, and then put it back in the bag. Castiel watched him put on the little show, trying not to be charmed, or at the very least trying not to show it.
And below that… soft hair.
When Dean got to class half an hour later, he was five minutes late and his students had already taken their seats. He kept his eyes on the ground as he walked in, only looking up and putting his hands on his hips when he reached front and centre of the room.
“Uh, yeah. Hi,” she said. “I came to talk to you guys.”
“Now, first up,” he heard Jody say from the front, “we have Patience Turner.”
Dean sipped his drink thoughtfully. He was getting to like the minty sweetness.
This year, he was going big. It was a giant tree, and it was going to be resplendent with baubles and tinsel and lights. It was going to be bigger than Anna’s, next door; more sparkling than Charlie’s, along the way; and, without a doubt, it was going to be better in every way possible than the one right opposite, where Castiel lived.
“Alright,” he said, and it came out a little rough around the emotions caught in his throat.
“Nothing,” Castiel said.
“Thanks,” Dean said.
. They kissed in quiet, enjoying each other’s touch, opening up under each other’s hands.
“Rumours?” Dean said, looking unfazed and still mostly focused on the breakfast. Castiel, however, felt that nagging sensation in his mind reach critical levels. There was definitely something, something about last night, something that he really needed to remember had happened –
They got up and left. Dean’s hand tightened on Cas’ shoulder, and Cas said something into his arms.
They’d had a lake in the town where he’d grown up, and he and Sam had spent ages swimming there in the summer, their mom and dad watching from the bank in their broken-down chairs.
He said the words with a little more feeling than Dean had been expecting - and somehow, he knew exactly what Castiel meant.
Castiel was hoping. He wanted to push it away or deny it but it was the truth. He could feel hope burning in him, hope that Dean liked him. Wanted him, in the same way Castiel wanted him. It felt possible. It felt so near that as they walked down the familiar staircases together, Castiel almost reached out and took Dean’s hand.
“F-fuck.” Dean’s breathing was stuttering. “I’m – fuck, Cas, yeah.”
He’d done this before, Dean told himself. Enough times that normally, he didn’t even feel nervous when he got up here anymore, and cast his eyes around the sea of faces. Admittedly, he’d usually had a bit more to drink, by this point, if he was going to sing - but the night had slipped away so quickly. And usually, there wasn’t a guy at the back of the room Dean didn’t want to take his eyes off. He thought he saw Cas smile at him in the darkness, and his heart flipped again. So undeniable, so tangible, so inadvertent and uncontrollable.
“I’m looking forward to seeing it. In Someria we have some reservoirs, but not many natural lakes.”
"I'm just sayin', I don't wanna see your ass back in Central after you got kicked out. There's a plan, remember? I keep the Underlight as clean as I can, you…"
“I’m allergic,” Cas said absent-mindedly, putting them back. “Okay, these are better. Chocolate and more chocolate.” He threw them in the basket, and then headed further down the aisle.
he told the part of his brain that still ran on fantasy novels and not law textbooks.
“About… the cheese?”
“Nah,” he said. “That’s Cas.”
Dean looked at him closely.
“Just you,” Castiel said. “Dean.” He was starting to shiver without a coat on, out in the cold.
Cas nodded, still distant, buried in his own mind.
When he looked up, he saw that Cas was still looking ever so slightly flustered, and it took Dean half a moment to realise why; he couldn’t still be thinking about that joking compliment that Dean had paid him, could he?
“But –”
“It’s a secret,” Dean repeated.
“You will?” he said.
“Please. I need the insulin. I’ll die without it -”
“Angels, too,” Castiel said.
“You - what? You don’t even have my mobile number,” Dean said.
“I mean… if you want to,” Cas said. “We can just go.”
“Gabriel,” he said.
“Not you,” Castiel pointed out.
He breathed in, and breathed out. He searched for that feeling of being at The Refuge. Being secure, being capable. Cas was watching him. Dean was with someone safe. He could do this.
After all, Dean thought, he’d disliked Castiel all this time. If Castiel was offended, it wasn’t as though Dean was losing a friendship that mattered to him. And Castiel could just be aloof and distant with him for a different reason than before. He had nothing much to lose.
“It was real. It was perfect.” And then he tilted his head to one side, and said, “Well. Almost.”
Maybe for Dean, the dislike wasn’t a pretence. Maybe Dean really didn’t like Castiel.
Dean was quiet for a few seconds, and then he said,
obvious reluctance. Dean leaned closer to read it.
“Uh,” said Dean.
The judge explained how the auditions would work, seeming to be talking incredibly slowly; the auditionees would all sing, they’d be judged, the best one would join Castiel to sing in his concert. Dean was half-tempted to skip ahead and find the part where he was onstage, but then a shot of Cas appeared on the screen.
“Save it,” Castiel said shortly. “I’m going to go get breakfast.”
“Ugh. Don’t even tell me what she said.” Parisian sunlight was reflecting off Dean’s sunglasses. It was too hot to wear a jacket, and he felt strangely exposed walking up the avenue with just a t-shirt and jeans on. Beside him, Jo was walking with her eyes on her phone, silently scrolling. Dean waited a few seconds, and then said impatiently,
“You think a lot,” Dean said. “Should I come back in like two hours when you’re done? Or is staring at me a key part of the whole thing?”
He was going to unpack his things. It wasn’t as though there were many of them, so they could easily be packed up again once he’d worked out a way to get out of here that didn’t involve total humiliation. And the revenant wasn’t getting back inside, anyway, with the wards up. And he was going to set up his WiFi router, and he was going to send Gabriel a picture of his unpacked boxes. His new home. Even if it didn’t last until the evening, he was going to have a moment of triumph.
Cas seemed to visibly collect himself, or make an attempt, and only shook his head in response.
“Ahh… uh, well, I think, uh -” Dean considered. Cas had specifically told him to sing the Adele song - and anyway, was he even planning on sticking around long enough to get on the stage? With luck, he’d have Cas’ number and have long since cut and run before backing music became a problem. “Nah, it’s okay. I’ll sing it without the track.”
“I wasn’t freaked out,” Castiel said, trying not to sound too much as though he was enjoying himself. It felt good to hear Dean’s voice down the phone. Dean Winchester, the most handsome guy in Spanish 101, was actually on the end of the phone. They were actually talking. Under circumstances that made no sense, obviously, but still.
Dean had just asked Castiel if he was up for dating.
“You actually live in the forest too? Alone?”
“Chili,” Dean managed. He expected Castiel to look confused, and question what Dean meant – ask him to put his feelings into words that actually made sense, express the overwhelming rush of being touched and feeling attraction in a way that a normal human being would understand. But instead, Castiel offered Dean a very small smile.
“So… it doesn’t change anything?”
“Maybe he’s just shy,” Charlie said.
“I’m Cas,” Castiel said, remembering at the last moment not to give his full name, and Gordon shook his hand firmly.
“Head right on in,” they said. “You want to go through the doors there, and you’ll find Jody, who’ll be taking your music. Then you can go through to makeup…”
They stared at each other over the table.
“Dean, we’re in Texas. If it’s country, I got it.”
"Right. And in the meantime…"
“Castiel. The singer.”
“Should we at least let Jody know where we are?”
“You gotta know your limitations,” Dean said.
“Look, guys, if I remember right,” Dean said, “this was my bachelor party, and the drinks were on me, so if you’ve got any complaints…”
“Soon.”
“Hi, kids!” Charlie said, walking up to them. Today she was at her most official, with a clipboard in her hands and a headset on. “You all look amazing! Okay, let’s see, if we could have you all gathered kind of, yeah, here on the porch and down the steps? For a group picture? Donna and Jody, you in it too, yes? And then maybe we can go round the back, I hear you guys have some fun activities planned that the Prince and the Duchess could join in with! Are you excited?!”
Castiel waited his turn with his heart beginning to thud faster. Mary was poised as always, her eyes sharp. He felt like the nine-year-old boy she’d once caught and told off for lying about where Dean was hiding. That had been only a little secret, a little lie, because Dean had just been hiding in the fifth bedroom behind the wardrobe to avoid eating a salad. Now, there was an entire wedding to conceal.
“I’m not,” he said.
on tumblr. Please go and show love, if you have the time and spoons!!
“I ripped his poster…”
He broke off, even as Dean looked up at him expectantly. What was he supposed to ask? He’d had questions pushing at his mind all day, and now that he had the chance to have them answered, he didn’t know where to start.
“I’m okay,” Dean insisted, though his legs were wobbly under him when he tried to put weight on them, and he was glad of Jody’s wiry strength and Cas’ effortless support. He shuffled himself backwards with very little grace, and then Jody’s hand on his shoulder guided him to put his head ower, between his raised knees.
“But, yeah, the lake here is great,” Charlie said. “I never knew about it until I started working for the royal family.”
Right.
Castiel tried to take this all in.
“I have more tour dates,” Cas acknowledged quietly. “But I can come back to town…”
“This isn’t about anything like that.”
“You should get into the dry,” Castiel said.
Castiel followed the tug on his hand, Dean’s palm warm, his fingers gripping tight. It was happening so headily fast – one moment they’d been in the cathedral with every eye on them, and then quite suddenly they were outside in a small alley to the side of the cathedral where the garbage was apparently put out, big black sacks stacked in green bins. For a second, they paused, and Castiel stared at the garbage, and the dirty alley floor, and at Dean, and he felt a laugh rising. A half-disbelieving laugh with his pulse pounding and his breath a little short.
“Seriously?” he said. “You… don’t know?”
“But you’re…” Dean stared at Castiel, seeming suddenly caught in consternation.
But apparently Dean had told Charlie he didn’t want to break off his engagement, which had to mean that he did want to marry Lisa, and there was just some kind of block in his head about meeting her. Castiel had run into Dean’s blocks before. They’d once spent an entire year avoiding one particular boy at school because Dean was supposed to talk to him about Drama Club but he didn’t want to.
He passed Donna in makeup and gave her a quick thumbs up, heading out through the door and back into the main theatre. He took a seat at the end of the row of other auditionees, which was now around ten strong. The person sitting next to him - red-haired, with a label that said
“Yes,” he said. “I am.”
“You’re a fifteen-year-old vandal.”
if you don’t get yourself down here –”
“What d’you mean?” Dean went over to his windows, and pushed open the curtains. Outside, the sky was still a milky dark blue, but there was a promise of greyish-pink at the horizon that Castiel could just make out through the glass.
“What…” he says.
“But can you actually go without sex, like, indefinitely? Seriously, Dean, this is not the kind of thing you wanna figure out six months or a year down the line.”
Cas said.
“You don’t know what I’ll think of it.”
Dean said,
A moment later, Dean was behind him.
“Cool,” Dean said aloud. When the guy’s hand touched him, he swallowed.
Cas didn’t trust Dean - not enough to want to push their relationship to the next level, yet, or act on the way that he might be feeling. It definitely
“Mm,” he said.
“Thank you. Do you know if there’s any work, locally?” Castiel asked. “I’m hoping to pick up some odd jobs.”
“He doesn’t tend to move around much,” Dean said, with a little light in his eyes as though making a joke Castiel wasn’t quite in on.
“Would you... like, you know how we used to watch together, but would you still have watched the cartoons? If he had been?”
And all of it was pointless to think about it, because obviously Castiel didn’t like Dean. Ten chili dudes didn’t like seven-chili dorks.
Dean waited for just a second too long before asking,
Why had he even thought about asking Castiel on a date? Yeah, Castiel was hot. But that was just a fact. It didn’t mean Dean wanted anything to do with him in that way, not really. Dean wasn’t even thinking about dating at the moment. Hadn’t thought about it in ages. Or at least, had pushed away any thoughts that had popped up, because dating was dumb and usually ended badly anyway.
“Yeah,” Dean said, struck by the tinge of domesticity to the question; for a second, he could make-believe that they were going to be leaving together, heading home together, making some food together, planning a nice night in. The flash of imagining was like a split-second firework burst that he quickly pushed away. “Yeah, let’s go. Thanks again, guys.”
“I don’t know either,” he said.
Maybe he didn’t quite know that person yet, Castiel thought, as he went downstairs. But maybe he could get to know that person. He didn’t feel as though it would be too hard. In fact, it felt as though – as though this was a person he’d been trying to get to know for a long time, and he was just now getting a chance to.
The rest of the song was a blur of singing without paying attention, singing while thinking about what he’d done.
Pizza, in all of this, was something that made sense.
“Look at me, Cas,” Dean said. He stepped back a couple of paces, and held his hands out. “Look at me. What do you see?”
The words sounded hollow when he said them, but Hannah took him at his word. They nodded and turned back towards the car, the safe bubble of home that hadn’t been popped by the wind or the whispers of the trees or the sight of the beat-up house.
“Stay.”
“Drinks,” Jody said, reappearing and setting five bottles of beer down on the table. Hannah dropped into their seat a moment later, with a big pile of paper towels.
“Sam, I’m bisexual.”
“The barn?”
“Yeah?” Dean replied, trying to sound as though he wasn’t in the middle of the best crisis he’d had in forever. “It’s better when they mix them… in the store, you know.”
“Ah. You’ll have to take me.”
“Dean Winchester, everybody!” Cas said into his microphone; Dean could see Donna, now, as she clapped and whooped out at the far left of the little theatre’s seating, a crowd of one.
“Right,” Dean says.
“Makeup?” Dean said nervously.
“Not so bad,” Castiel said.
“I think I liked it better when you weren’t this talkative in the morning, actually,” Charlie said, deadpan.
“Yes.” The answer came without hesitation. Dean snorted.
“Honest,” Cas said. “Honest about what you want. Whatever it is, the choice is yours. I’m in your hands.”
“I’m Raphael. She, her.”
Dean swallowed. He picked up the pizza and held onto it, just for something to do. Part of him wanted Cas to stop, and part of him knew that he needed to hear this. How Cas knew all of this, saw it all so clearly, he had no idea.
“We’re starting again. This time, no more focus on respect. Respect is going to be something we earn, not demand.”
In his eyes, Dean could see nothing but sincerity. But surely Castiel had to know what he was doing, didn’t he? He had to know why Dean had come to his class, and he had to be making fun, now, of Dean’s attempt to replicate it. Even though the look in his eyes was so genuine.
“I’m not the Prince,” Castiel said.
“You mean… all these parties that I wasn’t invited to,” Dean said. “The Easter breakfast and the Halloween Spook Night and the Carolling last week - you mean, all of them, I was…”
He cleared his throat.
“It needs Dean, too,” Sam said. “Tell me you wouldn’t take him away anyway, if you could.”
“Is that… if you need time to get used to this – to us – we don’t have to do anything,” Castiel said. “Right now, whatever you want, I want to do that.”
Dean’s lips were soft. Castiel tightened his grip on Dean’s hand as a wave of physical sensation rushed through him, a kind of hot static, a feeling that demanded more.
“What do you mean?”
Dean pressed his lips together. Castiel watched him, even as they kept walking down the path, risking tripping over a stone or stray tree root. Dean’s face was taut, full of that confusion and sadness that Castiel still didn’t understand.
They weren’t just two people who’d got married. Books could be written about the fact that it had happened, one day. Eyes were on them.
Someone was there on the other side, looking right back at him.
Castiel could only see the back of her, as she stood facing the ungraceful knot of people at the front of the cathedral. He could only guess at her expression. Dean was watching her, a look on his face that asked a question. Not
Dean slowed, letting his mouth make tiny, easy movements. Back, and forth. Back, and forth. Castiel closed his eyes, his brows knitting as he worked to hold himself steady, but his legs were stretching out on either side of Dean, the muscles straining. God,
. A few people shrugged him off with a weird look, and
He was done acting calm. He was done holding it all in. He was
He glanced across at Dean, who was looking straight ahead, and then at Lisa, who was watching Charlie. She was probably also thinking that Castiel should be over there, Castiel thought. Or wishing that Charlie had challenged Castiel’s place in the photo.
“Definitely for that. Also for…” Dean swallowed. “Everything else.”
“Yes,” Castiel said. “It’s good. What were you saying about a do-over?"
“I might run out,” Dean said, “the door, if you don’t stop buying more jelly. And insisting it has to be kept in the fridge, even when it’s not been opened yet?”
“I mean it, though,” Castiel said. “You could.”
“Fine,” Castiel said again, but without any real bite to it. If he couldn’t have Dean lying in bed next to him, promising to break off the engagement and run away together, then at least he could have this: just the two of them, spending a little of what remained of their time being married all by themselves, at the old barn that had once been like a second home to them both.
“I’ll set your things down here on the porch, shall I?” said Hannah, coming up behind him. They glanced down at the fallen mobile. One of the bulbs of garlic had split off and rolled away. “Oh,” they said. “Maybe there are vampires living round here.”
“Dean,” Cas said, his eyes warm and bright. “You came! I wasn’t sure you would.”
Then -
Alone.
The ache in Castiel’s chest – the hurt that he’d taken, still crossing his heart after he’d given most of it back to Jess and the forest again – understood. It understood.
Dean still looks confused, as though he doesn’t really see the difference. To Castiel, though, it feels clear as day. He changed because he met Dean – without that meeting, he would still be the angel he’d always been. But when he thought about it, the person he changed
“No Angels?” Dean said. The thought was bizarre. He knew that Coastal city was across the Sudden Water, the flood that had risen up and swallowed a great swathe of land a few hundred years ago or more. They’d learned about it at school, but that had been a long time ago. “But… do they have a police at all?”
There was a pause. Dean tapped the screen.
Charlie pulled a face back at him. Dean gulped down two mouthfuls of coffee, willing it to ease the itchiness in his eyes, the thudding in his head, the almost undeniable urge to put his head down on the table in front of him and go to sleep.
He was almost at the door. There had to be something better than he could say. Something that sold himself a little more?
"Real healthy eater, huh?"
“Jesus,” Dean said quietly, but with feeling. “Cas.”
they were supposed to do this – but somehow Dean was close, and Castiel was leaning in a little closer still, and then their lips met.
“Ah. I see.”
Tentatively, Castiel reached forward with one hand, and touched Dean’s shoulder. Dean tensed for a moment, turning – and then saw Castiel, and seemed to relax back into the touch even as they walked.
Dean blinked.
“Well,” Castiel said. “Some of them - not me - but some people - think that you’re good-looking.”
“It’s against the law to steal.”
“I’m sure it will,” Castiel answered him, and managed a tight smile.
Dean chewed his lip as he read. He could see what Cas had meant. Catullus - he was saying things that Dean didn’t like a lot of the time, he was mean and he was petty and he was so
“Thank you. I try.”
“Oh, nice. ‘Course,” Sam said, his tone attempting to be normal.
They heard the door swing open slowly, cautiously, and then a gasp.
his hands looking a little clumsy, and then said while looking right at her, “Maybe I could get you a drink? I think I saw they had Orangina in the kitchen…”
On the table in front of her was a newspaper, bearing the picture that was already too familiar to Castiel.
“Do you think anyone else was there that we don’t know about?” Dean’s tone was light and joking, but with an undercurrent of real worry. It was true, Castiel realised: for all either of them remembered, the Queen herself might have been at the wedding in a banana costume and a party hat.
“Right,” Dean said, trying to nod casually.
Castiel wasn’t sure what to say to that, so he lifted one shoulder a little and let it fall, and the conversation died. Internally, Castiel shook his head. Had no one else noticed that Dean had been completely ignoring him for the past few months? They’d gone from hanging out at least once every week to never seeing each other at all. Whatever different things it was that Dean had been filling his time with, he’d have probably enjoyed those last night – a lot more than spending time with Castiel.
He wanted to hold Dean, but now just for the comfort, just to tell Dean wordlessly that he understood. That he felt Dean caring in the only way Dean knew how, trying to turn every injury toward himself.
ever had those kinds of feelings, then they would’ve faded long ago under the weight of his responsibility as heir to the crown of Corelia. Dean had to make a good match.
Castiel squints at him.
“But that isn’t why I did it.”
“But you… it’s…” Dean looks at him helplessly.
One of the emails was from an address he didn’t recognise. It had been sent a few days before, and the subject line only read, ‘Urgent’. Frowning, Castiel paused in his path towards the sofa and opened it.
the onscreen Dean asked.
the crashing.”
“I wanted to ask you that,” Dean said. He kept his hold on Castiel’s hand. “‘S far as I know, you haven’t ever really… I mean, we talked ages ago about how you’re not into hooking up with people, and I just wanted to check that you’re not – I mean, you don’t have to do this just ‘cause we’re married, you know, we can just – we can do whatever you want. Whatever.”
“And you’re better than fraying green and black leather,” the Angel said, sheathing his runeblade. “As I’ve been telling you for months. But you will keep showing up in that outfit.”
Dean swallowed.
He breathed out sharply. Enough thinking. Time to press play.
In Dean’s mind, though, he couldn’t help it – as the light from the screen flickered over their faces, he was replaying the moment Castiel drank Dean’s milkshake right out of his hand; he was replaying both times he’d leaned close to Castiel to take a drink in return. He was replaying the pleased expression on Castiel’s face when Dean had held the door open for him. He was thinking about it, round and round, feeling as though his chest was filling up ready to burst.
“Um,” Castiel said, “my apologies. My hangover…”
“How did you do that?” The voice sounded soft and genuinely interested. In its tones was breeze through branches, groans of tree-trunks.
Dean was halfway to his best attempt at a smile, ready to play the whole thing off as a joke, when –
A chance at what, though? What did he want? The elevator hummed to a halt and Castiel stepped out into the Underlight. The alleyway was gloomy and quiet, just as Castiel knew to expect. He took a moment to find his bearings, and then started to walk. No more patrolling pace, though, no more calm regularity. Now he hurried, his blood starting to pound again.
“About what?”
“I don’t know, I –”
“I’m just one guy,” Dean said. “And they’re a whole city.”
“You know, just kinda live with you. They tend to mostly stay out of sight. If you leave out milk, they’ll clean and mend and stuff. Sometimes they can be grouchy. Throw things. But if you talk to ‘em or sing to ‘em, you’ll be alright.”
He knew he should stop this - he should stop - but this was
“Yeah. Well, you know.” Dean looks distracted, frowning down at a squat little succulent plant. There’s something bothering him, obviously, and Castiel isn’t sure whether Dean wants to be asked about it or have it be left alone.
“Fuck, Cas,” he said. “Fuck. This is – fuck.”
“They’re back,” she said quietly. “There’s a new app. Works a bit differently, but it’s there.” Her face was carefully smooth, but her eyes were gleaming just a little. Typical Charlie, enjoying the tech workaround and the rebellion.
“You don’t know what you’d be without the pain?” Castiel broke his eye contact with Dean, and looked back to her.
“I – it’s not an insult,” Lisa said, sounding desperate. “It’s just that I… all those times Charlie came to see me in Someria, when you wouldn’t come… we just… I’m –”
Dean paused. He felt a smile starting at the corners of his mouth. He’d been so horribly sure that neither of them was going to have the courage to say anything about it. That they were going to go their separate ways, each not sure it was what the other wanted, but not ready to risk asking. But Castiel had said something. They were going to talk about it. A breeze picked up, and ran through Dean’s hair. Through his clothes. Soft clothes, not armour.
Dean stares back.
He sent it, and read another couple of poems as he fidgeted with his phone in the other hand. Before too long, the light of a return voice message lit up the palm of his hand, and he tapped to listen.
Dean stared at him.
“I haven’t been to Someria,” Castiel said, trying to take the attention away from Dean. “But I’ve read a lot of good things about it.”
“Cas,” Dean said, because his brain hadn’t caught up enough to say anything else.
Dean reached forward, and put a hand on her shoulder.
“I don’t - I don’t know what to think.”
“Hmm.” Charlie paused for a second, thinking, and then said, “You said you waited for him to give a big speech about actually making it a date, and
Ringing, humming, hungry silence. Watchful, judging audience. Cas’ eyes. Cas’ eyes.
“They’ll be okay.”
“It’s the pictures,” Castiel said heavily. “Isn’t it.”
“I don’t want it back. My grace. I know where it is. But I don’t want it back.”
“You could stay now,” he said, “right? You could actually stay. If you wanted to. And we could…” He stopped. “Yeah,” he said quietly.
There, he told himself. Gone. And every oddity and strangeness about the house was going to be dealt with, just like this one, and he was going to live a nice normal life here in the Samarbeid. Evening was starting to set in so he was just going to unpack a few of his things, make the place habitable for the night, and then set to work on the place properly in the morning.
Dean swallowed.
“Ah, you pick things up.” Dean smiled at him, and Castiel smiled back. They were cagey with each other, tentative. But underlining it were these moments, these drawn-out seconds where they caught each other’s eyes and didn’t quite manage to look away.
Dean went over to his cars, and put his hand on the Impala.
Dean felt a sudden clap on his back, and turned on his stool to see Ash standing behind him, half-dancing to the latest song that Dean hadn’t heard starting up -
“Gonna guess, at least?” she said. “Or is it first blood to me, today?”
After a few moments, his phone lit up with a text.
“It’s alright,” he said silently, hoping Dean could read his lips. “It’s fine. I’m just going to the tree.”
- sing on that stage in front of everyone. After all… he’d won, hadn’t he? He couldn’t be that bad? Unless this was all some kind of elaborate joke…
“No, I mean… us…” He intended to finish the sentence, but couldn’t find a way to do so.
So, did that mean...
Castiel kept going, mentioning a few websites that he thought Dean might like to look at and then sending them in the group chat for everyone to see. Dean nodded at them, and made filler noises as Castiel talked some more about different countertops.
But his tree would be less incredible and breathtaking now than he’d planned. Damn Castiel and his ever-so-slightly-earlier tree decoration. Dean had been about to conquer the neighbourhood. He’d have been the king of suburbia. The ruler of his local area. People would have made tapestries of his tree. They’d have sung songs about it a hundred years down the line. He was certain.
Showering quickly and then throwing on some clothes, Castiel left his room and went down the hall to Dean’s door. He tapped on it, the knock that he always did, and heard Dean say,
“It’ll be gone so long as you keep the wards up,” Dean said, stepping towards the door.
“Hey,” said a voice in his mind.
A pause.
In her place, Castiel would have torn it all down for Dean. He knew it then, more sharply and more clearly than ever before. Even in the face of all the hardship it might cause the country, even though it would be selfish and emotional and single-minded, Castiel would have torn down the royal house of Winchester just to see the aching tension in Dean’s shoulders ease.
Castiel knew he should have expected this, the awkwardness. Hadn’t he known Dean long enough, at this point, to be able to predict him? And there was nothing more predictable than Dean not wanting to talk about something.
“Good,” Dean said, not quite truthfully. He felt as though he’d managed to claw his way to the top of a ledge that he’d slipped off into a deep chasm, and now he was on solid ground again, but the chasm was still there behind him. “I don’t even know what happened…”
“Then let’s get out of here,” Dean said, feeling everything - his future, Cas’ future, the balance of what was to come - swinging around the fulcrum of those words, dipping and swaying into new angles.
When he reached the window, Dean almost spat out his mouthful of coffee.
Castiel took his phone away from his ear. There had been something so wretched and barely-concealed in Dean’s tone that Castiel himself was upset, his stomach twisting. He looked down at his phone screen.
“No more nexes. They started off trying to do something good. But it was too easily turned to something wrong.”
“You kept what happened in Las Vegas a secret. You didn’t have to do that. And I know you didn’t do it for me, but it allowed us this long to try to figure out a way to handle it. So, thank you.”
“Yes,” he said. And after a moment, he added, “Thank you, your Grace. Yes, I’ll be there.”
“Come back,” Castiel said. It was easier to talk to him when he wasn’t smiling.
“Hey,” said a dark-haired person, who walked up to Dean from the aisle that ran down the centre of the tiered seating with a confident smile, hand outstretched, eyes flicking down to Dean’s label. “Dean, nice to meet you. I’m Jody, she and her. Do you have your music?”
“I’m into some old classics stuff,” Dean said, the words coming out more shyly than he’d intended. “I like reading Homer and Virgil and stuff.”
“Dude, if this is a joke…”
He took a hurried, unthinking step towards the fridge, grabbed the Save the Date, and tore it down the middle. It wasn’t enough. He ripped it again, tearing it into shreds that he dropped, and it still wasn’t enough. Curling his hand closed tightly, Castiel turned to the wall and smashed his fist into it, as hard as he could.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just give me what’s in the bag and I won’t hurt you,” the asshole said. High voice, calm and clear. Dean saw the figure on the ground squirm, heard them gasping for breath.
He couldn’t see the lower half of the Angel’s face, couldn’t see the look in his eyes through that eye-tech he was wearing, but he knew the Angel well enough by now to sense that he was amused. Not for the first time, Dean wondered who this Angel was when he wasn’t down here in the Underlight streets.
sooooo… dean and castiel… they’re gonna become a thing right… pls tell me…
They were sitting just outside of the clearing, on a bed of leaves. The white tree still stood at the centre of a circle of bare earth. But something had changed.
Her expression allowed no argument. Unwillingly, Dean allowed her to loop their arms together, Lisa pinning Dean to her side and turning back to the game, calling out to support Ben as he went for a tackle. Dean stood quietly. He was having to lean down ever so slightly so that Lisa could keep his arm tucked under hers.
“I’m good, Bobby,” he said. “I like it here just fine, okay.” He started to walk away. “Except I’ve been telling you for years about the damn overalls. We look like we work in a prison.”
“Right. Well. Unless there’s anything else…?” Balthazar said, seemingly unfazed. Castiel wondered how many people he usually had traipsing through his doors, trying to unmake history. If he’d started rating them by hygiene, Castiel thought as he remembered the start of their conversation, probably a lot of them.
Dean murmured something.
“Anyway,” Dean said, reaching for a way to move the conversation forwards. “Shall we keep practising? I think I got it, just -”
“Listen,” he said. “I had a conservative upbringing…”
“Sold out show. Fourteen thousand capacity, and it’s sold out.”
“What did you say?”
“I didn’t mean…” Castiel broke off when he saw the glint of humour in Dean’s eyes. “You know what I mean.”
“The full ten chilis, yeah.” Dean watched Castiel digesting this information, blue eyes searching Dean’s face for any sign of a lie or a trick. “And I’m a seven, so. I don’t know, dude. Seems pretty conclusive to me.” Somehow it didn’t cost Dean anything at all to tell Castiel he had the most chilis in the school, not now – not after hearing the way Castiel himself felt about Dean. The opinions of a bunch of students had never felt less important. Castiel thought that Dean was out of his league. And he was wrong, sure, but Castiel actually
“Announced?” Dean called from the wing.
“Okay. Me too.”
And the pain said,
“Yeah, I get it,” he said aloud. “Like, there’s something about how these people were alive all that time ago, but they were still
“He might,” Cas said. “You never know.”
“Yeah. Really, really good.”
“It’s a surprise, Dean.”
“Hi,” said a muffled voice from a doorway behind the counter off to one side, and then a man wearing a brown plaid shirt came out into the main store. “Oh – hey, Dean. Hey, new guy.”
He felt calm.
“Really?”
“I don’t know. He was okay with it, like, he didn’t tell me I shouldn’t do it or anything. He just was, like… more surprised about that part, I think. In a bad way.”
If he just gave Sam some time to figure things out, wrap his head around it - do some googling, see all that there was to see and come to terms with it - then maybe they could talk about it again afterwards. Maybe then Sam wouldn’t be so down on the idea. Especially when Dean told him that this didn’t really change anything. Sure, Dean could sing, but he was still just Dean. Just a mechanic.
. The Prince of our country cannot be a man who’d promise marriage to one person and then marry someone else.”
“I’ll scan it before we leave the meds, and see if anyone’s in the apartment.”
Dean spent most of the time thinking about the kitchen island, and Castiel’s hair, and what it had felt like when Castiel had ditched him.
“I didn’t know you weren’t human,” Castiel said softly. “You didn’t say.”
“Oh,” Castiel said. “I’m glad you liked that.”
Dean breathed out.
It was a blow. It was the sudden dousing of a spark of hope. Dean felt his chest go hollow.
“I’m serious. It’s like a… thing,” Dean said, getting more awkward with every word, but he needed Charlie to know this. He needed her to trust his feelings, like he trusted them - absolutely and completely. He hated seeming flighty, or shallow, in her eyes. “My, like, my - like, it feels so fucking good to be around him. It’s just… it feels like the kind of thing you read about. I never thought people actually
“Out,” Anna yelled suddenly. “Everyone, back. By the terms of this project’s contract, this work is no longer lawful pending an investigation into the existence in this area of an endangered species.”
With no hesitation, now, no pause for thought, Gabriel said,
“What are we talking about?” she said.
“But,” Claire said, “you can come hang out after it’s over.”
and have to go through with singing in front of thousands of people at a concert with Castiel, of all people, and there was no way Dean could pass
“We have to go to Charlie,” Castiel said, half an hour later. Jo was sitting on the sofa in the corner of Dean’s room, scrolling on her phone, while Dean and Castiel paced in front of her.
“It was more the feeling that they could have happened at any time,” Castiel said. “And I couldn’t have said no to them.”
The first guitar strains played and the crowd clapped politely. The song was an old one and Dean didn’t expect it to get a lot of response, but hearing the familiar slow riff calmed his heartbeat, settled him on the stage.
“And it’s protect
“Seriously,” he said, “switch it off.”
“Cas?
“Fine,” he said. “Going. But you better have your ass on the couch when I get back in. We are gonna watch the crap out of that sword-making show on Netflix.”
“What?” he demanded. “Did I say something wrong?”
“Thanks,” Dean said, and this time Castiel did hear the sardonic tone of his voice. So did Charlie, apparently, because her head jerked up and she narrowed her eyes at Dean.
Dean turned away from him. Castiel was so angry he couldn’t speak, couldn’t say anything more. He found his treacherous eyes tracing the lines of Dean’s body.
Dean felt, suddenly, quietly intense - almost outright angry - at the fact that Cas should be unused to hearing that he was beautiful, handsome, whatever, all of it. Someone should have been telling him that every damn day until Dean arrived to take over.
Dean froze.
“There have been people in my past who haven’t been open to me being who I am,” he said. “Any anger I’ve been showing towards you has been misplaced, meant for them. You deserve better than second-hand anger. But it's… it's - I get lost in it, sometimes.”
and he wanted to do it again - and Castiel had that small smile back on his face, and Dean couldn’t resist it. When he leaned up and kissed Castiel again, he let it go on longer, let his body sway in closer, and then Castiel’s hand was pressed to his cheek, was moving back into his hair -
Castiel lifted up his head. He met Dean’s eyes. Something unspoken passed between them, some acknowledgement that the moments of eye contact and occasional touches had been equally felt, had meant the same thing.
“Got something?” the Hunter said.
The silence was ringing.
“Cas, I don’t - I don’t even have music. I don’t have experience. I’m a shower-singer. I’m - Christ, can you imagine if I actually win this thing and I have to sing a damn song with Castiel? He’d laugh at me.”
Well - not that he
Dean grinned. The tears had dried on his cheeks.
Castiel nods. He doesn’t want to let it go – feels sick at the idea of Dean just dropping the subject, and heading back inside, leaving the garden and forgetting all about what they’d said to each other. Chalking it up as somewhere he’d never go again. Too much baggage, too heavy, not worth it.
- but it had eaten at him for weeks and he'd known she could feel it and he hadn't been able to stop it. It had taken him so long to trace the anger back to fear, and his fear to the danger and judgement that he'd been taught in just a few words and facial expressions back when he was small.
When Dean looked at him, Castiel met his gaze. He didn’t say anything.
Dean takes his hand, and holds onto it. Not sweetly, not softly. Hard. Like they’re at the top of a cliff and Dean’s afraid of losing his grip and having to watch Castiel fall alone.
“Some creatures are just like that,” he said. “Belief will shape you. Expectation, belief, whatever you wanna call it. Usually it’s kinda general. The belief’s like… like air, it’s all around, it’s just there. All the stories and things people say about a creature just kinda build up and then that’s what they look like.” Dean kicked at a rock on the path. “And then other times when you come into contact with a specific human, it’s less like air, more like a wind. Shaping you deliberately, like… individually.”
“Could’ve killed you,” Dean mumbled. Cas smiled wryly.
“I know.” Charlie seemed uncertain of where to go. “I just… I think it’s gonna be okay. It sucks that you have to worry about it at all but I think it’s gonna be okay, Dean. And if it’s not, you’ve got a bunch of people who have your back, and I’m first in line, okay? Me, and Jo, and everyone at The Refuge, we know how this shit goes. We have you.”
“I will,” he said.
Dean’s chest seized.
They sat and talked as their drinks were made; Cas listened to Dean talk about cars, and they ordered more drinks, and Dean listened to Cas talk about cocktail-making and book-binding and bee-keeping - what a guy, he thought, as they ordered their third round. What a guy. Bee-keeping. What the fuck. And then they both sat and listened to each other talk about their favourite places to visit, and then Dean asked another question about the bee-keeping (
“Yeah. But right now, man, I’m just happy to see you,” Dean said, and was rewarded with a quick blink and a surprised curve of Cas’ mouth.
“So become something else,” Castiel said.
“Hello, Dean,” he said, and Dean let go of his hand.
Claire raised an eyebrow at him.
“Wow,” Sam said, as he entered the main courtyard of the palace from the South wing. “I didn’t know this walk was gonna be a real… expedition.”
The sauna was in the Scandinavian style, with wood panelling and wooden benches. Castiel cracked open his eyes to take a peek, and saw the other bachelors splayed out across the seats, most of them not bothering to cover up with a towel. Dean was close by, sitting in front of Castiel, and Castiel wasn’t looking at him.
The chorus broke in again; Dean remembered this song from the radio, and yes, it had been softer and more touching than anything else Dean had heard by Castiel - but now, with Cas singing it, Dean could hear the weight in every word. The longing, the begging, the hopefulness, the ache.
Castiel felt his muscles flood with cold. His teeth gritted. There, on the ground, was red. A dried spread of redness. Blood.
He moved as quickly as he dared, one hand held up and clasped in a very loose fist.
“And they’re very nice walls. But they’re not your walls.”
“Thanks, Mom.”
“The lightknife’s out,” he said to the Angel. “You can leave it.”
And it had been months since they’d gone up to the barn together.
“Why?”
“Jo?” he said.
The two of them walked on in silence. When they rounded a bend in the path and found themselves looking at the lake – a wide, clear blue expanse of water hugged by grassy banks – they stopped, and waited for Charlie and Lisa.
“Why did you ask me if it wasn’t that?” Castiel said. “Was it – a joke?”
“I suppose,” Cas said thoughtfully, his eyes searching the room without seeing it as he considered, “he has a lot to learn about you. Sam, I mean. It must feel frightening for him.”
His overpowering urge, now, was to be honest. He swallowed hard, and then let himself be.
“Uh,” Dean said.
“It’s not about the chili peppers,” Dean said impatiently. “Look, maybe I just really want to try something new, you know? Did you ever consider that?”
“You don’t have to say anything,” Castiel says.
He looks at Dean.
“Get dressed,” Dean said, not even acknowledging Castiel’s agreement – he’d known it was coming. “And can you throw me my phone so I can text Charlie and tell her we’re going?”
“Look,” Dean said. He looked over at her, dipped his head to catch her eyes. “Dude... you came all the way over here and talked me out of whatever was going on with me. I, uh. Never would’ve doubted that you care. And I’m sorry about the joke. Seriously. You… I mean we… I mean, I hope we’re cool, because, like… yeah.” The atmosphere in the car was awkward, now - they’d never really done this, never spoken about their own relationship much. Dean put on a higher, slightly nasal voice. “Charlie Bradbury, you’re my hero.”
And the black jeans… when Dean turned around, his eyebrows went up. He actually... kind of... had an ass, in these jeans. This was what Castiel had been seeing when he’d said that Dean looked good.
"Yeah, well. Sure, yeah, you could’ve handled it, but - you know, it had to be a secret. I couldn’t make you keep a secret like that from Mom and Dad.”
“Because,” Dean said, “I’m a dumbass?”
“I guess so.” Dean shrugged. “Look. You had a good idea about how to get rid of this thing that’s been screwing up me and my brother’s life for years. So I asked you to come help with it. It’s nothin’ more than that. Nothing strange about helping out a neighbour, is there?”
He wanted this to be a date. He wanted it
Castiel stared at her. And for a second, he couldn’t help but hate her, just a little. She had the weight of a country’s wellbeing on her shoulders and he knew why she had to try to pull this off – she’d explained it all to him, the economy, the riches of Someria, the politics. But in front of her was her son, clearly letting himself be trapped in a cage that she was building around him, allowing her to do it just because he loved her that much.
“Coffee first.”
He caught sight of a few faces he knew, through the glass. Mostly, though, he could just see the tree.
“No,” Dean said, “but I know that I’m –”
At the mention of Dean’s upcoming marriage to someone else, Castiel could feel his stomach turning again.
“You’ve gotta do something,” he said. “You’ve gotta stop them.”
“Narwhal, perhaps.”
“No…” Dean swallowed. “No. I’m, uh. I’m singing.”
Castiel stared down at the marks in the dust. He thought about the tools he’d bought and the cleaner he had and how he could possibly set some traps. But were these creatures dangerous? It seemed as though they’d got in here, fixed his sink, and were now nowhere to be seen or heard.
“Hi, Castiel,” Charlie said easily, as Dean typed out a quick salvo of messages to her.
“Chili peppers? They got rid of those, didn’t they?” Dean said, stifling a yawn. Charlie leaned forward.
good. A balm for the times they were living through together.
Dean gaped at him, genuinely speechless.
“Shit,” Dean said, and grabbed for Castiel’s hand again, and pulled him away down the alley.
She kept rambling, filling up the space so that Dean couldn’t get an argumentative word in edgeways. He wasn’t sure he even had the words to be able to protest with, anyway. He scrubbed a hand over his face, and then looked down at his toe, which hadn’t enjoyed the trip on the rug.
that took the fight out of Claire. Just the admission of feelings, of Castiel being angry too, had her shoulders slumping and her eyes dropping to the floor.
Castiel closed his eyes.
“Not to me,” Dean said flatly. “I like sex but I don’t want it with Cas. I just want Cas. And I like Cas. If you asked me right now if I wanted to hook up with a stranger or chill with Cas, that’s not even a choice.”
He looked so beautiful. Castiel reached up a hand, and slid his fingers up the soft skin of Dean’s stomach, over his flat chest, lingering at the edge of the darker circle of his nipple. He heard Dean draw in a breath.
“Okay. I need to pee. You gonna call that last number?”
“Can I help you?” said the stranger. “Are you lost?”
“So,” he said.
any doubt that the
The gaze wavered, and then held. They stared at each other for a moment across the cabin. Dean visibly swallowed.
"He gets that look sometimes, like he's happy," Dean said. "Happy people are assholes."
“What?” Dean said. The bottom had dropped out of his tone somehow, become more intimate.
“We can’t give you any information about that, sir,” said the woman on the end of the phone, sounding unconcerned.
“Who’s there with us?” Castiel asked him, trying to keep his tone easy. “Elton John?”
“But I can’t just make it go away,” Sam said. “Can I?”
“Oh, shit,” Sam said, sounding impressed. “Like, backstage? Technical stuff, do they have machinery?”
“Who told you?”
The first time someone had come out around Dean, he'd been
“I’ll help get your things in,” Hannah said.
“Atta boy. Making a difference.” Dean pretended to mop a tear from his eye.
And when he’d noticed Dean in his class, he’d decided to go and see Dean’s in return. Yes, probably just to make him squirm, as a warning not to keep creeping. But possibly,
and spent half an hour trying to understand the various complexities and loopholes of his country’s marriage laws. He felt sicker with each passing second. There was nothing more he could do with the lawyers, short of calling them up and demanding they hurry things along – but surely that would only get him in their bad books, and might even make them deliberately slow down the case out of spite.
Sunday, when he was going to meet Castiel at the movie theatre to see Tombstone. Just the two of them. Just Dean, and the hottest professor. The professor with the bluest eyes and the deepest voice. The professor with ten chilis. If Dean had been thinking, today, of trying to ask Castiel out on a date, he wouldn’t have held out hope for success – but somehow, he already was going somewhere with Castiel. He’d already got a yes, from when he’d barely even let himself notice that Castiel existed.
But now Castiel was just
“It wasn’t on purpose,” he muttered. “It just seemed easier this way.”
He let his voice be shy and rich and sweet and smoky and in tune - the way he never let it be around Sam or in the outside world - and he felt the audience stop and breathe in, just like they always did.
Dean kissed so gently.
“But –”
mean, Dean texted back in confusion,
He was going to clean, too. Clean and unpack. He was determined.
“You two are perfect for each other.”
“And, it was good,” Dean said, pulling the menu towards him with his free hand. “Yeah, he just… he was great about it.”
“Yeah?”
“We’re just outside the city,” Charlie said, before Dean could answer. “And it’s not that well-known, actually.”
“Nothing,” Castiel said. “I was just thinking.”
“Of course,” Castiel said.
“I thought we…” Castiel lost his courage mid-sentence, and swerved abruptly. “You’re just not usually this awake in the morning.”
It felt like Dean was meeting someone who’d definitely
“Dude,” Dean said.
Castiel. Dean rolled his eyes even thinking about him as he unravelled the first string of lights. The guy just always had to one-up Dean. At Easter, it was a big colourful egg display in his front yard. At Halloween, it was spiderwebs strewn through his shrubbery and an automated skeleton that laughed and waved. And at Christmas, it was always the most impressive tree standing proudly in his big front window.
“Look,” he said wretchedly, “Cas, you gotta just tell me. Has something changed for you? About… about us?”
at a time. Singular.”
Dean wanted to protest - wanted to say that he was pretty sure everyone else inside the house hated him, and he wasn’t really ready to go ahead and try to change their hard-earned opinions of him, and he really only wanted to spend more time out here with Castiel and then maybe find some other place to go together with just the two of them that was maybe kind of warmer and had more food - but he let himself be pulled towards the door. Castiel walked up the couple of steps, Dean in tow. Castiel let go of his hand to open the door, and then stood on the threshold.
“Dude, listen. It’s going to be like, one Zoom call. Maybe two. Everything else you guys can do via email. And he’ll be completely professional, I’m like, one hundred percent sure.”
He lifted up one hand and twisted it in a vague pattern, watching the light of the morning catch on his skin.
“That’s… nice, though,” Dean said. “You’re giving them a Christmas at home with their families. That’s really… that’s good, man.”
’t want a second date with you is a jerk.”
Twenty feet away from him, standing completely still, was a figure. Not struggling with carrier bags or strollers or wallets and keys like the other shoppers going into and out of the mall. Utterly stone still.
“Well, hiya!” said an exceptionally cheerful voice, as Dean poked his head through the first open door he found leading off the corridor. The owner of the voice looked down to his label. “Nice to meet you… oh, so you’re Dean!”
“It’s cool,” Dean said, and when Charlie said goodbye, he hung up.
But Dean isn’t saying anything. He’s just staring. And Castiel stares, too. He can’t argue back when Dean hasn’t started the fight. He can’t push back if Dean never pushed forward. So they stand in silence. The clouds overhead roll on, oblivious to the hearts frantically pounding so far beneath them.
“You will.”
“Dear god.” Somehow, having seen the video, this wasn’t such gut-crushing news; at least now he knew what it was that everyone was seeing, what they were all reacting to and sharing and yelling about to each other. “But they - I mean, are the comments nice?”
A big, warm hand was taking his own, and another hand was under his elbow, gently encouraging him to move back.
“Oh – well – I saw you in my class, yesterday. So I thought maybe you might want me to come to yours.”
Castiel didn’t understand. He swallowed hard.
time we get home.”
For a moment, Castiel let his teeth unclench. He relaxed his brow. He unwound the locked-up muscles all down his back. For a moment, Castiel stopped believing that he was still shaped like himself despite the pain.
Charlie’s head jerked up.
“It’s not that bad. I just need to find a little income. Maybe I could try online consulting. Put my law degree to some use.”
As he dried his hair quickly with a towel and dressed, he tried to pull himself together.
“Gordon,” the man said. “You moved in recently, then?”
Dean narrowed his eyes at the lights.
some kind of instant magical connection. Right?
On Dean’s laptop, Sam made a face of confusion at the camera.
“I get veto power over any weird crap you try to put into the design, though.”
And then one of his strong arms was around Castiel’s waist, pulling him in closer. And Castiel was being kissed, kissed deeply, kissed like he knew a kiss between him and Dean would always be –
Castiel licked his lips, and tried to look casual as he leaned back against the kitchen counter.
You’re going to look so dumb. You’re a seven-chili loser going after a red-hot ten-chili professor.
Castiel couldn’t help thinking.
Castiel stopped fighting. He unclenched his hands. He looked up into the twin chasms of her eyes. The cold dark pain didn’t lessen, not even slightly. But when he eased his muscles, he could talk.
“Yeet,” he read, sounding confused.
“If…” Castiel swallowed. “But there’s no… but…
“That’s unhealthy,” Dean said.
When Castiel leaned over to grab a handful of popcorn, Dean said,
enough. Maybe around three percent of enough, on a good day with a fair wind. Cas, in full view of everyone, could only talk with his eyes as Balthazar congratulated everyone who had taken part; those eyes seemed to be saying a lot of eloquent and complicated things all in one single expression, and Dean couldn’t understand any of them.
Not this year. This year, it would be the
Just a brief kiss, really. Just a moment, when their lips were pressed and their eyes were closed and everything was exactly as it should be, right here in their little world within a world.
Dean only realised how rarely he got a follow-up question to the second half rather than the first when it came out of Cas’ mouth; people round where he lived tended to be more the car type than the bookish type, or at least as far as they let on to Dean, and that was okay by him - but it did make a nice change.
He looked over at Cas, who smiled at him, and he smiled back. From inside, a song started up, and Dean watched Cas’ eyes light up.
“Um,” he managed. Jo wasn’t smiling, wasn’t obviously joking. Her question had been just… sincere, easy, like it was the most natural thing in the world to ask. Castiel didn’t know how to answer her. He thought his fingers had gone numb.
Behind her back, Castiel turned to look at Dean.
He looked at Dean, and it was alright. It was alright. Dean could breathe.
She’d noticed – of course she had, they probably all had. Claire hadn’t said a word any of the other times Castiel had been to Saint Crispin’s in the last few months, but she’d been filing away each time that he’d come alone.
He gulped down a mouthful, and felt a closer kinship to Sam than before. Finding out about Cas’ sexuality had been one thing, but finding out he was famous - that had, somehow, been something else. Sam had to be going through something similar, or - in fact - even more intense. It was one thing to think you knew a lot about someone you’d met the day before; it was something else to think you knew your own sibling, and it turned out they were overnight famous for a skill you hadn’t even known they had. Siblings were supposed to know these kinds of things about each other, weren’t they? Or at least, siblings who were close.
“I’m as good as.”
Heart in his throat, Castiel waited. Dean looked so handsome that Castiel wanted to break something. And when Dean reached him, it was almost unbearable.
“I don’t know,” Castiel says. If how he feels, or what he’s doing, is wrong, then he should look away. He should
The butterfly flapped its wings on the tree, catching the sunlight so the bright green flashed.
“Like, this place, I’ve always wanted to put up some stuff in it, you know? Like, get some posters and frame ‘em for the walls, maybe get some, uh, some throw pillows or some shit.” He tried to say the words carelessly, like he barely knew the name for comfortable, tasteful accents to a room, let alone really wanted them - and then remembered he was with Cas, and shook his head at himself. “I dunno. I see things all the time that I wanna pick up and just have around. Books and plants, and this set of coffee mugs in pink and blue and purple… I just… you know, my brother comes and visits me here sometimes. I didn’t want…”
“So maybe you need to
“Because,” Castiel said. “I don’t work here, and I’m not… I’m not your fiancé.”
“Jess,” Castiel confirmed.
“I… I should have,” Cas said. “I know I should have found a way. I just… I didn’t lead with it, and it’s hard to just… drop it into conversation…”
“We just have to find a way to get it… to undo it.”
What those things could be… Castiel closed his eyes briefly against the thought of Dean’s fiancée, and the time they must have been spending together. What those things could be, Castiel wasn’t sure.
in his hands, reading it with complete absorption.
“No. I just… I thought I was the only person for miles.”
“Today was alright,” he mumbled.
“Hi,” she said. “How are you?”
to be Castiel. All the time.”
“Now… yeah, whatever. And meanwhile I’m just…”
His stomach grumbled. Castiel headed back down the stairs. He watched where he put his feet, this time, and didn’t let the running shadows distract him. Were they moving faster than before? Were they darker?
“I thought I knew your face,” they said. “What, did you run away to live in this backwater? Or are butterflies the only clients who’ll hire you, these days?”
“Absolutely. Nah, but I was just thinking, if it were the other way round, and you were pissed at me for not telling you that I, like, work with cars, I’d be like… dude…maybe I just didn’t wanna say, didn’t think it was relevant, and anyway I don’t have to, because I don’t owe you crap. Just because
“Okay. Okay. Listen. If Castiel said yes to you, then the chances are, he wanted to go with
“Yes,” Castiel said. “I’ll send the email.”
“Listen to your mom, Dean. In you go.”
“Well… it’s all very cliché,” Cas said. “I went out to The Refuge looking for one night off. One night to try out being a normal guy. I didn’t expect…” He gestured at Dean, encompassing the whole of him with a simple movement, as though words couldn’t contain it but an open-palm lift of his hand could manage. “I didn’t expect any of this to happen. I knew it was a mistake to go out, and then I knew it was a mistake to keep talking to you and getting to know you, and I knew it was a mistake to invite you today... I knew it was stupid, but I just…”
Once again, Castiel was left with nothing to say. He just what? He just had needed an escape, any escape, from having to tell the truth to Dean, because they were married, or rather, they were
They broke off and gawped at each other for a long, long moment. The room around them was surreal to Dean, staring into Castiel's eyes.
Dean, Dean, Dean.
Dean collapsed into the elevator, tasting iron in his mouth. He spat and saw red.
“Yeah?” he said, the single word spoken too fast, coming out sharply - like a dinner knife that slipped through his fingers and became a weapon.
“Dude. No. I just feel bad that, like, I wasn’t… like, I wish I’d seemed more like someone you could trust, I guess.”
“Yeah, I… you too,” Dean said. He could feel himself starting to grin, as what had just happened started to sink in. He’d just made out with Castiel in the street. Castiel, who looked completely soaked through, his hair sticking up in all directions, his coat dark and heavy-looking – Castiel, who also looked so incandescently happy that it was unmissable.
Castiel looked over at Dean, who turned to face him. In silence, they stared at each other.
Castiel got to his feet, and heard Dean standing up behind him.
*slams fists on the table* PANCAKE FLUFF. PANCAKE FLUFF. PANCAKE FLUFF.
“Oh, you’re going to Gordon’s? I can show you the way.”
When the letter arrived through the door, it did so with a very ordinary
Dean stood up. He'd said to Sam that he would go home; he hadn't said
The man’s footsteps sounded strange on the floor, loud and echoey. Castiel stared into the dark beyond him down the hallway, but could see nothing except shadows. His pulse was racing. His breath was coming harder and harder and in his mind, he was shrinking – he was tiny, he was impossibly small, he was a flea on the back of a great black huge nothing –
“Yeah. She always did. You remember, Ellen Harvelle? She came in and gave us all that talk about how to deal with bad publicity.”
“No,” Castiel said without hesitation. “No, I don’t. I think that’s what’s strange.”
“No, you’re not, you’re fine…” Dean’s reassurances were thin, despite his best efforts. He tried to pull himself together, remember how to hold a conversation.
There was a crumbling sensation inside him, as the walls he’d tried to put up between himself and this exact realisation were breached at last. The sensation was pain and resignation, deep and bass, with just a little light fluting hum of adrenaline and happiness over the top.
Dean glanced around the nearby tables. Mostly people from the older generations. He swallowed down the urge to lean forward and go for a kiss, right now, in the middle of the restaurant. The last thing he wanted was to get cursed out by an old homophobe - or a young one - on today of all days. But because it
“Your pronouns,” the woman said, with a little smile. “Like he and him, or she and her, or they and them, or…?”
“Well, I mean. Most of them. The ones who’ve seen you. They do…” Castiel was looking distinctly embarrassed. Dean stared at him. What Castiel could possibly have to be embarrassed about in this situation, he had no idea. Whatever it was, there was no way it was as bad as trying and mostly failing to sabotage a Christmas party that he didn’t know he’d been invited to. “It’s nothing,” Castiel said. “It doesn’t matter.”
And Castiel had looked into Dean’s eyes, and said
“I know,” Castiel said to himself, and threw off the covers. Yes, he could called Hannah and accept the texts and calls of derision from crowing former colleagues. Yes, he could call his brother back. Yes, he could call a taxi, though he had no money for a long ride, and the only way he’d have enough money would be to take the taxi directly to his brother’s house and ask him to pay it, and that would be a thousand times worse than just calling his brother back.
“Come back to my room,” Dean said. “Just to sleep.”
“I wasn’t –” Dean tried to say.
said the voice in his head again, with even more certainty.
The beacons are lit! The fic update calls for aid!! Hope you enjoy Dean struggling his way through both an audition and his own feelings. The next update is in a week, on Friday 26th April. Remember to subscribe if you want a notif for when it goes up, and upon request I will also send a raven.
“You think I have a chance?”
Cas looked surprised, but nodded, and dropped his hand from Dean’s arm. On legs that were numb, Dean walked up towards the gaudy glitter-covered stage, the microphone already hissing and whining in his hand as he passed the speakers. People were clapping and cheering for him as he went, but he couldn’t hear them properly. He couldn’t feel his fingers. He couldn’t feel his hair. Could he normally feel his hair?
He was screwed. He was outed to everyone. Sam was going to see the video and be disgusted. He was so, so, so screwed. God, and he’d thought the video would get a few thousand views. Who cared about some random people that Castiel had sung with? Who cared enough to watch a whole video about them? No one, he’d thought, like an idiot.
“What do you have there?” the lawyer, Anna, demanded.
He heard Dean swallow.
“So… you’ve guessed who I am. I don’t want to talk too much right now and take up too much time, so I’m just going to thank you all so much for being here and for those performances you gave, and hand it over to the judges. I’m just here to see you all sing, today, and we can chat properly at the concert in a couple of weeks - because you’re all personally invited to a private meet and greet before the show.” He still sounded like Cas, but he was saying things that a celebrity would say, a pop star, someone whom everyone was desperate to meet and who therefore knew he had to manage expectations. Dean didn’t know what to think about that, didn’t know what he should be feeling. It felt like he was swimming in pool made of liquid air, slow-moving and impossible, barely breathable. “So for now, let’s hear the decision!”
It was a sloppy introduction, Castiel noticed, having gone through enough of them to know – but he understood Charlie’s distraction when the Duchess made an elegant bow of her head and said,
Around them, the palace workers arranged flowers and carried dishes and smoothed tablecloths and hurried to and fro.
Dean broke off the kiss, and looked at Castiel in the eyes.
The wind through the trees.
Castiel thought of the dragging shadow monster, and felt his throat close up.
“Yeah. I – sorry about being inside your head. I don’t normally do this. But you were about to die, so. I thought I’d just come in and help.”
“My pleasure,” Castiel said.
“Whatever.” Sam dropped the hug, the light in his eyes betraying the put-on crossness in his tone.
“No, it’s alright. I know what you mean and I agree with you. I… it’s…”
After all, soon he wouldn’t be able to do this. Soon, Cas would be gone. Off to other cities and other people. Back to getting up on the stage, back to singing. Back to the mask.
The dawn light was painting pinks and light blues with uncertain, hopeful strokes against the sky.
“Do you think people get that too?” he asked. “Ever?”
“Then think about it,” Charlie said, and then softened her voice. “Just – think about it, okay?”
“I know. You could tell, just by watching.” His voice was accusatory, clearly dissatisfied. “She’s always been a bit…”
He turned around to fetch his pizza, and gave a sharp yell of surprise.
Dean said, but his voice didn’t make a sound, and then he’d woken up in a sweat. Sometimes calling out.
was the good-looking one. And maybe things would go from there, and maybe they wouldn’t. But at least he could give it a go. Maybe Castiel would at least feel flattered, even if he wasn’t interested.
“S’not possible.”
Castiel surfaced from sleep with his face crushed up against a wrinkled pillow, and the first thing he saw was Dean’s face.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Weird now?” he said.
“But – I would’ve looked ridiculous!”
“That’s impossible…” Dean said, but trailed off uncertainly as the second verse kicked in.
When he blinked back to reality, Charlie was smiling.
He just wanted to sit next to Castiel in the theatre and watch the damn movie. He could see it now, in his mind’s eye. Just the two of them. Watching Tombstone. Sharing a popcorn. Maybe their hands would reach for it at the same time. Maybe they’d look over at each other –
“Dean’s never insulted someone like that before in front of me,” he said, trying to be honest enough to seem open while not telling her anything particularly important. “Out of nowhere.”
Castiel looked down at the big white branch on his porch. He thought about the new pain in his chest. He thought about Dean, and the revenant, and the wards, and everything that had happened since he’d last spoken to his brother back in New York.
“Can’t have the head chef breaking his arm,” Lisa said, her hand still out.
written on it. A drunken attempt at writing
The silence turned sharp. Castiel listened to the sound of the rolling waves hissing up and down the sand, and breathed. There was that sea breeze again, easing the tightness in his chest. All he wanted was to forget about the words, the worries, the thousand reasons why it was a bad idea, and just lean over to Dean and let the rest happen. He wanted Dean close. He wanted to hold him and be held. He could feel the seconds of his life where he was Dean’s husband ticking away, the seconds in which it might possibly be okay for him to do it, to just ask with his hands for Dean’s touch.
“Then let’s take the picture,” the guy said.
it said in perfect calligraphy.
Dean cleared his throat.
“More out in the forest than you’d think,” Dean said. “What… can I smell?”
There was something in his eyes - there was a softness around his mouth, there was an intensity to him that was unmistakable. He looked smitten. Utterly smitten. The clip of his face lasted barely a couple of seconds, and then it was gone.
“No, I missed that,” Dean said sarcastically.
“That’s not true,” Sam said.
Maybe the person, Castiel, hadn’t been real. But the way Dean had - the things that Dean had been feeling -
Jo put her head on
Dean strummed a few different chords.
the relationship better than she did. With a smile, she picked up the hotel phone.
“Right. Yeah. Of course.”
And then he turned, and was gone.
“Uh…” He watched Cas warily, while trying to keep his tone light. “You tell me, Cas.”
The conversations in the room fell into clustered mutterings, and then sighs of appreciation, as Dean stepped out of a side-room and into the main room of the cathedral. Behind him walked his brother. The two of them made a steady, solemn progress to stand front and centre. How obvious was it to everyone else in the room that Dean was in distress, Castiel wondered. How keenly did they feel the need to stand up and shout that it should stop, it should all just stop?
Dean seemed to want to say something, and then closed his mouth. He tried again, and said,
Castiel took his straw out of Dean’s milkshake, and stuck it back into his own, and took another sip.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel said. This had happened enough times that he didn’t usually feel embarrassed, but there was something about being caught mid-fantasy that had his cheeks heating up. He moved to the foot of the bed and sat there, trying to act like he normally would as Dean stretched and blinked.
Castiel guessed, recognising his own handwriting.
“You know what, it’s okay. You don’t have to say anything,” Dean interrupted. “I get it if you don’t want to. Seriously, I get it. It’s okay.” He heard his own tone of voice, weighted heavily in wry self-loathing. “I can just leave you alone. Like you said, uh. Professional. We’ll just keep it professional.” He was halfway out of his chair, when Castiel said,
He heard Charlie draw in a breath.
Castiel shuddered.
” Claire demanded.
“Like… I don’t know. There’s something about, uh. I don’t know, man... like… he means a lot to me, I guess.” Pretty poor way to try to explain it, but the more Dean felt about Cas, the less he felt able to put it into words. It was trying to explain the sun with a flashlight.
Cas was looking at him as though he’d heard them anyway. His face shifted, sharpening in a way that looked sort of pleased. The intensity between them, always taut enough to feel, stretched harder. Dean found himself not looking away and also not saying anything, letting the silence draw out. His eyes dropped to Cas’ mouth, and then he realised what he’d done a half-moment afterwards and looked back up, but Cas had seen. Dean could tell by the way his lips twitched slightly to one side. And now he was looking at those lips again, and there was static across his shoulders, pleasant pain, a good burn. If he walked across the kitchen now, if he just - if he put out a hand to ask for Cas’, or if he just leaned back against the counter and beckoned Cas over, would Cas come to him? Would he push up close in Dean’s space, press him back hard, put his hands on Dean’s back, on his arms, on his neck - would those lips of his find Dean’s with the urgency that Dean wanted from him? He could so nearly feel the friction of their bodies together, feel the warmth of Cas’ kiss, feel the stubble along Cas’ jaw and smell him and breathe him in, in, in -
his back, Castiel pressing warm against his front. No
– that might stop you from getting married in two days’ time, you are going to take steps to remove those obstacles.”
Castiel’s eyes searched Dean’s face. Dean felt himself starting to go red, and was glad of the dim lighting; after a moment, Castiel smiled slightly, and squeezed Dean’s hand. They went back to watching the movie, Dean’s pulse soaring. He didn’t know, but it really felt as though he might get to kiss Castiel before the night was over, and just the idea of it was sending his body into some kind of overdrive. Cate Blanchett’s terrible wig couldn’t even take his mind off the image of Castiel leaning in and kissing him.
“I don’t know, Dean. He’s always seemed pretty chilled out.”
slightly too self-consciously, as though he didn't do it much but wanted to, and that was weirdly charming.
“Fine. If you say so,” Castiel snapped.
The Angel sighed.
“Cas?” Castiel repeated doubtfully.
Dean shook his head, trying not to laugh with her, and failing. Once they’d started, it was hard to stop; Dean covered his mouth with his hand, trying to press the smile back and be serious, but Charlie was outright giggling beside him.
“Seriously?”
Dean was an absolute idiot. He was beyond and out the other side of stupid.
“Well, when you put it like that…” Castiel took a sip of his too-hot coffee. It was nice and bitter.
“That’s good to hear,” Gordon said. “How’s Dean?”
“You still…?” Dean says.
“I would never do that,” Castiel said. “You were the one who stopped talking to me.”
As he walked back through to the kitchen, he took out his phone. He couldn’t make this house stop being creepy, but maybe if he put on some music and sorted out a delicious cheesy feast for himself, he could at least make the creepiness feel secondary to the cosiness. Banish the fog inside his head.
“No, just…” Dean got ahold of himself. “The chilis are part of this thing… it’s like a rating thing. The students rate us on how hot we all are. And you’ve got the highest rating in the school.”
Castiel began to walk. The Underlight looked beautiful, today. Somehow just the hiss of the leaking pipes and the tawdry glow of the sol-panels was filling him with a kind of awe.
Dean met his eyes.
“I’m good. I’m good.” Dean struggled to hold onto himself. He’d thought this was over, after watching the video and not feeling too bad about what it contained. But hearing Sam talk about it reminded him that it wasn’t just people like himself, and Charlie, and Mr Fizzles who were watching it. Straight guys like Sam were watching it, and judging it, and rolling their eyes. “Just, you know. Like I said, I’m kinda worried I’ll screw it up.”
