Both men just stood and stared at it stupidly for a couple of seconds, the reality of the situation dawning on them.
“Can I stay up with you? Please? I can age up if you want-“
The genius flared his nostrils for another second, but deflated quickly, seeing reason. He looked like he didn’t want to leave at all.
“It’s going to be alright. I’m right here. We’ll figure it out, whatever happens.”
“Love you, too.”
But he was a genius, after all. (A genius who was going
“I wasn’t thinking that!” Greg lied, immensely relived.
“I ‘despise’ the lack of trying. You, on the other hand, just set the parameters yourself. I’m merely using the terminology
The choice of words had been deliberate, inching slowly but surely towards this thing between them that had been there ever since John had had his accident. The waiting game was over. Trial and error.
When both of their movements were becoming more sluggish and their gaming less enthusiastic, Greg figured they could use a little break. He nudged his foot against John’s, making the little doctor look up from the Ludo board he was just putting back into its box.
. But this was borderline masochistic.
Sherlock looked over at John’s profile (his eyes were closed, but his whole body was twitching restlessly) and postponed the discussion of their scheduled ‘little time’ when John was less agitated and less likely to deny he craved little time at all.
Their relationship was still so
Had Sherlock loved him in the first place?
The next couple of days were draining. As expected, John had been horribly embarrassed the morning after he had his little accident, so much so that he avoided speaking to Sherlock altogether for two whole days.
“Can you do it?” His voice was almost tiny and John absently wondered if he perhaps slipped a bit younger than usual, but decided not to think about that anymore (it would only serve to fuel his insecurities about being perceived as a baby).
“Sherlock-“
, Sherlock looked forward to spending the rest of the night with John. Falling asleep next to John was a thing he quickly fell in love with; and falling asleep with little John brought a serenity over him that he had hardly ever experienced. There weren’t many moments in his line of work- hell, in his
It were facts of the last nature that were baffling him, as they unfolded right before his very eyes. You see, John Watson was by no means an easy person. The war had taken its toll on his mental stability and self-esteem, the hunger for danger and action posed a contradiction within the otherwise gentle doctor, his self-image revolved around expectations he believed other people had in him. Most of all, he was eager to please, eager to be recognized by a figure of control, making him excellent in following orders; but he didn’t trust others enough with himself, taking the control right back. Additionally, John was caring by nature; not used to showing vulnerability of any kind; but he was also sensitive and sweet and tempter-driven; a peculiar combination altogether. One would best describe John Watson as complicated, for lack of a better word.
“Cheers, mate. That’d be lovely.”
that, he had told him mere minutes ago. Still. It was everything he could say without fearing to start sobbing again, this time out of humiliation. And all this crying was wearing him out.
“To keep in the bathtub, I presume?”
It was foreign for him to talk John into food, but he was itching to turn this evening around to something more positive, like cuddles, and sex, and sleeping in the same bed.
Sherlock knew that it was not easy for John to admit that he might desire something so distinctive child-like; something he couldn’t brush off in his mind as an enjoyment a lot of people shared, like he could with his desire for cuddles or reading or coloring books. Even the term ‘Daddy’ could be justified away somehow. But not this. This was something
John rubbed his cheek against it (an action, Sherlock came to associate with his partner trying to self-soothe) and locked his arms around Sherlock’s waist, fingers aimlessly twisting and crumbling Sherlock’s shirt, the back of his hand gracing the inner lining of the beloved Belfast. John’s movements had a desperate edge to them that made Sherlock feel inexplicitly bad, even though he couldn’t pin-point why.
, and he had rolled up his sleeves and he was kneeling by the tub, and it made John feel pleasantly
He stared at Sherlock’s head intently, his partner- as per usual- several steps ahead of him on the unsteady path they were trotting along. A chilly breeze caught the doctor off guard and his injured leg gave a pitiful throb.
. His.
“Sherlock, you really shouldn’t stay,” he gritted out between his teeth. The sheer thought of speaking the words aloud, of addressing the fact that he had not only
Suddenly, Greg was overcome by a deep sense of pride, that warmed him inside out. This new thing was another testament for how far of a way Sherlock had come; of how much he grew as a person in the last couple of years. This was good, not only for John, but for Sherlock as well.  After being closed off emotionally for so long (Greg had watched them skirt around each other. It had been antagonizing to watch), allowing this intimate connection was a huge step towards a well-needed
. This age-play thing surely worked wonders on him, the crinkled worry lines all over his face had smoothed out when he was smiling (for a while, Greg had been worried that John might never manage to be really happy again, with the way the weight of everything that had happened the past years pulled him down). A warm wave of pride washed over the DI as he watched John twirl a strand of grey-blonde hair around his index-finger while recounting the story of the lion king with impeccable accuracy. They’ve all been in some really dark places, for so long. But they managed to get through and come out stronger in the end. Some light in their lives had been way overdue.
The detective cradled his head securely and shushed him, gently: “Now, now; I’m here, everything’s fine. You’re alright; calm down, love, there’s a good lad…”
Only that home shouldn’t feel like this. Sherlock wanted to offer John the home he needed so badly after all these horrible months; wanted to create the safe-space that the doctor graved so much that it was so blatantly obvious, not even Anderson would be able to miss it.
Unaware of the title. A slip of the tongue, due to tiredness, perhaps? But these required a specific reason; and his name was not even close to ‘Daddy’ phonetically, nor were there any external stimuli causing the address. Thus, it was much more probable that the word had been existing in association with him in John’s mind, and he was disclosing it due to a lowered verbal inhibition. While on the outside his mind was kicking into overdrive, Sherlock appeared nonchalant. He registered vaguely that John sighed and did lean over to give him a peck on the corner of his lips.
He licked his lips, trying to come up with a way to phrase his request so it wouldn’t sound so damn childish.
“I’m sorry,” John whispered again; urgently, anxious to get his point across, like Sherlock would be mad at him if he didn’t. What an obscure concept.  “I didn’t mean to. It just… happened. I would never mean to….”
John needed him to be in control, to take the lead (although normally the doctor was the driving force in their every-day-lives), to make sure everything would be alright.
“Stop, whatever you want to add to this-
The second to last item caught his attention.
He woke up with a desperate gasp for air and
“Sure you aren’t, champ. You’re my big buddy.”
And John- well John might have been in Liverpool as well, judging by the amount of help he was offering to get out of this situation. It had been Sherlock’s fault, admittedly. But Sherlock always could rely on John to get him out of trouble, to take on any new adventure with a fond sigh of exasperation and a clear head. John was a soldier. Would be a good timing to pull out some of those soldier survival skills to help them find their way out.
The crisis didn’t occur for the first few times that they settled into their new dynamic. Right after that evening of acknowledgement, John did make an appointment with his therapist. Sherlock regarded it as a small identity break-down but was pleasantly surprised when John returned from the visit in high spirits. Apparently, whatever had been discussed came a long way in easing the doctor’s most prominent anxieties about the matter.
if he wanted to. There was no need to slap a label onto it. A definition.
That's a wrap, folks!
The DI answered the door a minute later, looking disheveled in his checkered dressing gown and plush slippers. The image, despite the tense situation, made Sherlock’s lip twitch ever so slightly.
John needed
He was trying his earnest to will himself to hate Sherlock.
Shortly after the game started, the bedroom door creaked open, and a very disheveled looking John Watson (accompanied by teddy, wrapped in a blanket cocoon and bare feet) padded over to the couch.
“What I’m about to tell you… it’s not easy for John, you have to understand. And he- and
The endless days of suppressed needs had finally reared their ugly head at around three in the morning. John had fallen into a restless slumber, tormented by bad dreams. Sherlock wasn’t next to him, but that wasn’t a surprise. He had actually taken to sleeping in his own room again roughly four days prior, after not being able to take the disappointment in inhabiting their shared space on his own. It would be easier in his room, he told himself, because he had been alone in there for
The sudden powerful emotion puzzled him, because their firmly established dynamic worked differently. John was the caring one; he made sure Sherlock ate and slept and didn’t bleed out by accident. Sherlock often forgot the needs of himself and the people around him; he wasn’t attentive in the reassuring way that John was; he wasn’t the caring type. But his heart swelled as he stood there in the dark room and watched his friend fight with himself; clearly torn between throwing Sherlock out of the room and throwing himself into Sherlock’s arms.
him over to the sofa and they engaged in a heated make-out session, until Sherlock honest to God came, like the virgin he wasn’t but everyone assumed he was. John’s kisses were
John was hunched over and gripping his leg- which, Sherlock now realized- had been injured sometime during the case; and it was his bad leg, too. He must have been in pain for almost their entire detour through the forest, hence slowing John down considerably.
But he wasn’t- loving, helpful, caring John Watson wouldn’t let his partner sort through the mountains of paperwork by himself.
The deep gratitude and affection he felt for his friend at that moment of realization had nothing to do with being more emotional due to his little headspace. He could feel himself aging up yet another bit; that he was almost in the in-between state between big and little.
So, he waited.
He didn’t cry when he took off his wet boxer shorts and (now naked from the waist down) stripped his bedding and flipped the mattress (even though it hadn’t taken any damage). He didn’t cry when he carried the wet fabrics down to the washing room (still mostly naked, since Mrs. Hudson was at her sister’s for the week) or when he started up the washing machine. He didn’t cry when he passed Sherlock’s (…their) empty bedroom while he trotted to the bathroom. He didn’t cry when he turned the shower as hot as it would go and stood under the spray until his skin was burning and prickly. He didn’t cry when he sneaked into Sherlock’s (…their) bedroom, opened the drawer where they kept his little things and pulled out the packet of pull-ups (never used since the night over at Greg’s flat).
The comfort only Sherlock knew how to give, the comfort that came with this
Alright.
“Why don’t you get changed (here, John blushed, not missing the implication) and I’ll wait for you in the kitchen? You can bring your bear, if you like?”
“But…but if I…if I wear them-“ Here, the doctor’s voice cracked, now distinctively older, wavering in-between little and big. He was looking at anything but at Greg.
, had relied on the easiest explanation like an idiot. Yet all signs pointed to the unusual instead of the usual- all the signs he ignored in favor of stroking his own swollen ego.
“It’s nothing, I just didn’t pay attention,” the doctor mumbled, not really understanding why he tried to make Greg mother-hen less about him, when that was the premise of the whole babysitting-thing. “I’m being fucking stupid,” he concluded, not sure himself if he referred to the small injury or the change in his own behavior. Either way, it felt like suddenly there was this whole hole of self-consciousness again, swallowing him. He was an
, despite the fact that Daddy had said everything was fine?
The detective’s heart gave a powerful throb.
He sucked in a shuddering breath, his voice wavering somewhere between open vulnerability and crushing shame. Sherlock’s heart hammered wildly in his chest, in awe and relief and affection for the man in his arms.
Sherlock chuckled deeply, pleasantly, before the couch dipped and he lend against the backrest. “I remember this couch,” he said absentmindly- almost nostalgic- and smiled involuntarily.
Despite
How he wished Sherlock would see, now.
and I…I…”
The words tasted like bile in the doctor’s mouth, the whole extend of the humiliation catching up to him. Did Sherlock really think that he couldn’t control his body enough to…? He had had one accident, one tiny little accident and now Sherlock was fucking making fun of him for it; treating him like the baby that he wasn’t and that he
. There wasn’t any harm or any risks involved it was just… a pure emotional state.
“….lonely.”
“How ‘bout we have another round and then you’re crashing at my place for the night? I’ve free day tomorrow and I know for a fact that you do, too. Some space might do you and Sherlock good, cooling off your tempers.”
Still, he was different.
For the rest of this day (and, as far as Sherlock had a say in this, the whole of the following day), he would make up lost time and lather John in all the affection and attention he deserved and had been denied far too long.
And he already looked the part, Sherlock mused as he just stood in the doorway, leaning against the closed door, and observing how John’s hair was tousled from shuffling around on the bed; how he was clad in just his vest and boxer shorts, the blanket twisted around his legs; how he watched him.
A bit more stressed than usual, yes, and sleeping poorly the past nights, and falling back into the weird eating habits he had developed while Sherlock had been gone- but he was
The hold around him tightened. “I know, buddy. Why don’t we have a look if he texted while we’re eating?”
John felt the heavy timbre of the detective’s morning voice vibrate against his own chest. It was a pleasant sound; like a warm blanket or sweet honey. It wrapped itself around John and calmed every last trace of worry left in John’s heart. All that was there was fondness now and trust.
“Sure, one big hug, coming right up.”
“You like animals?” Greg asked, trying to get his friend to loosen up and start talking. He had imagined John would be very shy at first- he had been the two other times he had seen him in headspace. In asking about a topic Greg knew John was animated about (if his enthusiasm at the zoo was anything to go by), he hoped in easing the tension surrounding them.
It was a very bad excuse. It was so bad that it made Greg smirk. “Really? Who you’re rooting for, then?”
When was the last time he had
The detective picked up a couple of flyers from their favorite take-out places, pretending to scan them to get his rising tempter under control. He hadn’t even taken his coat off and John was already giving him attitude. He flexed his fingers at his side and brushed the book that was safely tucked away in his coat pocket. Some of his anger cooled off instantly, as he remembered the reason why he bought it in the first place.
Greg’s reply pulled him out of his thoughts and before he knew it, he had Greg’s phone in his hand. His friend politely looked away, considering it was his phone and everything; but the bit of privacy made John feel a little bit better; it was embarrassing enough that he got so worked up over a movie.
“Can you call Sherlock, please?”
“Why don’t you feed yourself for fucking once?”
He didn’t want to wear pull-ups in front of Greg.
He held out the bear for John to see. John bit his lip as his gaze flickered from Sherlock’s face to the teddy’s button eyes and back to Sherlock.
“I’m the last person to disagree with Sherlock being a handful. God, that man is infuriating at his finest behavior and he drives me absolutely bonkers. But-“
John let go of Sherlock’s hands to wrap him in a warm embrace.
Somehow, he didn’t believe it was the last time he’d get to spent with his little buddy.
“Everything’s fine just… trust me, Greg.”
than in their usual interactions (He knew John trusted him again; they talked about everything and it had been painful and cleansing and Sherlock was so grateful for the second chance John was offering him; so grateful that John started to be himself again around him; so grateful for the soft whispers in the middle of the night; grateful for the way John loved him, with his body and his words and his actions. He was grateful for John.).
Greg’s gaze wandered over Sherlock’s face a few seconds longer, before he sighed and knocked on the door twice. Then, he made way, so Sherlock could push the door open.
So, Sherlock also knew that John should be in bed already.
The detective thought he was overreacting spectacularly and that’s saying a lot coming from a Holmes.
He couldn’t start now; starting head over heels was what had gotten them into this mess in the first place.
“What would you like to drink?” Daddy asked immediately as he sat down, giving him no time to be self-conscious about the way his bear was perched up on his lap.
But sacrificing the 120 minutes he still had left to catch some shut-eye for Sherlock to get to the fucking point was crossing a line. He was a patient man, he
He just wanted John’s little moments, as rare as they had been, to be completely at ease, free from all the worries constantly planted in his mind while he was big.
By the end of it, John was pretty agitated, sleeping more restlessly in their big shared bed all on his own, growing exhausted and weary.
“I could eat…,” John answered matter-of-factly, idly grinning to himself.
There was also no smile.
“Ella’s right.”
Instead, he said: “Let’s get us home.”
they are; I want to know how the hell you got the idea to go out and buy …”
But Sherlock didn’t know that, because Sherlock hadn’t even looked at John closely enough today to deduce anything (there was be a hell lot to deduce) about John’s state; which hurt the pride of his partner enough to be stubborn about it and not tell him he was injured (or minutes away from a very humiliating breakdown).
It would serve to confirm things, once and for all. But- then again- what if he was wrong? Would they be able to… overcome this? Or would their relationship… break?
But he didn’t.
Nevertheless, John couldn’t sleep.
weird-“
The detective’s gaze rested on the offending item in question. He then pursed his lips, sighing a little. He opened his mouth, but John beat him right to it.
Overcome by the need to be closer, he cuddled up to Sherlock’s lean body; feeling the expanse of muscle and soft skin against his own skin. Daddy knew that he was little right now, because Daddy knew everything, always. And he’d be considerate and would never push something upon John that he wasn’t ready for. John still felt bad for last evening, but managed to swallow it down, in favor of enjoying the moment.
the bed), wrapped in Sherlock’s blue dressing gown, which he had found flung carelessly over the nightstand, and buried his face against the soft teddy bear, which Sherlock had bought for little him; the bear he had never gotten around to name, which somehow made the situation
“Are we… good?”
“Fuck you, Sherlock,” John hissed between his teeth, unable to stay another second in this situation. He felt betrayed and misunderstood- Being little was his comfort thing, everybody kept telling him that it was alright that it was his comfort thing and now… now it was turning into something… and Sherlock was just…
John didn’t know and couldn’t tell, and everything hurt- especially breathing, the cold air piercing his lungs like tiny ice-needles. He wanted to be
Suddenly, Sherlock stopped. Everything stopped. Finally-
Greg laughed good-naturally, and patted Sherlock on the shoulder, reassuringly. He knew that talking about sentiment was dreaded by the younger man, and he soldiered through it masterfully.
How could he deny such a request?
“And if you’ll ever need a babysitter, I’ll be happy to stick around,” Greg grinned, but not wide enough to reduce his remark to a playful quip.
“Pull-up, please.”
“Let me help you.”
“If something happens,
“Do you want a big hug to make all the bad feelings go away?”
But Sherlock couldn’t- he physically
He captured John’s mouth in a kiss. A desperate and soft kiss; a kiss in which he poured all the feelings he couldn’t voice, all the thoughts and doubts and words to show John. It was pure chaos and bliss, and only after a second, his partner opened his mouth to let him in. When their tongues touched- very gently- and the familiar taste of John invaded Sherlock’s senses, he felt the noose around his neck loosen. It was messy in every sense of the word- John was still crying and clinging to him like a drowning man and the cold wind tousled their hair. It was harsh, and it was beautifully real.
felt like a jerk for snapping at Sherlock like that.
There was a slight hitch in his friend’s breathing and John realized belatedly that he had referred to Sherlock as “Daddy” instead of using his name like he had the whole time before. But it was true. It wasn’t Sherlock he wanted right now. It was Daddy. And he wanted to make sure that Daddy was alright, as irrational as his fear might appear.
“Morning, love bug.”
“And I can’t stop thinking about the….” Here, the struggle to even put that word in his mouth, was evident in John’s posture. “… the pull-ups.”
John considered a moment before nodding, the corners of his mouth turning downwards.
“As long as it helps you, you shouldn’t worry about it. Thank you for telling me, though. I appreciate your trust.”
This realization was probably the most startling out of them all. Although admittedly terrible, everything else wasn’t really new. But this-
, alright? Not only are you trying to make me do something I don’t want to- no!- you did plan on waiting to bring it up until I’m vulnerable enough to not refuse?”
It didn’t have to do with the case.
John was tossing and turning in bed; unable to make his mind shut up. He was feeling dreadful and it had nothing to do with the alcohol.
And he would be, too.
“’m getting old,” Greg told his toaster as he passed it. The toaster remained indifferent about the topic. Greg scolded at it, before chuckling at his own antics. Beer always made him silly.
It was a dark, moon-less night. The room smelled faintly of beer and freshly washed linen.
There was a brief pause at the other end of the line and Greg felt a little bad for being so harsh with Sherlock. He simply couldn’t help being so… well Sherlock-like; his mind worked differently, much faster, with a higher capacity, latching onto every little detail and presuming everyone around him would want to know all the details, too. He was used to it by now and he was well accustomed to just let Sherlock talk himself out, because it guaranteed to make him feel better and thus be a lot more civil for the rest of the day.
Sherlock gently took his partner’s face between his palms and forced the other to look at him. There was a storm brewing in those blue eyes; a battle between John’s headspaces.
. Age-play, Ella had called it. John didn’t really like the term, feeling like it added a sense of finality and seriousness to it. He preferred the blurry lines they were currently skirting around whenever they were…
“What else does it say?” John asked and then stopped himself, clearly embarrassed about his sudden outburst. Sherlock’s heart swelled with affection as he watched his partner lower his head to hide the flaming blush covering his cheeks. It wasn’t usual for John to be shy- then again, nothing in that moment was very usual for the both of them, but Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to care. Now that was John asking for something- in that special tone of voice- Sherlock wouldn’t dream of disobeying to John’s any wish. Especially if it was sweet and innocent like the silent question to be read to some more.
Instead of answering directly, Sherlock shuffled higher up on the couch, creating room between his legs for John to fit right in between.
Sherlock wondered if John had been embarrassed about sharing a bed before because of his accident (which they did not talk about, ever) but whatever the reading did to him, it was beneficial. At the very same night (fortunately, a night Sherlock decided to sleep), John came into his room a little after midnight, huddling into the covers, holding Sherlock in a warm embrace (one that was so tender and intimate, that Sherlock finally understood what the deal of this whole cuddling business was. With John’s strong arms around his waist and his belly a comforting weight against his back; with John’s breath in his neck and his heartbeat against his shoulder blades; Sherlock admitted to himself that he could get used to this, that he would sleep more often if that was what sleeping entailed). After waking up to a well-rested John Watson beaming at him first thing in the morning, Sherlock decided they would read (and cuddle!) every night if that was what it took to make John more happy than he had seen him in a very, very long time (and then, he would kiss John to hide his own smile, because a happy John was all he needed to be giddy all day).
“Can I have milk, please?” he asked quietly, hyperaware of the way his smaller voice must sound to someone only accustomed to his normal voice; which, although not very loud was always strong and sure.
The detective faltered a bit. Because, even though John was just lashing out to hurt him at this point, he really hit a sore spot.
“Yes, Daddy.”
Additionally, there was this thing about the reading. Sherlock didn’t even think about introducing it as a reoccurring ritual, he just happened (as he tried to feed his ravenous mind more information) to read quite a lot, about a lot of different things. And he liked reading in the evenings, considering the atmosphere was the most peaceful then; John was home from the surgery, the room still smelled faintly of dinner, the telly was providing comfortable background noise. Sherlock liked the coziness of it all, the ability to shut the world out and his mind up for some blissful minutes of comradice with his favorite person.
The little doctor bit his lip, thinking hard. Big John would want tea (should he ask for tea, so Greg wouldn’t be even more aware that John was a little different right now?), but little John wanted something softer, something sweeter.
Sherlock bolted into the living room, still riding on his post-case high.
long time.
The doctor buried his face in the soft pillow as he was hovering somewhere in-between headspaces, groaning; mad at himself and embarrassed and just generally miserable.
“You just made a bad choice, you’re not bad, you’re my perfect little boy and…”
“Sure,” Sherlock mumbled, before sighing, and focusing his attention to the wall. “Alright, so. It all started when…”
Naturally- because John Watson was a master at being unnecessarily hard on himself- he chided himself for these emotions; sternly assessing that he wasn’t dependent on age-play or anything, that he didn’t need it to feel alright. He hadn’t needed it in all those years before, he would do without it for a while longer just fine, thank you very much.
Even if he was at his lowest point, he had managed.
Silence, for two heartbeats. Then, nothing more than a whisper:
He stopped by at the bar to get his own beer (wondered briefly of getting something stronger and ultimately decided against it, since he didn’t have dinner but was too worked-up to eat anything now) and slid into the booth opposite of Greg.
Sherlock Holmes was proud to call himself John Watson’s companion. His flat mate. His work partner. His best friend. John didn’t just need
He deserved some comfort, god damn it. Life hadn’t been easy on them, and the night was especially hard; anyone would want some comfort after that.
“Sherlock-“ he started what must have been the tenth time in the past hour, only to be ignored by the man in question; who was all post-case adrenaline and billowing coat. The case had been a complete success, but the circumstances were less than ideal; leading them to a show-down somewhere at the arse end of nowhere in a forest. The culprit was caught, Sherlock got to be brilliant, hurray, everybody go home. Except that this particular case had Lestrade outsourced in bloody Liverpool and Sherlock had managed to insult all the present officers so severely, that nobody had offered them a ride home.
When John emerged several minutes later- now without a pull-up and wearing the same clothes he had the night before; the bear in his hand the only immediate give-away of his headspace- Greg was busy working on something at the stove and Sherlock sat at Greg’s tiny kitchen table; both nursing enormous cups of black coffee (which tasted just
They stayed like this for a very long time.
for what you call ‘bad’ behavior?”
In all honesty, he was relived by the turn of events, mainly because it meant John would finally be able to sleep. His partner looked more and more exhausted as the minutes ticked by.
that voice. It wrapped the tentative request in a blanket of comfort, which the doctor didn’t resist- partly because he didn’t really want to.
“I’m still not convinced everything’s fine. But I trust you, like you asked. Don’t make me regret this decision, Sherlock.”
He straightened and took some steps back, to create some room between them.
This case took two weeks to finish.
“The speech is scheduled for five pm,” Sherlock said for the forth time since Greg arrived, “I’ll call you before bed. I’ll text Greg once I’ve arrived in Cardiff.”
good-bye and then
Greg closed his arms around John, patting him on the back.
wasn’t them.
Sherlock thought after that he had figured it out, the reason why John had been behaving so peculiar.
However, none of them came.
Greg laughed a little at the expression on John’s face.
By the time Sherlock pulled the plug, John was so comfortable with himself that he allowed Sherlock to rub him dry with one of their ‘good’ towels (the big, soft ones). His Daddy tried to be polite and not look, but John knew that he was eyeing his bits and leg with concern. He wasn’t very good at hiding his frown.
It had been a nice fantasy.
And sometimes, sometimes he just wanted a hug or a cuddle, but that was a very inappropriate thing to ask for while being at a crime scene or in the middle of an interrogation.

things. To address the
He flipped through the different movie options to busy himself while John fought a quiet battle in his own head. Eventually, the little doctor stood- but instead of fleeing from the scene, he trotted obediently to the bathroom.  As soon as he was out of sight, Greg let out a massive breath. He already worried about bed-time when the issue would rise again, but more strongly perhaps. Sherlock had told him not to push the pull-ups if John really didn’t want to wear them, but he would definitely sleep better if he did, considering it was a new situation where John was feeling insecure about himself.
And he loved John (that was the best part).
“I guess that means yes, huh?”
John closed the laptop with more force than necessary and sprang out of his chair, like he was either readying himself to fight Sherlock or to bolt out of the living room. The detective wasn’t sure which he’d prefer at this point.
He arrived at the pub and opened the door- warmth and the earthy smell of ale welcoming him. He located Greg quickly, at a booth near the bar, nursing a pint and watching a soccer game on one of the TVs hanging from the ceiling.
John hadn’t even considered that.
“Not what I meant but noted.”
When he spoke again, his voice was lower, barely above a whisper: “Thanks, Greg. This means a lot.”
He buried his face against Greg’s flannel shirt, shielding his eyes for a moment, allowing himself to escape from the situation to gather himself again. Greg- praise his heart- just held him, patient and gentle and

“Does it look like I am?” Upon seeing the genuine expression of uncertainty on the younger man’s face, Greg softened. “Everything’s fine, Sherlock.

Predictably, John tensed, and Sherlock put his palm over the little doctor’s now thundering heart. He looked at Sherlock with big, round eyes that spoke volumes about his emotional state. He then shifted, as if unsure of himself, and Sherlock watched him cringe when the pull-up made a very quiet crinkling noise.
That never happened before. Sure, he had fallen asleep little now and again, but never woken up still in headspace. It must have something to do with the pull-up, of which he only became fully aware of when he concentrated on it. It was still dry (small victories) and soft against his crotch; not at all restricting like he imagined it would be. It was just… warm. And snug. It made him feel… protected. Somewhere behind the sleepy fog over his mind, he realized that he should probably worry about this development; at least it seemed like a reasonable thing to worry about.
. Filled with everything.
so desperately.
Lestrade was in Liverpool.
“If you’re trying to make me worry less, you’re doing a piss-poor job so far,” Greg laughed tensely, overplaying the uneasiness he felt when seeing Sherlock so carefully wording each phrase. The irrational part of his brain immediately came up with all sorts of horrible scenarios, that would have caused John to act so peculiar and Sherlock to be so…. Un-Sherlock-like.
“Good boy,” the DI praised quietly, remembering that John responded well to this kind of positive encouragement. He also noticed the bear his friend was now clutching, indicating that he perhaps felt littler than he had before. It was fine with Greg either way.
“Come here.”
Greg sat down on the couch behind his friend- near enough that John knew he was there, but with enough space between them to not crowd the shy little too much. If Greg knew anything about shy people, it was that giving them some time and space would work wonders in helping them warm up.
But it made him very very happy.
“I’m on my way.” Shuffling on the other side of the line. A bag being packed roughly; the phone squashed between shoulder and ear.
There were facts he knew about John; simple facts, like his birthday or his profession, advanced facts, like personal preferences about a various range of topics, and the complex facts, which lead to understanding John Watson as a person on a deeper and more profound level.
Sherlock drew small circles on John’s stomach- an action that John in every headspace experienced as extremely soothing- and spoke softly into the quietness of the room; a low timbre of warmth and affection, laced with fondness: “We could try it. Just for tonight.”
“Not how I imagined it would happen,” John almost chuckled, his voice still wet but distinguishably adult now. “Thought it would be a warmer atmosphere and I wouldn’t be snotty and gross; but I’ll take it.”
“I wet the bed, Daddy.”
Ella had forwarded him a useful website about age-play (that were nothing like the weird pages he had visited while he attempted to do some research), in which it stated that getting clean- like in a bath or a shower- could help to ease some anxiety and improve the bond between a caregiver and his little.
John Watson was having a bad week.
John’s eyes started to prickle.
Man, now Greg
John closed his eyes and exhaled slowly, obviously trying to find a way to turn this around, to get confirmation of the terrible things his insecurities and anxiety told him to believe. But not even they could compete with the sound logic Sherlock was offering.
John’s eyes met his. “You’ve done worse.” There was a small smile curling up the corners of John’s lips, but there was a lingering sense of accusation in the statement. All well-deserved, evidently.
“It’s really not,” John’s voice was muffled by the fabric of the detective’s shirt; it had lost some of its desperate panic but was still laced with shame and vulnerability.
“Do you think you could try, before we start the movie?” The DI prompted further, picking up the remote to make this situation seem totally casual. Which it totally wasn’t but… you know. Greg figured it was what a good babysitter would do. Acknowledging the awkwardness would only make John feel worse about himself than he already did in that moment (if his slightly shaking hands were anything to go by). Another slow moment went by and Greg mentally prepared himself for the scenario that John would bail for real this time, calling this whole thing off over a toilet break.
Watching John reach for a yellow crayon, Greg felt quite good about himself. He was fairly confident that giving John some space to engage in some activities himself was the right choice here, as his friend seemed to be too self-conscious to engage in much conversation at the moment.
Three days later, after a case (a 6 at best, but Sherlock had gotten itchy and desperate with the lack of mental stimulation), John crowded him against the living-room wall and kissed him (sweet, and then-upon realizing that his administrations weren’t met with resistance- more insistent, more dominating, until Sherlock’s knees buckled, upon which John had fucking
“We’ll be fine,” Greg jumped in, placing a warm hand on John’s uninjured shoulder. He could feel the tense muscles relax a fraction under his palm. “Have a safe journey!”
John sank against the soft leather seat like a dead weight. Sherlock picked up the faintest crinkle of the pull-up and made another decision.
They hadn’t played in ages. He wasn’t ready to let go of the freedom and peacefulness that came over him once he had settled comfortably into headspace.
“I’m not leaving. God, John. I should be the one apologizing and begging you to stay with me. I’ve been awful to you.”
He still had the bear in his arms, and without giving it a thought, he rubbed one honey-colored paw against his cheek. Half-way through the motion, he realized several things at once:
The footsteps behind him stopped.
Sherlock recognized his inner turmoil immediately and went to resolve it. He patted the empty seat next to himself and beckoned John over to sit with him. Relief filled John’s heart and made the worry in his stomach shrink. Daddy would know what to do. Daddy almost always knew what to do.
Ella wasn’t pleased with him at all. Ella told him that it was self-destructive to ignore his desires for so long and so severely, that it would lead to an increase of all his mental health problems.
Greg probably thought he was talking about sex. It couldn’t even be farther from the truth: Not only did John not have even the slightest problem with the physical component in their relationship (although
Sherlock’s expression turned into something soft and concerned, and he made an effort to calm the distressed doctor.
The detective rested his forehead against John’s, both of them now chilled to the bone, and restlessly caressed his long fingers over John’s cheeks, eyebrows, jaw; rubbing away the wetness that was gathering relentlessly.
Sherlock just continued walking and- alright, that was making him really, really feel like crap now.
Sherlock didn’t know he was capable of being so gentle, and caring, and
One more thing.
Sherlock exhaled the breath he had been holding. He could work with that. “Of course not, darling. I’ll be right there with you.”
When his portion was placed before him, John’s entire face lit up.
He sat up making his joints pop and rolling his shoulder. He couldn’t even remember the last time he had fallen asleep on the couch. His back was protesting, and Sherlock had the insane thought that he was getting old, despite being in his mid-thirties.
It was in his partner’s eyes, really.
- don’t want you to jump to conclusions before you’ve heard the whole story, please. It might sound… unusual, but bear with me, yes?”
Instead of ‘normal’ (boring!) plating, Greg had arranged the food to look like silly smiling face; even with banana-slice eyes and everything.
The detective felt John sucking in another sharp breath, the tender words obviously having a positive effect on him. He catalogued everything he could, filing it away in his mind-palace to the ever-growing wing dedicated solely to John’s well-being.
But he wouldn’t say that
“Don’t forget to use the toilet, buddy.”
But he didn’t.
What came as a surprise was the fact that when Greg touched John’s arm and told him it was time to get ready for bed, the little didn’t fight him (Greg had been pretty convinced he would meet quite a lot of resistance).
Ga'www those two dorks <3
One step at a time.
The DI stared at the phone in his hand.
? While Sherlock was in bed with him? He went to use the toilet again, just to be extra sure, but still. No. He would never forgive himself if that happened.
“What would you like to eat when we get home?”
His pants clung warm and heavy to his crotch, unpleasant and grounding. He wanted to get out of them, as fast as possible.
Instead, John was sitting in his chair, not looking at Sherlock and instead appeared to be busy on his laptop. Sherlock watched him, quickly taking in the most important facts. John was tense. Agitated, restless. He hadn’t been sleeping very well. He was rubbing the jumper at the place where Sherlock knew the exit wound scarred the skin.
The third surprise of the night came right after the question left his lips.
“Now, why don’t we settle down on the couch and you’ll tell me what we should order from Angelo’s, yes?” Sherlock felt a spark of victory when John relaxed completely in his arms, melting against him.
Sherlock had prompted him for this scenario, so Greg came prepared (he was more and more grateful that he had sacrificed his lunch break for a crash course in age-play 101, although he’d literary eat a vacuum cleaner before he would tell Sherlock).
He wasn’t.
“He cares about you a lot,” Sherlock agreed, licking his lips. Calculating how to phrase the next sentence. Despite Ella, nobody knew about their new intimacy, and in a way, it was nobody’s business. But Greg was… an essential part of both of their lives. If Greg would know, a lot of things would be so much… easier here on out. Sherlock longed for someone to talk to about his insecurities; it was sometimes difficult with John, for John would feel guilty of putting Sherlock in a situation where he could have insecurities in the first place. Additionally, Sherlock wasn’t comfortable with keeping such an important part of themselves from the DI. Greg was their closest friend.
The DI frowned at the weird request. What would John need Sherlock for, at this hour? Wasn’t the whole point to get away from Sherlock for a couple of hours?
“I figured it would ease some of your worries regarding… nightly accidents when you’re little.” (which John had, he couldn’t deny that, but he would rather bite off his tongue than giving Sherlock the satisfaction of being right) “I- I apologize, I didn’t plan on bringing them up until you’re a bit more comfortable with-“
“Why wouldn’t I?”
“Daddy?” he whispered, standing stock-still and unsure, obviously looking for guidance and validation during this completely new experience. Two reassurances, Sherlock was very happy to provide (although, granted, at this point he wasn’t sure anymore what the hell they were doing, but that didn’t matter).
. Greg had seen both of them at their lowest moments in their lives. Yet, he was still here. This was a safe space, here. He didn’t have to be afraid to be himself, here.
“There’s nothing to be sorry for. Accidents happen.”
At first, he didn’t even know what it was. He stopped, to read the label.
There was a significant pause; in which John fiddled with the blanket draped over his knees and Sherlock silently counted the seconds. He didn’t realize how invested he became into these new dynamics that only just barely surfaced between them. He might have gotten a little carried away with his deductions. Maybe he had miscalculated again. Maybe John didn’t want him to do that; maybe John needed comfort, but he wasn’t comfortable with Sherlock giving it to him. While Sherlock figured he would be a tad too devastated about this possibility (considering he only just acknowledged his caring side twenty minutes ago), John’s consent was vital.
He hesitated, but ultimately chose comfort over pride.
The final straw.
He didn’t have an accident and Daddy hugged him in his sleep- like people did when they loved each other- and breakfast was only minutes away; and all of this made John very, very happy.
This wasn’t the right time to have this conversation. They should have had this conversation days ago.
“No worries, buddy, I totally get it.” He ruffled his friend’s hair affectionately.
Sherlock stepped behind John’s chair and took the jacket off him (John let himself be manhandled), before kneeling in front of him to take off his shoes. John just looked at him blankly, his eyes half-lidden.
John hadn’t been alright since he moved back in. He hadn’t been alright at all.
Now he was determined to make this the best possible experience for all of them.
The past month, Sherlock had been on a roll. The cases had been extraordinary, thrilling and hard to solve; a combination that left him giddy and thrumming with energy. Every new one had been better than the last; exquisite stimulation for his ever-shifting mind.
Or, so he thought.
He was facing his insecurities and he didn’t even have a major break-down about it (only a little one). He had the feeling that Daddy would be proud tomorrow, if he told him. And Ella would be proud, too. Progress was a curious thing. Even the smallest steps felt like big leaps. It was nice to allow himself to feel good about the things he accomplished again. He hadn’t in a very long time. Before he and Sherlock started age-playing, John didn’t even notice how pessimistic and self-deprecating his attitude towards himself had become. But now, it seemed like everyday, he liked that guy looking back at him in the mirror a little bit more (he was an alright dude, after all). When he had rinsed out his mouth, he gave himself a little smile. The guy in the mirror smiled right back.
But what was concerning was the willing openness to neglect self-care in favor of being consumed by… what, exactly? Loneliness, perhaps. (John must feel lonely. Everybody would feel lonely after being treated like this by your partner for so long. Even Sherlock could understand this, and loneliness was otherwise a foreign concept to him.)
During the case?
you with this. And you…you just take it and… and humiliate me like…like…” He sucked in a sharp breath and blinked away the tears of frustration that were gathering his eyes.
But John was also wavering on the edge of being little. (Not an entirely surprising turn of events, all things considered.)
The John in question shuffled a little with his feet and still refused to look at Greg, but instead of making this even harder on both of them, pointed at the coffee table, which was scattered with some coloring books and crayons (of course. Sherlock would never leave anything to chance).
“It’s going to be okay, love.”
in John’s opinion, and his big side agreed wholeheartedly).
Sherlock focused his gaze on John’s shoelaces, biting back the grin tugging at the corners of his lips. As worrying it may be that John was fighting his headspace so persistently, it was blatantly obvious that John had aged down at least a little bit since they last talked to each other.
Scratch that.
Prepared to be met with some kind of resistance (since John was incredibly stubborn), the statement threw Sherlock completely off guard, in more ways than one. It was a curious feeling being surprised. He wasn’t very used to it, he usually could read people well, at least to some extent. This, however, this was new.
He knew that only one word from him would have been enough to call this whole thing off, but just the thought of calling to such desperate measures made guilt churn in his stomach. This- solving cases, solving mysteries- was what Sherlock loved, what Sherlock was
“Greg?”
He just couldn’t stop replaying the argument in his mind and he kept running around in circles over the fucking pull-ups.
“He’s so… and I’m just…I’m just me,” Sherlock continued, his face turning into a frown at the last word. “I don’t want to hurt him or to upset him, yet here we are; and it
about John’s whole demander radiated a certain vulnerability that was so foreign in his otherwise so dominant partner. He softened the scold that had formed on his face.
After an hour had passed, it looked like he may not have this, after all.
“Love? Greg was really worried when he called me. He thinks something’s wrong…”
He knocked lightly without even thinking about it. Although he was feeling hazy and just about ready to drop, he wouldn’t let a friend suffer if he could do anything to make it better.
An hour later, John was laying in the dark, staring up at the ceiling of their bedroom. He was warm and cozy underneath the blankets, with teddy next to him and the pillows still smelling like Sherlock. Still, sleep didn’t come to him. He had been so tired in front of the telly, but now he felt wide awake. He even had been tired not even twenty minutes ago, when Greg had finished up the story, he was telling him about the time he sneaked a puppy into his room way back in his police academy days. It was a fun story and Greg had told it really well, changing his voice and waving his hands around to emphasize certain points (somewhere in the back of his little headspace, big John made a reminder to tell his friend that his daughters could be happy to have such an awesome father).
Greg fought the urge to pull him in for a hug, unsure if his affections would be welcome right now. After all, it seemed like there was an absolute riot going on in John’s mind.
And then, the purest sound cut through the silence, and the wind, and the forest.
This on the other hand, was
“I’ll be here a while.”
Greg grinned to himself. He
“That’s part of the deal, love bug. I know that you know. You’re my clever doctor, after all.”
He knocked the grocery bag over completely by accident. He cursed quietly- the bear still tight in his grip- and scrambled to pick up the contents of the bag. He could hear Sherlock wrapping up the call in the other room and doubled his efforts, embarrassed by his unusual clumsiness.
“I’m terrified that I’ll… you know…”
The lack of protest, although expected, still felt devastating.
“You, what?”
. It was a delicate subject to breach now, and it definitely needed more discussion that they could have early in the morning in Gregory Lestrade’s guest room.
. “I’m not mad. You’re forgiven, everything’s forgiven.”
John washed his hands and willed the feeling of inadequacy as far down as he could. When Greg mentioned it, he had realized he really needed to go, bad enough that he might have lost control if he waited much longer. He tried not to feel defeated by this, but he really, really was. Ella had been nice about it (not even acknowledging that John wanted to
John giggled to himself and Greg melted into pile of mush. Little John, who was now fully in headspace, was just adorable.
“Then everything’s just fine, because that’s what they are for.”
“Since when do you know anything about relationships, Sherlock?! “
The second the cab came to a screeching halt, Sherlock was out the door, carelessly flinging way too many notes at the surprised driver.
The world narrowed down to this moment between them, all of Sherlock’s focus on John and him, on this bubble around them, on these feelings… these new, and intimate, and wonderful feelings. A wave of a strong emotion washed over the detective, and he buried his face in his partner’s hair, letting the familiar smell calm down his racing heart.
, he wanted to be
“We could get it at that one place that has this delicious peppermint ice-cream.” John’s favorite. Even when big and pretending to have responsible, healthy eating habits (because he was a doctor, ect. Ect.), John never resisted a hearty helping of peppermint ice-cream.
“Talk to me, is this alright? Am I overstepping a line here?”
want to have sex with him again (now the word made him blush furiously) if he saw him like that. This adult shame mixed with the childish shame about having had an accident, to create a humiliation-monster of gigantic proportions.
at this, I just-“
The little doctor turned in the embrace, flushing ever so slightly when the pull-up made a crinkling noise. It wasn’t the bad kind of embarrassment.
“You okay, buddy?” Greg carefully selected the nickname in the hopes of reassuring John that he was well aware of what he had gotten himself into and that whatever John wanted or needed from him would be just fine.
Maybe they weren’t ready, maybe they would never be. But Sherlock couldn’t stand another minute of watching the best damn thing in his life doubt the sincerity of their connection.
“I see you brought a friend, the more the merrier.”
“I love you.”
John shook his head, still restlessly shifting beside Sherlock.
All things considered, it was a silly affair to have a crisis over (it could have been so much worse).
The Work was important. But John was important, too. He could have spent the past couple of months working out a balance between the two but he hadn’t, because he had been arrogant about it.
Sherlock stared at him with a priceless expression on his face.
“Sure thing, buddy.”
“Then why does it hurt so much sometimes?”
When Lestrade called with the murder which had lead them to wander around like idiots in a forest, John was pretty fed-up.
worse.
“Buddy?”
Sherlock picked up after the first ring, as if he had been waiting with his phone in his hand (Knowing Sherlock, he most likely had).
His bladder throbbed, and John clambered his legs together, stubbornly telling his body to calm the fuck down. He knew that he didn’t need to
; this was exactly what scared him about age-play, that he would be pushed over his comfort zone forced to give up the control he wasn’t ready to give up and- oh my God, he was overwhelmed and really, really angry.
He had almost wet himself in front of his best mate.
“Don’t, what?” Sherlock prodded gently, so fucking
“I’m free, you can count me in,” he then added with a sense of finality, hoping that now the conversation was moving towards its organic end and he could sleep some more.
When he opened them again, John stood in the doorway to the guest bathroom, anxiously pulling at his shirt, as if to cover the pull-up that was now hidden from view underneath his boxer shorts.
John sighed happily and snuggled closer.
What, exactly? Pressuring him? No, that wasn’t it. Lying to him? Well… not really. John huffed in irritation about his inability to pin-point the exact thing Sherlock had
“John?” The detective prompted not unkindly, after his question was met with silence. He looked down and caught sight of the rosy color of John’s cheeks. Something about accidents (or god forbid, those pull-ups) then. It was the most likely thing to cause such a high amount of embarrassment, no matter if John was big, little, or in-between headspaces.
Disoriented and slightly panicked from being pulled from his slumber so violently, the DI blindly reached for his nightstand, knocking over a lamp and his reading glasses, before his fingers closed around the screaming device.
The reaction however, wasn’t the one he wanted to invoke.
“I promise, Sherlock,” Greg relented, hoping to mollify the antsy detective.
He settled for the next best thing: “Sherlock’s too much sometimes, y’know? Overwhelms me with-“ he waved his hands around in a nonchalant fashion- “stuff.”
“No, nobody’s dying of some horrendous disease,” he remarked, some of that old sneer creeping back into his voice.
. His mind was giving him different signals on how to go on in this situation and it confused him. Part of him wanted to let himself be doted and the other part was embarrassed by it- like Greg would think he was a whiney baby if he would let him take care of the burn (it didn’t even hurt anymore).
“You should get going,” John murmured softly, focusing his gaze onto the top button of Sherlock’s impeccable black designer shirt. A rosy blush colored his cheeks.
The doctor stopped walking, the pressure on his injury too much to bear; the pressure of the situation sitting on his shoulders and pulling him, down, down, down a dark hole of self-pity (he would need an extended session with Ella as soon as possible. It was frankly terrifying to him how easily he slipped back into self-destructive thought patterns and how hard he found it to fight himself back out of them).
All the rosy color (from the blushing) drained out of the doctor’s face.
“Sherlock’s…”
Gregory Lestrade woke up with a jolt as his phone went off at four in the morning.
After another minute, John left without a word.
The first thing John became aware of when he gradually woke up was the warmth that surrounded him. The blankets were soft- softer like the ones at home- and a familiar body had wrapped himself around his back protectively. Sherlock’s hands rested on his chest and hip, holding him in a soft, but defined grip. Calm breaths rushed over his neck in pleasant waves. Small bubbles of happiness whirled around in his stomach; waking up with Daddy was the best.
What if their relationship had always designed to end like this: Just a fling, just a game until Sherlock caught the next thrill of adventure, of mystery; a romance with a termination date?
“I shouldn’t feel unsure of having my bladder under control!”
It was a cold night and the doctor buried his hands deeper into his coat pockets as he left the semi-secluded space of the tube station, scolding at Sherlock and the world in general. He had left his phone at the flat on purpose, so Sherlock wouldn’t be able to contact him even if he tried- which, alright, was a little bit childish, but John allowed himself some childishness in this peculiar situation.
The DI leaned back against the soft leather cushion, now in full analysis-mode (despite everything Sherlock had to say about that matter, Greg was a good detective). John felt Greg’s warm eyes on him and blushed involuntarily.
“A little after six. We spent all night crammed up together on the couch. Well, me on top of you, more accurately.”
. Who was he, to deny him the thing that came to his partner so naturally?
“Yeah, of course I am. Don’t worry.”
“It’s a little weekend. John and I thought it might be a good opportunity to try out the babysitting, if you’re still up for it.”
Their tub was big enough and Sherlock actually had purchased a bottle of bubble bath in a heat of the moment decision a few months ago.
But it was fine, the doctor told himself, there was still plenty of time afterwards.
Sherlock hadn’t brought sandwiches, instead he brought a lecture.
When he went to move, Sherlock grabbed him by the wrist.
Something was off.
It was disgusting and weak and
Sherlock smiled at him- the real smile that was like the sun on a cloudy day- and patted their joined hands with his free one.
He would never pressure John- his wonderful, strong, precious John- to do something he didn’t want to do (well, maybe he had done it and would continue to do it, occasionally. Only when strictly necessary, of course. For science, or a case. Or just to take the piss, from time to time. But never when John was feeling little. Never when John trusted him with all of his heart).
Sherlock stopped, too.
Sherlock had spent the last two days mostly at Scotland Yard, while John had been working and at home. When he returned late at night, John was already asleep (he presumed, the door to his bedroom had been closed, he didn’t wish to disturb his boyfriend’s slumber) and, in the mornings, Sherlock was out of the door as soon as the sun came up. Consequently, they hadn’t really seen each other in the last 60-65 hours.
Sherlock sat the cup down and took his hand.
The impact of the words was written all over John’s face, which opened for a split second, long enough for Greg to see the unmistakable sparkle in his eyes.
John didn’t last very long; the intense eye-contact and the gentleness which he had lacked for so long proven too much for his exhausted body. The tears he had tried to stop just kept coming, with even more force now.
The detective didn’t miss the disappointment that creeped into his partner’s face for a split second, before he put on a blank expression.
Mister Genius himself preferred to communicate via text messages, too impatient to wait for the verbal responses of his conversation partners. A call from Sherlock usually meant something was off or going awry; like being trapped by a serial killer or almost drowning in the Thames (that had been one of Sherlock’s most remarkable stunts, it deserved a ten on the ‘Deadly stupid, yet infuriatingly brilliant’ scale Greg always kept handy in his day-to-day interactions with the consulting detective).
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
It didn’t take long for the cases to keep coming again, though.
When he was done, Sherlock appeared visually drained, but relived as well.
“Like what, love?” John was shuddering at the nickname, since Sherlock didn’t usually use nicknames.
“Breakfast, Daddy!”
“Come here.”
John shrugged, still looking at his tea. “I don’t know. Maybe it was just something you said to get me to calm down…”
The words were nothing but a breath.
The rest of the sentence was muffled by Sherlock’s shoulder, as he had pulled his partner into another tight hug.
, why would he, it was an essential part of their age-play by now. He didn’t need pull-ups, strictly speaking. He had the accident thing under control when he was little, at least most of the time. It wasn’t like he did it on purpose or anything… it wasn’t like he didn’t realize it when he had to
The sound of his partner’s voice- even a little bit fainter, a little bit far away- uncoiled something inside of John’s chest. He exhaled slowly and allowed the warmth to wash over him. Sherlock’s voice sounded like coming home after a long day, like the smell of wood in the fireplace, like a dollop of honey in warm tea.
Realization came like a slap in the face.
Perhaps, Sherlock thought to himself, while ringing the doorbell to Lestrade’s flat with unforgiving force, he didn’t think this through as thoroughly as he should have (the downside of thinking with your heart, instead with your brain, apparently).
“I presume I’ll see you in the morning?”
As the DI passed the guest room on the way back to his bedroom, he heard shuffling on the other side of the door and low noises that sounded a tad too distressed for his liking.
When John spoke again, his voice was undoubtedly quivering: “And I… I had an accident when…when the guy punched me, I…I didn’t know I had to go and then I
“Very.”
Sherlock had always had troubles with regulation- it was a strange concept to him. He used to live for the moment of being consumed.
Something about John.
John was a sensitive human being in ways that Sherlock only gradually came to understand.
that he was excellent).
Sherlock watched with growing admiration, how John first patted the bear’s head hesitantly and after some seconds taking hold of the whole thing, drawing it close, rubbing his cheek against the soft fur.
rubber ducks? Awesome!
It was maybe two in the morning, when Gregory Lestrade shuffled through his dark flat to get a glass of water.
Like a switch had been flipped, John’s head shot up to look at the detective with a shocked expression (mixed with a good amount of shame), while he drew his knees up close to his body, to block Sherlock’s view on his mid-section (hiding something) and opened his mouth to
“Shhh. You couldn’t help it. And you had your pull-up, so it wasn’t that bad. That’s what they’re for, love bug. To offer some protection when you’re feeling unsure.”
“Can we put chocolate chips in the pancakes?” John asked, while rubbing some astray batter on his cheek. Greg looked up briefly from his task to cut some fruits as a healthy side-dish to give John a raised eyebrow.
Really.
A piercing headache shot through his skull as he gathered his jacket, willed his hands to stop shaking and left, without sparing another glare at his partner.
His mind was fogging over with a feeling that also had nothing to do with being slightly drunk. He told himself sternly that he shouldn’t feel this way, because he didn’t need to be little. That he wasn’t craving to be little right now; that he didn’t need Sherlock to forgive him and to wrap him in a warm hug and-
Conclusion: John was wearing a pull-up, right in this moment.
Sherlock had gotten royally pissed when John had pointed out to him that they seemed to be lost, and Sherlock proceeded to ignore him and walked even faster.
about nutrition. He thinks tea counts as a salad.”
involved food. It became one of the trusty pillars of their friendship, as silly as it sounded. John liked things he could rely on, thing that were always a certain way. It gave him a sense of security in his fast-paced, unpredictable life. And right now. Because despite age-playing for months now, John still had his insecurities around it and they were tenfold when it came to spending time alone with Greg while being little. He had been anxious about it the whole night and the whole morning, although he tried to hide it from Sherlock (as if that was possible), who himself had been a ball of nerves the whole week (John would have found it adorable, if Sherlock wasn’t down-right infuriating when he was nervous). Greg being like he always was and still different helped him a whole lot to get comfortable with this new situation. A tugging in his belly reminded him that he should be insecure or embarrassed about sharing this childish, vulnerable part with anyone who wasn’t Sherlock (or Ella). Trusting people… always had been a struggle. But… it was Greg. And he put real effort into this, which touched John in an unexpected profound matter. He could put some real effort into this, too, John decided. Ignore that stupid voice in the back of his head saying mean, derogatory things.
No need to waste water …
“Never seen
Sherlock was pretty sure that John wanted
His partner’s sharp tone felt more like a kick in the gut- violent and sudden, and extremely painful (John knew he was overreacting. John knew that Sherlock was just riding out his high, testing his boundaries like he liked to do after a period of time when his mind had been titillated constantly. John knew Sherlock didn’t mean any harm, was frustrated by him at best. He knew. But that didn’t change a thing.)
Sherlock sat on the freshly-made bed (made with Sherlock’s linen, John noticed), casually against the headboard, tablet in hand.
He believed he already knew the answer (he was Sherlock Holmes, after all), but didn’t trust his intuition as much as he normally would. Previous miscalculation made him pretty insecure about his role. He wasn’t yet sure how to overcome the inadequacy that he felt like a heavy weight on his shoulders.
Sherlock clicked his tongue. “I see.”
John tore his eyes away from the picture of the little lion running up to his dad and- yep, there was this glazed over shine in them with which Greg was all too familiar with from the dark months where Sherlock had been gone.
Greg did the only thing that could be done in such a moment; he sat down again, close enough that Sherlock would be able to reach out for a comforting touch, if he needed it.
“I like your shirt. Elephants are cool.”
By just one word.
He didn’t mean to snap at him like that. He was just frustrated and angry at himself, that his brilliant solve was ending on such a sour note. But he knew John would understand. John always understood him (and he had missed him, in those moments where his mind had a minute of rest, it always wandered to his partner; looking forward to… to now, when they had some time to themselves. Which they could make the most of. But didn’t. Because there was a tension between them that Sherlock only just now realized; he had been too focused on the cases before).
“What a coincidence, I’m busy right now!”
Even after pissing himself.
John’s face heated up even more. The thing wasn’t that he didn’t... you know,
Sherlock’s heart jumped, before it sank right into his stomach.
“Daddy-“ John started again, but caught himself off with a noise that lay somewhere between a sigh and a dry sob.
They had been doing alright with the regular thing; mostly it just happened unscheduled when they were both up to it.
He was teaching himself to appreciate his little side even when he was big, so he grabbed the teddy, to take a closer look.
Sherlock decided that he could worry about the definitions some other time.
They had been avoiding it for way too long.
The tossing and turning in the upstairs bedroom became impossible to ignore. Sherlock Holmes was not a person to use such exaggerations lightly, however, in this case, it was very fitting. He literarily could
“I should just be big,” he pressed out between gritted teeth, although he actually didn’t really want that and even the suggestion made him kind of sad. Still. He was being a baby and he couldn’t let Greg see him be a baby. He should be able to heat his own fucking milk. And go a fucking day without missing Sherlock.
“You tell me. Are we?”
Why was Sherlock being so mean?!
Greg sighed and let himself fall back on the bed. It was way too early to deal with Sherlock’s… well, Sherlock-ness. The rush of excitement left him and instead he was hyperaware of how tired he still was.
When Mary announced her pregnancy (it felt like decades ago), John hadn’t been as happy as he was supposed to be. The prospect of being a father had terrified him; overwhelmed him. He hadn’t been ready. He would never be ready; he couldn’t be a father. Not when he, a man pushing forty, was clinging to a stuffed animal and relied on a younger, much more capable man to
Something that was needed shouldn’t hurt so bad. Something that was providing happiness shouldn’t be an issue of anxiety. Being little shouldn’t feel like a failure. Yet, Sherlock just knew that these thoughts were dominating his partner’s mind. While he had been busy running after criminals, John’s self-doubts had run havoc. Maybe- maybe if Sherlock had stopped- just once
John bit his lower lip. He didn’t want to think these thoughts right now. They were thoughts for big John.
And those bubbles looked kind of fun, John’s little side provided helpfully. He was still struggling to let himself slip; after all the built-up anxiety it was annoyingly difficult to let go.
