A heraldry mark that had been too burnt to read soon became apparent on top layer; two snakes entwined around a castle. It was not a mark Holmes was familiar with.
"I could procure you a wheelchair.”
“However,” he continued, “This is Father Deighton’s church, and the decision is his alone. He’s another hour at Mass, and then you can explain your actions to him, and pray for his forgiveness.”
Short chapter but hopefully worthwhile as we finally get a glimpse into Watson's head.
"I've sent communications out but haven't heard anything back yet aside from the cursory "thank you for your work in this case" nonsense that means nothing at all."
Generally, at the conclusion of a successful case he experienced a feeling of elation; a heady mixture of adrenaline and triumph. There was nothing quite like it; no chemical substitute could compare (and he'd certainly looked). He lived for the feeling, those brief moments of exaltation.
"Indeed, though it may run further than even sadism. I do not know. There is much about this business that has me curious."
his hands, matches in his pocket-!" She got no further, swooning as her body succumbed to emotional strain, overcome.
“Pah,” Holmes retorted, acerbic curl in his voice, “this is
“It is rather a lot of pain.”
Holmes rasped out a thin and mirthless laugh. "You are certainly persistent in your delusions."
Holmes was quiet a very long time, and Watson stood unmoving beside him, listening to the fire crackle and burn. Finally after several false starts he said softly, "I should like a promise."
Holmes lips pressed together, face taking on a sharp quality. “This would have been very helpful to have known two weeks ago," he replied and Watson spread his hands in a helpless gesture.
"I can make him dream of fire," Watson had said, and Holmes had allowed it because he saw the prudence in such a maneuver, and he was every inch the bastard he felt like.
“Kramer was murdered by James Montressor,” he said shortly. “We are all in agreement in this; there is no need to pursue it as a line of questioning.”
"Of course," Holmes replied smoothly, obsequious lilt to his voice. "But did you at that time have any reason to fear for his well-being?"
He owed Stamford that much at least.
Watson sighed sadly. "I did so enjoy London...I was born here, did you know? It was- it was very different then. Smaller. Less sanitary too, if you can believe it. I wandered for so many years after I was turned...but my heart always desired to return-"
you blithering idiot!” Of all the ludicrous, preposterous...the man was mad! Utterly insane, and that same voice in the back of his head reminded him that he’d known that already. Why else would he have invited a vampire to stay with him at Baker Street?
She cracked the door open when he knocked, pale faced and red-eyed; a woman newly widowed, or as good as.
Despite the practice being a common one, thralls were rarely created without purpose,  the most common uses being either a ready supply of food, day time sentinels for guarding lairs, or easily replaceable cannon fodder in vampiric politics (which generally comprised a great deal of death, bloodshed, and making good on one’s threats). But whatever purpose a thrall was originally intended for, death was the inevitable outcome. Thralls that had outlived their usefulness were drained and cast aside and other, more suitable vessels found.
The knocking persisted. Politely at first, but with rising fervor.
"Are you here to set up an appointment?" he asked with the most flawless and insincere politeness.
“WIGGINS.”
“Sherlock, he’s gone,” Jake said as he held a sobbing Sherlock to his chest.
“My name is An,” She answered Sherlock tentatively.
John looked terrified. “What have you done to me?”
Alice whines and I hold out my arms to take her. When she is in my grasp, I hold her close. “You know I love you baby, Alice, but your daddies need some alone time, so that we can play grown-up games.” She gurgles, then smiles. I stroke her soft cheek, marveling at how perfect she is. I play with her until her body grows heavy and her eyes close. Her solid warmth makes me relax and before I know it my eyes flutter shut as well.
John shook his head in disgust as Sherlock laid at hand on his thigh. “John, it’s alright I’m sure that Laura didn’t know of the camp’s destruction.”
“You don’t remember? John, you…you died in my arms.” Sherlock whispered as he looked up into John’s searching eyes.
“What?” Mrs. Hudson asks in surprise as she checks my pupils for signs of drug use.
Sherlock leaned his head against John’s and whispered, “Yes, it was.” Then without another word he pushed John’s chair in the direction of evil.
I stop and look at him. “I’m not nervous.”
Anderson is back home again. He’s had the temporary bag removed and his infection is under control, but he is so thin. He lays back on the bed watching me while I hold Alice. You watch over him, taking his vitals and such. I stare while you bend over and imagine you going down on him.
John walked over to his stripped robe and plucked out the black card. He then shoved it in Sherlock’s hand. “Sherlock, after tonight’s events you are going to have to take this seriously. I almost lost total control, raped a woman and killed you.”
“Yes, John we will be going home?”
“Look, it’s no use our being seen together,” John said as he backed away from Sherlock. “My fiancée wouldn’t like it.”
Sherlock didn’t miss the underlying nuance of John’s tone so he leaned in closer, as his eyes bored into John’s. “John, if you think I don’t find you desirable, then you are sadly mistaken, for as we speak I find it difficult not to lose myself in…in…you. Well, I suppose it would be easier to show you, wouldn’t it?” Sherlock said as he gently tilted John’s face towards his letting his full lips linger on John’s cheek, then he inhaled  shakily, pressed his full lips against John’s, the kiss was gentle at first but increased in intensity when John’s mouth returned his passion. After a few moments Sherlock pulled away, wrestled out of his jacket, threw it to the ground and resumed his kiss with John. After a few moments of the most intense pleasure Sherlock had known he reluctantly pulled himself from John’s arms and stood up. “John,” he muttered hoarsely. “John, I’m in the middle of a case and I have an art show coming up, so I have to keep focused, but know this I want you to marry me and I want to spend the rest of our lives together. I’ve been waiting for you so long, so John marry me and come home to 221b Baker Street.”
Holmes hummed in agreement as he repacked his pipe. “Then what is our next move?”
“If it's not too much to ask... how long was drink your sin?"
. Never dying can get quite dull after a while."
Watson didn’t need to breathe, so the kiss was long and indulgently deep.
He left.
"And what kind of monster would I be if I demanded payment for saving a life?" Holmes asked, the words thrown over his shoulder like a handful of salt. "Adieu, Doctor."
It was the wrong thing to say. Watson was out of the chair in an instant, a snarl on his lips and already halfway across the room before Holmes' eyes could perceive it. He stopped himself with obvious difficulty, turning from Holmes to face the wall with his hands pressed to his head in distress. Whatever warmth had been in the room seeped away, leaving in it's wake that same deathless chill Holmes remembered from their first meeting...when his life had hung in the balance of Watson's uncertain temper. He took a step back, his muscles tensed in preparation to either fight or flee. He was not the sort of man to retreat but neither was he a fool; he had seen the murder lust of a ravenous vampire in the doctor's eyes before the man managed to wrangle his darker half under control.
"He was my colleague as well as yours," Jackson said, ignoring the dismissal. "He was how I knew of you. I lost a good friend that night."
"I know," he said with regret, kissing Watson's cold fingers, "I know, though I wish it were otherwise."
"So you left the congregation rather than make yourself an object of gossip and speculation," he finished.
“You’re asking some very dangerous questions,
But Holmes was not listening. For once in his life, he was not listening to his older brother.
"Its practical applications are limitless in regards to criminology,” Holmes agreed, “though at the moment, I can only manage it to work on cotton."
The worst part of it was that Holmes was right. Of course he was, the bastard. But it still didn’t sit well with him.
“For one who has spent a century passing as a mortal, I wonder what your objection is to taking a cab.”
"Good morning," Holmes replied, not taking his hand because he rarely did, "my name is Sherlock Holmes, and I am a detective." His face he was careful to keep out of the papers. His name however was well known in connection with the police. He watched for a reaction.
Watson laughed. "I can assure you of that. But my musings have a purpose: do you consider
Watson watched him thoughtfully for a moment, some inscrutable emotion passing through his eyes.
"There is a great deal of speculation in the papers surrounding your rescue from the church,” he pronounced in a staid tone. “Foolish of you to rush in, you ended up saving no one."
He infused the last three words with his Will and watched as the man’s face went slack, the Order gripping hold of his mind.
This was not a feeding: it was simply murder.
He left the shop and took up watch across the street, slouched up against a light post with a newspaper spread between his hands, the breath from the London crowd hanging in the air.
“Why did you not read his thoughts, and confirm it?” Mycroft pressed.
"Yes," Lestrade nodded, giving Holmes a sideways look. "It's the body. We can't figure out how on earth it got there. We haven't even managed to get it
"Organism I think is the most accurate term. It is not a disease; too much about your biology has changed. A disease that produced such profound differences in you would have killed you as well. Infection again is the wrong word. Infection destroys. Infection kills, or is killed. You however have neither rid yourself of affliction nor succumbed to it. You instead have achieved symbiosis with it; I would wager not everyone does."
“You think I am unaware? Depend upon it, Doctor, no one knows my brother’s mind better than myself, nor the difficulties it causes him.”
On the whole, Holmes concluded his situation to be somewhat improved.
is driving him.”
"You had already been identified," Holmes reminded him. "Newman would have sent word of you as soon as Montressor's suspicions came to light. Who knows how many agents have been prowling the city in search of you? Things were going to come to a head whether you'd killed Langley or not, regardless of where you deposited his corpse."
"I was ill," she answered simply. "I fell last summer and the sickness would not leave me, so James decided the best course would be to get it out of my blood. It does seem to have worked, I feel much recovered these days."
"You will spread yourself thin before the night is over."
“Sorry sir,” she said, and began helping Holmes into the chair. It was not easy but he managed it, face pale with the effort and sweat on his brow.
Watson didn’t quite know what to feel, though there was certainly something filling his chest like air, making it both tight and light at the same time. A feeling that perhaps this cursed life wasn’t so cursed after all, that perhaps he should be doing something more with it, more than trying to hide himself away and pantomiming a mortal life, because he did not know how to be a vampire.
Holmes let out a puff of grey smoke, watched as it dissipated into the air. "I would wager it is little different than that of the human you used to be.
did it have to come to this? How many more scruples would he compromise before this mess was untangled?
From somewhere above he heard the door to the garret room open, and then Watson materialized at his side like an apparition, feet so swift and silent on the stairs Holmes hadn't heard him descend.
"Good afternoon Mister Holmes," the vicar said smoothly. “Are you ready to confess your sins, and die with a clean soul?”
“We?” Watson repeated with a quick blink. “You think he knows I have allied myself with the Diogenes?”
He'd never heard anything so ridiculous. Not in a hundred years. “The bloody
"'The secrets we keep tell more than the truths we speak?'" Watson quoted with a smile, but good humor seemed lost on the detective tonight, his face shrouded in shadow and his countenance grim. Holmes was only half listening to him anyway, his attention focused elsewhere - on the case and the church and the problems before him.
Holmes didn’t feel bad at all, but there was no point in sharing such an observation with Mycroft.
Holmes called upon his talents as an actor and gave her a reassuring smile. "Stay here, wait for my word. Either someone is after your husband or your husband is after someone. Either way, I wish you to be safe." The fear in her face made him curse Watson anew.
“Sherrinford,” Sherlock whispered, “that’s one of the things John keeps babbling on about. How does he know about my sister?”
The Shaman nodded, “It is always easier to express feelings for a loved one when that person is absent. John knows what he faces and he has left a letter for you to give you strength. Now, rest you can read the letter when you wake up.”
John smiled and said, “Umm, well if you need to question me further, you know where to find me.”
“How come I don’t remember her?” he asked in a small voice.
“Ah, yes I know. “‘To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub. For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil.’ Now, let’s sleep, Sherlock, then let’s dream. Rub, your fingers along my face until I fall asleep?”
John nodded again, “Uh haw.”
“Your witness is correct; the man who strangled the victim was at least 2.5 meters tall. As you can see the man’s windpipe has been crushed. The bruising from the killer’s thumb prints are in and down, which would indicate that he was much taller than the victim.  Our victim was a baker judging from the faint dusting of flour on his hands, hence the fact that he was killed around 3am, which would correspond with the fact that most bakers start warming up their ovens at this time. The baker was also not the Golem’s target. There is no sign of a struggle and judging from the cigarette butts on the ground and the yellow stains of nicotine on his fingers, this man had come out to have a smoke and saw something he shouldn’t have. In another words he got in the way. What about the witness?”
But tonight he had a prize in his sights. A toff gent in a fine suit that had clearly taken a wrong turn and become lost, and who had about him the air of someone unused to the brutal realities of life. Someone who had never had to watch their back, or wonder where their next meal was coming from. Nock hated him on principle, and the only reason he hadn’t yet attacked was that animal instinct – honed by a violent life on the London streets and the only real intelligence he possessed – that inexplicably told him to be cautious.
recognize me?"
He closed his eyes against a sudden spear of pain like a trephine being drilled into his cranium. “He- killed the priests, yes. Though that may be the least of the punishments they deserved. As for my present state...you’ve Deighton and Newman themselves to thank for that.”
Holmes alighted outside the store and the narrow, dark stairs cut into the side of the building that would take him to Montressor's small, bay windowed flat above. The bell jangled sharply as he entered the shop and the pocky faced girl behind the till gave him a gap-toothed smile.
"Mister Holmes, sir," Clark greeted him, standing to attention the same way he would for a superior officer. Clark was always 'siring' him and standing to; Holmes found it endlessly amusing. He himself held with no such formalities.
"Holmes... I have to go, it's nearly morning," he said softly, giving the man a gentle shake.
“Yes?” she asked tersely.
But Holmes' mind had run down all those avenues long ago, though it seemed unsporting to point it out. Instead he said, "Duly noted. My next few missives will likely not be in person."
“Why? What do they care for human society?” he pressed, urgent undertone in the words, dissecting gaze resting full upon Watson and he tensed under the scrutiny.
exist, yet did. Far from being terrified, Holmes found himself examining the doctor’s existence with the keen interest of a scientist on the verge of some monumental discovery. Everything about John Watson was a mystery, a fascination that had forced him to rethink all he believed he once knew about the laws of science, nature and man.
“Indeed, despite the fact I was at their mercy and had no knowledge of the letters at all, Newman tried to burn them anyway. If there were information within them that could be used to discover both Moriarty’s identity and whereabouts – such as the crest – Newman would certainly have been under orders to destroy them. My coming even as close as I did to their discovery likely triggered whatever command he had been given in regards to their disposal, and he acted upon it. If we were meant to find them, they would not have been in the fireplace.”
Watson frowned, because Holmes
“Kramer, eh?” the inspector asked, glancing at the haberdasher's receipt Holmes had produced from his pocket like a hat trick. He gave the detective an unfriendly look, “You might have waited for a proper warrant,” he scolded. “You can’t just take things, you know.”
He looked extremely displeased to be there in person, opprobriate furrow to his brow as he gazed about in open disapproval.
Watson found himself obsessed with Holmes; he wanted to both linger in the detective’s presence and push him as far away as possible. The pain of memory wafted off Holmes like an unpleasant odor, "Stamford" echoing in his mind like a distant, chronic ache that both attracted Watson and repelled him. Holmes was a kindred spirit, a shattered mirror reflecting Watson’s own emptiness back at him and he seemed incapable of turning away, no matter how much it hurt...
"Yes,” Holmes agreed, understanding both the danger and the need for sleep. He still let their touch linger before releasing Watson to the dawn. And then the doctor was slipping out the window, and was gone.
"The police already came by a few days ago," the woman told him. "Not sure what you're expecting to find."
It made his job harder.
A stiff-backed constable sat stationed near the door, a copy of The Morning Chronicle in his hands, dated two days from the time of his capture. Well, if the world had gotten on without him for two days, it could manage awhile longer. He fell back asleep.
But when he arrived in the parlor he found a letter awaiting him, having been delivered by one of his Irregulars not a handful of minutes after he had left that morning. He opened it immediately and was greeted with Watson’s elegant, somewhat archaic scrawl:
likely but she didn't believe her own words. I don't know why she would lie, nor what has frightened her so but there is a reason her husband has her under such close scrutiny. We weren't alone five minutes before he came in search of her. I slipped away before he could spot me. I thought it for the best." He waited, hoping Holmes found his information useful, though he wasn't entirely sure why he felt the need to prove himself to a mortal, except that somehow Holmes had the power to make him feel like an ignorant child, and not a powerful, supernatural being of folklore. Watson didn't like that at all but it seemed there was nothing to be done about it.
the bedridden horror shrieked, and Holmes knew enough from his own experience to recognize it as a command, and Order that even
“If they do, I will deal with them.”
Holmes studied him for a quiet moment. "Well," he said finally with stoic reason, "if you are already dead then there is hardly any reason to fear a man coming to kill you.”
"Yes?" Mrs. Montressor said, looking up at him.
Montressor looked terrified at the thought. "Sir, you ask too much-"
"Very good, sir" he replied with a quick and informal bow, taking his leave and the corner of Holmes' mouth quirked up at the constable's insistence on treating him as some sort of superior. It was a harmless quirk at least.
“You have a CT scanner?”
After he got dressed, Sherlock walked over to the bed and gently kissed John on the lips, like a happy child, John smiled in his sleep and then rolled over totally contented. “My totally innocent Doctor,” Sherlock thought as he quietly left their cabin.
Sherlock lifted the lid of his laptop, knowing that once he accessed all the information on John Watson that he would be opening the equivalent of a Pandora’s box. He skimmed through all the information regarding John’s childhood, his military service, etc., until he came to the part about John’s breakdown. Then he closed his eyes, went to his mind palace, imagining what it must have been like.
John blushed and looked down. “Call me, John.”
“You say anything like that again and I will gut you where you stand,” Sherlock hissed.
John laughed. “Now, that’s a change usually I’m the one saying I don’t understand.”
Clare stood beside John. “John, do you remember the conversation we had in the cab?” John nodded, not making eye contact. Clare’s eyes mirrored grief.  “John, you need to decide who you are going to give your black card to.” Without hesitation John reached into the pocket of his robe and handed the black card to Sherlock. Sherlock took the card; it was still warm from the heat of John’s body.  His Doctor, friend, lover, his heart, had handed him a black card. If John realized his potential and awakened as a killer similar to a Yoma, Sherlock was obligated to kill him.
Sherlock put his lips to John’s ear. “Always, John, I am with you always.” Then he propelled them both to where Wiggins sat waiting in a black Land Rover.
“I am out of the IC unit. I can tell because there aren’t as many beeping gadgets. Without opening my eyes I know John and Mycroft are there. I keep my eyes shut to see what I can hear-nothing. I’m bored. As I open my eyes I look to my right, 45 degree angle, John is there. I try to raise my hand to beckon to him. I can’t. I am handcuffed to the bed.  I pull at the cuff like an animal caught in a trap. John, what is happening?”
“No, and it’s something that can’t be discussed on the phone.”
I am calm and sedate as I walk through the streets and back to Baker Street. “I will beg John not to move out of our bedroom, if I have to,” I think as I whistle tune from Mozart’s ‘The Marriage of Figaro’. I open the door, spin Mrs. Hudson around and then look around the empty flat.
You laugh and then grow serious. “Sherlock…”
Clare took a step closer to Sherlock. “The healer won’t complete the process with you standing there, you have to leave.” Clare said firmly.
Clare smiled sadly. “I can find someone to take him back, but he won’t leave you. He is your mate.”
Sherlock reached up, gripping John’s arms, until they were both entwined.
“Hello?” He asked sleepily.
I start to refute her use of ‘friend’ then stop when I observe Anderson looking up at me. Mrs. Hudson puts a kettle on, speculatively watching us watch each other. She raises an eyebrow then leaves the room.
Wiggins picked at his shirt. “It’s all they had.”
Sherlock swallowed for it always seemed surreal when John said those words. “I love you too, John.” Sherlock said as he kissed the top of John’s head.
Though Sherlock worked to keep his voice strong and clear, John could hear a tremor in it as he spoke, it reminded John of that horrible day that Sherlock had jumped off the roof of St. Bart’s. Tears poured down John’s face for he knew if he didn’t get help soon he would die. For a few moments John gazed into Sherlock’s eyes as if seeing him for the first and last time. The curly brown soft hair, the pale white skin, the chiseled cheekbones, the shinning blue-green eyes, these were only the physical attributes that made Sherlock beautiful. John sighed peacefully as he thought how irritated Sherlock would be if he knew that his intellect was the last thing that John considered to be an attribute of Sherlock’s. “Sherlock, I’m not going to make it. Please promise me you will leave immediately after I have drawn my last breath. Promise me.” John insisted as tears poured down Sherlock’s face. John hoped that Sherlock would do as he promised for John didn’t want Sherlock to see his mortal body go through the death throes. As John reached up to touch Sherlock’s face, his body grew heavy and cold in Sherlock’s arms. He looked up once more at Sherlock and then John smiled. “Sherlock…” John whispered as he fell back into Sherlock’s arms.
John looked up at Sherlock in wonder. “Wow, it’s Hugh Laurie. I didn’t know that you were personally acquainted with him. He’s one of my favorite musicians.”
A high pitched scream filled the air, and then Sherlock remembered where he had heard the sound before. It was the screech of a Golem. The horrible creature came into view; it was even more hideous by flashlight. John was the first to react as he stepped forward and quickly wielded his sword out in a challenge. Sherlock took a deep breath as he watched John in action. The passionate way John fought filled Sherlock with desire and horror. His John so sweet, so loving, so sexually charged, hacked the creature to death in a manner of seconds. No one said anything as the evil creature breathed its last.  When John was satisfied that the Golem was dead, he took a rag out of his pocket and cleaned off his sword. Sherlock tried to ignore the arterial spray that covered John’s shirt as he approached the rest of the party. “Let’s go, the Golem are going to smell the blood and this place will be covered with them in a few minutes.” John said as he motioned for the party to follow him.
Sherlock watched in helplessness as Laura examined John and then issued orders. Though he understood the dialect, Sherlock’s head swam in confusion as Laura barked out a list of medical supplies she would need.
“Yes,” he whispered.
There is a slight pause, then I hear Anderson. “Anderson, how are things?”
They made their way up the stairs, then he stopped before a door and knocked. “John, I have someone here to see you.” John gave them a blank stare, until he took him in his arms. “John, this is Doctor Shaw, your new therapist.” He then looked up at her with an expression in his eyes that few had witnessed—desperation. “So, can we count on you?”
Molly stood up her brown eyes full of sadness. “Sherlock, I’m sorry, he’s contracted…he’s contracted…”
A few hours later you and I stand in front of the mirror admiring each other in our tuxes. Mary comes up behind us. “You both look so handsome,” She says as she kisses your neck and then mine. I blush as Mary smiles. “You are so cute when you blush, Sherlock.”
I look over at Anderson in mock outrage. “Of course, not.”
John felt confused and tired. “I gave you a sleeping potion,” John said.
The guard cleared his throat, “Sir, we are closing you are going to have to leave.”
He rushed after her. “Wait, I’m sorry, please I need your…help.” Then he handed her a folder. “Please.”
“Oh, I don’t know, maybe because it was always a fantasy of yours.”
You look over at me in exasperation. “I’ll be right back.” Then you look back at me, taking Anderson’ bottle of pills with you. After you leave the room Anderson looks at me.
“John, please don’t leave me.”
“John’s diagnosis.” Then he collapsed in his chair, looking at the empty one opposite him.
“Oou, this is the exciting part. He’s reconstructing every detail in the room just as it was when he last saw it.” Irene replied in excitement watching Sherlock. John wheeled closer to Sherlock blocking Irene’s view. “Ah, how cute he’s attempting to protect his mate.” She cooed.
Sherlock reached around his waistband for the round cylinder that held John’s pills. “God, how I hate these,” Sherlock thought as he held out his palm to John. He then watched John’s every movement, the way he reached for his canteen, the way his hand shook as he took a drink, the way his throat pulsed as he swallowed the pill. Sherlock’s face began to flush as he stared at the skin on John’s neck.
A silence fills the room. It terrifies me. “No, but we are going to have to make some ground rules. I casually brought up our proposal to Anderson in hospital. He is considering it, but you’ve got to get it together. There is too much at stake here. Goodnight, Sherlock and I…love you.”
“You drank the wine.”
I pull a scarf out of my pocket. I hide my face within its folds. Soon we are on our way to a crack house. We walk because no one will take us in a cab. We then take a bus. As we descend the steps of the bus even John shivers from the cold. We have only gone a short distance when I take your arm. “John, we are being followed.” I whisper into your ear.
You sigh. “Come on Sherlock, you can do better than that.”
“Sherlock, you have jeopardized your rehab, not to mention exposing me to a drug reaction or God knows what else,” John chided.
You hover over me staring, not saying a word. My teeth are clenched so tight that my jaw hurts.  I know what you want and you know what I want, but we are both too cowardly to act on it. Then something in me snaps. I thrust my hips until your body makes a circular arc. You are now underneath me. “John, I can’t do this anymore I…” My voice trails off in a whisper. You look frightened. You look angry. Yet, I peel back your expressions like an onion until I see something in the depths of your eyes; something that makes my heart beat faster. I count the pulse beats in your neck. They race as do mine. I place my hands on either side of your cheeks.
John Watson was getting married to a barrister that had dated him for years, she had groomed him, educated him in the arts and finer things of life, and so now John supposed that it was time to get married. Sharon was a wonderful person, so why didn’t he feel more excited? When Sharon offered to send him on a cruise, John jumped at the idea. All these thoughts fled his mind as he bent down and picked up the gold plated cigarette case and started to hand it to the tall green-eyed man that stood in front of him.
You take Alice and I make a mad dash for the bathroom.
Laura fixed her gaze on Sherlock as she answered, “Yes, in every sense of the word.”
A few moments later, John’s garments lay strewn around the room in a type of clothing cyclone. John sighed as he remembered their love making sessions. Sherlock nibbled on John’s ear lobe. “I deduce that you are thinking of last night, am I correct?”
I pull John down beside me on a dirty mattress. “They will soon be here,” I whisper into your ear. “Follow my lead.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and was about to verbally take Mrs. Hudson down a few pegs wrapped up in a sarcastic reply, when he noticed John as he moved his foot around in a suggestive circular motion. “God,” Sherlock thought as he just sat there transfixed by the motions that John was making.
“What?”
Jake awoke to the coldness of pre-dawn and he shivered not wanting to leave the warmth of his sleeping gear. Clare was already up and getting ready to head out. Jake yawned, as he reluctantly got up. “Good morning,” he said to Clare in an effort to remain cheerful.
Several Days Later
“Yes, who else would it be?” John snapped irritably.
I then make my way upstairs to my room. I take off all my clothes. I lay on the bed naked. The moon once more makes an appearance, making my skin glow in its illumination. I hear a small sound at my door. I am up in an instant. I know you are on the other side. I want to reach through the wood until it splinters. I stand there knowing that you are just out of reach. I wait, then you turn on your heel and leave. I go back to bed. It’s going to be a long night.
"Then my next stop will be to consult the books of heraldry at parliament."
That the secrets Watson had guarded this long, lonely century were not so easily shared with a man he’d only just met, who’s acquaintance was temporary, and who’s confidence would come to an end as soon as the case was wrapped up?
he did now, obviously.)
"Only a fool doesn't believe in the inherent sin of man. What makes you think you are heaven-bound?"
Watson stayed until dawn, until the very last moment possible and when he retreated into the dark space of the garret room for the day, the memory of Holmes' hand on his sleeve was like a spear of light in his chest that chased away the shadows.
"Pears?"
“I wish you wouldn’t talk that way, it’s terribly unnerving.”
Watson seemed to think about this, and after a moment's contemplation his face cleared in understanding. "I did, now you mention it. A young lady- Mrs. Lucy Montressor. She stopped coming one day quite suddenly, no notice. Of course, these things happen and I have plenty of clients, so I didn't think much of it at the time. But she wasn't at Mass that week, either. Before I had a chance to hear any news of her Newman accosted me, and then I had bigger problems to concern myself with."
That was all the invitation Holmes needed and he was off, mind running swift down the whitewater torrents of his thoughts. "Firstly, you cannot stay here; certainly not during the day. It would only take a bottle of accelerant and a match to end you. Were I Newman’s master, this should be the first place I would come looking in search of you.”
"How long will this thrall last? You said a few weeks...I do not think I can bear it."
"Don't go near him, boy!" Mycroft shouted, spinning Georgie around and placing him behind him before turning to glare at Holmes. "You
Mycroft snorted and glowered, shifting about in his chair. "If the human is lucky. More often than not, it is expected that they will eventually consent to become a vampire, rather than be claimed by mortal death. For the death of one bond by necessity means the death of the other."
The room was choked with memory, and until yesterday Holmes had not set foot within for many months. First because he could not bear to, and then because he saw no benefit in doing so. He was attempting to move on. Surrounding himself with the mementos of his dead lover seemed counterproductive, and in this room were all things that reminded him of Stamford, not least of all the man’s bed, which was now occupied by someone - something - else.
“I- I did not think it relevant,” he said lamely, and that only earned him a derisive snort.
“Not require, no, though it might make mental contact gentler for you.”
"Mycroft is nothing if not sensible. It has been said he is too much so; he deals in all matters with cold reason. I am the only exception to this -- to be honest, I think he begrudges me slightly for it. Thus while he will no doubt see the logic in having you as an ally, whether he will find that logic sufficient enough to outweigh the danger inherent in such an alliance, I cannot say."
John wheeled forward. “Tell us what’s so special about it, Sherlock.”
She takes my hands in her own. “Mary, you must hate me after what I’ve done.”
Sherlock’s grandma smiled sadly at John, “This is a place for people to go to remember, it’s not a place for someone as young as you, for you have yet to create your memories,” Sherlock’s grandma said softly as she reached up and touched John’s cheek.
Gradually, Sherlock’s body retained some of John’s warmth and then like sleeping beauty Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open and he smiled. “John, you’ll do anything to get me naked, won’t you?” Sherlock whispered.
I pull you and Anderson close. “Scotland Yard is under attack. There’s been a credible threat on the entire city.  Now, get up and get out.”
“John, don’t refer to yourself as a cripple,” Sherlock snapped aloud. “You are the target because someone wants to get to me through you.”
I watch while you go over to the nightstand, grab a condom, lube Anderson up, instructing him to get on all fours. He stops what he’s doing and I give you a menacing look. You laugh. “Anderson, don’t stop in the middle or Sherlock gets quite angry.” I smile when Anderson goes back to work, wondering if I should be worried about his teeth biting me while you fuck him. The room begins to fill with groans and the scent of sex. It is glorious, like a perfect Mozart Sonata or the thrilling climax of a grueling case—perfection.
“Sherlock, if you need to cry, please do you are safe with me.” John whispered as he gently massaged between Sherlock’s legs.
Anderson bends over the body and inspects the victim’s feet. “The toes have been removed with a surgical instrument.”
When you come through the door I breathe a sigh of relief. “John, I think that Anderson is running a fever.” He hands Alice to Mrs. Hudson, and goes to check on Anderson.
I am mad. I am ashamed. I am alone. I am bereft and so I lash out. “John you have an unerring knack for stating the obvious.  Let’s get back to Baker Street and hash this over once more.”
Sherlock gagged and coughed for a few seconds as he tried to control his breathing. John smoothed his hand along the back of Sherlock’s head. “Sherlock, please are you okay?”
You walk into the room, towel drying your hair. “Oh, Jesus, I just got a shower. Now I will have to get another.”
Without another word John grabbed Sherlock’s arms above his head and handcuffed him to the head board of the bed. The next thing Sherlock felt was John’s hands firmly slipping some sort of collar around his neck and then John grinned down at his captive. “Sherlock, blindfold, or no blindfold,” John asked as he held up a small black piece of material.
He laughs then begins to wash my arms, kissing the scars I have inflicted upon myself. “Sherlock, promise me you won’t do this to yourself anymore.”
John had just started to get warm when the doorbell rang. “Who the bloody hell could that be?” John thought angrily as he reached for the remote button that would unlock his door.  Not bothering to ask who it was John pressed the button, the click of the lock slid open as John called out, “Come in.”
John looked at the intricate details of the painting’s seaside town and felt as he could reach out and touch the water of the shoreline. Sherlock’s grandma watched John intently for a few moments and then said, “Sherlock, is an artist and a critic; therefore every time he creates, the critic in him tears his art down. He is always attracted to the case he hasn’t solved, the art he hasn’t tried, the person he hasn’t met. It makes me afraid for Sherlock, for everything comes so easy to him that I am afraid that one day he will be put to the test. Life will present him with a bill that will be a high price to pay.”
Sherlock bit on his lower lip as he maneuvered John’s wheelchair through the crowd. He watched as most of the passengers headed towards the touristy section. “Which way should we go Sherlock?” John asked.
“Yes, how come you never told me about this place? It’s huge and has enough supplies to last for months, perhaps years. You and Mrs. Hudson are full of surprises. When are you coming home?”
I don’t confirm or deny your words. “Mrs. Hudson, I am not sure of what you are referring to. However, if you are referring to what I think you are, John Watson would never admit to having feelings for me. I would have to be cold in my grave before he would weep.”
Sherlock pushed them both towards the bedroom, “There’s nothing to discuss, you two either get busy or I’m going to leave and find someone that will.”
John nodded and then looked down at the ground, “Sherlock, I can’t marry you. I mean how do you expect to keep up with your active lifestyle toting a cripple around?”
I pull my arms away, covering my body when a feeling of shame overwhelms me. “I never make promises.” Then I look into his pale blue eyes. “Why didn’t you wash your hair?”
Sherlock’s hand shook when he opened the bottle and fished out one white pill.
Sherlock’s voice was weak and yet he still managed a witty come back. “Would you also take on a legion of angels, John?”
Mycroft grabbed her arm. “We agreed to meet you but not in there.”
I pull my knees up to my chest. “No, now get out.” I growl.
“You beckon to me,” Sherlock whispered in his low dulcet toned voice. He then opened the case with trembling hands. There it was the syringe. Sherlock licked his lips in anticipation as he tied off his arm with a rubber strap. Then he filled the syringe drawing in shaky breaths as he did so. Ignoring the scars on his arm Sherlock found what he was looking for-a vein. Then like Maleficent whispering into Sleeping Beauty’s ear, Sherlock heard his own destructive entity whisper. “Sherlock, plunge the needle in.”
A few moments later, John was alone again, wondering how he was going to find out whom the voices belonged to and even though he knew he was a sitting target, John was excited for he was finally going to be doing something, he was not just going to waste away in that stupid chair.
I flick some water at him, attempting to lighten the blow I have just given him. “Stop, you’re going to make me hard and they’re all dead anyway.”
I hear a low rumble, then a few moments later a slight vibration shakes the room. “John, are you okay?”
He stood before him, smiling when the sun glinted off his golden hair. “John, I’ve come to give you your medicine.”
John put his arms around Sherlock’s waist. “Sherlock, I will kill myself before I would ever hurt you. However, you must face the fact that well over the last few days, I have not been myself.”
John gasped and whispered, “Sherlock, Jesus what the hell? Do know everything?”
Sherlock’s grandma shook her head, “Sherlock painted that.”
Laura smiled. “Sherlock, you are so transparent. Irene and I were never exclusive. Our tastes are too varied. After all, haven’t I told you a million times how scrumptious John is?”
“Are you ready for battle, John?” I ask as I look into the mirror.
John got off the bed and answered the door. Sherlock pushed his way into the room and searched John’s face. Nightmares had plagued John ever since Sherlock had known him. “Are you having nightmares about Afghanistan again?” Sherlock tried to make his query nonchalant; however, the worry for John made Sherlock’s voice slightly higher than usual.
Even though they were in first class, John was intensely uncomfortable during the entire flight, so that by the time the plane landed, a fine sheen of sweat stood out on his upper lip, for even the pain killers weren’t helping.
John smiled, “Oh, God, yes.”
Mrs. Hudson was the first to recover, “Well, Sherlock it seems to be the end of the world, or at least London, so you might as well have a cup of tea.” She said with tears in her eyes.
Sherlock slammed his laptop shut, but not before Wiggins had a peek at the screen. “So, you’re keeping an uncover blog, are you?”
He dislodged his arm from her grasp, then nodded. “Fine, Doctor, thank you for your help. I will send a wire to your account. Your services are no longer required.”
John was breathing heavily and could barely speak. “Sherlock, I am not seeing colors. I have not seen them since we entered this world,” John said as he made an effort to answer Sherlock without gasping for air.
Sherlock’s grandma waved him on, “Of course my dear, enjoy.”
“So, aren’t you married to the famous Doctor Strauss?” John asked to keep things from getting too personal.
John answered first. “To hunt,” he said. His eyes glittered from excitement like Clare’s.
“Sssh,” John said as he undid the top button of Sherlock’s trousers.
After a quick breakfast they hit the trail as Clare and Rathery tracked the other dragon’s trail. They had only gone a few kilometers when a giant winged blue bird swooped down on them, it quickly changed its mind about the party being easy prey when Rathery breathed out a plume of fire in the bird’s direction. After that the day wore on and on, until Jake almost wished for something to happen, anything to distract him from the plodding ahead in this frozen wasteland. When Clare stopped suddenly in front of him, Jake almost ran into her. “What is it?” Jake whispered.
John goaded Sherlock more. “Aw, tisk, tisk, is somebody becoming like his brother Queen Mycroft?”
Still annoyed at Laura, Sherlock released a sarcastic verbal barb at John. “It’s just a chopper ride and it beats walking.” As soon as he said it Sherlock wished he could whisk his careless words back. “John, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to imply that…”
For some reason John shivered, Sherlock’s low dulcet voice made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. “Sherlock, yes you are the most observant person I have ever met.  Why are you asking me this?”
I pat her on each shoulder. “Yes, I’m fine. It’s going to be a wonderful day. There’s been another dismemberment.”
As if sensing John’s thoughts Sherlock laid a warm hand on the back of John’s neck, “There is no music, without you John, therefore there is no dancing.”
John leaned into him. “I still can’t get used to the fact that you are real. You are real, right?”
Laura laughed. “Oh, John you are so cute. Even if you get caught, you will not be charged, for practically everyone on this planet owes me something.”
You look away from my dilated eyes and turn to Lestrade. “Anderson’s in surgery now. He’s strong so I’m sure he’ll pull through.”
“How come I don’t get a fancy lab coat?”
I observe Molly when she comes into the room. Her hair hangs in tendrils around her face, making her appear like an anime character gone wrong—her eyes too kind and round. She looks fearful and sad.
John’s heart was pounding as Sherlock locked eyes with him; Sherlock’s eyes looked almost black they were so dilated. There wasn’t a sound in the room except the music that blared from Sherlock’s computer, it was Holiday by Greenday.
Mycroft smiled. “Oh you will dear, you will.”
The thought of you gasping in my arms is a thought I dare not linger on. I could make you fall in love with me dearest John. I really could if I tried. Then all my attention would be focused on you. If I could burn you to ashes and then raise you up like a Phoenix I would. The risk is too great. Like Icarus we would both plummet to our death-the sun too bright for us to handle. The pain of unrequited passion makes my stomach cramp up. I shake. I roll off the bed and onto the floor clutching my head in my hands. You are at my side.
John shook his head, “No, just the one shirt please and I will pay cash. I know I know you think I am crazy, but I am getting married…”
“Mmm, that feels good, don’t stop.”
Anderson smiles as he rubs my cheek with the back of his hand. “Yes, Sherlock, I tried to off myself.”
“Sherlock, laptops give off radiation, you should really…”John’s voice trailed off when Sherlock lifted up the laptop revealing what was underneath. “Oh, I see,” John said wickedly as he reached for Sherlock’s waist.
“Dr. Watson, it’s time to go hunting.” Clare whispered back, her voice was low and grating like the wind that howled outside.
Anderson leans against me, looking up at the narrow staircase in dread. Without a word, I sweep him up in my arms and carry him up to your old room, then deposit him on the bed. He looks up at me, then smiles. “Thanks.”
John slipped the underwear off and replaced it with another garment. Sherlock took a deep breath as John’s hands slipped the new underwear on. John grinned as he slipped the pants on and showed Sherlock how to tie them, and then John slipped a sort of undershirt over Sherlock’s head, followed by the jacket which he showed Sherlock how to put on. “Make sure the right part is over the left, only dead people have the left part folded over first.” John said as he tied the top part of the clothing on Sherlock. Sherlock felt weak in the knees as John’s fingers grazed his nipples. John smiled when they immediately hardened. Sherlock took a deep breath and then knelt on the floor before he passed out.
Mycroft glanced over at Laura and then sighed, “If you had remained with the rest of the party you would have heard that it isn’t the statue that is valuable it is what’s inside.”
he thought as he stared at the broken line of Holmes’ body where it sagged in the chair, bandaged head to foot and a chemical concoction the only thing keeping agony at bay. Watson tried to refute it but all such attempts were futile. He had come to Holmes first to judge him, and then to ask for help, and despite the fact Holmes owed him nothing and had no real
"I am hardly willing to turn you loose upon the world again. No, I mean to keep an eye on you, at least until this mess you've caused is sorted to my satisfaction. You are also a player in whatever darkness has enveloped the church, and I need you nearby least your part proves pivotal. Newman was less than honest about you, and I intend to discover why. I have my own theories, but I require more facts of the matter. In that vein, a man who can read the thoughts of others may prove invaluable."
"Are you proposing vampirism is a disease such as that?" Watson said, deeply affronted. "I assure you, I am perfectly in control of my faculties."
The couple followed Holmes downstairs and out the front door. The night was cool, the lamplighter making his way down the street, having passed their home already. James watched his wife carefully, holding on to her arm with a tight, frightened grip, but she seemed perfectly at ease, breathing in the night air with a serene countenance.
“With the truth, certainly, but not with your life. He
"I cannot say how old he was for certain; I did not get much of a look at the fellow. As for danger...I do believe the potential exists, but there is reason to hope it is not so great as you fear."
Holmes smiled, somewhat less congenially. "Ah, it is settled then. Thank you."
“From a pig, of course. Go.”
"I'm certain it can be managed."
Mycroft remained silent.
"You just spent over a week at the church," Watson said, slightly confused.
to be at home, at least not to a casual observer. But there was never anything casual about Mycroft’s observations. He looked keenly at his brother. "You are keeping your cases close to home these days."
"That depends entirely upon your own actions. If your affliction comes with the prerequisite taste for human blood, I do not see how I can."
"Didn't need my help after all, eh doctor?" he muttered under his breath.
Watson glanced at his watch, face crinkling in disapproval at the hour. "Your brother is a miser," he grumbled, but kept his hands to himself.
"The Lord had very little to do with it."
“Oh come, Doctor. It was only in jest.”
understand, better perhaps than he realized.
"At least you now know a doctor," Watson said blithely and Holmes wanted to hit him, the feelings of loss and guilt that surfaced at the near-mention of Stamford seething just under his skin.
"Good man, though last time I was confident it ended rather badly; do take care." He shifted, ostensibly to redistribute the weight on his leg. "Now, when do you suppose I might have a look about the crime scene?"
yes, we are still banging stubbornly away at this...
Watson came, pulling Holmes into his arms and holding him tightly, Holmes lips on him already. He didn't  care if Watson could enjoy such physical affections; Holmes could and he intended to. "The day has never moved so slowly."
His instincts proved correct when Holmes immediately poured blood on it.
Holmes would be able to find almost every drop, if given enough time. Most other men would be nonfunctional lunatics under the weight of such a mind. Holmes was a functional one.
Jackson stopped breathing. There was no inhale - as a man might do before holding his breath - he simply quit, and did not start again. It took nearly a full minute for his heart to let out a slow, ponderous thump.
"I will not tell the Yard," Holmes said truthfully, and she sighed in relief as they met the corner of the street, and turned back.
Jackson studied him, Holmes' chin still clutched in an ice-cold hand. The predatory gleam had returned to his eyes. "You've intrigued me up to this point as the man who caused my good friend's death,” the doctor said, voice low and lethal. “But we are far, far from the subject at hand. There is a man who has been sent to kill me. Will you help me find evidence against him, so that I may set the proper authorities on him?"
"I know it is certainly
Mycroft looked at his brother sadly for a moment, but it was quickly covered by cold steel. "Then you will not be surprised when I say I do not wish you to meet with him."
"I'll go get you some water now,” Watson said hastily, strange twisting feeling in his stomach. He stood and slipped away, busied his hands with filling a cup from the kitchen downstairs. From Holmes' condition Watson surmised he’d likely had neither food nor water the whole of the day.
Holmes took it in stride. "Well, we now know the power of faith has no dominion over you, but what of gravity? Can you fly, or is there a far more mundane reason the man's body was laying atop the church roof?"
Jackson’s eyes narrowed for a moment, the blue turning to steely grey. "What do you mean?"
“No, you don’t,” Watson said grimly, and Sturgerson gave a wry grin.
The words echoed and roiled in his mind, crawling beneath his skin and itching along his nerves; his entire body infested with the sound of Watson's voice. It began to fade but only because he was complying, his body moving not independently of thought, but at the behest of someone else's. Distantly he wondered if he could resist, and the natural inclination to do so was there. But now was not the time for such things. Resistance would do nothing but fuel the deadly predator that wore Watson's face.
"To the point of the vampire who waits outside the city," Holmes said, because Mycroft would believe neither of them about the thrall and therefore speaking of it was pointless, "he knows who Watson is. He will not have a true name but he will have a description, and a profession. And he knows that I was involved in the business.
"You have my permission," he replied crisply and at once, "you are not responsible for the results of my own choices." Watson didn't know it, but those were almost the exact words Stamford had said to Holmes. Before he died as a result of those choices, of course.
Watson started slightly at the knowledge that Holmes had at least guessed he’d spent the night beneath the earth. But why should he be surprised, knowing what he did of the man’s abilities? "I thought you'd insisted I stay here.”
"It it is possible he found another source of income."
She gasped, the hand on his arm trembling as her body told him what her lips could not. She opened her mouth to deny it but Holmes cut her off, saying, "Madam, you have already attempted to deceive me once this evening, please do not make a habit of it."
“Thank you,” Holmes said. “You have been most helpful. Oh- and tell my brother I am perfectly fine, and do not require surveillance."
The figure pulled back slightly to peer up at him, but Holmes couldn’t make much of him through the pea soup fog. The vague outline of suit and hat...a gentleman then.
"I'm sure everyone is similarly impressed at first."
"Let me make myself rightly understood: London is as much my city as it is yours. I have pledged my life to its defense, and I do not pledge myself lightly. It is now shadowed by a threat as great as any it has known. Where else should I be, if not here? I
There was a light burning in the upstairs window, and Watson opened the door for him as he sprinted up the steps.
. He didn’t want to try to anyway. He let Watson’s arm fall from his weakened grasp as his head lolled against the doctor’s side.
He nodded again, "And he did not attempt to harm you?" Watson would not have, point in fact but Holmes had to keep up appearances.
"Stay then," he said, taking Watson's hand again. He felt genuinely tied to Watson now, as if their souls had become one. He told himself it was simply Watson's blood in his veins speaking for him, but that hardly seemed to matter.
"And what would you do if confronted with proof of the matter?"
This did make Holmes’ amorous feelings somewhat of a thorny problem, for they were certainly a construct of the thrall. Thus, while both of them desired, it was only Watson’s affection that was genuine. That meant there was a line beyond which there would be no forgiveness, and Watson could not trust Holmes to recognize it.
"The fire? Oh it's ghastly," Mrs. Hudson said, shaking her head. "That young doctor was so nice the night he stopped by with your letter."
" He paced the room, nearly growling, lips curled up over sharp teeth that seemed longer than they had before.
"Perhaps he thought to keep them from becoming like the son. Who can say; the man was mad."
Presently the sound of a carriage suffused the heavy silence, emerging reaper-black from the gloom and coming to rest on the corner of Marylebone Road. A sole passenger disembarked and with a quiet exchange of payment sent the carriage on its way, clattering wheels muffled by the dense fog. The figure lingered on the corner, striking up a cigarette with one hand cupped around the match to shield it from the damp, staring into the impenetrable darkness with an equally obscured expression. Finally they crushed out the nub of cigarette and turned down the corner of Baker Street, up the cut stone steps of a nondescript building and rapped sharply upon the door.
“How on Earth-”
The worst of it, of course, is that Watson wasn’t entirely sure where the line was either. None of
“Did you not set aflame the set of chemistry texts I brought you for Christmas three years ago?”
“He did not wish you to know,” Mycroft rumbled. “He never meant for you to become ensnared in the business. And he knew you would, if you discovered it. He knew your nature well enough to know you could do nothing else.”
!" he hissed. "'Why' is still a matter of investigation. And I cannot say for certain that she is, only that it is a possibility which must be examined. I find myself...hobbled, in this matter." He looked at Watson meaningfully. "I need your assistance, old boy. I cannot bring the Yard into it; to do so would run a great risk of exposing you, and we both know how that ends. But I cannot be as many places as I am needed."
Watson repressed a shudder and glanced at his friend. “How long had you suspected?”
Watson stood as well, moved to action at the mention of Stamford's name. "I did what I had to do to keep us both safe; knowing I had been to see you would have made you a person of interest to the church. That could have been dangerous for
"I am quite capable of looking after myself."
Perhaps the most dangerous thing about it was that he was beginning not to care.
Jackson pulled himself up tall, glaring at Holmes for a long moment, dark shadows flickering through his eyes.
"What have you learned?" he asked.
He did not know if there were words enough for the feelings he had right now. Feelings he had not expected to ever have again. His stone-grey heart had cracked open, and inside there was still living tissue. It was a miracle on par with the parting of the seas; he had not thought it possible.
"Indeed," he said, trying to shift into a more comfortable position and finding the task an impossible one. He tilted his chin toward's the door. “To what purpose is the guard detail?"
Watson gave him a look that held a hundred exasperated questions within it but did as instructed, which was fortunate because Holmes didn't have time to argue with him. If he was to 'kill' Doctor Jackson and keep the fire from spreading through the neighborhood, he had to time things perfectly.
At the end the vicar smiled pleasantly. “I believe you may work out well; go with Father Newman and he will look after you.”
Holmes felt a small flare of childish triumph at the success of his disguise but didn't linger over it; there were more important things. "Don't mind if I do," he gruffed out, helping himself to a chair and sitting down with a thump. When he spoke again, it was as himself. "Hardly any way to talk to an old friend, Doctor. And keep your voice down; it is possible we are being observed."
It was a question well below Watson’s intellect, and Holmes shot him a look of mild exasperation. “Who else would I ask? You say you know little, tell me what you
"Indeed," Holmes replied a bit dryly. “Then take me into your confidence and I will determine whether or not to involve the police; thus your priestly aspirations will remain unsullied.”
“You are going to be the death of me,” Watson replied, desperate strained edge to his voice as Holmes' scent filled his head with maddening thoughts.
He waited for the man's answer, having maneuvered the three of them to reach this very moment, this scenario.
"I'd like evidence of such, but I can't keep you here if you choose to go."
do not want to go. It is my will you are feeling, not your own. But to protect you I must- it is too dangerous for me to stay during the day. I wouldn’t be able to protect you while in torpor anyway. I would be more than useless, for if danger befell you, you would be torn between protecting me and protecting yourself."
Holmes tongue clicked against the roof of his mouth and perhaps it was only in Watson's imagination that there was a reproach in it. "The last time you killed it was in self-defense, but your method of disposal has since brought a host of problems to my door. You could have made the body disappear, but you did not. Instead you left it lying on the roof of a church as a 'message' the entire city heard and forced my hand into shielding various criminal activities in an effort not to expose you, because doing so will ensure the death of more people than I am comfortable bearing the weight of."
"It was a most peculiar case,” he said in lieu of an apology, “and it required an unconventional solution. For the sake of my anonymous client, I could not enlist the help of the Yard- nor anyone else, for that matter. His life depended on utter secrecy, and still does."
Holmes ignored the madman’s rambling. "Do you have reason to believe this man thinks you are a vampire?"
"She was already on her way home- she had no memory of it, no memory of that- that
“What do you suppose his game is?” he asked, then amended hastily, “I-I don’t mean a
a bloody vampire, for all I know. He’s a lunatic, Holmes. What sense is there to make of it?”
"Indeed," Holmes said, looking down at Montressor with an unreadable expression. Watson departed and Holmes concealed himself in the deep shadows of the alley, half hidden behind a drain pipe. There was nothing to do now but wait.
But Mycroft was in even less a mood for his brother’s humor than normal. “Because Stamford was Diogenes!” he thundered, slamming his fist into the armrest. “And if he ever saw a vampire within London's borders, he would kill it on sight!"
to require an evening-hours doctor, just
"Firstly, dispose of the burnt corpse. It doesn't matter how."
"An unknown enemy sits at our doorstep, threatening all London and you wish me to
He removed from beneath his waistcoat a long, bulky envelope, both postage and address from the Netherlands.  He passed it to Holmes, who snatched up the parcel greedily and pulled out several sheets of foolscap covered front to back in small, neat handwriting. He stared at it a moment.
Conclusion: Watson was experiencing something akin to hibernation and while the dark presence that animated his dead flesh slumbered, he was but a hair’s breadth from true death.
He was mildly surprised to find the doctor’s eyes open. He looked quite dead.
Holmes snorted softly. “Hmm, if only he’d done the same in regards to murder. Ah well, anything else pertinent to the case?" Most likely the dearth of material items was due to the fact he’d been a thrall. Holmes suspected Newman had been sent to London with the purpose of keeping an eye on Father Deighton; What point would there be in acquiring anything beyond the most basic of necessities?  Would the thrall even allow him to consider such notions as personal comfort and material desires? He did not know. Certainly his own experience did not seem so overpowering in that regard, but it appeared the effect of thrall was different for everyone. Holmes had certainly not detected in Newman any of the all-encompassing devotion for his Master than he held for Watson.
Mycroft shifted in irritation, but he did focus on Holmes' words.
And thus the terms of his employment were settled. Point in fact, Holmes abided within God’s law for the next several days, tending to the birds, sleeping in the shed, and acquainting himself with the staff of both church and clergy house.
"Likely by finding my resting place and stabbing me.” He cocked his head, regarding Holmes at an angle. “You don't believe I am what I say I am," he said. "I could prove it all to you, quite easily too."
“Could you not do so again?”
"It is quite all right, Jacob," Father Deighton interjected, regaining his composure. "Mister Holmes is doing no more than the Lord has tasked him with." He offered Holmes an apologetic smile. "Forgive Brother Newman his temper," he said. "He is young and bold, and thinks only of my welfare. Please, if you have questions about Langley, I will hear them and answer as best I can, though I have spoken already to the police."
"I have to go," he said softly, and Holmes opened his eyes.
"How, when?!" Watson snapped, clearly agitated. "He wasn’t- isn't - how
Watson nodded, as willing now to be helpful and he had previously been uncooperative. "The man after me is a friend and fellow reverend of Father Deighton, the vicar of the church where Langley’s body was found. His name is Father Newman, and he has been a guest at the vicar's parish house for many weeks. I do not know their exact relationship, nor how or when he first began to suspect me, though I have my suspicions. I only know that four weeks ago, Langley began shadowing me with increasing frequency."
"He won't remember much beyond falling asleep," Watson assured him, “Fragmented pieces, perhaps. Like a dream.” Then he slipped soundlessly inside. He emerged moments later with the newly unconscious body of Montressor carried easily in his arms, as if he weighed no more than a child. He set him down gently and looked at Holmes.
Mycroft nodded.  "Both permanent and irreversible."
"Just the tea for now," he said, And Watson, but that was not something anyone could give him.
“You aren’t convinced.”
He already had one such problem to sort.
A cogitative hum emanated from the back of his throat. "They may already be here. It has been several days since the affair at the church. The sire’s child and at least one of his thralls is dead, and he will know the corpse pulled from the ashes of your house was not your own. Our only advantage there is that they do not yet wish to reveal their presence in the city. Rather than show themselves, they will send thralls.”
Watson squeezed his hand reassuringly. "Who could have guessed? Even I had no idea such a secret society existed in the city." He walked over to the window and Holmes joined him instantly, saying,
"We have made rather a mess of things, haven't we?" he said, burying his face in Watson's shirt.
Sturgerson set the book aside and chose his words carefully. “Your brother is an ardent man, Mister Holmes, and his hatred for vampires runs deep. Under his direction the Diogenes has flourished; he drug our archaic little coven into the nineteenth century and we now have branches in most of the major cities on the isle. But not all of us believe that every vampire is a soulless, indiscriminate killer.”
Holmes opened the cover with careful reverence, blinking down at the only vaguely familiar text.
Lestrade stared at him doubtfully. “Are you saying we’ve got a copycat killer?”
Watson laughed, the sound reverberating in his chest. "I suppose we have. Our intentions were good, at least." He gently stroked Holmes' hair, holding him close. "How are your injuries?" he asked suddenly. "You may still have some pain, and a limp, but the wound should be closed at least."
“My Gaelic is somewhat rusty.”
"I've called you plenty worse than that!" the inspector barked.
"Indeed," Lestrade agreed. "I'll send a constable 'round to the address once we identify the relatives." He stared at Holmes for a long moment, face pulled into a faint scowl. "Anything else?"
Holmes didn’t react to that; he simply turned away and headed for the stairs. He didn’t want or require Jackson’s empathy or understanding, and he didn’t care what this man - creature - thought of him or his human drama. He could show himself out once he was finished sporting.
"Oh, I intend to be out and about much sooner than that. Fear not doctor, I have a plan."
Holmes’ eyebrow lifted in inquiry. “Oh? Pray, elucidate.”
to me. He is not sustenance.”
suggestion."
Holmes dismissed the comment with a graceful turn of his head. "This is what I do. It is my...natural state, if one is inclined to look at it thus. But it is not yours."
Newman shook his head. “I was on Mission work in the north part of the country when Langley died. By the time I returned, things had quieted. As I was not present at the time I was not interviewed, and as I had no sure evidence for my suspicions I did not believe I would be taken seriously. In any case, it seemed unchristian to cast such aspersions against a man’s character without being certain.”
be saved, Mister Holmes. If your confession is an honest one.”
It took more effort than it should to force the words out through bloodied lips. "I think I am ready," he whispered, voice nearly gone.
Watson stopped pacing. “What? I mean, yes-yes you must be...”
Watson sighed, already defeated. That infernal
"And you are certain it is Father Newman who was the catalyst for Langley's involvement?"
trigger warnings for: more dead bodies (it's a theme), some blood and gore
Watson was definitely not expecting that. The worry ratcheted up a notch. “Stamford? What on Earth has he to do with this business?”
"And he did not tell you where he was going?"
"He was a Londoner, but unfamiliar to that particular area of the city. He had traveled there by underground that afternoon on a matter of some urgency, and he was fond of billiards."
“Newman frequently headed north on the pretense of missionary work. The last time was just before I left the church’s employ. He was gone three days, and when he returned he was a changed man. More focused, more zealous in his crusade for blood. It was in fact his interest in Blevins that caused me to put an end to that particular charade. He was absent on similar work the night Langley died.”
"As a matter of fact yes," she said again, surprised. "He's very-"
you’ve done, but I can tell the difference between thrall and whatever it is you two have managed to do to each other.”
Mycroft simply shook his head and turned to the door. "Foolish and irresponsible."
Watson wrangled his temper under control. Mycroft was not his enemy, and he could not afford to make him so. “That will take time. His mind is- very strong, almost too much so. It is difficult for him to control it, and such defense is all about control.”
"He is well enough considering the number of people who were trying to kill him."
The look Holmes gave him sent a shiver down his spine; burrowed under his skin and stayed there. Holmes' whole face was alight with determination and Watson watched him unreservedly, the fire and passion that burned all through him. Holmes was vividly alive and Watson realized that he was
"Shh," Watson said, trying to soothe, trying not to feel the clench in his heart as Holmes cried out for Stamford. "It's alright, you're alright, you're safe..."
"Holmes," said an exasperated and much harangued Inspector Lestrade, talking already before the door was full open. "Sorry to bother you so early, but I -" he stopped as he took in Holmes' haggard appearance, voice dropping to a whisper. "Good Lord! Are you alright?"
Holmes tossed him a sideways glance full of sharp, conniving angles that made Watson think Holmes knew exactly what he was thinking. "Understood. But if their intent were to kill me, I should think quite poorly of the sire’s intellect.” He read Watson’s questioning look and explained, “They’ve every reason to believe me to be your thrall, and that makes me the only person known to them who would have knowledge of your whereabouts. If they cannot find you, I become their only link to doing so. I will be of no use to them dead.”
of use, if the man would only let him.
Point in fact, it appeared to have an open invitation.
"Why not?" Holmes asked, and a dark shadow crossed Watson's face.
“Haven’t you? How many vampires have come here looking for the rogue prince, seeking to depose you? You say you killed them all; how many sires across how many clans have felt their proteges die one by one within London’s walls? And you think they would not take notice?”
“You don’t approve of my methods?” Watson asked mildly.
But that was where the discipline asserted itself. That flood of data did not simply swirl about unchecked. It was processed, tagged and cataloged; the rivers of information routed into canals of specialized interests, estuaries all leading to that vast ocean of knowledge Watson had glimpsed before. But this time he did more than glimpse. This time he allowed his awareness to plunge full into those waters, letting Holmes’ own mind pull and guide him below the surface.
"It’s abhorrent. So, this boy - a man now, by the size of his footprints - escaped? He's dangerous, Holmes. Any idea where we can find him?"
Holmes dismissed all of that. "As I am thralled, I needn't tell you I have no desire to not be bothered by 'that doctor', and he feels the same. He
“Of course we should not tell them,” he answered sternly, “not yet, certainly.  We do not yet have enough data to know how to proceed; to act in advance of the facts is folly.”
But Holmes was practically purring, sensing imminent victory. Bit by bit he was luring Watson in and they both knew it. "And what are you going to do, carry me about the city on your back?"
Mycroft seemed to know it as well. “You
“Mycroft resisted your Order,” he said presently, after Watson had collected himself a bit. “He may be able to instruct me in the art of it. If we are to fight these creatures, such a talent would be invaluable.”
Perhaps Holmes was right. Perhaps he never learned to be a proper vampire because he was never meant to be one. Not in the way they believed themselves to be.
“I had always said he was the most remarkable of men,” Holmes murmured after a long moment, subtle irony shading his voice.
"How do you propose I 'disappear' then?" he asked, intrigued at the implication that he needn't physically leave the city. The kettle continued to heat as they spoke, and Watson prepared the teapot.
The kitchen and hall were both empty as expected, and Holmes paused only long enough to take up an iron poker from the hearth before continuing on to the cellar door. It was closed, locked from the inside and that at least confirmed Newman’s presence. Holmes pressed a knee to the cold stone floor and jimmied open the lock, slipping through and pulling the door shut behind him.
Watson blinked in surprise, denials already forming in his mind. "Do I?" he asked, and the look Holmes gave him made him feel rather stupid.
A sound like snapping finger bones and Watson blinked, feeling something wet coat his fingers and he thought with detached confusion
Sherlock looked at Mycroft and then back at John as he said, “Yes, my point precisely.”
Sherlock looked around, then smirked. “No, I’m a sociopath so I don’t care.”
In that moment I hate Mycroft, for I know nothing about the human heart other than its physical attributes.  The average male heart is 300 grams.
John turned around and smiled at Sherlock. “Sherlock, you’re awake. Good to see you up and about. Come here and let me see that nose.” John said cheerfully. Sherlock silently padded over to where John stood and let John’s gentle fingers examine his nose. “Aw, my poor Sherlock, you are going to look like a raccoon tomorrow. A cute adorable raccoon,” John chuckled as he put his arms around Sherlock and held him close. After a few moments John reluctantly pulled away and beckoned Sherlock over to a chair. “Sit down and have some of my noodle soup,” John said as he proudly brought a bowl of the delightful smelling soup and sat it in front of Sherlock.  Sherlock usually picked at his food if he ate anything at all; however this time he sipped the soup with a relish that John had never seen Sherlock apply to food before. As John watched Sherlock lap up the soup he was content just to stand there and watch him. “Even when he slurps his soup, he fascinates me,” John thought.
