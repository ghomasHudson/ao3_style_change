The voice screamed on the quiet street. It was almost midnight. Sherlock's brows furrowed at the person calling his name, not only was it late, but it was annoying. But there was that lingering feeling in Sherlock that he knew the stranger shouting his name. He set his tea cup down and then stood up and walked over to the window. Sherlock couldn't believe his eyes. There was a blue police box in the middle of the street, and he was most certain that it was not there just a moment ago. And in front of the police box was a man. His hair was swooped to the side, and he was wearing a jacket, with suspenders, and bowtie...
Holmes nodded.
Sherlock assumed his original position and moaned as John cupped water and let it fall on Sherlock’s hair. It was silent, aside from the sound of the water rippling from John’s movement. He was careful when detangling Sherlock’s hair before applying the shampoo. He knew how tender-headed he could be. When he applied the shampoo, Sherlock gasped. He could hear John’s chuckle.
John shook his head. Sherlock’s hands hovered above his face and landed on his cheeks. “I love your cheeks so much, so round and soft. I love your face. You have the face of a soldier, and I don’t just mean because of the army. I hope that when you look into the mirror you see the most handsome man on earth, because that’s how I feel every time I see you.”
“He didn’t talk much after that. He went to her funeral, but he didn’t stay for the actual burial, that’s where I saw him first. He looked so…troubled. It was like he was already hurting, but this just made everything a thousand times worse. I decided to move in here, to check on him because from what Martha…my aunt…told me, he didn’t have a lot of friends, and nobody looked all that concerned about him, if they noticed his presence. Every time I went up there, he was in the same position, sitting on his chair with his head facing towards the window, some nights I would hear the violin playing. But the songs it produced were only somber. He barely ate; he would eat just enough to get by. Nobody ever came to visit him.”
"Why are we here? We shouldn't be here. Something is wrong, something is very wrong..."
John could not believe the words that came out of Sherlock’s mouth. He was angry that people treated the love of his life so poorly that he thinks that being seen with him romantically is an embarrassment, or a punishment. He is so ready to hear John agree with him, for them both to leave all for John’s sake, and this imaginary thought that he was thinking along those lines. Instead of hounding Sherlock with his bubbling anger, he only smiled and placed his open hands on the table to receive his love’s.
“Yes, yes I know. But to whom, you must tell me her name.”
Lara shrugged.
“Go on.” John growled.
“Thank you for this. I mean it.”
"He's better, I'm not sure, but he hasn't woken up yet."
“Yeah, Sherlock has a few funny stories too.”
In the late hours of the night, John woke up to find Sherlock snuggled into his embrace. Usually, John would have been sleeping on his back, as his days in the army forced him into the habit, but tonight, he just wanted Sherlock close to him. He wanted to treasure his presence, since he couldn’t when they were out in public. He remembers the talk Watson had with him while they were out trying to get a better understanding of each other.
John looks at the clock. He squints because his vision is slightly blurred. Sherlock was right, it was time for him to go and pick up Kylie from Mrs. Hudson. With Sherlock's urging, he was up and grabbing his coat to leave the flat. He turned around and saw Sherlock staring at him with fondness.
"Sherlock, come on, time to get up."
“Why?”
Thank you for your patience and I hope you keep reading and enjoying what I have to offer!
Our conversation should have ended there. But not that night, I wrapped my arms around your waist and shuffled closer, pressing my nose into your boney back. You didn’t try to move away, which is how I knew you wanted this.
It wasn’t until two days later that I came home from work and found Sherlock lying on the sofa, wrapped in his dressing gown and blankly watching telly. I hung my coat up and said hello, to which he barely responded. I walked over to him and started carding my hands through his hair, I asked if he was alright. He didn’t stop me, and he didn’t answer either. I grabbed his curls gently (they are quite soft) and tugged to show that I wanted to sit with him. He’s my flatmate, yeah, but he’s also my best friend (
"Sorry to cut this short, I'm the Doctor, by the way, hello."
He wants to be mad at her for interrupting his moment with Sherlock, but he can't bring himself to do it. She doesn't know what's going on, she's only doing what she thinks is right. She only wants to help. He takes the phone from her and pats her head.
And now he was back. The stairway looked better, brighter and newer than when he moved in all those years ago. They stopped in the hallway for a moment. Sherlock crouched down, examining the new wallpaper as if it had secrets etched into it. John leaned against the wall and watched Sherlock, admiring the view of his rather gorgeous backside, and thinking just what the hell was Sherlock staring at!
John shook his head. This was ridiculous, he was talking to himself. He has officially lost it. He takes another swig of his drink and motions to sit up, finally opening his eyes.
John was a bit thrown off by the question.
I was suspicious, but I walked over to the door to save her trouble and to be polite. Once she made it to the hallway, she turned around and gave me a huge smile.
“My word…”
“Well, yeah, that stuff too but I think, for me at least, it’s because you protect things so vehemently. You go through all these lengths to protect things that are important to you, whether it’s a person or thing.”
I just stared at you. I was trying to figure you out, you tried to put on a front, but living with you for so long has taught me a few things. One of those things was how tell that you were lying. Nobody said anything; the only thing that could be heard was Kylie’s soft breathing, and the sound of Mrs. Hudson shuffling around downstairs. I was trying to say the words that I’ve thought up while you were out, but it seemed so much harder when you were right there in front of me.
I was at work when they called me, and because I missed so many days trying to boost the positivity in our home, I couldn’t afford to walk out early. I told them that I was busy at the moment, but as soon as I was able to, you and I would take a trip to the building to meet the mother of our child. I wish you’d kept your phone on.
“That’s her, “The Woman”. She is another long story, she’s actually part of the reason John and I…well that wasn’t till later. You see…I “died” for two years. My poor John, I didn’t mean to put him through that. “
But as soon as the clock struck five, I raced out of surgery, and made my way to Baker Street as fast as I could. You were already home, you looked like you were about to change into your house clothes, and I’m glad you didn’t. You would’ve gotten upset if I told you to throw your clothes back on again.
"Shall we get a move on then?"
“That’s right, Giraffe Lestrade as the best man. You would think that he would know my name after five plus years, right? Nope, he doesn’t.”
Sherlock was silent and John was ready to leave the topic alone before he heard him say, “It’s only ever a home when you’re here, John.”
John followed Watson down the stairs and into the living room. They ran over to the fireplace and John watched as Watson fiddled around with a skull on top of the mantelpiece and pulled a small black bottle out of its mouth. They made eye contact with each other and John said, "He has a skull?"
….Anyway, like everyone else, she dashed right over to the infant, who was snuggled in my arms. She cooed at first, and then fawned a bit, until she got it all out her system and was ready to talk to me. The brother she hasn’t seen for years.
“Try not to take it too hard, yeah?”
He waltzed into the flat, as Mrs. Hudson let him in. His eyes scanned the flat before they landed on you. I don't know how to describe it, Sherlock. When he saw you laying there, your head resting on the pillow, your face ruddy and pale, your tired eyes, his face was unreadable. He stared at you for a long time before either of you said anything to each other. I sat there in my chair with Kylie in my lap. I should have got up and went into the room, but I didn't move. I wanted to see how this went, and no, not because I got my rocks off, but because I needed to be there in case Mycroft was being a bit too pushy.
"That is, if you will allow me the satisfaction."
They both started laughing as John helped himself to his cooking. He was pretty satisfied with himself. He got Sherlock to eat, and praise his food. Today might be a good day.
You were a piece of work, love.
"Should I...should I get a job? I know your uncle Mycroft gives us money but...I won't if you don't want me to."
"How's she getting on, John? In school, is she making friends?"
‘I acquired those some weeks ago, John, I—.’
You looked like an angry cat soaked in water.
"Thank you, Doctor. Just, thirty minutes to an hour will be okay."
“We haven’t been up very long. I wanted to stop her crying before you woke up. I failed at that, it seems.”
It felt like home.
John grinned and pecked his cheek. “I wanted to have a proper date with you. I feel badly that our closest time to a date was when we watched movies together.”
There it was. You were still waiting for me to leave you. I told you time and time again, Sherlock, that I was in it for the long run and that I loved you more than I have loved anyone else in my whole life. I saw the tears prickling in your eyes. You really wanted me to answer that. You didn't want to feel like you were losing me because of the cancer. Oh, Sherlock...
Watson nodded.
“This isn’t witchcraft, no, not at all. This is a sonic screwdriver.”
Sometimes they were green, sometimes they were crystal clear. His eyes were what made him so unique, so devastatingly gorgeous. Just like him they were an enigma. John pressed a kiss to both eyes that were wet with salty tears. He wanted to wipe his pain away.
He made his way to Baker Street, he and Sherlock called it home, and then after a while, only Sherlock called it such a name. He stared at the building; it was definitely showing its age, like John himself. Walking inside on brought the feeling of nostalgia from decades ago. He saw images of him and Sherlock bouncing around the staircase, running back and forth, usually John trailed behind Sherlock, and walking up to Mrs. Hudson’s door to ask her for food or something to help with their case. He knocked on the former landlady’s door only to find a woman who was many years younger than the original owner. She looked similar to Mrs. Hudson, so obviously a relative. She smiled warmly at the sight of the ex-soldier.
"Fine with me." The Doctor smiled, and for the first time, John actually returned the smile. Sherlock was glad to see that they were getting along.
Lara shook her head.
“How long will it take to renovate?”
I rubbed my eyes and then stared at you, because I know you were going to say it again.
“Exactly, Holmes, they are what they are. They are engaged to be married, they shall be married soon. None of this troubles you even in the slightest?”
"And...were you in the army?" Watson almost stuttered.
“I was wondering if I can get away with this.”
"I'm the Doctor."
“No, you’re not. You’re
“Good afternoon, love.”
That night when John and Watson got back, John and Sherlock took dinner in their rooms. The soiled plates sat on the nightstand and the two men were sitting in their beds laughing their heads off.
“Sherlock. Shut up. I love you and I want to make you feel as good as you did for me. Will you let me?”
'I'm going to go bald, aren't I?' You loved your hair so much, sure you would make little comments about how stubborn it could be, but you loved each curl on that head, the curls are part of what made you...you. I knew how much you were hurting about this, I pulled into an embrace but I didn't stroke your curls, I didn't want to be the reason for more of them falling out. You asked me again if you were going to go bald, and I told you that I couldn't answer that, I didn't know.
He hears Sherlock say that to him in his head. If Sherlock thinks it could work, then maybe, just maybe it would.
Your smile faded at the question. You looked like you didn’t want to answer it, but because I asked, you had to.
“What happens then?”
The boys have more caboodling time!
“Wow Sherlock, he’s definitely a keeper.”
"I wouldn't have forgotten if Sherlock just opened his mouth a little more."
The Doctor popped his head out.
Sherlock scoffed, “What, finding a flatmate?”
"I am conflicted you see; it brings me pride, along with a sense of smugness, whenever I hear that someone takes interest in my work and considers coming to me when they are out of their depth, but it also irritates me. Watson has the bad habit of romanticizing my cases, as well as my actions. How he loves his embellishments."
Moriarty acted like a blushing schoolgirl as they falsely praised him. He was getting off on this. Standing in between the two, he began to speak.
John looked down and saw Kylie sobbing. She moved to get out of her chair but Sally grabbed her hand. She was trying to hug John.
After John walked out the room, only one thing crossed his mind.
“You have every right, Holmes. But we can do nothing about that, they will be husbands, they desire each other in a way that our society forbids us to. They can do what we can’t. They are happy, as we should be. I am tremendously overjoyed for the two, of course I wish to be in their place but such is the way of human nature, and as I said before, we all wish to be happier. So why not channel our happiness to them, give our support and show them that there is nothing that we want more than for them to be together and be happy for as long as they shall live? We share the same love they harbor for one another, let us think of that and only that. Being unhappy for them won’t change our roles at all, we’ll still be like this, and they’ll still be together. Tell me Holmes, where is the harm in that?”
“I think that I’ll go home after the wedding and give her a ring. I’ll take her up on that date.”
Holmes stood at the top of the stage, playing the violin with ease and precision that only one who has spent many years honing the necessary skills could do. Watson and The Doctor watched with the crowd as Sherlock and John waltzed around the floor, dancing with their body’s pressed up against each other’s. Sherlock knew that John couldn’t dance a waltz to save his life, so he spent a few days out of their planning to teach him the steps. With a little persuasion, John was a quick learner.
"Oh...well...it's actually...tomorrow."
'Easy, Sherlock, take it easy.'
I was silently hoping, praying that you didn’t see the tear trickle down my cheek. I couldn’t think about that again. I couldn’t. You were silent too; you soaked up all of that information and began processing it.
“I’ve got to get Kylie now. She’s with Mrs. Hudson. Her nursery school is not far from Baker Street. We don’t live there, anymore…I can’t…there’s too many memories and I can’t handle all of that at the moment. Mrs. Hudson, she picks her up and I stop off and get her. I should probably…get going, yeah?”
John smiled into her soft locks and inhaled the scent of her lavender shampoo.
Sherlock nodded petulantly.
"We have to look for them, Holmes. If these people are as dangerous as you say they are."
He turned back around to speak to Sherlock, but he was gone. John's smile wavered again at his disappearance. Why was he being teased like this? He was having a good night, and then he saw Sherlock again, but Sherlock was gone. Gone. Of course he was, John thought to himself, Sherlock isn't here. He was never one to believe in ghosts, or anything paranormal, but what if Sherlock was...
‘I’m sorry, Sherlock, but I have to.’
John smiled to himself. He was looking forward to seeing Sherlock again, he got worried when he didn't see him before.
“Very well.”
“No, go to work. I’m sorry if I’ve been getting you into trouble, I’ve been doing that a lot, haven’t I?”
“She’s the reason why we’re here.”
John took a step closer to Sherlock and placed a hand on his arm. “What is it, Sherlock?”
He flew to his dresser and pulled out his post-it notes, with his brand new Sharpie. He pulled the cap off and begun to scribble furiously on the small yellow paper.
“Well I guess you know that part. I didn’t think much of it at first, another person to look at; they all look so generic to me.”
I moved to open my mouth but then you cut in.
(See the end of the chapter for
Watson sucked his teeth.
Sherlock only graced him with yet another treasured smile, and resumed playing with the oblivious infant. John poured the tea into the mugs and whispered, “Please don’t take my sunshine away…”
“We’d like to thank you again for watching Rosie on such short notice.”
I was just about done explaining when you came out the room with your coat on ready to go. I moved to fetch mine, said my farewells to Molly and Kylie and left with you to go to the doctor's.
“I…I was…I wanted to know if we could, quite possibly, make it a third time?”
The Doctor's wide grin was plastered onto his face as he rubbed his hands together.
Sherlock's eyes were slowly closing and John stopped wiping the rag on his forehead and started to gently shake him.
John and Watson tried to save their Sherlocks from Moriarty's grasp but The Doctor shouted out, "Wait!"
“So what do you intend to do about it then?”
"I'm sorry but...you're a doctor too?"
“I think that the simple question would be how is it, being married to Sherlock?”
"Holmes?"
“After that comes married life, Doctor. Sherlock and I…we want to live our lives, and don’t get us wrong, we’re having a blast being with you, you know, what with Sherlock getting a concussion and us meeting…us.”
“Even though it killed me to see you with her, almost literally, I might add, nothing made me happier than to see you smile. And because I…care for you…a great deal…I let you go. I let you go be with someone who wasn’t dangerous, who wasn’t chasing down dangerous criminals, who couldn’t even take care of themselves properly, who couldn’t even make you happy….Someone who wasn’t me.”
Since Kylie was already sleeping, I took it upon myself to take her into the room; she would only sleep in my arms for so long before she got irritated. When I stood up, I felt older, more tired than usual. That wasn’t a normal thing for me, and I think it was partially because you acted the way you did. When I entered the room, you were fishing around in your draw, almost like you were careful not to alert me to anything, and I know you, love, I can tell when you tried to hide stuff from me. I saw the pile of clothes neatly folded next to you, so I knew that it wasn’t a fresh change of clothes you were looking for. I was curious, I might even go so far as to say that I had your level of curiosity; I wanted to know what you were doing.
"How does Kylie deal with it? With Sherlock's passing, I mean. She was so little when it happened, I doubt that she even remembers him at all."
“Love, listen, I know that as much as we want to believe that I’m enough for you…I’m not.”
"My, my, Sherlock. I didn't think it would be this easy to trap you."
like to be in 221B again.
Later that night, when they’re lying in the bed together, John plants a kiss on Kylie’s forehead and then her cheek. He nestles her closer to him and shuts his eyes. He has to fight, for her, if not himself.
Mrs. Hudson placed a hand atop Kylie's head and gave it a few strokes. "I wasn't sure how late you were going to be, so I made her dinner already. I had a bit of Sheperd's Pie left from the day before, and she complained about being hungry so I figured why not?"
"Holmes! Holmes! Are you alright?"
Sherlock pulled back into the kiss, this time softer and not as impatient before. His hands working their way to John’s shirt, unbuttoning with ease. John moved toward Sherlock’s belt, taking his time unlatching the hooks and pulling the belt from out of the loops. He dropped it to the floor and the metal of the buckle caused them to separate. John leaned his head so that their foreheads met, and the two closed their eyes as they breathed tender “I love yous”. In one fluid motion, Sherlock shed John of his shirt and the two watched as it softly touched the floor. John smiled and moved his hands to Sherlock’s thighs and worked him out of his pants and underwear. He paused, gazing upon his lover’s gorgeous body, the way his chest heaved, the black of his pupils, the perkiness of his pink nipples against his pale skin. John had never felt so blessed before. He chuckled and kissed Sherlock twice on his lips before removing his own clothes. Sherlock laid under him, his long legs wrapped around his waist, arms wrapped around his neck, eagerly waiting for John to make love to him. John pecked him on the lips and continued to pepper kisses down Sherlock’s long neck, stopping to suck on the especially sensitive parts of the detective’s throat. This earned him soft rumblings from within Sherlock, and low utterances of his name, John’s cock rising in response to his lover’s pleasure.
He wished that he could share her excitement.
"How do you do, John Watson?"
He was getting irritated.
“I don’t know, there can be all sorts of reasons, but I think that us being here might be one of the reasons for their showing up.”
The brunette smiled and then looked away for a moment.
John felt like an arse. Of course, she would think that, why wouldn't she? Why would she think that she was loved unconditionally from a father who only smiled when he talked about his dead husband? The guilt came at him full force, he stumbled a bit while he walked with her. He had to tell her, she had to know that he did love her, but he'll never get over Sherlock. She had to know that. He stopped in his tracks and knelt down. He positioned Kylie to face him and he waited to make sure that he had her attention.
I’m changing the subject now.
'Is Molly on her way?'
‘Why would you ask me something like that?’
“Doc…tor….”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked over to John, and then back up to Angelo.
“What?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"You're right, of course, you're right."
"Yes, we were! Why didn't you just tell me that it was you when I was calling your name through the door?"
“Yes, I do blog about cases. It’s like writing a journal about yourself, or what you think about something. In my case, I do the write-ups for Sherlock’s cases, after he solves them, naturally.”
“Tell me again.”
“Sherlock told me that too, after we had a row, except he called me his blogger.”
"Well, now this is a cause for something EXTRA special! We have to make this count, and nothing dangerous, though I can't promise you that, I can take you wherever you want? Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, The Roman Empire, a world populated by a large variety of aliens, where do you want to go, you lucky, lucky sods?"
John’s eyes met Sherlock’s and they both stared at each other smiling, Rosie the only one firmly attentive with the movie. John turned to the television and shoved another forkful of food in his mouth. “Or, you know maybe it’s because you’re just a hotheaded hoarder.”
Please continue to comment, kudos, and subscribe!
‘What’s her name?’ She asked.
"Sherlock."
“First, I would like to know…do you only want to be lovers with me?”
Sherlock’s mouth formed a tiny smile. “I love you too, John.”
“….God…I’m close…”
I raised my hands up and told you that that was new. You never volunteered to help with taking care of the baby, you still never held her. You didn’t know how to respond to that and started typing away again, determined to act like the whole conversation never happened. I looked at you for a while, and hearing Kylie’s screams get louder, I had no other choice but to let you. She was already a handful when she was upset, and it was always nice to have the other parent help once in a while. I shuffled to the room and heard you preparing the bottle for her. She had a pair of lungs on her. I scooped her up and tried to quiet her down, which wasn’t much, it was just bouncing up and down and shushing her. I was surprised that it worked, to be honest. I looked down at her to see if she was truly awake, and sure enough, she was. Her big eyes looking right up at me, they were still watery from her tears. I think I remember giving something of an awkward smile. Holding Kylie and realizing that she is my daughter, it’s not something I ever feel myself getting used to.
I heard what sounded like you laughing. It sounded like it hurt. You said something back to him, but your voice, it was almost too weak for my liking. I shut my eyes and pretended that maybe I was sleeping, that this was a kip that I’ve yet to wake up from again. That this had to be some sort of nightmare that I couldn’t wake up from. I had to be sleeping with you back at the flat, love. This wasn’t what our life had become!
Papa says that I can write to you, whenever I want to talk to you. So that’s what I’ll do.
When he heard her tiny voice say, "Papa?"
"Well, I'm here now, and we can go anywhere you want. Consider it a wedding gift, speaking of that, when is the lucky day?" The Doctor tried to bring the happy vibe back, before the oppressive and mournful air returned, and he has enough of that. Enough to last him centuries.
The news that we got...it wasn't what we were expecting. Maybe you had a virus, or some sort of stomach problem. But that's not what we heard.
Both the Holmes said, “You have two minutes.”
She shook her head.
Sherlock smirked.
"Oh yes please, we'll get going after I have more of those scrumptious bangers!"
“Where are the groceries?”
“Sherlock…”
Watson waved him off.
Sherlock smiled and nuzzled his nose onto her cheek.
I asked you what the problem was, because you weren’t moving or talking, you were just staring at me and as much as I loved it, there had to be a reason. I asked you again and this time, you just smiled and shook your head.
The look on your face, oh you tried so hard, Sherlock, but you couldn’t hide it, not that time. You were devastated. I didn’t know how else to react, Sherlock, so I did the only thing that I could and wrapped you in the tightest embrace I could muster. You didn’t respond to my touch, but I didn’t care, I just wanted you to know that I was there for you, always.
“Say it again.” John growled as he sucked on Sherlock’s nipple and played with the other.
"You hated the chemo so much, Sherlock. The first day we went to hospital to start your therapy, you were so upset. You crossed your arms and pouted for the whole cab ride. Even though, you didn't let me, I laid a hand on your thigh and gave it a squeeze. You weren't talking to me, but I had your attention. I told you that everything was going to be fine, this will only take a few hours, I said that we could go home and watch any movie you wished. I wasn't treating you as a child because you aren't a child. You were nervous, and you had every reason to be, chemotherapy wasn't easy. You were so brave, love, you didn't fight the nurse as she sat you in the chair and prepped you for the session. You looked at me and your eyes were big and they were scared, I might even go so far as to say that your lip trembled. I gave you a smile as I took your hand. There were several other people sitting in the same area as us, some of them looked about your age, like they just started, the others there...those were the ones I didn't want you to look at. You were eyeing this woman who was sitting adjacent to us. Her hair was already gone and her skin had a yellow tint to it. Her eyes were closed as she sat back in the chair. She didn't have much time left. You looked at me and I could tell you wanted to leave, Sherlock, you wanted me to stop the machine so that we could return home and cuddle on the sofa. I couldn't do that. I didn't enjoy watching you get pumped full of medicine that made you sicker than the actual cancer, I didn't enjoy watching you squirm around with your arm firmly placed on the rest. I didn't enjoy seeing you suffer.
Sherlock didn’t take very long to gather whatever it was he ran off to get. When they got to John’s home, he immediately set Rosie on the floor and watched as she attempted to crawl away from the men.
"We must make haste, Sherlock. Whoever has us hostage no doubt holds something dastardly for us."
“I fucked up, Sherlock. I fucked up so bad.”
~~~~~~~~~
“…You.”
Sherlock nodded, touched that John was so concerned about making him feel good. John smiled and then gently pushed Sherlock so that he was laying on the bed. He straddled Sherlock and continued to kiss his neck, and then made his way down to his chest. He relished the soft moans Sherlock made as he littered his body in soft kisses. John moved back to his mouth, and kissed him deeply, allowing for their tongues to intertwine. When he pulled away, he felt Sherlock’s growing hardness tickling around his bum. He smiled and started to stroke Sherlock’s hair.
“Heh, I don’t know. I was scared, I suppose.”
‘What’s the matter, John, have you forgotten how to sit?’ He remarked.
“Do as you wish, it is your wedding.”
“Let me guess, it has something to do with the time energy, yes?” Sherlock said.
“Alright, it’s okay. Finish, Sherlock.”
Holmes's face dropped and he frowned deeply.
“Yes, yes of course. Are you?”
Maybe he should respond to the comments. There are only five, and he doesn't have to reply in paragraphs. No, no, he knows that he won't do it. It'll be like a chore to him; he won't get around to doing it until he feels that it's absolutely necessary.
John intervened.
“No, shut up Sherlock, I won’t let you go out there alone. Not when there’s more of those Weeping Angels stalking about.”
The Doctor replied, "I'm not sure, just keep walking and I'm pretty sure we'll find something."
“Doctor!” Sherlock called again.
“Holmes and I decided that we should all go out, and enjoy the day we have been bestowed with, isn’t that right, Holmes?”
John could only offer a smile at present even though he knew that it didn’t do much to lift his friend’s spirits.
He looked to his right again and Sherlock was staring at him with the same eyes he gave him this morning.
“Certainly, now, if you’ll follow me.”
She keeps her cool composure.
Sherlock nearly fainted there. Even Holmes had a reaction to the name.
“St. Barts Hospital?”
“I should have known that even the Teletubbies would not hold your attention forever.” He smirked at the idea of finally being able to miss an episode of the terrifying show.
“And your home would be….?”
John’s eyes widened and he feigned excitement over her teeth falling out. She was of age now, all her baby teeth were going to fall out.
"No, I can handle it, I was in the bloody army. I would like to get to know you better...uh...John..."
"Not now, Sherlock..." He mutters.
"If you think they're dirty, why don't you just toss them in the rubbish bin?"
Whatever Sherlock wanted to say in response died in his throat. He only shook his head and chuckled. “You know me best, I trust you.”
You looked at me, and then finally your hand rose and I slid the picture into it. You stared at it for a long while, inspecting every element of it, but then you passed it back to me without a word. You didn’t need to tell me, I know you, and you were just as happy as I was. Susanne watched us with slight glee. At least she knew how bad we wanted it. She looked down at her watch and then started to get up.
“I said we’re here, sir.”
Their brows rose.
You looked somewhat hurt when I said that.
“Sherlock please?”
"Yes Doctor, I am. And I'm going to give this to him and we're going to enjoy the morning alone, do you understand me?"
Sherlock leaned forward.
“Have you ever had the pleasure of falling in love, Holmes?”
"You're not really there, are you?"
Kylie was gone.
Sherlock snorted and slid his jacket on. John was waiting for him at the door.
“You are correct.”
~~~~~~~~
“You don’t have to say anything right now, I just wanted to tell you that before I scared myself into never telling you, like so many other things I’ve been meaning to say but never have…”
"She's telling the truth, Kylie. There's no need to hide."
….Where were you, Sherlock? Where you when I was in the living room with them?  Were you in the shower, or were in the room taking a nap? I’d like to think that you took all of those naps because you were trying to take better care of yourself, but the doctor in me knew that it was because of the cancer. The appointment was soon, I had hope, and for a brief moment, you had hope too. I didn’t see any more of those searches on your laptop, or maybe you didn’t let me see them.
‘What changes?’ I interjected harshly.
Sherlock was already flashing him the puppy eyes. The Doctor sighed in defeat. He has no choice now.
'Of course I will.' I half responded to the doctor, but I was talking to you mainly, because you were the one that mattered. You shifted a bit so that you were almost sitting up. It looked like you tired yourself out just by doing that.
Sherlock stood up and shrugged, “You’re not the problem, John.”
I am determined to finish this fic, it's not right to the people that read it that I leave it incomplete. I fall out of the mood to write this and then get filled with the energy to write a chapter so please bear with me.
That was your way of begging me to sleep with you, and you know that I wanted to.
"Take it easy, my dear Watson, you've asked enough questions for the day, it's my turn now."
"Those brutes!" He muttered to himself.
"What's Schmarka?"
And then the sound of his feet making contact with the old wooden stairs. Holmes rose from his chair with a heavy feeling in his chest, and stumbled into his room. He locked his door and then made his way to a loose floorboard behind the bed. Inside there was a box, a tiny black box. He sat on his bed Indian –style and opened it. There it was, his trusty friend. The small bottle of cocaine he had, as well as the syringe used to administer it into Holmes’s body. He filled the syringe carefully and waited until Watson’s steps halted to apply it to himself.
“I did.” John then thought back to the context in which he said it and then immediately he felt like an ass, maybe they weren’t back to that level of joking yet, he overstepped his boundaries, he fucked up, he fucked up bad… “I’m not great, John.”
Watson's eyes widened.
‘Okay.’ Was all you could say to me.
‘My brother, he wouldn’t have been pleased to see me, I’m sure.’ He wanted me to find some sort of pity in that statement. But it aggravated me more.
Please comment!
and it was tiring and irritating. His restless sleep, coupled with taking care of Rosie at night, he hadn’t sleep in four days, save for the catnaps he would take when the baby was napping. And it showed. It showed whenever he would snap at John for minor things like the tea being too hot, and he hated himself every time he did it. He apologized immediately after, and John would look at him with a face that read nothing but sympathy, and he hated himself for that. He shouldn’t be acting this way, he had been okay for so long living with John, and now to him the days were just…plain boring.
They sang to Sherlock, no matter how much he hated it, John smeared some cake frosting on Sherlock's nose, much to his secret enjoyment. Even though he acted like he didn't like the party, he was secretly pleased. John and The Doctor could see that. The party ended after two and a half hours, with a slightly tipsy Mrs. Hudson, a bubbly Molly, and Lestrade in a better mood than earlier. The Doctor said goodbye as well, promising that he'll have to take them on a real adventure soon, since they were his honorary companions. All that was left was Sherlock and John. John was cleaning up the aftermath of the party, while Sherlock was sipping away on a cup of soda. He rarely drank the stuff, but it was a special occasion.
“Anyway, what I’m trying to say is. You made me feel good about myself. And I hadn’t realized until then how good it feels to be….”
"Since there are already two angels facing each other, all John and I have to do is duck! Think you can handle it?"
"Last one for tonight. Sorry mate, gotta pay the bills somehow, and I'm not about to lose this job so that you can get pissed."
Lestrade, he didn’t realize how old he was getting until he got shot by a criminal he was after. He was in a coma for a while, but they pulled the plug because he was a husk, and it seemed merciful.
“You don’t understand, John. Everything I have ever done since the wedding was to make you happy and to make sure you were still safe. I wanted you to have a happy marriage and to live a long happy life, even if I wasn’t the one you chose to spend it with.”
“But The Doctor has seen something like this before, he was the one who helped us get away, as well as provide us with the information on the peculiar statue.”
“There is no risk because nothing is going to touch him, do you understand me? If they think they can mess with my Sherlock then there will be hell to pay.”
“Through what?”
“Well done, though, if I may say so myself, Doctor, you cheated.”
“Harry, what are you doing with that?” John questioned.
"Why can't you come, John?" Sherlock asked childishly.
"How is he?"
Sherlock nodded.
"Yes, yes you both look ravishing now let's go, I want to get out of here as quickly as possible..."
“Don’t try to butter me up, John. I know that me participating in this will only result in humiliation, hell, they probably did all of this to play some sort of cruel trick on me. People like you, John, and you chat up the officers while we’re there, they’ll get you a nice gift. Maybe a watch since yours stopped working, or a tie since you like to wear those to work. They might even get you a jumper worth more than their paycheck because you’re you, John Watson!”
They both laughed a little louder, and John kissed him again.
Sherlock huffed and started to stroke Rosie’s hair. “Yes.”
Mycroft's mouth flickered into the faintest of smiles.
With a soft chuckle, you shook your head.
'You have made your point clear, John. I need to go the hospital, this I can not evade anymore. However, I can stop anybody that I don't want coming to see me, and I will. I do not anybody else, save for you, to see me as I deteriorate in the hospital bed. Let me have this much, at least.'
“You can check the cabinets if you like.”
“My memory is a bit funny?”
'Kylie. Kylie Holmes-Watson.'
You eventually walked into the room with the bottle in your hand. Not to my surprise, it was warm and looked a lot better than what I would have done. You looked somewhat surprised with yourself too. I took it, and gave you a quick thank you before positioning Kylie to feed her. You gave a quick twitch of the corner of your mouth and then walked out of the room almost as quickly as you entered. I let it slide that time and focused my attention on Kylie.
He was disappointed when the doorbell rang. He nearly wished that he didn’t order food and scrounged something up in the kitchen, he didn’t want to get up and leave Sherlock’s presence. He placed Rosie on the sofa in place of his absence and walked to the door. While he was discussing the prices with the delivery man, he heard Sherlock’s gentle voice talking to Rosie.
Sherlock's tone was so much softer than he was used to. The little curly-haired boy looked up at him, eyes red and puffy from all the crying.
I had to consider your bargain. You agreed to go to hospital, which was the whole point of our fight, but in exchange, you didn't want any of our friends to visit you at all. It would only be Kylie and I, and Mycroft, even if you wanted him there or not.
"So are you ready?"
‘From the time we spent with her at the hospital, she doesn’t seem to be much of a crier.’
John closed his eyes, he forgot. The Doctor hasn't seen Sherlock since he was a child, before he was exposed to the drugs that took over his life as a teen and into his early adult life, he couldn't have known. He gave the Doctor a good stare before he came to the decision to tell him why he had the doubts in the first place.
“Anytime.”
, must be the truth.”
“I suppose I could not get much sleep last night.”
What would she know? She never met Sherlock anyway. He could show her all the home videos, and show her all of the photos, but it wouldn't be the same of knowing him. She wasn't old enough to experience the full effect of living with Sherlock Holmes, of loving him. John did, on the other hand. He envied Kylie slightly for that. She doesn't have to go through this. The pain of waking up empty inside, she doesn't have to deal with the exhaustion of trying to get out of bed in the morning, and putting a fake smile on her face just so people wouldn't ask her what's wrong. He knew that they knew, but they tried to show him sympathy, and John would clench his teeth because it was all of the people who couldn't stand Sherlock when he was alive. Kylie doesn't know about any of that because she doesn't have to go through it.
John Watson could.
-------
Sherlock didn't respond, he just watched as John stumbled his way down the hall to his room and already found Kylie snuggled in the duvet, sleeping soundly. John stared at her for, however long, he did not know. He sat down on his side of the bed and slid his shoes off. He didn't change into his pajamas because the alcohol was starting to make him drowsy. He just wanted to sleep, he wanted to lay down and just sleep. Kylie had her back turned to him, he wasn't going to bother her, she needed the sleep, she had school in the morning. He stared up at the ceiling, but then he felt the room spinning and so he closed his eyes and let sleep take him.
'Sherlock, hush.' I interrupted, 'Neither of us knew that this would happen, I wasn't going to think of that because I didn't need you to worry about it more than you already were. Do I know that surgery doesn't go great all the time? Yeah, of course, I do, and so do you.' I saw your eyes piercing right through mine, but I kept talking. ' I told myself that I was going to stick by you no matter what happens, and here I am, sticking by you.' I paused briefly so that I can take your hand. It was clammy, but I didn't mind.
"It's you, actually you. My husband who...who...it's you."
Your first two drawers were clean, miscellaneous things that I’ve told you to throw out time and time again, but you refused and said that they could prove useful one day. Evidently, they weren’t. It wasn’t until I found the third drawer on your nightstand. I hesitated to open it, I felt my gut instinct telling me that it was wrong to invade your privacy in a way, but something was telling me, in the back of my mind to open it, and sure enough, I did.
"John, there’s something ... I should say; I-I’ve meant to say always and then never have. Since it’s unlikely we’ll ever meet again, I might as well say it now."
‘We’ll do it, doctor. All we need to do is schedule a time and day and that should be good enough.’
“Mhm, sure will. Takeaway tonight? I was going to stop at the shops but Rosie’s not well…”
"Apparently, we're in London, 1890.""
Moriarty’s grin turned sour.
“You were so great love, and you’re so beautiful.”
"What about y--, the other one, Watson? What did he say?"
'I understand, John.' The words were simple, but they held so much meaning for you and me. I kissed you again and then walked over to the other side of the bed, you knew what I was doing and so you moved over so that I could have room to lie with you. It was still fairly early outside, the sun was just about to set and you were already sleeping because of the medicine that you were given and also, the fact that you were ill. I didn't fall asleep until much later that night. I was thinking about everything, you would have to have chemotherapy, if your cancer was aggressive enough. You wouldn't be able to go on cases anymore, you would have to be stuck solving cases via files, I would need help from the others so that I could take care of Kylie and you. I knew how unhappy you would be, but I was prepared to help you through it. The last thing, I remember doing, was placing a gentle kiss on your clammy forehead and then closed my eyes. The scent of your hair filled my nostrils that night. A smell that I ache for now, Sherlock..."
“No, no.” Sherlock chuckled softly and shook his head as he wiped away the tears. John looked confused at what he wanted. Sherlock took John’s hands off his face and pressed a small, wet kiss to his knuckles.
“Spot on detective!” The Doctor said enthusiastically.
"W-what is that? Doctor what are you doing?"
John kissed her head.
Holmes looked down. He felt a twinge of hurt in his chest. These two can have each other however they pleased.
Holmes’s face was sullen.
"Nothing, Molly. Ignore me."
It made Sherlock’s heart warm to see that John was finally starting to become more confident after their talk, it also excited him because he had so much more to say to John. That man deserved to be showered in love the same way he did Sherlock. They lay in bed and he saw John strip himself of his shirt and lay down beside him. Sherlock rolled over so that his head was resting on John’s unbelievably soft chest, and his hand was on top of his stomach. He closed his eyes and inhaled John’s scent. Like mint and lavender. Sherlock smirked, he was using his soap.
John’s lip quivered and he shook his head. He kissed Sherlock again, pulled away, and then kissed him again.
“Alright, let’s see the news of today, shall we?” Watson muttered to himself as he flipped open the newspaper.
He ignored the way Sally and Greg shuffled uncomfortably in their chairs. Mycroft stopped talking and simply stared at the father and daughter sat in front of him. He sniffed and then spoke again.
“Let’s see, what job do you have?”
"So what, that's it?"
“Yes they do, Watson. But I need to find the reason they’re here.”
What an odd choice of words.
'Oh.' That was all he said before he stared into space. The flat was silent. Then he snapped out of it and started fiddling with his umbrella. He took a few deep breaths and then gave his usual wry smile.
Holmes and Watson were standing next to The Doctor, clapping as if their lives depended on it once they were officially considered married.
Sherlock nodded, unable to speak as John’s fingers felt too good for words. John was staring at him with such loving eyes that he could hardly stand it. He called him beautiful, he called him love, his cheeks were flushed from being called such sweet things by the man of his dreams.
"You wouldn't know, you haven't seen him since he was a kid."
He gingerly walked over to his side of the bed and sat down. He turned so that the food or the tea would fall and set it down in front of Sherlock's face. John's hand went to Sherlock's face and gently rubbed it with the pad of his thumb.
"And that's all you remember?"
...I just made myself laugh...can't remember the last time I did that.
Watson scoffed.
When John thought he wasn’t looking, Sherlock spotted the lonely tear roll down his cheek and frown. This man deserved all the love in the world.
The next morning, John awoke feeling all kinds of sore. He did his morning stretches and then got off the uncomfortable bed. He remembered everything from last night. He looked over and saw Sherlock still sleeping. He walked over to his fiance and ran a hand through his curls before giving him a kiss on his forehead. He gave Sherlock a small smile and left the room. The ground floor of the building was busy with the housekeepers and maids running from room-to-room with all types of stuff in their hands. John still thought that Mrs. Hudson could out clean all of them. One of the younger maids stopped where she was and gave a curtsy.
‘Don’t mind him,’ I interrupted, ‘He’s not the most sociable of people so we’ll be the ones talking today.’
As much as I love, you, Sherlock, you could never read emotions that well. Either that or you just didn’t care about them as much, which I know isn’t true at all. You thought that you were above all emotion, when you did nothing but feel.
“I watched you walk down the aisle with somebody who wasn’t me.”
John’s smile faded completely.
‘Want me to join you?’ That’s the only thing I could think to say. Of course you would say no.
No more. No fucking more. He was not going to take out his anger on her. He was not going to do that to her because she was sweet and kind and blessedly innocent. She was his little girl.
“It’s in there…. oh god…. hurry….”
"Did he now?"
“Love, John. I like it when you call me love.”  Sherlock’s voice was so gentle, he sounded like a child. John’s breath hitched in his throat.
“That’s alright, love. We can always make new memories here.”
That seemed to ease you because you lessened your grip and let your arm sink. I remember us staring at each other. Your eyes were watery and sagged, because of the drowsiness. Your mouth was slightly opened. You gave a weak smile and I returned one. I stroked your cheek and turned in my chair so that I could face you better. I was tired to hell, at that point, Sherlock, I resisted the urge to close my eyes and sleep right there.
I thought that I might give Molly a ring, to check up on Kylie, to take my mind off of everything. I pulled my mobile out of my pocket and started dialing her number. She picked up rather quickly. She sounded busy, and I thought I heard crying in the distance. Molly spoke quickly and it was something along the lines of ‘Sorry John, I can’t talk now, Kylie’s starving and I can’t find her bottle.’ That was cut short. I was moving to put my mobile away when I got a call from a blocked number. Normally, I would just let it ring, but I had a hunch and so I answered. As I suspected, your brother was on the other line.
“Actually, quite the opposite.”
“John, I would prefer it if you don’t say anything about any of my mishaps.”
"What are you doing here, Doctor?"
"She's growing every day."
“Earlier today, when I kissed you, it was unwarranted and selfish of me.”
Greg was pretty miffed too, but he kept quiet. He just folded his arms and glared at me while the two women, and the baby, tore my head off. I think Kylie was only shouting because everybody was doing it too. I held my hand up in the air to halt their yelling and tried to explain without throwing you under the bus and making myself sound like an arse. It was quite possibly one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do.
John was mentally screaming. His eyes flashed over to the Doctor, who was giving him the same look, and then back at the two men who not only shared the same last name as Sherlock and himself, but also live in the same exact flat!
"S-Sherlock..."
"I was getting a cup of water when your phone started buzzing. I thought that you would want it."
Sherlock gave a nod and then made his way to the porch. He made sure John was standing behind him when he opened the door and then he let John enter first. The inside made John want to curl up on the floor and fall asleep. It was nice and warm and so very inviting now that the owner was in it. The fire was just put out; he could hear the crackling of the burnt wood and smell the scent of fire. He watched as Sherlock emerged from the kitchen and took a seat in his chair. He motioned for John to take his seat. John was so happy to be reunited that he almost didn’t notice that he took a seat in his old armchair. Sherlock kept it all of these years. He was facing Sherlock now. Sherlock never got rid of the chair, he probably moved it himself because he didn’t trust the movers to handle with the care he had for it. John saw the imprints of his hands on the arms, from all the past times he sat down in it. He left it how John touched it, never mind the nights he slept in it, like Lauren said. It was the only thing of John’s that he had. That he could remember him by. Just like that, the air was heavy and John tried everything to not openly weep in front of the man he’s wanted for so long.
‘John!’ Mrs. Hudson’s voice called to me. She marched over to me, as well as Greg and Molly with Kylie in her arms, sleeping. I think she forgot the carrier at home. They knew that you were back in the hospital, I told them that much, but not of your request. I gulped as they all marched over to me. I figured that I had about three minutes to calm them down before I ended up lying in a hospital bed next to you.
“You’re spot-on with that analysis, John.” Sherlock joked. Could he not make this any harder than it had to be? Could not be so…so Sherlock? No, no, if he had to stop being Sherlock, then this wedding wouldn’t even be happening. He took another deep breath.
John inhaled.
“But you tend to mix it up, you call me ‘bee’ sometimes, ‘love’ is your favorite term of endearment for me. And ‘honey’ when you’re so inclined.”
Sherlock looked up at him with glistening cheeks and gave a shaky smile.
'I said’, you stated with a hint of annoyance,
“I’m sorry Doctor, something got in my eye.” John responded as if he were back in boot camp being chewed out by his drill sergeant once again.
Sherlock propped his head up, his blush lessened so that his cheeks looked relatively normal. His elbow rested underneath his head and his other arm now wrapped around Rosie’s tiny body. He stared at John and yes, it was true that he loved Sherlock like he’s never loved before. But does John truly know the extent of how much John was loved and needed? He waited for the conversation to die away. John hadn’t said anything, and Sherlock was waiting for John to say something. Sherlock closed his eyes and sighed. Oh John…
Holmes had something that resembled a smile as he gave a curt nod.
‘I won’t be gone long, with the way the case is set up; I don’t think it’ll last for more than a few hours.’
Holmes gave a laugh and ushered Watson to the chair he was previously sitting in and set him down.
Moriarty smirked.
‘You know he’s sick, yes? You wouldn’t be here otherwise.’ I cut right to the chase. I didn’t have time for the riddles. He looked away from me, and twirled his umbrella around before he found the words to speak to me. He nodded; it looked like it hurt him to do such a menial thing.
"Like you said, we have a lot of catching up to do."
Molly wipes away the tears that are drying on her face. She glances over at the little girl who looks like she's having the time of her life. She smiles to herself. John looks on with a blank stare. Why did he agree to come out with her? He knew that this was going to end up being about Sherlock. She loved him, and they hadn't talked for so long.
Watson didn’t reply there wasn’t much need to. The Doctor found his way into their conversation.
A crooked smile crept on the man's lips.
“John…” Sherlock chokes as he starts to sob on the cold metal. He doesn’t notice that the robot has a bit of oil running out of its eye as the gun pops out of its wrist.
John dismissed Sherlock’s statement.
I had my gun ready, no one was going to hurt you, Sherlock. No one. I heard one of them whisper something along the lines of a curse, and then the shuffling of feet, I looked at you and we knew exactly what we had to do next.
I couldn’t hear all of the conversation, mind you. He did leave the door cracked, so I listened in for a bit. Sorry, Sherlock.
He responded with a nod and watched as John marched out of the room. He picked up where John left off, he started rubbing Sherlock's back  and tried to place him in a more comfortable position.
“At least one version of us got what they wanted in the end.”
'You understand that if we’re going to be bringing a baby into this flat, you are going to either stop experimenting, or find somewhere else to do it that isn’t here.'
Sherlock's breathing was frantic, but as soon as he felt Holmes's hands on his shoulders, he started to settle down and stopped fidgeting around in his chair. Holmes didn't even get the rope off of his wrists yet because he started fighting to get out. As Sherlock's head turned up to meet Holmes's eyes, he breathed out, "Where am I? What happened?"
‘Do these surgeries often work?’ You were getting nervous again. You were over-thinking, always over-thinking.
Sherlock smiled softly.
"It just got so hard after....after everything, Sherlock."
Kylie started tugging on John’s sleeve.
Sherlock slept for the rest of the night. John woke up to the sound of his daughter crying, his new alarm clock. His eyes were crusty from the unwiped tears he shed with Sherlock. God, he never thought that he would be able to say all of that to Sherlock. Those words wrapped around his throat and choked him each time the thought popped in his mind. He meant every word of it, every tear. It was Sherlock who never judged him for wanting physical attention. It was Sherlock who let him wear his jumpers without calling him any names other than “Gorgeous” “Dashing” “Clever”. It was Sherlock who lets him cry without calling him a sissy, who lets him be as soft and gentle as his heart always wished to be.
Sherlock begged him, therefore, he had to go.
John's brows furrowed as he retreated with Watson.
"Come on! Don't be shy!"
“And may I ask why?”
Watson stood up and took his hat and jacket off as he had no use for it anymore now that he was indoors. With his jacket draped over his arm and his hat placed in the crevice of it, he walked over to Holmes.
"She's the only reason why I'm still...here..."
Sherlock, I appreciate you trying to do this, I really do. It’s nice to know you actually pay attention to me.’
Showtime.
‘Since your husband is here, I’m assuming you told him about your visits here?’
John shook his head, not bothering to stop the tears that were dripping into his mouth.
for him. When he first came to stay, he didn’t mention it for fear of upsetting or embarrassing John in some way. He was the guest and it wasn’t his right to tell John that his living room sucked. But it wasn’t all bad, Sherlock thought. John had always been his home. Baker Street was his home as well, but it wasn’t complete without John. The nights where they curled up and watched all of John’s favorite movies, that had been like old times and if Sherlock tried hard enough, he could imagine them back in their flat smiling and laughing just as they were.
“I believe that she is brilliant and extraordinary. Maybe her first word will be genius.”
Sherlock didn’t respond. His eyebrows burrowed and John said, “Chicken and rice.”
Sherlock was in too good a mood to let Mycroft get to him. With a louder laugh, he turned around to face his brother.
"Surprised to see me?"
John shot out of his chair, which prompted Sally and Greg to as well.
"What was that John?"
“Don’t you think Bilbo looks like your father?” Rosie mumbled something unintelligible which made Sherlock laugh. John resumed paying for the food, and it wasn’t until after he closed the door that he heard Sherlock say, “I think he’s quite handsome.”
Sherlock crossed his arms. “So, are we going to pretend this didn’t happen? That I didn’t scream the whole house awake?”
‘We would like that very much.’
'I'm adamant,' I began, 'Because I want you to get the proper medical treatment, Sherlock. I can't keep taking you to chemo just to have you come back here and puke up the small amount of food that you're able to keep in your stomach! Look at your options, Sherlock, use that brain that you were blessed with! If you keep this ritual up for much longer, you'll...'
"I'm sorry Mrs. H, but I'm trying to make Sherlock breakfast in bed."
The older version of Sherlock tried his best to hold back the tears, he remembered all the pain and suffering too clearly. He wished that he had found John sooner, maybe he wouldn't have turned to the drugs, or tried to kill himself by overdosing so many times. Things could have been different, so much more different. But he has John now, and that's what matters.
Holmes and Watson staggered back at the name.
John was stuck in a stammer on his first word.
"I think you're right. Too bad I'm not looking for a relationship."
“You think it’s a date?”
"It's...bigger..."
"John!"
Sherlock pointed at one of the mausoleums.
'Come on, love,' I sighed, 'I'm nearly finished. I'll leave you alone soon after.'
Holmes brought his hands to his mouth as he leant in to understand what Watson was talking about.
you. I want you to understand the depths to which I love you. I’ll love you when you’re happy, I’ll love you when you’re sad. I’ll love you even when you think I don’t, and I hope you don’t believe that. I know that you’re hurting right now, and I promise I’ll let you sleep in a moment, but please…
John didn’t stop there. He grabbed Sherlock’s arm and peppered soft kisses along it. Sherlock closed his eyes. He put Sherlock’s arm down and moved to Sherlock’s face. He shoved his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth, and had to pull away to breathe. Sherlock’s eyes opened and he stared into John’s eyes.
“I should think myself flattered?”
John laughed.
Immediately, John's heart skipped a beat. Where were they all coming from? From the corner of his eye, he could see Watson locked in his own silent staring contest with the angel that came out of the room adjacent from the one Sherlock and Holmes have been held captive in.
“I thought you loved her. The fifty-seven texts…the fact that she was in your bed…your reaction to her death…”
John let Watson pull his head down to examine him fuller.
Enjoy!
“Tell me, how it is living with John, your John. Is it any different?”
‘Is that how it was when I was gone?’
He clenches the glass, he almost breaks it. The thought of Sherlock's skin, so gentle, so pale and iridescent. The way it felt in John's hands, the feeling of it pressed against John's body. It made him happy at first, but then he remembered, the absence of it. The cold feeling of knowing that he'll never feel it again, never be able to see it unless he was staring at a picture, or watching an old video. His mind wanders to the last moments he had with Sherlock, at Barts. The way Sherlock's eyes sagged in, and those lips that he loved so much, twisted into a frown of pain and melancholy, the curls that Sherlock spent so much time on, thinning and dry. That wasn't Sherlock Holmes-Watson lying in that hospital cot. That wasn't his husband. That wasn't the genius that everybody loved. He specifically told John not to remember him like that, as that, husk that slowly withered away. He told John to remember him as the person he was before, as the man he fell in love with. John promised him only because Sherlock asked him to. John would do anything Sherlock asked him to.
John smirked and took another sip of his coffee. “Yeah.”
John wasn't surprised when Kylie looked like she wasn't buying it. He sighed, he was always rubbish at things like this, thank god Sherlock was even worse.
“What can I say? Not everybody has the opportunity to date and get engaged to the world’s only Consulting Detective. I should count myself lucky.”
There was a slight chuckle in John's voice and his arms squeezed Sherlock gently.
His body jerked. Good, he was getting to him.
John grabbed Sherlock’s face. “Mrs. Hudson is on her way, when she gets here, we can leave.”
I laughed and kissed your cheek bone.
John’s brows furrowed. “And why not?”
'Yeah, of course you will.'
John comes home to find out about the hilarious day Sherlock had.
~~~~~~~~~
“How proud?”
John's brows rose.
Immediately, he began to grind the rope tied around his arms that were no doubt covered in burns from rubbing against the rough material against the chip. It would take time but he would still be free in the end. He found himself concentrating on nothing else besides Sherlock's wellbeing. He could feel the determined beads of sweat form on his forehead, and the wetness of the tip of his tongue as he tried to break free of the rope that bound him. Obviously the person who tied this knew a great deal about knots and the like.
She found that funny.
‘What? Are they still here, did they leave?’ You were sort of talking to me, and sort of talking to yourself. I nodded, just in case you were talking to me. I told you that the nurse wouldn’t let them in because I told her that they were not permitted to see you.
“And you would know, wouldn’t you, Sherlock? You have dealt with me before, yes?”
“What about Rosie?”
His daydreaming was put to an end when Sherlock made his way into the flat. He looked a bit green and his clothes were disheveled. His curls were out of place, but not enough to be noticed by anybody else. His eyes were still lidded, telling Holmes that he was just waking up or recovering from previous events. His body posture showed that he still wasn’t fully recovered, but healed enough to move on his own. He made his way to the couch, with a bit of staggering, and took his seat. He sat like he was expecting something. Ah, he came from a wealthy family, old money, no doubt, much like Holmes himself. He stared intently at Sherlock, watched as he examined the flat carefully. He was deducing. Good boy. Holmes was noting the physical differences between them, of which were many. He wasn’t even going to get started on Sherlock’s hair, or his cheekbones that looked so sharp that somebody could risk cutting their hand open if they smacked him. His eyes reminded Holmes of a cat’s, almond-shaped, piercing, enchanting, cold.
"Watch where you're going next time, yeah?" John stated to the stranger angrily.
The stranger shook his head.
I removed your shirt and then began to remove your pants because you wouldn’t need them for a while. I think that this was the first time we made love since before we had Kylie. I wanted to savor this moment because who knew when we would get to do this again? Pretty soon we were both naked and loving every moment of it. You rolled over and turned back so that I knew you were ready. I adjusted myself and then I moved into you. Each thrust was pleasure-filled and both of us loved it, I got to hear the soft moans that came from your mouth with each push, you sounded so soft, so gentle. That night was perfect, it was slow and sweet, probably one of the tenderest shags we’ve ever had. I wanted to remember you as you were, your curls, a bit damp from the sweat, you were lying on your stomach with the sheet draped over your bum perfectly. You were beautiful, Sherlock, god I was so lucky. I lay back down, this time on my side because I wanted to look at you and push the curls from your face as you slept. I gave you a quick kiss on the lips and moved you closer to me so that I could hold you and inhale your scent and remember that night forever.
‘Go on then. Explain this bottle that I’m holding in my hand”, I snarked, “Tell me why I’m holding a bottle for depression prescribed to Sherlock Holmes-Watson.”
“I bought them for you, love. I thought, if maybe there was just a bit more color in this flat you’d…maybe you’d cheer up.”
Sherlock looked confused.
Sherlock’s breath was as soft as his curls that tickled John’s neck. John placed a hand on his lap and closed his eyes at the warmth exuded by his love’s own. He pressed his lips into his hair and then turned his head to rest his cheek on it.
"This man is clever, very, very clever. In both of these rooms, the ones that we passed in this corridor have Weeping Angels in them."
He didn't give Sherlock time to answer, not like he was going to anyway. John sniffed and then got up and made his way over to the whiskey bottle to refill his glass. Sherlock didn't budge from his spot while John was talking.
“But why are they here, Doctor?”  John asked, “Were they always here, or did they find us?”
“It’s nice to know that we’re needed.”
Dear god above, what a perfect thing it was. Plump, firm, it made John salivate just thinking about it. He wanted to do more with Sherlock last night, but the poor man had never had sex before and he didn’t want to scare him from the act altogether. That was the thing with Sherlock, you couldn’t rush things, it all had to be slow, it had to progress in stages.
“What is it now?!”
I was going to ask you but I wanted to enjoy the moment of our new baby.
He heard his voice and his tears came out harder. Not now, Sherlock, not when he was like this.
“You have never answered my question, John. I inquired about your marital status.”
“I…John….”
“What about you and Holmes?”
“You know I find it difficult, this sort of stuff…”
"But today, on the TARDIS..."
John never saw the twinge of frustration whenever he mentioned Sherlock or even spoke about a case.
“Yes we know, marriage, sacred, holy, can we…I don’t know, skip past all of this?”
John turned to Watson since Holmes was too far ahead to hear him.
Sherlock winced and looked away again.
Sherlock wiped a tear away and exhaled. “Knowing Mycroft, he’ll have the top contractors in England come to fix the place up. Even then…everything is…everything is…it’s just gone, John. My chemistry set, my music, my chair. How can they replace that?”
‘Because a world without you in it is a world I don’t want to live in.’
"That is true. Would you like to tell us?"
But if I knew what lie in store for us, I wouldn’t have been happy for long…”
‘It’s alright, John. I can handle it from here.’ You reassured me. I didn’t let my guard down until I saw the bathroom door close. It looked like it hurt you to walk. Judging by the area on your body where they operated on, and the painkillers they prescribed for you, I would say that you were pretty sore, Sherlock. You didn’t come out of the bathroom until a good ten, twenty minutes later. I really loved the way you looked in that purple shirt, Sherlock. I mean good lord, it was the tightest shirt you owned and it just looked so…so good. You were in your usual posh, ‘look at how smart I am’ stance, but you looked pale and like you needed to sleep.
‘She wasn’t raped, by any chance?’
“If I wanted another flat I would have just told Mycroft to buy me another one. This flat is special to me because it was my first time living with somebody else, let alone somebody who liked me of their own accord and who actively looked forward to staying with me. There were others that came seeking a flatmate, but I made the mistake of opening my mouth and there they went. You
"Look, I know that you haven't been having the best time of your life right now, not since Sherlock...since Sherlock passed. I understand that you miss him, and you have every right to, hell, I miss him!"
Holmes shook his head.
Sherlock's eyes started shining.
John was laughing and fighting off Sherlock’s deft hits. He had to get used to dodging them since they were living together.
Sherlock heard John yawn. He raised his head to look at Sherlock. His eyes were still glassy from sleep, and his smile lopsided but so warm and compassionate that Sherlock thought he would cry all over again.
He looked over at the once fluffy bee and sighed. It was a gift for her and this was how she treated it. He placed her on his lap and watched the children’s show. He let her grab his ring finger and briefly, Sherlock imagined a gold band on it. He shook his head. John said he loved him, not that he wanted to marry him. For everything that’s happened, John may not be too keen on the thought of remarrying.
Mrs. Hudson brushed a finger against her nose and watched as John's hand connected with his daughter's. John was smiling, but it wasn't like the ones Mrs. Hudson used to see before Sherlock died. She thought that she would keep that to herself because she was sure that John knew too.
“The dragon is starting to grow on me, John…John?” Sherlock turned to face him and John’s cheeks reddened at being caught staring.
“It’s deep in the country, so I’m sure it’ll take quite some time. You’re going to need a car.”
'How can you be so sure, John? All evidence points to the fact that I do not have the necessary emotional support to care for a child.'
You smiled and I walked over to you. I told you that I had to feed her first and you nodded. I set her in the highchair that Molly bought us before she was born. I turned the chair so that she could face you. I thought that I was imagining things, but I could have sworn that I heard your voice say, 'Hello, Little Dove...'
"It takes up a lot of space, doesn't it? We don't use them..."
I told you that I had to, that we couldn’t keep this a secret any longer, they cared about you Sherlock, it didn’t look like it but we were a family of sorts, we all had each other. Together we were all just a bunch of lonely misfits.
“Well I couldn’t miss out on my little brother’s wedding now could I?”
“I don’t think I’ve ever really told you, but, if anyone asks, that’s the best day of my life.”
"No, Doctor wait!" John shouted in an angry whisper. It was too late, he was gone. He left him alone with a semi-conscious Sherlock and two people who may or may not be them. But there was nothing he could do about it, he would just have to wait for the Doctor to come up with a plan.
Watson couldn't help but smile.
Kylie didn't respond. She took another bite of her banana and just looked at John.
The boys are in love :)
A minute didn't even pass before John's phone vibrated again.
“I think of you as John Watson, my companion, my partner.”
John closed his eyes and clutched the counter, how much more could he fall in with this man? He was already neck-deep in his amount of love and to hear Sherlock singing, he wasn’t sure he could handle it. Sherlock had so much love in his heart and even the most coldest of men could hear it when he sang. He couldn’t help it, he had to see Sherlock’s face while he sang the children’s song. He wanted to etch the memory of Sherlock’s face while he sang. He turned around and Sherlock was looking directly into Rosie’s eyes, his mouth, the mouth that John loved so much, the soft pink lips that he kissed. That mouth and those lips were curved into a smile so delicate and fragile that John physically felt his heart wrench at how painfully beautiful he was. Sherlock’s blue eyes flickered up to John’s, and he continued to sing softly, “You’ll never know dear, how much I love you…please don’t take my sunshine away…”
"Well then there is no more, Doctor, and what are you doing here anyway? John, you were planning on telling me that he was here, yes?"
It wasn’t until we got back, it was getting late, the sun was already setting and we’ve had enough fun for one day. You looked distracted; you just sat on the couch and stared into space. Normally I would have just kept to myself because it wasn’t the first time you’ve done that, but I was worried. You smiled all day and so it was odd that you would all of a sudden just, mope. I made you some tea and then sat down in my chair, watching you watch nothing. I’ve always wanted to know what goes on in that big, beautiful mind of yours, but you would never let me.
“But I do believe it would be better if all of you were to be in attendance.”
“John, I can’t believe you just said that to me.” Sherlock immediately sat up and grabbed Rosie in his arms. He walked off with her and then returned shortly. He laid right next to John and made sure that the man’s eyes were on him.
'Oh, I'm sure he'll see to that. He wouldn't be my John if he didn't confine me to our bed.' You joked. I've always loved hearing you call me your John because I was your John, and it'll always remain that way. The doctor smiled at the both of us. I think he was proud of our relationship, I don't know.
‘John!’ You knew that you were going to be released from what you called, ‘Medical hell’, and you couldn’t be happier. I smiled in response; it felt good to see you as what I would define chipper. Once I was at your bedside I gave you a quick kiss, you were reluctant to pull away from me. When you did, your attention went to the overnight bag I was carrying immediately. You tried to snatch it from me, but luckily enough, I was able to move my hand out of the way so that all you grabbed was air. You pouted.
He got up and walked over to the lamp, giving both of the soon-to-be husbands a glance before turning it off.
He forgot about her for a moment. He shook his head and sniffed.
"Sherlock!"
But he was ambushed by Harry, who wasn’t drunk, but still coming to terms with her brother’s marriage. Sherlock made the decision to join John in his discussion, since he knew that Mycroft felt the same way about the nuptials. Harry had a drink in her hand, it looked like Champagne.
Sherlock’s tone changed with the conversation.
“I know Sherlock; I know you want nothing more than to be out there with me, I’ll come back for you I promise. I just need a better understanding of what’s going on.”
"Hush, Holmes!"
John struggled and shouted, "Kylie?! KYLIE!"
Watson took a deep breath.
John looked over at his baby who was occupied with the letter blocks scattered on the carpet. Her hair grew a bit longer, it was now covering the tips of her ears. Her chin was wet with drool. Her outfit was a red long-sleeved shirt underneath overalls that had a bee sewn onto her chest pocket. John’s brows furrowed slightly at her clothes. What was off about them?
“Alright, Holmes, was it? You’ve piqued my curiosity now. Tell me, what else do we share? Besides landladies and scientific inquiries, that is.”
Sherlock’s parents came. They hadn’t spoken a word to him since he got sick, if they ever knew about it, which they probably did. Mummy Holmes cried on her husband’s shoulder as they approached the coffin that held their youngest son. No parent should have to outlive their children. Mycroft made a brief appearance, he smiled at John, ignored his parents, and stared at Sherlock for so long that John was sure his eyes were going to burst into flames. John looked on as Mycroft was no doubt sharing a few words between himself and his brother. When he was finished, he ran a hand through Sherlock’s curls and left the chapel.
“I think she’s having a bit of tummy pain. We’re in the bathroom now, I’ve just given her a sip of the oil. She didn’t eat much this morning.”
"John, it has come to my attention that you have been...how should I put this? You've not been well since the death of my little brother."
Another laugh. “Goodbye, John.”
John calls out from work to help Sherlock heal.
John cocked his head and the Doctor let out an exasperated sigh.
Her smile was wiped off her face the moment he asked.
‘Are you coming or not, John?’
"S-Sherlock...I..."
“Look Rosie! Bees are amazing. Like John!”
“Sherlock, Sherlock, it’s alright love. I didn’t mean to make it sound as if I’m blaming you. I’ll see you for dinner, okay? What would you like?”
“Ah, yes, them.”
“Please, get some rest, for me at least.”
Later on that night, I saw you standing at Kylie’s crib. She was awake, but we were occupied doing something or other. You reached in and from my view; you were giving her what looked like strokes on her wonderfully big cheeks. Your mouth had the smallest of smiles on it and I couldn’t help but watch you interact with our daughter. I didn’t know what brought that about, but I was proud of you. You were making progress.
John nodded.
"....The day Kylie was born...well it was a crazy day, to put it mildly. We were on a case, one of the last cases we ever took. Your mood was making me worried, so I gave Greg a ring and asked, well...more like pleaded for him to scrounge something up. Surely there was some type of crime going on, London's underworld was crawling with thieves and criminals and whatnot, they're like...spiders...they only live long enough to breed. There was Moriarty, but I don't want to get into that now. He's gone, you saw to that when you left, even if that meant leaving me alone.
'What about me, Sherlock?'
John stepped a bit closer.
Ella never had many patients, mostly because they got better. John was one of the patients that couldn't get enough apparently. He was one of the "needier" ones. As long as he was giving her money, she wouldn't stop treating him. A part of him thinks that she feels bad for him, and she knows that he can't pay the real bill she gives out. John rolled his eyes. He should try looking for a job. Mycroft sends him money, but that's the only reason why he knows that the only Holmes brother is still alive. John can't believe he was considering giving him a call.
I didn’t want to hear your goodbye, Sherlock. I did everything I could to make the days pass by without fear of having to give me the mournful words that you gave everybody else. I couldn’t bear to have you staring at me with those sad eyes, and tell me that you regret that we didn’t have more time together. I didn’t want to hear you apologize for something that you couldn’t have helped. I was in denial during your last days, Sherlock. I would come in with that stupid smile on my face, and I talk with you like we were back at the flat and it had been just another Friday. I failed to notice, I mean I willfully ignored your weakened body, your slowed heart-rate, and your heavy eyes. I just wanted to lay with you and to kiss you and to tell you that we were going to be alright while you stared at me with those skeptic eyes. You knew what I was doing, but you let me do it anyway. You attempted to please me, Sherlock. You wanted to make me happy, but that wasn’t the way. It wasn’t the fucking way, Sherlock.
"Well, did you? Go on, tell me."
He saw dark curls behind him through the mirror and sucked in his breath. The soft blue eyes looked worried as he was perched on the side of the bed.
‘You got my call, yes?’
Sherlock shrugged cursing his blushing cheeks. “I’ve been told.”
It was a few minutes later that I realized that you weren’t sleeping.
“You’ve ever seen Star Wars?”
"I'll be more than happy to take care of your friend at our flat."
“Will it be just you or will we have two more flatmates?”
Sally was kneeling now, she was whispering kind words to the crying child. Mycroft sat as his desk and said, "You will be able to see her every other week. This should give you enough time to sober up."
He bent down to pick her up. He went into her room and picked out a purple shirt with a dog on it and some shorts, the weather was a bit warm. He eased her soiled dress off her, she laughed when the dress covered her face. He hummed a tune as they quietly prepared for their outing to John’s clinic. Rosie had become restless recently, Sherlock thought that it had something to do with her going shopping with him. She liked going out, and there hadn’t been much opportunity to go anywhere beside the shops.
“So, this is where I’ll be until further notice?” Sherlock was joking as he walked to his side of the bed and lifted the covers.
“Kylie…uh, Kylie wrote this for you. She asked if I could take her with me today, to come down here. I told her that this was just between daddy and I. She’s, uh, she’s a good girl, Sherlock. She follows instructions well, she’s the star pupil of her class, and she’s just a beautiful thing really. She…she turned five a month ago. She’s just turned five and already learning how to read and write. She told me to give this letter to you and I…I’ll read it.”
His phone was vibrating and it was just the person he wanted to call. He heard Rosie screaming in the background. Sherlock must have been holding her.
You nodded first and held your arms out. I was excited for you, I wanted you to hold her, I wanted you to feel her, to actually see her. But before I could place her in your arms, you retracted them and refused to take her. I asked you why you did that, what happened. You crossed your arms and told me that it was nothing. You were worrying me, Sherlock.
The more he thought about it, the kitchen didn’t feel like his kitchen. It wasn’t lined with the ugly wallpaper that he had come to love. There was food stocked in the cupboards and the fridge, something that John did for the both of them at Baker Street, but it wasn’t right here. It didn’t feel right that he was buying food for another home. The living room was nice, comfortable, but it wasn’t
"I'm still here you know! Now let's go, there are alternate dimensions to be discovered, ancient cities need to be revisited, history needs to be witnessed!"
"I still don't know whether or not this is rubbish or they speak the truth."
And wasn’t it true? If he could make all the money in the world, he would make sure that Sherlock would live the posh boy life he denies for John’s sake.
And there went the sad look in his eyes. I quickly opened my mouth and said, “I’m not going anywhere, Sherlock. We’ve got a good thing here, I think.”
“Sorry about that.”
John closed his eyes and exhaled. “I’m a git aren’t I?”
"Mrs. Hudson came in one time. Don't know how
‘What do you think they’ll expect to see, John? You and I both know that I’m not getting any better. I’ll be causing them more pain by letting them see my body wither away. I won’t allow that, I cannot allow that.’
Sherlock's eyes darted to John's at The Doctor's words. John grew incredibly nervous.
table wasn’t this clean and empty. It was filled with piles of papers that mostly belonged to Sherlock, and his beloved chemistry set that he never seemed to have time to clean up. This wasn’t the table he wanted to sit at, the chair was stiff, and it was aching his bum, at Baker Street he had those little cushions that John insisted on buying for the sake of his own butt too.
“….Are you happy?”
"Ah, I have one! Tell me, where exactly are you from?"
With a sigh, I responded,
“Just humor me, Sherlock. I understand that the times are different in your world. Indulge me.”
He looked down at her and lessened his hold on her.
"Second cupboard on the right."
“I know, John.” His mouth tugged into a small smile.
"That's good enough for me!"
“And why would I do that?”
It just struck John that Watson would have no clue about who James Bond was, or what a movie even is. He just shook his hand and waved it at Watson.
"Hang on Sherlock; we'll get out of this yet."
Sherlock grabbed his hand.
I rose out of the bed first and helped you get up. Your curls were pointing out in every direction, but you either didn't care or you just didn't mind that. I know that I didn't. Kylie was awake, to my surprise, I thought that she woke up when she heard the sound of our voices. You were already in the living room when I entered it. You were sitting on the couch looking at the blank telly screen. It wasn't until the sunlight hit you that I saw just how unhealthy you were and I knew that it wasn't going to be long until you had to go back to the hospital and wouldn't be able to come back to the flat. I just wanted you for a little longer, love, was that so bad? I was doing everything right. I took care of you, I loved you, and you loved me. I did deserve to have you, right? I was a good husband to you.
When they got upstairs, they found the two men already dressed as if they were going somewhere. Watson greeted them with a bright smile.
"....My....wound....it's.....bleeding....too....much..."
‘I don’t care how, I want to know why.’ I cut you off.
"What do you want?"
“I don’t quite agree with you. I hope you two make a choice.”
I whispered goodnight to you, but you gave no response.
John laughed and kissed Sherlock's cheek.
Sherlock…You were so sure that the procedure wasn’t going to work and that you were going to die, you had no hope. You take death as it comes, Sherlock, but not like that. Not by searching survival rates and surgery statistics. Some things…some things you have to leave to chance, Sherlock, I just wish you knew that, or let yourself understand that.
He pointed a finger with his free hand up at Holmes.
He made his way to the fridge to find Mrs. Hudson putting away groceries that she brought recently. Seeing John in his pyjamas, she jumped and rose to her feet.
"Oh yeah sure, I'll stay out here, and let you two snog and frick frack."
‘There were some days, John, where I needed them.’ You didn’t even sound like yourself.
‘How was the case?’ I asked you, even though, some part of me deep down knew that the case was a lie. You were bored that day, Sherlock, but you weren’t that bored.
She nodded but then froze.
“I still don’t see what you’re telling me.” He was trying to be optimistic and it hurt, because he knew exactly what they were saying.
“It’s a personal website where people post entries about themselves or their silly little opinion on something or another. John uses his to write up my cases, however.”
“Well the oil is not going to work for a few hours, and she seems calm now. I can try to get a bit of the shopping done if you would like. But still, order takeaway tonight.”
“Is it…I mean, can you…?”
John felt a jolt of electricity course through him as he felt Sherlock’s soft hand clasp his own. The soft rumbling of his laugh excited him and caused him to laugh too.
Sherlock wiped away a tear and the sounds of sniffles only increased at that.
And there it was. Sherlock thought that this relationship was temporary, to fill a hole that never needed to be created in the first place. He knew that he shouldn’t have left, that he should’ve left all his belongings here and found excuses to visit him every day. He wished that he didn’t leave him alone during the honeymoon, leaving the blog comments unread, text messages unanswered, phone calls sent straight to voicemail. If he wasn’t such an idiot, he would have seen that Sherlock tried everything he could to keep it all together for the hopes that maybe he would come back, but he ignored it, and the feelings that bubble over whenever he looks at Sherlock, and now here they were.
He was right.
"Here, let me."
Holmes steepled his hands.
You looked like you didn’t want to finish the story, but because I wanted you to, you did it anyway.
I shook my head and continued to stand. Mycroft rolled his eyes and said, ‘Yes, I’m going to sit here and wait until my little brother is out of surgery.’
Nothing.
“It didn’t happen all at once, mind you. You looked a lot better, and you even told me that you took one pill a day instead of two. You were up again, playing your violin that’s been neglected for a while. Kylie loved listening to you play Mary Had A Little Lamb. And I can’t tell you how thankful I was for playing those lullabies when we were trying to get her to sleep. Your violin was something I loved hearing, which was when you weren’t playing it at insane hours of the night and I didn’t realize that I missed it so much. I remember Kylie and I were sat in front of you, sometimes you realized, and other times you didn’t. Either way, I enjoyed the concertos you played for us, whether you noticed or not.
John chuckled.
"They may be ruthless monsters, but there is a way to beat everything, John. Besides, when they aren't trying to throw you into a different time period, they are just statues, and nothing more."
‘When can I…go home…?’ Your face softened and the grip on my hand got tighter. You always thought that I had the answers to the questions you couldn’t figure out. That wasn’t always the case, Sherlock. Sometimes, I was just as clueless as you.
“Get to the angels!” Sherlock shouted.
"I forgot to tell you to hang on!" The Doctor shouted.
And John was too blinded by the domestic bliss to even notice.
John turned his body as much as he could with Sherlock resting on his thighs, already riding his right thigh with excitement. To John’s amazement, in Sherlock’s pocket there was a bottle of travel-sized lube. He shook it off and immediately flipped open the lid and squirted some onto his hand. He quickly rubbed along his penis, sending shocks of pleasure, along with precome, through him as he applied the lubricant. He threw the bottle to the floor making a short reminder to pick it up before they leave, but Sherlock was panting and begging John to enter him.
I tried to look around the flat, see if there was something that could keep me busy besides the telly and the newspaper which I’ve tried to read on multiple occasions and still haven’t gotten past the first page. Then, my eyes rested on your laptop. You know that I try to give you as much privacy as possible, but you didn’t tell me anything, you didn’t tell me your thoughts on your current condition; you even tried to act like it never happened. Who knows what you were up to on that computer, Sherlock? Just like the pill bottle, I would have to investigate your laptop.
John's eyes widened, he had almost completely forgotten about it! It wasn't as if Sherlock was the type of person to let everybody know that his birthday was only a day away, or tell anybody when his birthday was. Hell, John had to go to Mycroft to get the date! Sherlock isn't big on birthdays, but he would still be hurt that John didn't even try to celebrate the day of his birth, and John will not be able to tolerate that. It only seems right, since Sherlock remembered his, and Mrs. Hudson's.
"You've got one of them, an angel I mean, it's....it's right behind you."
It was then that John realized that he missed Sherlock so much. The house felt different without him, even when Mary was still alive. There just wasn’t that banter that he was so accustomed to with Sherlock. The thought left him smiling into his food for the rest of the film. John took care of the food as Sherlock put Rosie to bed. She had fallen asleep halfway into the marathon, but the two were so comfortable laying on each other that they didn’t move until after the third movie. John stood in the doorway of his daughter’s room and watched as Sherlock gently set her down in her crib and rubbed her back when she stirred. Thankfully, she stayed asleep and John could let the breath out that he was holding.
Then it was my turn.
Young Sherlock was dabbing a piece of tissue to a rather angry looking cut on his knee. Sherlock grimaced at the sight.
He should, but he can't. He can't do much of anything anymore. Hell, he barely manages to exist. He doesn't even know if he can call himself a parent anymore. Poor Kylie, she could've had the best life, she could have been so much happier if she wasn't John's daughter. There are some nights where he can't even stand to look at her. He's probably hurt her so bad and on so many different occasions.
"Don't just stand there like you don't know anyone, John! It's me The Doctor!"
Sherlock had the look of amazement and fear, if Holmes were to describe it. He stood back up and then spun around a few times in a circle so that he could try and make something of this. How? He thought, how could this be possible? He knew that The Doctor was going to take them both on a romantic trip, pre-wedding, but they ended up in Victorian England. He remembered getting knocked over by the man who called himself Holmes, but that was all he could really remember. There were the vague memories of John waking him up and whispering sweet nothings to him, but he had plenty of those memories. He turned back around to face Holmes.
It was at that moment that Sherlock held John’s face and came all over his stomach, in hot, white spurts of semen. John let out a scream as he emptied himself inside of Sherlock’s body, feeling the come seep out of Sherlock and back onto his wet penis. The two men sat like that, riding the waves of their unified climax together, nose to nose, mouth to mouth, smiling, drunk with arousal. Here and there they pressed kisses onto the other’s lips, and whispered more sweet nothings.
“Love, you were the nicest person to me since I left the army, everybody pitied me, led me to think I was worth nothing but sympathy because I got hurt. You wanted me to help, you made me feel like I was the most important person to you, even though we barely knew each other. Sherlock, you saved my life.”
"Doctor, you didn't need to tell him everything!"
“But you have a time-machine!”
Sherlock’s mouth twitched into a smile. Holmes couldn’t help but smirk either.
After the tea was made, and Sherlock’s singing turned to humming, John was sat on the sofa with a dozing baby in his arms thinking about Sherlock. Sherlock was in the kitchen trying his hand at making spaghetti. He told John that cooking is chemistry if you think about it, and he is a graduate chemist. John wanted to tell him that there was more to it, but was too distracted to say anything.
"Y-you can?"
"My point is, while it may seem like the world is out to get you, you'll find somebody out there who loves you just as much as Redbeard did. He'll..."
“Are you measuring the coagulation of saliva after death, as well?”
‘Have a nice day, Susanne.’
Mrs. Hudson came to the flat this time, Kylie was still asleep and John didn't want to wake her so he phoned Mrs. Hudson, and under the condition that John pay for her cab, she came. John didn't pay for the taxi because he was using it himself. He told Mrs. Hudson to keep his whereabouts a secret from Kylie because he didn't want to worry her. Of course, his ex-landlady understood him completely and told him to go ahead. She kissed his cheek and gave him one of those smiles that she was so fond of during his stay at 221B. He could barely return the small one he gave.
I took a seat on the chair and opened your laptop. I was surprised that you didn’t have a password. You know what, never mind, you would have probably locked yourself out of it because you deleted the password.
“Where’s Sherlock?”
You were in your usual position. Your hands were steepled underneath your chin, you weren’t paying any attention to us, and your long body was sprawled out on the couch. I hope you didn’t have any nicotine patches on. You were doing so well.
“We are companions, and nothing more.”
“Thank heavens we’ve found you!” Watson exclaimed.

He had both men by the wrists and gave them yanks, as if he were commandeering a dog sled.
He wasn’t sleeping at their house as much as he used to, he found himself at Baker Street many nights in a row. It felt right, seeing Sherlock wake up in the morning with his hair all messy from the sleep that he would eventually succumb to, yawning and stretching his long limbs in every which way, and then walking over to John and asking for a cup of tea with the rare smile on his face. John noticed that they smiled a lot more in each other’s company. Sherlock would sit in his chair and just stare at John for long periods of time, John would pretend not to notice, but he would eventually make eye contact with Sherlock.

"You know what I mean, Sherlock."
She blushed but then continued on her way. When John finally made his way up to the first floor, he found both inhabitants awake and already beginning their day. Holmes was sitting at the table eating a piece of toast when he saw John standing there, still wearing the waistcoat from yesterday.
"Doctor, Doctor are you there?!"
"Those are papers...for child custody."
"You're not supposing, Sherlock, you are. You haven't eaten in four days."
John laughed to himself.
His tone was menacing and harsh, the sharp and educated dialect he used made him sound all the more threatening. Sherlock could've taken him down easily by now, and Moriarty knew that. This is exactly why he used John and Watson as bait for both Sherlocks. They were their pressure points. Or as Jim Moriarty would phrase it, "I'll burn the heart out of you..."
A few minutes later, Kylie came out of her room dressed in a pair of blue jeans, and a pink and white striped shirt. She needed John's help with her hair. He managed to make a ponytail out of her long tresses, he had to take her to get her hair cut. Maybe Mrs. Hudson could do it, she used to cut Sherlock's hair for him and did a pretty good job too. He would have to ask Kylie sometime this week. He slid on her denim jacket and gave her a kiss on the cheek. She gave him a smile and returned one of his own.
‘I’m going to have a shower, John. I’ll be out shortly.’ You weren’t yourself.
“Was it in a morgue?”
John snorted.
"I want chocolate."
The boys find their way back to Baker Street
John swished the warm liquid in his mouth before he swallowed it. He saw Sherlock's eyes lingering over the matching tuxedos that they were going to wear for their wedding tomorrow morning, and then he thought about Sherlock's change in attitude. Ah, he put it together. Sherlock just has a case of pre-wedding nerves, it's understandable. He set the cup down on the nightstand and then shuffled closer to Sherlock, wrapping his arms around the small waist and resting his chin on Sherlock's shoulder.
“Please, tell me more.”
"Yes, the TARDIS picked up a distress signal and so naturally I listened, it wasn't normal, not like the other ones I have gotten in the past. It was crying, the soft, anguished cries of a child who has lost something precious and dear to them. I couldn't possibly ignore it, I'm the Doctor and I help people...well...there are a few times where I failed in that aspect...but I don't want to dwell on that now. I followed the signal, and it led me to him and let me tell you, I have never felt so much sympathy for a child before. I couldn't just leave him there, alone and helpless, I had to take him, and I gave him back, mind you. I wanted him to smile, even if it was for a little while."
‘You want to warm the bottle up for me?’ I asked with a bit of disbelief.
“I’m going to have a shower and make some dinner. The box is there whenever you want to open it, oh! Sally says, ‘happy Christmas’ by the way.”
He just didn’t want to exist.
John grabbed his hand and forced a smile.
“I never said I didn’t.”
John chuckled. He remembered when he was asked that same question by the innkeeper during the Hounds of Baskerville case. He rejected the idea, but now, he wanted it.
“Let me finish.” Sherlock’s voice sounded so painfully raw and John’s instinct was to sit up fully and place a hand on his back. He would listen to whatever it was that Sherlock had to say, they would stay up all night if that made him feel better.
'Don't worry about me John, I'm fine! Focus on the Waters, they're getting away!'
Holmes's face never changed, it was straight and there wasn't a hint of emotion on it.
“I’m sorry that Clara couldn’t be here, she loves soppy stuff like this. She would still be crying right now even though the ceremony’s been over for quite some time.”
He broke down in Kylie’s room, clutching one of her stuffed animals. He didn’t want to break down, but it was the liquor in his system that made him do it. He missed her dearly, he missed Sherlock dearly.
John hissed in pain and a hand shot up to his head. It landed where the trail of blood was.
"It's a wonderful planet with people that have heads the shapes of bananas. They're awfully hospitable though. I recommend it, but, this is where you want to go."
John came home to find Sherlock and Rosie sat on the floor playing with her toys. He smiled and walked over to the two. He bent down to press a kiss to Sherlock’s head.
But then everything went to black.
"Wow, this looks delicious! When are we eating?"
John looked over at Molly, who wasn't even looking at him anymore. He could see her eyes following Kylie around, she probably forgot that they were sitting there, watching her. Molly uttered a short laugh, John could see the tears in her eyes. He didn't want her to cry, not right now. When you're trying not to break down yourself, watching somebody else cry doesn't help your case. He thought that maybe he should comfort her, be the good person. He can't even will himself to move a limb.
John paused, and he removed his hand and placed it in his lap. “Okay, you and me. Let’s talk.”
They were all lying in bed. Rosie was happily napping on top of the two men, who were staring up at the ceiling smiling and chatting the day away. John had stared at Sherlock and when prompted by the other, he started to rattle off all the things he loved about him.
“It was enough, John. You’re enough for me.” They both shared a few more kisses until they heard Rosie’s cries from down the hall.
"You let a little boy chase one of London's most vicious killers through the catacombs?"
John nodded absentmindedly and carefully handed her over to Sherlock who walked lightly to her room. John seated himself at the table and stared at the plate that was already prepared for him. He smiled softly at how clean the plate was beside the food directly in the center. John didn’t care much for presentation but of course his posh boy did. He looked over at Sherlock’s plate and saw that it wasn’t nearly as tended to as his own. He loved that man. Sherlock appeared in the dining room and took his seat. His eyes were fixed on John with an eager smile on his face.
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock was staring at him from the kitchen with a frown. “I’ve been calling your name for ages.”
Sherlock paused for a moment.
“Looking at her now, I’m not even sure if I would want to bring her back if she’s happier here.”
John walked into the kitchen still rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. He stopped in the doorway and stared at Sherlock holding Rosie with one hand and holding the bottle with the other.
I nodded and stretched my arms out for her. I was so careful, she was so soft, Sherlock. She was asleep, she had a long day too. I didn't know what to do, should I rock her? Should I start weeping tears of joy all over her tiny body? Or should I do what I was doing then, in that moment, and simply stare at her until my eyes started to water from lack of hydration? You were standing next to me, looking on fondly as our daughter slept. You had the tiniest of smiles on, which was okay because your eyes held all the emotion. You were so proud Sherlock, and you were so happy. Lara was attending to Susanne, who was trying to stay awake.
“I love you so much, John. Truly I do.”
“Yeah, so?”
“You’re gorgeous, you know that?”
Sherlock was staring at the tuxedos that were hanging up in the open wardrobe. He bit his lip and his hands tightened around each other, with a finger resting on a shiny gold engagement ring that John Watson gave to him all those months ago. He was caught by surprise, everybody was. They were at home when he did it. They were in the beginning stages of their shag, they were only half-naked. Sherlock was pressing gentle kisses to John's chest, and then moving over to his shoulder where the scar was. His soft lips kissed the scar, making sure that he got every inch of it before moving anywhere else on his body. John was grazing Sherlock's long graceful neck with light breaths and heavy kisses. John was propped up in the bed, whereas Sherlock was sitting in between his legs, with his arms wrapped around John's own neck. John's hands were grabbing the detective's fine hips, but his hands were going lower, they finally stopped on Sherlock's rather plump behind. John would pull apart from Sherlock's neck and then press his lips against his.
“Hey…hey I’m not saying what you
Holmes and Sherlock’s eyes darted to each other.
That's the closest he would get. She accepted it, and he was grateful. Kylie let go of her father and then scurried off into her room, shutting the door after she entered. John was on his knees in the middle of the kitchen, staring down the hall. He had to keep trying, for her. He got up and made his way over to the collection of the various alcohol bottles he bought while Kylie was at school. His choice for today was going to be Jack Daniels, that's the one that everyone picks, it's the bottle that depressed, lonely sods like John drink. He had to be quick with this glass, Kylie was awake now and the last thing he needed to explain was why he needed a drink before dinner. There, he managed to pour himself a glass without so much as a noise coming from Kylie's room. He had to go without ice this time, but that was alright, he welcomed the familiar burn down his throat. He wasn't so fond of the other burn, the one where he had to swallow his tears every time he looked at the empty side of his double bed. Those were the nights where he had to sleep with Kylie.
“Yeah, me either.” John added.
His eyes got teary.
“Come join me in the bed, love. I’ve put Rosie down for a bit. Come lie with me.”
“He finally came to me, all on his own; I couldn’t believe that he knew how to walk. He had his coat on and his violin in his hand. He told me that he couldn’t remain here any longer, to many reminders, too many memories. He said that somebody sold him a cottage in Sussex Downs, an old friend from years ago. He told me that he wasn’t coming back, and he’ll send for his stuff. And just like that, he was gone. I haven’t seen him since. And now here you are.”
"Very good, John. Not bad for a man who makes everything out of boxes and cans."
John kicked his foot.
"Holmes and I were discussing your whereabouts upstairs when Holmes remarked that he heard a noise, but I heard nothing. We thought that it was you lot returning from your outing but we were wrong, as you can see."
"I don't see why we shouldn't be."
“I brought it with me just in case.”
“We hope you don’t take this the wrong way, we’ll cross each other’s paths I’m sure.”
Sherlock blushed. John smirked. What a gutter mind.
Sherlock almost looked ashamed to say whatever it was he was thinking. He closed his eyes, took a breath, and said, “I’ve never had one.”
“I would never do that, John.”
"Right."
Sherlock calls John at work and they both sing
With laughter in his voice, The Doctor rolled all over them shouting, “Good morning! It’s about time you two woke up; it’s really no fun when everybody is sleeping, nothing to do to pass the time.”
Of course, that was all he said to me. He was a smart lad and could tell that I wasn't in the mood to hold a conversation, so he backed off. It was the man next to him that came up to me. He looked a bit smug if you asked me.
He obliged anyway and laid in the bed. He wanted to talk to Sherlock, there was so much he wanted to say, but he became so tired. He fell asleep staring into Sherlock's soft blue eyes, and the faint smile he had spread across his lips. His sweet, gentle lips.
“But I haven’t touched it in so many years. My bum grooves are not even imprinted in it any longer. You could have thrown it out and I would have never known.”
~~~~~~~~~
“Like what?”
Holmes's smile fell almost instantly.
With a sigh, John gave an unsure nod and gestured for Watson to follow. Watson seemed happy and then walked over.
John didn't respond. He wanted to say it to her, he wanted to tell her that he loved her so much, she was the one thing that still tied him to the earth, but he couldn't say it. He cursed himself and shut his eyes out of disappointment. For all of the times he scolded Sherlock for lacking the emotional support towards Kylie, he was doing just the same. She was going to hate him when she got older, and she would come to resent Sherlock because he's the reason why John couldn't say three simple words. He had no problem telling Sherlock each and every time he saw him. He wouldn't even blame her if she did.
John was sitting on the couch now. He was concerned at Sherlock’s sudden halt. “Until what, love?”
Watson brought his laughter to an end at John’s inquiry.
'He's waiting outside, he's not very good at stuff like this.' That's what I told her. She accepted the answer.
The Doctor was taken aback, but he let him vent, he knew that he was very worried for Sherlock, as he rightfully should be. Watson just stood there, not knowing if he should intervene or not.
Sherlock asked that with the tone of a youth who has just found their first true love. John continued.
“You owe me two nappy changes, you understand?”
The Doctor jumped up and stood in between the two men while they were conversing.
