“See, he thinks you’ve got “great potential.” He doesn’t whip that out for just anyone,” Meg grins.
,” Dean hisses. “He’s probably reading the poor kid his dissertation.”
Cas scoots closer, hoping to find the right words before Dean closes himself off. “What is troubling you?”
“We’re made in the Lord’s own image. I don’t think I can ever truly fathom that. The multitudes. The endless possibilities. The older I’ve gotten, the more I think we’re like that Dean. Sometimes I’m a man and other times, I just feel like myself. Like Castiel. Am I making sense? We can be however we want. At any time in our lives.”
“I’m so sorry, Cas,” Dean whispers. It’s all he can offer.
Dean is on his hands and knees, Castiel’s hot breath against his ear.
There was part of his teenage self that was disappointed in his primary marks. He had dreams of a flashy, vibrant design. He imagined a six-winged seraph or a Great Eagle. However, only two weeks after the primary marks manifest, did the secondary marks spring forth from them, like the Spring of Arda. Basil, cilantro, dill, and thyme twisted together along this spine. Lavender grew down to his hips. Birds perched happily on the plum tree growing from the roots of Laurelin. He delighted in how the marks moved and shifted. The weather, the season, even the slightest change in mood set forth a cascade effect.
Dean crowds into his space. “I know what it is, Cas. “You
“Son, you ever meet a strange sort around here. Don’t turn them away.” She whispers, as if this is secret information.
Garth might pull out the sock puppet. Not happening.
Castiel rolls his eyes, unimpressed. “Your brother asked about a wedding. A time to celebrate our union with loved ones. I think a spring reception would be delightful. How about you?”
He saw them eating breakfast together. Doing dishes with the guy. Watching
Dr. Mills scribbles something down. “What are you writing?” he blurts. Dammit.
Dragonite can fly like Charizard. Dean can live with it. It’s way more accurate than Mimikyu.
He could stay. Get more angry and frustrated. Yell at Sam for every little thing. He lived that life once. He doesn’t really want to again.
The words ring in his ears and into his heart. His breathing slows. His hand itches.
Dean continues to stare.
Sam huffs, “I told you, we have a sliding scale for payments when necessary. We try to provide as many classes free of charge. We are lucky to have many generous benefactors and the bunker is full of magical artifacts that sell well.”
He thinks better of it. Dean once was so certain his life would end at the barrel of a gun or the edge of a blade. Now, he’s certain he’s gonna be arguing about wallpaper until he’s on his deathbed. He’s fallen himself in a way, into a life he didn’t expect, but wouldn’t give up for the world.
Dean hasn’t pushed Cas away. He doesn’t want to.
Both Dean and Cas startle. Cas shakes his head, turning to greet Jack. “Good morning Jack.”
He could backtrack several thousand steps and ask Cas what the fuck he means. As usual, he does the stupid thing.
Cas deflates, glancing between the car and the distant mountains. “I’ll fly home I suppose. I live out in Washington. I had hoped to stay out here longer.”
“I haven't had an interest in physical intimacy in the past. I never had a reason to. Now, I think I would very much like to kiss you. We can do so after I finish here,” Cas says, gesturing to the computer.
Dean really hopes this blade isn’t in some far off dimension.
His own.
“You’ve got a kid?”
“I thought it useful before our first mandatory Milton fun event,” Cas explains. “You once complained I had too many siblings.”
Dean squirms. “Did some housework, hung out with Cas.”
He was rapidly trying to think of something Castiel might have been. Nothing was coming up. The dude might be an angel.
The tow truck takes its sweet time getting there. Dean googled the name of a nearby garage. The reviews were decent enough. The driver offers them a ride with him but Dean can see Castiel's exhausted.
“Are you going to miss being an angel?” Dean wonders. He had debated if he should ask but this is an important transition in Cas’s life. He shouldn’t have to carry the burden alone.
It’s the same for Dean. Ever since he saw him in that god awful car. He leans up to press his forehead against Cas’s.
Dean slams a gallon bag of ground beef on the table. “Jack, what’s the most important lesson I ever taught you?”
In his hunting days, Dean never had the pleasure of dealing with zomhosts, although they turned up in his research. Sometimes he thinks he misses fieldwork and then he’s reminded that he actually doesn't.
“Jerk.”
Dean turns, pants now securely belted at his waist. “How do you feel?”
Cas leans his head on Dean’s shoulder. They sit there well into the afternoon.
Cas tilts his head. “There’s a lot out there to see Dean. I think it will be an adventure, to try something new.”
The man doesn’t move. His eyes dart between the map and Cas. “What about that?” He accuses, pointing to a blue line.
“Yeah,” Dean mutters, trailing off as looks out across the background. “Cas, what’s that?” he blurts out suddenly.
“I have lotion. The oat milk lavender formula you liked,” Cas offers, trying and failing not to linger on the mark.
“We need to talk,” Cas states. Alarm bells ring in Dean’s head. Oh god, Cas is going to tell him that he’s thought about it and he actually doesn’t love Dean. He’s packing his bags and taking Jack to Florida or something.
Somehow the farm feels different. Beyond Gabriel occasionally checking in on the house, it’s been empty for years now. This place has a lot of memories, not all of them bad. He hopes he can make it feel a little bit like home.
The place is busy. They sell typical gut grease to tourists. A little out-of-place but Dean’s not in the position to be picky. He orders some beers from the barkeep, a friendly woman. She’s armed to the teeth. All concealed but Dean knows a hunter when he sees one. The night wears on. He waits until the place is quiet. Just him and the drunks, passed out at their tables.
Cas gets a constipated expression, “At least I try.”
“Heya Cas. Making burgers for dinner. Good day?” Dean inquiries as he pre-heats the oven for the puffs.
Although right now, he would appreciate it if the tulip weren’t so blatant.
Cas’s smile lights up his whole face. “You are the best husband I could ever have.”
Dean hadn’t expected that. He didn’t know what he expected but “I like chumming it up on Earth” wasn’t it.
Trench Coat looks up, squinting at Dean. He feels like his very soul is being examined.
“Yes. I want you to fuck me and make me forget the last few days,” Cas informs him, his hands unbuckling his belt and shoving his pants and briefs down to his knees. He’s already half hard. Dean gets his shoes off and pulls off his pants and briefs while Cas gets himself fully hard. The key to any successful quickie is teamwork.
Cas’s eyes go wide. He shakes his head. “No.
Castiel
“Hey Cas, what are you gonna do once we get to North Cove?” Dean inquiries. Might as well get to the point.
There’s another message from Claire. She was complaining to Dean a few days ago about her current assignment, working on clearing out a haunted mansion with Jody and Donna. The owners insisted it was a few ghosts. Based on her descriptions, it was clearly an infestation of zomhosts, zombie ghosts, a rather unfortunate combination.
And so, Dean found himself inside the tiniest bar he'd ever seen, alone, except for a, mildly confused and awfully suspicious, bartender. He had brought him a beer, no questions asked, and now stood at the farest end of the counter, sneaking penetrating glances in the direction of the unlikely visitor.
"You think you killed me?"
And so, none of them said a word, and they sat in silence while the wind howled outside.
“Cas, every bitch wants to be Mewtwo. Doesn’t mean they are.”
Dean surveys miles of flat valley before them. There’s still a good amount of snow on the ground. The elk are shaggy, coming out of the hardest winter months. It smells like damp hay and shit. Still, these elk made it through the winter. There’s the promise of spring around the corner.
Cas proceeds to kick everyone’s ass. The little twerp is mad as hell but his friends rein him in. Cas smiles at the pile of cash he’s won. He tucks it into his wallet and saunters out of the bar.
Dean frantically paced in the Gas-n-Sip breakroom, trying to convince himself this entire thing was all due to the collision with the slushy machine.
Jack throws his arms around Cas. He returns the embrace.
“Nora’s been a darling. There’s just a few billing issues that have been giving her trouble,” Meg tells Cas.
“Text if you’re gonna be home after 11:00 okay? You know how your Dad worries,” Dean reminds Jack as they pull up. “And text if you need a ride back.”
Dean grins. “Thanks Cas.”
Cas doesn’t answer immediately. Dean’s barely conscious but he does hear the last thing Cas says before he drifts off to sleep.
An impossible thought starts to form. “They do already react,” Cas says slowly, “The flowers are for you.”
“I will.”
Thankfully, Jack asks to see Cas’s photographs. Probably to avoid being interrogated about school. Even so, father and son sit at the dining room table as Cas tells Jack about the last few months.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean hurls the knife at the map. It lands with a thud, just east of Las Vegas.
“Heya Cas.”
Cas gives his nod of approval. “Truckin” is the first song to play.
Dean laughs, “I’m still helping with planning. I promise not to use Moondoor against you again.” He breaks the churro in half and offers one section to her “Will you accept my peace offering?”
“You okay?” Dean asks, putting his hands on top of Cas’s own.
“What?”
Dean’s never manifested. Didn’t mean anything was wrong with him. Just meant he didn’t wear his heart on his sleeve. He kept that shit locked down.
Dean nearly drops the tray. “A cruise? Gabriel is going to shove the Milton family onto a cruise. Like a fancy one?”
Cas embraces her, “I am very much alive.” Cas turns toward Dean, “Meg, this is Dean Winchester. Dean, this is Meg Masters.”
Cas’s eyes snap open. So he picked up on where this is going. Dean can do this.
“Not particularly. At least I don’t think it will,” Cas says. He doesn’t sound confident.
“Right,” Cas says. “In case the ones in my bag are damaged.”
Cas explains his engagement to Jack over breakfast back at their apartment. Jack is excited since it means he got extra whip cream. Dean’s proud to see his kid has got his priorities straight.
“Sounds good,” Jack calls absentmindedly, transfixed by Jeopardy.
Dean begins to feel his face redden so he bolts into the Gas-n-Sip. He doesn't want to embarrass himself in front of Cas. It was one compliment, why is he blushing?
“No, but please be careful,” Cas cautions.
Cas sits on the back porch, clearly amused. Like his son, Cas is a quick learner. He’s almost mastered basic car repair and maintenance. He is still skeptical of Dean’s insistence that he needs to change the oil every few thousand miles but Dean is working on him.
“Our brother has fallen. Take care of it and you will have what you want.”
Dr. Moseley recommended a specialist to confirm her suspicions.
On the back, in Cas’s messy handwriting was scribbled:
Cas nods, “I was so used to spending time with Jack at your apartment. It allowed me much-needed respite. I tolerated a great deal before Jack came into my life but three weeks of constantly being with my siblings demonstrated to me that Jack and I need our own space. I know your apartment is cramped. I was, well I was hoping we could get a place of our own.”
Dean’s quick to change the subject. “So, what are your plans now?”
Cas was relaxed and acting like he was comfortable with Dean. Like undressing in front of him wasn’t a big deal. It was just something you did with your travel buddy.
Turns out telling Sam may have been a mistake. Dean’s video chatting with him while Cas gets ready for bed.
Dean was in love. He hadn’t gotten the memo until that exact moment. What Dean should have done at that moment was kiss Cas. He should have reached over, yanked him by his stupid tie, and kissed him senseless. Or at least told him how he felt. Ask Cas what he wanted from their relationship.
“Bitch.”
Dean tries to play it off. He’s not sure what’s happening right now.  “Umm, yeah, it's really hard to go on a two-week cruise. Even if I was to tag along, What’s your family going to do? Say mean things to me and treat me like shit? That was my entire childhood, I’ll survive.”
Dean thought angels unknowable, before Castiel came into his life. They seemed so otherworldly, beyond human comprehension.
He’s halfway through digging through his sewing box when he hears the loud creaking sound of his front door opening.
There’s a faint hint on something around the cabin. Dean can’t place the feeling but it's probably some sort of fancy angel magic.
Cas’s face is unreadable.
“Winchester. It’s just Dean though. Dean Winchester.”
Dad wouldn’t hear it. There was a hunt up in South Dakota that needed their attention. Sam had left them. He could deal with his problems on his own.
Cas smirks, “She helpfully informed me that a cruise to the Carribean that her father is paying for is cool enough for her to go.”
Dean huffs, “In the snow.” He throws open his arms for a hug, “Are you just gonna stand there? Where’s my hug? It’s been too long.”
A few days later, they end up at a glass palace in downtown Portland.
Cas had given Dean a questioning look, not sure what this ridiculous boy was talking about. “Did what hurt?”
“I feel the same way. Jack is eager to meet you. He actually suggested the backpacking trip. I think it is an excellent idea,” Cas tells him.
“Same,” Dean forces out. “How’s, how’s it been?”
Dean forces himself to breathe. All the things Cas has listed are true. Except…
Cas’s face softens, “It’s a wonderful idea Dean. It suits you.”
“No, Castiel is right. I counted,” Jack informs him. Another thing to work on with Jack.
. He had selected the
Dean sits up to rest his head against Cas’s shoulder. Cas passes him the pie container. There’s half a slice of cherry pie. It’s the perfect temperature. He takes a bite before clearing his throat,  “What did you want to talk about?”
Jack pokes Dean’s shoulder. “Dean, did you defeat the monster?”
Cas gently corrected him. He was gay and something.
Living in cramped quarters with another man is surprisingly easy. It never feels crowded with his travel buddy. Dean usually gets up first, makes breakfast while Cas complains about how early it is, even if it’s 10:00 am. Dean kicks him off his bed so they can actually eat at the table.
Cas pulls out his phone to make sure Jack is alright before he calls for roadside assistance.
Eyes. Thousands blink in and out of existence on the spinning rings. The eyes have their gaze fixed on Dean. He thinks he sees the outline of immense wings. It’s hard to tell with all the lights.
They’ve driven a lot of roads together. Baby definitely makes it more stylish but it’s another night of traveling together. It feels right, like the two parts of his life have somehow come together. His life as a hunter seems so long ago, despite it being less than two years.
They muck about town till evening. There’s some rowdy bar down from the gas station that fits the bill. It’s mostly locals but a group of college-aged kids catches his eye. They’re probably camping in the Sawtooths.
“Cas.”
He turns around, puts on his best smile and extends his hand out for Jack.
The tulip doesn’t recede all night. It doesn’t move at all. For weeks.
“In the snow right?”
“Lissuin,” Cas corrects.
“Damn right sunshine. I’ll swing by earlier for breakfast. You owe me,” Dean replies.
Human Cas is Meganium. It fits. He is a lover of plants, plus Cas does smell pretty good. Angel Cas is Ho-Oh. The legendary flying type Pokémon, the guardian of the skies. The rainbow is said to trail behind it wherever it goes. Dean chuckles to himself.
Dean gives an overdramatic sigh as he snaps his tongs at Cas, “If it was anyone else,
“Hardly. I simply find it wondrous that despite everything that has happened, the elk still instinctually come here every year,” Cas says.
Castiel reaches out and takes Dean’s free hand. “Thank you Dean. I accept your apology. Please know that you’re always forgiven.”
It bothered him at first. He insisted it wasn’t
Dean can feel himself blush. This always happens with Cas. A little praise and it’s like he is a teenager again. He’s got to get it together.
Dean finally meets Cas’s gaze back in the present. Cas is smiling fondly, “I’ll admit I was a tad dramatic but I wanted you to see what was right in front of you.”
“Really?” Dean asks, as he tries to find his pants in the low light of their bedroom. “I mean, you’ve still got your wings attached. I assumed you’d transform or something.”
on fire trying to tend to the barbeque while debating Cas.
“Hell if I know dude,” Charlie informs him, as she reaches to steal more of Dean’s chips. Dean’s been filling her in on the situation.
“I had a fight with my brother. He was asking when I’d be home. I said some things that I didn’t mean to say,” Dean says. He sighs. How does he explain his relationship to Sam without all the crap about Dad, the fire, everything.
He rolls into the Gas-n-Sip parking lot at 6:01 am. Cas is standing patiently in the parking lot, hands folded together.
So Dean does something dumb. He gets out of the car, stalks up the outside staircase, and kicks in the front door.  The sign on the door that reads, “Bee! Welcome to Wing and a Prayer B&B” rattles loudly in the small office. He’s on the innkeep in a second. Dean grabs the guy by the scruff, hauls him up, and shoves him against the wall. He opens his mouth to demand some answers when suddenly the world turns.
Cas turns back to face Dean, “After you are settled, I would appreciate you taking me to the nursery. I am without a mode of transportation right now.”
Cas had snuggled against him on the couch, tired after a long shift. Jack was mesmerized by the movie, getting excited every time a new dinosaur appeared on screen, enthusiastically informing everyone what each dinosaur was called.
“Dean,” Castiel says, through gritted teeth, “This ends now. I will not stand for it.” It’s not a request.
Claire isn’t buying it. “Dean.”
The other is a military commander. On their way to Yellowstone, Cas shows him his list of objectives. He wants to see the best wildlife viewing areas. Not even the devil itself will stop him from achieving his goals. At least he added the geysers Dean wanted to see.
“You got it, sunshine.”
Dean realizes he’s been standing there, frozen like a deer in the headlights. “Umm. Don’t get me wrong I do want to but it’s not something I’ve done before. I mean I have. Not with a dude though. Or an angel. Dude shaped angel. Shit. Cas I haven’t had sex with a man and it makes be nervous. I’m sorry.”
“Jack means everything to me. As we are together, naturally I would like you in his life,” Cas says matter-of-factly
The asshole used Dean’s weaknesses against him. He told Dean would worry about the truck breaking down or Dean being standard far from help. Really laid it on thick. So now, Dean was the proud owner of a respectable used Ford. Extended bed. Even so, Sam gave him a AAA membership. God, his brother is the worst.
Dean stakes out the place for a few days. He puts up at some shitty motel down the road. He almost regrets not booking a room at the B&B. The beds look comfy.
The man frowns deeply before turning on his heels and storming out.
“You were right about Baby,” Cas remarks. His eyes are still closed, his voice sleepy.
“I trust that you’ll understand when I say that Jack is not fully human,” Cas informs him, turning his gaze towards Dean. He nods, trying to keep his attention on driving.
“That’s what I thought. Fuck if I know. I just feel heavy. Not tired. Drained? I don’t what would have happened to me if Bobby didn’t take me in when I was a kid. He’s more of a father to me than Dad ever was. To see him suffer needlessly is just—he’s being a stubborn son of a bitch for no reason.”
Castiel might have a point.
Dean jiggles his line. Nothing is biting. “You’re considering going then?”
“What’s that?”
Dean flicks water on the pan to check the heat. “I will not apologize for improving your hamburger game Cas. Hand me the Fritos will you?”
“Well, come on then. Talk to me.”
Jack grimaces, “Little mishap with the timing belt. I was hoping that I could damage-proof it. Wouldn’t need to replace it then but, uh, I must have written the spell wrong.”
Getting out of bed is more difficult than before. Cas has a death grip on him and it takes a great deal of effort to untangle himself. Cas never wakes up no matter how much Dean squirms. More likely, huggy bear didn’t want to get his ass out of bed
The sigh Cas lets out is one of long-suffering exasperation. “Dean.”
“Umm, I made out with a chick at a conference a couple of years back. That count? The panel was boring. Not a great kisser but better than listening to the blowhard giving the talk yammer on. Look, I know I’m essentially married to Cas,” Dean sighs
He could talk to Sam about this. Although his little brother preferred to stay out of Dean’s decade-long romance. When Dean first fell for Cas, he’s sure it was a shock for Sam to realize his older brother wasn’t quite the brash jackass ladies man he played himself out to be, but instead a jackass with a bad case of bisexual suburban dad. Dean refused to acknowledge that for a long time. Sam gave up trying to broach the topic after a while. Whenever it came up, he sighed as dramatically as he could and told Dean to only update him if it was to give him the wedding invitation.
“Come on dude, it doesn’t change anything between us,” Dean says. What else could Cas be?
That was not what Dean was expecting. Still, Dean probably can guess the list. Jack takes after him.
Dad didn’t see it that way. Told Dean to get his head out of his ass, since Dean’s soul was busted anyway. Dean never told him it was a man but Dad knew though. He had to. The dreams stopped after Dad saw fit to set him straight.
“Sammy,” Dean warns. “Don’t you dare. Cas is in town to work on his book. Nothing else.”
Dean licks his lips. Dean wants to ask Cas to record that. Would that be weird?
For his part, Cas doesn’t seem bothered by Dean’s presence at all. He hangs up his trenchcoat, pulls off his tie and starts to unbutton his shirt. If they were in the camper, Dean would look away at this point. Now he is sitting in the dude’s bedroom. On the bed.
The tulip is unmoved.
He puts Honey on one shoulder and Bee on the other, before returning to the back porch. He places them on the foraging tree, away from Colette so they don’t annoy her. Not that it matters, she usually flies over to Dean once he puts the audiobook on. She enjoys a good mystery and he’s been working his way through the best of Sue Grafton with her. He does tuck the phone in his shirt pocket though so Colette doesn’t eat his phone case. She doesn’t try today, instead fascinated with the buttons on his jacket.
Unlike the chain, the inside of the building looked unusually sturdy. The benches and altar were made out of the same hardwood as the door, the carpet in the middle of the corridor seemed clean and soft. It was a comparably tiny church, with an average visitor number of less than a dozen, and so the various furnishings were withstanding the test of time out of sheer luck. Dean picked up his duffel and sat it beside the door, keeping it lightly obscured by an abandoned coat hanger. He couldn't carry the weight of it in case of an ambush, but didn't want the tools inside to be found by the wrong person either. The gun was all he had. Standing straight, his gaze fixed forwards, Dean took a cautious step. His boots sank into the carpet, the sound of it being muffled almost entirely. He sped up. There were no niches or coverings for someone to duck behind in a room as small as this one, and so he went straight for a small door at the back of the altar, hidden amongst iron candlesticks and wooden crosses.
But maybe it hadn't been someone trying to get in. Maybe someone had wanted to get out.
Deans' eyes found the axes box. It had been pushed aside after being opened and emptied. He wanted to put the axe back in its' rightful place, but there was still blood caked onto it, so for now, he took an old shirt and wrapped the weapon in it. It was starting to tear at the edges anyway, the blood would provide the incentive to finally throw it out.
"You seem to have a challenging task in front of you."
The man didn't respond at first. The driver started sweating a little.
He lifted up his hands in a vaguely defensive motion, and took a few steps back, looking everywhere except in the direction of the man in front of him.
"Welp, not sure this'll be enough. I might need to get back to the car and get some more supplies, wanna come with?"
Dean was... disappointed. He had hoped for something, at least. Some kind of answer. A simple 'no' would have done it too.
An ice cold gust of wind blew into the bar as the door was ripped open with force, shaking Dean to his core, but the man stepped out into the stormy night without hesitation.
"I already told you man, it's Hills. Look, I don't want any trouble, let's just-"
He lifted his hand, and, with deliberately small motions, wiped at the blood covering his eyes and mouth. Reluctantly, he opened both. The scene in front of him was... confusing, at best, and utterly terrifying at worst. There, right in front of him, lay the decapitated body of the bartender. Blood was still oozing out of him, covering the floor and soaking into the wood. His eyes were wide open, but the blue light was gone. Dean looked to the side. Dead things are never pleasant to look at. His gaze wandered across the altar in front of him, taking in toppled over candle holders and splatters of blood on the stone floor. He wasn't sure whom it belonged to. Averting is eyes for a second time, trying to find something else to focus on, he stopped abruptly. A pair of legs obstructed his vision. Someone was standing in front of him.
Of course, it quickly turned out to be the only viable option, but it hadn't been his goal.
Step by step, he got closer to the old building. It was towering above him already, covering the moon, which had been obscured by clouds, drenching the approaching man in darkness. Dean went over everything he knew for the final time.
The man stared back at the driver, his expression unmoved as ever.
Though, he wasn't immune to the elements, and found himself in dire need of help from time to time.
Or he really was of a different nature, a new monster, undiscovered through the ages, now finally revealing itself for.. for what? What reason could there really be?
Dean took a deep breath. His beer was almost empty. He didn't want to go. The bar was safe, lit up, with another human inside of it. Outside, where he needed to be, was a storm brewing. He was scared.
The hunter turned away from Dean. He grabbed his beer for the second time that night, and took an absurdly large gulp, before setting it down on the bar with an unnecessary amount of force. Although, it didn't seem angry. If anything, it looked like the attempt of a teenager trying to make themselves seem intimidating.
"I apologize. I assume it is rude for me to speak to you without holding eye contact."
His tone was growing steadier, more forceful. He wanted the man out, away from his car, away from him.
Dean was fiddling with his drink, shooting quick glances at his companion, who was staring right back at him. The animalistic aura returned to him at once, and Dean couldn't help but cringe inside. It had been the wrong question to ask.
"Have you dug the grave already?"
"So, uh, I think Ludlow's coming up. That your destination?"
"...right."
It threw the driver off-guard. He had expected begging, sobbing, maybe even promises of future debt, if he would just release him from the grip of the forces of nature. Instead, the mans' tone was neutral, almost apologetic for inconveniencing him. The driver cleared his throat.
Dean was taken aback by this question. He averted his gaze, vaguely gesturing toward the small hole next to them.
It must have been a hallucination, brought upon him by too many hours spent driving, too many sleepless nights, the cold and the darkness. Maybe it was a shadow, or a trick from the light. Nonetheless, he slowly pushed on the brake, resisting the urge to slam his foot down, in fear of slipping over the icy road. The car came to a slow halt, illuminating the creature in front of it. It was a standoff, one in which neither of the participants knew the others face, but only knew of potential threats that might have been lurking in the unknown.
"I'll, uhh, try to find the least frozen plot of dirt out there", Dean said, pointing his thumb over his shoulder, and swiftly turning around.
The man, previously towering above him, battleaxe in hand, was now crouched beside him. His face, recently bathed in shadows, was looking a lot less dark, a lot less intimidating. The man cocked his head to the side.
"Do you feel threatened, officer?"
It wasn't fair. All this work, all the tracking, the months of research, vanished just like that. Reduced to nothing but wasted time and a trail ending in blood.
"I could ask you the same,"
For now, the atmosphere was calming. The bar was still using incandescent light bulbs, which provided a warm, low light, occasionally flickering due to their age.
He had been acting childish.
Dean held his breath, but he didn't avert his gaze. He and the man stared at each other. The mans' eyes were icy still. No visible emotion, or any semblance of life. Just emptiness. They penetrated Dean, seemed to look right through him, into his heart and soul and all of his secrets and burdens. Dean was unable to look away.
Something touched Deans' shoulder.
And that was exactly why he downed the last of his glass, put a fiver on the counter, turned around, and left the building with heavy footsteps. Fear brings insecurity. Insecurity brings hesitation. He couldn't allow himself to be hesitant, or anything of that matter.
The driver quickly freed himself, climbed backwards out of the car and shouted: "Out! Now!"
The hunter shuffled awkwardly, seemingly not quite sure what to do, before setting the bundle down on the ground.
A deafening punch to his nose almost made Dean lose consciousness. He heard a crack, and could feel blood spurting across his face from where his nose had been shattered.His vision was growing dark around the edges, and the growl emmitting from the creature sounded far away.
When the hunter opened his mouth, Dean almost feared that his soul would fall right out of the provided opening.
Dean shook his head. His thoughts were just spinning in circles now. The lack of sleep was getting to him, the events of the previous night were catching up. Suddenly, he was sure that he was concussed. The fall onto the hard, unforgiving rock had affected him too much to just be a little shakeup. He should go back to Bobbys as fast as possible, have him check it out. But the drive ahead of him was long.
"What the fuck."
He was staring right at the man, into eyes as blue and icy as the world around them, and probably even more deadly.
He tucked his head in, cursing to himself, and apologizing immediately after. It seemed as if the curse had hurt or frightened him in some obscure way.
"I am told that a lot. It confuses me, though maybe it shouldn't. I do look quite young."
"Jesus dude, can you fucking stop sneaking up on me like that? That could have been anyone! I could have had a heart attack!"
The rising sun was glinting in the black metal, and as she rolled along the road at alarming speeds, Dean was drumming the steering wheel with his hands, humming along to the song.
The hunters head snapped up at the sound of him approaching, and he took a quick step back toward the altar. Dean halted in his tracks and stared at him, furrowing his eyebrows.
And this one had indeed been special.
He had been researching for weeks in preparation for this, double and triple-checked all the given information. Everything pointed to a monster living in this tiny, tiny town, one so vile that it might just have the information Dean needed.
"I'm an officer. You can find my badge in my wallet if you want to see it. Just letting you know. Uhm, I could get you outta trouble. But I can also give you trouble. If I have to."
"No way, you just saved my life man. I won't leave you to clean this up on your own, that'd be a dick move. Come on, I got bleach and shovels in the duffel. Think you can dig in this weather?"
"Oh, I'm a werewolf alright."
The light was very close now, in a comfortable walking distance, and so Dean slowly started to pull over.
He was on a personal search, one might call it that at least, and he had hoped the beast could aid him on his way. Tough luck.
Dean closed his eyes again. He was convinced of his own death, or of him being inside a weird dream. He didn't need this.
"Alright. I don't know what your deal is, I don't wanna know, just please leave me alive, okay? I got stuff to do. Important stuff."
The driver quickly went around the car, and stood behind the man, aiming directly at his head. He was taller than the man, if only by a little.
He had been gripping it tight, keeping it close out of habit. He wasn't sure the bartender had even noticed it, and if that was the case, he was glad about it. The contents of the duffel weren't exactly conventional. Now, they would be the only defence Dean had.
A snarl escaped the creature, which transformed into a raspy laugh as Dean struggled against the hold of his attacker.
The driver just stared at him. The mans voice was unusually deep, maybe even a little raspy. The driver attributed it to the cold weather that his lungs had been exposed to. He raised an eyebrow.
As Deans' thoughts kept wandering, the speculations grew wider, more chaotic. It helped him deal with the situation he was in. His companion hadn't moved a muscle since they had started driving again, made no sound, only blinked very occasionally, as if his body had to remind itself how to function normally every now and then.
And with that, Dean took some, almost comically large, steps toward the big wooden door, grabbed his duffel, and made his way out into the cold winter night.
Chapter Two
"Walk."
This one could be it.
Sorry everyone, this ones very short. Ive recently graduated, and things have been very very stressful. I have to admit that I wasnt really all that motivated since publishing the last chapter. I need to find the time to read again, because reading is what usually motivates me and makes the words flow from my brain. I hope you enjoy this one nonetheless, even if it took so long to come out.
The driver slammed the drivers side door, sending a loud echo through the snow filled night. He pulled a gun seemingly out of nowhere, and aimed it at the man in front of him, who slowly lifted his hands toward his head, still calm, still with no trace of emotion on his face.
"The window."
"Ah, not sure there's any food around here mate. Should have some in the car though, granola bars and stuff like that. You want me to get them? I could use some calories myself."
And it would have been over entirely had it not been for the other hunter showing up.
Outside, a man slowly walked past the parked car. He stopped for a moment. Let his eyes wander over the car, mayber linger on the backseat for a second too long. Shook his head, averted his eyes, and kept on walking, his trenchcoat dragging behind him atop the freshly fallen snow.
Even if he kept up his current speed, it would probably take him 3-4 hours to get there depending on the traffic situation. Normally, this would be a stroll in the park; today, however, he was physically and mentally exhausted, probably concussed, and hadn't slept at all during the last 24 hours.
The driver waited for a follow up, which never came.
And a new day meant a new job.
Dean stepped closer and spread his arms, gesturing vaguely at the dark stain at their feet.
Deans' eyes opened, and he saw the face of a man that seemed to have never felt an emotion in his life. Not fear, not anger, not hurt. And certainly not mercy.
"Dean."
As Dean began looking for a suitable place to park, his mind drifting back and forth, further into delusion, he paid no mind to the strangely familiar looking individual who was pacing along the side of the road. Besides, even if he did look familiar, it was only a hallucination conjured up by his tired brain. After all, only one of them had a car, and there was no way for any normal human to cross this much distance in so little time.
The cold steel pressed harder against the soft skin on his neck.
His train of thought was entirely focused on getting as comfortable as possible in order to stay asleep for at least an adequate amount of time.
"You.. did what?"
Dean saw his chance, and he wasn't allowing the other man to shut him out any longer.
He soon spotted the perfect space to dig in this weather. Below one of the trees, only halfway obscured by the blanket of snow, was the opening of some kind of fox or rabbit hole. There were no signs of something inhabiting it, no footprints or droppings around the entrance. It might have just been covered by the snow, but Dean was willing to take that chance, and deemed the hole as abandoned. He would use the existing opening as a start and expand it, saving himself at least a bit of work.
"So, uh, how long have you been out there? Next town is miles away, no way you could have walked that."
He frowned.
"Well would you look at that. And I thought you were a werewolf." His voice was as cocky as ever, but they both knew it to be a barely standing facade. Dean wasn't prepared for this.
Dean stared at him.
He stopped in front of the church doors. The blanket of snow in front of them was undisturbed. The doors were closed, locked shut with a thick iron chain. Dean set his duffel down. He opened it, shuffled around for a while, before pulling a bolt cutter out, and cutting the chain clean in half, with little effort. The county hadn't went all out with their expenses when locking up the building, or so it seemed. The chain made a loud thunking noise as it clattered to the ground, only mildly dampened by a, comparably thin, snow covering. The church roof had kept the worst of the ice away. Dean didn't flinch at the sound, but he did halt for a moment, listening for any sign of life inside the old building. Now was not the time to think about covering his tracks, and the snow would cover every trace of his presence soon enough anyway, so his only worry was the possible occupant waiting for him inside. After another quick look around, Dean allowed himself to avert his eyes from the doorway, and bent down again.
Dean was breathing heavily, and almost didn't notice the hunter recoil from his harsh tone. Their eyes met.
Dean was baffled. Before he could comprehend what was happening and what he had just heard, the man had already gone across the room and opened the door.
The only sounds Dean could hear were the swaying of the trees in the slight wind, and the occasional crack of the branches. He turned his entire attention to them. The noise was somehow constant and rythmic at the same time. It filled his mind with ease, made him feel far away from the horrid situation he had found himself in.
Dean sped up a little more, then took his foot off the gas.
He started making plans for his further course of action. Since this detour had been a total bust, he needed to find a different approach.
"Seriously, how'd you come this far?"
The music helped ease the tension in his body and mind. The encounter was still riling him up inside, but his rage was slowly subsiding.
"I mean, I am, but you can't count on that. You must have been out here for a while."
"What are you? You're unlike any vampire I've ever seen."
Dean slowly turned, shooting one last look at his unlikely companion, before approaching the doorway where he had left his duffel.
"Officer."
"No way you can do this, you'll just ruin the floor."
"I was distracted, should have heard you coming."
Dean was approaching the first few trees now. Their branches had shielded the earth somewhat, and walking became a little easier with every step he took to get further inside the forest.
The drivers laughter had died down. He was furrowing his eyebrows, growing ever so slightly more weary of his unlikely companion.
The man had put it away.
(See the end of the chapter for
They stared at each other.
Dean swiftly lifted his head, causing him to wince in pain as his concussed brain was subjected to even more trauma. It caused his vision to go fuzzy again, and the blurry figure only came into focus very slowly. Dean almost recoiled in shock when he recognized his saviour.
"Ill park the car here. Don't know what kinda folk is creeping around these parts. Better to not make it easier for them."
Dean turned around, surprised at both what the man had said, and also the trace of humor inside his statement.
At the next hit, the spade broke.
"It's fine, don't worry about it", he sighed.
The driver had been on the road for a few hours now, hoping to get to the next town over before the sun went down. All hope quickly went out the window when the snow started falling again and again, covering the road in front of him in an ever thickening layer, which the car was already having trouble with. He had to slow down more and more as the sun slowly disappeared over the horizon, cursing his job and the extremes he had to go to a lot of the time. He would much rather be on the other side of the state, drinking a beer and enjoying the warmth of the pub he called his home.
His companion nodded.
He set his duffel down on the ground with a heavy sigh. Kneeling down, the snow clung to his trousers, and would probably melt into the fabric very soon. He hadn't been outside long enough for the cold to take effect on his feet, but he couldn't imagine it taking very long in a weather like this.
Some people were weird about their work, he knew that much, and he didn't want to crowd someone like that. The situation was pretty stressful, after all. You don't kill someone every day, much less by beheading them, and so Dean could cut him some slack.
But then, a slight unease overcame him. He registered the falling snow, and his blood ran cold, maybe even literally, and he was sure of his impending doom. The light had faded out of the sky completely by now, and there was nothing to light his way, the almost full moon now obscured by clouds that carried his death inside them.
"I have my reasons. I assume that you do too."
A wide grin spread across his attackers face. And then, Dean was flying again. He crashed into one of the front row benches, cursing their immaculate materials as the wood pressed all the air out of his lungs. His vision was getting blurry now, his brain was being rattled around in his skull, disorienting him. The approaching creature shifted in and out of focus. The booming voice felt like a punch to his eardrums.
The spade hit the ground in shortening intervals, ever faster, stabbing the earth and everything beneath it. Dean let his rage flow. His breathing was heavy, the icecold air was streaming into his lungs unhindered. It made his insides burn, but he didn't care. Someone needed to suffer in his place, and right now, he chose the very ground he was kneeling on as his scapegoat. Dirt flew around him, his fingers were growing colder by the second, gripping the spade desperately with a force that could shatter mountains, but in reality, only damaged a tiny piece of dirt in the middle of the south dakotan winter.
Deans thoughts however ran rampant, none of them uttered aloud, but they sounded even louder inside his own head.
"Dude, where'd you find all this stuff?"
Rummaging through his things, Dean soon realised that the only equipment he had for digging was a military foldable spade. He mumbled a curse under his breath, and begrudgingly pulled it out of the bag, preparing himself for a very long night.
Deans' eyes snapped open at the sound of the deep voice. His vision wasn't trying to fade anymore, and his headache seemed to have lessened. Even the throbbing in his nose had vanished.
The mans hair, formerly a dark brown, was already covered in a thick layer of powder.
"Thank you. I would prefer to wait until I can get a warm meal though. A cereal bar will not be sufficient, so eating it just for the sake of eating something would be of no use."
"Please, get the grave ready. I will take care of this."
"Is that...?"
He really hadn't wanted to kill the bastard.
There was a slight pause, and Dean didn't dare look at the other hunter to see his face. They had both chosen a task to complete, and he had failed his.
"I walked. I am very durable. I have the necessary qualifications."
Though, Dean stayed patient. This journey had been his life for years, and he had long given up to rush the steps that would hopefully, eventually, lead him to his goal.
As the man saw the moon rising in the sky, the air clean and crisp around him, a shiver crept up his neck, sending a tremble through his shoulders and down his spine.
He needed to concentrate, and speculating about the stranger wasn't helping his case.
Everyone has heard horror stories about hitchhikers, most of them ending in brutal deaths, stolen vehicles, missing person reports. The men, however, were unbothered by those sentiments, and it scared them both that the person sitting next to them was seemingly of the same mindset.
Dean sat still. He didn't move a muscle, didn't even allow himself to breathe. The silence continued. Slowly, Dean exhaled.
The driver closed his eyes.
Dean shook is head, grabbed the bottle, and pushed himself off of the floor where he was kneeling. He shouldn't be worrying about all this, at least not for now. He almost died, and ended up being saved. That was all that mattered, all that should matter.
"Thank you."
Though, the driver was getting skittish again, in need of interaction and stimulants, the need growing stronger now that a potential source was right beside him. He took a deep breath.
The most impressive thing in the entire sacristry was the window. It was directly ahead of him, and had once sprouted an intricate design, probably bathing the entire room in colourful light on a sunny day. Now, it was smashed. There was a gigantic hole in its' middle, haphazardly covered with old newspaper, which had been ripped open by the storm. The cold stormwind blew through the tiny room, and Dean noticed a puddle on the floor in front of it, where snow had gotten inside the building. He hadn't known about this. Nowhere in the news report had it mentioned a sign of a break-in, like, for example, a smashed window. Did it get ommitted from the report? Or did it only happen after the initial attack?
Time was running out, the full moon was only a few days out, and he wasn't interested in becoming werewolf food. He had an arsenal of silver weaponry in his trunk, from blades, to bullets, to a, rather impressive, battleaxe. Dean had stumbled upon the latter entirely on accident.
"Shovel broke."
He tried to banish the thought from his mind, shaking his head. He didn't need a reminder.
"Should have taken more time to look around. There's much more places to hide in here than you might think."
The hunter next to him hadn't touched his glass at all.
Classic rock.
Dean chuckled at his own joke, but secretly, he was hoping for his guess to be correct. It would be a childhood dream come true.
Dean shot him a quick look, then turned around, shovel in hand, and approached the foxhole. The man followed closely behind.
Finally, Dean closed his eyes. His knees pulled up to his chest, using his arm as a pillow, he drifted off into sleep.
As they approached the lonely beacon in the distance, Dean tried to force words out of his lungs, failing to do so for fear of saying the wrong thing, until he was finally able to direct a sentence at the man.
As he knelt down next to his bag, he started to calm down a little.
The man gestured toward the car behind Dean.
There was a shuffling sound.
The man on his passenger seat turned to him, and seemed to stare right through him, directly into his soul. There was a pause. One beat. Two beats. The man dropped his voice, almost reducing it to a whisper.
Or would he? Cas has always been hard to read in the romance department and Cas held his hand. For a hot second but still. That wasn’t normal. Was it?
The dinette cushions turn into a mattress. It’s not great but it’s a warm bed.
Cas squints and then points a beat-up truck out front. There’s a couple of kids sitting inside. “You drove up in that vehicle. I’ll need to see their IDs as well.”
Sam pats him on the shoulder, “Dean, it's the start of tourist season. He’s probably swamped right now. Also, could you pick up some bananas? I need some fruit for my smoothies.”
The cabin is rather plain, it’s painted white. Or it once was, now the paint is faded and chipped. There’s moss on the shingles. It looks like many places Dean has been to on hunts. Old houses in various states of disrepair. Utterly unremarkable.
Eileen is Latias. It took Dean a while to warm up to anything past Gen I but he has come around. Dean can see Eileen as Latias. She’s smart, handy in a fight and capable of reading people’s emotions. She has to be as a hunter. It’s a solid choice.
Cas looks up, “The legality of hustling is disputed in many places. For what it’s worth, billiards is a game of skill. I believe that young man learned that lesson tonight,” he says, seemingly serious.
Nougat is hanging around their neck, as usual, slowly scanning the room with his beady snake eyes looking for threats and possibly assessing if Dean is food. Dean’s thankful Jack chose a corn snake as a familiar rather than a reticulated python or green anaconda. Nougat isn’t capable of eating him in one go.
Cas holds it up for Dean to inspect.
He almost expects Cas to call him on his overprotectiveness but he doesn’t. His expression only grows fond. “I know. I haven’t decided anything yet. Now, why don’t you tell me about the case you were working on. The one about Whispers.”
“For fuck’s sake. Can you just...Let’s...No fuck it. We’re doing this. You can tell me to piss off afterward but I gotta say this. I love you.”
Dean looks down. There’s a plate with a sandwich and salad in Castiel’s hand.
Dean grunts, and pushes himself off the ground. He checks. He’s fine. His pride is a little wounded but he’s got nothing worse than a few bruises.
Sam coughs, “I take it you two finally got your heads out of your asses.”
“It didn’t explode,” Cas grumbles as he stands to get the necessary supplies. He lets his hand slide down Dean’s arm, before taking his hand and urging him to do the same.
Dean is a little taken aback, “Cas, you’re a Gen I guy? Come on, there’s literally a Pokémon that’s just a snake. It’s evolved form is just another type of snake.”
Does it matter what Cas is? If Dean asked himself a year ago, he would have said yes. Now, not so much.
“If you want to go, then go. Don’t let me being a party pooper stop you. Cook with magic to your heart's content,” Dean tries.
“I love you too Honeybee.”
Now they're Dean and Cas Campbell. They’re a nice, normal couple, with zero arrest warrants to their names. They have one adopted son, who has zero god like powers.
Dean rushes out before Sam can turn this into a hallmark moment.
“I didn’t know who your odd friend was yesterday so I didn’t say nothin’ but I gotta ask. You Dean Winchester by any chance?”
“He’s not used to the middle seat,” Jack says, patting the carrier. “Nougat you’re going to injure your nose if you keep doing that.”
“Of course. Tell Dean I say hi and to tell you about Jubilee. We’ve made a lot of progress since last week.”
“Past it.”
Charlie ignores him, “How’s he doing? He sounded worried last time we talked.”
“I just can’t, okay.” Dean says. He expects Castiel to argue. Point out Dean’s being stupid. Instead Castiel takes a few steps back, releasing Dean. He squints.
Cas tries again, “Umm, Dean, are you going to release me?”
“You never said anything!” Dean cries.
It makes Dean feel ancient to think that Claire is twenty-two. She’s become quite the accomplished young hunter working for Hanscum & Mills Co. It was a far cry from the kind of hunting Dean did with Dad.
“This is why I tell people I’m adopted,” Claire says, as she eyes Dean’s closet. “Anyway, do you still have that posse magnet shirt?”
Dean opens the door for Cas, he clamors over Dean, nearly shoving a knee right into Dean’s squishy internal organs. He puts his lunch, or dinner really, in the front seat.
Dean looks Cas over. “It’s not that bad” Well, the bright red ribbon kinda makes the hat tacky. Dean tosses the ribbon in the trash.
God fucking dammit.
Dean rolls his chair over to the window, where his office looks out on the Novak house. Dean can see Jack looking mournfully at the truck, a thick black smoke is rising from the hood.
Dean smirks, “Why were you giving our dinner a handjob?”
Meg sees them off. Cas had hoped they would change the name at least but Meg insists they're keeping it Earth Angel, in honor of Cas.
“No. Why would? Dean, I did not intend to add to your distress. Quite the opposite.”
So Dean’s attracted to men. Doesn’t mean anything.
Dean felt happy. He was so happy with his family.
The inside is something else completely. It’s exactly the kind of place Dean imagined Cas lived. The cabin is cozy, the interiors painted in warm oranges and browns. The walls are covered in various nature themed watercolors, kitsch signs, and framed photographs of Jack.
“Show me.”
“I want you to have it. May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out.”
A week goes by before Sam shows up. Looks like he did get that voicemail.
Dean is happy to see his influence is working.
Dean is not gonna fuck up his friendship like that.
“Words Cas. Not good at them right now.” Dean snorts. Gabriel’s familiar is for sure going to eat him but he keeps that thought to himself. He runs his finger down the list “Uriel is here? I thought Anna dumped his sorry ass.”
“Do you want anything from inside?” Dean asks Cas as he waits for the truck to fill up.
Dean can already feel Michael's irritation. Dean couldn’t care less. It’s Jack he notices. The kid is not feeling well. Jack’s a bundle of energy these days. They’ve had to work on his tendency to wake him and Cas up because he was impatient to get outside and play. He’s not playing or running around today. He’s curled in Michael’s lap, with Michael’s stupid newsboy cap perched on his head. Dean’s glad his future brother-in-law has a soft spot for the kid but it does have some downsides.
Right there, behind the dead werewolf, stood the stranger from his car. His hair was disheveled, he was breathing heavily, and, most importantly, he was holding a bloody, silver battleaxe. He looked terrifying.
As he pulled out a bottle of bleach from deep inside the bag, his mind wandered. The hunter showing up at just the right time was a welcome experience, but also an unexpected one. He had been incredibly lucky. Even still, Dean couldn't shake the thought that something weird was going on. Everything was too coincidental. The hunter in the middle of the road, the bartender of all people turning out to be the wolf, and the hunter knowing exactly where to find the right weapon to off him at the exact right time. Shouldn't a hunter looking for a werewolf carry his own weaponry? Was it really necessary to borrow the axe?
“What? Really? Right, we should see how your soul marks react. They may not do much at first. It’s not uncommon for things to get wonky with LO-HGM.”
After the Rim Drive, they end the day in Rim Village and have a romantic dinner. Dean doesn’t even freak out when the waiter asks what they’re celebrating. Cas takes Dean’s hand and says they’re traveling for themselves. Which is true, but Cas is always so sappy about it.
Jack studies Dean carefully, notepad and pencil in hand. His full attention is on the lesson before him.
I am not an alien. Why would you think that?”
“So, how did you like it?” Dean probes, as the credits roll.
“Yeah,” Dean answers.
Much like Jack, Sam liked to write his own spells. Cas, the bastard was all too willing to help him in that pursuit. The last time they convinced him to let them experiment at his house, the poor rambler ended up weeping every time it rained because the weatherproofing spell Sam was trying went tits up. Dean’s given up resisting at this point. All the witches in his life are very persistent.
Dean is about to reassure Jack that it is in fact very endearing when there’s a great commotion from Cas’s bedroom. Cas himself comes barrelling out a moment later.
“Where on earth are we going,” Cas asks.
A few weeks pass. Cas settles in. He assembles his furniture, eventually. He even got the supplies for the raised beds. Building them will be another challenge.
Fuck. Cas never used the red angry face unless he was mad. And he always used a smiley face emoji when he asked Dean to visit him at work.
“Hit us with it kid,” Dean says.
“Good talk,” Dean settles on. “Let’s never do it again.”
He’s returning from said bathroom break when he sees that Cas’s eyes are open. They’re peering at Dean.
Cas drives down the highway that leads to town. It’s early summer. The fields haven’t turned brown yet.
Dean scoots closer to Cas, their knees touching. “I don’t know how much my opinion counts on the grand cosmic scale but I’m glad you’re here Cas. You’re perfect to me.”
“Don’t deflect, Dean,” Cas says gently. “You did ask.”
“Yeah,” Dean laughs. “You’ve mentioned that. A lot.”
Lisa was an anomaly. Sam had enrolled in law school and suggested Dean try and live a normal life. Lisa was a kind woman, with the patience of a saint. She put up with Dean’s bullshit. Dean should have loved that life. Yet he got the urge to hit the open road before a year had gone by.
“Cas,” Dean warns. He doesn’t want to see Cas hurt. His heart aches at the very thought.
“Okay, so I’m Charizard,” He begins. Second coolest Pokémon behind Mewtwo. “Jack is Togepi. He’s a joy to have around and a literal child. Eileen is Sawk because she can kick my ass. Sam is, of course, Stantler.”
Dean stuffs another bite of his burrito into his mouth. “Come on, you know him. Do you think he’d be into a relationship with me?” Dean prods.
Dean nods. The next thing Dean sees is black. He looks around. Nothing. He looks up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas is without mercy. He hands Dean a list. It’s miles long. It’s got those stupid convertible pants on it. Maybe this is some kind of divine punishment.
“Resting your eyes. You sound like a middle aged dad,” Dean teases
“I might explode,” Cas answers honestly.
Cas continues, “I had been sitting on the knife’s edge between human and angel for many years. I was afraid of what I was becoming. Perhaps that is not the right word. Uncertain. Unsure. Meg suggested a road trip might help my midlife crisis.  I suppose she was right, I met you. You reminded me that I didn’t need to be afraid. I want to watch my son live the life he chooses, to witness all earth has to offer and to spend the rest of my life with the man I love. That is my choice.”
The whole angel thing did complicate one matter. Would he want to date Dean? Cas was a celestial being, millions of years old. He had cool powers. Wings! Dean was just Dean.
Dean decides he’s wrong. He understands angels perfectly. They’re complete dickbags.
“Yeah. And I kinda missed you this morning,” Dean admits.
He knew how gorgeous Dean was when he let himself be unencumbered. The first time he saw it was when Dean lectured him for an hour on why Kirk was the best Star Trek captain. Dean was wrong of course but watching him speak so fervently, it was wonderful to watch.
Of course, Dean actually needs to communicate that fact to Cas. It’s a work in progress.
Dean decides he should wing it.
He was tracing the faint lines where the wings once were when he blurted out his idea.
“What? No,” Dean snaps. “That ain’t happening. I just have to think about this.”
“No, before that. You were agitated when you came into the store. I couldn’t tell what was troubling you. I thought you were unhappy with me but you were quite relieved when you stepped up to the counter.”
Dean leaves. He could go east but he’s always wanted to see the beach. So he drives. The beach is fantastic but Los Angeles is also full of traffic. He keeps going. Takes his time up the coast. He runs low on cash past San Francisco.
Dean’s great. Or he will be, once his pills knock him on his can. “You always have to bring
Jubilee continues to smoke. If Dean were here, he’d no doubt suggest they throw Jubilee into the nearest landfill. It may not be as stylish as Baby, but it’s served Cas valiantly since high school. Yes, its engine is prone to acting up these days but so is Cas’s back if he doesn’t do yoga every morning. Breakdowns come with age.
“You sound like Sam,” Dean complains. “Even if I waltz up to him and announce I’m bisexual I don’t know how he feels. He is gay, he was
Cas gently squeezes his hand. “It’s alright Dean. I’m right here,” is the last thing he hears before he’s out cold.
As long as she's not gonna shock him or anything, He pulls his shirt over his head and plops down on the table. His shoulder is redder than it was this morning.
“You take that back. Jubilee can hear you,” Cas whispers harshly.
Dean supposes he could have stopped spending all his free time with the Novak family or at the very least not stood so close to Cas but he didn’t. He kept right on at it.
Cas winks at him.
Christ. Industrial arts. She sounds like Cas. “I teach shop, doc. It's not that fancy.”
“Cas?” Dean asks, snapping Cas out of his thoughts, “You trying to season that corn or show it a good time?”
Castiel doesn’t seem upset though. He smiles softly at Sam and offers him lunch. Over homemade falafel, Castiel explains what happened. Sam stares at Dean the entire time. After lunch, Castiel takes their plates, leaving Sam and Dean alone.
Sam chooses Deoxys for himself. “It is highly intelligent and wields psychokinetic powers,” is far too generous a description for Sam but he does like the implication that Sam is some sort of weird mutated space virus.
“Tell me about your symptoms.”
Butterflies flutter in Cas’s stomach, “Dean, please know I mean this in the best way but I think we’re both a couple of dumbasses.”
Sam turns to Cas with an innocent smile. “So get this, Dean’s got the world’s biggest crush on you.”
Dean hesitates for an instant before pulling up his sleeve, rotating around to give Cas a better view.
It’s weird for Dean to do stuff like this. Just give gifts because he wants to. Especially because the person he’s buying gifts for is a dude. Angel. Whatever.
Cas turns back to look at his car. The smoke continues to billow out. “I’m fine. Jubilee unfortunately is under the weather. I’m going to get her towed.”
Dean looks at her and shrugs. Nowhere. Everywhere.
“Dude, you created these things? That’s amazing,” Dean says.
“I’ve wanted to be joined with you in matrimony for some time. I could not tell how you felt on that matter. Your mind is often difficult to discern. I thought moving in would be an acceptable first step.”
There’s Cas. Dean sees great wavelengths of light in every color, spanning out like fractals from great golden rings. It reminds Dean of the northern lights he’d seen once when he was a kid laying on the hood of the Impala. These lights shine much brighter though.
Yeah, They do. They really fucking do.
“Dean.”
Once Dean shook off the initial shock, he looked up only to peer into the bluest eyes he had ever seen. Dean got lost in those eyes. He was pretty sure he was in the arms of an angel. It was a perfectly normal thing to think about the Gas-n-Sip employee looming over him.
“The sleighride. It’s near the end of the season and this will be an excellent opportunity for us to go.”
Dean turns over to stare at the window. He’ll deal with those thoughts later. He closes his eyes and falls asleep to the rhythmic sound of Cas’s breathing.
“You promise?”
There is so much to say and ask but they sit in silence. It’s so much to take in. Dean loves him. Chose him, even before his soul mark manifested.
“Brother, it has been too long,” Benny says, patting Dean on the shoulder.
“Case?” Dean responds, trying to track what Jack is talking about.
Dean makes sure no one is around. “The angel thing,” He whispers.
The tape hisses a bit, “Thank You” starts up. Cas laughs, “I look forward to spoiling the newest addition to the Leahy family.” He pauses, turning toward the window. “Dean, I wanted to tell you something.”
Dean got the bright idea to suggest a friendly game of Words with Friends. Cas had mentioned knowing several languages, Dean thought it would be a good way to bond.
Dean sneers at his stupid brother. He’s such an asshole
Cas shuffles in his seat, “Yes, Jack’s power made him a target. So did his partenage. I am Jack’s father in every way that matters. However, I am not his biological father. Lucifer is.”
“Dean, you have a job. It’s here at the B&B. Do you really want to do anything else? Hunting doesn’t pay well. You’ve told me yourself. Marriage would just formalize our relationship. You can get access to my bank accounts. We’d have a better tax rate.”
“Come on Cas, anything but that,” Dean pleads.
Claire shrugs, “I mean, it beats having to dig up a grave but I wanted to try my new hex bag cannon.”
Cas had asked one night, laying in bed if Dean would want to settle in Kansas. Dean surprised himself by saying no. It’s taken him a while to realize that he wants to be part of what Sam and Eileen are building but Kansas hasn’t been home for a while. Dean’s home is with Cas. It’s his incredibly tacky cabin on the coast where he raised his son. It’s in traveling around together because they both love to do so.
“Dean, do you hear yourself?” Charlie questions. “Do you hear what comes out of your mouth?”
Of course, he didn’t expect Sam to call him up one night, five years ago, and say he was dropping out of Stanford. Dean couldn’t believe it at first. Stanford was the dream. All Sam ever wanted. Dean knew instantly something was wrong. Sam was always on about how Dean didn’t want to talk about his emotions. Well, Sammy was just as bad. He wanted to talk about everyone’s emotions except his own but Dean could hear the desperation in his voice. Sam needed him.
“Such a considerate lover,” he says, grabbing the corn. “Could you get me one of your fancy waters? Not feelin’ beer tonight.”
Charlie grabs his phone before he can even protest. “No, you don’t. You want to look like a suburban dad trying to seduce his neighbor with bird-themed cruise wear instead of talking to him. There’s a difference.”
There wasn’t a lot of room at Sam and Dean’s two-bedroom apartment but Dean had managed to shove a twin mattress in the corner of his room for Jack. It was cramped but certainly more room than Jack and Cas had at the Novak house. In addition to Cas, there were nine Novak siblings, Jack, and Adam who for some reason willingly married Michael. It was a big house but with only so many bedrooms, they had to get creative to make space.
It’s 2:00 am and all Dean can do is gaze at the ceiling. After the doctor’s visit, all he wanted to do was get piss drunk. Forget about the whole day. But he can't show up hungover at work. He’d be liable to take a hand off with heavy machinery.
“Yes.”
Dean follows after him, not in the mood for Sam’s cheerleading attempts. “Fuck off. I’ve practically turned into Dad at this point.”
“M’ not letting go,” Dean says. “Never letting go.”
“I know what you’re doing Cas, it won’t work,” Dean warns, eyes still shut.
After more than a decade he still can’t believe people pay him to do this shit. It had all the mystery and allure of fieldwork, minus the gore. His leg probably isn’t going to get fucked up again either. A great bonus of being a desk jockey.
series,” Cas says.
“Do the tomatoes usually explode when you come?”
“We’re not a thing,” Meg says out of the blue. Dean’s face must register his surprise. “You think very loudly. Look, Castiel is a close friend. We’ve been through a lot. We’ve worked together for years but I’m definitely not his type. He’s not mine either. I’m happy he’s found someone,” Meg says.
“Is everything okay,” Jack asks, sounding worried.
Dean and Cas relax afterwards. Dean stretches his feet up on the table. “I’ve been thinkin’ about talking to Sam. About my plans.”
“The timing belt liquified instead. Don’t worry though. I can reverse it. Most likely. I’m close, Dean. It’s nearly indestructible.”
“I imagine there will be some matters I need to take care of at the nursery even though Meg assures me Nora has handled my duties well. Jack will be home from college for a few weeks. The beach in summer is actually quite nice. We could relax there if you wish,” Cas says, already on his second cup of coffee.
There has to be cans of green beans or carrots left in their apartment. Sam eats nothing but rabbit food anyway. He can make his damn smoothies from that.
“No, you can’t sit in mine. I'm driving. We’ve talked about this. Don’t coil on his head, you know he doesn’t like that,” Jack explains. That’s enough for the snake because Nougat obeys, slithering in Dean’s general direction, still staring intently into Dean’s eyes. Dean’s sure Dad is spinning in his grave with a witch driving his beloved car and Dean serving as a familiar’s seat cushion.
The geysers are something else. The Grand Prismatic Spring is just as colorful as the guidebook reported. It smells a whole lot worse too. Cas is set to drag Dean on another lap of the park but Dean insists they rest at Old Faithful.
“Sure, pal. I’d love to if that’s what you want. Sam owes me anyway so I can take the time off.”
Cas might volunteer the information himself once he trusts Dean more or an opportunity might present itself. Whatever happens, Dean knows to be careful. Cas is the best thing to happen to him out here. He doesn't want him to leave. If Dean is being honest with himself he wants more from his relationship with Cas.
best friends. Friends give each other nicknames. Really added depth to our story,”  Dean tells him.
Castiel looks back at the house, “I hardly think it’s appropriate to make a guest work. However, if you insist, I do have a list of required repairs and upkeep.”
“You picked it out,” Cas said, trying not to laugh.
“So you are an alien?” Dean asks, diving right in.
“Well, it’s done for. You should probably call for a tow,” Dean tells him, leaning over the hood.
Are you available Dean? 👀 Dad’s working late tonight and my truck is out of commission at the moment. 😩 I’m supposed to meet with the robotics team in half an hour to test our latest build.
“They teach you to be that eloquent at Stanford?” Dean teases. “I, uh, do appreciate it though.”
“You should consider discussing this with your friend. It could be beneficial.”
Maybe they should have let Eileen decide all along. He would carry off those sunglasses so well.
“See!” Dean gestures at Jack, “The kid likes it.”
She gives him a comforting look, “What you told me. I don’t need to know what you saw Dean. Many people value the privacy of their dreams. Given your symptoms, I think it’s likely you do have LO-HGM.”
“I cannot believe people pay actual money for these classes,” Dean teases. At least Sam follows safety protocols and didn’t blow his home to kingdom come.
Dean tries to think about something else. The drive back to town is several hours. It will be after midnight when they get back.
“I suppose it’s time,” Cas says, regrettably getting off Dean’s lap. Cas grabs the extractor and puts the needle against his neck.
Cas gently places a piece of paper in his hand. “The Milton Family and Familiars” is written across it in Cas’s terrible handwriting. “You're giving me a cheat sheet for your family?”
It takes a bit to forge the paperwork. Dean Winchester is both dead in twenty-three states and wanted for various felonies in another twenty-seven. Cas doesn’t exist according to the state of Kansas.
. The X-wing in the swamp. Believe in yourself, my padawan.”
Cas gives Dean a little wave as he starts to help the next customer in line, a scruffy-looking young man.
“You sure you don’t mind me crashing here?” Dean asks. Even after Cas told him he wanted Dean to stay, he can’t help but ask repeatedly if it's okay. He desperately wants to be here but it feels like he is intruding on Cas’s life.
Sam narrows his eyes at this new fact. Dean doesn’t acknowledge it.
He picks an alabaster short-sleeve button down for tonight. He likes to wear neutral colors in contrast to his soul marks. The summer garden is growing steadily on his back. The greenery of carrots, beets, and garlic wrap around his spine, cherry and apple trees are rooted near Laurelin’s base. From the thicket of bermudagrass, yarrow, lilies, and dahlias are emerging. So many dahlias. The festive bunch on his shoulders included Kelvin Floodlight, Babylon Red and Purple, and a small path of Dazzling Magic. It would no doubt expand during the evening. It was one of Dean’s favorite varieties.
They had drinks together every week on Dean’s front porch. Cas had given him a picture. It was a wallet-size photograph of all of them. Cas, Dean, Claire, Jack, and the rest of the flock at the party celebrating Cas’s certification. Claire was holding Honey and Bee, Nougat lay limp around Jack’s neck, and Colette perched on Cas’s hand. Anna wasn’t on Cas’s shoulder though where she practically always was, she was on Dean’s, all puffed up.
“Dad’s thinking about a smart car,” Jack helpfully provides.
“No. I will not allow them to do that to you,” Cas snaps. Anna cries out somewhere behind Dean. Cas takes notice of her distress and exhales, the tension easing in his shoulders. “They can be difficult to be around. I would feel better about this whole thing if you were with me. We could take time for ourselves too. I doubt my children will want to attend a cooking class with me.”
Cas glances down to see the Dahlias have sprung up among the summer grasses on his arms. The flowers are almost down to his wrist. They twirl around each other in bunches of three and or four, all leaning left. To where Dean is sitting.
“No. You get to piss off to Stanford for four years but when I want some time for myself, suddenly I can’t have it?” Dean didn’t mean to say that. Well, not like that.
Cas frets about Jack. He is concerned about his sleep, if he is stressed out, if he is eating actual food and not just cheap ramen. The typical stuff parents must worry about or Dean assumes it is. Dad wasn’t exactly the best example. Cas restrains himself in front of Jack but Dean thinks it’s good for Cas to have someone else around to listen. Cas does the same for him.
A soft sound rings from Anna’s travel carrier in the seat next to him. She’s been glued to him the entire day, snuggling tight against him and petting him with her wing like he was a frightened animal. Even now, in birdy prison, she appears more concerned about him than being confined.
A loud squawk confirms Anna does indeed know that. Cas leans close to the phone, glancing over his shoulder to make sure Anna doesn’t hear. “The pups are pretty cute though.”
Places like this were for people with fucked up soul marks or needy couples that realized being Bonded meant jackshit if you didn’t put in the work. Since he had neither a soul mark nor was he Bonded, there was no logical reason for him to be here.
It takes them a while to get back to the bed, too distracted by soft touches and hungry kisses. When Cas finally gets Dean naked, his mouth goes dry. Dean is already fully erect, the head of his penis glossy with precome, his testicles heavy and tight.
Mount Shasta hasn’t changed all that much since he was last here. Same hippie dippie nonsense. Same crystal shops. Jody and Donna’s bar remains packed with tourists and locals complaining about the tourists. Dean is thankful he isn’t bartending this year.
Sammy’s awake. Not because he has to be but because he’s a freak who likes to go for runs at the ass crack of dawn.
Yet, for the first time in his life, he can’t muster the willpower to hunt. It seems pointless now. There’s more people these days, with more skills and resources. Dean isn’t getting any younger.
“You know anything about pool?” Dean begins. He’s gonna have to gauge Cas’s reaction.
“I know what I want.”
Dean stiffens, “That thing, Sam, has a name. I raised you better than that.”
Cas looks at himself in the mirror, tilting the hat around. “Is it?”
Dean lifts his eyebrows in surprise, “Cas told you?”
“I assisted Dean,” Cas corrects. The condors are greedily eyeing the hunk of meat in the zookeeper’s arms.
Dean describes the case in detail as he finishes dinner. Cas goes to put his birds to bed before they eat, it’s late enough as it is and birds need a hell of a lot of beauty sleep. He sings softly to each one every night because he’s a sentimental sap. Anna stays up though. She doesn’t need as much sleep as normal birds, a quirk of being a familiar. She sleeps when Cas sleeps.
“Of course I love you, Dean. I wish to be with you for as long as you’ll have me.”
Dean raises his eyebrows in a silent question.
“Oh.”
Bobby would tell Dean that Cas “is an odd one” and leave it at that. Not helpful.
By the time they arrive at Crater Lake, there is a growing list of activities to do. Cas wants to go around the Rim Drive, the road’s just opened. Dean is going to fish, Cas is looking forward to taking a boat ride to Wizard Island. Dean actually puts a hike on the list. The Watchman Peak Trail. He drove all this way, he is getting his majestic panoramic vistas.
They stop at Meteor Crater on the way to Tombstone so Cas can observe the large hole in the ground. Cas did agree to drive all the way across the state so Dean can stay at a private ranch and play cowboy for a few days so Cas can look at all the bizarre rock formations he wants as far as Dean is concerned.
hangs in the air. Dean would wink if Jack wasn’t right there.
The man adjusts his glasses, “No. That can’t be right. My wife says that would take hours.”
Cas leans into Dean, “This is our life. I want it to be good.”
Casl takes the device in his hands, “It is a grace extractor. I do not have much grace left to begin with. It will do the job.”
“No sir,” Dean and Sam say in unison. Like they’re gonna take anything from an old man on a fixed income. They both have respectable jobs now, well Sam’s a part-time student at the local college but it’s close enough.
“Cas, you awake?” Dean whispers.
“It was an oversight,” Dean mutters.
Speaking of which, Cas and Eileen have been missing for hours now. Dean’s sure they’re up to no good. He’ll investigate later, right now he’s content to hang out with his dumbass little brother.
“I want pancakes Dean,” Jack mutters.
Cas sighs, eyes flicking across the store. “He’s been here for an hour. I don’t think that man has looked at a map in his life.”
Jack perks up at the mention of breakfast. Michael probably fed him whole wheat toast or oatmeal. The kid needs some real food to get over his cold.
“You’ve said that about the last five I showed you,” Dean complains. “Maybe I want to look like that. They have a miniature golf course onboard.”
Adjusting his hat to better cover his eyes, Cas tilts his head toward Dean. “I regret to inform you that is exactly what I am.”
They eat dinner in the shade by the garden, falling into their easy rhythm. They talk about Jubilee, the upcoming school year, Cas’s worries over tenure. By the time the sun begins to set, Dean is listening intently as Cas reviews his autumn garden plans.
“Shoot buddy, I’m all ears.”
Without thinking he answers. “No, but I’d prefer a room closer to the elevator.”
Relief settles in Dean’s bones. He’s glad Sam is on board with his plans. He just needs to make sure Sam really understands what Dean is saying.
The wind picks up a bit, forcing Cas to grab his hat. “I was upset with Gabriel for springing this on me without due notice. However, I do find myself tempted. Gabriel sent me the itinerary. There’s so much to do. The cooking with magic class looks particularly interesting and I haven’t had a vacation with both my children since Claire started hunting,” Cas explains.
“That’s my girl,” He tells her as he brings her to Cas’s screened-in back porch. He goes back to get the other two.
Their sleigh is pulled by two giant chestnut horses, Belgian Drafts according to the tour guide.
“I helped create several types of vultures,” Cas tells Dean, stealing the last of the cotton candy.
Alone.
Cas sighs and closes the laptop. He moves to get out of bed, motioning for Dean to follow. Cas makes tea in silence. Dean sits at the dinette and waits till Cas puts his herbal tea in front of him.
Cas shakes his head. Now is not an appropriate time. Maybe later, after he knows Dean is okay. He has a new glass plug he’s been meaning to try.
Dean remembers very little of his mother. Softly spoken words here, a blurry memory of his fourth birthday party, going to get a Christmas tree, the year Sammy was born and watching in delight as Dad cut down a big Douglas Fir and hauled it to the car.
Dean will be escorting him to the local big box store tomorrow though so he can buy himself some actual clothing. Dean has only got so many sweatpants.
Dean pokes the travel carrier, “Your bird’s gonna kill me Cas.”
“I’m sick.”
Anna had told him once. He had picked the name Castiel for a reason. When the two curved lines first emerged at the tender age of fourteen, he fancied them like the Two Trees of Valinor, Laurelin, and Telperion. The one on his left shoulder blade was lighter in color than the right. Gabriel may have mocked him but the metaphor was very apt in his humble opinion.
Before they leave Singer Automobile, Dean gets an idea.
Jeopardy places loudly on Dean’s ancient TV set as they do the dishes together. “I’m gonna go talk shop with your Dad,” Dean yells over to Jack as he scrubs the last dish. “There’s ice cream in the freezer.”
He hears Cas’s quiet snort behind him. “That was unnecessary.”
Cas’s eyes narrow in confusion. “Prove it?” He repeats.
Dean expects Cas to tell him to get lost. Or maybe a polite thanks but no thanks. Cas doesn’t seem the overtly rude type. He likes the guy though, maybe they can do other touristy crap around Jackson before Cas flys out.
The ornament is a wooden snowflake, with a relief of Wizard Island in the center. Dean nods, “It’s perfect, kid.”
It started with the nightmares, or lack thereof. Since Cas has been sleeping with him, he doesn’t wake up covered in sweat, heart pounding. He sleeps through the night. Since he started traveling with Cas he hurts less. He’s had aches and pains since he was a teenanger. They are still there but less so. The water tank holds 33 gallons. Good for a few days. It lasts longer than it should. The sorta mind reading. The Continental running on some sort of miraculous power. Cas’s comments about the moon.
“You still work there?” Dean asks. He’s curious and Cas did offer this about himself.
The sound of a scream fills the terminal, Dean’s head jerk’s toward the source.
He answers no to all of them.
“This is way better than the movies,” Dean says, kissing the side of Cas’s temple. “Lean forward will you? I want to check if anything is happening.”
“There many mandatory Milton activities planned?”
Dean’s smiles widely, even as he ducks his head. “Always the charmer, aren’t you sunshine?”
Dean returns Cas’s smile with a dopey grin of his own. It’s moments like these that it takes all his willpower not to go over and kiss Cas gently on the lips. The way married couples might greet each other after being apart.
“Are there really aliens?,” Dean asks, maybe a little too enthusiastically.
“Alright Colette, you wanna step up for me?” Dean asks as he opens her aviary door. She studies him thoroughly before putting one birdy foot on Dean’s hand and then the other.
Well, that must mean only one thing. Dean turns around to look at Cas. Guy looks adorable in his floral pajamas and bed-head.
Cas looks like a kicked puppy. Hell, how many times has Cas died only to come back and Dean just acts like nothing happened. Dean knows now. Cas loves him! All Dean has to do is open his piehole and repeat the same words.
“I used to be. I was sent to kill the dumbass. He killed every other demon with me. Left me alive and threatened to tear me apart if I didn’t help him. He was alone and struggling to navigate in the human world with Jack. Lucifer was going to kill me anyway. At least Castiel was offering a way out. So I stayed,” Meg explains, glancing back at the office where Cas is busy fighting with the computer.
Joy shoots through Dean’s veins. Cas picks up on it because he gets a goofy smile on his face.
“Fine. You’ve made your point,” Dean concedes. He grabs the churro as Charlie moves to snatch it up.
“So they can leave you on the side of the road for hours? Where are you?” Dean says, clearly exasperated at Cas’s very reasonable plan. “I’ll pick you up and get Benny to tow it in.”
“Yeah?” Dean mutters, half asleep.
“Me too. Me too. So can we agree I’m not Mimikyu?
They do whatever they want all day. Dean makes dinner most nights, Cas’s talent for cooking seemingly limited to reheating various dishes. Dude is an amazing baker though. Dean almost wishes they had a real kitchen. They do the dishes together before doing their own thing.
Cas nods, seemingly accepting Dean’s answer.
That gets him an over dramatic eye roll.
“It has been a very pleasant experience,” Cas says fondly.
“You dragged me to REI for this didn’t you, you sick son of a bitch. I’ve already got the gear. I might as well pal around the outdoors with a couple of angels at this rate,” Dean says, trying to glare at Cas without taking his eyes off the road. It’s not working.
The kid’s face contorts in anger. “Man, what the fuck? They’re not buying the booze. I am.”
The lights return to normal.
Cas reaches across the table, gently squeezing Dean’s hands. “I meant when we were kids.”
“This geyser is only well known due to its predictable timing. I wish to try and see if any black bears are out in Hayden Valley at sunset,” Cas huffs as they sit on the benches near Old Faithful.
“It would appear so.”
, I wanna talk.
And there’s Cas at the counter, bent over a map with an old geezer. There’s a line forming, everyone impatient with the man.
It shouldn’t hurt but it does.
The car is officially announced dead at 11:43 AM. The needed repairs could take weeks, if they can get it running at all. The old mechanic delivers the news, grim faced. Cas is greatly saddened by his car’s untimely demise.
There’s just the whole navigating his relationship with Cas thing. Since he’s been back, they’re  stuck in a holding pattern. Dean needs to talk to Cas about the whole “forgot to mention the deal I made with the Empty because I didn’t want to burden you and then declared my love for you to avoid you dying” thing. If they’re gonna do this, Dean needs Cas to stop trying to go it alone. Cas isn’t alone.
“I have no idea. It’s been years since we went to a reunion. Anyway, there was Milton family drama and Uncle Gabe was the only one to volunteer to plan it this year. I don’t know what they were talking about on the phone but Anna was screaming the entire time.”
It didn’t matter anymore. Dad was dead.
Dean explains why he’s in town. Well he says he's on an extended road trip. The exact reasons don’t need to be said. He’s looking for work, least till spring rolls around.
“You one of Lucifer’s lackeys?” Dean asks. It seems the most likely explanation.
They do finally close on that ugly house. The first order of business will be to paint it a new color. Dean’s thinking cobalt blue. There’s no HOA to stop him. He is looking forward to actually seeing the sun in the mornings.
Dean’s classes don’t start until fall. He got himself accepted in Seattle. Dean may have cried a little bit. One tear. Cas was weeping into a pile of tissues, which was unexpected since Cas wasn’t a crier but Jack assured Dean he had been like that when Jack got accepted.
“Hello, Dean. Thank you for coming,” Cas says, mirroring Dean’s smile. They gaze at each other for several long moments before Cas clears his throat, “How was your trip?”
Dammit, reading with Jack was Dean’s thing. Motherfucker was trying to replace him already.
Dean gives Sam an incredulous look, “Yeah, Gertrude has to live somewhere. Cas doesn't like the taste of store-bought eggs. The old girl is getting up there in age. We’ll need more chickens soon. And Jack’s ducks. You think Michael is gonna take care of Mr. and Mrs. Quakers, Oona, Tow Mater, Nugget, or Allie.”
Yet another reason why they needed their own place. Jack could have his room and Dean could actually fuck Cas in a bed and not the backseat of the Impala, as he often did since it was one of the few places they could get some privacy.
The slushy machine was a no-go as well. Cas told him all about what people did to that machine. Dean hasn’t looked at it the same since.  Thankfully, the selection of potato chips is acceptable.
Dean glares, “I came here to get what I want.”
“Hello. Dean,” Anna mimics.
Dean dumps a load of ground coffee into the filter. “He text you? I think he’s kinda excited.”
“No. Nope. Just making sure we’re on the same page. I definitely want to stay. With you.” Dean assures him.
“Hmm, move?” Cas responds, half asleep.
After the trail ride, they stroll at their leisure through the park. They both smell like horses and Dean’s ass is sore but Cas starts one of his fun fact lectures. Dean learns that the Pacific coast is the only place in the world where coast Redwoods grow before Cas launches into an explanation of the bioregion. It’s just them, alone among the titans of the forest. The sound of Cas’s deep voice fills the air. Dean doesn’t want to be anywhere else.
The backroom is a shared office. The only sound is the faint hum of a fan and the angry clacking of keys. It shouldn't be this funny to watch an angel of the Lord trying to fight a computer.
There was nothing like that here. The place seems full of life. The hum of travelers during the day. Peaceful at night. Maybe that’s why this abomination had chosen to hide away here.
Cas clammers up the stairs to Dean’s bed, blanket and pillow in hand.
Castiel isn’t moved by Dean’s anger. “You’re desperate and Heaven took advantage of that. Your plan would not have worked. Heaven simply sought you out to clean up loose ends.”
“My car refuses to start,” Trench Coat says.
Dean doesn’t quite know what Jody is trying to tell him. “So I should let strange men into my car?” he ventures, half-joking.
Cas’s words rattle around in Dean’s head. He can barely get out the words, “You love me?”
Dean swats at Cas, “It’s not that bad. You’re gonna tell me I need to use my words aren’t you? I can see it in your face.”
Dean yawns. He’s tired suddenly. An angel of the Lord projecting directly into his noggin’ probably has something to do with that.
Anna flies over to land on Claire’s shoulder. Her eyes pin at the sight of the pattern.
The fish is a dinky one. Catch and release. Dean’s damn proud of himself for holding it together. When he thinks about it, he’s handled worse. He survived a demon ripping him to shreds. He can handle this. No problem.
“Don’t take this the wrong way. You’ve lived with the guy for over a year. You spend every day with him. You run a B&B together. I kinda just assumed something was up but you’re always so touchy about these things,” Sam says. Dean can almost hear the smirk.
“You hadn’t told me everything?” Dean ventures.
“You sure about this?” Sam asks. “You know you have a place with Eileen and I.”
“Yes,” Cas says.
The doc’ just waits. He musters as much brainpower as he can right now. “Why didn’t this happen sooner? And don’t give any crap about multiple possibilities or unknowns. What’s your best guess?”
“It’s gonna be a disaster,” Claire says, smirking. “Anyway, are we done chit-chatting? I’ve got plans tonight and I need to wipe the floor with everyone before that.”
He’s awakened by a quiet knock on the window. Cas is there looking longing into the Impala, He’s not got his trench coat. Excellent, Cas is definitely in the mood. The coat is another layer to deal with.
Sam is fumbling to get the blender out. “Yeah. I got that impression.” He sets the blender down before pulling his phone out and scrolling throw his texts. “Here, just look. I can’t read this out loud.”
Dean almost chokes on his ramen, “Dude, those places cost like a million a night.”
“You want me to lie to a motor club?” Castiel asks, eyebrows raised.
Dean’s Top 13 Zepp Traxx plays on the stereo. One of the mixtapes he made when Sam was still at Stanford. Dean had made a lot of mixtapes during that time, he needed the music to distract him from everything else in his life. Sam had found it in the bottom of one of the banker boxes full of his cassettes. He wonders how it ended up there, the mixtape is great. Some of his best work.
“It’s tingling,” Cas observes. “It feels like coming home. I think that’s very cinematic.”
Dean’s resolve gives way. He needs a break anyway. It’s Friday afternoon. The damn deadline isn’t until next week and if he reads one more word of Latin, he’s going to explode.
“This will be easier if you also remove your shirt,” Cas says as he fiddles with the buttons on his own, trying to muster the dexterity to continue.
He doesn’t want to spoil the mood.
Cas sighs, a little over dramatically, and steals some fries from Dean.
A delightful pink blush spreads across Dean’s cheek. Cas chooses his next words with care. “There're many wonderful ways to have sex. We can do whatever we want”
“I can see why you told me this was an emergency. Don’t you leave soon?” She asks as she surveys the room. All the crap he needs for the trip is neatly laid out. Clothing for every weather event possible, proper footwear, swim trunks, some nice clothes for the fancy events, his meds, extra toiletries, and a metric fuckton of hand sanitizer. It’s not the pack light philosophy he used to live by.
Cas is awake, he doesn’t sleep all that much to begin with. Still, he lies in bed with Dean each night. A solid weight against his back, breath warm against Dean’s ear.
Dean sighs and turns over to lay on his stomach.
Dr. Mills squeezes his shoulder, but it barely registers, “Like, you know how we met? I fell on my ass. A few years back, I got the brilliant idea to go back to school in my thirties. Second to last semester at the university and I’m bustin’ my ass every day to get to class on time after I got off my shift at the garage. I was working a ton of hours, slogging away at school to get this damn piece of paper. Anyway, it’s dumping, I forgot my coat, and I try to cut through the library. Slipped on the stairs outside. I sat there for what felt like hours. Cas claims it was like ten seconds. I was just ready to lose it. Until I feel someone grab me and haul me to my feet. Cas is really strong.”
“I don’t know. If I got anywhere near a torch, I would be liable to burn my hand off.”
Dean doesn’t say anything, letting a gentle silence fall between them. His earlier fears fade away in the quiet of the Impala. Cas reaches for the tupperware again to stuff another bite into his mouth.
had more clients than ever before.
Castiel is beside Dean in an instant. He seems taller than he usually is. His wings, all six, are flared in challenge.
Dean had seen plenty weirder things than that but there was an underlying current of power to Castiel’s actions. An unknowable energy just under the surface. It didn’t feel like magic. Not any kind Dean had ever encountered.
They stop by the Condors of the Columbia exhibit. Cas wanted to see the feeding demonstration. He insisted it was educational.
Cas gives Dean a sympathetic smile,  “That was the album version. How about the single?”
you.”
Dean.
Cas hugs Jack until he can’t breathe and tells him to text when he arrives in Seattle even though flying there takes him all of five seconds. Jack agrees anyway.
Cas’s face lights up with a lop-sided smile. His eyes crinkle at the corners. Dean never wants to stop looking.
to distract Jack long enough so he can help Cas to bed. Cas insists he’s fine but Dean rubs his back until he’s out cold.
Dean encourages Cas to tell him more. He grabs the thermos back and continues. Cas describes the event and the aftermath. He gets enthusiastic describing the geology of Wizard Island. It’s good to see him like this. They keep talking, swapping stories. Cas gets a kick out of the time Dean and Sam had to chase dragons all over Oregon. It turned into a convoluted mess when Dean accidentally blew up the dragon killing sword.
“I told you, I’m an incarnation of the angel Castiel. I have a human body.”
“Professionally, I would tell you it doesn’t strictly need to be a romantic interest. Any strong bond can trigger LO-HGM. If we are using your scale though, we’re on the marriage material end of things.”
Cas cranes his neck back as far as he can, “The name isn’t literal.”
And Michael as usual is sitting above it all, on the patio observing everything from upon his throne and generally being useless.
Michael scoffs, “I’m not in your head. Castiel’s text was perfectly clear on his intent if the amount of emojis were anything to go by.”
Of course Gabriel would do something like that.
Cas squints, “Umm, sad pensive face, distraught face, distraught face. I have to fill in for the night shift tonight. Loudly crying face. Red angry face. Jack is with my family. Please come by if you have time.”
“I believe you left it in my camping gear after our last trip,” Cas says. “I’ll go grab it.”
Cas must draw the line somewhere. Dean would rebuild the car practically overnight if Cas let him. “Let Benny inspect the damage and give me a quote. No use in repairing it if I’m going to purchase a new vehicle anyway.”
One night, Dean discovered the angels were watching over him. They appear in his dreams. Thousands. Millions. A mass of wings, flames, and eyes.
Dean is ready to throw himself out of the truck and the song hasn’t played even twenty times.
Shit. He doesn't know how Rufus is going to respond to that little fact. Also, it’s not a fact because Dean is not married to Cas. Not at the moment.
Dean gives Sam a look.
Jack comes home around 10:30 pm and wolfs down the burgers Dean cooked for them. It’s Dean’s cue to go back to his own home. It’s all of thirty feet from Cas’s front door but Dean hates leaving most nights. He wants to follow Cas up to his bedroom and fall asleep in his arms.
Cas squares his shoulders, ready for battle. He goes into the back room, muttering about unpaid invoices.
Cas turns away for the first time. “This is a vessel, my body once belonged to a man named Jimmy Novak. He passed away some time ago.”
Cas squirms impatiently as Dean applies some hair wax. He keeps some in the Impala because it’s the only thing that keeps Cas’s hair in place.
(See the end of the chapter for
. He’s made Dean sing it for him a million times.
The tow truck driver can’t be bothered to care as he loads the Continental.
first. Everything else looked terrible. Pokémon was a stupid kids movie but it was hardly the worst way to spend ninety minutes. It was better than getting beat up by vamps.
Sam kicks Dean under the table and mouths “language” at him. Right, the kid. “Jack is clearly the mewtwo-iest among us. Go on.”
“The elk have wintered here for thousands of years,” Cas whispers. “They migrate to the valley for better access to food and protection from severe winter weather.”
Dean’s half-way through his beer and not feeling any better when Cas comes back. He takes one look at Dean and frowns. Is he really that obvious?
Cas smooths back Dean’s hair from his forehead, his eyes shine with warmth and amusement. “No Dean, only that you have faith. You are a loving partner and caring father, even if you cannot see it sometimes.”
“I’m fine, Cas. What in the hell was that? I thought the angels didn’t like to get too close to your bad vibes,” Dean asks, wiping the dirt from his jacket.
Castiel doesn't look offended. “I didn’t fall Dean. I left.”
“Hand me the screwdriver,” Cas barks at his brother. He spent almost a decade in university. He can handle some furniture.
“What?”
Jody’s story is based on an anecdote from Colin Dickey’s The Unidentified: Mythical Monsters, Alien Encounters, and Our Obsession with the Unexplained.
That didn’t stop him from indulging in more passionate fantasies occasionally. He thought about waking up with Dean, kissing him leisurely, opening him with his fingers, perhaps his mouth. Lord in Heaven, how beautiful Dean would be moaning beneath him as Cas made love to him.
Dean laughs, “Has anybody ever told you that you are very odd?”
His angel just has to be a smart-ass doesn’t he.
What can Dean say to that.
“You’re going to subject Anna to this? She’s innocent. Plus she’s going to bite your hand off the minute you try to dress her up.”
Meg leans across the counter. “Look, I’ve known Castiel since I tried to kill him.”
Dean’s contemplating if murder is legal for jackasses who go fifty-five in the passing lane when Cas interrupts his thoughts.
“Do you truly not know what I am? You’re a seasoned hunter. I must admit I have very little experience with your community. I had presumed hunters would know of us,” Cas remarks.
Cas gets up, walks right over to Dean’s booth and plops down across from him.
Maybe a little. But Cas is a weird guy. He agreed to go road tripping with a stranger. What’s a little bed sharing.
Cas looks at Sam in bewilderment. Dean squirms.
“I saw a lovely place across from the Elk Refuge, on the map. They may have a vacancy,” Cas says, pointing vaguely north.
“No Sherlock it isn’t. You’ve been acting weird. And I don’t mean Cas weird. I mean weird weird. I need to know what’s up man.”
The guy doesn’t seem to be bothered by Dean’s flustering, he gives a polite smile, “Castiel.”
Dean should resist but he does like the part where Cas is putting his hands all over him. It’s a sacrifice he’ll have to make. Dean rests his head against his arms and closes his eyes.
“I am not touchy...” Dean begins, before stopping himself. Sam’s such an asshole.
Well, at least Dean knows he can hang around with Cas for a few more weeks. He’s excited to meet Jack and see Cas’s home. He’ll figure the rest out later.
Cas grabs Dean’s face, forcing him to look directly into the angel’s eyes. “The home buying process typically involves a mortgage. A mortgage would require us to be married.”
“They are very practical for all seasons and water resistant” Cas had told him about the pants. Dean didn’t care how practical they were, they look ridiculous. He definitely does not notice how well they hug Cas’s thighs.
“Umm, we just made it official official, Jack,” Dean stammers. Jack nods, seemingly satisfied by the explanation.
Instead Cas sits on the couch. He’s barefoot and in sweatpants. All that lays in front of him is a large looking syringe.
Dean makes the mistake of glancing up. Cas is smiling, a real one. The one where the corners of his eyes crinkle. “I missed you, my love.”
“Very well,” Cas growls out. Dean is about to apologize for insulting his silly knife when he’s hit in the face with a wall of feathers.
Dean thinks, searching desperately for anything to refute Cas’s claim.
Still nothing. He’s after a fallen angel. Those disgraced by Heaven for their disobedience. The books had said Dean would
“I think I did,” Cas murmurs, almost an afterthought.
“It's just Dean,” he corrects. “You only get to call me that if you’re one of my students.”
Cas rubs a hand over his face, “There’s nothing to say, Dean. You’ve made your feelings clear."
Jody looks fondly at Donna and rolls her eyes. “We still take cases now and then. Mt. Shasta’s full of the supernatural. I’m sure you’ve read the brochures.”
That life will always be a part of him. He is still Dean Winchester. He’s just got a life now, a life that he wants. He gets to share it with Cas.
He opens his mouth to point out that he’s not even applied yet when he is interrupted by a whack to his head.
Cas snorts, “No Dean, you’re definitely Mimikyu.”
“A tad.”
The employee’s eyebrows squished together as if he had somehow picked up on Dean’s thoughts.
“Hello Dean,” he greets.
“I may have formed some opinions on the topic after Metatron. The original generation is superior in my opinion so I kept it to that,” Cas says.
“Son, get your boots off my table,” Jody scolds.
“You want me in your bed?” Cas asks, a little tentative. That won’t do.
An Alien.
They sit in the camper while Dean eats his road food and Cas munches on some bison jerky left over from Yellowstone.
That’s a lot to process. They are partners. It’s still so new for Dean to think about.
Dean would flip Michael off his if arms weren’t full at the moment with a young impressionable child. He needs to set a good example for Jack.
Instead, she asks some weird-ass questions. Did he ever faintly glow? Were certain colors more vivid around loved ones? Sounds? Smells? Did he cry soul juice? Did he experience memories that were not his own?
He smiles at Cas, “Show off.”
An older woman emerges from the kitchen to talk to the barkeep. She glances at Dean, her widening in recognition.
Focus. He needs to focus. Just because he’s reliving his silly crush doesn’t mean he needs to gape at Dean like a fish.
“How about spring. We could have a little reception here.” Cas says, not tracking.
“I know sweetheart. We’re gonna go with Cas to get some breakfast. Think that will make you feel better?”
Cas eats in silence for a moment, clearly hungry. Dean can’t stop staring at Cas. His heart aches at being with him again. God, Dean’s acting like a damn teenager. Cas makes him feel like this all the time.
“Thanks, Cas. I’m just happy to be home.”
Benny’s eyes dart between Dean and Cas. “Gotta say, you and hot wings here make quite the couple,” He laughs.
Sam lets out the world’s longest sigh, “Let’s review the evidence. You’ve known Cas for five years and have been joined at the hip for most of that time. You supported him after Luc and Kelly died and he adopted Jack. You’ve been raising said child with him for almost a year now. You freaked the fuck out over leaving them for a few weeks, and, I want to emphasize this, you called Cas your husband.”
What are you doing
Cas observes the boa. “I know. I’m sure he’ll defecate in the water bowl to show his displeasure when I do not provide him additional subsistence while you're away.”
Cas withdraws his wings, tucking them someplace. Another dimension most likely. The halo vanishes.
Dean can’t blame him. His sister-in-law is one hell of a hunter and has a much better personality than his jerk of a little brother.
Cas laughs but there’s a gentleness to it. “Tell me what you want. We can listen to anything you want, that I approve of.”
“Hold on,” Dean mutters as he fishes a crumpled-up piece of paper from his pocket. “Christ on a cracker.”
Sam smirks. His little brother is such an asshole.
Cassie is in Denver these days. She’s married but it's nice to see an old friend. They eat lunch at some new age cafe. She laughs when she hears he’s retired. Tells him that this life suits him. He doesn’t ask what she means by that.
Cas’s face tightens. “That’s a river.”
Cas comes shuffling in soon after Dean, which is odd. Usually Mr. Comatose isn’t out of bed before 10:00 am if left to his own devices. Dean bangs on his door after breakfast is ready most days.
“Any music after 1979 sucks ass.”
If Cas has to take a more direct approach, so be it.
“Yes, I have enjoyed our short time together. I think you will make an agreeable travel companion. I can always fly away should I tire of the open road,” Cas says, a small grin on his face.
Jesus Christ. This is fine. It’s fine. Blockers. No more headaches. Just what he wanted.
“When are you going to ask Cas to marry you?”
He messes with the hat all the way to the trailhead but he keeps it on. He even wears the bolo tie Dean gives him. The tour is interesting but Dean is mostly distracted by Cas. Dean maybe takes a few too many pictures of Cas with his horse.
The Wing and a Prayer Bed and Breakfast.
Dean’s eyebrows shoot up, “You love, you love me? Come on. Your marks react to fuckin’ everything. The weather. Whether someone annoyed you. A MARC field coded wrong. Indigestion,” he says desperately.
Charlie continues to scrolls through his phone “I thought Micheal swore off the reunion after he and Lucifer got into it?”
“What time do you want to go check on your car?” Dean asks, absentmindedly as he flips channels.
course I do Sammy
Cas wiggles his own, “You can let go if you would like to regain sensation in your extremities.”
Castiel lets out a sigh, “Most angels cannot comprehend me. My desire to remain on Earth. To fall. They wish to be rid of such deviations. Yet, they cannot stand to be around me. So they find others to do the work.”
“Hello. Dean,” she yells.
“By the creepy farmhouse?” Dean asks.
Dean swears his shoulder has somehow gotten rosier than before. Dr. Mills grabs at the edges of the oval-shaped outline. “Would you feel comfortable talking more about Cas?”
Hunting was a respectable profession for those who could put up with the long hours and constant travel. Claire loved it, even if she wasn’t constantly hunting demons as she once dreamed. Most cases were dealing with ghosts, the undead, anything shady involving the afterlife. Dean’s heard enough Ghostbusters jokes to last until the end of time, although it’s not that far off.
Well, Cas ain’t driving.
The Gas-n-Sip hasn’t changed in the last few weeks. It’s still lit by terrible fluorescent lighting. It’s worse than usual since several of the lights aren’t working. The aisles are tightly packed with junk food. There’s the one end cap full of questionable fruit. There are at least a dozen people here tonight, all shuffling about.
Cas dodges the towel effortlessly, “Of course, although I was wondering about our travel plans?”
Cas raises his eyebrows, “Demons exist. Do you truly believe angels cannot also be real? I assure you, I am very real.”
Cas gives his son a lopsided smile before letting go. He hugs Jack again. Dean doesn’t realize he’s just been watching these two when the oven beeps loudly, letting everyone know it’s preheated.
“You didn’t come here for nothing,” Dean answered.
So he’s been thinking of not real issues. Wild speculation.
Dean’s been living in his camper for a while. He’s not used a real kitchen in forever. Especially one with decent cookware. He makes Cas and him some roast chicken, scalloped potatoes, and salad. Cas insisted there be greens.
Jack hangs up and Cas is left alone. He glances down. One lone tulip pokes out from his cuff, its deep red hues almost shimmering in the low light of the evening.
At least Michael is doing something useful this morning.  He’s singing Jack’s favorite song to him, "Get Your Kicks on Route 66.” It’s from
Dean was taken aback. Soul marks manifested as pain in the front of the forehead before actually emerging on the body. Everyone knew that. And no one in the movies ever mentioned the runs.
By some miracle, Cas’s bedroom is slightly more toned down. He’s got nice cotton sheets and a comfy mattress topper. It’s not memory foam but it will do.
“Such as—”
Cas would bring him breakfast and coffee. It gave them some quiet time to talk about whatever. Cas’s complicated garden plans, Jack’s newest interest. Dean being forced to witness Sam’s awkward romancing of the town librarian, Eileen Leahy, the terrible things people do to their cars on the coastal highway. It was twenty minutes, just for themselves.
He doesn’t feel like that with Cas. Really there’s never been anyone like Cas.
Dean makes a show of checking Cas out. He’s tired but there’s a gentleness to his face.
Sam gives him an unimpressed look, “Imagine if the roles were reversed. You met Cas first. I come home one day and say I found the love of my life, her name is Eileen, and we’re moving out to start our own life. What would you say?”
There’s no one on the throne of Heaven. The realms of the afterlife start to disintegrate. A creation of Chuck. To be honest, Chuck’s Heaven and Hell were kinda dumb. There are some angels around. They’ll figure it out.
It kept going. At first, people gave them awkward looks. The soccer moms didn’t quite understand how Dean was just the neighbor even though he showed up to Claire’s games every weekend. But the more it went on, the fewer people questioned it. Folks assumed they were a couple.
Dean thanks whatever god there is that Cas can’t see most of his face. “You said you wanted to talk. A guy can’t help but feel a little worried,” Dean deflects, trying not to let his thoughts betray his fear.
“That was a joke, Dean.”
Dean shakes it off, he didn’t come here to complain about rude customers. He came to see Cas, except he can’t do that because a line of customers is starting to form behind him.
He’s not half assing it this time. They’re going to do a mule ride, the rafting tour, the North Rim, the Skywalk, and the Rainbow bridge. Cas makes sure they stop at every gift shop. Dean buys him a stuffed bighorn sheep since he wouldn’t stop staring at it.
“I love you, angel.”
Please don’t be…
When it’s ready, dinner is nice, the unholy concoction of beef, cheese, and chips do taste very comforting after today. The tulip hasn’t retreated completely from his wrist although his soul marks have settled, calmer now that Dean has returned to him.
“Sammy, I gotta ask, what the hell have you been up to? Why does it look like a meteor impact in the backyard?” Dean asks as he nibbles on his wrap.
Dean sighs. Cas lets a silence fall between them until Dean finally turns back towards Cas, “Look. We need to talk. It’s a lot so I want you to shut your piehole until I’m finished. Understand?”
The Lincoln Continental that Cas drove tended to break down so Dean started to fix it. Jack was fascinated by the work so Dean would let them help. Claire wanted to be a hunter and often tried to nonchalantly ask Dean about his hunting days.
Dean also teaches Castiel some things. How to work on cars. Castiel’s got some god-awful pimpmobile that he doesn’t maintain. Dean’s pretty handy around a kitchen. Castiel is a decent baker but Dean works with him on some of his techniques. Dean also discovers Castiel has zero taste in movies or music. They often spend evenings watching the classics or listening to the mix-tapes Dean makes.
Another nod followed his statement. Dean assumed that this meant he was in the clear, and swiftly brought the car to a halt.
The man nodded again, rolled the window up, and turned back to the driver.
He was almost ashamed.
Dean, however, noticed, and turned towards his companion with a slow exhale.
Warning: This chapter contains graphic depictions of violence. It is, however, plot relevant. Read with caution.
The hunter sounded sincere. Dean let the tension fall from his shoulders a little, and wiped at his face with the palms of his hands. He pressed his eyelids shut briefly, shook his head, and looked back at the hunter.
Into the duffel went the bolt cutter, and out came a semi-automatic handgun, loaded with bullets made from pure silver. It lay heavy in his hand, but he was used to the weight. It provided him security, something to hold on to. It had been a gift.
Dean waited for him to say something, but nothing followed his obvious attempt at gaining Deans' attention. He looked up at him again.
The door slammed shut.
Before they could start their work, Dean held a hand out. He turned to look intently at the man, who slightly cocked his head to the side in confusion. The motion seemed almost animalistic to Dean. He took a deep breath.
"I have been told that my behaviour is generally on the covert side of things. It does help with my job."
He was quickly beginning to contemplate whether a burial was even possible in these conditions. He might have to take the body with him until he could find a good place to stash it, a thought that he tried to banish out of his mind as soon as it came to him. No, he would dig the grave right here, even if it took him the whole night.
"I am hungry."
This idea was seemingly confirmed when Deans' eyes fell upon the scene in front of him.
"I am... unsure of how to respond to that. I have just saved your life. One would presume that this would not be a reason for cursing."
"Huh, it's really you. Don't know anyone else who talks like that."
The adrenaline had kept him from thinking too hard about the events that had just transpired, but now, as he was shuffling through his duffel to find cleaning supplies, he was slowly starting to think again.
"Vampires do not exist. The average person should be aware of that."
The outside didn't greet him with open arms. There were no howling winds or thick falling snow flakes, just a light sprinkle, but it was still bitter cold, and the thick layer of snow on the ground made walking on it a chore soon after Dean had stepped out from under the safety of the church roof.
"What?"
The hunter looked back at him, unblinking. A slight twitch in his composure, tension rolling off of his shoulders. A blink.
Lifting his head, he scanned his surroundings. The sun had long gone down, but he retained a vague sense of direction, finally landing on the direction he thought to be north. Visible through faint fog and sporadically falling snowflakes was the roof of a church. It was maybe two hundred meters down the road, standing seemingly abandoned against the dark background of the forest. Dean started walking, or rather tramping through the thick snow, still alert and keeping a tight grip on his duffel, but he tried to make himself seem relaxed. He didn't want to draw any further attention to himself, and he was sure that the bartender was watching him through one of the dust-caked windows of his shoddy, little home.
Dean wasn't one to gorge himself on others personal issues, especially when said others obviously didn't want to share their grievances, and so he accepted the blatant lie without question.
The hunter visibly relaxed now, and shook his head lightly. He turned back toward the countertop, and picked up his beer for the first time.
"Ah, you're a vet. Where'd you serve?"
Whichever it was, predator or prey, he had made his decision. He bowed down until he could look through the passenger window. And then he knocked.
Dean turned around abruptly, shaking his head, and made his way over to the crimescene. Many hunters had many different skills, this dudes might just be stealth.
"Name."
And so the man did in his stead.
Dean had raised his voice, and was now completely turned around so he could stare at the hunter, who tried to avoid his eyes at all costs.
Jack gives Dean a worried glance, “The case? Dad mentioned you were working on a big case this morning.”
Dean doesn’t play regularly. He’s not a nerd, it’s just something for the kid to enjoy. Dean plays it to kill time on the road, that is the only reason he’s almost at level 50.
“Oh, Jody, this is Cas. My boyfriend,” Dean says as he shoves Cas at Jody. She hugs him and demands to know how they met. She gives Dean quite the look when Cas describes Dean letting a strange man into his car back in Wyoming. Dean protests, it wasn’t exactly the same.
. If he wanted me, don’t you think he would have asked by now?
A familiar sensation pulses out from Laurelin and Telperion as Cas hums happily. “Thank you, Dean.”
Water goes flying everywhere as Gabriel snorts it out his nose. He laughs so hard he can barely talk.
“No, it’s because academica is also full of dumbasses who don’t communicate.”
Dean is proud that it was his idea.
Then again, Cas had traveled with him, of his own free will, the last several months. Invited him into his home, into his bed. Cas hadn’t said anything but had Cas ever dated someone? Maybe he just assumed Dean preferred not to talk about things. Which was true.
“Sammy,” Dean snaps. “We are talking about me. I want to take some time for myself. I think I’ve earned it.”
Jack takes out a piece of paper, “I want to know what you think of my list.”
“I’m sick,” Jack complains.
Jack is confused but moves on.
They drive northwest for another several days to reach Sawtooth National Forest. Dean was worried that bed sharing would make things weird. It’s a little awkward to wake up with another man in his bed but Dean actually sleeps better.
“Don’t worry. I got myself a AAA membership. They can get someone out here to tow this down to Jackson. We’ll just tell them that we were driving together. We're travel buddies. Two dudes finding themselves. Best friends.”
"If you need me, I'm outside."
"Dude, I didn't even hear you move. What's your deal, you a spy or something?"
But all the wishing didn't help. He was stuck, driving under 40mph, sometimes even slower, and was in dire need of rest. The sun had just peeked over the horizon when he had started his trip, so his mind was already wandering to dark places, but he couldn't stop, for fear of his frozen remains only being found weeks, if not months later.
The driver was frozen in place, not daring to move a muscle. He was scared. It seemed obvious in the way he acted, but he wasn't used to the feeling, not like this anyway. The threats he usually faced were familiar. He grew up with them, knew how to handle them. Knew how to handle the fear. It's a very particular type of fear, when you know exactly what's coming, and you've dealt with it many times. It scares you, but does so in a way that you know, that you can contain. This wasn't the case now.
He shook his head, turned his eyes on the road, and started driving again.
Chapter Three
Only a flimsy trenchcoat protected him from the creeping cold, dragging atop the thick layer of snow that was covering the ground. He gripped his coat tighter, wove it around his body in a manner that was supposed to protect from the icy wind, but the motion was only out of habit and didn't provide any warmth. The man had been walking in the snow for far too long, his steps growing sluggish over the course of the hike, dragging through the snow and carving a deep, wide trail into the formerly unbroken surface.
He looked back up at the stranger.
He had known that this werewolf wouldn't be the usual kind, but none of his sources had said anything about an immunity to silver. Instead, they had talked about the ability to transform willingly, and to keep a clear head while doing so. He had read about the alphas, the originals, and their direct offspring, monsters with special abilities and even more specialised knowledge. Knowledge he needed. Knowledge he had no way of getting, now that the monster was laying decapitated on the floor of a small church in the middle of nowhere.
He had grown from being disoriented, to grateful, to happy, to full of seething rage in an impressively short timespan.
The driver had only stopped a handful of times over the course of the day, to take a quick leek or go over the details of his task once more, doing so everytime that his hope was beginning to fade.
"I have use for you. For now. I.. do not know how to operate that vehicle."
The man in the trenchcoat turned around. The vehicle was almost in range, maybe 30 meters behind him, and it would soon overtake him. The man wasn't willing to let his chance of survival slide so easily. He had conquered places and challenges that most beings couldn't even dream of, and he wasn't about to die to a snow storm. The man took a deep breath, straightened his back, and stepped onto the road.
"..Alrighty then."
Dean was alone.
The man wished to copy its' indifference. He wanted to be unfazed by the cold. Wanted to look away without granting a second glance to suffering and pain. Out there, through freezing winds, and unbroken silence, and snowflakes that started to fall just now, he could almost achieve it.
The man turned to him, his expression unchanged.
His eyes turned back to Dean. They seemed a little less icy than before, but the sheer coldness that resided in them wouldn't falter.
The man nodded, the first movement of his in a couple of hours.
Unless, of course, the man was lying. Maybe he was a lunatic. Maybe he was confused, didn't know what was going on, mistook him for someone else. The driver was thinking himself into a panic, and blurted out the only thing that he could think of into the slowly growing silence.
"Yes, the Lycanthrope."
It had taken Dean a while to finally get out of his car, still shaken, and make his way toward the lonely light, which had been beckoning him closer since he'd arrived. He had a job to do, and he was on a tight schedule.
"It was a pleasure working with you", said the man through gritted teeth.
He knew the look on the face of his visitor. It may have been unassuming to the average joe, but for the bartender, it was like an open book, a tale untold, and oh so familiar.
The light was coming from behind him, illuminating every single one of the wildly dancing snowflakes, barely lighting the way through their denseness. It was also moving closer, and through the snowy plane, muffled by layers upon layers of ice, the man heard an engine. He jumped at the sound. Even moreso than the darkness, the silence had been prevailing for so long, hours, maybe days, and now it was disturbed, interrupted by the vehicle that was now slowly approaching through the snow. The driver was cautious, paid attention to where the road should be and where it dropped off, and went at a pace slow enough in order to not slip on the ice, but fast enough to maybe, hopefully, make it to the next town over, before the storm engulfed them entirely.
The man paused for a moment, then nodded, and he opened the car door. The freezing cold that greeted the driver was almost too much for him. He squinted his eyes and withdrew from the passenger side as far as he could without seeming rude. The man, however, seemed unfazed. He wasn't even wearing a hat. He calmly stepped inside, shaking off as much snow as possible beforehand, and closed the door behind him. The driver sighed with relief. He looked at the man expectantly. The man looked back, completely still, as if he wasn't sure what to do. The driver rolled his eyes.
"Thanks."
"I hope I did not scare you. It is in my nature, though not my intent."
Dean used the last of his strength to lift his head and look into the creatures eyes. Here, in the darkness of the church, he saw something strange. The faintest whisper of a blue light inside of the wolfs iris, like the flickering light of a torch.
"You are alive."
"Really? That where you hid after killing that poor bastard? Pretty small town, you were probably friends, weren't y-"
"There is no need for violence, officer."
The man was not without a home, per sé, but rather chose not to use it in favor of travelling the world, on search for... something. His wants and needs were obscure, difficult to describe, difficult to understand.
