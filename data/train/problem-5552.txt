to know about her father’s life before their family. Anything historical she could want to know was already inevitably written down in some biography somewhere, and the personal things were clearly just too painful.
“I’ve never really thought about this before,” Steve said slowly. Guilty—he couldn’t have Tony, another Tony, feeling guilty for something that wasn’t his fault. Tony locked eyes with him. Steve slid his away, staring at the ceiling again. That was easier than drowning in the duplicate of his wife’s eyes. “Tony. Being dead. I should have. We have—we have dangerous jobs. And Tony—Tony, she was terminal,
“Of course she did. Tony always came back. And Tony—she showed up, looking like she’d just stepped out of a magazine shoot instead of a battle, and part of me wanted to start in on the lecture—I think some of you could recite the lecture back to me—but I was just so relieved, I yelled at her about how worried we were that she wasn’t going to come back from that. And she stepped in really close, and we were at the top of the Empire State Building, and I don’t think you could have scripted a better romantic moment. So what does Tony do? She says to me, ‘Cap, you know I’ll always come back—’”
“Any boys?”
Later, in the privacy of his own room, he alerted J to the situation. He already knew, of course, but it eased Tony’s mind. At least one member of this household was looking out for the scrawny little kid.

“Yeah, about that—‘Tony Stark’—don’t tell me your parents named you Anthony anyway?” Tony asked wryly. 3490 Tony smirked.

“I get that this is supposed to be a good thing,” Tony murmured to him as some of the Avengers kids cheered, “but why do I feel like now we’re about to face down Bowser?”

a double of Danvers,” the bald man snapped. “Did you not hear me earlier? Get climbing.”
They arrived downtown pretty quickly, comparatively. Kate led them through the streets of Manhattan until they happened upon a single steel door with a bouncer stationed outside. There was no line. Kate pulled out three blue-and-purple laminated tickets. The bouncer just gave one nod and opened the door. The music of the club exploded outside. It had a strong beat, but it wasn’t any song James recognized. They wandered inside, standing on what appeared to be a catwalk above a basement level. The people in the basement were packed pretty tightly, dancing and grinding and all together making an interesting scene—one person was scaly, another kept changing her hair color, one kept lighting the air above him on fire. It was definitely a mutant club. There were stairs to the dance floor below, but also stairs to an upper level. James could see a bar and some more relaxed seating, but not many people appeared to be taking advantage of the plush leather seats. Nevertheless, that was where Kate headed first. James and Francis followed—might as well start with a drink or two. James wouldn’t feel the effects, but he could go for a beer anyway.
Peter was still wincing through dinner. That was not the face of someone whose parents had handled his medical care, that was the face of a kid still hiding an injury. And it made Tony angry. It made Tony

“It won’t help,” he said. “Pacing might, but you’ll give me the jitters, too. They’re contagious, you know.” Kate let out a breath she hadn’t known she was holding. The team was out for a routine mission.
“That is the least enthusiastic response I have ever heard,” Tony said.
“No, Steven, I don’t,” 3490 Tony said. “And neither would you if ever had to play bad cop with that child.”
. And Pepper Potts desperately coveted it.
Steve left before Tony could say anything else insulting.
“One in which you went underground after launching an attack on Latveria that they happily retaliated from,” Tony snapped. “One in which none of us have heard from you in over a year. One in which S.H.I.E.L.D. was left with a chain of command nightmare so the Captain and I took over. One in which you lost the right to criticize when you ducked and ran for cover.” Tony felt her blood boiling. There was so much she wanted to say to Fury—but then the anger cooled. This wasn’t her Fury. This was just some grumpy schmuck from some other universe. He might deserve her wrath for his condescension, but he didn’t deserve it for everything that had happened in the last two years. She smoothed her features into a calmer mask.
“Don’t tell me you already ran six miles,” Tony’s sarcastic drawl startled Steve so badly that he nearly dropped his toast.
. She cried from the fear of the whole situation, she cried from the rough hold of her nine-year-old brother’s arms, she cried because she was three years old and she wanted her teddy.
Kate wasn’t crying anymore, but she had the same expression that Peter wore. Their father and the others had already left, and they had taken the youngest kids with them. Kate stared at the television, not watching it. When had she eaten last? She’d had coffee that morning, but when had she eaten? When had any of them eaten last? James looked in the kitchen—some of the Alts were eating at the table. Billy and Teddy had joined them, and James could see some of the others eating elsewhere—sitting on the floor, or couches in the main room. Kate and Peter, of course, had obviously not had anything and didn’t look like they were moving any time soon. Someone had opened some cans of soup, warmed it up, and made some bread from the supplies they had—a feast in their little bunker. James was starving. He had been starving for three days; there wasn’t enough in storage for anyone to get supersoldier portions and none of them had known when their parents would return with more supplies. He knew Kate and Peter had to be hungry as well. He went into the kitchen, got out two bowls, filled them with the vegetable soup still steaming in a pot on the stovetop, and grabbed a pair of rolls. He ventured into the main room, and held a bowl out to his sister first. She didn’t even acknowledge his presence.
Clint hoped so. He glanced at his double. His wife was laughing at something he’d said. 3490 him was obviously captivated by her. Four kids. Clint couldn’t believe that until he saw them together. He felt a gentle hand on his knee. He met Natasha’s eyes, grateful for the anchor. They would have to be each other’s anchors for the time being. With nothing else to guide them, they would have to do. It wouldn’t be the first time.
. She could take care of herself. “It’s a bit like a bad trip at first, but you get used to it.”
“Hang on,” Tony said, swiveling on Steve, “I’m buzzed so I’m not surprised this didn’t occur to me earlier—but

“I’ve got it. I’m fine,” he snapped. Steve backed off, putting his hands out.
It was an echo, Steve knew. He’d heard that before—it came out of his own mouth. He wondered if he’d ever told James that story, ever used that exact wording—or if a younger version of his self, who was
“Then we’d all party on the bigger yacht all night, in international waters probably doing things that were only legal because of being international waters—why else go to international waters? I can hear her asking it. That would be more of Tony’s kind of funeral I think. But Tony… Tony was the least selfish person I’ve ever met. And Tony, when she planned all of this out years ago, when she made all the arrangements, she knew that she wasn’t going to be around to see her own funeral. She wasn’t going to be in a position to enjoy partying on a yacht all night. And she knew I wouldn’t want to be partying on a yacht after she died. She knew the
“Did you come to me because you need someone to moan at about the whole time travel thing and how much your life sucks because I’m really not the guy for that,” Tony said dryly. Steve’s jaw locked. He had a thousand things to say to this asshole and none of them were pleasant, except perhaps one, which was ‘maybe I did’. Steve didn’t know anymore. He didn’t have anyone to talk to. Did he need to talk? He would have talked to Peggy. He would give anything to talk to Peggy. He would make a deal with the Devil himself to bring Bucky back. He could talk to them. Sometimes he talked to Natasha. Or Natasha talked to him, or tried to set him up with women at SHIELD. But mostly he and Natasha just joked, or were busy running missions together. Natasha was probably the closest he had to a friend in this century. But Natasha wasn’t around.

“The first are from the wedding we did for the press—Iron Man and Captain America getting married, it was a big deal. So we did a public wedding in costume, and all our friends came, also in costume. But we did a private one, too, white dress and all, though I can’t say the symbolism really applied with that one,” Tony said as Other Steve flipped through the pictures. He paused for a long while on one in particular—it had been taken after the wedding, but still at the church. Steve was holding Peter on his hip, and she mirrored him with Kate. They were all laughing. Tony couldn’t quite remember why; Peter had said something unintentionally hysterical, she knew, but the knowledge had slipped from her mind with the years. Steve would know, she thought. Steve would remember what Peter had said. Steve remembered every detail of that day. Eventually young Steve handed the tablet back.
“Fair enough,” he agreed. “But Tony, those kids aren’t even there from six-thirty to four. Half the time they’re gone longer. You can’t take two hours a day in the presence of teenagers from a distance?”
“Steve,” he said. Steve took the offered hand.
James emerged out of the second tunnel; there were three entrances and two exits to the Manhattan bunker—one in the mall in Manhattan, one entrance that could be accessed by pulling the right lever in a barber shop (James didn’t know whose idea that one was, but he personally found it idiotic), and the final, this exit that James was taking through various tunnels that led to the basement of a warehouse in the shipping docks. He shut the door behind him, and a shelving unit slid back into place, concealing the door. The basement smelled strongly of fish, and it was packed through with canned goods. There were a few perishables on the shelf nearest to the door James had just come out of; James knew that this was the drop spot for supplies that his father and the Avengers had said they would establish. James passed it all and headed up the steps out of the basement and into the warehouse.
He wandered away, hardly noticed, and took a seat on the couch (which had been returned to the penthouse on popular demand—the decorator had obviously not thought things through very well) next to Azari and Henry Pym. Azari was James’ age, but he’d always been cool with Peter. Son of Black Panther and Storm, he had inherited electrical powers and had limited control over the weather. Peter had often been in awe of him as a kid—hell, he still was. Azari nodded to him as he sat down; a now decades old Christmas movie,
.” With that, Commander Rogers left the room, likely returning upstairs to where 3490 Tony rested. Steve let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was even holding.
“You feeling ok, Peter?” Teddy ventured.
“I don’t live at their house like you do. I’ve been there like, twice.”

He had only just felt himself drifting off when the blare of a siren startled him. He rolled off the bed in surprise, landing on the floor with a thump. He scrambled to his feet and opened the door.

“M’sorry,” Peter said in a small voice. “It’s my fault.”
. You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to.” James gave her a wry grin.
Bruce pinched the bridge of his nose and almost walked right back out.
“No problem,” Tony said. He walked off, shutting the door behind him. He wasn’t going to force the kid to tell his parents what was going on, after all. It wasn’t his business. But he could at least get him some basic first aid. Tony wandered back into the kitchen, ignoring the antics of his double and the extra Steve who were currently rocking out to ABBA while washing the dishes. At any other time he probably would have just regarded it as sickeningly, disgustingly adorable and probably would have suffered heaps of second hand embarrassment. But at the moment he felt only fury. Here they were, having a great time in the kitchen, while their
“I don’t want to watch it, Tony,” Steve said.
Tony demanded.
“Yup, total nerd, big nerd me,” Peter agreed. He opened the hatch, balancing his brother on top of him as best as he could, pulling him more upright. James tried to take more of his own weight on his good leg. Peter helped him down the stairs—every hop seemed to drain the life right out of him, and Peter could admit—to himself if not to James—that he was scared out of his mind. Peter pulled the hatch shut above them and then moved to the door to the tunnel. They went through but only made it a few steps before James slumped against Peter entirely, falling slowly to the ground. Peter just helped him down. “Jamie? Call me a nerd. Tell me I’m the squarest square you’ve ever met.”
“Partly, yes,” Steve said, removing his hand. “Partly because of everything I’ve observed from her. She’s been—she’s been very kind to me. Kind to all of us, really. And I do think my double had a point—they could have locked us up, Tony. They could’ve thrown us in jail, but instead they invited us home. That has to count for something.”
“What—?” Before he was cut off with a pained grunt and then, explosions. Explosions everywhere behind him and Steve ran as fast as he could as suddenly the earth seemed to be lighting up in fire around him—and then he wasn’t running anymore. A metal covered arm gripped around his chest and lifted him from the ground, flying him out of the way of the chain reaction of landmines.
He wondered under what circumstances he would. Clearly, some version of himself had wanted those things. Clearly, some version of himself had wanted those things with

It had taken Tony a little while, but in Steve’s absence, realization had dawned on her. What Steve said was
Kate had only sort of understood, in those moments. And shortly after that, her mother had joked about it being too early for philosophical conversations (though in the day, or in Kate’s life, Kate couldn’t say, looking back).

righteous speeches about civil liberties?” she asked. Steve chuckled.
“Deal,” Tony agreed.
I really should say thank you a thousand times over to Aster, who has been here since the start and before. So thank you, Aster, a thousand times over.
“In the flesh, Captain. I’m assuming you’re still Steve Rogers, yes?” Tony asked. Steve nodded in confirmation. He still looked like he was trying to solve a particularly difficult puzzle. There was a tiny crinkle on his forehead between his eyebrows, and his features were slightly pinched together in concentration. It was adorable and sexy and
“Wait.
“Let him
“I—you—we haven’t seen you upstairs so, I just thought…I just thought, well, that you might not be eating. Or at least not well. So I figured I’d bring you something just in case,” Steve said, stumbling over himself just a bit. 3490 Tony continued to stare at him. “Not that—not that you aren’t perfectly capable of taking care of yourself. Because you are. Obviously—I just—”
“STEVE,” Natasha yelled, so probably he hadn’t.
“Clint, could you please pass the parmesan? Thank you,” 3490 Tony said lightly, as if she hadn’t heard. The table was unusually silent as they ate. Steve’s head was spinning. His double had just

Torrun found herself tuning out again, zoning out over her soup. It wasn’t that she wasn’t interested in tactics. It was just that they had had this discussion a hundred other times. Kate was always the one to bring it up. She was a shrewd tactician and ruthless when it came to keeping all of them in line. But the problem came down to numbers. They needed more. But they just didn’t
Kate looked down at the page in her hands, the white, thick stock paper imprinted with the crest of Hawthorn Academy.
“Cosmic cube. That’d do it,” Tony said, frowning deeply in annoyance. Why had someone decided to disrupt her day like this? Now she had a full set of Other Avengers and various sidekicks—all potential threats—in the middle of her helicarrier.  “Well, don’t worry. As soon as I establish that you’re actually alts and not woefully idiotic assassins, I’ll transfer you to a more comfortable setting where you can wait until we fix this.”

“Fury?” Natasha asked.
“Oh, well, we’ll have to go sometime then,” Pepper said.
“You told me not to get too close. My double spotted me—damn bastard. You need to send Natasha on these ops,” Barton said, sounding agitated.
Dr. Banner, walked in through the door. He took a seat beside her on the couch. He looked at the laptop. “So you’re pretty confident they’re friendly?”
“What happened in the nineties…” she didn’t bother to finished the phrase, just raised her shot glass in a toast and Steve followed her lead. They both took a shot to that. Tony refilled the glasses.
“It wasn’t meant to be subtle. They know we won’t sit by passively. The louder we are in our attempts the less likely they are to notice the actual work we’re doing,” Natasha said. She looked like she was going to murder someone. Clint understood how she felt. Natasha was really in charge of this whole operation on the Avengers’ side, and so far no one had show the levels of espionage capability they really needed on these ops. Rogers was all right, and Stark sneaky but mostly all guns and tech, but Thor was an oblivious teddy bear, and Jane and Pepper had brilliant minds but no knowledge of strategy. Bruce was the most promising, but his tendency to turn into a giant green monster under pressure was problematic. Clint knew Natasha was practically tearing her hair out working with such an amateur group as far as spying went, and it was not helping that they couldn’t keep in regular communication with the other three to apprise them of their movements. It wasn’t safe—they could text or email, but that would all be monitored. They could take walks together every now and then or have coffee, but Clint had no doubt that if they did they’d be followed or bugged or merely interrupted on a semi-regular basis.
“Do you?

“Tony—they’re not us,” Steve said, frowning. Tony got up, finally looking at him.

“She seemed relatively normal until ABBA came on,” the Commander said.
“Oh, look who finally decided to show up two months late with a Starbucks,” Tony said irritably. Neither Fury was holding a drink of any kind, so Kate figured this was some obscure pop culture reference she was missing. Maybe it was big in the MCU.
Kate’s words rang in his ears, ominous. No, he hadn’t had a clue. But he was starting to get the picture.
“I am,” she said quietly. “I’m afraid to look back on everything and—I’ve done so much wrong. I’ve wasted so much of my life to now. I’m afraid of wasting the rest of it.”
“I’m not trying to be your

“Thank you Francis, we’ll be there in a minute,” his dad answered. Francis popped back out. Peter was grateful for the time to regain his composure. His chest still ached—had ached all day, had distracted him all through school—but it was bearable now. Dad still looked at him carefully. Peter projected the best image he possibly could of nonchalance.
movie is but I’m pretty sure I’m insulted,” Steve said dryly, but he let it slide. Tony wasn’t exactly the touchy-feely type; he only hoped his words had reached his ears, no matter how cheesy they might be. They sat in silence for a moment, listening to the background chatter at the bar. A beautiful blonde was complaining to the bartender about her ex, and occasionally casting sultry looks over to Steve. Two businessmen were making deals that did not sound particularly legal. Behind them a woman laughed, over and over again, in a high pitched, drunken giggle that grated on the nerves of everyone in the vicinity.
“Didn’t you just give them a talking-to about that?” Tony asked.

“Have any of you seen Tony?” double Pepper asked, wandering further into the mansion. The Tony Pepper knew best looked like Christmas had come early, but a well timed glare from Pepper kept his mouth glued shut.

When the elevator stopped, they were in a vast workshop. There were cars along the wall, and, in the back, some type of metal suit in the back. Well, everyone did say that Stark was crazy. Steve stood by the elevator and waited, prepared to be in for a long night before Natasha would come to take over for him in the morning. But that was all right. Steve didn’t sleep much, anyway.

“Shut the fuck up, Barton,” Peter snapped, giving him the tiniest of shoves, though it looked like it probably took Peter some effort. Barton’s eyes went dark. He shoved Peter, who staggered several feet backwards, out of sight of the Avengers in the kitchen. It sounded like he crashed into something. Kate smacked Barton on the shoulder, hard. Tony noticed that Steve’s back was ramrod straight, and it looked like it was taking him quite some effort to stay seated.

“Whatever will get us home in one piece,” Pepper said.
Torrun whipped past Tony, yelling no word in particular and wielding her sword like an expert. She slashed one of the flying bots clean in two, sparing Tony from its wrath. James groaned loudly in the background.
“We’re not sure of anything here, Hill, what do you want me to say? You can’t even tell me with 100% certainty whether or not a guy is deaf,” Natasha snapped.
“I just don’t understand,” 3490 Steve said. He spoke quietly, but not quietly enough. He and Antonella stood just outside Kate’s room, looking in on the unconscious girl through the open door. “I don’t understand how this could have happened.”

“You’ve been so brave, dealing with them,” Tony said. “I’m really proud of you, James. Your father is, too. Incredibly proud.” James felt his gut twist.
“You don’t mean…?” Steve trailed off. He couldn’t bring himself to say it. There seemed to be a rather lot of things these days that he couldn’t quite bring himself to say.
And it was definitely a setting ol’ Capsicle was used to.
At those words, something inside James snapped. He went from listening with sympathy for his brother to suddenly feeling an uncontrollable rage at his father. How many times had he heard those exact words? How many times in his life had his father told him he was
“Kinky.”
Thank you.
“Actually—” he said, and Steve turned his gaze to him. “I have something to say. Tony and Peter should hear this too. Kate already knows.”
Steve had hold of his little boy’s hand. Well, he wasn’t so little anymore. He had never been particularly small. He had grown up big and healthy and boisterous in ways that Steve never was. He hadn’t quite known what to do with him, Steve could admit that now. He did not know how to teach respect that had been, for him, born of a lived situation. He did not know how to teach things that Steve himself instinctively understood, did not know how to make the most of the brief summers he had with his son in order to teach him honesty and integrity and

“Because of today?” she asked him, sounding puzzled.
“So how are we going to get Widow and Hawkeye out of here?” Tony asked Steve. Currently the two in question were all over the place, and Tony had no doubt they soon would be as well.
“I think I might need to stay out of it,” Bruce said quietly. “If the other guy gets out I won’t be able to control what he might do against 3490. It could compromise the mission.” Steve nodded.
“I have a bit of time at the moment,” Double Pepper said. “Are you going to introduce me to your guests?”

“Those are our orders. I better not be hearing insubordination, Katie,” the bald guy said, his tone dangerous.
“TOO MANY TO BOTHER COUNTING,” Kate shouted back as she loosed another arrow. It was true, too. She was having difficulty keeping tack—which was unfortunate, because she knew the exact number of arrows in her quiver and she knew she had to be running low—but she had no idea what number she was at yet. She just hoped it would come down to a moment when she needed an arrow and couldn’t find one.
.” Steve could imagine that was true. He himself could run thirty miles an hour if he pushed himself, and James had appeared to have inherited the super genes. Kate was already storming towards the gym. Steve put out his hand.
“He’s not always right,” 525 Tony said hoarsely. “Don’t always—don’t believe him infallible. Stand up for what you believe. Fight for it if you have to. Question. Don’t just let it go.”
“Get me Billy. I need him to help me get James back to the bunker,” Bruce said quietly. Azari looked down at James dubiously, then back up at Bruce.
“Did you take the eye drops I told you to?” she asked in an undertone. It was almost too quiet for the other Avengers to hear.
Tony’s head spun. Her alternate had stolen one of her suits. One of
“Harley,” Steve reminded him. “Those fifth graders. No fooling me.”
“Peter?” Francis asked as he rushed past, nearly colliding into walls. No time. He made for the other bathroom and burst in the door. James was toweling off his hair and looked at him in alarm, but Peter couldn’t do anything but go straight to the toilet, emptying his stomach contents.
“Yes,” she said, but there was a little crease between her eyes. She stabbed a bit of turkey with her fork. “Francis told me you’re going overseas in January.”

“Yeah, fucking seriously. I know a guy. So, you in?” she asked.
“Yeah, ok,” he said, sliding off the countertop and walking to him. They headed down to the garage together.
“And a daughter, Kate. They’re twins. And a stepson, James, but he’s not around much. He’s twenty-two, so he pretty much does his own thing,” 3490 Tony responded. Tony was perfectly aware that everyone from his universe was looking at 3490 Tony with a dumbfounded expression—well, everyone aside from Natasha, but that was to be expected. Tony couldn’t even comprehend enough to get a dumbfounded expression on his face. He couldn’t get past the idea of himself
old base. World War II old. Piqued my curiosity. I went to check it out myself. Ended up getting caught and chased out and I’ve been running ever since.” Steve raised an eyebrow.
“Oh, I don’t think this is an aggression issue,” Antonella disagreed. “I think this is a…team cohesiveness issue. I think you all could use some good old fashioned team bonding. You know, we all could, if our teams are going to be working more closely together.”
“Yeah,” James said with a shrug, still worried about her. He was concerned that she was changing the subject. Torrun generally faced her problems head on. “That’s par for the course for the military.”
leave Kate and Peter and I—I can understand why you might think that, but it still hurts that you could and—“ Steve slowed and swallowed. He took a breath. “I’m not going to throw away ten years of happy marriage over this, Tony. If things—if things had gone another way, then maybe, I won’t lie, I—I, there are certain things I couldn’t forgive, but the situation being what it is, Tony, I won’t do it. I can’t. And I can’t throw away 26 years of friendship. I can’t. I love you, Tony. Unconditionally. Even if you gave me cause to hate you, I would love you still.” He sighed and shook his head.

well his sixteen year old sister knew this guy, though—it might require him to hunt him down and bash his face in, as big brothers do. Of course, Kate was perfectly capable of bashing faces in on her own.
Kate shifted backwards, making to slip out of his hand. Francis dropped it when he noticed, and it fell to his side like it was made of lead. His gaze dropped and his shoulders slumped, the change in him so sudden and so visible she froze again.
Johnny Storm
“On it,” 3490 Steve said. He already had his cell phone on hand. Happy was driving around the neighborhood, still looking for Peter. He would go and pick him up at Hollis. Antonella collapsed in an armchair in relief.
“Could be,” Steve agreed.
“Love you, too, Mom,” he said. “Bye.” Then Peter turned to the alts and gave a short wave to them. “Bye to you too. Nice meeting you all.” There were a few muttered goodbyes in return to Peter’s, along with Pepper and Jane’s polite return of both of his sentiments, and Thor’s booming goodbye:
“No. I’m with you to the end. And the end is not today,” Peter said firmly. But even though his words had conviction, inside he had never known such fear. He felt like a scared little boy all over again, and he would give anything for Daddy to come and fix it all for him. But Daddy wasn’t here. “I’m not leaving you. And I’m not going to let you die.” James just smiled at him weakly. And then his eyes rolled into the back of his head. Peter could swear he felt his own heart stop. “James? JAMES! Come back! Come back, come on, you can do this!” Peter yelled at his brother, but he received no response. He moved one trembling hand to his brother’s neck to check his pulse, hardly daring to do it, too frightened of what he might find. There was one still, but it was weak. “James, you can
“I wonder why we couldn’t get a location on him until now,” he wondered aloud. Antonella shook her head.
“Nobody’s perfect, Tony,” Steve said quietly. “What we’re doing now? Everything with the Avengers, with SHIELD—that’s important. And I think when you’re a little old lady—still probably flying around in that tin can of yours—you’re going to look back with a lot more pride than regret.”
“I was never in the boy scouts,” Steve said, his hands fumbling over the buttons of his shirt. He’d at least figured out at this point that there was nothing sexual going on. Well, there might have been, but if there was this was the oddest foreplay Steve had ever encountered.
It had been a good long while since Kate had seen James in the mansion. In fact, the last time she could remember him being there was May, when he graduated from West Point. They’d held a reception for him in the ballroom. But since then, James hadn’t been around, busy with his work in the army as he was. Of course, Kate was fairly certain that was just an excuse. He could have stopped by if he had wanted. So, she felt equal parts resentment and relief at her brother’s presence in their home once more. James looked around. “Where’s Peter?”
. The crowbar had bounced right off, as if there were a real shield where the illusion was. “What..?” Tony just grinned.
“I think it’s Japanese. Don't be an ass--how many girls have
What made Steve Rogers so special?
“Tell you what, I’ll swing by the restaurant and pick up some dessert and put it in the fridge and we can have our own—much more private—dinner whenever you get home,” Steve said, and his voice was deep and filled with suggestion. A chill ran all the way down to her toes—she

you’re heavy,” Peter complained as he took on his brother’s full weight, half-dragging him towards the hatch. “What did you have for breakfast? A neutron star?”
“Listen—we should talk. Not here. In the kitchen,” she said.
“Doesn’t change the truth of it,” 3490 Steve said with a sigh. 3490 Tony rose from her seat and stood behind her husband, wrapping her arms around his shoulders and planting a gentle kiss on his cheek.

it was sending you here. It did the simplest thing it could—it ripped a hole from your universe and dumped you into ours. Unfortunately, when I say ripped, I mean literally ripped. There are tears in the fabric of both of our universes now, and widening the holes with another journey could be catastrophic. Now, it’s not
“You have earned my trust, the team’s trust,” Commander Rogers replied. Natasha nodded in agreement behind him. “We hope we’ve earned yours.” The MCU team regarded one another. James could clearly see the Steve and Tony of the alternate team having a quick, silent conversation.
Steve, of course, already knew what it was. He had offered to deliver the news, if she didn’t want to, but Tony felt like this was something that would sound better coming from her, the scientist, the engineer. She was still dressed in her business clothes—a white silk shirt, a dark navy coat, and a matching navy pencil skirt with killer high heels (shoes were, after all, a bit of a weakness of hers, one she shared with Pepper). Her hair was drawn up into a simple chignon, aside from one small curl near the side of her face that had refused to cooperate that morning. Still, even dressed to the nines Tony felt naked in front of these people. They stared at her so expectantly, and like they
“Hey. You ready for this?” Steve turned to look at Tony. He was in the suit, face plate raised up. Steve recognized that expression now; it was deep, serious concern disguised by light, flippant concern over top. He was surprised to realize that he’d probably understood Tony’s expressions for a lot longer than he wanted to admit. There were some things he might have been—deliberately misunderstanding. Because when he had risen in a new time he’d been hurt and angry and alone and he’d taken it out on the easiest target he could find. And Tony had usually let him.
“Where are you picking these up from?” Tony asked. Agent Matthews pointed to the central console, where Tony had been standing just a minute before. Well, she was thrilled that she had moved.
His brain started working again at some point, and he managed to pilot the Iron Man again, stabilizing in the air and managing to pull up before he made a big Tony Pancake on the ground. Tony was definitely not a flavor of pancake he ever wanted to taste. He preferred blueberry.
“Kind of,” Tony said. “Except one little difference…” Tony picked up a crowbar from the floor. “Don’t flinch.”
Oh well. Guess he was going to find out either way.
, of their team taking down the doombots.
“Oh, thank God,” Pepper said. “I already have so many meetings I’m going to have to reschedule.”
“Right. Great. Ok, so, I’ll see you—” Tony started, already turning away. He’d go back to his room, the ultimate hiding spot. He’d been tinkering in there for the past few days with some of Antonella’s technology. He still hadn’t figured out how she’d managed to get her armor in her bones, though he was getting closer. He had an inkling as to how to do it—his old botanist pal, Maya Hansen, came to mind—but he wasn’t all the way there yet. It made a great side project since no one was really letting him look at any of the universe calculations. That was fine though—what Tony had seen, Tony didn’t really understand. He had a vague grasp of it, but nothing anywhere near as in-depth as he would need to fix their problems. Of course, even as Tony was turning away, Steve had other plans.
for Christ’s sake!
“Yes,” Tony said honestly. “I’m sorry, Captain. There’s nothing I can do. I will not endanger my own universe further, nor will I allow you to endanger yours by going through anyway. Whatever damage whoever is causing in your universe right now, I promise you it is not as bad as what would happen if we tore that hole open wider.” The room was quiet for a minute.
“What Richards means to say is that shit is all fucked up,” 3490 Clint cut in for him. “Our universe is on the edge of collapse. We’re going to get visitors—from other universes, possibly from different points in our own time stream—as it all falls apart. It’s going to compound itself until it collapses, and once it does, it’ll cause a domino effect. If we go down, the whole damn multiverse goes with us.” Steve nearly felt his heart stop. The whole

. Kate looked all over the room. It was a medieval castle, though it had gone through bouts of restoration. Everything was made of serious dark stone, and there was just the one entrance. The ceilings were high, and arched, supported in part by large wooden structures. The only other point that wasn’t solid walls were three small stained glass windows, set high, high up on the back wall the Skull stood before. There was mounted weaponry all over. She had a feeling if she shot an arrow off at the Skull, it would be vaporized before it even got close. They needed to take out the weapons.
“Let’s just—move past this topic then, shall we?” he said. Dr. Pym then launched into a lecture about Latveria, Dr. Doom, and his various known weapons and tactics. Peter wasn’t really listening—he found, after a moment, that he already knew most of what Pym was talking about anyway.
“He saved mine back there too,” James said. He still wasn’t really looking at Steve. But Steve could live with that. James was going to live. He’d be fine. That was all that mattered right now.
“Maybe,” James agreed reluctantly. They sat in silence for a few minutes, James chewing his sandwich and hopefully mulling over Torrun’s words while Torrun just enjoyed his company.
“That the bracelet was a reminder of how strong I was,” Kate said, looking at the old silver charm bracelet that was still on her wrist. “And how you and Dad and Peter and James would always be there for me. And then you went through every charm and told me what it meant.”
, but that doesn’t change the facts, does it? It wouldn’t have mattered who was leading—there was no way out of that one. We’re outnumbered. We’re exhausted. We’re going to get picked off like flies the minute we start making mistakes—maybe even before then. We need
“Because I like playing cruel jokes on myself? Fuck, I don’t know,” Antonella said, taking the glass and the bottle with her and plopping in the armchair across from Tony. She turned it towards him and shook it slightly. It was, indeed, Welch’s sparkling grape juice. She set the bottle down on an end table and sipped at the glass, which bubbled appropriately. “No. I do know. I’ve gotten shit faced in here so many times this has become my have-a-breakdown spot. And if I can’t get drunk I’m going to get

As Steve tore away and destroyed deadly blue vaporizers, swinging punch after punch, he had to wonder where these agents had really come from. Earlier in the time stream of 3490? Or earlier in the time stream of their own universe? If they walked through that breach to the other side, would he be in his own world, in 1945?
spider powers, Peter?”
He had given James those tags when he was six, his first year entering St. Catherine’s Military Academy. His dad had gotten down on one knee so they could be at eye level, and he’d handed him the tags, telling him they’d bring him good luck, telling him that
“Well, being your offspring, occasionally I stop by,” James said. At his father’s skeptical look, he shrugged. “Tony asked me over. Something in the lab she wants me to try. Probably military related, I don’t know. It doesn’t matter.”
“What do we say to the God of Death?” his mother had teased him just a few months before, when he was doing his homework and complaining of dying whilst doing it. She’d loved

, though Natasha refused to use the nickname)—knowing as she did who he was to Steve, now, as well as to her, Natasha wondered if he had something to do with her double’s silence.
“So I see,” Steve said. “Have you done your history essay yet? You know, the one you were complaining about three days ago? The one that’s due tomorrow?”
“Well I wouldn’t tell your mother. I’d pity the poor kid who’d have to suffer her wrath,” Steve advised. Peter managed a brief smile before his father tossed him a wrench. He didn’t catch it—such were his reflexes. It bounced harmlessly off his chest and onto the ground. It wouldn’t have hurt, in normal circumstances; it had been thrown very lightly. Yet it hit his ribs and suddenly his chest was on fire, and he was doing his best not to scream at the top of his lungs. He wasn’t sure how well he kept his composure. Something must have shown on his face, because his father looked at him with scrutiny and concern. He opened his mouth to speak, but the door to the garage opened.
“I did not

“Ah, well, that’s—as you know, Peter has grown up around superheroes—”
and Steve thought, as a parent, perhaps he ought to say something, but he couldn’t think of anything to say, couldn’t make his tongue work or his voice cooperate. She looked so painfully like her mother, standing there. He’d wonder when she had grown into an adult, but he knew. It was the same moment that had changed them all. He hugged her, too, and then left the hospital.

“And it’s permanent?” Mom asked. “Bruce thinks it’s permanent?” She let him go, but only just. She still held onto his shoulders gently.

The plane landed, having gone into ‘stealth mode’ (which Steve discovered meant the plane

“He’s an inter dimensional traveler,” the other Steve explained. “Very dangerous. Like—America Chavez, have you met her? Like her, only if she was evil. The Ghost has one of our teammates held captive, but we’re having trouble catching him. We’ll be on our way as soon as we confirm he’s not here…”
“Crisis averted,” Tony said as he picked the shield back up and tossed it across the park to Steve’s waiting hand. “Back to the rest of the crises!”
“A man walked into the conference room. Agent 81. He had a tiny cube in his hand. There was a flash of light, and then we were here,” Clint said. Of course it would be Clint to pipe up with the observation. Clint always had his eyes on everything. It was the quality she admired most about the man, above and beyond his marksmanship.
been dealing with the fallout from this, Steve.
, please exit the building in an orderly fashion—” Tony was speaking into the intercom for the building. It might be the Avengers Annual Christmas Party, but there were also several Christmas parties on the lower floors—R&D workers without families, or some with who simply did not wish to see them, celebrated on other floors. Traditionally, Tony would take some time out to spend part of the evening with them as well, but it didn’t look like that was going to exactly happen anytime soon.
” Peter said the last bit so quickly it was barely comprehensible. He reached out and snatched at something in the air, then held it between his thumb and index finger. Even from a distance, Tony could see a tiny little wing flapping.
in him? How many times had James received the message that he was a disappointment? He didn’t know, because it was too many times to count. The words had long lost their potency for James, even if they forever held a sting—but to Peter, James knew, the words would be a horrible slap. Peter was the

“What about everything they’ve done

“It’s not going to be big enough for everybody,” Azari told him quietly as they walked. Azari had never once broken stride with him as they walked. Occasionally he shot him concerned glances. Torrun likewise walked on his other side, her sword drawn and her eyes forever scanning around them for enemies. All of the Avengers’ kids walked behind them, and the MCU Avengers held up the rear. If the enemy attacked from behind, they would buy the rest of them enough time to run to the safehouse. Thing of it was, considering what James had witnessed on the field, he doubted whoever was behind this would be at all interested in a bunch of Avengers’ kids. They only had eyes for MCU Steve. James was just
“So all this is about getting even?” Dad asked rhetorically. “If so, I guess you must feel pretty good about yourself right now, am I right? Am I right or wrong, Peter?” James could see his little brother avoiding eye contact, and looking all together annoyed that they were having this discussion. He shook his head, but it was less in the manner of ‘no’ and more in the manner of ‘you don’t get it’. James knew. He’d been there. And it was the wrong answer.
“Never tried, after sleeping until four. Are you going to use the same excuse, or are you going to tell me that sleeping for seventy years was enough for you?” she asked. Young Steve—and that, Tony realized, was probably a more accurate description for him than Other, for he was identical to the Steve Tony remembered, in every way—looked a bit surprised at that, but then seemed to recall who he was talking to. He gave a small smile and shook his head slightly.
“Ok, ok, yes, I missed you all too, detach yourselves, please,” Tony finally laughed, ruffling Peter’s hair fondly and patting James on the back at the same time. Both the boys let go, but it took Kate an extra moment. Steve just watched from the pulpit, numb. And her eyes looked up and locked with his. She crossed her arms and smirked, starting forwards. “You know darling, I wouldn’t say no to some big dramatic scene right about now. Sweeping gestures, and all that. Well, at least there are flowers. So many flowers. God, why did I ask for so many flowers? The amount of pollen in this church should be illegal.”
“Bucky. Got another name for us? Because that’s not much to go on. We’re thinking maybe it’s a nickname?” Stark said, his voice lilting upwards in a question as he looked, puzzled, at his tablet. Googling, Steve thought.
“…Yes? It seemed urgent.”
Chapters 78 - 85: Saturday, December 24, 2016
James was speechless. He had no idea what to say. He was used to Tony making grand gestures, used to her inventing some crazy new piece of tech solely for the amusement of her children, used to her kind eccentricities—but this was something different all together. Tony’s face fell at his silence.
“Finally. You’re such a fucking slowpoke, you know that? I thought you were going to be here at 6:30,” she said. She grabbed her leather satchel from where it hung off the back of her chair.

“We’re getting blasted from up top,” Steve said grimly. “We’ve only got two fliers, Thor and Iron Man are doing their best.”

“Two years,” he said. Tony grabbed a swivel chair from one of the desks behind her and sat down.
?” Kate asked. She stood, leaning her back on the kitchen counter, her arms crossed. “It’s like talking about my parents’ sex lives. Ugh.”
They got all the way around the circle, with a variety of confessions—some were innocent (“Never have I ever been to summer camp”, “Never have I ever puked at an amusement park or fair”), and plenty were not. They were halfway through round three around the circle when the phone in Tony’s pocket started ringing. Tony excused herself from the circle and walked just a bit away from the happy (and largely roaring drunk) group. It wasn’t often that Tony’s actual cell phone rang. Typically her business calls were ranked in order of importance and routed through JARVIS who then contacted her directly through her internal Extremis connections. So, she had a business phone which she largely kept in a drawer in the mansion and just used her mind to answer most things. A phone call usually meant Peter or Kate was calling, or possibly her secretary at SHIELD in the event of a real emergency (that happened a bit more often). Tony didn’t, however, recognize the number that was calling.
“Mm,” was all Tony could say, because her throat was stuck together.
“Should be back for dinner,” Kate said, eyeing him suspiciously. “Did you do something?” James frowned.

“Tony made a barrel of that blue concoction. It was the nineties,” he said by way of explanation. Tony refilled both their glasses.

This is—this is hard and frankly I think…I think a marriage counselor might be a good idea at this point, but I’m

to me—”
“Ah, good Captain. I had so hoped you would come to see me,” the Red Skull spoke, opening his arms out wide. A dare? A show of power? Kate didn’t know and wasn’t sure it was relevant in the moment. She caught Clint’s gaze, then flicked her eyes upwards. Their explosive arrows should do the trick on taking out those guns. But they needed an opportune moment; Kate had no doubt that the second the skull knew what they were about, those guns would all start firing, and Kate doubted any of them were armed with mere bullets. The other version of her dad stepped out in front of all of them, his shield up in front.

“It’s not much further,” James promised. They had been wandering the tunnels for what felt like hours, though James knew that the tunnels only took about an hour to walk. He’d had little Lewis Barton on his shoulders for a while now; the little boy had been fine for the first fifteen minutes after James put him down, but then he’d broken down into a crying fit. Francis was busy holding Nicole while Kate held Lizzy Hogan’s hand, so James had picked him up and did his best to keep him calm and cheer him as they walked. It all had to be rather stressful for a six year old. It was stressful for James, and he was twenty-two.
a story we wanted to relive, not a story we wanted to even admit ever happened in the first place,” Dad said. He pulled up one of the kitchen chairs to sit on, and that’s when Peter knew they were in for a very long story.
“That’s the thing, Cap,” Tony said, combing over bits of the jacket, “I didn’t bring my phone with me.” He grabbed his wallet and started emptying it. He grabbed the credit card 3490 Tony had issued each of them. He squinted at it. “Could be in here, but I don’t think so. I was paying at the bar with cash.”
“Yeah, guess so,” he said. “Well, I guess I’ll just…go see if Kate needs help with the cookies.”
“You know what
“No.”
“It’s Welch’s, genius,” Antonella said with bite.
“I might just finish this tonight,” he said. He looked at his watch. “It is getting late though. Kate, you should probably get to bed.”
“Well that seems reasonable,” Tony spoke. Fury turned to give her a one-eyed glare. “They can stay with us at the Mansion, like the last group did. There’s only six of them.” Tony hadn’t been terribly fond of the Steve and Tony from Earth-1610 who had landed in their universe and also been stranded for about a week. Her own double Tony didn’t mind much, but Steve’s double was an asshole—he was mysoginistic, rude, and every kind of bad-stubborn her own Steve could be without any willingness to compromise like hers had. He was stuck in the 40s, and it didn’t seem like he was as liberal and understanding and
“Steve I think there’s someone in the building,” she said quietly.
And now, tonight, it was the decisive night. He waited in a room with everyone involved with the Stark campaign, a glass of champagne in his hand, completely full. Steve stared out over the sea of people, listening to the excited chatter and always keeping one eye carefully trained on Tony.

“I didn’t marry my wife for her looks, or her wealth—or her gender. I married her for her mind, which I know quite well. You seem to be quite similar to her. And I know that, were our positions reversed, there is no way in hell Tony would be sleeping soundly by my side in our room—she’d be out, sneaking through the halls of the Other mansion, ready to hack into the workshop,” 3490 Steve replied. “Go get some sleep, Tony, as hard as that may be for you to obtain. It’ll be like Christmas when you wake up—only this time, you won’t have found all the presents first.” Tony was still reeling at the many implications of that short statement from the 3490 Captain America. He knew that every Christmas he would go hunting for his parents’ stash of Christmas presents long before they were wrapped and would, of course, find them, which was

? This Captain was bisexual? Or at least, flexible? Tony wasn’t going to lie, that was a shocker. Even this Steve had seemed straight as an arrow. He slipped back into bed, still baffled.
“We live in a house where our parents have doubles and one of them is also a guy. We live in a world where this is
“No,” he said. “No, I—someone strong has to do it, right? And you have to be careful about what you ask for. What you want in that moment. Because reality will bend to your will and I—Tony. I want. I want too much. I want the world to be better. I want all my friends to have made it out of the war. I want Bucky to be alive, and well, and have never had to be the Winter Soldier like he is here. I want this universe’s Tony back, so she can go home to her family. I—I would try. Not to make all of it reality. I’d try. But I don’t know if I’d succeed. But you—Tony. I watched you fly into space in New York. You laid down on that wire. I think—I think you should do it. I trust you to do it. More than I trust myself.”

“Mmm,” James said. He closed his eyes.

“Too much,” Steve replied hoarsely. “And I think it’s—I think it’s time you and Kate understood just what. You’re old enough now.”
funeral. And that had been the moment, for James, where coming home had felt uncomfortably surreal. They’d finished their debriefing and then his family and the alternate Avengers headed out to Long Island, to the home none of them had seen in months.
Everyone seemed very busy. Organized chaos. Peter felt like he wasn’t busy enough—but he didn’t really have much in the way of equipment, and he was already packed. He was still amazed that, even after having been laid up in a hospital bed just a couple of days ago with a broken leg, he was doing just fine now. He’d already healed and felt back to normal.
“That’s not what I mean, though I don’t really understand her reasons, either. I mean—how could we have let this happen? How could she be suffering so under our watch? How did we

was the truth of family. Tony took Pepper’s hand and squeezed it. She shot him a small, understanding smile. Tony would never have family, other than Pepper and Rhodey and JARVIS. Tony refused. He just hoped that he could live with that.
,” Jane said firmly. She carried Peter, who had been asleep and still wasn’t fully awake. James carried his little sister.
At first, Tony thought it was merely worry for his wife’s well being, which, it must have been in large part, but then, as Tony heard engines revving, his stomach sank and he realized that the Commander’s concern was not only for his wife.
I don’t toss your asses in a prison for the rest of this year for the blatant disregard of orders and

Steve had to admit that, well, maybe his response was the tiniest bit childish. Maybe they needed to clear the air a bit. Maybe Steve ought to apologize. Though not about the yelling about Tony flying into danger. That was mostly justified. But maybe for being a bit of an ass about it.
“Shit,” Peter swore. He gulped down one last bite of cocoa puffs and then took off like a shot through the house. Kate just sighed and rolled her eyes dramatically.

“Because you stopped weapons production,” Steve replied. Stark frowned.
“But that’s…” Peter struggled for words.
. That burned Kate up.
Jeanne was surprisingly effective even without her right arm. Kate was less so, slowed down by the fact that, if she moved in just the wrong way, pain would shoot all through her body, starting at that injured tailbone. Kate was slow, but Jeanne couldn’t pin her down. She landed a few kicks, one to Kate’s stomach that was so hard Kate thought she might vomit right then and there. Jeanne was an unpredictable but calculating opponent. It took everything Kate had to stay a step ahead amidst the kicks and punches and dodges.
like it was in chaos. The car alarms were cacophony enough, but Tony could hear loud music playing from several different apartments, stereo systems that had been commandeered by Extremis. Cars had flipped, engines were on fire, and in the midst of it all stood Antonella, visibly trembling, rooted to the spot but hovering a few inches off the ground, her husband speaking to her softly in Italian. Tony only ever caught a word here and there in all the noise. Mainly from Antonella he heard,

Tony spent what was left of the afternoon in her lab, making preparations with the device that would inevitably send the alts home. It had to be tweaked, having sustained a bit of damage in the last few runs. Tony knew that Steve had mentioned something about Other Tony wanting to take a tour of her workshop, but Tony didn’t have the patience for that right now. For the moment, she needed a distraction from her family problems. Because really, what was she going to do about Kate? She couldn’t give her a longer punishment without arousing Steve’s suspicion, but she wasn’t ready to let her out of her sight and knew that she still wouldn’t be a month down the line, either. But she couldn’t keep Kate locked up forever, anyway, even if she could without Steve objecting. But—
morning and they were spending it locked in a cramped bunker instead of with their families—but none of them seemed to show any signs of it. They giggled and shrieked at the cartoon like it was the funniest thing they had ever seen, like they were on some giant sleepover rather than in hiding.
“Shut up and press start, Barton.”
? That’s more than rude, that’s criminal. Can we go again? What’s the password? ‘Beam me up Scotty?’” An overeager shield agent shoved his gun closer to Other Tony’s face. Director Stark would have said something, but frankly she was happy for any method that would get her home at a reasonable hour, and she knew herself well enough to know that Other Tony was likely to continue to make increasingly obscure pop culture references until someone answered his question.
“Excuse me?”
“Neither would be having my husband beat Fury’s face to a pretty little pulp,” Tony pointed out. “I think it will work out better for everyone this way. But first. Traditional questionably ethical spy methods.” Tony turned up the volume on her show, very much so done with this discussion with Dr. Banner. For a while, her tactic succeeded, and Bruce fell silent, but as soon as the credits rolled, he opened his mouth again.

as her Steve was. She hadn’t liked him. Neither had her own Steve. But they hadn’t caused any trouble, and it seemed like the most practical decision, allowing them to stay with the rest of the Avengers. Fury looked like he was considering. Eventually he nodded.
Fury had said they had been built, once upon a time, for smugglers. The passageway was tight and small, so much so that Kate had initially been a little afraid the other Steve
“Unfair?” Francis suggested. He shrugged. “That’s life, I guess.”
“It’s not really my fault if Director Fury is a little slow on the uptake,” he said. “But don’t worry about, I’ll have someone fetch your things. Come on up, we’re about to take off.” Stark marched back up the stairs. Steve glanced at Natasha.
“No pain no game, Rogers,” Tony said, already refilling the shot glasses.

“Not buying it,” Kate said stubbornly, crossing her arms. James shrugged.
Although that
James didn’t know where the enemies, dressed like AIM groupies, had come from. He only knew that shortly after the building collapsed, there had been open fire in the streets. Some of the Avengers had grabbed weapons on their way out of the tower; Clint had a bow, Uncle Bucky had a machine gun, and all three S.H.I.E.L.D. agents (Phil, Maria, and Sharon) from James’ universe were armed (though James figured that they were never

“He’s-kind-of-old-for-him-isn’t-he? I mean like, ok, that Steve is like James’ age. But Tony’s like, still the same age,” Tommy said.
“Tony?” Steve asked, since the other man apparently hadn’t noticed him yet. Tony looked in his direction and then squinted.
“We know, Peter,” he said. “We—we’re just a bit surprised, is all.”
me?” Steve rolled his eyes and removed his hand.
“I’d like to hear that story, too,” Natasha spoke up. Steve didn’t understand why—perhaps, he thought, it was because 3490 Natasha and Bucky appeared to be together in this universe and she was curious. Steve supposed that made sense. Bucky just looked at her and nodded, and then 3490 Natasha curled an arm around his bicep and gently tugged him off towards their seats at the table.
I fucked up, but—” it was obvious from her broken tone that Antonella was struggling to keep it together.
There were still guards at the doors outside, though, which Peter had not entirely anticipated. They blocked his escape. Enough of those blue lasers would take him down. So Peter did the only thing he could think to do—he ran still downwards, into the basement, shutting the door behind him and spraying it with web. It wouldn’t hold for long, but as he ran down the stairs and reached the second door into the basement itself, merely a concrete holding for maintenance equipment and old, archived files, he could barricade that door with shelves and wait for back up to come. They could still track him down through his smart suit. He had been looking for air vents to crawl out of when suddenly the world had exploded and crashed down upon his head.

at risk of being blown up both from plasma and from cannon balls,” Kate replied. She peaked out over the top of the vehicle, bow at the ready. She took out a couple of soldiers headed their way, also running from the terrifying silver ball floating in the sky. She thought they were screaming “witchcraft” and “God save us” but that could have been Kate’s imagination’s penchant for the dramatic.

“Fine, fine,” he reassured her. “I just…the team…we’ve been talking, and—“ Other Steve said, but at that moment Tony’s husband walked in through the garage door. Tony felt her heart leap into her throat. She couldn’t tell him. Not with his double standing right there. After.
“Not as much,” Natasha said with a shrug. “I’ll be glad to get back to D.C. either way, to see everybody all together again. I haven’t seen Clint much these past few months.” Steve often forgot that Natasha and Clint were an on-and-off item.
Steve hadn’t felt so…so…what was the word again? Good? Good didn’t seem enough. Excellent? Fluid? Happy? Happy. Happy was probably the word, though he wasn’t entirely sure. Steve hadn’t felt so happy in a good long while. It had a lot to do with that blue stuff Tony’s female counterpart had shoved in his hands. Comparatively, he hadn’t had that much to drink. ‘Never Have I Ever’ seemed to be mainly comprised of truths about everyone’s sex lives, which Steve hadn’t entirely been expecting. He was confessing more than he expected, and his teammates seemed a little surprised but not by any means appalled. His face was still burning red, and he wasn’t exactly
“Well what’s a hospital going to say anyway?” Peter challenged. “Probably ‘sorry, can’t help you’. So what does it matter?”
“But how did you keep going?” she’d asked again.
Steve, like Steve was alien tech or a section of code he couldn’t quite puzzle out. Steve shook his head. “I wasn’t looking for any of those things, Tony. I was just looking for a friend.”
“Me? Nothing. But nothing in the universe is random, exactly. I think we might have cracked the first part of predicting when and where these leaks will appear and disappear—thank you, Dr. Jane Foster!” Tony whooped. Natasha watched the iron suit do a flip in the sky. “Now, we can—“
He wasn’t entirely certain why he was hiding this. For the most part, Peter was just freaked out. But he didn’t, particularly, want to share it with anyone. He didn’t want to share this with anyone because, for once in his life, it was something new and unexpected about himself. He’d never had any interesting part to him until now, and he didn’t even know how to feel about this interesting part. Was it dangerous? Was it permanent? Would it cease in a few days? Peter had no idea, but the whole thing thrilled him as much as it frightened him.
“There’s no time! Just stay out of this!
When the alarm had gone off, they’d leapt out of Steve’s bed in unison, pulling on clothes with frankly impressive speed, and when Steve had shown up at the bunker’s exit, dressed for battle and ready to go, no one challenged him on it. Steve wasn’t sure if that was because everyone was far too exhausted to turn down an extra hand, or if everyone from 3490 simply would feel more comfortable if there was at least one Steve Rogers on the field.
“Say it!” Steve demanded again.
No matter the reasons, no matter the methods, Natasha still found much deeply wrong with that picture.

“Do you really want to?” Tony murmured, pulling back and looking his Captain in the face. It was a young face. Tony paused for a brief moment to wonder about the morality of getting into this with someone who was simultaneously decades older than him and decades younger, but then Steve’s eyes went dark and his lips came crashing down and then there wasn’t any verbal conversation at all.

“STAY DOWN, PARKER,” Flash roared. “WHO’S NEXT? WHO ELSE WANTS A PIECE OF—” Before Flash could find another ‘volunteer’ for a beating, a pretty blonde girl interrupted him. She spoke with him briefly, catching him off guard, distracting him from Peter who was still lying on the ground, doubled over in pain. The bell rang and she steered him towards class, sparing a look behind her for the boy still on the ground. To add insult to injury, some kid casually kicked Peter’s camera as he passed. Tony’s blood boiled at that simple gesture. As the crowd cleared, even Thor, Jane, and Pepper got out of the car.

was indeed the best Steve could think of. Only two years younger than James, Steve had known Francis for all his life. He had watched Clint teach him how to shoot a toy bow, and then not long after, the real thing. He had watched him play with Peter and Kate as children, patiently sitting through Kate’s tea parties and not so patiently trying to teach Peter to hold a bow. Then he watched as Francis moved on to teaching

The Alts were trying to make awkward conversation amongst themselves, Steve knew. He didn’t care.

“By my calculations? About a year,” Tony said. “You’re all more than welcome to stay here, or at the Triskelion, whichever you prefer. We’ll be providing you with a clothing allowance so you can set yourselves up more comfortably. We’ll take care of you while you are here, and if you feel the urge to help us with Avengers or S.H.I.E.L.D. business, we’re always grateful for it. But we’ll still provide you with shelter and clothing and food even if you just want to take the year off.”

Tony was very glad that her brain was essentially a computer because she definitely wanted to keep a picture of the looks on their faces. Tony resisted the overwhelming urge to laugh. Other Fury looked like he was about to have an aneurysm. Other Pepper’s eyes had gone as wide as saucers. Other Natasha looked appraising, and Other Clint was grinning and hitting Other Tony on his shoulder. Other Tony for his part did nothing but stare. Other Coulson, as usual, looked blank faced and unsurprised. Tony retracted the armor back under her skin.

disturbed, Steve knew. There was no amount of humor that could dispense the uneasiness that had settled over all of them like a thick, persistent dust.
“So where do we stand at the moment?” Steve asked.
He knew this day was coming. Their country was still at war, and James, having been in military school since
didn’t know that.
“You must be the new alternates,” Bucky spoke. It really was his voice, the same voice Steve remembered, and it tore into his gut. “It’s nice to meet you. I’m James Barnes—Winter Soldier, around here, or just plain Bucky.”
“If you require use of a lab, you can join Jane at Stark Tower in Manhattan,” mature Tony had replied unsympathetically.
“We just have to work through it,” Steve said. He wasn’t happy about it either, and he knew it showed on his face. Thor just nodded.
“Do you know
“Out we go,” Iron Man spoke as she felt a hard tug around her middle and was lifted unceremoniously into the air. She—and Clint, who was in Iron Man’s other arm, and Natasha, who had hopped on his back, were flown through the broken stained glass (and a small, easily distracted part of Kate mourned for the destruction of what was probably ancient and beautiful art) and then deposited, equally unceremoniously, on the grass a fair distance from the castle… where everyone else was also fighting.

“Tony—Tony? What are you doing?” Steve did his best to keep to keep the alarm out of his voice. Tony removed his jacket and was removing his tie. He unbuttoned his shirt.
“Can’t,” James said. His voice sounded pained now, more than before.
“We’d like to stay until—for the funeral,” MCU Steve had declared for them.
“Oh hell no—not until we’re prepared. We’re regrouping—that other Tony almost
“Shield,” James mumbled, looking down at his wrist. Eventually he moved his left hand to his right, pressing the smooth object fastened there. The device sprung to life. He tapped it twice with two fingers. The device flashed red three times, then shut off. “Should do it.”
“Do you have any emergency medical training?” Bruce asked Peter. The kid was wide-eyed and pale and probably had an injury or two of his own. He shook his head vigorously. Bruce replaced Peter’s hands with his own on James’ bleeding gut. “Then go find me someone who does. Quickly.” Peter darted up onto two feet and ran off and was back not but a second later with Azari.
“I don’t want to argue, Tony. I think we can discuss these issues better if everyone is together and we’re not worried about James running off on his own—“

We’ve finally gotten a little bit of information on the situation. It isn’t much, but it’s a starting point.”
, while Tony himself spoke with Pepper, dancing around the topic of his doppelganger’s apparent ability to commit as best he could—Steve was the only quiet one), Peter and Kate both slipped back into the kitchen. Kate was dressed in a dark blue skirt, a white shirt with a tie, and a blue blazer with a school crest embroidered on it. Peter, however, was dressed in baggy jeans and a black sweatshirt. Peter grabbed his backpack from the floor by the kitchen table while Kate opened up the pantry and grabbed a poptart. 3490 Tony walked to her.

“Yeah,” Francis replied.

“Go take a shower, you stink of vodka. You’re going to be late to school if you don’t hurry, and I’m not making any excuses to the principal for you,” 3490 Tony said firmly. Her eyes dark and angry, Kate turned on her heel towards the stairs. “And don’t even think of touching the ibuprofen! JARVIS will tell me if you do!” 3490 Tony sighed and came back into the kitchen, snatching her mug back up from the table and making a beeline for the coffeemaker.
, marveled at how bizarre his life truly was, and marveled at the fact that he was beginning not to mind it. The universe might throw him curveballs like time travel and universe travel, but if it was also willing to give him Tony Stark—well, then it certainly wasn’t all bad.
“Mhm,” Tony said. She knew he didn’t believe his words any more than she did.
“It’s just a
Whatever James would have said, however, Steve would never know, for at that moment Thor landed in the middle of the rink cracking the thin layer of ice. He was squarely in the midst of their group of tired and battered Avengers. It wasn’t the Thor Steve knew, though—although that was difficult to tell since, really, the Thors didn’t look much different from one another. No, Steve knew because of what Thor held in his hand. It was a glove. A

She wondered if those were from stress or alcohol or depression or all three. It was probably all three. She wondered how he managed to stave off self-loathing without Steve. She guessed that he didn’t.

hurt. She hoped she hadn’t damaged her spine. Her HUD went dark. She was trapped inside the armor. She started panicking—had there been an EMP? She’d thought she’d guarded against all but the strongest of those, but if a powerful enough one had gone off, her arc reactor was going to stop working. If her reactor stopped working, that shrapnel was going to start sliding again, and if it started sliding again—Tony tried to keep her panic down. She moved her heavy gauntlet manually, ripping off the faceplate. What she saw was more horrifying than she had anticipated. Through a thick haze of dust that had Tony coughing heavily, she could see a battle taking place on the streets—it was a bunch of Avengers, and most of them seemed to be attacking

“Such a pessimist today, aren’t we Bruce?” she asked. “Perhaps I’ll try using my feminine wiles.”
“Of course,” Commander Rogers said. “We’ll let you know.” Steve took that as the dismissal it was and left the hallway where they had been speaking. He strode out into the living room where the team was waiting.
“Good,” she said, then turned on her heel and went back to Pepper and Happy. The party, which had gone a bit quiet as Tony yelled, picked back up again. Kate came over to him, excitement in her eyes.
“I can keep my eyes on the sky and still take out Doombots on the ground,” Tony disagreed. He flew back and forth over the street, keeping a lazy watch over his teammates. Black Widow was using her widow’s bite to take down a doombot. Thor called lightning down from the heavens to strike, but the bot moved out of the way. Clint was handy with his arrows, especially the EMP arrows—Tony just had to make sure to keep his distance from those. Cap was taking down bots with his shield and his bare hands. But Tony was relegated to Lookout. Tony grunted in displeasure and landed anyway, taking out a bot with a solid repulsor blast.

“Yes, sir,” James said. He didn’t elaborate any further, just dug into his green beans.
Peter hated these little family outings. Actually, scratch that, Peter only hated family outings that involved his brother dearest. He was especially not thrilled that his mother had opted to stay in the lab and abandon him—he would have been happy to spend the whole day talking shop with her. He had asked to stay with her in the lab when she informed them of her plans, but she had insisted he go along with his dad and siblings. Which was how he ended up sitting in the stands at a Mets game, ball cap tugged over his face a little bit too far, arms crossed and slumped back in the hard plastic seat. Kate shoved a hot dog at him, which he took and bit into, chewing thoughtfully. Kate was having a blast. Kate loved baseball. Actually Kate loved anything that held any hint of competition whatsoever, but she particularly loved baseball. Unlike their father, however, Kate had never learned how to enjoy a game politely, sitting and cheering the team on. She had a tendency to stand up and shout at the ref (who of course could not hear her, or any of the other fans who did so) and rant about bad calls to anyone who would listen.
“Hm,” Tony said. “And what about you? Are you a morning person? What are you doing up right now, anyway?”
Chapters 1 – 5: Tuesday, October 18 2016
“I’m making JARVIS play it anyway and I’m going to sit right here so you’ll have to watch me watching it so there.”
“Of course he couldn’t be,” she said venomously. Richards was never around when he was needed. He was always working in his laboratory, making failed experiments that Tony would inevitably have to clean up after with her team of either SHIELD agents or Avengers. The Fantastic Four were, in her opinion, rather incompetent. To be fair to them, though, they had only been in operation for two years as opposed to the Avengers’ much more substantial twenty.
“I’ve got him, I’ve got him!” Peter yelled to his brother as James hit the deck to avoid another shot. He shot out web to grab the gun—Thug #3 avoided it, but he had to move the gun to do it, so Peter kept sending distractions as he ran to catch up with the guy. The guy started running again, occasionally throwing off a shot behind him. They were almost to the edge of the warehouse, the last rafters. Thug #3 was hitting the point where he would have to jump down, jump out the window, or turn and fight again. Peter
“They’ll come around, you know,” she said. “They’ll be supportive once they know it’s what you want.”
“Tried to get up,” Peter said weakly. “Couldn’t—couldn’t push off with my feet. Tried to drag myself up the wall by my fingertips—worked until I lost concentration. Then I fell. Hit my leg again—it’s, like, way past broken. I think I blacked out for a second again.” His face was bloody as he stared up at her. There was a bruise forming around his eye. His suit was torn in several places, and his leg—well, legs shouldn’t stick at that angle. Kate thought she was doing very well for not hurling.
“Yeah? Well. Punk pissed me off.”
Billy, the teen who had actual magic at his fingertips, as far as Natasha could tell, levitated above them all. A sheer shield of purple magic protected them from the onslaught of fire raining down on the team. Everyone available had been called out for this one, including the new recruits from Avengers Academy, children as young as thirteen—powered children, but still. Perhaps

Peter Rogers watched everyone around the bunker ready themselves for the fight ahead. This time, though, it wasn’t in response to a rip in the universe, or time, or whatever, depositing something unpleasant in an inconvenient place. No, this time they weren’t just reacting—they were going after Hydra, taking the fight to the rat’s nest that the other world’s Fury had sussed out somehow. According to alternate Fury, while they had small cells located throughout New York—and the world—the Red Skull and a bulk of their weapons were hunkered down in a castle in Sokovia.

“So you took four unnecessary turns to get to the bathroom in the next hall over instead of taking two and going back to your room? Uh huh,” 3490 Steve said. “Sounds perfectly logical.”

“What if it
“Most of the file was redacted,” Natasha responded. “It’s an anomaly amongst the others. We need the full file, the real file.” Clint was having difficulty focusing single-mindedly on the mission at hand. How could he, when there was such a nice steak in front of him? Natasha had no such problems. She had yet to touch her salmon.
“I don’t think so…”
“Why?” Steve asked, arguing. “3490 has shown us pretty clearly that they’re only trying to protect us. Those AIM agents were after

But still, it hit him like a slap that his own teammates all preferred her. For some reason, it hurt him most of all that
“Leave him alone, Jamie,” Kate said. She didn’t sound particularly bothered, and went straight back to reading her documents. Peter wasn’t sure if he was grateful for his sister’s intervention or embarrassed by it. ”He gets enough shit at school.”

199999 was not attacking 3490. They were attacking the Chitauri.
“What face?”

“No,” Peter answered. He picked a spot away from the others in the corner, dropped his pillow on the ground, and settled down, facing away from them. There was no point in lying. But there was no point in talking, either. He closed his eyes, exhausted, but knowing that he wouldn’t sleep. The images that danced in his mind’s eye—the windows of the 91

“You’re more than welcome, Jamie,” Tony said. “Now, take that with you. Show it off to everybody at the Christmas party tonight. Brag a little. Have people throw shoes at it. It’ll be great fun.” James laughed.
“Come with me,” she said. “We’re going to have a discussion.”
“Everybody’s all good?” he asked. Clint and Natasha nodded, Tony scowled, Bruce looked a bit too calm, and Thor just frowned.
Steve couldn’t help it—he winced at that. He wanted nothing more than to run out of the room, tail tucked between his legs, or melt into a puddle on the floor, but neither of those things were an option. 3490 Tony grabbed another tool off the table, busying herself again.
“Yeah. Yeah, I guess we did.”

“Afterglow’s a good look on you, Commander Capsicle,” Other Tony said. Most of the Other Avengers had joined Steve in the kitchen, which seemed to be a hub of activities these days; the only ones absent were Thor and Jane, who were, he was told, out on a dinner date. He supposed the increased activity in the kitchen was because everyone needed to eat, but also because there was an increase of coffee addicts in his house. He’d needed to buy four times as much coffee as usual, and Steve usually bought a
“Evening,” his Other self spoke, and Clint felt a chill go down his spine. There was nothing weirder than hearing your own voice come out of someone else’s mouth. It sounded different, but no different than his own voice sounded to him on recordings. It was a jarring experience all the same. “I’m Clint, nice to meet you other-me, Natasha.”
to land directly in the middle of the SHIELD helicarrier. Or perhaps they had been aiming for another universe entirely—it wasn’t like she was expecting visitors today. The Other Avengers just stared around blankly for a moment. Other Tony was the first to snap out of it and speak up.
—James would be lying if he said he wasn’t excited. To say it was exclusive was to say the Avengers were picky about members. Largely the scene of the mutant crowd, not even Academy kids—that is to say, SHIELD Academy kids, half of whom were just a small step away from mutant—were invited. Famous people seemed to be the only non-mutants ever allowed inside. James had no idea how Kate had managed to get tickets inside, even if she

movie,” Tony said sarcastically.
He remembered vaguely what had happened. There had been a group of “AIM” agents hounding him on the ground. He had been cut off from the rest of the group and called for assistance, but none was coming fast enough, and then one of the agents had managed to hit his mic, and half his face, with a blue laser that numbed him but did little else. His mic had shorted out. He’d swung away to take shelter in a nearby building before he realized that was exactly what the agents wanted him to do. They had herded him to that spot, and there was an even bigger group ready to take him down. They seemed to want to take him alive, and Peter guessed that was, in fact, the only reason why he was still breathing considering how heavily armed they had all been.
“Exactly. But did I ever tell you why I gave you
“You know, I

“Except,” Tony said venomously, “apparently Mr. Red-White-And-Blue!”
Steve,” Steve clarified for him. “Are you uh—is there a reason you’re drinking in my room?”
“ALPHA SIX FORMATION!” James boomed across the gym. Considering that their safehouse was in an old warehouse, their gym was quite a substantial size. It allowed them to actually move around and get some real training in. For the past three days they had received no calls to head outside and had instead drilled formations and pre-formed plans over and over and over again. There were a lot of them, and Tony did his best to compartmentalize them all in his brain, tucking them away into the proper corners. Tony got into the Alpha Six formation (really, who
“If I’m not,” Kate said, “then I don’t know what the hell my entire childhood was about. All right, if we’re set, let’s move out.” She marched into the lead, headed down the hill they’d landed on and into the trees ahead, other Clint following just one step behind. Natasha stood beside him as he just stood there for a moment.
As he watched Pepper wave goodbye to the children she so clearly wished were hers, Tony couldn’t watch anymore. He headed to the living room where he knew Antonella was. He would get answers. He had to.

because if she hadn’t found him making out with Torrun he would have been the first person she would have run to after Peter and James. Francis looked genuinely hurt, and Kate was warring with being disgusted with herself and furious with him.

James Rogers knew that whenever anybody sneered at him that he had ‘daddy issues’, they meant it as an insult, but honestly he was the first one to admit it. He and his father didn’t get along. James had issues with that. It affected him. He’d still sock anybody on the jaw who said he had ‘daddy issues’, but he didn’t mind admitting to
Chapter 61: Tuesday, November 29, 2016
Peter didn’t know if James liked ball games or not. He sat stoically in his seat, clapping for the team whenever anything exciting happened but not doing anything else. He was silent. When they were kids, he’d been more enthusiastic about it, as had Peter. They used to get hot dogs and chew bubblegum and go for ice cream later in the day as a family (minus Mom, who didn’t have the patience for sports). It was a day for junk food and screaming your lungs out and had once actually been fun. But then they’d both gotten older. James and Dad started fighting more frequently. James moved to New York for the military academy, and contrary to what
“I don’t,” Steve replied. When the bartender returned with Tony’s drink, Steve ordered one of his own. Tony took a sip of his brandy, watching Steve with dark eyes.

, I’m going, he’s my brother. Just try and stop me Carbon Copy,” Kate said fiercely. Steve wondered briefly, erroneously, just how many nicknames (or were they slurs?) they had for people from other universes.
There were many things in life that Kate Rogers hated. Spinach, for one. She used to cross her arms and glue her mouth shut while her father looked down at her with a disappointed frown and an “eat-your-vegetables” standard speech while her mother kept her lips glued shut to keep from laughing. She hated going into her mother’s lab, because she inevitably got grease or oil all over whatever she was wearing. She hated the dentist, with their scraping tools and drills and bland customer service smiles. She hated lots of things, but at this moment Kate Rogers thought that the one thing she hated most in the world was
“It’s
“Well, it’s lucky to have a beautiful subject,” he said. “You were so wonderful that day. I’ve never seen a better ballet. I’m so proud of you Kate.” He took her hand and moved her so that she was standing to his side, so she could better see his face. He was very serious. “I know you’ve been having a hard time lately, Katie. I don’t know what’s going on, specifically, but you’re obviously struggling with something. And I
He took over your armor remotely! What are you gonna do, spout science at them until they give up?” Carol demanded as they flew.
Tony sloshed the mix into shot glasses. Even if she couldn’t drink, hadn’t drunk for years, it didn’t mean she didn’t remember all the best recipes. In her own shot glass she had a modified recipe of the same drink—all syrups and flavorings with ginger ale. It wasn’t the same, but it would do. And if she started feeling itchy for the real deal later in the night, well, she knew Steve would keep an eye on her. He wouldn’t be drinking either—well, he’d be drinking, but the alcohol wouldn’t affect him. She took another bottle, filled with a blue liquid filled with ingredients she’d carefully crafted in the early nineties, and put it in two separate shot glasses. She handed one to Other Steve and one to Bucky. Bucky, of course, took it with a grin. Other Steve just looked confused.
“It’s only three days max, then we move to the next one,” James said. “We’ll fit until then. It’s not going to be comfortable, but we’ll make it work.”
“I’m not interested in winning points with you, Katherine. I’m your mother. That’s not my job. My job is to raise you drug and alcohol free with hopefully enough skills to succeed in the world,” her mother stated coolly.
“Well that’s a load of bull,” Steve said, rolling his eyes. Tony looked at him sharply. Steve just raised an eyebrow. “Oh, please, Tony. Does Harley ring any bells?” Tony looked so indignant and mad it was hilarious.
“Ah—no. No. The leaks only make things worse,” Dr. Richards explained. “We have our Thor looking for a, uh, gauntlet. The infinity gauntlet—do you know it?”

And then there were the 199999 Avengers themselves. It was always weird, to know someone and not, but it was weirder now that they had to spend every waking minute with them. Before, Peter could almost ignore their presence in their mansion on Long Island—but in the tiny bunker, it was an impossibility. Clint wasn’t as funny. Natasha was almost silent as a rule. Maria, not really a member of the Avengers as such but nevertheless part of the team, was a lot less terrifying, but that only made things weirder. And Peter didn’t even want to get started on his parents’ doubles.
“Doesn’t a woman with wi-fi in her brain seem a little far fetched?” Tony asked. “If she can turn her mind into a PC there’s no telling what she can do to ours.”
“Peter, it’s five in the morning—what are you doing up?” she asked. She didn’t sound scolding so much as baffled. The boy looked up, startled, and Tony found himself startled in turn by the boy.

He glanced at them only briefly before speaking into his comm. “Target locked, Commander. EMP at the ready. We need to put her down. I’ve got a sedative.” Tony took a brief moment to wonder how on earth anyone communicated with Clint via an earpiece, but he got a partial answer just moments later as the Commander turned to face them. He looked livid, and he signed something. Tony guessed that it was the sign for

“Then they’re the only intelligent ones on that whole team,” Steve said, quirking an eyebrow up. Perhaps he didn’t hold the same opinion—perhaps he thought the others were more suspicious than they let on. Tony didn’t know, and Tony didn’t care, because her husband looked so very

It didn’t escape Steve’s notice. But even if he intended it as an insult, Steve preferred it. They could speak as father and son, not as Commander and Captain. Steve sighed in resignation. He stood and put a hand on James’ shoulder. James looked surprised to see it there.

“Shortcut,” Other Clint replied gleefully just as Steve admonished,
“Just because it worked here doesn’t mean anything,” Tony told him quietly as he got up. Steve looked at him, surprised. Tony wasn’t returning his gaze. He looked far away, lost in thought.

Of course, no single experiment was ever scientifically sound—tests had to be repeated and the results repeated for an accurate conclusion to be drawn, which was why other than the stick in her hand, there were six other tests, all different brands but all with the same result, in the trash. Who knew Other Clint was a fucking clairvoyant.
“I did,” Thor said in his voice that boomed no matter at what volume he spoke. “The tesseract is still on Asgard.”
He didn’t know how long he’d been down there. It felt like hours that he squatted behind that car, putting pressure on this man’s wound, but it was probably only a few, agonizing minutes. Eventually James realized the man wasn’t breathing anymore. Shocked, he pulled his red hands away. The man was young, with a scruffy brown beard, a skinny scarf and fashionable clothes. On any other day, James would have called him a hipster. But at that moment, he could think of nothing but the fact that he must have only been a few years older than himself, that he’d likely been enjoying a Christmas party at one of the businesses or apartments nearby, that he’d never expected to get shot in the leg and bleed out on Christmas Eve.
“I said puppies and kittens, not cats and dogs,” Steve clarified. He put his pint down on the bar. “But fine. I’ll pretend, for a moment, that you’re being completely honest. Even if you don’t like kids, they’re only around a few hours a day. They don’t interact with us when they can help it, unless we invite them to first. So this isn’t about dealing with them, is it?”

“Do you—do you think she’d do that? Would you?”
“But what if it’s capable of opening portals throughout the multiverse,” Tony finished. Kate turned her gaze to him, a little startled. Perhaps it was bad of her, but she often forgot that the MCU Avengers were even remotely competent—although they’d handled the lead at Bryant Park admirably. She knew they didn’t have any prior knowledge of the multiverse and hadn’t expected any of them to say a word. But here was the alternate version, the male version, of her mother, walking closer to Thor and tapping the palm of one hand with his smartphone in thought. “The kind of energy from one space stone demands reciprocity. It would be like a, like a magnet to another space stone, two magnets with the same polarity. They’d have to swap. Swap places, right? You couldn’t have two in one universe.”
“I—well—I kind of…I kind of figured that I had
“I couldn’t tell you how much,” Steve replied simply. Tony looked at the brewing pot of coffee, and then turned it off.
“Want a hit?” Kate asked. Steve shook his head.
“I figured you just had a stick up your ass,” Tony continued, “But I was wrong. Rhodey lets me forget, sometimes. Because he’s always laughing, and even as serious as he can get, he can take a joke. So he lets me forget that soldiers don’t always laugh, and the ones that don’t have a good reason not to. I just hope you know that sometimes laughter can help.”
It was chaos, all around them. People shouting and running this way and that. The patterns weren’t predictable as Hydra agents made their way to various positions throughout the castle, ready to fend off the attackers out front. If even one agent spotted them, they would be swarmed. Overwhelmed almost instantly. Kate knew that, for all of her training, she wasn’t going to be able to fight off this many people at once. And it was made worse, she thought, by the fact that these were the same weapons, and the same type of people, who had haunted her father’s nightmares for decades. They were a fairy story. A bedtime cautionary tale. The red skull had never been real to her—not until they turned a corner into what was once the palace’s great hall and found him at the back and center, where one might have found a throne. There were no other agents to be seen. He was waiting for them. Clearly, obviously, waiting for them.
“It’s a…projector?” James asked. There in thin air was a shield like his father’s. It was clearly a holograph, and it moved when he moved his arm.

reside there anymore. Perhaps that was why he forgot to ask the obvious question that Tony voiced:
woken. He could feel his eyes blink open, but everything was dark. For a moment, panic gripped him—was he blind? Had he lost his vision from a head injury? But no—his eyes adjusted slowly, and he realized that the world around him was simply very dark. He could barely see his hand in front of his face. His leg was throbbing, but he tried not to think about it too much. He removed the glove on his right hand, feeling for his web shooter. It had a couple of other functions than just shooting web, and one of them was a very small flashlight. It was just a pinprick of light, no bigger than anything you would get from a phone’s camera, but it was far brighter than any available light source. He moved his wrist about, coughing from dust and surveying the area.
Steve didn’t know how to interpret what he was feeling. Everything just seemed so
“Not kidnapped,” she said. “Not worse.

“Hey. Eggs for you.” There was a plate of eggs thrust under Kate’s nose. She looked up to see Francis staring down at her. His expression was a mixture of pity and concern and it left a bitter taste in Kate’s mouth. She shoved the plate away.
“Why did we have to meet now?” Natasha asked. She had left the card game swiftly upon receiving Coulson’s text. The text alone was innocuous—
“There are ways to get information without hacking, uh,
“I keep telling you.”
“Let’s just
“I said—you play any sports?” he repeated. “You have to. You’re too in shape not to.”
“Go ‘way,” Kate said, her face smashed into the pillow.
“Urgh. I take it back. I take back everything bad I ever said about Mom’s cooking, because this—“ Peter began, but then he stopped. Kate felt like she’d been slapped. Judging by how quickly the blood drained from Peter’s face, he had, too. He just put the plate down on the floor next to him and brought his knees up, resting his chin on top of them. Kate just squeezed her mug tighter. For a moment, he’d forgotten. Kate, on the other hand, never had. Kate hadn’t slept. Kate couldn’t eat. Kate couldn’t think about anything, except for the fact that her mother was dead and it was all her fault.
“Steve…”
when it was 3490 Steve. It was like Tony had contracted amnesia and conveniently forgotten all the deep conversations he’d ever had with the man. It was an unsettling feeling, to have someone know things about you that you had never given them permission to know. Other than that, one other thing stuck out in Tony’s brain.
“Mom forgoing dramatics, that’s a new one,” Kate muttered, but Tony heard it and shot her a look. But even Peter was holding back a grin at that one, so it wasn’t a
“I’m coming!”
“How was I ever
what he’s doing?” Tony nodded stiffly. “Good. Then we all have our orders. Tasha, Clint, you and I are going to scope out locations where those three and the kid can work without raising too many suspicions. There’s one other thing we need to discuss, though. I think we should be helping out 3490 in battle.”
“—Count her out just yet,” Peter heard MCU Steve say. “We don’t know that 3490 Tony is dead.”
“So,” she said, “I know you’re all hoping to go home this evening. We were hoping you would go home this evening as well. Unfortunately, we’ve hit a bit of a snag.” She watched as all the hopeful faces dropped into ones of dread. She forced herself to keep going. “The cosmic cube that was used to send you here did not have any regard for
Peter had spent so many years watching his mom and dad run off into danger. He never knew if they were going to come back (although, when he was younger, he assumed they were invincible, immortal, infallible, in that way that young children always assume the adults in their life are). And as he got older, he had realized that this was going to be a theme for him, forever. Not only would his parents continue to run off into danger, but Peter knew Jamie would, with the military. He figured Kate would, eventually, if only out of boredom with everything else. Francis would, Azari would, Torrun would… and he’d realized he was permanently sidelined by virtue of being a skinny, slightly below average strength, beanpole with no real athletic ability.
what was happening, but Tony figured it would be an apt enough description for the layman. Tony heard a few more guns get loaded. The console began to shake, and small items to rattle—pens vibrated on desks, coffee mugs began to slosh their contents—and then a bright blue light broke through the ceiling of the helicarrier, going straight through the central console. Tony closed her eyes as the light got too bright, and then, when she could sense that it was darker, she opened them again.
“Am I late to the party? I see the gang’s all here,” Bruce, 3490 Bruce, walked up the stairs to the control deck.
“We work in relatives. It’s what we do. I know,” Natasha said, taking a breath. “I just want to know their angle.”

, and that’s as generous as I’m getting.”
“Just in California?”
“Yes, exactly that,” Steve said, entirely genuine.
“Yeah, if only it wouldn’t take me several bottles of this sticky sweet shit to get there,” Antonella said. She examined the glass. “God, if I weren’t pregnant I would’ve gone for the good shit in that cabinet.” Tony froze, but Antonella kept right on talking. “Fuck twenty years of sobriety, I’d throw all the AA chips in the fucking trash. I don’t even think my kids could keep me away from it right now. I don’t think I have the strength left. You’re the first person I’ve told that. Not about the drinking, though, that too, I guess.
“No,” Tony said, and Steve was grateful that the answer was a hundred percent honest—he had a niggling feeling that Commander Rogers would be able to suss out a lie in an instant. Commander Rogers still looked suspicious, but he didn’t disagree. Nor did he ask if
Bruce, despite his brief encounter with the 199999 Avengers, had not yet really interacted with them much. He was not aware that any of them were particularly close to his own Avengers or their children yet—it had only been three weeks, after all. He was, therefore, a bit gobsmacked when Peter texted him to meet him at Stark Tower and he arrived to find male Tony and his own double in the lab with Peter sticking to the ceiling, barefoot.
“JARVIS?” Peter rasped. “JARVIS are you there?” There was no answer. Whatever has shorted his mic must have shorted the whole system. Peter felt his stomach sink to his feet. They would think he was dead. They had probably thought he was dead shortly before he ever even entered the building. Worse: they had no way of finding him. “Shit.”
