“I thought about you tonight,” Dean told him. “This girl was hitting on me. She was tall, dark brown hair that was almost black and blue eyes.”
Dean had many more questions, which was probably why he followed Castiel without a fight. Normally, he would act bratty when Castiel was telling him what to do but something told him now wasn’t the time. He wasn’t sure why, but he was excited.
This did not stop Dean. It only encouraged him to move forward. He repeated the motions of his mouth but decided to go a bit further. Dean reached out with his hand and lightly palmed Cas’ balls.
“Oh,” Dean’s shoulders slumped and he took a drink of his water. He wasn't sure what to say to him really. When Castiel had talked about her, he talked about how much he had loved her and how she took him on so many adventures most people don’t get to take. But then again, he wanted to be in one place and not move around so much and she simply could not give him that. “So, do you think you are going to be getting back together?”
Castiel reached down and grabbed the next gift handing it off to Dean. Before Castiel even had a chance to blink, Dean had the wrapping paper pulled off and tossed aside. Under the wrapping paper was another box. Dean sighed but quickly pulled open the box to reveal a flannel shirt, closest to the color of Castiel’s eyes that he could find.
“No,” Dean shook his head, reaching up and rubbing the back of his neck with his hand. “I don’t need time. I want us to try this.”
“And when you get all freaked out,” Dean laughed, remembering that one time Cas thought a bear was raiding their camp and he went pale as a ghost. Dean thought he was going to cry but he was too scared to do even that. Dean had to sleep in Cas’ tent that night. “Who is going to stop you from passing out.”
“I am okay with it if you are okay with it,” Cas told Dean. “But, if you aren’t okay with it, I am also okay with us leaving.”
“No,” Dean leaned in a little closer. He could feel Castiel’s hot breath hit against his lips. He knew that he should pull away but he couldn’t do it. He wanted this, at least he felt like this is what he wanted. “But don’t let me be the one to stop you.”
Castiel put out his hand, allowing him to climb in. Once he was settled in bed, he placed the fairy on the pillow by his head.
Dean stopped and turned to face Castiel. He could feel all of the color drop from his face and by the way Castiel turned from bothered to concerned, he knew that Castiel had seen it happen too.
Dean liked Nurse Moseley. She was older and set in her ways. But at the same time, she cared a great deal. Even though he had never spoken to her, she seemed to know what he needed, when he needed it. Of all the nurses that were here throughout the course of the week, she was by far his favorite.
He threw the door open and suddenly the light overtook him, he wanted to scream from the pain but there wasn’t any. The light consumed him, swallowed him whole and his entire body came alive. Instead of fighting it, he let it in, accepted it.
More time passed by before he felt Castiel touch him again. This time it was to remove the headphones and the blindfold. When he opened his eyes, the lights were off but everything was so clear. His husband sitting in front of him, rubbing his sides to bring him back to reality. Everything about it was beautiful and perfect and without even thinking about it, he cried.
Turning around, Dean came face to face with the angel. And damn if he didn’t look amazing. He looked exactly the same as he always did but amazing nonetheless. Dean even thought his trenchcoat was sexy. When the fuck did a trenchcoat become something other than what a predator would wear? Though, if Cas wanted to make Dean his prey, he would let him.
Cas looked from Dean to the book in his hand. It was a cookbook with recipes for four hundred different kinds of pies.
Technically, when it came to trades, they were still on top, making them the richest if Kingdoms. Michael knew the supply and demand needed throughout the land and now, if you were in need, you had to pay a pretty fortune to get these things. This has caused a downfall in other Kingdoms. Castiel hated that the greed of his Uncle was destroying a land his father had once described as a ‘beautiful unity of mankind.’ If his father could see the world now, he would surely be grateful that he is dead.
Castiel held open the door and Dean stepped in, only to pause and look between the two people who were now looking him over. Meg was never usually there when Dean showed up in the middle of the night.
Castiel stops and looks at Dean with a fake concerned look, which Dean returns before Castiel turns back to face the camera.
“Whatever Clarence,” she scoffed. “I can see that Dean here needs your undivided attention. I guess I will be the one that comes back tomorrow.”
When he was young, Castiel's mother, used to tell him stories about the fairies. They helped with the prosperity of the land. Honestly, Castiel never really believed they were real. But here he was, trying to figure out how to keep one hidden in the palace from his uncle.
“English,” Ruby offered up her major which just sounded like a class one would take. Dean knew better than that though, his grandparents being a teacher and a librarian but still, English sounded like a class, not a job.
“Last time,” Dean begins, “when we ate the Ghost Pepper, we ate it and then immediately went to the relief mechanisms. The dairy products. Right? Well, the people who help us make this show…”
Ruby blushed and put her hand on his lap. For some reason he moved it away, but quickly apologized to her. It was not his intention. She did not seem mad, since he apologized right away. He knew this was going to take some getting used to.
“Okay,” a small amount of hopefulness made its way back into Cas’ voice, but it was still small, the way it used to be when they were kids.
Dean complained a lot, but he was generally happy with his life. He was in the process of buying Singer Auto from his Uncle who wanted nothing more than to retire. He lived in the apartment above the shop, so he didn’t have to pay rent. His brother had recently graduated from Law School and had finally moved home. Sam had even gotten a job at one of the better law firms in town, not that there were many. Two, there were two.
“I see strong cheekbones,” he continued. “A mouth that houses a smile that lights up the entire room when the man possessing it decides to grace us with its presence.”
“That would be one of the things,” Castiel nearly laughed out his answer. This was not how he’d expected any of this to go.
Castiel didn’t say anything. He stepped back from Dean, never breaking eye contact and slowly began to remove his clothes, until he was standing in front of Dean, completely naked. Dean was sure that he would have a heart attack, except he was young and completely healthy, well, maybe not completely healthy.
“I am not crazy either,” Castiel informed Dean. “I know that I sounded like a rambling mad man in there, but I believe what I said. As crazy as I am aware that it sounded.”
Dean almost cried as he read over Castiel’s words, being as he was turning into a freaking cry baby these days. He knew that he did not fully understand his feelings but he also knew that he did not want to lose Castiel. Castiel was the first person in a long time who had really got to him. Castiel made him smile, even better, he made Dean laugh. It had been a very long time since Dean had laughed and genuinely meant it.
“Sure,” Castiel shoved his hands into his pockets and followed Dean. “I am not very good. I think I have played all of two times, maybe three.”
"You used to stand so close to me." Dean continued on. "Personal space was never a characteristic you had. Now, you barely get within ten feet of me unless you absolutely have to. What gives man?"
“If we were reading something about an explicit pairing between Harry Styles and Barack Obama,” Dean holds back a laugh for even having to say that out loud, “known as the ever-popular Hobama ship, that we’d probably enjoy just fine.”
“Yeah,” Castiel shook his head. “You know you can’t lie to me. So, you may as well tell me what is bothering you.”
Castiel groaned at the sound of his phone going off near his head. It didn’t feel like morning and he was fairly certain that wasn’t his alarm clock tone. After a few moments of struggling to force his eyes open, he is reaching across the bed and swiping his finger across the screen. He really should have looked at whatever name was on his caller ID but that would have taken more time than he had if he was going to actually answer the phone, which he stupidly did.
That seemed to be enough to get Dean’s attention. He’d had enough noise complaints because of his music, he didn’t need another one and Castiel selfishly used that to his advantage. Hopefully, the neighbors were not truly angry with him. He didn’t want this mess to be the reason Dean also lost his apartment, as shitty as the apartment was.
“They are just preparing you for the future,” Dean laughed at his son, who complained every morning about the time it was. Ever since Ben was born he had been a night time baby. He slept during the day and was wide awake at night. Made for some tiresome nights in their home but he got a little better as he got older.
“While I agree with your husband here, Mr. Winchester, that violence is never the answer. I do understand why she did what she did.”
“Oh?” Dean was getting angry again. He stood himself up, pacing back and forth in front of where Cas was sitting. “Just oh?”
Cas logged into Sam’s computer and began to search for anything and everything, doing exactly what Dean had already done. But he appreciated the help. But damn, Cas was sitting right next to him. Occasionally, their knees would brush up against one another and it sent chills through Dean’s body and made his cock strain a little harder against his jeans. He tried to brush it away.
The darkness that had taken over his eyes went away and he could see it all. His eyes were still covered but he could see Castiel between his legs. He was looking up at him with giant blue eyes as he swallowed all of Dean down his throat again and again. Then he was cumming. What normally felt good but muted took over his entire body. He was on fire, he was freezing. Everything his body could possibly feel rushed through his body all at once and he was certain that he passed out for a moment before regaining consciousness.
“Wiping away,” Castiel continues, “every orifice that's gonna leak with pain and there's gonna be blood coming out of my ears. I don’t know what's going to happen.”
“I promise to return soon.” Castiel grabbed his satchel and threw it over his shoulder. “Is there anything you would like for me to pick up from the market for you?”
A sound alerted back. Sam was probably telling him that he hated him too and couldn’t wait to see him or something along those lines. If you did not know they were brothers, you would think from their text messages that they did not really like each other. But what were brothers for?
“I think,” Dean looked at Cas and then looked down at his watch. “I don’t think I am going to be able to make it to work in the morning, unless I can maybe get an hour of sleep.”
The question threw Dean. He didn’t get to decide how Castiel felt but he was certain that Castiel had no idea what it was that he was admitting. Sure, Castiel may love Dean. He may care about him deeply. Hell, the angel had risked his life many times in order to protect or defend Sam and himself. But that was not the kind of love that Dean was going for.
“Talk to me,” Dean sat back in his chair, his voice demanding, though he had not really meant for it to be. But something was up and this needed to end. “What is going on?”
“Why do we gotta go bring her into this?” Dean asks the camera. Dean and Lisa had been together for two years of the show's run, but it ended about five years ago.
"What is happening?" Another voice? Dean did not recognize this voice but he could tell that it was a woman before he actually saw her.
As Dean washed over his body, he continued to think about his evening. He thought about Ben not being home and how he was glad that his son was moving on in life, like he should be doing. He thought more about Bela and how he wished that he could apologize to her but he really didn't know how to go about it. And then he thought about Castiel, whose house he never should have shown up at.
“Dean,” Castiel finally spoke, bringing Dean’s breathing back to a more manageable level. “Maybe we should take a step back from this.”
Dean stepped into the shower and let the hot water roll over his skin. At first it made him jump, remembering the burning pain from the light in his dream but soon it felt wonderful, loosening the muscles in his neck and shoulders, enough to help him make it through another day of work. One of these days he was going to get a massage. He told himself this exact thing every morning though and still hasn’t pursued it.
“Sure,” Dean agreed. He was not sure what talking to her in private was going to lead to and he was not sure if he was prepared for it, but he was going to give it his best. “We could go over and sit in my truck.”
I think if Cas has been in love with you for 19 years, or whatever, that you have been in love with him for 20.
“Dean,” Castiel turned his body into Dean, their eyes never losing contact with one another. “Do you think I should get back together with her?”
“Good,” She moved closer to him and smiled up at him from her red solo cup. Dean could tell by the look in her eyes that she had been drinking quite a bit. He was not sure what to think about that really. You never knew what to expect of college girls. This could end up well or it could end up incredibly bad.
“Remind me to throw every notebook in this house into the fire.” Castiel grabbed the notebook from Dean’s hand and tossed it across the room.
Dean was not a big bar frequenter these days. When he did show up it was generally with Sam, his dad or his grandfather Samuel. If there was no one to go to the bar with him, he was better off drinking at home or not drinking at all. Drinking alone was never really the best and only made him dwell on the fact that Lisa was dead. He definitely refused to drink alone if Ben was around. Ben did not need to see his father in that kind of emotional state.
He had been knocking for ten whole minutes. He knew Dean was in there, his car was parked out front and he could hear music coming from Dean’s room. He tried to use his kept to get in but Dean had locked the chain lock and unless Castiel felt compelled enough to break it, he could not get in.
Cas slowly fucked himself into Dean, holding onto him so tightly that Dean was certain he was going to have bruises on his body when he woke up in the morning, but he didn’t care. He wanted Cas to destroy him. And that is what Cas did, slowly at first but gradually picking up speed and the forcefulness with which he drove himself into Dean.
“Rowena cursed me, man,” Dean answered. He then went into detail about the curse and what he was trying to do and what he had already done.
“Okay, let’s see,” Dean looked over at the presents. “Right. A gift that makes you think of the other person.”
“Because he is your best friend and it’s your super fun filled birthday weekend,” Sam answered, a look of confusion on his face. “Why? Are you guys not talking right now or something?”
The fairy nodded eagerly. He seemed to have more faith in this plan than Castiel did but he also knew what he could do. Like, kill Castiel in his sleep. He could probably do that.
“What? You wanted to fuck with me? You wanted to hurt me?” Dean was all but screaming now. “What could you possibly have wanted?”
Dean quickly pulled open the door and made his way toward his car. He could feel Castiel watching him leave but he could not let it stop him. What Castiel had done was wrong and they both knew it. Dean deserved to leave. He deserved to run away. He deserved to never have to talk to Castiel again, if he wanted to; though, that was never going to happen. In the end, he was still Cas.
“Yes, Dean,” Castiel cried out, his orgasm hitting him so hard that his breath caught in his chest and for a moment he couldn’t breathe.
“I was thinking,” Castiel can’t help but rant, his disappointment from this episode coming off him in waves, “I can’t wait to do that again with an even hotter pepper.”
“Dean Winchester,” Castiel raised his voice just slightly. “Stand in front of that mirror or I will go home and I will tell Meg I was wrong and want to be with her.”
Castiel slammed the top of his laptop down and tossed it to the end of his bed. Everything he had been fighting to hold on to had come to an end. He was going to lose Dean. Well, Jimmy was going to lose Dean but it was a part of Dean that Castiel needed. He needed to be able to tell Dean that he loves him. He needed to be able to hear about the parts of his day that Dean kept locked up inside and didn’t share with him. Sure, Dean told him enough but he never opened up to Castiel the way that he did with Jimmy and he was losing that. Either way, he was losing a big part of Dean.
They kissed for what felt like an endless amount of time. Time did not matter. They were holding each other, taking each other in. They were living in a moment that Dean felt neither of them had ever had and it was magical. But soon Castiel pulled back and pushed Dean away from him.
Cas lifted his eyes from the floor to meet with Dean's. For a moment, Dean was so lost in them that he forgot that he was angry. But that only lasted a moment.
Castiel got dressed as soon as he realized Dean was gone. He was not going to let Dean feel like any of this was his fault and he was certain his best friend was already blaming himself. Dean had too many things in his life he blamed himself for, Castiel’s failed relationship was not going to be one of them.
Dean laid in bed staring at the ceiling until the early hours of the morning. He would close his eyes, only to find them opening again and examining the shapes in the room closer than they really needed. By the time five o’clock rolled around, he was texting Benny to let him know that he would not be into work for the day. He never called in sick and saying that he was sick was technically a lie, but he just couldn’t do it. He was exhausted and his mind would not shut up about the evening before.
“Something has been wrong with you all night,” Castiel answered. “You aren’t nearly as talkative and I don’t think you have smiled nearly as much as you usually do. So, what is going on?”
With that Principal Shurley called his secretary and had them call Claire down to the office with her stuff. They said their goodbyes as they waited for her arrival. Dean was still fuming. The conversation ended a lot sooner than he had expected and Castiel did not seem to be angry with how this was handle. Yes, the kid was just a kid, but Claire was not in the wrong here and Dean did not want to see her get punished because she felt that she needed to defend her feelings and her beliefs. Dean was certain Castiel and he were going to fight about how this was handled and he hated that. None of this was good.
Castiel wasn’t sure if he could answer the question. He did not want to lose his best friend because he had feelings for him. He had been in love with Dean since first grade and if he could not have admitted it throughout all the years the had spent together, how could he admit it now. Now would be nothing more than painful. But Dean had asked, and Dean deserved the truth.
Dean gathered up the supplies he needed and put them all into a bowl. This one required his blood. Why did they always require his blood? But he did it anyway, pulling the blade across his hand and allowing for the blood to drip into the bowl. Once it was all there, he read the spell aloud.
Sam had gotten sick. He couldn’t remember the last time either of them had been sick but somehow, his little brother got a damn cold. He had insisted on coming on the hunt with Dean but Dean shot that idea down the moment it came out of his mouth. He could handle a hunt on his own. Only, Sammy wasn’t hearing that. He agreed to stay home and work on getting better as long as Dean took Cas with him on the hunt. He wanted to make sure that someone had Dean’s back if the situation was worse than they expected. After a good hour of arguing, Dean finally caved and called Cas, hoping he would be too busy to join him. He wasn’t too busy.
“Like,” Dean starts to speak but then takes a deep breath before continuing. “I feel like I am going to vomit now, and I haven’t even put it in my mouth yet. This looks like the heart of Satan himself.”
Dean thanked his mom for keeping Ben for the evening, though she was more than happy to have him. They were a little angry when fifteen-year-old Dean got his girlfriend pregnant but from the day that Ben was born, they loved him like he was their fourth son and he loved them just the same. If he was not at home or at a friend’s, Ben was spending time with his grandma, grandpa and occasionally his uncle Adam, if Adam was not off doing whatever seventeen year olds do these days. He also spent time with Lisa’s parents but they lived a couple hours away and it was harder for him to see them.
“You are not going to die,” Castiel argued. “What do I have to do? I assume I have to be naked for this?”
Once they were both naked, Dean grabbed Cas and led him over to the bed, slightly pushing him. Cas took the hint and crawled onto the bed, lying on his back in the middle. Dean was fairly certain his angel had never done this before, at least not with a man. Technically, he hadn't ever been with a man either. But unlike in his coma induced dream, Dean was not afraid to move forward.
“And this is Castiel Novak,” Dean turned his head to see a man sitting in the corner. He looked older than everyone else and definitely did not look like he fit into this scene, which Dean could relate to. He was wearing nice black slacks that fit neatly with his polished black shoes. A dark blue shirt that you could almost confuse for black, tucked into them. A tie tied loosely around his neck. Dean assumed there was a black jacket to go with the outfit, he just wasn’t wearing it at the time. Not really the type of person Dean spent that much time with, though strangely, he wanted to.
Once they were all settled in, Balthazar started making burgers on his portable grill. Dean would have been excited about this part, except, the entire time he cooked, he was talking to Castiel and not in a way in which Dean appreciated. Dean knew for certain that Balthazar was into Cas and working hard to make it known.
Leaning down, Dean kissed at Cas' stomach, rolling his tongue occasionally over the skin. The sounds Cas made at this action made Dean so hard he hurt. He wanted to take his time with Cas, make it perfect. But considering how excited he was and how inexperienced Cas was, neither of them was bound to last long.
“Yeah,” Dean laughed, pulling his keys from the ignition, a habit he had formed when parking for more than a few minutes. “I was kind of curious about that one as well.”
“Cas” Dean cried out again and Cas leaned forward, his hot breath against the pelvic area above his penis. His mouth was so close, yet so far away.
Dean took a few deep breaths before pulling out his phone. He did not know why he was so nervous to make the call. It was not like he was asking some chick out on a date, he was just calling a dude that he met recently, for a beer. There was no harm in that. He just did not really know this guy and was unsure if it was alcohol that made the guy give him his card or if he really wanted to hang out sometime. Even when it came to making friends, Dean was getting rusty.
Soon the kissing became more passionate and hard. Castiel was kissing Dean back with intensity, working on pulling Dean’s AC/DC shirt off of his body. Dean lifted his arms to help, only disconnecting their lips long enough to get the shirt up over his head. They did not have to stop kissing for Dean to remove Castiel’s dark blue button up shirt. It took longer, but that only made Dean more excited once he got it off and tossed to the ground.
“What?” Bella looked down at him confused, a slight glimpse of hurt in her eyes. “You need to leave? Are you serious?”
“Yeah,” Dean answered. “I just need to lie down for a bit. Think I drank too much. I’ll uh, see you in a bit. Let me know if you find anything.”
They talked freely after that, laughing and going over all the times they had gone camping together. Dean was hoping that Cas would change his mind. Not because he did not want Cas to go camping but because he did not want Cas to get scared and have a bunch of stupid college kids laugh at him.
They talked for hours. Laughing about things they had done in their lives and how stupid they were looking back at those memories. They even talked about the harder stuff in life. Things that most would not share with someone they had barely met a few days ago.
Dean worked to convince himself as he leaned forward. The tip of Cas’ cock touched his lips and Dean sighed with relief when his first thought wasn’t to abort. In fact, as he wrapped his mouth around the tip of Cas’ cock, it felt right. This was Cas. He was pleasuring Cas. There was nothing he wanted more than to make Cas happy. And from the moan he received in this moment, he knew that he was doing that.
“Would it be okay if I stayed to help?” Castiel questioned. “I can do research and see if I spot something that you may have missed.”
“No,” Dean shook his head. “I want to do this. I am not sure what this is at the moment, but I want to do it.”
Finally, he gives up trying to get in the barn and turns around to walk away. A loud crash always stops him from taking his first step and he turns back to the barn, only to have the door wide open. It is at this point that he gets scared, unsure if he should enter the barn but he always does. He always finds his feet moving against his fear and soon he is standing right in the middle of the barn. It is dark and dirty and smells of musk.
Once he got home, Dean quickly showered, microwaved himself some crap tv dinner, grabbed a beer and settled in at his computer desk. He took a few deep breaths, working through the nerves of these newly discovered feelings and then signed in.
They laid in silence after that, listening to each other breathe over the phone. Castiel felt like he should panic. He’d just gotten off on the phone with his best friend. This could ruin everything they had built over the last twenty years, but deep down, he knew the truth. He knew that neither of them could hold down a relationship. He knew that they spent too many hours together instead of with other people. They knew that this was right and they had been hiding and fighting the truth in their relationship all these years. There was no panic, just complete calm, and completeness.
“Is this what you want Dean?” Cas asked. “You want me to take control, manhandle you and completely wreck you without your feet ever touching the ground?”
Dean moved onto his arms and legs. He was sure his arms would not be able to hold him for long once Castiel got started, but he wanted to start off in this position. Plus, he knew that his husband loved it when it became so good Dean dropped to the bed.
Hanging in a gold birdcage on the outside of the cart was a small person? It appeared to be a person. But it was no bigger than his finger and appeared to have wings.
“I’ll take,” Dean turns to face Jess, who is off to the side of the camera with their relief provisions. “I prefer yellow. I mean, the white.”
Dean was torn. Half of his body was completely lost in the moment, wanting more. The other half of his body though, was screaming bloody murder. He was more confused than he had ever been in his entire life. This was right. Cas was right. They were right. But this was wrong to him. Not in the way that something is wrong and you shouldn’t do it, but wrong in the way that it wasn’t what he was used to. He could get used to this but for now, his erection was pushed up another clothed erection and Dean was … scared. What the hell was he supposed to do with someone else’s penis?
“It’s your turn Dean,” Charlie interrupts, pushing the show along. They do have to try and stay within a certain frame of time.
“Hey,” He kissed the top of her forehead before letting her go and taking a seat on an empty log off to the side. At least Jess was here, he knew her outside of Sam’s friends and it was easier to carry on a conversation with her.
“Well, it needs to stop,” Meg yelled again, her eyes narrowing in on Dean, who was still sitting beneath the covers on Castiel’s bed. “We can’t be in a relationship if you are doing this.”
“Fuck,” Dean could not help the anger that escaped him. If he was not mad before, he was mad now. She lived in, not only his state, but his town as well. She knew that she was this close to him and she kept it from him. Did he really seem that scary?
Dean had thought about locating to a bigger town. Being a mechanic in a small town meant that business tended to be on the slow side. You had your regulars and your occasional break down on the freeway that required assistance. But Singer Auto had the benefit of not just being an auto repair shop, they were also a diner, and the only one left in town. Mabel’s, the competing diner had closed last year when Mabel passed away and her daughter didn’t want to keep it open. She sold the diner and the land it stood on and then returned to wherever the hell it was she was currently living.
“Oh,” Castiel caught on quicker than Dean had expected him to. “Well, we do have a profound bond. One might say it is even stronger than that of a soul mate.”
“Do you have protection?” She pulled away and whispered into his ear, pulling him back into reality. What was he doing? This is not why he came here. He did not come to this party to sleep with some college girl he barely knew in the front seat of his pickup. His son rode in his pickup.
Dean doesn’t seem to be listening to him anymore. He begins to bounce around on his feet before stopping at the back wall and punching it. He doesn’t hit it hard enough to knock anything down or put a hole in the wall, but Castiel knows he would have if he knew it would not cause Charlie to get angry at him for ruining the set. Dean screams at his lack of ability to destroy everything around him.
If Cas was going to fuck anyone tonight, Dean wished it was him. Dean could picture himself gripping tightly onto the horrible green comforter of the bed in his motel room. Cas would be on top of him, thrusting into him with all he had. Would Cas destroy him if he used all of his might to fuck Dean into the mattress? Would he have to hold himself back to not hurt Dean? Would Dean even want him to hold back?
“Hey Dean,” Jess smiled at Dean and walked over to give him a hug. Dean liked Jessica and thought that she was an amazing fit for Sam. She made him happy and he made her happy, what more could someone ask for in a relationship. Though they had only been together for a year, Dean saw much longer in their future, if not forever.
[greeneyedhunter] Well, if this guy that I know would just tell me his pen name, this could be avoided.
“Fuck,” he murmured to himself again. This time the word came out empty. He was no longer angry, he was just scared.
“I see a tall, strong man,” Castiel began. “A man who works hard and has the most amazing green eyes I have ever seen in my entire life.”
Dean was brought back to his room after the meeting with Dr. Mills. Normally, at this time, he would be out in the main room. It was where everyone had a chance to socialize or do some kind of activity. There were lots of things to do, from paying boards games or reading a book, all the way to watching movies or playing pool. They knew Dean hated being out there, so on days like today, they let him sit in solitude in his room.
“Dean,” Castiel finally turned around to face his best friend. It was at that moment he realized they both had tears in their eyes. Why was Dean crying? Was it because he just realized that he was going to lose his best friend?
“Now I know you are trying to get me fat,” Dean says with the biggest smile on his face. “This is awesome.”
“Let’s go twice as hot,” Castiel carries on with his rant. “Let’s go with the hottest pepper certified on earth. The Carolina Reaper.”
“You understand what?” Dean questioned, grabbing Castiel’s arm and forcing him to turn so that he had to look Dean in the eyes. “What is it you think you understand?”
“Such a good boy,” Castiel spoke, reaching up and running his hand through Dean’s hair. “Always my good boy.”
Back amongst the trees was a large cart, with carved out windows covered with thick wood. It looked like a cell within their dungeon. The wood was falling apart around it and a sad looking horse stood solemn at the front.
If you are watching the video online, this is where they would be airing a clip of when they ate the ghost pepper.
“I'm gonna go for a walk,” Dean stood up from his chair and headed toward his tent to grab a flashlight.
“Dean,” Cas reached up and began to unbutton his pants. “I am going to touch your cock and you are going to promise to stop me if it becomes too much. Understand?”
“Well,” Balthazar looked around the group of people who were watching them intently. “Maybe if he told me he was seeing someone, I wouldn't have.”
“Okay,” Castiel nodded, his body loosening up. He was still nervous but Dean knew he was not going to run away any time soon.
“Well,” Dean laughed, moving his arm and sliding it slightly behind her. “Sammy has a way of making people do things. Guess it is a good thing he is becoming a lawyer.”
“Please, Dean,” Castiel called through the small crack he could make in the door. “The neighbors are starting to get angry at me. Please let me in.”
“Did you find anything?” Dean asked, no hope in his voice. He had not believed that Cas was going to find an answer and if he did find an answer, Dean was sure the price for it would not be worth saving his life. If there was one person who understood the consequence of an action it was Dean. Sometimes the risks were not worth it.
Dean looked up at Cas who was looking at Dean with an expression he couldn’t make out. Had he said something out loud? Had he been talking to Dean? Dean had stopped noticing the world around him as soon as Cas touched his side.
Dean talked about Lisa. How they had lived next door to each other their entire lives and started to call each other boyfriend and girlfriend when they were about thirteen. He talked about how cheesy they were with each other and how people always told them that they were going to be together forever. He told Castiel about how they had gotten pregnant at fifteen and though a few people urged they give the baby up for adoption, they couldn’t do it. They decided to keep the baby and raise him.
“No. Dean wait.” Castiel stepped out and grabbed Dean’s arm, turning him around. “Will you please come in?”
“I made a list of the types of gifts we should get each other,” Dean said. “I thought it would be fun to have a kind of theme.”
“So,” Dean composed himself after a funny story Cas was recanting about them. “I think we need to talk about what happened in there.”
“Okay,” Dean began to pace again, working through all this information. It was all too much. He wanted this to make sense, but it didn’t. “I have to go.”
Castiel and Dean sat in silence after that. Dean finished off his water, occasionally glancing up at Castiel. He was not sure why he had given him so much information or why things were so awkward. He had a feeling that this friendship was not really going to last much longer and that hurt the worst. He really enjoyed Castiel and was hoping that he would be around for a while.
[greeneyedhunter] I don’t know. I have never been to prison. I don’t know how it works in the joint.
“I’m not holding your hand,” Dean growls, pushing Castiel’s hand away as he tries to get back to pacing the set.
“Here you go,” Castiel handed Dean a glass of water and sat down on the chair to the right of the couch. Dean looked Castiel over as he sat. He was in his pajamas, his hair in a mess and his face beginning to need a shave. He looked the most normal Dean had ever seen him and he liked seeing him that way.
“Reading fanfiction on the internet is as 2000 and late as saying 2000 and late.” Both Dean and Castiel stop to laugh at the joke. “So, we gamified it.”
“Why would a mechanic work out of a diner?” The man asked, not even looking at Dean but making another pass at the establishment.
When Castiel pulled open the door, his heart broke. He should be used to the sight and feelings that came along with seeing his best friend’s tear-streaked face, but it never became easier. It was never going to get easier.
Dean did not get a text back right away, which he hated but he was not going to complain about it. He was busy at work and needed to get things finished so that he was not stuck here late. Not like he really had anything to do this evening. Ben was spending the weekend at a friends and he had one beer sitting at home in the fridge, it was going to be so exciting when he got home.
“How long were you married?” Dean inquired, though he was not sure if he should have left the subject along or not. He had a feeling that it was still a hard subject for the man.
Dean turns his attention back to the box and works at peeling away all of the tape. Once he finally gets the top off, a laugh erupts from inside of him and it warms Castiel again. Inside the box was one hundred Little Debbie, Apple Pie, snack pies.
Dean waited longer that he needed to. This was very much over, he could tell that but he deserved some … Dean’s eyes shot up to the screen and he read over the name, over and over again. Blue eyed angel. Blue eyed angel. An angel with blue eyes. A damn angel with blue eyes.
Meg looks between both men again before turning and storming out of his house, even going as far as slamming the door behind her.
“Don’t want to go home to Meg?” Dean asked with a laugh. Castiel and Meg had been dating for six months but Castiel hated her. He had broken up with her six times but she still won’t leave and refuses to accept that he means it. Instead of involving the police like Dean had suggested, Castiel just comes over and spends all of his time with Dean instead.
“What party?” Dean raised an eyebrow up at his brother. Dean was not sure why Sam would want to invite him to a party, Dean was not really the partying type and he had a kid. Partying and having a kid were not good at the same time.
“In the morning,” Castiel agreed. “We are all set up and unpacked. It will be easier to get everything ready in the morning.”
Normally, he would never venture to the places in the back. Those were the ones filled with dark magic and possible danger. If he were to be hurt and not return to his palace, his Kingdom would be lost forever to the hands of Michael. He could not allow that to happen. But today, his curiosity got the best of him.
“Nice truck,” Bella doted on his truck when they arrived to it and Dean opened up the passenger door for her to slide in.
“But why for so long?” Dean felt the tears working to force themselves free from his eyes and he did not have the strength to hold them back anymore. “You could have stopped long ago. You didn’t have to make me …”
“I am so sorry Dean,” Castiel finally let the tears free and they slowly slipped from his eyes. Dean could feel his own forming but he fought to hold them in.
“Oh goodness,” Castiel finally speaks once he swallows what is in his mouth. “Are you still chewing? I just swall - *hiccup* - swallowed.”
Dean’s hand moved down from Castiel’s thigh and settles between then. A small moan escapes Castiel’s lips as it brushes against his penis, the only thing separating Dean’s and himself being a thin piece of fabric. He’d imagined touching Dean and having Dean touching him many times, but now that it was happening, his brain couldn’t function.
Castiel left Dean in the middle of the room and stepped into their walk-in closet on the other side of the room. After a minute, he came back out holding a medium-sized box in his hands.
Come on Angel. I can’t find you just knowing what town you are in. So, even if I am some psycho killer, knowing your town doesn’t give anything away. I don’t even know your name for fuck's sake.
“Yeah,” Castiel confirms. “He said that. So, in exchange for naming your child after me, and mailing these…”
“I am doing this,” Dean shot back. “Unless you don’t want me to. Do you want me to suck your cock or not?”
“No,” Castiel says sternly as he stands up from his chair and begins to pace the room, making sure to remain in front of the camera. “We can do this. Stand up.”
Dean had been ready when he texted Castiel, so he made it to the Roadhouse long before they had arranged to meet. Normally, he would have just gone inside, but he could not bring himself to get out of the car. If he went in, acting all nervous, just to have Cas show up, it would raise some questions he was not ready to answer. Sure, Ellen would probably realize something was up, she knew the boys like the back of her hand, but he was not going to force her into questioning mode. He knew for sure, anything that happened her tonight, his parents were going to find out about it. Ellen was great, but she could not keep secrets from his mother.
“I know you will,” Dean reached out and placed his hand on top of Castiel’s. Castiel flinched to the touch, not because Dean was touching him but because it did not feel like Dean. Dean put power into the things that he did. There was nothing powerful in Dean’s touch. It was weak and clammy and cold. It was not Dean; it was the shell of Dean. His Dean was no longer there.
Dean continued wiping his eyes to try and hide the fact that he had been crying. The last thing that he needed was for Castiel to see him cry. He did not want to seem like some obsessive friend or something who cries because their friend ditched them. It was not really Castiel that had made him cry but he could see how Castiel might take it that way.
"Dean," Cas tilted his head to the side in a way that made Dean's heart clench with want. "You were in a coma. I do not believe that is the same as passing out."
Things between Cas and Dean had been awkward since Dean's return home. They still talked and to the outside eye, things would seem normal between them. But Dean knew better and noticed more than someone else would. He noticed how Cas did not invade his space, never standing closer than he needed to unless he was helping Dean with something he was still unable to fully do on his own. Cas acted oblivious to the changes but Dean knew. He never should have told Cas about the dream he had when he was in the coma.
[greeneyedhunter] Some chick completely tore apart the inside of her car so she had a reason to bring it in.
Castiel did not know the depth of power that fairies held. Could this tiny broken creature kill him in his sleep? Castiel had purchased him at a market, almost treating him like an exchange of property, even though that was never his intention. In fact, he still wasn't sure why he had done it in the first place. Curiosity, maybe? Or was it something more. Whatever it was that drew him to the fairy felt a lot stronger than simple curiosity.
“Well,” Dean set his empty glass down on the coffee table and stood up. “It is getting late. I should probably be getting home.”
“So,” Castiel broke the silence, as he turned down a road that did not lead to their house. “What did you learn in school today?”
Castiel reaches across the desk and sets the screen in front of them to where they can see the timer.
“I said,” Cas kissed just above Dean’s cock and Dean leaned back against the wall, hitting his head a little harder than he had intended but it was not enough to make his want to stop. He would probably regret it tomorrow. “Beg.”
“My fraternity is having a party this evening,” Sam boasted, always so proud of himself for being a college boy. “And I would really like it if you came.”
The rest of the car ride continued on with their normal banter. While they took things seriously in their household, and currently had a serious matter on their hands, normally, things were light-hearted and fun. They tried to do their best with their daughter and when they originally agreed to adopt a child, they talked a lot about the traits they would like her to learn from them, what they felt was important. Dean felt that having a sense of humor and being able to let go and be silly was something people lacked and the world needed a little more of. Castiel agreed, adding in his desire to show her how to make learning fun and not just something boring you did in school. They spent a lot of family time going to museums, taking classes together, and watching documentaries, allowing her to discover what it truly was she loved. Both of those things were strong in their daughter now and even with this small hiccup, he knew that Claire was going to do great things with her life.
Castiel watched Meg at the foot of his bed, slowly stripping out of her clothes. They had been dating for almost a year and it was moments like this that made him wonder. Meg was beautiful, he body was pale in comparison to her dark hair and it gave her an otherworldly kind of beauty. And she was all his. But even now, watching her strip down in front of him, he could not seem to feel the things he knew he was supposed to feel. He was supposed to be excited, the prospect of sex is certain, but his mind was still able to wonder. Maybe he didn’t love her as much as he told himself that he did.
Dean didn't speak though. Had Cas just introduced him as his best friend? Not, ‘they this is my boyfriend,’ but his best friend. Maybe this trip wasn't such a good idea after all.
He’s already lost control of himself, his hand slipped under the covers and is stroking at his cock on top of the fabric of his boxers. A wet spot is starting to pool in the middle.
“I would like to think that we are dating,” Castiel confirmed with a nod. “I would love to be able to call you my boyfriend but if you need time, I will give you all the time you need.”
“She was missing the embarrassing trench coat and backward tie,” Dean joined in on the laughter but there was something else in his voice that Castiel couldn’t place.
“My life?” Castiel took a deep breath and Dean knew that it was a hard subject for him. Though Dean had just poured his life story out onto the table, he did not expect Castiel to do the same thing and he would not blame him or be angry if he did not share in return.
“Yeah,” Dean turned his attention back to Castiel, who blushed slightly, or at least Dean thought he saw him blush. He definitely looked the part of a Lawyer, well dressed, even at a college frat party. He was older than the rest, so Dean assumed maybe he was a Med Student, since he heard that takes forever. “So, what do you study?”
“Probably would have led to more trouble,” Castiel laughed again, only this time it was out of amusement. “Drinking with a bunch of high school students is probably not in a teacher’s best interest.”
“Cas,” Dean’s voice hitched into his throat when Cas wrapped his other hand around Dean’s cock and squeezed, this time not soft and gentle. Dean bucked his hips and Cas used his body to hold Dean against the wall.
“Water would be good,” Dean nodded his head, he did not need any more alcohol. “I think I've had enough to drink.”
If Dean could remember what it was like to smile, he would have. Rules were simple. You ate in the dining hall with everyone else. Food was not allowed in the rooms. It didn't happen often but Nurse Moseley broke those rules on occasion when she felt it necessary.
“I love you too, Dean,” Castiel sighs out, relieved that he doesn’t have to hold the words in any longer.
[angelofthursday] I don’t have set days. I tell myself I will write every day, but it doesn’t always work out that way.
The fairy looked through the food and went straight for the melon, paying little attention to the other foods that were presented. Castiel made a mental note to bring him fruits from now on. Maybe he would get to eat the last bit of cake after all.
Pulling his truck into his normal parking spot, Dean kicked the engine off and climbed out. Sam liked to laugh at him for getting a truck that is so high off the ground. Dean is not a short man by any means but his truck was so high that he had to climb out of it. Ben thinks his dad is trying to fill some manly code. Sam on the other hand tells him that he is trying to fill a void that is Lisa. Even though Lisa died three years ago, Dean was not completely over it. How do you get over the only person you ever truly loved?
“Pre-Med” Kevin chimed in, distaste in his voice, he obviously was not a huge fan of the lawyer profession. That or he did not like that Dean did not just automatically know that he was going to be a doctor of sorts. Hopefully not a doctor of people, he did not look like he would be good with confrontation and you needed some balls to be a doctor. That and he was tiny. Dean wanted a Doctor who looked like he could save his life, not a man who looks like he would scream if a spider crawled up beside him.
He listened, trying to figure out what was happening but the sounds were not giving anything away. Then something was slipping over his face and his eyes opened on instinct, but it was black still. He was blindfolded.
“Either you take your shirt off or I take it off for you,” Castiel nearly growled. This sent a chill down Dean’s spin and made his stomach knot up with something resembling anticipation. What was happening?
Dean waited a few moments, wondering if Cas was actually going to let himself in or if he was going to have to take it upon himself to enter. Luckily for him, Cas opened the door. He was halfway out of his clothes and looking more confused than normal.
“Did you take the female me home?” Castiel asked, a lump in his throat making the words come out rougher than he would have liked.
“Whatever,” Meg sighed, but she leaned in and gave him a quick kiss that in her own way showed him that she would forgive him for the interruption. “See you tomorrow. Sorry about your dog or whatever.”
Castiel began to move his finger once Dean settled down and stopped moving against him. One finger working its way in and out of him. He was ready for a second one but Dean knew better than to ask. Castiel would give it to him when he was ready. Slowly but surely, one finger became two and two became three, until Castiel had four fingers inside of him, pushing and pulling and turning. Dean was ready. He was so very ready.
No more than twenty minutes later, all three of them were standing in the lobby of the motel, discussing what they planned on doing for the evening. Sam and Dean usually went separate ways, not meeting up until later in the evening or even the next morning if they were to pick up some chicks along the way. But how the hell was he supposed to pick up a chick now? Cas was going to be attached to his hip the whole evening.
Dean was going out of his mind. They hadn’t worked a case in nearly two weeks and nothing was standing out as something worth taking a look at. They thought they had a case a few days ago, but before they even got packed, it was announced that they found the culprit; the very human culprit. He’d felt bad that he’d wished it had been a creature of some kind but was also glad that the murders were done with and people were no longer losing their lives. None of this was going to stop him from looking though. He was even to the point of searching state by state. Soon, he was going to do individual town searches in order to find something, anything.
“I made out with Bela,” Dean changed the subject back to him. He was not sure why he did it, there was no purpose in bringing it up now and he really did not want to talk about what had happened.
“Hey,” Bella greeted Dean as he approached her. He was still not sure if this was a good idea or not, but since he got stood up by his friend, what else was he to do? He could have gone home but he was not going to bail on his brother like that again. Plus, there was no beer at his house.
"I assume he is somewhere living with his mother." Cas answered. "I haven't been able to check in on them since … my … uh … fall. But I assume they are doing well wherever they are."
“You don’t have a soul,” Dean spoke again, at no one in particular. He was just stating a fact. Castiel did not have a soul. And he was his best friend. He was not Dean’s soul mate. Was he?
Castiel doesn’t listen and reaches out, taking Dean by the wrist. Dean quickly brushes him off and steps away from him. Castiel wants to be hurt but he knows better than to hold anything against Dean right now.
“I am okay.” Castiel smiled up Dean with a genuine smile. “We still talk and I am glad that she is finally able to be happy. She will always be that wild and crazy love story I got to have once upon a time. Like something out of a movie or book.”
“How’s Bobby?” Dean decided to change the subject from Castiel for a while. “I haven’t seen him since Ben’s birthday.”
Dean took a deep breath and sat down on the sofa, he balled one of his fists and placed it into his hand. He needed to not be there. He needed to leave but Castiel would not let him leave. This was a horrible mistake. He needed to leave. Why couldn’t he leave?
Once Cas found Dean's wrist with his hand, he gripped him tightly. Dean tried to pull away, a sick feeling forming in his stomach. Then it was quiet and the world started to spin. Flash after flash made its way through Dean's mind. He was carrying Sam out of their childhood home, a fire blazing in the background. Endless days and nights riding in the impala with their father. Monsters, Demons, Angel's and Cas. And then they were fighting and Sam was gone.
“Castiel,” Dean tilted his head to the side with a slight laugh. It was not a bad name; it was just not a name that you heard very often. That made it weird to say out loud sometimes, not that Dean was going around saying Castiel’s name out loud.
Dean hated all of this. He hated not seeing his best friend. He hated having feelings that he did not understand and couldn’t control. He hated all of this. The only thing he didn’t hate was Cas.
Dean hated her for that but at the same time, he envied her. From the moment Dean was old enough to talk and make decisions for himself, people have been telling him the same thing. ‘Dean Winchester. You are never getting out of this town.’ And he hadn’t. He went on vacations when he was a kid and thought the outside world seemed amazing, he wanted to explore it more. Then two years ago he took a vacation out to California to visit his brother. He could not get home soon enough.
"If Michael finds out about you," Castiel began frantically, placing the fairy on the edge of his bed before pacing back and forth the width of the room, "he will kill you."
“Thanks, man,” Dean tried to let him off the hook. Castiel did not need to fix the problem. “You don’t have to lie to me.”
[angelofthursday] And who says we can’t be friends that share their dirty thoughts with one another?
“I’m not a chump,” Dean yells, grabbing the chair in front of him and shaking it. “I’m not a chump. I’M NOT A FREAKING CHUMP!”
“I hate to have had to call you both in for this,” Principal Shurley began talking, pulling Dean from his thoughts. “Claire is usually such a good kid, so this was a shock for all of us, as I am sure it is for you as well.”
“Not going to tell me then?” Anna pulled Castiel from his thoughts, now standing only a few feet in front of him.
This was what heaven felt like. Castiel knew it. Even though it was not a pace he would normally get excited with, it was explosive and set his body on fire.
Once Dean found Cas' mouth again, Cas kissed him like he was hungry for it. He needed to touch Dean just as much as Dean needed to kiss him. There was fire and something more electric between them. If Cas didn't believe this was real, he was crazy.
Dean leaned in again, only slower this time. He took his time, tasting Cas' lips against his own. Passion instead of desperation. Want instead of need. Everything he wanted in life was pinned against the door beneath him, kissing him back.
“Busy as always,” Ellen smiled at the thought of Bobby. Dean was always surprised they could stand to be apart from each other; they were so in love. They were high school sweethearts and it’s been love ever since. Dean couldn’t remember a time when they had even fought, though he was sure that it happened. “When he isn’t here or at home working on the truck, he is off coaching little league or some other sport for them kids.”
Dean and Castiel played a round of pool until their beers and the basket of fries arrived. They then decided to take a break for a bit but they never made it back to pool. Dean was not generally such a big talker but it seemed to come easy with Castiel and Castiel had no problems opening up to Dean. Dean was not certain if Castiel was just an open man who could talk about things easily or if he was having the same effect with Dean. He did not strike Dean as the open type, but he couldn’t be for sure.
Dean was not sure how to transition into a serious conversation with Castiel, so he did the next best thing. He decided to show Castiel his car. He loved his car. When Ben was born, his father gave him his old 1967 Chevy Impala. Dean had loved the car when he was a kid but it stopped working when he was about ten and it was put in the garage. Dean begged constantly for the car and his dad finally gave it to him. He had been working on it over the years but it was not until recently that he was able to really afford to fix her up. She was almost ready.
“If we can’t make this work,” Cas motioned between the two of them, “promise me that we won’t ever stop being friends. You have been my best friend for nearly all my life. Losing that seems like it would be worse than …” Dean took a deep breath. He understood. Losing Cas completely would be worse than, “Death,” they spoke the word together.
“Hey,” Dean stood up from the couch, forgetting that he was only in his boxers, his erection very clear for Cas to see. “Oh, shit.”
Dean stepped out of his office and shook his head at Sam. Sam was younger than Dean by five years, but because Dean was noticeably shorter than his little brother, people always mistook Sam as being the older brother, sometimes they even mistook Adam as being the oldest, he got his big brothers good looks was the only reason.
“Yes, Dean,” Castiel cried out only moment’s later, his thrusts becoming erratic. He continued to fuck Dean for a few seconds before pushing all the way into him and stilling himself, reaching down and holding onto Dean’s hips with enough strength to potentially leave bruises. Dean wouldn’t know until morning.
"Don't bullshit me, Cas." Dean stopped his pacing in order to look at Cas, who would not make eye contact with him. "Look at me."
Dean continued kissing Cas' body, working up to his nipples. He lightly flicked his tongue over them and just as Cas would make the tiniest moan of pleasure, he would bite down, causing Cas to arch off the bed beneath him.
“Hey Bella,” Dean smiled at her. He was not really sure how to start a conversation with a girl. Lisa and he had basically been together their entire lives, he never had to work at it before.
Moving his hands to Castiel’s back, he pulled his body in and began to kiss down Cas’ neck. He tasted warm, if that could even be considered a taste. His skin radiating heat against Dean’s lips as Dean kissed from Castiel’s neck to his chest. Dean was slightly taken aback by the chest hair, not because it bothered him but because it was new, something he never imagined he would be pressing his lips against.
Then something touched him, causing him to jump slightly. It took him a moment to realize that it was fingers. Castiel was running is fingers against his skin. He touched every inch of Dean. Whenever his fingers moved on to another spot, he left a trail of what Dean could only describe as electricity. It felt like his body was vibrating.
He thrust his hips forward, fucking into Castiel’s hand. His entire body was tense and he felt like he was about to explode into a million pieces. And then he was.
So the fingers continued, slowly working their way in and out of him, driving him almost to the edge but it wasn’t enough. Dean was leaking all over the sheet beneath him and knew that if he looked down it would be nothing more than a puddle. It was too much, he needed to cum, he had to, his body was screaming for it.
“You smell like grease and you are tense,” Castiel answered. “Go get in the shower while I get these flowers into a vase. Okay?”
“You of all people should know that dead doesn’t mean forever,” Tessa stood over the edge of Dean’s bed, smiling down at him. “It was like a horrible vacation.”
“You didn’t” Dean blurted out, not really sure where it came from. He needed a way to break apart this alone time with Ruby. Part of him was also glad that it was Castiel who had broken the conversation between them up. Dean, aware of the fact that he was sending signals to Ruby turned his attention to Castiel. “I can understand needing to get some air around here. Not really your thing is it?”
Then Cas was losing his rhythm and Dean knew he was close. He reached up the best he could and pulled Cas’ mouth down onto his own by his hair. The kiss was hard, full of passion and need. Dean needed Cas to cum inside of him, fill him up and mark him as his own.
Dean worked his way out of the room and then had to work himself through the crowds of people. People were everywhere. There were people dancing, some in groups, some with another person and some just by themselves, their drunken state swaying back and forth to the music. Then you had a litter of people here and there that were making out. Dean almost envied them. It had been a very long time since he had kissed someone.
Dean didn't talk after that and quickly tuned out the rest of the room. So much was going on inside of his head that he couldn't keep up. He watched them check him over and his machines but he couldn't bring himself to answer. Finally, they gave up and allowed for him to take some time. They left him after that, all except Cas. Cas refused to leave his side.
“Yes,” Dean laughs. He leans in and presses a soft and short kiss to Cas’ mouth. “Sleep now before you turn into Mr. Hyde.”
That was it. That was all she was. She was someone to hold in his beds on the nights that Dean did not show up for him to hold. She was the person to spend his time with when Dean was busy or they were taking a couple of days, because friends didn’t spend every waking moment together, even though he wanted Dean to be with him constantly. She was just holding Dean’s place.
Castiel growled and Dean knew that he had succeeded. Castiel would not be able to resist Dean any longer, knowing that he had gotten from him just what he had set out to receive.
[angelofthursday] I know I don’t know you, but this is the longest conversation I have had in a long time.
Dean made his way further into the kitchen and unpacked the beers into the fridge. He then grabbed two, opened them and made his way toward the dining room. Castiel liked eating at his small dining room table. It was small and the table wasn’t even nice, but Cas liked having one. He had bounced around foster homes so much as a kid, he never really got to have proper dinners, so now he went out of his way to do so.
“What?” Dean pulled himself out of his thoughts and reached his head around further until he could see Benny. Benny was the one that ran the kitchen in the diner. Thank God too. If it was not for Benny’s cooking skills, the diner would have never made it. People even come from out of town just to eat Benny’s food. He could probably go anywhere in the world and open his own place, but he said he liked it here. The quiet life was the only life in Benny’s mind.
The fairy shook his head no but then patted the bed beside him. He then moved himself to lie down and closed his eyes, mimicking being asleep.
“You mean,” Dean swallowed hard. He reached for his beer but changed his mind. He did not need to consume anymore alcohol. That would make this situation worse than it needed to be. “It was you?”
“Thanks for subscribing,” Castiel says as the wheel takes its time. “Also, chick through to Good Angelical More, where we continue this battle and try to talk members of our crew into eating some more of these things.”
“And like I said before,” Dean continued on, “she didn’t have that damn embarrassing trench coat and backward tie. You know what that tie does to me?”
Dean watched as Cas made his way behind the bar. Knowing the owners also gave you bathroom privileges. You got to use the one upstairs in the apartment, not the one that was constantly being destroyed by random bar patrons.
Dean was reeling over what had taken place throughout the evening. He should have stayed home like he had planned all along. He had learned from the last party that he was not a party person, give him a bar any day. But deep down, he knew that all of his anger was something else entirely. He only wished that he knew what it was. He couldn’t be this worked up over something as trivial as a party.
“Okay,” Dean nodded his head but Castiel knew what he was thinking. He did not have to be an angel to get inside of Dean’s head, he knew Dean better than he knew himself. Dean knew he was going to die.
“A teacher at a frat party,” Dean laughed, tilting his head towards his brother. “I thought teachers were the uncool ones who failed you when you came in hung over or called the cops because the neighbor kids were being too loud.”
“Okay,” Dean nodded, pulling a beer up to his lips and finishing it off. “So, what about you and Meg. You getting back together?”
“I lost a bet, though I had intended to lose it the entire time,” he gave a little more detail behind his reasoning.
Dean waited for what felt like hours but was probably only a few minutes at most. He was almost about to turn around when the front porch light flickered on above him and the front door swung open. Dean covered his eyes briefly with his hand, the light a little more than he was ready for but soon it dimed and he could see Castiel standing in the doorway.
“And,” Castiel continues, ignoring Dean’s smug attitude, “if we both tap out before the story is finished, and don’t worry, I know you all wanna hear how these finish, Charlie will read the rest. So, you’re not gonna be left hanging, wondering ‘what did Cas do’?”
"My son," Dean almost yelled but learned that he was physically incapable of the task at this time. "Where is my son?"
Castiel decided to join in on Dean’s enthusiasm and ripped at the paper, tossing it aside. Beneath the paper was a throw blanket, in the best shade of green Castiel could have ever hoped for.
Dean hissed out, not in pain, though he hoped that is what his brother and Cas would see it as. No, the feel of Castiel touching him sent his mind into a tailspin and he suddenly wished that he was naked, the angel’s hands roaming over his body, studying every inch of Dean with his fingers and his mouth.
“I needed some teachers like you in high school,” Dean laughed, thinking about how fun it would have been to see some of his tightly wound teachers at a party. “Maybe I would have done a little better.”
Dean chuckled to himself. Best friends aren’t supposed to keep secrets, right? Maybe he was wrong. He didn’t know. He was sure there were times in his life when he had lied to Castiel but it was never intended to be for mean purposes. He knew that Cas did not intend to hurt him in his lie, but that did not mean it didn’t happen. But that was supposed to be behind them now and if he kept dwelling on it, then he was lying to Castiel when he said he had forgiven him and they could move on from it.
“Enough,” Castiel muttered to himself. He was trying to escape his life for a few hours, not dwell on all that it currently was. Today was about fun and some semblance of adventure.
“Dean,” Castiel appeared at Dean's side. He reached out and rubbed his hand along the length of Dean's right arm. “He isn't worth all this.”
“You are going to have to give me a few minutes,” Dean could barely lift his head away from the wall. “Then I will take care of you baby.”
“You are so beautiful,” Cas breathed, his fingers finally hitting between Dean’s legs and grazing lightly over his balls.
Dean smiled at Castiel. He could tell that Castiel found what he had said funny by the look in his eyes. Dean did not see the humor in Castiel’s words but he appreciated that the teacher had some sort of sense of humor, even if it was a dry and hard to understand one.
Dean was not surviving. He got up every day, went to work and then came home. He had stopped living the minute the machines flat-lined and he was left all alone, even though he was not alone. He had Ben and he was trying to do his best by his son, spending as much time as he could with him. Ben was now his excuse. Ben was the reason Dean stayed home or couldn’t go out over the weekend. Lisa would have been doing better. It should have been him.
Dean was suddenly turning, coming face to face with a very naked and a very wet Cas. He was even more incredible than Dean had ever imagined. His body was tan and muscular. He was a God. Correction, he was an angel.
“Good Angelical Morning,” Dean speaks into the camera with his overly upbeat persona he puts on for the world.
With that, Castiel pulled all of the way out of Dean and slammed back into him. His pace went from agonizingly slow to a speed and forcefulness that would have thrown Dean from the bed if he wasn’t holding on. And he was cumming. Dean’s entire body tightened up as he came hard without even having to reach down and stroke it out of his cock. All he needed was Castiel and knowing that he had given him exactly what he wanted. Dean had come undone. He was sure he was screaming but everything was a blur and his heart was pounding so hard he felt it was going to break through his rib cage.
When you guys were seven, Cas was living with that horrible lady who did not believe in holidays. You had mom return all your presents so you could buy Cas that leather journal and pen.
How the hell could this be Heaven? Dean's heaven was a place where the love of his life died and left him a grief stricken single father just trying to make it day to day? That didn't sound like heaven. It didn't seem like a fitting hell either. Maybe he was crazy.
Dean brought his arms up and wrapped them around Castiel, pulling him in closer. He wanted to savor the moment but Castiel had other ideas. With a snap of his fingers, Dean instantly felt their naked bodies pressed together. His cock was hard and pushed into the side of Castiel’s thigh and he was certain he was not going to last long enough to actually have sex with him.
Leaning forward, Dean laid his forehead against Cas', causing them to lock eyes. He then lifted his hips enough to slide a hand between them. He took them both into his hand, using the precum leaking between them to slowly stroke their cocks together.
Everything after that happened so fast. When the anger in Dean began to subside, he looked down to see Balthazar on the ground, rubbing at the side of his face. Dean knew he wanted to hit him but thought he would be able to control himself, but he was wrong. But he didn't feel bad. Balthazar got exactly what he deserved.
“So,” Cas turned and pulled Dean the rest of the way into the room. “What is it that you would like to do Winchester, as in Dean?”
Dean tried to fight against all of the information and feelings that were flooding his mind. He knew this was a stupid idea. He could not just sleep with his best friend. But Castiel did not give him time to back out or make any decisions at all. Before Dean had time to process what was going on, Castiel had Dean pinned against a wall and was kissing him hard and fierce.
“Four years,” Castiel smiled, at least the memories were not painful. “It was doomed from the beginning. She was one of those wild and carefree spirits. I loved that about her but I got tired of constantly being on the move. She couldn’t live in one place for more than a couple of months without going stir crazy.”
“I am glad to know that you have such high ambitions,” Dean quickly washed his body so that he could get to work on time. It did not matter if he was late because he owned the shop and he did not have any customers right in the morning but still, he hated being late for work. How your morning goes reflects how your entire day will go, in his opinion anyways.
Even though Cas could see that Dean was slightly put off by her name appearing, he does his job and continues.
“I would be more than happy to go to the market for you,” Anna interjected. “Save you the trouble. That would allow for you…”
“Nice,” Dean laughed to himself, reaching over to grab the beer that was being handed to him. If he was going to party, he may as well do it right.
That is as far as Dean gets before his alarm wakes him up. Every time, like clockwork, his alarm wakes him up from the exact same place in his dream. Every time he questions why this is but soon he brushes it off and rolls out of bed. Today is no different from those other days.
Dean looked around the room and smiled again. They had stayed in many motel rooms, all of them strange or gross in their own ways. But this room took the cake. It had two queen beds with comforters a shade of green Dean had never noticed before. The wallpaper was white with green dollar bills plastered all around, most of which were fading away from years of whatever the hell they had been through. There was also a small kitchen, a couch facing a tv and a beat up coffee table that was sitting on top of a bright orange shag looking carpet. It was perfect, something you would see in a cheesy 70s porno set in Vegas.
“It’s okay, Dean,” Castiel interrupted him. He didn’t want Dean to have to explain any of this to him. Castiel was a big boy. He knew that Dean did not want this from him but got lost in the moment. He was happy to have the moment they shared but knew it was a fluke in their way of life. “You don’t have to explain, I understand.”
Dean moved slowly onto the bed, working his way up between Cas' trembling legs. He trailed his fingers along the skin, feeling the bumps rise up against his touch. He rubbed against Cas' thighs, then trailed up to his hips and to his stomach. Cas was breathing heavy, almost panting as Dean did everything he could to avoid Cas' now very hard cock.
Dean reached back down between them and slowly stroked Castiel’s penis between his fingers, causing Castiel’s head to fall into the pillow, a moan rumbling in his chest. Slowly, almost too slowly, Dean stroked him, running his hand along Castiel’s length and then wrapping it around the tip to gather the pre-cum that had formed to use as lube before running his hand back down the length.
Castiel moved back down the bed and kissed the top of Dean’s foot, before moving to the other. Inch by inch, Castiel kissed his way up to Dean’s body, trying not to leave a single spot without attention. With each kiss, Castiel would whisper beautiful, or perfect. Dean would argue but the sincerity in Castiel’s voice was hard to fight.
Deciding that he was just going to lock himself away completely for the rest of the weekend, Dean made his way down to his living room to go through his movies. Maybe a movie marathon and a weekend spent on his couch would help him realize just what a loser he actually was. Man, had he really let himself go.
“Sorry I am late,” Dean turned around to see Castiel standing right beside him. If Dean had not recognized his voice right away, he would have been slightly shocked when he saw him.
“I’m not crazy,” Dean finally spoke. It made him jump. Dean had not spoken in years, not loud enough for another person to hear. He was surprised he even remembered how. He didn’t sound like himself anymore, and there was a rasp that he was sure came from the fact that his vocal cords never got the chance to work.
Then Dean was here. He deserved to be here. If they were smart, they would never let him out. But they kept trying. They told him that if he could talk about that night, he could get better. He could one day go home. But he didn't even remember that night, not exactly and home. Home. Did he even have one of those anymore?
Inside the house was loud and students stretched from wall to wall, assuming they were students. It appeared to be the place to be on a Friday night. It was possible that a few people were dragged here the way he was, if only Charlie were around, he would have dragged her with him. She loved to have fun and was always on Dean about getting out of the house. She was going to be jealous that he went to his first college party without her. He wished she was here.
"What?" Dean looked between the both of them. The woman looked familiar but he was sure he had never seen her before in his life. Though she could have been one of the nurses around when Lisa had gotten sick. "Who is taking care of Ben? My garage?"
Within minutes, Cas had used his crazy hand on the head trick and killed all the vampires in the room. Dean wanted to be mad. What was the point of him even coming if Cas could take care of it himself? But he wasn’t angry. Instead, he was so incredibly turned on that he had to turn away from the angel to adjust himself in his jeans. Cas was a badass. He was all muscle and angel strength. If he wanted to kill Dean, he could do it with a simple touch of his hand. If he wanted to pick Dean up and toss him around, it would take nothing out of him.
But there were never any monsters in the closet. When the monster in their lives finally came, it was Dean. Monster in the next bed. Poor Sam had been afraid of the wrong thing for so long he never expected it when the real evil showed its face.
“Dean, what are you …” Cas began to ask but Dean cut him off with a harsh kiss, pushing him against the door of the bathroom. He had no idea what he was doing but he was going to keep doing it.
But now that he was standing in front of the mirror, he could see it. He was no longer as fit and good looking as he used to be. His face, which he had always kept clean-shaven was now always sporting some kind of five o’clock shadow and his eyes were a little tired than normal. Then there was his body. What used to be muscular was now hidden behind a layer of flab. His brother had always told him that all of those burgers and the ungodly amount of beer he drinks was going to catch up with him, but he never took him all that seriously. Now, he was really wishing that maybe he had hit the gym more or ordered a salad or two here and there.
But it was more than just forgiveness at this point. Cas had been his best friend since forever and now their relationship was changing. Could Dean be gay and they can try and make this work? What if Dean decides that he can’t be gay? Would they be able to go back to being the friends they once were? Right now, talking online, it was safe. Dean needed safe. But he knew this bubble was soon going to pop.
He was walking in the middle of nowhere, nothing but grassland and trees. It was quiet, not even a bug to buzz in his ears. The sun was hanging hot overhead and there was not a cloud to be seen.
He'd had enough of this. Cas had always seemed interested in him. Everyone saw it and people said things about it on occasion. They even knew that Dean had feelings back for the now fallen angel. He had always just been too chicken shit to do anything about it or admit how he feels. But he was done running from his feelings. Life was too short.
Dean pulled himself up to a standing position and leaned into Castiel, pressing his lips firmly against the slightly shaking teacher. Castiel moaned against Dean’s lips as Dean continued to stroke at his penis, which was now held between their bare stomachs. Dean knew that Castiel was getting close and that caused him to kiss him harder, pushing his tongue wildly into the mouth of Castiel.
[angelofthursday] When I was sixteen, I started dating this girl in high school. She was this crazy gothic chick who thought my nerdy glasses were cute.
Another long pause. Dean could feel the tears building behind his eyes but he could not let himself cry. He did not cry.
Dean slipped out of his clothes and into his bed, the sheets were cold against his skin. He could not believe that he had spent that long talking with someone, let alone someone that he barely knew. Except now he could not say that. He knew Castiel pretty well at this point. There were still things that Dean could learn about him but he knew the big stuff, the stuff that generally took the longest to learn about a person. That was something.
: You are not scary at all. I just … I knew if you knew where I lived, you would want to meet and I was not ready for that.
If he hadn’t been drinking he would have come over and crawled his way into Castiel’s bed? Why would he do that? Sure, they had been best friends for over twenty years and they had slept in the same bed more times than Castiel could count but at no point had Dean ever crawled into his bed for fun.
“You know,” Castiel whispered, leaning in so that Dean would know that he didn’t want Claire to listen in. “If I didn’t know better, I would say it was your DNA that created that girl in the backseat and not mine.”
“No one is there to make them,” Castiel said in a deep voice, his eyes sadly wondering over Dean’s limp body.
“Ellen,” Dean yelled across the bar, grabbing Ellen’s attention away from the book she was now reading. It was a weekday, so the bar was pretty dead. “Two more drinks.”
“Is this going to be painful?” All the things he was thinking and that was the question he finally asked.
“I thought I was supposed to make you scream my name?” Dean questioned, even as he lifted Cas off of him so that he could undress.
Pulling the keys from the ignition, Dean pushed them into the pocket of his blue jean jacket and made his way up the front walk. He had no idea what he was going to say to Castiel really. He never said one hundred percent that he would be there. He just said he was thinking about going. It was Dean who had assumed that he was for sure going to be there. So, none of this was really on Castiel at all.
Bella told Dean all about school. She is a law student like Sam but wants to do more to help the environment. Dean could respect that she was not in it for the money but if he were going to pay over a hundred grand to get a degree in school, it would be for a job that was going to pay him enough money to pay that back and then some. Sure, helping people and the world was nice, but money was nice too.
If Dean was a teenager, he would definitely have gone off at this point. But he had enough strength to will himself to remain calm. It was not going to last long but it was strong enough to last him for a few minutes at least. He was not ready for this to be over, for Castiel to stop touching him.
Castiel was hurt that Dean thought for even a moment that he would not arrive. Everything that Castiel did was for Dean. He had given up everything that he had ever known for Dean. Who would do that and then disappear when someone needed them the most? Though the track record of people in Dean’s life made him push away the hurt and try to be understanding. Now was not the time to feel angry toward Dean.
Dean made his way across the apartment, Cas right behind him. Dean knew that running away was not the best thing for him but he needed to get some air; He needed to clear his head and he could not do that with Cas staring him down.
Every year, for the past four years, they have done their own special Christmas Eve. Christmas day was reserved for going to their families' houses and doing family things. So, they promised each other the night before to do their own private gift exchange. Castiel says they started it just to have sex under the Christmas tree, but they do that anyway. Even so, Castiel is now curious as to the change that Dean would like to make.
They hadn’t seen Cas in nearly two months. And while that sucked, Dean was grateful for it. The last time he’d seen Cas, he ended up getting turned on and had to excuse himself from the room. That, followed by the jerking off session he’d had in his room where he all but screamed out Cas’ name as he came all over his hand, was enough to make him need a break. He couldn’t seem to keep his mind or his dick under control when Cas was around. It was better that he kept his distance, at least until Dean could figure out how to hide his attraction for the man better. No, he was fine. They were not calling Cas.
“I know we have a lot to work on,” Dean confirmed. “Trust is a hard thing but I know that I can trust you, but forgetting is hard also. I am working through what happened but I am no longer mad at you. I love you too damn much to be mad at you. But, I can’t promise you forever.”
“You wouldn’t want me to escape would you?” Castiel asked as he moved his fingers up Dean’s legs and around to the back of his thighs.
“Well, yes, we are,” Castiel looked between her and Dean. “But that is it. We aren’t together or having sex. We are just sleeping.”
[555-4033 | You] And when I bite my lip, look you in the eyes and beg you “Please baby.” You are gonna still tell me no?
Dean turned on his coffee pot as soon as he got home. He knew his work load and had decided to not go to sleep. He was not really that tired and knew that he could make it through at least half of the day. So, he was going to work half day and then cut out early. Dean never missed work or went home early, so he figured that this one time would not hurt. Other guys at the shop seemed to call out all the time. It was Dean’s turn.
But Dean didn’t say anything. Castiel had messed up, this was proof of it. Dean didn’t know how to tell him that he was not interested.
They sat in silence for a few minutes before their beers arrived. Neither of them knew what to say and as much as Dean hated the awkward feeling, he was not sure how to get passed it. So, he decided to go with small talk.
“This morning stuff is horrible,” Ben grumbled as he entered the bathroom. “They should have summer school at night or at least not have it start until noon.”
Dean swallowed and nodded his head, his cock twitching at the tone of authority coming from his husband. Whenever Castiel was serious, his voice grew deeper and even in situations where they were truly having a fight, Dean couldn’t help but get hard hearing that sound could out of the man.
Dean and Cas both remained quiet as they got themselves ready for bed. This was not how Dean had pictured their camping trip going. Sure, Balthazar had deserved to get punched and everyone seemed to be on his side about it, but Dean felt bad. These people were Castiel’s friends and Dean had possibly ruined those friendships.
“What is?” Dean found himself asking a few minutes later. Had it been a few minutes? He had no idea how much time had actually passed since he was laid onto the bed.
“And you have a month to do it.” She told him. “A month should be plenty of time. But Dean dear, I really must be going.”
Dean offered to drive his car. He didn't want to leave her behind in the parking lot. Cas rode with him, along with Kevin, who seemed most comfortable with Cas. They talked about school most of the ride there, while Dean remained quiet. Cas attempted to talk to him a few times but when Dean brushed him off with short, one word answers, he finally stopped trying.
Dean looked across the diner at the man standing by the front entrance. He looked completely out of place in the diner. He was wearing a suit, though it was majorly covered by the shadiest looking trench coat Dean had ever seen. His shoes were shiny enough to catch Dean’s eye from across the room and he was almost certain that the watch around his wrist cost more than Dean could even imagine making in a month. The only thing out of place about this man was his hair. It looked like he had been running his hands through it all day.
Cas started off slow, working Dean’s penis into his mouth. Soon he was pulling back, just to push his mouth around the entire length of it once again. Dean was in heaven, leaned against his dream car, getting the best blow job of his entire life.
Castiel kissed Dean’s neck once more before kissing his way back down Dean’s body. But this time, he didn’t skip the good part. He kissed and licked at the skin around Dean’s lower stomach before making his way down and kissing along the length of Dean’s cock.
“I’m so,” Dean gives his own commentary as he picks up and examines his pepper. “I hate everything right now. I hate everything that can be hated.”
When he reached the front door to the coffee shop, Castiel stopped to take a deep breath and try to gather his thoughts. He could do this. But he couldn’t do this. He had to do this. Then he spotted Dean, sitting at a table, leaned back against a chair, two cups sitting in front of him and he was looking right at Cas. He didn’t seem angry or shocked or anything, maybe he hadn’t caught on yet. He just assumes Castiel was coming for coffee. This was one of Castiel’s favorite places to get coffee.
Dean tossed his phone down onto the passenger seat in baby and took a deep breath. Normally, Castiel stood in Dean’s corner. They had been best friends since they were three. That is twenty years of friendship. But recently, Castiel has been nothing but negative when it came to Dean’s choices to invest his time in a girl he met online. Castiel was just jealous that Dean was in love and he had no one. Wait?
"It isn't real." Cas tried to pull away but Dean wouldn't let him. "You don't want me Dean. Dream you wants me. I can't, I just."
“It’s not.” Dean shook his head. It was still kind of crazy, but until he got to the bottom of it all, he was willing to host all possible ideas. “But Angels and Demons? That does sound crazy.”
Dean shakes his head but quickly picks up the next card, putting on a straight face before beginning to read his part.
“You need a ride man?” Dean asked him, quickly standing up. “I could really use a good reason to get out of this party.”
Dean gripped the counter and then turned to see Ben standing in the doorway of their kitchen. He was talking to Dean but Dean could not make out his words. Ben wasn't his son. Ben was Lisa's son. Dean had chosen hunting and left them behind. He couldn't keep them safe in his world.
Dean let go of Castiel’s still half hard cock and pulled him as close to him as he could. They kissed, their sweaty bodies pressed together. Dean was afraid to let him go, afraid that it would be over after this and he never wanted to leave this moment, he just wanted to be here, in Castiel’s arms.
“That sucks,” Dean shook his head at Castiel. His own family was not religious but they were close. They were too close sometimes.  “I could not imagine not seeing my family every day.”
Castiel watches as Dean looks over the gifts, looking around to realize that there are no more gifts under the tree. His heart sinks. Did Dean forget about the last gift? Had he not been able to find something that both of them could do together? Castiel plastered on a smile, even though disappointment had hit him hard.
Dean was running out of rituals and spells. He was getting closer to the end of his month and he feared his death. He had died before but that didn’t mean that every time he died he was going to come back. What if this was the one that stuck? What if in a week’s time he was going to be dead and Sam was going to be all alone?
Dean pushed his hips forward as Castiel began to undo his pants and drop them to his ankles. He was curious as to what was going to happen. Was Castiel going to return the favor of what he had done or was he going to go the route that Dean was too afraid of? Either way Dean was ready, he just hoped that he could last for more than a few moments, as his body was already on the brink of ecstasy.
Dean swallowed but brought himself to his feet and made his way up the stairs, Castiel right behind him. He stopped when he got to the top, not quite sure what his plan was. Once Castiel reached the top of the stairs, he pointed toward Dean’s bedroom. Dean hesitated for a moment but walked into his room and waited for Castiel to join him.
“Maybe.” Cas nodded as he crawled himself onto Dean’s lap, wrapping his arms around his neck. “Would be funny to have Meg make him walk home.”
Castiel stood up and hovered over his friend, shaking him to get his attention back but there was no response. The only thing Cas got was a loud beeping in his ear that hurt all the way into the pit of his stomach. Soon he was surrounded by nurses and doctors. They pushed him out of the way until he was no longer in the room.
Dean took out his wallet and slipped the card in. He then took out a black card of his own with white lettering. He handed it to Castiel who took it and smiled.
“I apologize.” He responded, taking a slight step back from Dean but not enough to make a difference.
“Hey,” Meg greeted them as they sat down in their chairs around the fire. “Where did y'all run off to?”
“And how do I accomplish that huh?” Castiel’s laugh was one of annoyance. He didn’t know what was going on with Dean but it was way too early in the morning for weird shit. “You gonna come over and crawl into my bed, huh?” There was a pause of silence before he spoke again. “I didn’t think so.”
Rubbing his cock through his boxers, Dean moaned right along with Castiel. He was aching to press his body once more against the now almost naked teacher. Learning seemed to be a little more appealing to Dean in the moment and it almost amplified the feelings he was having. Who didn't want to mess around with the hot teacher from time to time?
It was salty and a little over powering. Definitely not something that would go down in the books of things Dean enjoyed having in his mouth. But it was not as bad as he had imagined. It was possible that at some point, he would be able to get Cas come in his mouth. But now was not that time.
“Hey,” Ben looked up from his phone for a brief second to look at Castiel and then he was back to not fully paying attention. Dean would be sure to take the game away come dinner time. Ben did not get to hide behind video games this evening. If Dean was going to work on being social, Ben was going to join in with him.
“No, I just,” Dean felt like shit admitting this but he had to be honest. “I was so angry that you didn’t show up and now I feel like a complete ass about the whole thing.”
Before he could really think about what he was doing, Dean was standing up and making his way over to Balthazar. His hands were clenched into fists at his side but he was working now to control himself. Even if all Dean wanted to do was hit the smug Brit in the face.
Dean was a work-a-holic and Ben was more interested in playing with his friends or playing his video games than want to spend time with his boring dad. When Dean found out that Lisa was pregnant, even though they were only fifteen, he thought that the only good thing was that he was going to be close in age to his son. They would be able to relate to one another. He was wrong. No one on this earth made Dean feel as old as Ben did.
The thought jumped into his mind without warning. Maybe it was a therapist he needed and not a massage.
As they walked away, Dean mentally kicked himself. He could have gotten laid tonight, possibly by two women considering the chances of Cas sleeping with one of them was incredibly low. He’d tried getting the angel laid before and that didn’t work out for anyone. It definitely did not work out for the poor girl that Cas left in tears. But still, Cas would say no, right?
Dean tried to work through all that he could. He wanted to blame Lisa for all that was going on in his life. How could she have left him all alone, a broken mess of a man? Why couldn’t it have been him? She would have known how to move on. She would have been able to help Ben keep his grades up. She would have survived, not messed things up the way that he had.
Dean wanted to fight against it but Castiel was so strong and honestly, he didn’t want it to stop. He had dreamed about this moment. Touching Castiel was something that always hung in his mind and now he was doing it.
Everyone greeted Dean, accept for Ruby who sat across from him. She didn’t talk to him or really make eye contact. He figured she was angry for not taking the hint and doing something with her last time. That was her problem though, not his. He wasn’t here for the pleasure of Ruby.
“There is nothing to be sorry for,” Castiel informed her, causing her to snap her head up in surprise and Dean’s as well. “You felt like your family was being attacked and you acted in the only way you felt you could. Your dad and I both understand this.”
“I feel like my right nipple is gonna spout fire,” Castiel says as he rubs his chest. “My left nipple is fine. Right nipple … fire.”
“I …” Cas started but stopped, setting down his beer and slumping against his seat. “I don’t know how to explain it.”
Then the scent hit him hard. It was apple pie. It was a candle, not the real thing but that didn’t make any difference. It smelt good enough to make his mouth water and his lips twitch with hunger. He could really go for some apple pie right now.
“I find that hard to believe.” Was this guy for real? “But unfortunately, as the matter stands, I am in need of assistance.”
“Dean,” Castiel stood up to see Dean out. “I really am sorry that I did not make it. I really wanted to be there.”
“Dean I don’t understand,” Castiel shook Dean’s hand hard, pulling his attention back to him. “What are you talking about?”
“Dean?” He screamed through the door. He felt dizzy and sick to his stomach. He knew the feeling of throwing up and hoped it would not happen, but he did not trust anything anymore. “I’ll just wait here then.”
His mind continued to race. Thoughts of the shop and Castiel. How Castiel had been there through everything with him and he was going to be there long enough for Dean to get his shit together. He knew he was. Castiel knew he loved him. Cas was everything.
No. It was no accident. Shit like that just didn’t happen, not during those moments, not unless. “Fuck,” Dean breathed again, not sure whether or not he wanted to scream or cry. How could he have been so dumb?
Dean had been stressing out like crazy lately. He had recently bought out his Uncle Bobby and was the official owner of Singer Salvage and Winchester Auto. He had been running the place for years, ever since Bobby retired, but this was the first time he was doing it all on his own. If things were to go south from this point forward, it would be all on him and no one else would be held responsible. That was a lot of pressure but also what he had been working toward for years. He was equally terrified and proud as hell of himself for his accomplishments. On the downside, he had been spending less time at home and when he was home, he was stressing out about work. This was starting to put a strain on his relationship with his husband. Castiel had never flat out said anything but he didn’t need to. Dean knew that he was being neglectful all on his own.
