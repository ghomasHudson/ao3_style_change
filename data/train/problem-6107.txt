that. Tony jerked back with a quickness that even amazed him, his hands coming to rest atop his thighs, while he sputtered “Wh-what? No I mean, why does that…” Tony trailed off clearly unsure of what he should even be asking.
So to the lab Steve went. He had just walked through the glass doors, when he heard a soft beeping sound. It was soft but sounded panicked in a way, just enough so that Steve only hesitated for a moment before heading towards the sound in the large workshop.
“Oh no” Steve breathed before he turned and ran towards the attached bathroom. He grabbed a few towels before running back to the bots, shooing Dum-e out of the way he quickly started cleaning the base of the bot, knowing that's where the motors would be and thus the more important part of the bot. “Hey Jarvis? Jarvis what do I do??” Steve asked the AI trying to keep the panic out of his voice although he wasn’t sure if he was succeeding.
“Y-you too Jarvis.” Steve replied before moving as quickly as he could out of the building, too nervous and jumpy now.
Tony was speechless, he’d never heard Jarvis allow emotional tones in his voice with anyone but himself. The fact that Jarvis was clearly closer to Steve than even he had realized spoke volumes. He watched the scene in front of him unfold as Steve tried to defend himself from the bots while simultaneously attempting to soothe them all. Tony pressed a hand to his chest, unsure of the feeling unfurling there as he watched them quietly for a moment.
“Goodnight everyone” Steve murmured softly, walking away to soft beeps and trills from all three bots and a soft, “Goodnight” From Jarvis.
Steve’s eyebrows raised when Tony’s reaction to that was to shrink in on himself nervously, hands holding something close and that only drew Steve’s attention to the fact that Tony was obviously holding something.
Upon hearing the word ‘learned’ the bot zoomed off and started collecting things, obviously toys it was using during its learning process, but things nonetheless and tried to bring them to Steve. Steve spent the next hour laughing as Butterfingers would try to show him something she had learned while dropping said things over and over. He eventually tried to show her how to hold certain objects and how to pick things up a certain way, smiling the whole time as she raced small circles around him, being more mindful of the tables in this area --although thankfully in this area of the lab was more open floor since this was the bots charging section.
“I’m gonna call her Minibot, I hope you know that Tony” Steve huffed on a breath of laughter, happier than anything.
“Of course sir, have a lovely rest of your day. I hope to see you soon” The AI responded before smoothly opening the elevator doors again.
“Ah I think so, thanks for asking. Whose this? I haven’t seen them before and something tells me I would have.” Steve chuckled, dusting off his pants and shirt before heading in the direction the bot went.
Steve shifted so he was facing Tony better and peered down at the small thing in Tony’s hands, and his eyes widened when the object started moving, a small claw sniping at the air as it trilled and beeped in excitement.
Steve gave Tony a watery smile while he lifted one limp hand to cradle the back of Tony’s head gently. Slowly, giving Tony plenty of time to protest, he pulled the other man forward until their lips pressed together gently. Warmth hummed through his body as if electrified. “Thank you Tony,” Steve murmured against those soft lips, twining his arm around the man’s waist to pull him closer, “for everything.”
“She is named so because she kept dropping anything he’d hand her. She’s very excitable and gets distracted easily.”
Steve complied silently as he curiously watched Tony, staring silently with blurry blue eyes into Tony’s own soft brown ones while Tony gently spread the shaving cream across the spots Steve had missed or entirely screwed up. Tony slowly lifted the razor and after reaching up to rinse it off settled again to gently draw it along Steve’s jaw. Tony’s movements were swift and efficient while not once nicking Steve’s soft skin.
The further he moved into the shop the louder the panicked beeping came and suddenly he realized he could hear Jarvis’ soothing tones speaking lowly to something. Steve’s confusion swirled with a small amount of anxiety, before he rounded a small wall only to come face to face with what looked like a large robot.. It had a large base with a support strut that made it almost as tall as Steve with a decent size claw mechanism on the end. The bot appeared to be tangled in some cables and couldn’t move without breaking some of them or knocking something down.
“Drying U off is a good start, U is fine, however, he just needs to be powered down while the motors dry. However with Dum-e’s panic I’m having a hard time convincing U that it's okay to power down.” Jarvis answered after a moment's pause, and Steve had a half-second moment of amusement over the frustration he was capable of hearing in those British tones.
“Uhm” Steve murmured, unsure how to interpret the series of beeps the bot was making in general while it kept moving its arm as if trying to communicate something.
Captain, if you’d please move to the east wall there is a bank of elevators there that you may find of use.
“I love you’ Steve felt he needed to reiterate, slinging an arm around Tony and bringing him close so he could hug them both.
“And U looks just like Dum-e but he's newer in design so just look for that when trying to tell them apart. U is more sleek too I guess, but just as big! And less of a menace, more quiet than the other two.” Tony continued, exiting the elevator and heading towards the glass doors that led into the shop.
“Butterfingers is the newest addition and she's an absolute terror but she's adorable and the worst she’s capable of doing right now is tripping you when she zips by. I wanted her to be more portable since Dum-e and U aren’t very portable at all, but I definitely made a mistake in making her small enough to fit under tables! She's tripped me on many occasions trying to zip across the lab!” Tony exclaimed, making wide hand gestures and suddenly very aware that Steve had a hand on the middle of his back and was steering him around debris on the shop floor.
“Slow guys slow, you don’t want to scare our guest now do we?!” Tony tried to say but was startled when the bots instantly zipped over to Steve, circling him and reaching out to grab at him with their claws. Tony couldn’t even respond because he’d never seen this reaction from his bots before, not to someone new.
You realize, with fire licking up your spine: he doesn't know. You appear unharmed to him. He doesn't understand what's about to happen, doesn't know there's nowhere to go from here. This is the last stop.
Your stomach swoops upside down, around and over itself. It's not all bad. It reminds you of flying. You heft yourself tighter against the body next to you, clawing in a way that is not related to need in any way except a need for safety and comfort.
There's nothing but the distant shadow of discomfort as he shoves into you. Your body has looped through the cassette labeled 'pain' so many times the sounds have become fuzzy, distorted. Weak. Perhaps, finally, some of the sensations have deadened after all.
If the desperation bleeds into your voice, he doesn’t say, but his face turns alight. Any emotion is an emotion, you know, and he'd rather hear your desperation than pay witness to any more apathy.
You returned to consciousness as you were split apart, with a plea for mercy on your lips that was promptly drowned out by an agonized moan. Of pleasure. Agony and pleasure should be polar opposites, and yet—

None of them should've ever come here. Here is hell, and you can't bear the thought of trapping anyone but yourself in it.
You wonder if They will consider a mercy killing, once you're too broken even for a lab rat. The possibility that pushing you toward that breaking point may very well be Their goal is real and terrifying.

It takes too long. You don't have any measure of time, but you count how often you are with The Others and begin to doubt the circumstances will ever align so perfectly as to grant you escape.
In the end you always find relief, against the cold ground of The Room, sliding through your own blood. There are only two options after all, and you will inevitably wind up exercising the 'else' portion of the command.

Bruce starts talking a blue streak about time dilation and you distantly find yourself agreeing, but your focus is on Steve, who gets a faraway look in his eye that only Natasha picks up on. She nudges him gently and tilts her head in question.
Fascinating. Biology, that is. Nature. Life is a miracle. The Others and you share nothing—not anatomy, language, culture or even galaxy—but this remains the same. Socket and plug. A carnal need. An instinct meant for survival, reproduction, passing on genes. Primitive, yet prevalent in a variety of intelligent organisms.
For the fraction of an instant, as he shuffles into the space between your legs and the curve of his full dick brushes against your skin, you entertain the possibility that it could be good, with him. Better. Less bad. Less horrific. Maybe he will look at your face and remember that you were on his side, once. That you fought together and not against each other.
“And there’s also the fact that Steve Rogers isn’t even part of the Avengers these days.” Sam helpfully points out. “Where’s SHIELD based right now?”
Speaking of tomorrow though, there’s going to be so much to talk about. So many confessions to make.
On the phone, Sam sighs audibly. “Look. I’m not going to make excuses for him because what he said was seriously out of line. I’m just saying that he needs some time.”
On the other end of the line, Stephen sighs. “It would only activate if the subject of the spell was being controlled at the time. Mind control spells are intensely complicated because the caster doesn’t want to be caught. Frankly, if you’re caught? You’re an amateur. And very few casters have the power to control someone 24/7. The best spells are the ones where the subject isn’t even aware that they’re being mind controlled.”
About an hour ago, the Avengers had gotten wind of a live situation in New York: a group of kids were wreaking havoc in their school by changing their classmates and teachers into animals. “I hate magic,” Tony had sighed as they watched an opalescent ray hit a willowy blond and turn him into a goose.
Lucky for him, Steve breaks all on his own. He places both coffee mugs onto the counter and sags, shoulders drooping with dejection as he asks, “How could you tell?”
Kamala bites her bottom lip, not sure if she should admit that Tony’s right. But she takes so long that Tony winds up understanding on his own.
“Whoa,” she breathes out in wonder, feeling the tiniest bit of emotional whiplash when Steve schools his expression to disinterest when Cap looks back at him. Turning to look at her friends, Kamala asks, “Did you guys see that?”
“My naked husband,” Tony answers easily, rolling over to lie fetchingly on his side as Steve approaches.
Tony buries his face in his hands, groaning. Is there a hole he can crawl into and die out of sheer embarrassment? Because of
“It’s honestly just a simple thank you coffee like, I found it in the cabinet with your note on it and I thought that I’d do something nice for you because you’re doing lots of nice things for us and it felt right to return the favor even if it’s just coffee. And it’s totally not me trying to butter you up. It really isn’t. Do you want cookies by the way? They're still in the oven because I wanted them to stay warm. Not that cooled cookies are bad but oven-fresh is the best way to go, right?”
But he’s surprised by Tony’s answer; Tony shakes his head. “Not yet. I wanna hold you like this.” He tightens his arms around Steve for a second before relaxing.
For the quickest of moments, Tony mourns the fact that Amara’s broken up with him. Everything turns dark and dull as he recalls her gentle words. “I’m sorry but I don’t see this working out in the long-term,” she’d told him, fingers clasped on top of the table, sending clear signals that she wouldn’t appreciate it if Tony tried to take her hand again. “I have my own work and you’ve got your own. What we had was amazing and I wouldn’t change it for the world. However...”
When they’d landed, Cap had quickly divided the team into two groups. The adults were going to take care of the magic-users and the teens were going to herd the animals as best as possible. They’d done their part, quickly herding the animals together in several clusters and stopping the teens responsible. But the magic ring that the perpetrators had used was lost somewhere in the building. Apparently the kids had ditched it before making their escape attempt.
allow him to do. What if he wants to drink? What if he wants to make something that might hurt people? What’ll he do then?
Honestly, he’s surprised that Steve hasn’t offered Tony the cookies he’d hidden in the pink tin next to the coffee.
Hill nods approvingly when he gets his hard-light shield along with some guns. “I’ll send a team with you. They’ll be on standby around the Tower until you give them their orders. Just in case.”
But not all the way. Tony feels increasingly uncomfortable with the way so many people are assuming Steve’s his romantic date. He can tell that Steve’s not happy about it by the way he grows increasingly stiff next to him. Which only serves to ratchet up Tony’s own unhappiness because there’s no bigger gut punch than an unhappy Steve.
It feels a bit like moving through molasses when Tony slides his hands under Steve’s shoulders to push the heavy coat off. One layer down, too many more to go. Steve’s hands come to land on his waist and reel him back in.
In answer, Cap had pulled his phone out and called SHIELD. Several black vans had pulled up outside the gates within minutes and black-clad agents quickly secured the perimeter. And just like that, they were on the side lines. And by they, Kamala meant Sam, Miles and herself. Vision, Cap, and Tony were helping SHIELD, and Thor had flown off to answer another call.
Tony can’t help but snort. “We’ve been in a bad place for years now Sam. If there was any salvaging this friendship, it would have happened by now.”
This time, you stare at the gleaming white dome encasing you for half an eternity. You might have thought yourself dead, were it not for the hot prickle in every part of your body that betrays skin stitching itself back together and fractured bones mending with sorcerous ease.
The second you’re freed, you suck in a lungful of air. In, out, in. It rattles in your chest, burns as it whizzes down your sore throat. You can feel the imprints of his fingers along your neck.
Once you stepped through The Portal, it collapsed and left you stranded in a spotless, bright-white and empty space. Naïvely, you began to search for signs of life in tall, desolate corridors. You wish you had been alone. You wish you had encountered nothing and died here, by yourself.
The rest of the team is there, conversing quietly over the beep of machines by your bedside. They haven’t noticed your state of consciousness yet. Your gaze is drawn to Steve next: he’s dressed in a shirt and sweatpants; bandages peak out of the collar and sleeves of his top and his foot is wrapped in a cast.
He looks different. Still broken (your bones ache with real and sympathetic pain when you look him over) but he's had time to heal. He's stronger. His jaw clenches and his fingers flex.
You have yet to encounter an object to bleed yourself with. But the absence of time has taught you patience, and so you wait.
A select few keep battering your broken body until you can feel your mind splinter apart in its stead—because there is nothing left to break but something needs to give, and it'll always be you.
After that, you don't mind at all. You're somewhere else, and it's alright. It's okay. You feel nothing. You are nothing. It's fine. It doesn't hurt to be at the bottom of the food chain. Someone has to be. It's alright. It's okay.
Your heartbeat bounces between your temples, stings in your fingers, throbs in your groin. The edges of The Portal pulse and shiver as though it's alive, awaiting your arrival. To embrace you with open arms and welcome you home.
The odds are—you don't know. You don't really care. They're not good. You don't have enough data for a more in-depth evaluation.
Sometimes, when you're allowed to think without the need clouding your mind, you question how long it’s been.
Now, all you have is this abomination of something you distantly remember longing for. It's yet another violation of your personhood, and you almost dare think it's a greater hurt than all the times The Others have ground your body to nothing combined.
After it's done and the urgency has abated, you cough up blood and a tooth. They take him away again.
It destroyed everything in its wake, and the smoke rose to your lungs: it was going to choke you, this need, the unbearable urge. You knew—with the same certainty you'd known Mark II would fly, the Chitauri would be followed by something worse, The Portal would power up—that the only way to hinder the fire from burning you alive was to heed its demands.
He doesn’t put up much of a fight, and it’s not because he can’t or doesn’t desperately want to. You see it in the hardened, black-blue of his irises—this cast-iron will, this dogged determination that has his name written all over it. His knuckles are bright-white where he clenches his fists on the floor, the tendons in his neck protruding, every muscle pulled taut.
Tony licks his lips and Steve can’t stop himself from tracking the motion, a new heat sizzling in the pit of his stomach. When he looks back up into Tony’s eyes, there’s mischief burning there. “I... uh,” Tony clears his throat and tries again, “I might need a reminder or two. Just to be sure.”
Once they’re behind closed doors however, Tony gives in. There’s no need to think anymore. Nowhere else to go except to the bed. And once they’re there, with Tony sitting on Steve’s lap, dragging his wet against Steve’s dick, there’s no reason not to give into his desires. Except for that little voice in the back of his head that pops up when he feels Steve’s hand twitch with hesitation. Steve’s been so good so far, making sure that Tony’s on board and Tony hasn’t asked, even once, if
“Hard to say really. I imagine it’ll take at least a week in this realm. That should translate to a few weeks on Earth. Two months on the outside.”
“Shoot,” Tony says distractedly, mindlessly flipping through the TV channels. He doesn’t often hang out in the rec room but he’s got some time to kill while FRIDAY tests some new code. Sure he could sleep but if he falls asleep now, he’s going to pass out for half the day. It’s just more efficient to stay awake for another three hours and then get back to work. Now if only he could find something to watch...
“Tony’s notifications have your entry logged but I don’t think he’s seen it. He’s in the middle of upgrading his armor.”
Miles frowns up at the ceiling. He drums his fingers slowly against his bicep as he thinks. Sam meanwhile, is staring at his drink.
Steve tilts his head in acquisition. “What do you want to do now?” He asks, deftly changing the subject.
Kamala can’t stop herself from taking a quick peek at Tony. His jaw is tight with tension. He looks pissed. She quickly looks back down, stomach twisting uncomfortably for some reason.
Momentarily taken aback by her insistence, it takes Tony a beat to collect himself and answer her question. “If I could, I would but that’s not what he wants. Besides, I’m not totally sure if that’s something
That swooping sensation? The ground just crumbled underneath Steve’s feet. Free-fall into the darkness. He hits every uncomfortable realization on the way down, the bruises on his soul blooming red-purple as he realizes that maybe... what if... why hadn’t he...
The nurses’ lips are a tight line but merriment shines in his eyes as he eyes Steve and Tony. “Everything alright in here?” He asks.
. In fact, and this throws Steve for a loop, he can’t remember the last time Tony looked at him with such a look of pure delight. (It was before Wanda, that much Steve is certain.) There’s no negative emotions hiding in the depths of Tony’s eyes. There’s no guilt, no caution, no trepidation. Just unbridled delight.
“Hey guys, come on now it hasn’t been that long.” Steve laughed, petting Dum-e’s strut before reaching over and patting U softly. The bots beeped in response, Butterfingers releasing a trilling sound that definitely sounded like a protest.
Steve released Tony with reluctance, hands releasing the man and falling to land next to his sides limp.
As Tony spoke, Steve’s expression twisted with agony and Tony was quite sure his heart wouldn’t survive it. Tony knew he should go get someone else, anyone else, to deal with this obvious mess of feelings before him. Feelings weren’t a thing Tony understood at all, he knew that better than anyone, yet in this moment he couldn’t bring himself to leave.
“It’s Dum-e, it is in fact a play on the word Dummy but pronounced slightly differently. Dum-e is capable of communicating with me correct, and if he ever needs help I will definitely send a message your way. He says thanks for that as well and wants to know if you want a smoothie, although I’ll kindly warn you that you should just politely decline. He hasn’t figured out the difference between safe and non-safe liquids yet.”
Tony smiled at him softly, eyes so soulful Steve felt as if they bore into the depths of him, “I had a feeling you would.”
Tony stumbled until he stood next to the curled up man and fell to his knees in a manner that showed he was mostly unaware he was doing so. Tony lifted an unsteady hand slowly moving it up between them to brush his fingers across Steve’s cheeks. The storm continued to rage all around them, the force of the thunder causing a tremor through the building that seemed to amplify Steve’s own shivers. In response a shiver traveled Tony’s spine as he ran his fingers across Steve’s scruffy cheeks.
After barely a minute or so Steve glanced over at Tony and silently held out a hand, “Tony please tell them I had no choice.” Steve pleaded, a soft smile on his lips and Tony felt something slot into place inside him. He didn’t know what this meant, not really, and he didn’t know where this was going, but he knew in this moment this was a piece he had been missing. With a soft chuckle he walked forward and reached out to allow his fingers to slide into Steve’s warm palm.
Steve woke slowly, curled in the warmth of thick blankets and pressed close to a warm body that told him his partner had managed to sleep through the night. Steve wasn’t sure what had stirred him awake, especially when he knew naturally it was still too early for either of them to be awake. Then he heard it, the hushed whispers followed by very soft beeps. Steve's brow furrowed in confusion, was one of the bots in their bedroom? That didn’t make sense, Jarvis wouldn’t let them leave the shop that would be chaos.
“Captain Rogers, if I may,” A British voice spoke from seemingly, nowhere yet everywhere at the same time, Steve’s head snapped up as he tried to place where the voice was coming from. “I’d like to introduce myself. I am the AI system that monitors this tower, my name is JARVIS, and if you ever need anything you may just ask.”
For a moment all Steve could do was focus on how beautiful Tony was and he had to force himself to focus, “A gift?” Steve murmured curiously, gifts were rare. Gifts kept for early mornings in bed anyways.
“The last time Dum-e got wet, which was a completely different situation, he was powered down for six months and that loss of time messes with his system and thus causes him to fear the idea. It wouldn’t be the same situation here but U is still young and doesn’t understand.” Jarvis responded after a moment, and if the AI could sigh, Steve really thought it would.
When Steve met Butterfingers he’d been more amused than anything. At this point he’d been living in the tower for six months and had been coming to the shop pretty consistently, he’d thought he’d met all the bots already but clearly Tony had another tucked away.
The second creation of Tony’s that Steve met was Dum-e. Steve had gone to the workshop looking for Tony, and despite Jarvis’ reassurances that Sir was not in fact hiding in the workshop, Steve couldn’t help but go looking anyways. Steve was restless and even though he had moved into the tower a week previously he couldn’t help the nervous energy created by his new surroundings. This led to him randomly searching out Tony, his host in his mind, and someone he should be cordial with due to those implications. Tony constantly laughed and brushed him off but Steve knew he was probably going to be nervous about this for awhile.
Steve carefully unplugged the cord regardless of the reassurance before he slowly coiled the wire into a small circle as he moved around the bot all the while untangling it from the other cords. Once he was done with that it was a simple matter of unlooping the other cords from the bots large wheels and then getting the robot to release the one it held in its claw. He held a hand up in a universal ‘stay’ motion the second he had all the wires unwrapped to hopefully prevent the bot from rolling off and Steve made quick work of cleaning up all the cords from the floor and subsequently the bots path.
After a few hours Butterfingers finally started to calm down and Steve recognized it the way one might notice a puppy tiring from playing. Patting her support strut softly he motioned to the charging station “How about you go to bed? I”ll come back soon and you can show me what else you learned.” Steve murmured, and to his amusement the small bot trilled happily before zooming to her charging station. Dum-e and U followed at a more sedate pace, having stayed and watched as if watching over the newer bot protectively. He patted them all goodnight before he left, amused and happy.
“H-hey there” Steve coughed, eyes squinting as he took in the bot and realized it wasn’t Dum-e or U, much too small. “Who might you be?” Steve asked directly, knowing Jarvis would fill him in eventually.
On this particular visit though he walked into the workshop to immediately be nearly bowled over by Dum-e, whom was clearly in a panic. “Heeyy, hey what's wrong? Hey its okay what's wrong?” Steve said, trying to calm the bot, eyebrows drawing in in confusion. Dum-e trilled at him loudly before shooting off towards the back of the shop at speeds Steve knew the bot was not allowed to move at. “Dum-e!” Steve shouted before cursing under his breath and taking off after the bot.
Steve almost couldn’t help the words that came out of his mouth, “Oh you poor thing, are you stuck? Lemme see...” He murmured as he quickly moved towards the bot. The beeping paused for a moment and it took Steve a moment to realize Jarvis had also stopped speaking, but he paid them no mind as he walked around the bot carefully a couple times before he reached forward and touched one of the cords. “Jarvis?” Steve asked softly.
Steve shook his head, knowing now wasn’t the time to be amused over such a thing. “Why wont U power down? What is...U afraid of?” Steve asked as he moved to the other side and started drying off that side, patting the side of the strut soothingly.
“I know I promised, but we had--Come on U don’t be like that.” Steve started, before breaking off mid-sentence to coo at the bot who was clearly trying to express a ‘pout’. Tony could only watch in befuddlement at the scene, at the fact that Steve was correctly naming them all and was talking to them as if they weren’t lifeless robots.
In a movement faster than Tony could track Steve suddenly threw the hand he had covered his eyes with out to the side, slamming the side of his fist into the cabinet. The wood splintered in protest, shavings falling to the floor. “He insisted and now I can’t do something as simple as shave and, just,
Steve hm’d softly to himself before checking over his work, shifting until he was sitting on his heels he looked the bot over before glancing over at DUM-E who had subsided to hovering anxiously to the side. Steve took a deep breath then faced the new bot again.
“Are you okay Captain?” Jarvis spoke up then, tone clearly curious as Steve clambered to his feet slowly.
Dum-e beeped and Steve could tell the bot was still worried but was willing to trust him, and that made something in Steve’s chest warm. With a small shake of his head he went off to find something he could sit on comfortably while they waited, excited to get to meet this new bot properly.
“Hey U, I hate that this is our first introduction but I’m Steve. It’s nice to meet you but I need to ask you a favor. It seems you got covered in some water and that's really bad for your motors you see? So I need you to power down so they can dry safely okay?” Steve spoke softly, aiming for a soothing tone and hoping the bot would be able to interpret that. DUM-E trilled and Steve reached out towards the bot, holding his hand out until he felt the claw press into his fingers. “Dum-e its okay I promise alright? U just needs to power down and in a few hours they’ll be good as new okay? It won't be like what happened to you, okay? I promise.” Steve cooed softly to the other bot before focusing on U again. He listened to the very weak beeps from the newer bot before the bot stilled and the one light he could see changed from green to red.
Tony couldn’t move despite every cell in him burning with the need to help the man before him, but his brain was smarter, his brain knew he was useless here and needed to turn around now to find help.
Steve slid around a corner of the shop only to come upon the bot beeping in quick succession at a newer bot, one Steve hadn’t seen before. This one looked very similar to Dum-e but slimmer and more new. It was moving, but almost in an exaggeratedly slow movement and it was in that moment Steve noticed the bot was covered in some sort of liquid.
“She’s just like butterfingers?” Steve asked as he settled next to Tony again, letting their legs tangled together as he looked the bot over.
Steve reached up and scratched the back of his head, nerves tingling like small bolts of electricity through his muscles making him twitchy. He tried to tamper it down yet he couldn’t stop the shifting of his feet while his gaze continued to swivel across the smooth expanse of the elevator walls. “Artificial…. That means you’re not an actual person right?” He asked nervously, hoping it wasn’t a rude thing to ask.
Outside a storm raged violently around the tower. The rain slamming against the building with the force of a waterfall, lightning struck every few seconds causing a cacophony of booms one after another. If Tony hadn’t known better he would assume Thor was the cause of it yet as far as he knew the God was still in Asgard. A bright flash of lightning lit up the dark room behind him allowing him an even better view of the man before him.
Tony, who had brought his hands up into the air in a defensive/surrender type position with Steve’s sudden movements, now reached forward to grip Steve’s face once more forcing the sobbing man to look up at him. “Hey, hey now, shh” Tony whispered as he tried to figure out what he was supposed to do to soothe such intense grief.
“Awh man, she also does that.” Tony exclaimed, motioning towards the items on the floor, “She is aptly named Butterfingers because she's constantly dropping stuff, okay anyways, Hello babies! Daddy's home and I brought a guest! Come say hello!” Tony called out, stopping not too far into the lab. Many trills and beeps answered him and he could hear the bots moving towards them.
The bot made a series of beeps and sounds that definitely sounded like gibberish, even to him, before it backed up and spun in fast circles. Steve sat up and twisted around so he could watch the bot with raised eyebrows before the bot shot off across the lab in such a haphazard manner that Steve couldn’t help the reactionary cringe. “Hey wait don’t--” Steve started before sighing.
Tony internally questioned if it would look bad to ask JARVIS to call Pepper… She would know exactly what to do. Tony opened his mouth to ask JARVIS to call Pepper when Steve moved in a flurry of movements again too fast for Tony to react too. One second he was kneeling beside the crying man trying to figure out the best method to comfort him while non-discreetly calling Pepper, and the next he finds himself in an awkward tangle of limbs in Steve’s lap with his face pressed into Steve’s shoulder and his hands trapped against the man’s chest.
“This is Butterfingers. Sir finished creating her AI system a week ago, but hadn’t named her until yesterday.”
The first time Tony willingly brought Steve to his workshop, it was actually work related. He needed input on the combat suit he was trying to design for Steve. While he had Steve in the shop though, he wanted to introduce the man to his bots. They were important, and hard to contain to certain parts of the lab--especially when visitors were around. He knew that Steve had met Jarvis before, it was hard to live in the tower and not meet the AI, but as far as he was aware Steve had never been to the shop and thus had never been introduced to his bots. So, trying to be a conscientious….friend, he was happily filling Steve in on his three bots as they made their way down.
“Well look at you, learning things already.” Steve murmured, amused by the small bot and already feeling enamored with its cute behavior.
“ ’s really stupid,” Steve murmured softly, “I shouldn’t be so upset but I can’t-” he broke off with a soft choking sob. Steve hitched in an unsteady breath before continuing “I don’t know how to shave”.
Upon hearing his name whispered Steve’s head snapped up so quick the movement was a slight blur to Tony, yet nothing was clearer than the devastation marring Steve’s normally sunny features. Steve’s face almost made a human representation of what Tony imagined nightmares would look like as an expressed feeling. Steve’s face was ghastly pale; his normally bright blue eyes now a dark bottomless blue. Tears tracked their way down cut cheeks in two steady streams to drip steadily off a just as cut up chin.
He can help Steve into his jacket and accept the cheek kiss he gets in return with stunned disbelief. He can let himself be dragged out of the restaurant by a flushed Steve who asks how they’re getting to the Lincoln Center. He doesn’t have to hide the fact that he stumbles over his own feet when Steve links their hands together as he pulls Tony into a cab. He can stare in goofy wonder at Steve when he keeps holding his hand during the length of their journey to the show. He doesn’t have to pretend that he’s not affected when Steve laughs and kisses the back of his hand on their way into the Lincoln Center.
, Tony’s brain purrs happily. His arms slip under Steve’s jacket, hands roaming as his lips seek out warm skin. He wants to taste Steve. Wants Steve to taste him in return.
“I guess you can always send them an email explaining that you’re sorry and you’d like to talk? There’s no guarantee they’ll see it but at least you’ll be extending an olive branch. If that doesn’t work out, there’s always writing her an actual letter and putting it in her locker. Can’t imagine it’ll be easy to ignore something like that.”
“We picked up this cell phone from a cell leader in Central Europe. The lab people haven’t been able to crack the code. It’s too complicated for them. Mind taking a look?”
... then why did he... why didn’t he stop Strange? Why did he do all the things he did? Why stand against Steve? Why hurt him on purpose? You don’t do that to the people you love.
It’s like nothing he’s felt before. Tony’s had a fair amount of sex, some of it mind-blowing. He understands the intimacy the contact can bring. And yet, never has it felt so intense. Tony’s dizzy and breathless, struggling to meet his desire to catalogue and remember every detail of this moment. Like lightning flashing through a dark sky, there are bursts of clarity.
Steve isn’t experiencing the usual pre-mission jitters. He’s experiencing a whole new kind of anxiety because Tony’s here and there’s still so much unsaid between them. And there's also the fact that he can't believe Tony's
The softest part of him wants to tell Tony that he does more than that. Tony’s always had his back. One of Tony’s best qualities, in Steve’s humble opinion, is his heart. The lengths to which Tony goes to help his friends is awe-inspiring. Sure it’s led him astray more than a few times but Tony’s intentions are rooted in wanting to protect the people closest to him. And the extent to which he has gone to protect
Cool fingers press against his cheek. Tony exhales a dreamy sigh as Steve worriedly says, “Your fever’s getting worse. I think I should take you home. Your heat’s coming in faster than expected.”
On the screen, Horatio Caine is examining the scene of the crime. It’s the start of the show so that means, any second now, he’s going to make a God awful pun that on any other day would make Tony groan before he tries to steal the remote away from Steve because
Sighing deeply, Tony resigns himself to going stag. He’s about to pull his phone out and ask Bambi to make the call when a hand appears in his line of sight. Tony stares at the waving hand before he follows it back to its owner, Steve, who is giving him a deeply concerned look.
“We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to,” he tells Steve, voice quiet. It’s dark inside the apartment and Tony doesn’t want to turn on the lights for some reason. Somehow, staying in the shadows like this makes this feel more real.
Steve’s eyes light up like Tony just saved Christmas instead of solving a problem he’s had to solve at least once a month since he made DUM-E. It makes the back of his neck heat up uncomfortably, especially when Steve nudges the coffee towards him. As Tony picks the mug up, Steve heads to the oven and pulls out a plate piled high with delicious smelling cookies. Drool immediately begins to pool under Tony's tongue.
Miles sighs and crouches down next to Sam, watching him play. “You can make a chocolate ball over there,” he points out.
He sees his hurt mirrored in Tony’s eyes. “I know. But I wanted to protect you anyways. There’s a lot of things I can handle. But you being hurt? I... I can’t. I’d sooner cut my own hands off.”
Steve’s addendum is a minor pity but Tony forgets about it as soon as his fingers dip under his pants and briefs. His dick is swollen full and when his fingertips bump against the small erection, it feels like being struck by electricity except it’s better because there’s pleasure instead of pain. Tony’s uses two fingers to tease the base of his dick, rubbing it, teasing the tip, softly jerking it off, until he comes.
“It’s not something he seems interested in. After everything that happened... everything I did to him... I can’t blame him.”
“There’s only three people who know the best way to soften me up is by offering me food. Who told you?” Tony asks, unable to stop himself from giving Steve’s back a little sympathetic rub because poor Steve looks
The awe in Steve’s voice makes Tony want to preen with delight. He wants to beg for more praise. Like a sunflower turning to face the sun, Tony rolls his hips up into Steve’s hand and groans throatily, pleading for more.
A lot goes into being an Avenger. There’s the obvious qualities: the ability to fight, thinking fast on your feet, being ready to take on the unexpected--stuff like that. But there are other things, other emotional qualities that a lot of people don’t consider. If you ask Steve, the two most important and often overlooked qualities the strongest Avengers have. The best of them don’t give up and they’re always willing to forgive.
Steve’s chest rises and falls; an exhale passes through Steve’s lips before his eyes meet Tony’s. “When’s your heat due, Tony?”
They only break eye contact when Sam grabs Steve by the arm, saying, “When you said you guys have talked it out, I didn’t expect
Tony sniffs hard but it doesn’t stop the tears from falling down his cheeks. A wounded noise clogs up his throat when Steve makes a gentle sound of his own before wiping the tears away. Tony leans into the touch when Steve cups his cheek.
Cap steps between the pair, palms raised. He says something before he faces Tony. Whatever Cap tells him, it has Tony walking away. But she doesn’t watch where Tony’s going. No, Kamala’s interest is locked onto Steve and the ugly expression that melts away for a few seconds when no one’s looking. She stares, wondering if she’d imagined the hurt and yearning directed at Tony’s back.
He touches a love bite on Tony’s neck, remembering the taste of Tony’s sweat. He brushes the hair off Tony’s forehead, remembering the way Tony had moaned when Steve had tugged on his hair. Steve runs his fingers up Tony’s thigh, which is thrown over Steve’s hip, and remembers how the muscles there had quivered under Steve’s palm as Tony had come.
Steve stares and stares and stares. At first, he see-saws between annoyance and resignation. But the more he thinks about it, the more his pendulum sways towards annoyance, increasing the height of its arc until it lands on pissed-off.
That’s not the point though. The point is how Tony is looking right now. Tony looks relaxed. Languid even. The way Tony’s walking up to him...  It’s hard to describe actually. First of all, there’s a deliberateness that puts Steve on edge. No, not on edge. It makes Steve feel self-conscious and a little hot under the collar. Steve keeps thinking back to old, cobweb-ridden memories of seeing Tony in a dimly-lit club, surveying the crowd for someone to dance with, to take home. There’s a rusted-over memory of an aching wish that Steve quickly shoves back to the recesses of his memory;
He understands where Sam is coming from, where that concern was birthed. But Steve’s not doing this. Not today, not tomorrow, not
“Listen. Sam,” he tries again, calmer this time around. “I appreciate the effort but I don’t think it’s worth it. Steve’s made it pretty clear that he doesn’t want anything to do with me.”
“I think she’s still out,” another voice says. It’s also masculine but softer. Who is that... Kamala knows that voice...
And now that he pays attention to it, doesn’t Tony’s signature look a little bit off? Steve turns to his computer and quickly pulls up a sample of Tony’s handwriting. He compares the two examples and realizes that yeah, this is a decent copy but clearly a forgery.
Maybe if he catches Tony off guard, it’ll be enough for him to come through the mind control. Assuming he’s being controlled in the first place.
She doesn’t realize how tight she’s holding herself until Miles drops a hand on her shoulder and quietly asks, “You okay?”
There’s the heat of Steve’s mouth pressing against his skin, his heart beating like crazy, the sweaty hot press of their bodies. Tony’s overwhelmed. He doesn’t realize he’s throwing one arm up to shield his eyes until he feels Steve nuzzling his way under, whispering, “Let me see you.”
Tony’s eyes flutter shut. His next exhale is a warm puff of air against Steve’s mouth and chin. Steve holds his breath, waiting. He shivers when Tony’s trembling hands rise up to rest against his sides. “What are you doing Steve?”
The teasing glint fades from Tony’s eyes, replaced with a curiosity that has Steve swallowing and turning his attention down to the forks he should be cleaning up. There’s also the empty bowls and place mats, and someone should wipe the table down too. And Steve’s pretty sure they’ll have to sweep the floor clean too because at one point Clint’d thrown some peas at Tony and Steve’s dead certain a couple of those green balls must have rolled off into a corner of the room.
Pleased, Steve follows suit. He presses his hand in the center of Tony’s back. He counts the space between his breathing. Steve closes his eyes and mirrors Tony; breathe in, breathe out. Over and over again until peace settles over Steve like his favorite fleece blanket.
And he knows Steve’s caught on that something’s going on because his blond brows drip into a furrow, concern written all over his face. But he never gets a chance to say anything because Kim Andrews comes out of nowhere, exclaiming, “Tony! What a surprise! You’re not fashionable late as usual!”
Steve gestures at Tony with one hand. “I’m not sure if there’s any other alpha’s in the crowd but I can smell it. Plus, you’re burning up. And you keep...” Soft pink blooms across Steve’s cheekbones. “You keep sticking close to me. It’s like you’re looking for someone to be with. And every time I pull away, your scent goes all unhappy and sour.”
Kamala tilts her head in clear confusion, clearly asking for an explanation. Tony continues, “I’d try to be in the same space as them. I’d try to hang out with them and see how they’re treating me.”
Tony’s brain feels like it’s made of sticky caramel or molasses. Everything is thick, sweet, and cloying. He breathes in deep, greedily relishing the calming scent pouring off Steve. Tony wants to soak in the woodsy scent, let it penetrate deep in him until his scent morphs and-
Steve stares at his own reflection in the mirror, catches sight of a few fading marks on his body, and grins. There are no words for his happiness and how deep it goes. Steve floats his way to the kitchen, making a bee-line to Tony, who is cracking eggs into a bowl.
“I promise,” Steve promises, voice low and rough. “Just... please. Just be patient a little while longer. You’re doing so good. I promise I’ll make it worth your while.”
If only she could find the energy to open her eyes. Or lift her hands. Ugh. Her limbs feel all noodle-y and weak. In fact, trying to screw up the strength to raise her hand makes her nausea make a comeback.
Sam raises a tentative hand up and says, “Seconding. I don’t think we should butt into their friendship. It feels like it’ll probably blow up in our faces.”
Pleasure washes over his feet like the gentle kiss of a foam-tipped wave and urges him to step forward into deeper waters. Tony happily gives into the urge, letting his wet fingers slide a little further down to feel between his folds and dip into his front hole.
Tony narrows his eyes, pressing the sheath of papers in his hands against his chest as he asks, “Someone broke something, didn’t they?”
Steve moves half-a-step closer, hand coming to rest lightly in the middle of Tony’s back. Tony melts immediately, smiling faintly before he nods. He expects the answer to reassure Steve but the concern in his eyes doesn’t dissipate. Rather, for the next hour or more, Steve keeps shooting him worried little looks as Tony makes nice with his ‘peers.’
With an ever-so-slight tilt to his head, Vision considers the question. “No more than ten minutes. Please stay here. I shall come get you when it’s time to leave.”
She turns around to face Tony, who stands in the dining room doorway with a cup of coffee in hand. It looks like he’s just come out of a shower; his hair is damp and he’s wearing his lounging clothes. “You got a second?”
The urge to crawl into a hole and cry herself to sleep for a few years comes back up. Kamala winces and says, “Sorry. I’ve had a lot to think about. I promise I’ll be better tomorrow. I’m working on it.”
He smiles faintly as he turns to watch Steve walk out of the bathroom as well, vigorously toweling his hair dry. Like Tony, he’s naked and he looks like a vision.
an alpha. And he’s admitted a couple of days ago that he doesn’t have anything planned for the whole of next week. No dates, no charity engagements, no nothing. Somehow, Steve and Sharon had broken up just before Amara had broken up with him. So, what would usually be date night for Steve is now,
Tony follows his glance, sorrow turning into alarm when he realizes that eggs have indeed burnt. He hurriedly pulls the pan off the stove but there’s obviously no salvaging the food. With an angry little jerk, Tony slams the pan down on the counter. The force of his shove sends some of the eggs flying out. With an irritated exhale, Tony plants his hands on the marble and stays there, a study in frustration.
It warms him, how Steve’s smile grows into something deeper, more lustful. He thinks of the way cats arch their backs into someone’s touch when Steve runs his hand through Tony's damp hair. Tony’s eyes flutter shut when those broad fingers squeeze the back of his neck. His lips part with a sigh when the gentlest of touches press against the nape of his neck. “Are you thinking of anything specific when looking at your naked husband?” Steve whispers.
“But...” Kamala looks up at Tony now. The pained, gentle look in Tony’s blue eyes almost brings her tears back. “You guys were the dream team! The best of the Avengers! The
Before Tony can say anything, Steve tosses the device at the man. Tony opens his hands, ready to catch. Steve’s heart races as the phone lands in Tony’s hands.
Kamala crouches down beside Sam, attention split between watching the boys play and keeping an eye out for Tony. Sam manages to pass two levels in one attempt before Tony’s red and gold armor steps out of the building. Kamala can’t help but perk up at the sight of him.
“Fraternization hasn’t ever been a problem before.” Rhodey points out. “There’s nothing in the by-laws that says team members can’t date.”
She bounces out the room immediately. Tony has to yell at her back, “Let me know how it goes, okay? And if it gets too bad-”
smaller than it’s been in years. Steve can’t imagine them having a lot of needs outside of the absolute necessities: Tony’s lab, a training room, dining room, rec room, and locker and showers.
“I’m not sure I deserve you,” Tony whispers, fingers digging into the meat of Steve’s shoulders. “But... I’m so grateful that you choose me.”
The nurses’ lips wobble but he doesn’t let the smile break out. “Just here to check Miss Marvel’s vitals. Don’t mind me.”
they’ve been through, how could Tony be such a fucking coward? Wasn’t he the one who said that he’d do it all again if given a choice? That he doesn’t regret his actions? So, why then, does he act so regretful?
Instead, he captures Steve’s lips in another kiss. Pleasant tingles race up and down Tony’s back at the contact. When he pulls away, Tony teases, “Takes one to know one.”
that Tony’d laid on him before they'd left… what was it supposed to mean? Did it even mean anything? Was it meant to be comforting? Or had Tony meant it to be more? These are questions Steve needs answers too but he’s too scared to ask them. Because what if it
Steve breathes in deep because this is it. The opportunity of a lifetime. The scariest leap of faith he’s ever going to make. “I do love you,” he confesses. It’s a little shaky but it’s out there now. Manifested.
With a deeply sour expression, Sam tells him, “Of course we do but this isn’t a regular love spell. There are no protocols for a situation where someone’s romantic inhibitions go “poof!” and if they aren’t near the person they like, they might die!”
Sam’s contemplatively staring at Tony. It’s a little unnerving. “Is it someone we know?” The man asks.
Kamala’s never really thought about this before but both men have nice voices. Super soothing. She wonders if either of them have considered voicing audio books. She’s dead sure that they’d make a fortune. But hmm... that might also happen just because of who they are instead of how they sound like...
Tony’s talking to one of the SHIELD agents, who is fiddling with the device in their hands. And then Tony looks up and freezes. He’s got his helmet on so Kamala can’t be sure but he seems surprised by something. She follows his line of sight. There’s a blond SHIELD agent chasing after a rabbit, a bald agent passing by with a couple of bags in his hand, and Cap and Steve Rogers talking. Kamala’s not entirely sure which of the three sights has caused Tony to freeze.
Heat rushes up his neck and into his cheeks. That was an unexpected declaration of intent. He knows it's
“Do you still want these?” Steve asks as he shyly places the cookies near Tony's elbow. “I made them myself so I’m not totally sure about how they taste but JARVIS helped with the coffee.”
“It’s a little surprising that we we were going through our gay crisis at the same time,” Tony muses. “What’s the odds of that?”
Thankfully, Kamala’s spared from hearing Tony’s response because an angel of mercy, a blond nurse wearing green scrubs, parts the curtains and cheerfully says, “‘Scuse me, coming in.”
. And he immediately feels guilty because Tony’s been good (for now). Tony’s the best of them. It’s not fair for him to assume the worst of him.
“This spell strips away every inhibition placed around a person’s heart. There’s no reason not to share their feelings. I know what’s right and what’s wrong. I haven’t lost that. My feelings? They’re the thing that's front and center. No barriers, no excuses. Just the truth.”
” Tony snaps. “Do you know how hard it is to pick a date that works for both of us? Not to mention find a place that’s got an open table literally a few days before Christmas?”
“Like...” How would she describe it... “Like he was sad to watch Tony go. Like he was mad at himself but also mad at Tony?”
The way Steve says that, the edge of fear peeking through the curtains, cuts through Tony’s anger. He takes a deep breath (big mistake because all he smells is Steve and that makes him want to dive head back into want) and reaches deep to find his last shred of self-control. He relaxes his grip on Steve’s arm and raises his hand up to cup Steve’s jaw. And Tony reminds the other man, “If I didn’t want this with you, my body wouldn’t be behaving the way it is. Trust that.”
Steve swallows; Tony follows the bob of his Adam’s apple and yearns. It feels like his yearning is stoking the fire deep in his belly, fanning the flames as he imagines what lies in his immediate future.
Steve Rogers looks as approachable and friendly as a block of ice. Kamala can’t help but wonder how Tony can walk up to the guy and start talking to him when he looks one wrong comment away from punching someone.
If he’s completely honest? Steve’s thought a lot about this moment. Before, when he’d been coming to terms with his feelings about Tony, he’d tried to visualize what it would be like, being in bed with Tony. He’d struggled to form a complete picture. The dates, he could imagine easily enough. Thinking about lying on a couch and lazily making out with Tony had sounded amazing. But the sex? Steve had floundered.
Unfortunately, he doesn’t manage to intimidate Rhodey. In fact, Rhodey seems amused by his scowling and by Carol and Sam’s unbridled curiosity.  “Let’s just say Tony’s love life is going to get a lot more lively.”
Unfortunately, it doesn’t completely work. Carol still demands some answers. Tony doesn’t give her all the details but he at least explains what’s been going on between him and Steve for the past few months.
Steve doesn’t take the bait. Instead, a tint of ‘Really, Tony?’ creeps into his expression, not enough to overshadow his worry but just enough for Tony’s smile to crack around the edges. “It’s nothing,” he admits, trying to turn his attention into the show. Ugh. The opening credits are still rolling. “Just a small snag in my plans, that’s all.”
makes Tony cry whenever he takes a bite because it's the perfect balance between apple tartness and sugar-y sweetness.
locked in a date. Given that it’s four days before Christmas, trying to get a reservation at any of his usual haunts had been challenging.
If Tony’s totally honest, he feels super crummy about his last conversation with Kamala. He shouldn’t have unloaded on her. Thinking back on it, he wants to kick himself in the head for it. She’s said a couple of times that him, Steve, and Carol are her three favorite superheroes. Of course, it’s easy to forget that Kamala’s got a favorite superhero other than Carol but... God. he’d really messed up.
be friends again at some point in the future. Sure the odds of that happening are the same as being struck by lightning, run over by a semi, run over by a herd of cattle, and then be struck by lightning
Tony’s face twists into a terrible kind of sadness that makes Steve heartache despite his best efforts. “I was scared,” Tony admits in a hushed whisper. “Scared of how you’d take it. Scared that... you’d blame me. Or tell me I hadn’t done enough. That my best wasn’t good enough. I’ve always been scared of that.”
Before Tony can say anything, Steve grabs hold of him and kisses the stuffing out of him. Carol and Sam make matching noises of surprise. Hank makes a weird ‘gruk!’ sound. And Enchantress says, voice dripping with disgust, “This wasn’t what I had planned!” Someone hits her, probably Thor if the heavy
“Why not?” Kamala asks plaintively. She’d thought that Tony would jump at the opportunity to be friends with Steve again.
She glances at Tony but quickly turns her whole attention towards Steve, whose naked expression makes for a far more interesting study than Iron Man’s mask.
Tony takes a step forward, telegraphing his intent by placing his hands on Steve’s chest. He feels Steve’s breath hiccup in surprise underneath his palms. But Steve doesn’t move away. Instead, his hands move. One takes hold of Tony’s hand and the other moves up to cup Tony’s face. Eyes going half-mast, Tony holds his breath in anticipation. Inhale; Steve’s leaning in. Exhale; Steve’s eyes are closing. Inhale; contact.
Kamala would like the record to state that she hates the Wrecking Crew. Capital H. Hate. She understands that ‘hate’ is a strong word but hate them she does. Because one of them, she didn’t see who had conked her on the head with something and made her pass out in the middle of a fight.
. Kamala stares at her scribbles, fingers tightening on her pencil. Sam starts to say that Steve doesn’t think that but Tony interrupts, “You don’t have to cover for him. I appreciate what you’re trying to do. I really do. But I just don’t think that we’ll get back to where we were. There’s no trust left there.”
The thought comes back to him when he sees Steve waiting for him outside the restaurant. Tony’s heart swells with love even as his stomach twists with nerves. Steve’s wearing crisp gray pants and a long coat. He’s shifting from foot to foot, eyes shifting restlessly over the sidewalk.
Steve tears the envelope open and pulls the letter out. He starts to read, scowling heavily. But a couple of lines in, his frown deepens. But not in anger like he’d expected. But in confusion.
, Steve wonders as he watches Tony stack the dirty dishes together. They’ve just finished a large team meal and everyone’s gone off to relax and do whatever, leaving Steve and Tony, who’s turn it is to clean up and do the dishes, alone in the dining room.
Startled, Tony glances at the tissues before looking up at Steve. When Steve nods, Tony accepts with a quiet thanks. For a long moment, Tony stares at the packet. Steve’s ready to ask if something’s wrong when Tony says in a low voice, “I love you too much to stay on the sidelines when you’re in danger. I knew that the choices I was making would piss you off but I went through with them. I thought... I thought I could live with you being angry at me. At least you’d be alive.”
Steve doesn’t let him say anything, however. He rolls them over, pushes Tony down with a fiery kiss that steals Tony’s strength away. Steve’s a greedy, eager, giving lover, Tony soon learns. He’s intense and focused, fingers moving restlessly over Tony like he’s trying to commit Tony to memory. Tony writhes on his sheets, gasping when he squirms
Tony thinks as he faceplants into the luxurious sheets, glad he decided to take a shower before going vertical.
Tony swallows, dry throat clicking, before he shakes his head. He needs to not let his dick get the better of him. It would be embarrassing if Steve found out about his crush by smelling how horny Tony is for him. Because if Steve’s
It’s so easy to give into his instincts: to kiss Steve, push him down, line them up, and sink down on Steve’s dick. It feels as easy as breathing. Easier maybe, to open his body completely to Steve,
An echo of something shattering rings inside Steve’s skull. The shards bounce around with Tony’s confession, neatly missing the slots that’ll take this information to the proper parts of Steve’s brain for processing. Or maybe some of Tony’s words
“You should ask Steve to join the team. That’ll probably make things easier for both of you,” Sam talks over him.
And yet Tony’s made so many questionable decisions that it’s practically second nature for Steve to assume the worst from him. Which tends to make him feel guilty because he shouldn’t be assuming the worst. Even if there’s past precedence for it. But, Steve tells himself, this is a different situation. He shouldn’t feel guilty because it’s not Tony’s fault he got zapped by a magic spell. And if he was a good friend, which Steve likes to think he is, he needs to stop Tony before he hurts someone. Everyone remembers what happened the last time Tony lost his morals and no one wants a repeat of that. If you look at Tony’s decisions in the past couple of years... then well. No one can blame Steve for bracing himself for the worst case scenario.
Carol gaps at Sam, clearly taken aback by this new piece of information. Before she accuses Tony of something, he hurriedly points out, “He’s not even
“I know,” Tony says, soft and placating. “I know I’ve done a lot of shitty things. But you have to believe me when I tell you that I did all that to protect you.”
Has Steve ever mentioned how much he loves Tony’s smile? Because he does. Smiling back in return, Steve continues, rattling off increasingly silly comparisons until Tony’s shaking with laughter rather than guilt. He waits until Tony’s done laughing. Then he pulls back, smile widening when he sees the happy flush on Tony’s cheeks.
“What I’m saying is,” Tony says when he catches her puzzled look. “I don’t know what could happen. Just because we don’t want to talk to each other now doesn’t mean that’s how it’s going to be forever. Who knows. Something might happen that’ll get us talking and we’ll be back at where we were. Maybe even better friends.”
Tony looks away but not before Steve sees the guilt creeping in. With a gentle touch, Steve guides Tony to meet his gaze again. Tony follows but his eyes remain downcase, shameful. Jeez. Okay. This is a hurt Tony’s still holding close to his heart.
Grinning, Tony happily obliges, pushing his jacket off to the floor. Another few steps back. Tony turns them around so that he’s leading, grinning as he says, “I know the way.”
Seriousness bleeds into Steve’s eyes as he asks, sounding as alpha as Tony’s ever heard him. “Tony. I’m going to ask you again. Are you sure you want to spend your heat with me? There’s still time to find you another alpha.”
“Apparently I can’t teach DUM-E spatial awareness,” Steve points out glumly as he takes a cookie for himself.
Steve lets his fingertips run up and down Tony’s side. He glances down between them at their soft cocks and shivers when he remembers the heat of Tony’s mouth on him. That had been...
There’s no magical sparks or glowing lights. Just Tony curiously turning the cell phone over in his hands as he asks, “This thing charged? Is there anything specific I should be looking for?”
Steve looks up and his big blue eyes are wet with unshed tears. “I didn’t mean to! I was trying to teach him how to play frisbee and he got a little too overexcited and crashed into a wall!” Tony opens his mouth to point out that
They fall into an easy rhythm after that. Tony works on his tablet while Kamala slogs through her homework. They both jolt in their seats when a loud ringtone blares through the speakers.
Startling, Steve looks down at Tony, mouth open in shock. His heart races in anticipation even as his stomach twists in worry. There’s too much going on thanks to the complete lack of information and Steve’s going to lose his fucking mind because of it. It doesn’t help that Steve sees the same uncertain storm raging inside of Tony as well. His brown eyes peer up at him in askance, asking a question that Steve doesn’t know. So all Steve can do is stare back and wait for Tony to
, a quiet voice reminds Steve. And it’s humbling as much as it’s upsetting. Steve presses his mouth against Tony’s shoulder and finds himself tightening his hold on the man. Tony makes a half-hearted grumble that the eggs are going to burn if Steve keeps this up but Steve doesn’t hear the complaint. He’s deep in the memory of an old conversation with Carol, shortly after his return.
They’re adults. They probably know better than to say anything too risque in front of her, even if she is ‘passed out.’ And if either of them
“Steve’s been pretty clear on where he stands,” Tony points out, voice tightly controlled to keep from letting his hurt show.
. The world is spinning and it’s colored blue-black, silver, azure, gold. All Tony knows is hot and firm muscles flexing under his hand as he climaxes.
? It’d totally looked like Steve was upset that he’d lost his temper and wanted... Na. She’s probably reading too much into it.
“I’m a tactile person,” Steve admits easily, dropping a kiss on Tony’s shoulder. His hands happily indulge in their newfound freedom, sneaking a little too close to Tony’s crotch, something he gets a reprimanding slap for. Steve pouts but obediently keeps his hands on Tony’s hips.
But this isn’t a day like any other. Instead of paying attention to the show, Tony’s mind is busy scrolling through his mental rolodex of contacts, wondering if he knows an alpha who is available to be his date for an upcoming gala. And by upcoming gala he means a $2,500 a plate, black-tie dinner that’s going to be held in
have alerted someone. But several minutes pass by and Steve’s still rocking on his heels in the doorway. Alone.
Tony swallows. His eyes fall shut, brow twisting into a pain expression before he whispers, “I’ll think you love me back.”
that he has to let out in an exhale. But nope. It just gets stuck in his throat instead. It’s heavy and overwhelming and he has to try
It’s the scariest thing he’s had to admit in an age but this is Tony. Tony who has seen Steve at his best and worst and always held his hand out in friendship, love, and support. Tony who always catches Steve when he falls. Tony who opens his eyes and looks at him with so much hope that Steve’s knees almost give out on him.
“Is that right?” Tony asks, a smile in his voice. “You gonna give me that right incentive, Commander?”
“I just want you by my side. Where you’re supposed to be.” Steve takes a deep breath to steady himself before confessing, “I know you don’t trust me to-”
But, it occurs to Steve, as Tony presses delicate, butterfly kisses over his face, that it’s not falling. It’s lifting him up. Every bit of praise Tony showers him with, all the proud smiles Tony directs his way, they make Steve feel like he’s walking on air. And now, in bed with Tony, being told that he’s the best thing that’s happened to Tony, he’s going to be cared of,
Steve wants to mock Tony and his noble intentions because he’s failed miserably at that. But he can’t find any of his usual anger. The ice has cracked, revealing the deep sadness underneath. Steve’s voice shakes when he says, “I never asked for that. I never wanted it.”
. There’s just enough pressure to make tingles race down Tony’s spine and his fingers tighten around Steve’s. His free hand slides down, slipping under Steve’s coat to rest against his waist. Tony needs more contact. He needs this kiss to be more than sweet. He applies more pressure, parting his lips slightly in invitation to Steve but Steve doesn’t take it. Instead, he keeps the kiss gentle. Breaking away only to come back in a heartbeat, lips capturing Tony’s bottom lip for a second before letting go.
it is. It’s the coffee Tony makes when he’s having a bad day and he desperately needs a pick-me-up. It’s also kept hidden in a sealed jar deep in the coffee cabinet (mislabeled for increased security) because he doesn’t want the others getting their hands on it. How did Steve know where that coffee tin was is outside of Tony’s knowledge but what Tony
Thankfully, the doors open as soon as Steve slams his hand on the button, an action that comes with an audible cracking noise. Steve spins Tony around so that his back hits the wall and crows in immediately, hungry lips seeking out Tony’s parted ones.
