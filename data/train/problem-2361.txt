"That sounds like something Mrs Hudson would say," John smirked, though he took a deep breath as he looked at Sherlock in a way that was both the same as always and yet somehow so much more.
. I do wonder what you taste like…”
“God. You…you’re a right…right…
They argued about an abundance of things, not all of it important. Sometimes it was banter. Other times it was a rage inducing quarrel. Each time, Sherlock had watched John clench his fists and seethe, and each time he had expected a punch and sudden abandonment, things packed away in a frenzy, and then he’d felt panicked when the angry haze had dropped, spending hours waiting for John to snap, leaving the flat cold and empty.
“Okay… fine, how about the first person to ten wins in Snap gets to take one item of clothing off the other playing,” John said with a raised eyebrow, “
She frowned up at him, but smiled and patted his cheek again, “You
“It does a bit...” John said against Sherlock's lips, unsure whether it was even audible as he grasped for him.
“Misgender a turkey?” John blinked and coughed out a laugh, then looked over his shoulder at him, “I've been accused of
“Do you have to? It's... it's… I
to win. Have you sitting there in no pants whilst I crow like the winner.”
" he told him under his breath and slipped his hand inside to take John's cock in hand, to squeeze and stroke him, jittery with want. John let him, let him do what he wanted to him, and watched, hands gripping at his own knees as Sherlock took him clumsily to the brink of orgasm, then over it, then beyond it. "
Sherlock looked away and gave a nonchalant shrug, dropping his hand and altering his stance, “I’m
Ignoring the doubt, the fear, the heartbreak of the future, Sherlock nodded and slid his hand in John’s, “As I’ll ever be.”
“Huh, well thank you for answering,” John replied as he added the snapped cards to the bottom of his own stack. “You go first.”
Sherlock admired it from his seat with a slow smile, “You’re spoiling him already.”
“You probably noticed the red bowl in the fridge?” Mrs Hudson called. “Just heat it up in the microwave. Only a store bought one I’m afraid, but I made my own brandy butter, and there’s ice cream and custard as well.”
Sherlock regarded him coyly, “What? Admitting you have feelings for me that aren’t fully platonic?”
“And what of tomorrow?” Sherlock asked her, eating another carrot.
Clenching his eyes shut, high on John’s confident, come-hither, sexual prowess, Sherlock tried to focus, “I think I should tell you,” he whispered, taking a moment to breathe, dizzy with John’s presence as he leaned closer, inches from Sherlock’s face, “I have not really...that is I…”
"Yes, I know you bloody did!" John snorted.
! You're lucky you didn't get drop kicked to the floor with my bollocks on your face!”
“You loved every moment, so shut it,” Greg replied with a sigh, combing his fingers across Sherlock’s scalp and tucking his palm under the back of his head. “And you
“Ha! Yeah, or he’s experimenting on the neighbour's dead cat in the kitchen,” Greg snorted as he followed behind, patting John’s back and shoulders with friendly playfulness. “I really don’t know how you cope.”
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John rasped, “Say that again.”

please…” Sherlock whined through his gritted teeth plaintively, breathing heavily. “
, you’re good at what you do, no one can take that away from you or even dispute that fact, but you needn’t rub it in our faces every chance you get,” he told him.
“Let me tidy this away,” John said, and Sherlock could hear him piling all the leftover vegetables into two of the bowls.
With a breathy affirmative sound, still not entirely grounded from his pleasure high, Sherlock nudged Greg back, lips left red and slick, and nodded, “Yes,” he husked, Adam’s apple bobbing.
John’s hands suddenly came into view, covering his own quivering ones and Sherlock found him crouched before him, an understanding, if flustered and confused, smile greeting him, “You’re welcome,” he said, his cheeks a bright pink, “but, uh, yeah, a little… a little much.”
“It’s
John sucked, tasting the musky come. It wasn't pleasant, not exactly, but incredibly sexy to know that this was Sherlock, this was his essence that John was tasting and taking into himself, so he licked between each digit, chasing the flavour before pulling back with a pop, “I haven't done it twice in a row since my early twenties...” John mumbled idly, looking down at his cock, which leaked another dribble of come against the black fabric of his new pants, “but... but you make me want to give it a go.”
John blushed up to his hairline and gave an equally awkward smile, beginning to giggle, “We're such bloody idiots,” he snorted, pulling Sherlock in for a messy and oddly positioned kiss. “I couldn't not love you, you massive arse. Why would I want anyone else when you're here?”
..." John moaned in agreement and fiddled with his trousers, managing to get the flies open moments before he restlessly pulled them down along with his boxers, bending slightly to shimmy and kick them from his ankles and feet, taking one of Sherlock's nipples in his mouth in the meantime.
with you, you’ll take him on more walks and play with him when I’m at work… He’s going to love you more than me I think.”
“...No?” Sherlock asked in a light murmur, stroking his hand up the robe lapel and then across onto John’s skin, tracing his collarbones with tickling fingers. “Why not?”
“Oh, alright then,” she sighed, picking at the tape. Soon enough, a lead was revealed in a deep black leather. “There we are.”
“Yeah?” John breathed, allowing Sherlock to give him that gentle kiss, that sweet caress, and ignoring the inflamed rush of lubricious craving, “The smell of rancid sick from the imbeciles of London isn't putting you off me?”
“It’s fine,” John said, looking at Sherlock with an honesty he wasn’t expecting, and even a spot of humour. “It’s just… I thought you were married to your work.”
“Just like that,” John answered when he’d turned entirely the other way. Sherlock started to look back, confused, but then John’s arms pushed their way under his, sliding against his sides, and his hands pressed flat against his chest, pulling him back until his body was leaning against John’s torso. His arms wound around him like a comforting blanket.
“I think you should talk to him,” Santa suggested in a soft tone, giving him a look of compassion. “Talk to him and tell him how you feel. Lay it

“Yeah,” John nodded, stepping wobbly back, taking the change of subject like an unwanted gift. “Yeah that's – yeah. Good thing you’ve got those long legs, I wouldn’t be able to do it... couldn't reach when I tried to get rid of it the time I saw it. First time I saw them all.”
Darting a frustrated glance at Sherlock's continued attempt to spite him, John sighed, going with it, “Yeah... she's taken to wearing earplugs to bed. - He's a screamer,” he said, hitting back with a bit of his own dig and pointing at Sherlock with a complacent, peevish, tight smile.
need,” John muttered, his head ducked as they walked the short distance to the table Mrs Hudson had covered in bowls of roast potatoes, parsnips and carrots, peas, sprouts, plates of stuffing, a just of steaming gravy, and the roasted duck sitting at the very end, a sharp knife ready for carving.
“It's Christmas, I'll
six hours! It's a massive improvement.”
! Mine aren’t that sensitive…”
“You’re early!” Mrs Hudson said with a delighted cry, stepping back to let them in.
Unable to resist any longer, John made a more pointed shift of his hips, pressing the two of them more resolutely together and lowered a hand to curl against the small of Sherlock’s back, urging him to respond in kind.
“Don’t worry about my turning up here again,” Sherlock threw over his shoulder as he slammed open the door and stepped out. “You can wallow in your ‘moment of peace’ to your heart’s content.”
. Why? Because Sherlock Holmes had everything covered beforehand, apparently. Sherlock Holmes knows everything, except when the sky is going to open and drown anyone under it!”
, thank-you-very-much! Perfectly fine!”
The shiver that took Sherlock’s body was almost violent in its promiscuous yearning, “Yes,” he keened, groping at John’s lower back and hips. “
"I bet he would," John agreed happily as Orion bounded back to them.
To force the both of them to stop, John picked up the lubricant and noisily poured some into his palm, clapping and rubbing his hands together to spread and warm the gel. Having earned their attention John skimmed one hand over Sherlock's cock and balls, coating, kneading, and tickling, and let his other hand trail down between Sherlock's buttocks. With Greg’s eyes caught with his own, John parted them with his knuckles and rubbed his index finger around the warm puckered skin, Sherlock’s erection twitching under his hand. He smiled, running a hand up and down the hardened shaft, playing with the foreskin and trailing his slick fingers across the sensitive head.
“Yes… I… yes…” he slurred in response, cock still twitching roughly from where it was trapped and squeezed against John’s stomach, still faintly pulsing out oozing droplets of liquid heat. “
? You think this is fun?” Sherlock exclaimed, voice breaking, which only made the blush on his cheeks hotter. “Mrs Hudson you are an
“Sherlock,
a bit...” Greg adjusted his stance, evidently thinking about the offer more and more as the seconds ticked by, fidgety and unsure, but not disgusted. Not put off. Not declining them. “
“I'm sure Sherlock's still up. Probably in his mind palace at this time of night.”
Wanting to watch that change in his face, watch all that certainty and imperviousness get replaced with shocked delight, with aching want, John waited until Sherlock had reached with his right hand, fingers lightly grazing along his flushing pelvis, down, down, down to where he was still growing, still lengthening, and around to draw a line up the underside, before he swooped in and grabbed a fistful of his hair, yanking his head back to arch his throat. It was a lovely sight, lovelier still when Sherlock gasped with an open mouth, shaking and bucking up, erection filling out with a thick jolt. John was addicted to how perfect it was, how instant the reactions came, how unique and unexpected his strongest erogenous zone was. Was this why he always played with his hair? Was this why he’d claw and tug and scratch whenever he was overly annoyed? How hard was too hard?
--” He blinked, surprised that he had said out loud the things that he'd tried to keep to himself for so long. He didn't want Sherlock feeling like John hero-worshipped him. Even if it was semi-true.
Saw him and needed to go to him.
. - Insane. Unsure. - It'll get figured out... ”
John let himself brush his way into the corner of Sherlock's quirking top lip, “So, you're telling me I can continue doing all of those annoying things, forever, with no repercussions? Okay.
“Yes ma’am,” John said, and his nose brushed against Sherlock’s hair again. His lovely, warm, pressing nose.
John snorted and chuckled, “We can set the rules later.”
you want, free of charge,” Sherlock told her dismissively, despite the fact John would not do something so unethical. With a quick glance at John, he leaned further forward with a wink at Mrs Hudson’s impish face. “I could always get you some more of those ‘herbal soothers’ too.”
“Yeah… Yeah,
John rested his hand on his shoulder, "He's

right over to me and even stretched his neck for the lead!” She bent down to pat the pup on the back and as she straightened, she glanced at Sherlock, her eyes crinkling in happy amusement at how he was cowering behind John. Trapped against the seat with a racing heart, mind stuck on a distant loop of his childhood, his dog. Sherlock felt his cheeks flush and scowled at her with a sudden petulant dislike. “Don’t worry, Orion is a

“Hm. Bit of a shame that though,” Sherlock mumbled but held up a hand at John’s offended and confused look. “It seems to work well with one of us being more experienced. - Have you not done a bit of it with the fairer sex?”

Not unless you show them, which you won’t, so I don’t see what the problem is here?” He tugged John a few shuffling inches closer, giving a slanted grin, following his recline with an incline, bending further, as if he was sending John into an elegant dip. “Could be worse? Could be the face of a children’s cartoon character—”

One of Greg’s eyebrows rose as yet more pieces slotted into their places. “Date night?”
“Merry Christmas.”
“I knew it!” John said triumphantly, slapping the bar as emphasis and then thumping at his own chest, pointing at his own face, his head, despite it being hat-less. “M' a detective… sorta.”

Greg pointed into the living room when John turned with a questioning eyebrow lift and there, bundled up on the sofa, hair a mess, and eyes narrowed, was Sherlock, body wrapped in his duvet. Completely concealed.
“You said it was fine?” Sherlock said, having noticed John’s sudden change in expression. “You said—”
Tilting his head with a hum, smile slipping up higher on one side, Sherlock took a step closer, “I thought as much. Good. That’s good. Hopefully now you’ll cut down on the amount of times you

Scoffing, Sherlock rolled his eyes to look away, though didn’t argue the case, “You don’t want to kiss me.”
Sherlock glared at him and tightened his grip on John’s hand, “So you’re not okay?”
“The shape, feel, and wrapping paper give it away, I’m spoiling nothing,” Sherlock retorted as he ripped it open, pulling out, as he’d correctly deduced, a rolled up pair of new socks. Luckily they were only patterned in the striped sense, and even of a material Sherlock took a moment to label as bamboo fibre. She had been listening to him after all. He smiled at them, rubbing the fabric between his fingers, squashing it in one hand. There were many benefits to bamboo socks, one of which was the luxurious nature of the fibres.
“Turn...turn

Once the car door was closed the taxi drove off, undoubtedly to pick up his next overly charged customer, leaving them both to stare at the shelter together, “They would have opened ten minutes ago,” John said as he looked at his watch. He pulled his gloves off a moment later and stuffed them in his pocket, holding out his now bare hand to Sherlock. “Ready?”
“I should do the same,” John said, putting the bowls back in their box so he could carry everything better. “Thank you so much for everything Mrs Hudson.” He kissed her on the cheek. “You’ve really made this Christmas
Running his moist thumb across Sherlock's cupid's bow, John then drew it up his cheek, quivering bodily, swaying forward and rolling his waist, “Yeah.
? Mrs Hudson... we... listen, you have to know, the two of us? We... we... we're not..."
“Well, I'm going to go out and have a look around London anyway. Might take Hudders with me… unless you want to accompany me? Go for a wander around the shops and possibly point out what you may be inclined to like on Christmas day?” John asked, eyebrow already raised knowing that Sherlock was highly likely to say no. He wasn't a fan of crowded shops, even when it wasn't the Christmas rush. If there was a choice in the matter, he often opted out of it, only going out into the bustling streets when necessary or dragged.

away, and then Sherlock sighed. “How did you get that from what Lestrade was saying to you?
“As much as I loved the main course, dessert is always my favourite,” he said into the companionable silence that followed, still somehow not liking the quiet too much. It left him time to think. Thinking about John, about their dog, about the future with both.
“Keep you... keep you smelling like me...” John said breathlessly, knowing he was almost at his peak, “Rub my scent into you and – and – show everyone you're mine.” He gasped, fingertips digging into Sherlock's arse roughly, hard enough to mark as he increased the pace and speed, grunting with each successive thrust as he bit his lip and closed his eyes, losing himself. “
friend. Someone I can rely on and trust. Someone who needs me as much as I need them.” John leaned in for a soft kiss, lingering for a moment, basking in their closeness, before pulling back. “We're two halves of the same coin.”
—Okay, how about instead of a gift you give me another one of those shoulder rubs?” John asked, giving Sherlock's hunched back a few brief strokes, trying not to linger, trying not to appreciate the heat that came off him, the sensation of his dressing gown against his fingertips. “It was

“And yet you continued?” John frowned. “Your logic boggles my mind.”
“Just… I mean, just when we're here.
Mrs Hudson didn’t seem particularly happy about the idea and gave a sorrowful sort of sigh, “Why can’t there be more than one in the living room? The border between the kitchen and the living room,
“I don’t think it had anything to do with you being a wuss. It’s more the fact that Sherlock is…

doing in our living room?”
“I will. If it’s too much I’ll just slip out,” he assured in a mumble against John’s sensitive lips, slumping sideways into the wall with a shaky sigh. “God it’s been so long since anyone kissed me. Far, far too long…”
“I noticed,” John said with a self-satisfied smirk, though it had the warmth of John’s happiness in Sherlock’s joy. “So! What shall we do until then?”
“What other theories do you have?” Santa asked, gesturing for another drink from the barman and ordering John a pint of ice water with a knowing tip of his head, and a wink. "Not just about her, but... about other things?"
ways.” He took a breath, stroked a swirling pattern into the hair on John’s chest and leaned close. “And if you are 'open' to such a thing, if you are aware what it entails, from the both of us, from the situation, and have no qualms, then... perhaps I

biology.”
“I was glad you came,” John said honestly, pulling out his house keys and slipping them in the lock, turning with a twist. The knocker was still skewed, that was a good sign. “Didn't really know anyone else except Mike and appreciated the company.” Pushing open the door, John motioned with a nod of his head to the interior and gave a welcoming smile, expecting the Inspector needed more comfort, more familiarity than the stale flat he'd been forced to move into. John knew how that felt. Knew what it was like being stuck in a trite environment with nothing but dark thoughts drowning every moment. “Coming up for a coffee?”
to kiss me?” John asked with a frown, feeling a fizz of something in his gut at the thought of kissing him, at the thought of being allowed that, at wanting that so badly it made him light-headed. “I'm not going to force him to--”
.” He winced after he'd spoken, pushing back into his chair a little, feeling more than a bit bad boasting about his sex life when Greg's marriage had fallen apart. Thankfully, Greg seemed to be more than amused, he was tickled pink.
“I'm making you one too, Sherlock,” John called out from the kitchen amongst the chorus of slight dins with the mugs, spoon and kettle as he prepared the drinks. He was quick, not willing to leave the two of them alone for too long if he could help it, and brought them through to the living room before Sherlock's glare became any harder. He planted down Sherlock's mug first, in arms reach of him, if he so chose to extend towards it. “Why are you restless anyway? I'm sure you could have found something to do? I had assumed you might continue doing that thing with the tadpoles that you started yesterday.”
Feeling shaky, Sherlock rubbed at the fabric of his socks and stood up, taking the fish with him to fiddle with, “I’ll...get my shoes and coat,” he told him, stomach turning over. “Don’t forget the lead.”
the tricks,” Sherlock told him, looking down at Orion. He felt better now that they had him, now that he’d met him. He wasn’t a replacement. He was different. His personality, the look in his eyes, the frolicking wriggles, it was unique and Sherlock’s feelings toward them, toward him, was just as distinctive.
“Just tell me when you're close and we'll stop, we'll cool off,” John whispered, nuzzling behind his ear as his hand continued a steady rhythm, occasionally twisting to tickle Sherlock's frenulum, to dip into the beading, dripping pre-ejaculate.
,” he sighed contentedly, sounding almost drunk.
Sherlock quickly sat back up and pressed his lips together, trying to stifle his need to beam, thoughts now scattered, “Does it have icing on it?” he asked.
The room spun unnaturally as he rubbed his face, blinked and widely gaped around him, and John quickly began gulping a few times to try and keep his stomach contents from raising up his throat. When that didn't work he sipped on yet more lager, the last dregs of what was left in his glass, forcing the sensation away until he was able to sit up straight and look around again without the queasy rocking in his mind, the rolling of his stomach, and the overly doubled vision. There were a couple of work groups nearby, dotted around wet tables, chatting well-natured small talk from what John could make out, from what he could understand, whilst wearing silly paper hats from their broken crackers. He wanted a hat. He wanted that small talk, to be included in that group or have one like it, untroubled and so laid back and trusting that he could believe in them, in himself. Why wasn't he more like them? Groaning, John turned his attention to an old man who was sat listening to the darts on the television in the corner and then… and then... then John saw him. A man in a red hat.

helpful and stopped my shoulder being tight. So I'd love another one. - How's that?”
John repeated the movement again and again and again, listening to the chorus of moans, and started a slow, gentle rhythm that rapidly became harder and deeper, faster and rougher. Taken by the motion and the fiery need to have, to take, John fucked to the broken, hoarse and then whimpering sounds of Sherlock’s building passionate mania, his long fingers going into spasm against his bowed spine as he knocked and hit his forehead into the wall. There was a moment where he lifted his head, trying to twist and rest his cheek, his chin, against it, but John’s increasing thrusts made it difficult. Sherlock didn’t complain though. Not even when, on one particularly strong snap of John’s hips, he almost fell into the solid surface entirely. He only made low, encouraging sounds, crying out and shuddering whenever John came into contact with his prostate a bit too long, a bit too vigorously, a bit too often. His toes clenched deep into the carpet.
the point,” Sherlock told him, swallowing, looking away with clear aggravation, and then dropping his gaze to the floor. “You didn’t answer them all.”
about. Stalking the streets, looking for their next victim!”
"Bells on bobtail ring,' making spirits bright. What fun it is to laugh and sing, a sleighing song tonight!"
John hadn't even been watching it, had been so lost in the sensation of Sherlock's heated skin under his fingers, that it was all he knew, all he cared to know, and hadn't been paying any attention to the TV, at all. Taking the remote from the arm of the sofa, he switched to a radio channel, one that played soft instrumental and folk-y type songs. John enjoyed such music, enjoyed listening to the simple vocals, and he knew that Sherlock did too. Knew it was calm enough that he wouldn't be disgruntled by any pounding bass line or an obnoxious radio host.
Sherlock arched an eyebrow at him, “After the Gladstone bag?”

He fell asleep on the way there and when he was roused by the shaking hand of the cabbie, as he stumbled out onto the pavement, as he made it inside and climbed the stairs to the top, John's stomach, his body, revolted against him. He made it to the toilet just in time, skidding on his knees and banging his head on the lid as he lifted, but at least it wasn't on the floor, wasn't something he'd have to clean up later. It was horrible, yet it was for the best, and time passed him just as blearily, just as quickly as it had in the pub, until John didn't know what time it was and his stomach was clenching for what felt like the fifteen hundredth time, forcing him over the toilet bowl again.
"Badly?—"
Hair pulling is not overly masochistic,” Sherlock growled, the colour decorating his skin darkening despite his icy glower. “I thought you were here to watch, not talk?”
The lube had been left in easy access for John and he made himself comfy between Sherlock’s spread feet with a praising, appreciative clench of one knobbly knee, “
of us anyway,” John said as he handed it over, closing the door behind him.
to gag you? Because I will. I have the supplies to do so. I’m quite good at rendering people mute, as it happens,” Sherlock groused and with a pop, and a wet squelching ripple, something cold dribbled against his upper spine. He dipped one dexterous finger into it and spread it down in swirling, wiggling, curving sweeps. "In a plethora of ways."
John must have felt his shivering though as he gave Sherlock a squeeze and the space behind his ear a kiss, “What do you need, Sherlock?”
Sherlock could have fought him, denied him, twisted himself free, yet he held still with greedy impatience, perspiration running down his face, his neck, and beading in shimmering, quivering droplets down his strained back. John was met with a slight, firm resistance when he nudged further forward, the tight slide of their coupling obscenely loud, but all too soon Sherlock bared down to take him, to permit himself to be impaled, and John was bumping into him, inch by inch. It made his mind reel. It forced his eyes closed. It ignited a ravenous urge deep within.
, I know I’m prying, but... I’m just trying to fully understand it. Just a bit curious about how things work. - Do you get jealous? Is it open so
day?” Sherlock criticised, aimlessly poking at the dog coat and trying not to blush more than he already had. He hated when John saw through him so easily. He prided himself on his masks he wore, the wall he’d built up, of how in control he was of his mind, his body, and so to have everything crumble and betray him, shift and break down, was almost too much to fully bear. Sherlock sneaked a glance at John and felt his irritated fear weaken at the look of his face, the colour of his eyes, the feel of his rough, coarse, working fingers in his, and quickly tried to suppress a shudder of emotion. “I’m fine…”
John walked and placed a hand on his lower back, holding it as steady as he could while the rest of him trembled, “I didn't know she was going to do
? Were they on our street? In the park? - I don't want to hear any more Christmas songs. I am going to go
“That’s not why,” John told him and leaned in, twisting at his handful of curls so he could rest his elbow on the headrest and pull Sherlock’s head back further. He then brought one knee up to stabilise himself, crushing a number of decorating bows, and dragged his touch down to Sherlock’s navel, to the hair beneath. John was shaking, was too hot, too hard, too hyped up by it all. He wanted to kiss Sherlock, to taste him, to push him down onto the sofa and grind, push, rub his own cock against his. Wanted to do a lot more than watch. “Give yourself a
John chuckled and nudged him back, letting their noses bump with another ache of desire, “So, uh, fancy Angelo's tonight? Can't really be bothered cooking. Not after doing those dishes. Not knowing I'd have to do them
about turkeys. Turkeys are actually
, no,” Sherlock mumbled, pressing his lips to more and more areas of John’s face, though always going back to his mouth, always introducing a new kiss with new pressure, with a building need.
“She usually does,” John replied with a chuckle. “Now come on, we don’t have long before the taxi arrives.”
“We got you something,” John said, lifting the present in his hands.
Greg dabbed at his face with alternating hand and sleeve, putting his mug aside with an agreeing nod, “Shame you can’t do that during cases.”
“Can I...” John muttered, stopping Sherlock when he went to change the angle and went in to kiss him harder, feeling slightly stupid for even asking as he slowly slid his hands around until both were cupping Sherlock's naked bottom, rubbing and exploring. He stroked his thumbs up and down the soft, peach like skin and let their kissing continue, going for one, then another, then a third, pushing his tongue in around Sherlock's, his own cock leaking light strand of pre-come against his stomach. "
It was soon to end though, John pulling away and resting their brows together, his calloused fingers tucking themselves into his curls, “Don’t forget to breathe.”
“No she wasn’t,” Sherlock interrupted in an irritated rumble.
“No. I...I can do it,” Sherlock assured him, lifting a hand to touch John’s face and stroke the edge of his ear, needing to ground himself but finding him forever floating high on the flow of adoration he felt for John.

Sherlock played on request for the next fifteen minutes, swapping between Mrs Hudson’s and John’s requests with a splash of his own interests, at which point Mrs Hudson rose from her seat, saying she had to check on the duck. Thankful for the pause, Sherlock gave her brief shrug, trying not to show how fatigued he felt already. It seemed his transport needed to sleep.
There was another click and Mrs Hudson tittered in delight, “
"It's okay, love. Don't be embarrassed. I haven't
? What this
Sherlock hummed, feigning vague interest and pretended to be annoyed with the drooping bow of some tinsel looped across the top of the mirror, “What?”
“… Do you want me to kiss it better?”
,” Sherlock breathed in evident intrigue and confused pleasure, his back muscles bunching as he wiggled and arced his spine further. He took it well for a first-timer. Holding his breath and shuddering as John twisted and crooked the digit with slow, pushing, hunger. His anger was a sizzling background noise of static to the crashing, fizzing, surging arousal at having Sherlock at his mercy, under his hands, on his finger.
“Wait, you think I'm
possible way?”
“I’ll come too,” Sherlock told them, throwing a smile over his shoulder for good measure, peeking at John. John sent him a grateful look and one of his personal smiles that could only mean he was proud of Sherlock for doing a small thing. Mrs Hudson, meanwhile, tittered a farewell and headed back out of their flat.

“Tuh-the
John flinched and tried to look more closely at the bottle Sherlock had his eye on, craning his neck and pushing up onto his elbows, “
Sherlock blinked, looked him up and down, and then burst out laughing, turning away to cover his face and bend at the waist, “I’m… I’m

"What's that supposed to mean?"
John squinted, just to make sure, just to see more, and leaned in, lowering his voice with a unfurling, arrogant smirk, “You're

He pushed open the front door quickly once he was at the flat, heading straight upstairs and kicking off his shoes, though he left his coat on, using it, for the moment to hide the pants as he tried to think of somewhere else to stash them where Sherlock wouldn't see, couldn't find, or was able to deduce, in anyway, what he had received. The possibility of trying, however, of rushing to his room to hide, was ended when John walked face-first into Sherlock, knocking his forehead into his shirt-clad torso. It made him stumble and grunt, muddling his already messy mind.
person is a turkey, but it still counts. - You're a good person, Mr Holmes.”
“You… you
“...Good…” Sherlock repeated, mouth dry, voice tight. He watched John’s posture deflate, saw when the spark from his gaze left, and witnessed the dropping of his shoulders. He stared and stared and stared and then everything fell from his hands, fluttering to the floor with a snapping flash of paper, and Sherlock closed the distance between them before he knew he’d moved at all. His hands reached, cradling John’s face, pulling him in, completely out of his control as they guided a startled John closer. Sherlock took a sharp, gasping inhale through his nose, surprised at himself, and found himself leaning in and kissing John soundly on the mouth.
John considered him for a moment, considered his words and how he had said them, and then put his cards down, reaching for Sherlock's hand, “What if... I don't want it... to be open?” he asked. “I – I find you
Sherlock peered at it and looked to John in the image, to his expression, and the slant of his head as he nuzzled into one dark wave of his wild hair, “John is certainly,” he responded quietly, mesmerised by the picture.
Moaning through a clenched jaw, Sherlock began thrusting up into his fist to obey, pre-ejculate giving more than enough lubrication, coming out in dribbling lines and wetting his fingers, the tops of his thighs, and then flung at John, on the sofa, as Sherlock circled his hips so hard, so impassionately, so frantically, that his abdominal muscles undulated. It was almost enough to send John scrabbling for his jeans and he growled, finding himself swaying towards that exposed and prettily wrapped neck. Everything about Sherlock was delicious. The feelings that the man brought through John hurt his heart, stole his breath, and unnerved him. What was it he felt exactly? What were they? What did any of this mean? He couldn’t get the questions out of his head, the same repeating questions, couldn’t stop and force the anxiety and disconcertment away long enough to rationalise or answer anything. Had never been able to do that. Not to himself, not to his therapist, and not to Sherlock.
“Alright… Okay, wait... just... just put my cock on your tongue and open your mouth,” John grunted, toes curling in the carpet as his hips began a steady movement, thrusting forward, pushing his shaft and tip against Sherlock's embracing tongue. It was hot, wet and utterly perfect, and John could feel himself almost at the peak by the way it wiggled and clutched. “Shit…
, that we may never... and I..."
Sherlock flushed and looked down, ears burning, “John and I have always sat this close when seated on sofas,” he mumbled first, before clearing his throat, making sure to avoid eye contact with them both as he tilted his head in John’s direction to watch for his reaction, to see what he would say. He was unsure if John wanted it to be made public so soon. Was unsure if even he, himself, wanted that.
“Oh, nothing,” she said, focusing on her little plastic mirror. “I’m just glad you’re

John nodded sluggishly, his eyes filled with alcohol sozzled tears, “Mrs Santa?”
“That film has some very memorable quotes.”
for this,” he muttered, attention focused on the task and expression tightened.
As the man entered the open living space, clothed in his pyjamas and dressing gown, he yawned, “Merry Christmas, Sherlock,” he said. “Tea?”
“If you say so,” John said and finished the descent down to 221A. The smells of roasting poultry was in the air, along with the smell of fresh, warm gingerbread.
John groaned painfully and let his head rest on the edge of the toilet pan. He was never going to drink again.
“I thought he could be part of the family,” John interrupted, voice a higher volume to drown Sherlock out, as the edges of annoyance crept in. “And it was

! Sherlock, John is home.” Did she really, genuinely see the situation between Sherlock and him? Was she right? What if she was? What did that mean for him? For them? With his heart in his throat, he looked at her, watched her, wondering how she thought she could see so clearly, could think the answer was so simple. This was Sherlock. This was Sherlock and him. If things went wrong, if John lost this, any of this, he wasn’t sure how he’d cope. He was sidetracked, pulled from his spiralling thoughts, when there was a shuffling noise from the other side of the door, and he felt his heart leap, something in his tummy twist oddly.
“Can I kiss you?” John asked finally, satisfied that Sherlock was ready.
“Beautiful...” he whispered as he pushed another lazy kiss to his clavicle.
“A dog’s a big responsibility,” John replied, but there was a sad, knowing look that flashed across his face.

don’t take them down,” Mrs Hudson beseeched them with a frown and a sigh, giving John glance of mild disappointment, as if she expected better of him, as if she expected him to side with her. “I think they look nice. And they’re a fun tradition!”
Slowly, Sherlock shuffled over to him and moved tentatively close, not sure what to do with his hands, “Like...
“I’ll be
happy," John said as Sherlock joined him standing again.

“Definitely not,” Sherlock laughed, wanting to kiss him again. He wished they could be kissing all the time.
“What if he brings it up again?” Sherlock mumbled.
“You’re thinking too much,” John muttered into his ear.
“I… I don’t need to be so
Everything was immediately halted, however, when he pushed open the door and was faced with Sherlock himself, staring intently, “Hi,” John said nervously, shifting his footing. “I – I mean, um, how are you doing?”

“No,” Sherlock murmured, fingers fidgeting with his coat sleeves. “Not yet.”
buying gifts – It doesn't have to be anything expensive or massive, you know. Just a token of my… appreciation of you.” John wiggled his toes in his socks, shuffling a little awkwardly at the admission. "I also like the look on people's faces when they open something from me. And I want to... see that look on you too."
Sherlock exhaled a shaky breath in the cramped space between them, against John’s face, as they parted and regarded him with lidded eyes, gaze darting in quick jittery motions to and fro. He held an odd expression and the atmosphere around them had changed, had shifted and transformed into something that was almost choking. It closed in on John, invaded him, as the seconds ticked by, as the realisation of what he’d done, what this had opened up, fully bloomed. He watched Sherlock visibly swallow, mouth unfurling into a dazed sort of smile, and he felt himself drown in it, incapable of resisting it, of pushing it down. He scared him, probably more than his feelings had beforehand, and he let his hands slip down to hang at his sides, unsure what to do now. Had he ruined everything? They had started something. Properly started something. Had crossed that line that they’d been skipping close to and sliding along for days now.

Leaving the flannel to soak in the warm water, he padded quickly to the kitchen, cooling himself on the tiles and side while he filled a small glass with cold water and returned to rinse and wring the flannel again, walking back into the bedroom, aware of his nakedness as he stepped to the edge of the bed.
. - How far away from here were they?” he demanded and turned to sprint and skid into the living room, hopping to the window where he peered out with narrowed, searching eyes. After a second of stunned silence from John, Sherlock yanked shut one of the curtains and pointed at him. “

“… Are you sure? I mean, I appreciate the gesture, I do, but won't it be weird? What with you two... bumping uglies?” Greg questioned, eyeing them both as he took a bottle gratefully. “He is naked and
A breathless jumble of sweetly rough, complimenting words were murmured and brushed against his perspiring temple as he was lowered down to lie on Sherlock's panting torso. Blissed out and euphoric, John pressed a kiss to Sherlock's wet hairline, shivering when Greg moved in to breathe the both of them in as if he couldn’t help himself.
“Nahhh!” John shook his head just to show him how utterly wrong he was and almost toppled backwards, yet again forcing the other man to assist, to steady him with big, rough, warm hands. “
Another card followed John's, “I do understand the worry,” he murmured. “I do not want to ruin things either. - But I’ve
that, thank you,” Sherlock snapped in irritation, finding the thought of allowing the dog, his dog, near any danger abruptly unpleasant. He pushed a sudden influx of memories back and turned to put his violin away. “But it’s not necessary to use him
“Mm, I’m good, John. You know that. You
have plans?” Sherlock asked with the beginnings of a frown, sitting up straighter and squinting, looking at the slope of John’s back, the tilt of his shoulders where he was leaning against the side, and the wiggling flex of his naked toes.
of you. - I thought you'd both be surprised.
“You want me.
John could tell he was really getting into his role with what they were doing, their open agreement, and he found himself inching forward to pant against Sherlock’s knees as Greg’s face got red with want. There was a visible bulge in his trousers, big and thick with promise. It was ignored, though unmistakeable. Greg hissed passed a hungry grin and couldn’t seem to stop himself from trapping the lobe of Sherlock’s ear between his teeth.
John smiled brightly back at him and pulled him close, releasing his hand only to wrap his arm around Sherlock’s back. Grateful for the open invitation and clear permission to get as close as he wanted, or rather dared, Sherlock lowered his head to John’s shoulder, watching how his Adam’s apple bobbed, how still gloriously tanned his skin looked, covered in a cluster or two of faint freckles. He hated himself for not doing anything sooner, for not being smart enough, quick enough, for not spotting the signs or perhaps not believing them. If he had known, if only he’d known, he’d have been this close, this warm, this wanted, before. Wouldn’t he?
, on the other hand…” He gave the spot that had been marked with lipstick a heated glare and another rub with his thumb, cradling the side of John's face. “No doubt
“Mm, fatigued is right,” John grumbled and glared at him, at the pout that still held his mouth, but cautiously lifted his arms, wincing at the sudden twinge from his shoulder. “Why is it that
“You okay?” Greg asked quietly and with some emerging worry.
“Don’t patronise me,” Sherlock grumbled, shifting away and shivering as his growing erection slid along John’s thigh. There was a sudden bloom of heat where Sherlock’s cheeks pressed against John’s neck before he lifted his head, avoiding eye contact and turned to stare over John’s shoulder with blushing cheeks and a twisted mouth.
John nodded and wandered to the fridge to fetch the milk but fell into a silence soon after, waiting for the kettle to boil. It was an odd silence, one that tickled up Sherlock’s spine, prompting a squirming fidget. Something was off. Something was teasing the edges of Sherlock’s awareness, promising him clues he was missing, things that needed to be found and addressed. John was hiding something from him.
John smiled back with a nod, “That is the plan,” he said. “Merry Christmas, Ryan.”
“As if you could and as if I’d want that. It would be far too dull, too simple, not ingenious at all,” Sherlock mumbled, tapping his fingers against the armrest.
John chuckled and shook his head, “Sorry, Mrs Hudson,” he said, pressing his brow against Sherlock’s shoulder, his arms still wrapped around Sherlock’s neck.
"He's
. You know, anal... not done that.”
Christmas songs. And never,
gay, Sherlock, so there's no need to worry."
When the kiss ended, Sherlock turned his head away to rest their temples together, breathing heavily, and then turned to suddenly begin dotting John’s face with tender, quivering pecks as if in a trance, “You smell like sick people…” he mumbled casually, as if they weren’t pressed together in the centre of the room, as if wasn’t taking hold of John, cradling his jaw, and turning his head this way and that to expose more skin for him to smear his hot mouth against.

“It’s okay,” John mumbled. “It happens—”
“If I need anything, right now, it’s
“You know, he actually thinks
It only took another moment of that, of staring, of breathing, of being aware of each other and what was being offered, before John’s arm shifted into movement mindlessly and he hooked his thumb into the waistband of his bottoms, bowing them down enough for his cock to bob free, rigid and dusky in the gloom, sensitive head tingling in the cooler air. It felt stupidly good. Filthily good. He knew he shouldn’t be doing this, knew that there were reasons to stop, to cover back up, to push Sherlock away and out, but he was vibrating, was hot, was still half asleep, and so did nothing to stop it, to pause his fingers from taking himself at the base to lift the thick line of himself towards Sherlock’s parting lips. Wanting it and perhaps foolishly accepting it. All rational thought smothered by arousal.
“No, no,” Sherlock told him, grabbing for John’s wrist to gently redirect him. “I
Greg took another handful of messy, errant curls for a momentary tug and smiled, “Oh hush up,” he replied and covered Sherlock’s snarling mouth with his other hand. He received a sharp glare for his trouble, but Sherlock didn’t fight him, merely began breathing hard through his nose. “You patently liked what was being said. Don’t you want to give some of it a try? - Edging is different with company. Probably more enjoyable.”
“Yes, you
“Go on,” John encouraged reflexively, “keep going. Christ, look at you.”
Growling, John stood and grabbed the lube again, soaking Sherlock in it and reaching for a condom without preamble. His thick, tight, rigid cock was red-tipped and swollen, leaking in broken, jingling, translucent strings that coated the inside of the condom as he slipped it on and gave himself a few tugs to ease the ache. He lined up, pushing the very tip inside the twitching, open, hungrily clinging body and held it, letting Sherlock become accustomed to the stretch, even as he reached for Sherlock's arms and pulled them backwards to hold tightly behind his back, forcing Sherlock to re-balance himself on his own two feet.
John let out some sort of grunted reply, knowing he was being mocked, being teased, and allowing it, giving Sherlock the time to be bold, to be confident, to be cocky. He liked it. If he was honest with himself, if he let himself admit it, he could say he even adored it. Adored how sure Sherlock could be, how haughty. How poised and unruffled and dominant he liked to play, liked to pretentiously parade it around for all to see, for him to use when he sought fit. He adored all of it because now he knew he could replace it, could remove it, could shuck that part of him for a more primal, more submissive and needy part. John remembered how Sherlock had looked, had moved, when he’d gripped his hair, sucked his cock, thrust up against him. He was sure he would never forget it.
John took his hand back with a squinting look of distrust, leaning in closer to Sherlock and moving to step up behind him, using him as a makeshift shield in case the pecking began, “It is good though. You saving her. It's...
! Of course he did! - I didn't force him to rub his

than enough for you to go on.”
. Tell me I can?”
“Oh-ho!
Sherlock blinked languidly, gaze unfocused until he glanced down and gave a complaining grunt, “Made a mess of the bed,” he slurred, voice raspy. He looked at John, then at Greg, cheeks flushing anew, though he tried to ignore it and be stern. It was an utter failure on his part. “That’s your fault.
“Yes. Yes, why not,” Sherlock replied, trying not to check himself in the mirror again as he went to John’s side.
“She’d like that,” John said. His smile was soft, features relaxed, eyes focused and alert when he looked at Sherlock. “I’m going to wash, change and get Mrs Hudson’s present.”
“All right, Mrs Hudson!” Sherlock shouted back at her with a brief glare, wanting the moment between John and himself to last as long as possible.
John opened his mouth to call back but paused, glanced back to Sherlock's bedroom, at the lack of movement, and silently went back, glaring even as he leaned over and gave Sherlock's lips a hot, sweet kiss, tapping his leg, “

“Seems like it tonight,” Greg muttered, eyes jumping towards Sherlock’s room as an echoing sigh of agitated dissatisfaction rattled from within. “Impatient bugger.”
“You don't need to explain. It's alright, okay?” Santa soothed, reaching to give a friendly stroke of John's knuckles and signal to the glass. “Drink some more water,”
"Stop what?" John asked, tilting his head and giving a thoughtful hum, eyes not leaving Sherlock’s face. "I bet they're
Opening the freezer, Sherlock bent down to open one shelf, then another, before finally finding the tub of vanilla ice cream, annoyed with how often Mrs Hudson changed its location, “Here,” he said, plopping it down and shutting the freezer door. “And here is that brandy butter.”
“Time to get up, Sherlock.”
“You’re doing this on purpose,” Sherlock griped, bending to take the stick, amused at how bare it now was, and threw it ahead of them.
John laughed, bright and full of energy, and pulled Sherlock, twisting him with strong arms, so he could hold Sherlock properly. Sherlock’s head held protectively against his shoulder as his arms held him close to his chest. Despite what might have been an embarrassing cradling, it was glorious. He never wanted to leave, to get up and move. It felt right, perfect, to be clutched so near to John, surrounded by his heat and smell, face pushed into the soft, pleasant weave of his jumper. Sherlock was extremely thankful that John had opted to wear it. It did nothing to irritate his sensitive skin like some of the others had when he’d held them up to his cheek whilst John had been at work.

“Not at all. I’d prefer it, in fact,” Sherlock answered, cheeks pinked and eyes flitting over John’s face, pupils dilating.
use Christmas as an excuse. Of course I can. It's the
immature, you do realise that, don’t you?”
Blinking rapidly, everything but John’s face blurring at the edges, Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from gawking at him, mind sluggish but still whirling. How had he not seen this coming? How had he been so blind to this? John had sneaked off to visit this dog, to pick out this dog, and Sherlock had known nothing. Absolutely nothing. He could recall noticing dog hair only once, though John had been to the park, had walked through it on his way back from a night out with friends, smelling of booze and smoke and sweat and cheap cologne.
“Mm - He can’t help wanting to chase the bikes, you know,” Sherlock said, giving Orion some more attention before forcing himself to straighten up and continue on, keeping the pup as close to him as he could, wary of other people, though allowing Orion to greet any new dog that happened by. “It’s all instinct. Like licking, the wagging of a tail, the sniffing of rears, the urge to herd and guard, and which direction he’ll defecate in.” John let loose another chuckle, sliding Sherlock an odd look, and Sherlock gave a lopsided grin in reply. “Apparently there was a study on it. Dogs align with Earth's magnetic field when they're relieving themselves. In a north-south position. Clearly they had nothing better to do that day.”
," Greg snapped back and opened the door, ushering them inside with a sharp gesture.
"If you'd like," John said with a soft smile.
John slowly glanced up at Sherlock from behind his book and frowned, hating how easily, how quickly, how automatically his skin flushed at the connotations that the small utterance had invoked. Sherlock was wearing his blue dressing gown and not much else, because of course not, and although he was faintly scowling with a petulant pout, as if he were in one of his childish moods, he had his arms spread out to his sides in eager invitation, fingers wiggling the more John stared, doing nothing. As always with Sherlock, things just sometimes came out of nowhere, just appeared or started, and he’d look at John as if he should know why.
“It’s perhaps a
silk!”
,” he husked and slotted their mouths together, kissing John with wild abandon, tongue pushing against and then through the seam of his lips. It was angry, was wanting, and he didn't relent, didn't give John the chance to flee, only held on with a bruising grasp, quaking bodily.
John froze, looking up at his friend in shock and a growing horror, "You...
Sherlock’s face tightened and though he was still out of breath, still not composed, everything about him became distant, “You… said that you
“Mm. I spent a little time around some chiropractors once,” Sherlock mumbled offhandedly, smoothing his palms up the entire length of John’s back, rubbing at the muscles there. “I can’t do much. But I picked up a few things. It’s an interesting treatment. Not a conventionally medical treatment, but, you do need to have an

Sherlock shivered and turned to look at him, “I… I

“But you decided to keep hold of the information you did have, just in case.”
Sherlock sighed, unable to deny it, “But I

“Uh, no. No it’s not, I suppose, but… it's a bit much don’t you think, Mrs Hudson?” John questioned, trying to say it as kindly as he could manage through his simmering frustrations brought on by the day. “Surely we don’t need this many of them?”

and I knew that you’d take me up on the flat share, that you’d come with me to a crime scene, that you’d rid yourself of your limp during, and that you would be of a big help to me.” He waved his hand and gave a loose, casual unconcerned shrug. “Yes, I didn’t know Mike would bring you to me, and yes there was a small chance you would have not turned up at the flat at all, and yes you did surprise me,

A cough from the front of the car brought his words to an abrupt end and they turned to the driver who was looking back at them in the mirror, “We’ve arrived.”

nice?” Sherlock asked, pushing for something extra and adding a bit more pressure on John’s back, enough for an audible few cracks. Cracks that echoed throughout John’s body, his head, and throbbed in the tips of his fingers and toes with a downpour of tingling pleasure. Pushing again, Sherlock shifted, felt around John's ribs and then waited for John to breathe out before pushing for another orchestra of popping cracks. "I deserve at least an
Greg snorted, eyebrows shooting up, “For someone who forgoes sleep frequently, that’s such a strange thing to hear coming out of your mouth,” he teased pulling Sherlock’s wrists down to eye the cuffs and look towards the drawers they came out of for the key, fingertips stroking tantalisingly up into his palms. The reaction to the tickling gesture was immediate and John watched Sherlock’s eyes get heavier with the urge to sleep. “He needs a drink though, John. Ignore his idiocy. He’s covered in sweat and must be extremely dehydrated—
“Surprising you is

“I hope we’ll get copies,” John said, moving out from Sherlock’s hair to kiss his cheek (just in time for another photo). It felt good, leaving his skin fizzing from the contact, and Sherlock wondered if it would feel the same way on other places, if each new kiss on a new area would continue to excite and stun him.
“So you
“Surprisingly so,” John admitted with a sigh and nod, wincing at the acceptance. “They're... supportive too. More than they have any right to be.”
As if he’d been gagging for an order, for something to follow, Sherlock did as he was told, grasping at himself, stroking harder, faster, in a maddening need, leg muscles contracting so hard that they sprang out from their crossed position. He scrambled at the coffee table with his toes, knocking several rolls of ribbon onto the floor. They span off, leaving a road of fabric behind them, and John gave his hair a small tug in reprimand, leaning in with a shaky breath to peer down the length of his torso, playing with the short dark hairs of his crotch. He was as close to Sherlock’s erection that he would let himself get. Could feel the heat coming off him. Could even smell his musk in the air.
“Alright, alright,” John placated quickly, reaching for Sherlock's arm and flinching when Sherlock pulled away with a scoff, shifting his stance, hands going on his hips. “We can take them down, okay? I'll help you take them down.”
Sherlock blinked at John’s tone, taking a step backward, and adjusted his scarf, “Um. Right...” he mumbled. He went silent after that for so long that John felt his eye twitch, his face heat, and twirled to find a taxi, to walk away, to just

“If anything, my coming here, is good for everyone involved. This way I won’t shoot at the walls again. Or dismantle the kettle. Or reorganise the objects in the living room according to size, colour, and use...or smoke the entire box of cigarettes that are hidden in the Bison skull...”
John’s face was almost curiously blank, but he could see a hint of anticipation in the way his fingers twitched, “Back then?”

!” he snapped seconds later, pushing past and yanking down the mistletoe that had been above them as he went, leaving John swaying in his doorway, the echoing tingle of Sherlock’s soft, warm, moist mouth still radiating through him.
Greg took several minutes to debate such a thing silently with himself, to mull it over in his mind, and looked over John’s shoulder at another utterance of frustration from Sherlock, grimacing for a brief second before he nodded, “In for a penny…” he said in a deep sigh, stroking the skin of John’s knuckles in reassurance, for himself and for John. “I can always leave the room if it gets too weird.”
picture of him, isn’t it? Unfortunately not my doing. - I’m not sure
“Yeah, just here…” John nodded, shuffling into a better position to thrust his fingers in and out faster, stretching them, scissoring them and occasionally prodding at Sherlock's prostate, “I… I'm imagining
Enthusiastic, Sherlock nodded and let himself be rolled onto his side, his legs positioned, breathing heavily, “

. This… this
Nodding, Sherlock let out a large, deep sigh of relief, “Much,” he replied in a rush of breath. “Yes. So very much.
Holding both of Sherlock's wrists tightly at the small of his back with one hand, John used his other hand to grab Sherlock's hip, then his rib and finally his hair, pulling his head back so he could see the flushed and panting face, upturned at the ceiling, "God... yeah, look at you. So dazed. So... so fucking out of control!" he grunted. It was all possibly the most reckless, stupidest thing that John had ever done, and it felt incredible. He felt as though he were intoxicated, delirious, as he vehemently thrust hard and deep. Losing himself to the slapping of their sweat-sheen skin. It was incredibly heady to see Sherlock this way, so human and debauched and needy. “Do you want me to stroke your cock?”
is fine? - All, but
much.”
“I win,” Sherlock gloated as he poured his prizes out onto the table, finding a wooden puzzle and a strange red fortune telling fish. The puzzle looked interesting, if a little basic, and he leaned back with it, taking it apart to put back together again.

wants to talk to me. Either it’s someone trying to kiss my arse on their way to the top or someone from the top beating my arse because they get off on the power they hold. There is scarcely an in-between.”
Sherlock blinked, nose crinkling in confusion, “
John had approached while he was distracted and put his hand on his shoulder, almost making him jump out of surprise, “Of course, that’s all up to you,” he said. “You’ll be his main carer after all.”
Greg blinked at him for a minute, then another, his dark expression fading, “Thank you... I think?”
A leisurely nod and a murmured “Mmmmm,” rumbled off the walls as Sherlock repeated the movement, and John glanced down watching as Sherlock’s abdominals clenched and flexed as his hips rocked back and forth.
"I'm... I'm not alarmed."
“...Ah. Uh. Yes,” Sherlock wheezed, mind tilting and scrambling to record, to store, every detail, every shift of John’s fingers, hands, arms, and head.
"Worried?" John suggested in a muffled reply.
“It’s from
. They don't want to kill you, just want to sing jaunty songs.”
Humming, moving to half slump over him, Sherlock reached down to undo his trousers, getting his hands wet, “Do you want to taste
“Oh I know that one already,” Sherlock dismissed with a smug grin, fingers stroking and rubbing and squeezing at the base of John’s cock, angling him to better smear the head along the top of his opening mouth.
Greg smiled.
"Like corner shops?" John asked, stopping when Orion circled them and held the stick out for Sherlock, yipping and jumping and whimpering.
John smirked in reply and picked up his own plate of toast, “Should we set up the basket in the living room then?”
!” he shouted, mouth only inches from Sherlock's red and flushed face.
"Oh, shut it!" John hissed, shuffling his hips backwards when Sherlock continued to tug and stretch with emphasis, a motion that only served to cause more pain, more humiliation, as the waistband slapped against his stomach weakly. “They
Sherlock strode off, grabbed some kitchen towels and returned to wipe his back clear, before sitting down beside him, drawing his dressing gown around him, and kissing his cheek, "
“...Well,
“Or," Sherlock murmured with a sharp, huffing sigh, dropping his arms to point at him with a playful wink, still pouting, "I can unwrap you? -
close.”
. You'd not murder me. You can't. Not now. - You'd be lost without me,” John whispered, feeling his body heat as they stared at one another, as Sherlock altered his posture and rubbed a bit too slow to be anything else but deliberate. He exhaled quietly and swallowed, unsure exactly on what to do and how to respond. There was an itch, an urge, but he wasn't confident enough to give in to it. “What about if I sing another song then? You could even accompany me on the violin? Give in a little... give in to, uh, that Christmas spirit.”
“You really
“Well I got the best Christmas ever,” John said as he collected the bowls. “I’ll call a taxi in a few minutes.” As he headed towards the kitchen he planted a kiss on Sherlock’s head and gave his shoulder a comforting squeeze. The touches zipped and sparkled through him like fireworks. Sherlock couldn’t help watching him leave, stupidly pining for him regardless of the short distance.
?” John asked in puzzlement, taking another drink, then another, and another, until everything came snapping back into place and he remembered, remembered that it was Sherlock's alias. “Oh!
“Was just a peck. Nothing special,” John replied dismissively, waving it away, feeling amused and flattered by Sherlock's grouchiness, his jealousy. Was it jealousy? Had it always been jealousy? Was it just an attention thing? Did he just not want John to be distracted and pulled away again, or was there more? “Nothing to worry about.”
, that’s all. - Considering you two are no longer dating and have therefore resumed a working relationship instead of a romantic one. Aren't really meant to kiss co-workers. Nor date them, now we're on the subject--”
certain that it would be overcast but nothing more!” he groused, pitching his voice low and mimicking Sherlock as best he could. “John, don’t be an idiot, I’ve calculated the spot, exactly! All we need to do is walk five miles through swampy, muddy, poo-covered fields. Better leave the car on the side of the road. We won’t need that. We surely won’t get lost or caught out in the worst downpour since records began!”
“Oh...” Santa muttered and shuffled awkwardly, coughing. Looking into his drink in thought. “And did – did he want
John hummed and rose steadily to his feet, stuffing his wallet in his pocket before wandering slowly over to Sherlock again, “A good distraction?”
and you need to try and fix that.”
“...There are times I don’t precisely know if you are being sarcastic or not—It’s
“I suppose that makes some sort of sense,” Greg mumbled with a grin, eyeing Sherlock’s naked body for a moment or two longer than necessary. “Right. I’ll… get undressed then.” With a nod, another ruffle of Sherlock’s curls, and a rather boyish glance through his lashes, Greg got undressed without much timidness. He folded up his clothes atop one of the drawers and strolled over to the window in his socks, pants and vest to draw the curtains closed. “Are you sure this won’t be awkward if I decide I don’t want this with you two? - Well, I mean, I want
“It’s suppose good that he’s heard, and been around, other dogs,” Sherlock murmured as Orion began to strain at the lead, sniffing toward a huddled couple who were walking their way. One of them was a cancer survivor. “Socialisation is important. I would be a little worried if he hadn’t had
“Jam,” Sherlock intoned, focusing on a tucked up spider in the far right corner. It had spun itself a small web in its hidey hole and had settled quite happily, legs poking out only a little as it laid in wait for a meal on wings to pass it by.
“Better?” he asked seriously, making sure Sherlock was too far gone into his observations as he held Sherlock's hands against his torso, distracting him with the feeling warmth and juddering muscles.
, Mrs Hudson,” he told her, giving her a quick, appreciated grin as he heaped his fork with more, feeling abruptly ravenous.
? Well...all right. I suppose a dog is worth more than one gift in return,” he said, not knowing how he should feel about the change nor the question. Had he said it wrong? Was the hint too vague? Was he wrong? Shoving the tinsel back into place, Sherlock tried to find something to occupy his hands with, something to distract him from the awkward, twisting disappointment, and clutched his hands behind his back. “A laptop and what else?”
“Yes, obviously—Though not in front of Orion.”
“Say it how we want you to say it,” Greg cut in with a tut and a fisting tug of Sherlock’s hair, arching his head further back against the pillow.
“They are essential for
," John said, setting the bag down so he could hold Sherlock's hand with both of his.
John turned back to him, but he kept the biscuit hidden behind his back, his lips cocked in a mischievous manner, “It might.”
John frowned back at him in honest confusion, “You don’t have to get me anything,” he said, “but, if you feel like you have to, you can get me something later.”
Sherlock frowned, “Violin?” he echoed, before realisation caught up with him and he turned, flustered and hot under the collar. “Right.
“Not going to show him? Really? - Well, it’s up to you, of course, but… either you show him
he talks about.”
John, meanwhile, kept a tight hold of his hand, even when they started getting sweaty, his face set in a relaxed smile as they walked down the streets of London. He smiled brighter occasionally, usually at Orion when he did something John considered funny, but every so often it would just blossom without any obvious reason, followed by a firm squeeze to Sherlock's fingers.
Frowning, Sherlock glared at the puzzle in his hands, not exactly pleased he was bring so easy to read, though Mrs Hudson had always been one to see things about him others didn’t, “Things haven’t changed
“Not until your birthday, young man,” she said as she entered the room. He could just hear John using the phone, but he kept his voice low so Sherlock couldn’t hear what he was saying.
Sherlock shifted, hating how that made him feel, and alternated to hunch over the table, taking several more mouthfuls of pudding, brandy butter, custard and melting ice cream. He was excited, yet terrified. He was overjoyed, yet utterly guilt-ridden. It was the best present, the best surprise, and yet he still felt uneasy with meeting the puppy. John sent him that worried gaze that seemed to have been making too many appearances today but continued to eat his dessert, though there wasn’t much left.

“Ditto,” Sherlock breathed, finding his chest heaving and his head dizzy.
? You were the one stalling,” Sherlock retorted a little sharply. “Clearly
With a slightly sharp intake of breath, Sherlock turned his head to John, then glanced at the receptionist, at the papers laid out, the dulled computer screen not properly twisted at the correct angle, and nodded, “Yes,” he told John. “I’m here.”
John looked back at him with a smile, a limp reminiscent of the day they met making him stumble into the door frame slightly, “Would you like to cut the duck?”
“But they

answer, or don’t want to, then there is a forfeit…”
Using both hands to steady himself and shooting the man a wonky, drunken smile, John nodded knowingly, slanted towards him, and reached out to poke his arm, “I know who y'are...” John announced through his drunken slur, fighting with his disobeying mouth to talk properly, to talk with purpose, and giving a narrowed unfocused ogle, “I can see through your
! I know I don't have to but… I don't know, Christ, I don't know what I'm babbling about,” John sighed and turned his head slightly to shyly peek back at Sherlock, knowing his face was red, knowing how eager he must look. “Would you... kiss me? Just a little?”
“Well, I...I’m not saying
"Yeah," the DI replied and closed the door behind them. "How do you put up with him?" He sent Sherlock an annoyed glare.
John groaned, “Oh… well,
Greg blinked out of his daze, nose and mouth pressing into the side of Sherlock’s angled head, “Me? Won’t he want you to do it?” he asked over Sherlock’s boisterous keening, adjusting his hold with a hand skimming the moisture he’d left behind. Sherlock arched into it as much as he could and groaned desperately, eyes rolling up and muscles giving their familiar tightening around John’s fingers. He looked out of it. Succumbed to the building spike and twisting ache of his nearing climax. “You and he--”
“You’re

“Do you feel that it's demoralising with me?” John asked nervously, bracing himself, “because I

Sherlock’s forehead furrowed in frowning disbelief, “Gamble?” he repeated with an amused puff of air from his nose. “With

“No,” Sherlock rumbled, body relaxed but muscles still twitching. “
Santa shook his head in bewilderment and raised an eyebrow, “So she killed loads of people so, what? She'd make more sales as a writer?”
, would you?” Sherlock scoffed. “It’s similar to when you have a cold and you continually sniff, sometimes without really knowing how much, without realising how
“It’s not a necessity,” Sherlock said around a small moan, one of his legs bending at the knee to flop aside to give more access. “I just have been thinking about it.
because… you were loud… and so I thought you… and then you just…” Motioning vaguely, ridiculously and clumsily with his hands in his stammering explanation, Sherlock finally groaned in defeat and held up his arms, palms showing in placation. “This is all rather new to me. This… reaction to you
!” he told him through another snort of laughter, trying to keep his face neutral. “You’re being
“What persona?” John barked, feeling the anger surging again, his emotions all jumbled.
…” A few tears escaped, glinting in the low light as they clung to his lashes, then fell, rolling down his cheeks to dangle and slip from his chin to paint his chest with a shimmer. "Always."
“It's just odd...” John muttered, letting his head fall back slightly, feeling his want for him, need, desire building. Each touch sent him spinning down the never-ending whirlpool of impure lust. “Still... um... still new and...
John ducked his head, face quickly aflame, and nodded, feeling his heart jolt and cock twitch, “Uh. Yeah. Thank you. It's good, yeah. - Though it still does feel a bit weird to have your face on my dick though... not sure I'll get used to that, no matter how often it happens...”
.” With that said, as slowly and condescendingly as humanly possible, he extend a hand, palm upwards. “
Sherlock suddenly shuffled around somewhere to his side, a heat of presence that slithered just inches from his arm, and so John let Greg’s waist go to reach for him, petting what he could of the man’s bunched duvet to appease the constant need for attention he forever harboured. His focus was mainly on Greg, on the open-mouthed, utterly filthy kiss, on sucking Greg’s bottom lip into his mouth with a soft moan, but he knew better than to ignore Sherlock completely.
John remained cockily silent as Sherlock pulled out two pieces of card that were sandwiching several pieces of paper. The first that caught his eye was a photo of a dog, a German Shepherd in fact, a puppy who couldn’t have been more than six months old. He wasn’t entirely sure why there was a photo of a dog in this supposed ‘present’, but John remained in a more palpably excited silence when Sherlock glanced up at him in askance. There were also several sheets of paper with numbers written on the back, and so Sherlock opened the one labelled ‘1’.
Shocked by the third kiss, Sherlock tripped after him as if dragged by an invisible thread, “Yes,” he wheezed, following John down the stairs, trying to stay as close as physically possible to him.
?” Sherlock repeated dazedly, confused, but aroused, knowing John could feel how hard his heart was pumping, how fast, and how much his overall temperature had increased. “You mean that...that you...”
Sherlock huffed shakily, trying to ineffectively smother a wanton, grunt of desire, “I... I’ve been in your room while you were dreaming before. My presence

Sherlock lifted his head, slapped a hand over his mouth, stared at John, and shook his head in fond amusement, “

that's the problem,” John replied and then winced. “No, not problem... not exactly. It's –
“Yes,” Sherlock told her shortly, before turning and touching the side of her face, then her shoulder. “Thank you.”
Groaning, John shook his head and leaned forward against the bar, “
with anything again. What the hell?! What was he thinking? To do that in front of Sherlock...
Rolling his eyes, Sherlock hummed, “Perhaps we should eat together Boxing Day too? It would be...pleasurable.”
It started small: Sherlock leaving the shower, after a truly excessive amount of time, without fussing with his abundance of hair products, making his normally pristine, smooth curls go adorably fluffy and wild. Next came the hours of brooding, stoic, almost lifeless silence. The visible stiff tension in his shoulders and spine. A reoccurring retreat into his own mind, with only the occasional anxiety-laden heavy breath to show he was even still conscious and alert.
John frowned and shook his head, "Are we... talking about the case?"
…” John replied, feeling ridiculous kneeling over Sherlock, still holding himself. “And I… I’m… it’s just…
." Sherlock could see the corner of John's lips rising. Lips he was going to be dreaming and fantasising about.
to kiss him and yet…” Throwing his arms up, Sherlock turned from her, looking back over at John and pacing, brushing crumbs from his mouth as he turned back to his landlady. “This could be a replacement, you know. He could be giving me a dog so it’s easier for him to leave later on. It’s

like dominant Greg,” John chuckled, a raging bubble of arousal churning erratically in his gut from the display and the reaction. It wasn’t a shocking revelation, as John knew what Sherlock liked, what he wanted, what he positively responded to, but he hadn’t seen it from the outside. He liked it. He wanted to see more from the new perspective. “Discipline him because I'm too bloody soft half the time.”
many, Mrs Hudson?” he asked lowly, while secretly wanting more. The more the better. He wanted every second of their new relationship to be documented, tangibly. He wanted to fill the wing in his Mind Palace with it all.
good,” he said, clearing his throat and taking a gulp of wine. “I’ve quite enjoyed it.”
a moron‽
Suddenly enthusiastic and more than a little impressed, Sherlock reached for the letter opener, slicing the envelope with a put on irritated sigh, “What if I don’t want or like it? - Who
, doesn't it?"
“Sometimes I do—But that’s
people. I knew the man who raised her and I know the woman I’m going to give her to. - She won’t be killed for meat. She will live and die a free turkey… more or less free.”
“… He likes you, you know. Always has, I reckon,” John said softly, looking down at him and stroking a lock of hair from his forehead, “He doesn't trust many people, especially not with something so
haven’t you said anything to him?”
“Teasing and long? Or quick and dirty?” he questioned, the rough tinge of his voice already apparent.
The song circled in his head, playing on a loop, and he washed to the beat of it, scrubbing utensils and cutlery and sharp glinting knives. Some of the knives, the implements, weren't made for making or eating food, but John washed them anyway, trying not to cut himself on the dangerous edge of an already bloodied scalpel. It didn't bother him much anymore. He always washed everything with a few dabs of bleach and he'd seen the array of items that Sherlock had to play with, items that were either borrowed or bought through elusive contacts. They were professional and expensive and wholly unneeded in John's opinion. What would Sherlock need a Beavertail burnisher? More to the point, how did John know what one of those were on sight now?
The show drove John wild, evoking a few inelegant fumbles and a torn zip, but soon he was bare and showing himself proudly to Greg’s widening eyes. His cock was thick and hard, drooping heavily between his thighs, and he knew what he must look like. Though there was a wincing, embarrassed part of him that was self-conscious and unsure of the sudden leap, another part of him was preening over the attention and response he’d already gathered with his nakedness, and glad that he’d recently groomed for an impactful impression. He was exposed, completely nude, in front of someone he’d not to long ago only seen as a friend. It felt like the pool situation all over again, only with more bodies and less pawing.
,” Sherlock told him, turning and crossing his legs to, a wonky, tight smile coming over him as he looked back at John, his cheeks very darkly flushed. “So, white whine with Thai. Good. Perfect.”
. I still get something out of it. - I, um, enjoy the activity and although he’s usually pretty dazed afterwards, he likes and prompts me to straddle him and…” He blushed a little bit, unsure if further information was really needed at this point. “Anyway, I get something out of it and it’s good for him. It’s forced him into a routine where he actually sleeps now. For at
“… No. No, you’re not allowed to come yet,” he told a panting, bucking Sherlock. Surprised at the words coming out of his mouth, but only briefly. Sherlock distracted him with an almost feral gnashing of his teeth and a honey-thick groan. “
,” John moaned, digging his fingers into Sherlock's trapezius muscle. “Keep talking like that and it might not take long until you get your wish...”  Moving one hand, John cupped and stroked Sherlock's cheek, letting his thumb run across Sherlock's lip, before groaning when Sherlock took the digit into his mouth and gave that a suck. "
“What sort of forfeit are you suggesting?” John asked nervously. “Nothing illegal or that can have me struck off as a doctor, I hope?”
“You’re exaggerating,” Sherlock groused around a mouthful of pudding, ice cream and custard.
. - And the whole point to this was to give you some pleasure. To... banish that mood of yours and—”
, whether she has clean feet or not. It'll be just our luck we end up with bird flu,” John griped, putting a bunch of bananas on the side, as far away from the turkey as possible. “So… what
“Need more custard,” Sherlock told her and reached for the jug, pouring a large gush of it over his remaining piece of pudding.
“Yes,” Sherlock snorted, feeling mortified for his slip up all over again, even if he also shuddered at the memory of it. He wasn’t going to forget the first touch of their mouths. It was embedded in his mind. Carved in, deep and everlasting.
Pulling back, Sherlock shot John a smile, “Of course,” he told him, stepping away and gathering the dog papers to put neatly on the mantel. He chose the space near the skull and then gave the hat covered cranium a pat.
… that wasn't
? - It was her backup plan! Her moneymaker!”
“I thought you checked the bloody forecast? You
John couldn't help but grin, “Yeah, Just so happen to be tucking my shirt in when she walks into a room, give her a peek of your hair and eyes along under the elf hat,” he snorted, feeling himself blush, feeling something stir within him. Having Sherlock so close made him high on arousal. “It's
to get the perfect picture!” Mrs Hudson argued and took one more when John started to laugh.
Stretching up, Sherlock snatched at it with a smile, “
John sighed and shook his head in sweet compassion, “My poor thing,” he whispered, slowly running his knuckles under the soft waistband of Sherlock's pyjamas and feeling a thick, all-consuming pulse of excitement as he admired the miles of perfect, bare skin before him. Then more still when he pushed the trousers down narrow hips and muscled thighs, until he was freeing Sherlock's flaccid cock.
“I thought you didn't
, John! - He told me you seemed a bit out of it. That you looked feverish and overworked. Now I know why!” he said. “You kinky sod!”
“Duck is much juicier,” Mrs Hudson said. “Do you think I should save some for Orion?”
“Don’t you mean ‘
John nodded and cautiously approached Sherlock, still a little bit nervous as he reached his hand out ever so gently toward the bird, “Will it – sorry,
When he was finally done, as he was just drying the last plate to be put away in the open cupboard nearby, Sherlock appeared from the ether and slid against his back, looming over his shoulder and slapping his hand over John's partly open mouth, snarling lowly in annoyance, “If you continue to sing that
Sherlock’s eyes flitted over him and he sighed in aggravation, “We
Greg gave a throaty chuckle in reply, eyeing the lump of duvet that was Sherlock up and down, a lump which was now slumping back into the sofa sullenly, “Yeah. Not surprised by that. I knew he would be. All that dancing and running and

Shimmying down, he winced a little when his own stiff cock was bent awkwardly against his stomach but soon forgot the slight inconvenience when he reached his destination and eyed Sherlock's pretty shaft. He was a grower, sitting un-intimidating, soft, and inoffensive against the darkness of Sherlock's pubic hair. John swallowed the saliva that had pooled in his mouth at the sight, at what was to come, and gently pecked a tiny kiss to Sherlock's pelvis before he began to litter the short length of him.
Humming, amused and resolute, Greg reached to grasp a handful of curls, tugging enough to cause a soft, curious hiss, “Watch the attitude.”

“No, I can’t say.”
"I'm sure most shut anyway. At least for some of the day anyway."
, you know what I mean!”
“You…

Just what suited. - I know it’s a few days late but… our days are always hectic this time of year.” Sarah shifted to stand closer to him when he looked the gift over, the grin on her face never faltering, her hands cradled innocently at her front. John narrowed his eyes on her. "Plus, you know, you're always off doing something or act so stand-offish that I decide it's better to leave you be."
Thoughts of a relaxing late evening pulling him onwards, Greg made his way up the steps to his front door and let himself in.

“Then say it.”
“Ah, so as much as we gossip about you then,” John chuckled and Mrs Hudson pulled away to whop John on the arm.
"Just one, thank you," the landlady said, and he dutifully complied before setting two in his own bowl.

"Sure," John said and picked up the bag as he rose to his feet, fingers still entwined with Sherlock's.
“I doubt they’ll be open today,” John said as Orion bounded off. “Most places are closed on Christmas Day after all.”
“Is that so?” Santa mumbled, tilting his head after a moment and giving John a soft, interested smile. “Who
“What?
“My jeans need to come off, definitely, and your trousers too, I think,” John muttered as he reached a hand down to tug at where they plastered wetly to his skin, grimacing. “But my socks are fine. Shockingly, I had enough foresight to wear my boots…you on the other hand, knew exactly where we were going, but wore your stupid posh shoes.”
Shaking, John pushed his abruptly quivering hands through his hair and twisted to face Santa a little better, tipping with the drunken angle of the room, “Do you see
stop being a friend to you.”
“If it’s not the right size, I still have the receipt,” Mrs Hudson said.
Sherlock shrugged and looked playfully blank faced, “Don’t think I do.”
Sherlock hummed huskily, “Mixture of bad and good then, this spot in specific?” he asked, working on it with more determination. "Right... here... is it? Just
you with a gift.”
“They want to torture me slowly with their out of tune Christmas melodies!” Sherlock exclaimed and dramatically twirled away, storming to slump down low in his chair. “I am
John rummaged in his pile of clothes, leaving Greg to dab at Sherlock’s tacky abdomen and elegant ribs, and grabbed for his pants, pulling them back on. Sherlock was lightly snoring, lips parted and fingers twitching, lost to his thoughts or a beginning of a dream. John smiled warmly, overcome with affection, and knelt on the bed nearby to regain possession of the flannel, sliding it over the skin of Sherlock's sides, stomach and chest, using a corner of the cloth to wipe his chin and face. Greg regarded him the whole while, keeping Sherlock still and turning him, adjusting him, if John had to chase the wonky path some streaks of come had taken.
“I can do the dishes, don’t you worry,” Mrs Hudson said, and soon enough the landlady appeared by his side carrying their empty plates. She set them on the side and reached into a cupboard for their bowls. “… Are you alright dear?”

.” An amused, playful, cheeky grin spread across his face as they looked at each other, both of them struggling to contain bubbling giggles. “

you want it in your mouth?”
!—You need a bell around that neck of yours!” John muttered through his teeth, heart thundering at more than just Sherlock's sudden appearance as he moved away from him and turned around, giving the pyjama wearing fiend a glare through his eyebrows. “Would suit you down to the ground. What with you sneaking around like a bloody cat all the time. - Do you purposefully quieten your footsteps? Prowl around on your tiptoes? Or do you float?”
,” she said cheerfully, handing him a Christmas wrapped package, smiling reindeer flying across a dark blue, star speckled sky. There was also a tag, with his name scrawled on it and several penned kisses, a small message on the other side as he flipped it over to read. It was a short note, one that seemed overly casual in the most sceptical way.  “You’re a hard person to buy for, Dr Watson - Thankfully I had some help from that
– and haven't – It's
. Made everything feel
John hummed and turned to his own meal and the three of them fell into silence, broken only by the clattering of cutlery against plates and their glasses being occasionally picked up and set down on the table cloth.
Sherlock’s cheeks got even redder, “You’ve done the former only once and you’re not very talented with the latter, therefore neither are scream-worthy,” he shot back.
, I feel like I've been thawed from a
! Yes, that’s—
you,” Sherlock told him smugly, happy by the statement John had provided. He already knew that he impressed John, on many occasion, as John wasn’t exactly subtle in his opinions, but to hear that he was impressed approximately all the time was quite an honour.
John glanced over at Sherlock, took in his disheveled appearance, and flushed cheeks, and leaned toward him, “You’re not helping.”
this game,” Sherlock seethed, tapping his foot angrily against the rug and clenching his toes. “Fine. Ask your stupid, silly, unnecessary, irrelevant, waste of time question.”
He saw John and Mrs Hudson sharing a look from his peripheral, but then John shook his head, scooping up the last of his pudding, “You really outdid yourself, Mrs Hudson,” he said. “Thank you so much for lunch.”
John blinked, “Wait,
"I'm... I'm saying that I'd... I'd be... inclined to have a crack at it, at
John grinned, almost resting into him when he took it, then stood on his toes to kiss Sherlock’s nose, “Come on then,” he said and headed out the door with a giggle.
“If it makes you feel better, I have

boys,” she said softly, pressing her fingers to her lips before turning around, undoubtedly going to fetch her camera.
?” Sherlock blinked at them both, frowning at Mrs Hudson in question, feeling stupid for not realising it sooner.
“I’m excited,” John replied, “and nervous, and a lot of other things.” He took a deep breath and rubbed Sherlock’s hand with his spare. It was grounding and strangely very arousing.
Greg gave Sherlock another look, checking, “And you’re completely okay with him kissing me, right?”
Humming, Santa took a small sip, shoulders shaking as he chuckled, “I see... And is
,” John said, his voice stern and commanding. Like a captain. Orion whined but did stop, licking at Sherlock’s hand instead, eyes locked until the person was completely out of view.
They took their time with it, unveiling John inch by inch. Exposing the difference between them. Allowing Sherlock's widening, yearning eyes to compare the white, paleness of his own skin to the golden coloured hue of John's. Sherlock's downy, barely there scattering of fine, dark hair to the small amount of honey and grey across John's chest and stomach, a wispy path of it leading down to his waistband and beyond. John throw both to one side carelessly once they were off, there would be time for tidying tomorrow, for cleaning and putting things in order, but not now. Never when Sherlock was this vulnerable and touch starved. Was so openly mesmerised. So overcome with the details, the comparison.
“Well,
“Why don’t you open yours, Mrs Hudson?” John asked.
“Though I suppose they have a lot of security in places like that,” John mused, glancing out the window.
of things,” Sherlock snapped and shifted, jaw clenching. “I...have nothing to say to him.”
Sherlock’s heart seized on a mixture of emotions, some of which were too entangled to separate, “I’m quite positive he will eat whatever you give him whether I am eating or not.” John hummed, taking another bite and leaning closer, and Sherlock found he was already in the process of leaning in toward him in response. “Dogs
a replacement.”
Once they stepped into the streets again, John set the bags down and pulled on one of his gloves before picking one of the bags up again, giving Orion a pat on the head and holding his hand out to Sherlock and smiling, “Home then?”
“It’s all right,” Sherlock mumbled nonchalantly, shooting her a small, curling grin and bending to kiss her temple. “Get some mint ice cream in.”
?” John just shrugged in reply and so Sherlock mimicked him in frustration, throwing the stick once more. “Then no thank you.”
John rubbed his eyes then brushed his hand through his hair, “Up we get then,” he said, pulling his leg out from under Sherlock and massaging his muscles. “After I can feel my leg again that is.”
After a day full of work and late grocery shopping, John finally dragged himself inside, fed up and grumpy at the busyness of London this close to Christmas. He hated food shopping as it was, but near Christmas it was worse than any other time. There were always two kinds of people, those who were fretting and rushing to stock up, and those that thought they had all the time in the world, and dealing with either of them in the Christmas season was infuriating. Especially when he was targeted by both in quick succession, their attitudes and annoyances only adding to an already stressed and seething mood. They'd shove past him, cut him off, chat in groups within the aisles, leave their baskets on the floor for him to trip over, pay for everything with vouchers and coupons that made a fifteen minute task take almost an hour, and try and spark up meaningless, circling, tedious conversations with him. Then of course, when he left, they seemed to follow, making it almost impossible for him to find a cab that wasn't packed full. The Tube was no better, an absolute no-go area, with its overcrowding and bustling mass of bodies, all crammed into one space, heading for a smaller one. So all he could do, all he had left, was to straighten his shoulders and walk home. Cursing everything and everyone he had ever met. Hating the day, the season, himself with each and every step.
John blinked twice in astonishment and then stepped back, tugging his hand away from Sherlock's throat with a nervous shake. His cock twitched in response, starting to plump against his left thigh and growing to an almost full erection in such a dizzying rush that John felt slightly woozy. Another shock. Another irritant. Another thing working against him. John blamed it on the raising scent of musk, of the heat between them and not the pent up growing fondness which had been surreptitiously growing wildly between them for months. Something he'd tried to ignore.
John blinked, focus immediately drawn down to the movement and frowned, feeling his face heat, even as he questioned what precisely he had witnessed, “Everything, uh, everything okay?”
to be your friend, John. Always. I won’t let anything ruin that.”
He was clumsy at first, unsure and awkward as he grasped and thumbed the hinge of his jaw, then his touch became sure, steady, and confident. Greg’s fingers slipped down John’s neck, up through his hair, before settling on his shoulders, a hot, comfortable weight. His hands were strong and rough from work, skin and fingernails clean if a bit sticky with beer. John hadn’t noticed them like he had Sherlock’s, though he sure saw them now. Could feel their heat and intent even through his clothes, and was powerless to prevent the shudder that caused.
…” he murmured with a tilting of his head, “a little bit, yes—You wouldn’t have met me if I hadn’t have told Mike I was looking for a flatmate - Therefore I was in control of our meeting via what I chose to expose to Mike and his association with you - And you wouldn’t have accepted my offer if I hadn’t
Once inside the room, John left the other man's side to switch on the bedside lamp and close the curtains. The change to the lighting made it more intimate and private, less strikingly harsh, and with the music still playing in from the living room, the entire environment became softer still, something far more tender. John returned to Sherlock's side, smiling, then reached for his lovingly worn t-shirt to slowly pull off, running his hands up and along Sherlock's soft skin.

"Perhaps we should get her a dog bed for his visits."
,” he huffed around a chuckle and pulled back, nudging Sherlock's chin with his nose. “I won’t try and change my ways then. Not at all. No matter how many times you snarl at me—”
… I can’t breathe for laughing…” He put his hand up for a moment to block out the sight and looked away, trying to calm down and stop, trying to get control of himself. "It's... it's not even that funny. It's
“Alright,” John said as he pressed his cheek further into Sherlock’s. “I can wait.”

has made me crazy. I can’t… I can’t get my head around it—”
“We’ll vacate the room and fight elsewhere,” Sherlock added with some amusement.
John chuckled and tucked into his breakfast with more vigour, “Merry Christmas, Sherlock.”
“Go ahead, Mrs Hudson,” John said, his thumb brushing up and down the back of Sherlock’s hand. It was calming, comforting, and consuming.

your friend?”
In what felt like mere seconds he was roused from the warm, soft slumber with whispers of his name and light kisses on his face, hands rubbing against his arm and fingers, and he groggily opened his eyes to the sight of a recently awakened John smiling at him less than an inch from his nose.
“Mm, Sarah,” John explained, watching him closely while trying not to give anything away. Having Sherlock's hand on him made it hard for him to think. Made everything hard. “Wishing me Merry Christmas in case we don't see one another over the next week or so... which we probably won't.”
Sherlock was stretching for the mistletoe in the centre of the living room, shirt pulling taut as he did so, fingers swatting, skimming and then pulling at it to bring it down, the rest of the now removed mistletoe in his other hand within an ungainly bundle, “I blame
Humming throatily, toes clenching into the rug as he pressed a bit into the caress, Sherlock closed his abruptly rolling eyes, eyelids fluttering, “Yes…” he husked, mouth opening in evident pleasure. "Helped... helped them with some fraudulent issues... stepson was... taking—"

John felt a pang of sympathy and gave him a firm, apologetic smile, “I'm really sorry mate, truly. You deserve more than you're getting at the moment.”

"You need the sugar with all that energy you burn," Mrs Hudson said. "You don't eat enough."
“Don’t you
reasons I wanted to strip you naked and touch you," Sherlock griped.
There were no presents at least. The table under the tree only had a plate of half-finished biscuits, which Sherlock had been making his way through for the past few hours before the sun rose, and their usual mess of laptops, papers and used mugs. John was awake now – he could hear him wandering around in his room upstairs – and already making his way down to the kitchen. He hadn't bothered to change this morning then.

Greg shrugged and pulled a fork out of mess that was his cutlery drawer, “Why don’t you ask

John stiffened, his eyes growing wide in shock, his back straight, his arms held to attention at his sides as he inhaled suddenly through his nose. His lips were pliant but unmoving. He wasn’t kissing back. Sherlock was kissing him and he wasn’t kissing back. Wasn’t kissing back.
"But--"
“So you’ll be keeping the name then?” Mrs Hudson asked between bites.
“I, um, must admit that this is
Savouring the tensing and fluttering around him, John bit down on his lower lip, "So good," he agreed. Sherlock was fever-hot inside. So enticingly so that John was thankful of the condom, which dulled at least some of the sensations. He carefully pulled out, letting Sherlock feel every ridge and bump of his cock, and then pushed back in again. Grinning when he felt him tense and gasp out loud at the first bump against his prostate. “Just
“Sherlock,” John sighed.
Taking the stick from an impatient, whining Orion, Sherlock gave John a small smile and a shrug, “Nothing…”
“...He...” Sherlock blinked and when the doors opened, he hesitated in confusion, an odd uneasiness to him, before he stepped inside. He spoke again, but only when the doors slid closed. “Personal to who?”
“It certainly made Christmas worth while for me,” Sherlock told him, letting his eyes close to focus on John being so near to him.
“I hope he likes them,” Mrs Hudson said, looking at the toy. “The woman in the shop said it was good for aggressive chewers.”
“Wh-what are you doing?” Sherlock exhaled with a furrowed brow and a shuddering exhale, leaning up on his elbows. “Stop that! - You were invited into the room, possibly the

John blinked and swallowed thickly, “
Sherlock snorted with a grin as the lithe wiggling tongue only just caught the underside of his chin, “Yes, yes, we haven’t forgotten about you,” he said, inclining close and offering Orion his cheek, jaw, and neck to lick.

irk me!” John managed to mumble through Sherlock's compressing fingers, although it was mostly a buzzing vibration. Thankfully, Sherlock removed his fingers after sending him a mocking glare and John chuckled. “Think I'm annoying then?"
“Well that’s a shame,” Greg said, rising to his feet. “I think John might have thought he’d have a chance if you weren’t.”
“Ah, good. Glad to hear it,” Mrs Hudson chimed in, smiling widely and pointing upwards, causing Sherlock to glance at the hanging plant with a blink. “Don’t forget that it’s bad luck
is a gift?”
John interrupted him with a reverberating hum and travelled the line of Sherlock's torso to his stomach, where he delved in and around and across his navel, and then onward, down, down to his slender hips to give either side a few sharp, stinging bites, only returning to Sherlock's face, his clever, gorgeous mouth when he'd blown at rosy, moist glans, “Did you miss me?”
ago.”
In no time at all, both were naked together, and John let ate up the dishevelled and salacious vision that was Sherlock Holmes' nude body. His eyes skimmed across his coquettish posture, his broad chest, his lean abdomen, his canted hips, his muscled legs, his flexing toes, and then his curved, darkly flushed, slightly engorged cock before he pounced for another kiss. He grasped hold of the still growing, hardening shape of him, loving the hot, thick and still wet feel of it in his hand. The previous ejaculate only served to increase John's arousal. He moaned, seizing Sherlock's thigh with his other hand and avidly urging the taller man to wrap it around his waist and situate his lanky body so that they were at the right height to rub and rut together.
“I’m barely able to use the one I have.”
With one last squeeze of his fingers John released his hand and stepped back, “Go on.”
“Please
one though…”
“Oh.”

...” John gasped, clenching his feet into the carpet and trying not to thrust in, to push or hurt. When their bodies met an eternity later, he rolled his hips, grinding in and down, attempting to find Sherlock's prostate once more. The angle wasn't great, their height differences and Sherlock's straining, struggling legs adding more ire to the situation, though John merely shifted, arched and rocked until he finally heard Sherlock make a pleased, stifling gasp. “Just
“There’s nothing to Snap!” Sherlock exclaimed petulantly, dropping back again.
Sherlock’s head popped back into view, “I do
“Shut
When he was close, Sherlock reached back to tap John’s thigh and cup his hip, leaving the decision with him, “Mm. John... John, my Boswell,” he purred, right on cue, voice and tone a mixture of husky arousal and breathless affection. The next flow of words was incoherent and foreign, old English and French all intermingled. He often lost himself to the world, to John’s presence. Would praise and worship John with poetry and declarations. "Mon amour!"
three different collars,” Sherlock let fall from his mouth as he searched, scrolled, scanned and finally pinpointed a nearby shop that was indeed open. With a few taps and slides of his fingers he learned the route, the name, and put his phone away again. “Another lead. More toys.
John knew that everything was going to be okay.
to drive me insane? Weeks of constant running around, of no sleep and barely any food. Of nights where you screech on your violin or explode things in the bloody oven. I'm sick of it, Sherlock!
Greg stumbled to his feet in an undignified fumble, almost spilling his beer, but managing to put it down just in time, “I, uh, I don’t know about this. I’ve not... I don’t... I’ve
“I am
John rumbled out a mortified moan and let his good arm swing backwards to slap at Sherlock's leg, “Less talking – more rubbing.”
“I just didn’t want to spoil the fun then.”
…” John moaned, fingers clenching into the sofa, and then groping behind for Sherlock's legs, squeezing tight in zealous. “That feels like it's realigned
It took a bit more coaxing, a slap of a buttock, a squeezing pull of his hair, and a bodily knocking buck, but before long Sherlock hooked first one leg, then the other, around John’s body, letting himself slip a few inches down the wall, stabilising himself by wedging his shoulders back and swinging up to clench hold of a close shelf. John could feel every rippling, trembling contraction of Sherlock’s leg and stomach muscles as he worked to keep himself in place, could feel the burn in his own as he took his weight, thrust forward and took a looping grasp of the man’s trim waist. Their movements were off-kilter and sporadic and animalistic after that. Perfectly imperfect. Hitting all the right places. Their bared skin raked with stinging marks as they clawed and gripped at one another, struggling to press and move whilst fondling and clasping.
Trying to focus and keep still, Sherlock moaned again and grabbed for John’s thighs, clawing and stroking the tensing muscles there as he squirmed in abandon, greedily opening his mouth an inch more. Impatiently waiting, wanting, his body taut and juddering. He was close to the edge as well. John could almost taste it in the air. Like they were connected, somehow linked, exquisitely synchronised with each other. The concocted notion only made more prominent when Sherlock arched, flexing his hips forward, and let out a satisfied whimper as John's hands tensed against Sherlock's scalp and he bucked up, pushed forward, and pulsed hard and copious into Sherlock's mouth, until his tongue was coated with thick white. So much that he had to pull back to allow Sherlock to swallow.
anything,” he exhaled with a grimace, knowing that wasn’t true, yet not knowing what specifically he did indeed need.
John didn’t respond verbally, merely let him rest there, comforted, he knew, by his body heat alone. There was no need for anything else, not yet. Sherlock needed company and space simultaneously. Needed John to be there, whilst also being distant enough to allow Sherlock the time he needed. Time before the desire for more ultimately grew, as John knew it would. There would be no outward sign to it, though John would know it as if it was a physical being that tapped him on the shoulder. Like a voice would whisper what Sherlock wanted into his ear. John knew and he would willingly supply.
“Doctor John Watson,” John was saying into the phone. “And how long-? Ten minutes?
… “ John winced at the tone, “Imagine that without me sounding like I’m panicking.”
happy, John, we could share your bed? Top and tail it if you like? Nothing else. Promise.”
!” Greg exclaimed around a shoulder shaking laugh, leaning back in mirth, a blush of his own on his face. “Not good with the ol’ blowjob, eh John?”
It took a while, longer than was necessary, longer than it really should, but Sherlock hauled his attention from John to the room, to the smell of food, and tried to sit up, feeling cold where their bodies separated, “I

“So, the pants worked then?”
“Oi! Do you mind?” John complained, snagging Sherlock’s coattail in one hand and then pulling roughly. “Sit down. It looks like we’ll be here a while…”
... this is..."
“I was an idiot. I
“Ah. That’s not as bad as I was fearing,” Sherlock told him, looking back up at John and giving him the mildest smile that he could muster, hoping it looked better than it felt. His eyes fell to John’s mouth and he dragged them to his chin instead. “Thank you, John. I...didn’t expect anything like this, clearly, and I
“How do you work
“Will you?” Sherlock whispered, looking overwhelmed and emotional once more while he sat up, leaving the cushion where it lay as he shuffled over to sit on it, perching sideways across John’s lap. He peered closely into John’s face with narrowed, misty eyes. Examining. Considering. Studying. “You will not bore of me then?”
. Go slower than is normal.
John turned away, knowing his expression would give him away, "Just
He knew the dreaded stab of panic would come, but not yet. Not yet.
"... You broke into his-? No, that's not..." John huffed. "
Sherlock got to his feet and backed into the chair with uncertainty the moment the door was swung open, dragging John up with him and then tipping him to be in front, “He...should see you first.”
. What it is you actually
. It’s…it’s all good—hey, at least it’s warming us up, eh? That’s something. Arousal is good for raising the temperature of the body, as it increases heart rate and blood pressure…”
!--” The wheezing, startled, gasping voice was instantly familiar. Instantly recognisable. As were the big, pale hands that scrabbled at his wrist and forearm, fumbling between grasping for a defending clasp and soothingly patting to ease John’s spooked mind. “It’s me… it’s me, John. It’s Sherlock…”
Sherlock keened wantonly in response and gave a short, rapid nod, eyes rolling back as he gasped, bucked and whipped his tongue up against the slit in anticipation, “
Sherlock stared at her, somewhat aghast, “Buck’s fizz?” he sneered, strolling to the fridge regardless. “Do you not have anything good? Like Merlot? Or Pinot Noir? - Duck is a fatty meat that tends to need a wine with some sharpness and acidity to cut through it all.”
for more...”
“--you would complain if you felt like you were being left out,” Greg finished, signalling to Sherlock’s close proximity. “That’s why you’re here now.”
John huffed and walked past him with a glare. Like he was ever going to trust
As he was brought over the toilet once more, he caught sight of his hand, of a blurry mess of black that was smudged near his wrist, and he quickly squinted at it, bringing it over as he wiped his mouth on some toilet roll. Without the bathroom light being on it was difficult to focus, to make out what the words said, but thankfully after a moment of wincing, shaking, and bringing his hand inches from his nose, he was able to read what the man had written there.
“You’ve

, what I present self-explanatory? - Am I doing it
Looking back over his shoulder, trying to follow Sherlock’s retreating back, John twisted and almost fell to the floor, deafened by his own thoughts, his own heart beat. It had been so miniscule but he could already feel the want to try again, to document it properly, completely. As he listened to the low thud of Sherlock's footsteps as he walked away, snagging mistletoe as he went, Mrs Hudson stepped up to him and tittered, touching his hand. She said something, but he couldn’t hear her, couldn’t even be bothered to try. It was bad. It wasn’t okay.
,” Sherlock snorted, bending his head down so his fringe hid his gaze and tickled John’s brow.
positive that Mrs Hudson won’t come up. She may find a reason to, of course, but I’m hoping the sedative I dropped in her tea would have already mellowed her restless, hassling, nosy mind by now to prevent that.”
“It’s
“You’re welcome to join,” Sherlock replied, giving a nod of greeting to the poodle owner as John blinked up at him, then looked away with a hum and an almost pleased smile. Orion, meanwhile, came to say hello to them, distracting Sherlock as he brushed by before turning back to the poodle, who sniffed back at him in curiosity and greeting. “Though he might not want to sleep with me, with...
Sherlock went in first, pushed past John and shot a dark, sulky glare at Greg as he stepped in, closing his coat about him with a melodramatic tug, “
John exhaled through his nose roughly and shifted his legs as another cold blast of wind surged in from outside, “Sherlock.
“Well… yeah, but… but, um, we should...” John mumbled nervously, eyes darting away from Sherlock's intense gaze, shocked at the words coming out of his mouth, at how little they flashed in his mind before they were tumbling out into the air. “I'm happy doing it again… just… just in case, you know?”
Sighing happily, Sherlock tilted his head against the pillow, tucked his chin down, causing the comical six chin effect, and watched with a sluggish blink, “I like it,” he admitted in an almost inaudible whisper, arms and hands remaining still at his sides. For now they only twitched in their need to reach out. John knew he would touch soon and he couldn’t wait. Relished the tease of the wait. “I have a few theories as to why, but I also just...
is it?” Sherlock muttered, glancing from the white rectangle to John and arching one eyebrow. “
“I...really don’t know,” Sherlock confessed under his breath, pressing his lips together in a tight, firm line, unable to look at John again.
"Oh, I wasn't thinking Chinese this time," John told him, looking down at his face and feeling his heart ache strongly in affection. It felt good to be close to Sherlock, to be touching his hair again, to see the pretty flush of colour working its way across his cheekbones. "I was thinking Indian tonight... or Thai maybe?”
Putting the book down on his knee with a loud thump and rubbing his eyes, trying not to smile, John tried again, “
time and he just chose to do it now.” Sherlock sighed, rubbing at his hair with one hand. “I suppose he’s also still sore because I let myself into his flat four weeks ago.”
Until, of course, he had seen the black door of 221. Then he hated things a little less, felt a jolt of happiness course through him instead for the thought of home, of warmth, of comfort, of space not taken up by smelly, loud, annoying strangers. Not to mention that it meant he could at long last relieve himself of the bags that were cutting off his circulation, that he could have a wee, could get a hot drink to chase away the cold and could sit down, in his chair, in front of the fireplace.

The corner of John's lip twitched slightly, and he stepped closer, "Do you mind if I... fill that role?"

“What?
After spending some time gazing into the middle distance, John climbed into the shower and set about scrubbing his body, his own hair, and his cock, which had perked up for attention. Sherlock had been aroused too. Must have been. Had to have been. What else could explain Sherlock's bright cheeks and odd leg movements? Right? Or was it wishful thinking? Was it just a different kind of pleasure? John knew that he had shivered and wiggled once, when someone had sneaked up to push down a metal, strange looking scalp massager on his head. He remembered how it felt. Was that it?
“...Implies, yes,” Sherlock echoed and gave another upwards glance to it, fingers rubbing together as he gave the situation a contemplating frown. “If Mrs Hudson

“I like you. In many ways. You make me laugh, you're smart – no, you are, you
“No, no! That you
Sherlock turned just on the threshold of her flat doorway, “Put on
John shook his head but he did start carving slices of the duck, the steam rising in his face as he swayed and sliced, looking like a modern Viking, “Pass me your plate, Mrs Hudson.”
Sherlock grieved for the loss of his scent, breath and warmth instantly, “She may do,” he agreed. “I’d like one all the same.”
“Excited and nervous for the dog or…?” Sherlock asked dumbly, feeling incredibly dim-witted but unable to stop himself from asking, breath stolen from the warmth of John’s touch. He swallowed and then leaned their shoulders together roughly, needing more of John against him.
"So you don't want it?"
? I'd rather not, actually."
!” Sherlock snarled, leaning out at them with a sour expression, eyes flitting over them. He looked wild. His hair was puffy and frizzy – the way it did when he was stressing over a case and was constantly ruffling, pulling and combing through it with his fingers – and his eyes were slightly squinted as if he was debating who to demolish with deductions first. The mistletoe loomed overhead. Waiting. Biding its time, unnoticed. “She
Sherlock scoffed, “He’s had lots of practice,” he murmured, pressing closer beside them, hands fisted in his cloak of plush folds. His fringe was a mess of dark, fluffy curls and he was narrowly peering between the two of them, both with a faint intrigue and suspicious unease. “And I don’t mean with just me.”

This time she definitely noticed, and she looked over at him in concern, “Everything alright, dear?”

Dragging a hand down his face, Greg let out a surprised, breathless chortle, “
be uncomfortable if he admitted he was bi,” Greg said, picking up their mugs and checking the content of Sherlock’s. There was still a little left, but not much.
“That’s good,” John said, tugging a little on Sherlock’s lapels. “You’re quite the distraction yourself.”
"You have to be

“Mm. You should be. Sometimes. I suppose I do deserve it,” Sherlock slurred, eyes open a slither and mouth curling upwards flirtatiously, impishly. “I can be such a bad,
“Shut up!” John snapped before leaning in and taking Sherlock's lips in a forceful, almost brutal kiss. One that sent a spark of painful pleasure through his teeth and gums at the bump. Letting go of Sherlock's shoulders, John used one hand to hold his hip whilst the other moved to grab the back of his hair, tugging him down for an easier position to deepen the kiss, bullying his tongue into Sherlock's mouth with a deep, guttural moan.
“Oh all right,” she mumbled, stroking her fingers through the clump she still held in her hand, “I’ll take these for myself while you deal with the rest.”
“We’ll need a walking schedule,” Sherlock told him in answer to the issue, giving the two people a sharp glare when they went to pet Orion. How could strangers get on at him for being rude when they thought it was acceptable to pet a dog that did not belong to them. Orion continued to sniff at them, innocent, and much too curious, though they stepped away when they noticed Sherlock.
Greg shrugged, “His work, his sister, his time in the army, his current girlfriend…”
The radio station began to play Bach, and John felt Sherlock turn his head, straining to listen to the familiar strings of the cello. John thought perhaps he'd spotted a tightening of Sherlock's eyes as he leaned back up slightly, a memory flashing in his mind, a clingy passing emotion, a raise and churn of nostalgia, and wondered what that meant, what was going on in that glorious head of his. The music was dark and sad, seemed to wrap and coil around them in the semi-quietness of the flat, creating a bubble of fluctuating ambience as John continued to adorn Sherlock's face and hair with his fingers, petting lightly, lovingly.

“I wouldn’t say ‘
“So soon?” Mrs Hudson said in surprise. John just shrugged and smirked.
John accepted it and straightened some out, putting them on the floor in the corner of the kitchen and setting one of the bowls down, the other he filled with water before setting it next to the first, “There we are.”

, come to my house for cases,” Greg told him. “You text, you come to my office or, if you’re desperate, you call. But you’ve come to my home, probably because Mrs Hudson’s away and John is out for the evening.”
“Yes, that’s usually what happens when one is cooking,” Sherlock said with a twitch of his mouth, watching John stretch his back and feeling infinitely more taken with him. Everything about John was infatuating.

“Yeah?” John replied and Sherlock could hear the smile in his voice. “Well, I’m not going anywhere any time soon.”
Wheezing and seemingly unable to stop trembling and twitching, Sherlock gave a low keening moan, “Yes… I… I rather agree…
Orion was only too happy to comply, his tongue brushing wet strokes over his skin as John chuckled and patted at his fur, “Such a

“I packed some essentials for the first week or so,” Ryan chipped in bringing the paper bag over, though keeping it out of Orion’s reach as he started to sniff at it.
“Yes. Lots of it,” Sherlock replied, looking at his hand and reaching tentatively for it, before stopping and sitting down with a sigh, happy when he didn’t sway or stumble on the way. “We can discuss it at a later date. If and when it comes up in the future.”
Blushing, Sherlock reclined back in his chair, stirring custard and ice cream together in a swishing, sloppy swirl, “Do

“Yes. Merry Christmas, John,” Sherlock sighed, watching him from under his brows and looking, once again, at the dog photo, a happy, though uncertain, wonky smile threatening to take over his face.
“I do not ‘

,” Sherlock sniped in embarrassment, hating how off balance he felt. His legs refusing to do as he told them. Body betraying him. Perhaps this had been a bad idea? The dog, their relationship change, it was a lot to deal with and he couldn’t quite choose which one needed his focus, his attention, the most.

“Okay, well, if you change your mind, know the offer still stands,” John said with a smile, making sure it was soft and showed none of his disappointment. Suddenly shy with the attention of both Greg and Sherlock on him, John shifted and sat up with a grunt, avoiding eye contact, “I better go dispose of this--” He gestured at his crotch and the still glistening condom. “And get his nibs a flannel so he doesn't get glazed overnight. - Sherlock, do you want a drink while I’m up?”
“It was nice of Mike Stamford to invite me really,” Greg sighed as John walked him to the flat door, his hands deep into the pockets of his trousers, jacket open and lapel fluttering in the harsh rushing wind.
Sherlock gave a nod and stepped away, wafting out John's coat and refolding it over his arms, “Go on then. Plenty of hot water today, so enjoy yourself.”
landlady of yours. She knew
John hummed again, and Sherlock could feel it through his nose and cheek and arms, every part of him that was touching him, “… I should put my coat on.”

Sherlock blinked and then looked away, staring at the gifts, “Oh,” he breathed.
"I don't remember buying it though..."
"See you at the next case," Greg called after them, and shut the door, leaving them to head back through the pit in their angered silence.

“It’s what you do with it.” John finished the saying, frowning as Sherlock’s obliviousness remained, “Oh come on, you
Hesitating for just a moment, Greg glanced at Sherlock’s grimacing flushed face and perspiring brow for several studying seconds, before he rearranged him on the pillows and swooped down with a long, gravelly breath against Sherlock’s wet, parted lips, “Do you want it, you greedy boy?” he whispered, not having the time to really be satisfied with the imploring moan as Sherlock arched up for him.
more toys. A bed. And treats.”
“Liar,” Greg snorted, sharing a look with John and then motioning to him, to his face. John knew he looked as disbelieving as Greg sounded. “See, come on, we know how you can get. Whether you’re boyfriends or not--”
“Oh, you,” she said, batting him on the shoulder. “Off you go now, before I keep you here for the rest of the day. - Wrap up warm!”
John pushed two fingers back inside without warning and pressed against Sherlock's prostate, watching him practically topple over with the shock of the sharp jolt, “Nobody told you about that feeling, did they?” he smirked, coaxing more pre-come from Sherlock's heavily hanging cock with a few gentle rubs against the swollen gland. He couldn't exactly see, but he could hear. Hear the thick dribble. “I want to fuck you. Christ, I want to fuck you
“Oh wonderful!” Mrs Hudson proclaimed, drawing John’s attention from where he was drying his hands. “I already have the duck in the oven.”

Frustrated, confused, and feeling like a complete idiot of a human being, filled to the brim with nonsensical contradictory thoughts, he did what he usually did in a tricky situation. He had a wank.
“I… I may have…” Sherlock mumbled in admittance, trailing off into an awkward stillness and shifting with a swift eyelash flutter of further mortification, lips pressing together in a wonky wince. "It... it was quite unexpected and... and it... and I..."

“What you’re doing right now? My daughter’s at that stage of lying. It’s called
Carefully ripping at the tape that held it closed, peeling back the wrapping paper, John moved it to the side to peer within and frowned as he looked at what seemed like a small black rectangle of fabric. Neatly folded fabric. He opened it up, eyes going wide and mouth falling open as he looked at his present. It was a pair of pants. Black boxer short pants, but where the fly was positioned was a cartoon elf, or rather the body of the elf, as it's head was replaced with the head of Sherlock, the expression on his face half smug and half contented. A Sherlock elf cupping and basically hugging the part where John's flaccid penis would rest and come out of.
politeness, yes, I'm sure they were!” Sherlock scoffed, a pale hand appearing to push back his fringe and ruffle through his hair, a clear sign of his growing agitation. His elbow peeked out too for a moment. A bare elbow. As well as a peek of a bare forearm and bicep. “They were glad I wasn’t there. They
on a daily basis," John said pointedly.
Sherlock, after a long moment of hesitation, stepped closer and put his chin down on John’s shoulder, “Mm. I’m sure she's glad too. - Perhaps more so when her feet touch grass,” he murmured. “Until she has to take part in the pecking order…”
“I don’t mind it. Orion was a huntsman from Greek mythology, yes? Though he owned dogs too, if I remember correctly,” Sherlock mumbled.
“Yes,

“You know that’s not true,” Sherlock snorted, walking them in a shifting shamble across the living room and around the coffee table, until John’s legs knocked into the sofa. “Lie down. On your front.”
“I know someone,” Sherlock told him quietly, not looking at all pleased with John and his responses, his reactions, though his glower was weakened when the turkey gave his curls a bit of a peck. “I know
He hated being sick, didn't know why he put himself through this pain for the sake of being intoxicated for such a short amount of time. He could barely remember the night he'd had through the pain, through the sobering up. He could have sworn he had spoken to a Santa impersonator. Hadn't he talked to Santa?
“I’m sorry I didn’t react,” John sighed. “I was… I didn’t

“What happened to making things the old fashioned way? I thought you preferred that?” Sherlock mumbled.

“Mm. Please,” Sherlock replied, making sure to let his mouth twist up into a small smile, enough to persuade John to give him another teaspoon of sugar, because apparently it put John in a much better mood if he did. He often felt like smiling at John anyway, so it was no real hassle for him. In fact it was most pleasant, especially when John returned it with one of his own. John had many smiles. All different. All attached to different moods, thoughts, wants. Sherlock had them all documented. A room of John’s smiles nestled deep within his Mind Palace. “Merry Christmas, John.”
Greg let out a long sigh, jaw muscles bulging, and took a long, deep, swig of beer, using it then to motion and point with, “Isn’t this complicated at all, this
“No. It's true,” John told him, as candidly as he could manage to Greg's slackening and shocked face.
John grinned and moved to sit at Sherlock’s side again, picking up the bits of wrapping paper that had been scattered on the floor and folding them up, “You’d better enjoy that; I think I’m in Mrs Hudson’s bad books now.”
“Sherlock! Stop squirming,” John chastised, twisting his finger and brushing against Sherlock’s prostate to jerk his fidgeting to a stop, “You're going to hurt yourself if you keep on.”
,” tumbled out of John in a mumble, broken by every kiss, every hiss of vehement want, and he nibbled, for a moment, on the hinge of Sherlock’s slackened jaw. “I hate how much. I hate it.
Sherlock lapsed into silence, his warm breath gusting down the front of John’s jumper before shuffling yet closer and stilling against John’s body. John tried to ignore the fact that Sherlock’s privates were now wedged snuggly against his own, but soon, seeping warmth began to crawl over them and John became aware of Sherlock’s penis hardening hotly and jutting into his hip. John clenched his eyes shut in sympathetic embarrassment, and patted Sherlock’s side when he visibly tensed and tried to shift his hips back.
,” John interrupted and released Sherlock all at once to open his jeans, reach into his pants, and spit down on his throbbing cock. It took over a dozen pulls and then John tensed, pushed his hips forward and shouted in release, letting his orgasm take him, covering Sherlock’s stomach, covering the damn ribbons. He slumped forward, just about catching himself before he fell, and blinked blearily at Sherlock, at his frowning expression. "M'sorry... I couldn't resist--"

"Get you all
compared to the males. - In all the different breeds you can tell the females from the males. It’s not difficult!”

When they were both nude, flushes on their bodies lessening with each shaky breath, their hardened flesh now softening, John pulled Sherlock under the covers with him and connected them, skin-to-skin, thinking about kissing him, before the deafening ring of his alarm shattered everything into pieces, “Oh,” he grunted and twisted to turn it off, taking a fleeting pause. “I… have to go to work.”
,’” Sherlock argued in a breathless, ragged moan.
...” John snorted.
John ruffled the slushy snow from his hair, his trousers, and stomped it from his shoes the instant he hopped in from outside, hating how quickly the snow that morning had turned from light and fluffy, to wet and heavy in seconds, drenching and lathering the pavement, the buildings, the lights, the people, in a cascading curtain of greyish white. It had been another brilliant wonderland at first, everything crispy and pure, the perfect weather for a friendly meet-up with Mike Stamford and his cheerful, bubbly wife, and a happy exchange of presents. Then the sky had darkened, the wind had changed, and the descent of mushed, dirty melting ice, had rained down on them, catching everyone by surprise in its attack. John could only thank his lucky stars that he’d worn extra layers on a whim, keeping the soaking chill from fully reaching his torso and feet, otherwise he was sure he would have become an even grumpier grump than he currently was.
?” Sherlock huffed, glancing at John, at the flush on his cheeks, at the small, tilted smile on his face, and felt his heart ache.
two packs the past week,” Sherlock continued to mutter, glaring into the middle distance.
“Do you want some pyjamas, by the way? I can get some from upstairs if you like? I normally just sleep in my pants.” John looked down at Sherlock, face slack and eyes glazed. “He sleeps nude. Of course.”
