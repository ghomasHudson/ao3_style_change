Dean’s breathing gets more unsteady, his eyes wide open in fear and he’s on the edge of a panic attack.
“Two?” Cas has asked before he just went silent again. Not waiting for an answer. There was no answer for such a stupid question.
Cas has been waiting for what feels like hours until the nurse tells him to go take a look after Dean. He goes through the long and grey hallways of the hospital until he reaches the room Dean is in. He still doesn't really know what is going on in Deans mind and he plans to ask the Winchester, just not right now.
“Don’t worry about that.” Cas whispers. “Do it the way you think that’s best for you, Sam and I will always be here if you need someone.” Dean leans forward and his lips lightly touching Cas’ before Cas pulls the Winchester closer and presses his lips against Dean, not able to wait any longer for that kiss.
He finds a payphone right outside his room and at first he accidentally dials Cas’ number but realizes it before he presses the call button. He deletes it and finally dials Sam’s who could’ve been waiting right in front of the phone as fast as he picks up.
How could everything they built up just fall apart that easily?
“Family of Dean Winchester.” a male doctor appears in the waiting area and Sam jumps up instantly.” “Yeah, how is he?” the seventeen year old stumbles over the words, nervousness kicking out the sadness he felt only a second before.” “I am Doctor Smith. You must be Sam Winchester, right?” Sam nods and the doctors gaze lands on Castiel. “Who are you? Are you related?” “No.” Cas shakes his head a little. “I’m Castiel Novak, boyfriend of Dean. Sam called me.” “Alright. So, your brother Sam, he’s through with surgery. We managed to pump the drugs out of his system and we stitched him back up. He had some blood loss but you calling the emergency that fast saved him from further complications. Since you mentioned that this was a suicide attempt,” the doctor stops and Cas can see Sam swallow visibly. “Dean will be put under seventy-two hour suicide watch. After that he can decide if he wants to stay here for therapy or if he prefers going back home. I will tell him all this at a decent time tomorrow. I think this will only upset him more tonight.” Castiel and Sam nod and the doctor smiles sympathetically.
Sam and Jess enter the room and Cas sighs quietly. "How's he doing?" Jess asks softly and Cas is about to when he realizes that the nurse from earlier is standing right behinf her. "He lost a lot of blood but it's not too bad. His knuckles are just swollen, not broken and physically he'd be able to go home in a day. But there are a few lst checks we have to make. His physical circumstances are fine, like I said, but I'm worried about his mental condition. I believe he suffers fro a trauma, the doc will check on him. I can't really force him at the moment but if he doesn't get better during the next day I highly recommend him to see a therapist  and probably stay here for a while longer." the nurse finishes with a sad look on her face and Cas nods slowly
just realised all my chapters seem kinda short but yay...
“I- Cas I’m sorry. I fucked up and-” “It’s not your fault Dean. And I want you to know that this is not your fault. But I can’t do this.” the Novak has to hold back his tears when he looks up and into Dean’s face. His eyes water and it’s visible how he desperately tries to keep that ever existing mask on his face.
“You might have realized that you get a little dizzy when getting up but it’s nothing bad or so. Your physical health will be back to somewhat normal in two or three days. What worries me is your mental health.” “I’m perfectly fine doc.” Dean throws in and the doctor smiles sadly.
“Dean?” the Winchester doesn’t answer and when Cas carefully looks at Dean he realizes that he is asleep.
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?]
The Winchester opens the door of the Impala in a slow movement and takes some steps closer to the house. Cas steps into the snow next to Dean and lies one arm around his shoulders, careful not to scare him. “It’s ours Dean.” Cas whispers after a few seconds and they keep looking at the white house, looking even more beautiful with all the falling snow and the shimmering Christmas decoration.
“Cas, I don’t think I deserve to be here right now.” Dean suddenly whispers which makes Cas look up again, staring into Dean’s green and watering eyes. The Winchester closes his eyes and let his forehead fall against Cas’ shoulder who instantly wraps his arms around Dean’s torso and pulls the Winchester close against his chest.
“Garth knows by the way.” he states while Cas watches him from the doorway. “Yeah, Dean, I told you that lying to him wasn’t gonna work.” “Yeah, I tried. Don’t want him pitying me too.”, “No ones pitying you Dean.”, “You and Sam are, Ellen too probably. And I bet that Bobby knows by now too.”, “Dean. We aren’t pitying you. We’re just worried.”, “It’s basically the same.”
Cas slowly walks into the hallway of the apartment finding Jess in the kitchen. “Hey, Sam said you’re leaving?” her voice is soft and Castiel can’t see any anger in her features. He can’t get out a sound so he just nods and Jess smiles a little before she pulls the Novak into a strong hug. “Take care Cas. And when you feel like the time is right, come here and get Dean alright? Sam and I’ll take care of him.” he just nods again before Jess leads him into the living room where Sam and Dean are sitting on the sofa, staring into nothing.
“That the guy you’ve been here with the past few days?” Dean shakes his head. He tries to lift it but only manages to let it rest on his arm. His mind starts to get flooded with memories of the war mixing with memories from before and after and he has to really try to keep his breathing under control. He’s not gone far enough to just get a panic attack in a bar full of people.
DEAN closes the space between Sam and him and looks at his younger brother with a sad smile before he gets pulled into a strong hug. “Hey Dean.” Sam whispers before he lets his chin rest on his big brother’s shoulder, eyes closed.                                                 Cas realizes that Dean started shivering right before Jess pulls him out of the hallway and into the kitchen.                                    “How is he?” she asks and leans against the refrigerator which is standing next to a window. It started to snow again and Cas watches the snowflakes dancing through the air whirled up by the wind from time to time.                                                 “Cas?” Jess pulls him out of staring and his eyes away from the window. “He’s back for a few days and we thought we’d surprise the two of you.” Cas says with a heartwarming smile, avoiding to actually answer Jess question who just starts smiling too and doesn’t push for an answer.                                               “You planning to stay over Christmas?” hope flickers in Jess eyes and it hurts Cas to shake his head. “We planned to go to Manhattan on Christmas Eve. But I think we’ll visit you on the way back.” He keeps smiling and Jess nods slowly.                                She takes a look into the hallway and realizes that Sam and Dean are still there, wrapping their arms around each other like they’ll never be able to do it again.                                           “Why Manhattan?” Jess asks after a longer pause and Cas looks up in an instant.                                                                     “We’ve been there before Dean’s been oversea and we really enjoyed Manhattan.” Cas answers but looks out of the window to watch the dancing snowflakes again.
“I guess we’ll see each other again sometime.” he whispers. “I sure hope not.” he hears Castiels quiet voice and has to force himself to not break down here and now but at least leave the house and never look back.
After a few long minutes he finally steps outside and makes his way up to the door. After taking a deep breath he finally knocks.
“Dean?” his voice is quiet when he shuffles closer to the Winchester who is sitting curled up in the middle of the room white bandages next to him.
Dean kisses Cas onto the cheek and pulls back to give Cas’ his present. Cas opens it slowly and pulls out a rede norweger pullover. Cas stands up and leaves the room and a confused looking Dean behind to change the hoodie against the new pullover.
Sam smiles and Cas nods with a big grin on his face before he turns to take a glance at Dean who didn’t say anything for a while.
“I’ll try something.” Dean whispers after minutes of just staring into each other’s eyes and he slowly rolls around so he is facing the wall and his back is facing Cas. He then moves away from the wall and closer to Cas. He trusts Cas more than anyone right now and he told himself to forget about what had happened so he has to start with something.
Sam wraps his arms around Dean’s torso trying to calm his twitching brother. “Dean, it’s alright, it’s me, Sam.” Dean stops twitching and pulls away from Sam
The Winchester’s breathing becomes faster each second that passes, his eyes wide in pure panic. “Dean, hey, it’s me!” Cas finally yells at him and in one smove movement he grabs the Winchester’s wrists to secure them from throwing more punches before he grabs Dean’s shoulders and just pulls the Winchester into a strong hug.
“Hello Dean. You look good.” the doctor enters with a smile and Dean gets up to shake his hand. “I hope so. Haven’t been doing much the last week.”, “Good. Taking some time off to let your body heal is a very good thing to do. Have you called the therapist?”  Dean shakes his head and the Doctor just nods. “Have you at least taken your prescribed pills?”, “Yeah, of course.”, “You gotta be honest with me Dean.”. “No, alright? I don’t like the effect they have on me.” the Doctor just nods again and types something into his computer. “Any problems?”, “With what?”, “Dean you just went cold-turkey with your meds. You usually aren’t supposed to do that.”, “No, none. I’m good.” the Doctor nods again and urges Dean to sit down on the chair again.
Alice laid on her back and closed her eyes, letting out a long sigh. “That was fun.” She said softly. Benji nodded as he moved to put his clothes in the dresser. Jack was nice and Benji was looking forward to being his friend. He walked to the kitchen and grabbed a glass, filling it with water and taking a sip. The trip reminded him of his brother. They would always have fun on long drives, even if the destination wasn’t pleasant. God he missed Eli. Benji stood, eyes glossed over and unfocussed. Alice sat up, smoothing back her hair. “Looks like a ghoul.” She said gruffly. Benji clenched the glass in his hand, the memories flooding back. He missed them all so much. Then, the memory he promised never to share made its way to his focus. The darkness, the blood, the torture, the crying. He never told Alice about it when she asked if he “crossed the bridge”. He told her two weeks wasn’t long enough, but it was. It felt like an eternity.
Here they were, about two years later, in this small motel room. The last two Fosters left. Benjiman snapped his head up. “No!” He yelled. “You promised me, Alice!” Alice sighed putting away her knife. “Benji…” The brother walked to meet his sister, glaring at her, he said in a stern voice, “You can go, but I’m staying. I’m working this case with or without you.”
Alice shot a look of confusion at her brother. Eli turned to the crossroads demon, who had seen the whole ordeal, and walked towards him. “Let me take her place. My soul for hers.” Alice stepped forward. “Eli, no.” Eli stuck his hand behind him, signaling for his sister to stay back. “Oh?” The demon raised his brow, pushing off the pole he was leaning on. A smirk danced on his lips. “You bring my brother back, and when the two years are up, you take me.” Eli was cold, serious, and stern. The demon chuckled. Alice stepped forward. “What?”,  he asked, wondering what was so amusing about the situation. “Oh, honey. I’m all for taking her place, a soul for a soul, but it looks to me you’re desperate. You’ll do anything to keep your little runts safe. You don’t get two years, no no no, you get two months.” Alice gasped softly, fear coursed through her body. “That’s not fair!” She pleaded. The demon cast a playful glare at the young girl. “Sweetheart, life’s not fair.” Turning his attention to Eli, he said, “So, what’ll it be, short stuff?” Alice came up beside her brother, grabbing his arm and pleading for him to decline. Eli let a tear slip down his cheek. He glared at the demon, whispering, “Fine.” The demon cupped a hand up to his ear. “What was that?” Eli walked up to him, standing toe to toe, and holding the demon an inch off the ground by his black worn shirt. “Deal.”
Dean soon leans into Cas’ touch and let’s his head rest on the other man’s shoulder, still not believing all this is happening for real, not after what he experienced the last years. He tries not to think about what happened and to just enjoy the view at the most beautiful house he’s ever seen.
He looks a little lost. He can’t really catch up with everything that’s happening right now and that bothers him more than he would admit.
Dean obviously punched the mirror in anger and the knuckles of his right hands are swollen and could also be broken. His left wrist got slit by what had to be shattered glass and is now bleeding heavily.
He wakes up from the sound of machine guns being fired and has to look twice to realize that he’s in the motel room he must have fallen asleep a few hours ago. Dean swings his legs over the edge of the bed and lets his gaze settle o the small window where he can watch the sun rising. He takes a look at the clock hanging over the headboard of the bed and chuckles in relief. It’s a little after 8:00 and he actually managed to sleep through without any nightmares until now.
He believed he could help Dean but right now he feels just worse and more helpless than before.                                           “Thanks.” Dean whispers which surprises Cas who just stares at the Winchester confused. “For what?” his voice is nothing more than a whisper. “For being you, for being here, for listening. I know that you don’t know what to say right now and you don’t need to. Just- just stay.” Dean moves closer against Cas chest if that’s even possible. “Man that was hell of a chick-flick moment.” he whispers before he closes his eyes and drifts off to sleep.                                                                   The next morning Dean wakes up to an empty bed and panic rises inside of him until he discovers the small piece of paper on Cas’ pillow.
Cas opens the front door and realizes how long they’ve been in the house. The snow is still dancing through the clear air but the thin layer appears to be a lot higher than it was when they pulled up in front of the house some time before. Cas grabs Dean’s bag, heads back to the house and stops to take one look at their house again, taking in the beautiful sight of it.
Castiel opens the door only to stare into the Winchester’s face. “What are you doing here Dean?” Cas asks in an angry tone and he doesn’t miss the fact that Dean flinches a little but seems to recover really fast.
Their fingers are folded together and Dean’s head keeps resting on Cas’ shoulder.
“What now?” Cas mouths to Sam who just shrugs his shoulders, confused and out of ideas, before he helps Dean up to lead him out of the bathroom and into the bedroom.
Jeremy was his closest friend over there and he feels like he left him behind because he was way too selfish.
The drive in the Impala is quiet since there’s no music and Dean’s on his own. His plan was to just stop at some motels but he knows he won’t be able to catch any sleep so he just decides to drive all the way at once.
“I think I’m getting sick.” Dean suddenly says and rushes to the bathroom to throw up into the toilet. Cas kneels down beside the Winchester an gently strokes one hand over Deans back who lets his head rest on his arm.
“Is everything alright? Did I do something wrong?” Cas asks, his face full of worry and concern about Dean who shakes his head in an instant. “I just- okay this will sound weird as fuck and I hate chick-flick moments so don’t waste this.” Dean smiles a little and wraps his arms around Cas’ neck and moves his face closer to Cas’ until their foreheads are resting against each other.
“Oh, yeah right. I missed you Dean.” he mumbles and smiles brightly when he actually manages to open his lunch box.
“I want you to take them.” “Sam I already have the Impala.” “Please, Dean would want you to have them.” he smiles sadly and just puts them over Cas head, not taking ‘no’ as an answer.
Castiel sits down onto the sofa right next to Sam. Both of them remain silent and wait for Jess and Dean to join them. Jess appears some minutes later but no sight of Dean. “He’s in the bedroom he wants to talk to you Cas. Alone.” Jess says in a quiet voice and Cas nods before he slowly gets up to get to Dean.
“I had to sit with the stoners the past week cause you weren’t here Dean.”, “Don’t make me feel bad now Garth, I didn’t choose to catch a freaking cold.” Dean laughs but at the same time mentally slaps himself for lying to Garth so openly. The other guy wasn’t dumb by any means. He just managed to be happy and mentally healthy, how he did that while going to school was still something Dean never got an answer to.
(See the end of the chapter for
The Novak wants to kiss Dean, show him how much he loves him but his sadness turned into anger so he just keeps standing at the door. “Cas-” “No.” he shuts the Winchester up and scans his boyfriends body, or at least what’s not hidden from the sheets.
He hangs up and feels tears rolling down his cheeks just a second later. When did he reach that point? He wipes them away angrily but they just keep rolling and he can’t see enough to drive safely. So he just hets out his phone again and scrolls through his contacts until he finds Cas’ number and just calls him hoping he’ll actually answer.
I'm sorry that the chapters are still really short. But I wanna bring this story to an end an then make it more detailed and longer. But that's always easier for me when it's already written.
“I’m right back.” Castiel assures Dean, gives him a short kiss before he leaves the room with Doctor Smith.
“Dean,” he rasps and swallows once, twice. “I might not be able to relate to you, but after you told me of your diagnosis I read some things and tried to understand. And it really hurts me when you talk like this but I can’t blame you, I don’t have the right to do it and I don’t want to. There are ways to get better, therapy-” “I ain’t gonna see a shrink Cas. Not gonna happen.” “You’d rather throw away everything than have someone help you work through your past?”
Cas finally moves again though his limps feel nearly too heavy. He goes back to the dining room aware that Jess is still there unknowing of what’s actually going on.
His glance goes to a small desk that wasn’t there the last time he was there which was more than half a year. He didn’t see him or talk to for more than half a year.
Every thought, every memories he has from the past two years comes rushing back in a sudden, colliding with happy memories of him and Cas but drowning them again in an instant.
Cas gets up and pulls out a small present. He doesn’t want to push Dean into a conversation about his feelings he knows how much Dean hates it.
-I’m grabbing some breakfast. Will be back in thirty-
December 31st, 1973
Dean doesn’t know what he expected. Maybe Cas freaking out, yelling at him, maybe even crying or at least looking hurt. But the Novaks face is calm and he just looks at Dean.
“Happy New Year Cassie.” Dean whispers and chuckles lightly before he carefully pulls Cas’ head down and kisses him softly onto the lips.
“Dean, I think there’s a lot we should talk about, after everything that happened over the past days. I don’t know what happened and I am completely fine if you don’t wanna talk about it but after everything you were telling me the past days I don’t feel like you should keep it in Dean.” “Cas I really don’t need to talk about it.” Dean tries to insist on his way of coping but Cas lets his head hang low a lump in his throat.
Dean let’s his head rest under Cas’ chin who slowly strokes his thumb through Dean’s hair. “We don’t have to go anywhere if you don’t want to.” Cas whispers after some time but Dean shakes his head. “I want to go to Manhattan, with you, New Year’s Eve. Cas, I really wanna go there with you. Hell, I would go anywhere with you, but please, I don’t wanna go to that funeral. Dean whispers against Cas’ chest who nods and kisses Dean’s hair softly.
Sometimes they are able to hear the screams of the other soldiers for hours begging it all to end.
“Dean?” Castiel slowly walks closer to the window and stops right next to Dean. The Winchester doesn’t answer which makes Cas look at him.
“But I don’t know what I’m supposed to talk about Cas.” Dean pulls his wrists out of Cas’ grip and moves his back against the door of the Impala, at least not about to leave the car anymore.
Deans head lies still on his arm while he tries to get the pictures out of his head.                                                     There’s blood, everywhere, on him, next to him, too much, the screams started surrounding him again bringing back the never ending fear and he can’t stop it.                                              The nausea creeps back and he heaves his too heavy body over the toilet once again before the scenery in front of his inner eye changes.                                                                      It's him and his closest friend sitting in one of the shacks, backs against the wall, bars in front of them, dividing them from the rest of their unit.                                                     All the other soldiers who've been in their cell too died over the past months, one by one, got killed or starved to death.
How is he able to comfort him when he just lost his brother. How can he comfort the guy who got his brother killed.
But all in all Dean’s back is nothing more than a field of thick and pink lashes.
“Hello?” “Sammy?” Dean whispers and he can hear a sigh on the other end. “Dean? Where are you? Are you alright?” Sam and his endless string of questions. “I’m fine Sammy. Don’t worry. I’m at some crappy motel, I don’t even know where. But I’m heading to yours and Jess’ if that’s alright with you two.” “Yes, Dean that’s totally fine. Do you know when you’ll be here?” “I could make it tomorrow if I start driving early.” “Don’t stress yourself alright?” “I won’t. I promise.” and they both hang up.
They are thrown back into reality when the bathroom door gets shut with a loud bang.
(See the end of the chapter for
But as soon as Dean starts scratching at his wrists Cas catches them not caring if the Winchester is fine with it or not.
They sit in comfortable silence until the door opens and the doctor steps through it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What if there was nothing to figure out?” Dean sounds so vulnerable and small which replaces Cas’ anger with a cloud of sadness, tears starting to roll down his cheeks.
“Dean calm down. I don’t wanna panic you.” Not sure what he did wrong Cas tries to come through to Dean but the Winchester isn’t really aware of anything that’s going on around him. Not hearing anything besides all the screaming in his mind.
“Is he still taking his prescribed pills?” “I think so, at least he always took them when he was with me. Couldn’t you just ask him that?” “Would he be honest with me if he didn’t?” “Probably not.” the doctor nods and writes something down.
He was alone. It was silent. No one was there, everyone was gone. And it was dark. Pitch black and inky.
He couldn’t tell if they were from anger or fear or sadness, or guilt. That seemed to happen a lot recently. Alice was left standing in silence. After looks of confusion from the Winchesters, Alice explained what had happened to her sister. The two brothers sat and listened, feeling pain and empathy for the two remaining siblings. After finishing up, they stood in thick silence. Alice inhaled deeply. “I-I shouldn’t’ve said that… why did I say that?”, she stammered. It happened so often that Alice said something without care, causing Benji to feel pain or hurt, then Alice trying effortlessly to apologize. But in the end, they were all they had left. They always pulled through, no matter what. Dean sighed. He knew what it felt like to want to be totally independent. He had tried to keep him and Sam safe for so long. He figured it was his job to protect his brother, so accepting help was failing.
The silence engulfed him again, letting sorrow in with the abence of sound. After another short moment, he heard the stern voice of his father. The boy’s eyes widened. He was always afraid of his Dad, he was never threatened by him, Benji was just terrified he would let him down. “Don’t move that piece there, Ben,” he heard his father say. It wasn’t a faint whisper, this was a clear instructive voice. It was a fmiliar tone that Benji hadn’t heard in so long. Out of the darkness, a chessboard stabally hovered in front of him. Memories of the many late night chess matches flodded his mind. He let a small smile creep onto his lips. That smile was interrupted when the clear voice of Tyson Foster rang out in echos, “If you move your Rook there,” Benji watched as the white Rook on his side of the board rose and glided just across the center of the checkered surface. “Then, I can take your Knight.” The Rook landed on the board, and the Knight was knocked out of its place with a loud crash. Benjiman jumped with the sudden noise and let out a short raspy whimper. He blinked, and it all has vanished into the dark void.
Sorry, this chapter is really short atm but I'll definitely rewrite it as soon as I got motivation, time and ideas xD
“Cas, go or they’ll hurt you. All of you.” Dean whispers into Cas direction before the nausea comes crawling up his throat again and he he lets his head rest onto the toilet seat once again.
“Drive careful.” he hugs Cas again shortly before the Novack gets into the Impala, puts her into drive.
“Cas.” Dean starts after minutes of silence and the Novak looks up from his sport in front of Dean. “What is it?” “I gotta tell you something. After you- After I left here I got some small motel room and I went to that bar you picked me up from.” the Winchester stops and takes a deep breath. “I- I had something with another guy.” he breathes out and he feels how the tension in the room gets thicker.
“I figured out that this is real-“ “How?” Cas asks, curious. “I am able to feel pain I feel happiness even if it’s just momentarily.” Dean smiles a little. “I’ve never felt any pain in my dreams, or any kind of happiness.” he continuous.
“You could’ve said something.” Castiel whispers and takes a few steps closer to Dean’s bed. The older Winchester just shakes his head. “What was I supposed to say Cassie? Hey, man I wanna off myself but don’t worry?” his voice is thick with sarcasm and it makes Cas angry.
“No, Cas, you don’t get it. I had something with him. We didn’t just fool around.” Dean’s voice gets quieter in the end. “Did you- fuck.” the Novak can’t hold back his tears and hides his face in his palms his shoulders shaking. “Cas, I’m so sorry. I-” “Stop it Dean, you should leave.” Cas rasps out which actually surprises the Winchester but he doesn’t question it. “If that’s what you want.” “Yes.” “Than I’m sorry I bothered you. Thanks for the breakfast and all that.”
Dean trusts Cas though he hates feeling attached to nyone in any way but it’s totally different when Cas is around.
The older Winchester doesn’t know what he did to deserve the help Jess and Sam provide to him since he made Cas leave but he doesn’t want to complain.
He bends over to get his Polaroid camera from his bag and stops when he feels the dog tags dangle around his neck. Dean’s dog tags. He forgot to give them back to him.
August 12th
When the thought to just jump crawls into his mind he takes a huge step back. Scared even though it just sounds peaceful to him but maybe that’s what scares him the most.
Because he fucked up. Because he couldn’t stay. Because he couldn’t be there when Dean needed him the most. Because he thought- he doesn’t even know what he thought. Probably some selfish thing. And it didn’t get them anywhere. It just got Dean in a wooden box six feet under.
When Cas leaves the bathroom Dean is already lying in bed,T-Shirt on, back against the wall, curled up in the sheets but his eyes still open, waiting for Cas to lay down next to him.
And if he’s honest he is afraid of being left alone and even if he tries not to think about it he sometimes catches himself thinking about the fact that he should’ve died instead of Jeremy. Jeremy helped so many people, never hold a gun in his hands but still, they’ve killed him and Dean wasn’t able to do anything to help the one person he should’ve helped.
Castiel feels so out of place. The bunker doesn't feel like home to him, he's not sure if it ever did. The tears are still flowing as he looks around. This is the closest thing to a home he's ever had and yet, it doesn't feel right.
At this point, he thinks that the love he holds for Dean Winchester is the very essence of his being.
Castiel laughs and Dean feels warmth rising in his chest. He's in love.
have to do it.” He doesn’t know what he wants Cas to do, just knows that he wants and only Cas can help him. Just knows that Cas knows what he’s asking for.
Dean pinches his eyes shut. His t-shirt clings tight to his back, an invisible sheet of sweat covers his forehead and top lip. He can hear the blood in his veins and his pulse picks up the pace and his heart is going to bounce right out of his chest. His breathing is uneven, erratic and if

Dean can’t help the laugh that erupts from his chest, and his head falls forward, just there, on Cas’ shoulder.
Jack agrees. “Gumbee.”
“Why the hell are you naked? It’s cold out here.”

Cas was. It was like, coming back home from a hunt and falling on his memory foam. It was like caramelizing onions, the process as gratifying as tasting them in your burger. It’s like, being alive, and not having to worry about it. It’s just easy, definitely addicting, and the sex ain’t half bad.

Cas is his comrade in arms, who gives the best blowjobs and lets Dean cling to his torso like an octopus when they sleep, and makes the worst breakfast anyone ever could. Dean doesn’t want to ‘label it’, but now he’s thinking about it. And to be fair to his thoughts, friends, however close, do not have enough authority over him to have him sit on a three-hour flight.
When the death metal trap gains a grip on the sky, Dean finally rests his head on the seat. Three minutes of silence, and he says, “Baby is my car.” He can suddenly hear very loud, relatively, his own voice echoing in his ears.
Cas just looks at him, willing him to elaborate.
Cas watches Sam’s eyes glow with grace, and then he’s holding his palm to Cas, healing him. Power surges through him, and he wakes with a gasp, and Dean’s name on his lips.
, his voice breaks with a shudder. “I’m so sorry for leaving you, Cas. Man,
“Why not?” Cas frowns. “I used to have a female vessel. Then, I had this. Then for some time, Claire. Then this again. I think I- I prefer this vessel. And I guess it’s stuck with me.”
“You’re an idiot. Why the fuck didn’t you duck?!”
‘Mm. Here. Put this on.” Dean says, getting his robe off him. Cas kisses him just below the hollow of his cheek and he leans in, the graze of lips lingering.
Dean doesn’t know how to answer him. Or
cool it.”
In the kitchen, Cas is already putting away the grocery. Dean starts chopping the store-bought tomatoes.
I mean, they’re not a guy, so.
“Hey, hey. Think about your family. Your wife. Kids. You missed ‘em?” she asks in a hushed tone.
Now that all the candles are blown, and Jack has fed each of them a piece of cake, Dean starts plating the pancakes. Behind him he hears Eileen swipe some frosting off the cake and smear it on Jack’s face, followed by Sam tutting. There’s a shriek of glee not seconds later, and Dean looks back to see Jack’s little palm covered with blue frost and an imprint on Sam’s cheek.
Cas withdraws his hand, a revelation coursing through him. It’s
Dean is dying and he’s thinking about his family, and family’s the word for it. Sure. His brother, they share blood. The son of Satan. Cas’ dead vessel’s biological daughter. A dog that’s, in a way, stolen. And Cas. That dork. Dean is dying, and he cringes at thinking like a thirteen-year-old, but what are they? Him and Cas. Boyfriends? Oh my god, are they
Cas simply tightens his arm around him, holding him in an awkward hug.
So Dean picked up some veggies,
The thing is, Dean’s not sure what he wants to wish for. He’s got everything he wants right here, and he’s content. He really is. But then again, he knows that’s not what this is about. It goes a little deeper. He’s self-aware like that.
” he mumbles, and Cas tightens his fingers around the seal, the light hitting him with cruelty, but it doesn’t hurt as much as the look on Dean’s face.
Cas looks at her, unsure, then fumbles with the menu some more.
Okay then. Cas’ voice drifts away, and Sam starts, but Dean’s not listening. See, Dean’s
Mary smiles back.
“Are you worried?” Dean asks, and before he asks he knows that yes, Cas is, and no, he won’t say so. So when Cas nods, he is surprised.
“Oh, you wanna talk to me now?”
“No”, Cas squares his shoulders, readying them for a fight. “Don’t end the conversation. Are you jealous?”
, I do.” Dean rubs his face furiously. “‘I thought you heard me in purgatory. You
and forces himself to look away. He can’t. He stands, almost as lifeless as him on the table, as Dean tears the yellow curtains Cas chose at the store an hour away and wraps him ready for his funeral. Every so often, Dean has to brace himself against the table, the simple task of tying a body herculean and wrecking.
Dean tightens his robe around his waist and scratches the back of his neck as he saunters into the kitchen. It’s cold in here, he thinks, and doesn’t think anything else about it. Reaching out for two identical mugs that read #1 DAD, he sets the coffee. Then, he reaches on the top shelf, and gets the jar of raw honey, and adds a spoonful to one of the mugs. In the other, he drops two cubes of sugar. Then he gets the wooden tray out, the one that came with the 24 piece cutlery set that Donna? Or Garth? Yeah,
Mary looks at Claire, again, now that she’s closer. Her eyes are the same color as Cas, their nose structure the same. There’s a tear streak from the corner of an eye, blackened at the corner and wiped in fury. She is beautiful, and she has the same face as Cas, but all Mary sees is Dean. Dean, her little girl Deanna, her big son Dean.
Dean’s eyes snap open. “And?”
Cas tightens his grip on his wrist and cups his face. “You got me Dean.”
He stops when he sees a fat drop on Cas’ eyelashes. When he feels his own eyes tear up, he squeezes their hands again, not as much for Cas as for himself.
“Okay”, Cas says, and gets up.
“Aww, how old are they?”
“I actually
“It’s alright.” Cas says, pressing another kiss to his bottom lip, then sucking on it. “I’m sorry too. That was immature.”
The words sting, and it’s a nice burn. Cas repeats, “You got me.” The dam breaks again, and Dean wipes his nose on his sleeve. Throws his head on Cas shoulder, “Tell me I can have you, Cas.”

Dean scoffs again, less show this time.
to go any closer than he already is, but
each big enough for two dudes. What a waste.
. Sometimes Dean thinks Cas has it worse than him, is dumber, probably more repressed, even, but that would be stretching it.

And the way Cas looks at him, Dean knows the answer. Knows what Cas is going to say, and he agrees, he really does, but he hates it too. Hates it so much. Wipes his face, tears and snot on his sleeve again, and drops his head to Cas’ shoulder.

Cas backs off in disbelief, mouth opening, then closing, like a little puffer fish, if you will, then slaps a hand where it hurts.
Cas starts unbuttoning Dean’s shirt and skates a palm around his chest to assess the damage, which is just redenned skin, “Fuck,
himself. And Dean, who’s holding his face.
“Are they gonna be awhile?” Mary asks, breaking the silence.
Mary glances at Dean, who is looking at her, but averts his eyes and swallows when she catches him. He grips the steering wheel tighter. Accelerates.
“It was, wasn’t it?” Dean smirks. “How ‘bout we make it up to each other?”
Dean’s smirk is so wide now that his jaw must ache from all the jaw wide smiling he’s doing, so Cas kisses him. An open mouthed, slow kiss. Dean sways even further into his space, taking Jack with.
Cas only spares a glare at Dean, but Dean can see how the square of his shoulders are drooping. See, Dean
I’m doing?”
As it turns out, Ralph takes a liking to Dean, which feels like a win as well as a defeat to the latter. The make-up sex, though, before and after that little guy comes home- let’s just say people are still right about it being fan-fucking-tastic, but thrice a week is a bit much for Cas’, and, let’s be fair, Dean’s old bones.
Cas chuckles to himself, the sight of Dean and Jack rolling their eyes at Sam’s green smoothies in his head. The next lines are underlined in pencil.
Dean closes his eyes, and Cas exhales a
The thing is, Cas doesn’t remember this. Maybe something to do with Naomi, but he really doesn’t remember walking into the water, hands held out in a T.
Dean chokes on a sob. “And. And I can-” Another sob. “Can I have you?”
Cas sobers up too; his face, that is.
“Huh?”
Okay. Cas has to go back. He has to leave. They can find a new way to extract his grace, it’s a purely selfish thought, but he doesn’t care. He doesn’t want to,
It took him not long enough to separate
He clears his throat, suddenly a little embarrassed. "Uh, it was, uh.. rebar." He mumbles. Charlie's eyebrows shoot up and she almost chokes on her drink.
He never returns empty handed, though. He constantly brings back flowers or stones for Dean.
. Most of those comments came from other angels, who he once considered family. But being told you're a fuck up and the reason everything goes wrong by the one person you love more than anything?
them.
"I said I was coming for you, sweetheart," Dean's voice drips with poison.
They quickly developed a routine, Castiel making a garden all around the perimeter of the house and Dean getting a part-time job in town as a mechanic. They cooked together and still had movie nights every Saturday, even if Dean always fell asleep.
It's silent for a moment, the two just staring at each other, just like old times.
He could feel Sam's eyes on him, concerned, but he didn't care. He needed to get to room with a bottle of whiskey. With his eyes glued to the floor, he made his way to the stairs. He had taken his first step when he heard Sam gasp.
He is
Dean has always been Castiel's best friend. Hell, Castiel has only ever really had Sam and Dean. Briefly, there was his friendship with Kelly Kline. He smiles bitterly at the thought of her. He is still grateful that he was never able to go through with killing her. He wouldn't have been able to experience her friendship.
see Dean when he’s like this, so utterly broken, and he can’t see himself being the reason for it. The seal digs into the palm of his flesh, the way he clenches it shut, but nothing happens. He tightens his fist, but, nope. Nothing.
Dean smiles. “Very.”
It’s a bizarre scene, Cas is right in front of Dean, and he’s also both alive and dead. He’s in the past alright, but he’s a few years further down the lane. There’s an angel blade sticking out of his torso, and Dean’s shaking him, cupping his face. Perhaps he is invisible to them, which is good, actually, because this is not where he’s supposed to land.
pulls him towards. Cas is here, and he can change the course of time, but he’s in a sick game, invisible and hence absent.
“You had your hand on her shoulder, Cas!”
Dean chuckles. There’s no humor, none. He continues. “Yeah. Yeah. But I don't have no hope left, Cas. So I just- I need you to tell me. I
, but
is how it ends, what was the fucking point of it all?
. Hell if he’s gonna confess that at breakfast. Wouldn’t be him if he did.
The car is quiet, no music to fill the space, and both Cas and Mary watch Dean walk over to Claire. When he’s there, he opens his arms and Claire almost throws herself at him, clutching the back of his shirt in her fists. Mary looks at Cas, a little uncertain, and Cas’ eyes crinkle, something soft and wistful. When they’re walking back to the car, Dean talking, with his arm around her shoulder protectively, Mary takes in her appearance. She has blonde, long hair, wrapped in two pigtails. Her navy t-shirt is layered over with a darker flannel shirt, outfit finished with combat boots beneath her dark wash jeans. She looks just like Dean.
Cas harrumphs, scrubbing a pan furiously, making Dean smirk.
Cas nods. “Yes. I’m ‘up for it’. He is, really. It’s a small ritual, and it will help him effectively get rid of any remaining grace in his body. He chances a glance at Dean, who’s staring intently at the book in front of him, eyes hardly moving.
Are you hearing yourself? How does that- Dean, listen” Cas restarts, taking of his glasses and pinching the bridge of his nose, as if Dean’s being really obtuse right now. He’s not. He’s
e too was a teenage girl.”
“You look like you’re having the time of your life.” Dean quips. Jack coos.
What hurts though, is the fall. He falls on his ass, and he recognizes his surroundings immediately. It’s the back of the cabin he fled to with Kelly, before Jack was born. It’s dark, evening settling into night, and Cas has a faint idea of what’s to happen. The rip in the universe is glowing a sharp golden, and within moments, Sam is pulling Dean through, holding him with force. There’s some resistance from Dean, freeing himself from Sam’s hold, but then Cas sees himself walk through the rift, and he doesn’t really see the angel blade being stabbed into himself, because Dean’s scream of a
“Okay. I’m- I’m ready when you are.”
Dean turns to face him from the other bed and sees Cas with his back propped on the headboard, feet stretched and ankles crossed, and from where Dean sees him, there’s an awry halo around his hair. “Did they not have a third room?”
His life almost flashes before his eyes. But his chest feels tight and then his stomach feels funny and, --and where
The timeline is warped, and Cas makes a mental note to give Sam a piece of his mind. He’s standing at a lake this time, which is actually more of a water reserve. There’s nobody around, and then he sees- himself, again. It’s not
“What about them?” Cas’ questions, sitting on the edge of his bed with his hands in his lap.

, crowding him. “Mmhm. So grumpy.”
Dean begs, “Don’t do this, Cas,” but there’s no hope in his pleading. He
you to tell me.”
Today, they’ll get the tomato seeds, and to go with, some expensive smelly fertilizers. A few more pots, ‘cause there are never enough, and two sunflowers cut from the stem, one for Cas and one for Jack.
Cas doesn’t see anything but Dean’s face, eyebrows scrunching in concern and he lets his body fall on Dean’s when they’re close enough, the seal in his hand falling with a clink on the floor. Dean holds him, doesn’t ask why he’s crying, just. Holds him. Rubs his back in slow, soothing circles, and murmurs quiet assurances in his hair.
“I think making up is definitely in order,” says Cas, already pulling off his sweater.
Jack hums, as if that’s a valid enough wish, and looks up at Dean. “Dee?”
“I had a daughter.” She explains. “A son. A husband who didn’t know shit about the kind of lives we hunters have.” Cas stiffens in front of her, his hand on the table clenching into a fist. “And I don’t even remember dying but here I am. And nothing’s the same.”
he thinks with an exasperated fondness. Right now, it's Jack asking all of them to make wishes as he blows the four candles and a slightly bigger 4-shaped candle, one for everyone present at the breakfast table.
In his moments of dying, it is understandable that all he can think about is Baby. He thinks about running his fingers along the black metal of her hood, the eyes that followed her when she pulled into town, the smell of leather,
Claire bites into a fry, then smirks. “Dean, you dress up just like your Mom.”
But, that’s not the point. The point is, that his best friend is discovering himself, and a kid he loves came out to him today, and he has a mom who doesn’t get it. Who with just one word, can hurt them all if she chooses to.
They sit on little yellow and orange round mats, shoulders brushing. Cas sips his coffee, steam still swirling out in cursive wisps, while Dean’s mug waits for the drink to cool. Sam’s coming over this evening, to pick up a few books from the library. If Dean promises dinner, maybe he’ll bring Eileen. It could be a nice family dinner. Yeah. There are patties in the freezer, he just has to make a run for buns.
Dean shifts uncomfortably on his heels. Turns to Sam and says, “Well, he got dinged,” and then looking back at Cas, “And, uh, you. I made a deal with her. Said she wouldn't get kabobed if she brought you back. She brought you back.”
“Because it

“Mmhmm.” Cas nods.
he remembers Dean telling him, his head pillowed on Cas’ chest, as they watched Toy Story for the third time that week. Jack does, is the thing, but he’s also so much like Dean, and equally as much as Sam, and sometimes Cas can see a bit of Eileen in him.
And then Mom asked him if John made him do it. And she looked so- so
Dean spins around. “I wouldn’t
Heh, as if Dean’s telling him.
“I need you to tell me Cas. We may not have....time after this. This...this thing with Chuck...I don't think- this might be it.” Dean tries. He tries to tell Cas.

Eileen goes next, and she ruffles Jack’s hair after she makes her wish. Dean nudges Sam to go next, and he does, tucking his hair behind his ear and pressing his lips together as he murmurs something inaudible.
Dean immediately clutches his side, proclaiming a loud “Ow!” that has Cas rushing over to him in three quick strides. The bottom of his shirt is dripping too, Dean sees, but for now he preens in the way Cas’ hand cups his skin, under his shirt. The ceramic mug lies there on the floor in three pieces now, amber liquid all over the platforms and the floor.
“I wish it was you Cas. Hell of an awkward ride.”

Cas shakes his head, but he’s smiling too. He takes Dean’s hand in his, flattening their palms together, and tracing the crevices on Dean’s with his index finger. Eyes fixed at where their hands are together, Cas says, “I wasn’t flirting with her, Dean.” Dean tips his head up again, and it’s Cas who initiates the kiss this time, only breaking off to repeat, “I really wasn’t. I
The bowl glimmers with a faint bluish-purple light, and Sam nods subtly, “Now.”
? Really?”
Dean holds his arms out, and goes back to separate the vegetables.
“Hmm?”
“Dean,” Cas says, and Dean sits up, makes space for him on his bed, “Mary’s- she doesn’t understand, and that’s hardly her fault.”
“You didn’t want help then, why the hell would you want it now?!”
Jack let a slight sigh of relief slip through his lips when he spotted the familiar black Impala. “There,” Jack pointed to Baby. The two girls jogged to the car. Jack turned, putting his focus on the building that his family was in. He saw Dean, Sam, and Cas jogging through the doorway. Jack smiled at the sight of them, Dean giving a reassuring fist pump to the air. Their smiles turned to sudden looks of alarm as a scream filled the air. Whipping around to see four vamps, two of them holding Wendy and Veronica, smiling darkly, Jack’s demeanor shifted to match the rest of the team. Sparing you the details, Wendy and Veronica died. Bloody. Jack killed the two vampires that took their lives in a fit of pure sorrow and anger. Sam and Castiel beheaded the other two. That ride home was long and silent.
Sam sighed. “What?”, the oldest questioned, noticing his brother’s new troubled demeanor. Shifting in his seat, Sam stammered a bit, trying to find the right words to say. “They’re- They’re just so young Dean,” Dean straightened up, sighing as he did so. “I mean, that kid we just spoke to couldn’t have been older than 18...what’re they doing hunting?” The two rode in silence for a few yards, then Dean said gruffly, “It doesn’t matter, alright? Nobody chooses this, Sam.” Sam began to protest, when Dean cut him off. “It doesn’t matter what family they have, or how old they are, or why they’re freakin’ hunting in the first place! But, we’re gonna make sure nothing happens to those kids... We could have them check in with us, or heck, let em live in the bunker, we sure have the rooms, but nothing’s gonna happen to those kids.” Sam leaned back in his seat, the purr of the engine being the only thing cutting the silence. The quiet agreement from Sam and the determination radiating off of Dean assured the seriousness of the oldest brother’s last statement.
Alice slowly nodded, exhaling faintly to herself as they continued down the passageway to her room. Dean rounded the corner, the sound of their feet on the concrete floor echoing softly. “That kid in there, he’s a nephilim. Now I know that might sound-” Dean began to explain, but Alice cut him off. “Yeah, Benji’s really into all that stuff. Angels and crap.” Dean nodded, surprised that a sixteen year old kid would be interested in Angels and their half human kids. Dean stopped at Alice’s room. She stepped into the small bedroom, but she turned on her heel before she closed the door. “Dean,” She called to the man starting off down the hallway. Dean turned to meet her. “Thanks… Really, thank you.” Dean smiled warmly at her. “No problem, kid.” Alice shut the door and she fell asleep seconds after her head hit the pillow.
Meanwhile, Dean and Castiel had run into three vamps, fighting them off as best they could. One of them turned and ran down the hall, catching Castiel’s attention. “Dean!”, he shouted. Dean decapitated the monster in front of him and sprinted down the hallway after the other. He saw Sam and Jack, running swiftly through the corridor with two girls, the vampire tailing them closely. “Sam!”, Dean yelled. Sam turned just in time to block the vampire’s swing, shoving its back into the tiled wall. “Jack, get them out of here!”, Sam choked out, the monster’s hand on his throat. Dean came from behind and ripped the thing away from his brother. Jack turned to Wendy and Veronica and ushered them to the exit. They burst through the door, slowing their pace slightly.
A teal-haired young woman sat in a dimly lit motel room. The older of two siblings sat up, snatching a small steel blade from the side-table and twirling it between her fingers. The lock on the door rattled as the handle turned. A young male, soft brown eyes and loosely curly, short, dark blonde hair that slightly fell in his face, walked through the door with grocery bags in his hands. “I got you the orange soda you wanted. I also picked up some allergy medicine, you ran out the other day.” He walked past his sister, setting down the bags on the table and unpacking them. “I don’t need allergy medicine, Benji.” She said in an irritated tone. Benjiman pulled a case of sodas from the bag and set it in the small fridge. “Yeah you do, Alice.”
Not an uncomfortable silence, but a quiet chunk of time where everyone in the room had a heavy heart. They all stared at each other for a brief second before Dean began to speak again. “And Benji is just-- I don’t know, he just seems scared.” Sam nodded. Cass spoke up. “I’ll be happy to help with them.” Dean smiled. Jack nodded swiftly. “I can’t wait to hang out and talk and laugh and tell each other our favorite colors and-” Sam laughed at Jack’s innocence. “Alright, calm down Sparky,” Dean chuckled. Jack shut his mouth slowly, looking somewhat disappointed. “Now, I know that having these two here is new and we might want to throw a million questions at them, but they just got here. And from what Alice told Dean and me, they’ve been through a lot.”, Sam said in a calm tone.
Dean stood and walked over to Alice, putting a hand on her shoulder, and said, “You were angry. When people get angry they say crap they don’t mean.” Dean stared into Alice’s crystal blue eyes, until she nodded and gave a small ‘you’re right’. Sam walked to the door, silently letting Dean know he’d be back. Sam stepped into the outdoor hallway, his head moving left to right in search for the other Foster. He heard sniffling coming from down the stairs.
Male disappearances? The local law enforcement caught the culprit. Grave robberies? Turned out to be a couple of teenagers in a prank war. Sam walked through the doorway into the kitchen. “Mornin’ sunshine,” Dean sat at the table, a mug of black coffee in hand. He had gotten up at around eight that morning.
“I walked in and the pan was on fire in the- in the bathroom. He had crap all over him.” Benji’s eyes got wide, jolting forward. “And when I saw you two you were covered in sauce and smoke was everywhere! And you two looked like guilty
The nightmare he had left him shaken and scared. Benji cleared his throat and said to Jack, “I-I’m sorry, my name’s Benji.” He finally introduced himself after a few minutes. He was unhappy with the fact that he hadn’t met the other two people that inhabited the bunker. He was just so exhausted that he fell asleep immediately. Jack continued to smile, happy that he was making a friend. “It’s ok. I’m Jack. Nice to meet you.” Benji let himself smile a little. He was happy he was making a friend too. “Who was the other guy?” Jack laughed quietly. “That’s Cass. He’s an angel. He’s really nice.” Benji looked up at Jack. He loved angels. Well, the research of angels. Alice would joke that he was obsessed with it, that it was the only thing supernatural he was interested in.
Both Fosters sat anxiously in the small room. The roar of the Impala sounded through the runned down space, signaling that someone had arrived. Shivers went down Benji’s spine, Alice’s nerves showing slightly as her leg began to bounce in place. A knock at the door grabbed the attention of both young adults. Alice made eye contact with her brother, took a deep breath, and went to open the door. Sam held his head down and Dean seemed to do the same. They too were slightly nervous to meet the other people that sat in the room. When the door opened, Sam and Dean shot their heads up in the direction of the person responsible for the door’s opening. They were slightly surprised to find a young woman standing in the doorway. Alice straightened her back and said in the calmest tone she could muster, “Come on in.” After the brothers had stepped through the door, they spotted Benji, who stood up swiftly at the sight of the other hunters.
She stared into her own icy blue eyes. Those eyes were cold and hardened. She had spent so long taking care of her brother that those eyes that were once a soft baby blue and full of energy were now an icy grey blue color. Alice didn’t bother to change out of the clothes from yesterday. She tugged at the green and black flannel that hung at her side. She pushed the door open and walked to the kitchen, finding the boys waiting there.
Benji still looked 4 years old in the back of the Impala, the same dreamy look and the same soft noise he would make. And just like she always would do, Alice squeezed his shoulder softly and said, “Come on, Benje. Let’s go bud.” He nodded, stepping out of the car and following the Winchesters to the bunker’s entrance. Dean opened the heavy door, seeing Cas and Jack sitting in the library. Cass rose to greet them, stopping in his tracks when he saw the Fosters.
After packing their bags, they all met up in the library. Dean cleared his throat. “So. I can take three other people, not including Sammy.” Cass ended up going with the boys and Jack volunteered to go with the Fosters, then Benji asked, “Do you guys have any extra cars?” Benji wasn’t normally into cars, but Alice never let him drive so he wanted to check some cars out. “Yeah, there’s a door to the garage down the hall and to the left.” Sam pointed down the hall and Benji swiftly walked in that direction.
So, first published fanfic. I'm open to any suggestions or criticism! Hope you guys enjoy!
He found Benji crouched in the stairwell with his knees to his chest. Sam sighed, deciding to tell Benji some information he would probably like to hear. “So, uhh, your sister agreed to stay with us for a bit.” Benji took a deep breath, pulling himself up to stand in front of the younger of the two Winchesters. After a quick agreement that both Fosters would go to the bunker, both Sam and Benji traveled back to the motel room. Benji and Alice packed their things and stuffed both of their duffle bags in the back of the Impala. Shutting the trunk, Dean grinned at Sam. Benji opened the back door, sliding inside. Alice joined him behind Sam’s seat. She looked at her brother, long and sincere, and quietly said, “Benje, I’m sorry…” She turned her attention to the floor when Benji punched her lightly in the arm, causing her to stare at him in surprise. “It’s fine, Alice. You always were the bonehead.” Benji chuckled lightly at the end of his sentence, smiling happily at his sister.
Benji grinned and went to work, hands and arms flying everywhere. First he started with the egg whites, cooking them up and plating them, green chives providing small pops of color. Benji handed it to Sam swiftly. The Moose took a bite, the other Bunker Boys eagerly watching. Sam closed his eyes, humming in satisfaction. “Oh. My. God.” Benji, already back at the counter, smiling widely. He cooked up the two angel’s omelette, adding a few extra sprinkles of cheese in theirs. Lastly, he made the Heart Attacks on a plate. He threw in two fist-fulls of cheese and bacon bits into the mix. After everyone had their food, they all sat at the kitchen table. The breakfast was silent, everyone enjoying their food.
At the time, Eli was 20, Alice was 17, and Benjiman was 12. Eli held his sister back from going in, guns-a-blazing, and instead told her to learn the basics of hunting. He comforted Benji while he was grieving heavily. Now, Alice was 21 and her brother was 16. Eight months before his fourteenth birthday, Benji had wanted to go along with his brother and sister to kill a ghoul, but Eli had told him to stay behind. Benji could handle himself. Or at least that’s what Benji thought. He left in the middle of the night, sneaking out to take care of the ghoul on his own.
“Really?” Benji asked in wonder. “Yep. And I’m a nephilim.” Jack replied with no interest in his voice. Benjamin stared at him. “Awesome!” He said with excitement. Jack smiled again. He just couldn’t seem to stop doing that when he talked to Benji. He thought Benji was nice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Benji laid, face down, on his bed. Both of them were tired and slightly discouraged after dead ends, false leads, and books on books of extra lore. Alice sat in the kitchen, eating cheez-its and drinking her third can of orange soda. Benji’s phone buzzed on the table as he threw his arm around, and finally grabbing it. “Hello?” Benjiman said groggily. Dean made eye contact with Sam. “Yeah hi, is this Agent Cobalt?” Benji shot up in his bed, straightening his stature and clearing his throat. “Y-yes! Uh- Yes this is Agent Cobalt.” Dean stifled a laugh as Sam took the phone. “This is Agents Jagger and Murry. We're calling to see which home office sent you out.” The color drained from the young man's face as he scrambled to his sister. Shoving the phone in his shoulder, he harshly whispered, “Alice!” Alice looked up from a book. “FBI” Benji hissed.
Dean and Sam shared a glance at each other, happy the two of them were alright, and seeing so much of themselves in the two siblings seated in the back of the black muscle car. After just over 5 hours of driving through the night, Dean glanced at the back seat. He saw Benji leaned against the door fast asleep and Alice sitting with earbuds in, looking out the window and nodding her head along to the music. They arrived at the bunker, the engine shutting off and the brothers rising out of the car. Alice shook Benji’s shoulder lightly. He lifted his head and let out a small whimper-like noise and Alice smiled at him.
“What can I do for you, gentlemen?”, she asked with her hands on her hips. “Those two agents, we’re tailing behind them, making sure everything goes smoothly. Agents Jagger and Murry. Could you give us the card the agent handed to you?” After a flash of a badge, the sheriff handed the card over to Dean. “You don’t have to worry about much, Agent. Real nice young man. Don’t know how I feel about that girl though...” Sam smiled awkwardly. “Yeah, solid recruits this year.” Once through the door, Dean scoffed. “They looked twelve. Come on, Sam, they can’t be hunters.” Sam raised a brow, studying the card. “I dunno, Dean. I mean that was some pretty swift thinking. And you heard what Agent-” Sam paused and read the name on the business card. “Cobalt said to his partner when they were leaving.” Dean sighed as he opened the car door. “Well, let’s give ‘Agent Cobalt’ a ring. See if he’s the real deal.”
“Crap!” Alice huffed. Dean leaned to the phone, hearing every whisper and smiling at the panic of the young hunters. “Listen kid, we know you're not FBI.”, Dean said in a lighter tone. Benji turned to Alice, who just shrugged her shoulders and said quietly, “They’ve gotta be hunters too right?” Sam exchanged a look of slight confusion mixed with amusement with his brother as Dean asked, “What motel are you staying in?” Benji pondered whether or not to tell this strange guy that had somehow gotten their number, and somehow knew they were hunters, their location. Then, the memory of the last time he had denied someone’s help and went on his own hit him like a train. The image of his oldest sibling flashed in his mind. He couldn’t make that mistake again. “Fire-Engine-Red, down I-90, room 307.” Alice sat up, the choice her brother had made grabbing her attention. The Winchester brothers nodded to each other. “We’ll be there in ten minutes.” The call ended, cut off on the other line.
He was torn to shreds, hellhound gashes running along his chest. “Eli-” Benji whispered. He looked to him with cold, empty eyes. He moved to him with inhuman speed and came to grab his shirt collar. He was lifted onto his tip toes, Eli’s nose almost touching his. The blood that had covered him vanished. He stared at his brother with dialated pupils in terror. He looked like a broken husk then. Not the Eli that Benji had loved so much. All he said to him was four quiet words, “This is your fault.” Benji shook his head, closing his eyes. Eli dropped him and disappeared into the void. When Benji opened his eyes, his hands and arms were again drenched in thick blood. His chest began to ploom with crimson. His mouth filled with the taste of iron. He dropped his jaw and the metallic flavor poured out like a cursed fountain. Benji let out one last call, “I’m sorry!” Darkness. Pure darkness engulphed him again.
Thick, grey smoke billowed to the ceiling, earning a chuckle from Sam and a scoff from Castiel. Alice nudged Benji with her shoulder. “You gotta cook for these guys sometime, huh?” She smiled at her brother sweetly. He grinned as he stared at the smoke. “Yeah...guess I do.” Dean had been worried over his black brick of omlett, until Benji decided to step forward. The young man out stretched his hand, signalling for the pan. “May I?” He asked simply. Dean shook his head, handing over the burnt food, and saying in the most defeated voice. “Have at it kid.” Sam, along with Castiel, had grown curious of what Benji was going to do with the ruined breakfast and a smokey kitchen. “What’s he doing?” Jack asked as Benji threw the pan in the sink, letting it soak in soapy water before whipping around to the fridge. Benji pulled out the carton of eggs, colby-jack cheese, butter, chives, and a half-empty bag of bacon bits. He attempted to take it all in one trip, but he took one look at the eggs and decided he should make two.

"We don’t need your help!” She yelled. Sam turned his face to the floor, the awkward silence filling the room. Alice looked up at her brother, who was also not enjoying the tension in the room. “Benji, tell them.” Benji glanced at Alice’s fuming stature, then back at his hands. “I-...I think we should go with them.” Alice stood, radiating with a new found anger. Her brother was supposed to side with her, not two strangers that he had just met. “What?”, she said harshly. Benji scooted to the edge of the bed. “We’ve been struggling lately, Alice.” Alice stepped forward, getting closer to her brother. “Ok, sure, we stay in crap motels and live off of orange soda and take-out, but we are not a charity case.” Benji stood up, his sister about 5 inches from him, turning to the side to look at the Winchesters. “Alice, please.” He said almost pleadingly. He needed her to get on board. Just this once, he needed her to follow his lead, to let him make the right choice. Sam and Dean sat, watching the two and feeling sudden empathy for them. “No, Benji!” Alice’s rage filling her, blinding her, stopping her from thinking her words through and causing her to let the wrong ones slip.
Everyone in the bunker was already awake, except for Benji and Alice. They were sitting in the kitchen, Sam leaning against the counter in the same place Benji was the night before. Dean was at the stove, making some rather questionable omelets. Cass sat, smiling warmly, at the table watching Dean cook. Jack was seated at the table in the chair across from Castiel. Alice woke up first, swinging her feet over the side of the bed and standing up. She yawned and stretched her arms out. Alice walked to the small bathroom that was attached to her room, rubbing her face and looking at herself in the mirror.
Dean and Sam sat, though both of them didn’t know the story, they knew whatever was just said was a sore subject. Alice let go of Benji’s shoulder, immediately regretting what she had done. She gasped softly. “Benji, I’m sorry. I-I didn’t mean that. Really, I-” She stuttered in soft tone, one she didn’t use often. Benjiman turned so that he was toe-to-toe with Alice, their noses almost touching. “Let me make the right choice. Eli’s dead, because-- because of me. I couldn’t make the right choice.” Benji half-whispered, his voice breaking and his eyes glossing over. He turned on his heel sharply and started to walk to the door. Alice grabbed his wrist. “Benje…” She said softly. Without turning to look at her, Benjiman said through gritted teeth. “Let. Go.” Ripping his hand from Alice’s grip, and storming out of the small motel room, he let tears fall.
“Kid, that...you’ve gotta make this every morning.” Benji smiled happily at Dean. Alice cleared her throat, leaning forward. “Yep, he’s the chef of the family. God knows Eli and I couldn’t cook.” Benji nodded vigorously. Alice nudged Benji in the arm, chuckling. “You remember that time I caught him cooking?” Benji began to giggle. “Yes. Dear god, yes.” Alice began laughing a little harder. “It-It was your birthday, a-and he wanted to make that shrimp alfredo!” Alice was beginning to laugh so hard she had to take breaks between parts of the story. Dean was smiling at Sam, enjoying the story. Everyone was eager to hear this anecdote.
* * *
Alice huffed, standing and walking to the kitchen. She rustled through the bags, fishing out a pack of gummy worms. She tore into them and stuffed a handful in her mouth. Alice looked up from the bag to find her younger brother staring at her, shaking his head and continuing to put away the few groceries that were bought. “So, we’re looking into the animal attacks, right?” Alice walked back into the main room. She sighed. “Someone else will take care of it. I think we should put this stuff in the cooler and head out.” Benji had been eager to take on cases for a few months.
They all had a tough time getting to sleep, Dean laying in bed next to Cass staring at the ceiling for hours. Jack had closed his eyes but every time he would start to drift away, excitement would grip him again. Sam was on his side, just blankly gazing into his wall. Alice was sleeping lightly, every little sound waking her through the night. Benji was the only one that had gotten decent sleep. Until the moment he didn’t.
Benji shifted his weight. “Well, I’m gonna try to go back to sleep.” Jack nodded. “Ok,” was all he said. With that Benji walked back to his room and slept lightly through the rest of the night, as did Jack.
Benji's handling just fine. Dean can't cook. Jack makes a friend.
“Vampires? They- They aren’t real...they can’t be real…” Jack sighed and looked up at her. He always felt bad when people had to know the truth. To him, it seemed like when they were told about what’s really out there, their whole world falls to pieces. Their faces fall and they stutter through questions like they need to know everything they can about monsters and what goes bump in the night. “We’re gonna get you both out of here, okay?” The woman kept her shocked expression as she nodded slightly. Jack continued to check her for any other wounds. “Can you tell me your name?” He asked in a soft tone. “Wendy. M-My name’s Wendy. That’s Veronica. We were just walking home from a debate team meeting. Then those guys...they took us and the next thing I know, we’re here.” Wendy’s eyes filled with tears as she recalled the incident. The young girl stared at her hands, a few tears slipping. Jack put his hands on hers, staring into her eyes. “My friend and I, we’re gonna make sure you and Veronica are safe. Promise.” Sam patted Jack’s shoulder, signaling that it was time to get the two girls out and to the Impala.
Eli, the oldest of the Fosters, had kept them together after the passing of their parents. First, it was their mother. Sarah Foster was killed by a nest of vampires when Benji was just two months old. Alice was five and Eli was eight. They were rushed out of the house by their father, he was yelling at them, barking directions. Eli ran through the door with his brother in his arms and Alice trailing close behind. They were hunters ever since. Then, the same vamp came back for their dad. All Benji could remember was wandering aimlessly, looking for him. He had walked up and down so many streets he had lost count. When he finally saw his father, on his knees in the middle of the street, he jogged to him until he got about halfway to him when Benji stopped. “Benjiman, go!” His Dad screamed at him as a vampire who had been waiting for him jumped from the corner. Benji ran as fast as his legs would take him. He was already sobbing when he got to his Dad. After that, Alice wanted to jump headfirst into hunting, blinded by reckless rage and revenge.
Jack's feeling like a part of the family. Cass is a happy dad. Benji doesn't wanna talk about it.
“Wh-”, Cass stammered. Dean held his hand up, saying to the two young adults behind him, “I’ll show you your rooms. You might wanna get some sleep tonight; we’ll catch up in the morning.” Benji and Alice followed, the young Foster in a sleepy daze as Dean led them to his room. When Benji was shown his room, he walked in and flopped on his bed. Alice laughed and Dean chuckled. As they walked down the hallway of the bunker, Dean asked Alice over his shoulder, “So, that guy in the trenchcoat is Castiel, he’s an angel.” Alice snapped her head up and stopped walking for a moment, her eyebrows furrowed. All she provided was a curious hum in response. Dean sighed, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. “Yeah… he might be a little weird but he uh-- he’ll warm up to you.” A small smile krept on Dean’s lips at the ending of his sentence.
Dean walked back to the library, finding Sam talking to Cass and Jack. Sam looked up as Dean walked into the room. Sam had already talked to Castiel and Jack, explaining everything to him. Cass had been quiet which made Sam uneasy. Jack’s eyes went wide when Sam explained it all. He was excited to have new friends, he always was. But these two new friends were more his age. What Jack really meant was he wanted people that weren’t angels or demons or middle age hunters that were only interested in loud laughter and chugging beer. Dean came to sit in the chair next to Cass. He sighed heavily. “Alice, the older kid, when I took her to her room…” Dean shot Sam a quick glance, then he met his angel’s eyes for a moment, then his eyes went unfocused. “She just looked so exhausted.” Dean paused for a moment and the room went quiet.
“I’m Alice, this is my baby brother Benji.” Alice gestured to Benji, a small smirk displayed on her lips. Benjiman shot her a look of annoyance and embarrassment. “Five years, Alice, you don’t have to keep calling me your ‘baby’ brother.” Benji said through gritted teeth, holding a straight face as Dean chuckled. “Sit down.” He said, both Foster siblings and Sam taking a seat. Sam and Benji on one bed, Alice taking a seat beside Dean. “I don’t know you, you don’t know me, but I’m Dean and this is my brother Sam. We’re gonna help you out.” Alice stared at her hands, looking up as Dean made his last statement. “Thanks, but we’re fine on our own.” Sam hesitated then said, “Listen we know you’ve probably been on your own for a while but we just want to make sure nothing happens to yo-” Alice cut him off, growing more frustrated.
He was itching for a new case. Anything to get his mind off of what happened in Delaware. Sam, Dean, Cas, and Jack had all teamed up for a particularly large nest of vamps. The four of them had a simple plan. Kill the two out front and once they get inside, Sam and Jack go left, Dean and Cas go right. Sam and Jack crept around the corner. Jack spotted two females in the corner, IVs running from their wrists. The Nephilim signaled to Sam as he ran to help. Jack woke up one of them, a blonde-haired woman with deep brown eyes. She looked at Jack groggily and whispered, “Wh-What are those things?” Jack began to take out the IV carefully so he didn’t hurt her. “They’re vampires.” The woman’s eyes grew as she pulled her back up quickly against the wall.
Dean and Sam had settled into their room, and were on their way to the local sheriff’s department to filter through some “routine” questions. Turning off the ignition, Dean fished his fake badge out of his pocket and checked the name on it. After Sam had done the same, the boys got out of the car and started walking to the station. Dean was watching his feet as he walked, when Sam’s arm was flung across his chest. “What the heck?” Dean asked in an irritated tone, glaring at his brother. “Look,” Sam said as he pointed inside. Dean spotted two young-looking people. It seemed to be a brother and sister, both in suit-like attire. Sam and his brother exchanged glances, then walked swiftly inside. They crept around the corner, lurking just close enough to hear what the three were talking about.
“Benji!” Alice yelled. He dropped the glass, hearing it shatter and seeing the water spill on the floor. “I’ve been trying to get your attention for the past five minutes!” Benji shook his head, moving to pick up the glass. “Sorry…” He mumbled. Sam opened the door, sticking his head in. “Everything ok in here?” Alice nodded. “Yeah, I think so.” Sam opened the door all the way. “We’re gonna look over the case if you guys wanna join.” Alice told him they would, then watched the door shut. “Are you ok?” She questioned. Benji nodded, silently. Alice raised an eyebrow walking over to him. “No really. Because you’ve been jumpy and weird these past few days.” Benji walked past her, bumping into her shoulder as he walked through the door. “I’m fine.” He uttered. Alice stood alone in the motel room. She bent down to clean up the glass again. She was worried about her brother. He was all she had left and she wasn’t about to let him go.
The sounds of footsteps on the concrete sounded through the hallway. Benji was lost in his mind, oblivious to the person walking to the kitchen. Jack rounded the corner, stopping when he spotted Benji. Jack didn’t know what he thought of Benjiman yet, but he knew he wanted to be friends with him. He slowly stepped to the table. As Jack walked by Benji, Benji snapped his head up. “Oh! Uh-- Hey, sorry I just-” Benji stumbled over his words trying to apologize. Jack just smiled as he held up his hand. “It’s ok.”, he said simply. Benji relaxed himself a bit at Jack’s warmness. Jack just let the silence enter the room. It wasn’t uncomfortable, it was welcomed by both people in the room. Benji needed the silence.
Benji walked through the rows of cars. Some of them were high-tech and sleek with tons of buttons and controls. Others were “regular” cars. The Toyota Prius, Honda Civic, F-150s, and more of the boring vehicles that Benji passed by. In a small corner of the garage, Benji found a stash of older cars. He walked past an old Ford truck, wooden boards lining its bed. Other older cars were compiled together, many of them in amazing shape. Benji stopped in his tracks when he got to an old SUV. The car was a 1979 Jeep Cherokee, a soft blue color. The seats were tan and leather. It was perfect. Benji ran his hand along the hood, walking to the driver’s side and sliding into the seat, and placing his hands carefully on the steering wheel.
In the Cherokee, Jack was leaned forward in the backseat. Alice and Benji were belting a song, howling like dogs and grinning like madmen. The song ended with a final strum of the electric guitar, causing Alice to clap and laugh loudly and having her own drum solo on the dashboard. Benji glanced to his side and saw Alice’s solo. “Hey, hey, hey! Careful!”, Benji exclaimed. He pushed Alice’s hands off of the dash. Jack couldn’t help but see the parallel of Dean and Benji. Jack giggled to himself then, eager for Dean to ride shotgun with Benji. They were getting along so well that when they finally arrived, Jack began to pout. He could tell road trips with Benji and Alice were gonna be great.
Benjiman, on the other hand, was quiet and patient. He rarely got angry, unless it was for good reason. He was rational and smart. He listened to others and helped anyone that he could. He was soft and fragile, but push the wrong buttons and you’re in for a show. He often blamed himself for many things and he didn’t let go of unnecessary guilt. The weight on his shoulders would catch up to him, crush and destroy him. Those days when everything came crashing down, he would buy a separate room, lock himself in it, and spend the night reliving horrible memories. He would sob and cry, wishing things could just go back to the way they were. Alice grabbed her brothers shoulder, shouting in his face.
Benji shut the engine off and stepped out of the car, walking alongside his sister and friend to the open door. Jack put down his bag in the room he would be sharing with Sam and began to unpack. “So, how was the drive?”, Sam asked. “It was awesome!” Jack giggled. Sam stood by the kitchen. “Yeah?” Sam questioned. “Yeah! We sang and told stories and we stopped at this really weird gas station and-- It was just awesome!” Jack’s smile was wide and so were his eyes. Sam chuckled. “That’s great.”
About 90 minutes in, the old Jeep was filled with laughter and smiles. Jack had asked so many questions which led to stories that led to conversations that led to laughter. Dean, Sam, and Cass had already booked a few rooms and were  waiting for the three kids to get there. Dean grabbed his and Castiel’s bag, swinging one of them over his shoulder and taking them through the motel door. Castiel was leaning against the old table, flipping through a magazine with his brows furrowed. After throwing the bags onto the bed, Dean looked up at Cass.
Dean shared a look with Castiel. The kid broke his heart. Alice grabbed his shoulder, shaking him softly. “Come on, I found a case.” Alice looked at the other people in the room. “I figured it’d be best if we got to know each other over a case.” Dean and Sam nodded. “Yeah that sounds good.” Benji sniffled, wiping his eyes with his sleeve. “I-I’m gonna go get my stuff together.” His footsteps receding down the hall.
Eli threw his hands up and shouted, “You made a deal?” He stepped closer, leaving only inches between their noses. “Yes, Eli, I made a deal! I’m doing whatever it takes to get our brother back!” Alice took a shaky step back, letting the sorrow and fear slip into her voice. “Benjiman’s coming back, then we’ll be together again.” Eli stared at his feet, tears blurring his vision. “How long? How long do you have?” Alice stayed silent, not wanting to tell her brother. “How long, Alice?!” Eli said louder, his voice cracking. “Two years…”  Silence. Deafening silence. “No.”
After what seemed liked hours, Benji heard a faint whisper. He jumped at the sound. The whispers continued to grow until he could tell who the whispers belonged to. It was his mom. Or at least what he always imagined her voice to be when he thought of her. Benji turned on his heel, frantically looking around for her. Her voice slowly faded into the black ink of the empty world around him. Benji tried to call out to her, but the only sound that had escaped his throat was a hoarse whisper, a raspy exclimation. “Mom?”, he called.
Wow...sorry if it's a little shorter but I'm gonna try and keep the chapters to a 1,000 word minimum! Please leave a comment if you have any suggestions or criticism!
“Mornin'’” Dean grumbled, trying to mask the gazing looks from the other three people in the room with a lighthearted greeting. Alice gave a small nod to him, staring at Castiel and Jack, then at Sam. She turned her head when she heard Benji walking down the hall. He stepped into the kitchen, giving a small smile to Jack as he did. Alice brightened immediately when she saw him.
The other Cas holds his bloody palm to Dean’s shoulder, who follows the movement with his eyes, and Cas keels over. The empty appears, in all of its glory that promises nothingness and nothing else, and Dean grabs the palm, now smearing blood on his neck.
Whatever, man.”
His own cheeks are warm now, streaked with a single tear, but Cas reaches out and wipes Dean’s face with his fingers. Uncertainly, but with a hell lot of love. Dean waits for him to say something. Say something or push him away. Cas does neither. He keeps running his fingers on Dean’s cheekbone.
Cas’ eyes widen just a bit, and he sits upright. “I’ll- I’ll request the management to arrange something. I’m sorry, I thought, I thought it’d be okay for me to-”
Okay, not flips. “It’s just turbulence.” the woman consoles him, but it’s not like he can handle it. “Think about things that make you happy”, she tells him, and she’s the expert here, so he does. He thinks about Sammy, Eileen tucked against his side, giggling. He thinks of Claire teaching Jack how snapchat works, while Miracle fits himself in her lap. He thinks of Cas. Castiel. That dork. With eyes the damnedest blue,
, is torture.
Bobby walks towards him, his voice comforting. If Cas knew better, he’d say it was sad. “Yeah. Rest in peace. If that’s in the cards.”
“Do you know what I wished for Eween?” Jack asks, spearing strawberries on his fork as Cas cuts his pancakes into bite sized pieces. He continues, not waiting for an answer. “I wished for a baby lee-phant like Dumbo so I can show Miss. Amy that lee-phants can fly! What’ju wish for?”
“Dee’s turn!” Jack says, tugging at his sleeve.
“I’ve been away for... so long. I don’t
“Well,” Cas folds his arms across his chest, nostrils flaring. “I’m not the one who’s not talking.”

A litany follows. “Please please
Cas unclenches his fist, then flattens both his palms on the table.
He tries, again and again, and he fails. So he sits beside Dean, eyes fixed on where their fingers are linked together. His head snaps up with the sound of a sob, but then there’s an explosion from inside the cabin.
He stops, and runs a hand through his hair. “Dean has gone through so much, and accepting himself as he is took a lot from him. Your husband didn’t make it any easier, either. He has come a long way, and I’d rather you not affect that.” He sighs. “He loves you a lot, but if you hurt him- I- don’t know how I or, for that matter, Sam, will react.”

He remembers saving up on food money by eating less in the last weeks of April so he could get Sam a present and something other than boxed mac 'n cheese for dinner. He remembers Sam tearing up after he hastily tore open the newspaper wrapped package and out came a book Dean sneaked in from the library a town ago. He remembers being drunk after John shoved him out of the motel room when he came between him and Sam. He remembers palming the bruise on his bicep as he follows after Sam, meek yet unafraid, and Dean patted his cheek.
“That
Instead, he gestures to Cas’ bed, “Get back there.” And gets back on his own. Bed.
Cas shifts in his seat.
“Isn’t Dean your name? As far as I know, you’re the only person named Dean I know. And-”
“Huh?”
Okay, that’s not true. Dean cuts in, “That’s a lie. We met that other Dean at-”
“Shouldn’t ever let you put on clothes,” he mutters against Cas’ cheek. Cas huffs in his ear, biting at his earlobe. Encouraged, Dean asks, “Jack's not gonna be up for a while, wanna take it to the bedroom?” In response, Cas tugs him upwards and leads the way to their room. Halfway through though, he spins around, hand on Dean’s wrist tightening just so.

Jack puffs his face and with a gravitas of a four year old set to make his birthday wish, blows the bigger candle out. He signals at Cas to go next, and Cas closes his eyes and blows his candle. There’s a small indulging smile on his face when he opens his eyes, and he looks at Dean, the smile growing and Dean mirroring it back. How the fuck he got so damn lucky, he’ll never know. And that’s okay.
Cas stares at him in disbelief. “Is
He’s beside Dean, and his own sad laugh hits him like a freight train. “You changed me, Dean,” the Cas in front of him says, face so full of joy and contentment that guilt ripples through him.
Well, she mostly smelled like home, if Sam didn’t stink her up. His stomach lurches at that, and he pants into the bag. He needs another now, and the lady next to him - bless her - promptly offers hers.
Cas grins, then frowns.
Dean chuckles, and smiles at Mary, face fond and bright, and perhaps, hopefully, forgiving. “Yeah. Guess I do.”

Dean thinks that perhaps, this was worth it all. Well, maybe not, but he’s happy, he really is. The kind of happy he never thought he would be. The kind of happy that he’d never known to exist. He hardly remembers his birthdays from when he had a family, and he’s not sure he wants to try, not when it’s all bitter no sweet. But he remembers trying to celebrate Sam’s birthdays.

Cas just wasn’t there to see what he made of the strongest man he knows.
“Dean!” Cas admonishes. “Dee!” Jack adds, too pleased with the development.
Dean is shoved to the ground, and Cas can’t tell if he wants to comfort him or leave, the fear in his eyes mirroring his own. Dean’s wide eyed, shocked to his core at the sudden change, and
looking for them. Doesn’t know what to do with that though. He gets up, walks over to the pink shelf that has his books stacked together. Picks a book he remembers marking pages of, and the book opens to a random page.
“Claire is- she came out to me.”
“Claire call you yet?” he asks. Claire could swing by too. She really liked the side salad with tomatoes and cheese he tried the last time.
“No salad on the side, yes, I know.” Cas rolls his eyes, feigning annoyance.
where he is, so he tries not to. Instead, he finds Kelly, eyes shut in a peaceful, forever sleep, and whispers to her, “You would have been proud of him.”
This earns a laugh from Dean. “Touché. Yeah, I mean. Me too. Going to a friends. She just had a daughter. The rest of the family’s already there.”
There’s a faint smile of amusement on other Cas’ face. “You lied,” he states. Cas remembers this moment, stark against many other memories of being human. It’s a nice memory. He knows what’s going around in other Cas’ mind.
“They...came out to you.” Cas states, except, it’s a question.
“Even if you were not there.” He continues. “John made Dean,

When the tears run out, Dean just sits there, his shoulders brushing with Cas’, but he’s unaware. Then he finds the blood caked on his shoulder, in the shape of a palm, and a dry hiccup hitches through his throat.
“Hey, Cas.” Claire greets. Her face is blotchy, dirt on her forehead and jaw, and there’s a band-aid on her left cheekbone.
Dean inhales, and she has been nothing but kind to him, and he’s not in the best condition to snap. So, “Mah Baby” he says.

“She came out?” Cas asks.
The grin he receives is wide, and he sits a little straighter at that.
If he doesn’t make it, then what? He has saved the world, how many times now? Doesn’t even matter. Dean Winchester, renowned in the many planes of existence, will die in a plane crash. You know what’s worse? That with him will die the sixty-eight passengers and he can do absolutely nothing to save them. His face whitens, and it’s apparent enough for the lady to place a palm on his arm.
He just watches what he couldn’t in his death, watches Mary being pulled into the rift with Lucifer, watches Dean fall to his knees, shattered and- Cas doesn’t
Dean turns and simply stares at him in answer, narrows his eyes a bit to make his point: he’s pissed. Cas closes his eyes and inhales deeply, that dramatic bastard, and walks towards him where he’s unloading the ‘fresh produce’ on the kitchen counter.
in love with your best friend is that nobody said it would be this easy. It, however, is. It’s not confining, it doesn’t suffocate, it’s not bloody mouths and broken lips. The thing about being in love with Cas is, that he’s free, and he’s falling, and he won’t have it any other way.
“Yes. it was...not a hunt. She’ll drop by tomorrow, or today, maybe.” Cas replies.
as if it was hurting her to ask, as if she didn’t want to ask such a question in the first place. It’s coming in waves, these words, he’s saying it out loud and it’s fucking pathetic of him to whine about his mommy issues but-
but then he sees Dean crouching next to his body, grunting, and holding his dead body in his arms; his right hand supporting the lax neck, and his left hand tucked under his bent knees.

“Dean.
Cas’ body shakes with the breath he takes. “
the narration progresses, this time in dean's pov.
It’s everything in this nothingness. Dean wishes for this: many more mornings like this, wants to see Jack grow up and grow old. Wants to see Cas’ smile lines deepen, to count his grey hair. Wishes for Sam to have everything he never could give to him, and more. Wants Eileen to stay, forever, if that’s not too much to ask, with his too smart for his own good brother. Wants to cut the pancakes in silly shapes and wants to make fun of Sam’s green drinks and wants to wipe Jack’s face with the hem of his shirt.
Dean tips his face up with his fingers at Cas’ chin, and kisses him. Just a little, sweet kiss, don’t
The sunflowers stand tall on the kitchen table, in a plastic jar with yellow heart stickers shaped in a J. They came back around four with Jack nodding off, clinging to Cas’ torso like a koala bear and Dean’s hands filled with bags and plastic pots and a ceramic one. They had lunch at McDonald’s, because
It’s so fucking easy.
of watching Dean and Jack and Sam cremate him. He sits until they leave, and when the seal comes back to life, with Jack gone, Cas finds himself clutching to it with a prayer on his lips, and tear tracks on his face.
“Thanks, Cas.” He means it, really fucking does, Cas has no idea.
“Fine,
Sam’s saying something, but Cas doesn’t hear. He’s making his way to Dean already, and he can still hear Dean’s pleas, and his promises, and he sees a look he saw not long ago on Dean’s face.
Mary can’t help but smile at the way Cas ducks his head, and Dean sputters but he sits next to him nevertheless. He whispers something to Cas who narrows his eyes and bumps their shoulders in response.
the other him says, and Cas wants to punch him. A beat, then, “I love you.”
Dean throws up a little more.
Cas presses his lips together. “You’ll get there.” He assures her. She hopes so, too.
She looks at Mary, then back at Cas, then to Dean. Dean nods. “Hi, Mary. Claire.” She’s smiling, but it’s foreign, Mary can tell. Reserved for strangers. Mary smiles back.
is the reason Dean’s hurting.
“Okay, so you do have a family that’s not your car.” she teases.
Mary goes for it. “So she’s... your-
Cas swallows. “Oh.”
Cas leads the way, and Mary takes in the familiar atmosphere of diners. The smell of grease and something sticky, what, she can’t place, and the bustle. Three decades, and this hasn’t changed. Cas finds them a booth, sitting opposite her, and fumbles with the menu. He keeps eyeing the Impala, where the silhouettes of Dean and Claire are facing each other.
The fall through time is easier somehow.
true.
A chuckling Cas stands beside him, filling three mugs with coffee and two glasses with a green and an orange juice respectively. And Dean thinks.
probably Dean, makes him kneel next to his own corpse. Dean is looking at the sky, and when he looks back down at Cas’ blank face, he utters, almost like a prayer, “
Cas hums. “Maybe. I don’t...know.”
Dean plants his butt on the side of the edge of the sink, moving Jack to his other arm. They’re now standing like soldiers in a parade, facing opposite directions.
The plane jerks, its engines whirring, and the knots in his stomach uncoil, and- oh
“You-” Dean points a finger at him. “You’re so- you’re such a dick.”
when you don’t deserve it. But, he’s only human. So obviously, he doesn’t
“Cas?”
. This is a pass-
Cas nods, quivering. Gulps, and twines his fingers with Dean. “Me too. I’m- I’ll be here.”
“First of all, Abigail is a perfectly good name,” Cas says, making Dean huff out a cruel laugh, “and secondly, I wasn’t flirting with her. Or anyone, for that matter.”
It goes as intended, Cas snapping his face up and squinting at him. “Oh? Not your fault?”
But this? Pushing himself face-first into being a whipped husband, into just being
I'm so- I'm sorry.”
and Cas promises himself, another selfish demand, he’ll never let Dean crumble like this again.
messed up. And okay, yeah, Dean’s been zapped through blankets of time and across the globe and that was not the best picnic ever, either. But at least that was quick.
Cas leaves.
“Of course, Dean.”
“Yes, are you- Did something happen, Dean?”
why is it always like that with them?
“Would you like me to go check up on them? If Claire wants to not be with Mary, she can have my bed.”
“He’s- he too is like a father to her, in a way.” Cas nods to himself.
Sam falls back again, but Dean stays where he is. “Never do that again.” He scolds. There is heat and anger in his words, but Cas knows where it’s coming from.
of his Dean like this, and yet, as he realizes, it
The car is quiet, no music to fill the space, and both Cas and Mary watch Dean walk over to Claire. When he’s there, he opens his arms and Claire almost throws herself at him, clutching the back of his shirt in her fists. Mary looks at Cas, a little uncertain, and Cas’ eyes crinkle, something soft and wistful. When they’re walking back to the car, Dean talking, with his arm around her shoulder protectively, Mary takes in her appearance. She has blonde, long hair, wrapped in two pigtails. Her navy t-shirt is layered over with a darker flannel shirt, outfit finished with combat boots beneath her dark wash jeans. She looks just like Dean.
