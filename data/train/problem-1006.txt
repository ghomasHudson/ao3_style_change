“John. I wanted to say something before we went in, seeing that we might not get out…”
John looked back at the man fondly; he could see he was still trying to argue his point with Mycroft. He caught Sherlock looking at him as he turned to look at Victor. His eyes could have chilled a blazing fireplace. John started worrying; surely Sherlock wasn’t mad for one kiss? He had been bloody incisive in the car. John just wanted to send the message across his thick skull for once. Sherlock spoke then, addressing Harry.
"He's always been William to me. I'm naming my son after him.
“Yes, he didn’t know I was immune to damage. I’ve played around with those little plants so many times that the venom makes me a little dizzy now, and mind, also horny, instead of finishing me on the spot.”
“Well, I know my way around weapons. And that is not something we can attempt to fight just with magic. We need weapons of our own. And even if we have them, we need to be able to deflect their power so that it only affects them, so that nothing backfires on us.”
He grabbed both Victor and Alissa and disapparated on the spot before John had time to reply. Just turning around the corner, entering the closed ward, were Harry Watson and Oliver Wood.
“Mummy, she is a beauty that one. Look at this!”
Rory sighed, as he unwillingly seemed to brace himself for explaining the whole ordeal to an annoyed consulting detective. Just as he was about to begin his tale, a whooshing sound similar to the one produced by the TARDIS started ringing in their ears. John turned to look, but the TARDIS was still parked in the same spot they had left it. But soon, just right next to it, a photographic booth like the ones you could find sometimes in parties appeared right beside it. A very good looking woman, with blond curls and blue-green eyes appeared from inside the thing.
“Bill! A little help here?”
“Confusing and annoying.”
, that it would be better if we walked in pairs.”
“I was just going out on a date right now. We had finally got Isabelle on board for babysitting. Do you know how hard is to get reservations in some places in NYC? Now Alec is stuck with Max, and I’m probably never going to get laid again. I hope Harry has a good reason to summon me here, tonight of all nights.”
“Your brother would be proud,
“Then we are off too. Come along, John.”
“Yes, unfortunately.”
“I think we are at the right spot, but we must confirm before pulling the others from their locations.”
But Harry was smiling at Victor, no doubt he trusted Alissa’s judgement concerning the man.
"He is a keeper, this one." She winked at Oliver when he blushed, but quickly composed himself; his smile directed to Victoria was brighter than a Lumos, "I used to watch you play; you are training your former team now, right?"
He was in full doctor mode, and his tone of command was evident when he encountered the lime green robed healers. Two of them approached them, and the youngest one even raised an eyebrow at John, who was still wearing his muggle clothing, as he never bothered to tap his wand to his jacket.
“That’s out of your scale.”
“Good, we are in the right place. John? Sherlock? It’s me, Billie. We need your help. The Doctor is missing!”
“Apparition John! Now!”
"I wasn't on today. I was doing a bit of research on the Moriarty case."
Sherlock was standing next to John, looking at it with interest.
"The trouble you took in poisoning the poor woman?"
“Oh, so she’s John’s?”
“It’s only around ten. You slept barely three hours John. We need to leave soon.”
"So brother mine, now that your doctor is out of the closet, for lack of a better term, do you plan to use all the resources at hand? Or do I simply turn the whole thing over to Harry's office?"
"And his reaction?"
"After you, Alissa."
“Interesting ring.”
“Let me, then.”
“But that is the thing. The fairy in question was well into Fairie when the attack happened.”
“John. How are your daughter and Mary doing?”
Being held in a one-armed hug as the aforementioned hugger pointed a gun at his former assailant was not how he expected his day to end. But surely his life was not at all what he expected, most of the time. The tall blond man with the scarred face smiled at him, not losing his aim on his target for one second.
"Incendio" he muttered.
"You can see that I'm not now, Luna."
“You look like one of those custom made Puffskeins.”
“I’ll hold onto you; I want to see.”
“That’s more like it. So I guess I’m going to see
“Don’t be ridiculous John.”
on every possible surface before pushing the metal door open. Sherlock took in his surroundings, no doubt gaining every possible information available. John could see nothing that could pinpoint where Moran took Alissa, but he knew Sherlock’s mind worked on a different level. He looked at the table, and his face lit.
“That and because it really is an ugly name.”
“Not yet.”
“What are you saying?”
“I told you, I wasn’t feeling ok on your wedding day! But I wanted to meet her, John. Oliver brought me here before I changed my mind.”
"Could be Moran, but we are looking at something we've never seen before. His face, his whole body, not the same we have in our files. He looks different from the last time we saw him. Dark magic, I don't know if transfiguration is involved. We should consult an expert if we can find more evidence. Not much to go from just the reconstruction, we are talking about murder, they were expecting it, he managed to kill two wizards, moderately skilled from what we know about them, without so much as a sweat. He was fast, methodical. If this man is indeed Sebastian Moran, he is going to be a challenge to catch. And we need to get him. Alive. That is the only way that we can find the real Sebastian Moran, wherever he is hiding."
"Yes, he is also amazingly skilled at transfigurating anything else. Most of my dresses and Sherlock's Belstaff for example."
He touched his arm, where his wand was resting inside in its holster.
“Well, then, how many men have you dated?”
“Shit.”
“Well, this is a surprising turn of events Gideon, but you already know what we are doing here.”
“Not important. I sorted things with Potter. Nothing that you should be worried about.”
He grabbed his violin and started playing, a mournful tune that John recognised. He settled in his chair, wondering about his new Patronus, as the night went by with only the violin music in the background. Sherlock was still playing when he finally decided to call it a night, the music from downstairs lulling him into a troubled sleep.
And he felt the grip grow tighter on his waist.
“Gregory. Kindly do not render myself deaf.”
“Mmm. I don’t know if surprise him is such a good idea. He thinks you are dead.”
“I thought you were dead and buried, you dick!”
"Enough with all the endearment and the touching, we should get back to work. Mycroft is waiting for us with Elle's memory at his office again."
A parabatai is a fellow warrior, a brother in arms, basically a T'hyla in Vulcan (sue me, I also love Star Trek). They must find each other before their 18th birthday and make a ritual to bond. They can never be involved in a romantic relationship with each other (against Shadowhunter law). The runes made by one's parabatai are stronger and basically they fight together better than with anyone else. Not every Shadowhunter has a parabatai, actually bonds like that are not common.
John couldn’t tell now between Sherlock lying through his teeth at Roman or finally admitting things he had been thinking all along. He needed to sort things out between them. But he needed to get them out of the Hospital first.
Harry sighed.
“Don’t be.”
He winked at John, and helped him up, giving him the books he gathered. He then picked his bag, and said,
“You see, darling boy, the Shadowhunters really frown upon relationships among people of the same sex, relationships with mundanes or Downworlders and basically any relationship that won’t add a healthy Shadowhunter baby to the mix.”
Sherlock looked surprised but followed Harry carefully out of Alissa’s office. Victor found his Nintendo, abandoned on a chair, and started playing as John continued to stare at the little orbs who floated freely in front of Moran. Alissa was silently working on Gabrielle, who looked startled after a couple of waves from her wand. Her friend smiled at her and released her, and they exchanged a few words in French, whispering among themselves. Gabrielle started crying, and her friend held her, kissing her hair repeatedly. She turned to John and Victor.
“Mycroft. I need to leave undetected. I need my brother.”
"Mood enhancing potions? I never heard of such a thing."
“Darling, you must be careful love. Not everything outside wants to play with you, dear. Some things out there want to do you harm.”
He winked at Harry, as he finally rose to his feet while drinking his fifth blood replenishing vial. John decided that water was in order too, and pushed the glass again into his arm. One nasty cut in his arm refused to heal, no matter what they did to it, as well as one near his ankle that they’d missed because of his jeans. The doctor looked at them and transfigured two nearby rocks into bandages, proceeding to wrap them around the cuts. They couldn’t afford to lose more time.
And he was on his feet before John had even replied, full of manic energy, almost bouncing where he was standing.
"So help me God, Sherlock, you are going to this party, and you are going to at least pretend to have a good time."
“Are you sure? I’m still married to a woman, even if that’s officially over, at least on my side. I have a newborn baby, a premature baby, who will probably require all the attention and care I can give her when she gets discharged. I’m broken, complicated and I’m still not sure if I want to go back to the Magical World. You love all this, and you just got your wand back. We can still have what we had, and I won’t hold it against you. I would keep being your handler. But if we do this” - he signalled in between them - “and you change your mind, I’m not sure I would be able to take it.”
Jack laughed now, grabbing his partner’s waist as he continued to explain everything to John.
Harry smirked, but his face was grave again in a second, as he looked back at the state of his team members.
They left the bedroom, Mary looking out of her element.
“We will catch you both at the Ministry later. We are going to visit our baby at the hospital after this.”
Alissa told the wall, which opened, and Sherlock looked annoyed this time. John was next.
“I’ve thought about what you said. I’m prepared to stay in the muggle world. But you need to give Olivia a choice. If she gets the letter, which I don’t doubt she will, she should be able to go to Hogwarts or any magical school of her liking.”
"I'll be personally in charge of their safety, so you should know there is nothing to worry about."
Sherlock's birthday party, with a few memorable guests and political shenanigans in the background.
"Clara Prince."
Victor moved, and sat right beside him in the bed, took his hand in his. He wondered why he let this man, who he barely knew, take his hand and comfort him. But it felt safe, human contact, something that everyone secretly craves.
“I thought you were dead!”
“And you just go traveling with people you just met?”
"Do I have to do the charm myself? My spellwork is a little rusty as you already know, and I've never performed such a charm in my life."
“You understand it, I gather. Anything to point us to where I can find my deputy head?”
"I can't walk away from this case now Mary. I need to see this to the end. The case involves us directly. Sherlock risked his life for two years to save me, and he is fighting now for us."
"Barely."
"Yeah, and I didn't forget you were a crap one. Sherlock taught you how? You never seemed like you wanted to learn."
“And…”
The neonatologist walked out of the room, and Mycroft went to speak to her, sending her to John. She looked very professional, a no-nonsense kind of woman.
They reached Mycroft’s room, and after being assured by everyone that he was doing the right thing, Roman Hudson signed the discharge papers and left them alone. Mycroft was still drinking his potion, looking a little subdued, before speaking.
“All right?”
"Your parents were murdered. Murdered by the worst kind of Wizards this country, the whole continent, in fact, had ever heard of. Even Grindelwald's terror left fewer dead and fewer muggle casualties. It was not your fault."
"Stop it. I will let you loan my partner, for a while, mind you, just because you seem to have a bee in your bonnet."
“Love?”
“221B. Did exactly what you told us, Dad. The TARDIS had other plans.”
"Real height Victor, and real eyes. There's no dancing involved tonight."
The taller man took his hand from over John’s, and placed it on the side of his chair. John proceeded to retire the hand from his knee then. Sherlock looked back at John with a sort of longing now. John knew he would never have him now.
“Magnus the Magnificent Arsehole.”
. And she is perfect.”
“Why are you meeting with this people Ford? I thought we talked about it!”
“Sorry?”
"We can."
“My, my Doctor Watson, you do clean up nice.”
So Sherlock was spending a sleepless night in his mind palace, so John couldn't really help much. He dragged himself up the stairs and collapsed on the bed without changing.
. Wars started for this book. Empires crumbled."
“I must conclude that your mother was a time traveler as well?”
“Amazing. You got all that how, Sherlock? Because you said he would be expecting you even before you read the Codex.”
"She is one to talk. Pot to kettle."
Mary's eyebrows rose at the last comment, like daring someone to take John were she couldn't reach him.
“What are you both keeping from me?”
He seemed to be on a first name basis with the woman now.
“Sherlock is complicated. Let’s say the muggle police officers get more pain than joy by working with him.”
“Clearly. No windows, and no doors, at least on this side of the fire.”
He went back to his seat, and they kept looking at the files in silence. Soon Sherlock had the wall filled with pictures, of his ‘rats’, the people they were going to watch in the next couple of days. As he finished placing the last photo he could feel John standing next to him, his very presence anchoring him back in London. He was back, and John was here.
“No one is blaming you,
“Don’t mention Stephen Herondale’s name in my presence, Harry. I’m still horrified with the things he did. He stained Tessa’s bloodline.”
Yes, yes, I know this one is short, but I wrote this one a while ago, and wanted to cut it right there, sorry, but I'll update sooner than the week this time, since chapters 4-10 are done already. And also, I know I used the most used trope ever to exist in this fandom (Sherlock's back after Serbia) but at least in this case he is not getting any scars :D.
“Believe or not, he is back home,
"You would have been a nice addition to the wedding party John. You could have balanced my side. God knows I needed a voice of reason with those two idiots running my wedding amok."
"I will talk to my wife alone for a minute now. Sherlock, I'm going to use your room."
"And Mycroft?"
“I’ve wanted to make it up to him so badly, wanted to prove him how much I still care, even if we’re both too screwed up to fit together, I still love him deeply. But not as much or even in the same way as you do.”
"That is what they call Potter, Granger and Weasley nowadays, I heard today. Did you ever meet any of them at school, Sherlock? I liked Ron; he was a little dimwitted sometimes, but better than Percy. I always thought Harry had the worst luck ever."
Oliver hummed at the confidence, even after all these years, their friendship seemed like it could now go on without suffering. His gaze kept wandering away from the conversation, to the two friends, former lovers really, that seemed to have stopped arguing and kept dancing. John figured out it was time to let that particular cat out of the bag.
“I can assure you all of this were acquired in a consensual setting, very different from the ones both you and Sherlock have.”
protected. She knows I don't have a wand."
“What, are we in a band or something? I’m not singing your back up tunes. I think it was your singing that got you banned from Peru, if I recall correctly. And Christmas was three months ago.”
“Don’t even try to deny it. Everyone can see it, even if he can’t. We never worked, you know. We both like the spotlight too much.”
Sherlock looked surprised at the question, and he felt his piercing stare meet his eyes.
“I wanted to talk to you. Baby is officially named now. Olivia Victoria Watson-Holmes.”
"Okay, so Moran doesn't know you are a wizard?"
“Same thing. Besides, they are here for you.”
“Hello there. John, she has your nose.”
“She said try the otters. Does that mean anything to you at all?”
“This must be a joke from your brother. Time travel? Aliens? And why did he text you? He usually calls!!!”
John laughed as Sherlock glared at him, clearly not even trying to hide his jealousy at John’s statement. God, this was precious. Just this morning (
She fiddled with her phone for a second.
“You two could compete for the title.”
He walked around it, poked him more with his wand.
“Hey. Sleepyhead. Wake up.”
“Libby.”
“Are you sure you won’t reconsider Greg? We gain more by keeping the peace and helping sustain the Accords.”
"Stop fretting, John."
“Don’t ever think of doing something like that again, John Watson. It was hideous to see Victor disappear into this forsaken place and then you decided to follow suit as if you two were alone in the whole wide world.”
"Hey, I'm not worried. They are close friends."
The machine made the same whooshing sound John heard before, and John felt… actually nothing. Was the thing even moving?
“Fuck you Jim and fuck you Seb for good measure.”
He batted his eyelashes at John, smirking.
“If I recall correctly you started seeing Anna and the mundane soon after. And you didn’t forgive me, even when dear Anna pleaded with you.”
He shrugged at the comment and extended his left hand, in which John noticed a beautifully carved golden ring, with the letter T in cursive. It was bigger than a standard band, in fact, it seemed like several rings, each which a feather carving that reminded John of a phoenix’s tail.
“You should try it sometime. Miff told me you were very skilled in Transfiguration when you were younger. Earning the praise of Minerva McGonagall was never easy, trust me, I know, she edits everything I publish for Transfiguration Today. She still calls my endeavors at transfiguration in fashion a total waste of time. Showed you mine, now show me yours?”
To get back to you, Sherlock thought.
“Yes, they passed by. Theresa doesn’t like to linger. But I needed some assistance. And she always comes if the London Institute calls. After all, this was her family home.”
“Not quite. Apparate us out of here again, please.”
“Oh, don’t mind me, brother mine.
“He’s still bleeding! Probably never stopped! But his clothing is dry.”
“Do you know if shield charms repel bullets?”
Percy seemed so glad to see him, definitely more so than John was, and grabbed both his hands in his.
“It is, isn’t it? I can’t properly do it myself, I suck at healing charms, but you did wonderfully. Again.”
“My wife is keeping me at home today. I hope you manage to handle this without requiring further assistance.”
“Don’t worry, no one knows who you are here. But I want you to meet someone. Luke, a word please.”
Sherlock looked pained for seconds before it all disappeared once again behind the facade. John wondered how much Sherlock knew the lady, and how he didn't react when he saw her dead, as Gabrielle had.
"McGonagall or Trevor?"
Sherlock made a mock anger face at his mum while she tsked at him, making her way to the garden.
“Really? That is barely a four, Sherlock. The bodies are probably stashed somewhere near the alley.”
“She is
“You can trust me with your back, you know. A friend of Miff is always a friend of mine, and now you are family.”
"Yes, Lestrade, duly noted. You'll both be safe if you leave tonight with Anthea."
“Even when you couldn’t visit Mummy and Father again. That was… that was good. What you did.”
He pulled out a phone and leaned next to Sherlock, showing him pictures of his baby boy.
“Never mind.”
He started walking and left John boiling, with his left-hand twitching, before he caught one more breath, sighed, and followed the taller man.
“We finally managed to trick him. We had to elaborate a new reality, where he succeeded in abducting Alissa and me. He resisted it at first, but after he was convinced it seemed he was going to bring her to his hiding place all along.”
"What is it then?"
She gave him a rare smile.
“Inferi?”
“Finding my mother in her own timeline might prove a bit tricky and quite dangerous. Basically the only time she wasn’t imprisoned or doing really outrageous things would be… But, I can’t… You might even prevent me from being born!”
Jack’s smile was a bright as it had ever been.
John had a brilliant idea then.
“So did I.”
"I'm a wizard, a half-blood. My mother, the brilliant mathematician, is also a witch. My father is a muggle. My mom fell in love with him at Uni, which she attended after Hogwarts. She was not very fond of the wizarding world, had many friends and family members killed in Voldemort's first attempt to take over. Many of them fled to France at that time, her family name is Greengrass, and some of them were on Voldemort's ranks. But her mother was a Weasley, so they had people on both sides of the war. After that, she decided to test her luck in the muggle world, and she and one other cousin on the Weasley branch of the family were the first ones to pursue anything outside the magical realm. I believe he is an accountant and the black sheep of the Weasley family."
“Captain?”
“Your sister.”
“Tag, you are it. I don’t envy you, Johnny boy, not when he is in a strop.”
"They," and she motioned the mousy looking man forward, and the girl on the window took her cue too "are Dennis Creevey and Gabrielle Delacour. They will be in charge of your security from now on. My husband has procured a house on Cornwall for your stay during this troubled time."
“Shut. Up. Shut your bloody trap…”
“My, my, this one is inquisitive. Your taste is improving, brother, I thought it would never…”
“Straight to the point, as always. It’s a delight to be working with you both again, even if you don’t remember us.”
He watched his daughter sleep peacefully, a feeding tube into her mouth and clear halo sending oxygen, helping her immature lungs breathe.
He threw a spell at Moran, which the man deflected, and Mycroft’s wand snapped in half. John was still shielding him as the man sighed, and threw his umbrella behind him.
He gave John his impish grin, and John felt like punching him in the mouth. I guess he felt the danger because he started pouting.
She left them standing in front of the TARDIS as she walked to greet the hostess.
“Got a taste of your own medicine then, brother?”
“No, I’m quite all right, thank you. My sincere apologies for…”
So this is my first ever fanfic. Got an idea and rode with it. No brit picking, no beta, so any mistakes are mine and mine only.
The others were behind their barrier, Victor humming. It seemed the ones who sacrificed memories, like John, were feeling worse for wear. And why was Sherlock taking so long?
John didn’t dignify that comment with an answer. He tapped his wand into his jacket, which morphed into the wine-coloured robes again.
“Yes, emotional turmoil can do that sometimes. It happened as we where dismantling Moriarty’s network. One day, the usual Thunderbird he was so proud about, then just like that he produced a raven. He thinks it’s a crow and a bad omen for him.”
“Oh, I wasn’t wearing this particular face at the time. But it’s good to remember. Let me tell you a story.
Alissa grabbed her husband and disapparated without another word. John hoped they both would be ok; Alissa was probably sporting some nasty injuries herself. Victor was still lying on the floor. And the body pieces were still there, looking strangely alive as before.
That said with a feral smile and a look that revealed whatever it was that made John Watson one of the scariest supernatural beings alive this day and age. Sherlock looked at him like he couldn’t believe someone like John existed, and everyone was silent for what it seemed ages, until Mycroft cleared his throat.
“Yes, she did. And I did the same, until I was eleven. That was the day the Shadowhunter who came said he will try his luck with you next year.”
John remembered some snips of Hermione’s written account of Harry’s part in the Wizarding War, he thought there was something important about that particular memory that was terrible for Harry, but he couldn’t remember. Sherlock looked at the doors.
They couldn’t arrive back to Baker Street soon enough. It started raining, and Sherlock couldn’t help but wonder what was so special about those two bodies that made his brother appear in person and take control of the crime scene. He couldn’t even remember the second body well.
“John?”
“Yes.”
“Why on this earth would you think it’s a love potion??”
“An old… friend of ours, yes, let’s say friend Sherlock. Woolsey was fine in my claws, as I recall. Fine until you decided to leave your VVT and take him from me.”
John snickered at this. He could see it now. Probably half of the Yard was composed by werewolves. They soon reached the fifth floor, the lift opened to a well-lit hallway with a good carpet and some tables with ornamental vases and dried flowers. This floor had only three doors in it, and Mycroft and Harry continued walking to the door at the end of the hallway. Mycroft knocked and soon the door opened, revealing a chain lock and the face of a very annoyed Molly Hooper.
He almost purred the last word. Sherlock looked like someone had punched him hard in the stomach.
“That is not what I imagined you would be like at all.”
John laughed harder now.
“Yes, but we need more people, Holmes.”
saved
“Typical vampire shit.”
"If Mac delivers, you won't have to do anything."
“She doesn’t want us to leave, I think.”
He caught a note of contempt in the way she said '
As they arrived at the hospital, and as John placed Olivia in Victoria’s arms for the first time, he could see the look of wonder on her face, and he could swear her eyes were a little watery. Sherlock was now beaming at them from the window, as a nurse approached him and told him he could join them.
Let me know in the comments if you guys want more background.
“And a muggle hospital, no doubt. It wouldn’t be easy to find a surrogate in the magical community, so tightly woven, and you two have been living as muggles all this time.”
“Creevey and Prewett aren’t back yet. I hope their luck is as good as ours.”
“It is rare of you to bend at someone’s will, brother.”
Victor still extended his hand, and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
They took the lift down; Sherlock was quiet, he gave the trio some space. When they reached the front, two cars were already waiting for them. Oliver and Harry climbed into one, and Sherlock and John rode the other. Sherlock was quiet, but John caught him trying to talk to him, then stopping again.
"But you are right about something, John, he knows about you being a wizard, he probably knows everything there is to know about you, from both worlds. I'm going to curse him in his sleep if I ever get my wand privileges back."
“Olivia will be home soon enough.”
“My, my, the mighty Sherlock Holmes in a real spot of trouble. Let’s see how that doctor of yours likes you with a bullet hole…”
At that Sherlock's face lit as if he found a triple murder in a locked room.
“The two bodies right there! You surely can’t be so blind as to miss them, they are right there.”
Sherlock winced at the recognition, and stepped into the background, standing near one of the walls.
John was smirking at Mycroft now, and Sherlock was rubbing his finger in small circles against his back. Alissa just rolled her eyes at them.
"Weasley was an Auror, but left the office a few years ago, to do what I don't know or care. Granger is the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, higher than Potter, his boss actually. Same level as my brother. My brother is the Head of the Department of Mysteries."
“Professor Song, may we have a word with you?”
John felt he could die right there, right now, knowing that Sherlock loved him, probably as much as he loved him.
“Ahhh, fond memories.”
"Text me anything new Sherlock."
Sherlock witnessed the exchange, and John could see worry escaping through his usual façade. He stood next to him silently and placed his hand on his shoulder. As Sherlock looked back at him, he seemed to relax back into his usual features. Fear might still be there, but now it wasn’t there for those who knew how to read him to see.
“Let me see them.”
“And are you part of that truce? What is Shadowhunter?”
John’s wand arm was starting to cramp.
“No need to worry, he’s back in one piece. We were in a very public place, not easy to mount attacks in crowded streets. You know how it gets, with wizarding robes, hard to feel a phone vibrating. We happened to be enjoying ourselves.”
“Tell me, where is it? I can ask politely just so many times, as you know. Your wandless
"Long time. Decided to join the ranks again?"
“Do you see the fault in your logic now?”
was still going nowhere. Then Magnus gave him a coin and two pieces of paper, and John was speechless. Those belonged to Ragnor. He held his brother’s wrist in thanks, and the warlock just smiled back at him. Then someone passed him the baby, and the little guy was a charmer.
“True, but maybe they expected the one who entered to die because of the curse of the door. If someone tried to enter alone, the poor bastard probably wouldn’t be telling any tales. I only made it because I’m fantastic.”
“Would have opened in a heartbeat, I guess.”
They waited as the potion simmered, Alissa and Harry talking in low voices to each other. Victor tried to engage John in conversation, failing each time as John was mesmerised watching the potion change colours, the smoke changing patterns and Sherlock watching the variations and flicking his wand to stir the cauldron differently or lower the intensity of the flames. He grabbed some of the potion in a flask and stood next to the beaker-like contraption that held Moran’s body. He levitated himself to the top and placed three drops in the liquid. The effect was immediate. Moran’s body started stirring, and tiny blue orbs appeared in front of him, at least a hundred, all of them of different sizes. The bodies they had trapped in the silvery ropes stopped squirming, finally appearing dead, as three of the shiny orbs rose from their bodies and joined the rest in front of Moran, these three more significant than the rest of them. Sherlock released the ropes from Madame Delglove’s body.
“You could gag me. Pity you’re married, though, Tiger.”
“Your eloquence impresses me, John.”
"Ha! I thought you might have forgotten the Bond days. That 'muggle actress' is a witch, her name is Victoria Vertro, or she can also be a wizard, depending on her mood. He is not here right now, so I can introduce you to her. You might get to meet him later if he decides to come out. He is famous in the Wizarding World, you see."
“Inspector, clearly you can see this is not just blood that you are looking at. There are two bodies right there, you know.”
"Easy mistake to make. He and Alissa are very close. They have been friends since school."
John’s gut twisted. Surely nothing had happened to him? Ragnor must be safe. And his sister was already using her lost name, the name warlocks around the world new, the only name she would allow them to call her. Things must really be serious. He didn’t know who he hated most right now, Valentine Morgenstern or Jim Moriarty.
“I know now what you are. I just saw the surveillance video, John. Keep my brother away from the Shadow World. I’ve sheltered him from it his whole life. I know now I have to thank you for his life, but I really regret he… Well, it doesn’t matter now. You are leaving? For Idris?”
“Actually, she is my twin.”
"Pity her taste in men, though."
So yes, Victor is an actor and into musical theater, so his pet names for his friends are all from Cats. Sherlock and Mycroft use his pet name because they secretly love theirs.
"Brother, I need your wand back."
“You both should know, though Greg Lestrade is a good man, his pack does not welcome outsiders in their mist. You can say his second and third in command have a real grudge with other Downworlders and get easily offended. That is to say, they are both bitches most of the time. Especially his second in command. When James died, Greg was also granted custody of his daughter. That made his second, who was third when James was alfa, even more protective of him, because James daughter is her niece. Her only sister died in childbirth, multiple births often more common with born werewolves, and only one of the pups survived. She is ruthless, and it won’t be good if she sees us as a threat. She won’t even let us talk to Greg. So we all need to be on our best behavior today.”
He wasn’t surprised to see his duffel bag, the one he had brought to 221B, in one of the chairs by the small fireplace. Mycroft’s place was like a mansion. He went into the bathroom and changed into pyjama bottoms and a T-shirt, while he heard Sherlock open the door to the other room. He took his wand out of his robes and brought it with him into the bedroom. He found the lanky wizard on the left side of the bed, with the blue journal on his lap, and his laptop opened and plugged, already in pyjama bottoms with nothing on his top. Sherlock had placed his wand and wand holder on the night table. John could see the pale round scar were Mary had shot him.
Anna Lightwood: Shadowhunter, alive on Victorian times. She was special, a crossdresser, preferred to dress like a male and was basically a rebel in Victorian Society. She was a good friend of John's in this story, not in a relationship with him because in my mind Anna is a lesbian, in canon Cassandra has not revealed this fact yet.
“Surely that is not my concern. The High Warlock wishes to meet with you.”
“I know,
“It’s clear to me that finding your father is going to prove impossible for us. But I know who can find him. Your mother. She can tell us were to find him.”
John’s voice was muffled by the man’s long coat, and the man kissed John’s head, gaining a glare from Sherlock.
"20 weeks."
"His boyfriend.", chimed Trevor, extending his hand for John to take.
Like Luke. Oliver pulled both Harry and John into a big hug.
“I’m sorry! I’m so, so sorry! But he was going to kill you Griz!”
“Now you made him mad Johnny, and on his birthday. Honestly, give the poor boy a break.”
Mycroft smirked at his friend, speaking for the first time since the unusual trio arrived at his office.
"Yes, I can look out for my modesty myself John, I must have you know that I'm not some damsel in distress. Anyway, Victor thought he finished him, and he was sure the body had no metamorphic magic on it. But Sebastian Moran is a very dangerous dark wizard, and I'm sure he is alive. We dismantled the muggle side of the network, I made sure of that, but with Moran alive, no one is safe."
They waited for what, at least it seemed like it to John, hours, well a long time indeed, before Sherlock finally appeared through the wall. He was rubbing his temples, but looking a lot better than John when he came from the wall, according to Victor.
And John smacked him in the back of his head.
“Yes, and you would be dead. I don’t know how that bastard knew that.”
John was going to murder this man, and no one could blame him.
So John decided it was his turn now.
. I’ll do a reconstruction right now, so I can see what happened here. I can feel your protective charms, only a Portkey that had John travelling to this room could have gone through. We almost bounced off. Allow me.”
"Magic is inherited, so yes, she can be a witch. It's less likely since I'm muggle-born and you are a muggle, but she can have magic."
“Is he dead? Was he killed by a hunter?”
John tried to remember what little he knew about wandlore, something to do with duels? All his magical knowledge seemed so far deep in his memory. As always, his friend finished his unspoken thoughts, handing back the wand to its owner.
John was frowning. He wasn’t about to start accepting gifts from almost strangers, and he almost told Victor that, before he placed a hand near his mouth, stopping him from speaking.
“We should go visit Libby at the Hospital.”
“Yes, darling? Mac sent me outside. Apparently, Mummy doesn’t approve of my smoking habits in the house.”
"Let's ask for a different Department. No doubt Mycroft might have seen us through the CCTV, but if he has immersed himself in some magical affairs, he might ignore his muggle surveillance for a while."
That is what he used to call Ragnor, he remembered fondly.
“Anna and me were just friends, thank you very much. And I forgave you. I just didn’t tell you for a couple of years.”
"I knew it. I knew something was off from the beginning. I knew you both were hiding something. I thought...but anyway, your secret is worse than I imagined."
John was suddenly annoyed and it came rougher than he intended. Harry smirked.
"More like a piece of his consciousness. His soul would probably be in pieces but inside his real body. Sherlock managed to trail his activities through Paris and Scotland as far as two weeks ago. He was leaving an obvious trail of murder and destruction, and we failed to notice the pattern. Harry and Lissa were investigating the deaths of two wizards in Scotland; they had traitor carved on their arms with a knife. They were presumably part of his former allies in the wizarding community, who severed all ties with him when he started going 'muggle'. This is the case file."
Mycroft waved his thanks away. It was John’s turn to talk now.
"She also happens to be Mycroft's wife."
“Ha bloody ha, I wasn’t 'disgusting' when I was saving your sodding life, so give me a break Mac.”
“Thanks, darling, you should see me when I’m trying.”
"You want me to go along with this."
“Those are from Venomous Tentacula, right? Why didn’t I see them before, when Moran poisoned you? Or when you almost died in the cave?”
"I think you are getting the wrong picture. Alissa only wanted to spare your life. You see, Alissa is a gifted Seer. Sometimes she gets visions, sometimes she gets prophecies, like the ancient Greek oracles. She had one vision of me mourning you, and a prophecy that I could only come back when my blood called back to me. Both her and Victor helped me track and eliminate Moriarty's network, and we separated pursuing three different leads, Alissa in Russia and the US, Victor in Spain and I headed out for Poland and Serbia after. I was in Serbia under torture when my dear brother came to fetch me, my blood calling back to me indeed."
“Well, hello Doctor Watson! I was wondering when you would fancy a date with me! Lunch? My treat!”
Alissa smiled at John, and said,
“So, where is he?”
"Mycroft. Mycroft knows? Sherlock knows? About this? About what you are?"
“You already gave me a birthday present, and a great one, you both did.”
"As fascinating as this discussion about Quidditch is, it seems my brother, now done with his political scheme, requires our presence. John."
“All the magic here really messes with my 3DS. I guess I’ll have to finish this one later. It keeps failing to save my progress.”
“I can think of a few things. I can be rather creative sometimes.”
"Au contraire, my naive partner, Mycroft doesn't want to be Minister. But he is the favourite for the post, especially for traditional wizarding families. Holmes might not be a magical surname, but the name Greengrass still carries might. And, compared to the rest of the pureblood families, the family can boast of inclusion, having muggleborns," he pointed at John, "immigrants, black people and even reformed criminals on their mist. Not even the Weasley family had all of those before. While still keeping the money and status that old wizarding families are proud of, that is."
"Mycroft. I'm going to need that license. As soon as possible."
“Ok, here goes nothing.”
More characters to be added, but each of them would get their own part in a note if they belong to Cassandra's World. I guess if you are reading this, you probably belong to the Sherlock fandom :D, so I'm not explaining them.
“You can separate any potion into its components?”
“And you both?”
“I’ve just told you that all the stories are real and you tell me that she can’t be my twin because she looks about twenty?”
"Oh yes they do, John. Only that we have magical ways to gather evidence. Alissa is a gifted Seer; I should have told you that she can see, not only the future, but some of the recent past as well, and the layers of the spirit realm."
that Moran, after all is said and done is doing everything he does for love.”
“How long does it usually takes her?”
“So, this is your…?”
It opened. Sherlock rose an eyebrow Alissa’s way, and she smiled pleasantly at him.
“Oh, God. Did they get their memory back?”
"My mind playing tricks on me. My brain has been tampered with, sometimes with magic, as you could see from the effect Mycroft's spell has on me. I've seen this information myself in my mind palace countless of time, and I refuse for it to be real when it simply is."
said the swan in Gabrielle Delacour’s voice.
“So you think you are a dark wizard? I’ve looked at darker wizards in the eye and lived. A nothing gets darker than this. There are fates worse than death, as you, a coward who fears it, don’t seem to grasp.”
“Dog-headed monster that roams Louisiana swamps. Alissa’s great-great-grandmother, Marie Laveau, had one as a pet.”
John’s eyes went cold at the introduction.
“God, no. I’m a Malfoy?”
Mycroft rolled his eyes.
“I guessed you were a Shadowhunter since the door. But you don’t have any marks.”
"Only if you manage at least two hours, no, let's make them three. Your mother worked so hard."
"I'm sure I won't know half of the people invited."
"Thanks, mate. I guess this is our cue. And good luck. Give our best to Alissa and your brother."
He said it to no one in particular, acknowledging for the first time that a dinner party was indeed occurring. He had a weird look on his face, which probably only the people currently in the room and his brother would have recognised under his usual mask.
“Aliens. Now you are talking about sodding aliens. That’s it, get the fuck out of our flat!!! And take that contraption with you!”
He said it in a mocking tone, but he was smiling, and John could notice he was very good looking, for a boy that is. He had a pale face with freckles, and red curls, cupid bow mouth and pale greenish eyes. His companion was behind him, tutting impatiently. He was also tall, and a little stouter, with a sour look on his face.
"It was my wedding day Sherlock. He made me kiss him on my wedding day transforming into my wife!"
Mary was going to kill him.
“I’m afraid I don’t follow you, Rory, he looks hot.”
“You have to. Besides, John is going to work with me on his present for you, and you are not going to ruin his surprise, so William, you will behave for once in your life and do what you are told.”
He took the tube home, and he walked the two blocks from the station to his house. He opened the door and found Mary reading a book in the sitting room.
“Scratch that, visitors.”
“Well, still it wouldn’t hurt to look.”
“You need Sherlock to find this Doctor of yours, who can travel through time apparently? How could he even find him?”
“Sherlock and me were called to a mundane crime scene today. It turned out to be the final resting place of said Shadowhunter and fairy knight.”
“I screwed up big time, Miff. I fucked up everything this time.”
"I know. You are right, no reason to fret at all."
“You heard me.”
"She doesn't keep it
“I can, yes.
“Of course I knew. I thought your sister was a mundane or at least one like you. I’ve never been able to tell with you and neither has he, so I thought…”
WARNING!! This chapter contains a really gory scene and mentions of a bad guy wanting to do something unspeakable to a baby, not actually doing, but plotting to do. If something like this triggers or affects you in any way I encourage you to skip this chapter.
“Not even Hermione can walk through all the doors. In fact, not even the Unspeakables can. I had a nasty encounter with that room a long time ago. Not my fondest memory.”
“Shell cottage!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock feigned offence but kept dancing, and soon they moved closer to were Victoria and Oliver were twirling, and Victoria took a moment to grab John.
John touched his shoulder almost as a reflex at that comment, wondering how much this man knew about him.
, it’s not your fault, I wasn’t fast enough.
She took out her wand and started chanting like the last time John saw her inside the pensieve. She walked around the room, looked out the window, and then stopped. She looked at John, pained look on her face.
“So how do we move this rock?”
John was crouched next to him, hand on his wrist, checking his pulse. He felt dizzy, but otherwise unharmed.
Sherlock took the baby from him.
“So, you are both aliens?”
Mycroft rolled his eyes and continued browsing his newspaper.
They tiptoed, Sherlock occupied himself by casting a nonverbal
Mycroft was there.
“I'd rather not, Mycroft.”
“No, no, Miff,
“Really? So close? I thought it was further away in the family tree. No wonder the bullet to the head.”
“The lights? I knew I didn’t feel the magic flowing through me.”
Sherlock managed to gather his wits back somehow.
“John? I thought you would be called Superstar or something like that.”
“I’m leaving right now.”
“Is your wife enjoying South Africa, Potter?”
“Come on! Griz told me she welcomed you into our family. So just think of them as a gift from, I don’t know, an annoying cousin.”
“Pardon?”
“Thanks, Miff, you look dashing yourself. Another coat?”
Sherlock sighed and let John go. John pulled on his pants and trousers, as Sherlock opened the door. Of course, the housekeeper was looking at them with an impatient frown.
“Pity you talk so much.”
cases, Mycroft. The bloody Shadow World stays on your side of the fence. We don’t mess with other Downworlders. We respect the Accords, but neither my pack or the Praetor Lupus want to deal with problems with the Fairy Courts. I’ll have you know that minutes after my team left, I received a visit from someone I don’t want to ever see again in my life.”
John felt lightheaded. Could he have been so blind after all this time? Did Sherlock love him as much as he loved him? Because he knew now what he felt, now that Mary and his promise to her seemed to be out of the picture, for now at least, because with
Mycroft was looking at his baby through the window, arm around his wife’s waist.
Victor blew a raspberry Sherlock’s way, and the detective seemed to want to murder him on the spot. John sighed.
"You forgave me after my fall. You forgave me when Oliver could never forgive you."
“That’s the difference, you see, the worst thing that can happen is it gets bigger or something like that, or you change it into something else, and since it’s not even my real appearance, it doesn’t matter. You can practice on yourself.”
"Now, do me. But you'll have to use another wand."
“We should continue behind this wall,” Sherlock muttered, like talking to himself.
Moran has a hostage, and the real fight begins. Dueling, magic and curses ensue.
Clary Fairchild/Fray/Morgenstern is the main character of the Mortal Instrument series, who is dating Jace Herondale, both of them are the leaders of the New York Enclave, and heads of the New York Institute.
Victor laughed before adding,
“Nothing. It’s good to be home.”
“What?”
Then Magnus lowered himself to speak directly at John’s ear.
“I ought to replace it; it was Mac’s present.”
“Take care, little brother.”
Victor placed himself in front of the door, and he transfigured it into a shower curtain with a goldfish pattern.
“There are many types of demons. Some of them are the Greater Demons, some are even more rare, like the ones who used to be angels before falling from heaven. Those demons include the Princes of Hell. My father is one of those demons. Most warlocks are the offspring of Eidolon demons, or shapeshifting demons, who trick a woman into thinking they are mating with their loved ones. The thing with Greater Demons is that some of them can still be very beautiful, even if they are rotten to the core. But they usually don’t leave their realms, so there aren’t many offspring of greater demons around. It’s a good bet to say that the most powerful warlocks in the world are the sons and daughters of the Great Evil Ones.”
had happened yet in their timeline, but he hoped he lived to see it, because they only knew one Greg and he hoped it was the same Greg Jack was referring to.
“Surely we know who that was meant for.”
"Then we better get going. Mycroft surely won't wait for us all the evening."
“Do you have any more potions?”
“I used to bite you. I wanted to be scary as a vampire, remember?”
“Thanks,
“So like you to throw my own words back at me, brother. I don’t need to remind you, if I hadn’t indulged in this little adventure, all of you would be dead by now.”
Victor gave Roman a full bloodied smile now, and John thought the man would piss his pants.
They worked on it for a while, until Sherlock barged into the room, talking to himself, or to John, but without looking up.
"You, you are a wizard?"
Sherlock started to read, as the warlocks started talking strategy while the hours went by.
“Shhh, someone is coming!”
"Rolf. I didn't think healers used the muggle 'Dr' for their titles? That one is news to me, I must say. Surely society is advancing."
“All right, all right, gentlemen and lady.”
“Yes, so sad. And when Mummy was five, they started visiting the house. Asking her to go away with them.”
“Done.”
Just then a beautiful Shadowhunter woman approached them.
Sherlock said to himself in a low tone something that sounded like
"Now, can I say hello properly?"
“Don’t tell me that was defence, Sherlock. I know defence when I see it. That was one of the darkest spells I’ve ever seen that isn’t an Unforgivable Curse.”
“He is going to need plenty of blood replenishing potions; he has more than ten untreated Venomous Tentacula bites. He is partially immune to the poison, so he would be better on the first floor, treat it more as a creature induced injury, his problem is the blood loss, it's hurting him more than the poison. Trust me on that one.”
Mycroft smiled, a fake one, no doubt, back at John.
“Well, yes, anything that affects Sherlock involves me. And I like your wife. If anything happens to you now, it will reflect badly on my healing abilities. Won’t want you dying on me, it would ruin my reputation.”
Behind one of the boxes, he came out with Alissa’s wand in his hand. Victor gave a soft cry, almost a whimper when he saw it.
Harry nodded somberly, before helping himself to some toast and honey. Apparently, with all the nuisance from yesterday, the man hadn’t sat down to a good meal. His clothes looked a little rumpled, and his hair, as always, was all over the place.
"Ah, but she knows you can always get your hands on one, trust me, she seals her lock with magic."
“Surely this is your cue to take my brother home, Dr. Watson?”
He kissed Mummy on both cheeks, and Sherry went after him, no doubt to prepare his guest room.
"You see, when I ran, I couldn't keep in touch, and it hurt him that I never reached out to him, or Luke, or his mother during that time. But I wasn't about to risk the only family I had besides Harry. They protected her, you know? After my parents died and I joined the Order, Tonks sent a message to Luke, and he hid my sister in his house, made her part of his own Fidelius Charm. They were a pureblood family and fought for and protected muggles. Luke died in the Battle of Hogwarts. For me, it was losing a brother. Oliver never spoke to me again after that day, not even at the funeral, when we buried all the fallen. His mother was in shock, and barely glanced when I offered my condolences." His eyes filled with unwelcome tears, the memories still too much to handle.
"This is the first time I see the Auror department at work. It is so different than I imagined. Forensics don't really work on magical crimes I gather?"
Harry said to Alissa,
"Yes, not recent. Almost twenty years ago, as a matter of fact."
She snorted at the self-deprecatory comment, because she knew Gideon Verlac was a very dangerous man, and Mycroft Holmes a more dangerous one even. But the last bit clearly sparked her curiosity, so she closed the door and removed the chain. When she opened the door, her eyes widened at the sight of Sherlock and John, but she was still blocking the entrance and didn’t comment or greet them in anyway. Sally Donovan was seating in the large sofa on the sitting room, a dark and feral look on her face.
“I’m starting to see a resemblance between those Shadowhunters and a fascist regime. But you have a toddler in the house, so I assume he must be yours, I don’t think someone would leave a toddler around you that much if it wasn’t.”
He lowered his face, and his eyes filled with moisture, and then he felt a tug, and a long-fingered hand grabbed his own. He lifted his face, not letting go, but squeezing the offered hand, locking eyes with Sherlock as the other man started talking.
"Mycroft we are going to need Victor after all. Even Alissa said so."
“Harry. It’s time you finally met Sherlock.”
“Thank you, Miss Delacour.”
“It would be wise, yes.”
John started massaging his neck, loosening the muscles. He could feel John now really working his back. All the knots, the two years apart, going away. This won’t do. He stood up, fast.
John went ahead and held his baby for the first time. Her eyes were open, with that grey that all newborns had most of the times, and she moved her little hands and feet.
“I notice you are not denying the mundane. Yes, you forgave me, after you went MIA in World War II and I had to go and look for you! Then you bailed again on me and started exploring Nepal with Tessa!”
All-knowing Mycroft was insufferable.
"John Watson. Long time, my friend."
“I guess we’ll have to reschedule dinner. I can give you your present later, though, Miff.”
"Ah, yes, I hope to put them in shape for the next season, we ended in the top half of the table this year, but I think we finally got the players we need for a championship. I've been the assistant coach these past few years, but the team finally changed owners, and with that, the head coach retired and let me take the reins."
Bloody hell, the man was posh. Having one house-elf in a family is a mark of status. John couldn't imagine what kind of level you needed to have three. He remembered that the first part of the party, before dinner, was taking place in the ballroom of the manor.
Then she to John was standing right beside Sherlock listening, and she turned to look at him and smiled.
"John, John. You see, but you do not observe. Look at Hermione right now."
“Oh, I forgot, got careless with the accident and all.”
For those who skipped the last chapter, Mycroft and Victor are both injured after saving the day, they finally managed to capture a semblance of Moran that will enable them to track him to his real body.
"And you are just telling me now? After all this time? You are a real hypocrite John Watson. You, mad about me keeping secrets from you when you were withholding
“You utter shit. You haven’t changed a bit.”
“Yes. For a while, at least.”
She kissed his cheek.
"Sherlock Holmes! When you left the school, I finally became the best in our year. John."
“Too many younglings now. I’m not interested.”
“Care to explain for the rest of us?”
“Oooh, Vic, are you mad at me, darling?”
John sent a look of disbelief his way, before walking into the lift.
Sherlock turned to look at his friend, who was laying on the floor under the ministrations of the other two.
“The case which is no longer our concern. This is a Shadow World affair.”
Sebastian Wilkes was looking at him, clearly annoyed, wondering why Sherlock was wasting everybody’s time. So, once again, it was all in his head.
John sighed, and reached to grab the bridge of his nose in annoyance. Victor took it as a sign of victory, because he caught John’s arm again, carefully showing him he was using his right hand once more.
Sherlock's eyes widened in comprehension, and he placed the book in the hole and closed the cover from it safeguard. He tried to open it again, and when it didn't, he looked satisfied.
Luke’s eyes went wide as he shook John’s hand.
John tried to concentrate in their previous location. Nothing happened. He then worked up thoughts about a different place, Holmes Manor. Again, nothing. 221B.
His phone beeped.
John hand went to his knee, and Sherlock found himself staring at the hand and back at John all of a sudden.
He allowed himself to be guided by his partner and soon enough they were again in their room. He did his bedtime routine in automatic, watching as Sherlock did the same beside him, both wholly used to being around each other as if they had done this over and over and nothing had ever changed between them. John really must have done something right before, to deserve something like this, something that was perfect. When he finally reached the bed, it was to the sense of a warm body beside him, and that was pure bliss.
“Do we have time for breakfast at least?”
“Anything but that. Too dangerous. The Cold Peace is bringing trouble, John. The east wind is coming soon.”
"You can keep them closed, for now, memories overlapping are hard on the senses. You can open your eyes when Alissa commands the reconstruction. I can see the two men, just before they fall on their backs dead."
“I just wanted to say goodbye.”
At this Sherlock’s eyes widened, and John could see that there was no way out of the conversation now. Of course, his mad, brilliant flatmate, who he now fancied himself to be in love with,
He sat down on his chair, looking as if the world had ended. Watching the Iceman crumble was something John never thought he would witness in his lifetime. Sherlock raised Victor's wand and complied, then putting his brother to sleep. He then turned to Victor.
And he leaned forward towards John and whispered mischievously into his ear,
They reached the first floor and the Dai Llewellyn ward soon enough. They opened the door, and they could see Victor in his bed, mercifully sitting up and drinking a blood-coloured potion. Sherlock was sitting beside him, a fond look on his face, holding his left hand. Victor was the only patient in the ward, and he beamed back at John, his lips and teeth stained with red. John moved to the right side of the bed.
Hermione looked at both of them, and her mouth became a thin line of disapproval.
“At least he is not going to kill her. He wants her alive. Well, he wants my nephew alive.”
"My, a date already Mr Wood? You don't even know if I'm single. Which I am, not that you asked."
“Yes, yes, don’t get your knickers in a twist Johnny boy, I’ll be back early. Don’t you forget, I can’t imagine it would be easier to leave your baby girl now that you are not running after a murderer.”
They took a cab to the crime scene, and instead of pulling away from him and gaping at the window like he usually did, John remained close to Sherlock.
“I guess.”
"Different how?"
“It’s your fault! If you had a TARDIS of your own…”
“Fine. Spoilsport.”
“Is that a respectful way of speaking of your life partner and father of your child in front of a virtual stranger?”
John had produced a Patronus a couple of times before, while fighting in the Wizarding War, grasping on memories of his time with Oliver and his family. He wasn’t even sure he could produce a corporeal Patronus now even if he tried. Happy memories were hard to come by these days. On a whim, he pulled out his wand, focusing on the memories he just spent arranging together in the scrapbook.
“When Harry said his name. I simply knew. And I confirmed it when I saw that my mother’s maiden name was a common Shadowhunter family name, originally from France, as my mother’s family.”
“So you are not aliens?”
Sherlock scoffed at him, rolling his eyes, and they wandered, John merely trying to put some distance between Sherlock and Clara, until they bumped into Oliver, who was looking behind his back at where Victoria stood surrounded by Roman and a circle of fans who kept getting bigger by the second.
I suck at linking but this is the reference:
"Yes and no. Rich widow. No progeny. Very skilled witch, and worked for the French Ministry of Magic. She was Gabrielle's superior a few years back when she started. She wasn't law enforcement at the beginning; she was into muggle-wizard relations. This woman was the liaison with the muggles in the government. Old money, I used to come here as a child. Her mother was a good friend of
He kept smiling as he told John that and headed for the exit.
He turned to look at John now.
“Fine by me.”
“Sherlock?”
John thought all first times with a new partner were supposed to feel a little awkward, but he and Sherlock just seemed to be made for each other. No words were needed, as they both explored each other, taking their time, washing away years of uncertainty. After they got their release and finally scrubbed each other clean, he could feel Sherlock’s mood improving; he seemed happy with whatever ‘sorting’ he made with Harry in his office. They got dressed and met Victoria in the hallway, as she was exiting her room. She was wearing a beautiful pink dress and pink heels, with a checkered pink coat.
He looked offended and retreated his hand, before adding,
“Amazing. You even have the same grey hairs.”
"Stupefy!!!"
“I need a hole in the wall, which you would close as soon as I throw the thing.”
“Mr Trevor, I’m honoured to meet the topmost achiever in transfiguration in this century.”
“I need to send a message to my mother and it will.”
“Well, as you surely already know this is my partner.”
“I hate Fiendfyre.”
"Harry and Alissa can't see or hear us. But we can listen to them, see what they see. This one is from Harry's point of view, so what he saw will be highlighted."
“I meant it, you know.”
“Do. Not. Call. Me. That.”
"So your brother is indeed expecting you. This door only appears when the staff is expecting someone outside the Department. It changes depending who is on the other side. Black is your brother's office directly. Most people he allows in his office appear through the Floo Network, so he knows you'll be using this way then."
“Aye, Captain. Everybody, back up to the walls. They might notice the hole and start shooting through it.”
"You'll have to lend me that one, darling. Even if it's false, it'll be a hoot to watch."
“So, enough of that. What have you been up to? Deduced anything from the lady’s journal by now?”
“And what do you think I am, Mr. Bane?”
“Do you think this is going to affect their timeline?”
"I know you are mad, and you feel betrayed Mary, believe me, I do."
“I realized who you were as soon as I met your dear sister here. When she took the post and finally agreed to meet with me, it was obvious. My brother, living with one of the Sun twins. Talk about twisted fate. I’ve been protecting him from the Clave my whole life, shielding him from the Shadow World. But he goes and falls for one of the oldest warlocks alive in the world, a man who is known to be a recluse and not very nice. A bit of a hermit. People talked, you see. Even other warlocks. They said you had gone crazy with age.”
“Time to fight like muggles!”
“Can we do side along again? I’m bored, so I’ll probably wind up in Siberia if I do it alone.”
, who knew? But John knew his heart. He wanted to move back to Baker Street with his baby girl, share his space again with his mad infuriating flatmate who sulked like a toddler and walked around naked in a sheet and who went days without talking. He loved the man, loved him so dearly that it had taken marriage and the threat of separating again for him to come to terms with it.
He barely remembered seeing John, and someone else.
“Stop it, John.”
"No, no, just being a masochist I think. I've archived my brother in such a way in my mind, that only the mention of his name triggers the memory. It's like having a panic room in the mind palace. When someone enters the proper combination, the information flows. I didn't delete him but stored him such a way I can't access it regularly.

Victor held him tighter, and then released him and kissed his cheek, smirking. John guessed whatever Sherlock thought before; things were back to normal, whatever normal meant between them.
