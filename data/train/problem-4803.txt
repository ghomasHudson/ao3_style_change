With a final exasperated sigh, Crowley spun around and left the office in a huff. Dick Roman leaned back in his chair and ran his hands through his hair. Sam was surprised he was letting his guard down so obviously in front of him, but somehow, he’d managed to get in his boss’s good graces.
His reminiscing is interrupted when they pull up to Commander Michael’s mansion. It makes the Rolstons’ house look modest. Dean wonders if that means Commander Michael is even more important than Commander Alistair.
“What’s up?” Gabe asks him.
“I thought we could have a picnic,” Anna explained when she saw Castiel’s look of confusion. She pulled out a little basket that she’d been balancing behind her saddle. He’d wondered what that was.
He looked up and noticed that Benny was staring at him with an odd look on his face. He probably wanted to say something, but luckily he seemed to know his place as a new member of their garrison and kept quiet. Castiel finished his last bite of InstaMash with a grimace and got up to wash his bowl out in the sink. Then he picked up his pistol and mentally prepared himself to go meet with the rest of the captains.
“I’m fine,” she answers quickly.
After a few more seconds, the Alpha pulls away, and Dean can breathe again. “Goodnight, pet.”
“No, thank you,” Dean says. He just wants to go to sleep.
Castiel can’t bring himself to try and take another bite of his turkey wrap because every time he tries, he ends up getting a glob of ranch dressing on his pants. White colored dressing is exactly the worst kind of dressing to accidentally spill on pants for obvious reasons.
She does an exaggerated bow. “That’s why I’m the Queen.”
Maybe it was too hard for him to open up without being prodded. The problem was that Dean wanted to know everything about him, even things he didn’t know how to ask for. “How old are you?” He figured that was a simple enough question, and it was one he’d been dying to know the answer to. He knew there was a big age difference between the two of them, but it would've been nice to know for sure. Blue was too agile, and his reflexes were too fast for him to be
Gabriel and Balthazar both looked a bit uncomfortable, and Dean was staring down at the sleeping bag he was sitting on as if it held all the answers.
“I’m—" Castiel started, but Dean couldn't let him finish. He didn't want to hear Castiel say he was sorry. He didn't want his pity. He didn't want to let him off the hook for putting him through hell since the moment they met.
Dean looks similarly disheveled, but somehow still looks attractive and in control of himself. How is that possible? He looks towards Dean and opens his mouth to speak, but nothing comes out.
“Okay,” he said quietly. Dean leaned down to kiss him on his left ass cheek, and Castiel felt like his face was on fire. He couldn't believe this was actually happening. He felt Dean’s strong hands gently spread his cheeks to expose his hole and felt himself clench automatically.
“Of course you would’ve known all of this if any of you had bothered to ask us how our interview went,” Crowley picks a piece of lint off of his suit jacket. Nobody asks Crowley for a single detail, not even Dean. Castiel is proud of his friends. There’s no reason to give him the satisfaction. “Anyways, Brady,” Crowley says again. “Can I have one of those CDs to give Ronald?”
“This is about the Dolce Vita, yes?” The man asked. Dean was sure his face showed his confusion. “I’m assuming you’re still in the market for it. It’s the same vessel.”
“Please tell me you haven't been here for the past six years, Charlie,” Blue said before sitting down and putting his feet up on the table. Dean assumed they knew each other really well since he was making himself at home, and Charlie apparently also knew his real name.
“I’m trying, Dean,” Castiel tried to reassure him. “I can’t find anything though. What should I do?” Dean didn't answer him, he just sniffled a little bit.
“Why?” He asks innocently. “Is something going on?”
~ * ~
He printed off the code sheet and went into Dick’s private office to make the calls where it was quieter. He could feel Charlie’s eyes on his as he passed her desk, but she didn't say anything. She was busy showing Roman and Crowley a map of the various streets around the embassy.
They all start laughing hysterically, and Dean barely hears the actor ask “Who is this? How did you get my number??” Balthazar grabs the phone back from Cas and hangs up, blushing fiercely.
It was late by this point, and he should probably try to get some sleep. He only had a week to train Dean for the Combat Zone. He used to be terrified at the prospect of having so little time to train him, but now he couldn’t wait for the week to be over. Heading to the Combat Zone would give them the excuse they needed to get out of here at least for a little while. Castiel knew he’d have to come back here after they made the money they needed, because he couldn’t leave his garrison here to fend for themselves. Though once their mission was complete, he was gone for good. He was taking his people and getting the hell out of dodge at the first opportunity.
“Fine, but I can’t believe we’re going to let him get away with this,” Balthazar crosses his arms.
Dean could hear Charlie making some sort of scraping sound in the bathroom stall next to him. Since he was the only male omega in Purgatory, he didn’t get a separate bathroom. He had to share with the girls.
Dean sat down in the chair on Abaddon’s other side, shooting Castiel a quick glare behind her back. The difference between today and a few weeks ago was that instead of glaring back, Castiel gave him a hint of a smile. Maybe they were making some progress.
Castiel’s jaw dropped, and he suddenly felt like his childhood best friend was a complete stranger. “Well, I’m not sure my mom will be okay with that, but we can try.” This would be the first time he’d ever crossed his fingers for his mother to meddle. He could feel Balthazar’s and Gabriel’s eyes on him, trying to gauge his reaction, but he didn't want them to see he was also panicking so he turned away. How was he supposed to win a kissing bet with Dean when the thought of kissing someone twisted his insides into knots? Maybe he should ask Crowley for help since apparently he was the kissing expert out of the four of them.
He wasn't sure how it happened, but somehow he ended up in a long, dark hallway, and he didn't know how to get back into the main part of the building. Before he had a chance to start panicking, he felt a cold hand grab his shoulder.
“That’ll give you even more Christmas spending money,” Gabriel mocks.
“Actually it is kind of like that,” Crowley mused. “I went to a boy/girl party when I was visiting my extended family in Scotland, and I kissed so many girls I lost count of them all. We basically went around in a circle and dared each other to kiss people.”
Castiel thought for a minute. He wasn't sure how this happened, but he definitely didn't want to appear to be on the outside of things. “I spilled my cereal right before I left so I had to change,” he fibbed. He heard Dean stifle a chuckle next to him and turned around to glare at him. Again Dean gave him an innocent smile. He did this. Castiel just didn't know how.
“Maybe I’m just getting used to feeling like I might die at any moment,” He responded sourly.
“You mean
“Don’t worry about it. I have plenty.”
Dean woke up to an empty room. He had no idea how much time had passed, since there were no windows. He was able to take in some of his surroundings though. Last night there had only been a few candles see by. This morning there were florescent lights on the ceiling humming faintly. They seemed pretty dim, and he wondered if they were on some sort of timer to mimic natural sunlight cycles. He stretched and took in the rest of the room. There was a desk with a computer on it. He knew what computers were, but they didn't have one at the farm and he'd never used one. He wondered idly if it worked. There was also an assortment of guns and weapons on the wall, which was a bit disturbing. He knew there was a lock on the door to Blue's quarters as well as the bedroom, but that didn't mean Dean couldn't grab one of these guns and give the man a morning surprise.
“Last year he tried and failed to juggle three bottles of champagne. You should’ve seen it!” Anna laughed. “He does something ridiculous every year, it’s hilarious!” Dean hated to think it, but he was actually excited to go to the party now that he knew he had someone on his side. Maybe it would be fun after all.
Luke and Marv are next. They drone on and on about how it’s time for Hancock to have a new crew in charge. Their entire speech is basically a hit piece on Castiel and his friends without ever mentioning them by name. “Boring,” Castiel mouths to Dean, pretending he’s falling asleep. There’s a smattering of applause from the audience, but nothing like the cheers Benny and Garth got. Principal Richings takes the microphone again when they’re done to reiterate that this isn’t a popularity contest, even though everyone knows that’s exactly what it is.
“Easy there, David Letterman,” Castiel laughed mockingly.
Sam hated working with Roman and Crowley breathing right down his neck, but he did understand why they were doing it. If they hadn’t had their eyes on him this whole time, he probably would’ve tried to contact Dean by this point.
“Wait,” Another man yelled from the darkness. “I’m claiming this one, Boss.” Dean knew that gravely voice. It was Blue. Sure enough, the man stepped forward into the light, and Dean could see it definitely was him.
“Do it!” Cole shouted. “I’m dead already! And so are you.”
Castiel could feel his heart beating faster. He knew he wasn’t ready for this. He started walking even faster, so he could barely hear Gabriel interrupt Dean to remind him that it’d been six months since Castiel’s incident and that he’d been cleared to work in the field. Gabriel’s tone was harsh but professional. Castiel knew that his half-brother didn’t want to look like he was giving him special favors, but he also wasn't going to stand by and let someone trash talk him. Castiel appreciated that.
“I’m not a kid,” Dean said bitterly. “I’m eighteen.”
He goes back to kissing Cas’s neck and lets his teeth lightly graze the skin there to see if he can get more of those sweet noises out of him. “
“I want to find a girlfriend,” Dean sighed. “Maybe then my life won’t be so depressing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean…”
Dean stares at it for a moment before his face lights up in a smile. “You are a genius, Charlie!”
“Yes, please, Mrs. Rolston,” he answers. She hands him the cup, and he takes a small sip, closing his eyes as the flavor explodes on his tongue. It’s wonderful.
“Why are you so nervous?” Andrew May asks, pointing at his shaking hands with the gun.
“Woah, why so low?” Benny asked. “I got a perfect thirty. According to the quiz that means I have a ‘sunny personality.’ What’d you put for question three?”
The moment is ruined when one of the wives comes over and snatches the pup away from him. As she walks back to the center of the room where the rest of the wives are, Dean can hear her say quietly, “Let’s get you away from there.” He tries his best not to roll his eyes.
“See what?” He asks.
“Thank you, Dean,” he says quietly because he doesn’t know what else he could possibly say right now.
“What did you do?” Castiel asks.
“I’m not a kid,” Dean said again without much force this time.
“I know I don’t,” Castiel says quietly, “But I thought I was starting to get to know you.”
He sits down next to Bela when he gets into the van. Another omega he doesn’t recognize is sitting on his other side. She grabs his hands and says, “Isn’t this wonderful?”
“Yes sir,” Dean answers.
A few minutes later he heard a tentative knock on the door. “Cassie.” It was Gabriel. “We’re going to start setting up the gazebo. Are you coming?”
Blue surprised him by laughing. It was a sound Dean didn’t hear from him often, but he enjoyed it every time he did. “That’s so mean,” Blue said, still chuckling.
“You have to help him,” Sam said quietly, and Charlie stiffened. “It has to be you. I can’t do anything. They’re watching me constantly.”
Ofmarv gives him a sad look. “They weren’t going to let any of us get out. Not if you were an omega.” They stop in front of the Rolstons’ house, and he puts his hand on the gate latch. He doesn’t want to leave yet. He’s finally found someone he can talk to. “It’s nice to finally meet you,” Ofmarv says in goodbye.
“I will do what is required of me,” Sam said quietly.
“Then he realized it would take hours to clean up all of the blood,” Gabriel said from his seat across from Sam, “So for his next kill, he brings the rope.”
“Okay, back to work, guys!” Gabriel rummaged through all the pots and pans they’d brought down, being insanely noisy about it as usual.
The store is full of omegas and betas doing their shopping. As usual, the doors and check-out stations are guarded by Guardians holding machine guns. He’s always wondered why that level of military force is required. Nobody would be stupid enough to try and start an uprising in the produce section.
Seeing the sadness and exhaustion in Dean’s usually lively eyes had scared him even more than hearing Mr. Winchester yelling. In that moment, all of this petty fighting started to seem really pointless. In that moment, he’d wanted nothing more than to apologize and pull the other boy into a hug to try and comfort him in any way he could. Of course, Dean hadn’t wanted that. Why would he? He could probably barely stand to look at Castiel after everything he’d put him through.
9:25pm
He’d be lying if he said the things Dean had told him at the diner hadn’t freaked him out. Those passports were definitely real. Or they were fake, but they were
Dean dropped Cas’s duffel bag and his bank bag on the bed. The only vacancy in this shitty hotel was a one-bedroom room, so it looked like they’d have to share tonight. Dean didn't mind sharing a bed with Cas, but he was going to have a hard time keeping his hands to himself.
Castiel’s mouth drops open as he wracks his brain trying to figure out what is going on. He may have betrayed them in the past, but he’s really been working to turn over a new leaf recently. He’s been trying to leave his bullying self in the past. He has no idea what they could possibly be mad at him about. “How am I the Brutus?” He asks. “You’re the ones who joined Crowley’s army.”
Dean closes his eyes as he feels the speculum enter him. It doesn’t hurt, but it feels really weird. The doctor checks him out for a moment and then removes the speculum. “You are very fertile,” he says in shock. Even doctors aren’t used to seeing fertile male omegas, Dean guesses. Then the doctor continues under his breath, “Doesn’t matter though because Rolston is probably sterile. Most of those guys are.”
“You hear that Dean-o?” Gabriel asks. “Call Castiel!” Dean immediately hangs up the phone and dials Castiel’s number.
“No, he would’ve known,” Charlie insisted. “They have to be taken every day or there are extreme withdrawal symptoms. During training the subjects are forced to experience what withdrawal feels like, so they won’t go off the pills by choice.” Sam felt like he was going to be sick. “Every time they complete a task, they are given their next supply of pills. This encourages them to complete their tasks without question.”
“He's heading to the library right now,” Sam says as he walks down the hallway. A few inmates jeer at him as he passes by their cells, but he ignores them. “Is there a way to monitor what he browses? He might try to contact our unsub.”
“Actually Leia and Han Solo if you want to be more specific.”
“Sam, wait,” Charlie interrupted before he could hang up. “Are you angry at me or something?”
“That’s just what Bela heard,” Dean whispered back, trying to calm himself down as well as her. “She’s a drama queen. You can’t trust what she says.”
He’s currently paired up with a guy named Luke Morningstar for the drills. Apparently Luke’s parents own Morningstar Farms which is where Anna and Castiel ride their horses together. Luke has also been particularly friendly to Dean since he joined the team. By this point, Dean’s learned to assume that everyone here has ulterior motives for everything they do. That’s probably not a healthy mindset, but he hasn’t been proven wrong so far. He assumes Luke is being nice to him because he knows he and Castiel are neighbors. In Dean’s experience at this school so far, the only reason people talk to him is to see if he’s close with Castiel. When they find out he’s not, they go back to ignoring him. As much as his neighbor infuriates and confuses him, Dean is impressed at how he seems to have the entire class wrapped around his long, delicate fingers. Not that Dean has been paying attention to Castiel’s hands or daydreaming about what those hands could do. That would be absurd.
“Ofal!” It’s Benny. Dean hears the burly man’s lumbering footsteps racing up the stairs. He is not looking forward to having to go spend hours in labor with whatever omega is giving birth today. “It’s the birth-mobile,” Benny says, as if Dean hadn’t been able to hear the sirens. Benny brings forward Dean’s cloak and helps him put it on even though it’s still soaking wet. “Hurry, they won’t wait all day.”
Balthazar sashays out of the dressing room in one of the new sweaters. It fits him perfectly, but Castiel is too upset to compliment him. “Hey, Zar, do you have a water bottle in your backpack? I’m thirsty,” he says, shooting a glare towards Gabriel daring him to say anything. Gabriel stays quiet, looking down at his shoes. Balthazar hands his backpack over to Castiel, and he immediately starts rifling through it.
“He uses the exact same method to make his bombs as you did,” Castiel says. He doesn’t want to get a rise out of the prisoner, but he wants him to at least acknowledge that Castiel is here. Gadreel is a textbook psychopath, incapable of empathy. Playing to his emotions won’t get him anywhere, but Castiel has had plenty of experience dealing with men like him.
He stands there with his neck open for a moment. It’s almost like he can feel Castiel physically trying to restrain himself from scenting him. Scenting a matched omega is a crime punishable by losing an eye, but Dean is just teasing him. Besides, the Commander is at work, Mistress Abbadon is upstairs in her room, and Benny is busy in the kitchen.
“How do I find them?” Dean asks. Before he can get a response, he feels his cloak being tugged from behind. It’s Ofmarv.
was a disgrace to the Great Alpha.”
“I’m fine,” Castiel replies evenly.
“Svenson clammed up,” Gabriel says. “I don’t have time to get it out of him.”
Jim left the cabin, and Garth quickly cleared off his desk. The ship was too small to have an infirmary, so this would have to do. In a past life he was a dentist. Even though he wasn't a doctor, he did have the most medical training out of anyone on board. Usually he was just required to patch up the occasional fishing injury. Sometimes people got hooks stuck in places they shouldn’t be or they got heat stroke from being outside in the sun for too long. Those were things he could handle. He already knew this was going to be way beyond his area of expertise.
“There are a few hundred agents working in this area,” Sam says skeptically. “Senator Pike must know quite a few of them. This could take a while to narrow down.”
Gabriel nods. “Okay. Stand-by.” He walks back to the rest of the group. They all watch as Sam sits down, and the man holds a gun to him.
“I’ll need an unsexy costume if I want my parents to let me out of the house,” Balthazar sighed. Castiel still thought it was pretty ironic that Zar’s parents were the strictest out of all of theirs, when he was probably the most deviant of the bunch. It was a wonder he hadn’t ended up in juvie yet.
Dean quickly hung up the phone. That was his voice, but he had absolutely no memory of saving that voice message or of living in Paris at all. At least now he knew his real identity was Dean Winchester, the American living abroad in Paris for some reason. That was a lot more than he'd had yesterday.
“I don’t know,” Castiel responds, continuing to walk briskly. His long legs are making it hard for Gabe and Balthazar to keep up. “Maybe he figured it out. He’s not dumb, and like you said there’s already rumors about your dad and the actress who plays Dr. Piccolo hooking up.”
“Signature? Like The Zodiac symbol?” Charlie asks.
Jessica shakes her head. “Not really. The officer in charge said it took him two hours just to agree to sending a cell phone inside so we can communicate with him.” Castiel nods. “The problem is he says he won’t speak to anyone other than who he calls the ‘Supreme Entity’.”
“One moment.” This time he was put on hold. He got up to start pacing back and forth in the office, trying and failing not to think about how Cas was probably scrubbing himself down in the shower not ten feet from where he was standing.
Castiel blacked out.
“Fuck, Cas, I haven’t even touched you yet,” Dean groaned, pressing the full length of his body against his own. Dean was wearing a flannel over-shirt with a plain grey t-shirt underneath. Nothing about his outfit could’ve prepared Castiel for the solid feeling of muscle that was pressed up against his chest right now. It was totally unfair that Dean would be blessed with a perfect face
He turned to look towards Dean, but his silent companion was still staring moodily out the window. It was as if he hadn’t been listening to a single thing Castiel had said this entire trip. He sighed and shut up, which was what he should’ve done several kilometers ago.
Dean couldn't believe he was stooping to the level of making fun of someone’s appearance. He felt the guilt rear its ugly head, but he pushed it down.
Castiel looks at him for a second before continuing. “You seem very tense, Dean,” he says, and Dean immediately tenses further. “I’m not trying to pry, but if it isn’t too forward, I’d like to suggest some techniques to help you stay calm during stressful situations. I have a book I could lend you.”
Dean scoffs, “This isn’t already fucked up?”
“Whatever,” Crowley delicately picks something out of his teeth with a toothpick. “I don’t want your sloppy seconds,” he says pointedly towards Gabriel. He’s obviously still bitter that the two of them got to play Seven Minutes in Heaven at the party. “I’m going to go work on my campaign for the rest of our time. I’ve still got soooo much left to do before the vote on Saturday.” That reminds Castiel, he has so much to do this week if he’s going to launch a successful campaign in a matter of days.
Was Dean really going to make him spell it out? “I mean, you and me,” Castiel said helplessly. “Us.”
Sam clicks a few times on the keyboard before he pulls up the correct information. “It’s not him.”
He can hear Sam mumbling on the other end of the line, but he’s not sure if he’s meant to hear it. “Think outside the box. Think outside the box.” There’s a momentary pause. Castiel is about to speak again when Sam says, “I think I’ve got it! There has to be a listening device in the Pikes’ house.”
“Wow.” Castiel feels like he’s been punched in the stomach. He turns and leaves the store, walking straight through the metal detector and into the throng of holiday shoppers. Balthazar runs after him.
As he starts to head out of the living room, the grumpy wife groans, “Whores, the lot of them.” She has no shame! She didn’t even wait until he was out of the fucking room.
“None at the moment, but she’s in the market for a Jeep.”
As Charlie would probably say if she was here, “Anfangen ist leicht, beharren eine Kunst, bitches!”
He turns his attention back to Gabriel as he starts to go over the profile. “Bombers tend to be non-confrontational. If you happened to bump into him on the sidewalk, he would apologize profusely. We’re classifying this bomber as highly organized based on the meticulous nature of his crimes, which means he has above average intelligence. He probably has a career where he’s able to work alone. This would give him the privacy he needs to work on his bombs.”
“That felt… good,” Castiel said hesitantly.
Castiel tries his best to keep his voice light when he answers, “Yeah I’m doing okay,” but he isn’t. He’s far from okay. Ever since he saw that news clip of the live bombing, all he sees when he closes his eyes is Samandriel’s lifeless body and blood on his own hands.
Gabriel speaks up again, “Nichols was able to tell the paramedics who arrived on the scene that the package was on his front porch, and he was moving it to his car when it went off.”
This isn’t good. There’s no way that powerful Alpha Commander Michael gives a flying crap about Claire. He knotted her to get a pup, and he might be fucking her on the side like some Alphas do, but he doesn’t love her. There’s no way he’d leave this mansion and his upper class position to go on the run with a fifteen year old omega and brand new baby. She’s probably just creating this fantasy romance in her mind to cope with the trauma of being repeatedly raped and watching her pup get taken from her. Either that or he has been promising these things to get some action on the side.
“Yeah, I don’t usually wear nice dress clothes, but Crowley said I looked good in them so I’ll take his word for it,” Dean sat down at his desk and propped his feet up.
Monday, November 16
“Bombers are usually cowards,” Gabriel explains. “He’s not going to want to fight his way out.” He turns to the young agent. “Jo, do you want to come with me? We’ll go through the back of the building.”
“Give me a second,” Castiel said through clenched teeth. He tried to focus on evening out his breathing, and it took him a few moments to notice the litany of praises coming from Dean’s mouth next to his ear.
“It’s done, cher,” Benny chuckled. “Okay moving on!” He launched into a hilarious story about a girl named Andrea he’d been trying to ask out on a date. Dean couldn't stop smiling throughout the rest of their lunch period. He looked up a couple times to see that Castiel was staring at him from across the room again.
Saturday, October 31
“Maybe,” Dean shrugs.
“She’s alive,” the woman said, looking down at Krissy adoringly. “My baby…”
“I’m fine,” Dean replied, tearing his eyes away from the crowd below them.
It’s a little awkward and clumsy at first, but in some ways that makes it even better. The fact that Dean is the first person to do this with Cas lights a fire within him. He moves one hand to Cas’s jaw and slowly strokes his lightly stubbled cheek back and forth to calm him down. He feels Cas sigh again, and Dean captures it with the next kiss. As much as he wants to take things to the next level and finally get the chance to really taste Cas, he knows he needs to keep it slow. After all, they’re just practicing.
Castiel hung up the phone and threw it on his bed. “Come on, I have to show you the guest house.”
Castiel turned his steely blue eyes on Dean, hoping to use his gift for intimidating stare-downs to get some answers from the other boy. Dean gave away absolutely nothing, but flashed him a warm smile. A smile after everything they’d done to him yesterday at the pool? Castiel’s eyes narrowed further. Something wasn’t adding up here.
She’s wearing a dinosaur onesie and holding a book. “I’m a Thesaurus Rex,” she explains, holding up the thesaurus for him to see. Castiel hates punny costumes, but he knows Gabriel is going to be head-over-heels in love when he sees her. He constantly makes terrible puns. “So are these the infamous costumes we’ve been hearing about?” Kali looks him up and down, but he wishes Lisa had noticed his costume instead. She’s too busy straightening out Meg’s purple witches’ wig.
Dean didn’t know what to say. “I’m sorry, man.”
“Do we have to?”
3:25pm
4:47pm
She sighs and closes her eyes, enjoying the feeling of the sun on her skin. These simple pleasures are all she has left. She hears the front door of the house open and then close. Then she hears someone’s footsteps approaching her. They’re too quiet to be her new Alpha’s. That means it’s probably the wife.
They head over to the display of peaches in the center of the store and the three omegas begin filling up their bags with fresh fruit. He stands by the display staring blankly at the peaches in front of him. It hasn’t escaped his notice that he’s the only male in the store apart from the Guardians. For about the millionth time he hates himself for his gender designation. Why couldn’t he have been born an Alpha like his brother? His chest hurts when he thinks of him.
“I’d definitely pick the loveless relationship,” Crowley leaned back on his sleeping bag. “You never said anything about the sex being bad.” He winked at the others.
“I left all of my raider armor here so that they’d think I was just a farmer boy,” Dean explained. Castiel wanted to point out that Dean
Dean looks at him awkwardly for a moment. “Let’s just do it another time,” he says.
“This is twenty-six year old, Ashley Frank,” Bobby pointed to the picture of the woman on the projector screen. “While she was at work on Wednesday, she opened up an email with a time-delayed virus attached to it. The virus completely wiped her hard-drive of everything except this message.” Bobby clicked a key to make another image pop up.
“What are you doing here?” Crowley asks. “You weren’t invited.”
a farmer boy but figured he probably shouldn’t since he was already angry about something. “A guy named Gabriel helped me sneak in by pretending I was a trader from Quincy.”
Castiel took a deep breath to prepare himself and then squeezed his eyes closed as Dean pressed two fingers into him this time. He already felt so full. How was Dean going to be able to fit his dick in him?
Mistress Abbadon shushes her and kneels down to get closer to Dean’s level since he’s sitting. “Ofal knows how. She’s done it before.” She smiles at him, “Isn’t Anael beautiful?”
“My mom used to tell me stories like that, but I don’t know, it seems so implausible.”
He wasn’t cut out for this. He didn’t know how to be a father. He especially didn’t know how to be a father to a fourteen year old omega.
“Yes, Alpha,” he moans. His Alpha continues to lick at the omega as if he’s dining at a five star restaurant. It’s dirty and wrong and fucking hot. He never knew that it was possible to feel this way.
Castiel rolls his eyes again. “My life sucks,” he mumbles under his breath. He knows he’s being dramatic, but he has no idea what’s going on with his friends, and now he doesn’t even have new outfits to keep him sane.
“Dean?” Cas’s concerned voice broke him out of his thoughts. “Where did you go just now? Did you remember something?”
“Yes, I am,” Castiel said and then moved forward to lean into Luke’s personal space. Even though Luke was taller than him, he knew he could be intimidating when he wanted to be. “But since you think I’m, quote, ‘slipping’ and that I’m, quote, ‘not in charge like I was last year,’ don’t expect an invitation.” The four of them walked away, leaving two mortified boys and a mangled pumpkin behind them.
“May the Great Alpha make me fruitful,” he parrots the standard reply.
“My eardrums,” Castiel covered his ears, but Dean was too excited to care.
“Hi,” Castiel responded simply. Chuck walked around the huge mahogany dining table to wrap his arm around Castiel’s shoulder.
Tuesday, September 8
“My number one is on in two hours,” Crowley said instead. “You should come watch and see how it’s done.” He looked at Dean when he said this, because obviously Blue already knew all about how things were done around here.
Castiel closed the door and leaned up against it. He ignored the kid and turned to Meg. “Gordon and Zach are working against us. Ruby just told me.”
, he thinks to himself.
“Hang on a second,” Sam says, pointing at the video that’s still showing live grainy footage of what’s happening on the bus. “Could you back that up a few frames?” Jessica nods and rewinds the video a few seconds until the unsub is facing towards where the camera is. She presses play again, and Castiel notices what must’ve caught Sam’s eye. The left side of the unsub’s face pinches up into a grimace. It looks like he has some sort of facial tic. “Tardive dyskinesia,” Sam says with a nod.
Jo is already hard at work by the time Sam and Dean show up. Her desk is right across from Dean’s so the two of them face each other. There is a little partition to separate the desks, but they can see each other over it. Dean often uses that to make funny faces at her whenever they happen to look up at the same time. Sam’s desk is across the walkway from theirs. There is another desk across from his, but it’s empty at the moment. There’s technically another opening at the BAU for a fourth profiler, but Bobby is very picky about who he allows onto the team. He’ll only fill the spot when he finds the perfect candidate.
“Huh?” Castiel asked, still hugging his dad.
Cas walked them, still hand-in-hand, to the far end of the garage that was mostly empty except for an old black muscle car. Dean’s interest was piqued. Even though he had no memory of this car, he felt something inside of him light up at the sight of it. Maybe his memories were still buried deep down inside of him, but he just couldn’t access them.
Dean lays back on his bed listening to the two messages multiple times. He knows he’s being lame, but he’s finally starting to feel like he fits in here. That’s something even his dad can’t take away from him.
sex,” she lowers her voice into a whisper.
Dean checked over his shoulder a couple times on the way back to the car, but nothing suspicious jumped out at him. They were pretty far away from Zurich by this point, so they were probably in the clear. Cas started the car, and they pulled out of the diner’s parking lot and got back on the highway. Cas was quiet. He was probably absorbing everything Dean said in the diner. Either that or he was trying to figure out the best way to ditch him. The silence combined with the quiet purr of the engine finally lulled Dean to sleep.
Gabriel shook his head. “We won’t look at a suspect list until after we’ve finished our profile. We want to make sure the profile we give you is unbiased.”
“Unsub?” Jo asked.
“What is the number for?” Cas asked.
“Hello, Alfie. How are you?”
“And if he’s convinced the chip is in his arm, he’ll be able to watch what we’re doing which will make it harder to trick him,” Castiel says. Dean looks over towards the new liaison, Jessica. She looks worried.
6:50pm
“What does that mean?” Jessica asks.
Dean ran over to the man and grabbed the bag he was holding, throwing it over towards Cas. “Look in that! Tell me what’s inside!”
Friday, September 11
Dean felt his heartbeat stutter. It was bad enough that he’d developed quite an attraction to his straight next door neighbor who hated him. He couldn't let that attraction turn into an unrequited crush.
He stood up and tiptoed quietly to the bathroom to take a shower. When he got out, he had to clear the condensation that had formed on the mirror with his hand. His beard was getting a bit thicker every day. He was still recognizable, especially to whoever the trained assassins were who were after him, but his looks might be able to fool the local police. When he opened the door to step out of the bathroom, he saw that Cas was looking around the room frantically. Dean moved forward cautiously, and when Cas’s eyes landed on him, he sighed with relief.
“Are you done already?”
“Leather pants!” Balthazar shouts, and then covers his mouth when the rest of them shush him. They don’t want people overhearing them and copying their costumes.
His phone rings at the same time as he finishes drying himself off. The caller is unidentified. “Hello?” He answers it. “Oh hi, Alfie… you’re RSVP’ing to the party? Uh-huh… well why are you calling
“Why not?” Dean asked. “They’re doing what they can to clean up the Wasteland, and there’s a loyalty between the soldiers. It’s like a family,” Dean laughed as he tried to explain what seemed so obvious to him. “A bunch of people who you know you can trust and who have your back, and the fulfillment of doing what you can to help other people. What’s not to like about that?”
“I said I don’t know!” Dick yelled as the elevator finally reached their floor. “I liked it better when I thought he was dead.” The two of them practically ran to their office. They had a lot of work to do.
“I just fainted, Mrs. Rolston,” Dean answers meekly.
Dean leans his head back against the back seat and closes his eyes, letting the sound of the rain on the roof calm his racing thoughts.
Thankfully Gabriel walks into the room before Sam has a chance to continue. “One minute, guys. Everyone get ready.” They walk back to the living room where the phone is set up and all take up their spots. Sam sits down at the table and puts his headphones back on. Castiel and Gabriel sit down on either side of Larry Pike while Jo stands over next to Alfie to help keep him relaxed. Dean walks over to stand behind Sam. From that angle he can see what Sam takes notes on. He can see from across the table that Larry Pike is shaking like a leaf. He shoots a pointed look at Castiel to do something. The other agent leans over towards Senator Pike. “Remember to keep your voice steady, and agree with anything he says. We’ll be here to help you if you need it.”
Castiel wonders how long it’s going to take for him to get used to traveling the United States at the drop of a hat, not to mention the fact that they get to do it in a fancy private jet. The seats towards the front half of the plane have small tables in front of them that everyone has spread out their files on. Castiel takes a sip of his coffee and tries his best to focus on what his teammates are discussing, but his anxiety is through the roof right now. He’d been hoping they wouldn’t have to work on a bombing case for a while. He’s not ready.
“I’ll tell you guys at the sleepover tonight,” he replies. That should give him enough time to come up with something.
Dean didn’t want to read too far into what he was feeling. He was taking comfort in a situation where there wasn't much comfort to be found. Was there really anything wrong with that?
“Displeases me?” His Alpha says, stepping into his line of sight to gently stroke his jaw. “It does the opposite.”
Abbadon picks up her needles and resumes her knitting. “Go back to your room.” She doesn’t say it angrily, but her voice leaves no room for further argument.
Tuesday, November 17
Benny caught up to Cole in no time since he had help from the tracker. The other agent seemed to be surveying the alleyways around a seedy hotel. Did Cole think Dean was in there? He followed behind him at a safe distance, close enough that he wouldn't lose him, but far away enough that he wouldn't be detected. Cole seemed to be focusing on one particular side of the building. As Benny watched, he saw two silhouettes in the light from one of the windows. Was Dean still running with that Novak guy? That seemed awfully risky. Benny wondered how Dean even knew about the Novaks. He was the one surveilling them, not Dean.
“I’m sorry, but I can’t allow either of you to interact with this unsub any further.” Dean puts as much authority as he can into his voice. Gabriel gave him the lead, and he intends to be as professional as possible. “If you want to be able to hear what’s going on, you can wait in the living room with Jo and Jessica.” The two of them look like they’re going to complain, but then Dean figures they realize they’re lucky they’ll be allowed to listen in at all. Before Jo can leave, Dean grabs her hand and leans down to quietly tell her something. “Do
“By the river?” Dean teases.
In this chapter the switches between the two were intentionally meant to be a bit confusing since he was sick, but in the future I would make the transitions smoother. I hope you enjoyed it!
“I might’ve told her you’re my boyfriend.”
“Why’d you follow me?” Dean suddenly asked, turning to face his brother. Sam could now see the pain behind Dean’s eyes, which he was clearly trying to push down and hide away.
“We’re going to go and cook up some grub,” Bobby continued, “Feel free to join us.”
He’d also had the stupid idea of letting everyone arrive on their own, in their own time so he couldn’t ask any of his friends for help as he didn’t know if they were already inside or not. And Sam had arrived with Eileen, so even his own brother couldn’t help him out.
So they're going to do it. They're going to try and date each other for one month, of course with their rule in place it should be easy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Lucifer slowly pulled back his hood to reveal his wrinkled face. His eyes full of a crazed evil, he looked bloodthirsty. Dean dropped his hand away from his dagger, he wasn’t going to fight Lucifer. The king took a step forward towards the brothers and then leant in with a huge lunge. It was at that moment that a larger piece of rock collapsed off the side of where they were and tumbled, crashing on the ground below. All three of them looked to where it had happened and before they had time to realise what was happening, the ground where Lucifer had been stood gave way. Dean and Sam instantly jumped backwards away from the collapse, but Lucifer didn’t have time to react, he couldn’t with his worn bones. Lucifer was plunged down the mountain with the rest of the rubble never to be seen or heard of again.
Crowley didn’t feel like speaking, he didn’t want to reply and wished he could just disappear. He did not want to be at the brunt of Lucifer’s eruption, so he simply nodded in response. Lucifer began to mumble to himself pacing back and forth.
“Okay, what does everyone want? First round is on me!”
Dean stopped for a moment, unsure whether he should continue. These were feelings he'd held onto for so long and now it felt like they were just spilling out. He needed to admit them someone. Someone he trusted. Someone he felt could relate.
“I will use this formula to transform myself, to turn my charming looks so sour!”
“Well... not my real boyfriend...my fake one...because of you know what I said, I think it has travelled fast and... I don’t want Lisa to think I lied to her and now everyone probably thinks we are dating. So, please?”
“Here’s my ID,” Cas said holding out his fake credentials to the bouncer, “And here’s his. He left it in my car.”
“How did it end up being just you and the devil in that big scary Castle?” He asked and Castiel let out a heavy breath.
Lucifer grumbled under his breath, his words full of rage and spite, “My wretched step-brother.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Have you thought about my proposal we talked about a few weeks ago?” Lucifer asked, rubbing his hand against the nape of his neck.
“Thank you,” Castiel interjected, slowly pushing himself. He was slightly groggy and rubbed his forehead before bringing his arms back down beside himself. His hand brushed against Dean’s and both men blushed but instead of avoiding eye contact like usual, they turned to face each other.
Lucifer let out a loud laugh that seemed to echo off the walls of the castle for an age. Dean finally turned to face the king fully, awkwardly tapping his fingers against the table.
Crowley simply shook his head.
Dean was cut off by Charlie letting out a loud sigh, which he responded to sarcastically by raising both his hands up ‘in surrender’. Charlie playfully kicked him under the table, to which Dean lowered his hands. He then glanced back to over where Castiel was, a large crowd still gathered around him.
The rest of the birds fluttered their wings and began to cheerfully tweet in response. Castiel raised his eyebrows slightly, flashing a shy smile back at the birds. He loved nature, it made him happy and almost saw it as a home. He felt safe around the animals, like they were the only things he could talk too. He liked their company and they seemed to adore his. Castiel began to hum along to the tune of the bird’s songs. Creating a relaxing atmosphere. Losing sense of where he was. Losing sense of time.
The group went silent and instantly fixed their gazes upon Castiel once more. He stared straight back at them, his eyes peering out from just above the top of the blanket, as one of his only visible body parts.
When he got back from his run, he switched on his phone to find a plethora of texts from Dean and sighed.
“You can talk to me, you know? It's what friends are for.”
Dean awoke the next day with a pounding headache. He could feel the heavy rush of blood and groaned. He pulled the pillow over his head as though it would somehow stop  everything that was hurting. He had definitely drunk too much last night. After Cas had left, (because he had messed up) Dean hadn’t stopped drinking. Shots. Vodka. Whisky perhaps? Mixing drinks had to have been one of the worst ideas he’d ever had because now it felt like cement was being drilled inside his head. And yet, it hadn’t even been the worst idea he had had last night. That crown went to his stupid mouth telling Lisa that Cas was his boyfriend, all in a pitiful attempt to make her jealous- or at least he assumed it was that, the conversation itself was hazy.
“Right, now that’s out of the way...I’m going to go and make myself some breakfast,” Cas said, “And because I know you won’t have yet, you should make yourself something too. Best cure for a hangover is food.”
When it was time to leave, Sam and Eileen separated from each other instantly after getting up out of their seats. Clearly attempted to ignore each other's presence to move past the awkwardness from earlier. Cas noticed the sly glances that Eileen was sending Sam’s way when she thought no one was looking and how it was clear Sam was trying to look almost everywhere but where Eileen was. They’d been caught red handed. He was thankful he’d never been this open and easy to read with his thoughts and feelings, or at least he liked to think he was a much more closed off person. Cas was also kind of glad he had this fake relationship as a safety blanket so no one could try meddle with his love life. Cas looked up, drawn out of his thoughts when Charlie nudged him. He hadn’t realised he’d been staring at Dean almost the whole time.
Song: 'Hurts like Hell'-fleurie
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean knew where he was going, he’d only been here a few days ago. It’s not like he hadn’t dreamed of coming back, but he hadn’t imagined it like this. He’d dreamed of him and Castiel going up to the room hand in hand. Giggling over something stupid, something that made no sense and collapsing on the bed together. Maybe even on top of each other. Gazing deeply into each other's eyes and when it felt right, they’d lean forward and...
“Yeah, you two can go together and then you can all finally help me find a girlfriend to go with!” Charlie exclaimed, clapping her hands with excitement. Everyone laughed at Charlie’s statement. It was a known fact that Charlie desperately wanted a girlfriend but no matter how hard they tried to find her the right person, something always seemed to fall in the way. Dean recounted the time he’d tried to get Charlie with one of his own exes, Anna Milton, and he was sure it would’ve been a great match until Anna spent more time talking about Dean and an apparent hatred, she now had for him, than paying any attention to Charlie. So maybe Dean wasn't the best match maker and maybe he and Anna had not ended on good terms.
Love, Leah <3
Cas shook his head with a small smiled.
His hand was once again tightly gripping the handle of his dagger.
Cas’s rule was quite simple really and it was more to protect himself than anything to do with Dean.
They were all talking about him as though he wasn’t there, as though he couldn’t hear them. He raised his eyebrows, to see if he could catch their attention.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Could you...go now then?” Dean asked, his irritation apparent in his voice, “If you know everything that happens, you know I want to be left alone. To mourn.”
“What? I’m just saying...” Dean trailed off, shrugging. “Bite the bullet. It worked for me.”
Love Leah <3
Cas arched an eyebrow.
Sam had let Castiel sleep in his bed, as it meant he could then share with Eileen. This meant Castiel spent his nights lying across from Dean, occasionally staring at him when he struggled to doze off. It was almost pitch black at nights with only the slightest glimmer of moon light illuminating the room so Castiel couldn’t always clearly see Dean. But he knew he was there and could imagine his features. It helped him sleep knowing Dean was close, and if they weren’t in a room with six other people, he’d whisper to Dean and drift off having a conversation with the hunter. Castiel knew better than to imagine things like this, Dean was probably asleep. Castiel would try his best to banish the constant cycle of thoughts about his best friend, but they never stopped popping into his head. His eyes would stay fixed on the spot he knew Dean was, as he let out a small sigh. It was too dark for Castiel to knowing that Dean was staring right back.
Lucifer smirked, before placing a hand on a box that was in front of him, which Dean hadn’t noticed until now. The perfect unblemished box with the beautiful carvings on the side. Dean tilted his head in confusion.
“One day, when you’re king, everyone will be happy all the time and we’ll have parties every day, right?” Dean overheard the little girl ask Castiel, and chuckled to himself quietly. Castiel looked awkwardly to the floor and knotted his fingers together before glancing back at the girl.
“You’re late,” she bluntly stated, before lowering her voice, “And you left me alone with the two love birds, it’s making me jealous. I just want a girlfriend.”
“I need to find it...I need to find the spell,” Lucifer began to mumble on his breath. The candles flame flickered in the tense air and the silence was jarring. Lucifer skewered through multiple books, loose pages flying everywhere and the useless books tumbled to the ground with a loud thud. Eventually, however, he came across what he was looking for. His eureka moment. Lucifer smirked at Crowley once more.
His mind went back to Dean. Castiel was worried about Dean. If this plan of his didn’t play out perfectly, Dean would be in deep trouble. Castiel didn’t even know what Dean’s plan was and knowing the hunter it would either be incredibly stupid or genius. Castiel prayed for the latter. He pulled himself to a screeching halt when it suddenly dawned on him that he may have already seen Dean for the last time and he hadn’t even properly said goodbye. He hadn’t thanked Dean for being there for him. Hadn’t even thanked Dean for saving his life. Through gritted teeth Castiel decided it best he supressed this notion and pushed on.
“Suit yourself,” Lucifer replied, screwing the cork back in place, “Though you may need it after this conversation.”
Dean scoffed.
He quickly tried to change the topic of conversation, but his voice was quieter and croaky.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas almost dropped his phone.
I feel this chapter is more character building than plot building, but I hope you enjoy it!
The man jilted his head forward as though he was beckoning to Castiel to pick up the apple. The birds on the fence began to tweet, making sounds that Castiel hadn’t heard a bird make before.
It was then, that out of the bush rolled a fox cub. Castiel raised his eyebrows. And then another one followed, and another. Castiel slowly unclenched his hand and took a step towards them. The three cubs bundled together at Castiel’s sudden movement and were ready to back off at any given moment.
I think there is one chapter left ;)
“I’m so sorry...are we supposed to bow, Your Highness?” A girl with bright red hair asked. She started to tilt her body slightly, as though she was already prepared to courtesy.
Castiel blinked slowly in response, “Tomorrow maybe? He’ll be around the Castle visiting me and I can send him your way?”
"Don’t even get me started on my father...he was...just this horrible overbearing figure who wanted to control my life. He wasn’t a nice man. He was hunter too, you see, I guess it's a family business...I think it's the only thing I have in common with him," Dean bit the inside of his cheek, "I often felt like I had to protect myself and Sam from him... felt like I had to grow up faster than I should’ve so I could be the one to impress him and my brother was safe from his wrath. When me and Sammy finally got a way...when we found Bobby and the hunters...I don’t know, I feel like I finally found my real family. My place in the world, where I could just be me.”
“He’s going to be okay, isn’t he?” Castiel suddenly asked, quieter and much more timid than before. He still felt guilty about the predicament and had hoped Dean would be back by now to calm his nerves.
“How are you sure?”
Castiel was so wound up in his own thoughts however, that he had forgotten to fully pay attention to where he was going. Without realising he tripped over a tree root and was sent tumbling to the floor. This unfortunate incident sent Castiel’s heart racing, he had already been on edge as it was. He carefully pushed himself up, rubbing his elbows which were now cut and scraped.
“Dean’s told us a lot about you,” An older looking woman, with short hair stated.
Castiel and Dean occasionally caught each other's eye and though they both thought nothing of it, there was something clearly different in the air between them. Dean tried to stop himself looking every time but couldn't, he was drawn to him in ways he hadn't considered before.
“It is a bit,” Dean replied, a small grin on his face, “Plus, us being ‘together’ might push Eileen and Sam to go and get their act together.”
Dean rolled his eyes.
Crowley waited a moment before replying.
“There is no new answer,” Crowley reaffirmed, “Prince Castiel is the fairest in the land.”
Dean raised his eyebrows, half offended by Castiel’s comment.
“Didn’t realise you still spent all your time by this well,” Dean added with a chuckle.
Castiel slowly crept down the stairs, making sure they didn’t creak. He approached the small cottage window, trying to remain out of sight before carefully glancing out of it. He couldn’t see much other than the empty courtyard in front of the house and then the empty meadow that lay beyond it. few birds were sat on the fence and leaves were tumbling to the floor but Castiel couldn’t see anything out there capable of knocking on the door. He was about to head back to the bed when there was another knock at the door. This time it was quieter.
Cas rolled his eyes and shook his head at Dean’s confidence. Trying his best to not laugh.
Dean was so happy he could cry. He lifted his hand up and cupped Castiel’s cheek.
“No, it’s actually...fine you got me,” Dean said, “But we’ll cross that bridge when we get there, eh?”
But Dean was his best friend and something in his gut was telling him he should help.
Castiel didn’t know why he asked the animals, he knew they probably didn’t understand him and that they definitely wouldn’t be able to reply, but just talking to them made him feel happy again. It reminded him of his mornings at the Wishing Well, singing with the birds. Mornings he would probably never experience again.
He peered into the Cauldron, smoke cascading down the sides. There was a white glow from inside, lighting up his face. Lucifer pushed back his sleeve, revealing a rotting and wrinkled arm. Slowly he reached into the cauldron, pulling out an object that was dripping. He placed it in the palm of his hands and turned it over to examine it in all of its beauty.
There was also the small matter of telling the town their king was also dead, though Dean didn’t feel up to that right now and Lucifer did not deserve the mention. This moment of reflection was for Castiel.
“So, then...has my acting improved. Do you think I make a good fake boyfriend?” Cas asked, clearly teasing. Dean had a strange sensation in his chest that he couldn’t quite put his finger on. His heart pounding much faster than normal. He put it down to being touch starved, he hadn’t been that intimate and close with anyone for a while.
“I need a drink,” he uttered, bluntly. He wanted to look around see if any tavern was even open but he couldn’t tear his eyes away from Castiel. He looked so peaceful, surrounded by a bed of colourful flowers-the nature that he so dearly loved.
Once again, thanks for reading!
Dean didn’t reply.
Castiel gazed at the birds for a moment and then back at the apple which was now being pushed even closer towards him. The faintest of alarm bells were ringing in the back of Castiel’s head but for some reason he ignored them. For whatever reason he followed his heart instead of his head. He felt like taking the apple off the old man was the right thing to do, the politest way to go. Castiel reached forward and carefully picked it up. He could use it to make an apple pie, to thank the hunters for their hospitality. Dean liked pies; he could make is specially for him as a gift.
At this Lucifer pushed back in his chair, the legs screeching as they moved across the cold, stone floor. He stood up and was about to turn away when he paused in his tracks.
“True love defeats all evil, it seems.”
“I should get back to my shift,” she said, beginning to walk back to the counter. She moved past Cas and placed a supportive hand on his shoulder. “Sorry if my advice wasn’t helpful.”
“Sorry,” his brother said, sitting down beside him, “I’ve just been wanting to do that for so long.”
Sorry for not updating yesterday! I had a busy day and didn't have time to post. I've also started the second fic of this series, which is going to be a tangled au and I'll hopefully start posting it once I've finished uploading all of this fic.
Lucifer started to turn red, Crowley couldn’t tell at first if it was through embarrassment or anger when suddenly Lucifer’s eyes opened wide, a clear fit of rage crossing his face. He slammed close the lid of the box, shoving it back down on the table. Fists clenched he stepped closer to the mirror; his anger now extremely visible.
“That was quite filling,” he announced, wiping his mouth with a napkin. Taking a moment to consider his next words, “Though dear Castiel, how many times are you going to ignore the ingredients I ask you to get?”
Castiel began to hum a tune as he lost himself in his thoughts. It echoed in the well and caused the water to ripple. He was so withdrawn from reality that he didn’t noticed Dean come up beside him. Dean leant against the well, next to Castiel and smiled. He let Castiel continue his little song for a while before placing a gentle hand on Castiel's shoulder to catch his attention.
Cas hung up.
It took Gabriel mere seconds to reply.
Cas replied, rolling his eyes at Dean’s initial comment. Trying not to smile at Dean's ridiculous statement because he was still mad at him. However he'd never tell him to fuck off even as a joke, Dean meant too much to him.
“Doesn’t shut up about you,” A young man, who was taller than the rest of the hunters, added with a laugh. The man’s shaggy brown hair shook as he laughed, catching Castiel’s attention. He looked familiar, but Castiel didn’t know why.
Cas shook his head and pulled back the cover once more. He realised, through his weariness, that these people were not out to get him. It was more likely that they were the fellow hunters that Dean resided with. The ones who the messy beds belonged. Suddenly everything was at ease once more. His tense shoulders gave way as a surging feeling of relaxation made it's way through his body.
The room was quiet and the silence was starting to make Castiel feel uncomfortable. This was often the case. All that could be heard was the clink of his own spoon against the side of his bowl as he scooped out the soup. At the other end of the table Lucifer was less polite and mindful of his manners, instead he was drinking the meal straight from the bowl, slurping as loudly as he could. When he finished, he dropped his bowl back down to the table with a loud clash and burped.
“I have to get rid of him,” he muttered under his breath, just loud enough for Crowley to hear. He was slowly rubbing his finger against his chin as he battled with countless ideas in his head.
Cas instantly noticed Charlie due to her vibrant hair and wandered over to her, expecting her to be with the girl she was with earlier. Instead, he found her alone, cradling a shot glass in her hand.
Lucifer spun around and cast his gaze upon his cauldron. He hastily placed the spell book beside it and began to look around his room for ingredients. He had countless shelves full of potions and remedies, surely, he’d be able to unearth what he needed. He began to chant quietly as he moved around, preparing his spell as he started to find things to place inside.
“Hey there.”
“It’s here somewhere,” Dean uttered, just loud enough to be heard, though even now he was losing hope of it being in his pocket.
“No, no, no...” he began to utter, looking up to the sky, “I-I... love him, he’s supposed to wake up!”
Lucifer arched an eyebrow and flickered his gaze between the two men in front of him. Dean clenched a fist and was ready to open his mouth to tell Lucifer no, when Castiel spoke first.
Castiel examined the fruit. It was larger than most apples he’d seen before and had a shine to it that made it glimmer in the sun. Castiel noticed that it was the only red apple from the basket which contained a sea full of green ones. The old man had picked up on Castiel wandering eye as well.
Cas shuffled awkwardly on his feet, and rubbed his spare hand on the back of his neck, “He’s at the bar with Lisa.”
Dean turned to Sam; his eyebrows raised slightly. The blush now visible and impossible to hide as much as Dean wished he could.
“You’d make a good King,” Dean stated, and just like he had whilst talking to the girl, Castiel bashfully glanced away.
“I though because of Lisa...” Charlie seemed like she had more she wanted to say but stopped herself, “You know what, never mind. Right. Operation lovebirds is a go and then, if this works maybe I can try be your wing man.”
Dean scoffed. Surely, this man was speaking bullshit now. Maybe Dean was losing his mind and hallucinating all this. He pinched himself, but it was real and now his arm hurt.
Charlie sounded confused, like she didn’t trust what Dean was saying. Didn’t want to hope, didn’t want to believe. But she grabbed the door without hesitation too and pulled. It took a few minutes but finally it opened. The cold chill from the night entering the warm hallway.
“She was straight,” Charlie sighed, her words slightly slurred, “Why are they always straight?”
“Prince Castiel is not dead,” Crowley said, his voice low, “Through the woods and in a clearing, there stands the hunters house. Prince Castiel dwells there.”
“Unfortunately, I cannot reveal all my secrets, though it does involve us all going out for a meal at Benny’s tomorrow...so I’m just checking you can come?”
“I should...” Dean coughed to cleared his throat, “I should go talk to Sammy. Show him that I’m fine.”
Dean let out a loud grunt at his drunken self's actions before typing out another message to Cas.
Crowley rolled his eyes, his face now less visible through the mirror, as though a shadow had been cast over him. Lucifer stepped away for a second, leaning towards a table which was situated in the middle of the room. It was messy and covered in a clutter of books, weapons and a large black cauldron. Next to the cauldron was a bruised green apple which Lucifer carefully picked up and dusted off before taking a bite.
“I’d ask you a question but I feel like I know everything about you already,” Sam stated, chuckling to himself, snapping Castiel out of his trance.
Dean raised an eyebrow, drumming his finger on the table.
“I need you to kill Castiel,” Lucifer stated, “And so I know you’ve done it, I want you to bring me his heart. Inside this box.”
He let out a nervous laugh, to try and negate the tension in the room. He wondered if Dean had the same fears and anxieties about the situation that he did. He wondered if it was going to keep Dean up at night too. Dean could see how tense Castiel was about everything and felt it was his responsibility to tell him that everything would be okay. To be there for him. To protect him.
“Thanks, Cas. You know, I could help you too- everyone knows that most iconic lesbian and gay alliance is right here,” she exclaimed, waving her finger between the two of them. Cas let a small smile fall to his lips, but before he had a chance to respond Charlie began to speak again.
But that was just a dream. The reality was Castiel was dead and Dean was going to hide himself away in the only place he could still be close to him. The only place he could still smell him and feel like he was there. Dean pushed open the door, ready to instantly throw himself on Castiel’s bed when he stopped in his tracks. There was someone stood by the window. A silhouetted figure who had their back turned to Dean. The figure was small and hunched over and Dean wondered if Lucifer had somehow survived his fall. Dean immediately reached to his holster before realising his dagger was no longer there.
“It’ll work, I’m sure of it,” Dean continued, slowly pulling the dagger out of his holster, “It has too.”
"Winchester, what the hell are you talking about?" The vampire laughed again.
"If you tell me what happened, I will let you go free. Trust me." Dean said. Sam was confused as to why was Dean negotiating with a vampire? Maybe love makes us do things we've never actually thought about.
"What's with the sudden meeting with the phoenix Castiel." Balthazar asked him.
"Where Cas? Has he come back?" Dean asked dreading the answer. He didn't even remember that he hit the mirror and had fainted due to something.
They both plopped down on their respective beds watching the ceiling when they heard a knock. Cas looked to Dean, who recognised the smell as Lisa. Dean made a mental note to break up with her as soon as possible, as it would be safe for him as well as her.
Somehow he didn't trust them. He felt like he couldn't trust anyone except Cas.
She saw that the teacher hadn't arrived yet so she turned to Dean.
Lisa chuckled. "Not as a friend, dumbass."
"Hey, what's up?" He asked still looking at Dean who was paying no attention to him.
"Yeah, that's what he gets for making you think like I would leave you." Castiel as he pecked Dean on his lips. "I love you my angel." Dean whispered against his lips. "I love you too my one and only human." Castiel kissed Dean again and laughed for a while one hour before they had to get back to work as Sam had found a new case. Sam wore a beanie, hiding his pink hair for the rest of the month until he apologized and Castiel turned it back to its original colour.
⭐PLEASE READ⭐
"Don't ever leave me, understand?"
"It'll be alright Cas. I'm with you now, in the future and forever. Everything will get better I promise." Dean promised and something filled the air like magic. The both were busy drowning in the comfort of the other they didn't notice it happening and suddenly they heard a gasp. It sounded like a girls'.
Claire looked like she was expecting this. And she was the first one to speak.
"This is blood, Dean." She said and saw how Dean's eyes turned from green to light red. She understood and extended her hand which held the glass. Dean stood up, his legs had some serious strength. He grabbed the glass and drank it, some drops rolling down from the corner of his lips.
"Sure, Ca-Steve. I'll meet you there." Sam says and exits the shop still shocked to see their Cas there.
Everyone took out their weapons and pointed at him.
"You're a werewolf?" Dean asked, she nodded her head.
"What's Clarie doing here?" Dean asked trying to be social.
"Hey, Sam. It's not you're fault okay. You were just helping me and.....Dean. Don't blame yourself. Dean wouldn't want that." Castiel says as soothingly possible at that time.
"No. I'm better. Thank you for sending her away." Dean thanked for the gesture.
"You! What are you doing here?"
"You guys going somewhere?" Asked Dean out of curiosity.
Hello, hope y'all are doing good. 💜
"Are you okay?." Dean whispered.
"Um...I've never heard of them?"
"Oh, that's nice. A vampire huh?" Dean just nodded.
"He poked me. And he's running away." Cas told her before looking at ways to catch Dean.
"Sam right?" Cas asked chewing the food. Dean nodded and smiled. He didn't want to ask how Cas knew cause truly he was popular in his school and that why he was dating a girl. To be more precise, he was dating her to hide his sexuality.
Cas got a message from Meg after the class, it was shocking.
"Yeah I wanted to ask you. When I got you the showergel, this fell off from that pocket so I took a look." Dean said.
"I don't believe you. Get away from the door. I know he's in there. Dean!" Lisa yelled.
"Charlie. He told me Dean would never love a nerd like me. He told me that Dean will leave me. I know he loves me but these words….I just can't get it out of my head. It keeps repeating."
"Haha, it's okay Sam. I have nothing to do today. You're lucky I guess." Castiel/Steve chuckled.
"Yeah, we're sorry, Jody. we had stopped hunting. We're just helping out a friend." Sam said. Dean was lost in thought. To Dean these were the ones who he hadn't lost, he still had someone but it was different.
"It all happened so suddenly, I didn't have time to react, and I....." Castiel didn't know how to say to Dean that he had met someone else.
The couple had to go out for a while and the brothers agreed to look after the babies.
He saw Cas sitting there. He smiled.
Lisa was grateful that Dean and Cas didn't do anything which made her uncomfortable. But the sight before her was just of adoration. The way Dean had closed his eyes peacefully while he rested his head on Cas' shoulder, hands wrapped around Cas' waist. She liked the couple. She was glad Cas made Dean happy.
"You left Lisa. She was so heartbroken. And what's the guarantee that you'll not leave Cas. I care about him." Justin spat at him.
It was midnight and he heard Dean praying again, did he pray to Cas the day before too? Sam smiled knowing Castiel would have heard him, tomorrow was gonna be a special day for Dean.
Dean hit one last time and Justin passed out. Dean sighed. He had to get back to Cas.
"I'll go in first," Castiel suggested. Dean shook his head.
"We can share him Dean." Justin laughed, not afraid of the scary figure of Dean. If the room was not dark, Justin would've seen the real form of vampire Dean.
"Shh, it's gonna be okay. I'm never leaving you."
"We'll see you after classes?" Castiel asked. Charlie looked to Dean and smiled at Cas.
------------
"And I'm glad I have a healing boyfriend."
"He believed me enough to come here with me. I'm pretty sure you told him yourself." Cas said motioning to the car.
"Like the witch?" Castiel asked. Charlie laughed.
"We'll see you in the morning?" Jody says.
"Better now that you're here." Cas whispered back.
"He's not going anywhere with you. Can't you get the hint? Go away." Dean was getting angry, Castiel understood. If Dean gets more angry, his eyes may turn red and his fangs may come out.
"Yup and this my little angel."
"Sammy....."
"My family is strict. So I'm not used to eat or drink outside our house." Cas said and took a sip. It was surprisingly good.
Ethan was a good person. He was crazy about football and was a coffee addict like Lisa. So they were a perfect match.
"Promise."
"Justin asked me to go out with him for a coffee." Castiel shrugged. He wanted Dean to stop him from going. He didn't like Justin, he had only eyes for Dean and only him.
Dean turned to Cas who was unconscious. Dean's eyes softened and his fangs disappeared.
"D..Dean. I'm I-I am feeling so ho-hot." Cas said as he tried to tear off the shirt.
"Yup, he's my room mate." Dean said. Charlie gave a knowing smile.
"I'm sorry. It must be painful." Dean said. Cas nodded.
"Why did you poison Dean?" He asked growling.
"Why? Cause you're an old man?" Cas laughed .
"Yes. Who's this?"
"I'm not done yet." Castiel said and Dean sat up, interested in listening.
"Look here. Don't you go near my son. Or el-"
"I'm sorry."
"Castiel. Cas. This....this is really you?" Dean asked and he hears the beautiful laugh of his angel..." yes it's me." Castiel replied. Dean hugged him.
"Sammy.....where are we?" Dean asked.
"Done."
"He should've been back by now." Dean said just as the door closed. Sam chuckled.
They sat outside, on the bench. Cas was still crying. Dean didn't understand what happened. That's when he smelled a different smell on Cas. Justin. That bitch. Dean calmed himself for his boyfriend. His angel needed him now. He couldn't get angry.
"It's just when we kissed..." Castiel blushed which made Dean smile. "I felt a tingling sensation where the symbol is and...."
"I get to teach you all human things now."
"I've changed my number and you don't have it."
Dean saw Cas open his eyes, and was panting.
"I'll just take coffee. Others just taste like molecules." Sam looked up at Cas/Steve when he said that. That was almost the same thing Cas had said when he got back his grace.
Now Cas' hands went to his pants indicating he wanted them off too. Dean's face went red. He'd never seen Cas without pants from the time they were dating.
He had an idea of where they would be and went there. He saw his boyfriend smiling happily and singing to some Chinese song.(he better not tell that in front of Cas. Lol)
Dean wiped Cas' tears.
"Let go of him, demon." Sam growled loading another Maxine of bullets and reloaded it.
"A vampire? It was obvious. You were having a drink which was so thick. No drink is like that and also you're shifting frequently as I walked in. So... Yeah." Cas nodded to himself and was proud that he got it right.
"Why are you back? Didn't you tell me you would never show your face?" Mary asked.
"Oh….I'm sorry." Dean tried his best puppy eyes he could give but he knew he couldn't do it.
"What's the meaning of this?" Dean asked.  "You want to know the truth? Well I can't tell you so I'm just gonna show it to you. Be ready. I'll call you."
"Thank you for everything you did today." Dean said.
"Are you deaf now?"
"Meg!!" He yelled as he reached the place where the demon was last seen or heard of.
"Can I speak to you? Like after your shift or something?" Sam asked desperately.
Dean knew that his boyfriend would take his sweet little time and decided to see what that paper was.
Sam left the room silently when the others were busy wishing Dean and making jokes about how old he was but still looked like a hunk.
"I don't think we should date anymore. You deserve someone who will love you like you want. And I believe I'm not the man." Dean says.
"Not in that way Cas. I mean more than friend kinda way." Sam sees understanding on Cas's face and smiles.
"Nothing, I'll tell you later." Dean smiled. Cas looked back to the board, listening to the class.
"Yes. I did." Dean answered. Cas took his hands back and buried them in his pockets and looked down at the grass.
"How could you!? To your own son!"  "He didn't listen to me when I said you were bad news. I just had to make him believe." Mary shrugged.
"You can. But once in a day you have to take blood as it's our natural intake. I know it might be difficult, but you'll get used to it." Dean nodded.
A few minutes of staying like that, Cas calmed down and pulled away, blushing.
"So his own mother is trying to hurt her own son just to get us out?" Meg nodded and shrugged.
"I'll send a pic of this to my dad, he knows a lot about these things, maybe he can help us understand what it means. And we should tell the girls too probably, Charlie might know I guess." Dean said and turned Cas to face him and kissed his lips once more before taking his mobile phone. Cas sat beside Dean and layed his head on his shoulder. Dean smiled and kissed him on the forehead. Castiel also took his phone. He thought he should put some input too.
"What's wrong?" Dean asked, his voice whispering.
"Don't force me into marriage after we get there."
"I asked Sam how it would alcohol taste and since there was nothing in the bunker we went out to the bar nearby." Castiel took a deep breath. Dean knew where this was going but braced himself for it. Dean gulped before he nodded at Castiel. "Well, I did not like it and we exited the bar. Then....um I saw him. He was so cute, adorable, and was fun to talk to, I just couldn't stop talking to him. Sam got furious and told me to ask you first but I might have brought him home." Castiel ended. Dean's heart clenched. Castiel didn't love him anymore. He wouldn't get those hugs nor the cuddles. He liked someone outside the bar and brought him home? Wait, here?
"Oh!" Sam chuckled. Cas titled his head to the side not understanding the reason behind Sam's laugh. "He'd kill me if he knew that I was the one who planned this." He said and looked down at this shoe, the smile slowly fading away.
"Okay fine...I won't." Castiel said and suddenly his smile dropped and looked away from Dean. Dean furrowed his brows. He turned Cas's face towards him. "Hey, look at me. Whatever it is, we'll figure it out okay." Dean says but Castiel shook his head and looked at Dean properly.
"Come on, spill it."
"They are new to business and made a mistake of calling us with their own cell phone." Meg shrugged.
After Dean helped him with his pants, Cas pulled Dean towards him and kissed him. Dean kissed him back.
"It's because of the werewolf thing. I was surprised too."
Cas was waiting for Dean, Charlie and Lisa in the cafeteria. Cas was happy that Lisa found another guy who loved her. Cas didn't remember his name. It was Ethan or something.
"I told you I wasn't interested."
"Happy Birthday, young man." Jody wished him and Dean laughed.
"The dream where a woman asks you to take care of me?" Dean nods.
"Cas....don't do this.....please."
Dean heard someone running and looked up to see Cas. He was running towards them. Cas was wearing a black leather jacket above a grey t-shirt and white pants. His hair messed up and damn if that didn't turn Dean on. Cas reached them panting for breath.
"Oh god. Why didn't you text Cas!?"
"Now I understand.
Dean jolted awake and Cas was not next to him, he panicked and sat up, he heard a voice from near the entrance. He made his way to where he heard the noise.
"What?"
"Aww...it's okay baby vampire."
"Yes?" Cas asked her.
"Alright."
"Hey Dean. You're alright?"
"Oh, oh. You don't remember me I can understand. Dean surely remembers me." Barked the man.
Cas smiled and pecked him on the lips.
"What? That was to happen someday." She answered smiling happily at the couple and at Jody which made Dean and Castiel blushed and Sam laughed.
"I want answers Cas! You broke every working thing in me when I woke up and you were gone! My mom told me you left me because you were done using me, for a second at that time, I believed but thinking about it, it just doesn't make sense."
Sam sits back down and opens his phone.
Dean hadn't answered yet. "What's worrying my baby vampire?" Cas asked. Dean looked at him and smiled.
Cas came out dressed like a spicy dish Dean wanted to take a bite of. Dean was staring at Cas and didn't realise the other boy was in front of him.
He reached out to her and made her sit.
Dean looked around. He saw no one so continued. Cas noticed this. "My mom and dad are both vampires. My brother studies in the same school I studied."
Dean struggled in place and the demon tightened his grip making Dean almost choke him and Dean let out a painful yell. And that's when things changed.
: You both come straight to our house. I think we have a lot to discuss.
His name was with a guy named
She knocked on the door and John opened the door.
"Answer me. Don't you owe me an explanation?"
"I've been taught of people like that exits. My parents told me it was necessary that I knew because of some prophecy or something. I don't know." Castiel said.
After the class, Charlie asked Dean whether he was gonna tell Cas. Dean nodded in the affirmative.
"S-Sam. I think I'm going mad. Where is he?" Dean asked voice slurred by the alcohol he was drinking. It was the fourth bottle and even though Sam hid them, Dean had somehow found them.
: Oh my god, you didn't.
"We missed you."
"Did you know how long it took me to tame it?" Cas asked, folding his arms across his chest and pouting.
"No. That's enough. I didn't know he'd react like this, I thought he'd get angry but..... I'm sorry Cas." Sam said. Cas could see he was truly sorry for what happened.
"I think so. I don't know much. But I think Cas might know seeing his knowledge he has of us."
Dean now concentrated on the smell and let the other smell come too, he managed to fliter them and found a smell, which you define as a wolf would have.
"Is that why you were acting weird in math class ?" Dean nodded.
The two got into some random conversation as to why there's always a creepy little hut in the woods.
"Um yeah? What?" He asked clearing his throat. Charlie had already gone. Only Lisa was still with them.
"Are you sure you were the one in relationship with Cas?"
"Where's the angel?" He asked angrily. The Vampire laughed.
"Why didn't you tell me you liked me?"
"You got it. Now go."
: guys!! Actually me and Cas have something to show you guys. We don't know what it means but maybe you could help?
"How do you know me?" Dean asked out of curiosity, sipping his drink.
"But you can't call me baby vampire!" Dean laughed.
"Uh Garth, you said you had them a few days back but they already look like 3 years old." Sam asked. Garth just laughed.
Dean knew about the mother of all. She was the creator of all monsters and she ruled them, still does. He wasn't scared of her but you know she was rumoured to be deadly and merciless.
They were finally done when Charlie came and sat beside Lisa.
Dean opened his eyes to see Sam smiling at the person in front of them. Dean looked to the other side....and Castiel stood there.
"I promise." Cas smiled as he ran to his class and Dean walked to his.
"Don't you wanna know who that is?" Dean asked and Cas shook his head.
"I'm scared Dean." Castiel confessed.
"Of course I love you and I'm never gonna leave you." Dean said as he tried to calm his crying baby.
"So tell me about yourself." Cas started a conversation as he poured ketchup to one of the sandwich.
"It's because of my dad. I'll probably came back." Cas sighed. "I'm here to thank you for taking care of Dean. And ask you to do that once more for me. Please."
"I hate her. She's troubling you so much. When I see her, I'm gonna have a good talk with her." Cas said, trying to cheer up the sad Dean.
Michael promised Cas that he would take him in if their father won't allow them back. Castiel was happy but he would miss his mom.
He told Charlie, who squealed and was jumping in happiness that Dean found his mate. True mate.
"Okay Dean. Take care." She pecked him on the lips and went out the door closing it behind. Castiel locked the door and came to Dean who sat on the bed panting.
"Yeah, what about him?"
"I didn't tell them that I was your mate. I told my mom that I have a boyfriend."
"Why not?"
"Thanks, Sam. You guys can stay at our place during the time. And I have a surprise for you both." Garth said excitedly. Sam chuckled.
Castiel healed Dean from the physical pain and injuries but Dean wasn't waking up, and his breathing was slowing down.
"It's okay Sam," Cas said and snapped his fingers and the bathroom was crystal clean without the shards of glass nor there was a sign of a mirror broken.
Dean and Cas pulled back and looked at the girls.
"I want to confess something else too." Cas said. Dean nodded patiently waiting for his boyfriend to tell him whatever.
"My brother, Cas," Sam says. Castiel squinted his eyes.
"Ju-Justin. H-He-"
Castiel placed his hand on Dean's thigh, trying to calm down his anger. Dean looked at him.
Jody and Clarie decided to stay back because the next day was Dean's birthday. Garth and Bess agreed to bake a cake and celebrate his birthday. Sam agreed to bring surprise gifts.
He peeped inside as the class hadn't ended but he didn't see Cas. Did Cas bunk?
I'm hoping you liked reading this, if so leave a kudos and let me know in the comments which are really appreciated from you guys!
Dean was dropped off by his parents and his brother at the entrance of the college. He smelled all kinds of smell but he caught one different smell, it was so comforting, intoxicating. Dean was attracted to it. But he refrained and controlled himself.
Dean growled. His mother shook her head. "If you go see him now, you'll want to drink his blood so for only today you need to try and control your blood thirst." His mother informed. Dean growled but nodded. He wouldn't want to hurt his brother.
"Happy Birthday Dean." Castiel wished him and even Sam laughed a bit along with Dean. The angel was still adorable sometimes.
"Let me just see him once. Please. And then I'll go. You won't ever see me again."
"You did this?" Dean aksed smiling lovingly at his boyfriend.
Ever since Dean had got the dream of the woman telling him to take care of Cas, he felt like someone was watching him. Everytime he turned to see who it was there was no one. Dean thought it might be Justin but he knew he wouldn't do anything to hurt Cas or he'd have to deal with Dean.
"We'll see. But for now we need to go."
"I know and I have your new number." Cas said.  "How?"  "I have my ways. I need to go now. I have to pick up Jack."
The creature gets to know from different ways. Smell, a kiss, behaviour, over attraction towards the person.
"Y'know you've bit me too so we're even." Dean said. Cas was confused .
"Aghh, I hate math!!" Dean chuckled.
"It's better that way. Just go along alright. See you later. Take care of him for me will you?" Castiel didn't wait for Lisa to reply; he just rushed out the exit and saw a black SUV standing and he knew who it was exactly.
Lisa's eyes starts tearing up.
"Hey Dean! How's college? Who's your room mate?" He wiggled his eyebrows. Dean laughed.
Castiel pulled back and rested their foreheads together.
"Looks like I have two dads now." She smiled and Jody looked at her surprised.
"Cas... You don't remember me?" Sam asked. Steve looked at Sam squinting his eyes.
Dean thought back to his and Cas' conversation on the terrace. Instant attraction after inheritance. That can't be. He really loved Cas and if he was not a creature and was a human, he would still break up with Lisa and be with Cas. He just couldn't imagine his world without Cas. Even Cas would love him the same. Wouldn't he?
"Then go ahead."
"Hey, Sam. Who are they?" It was Garth and Bess.
Dean pulled back from the hug and wiped the tears still rolling down his face.
"God knows." Cas leaned towards Dean and whispered  "Thank god you got your father's qualities." Dean turned to him only for their lips to touch. Cas moved away quickly. This was not the time.
The boys were at the cafeteria really early, enjoying breakfast after a long day.
"Dean....that mark belongs to the mother of all and whoever is related to her won't be someone's mate or soulmate. It's just not possible." Charlie revealed.
He turned around, there was no one. He sighed.
Girlfriend....he didn't feel like he loved her. Dean understood she was not his true mate. If he was human, he would have felt sad but now he just felt happy, like somehow deep down he knew she wasn't the one for him. He suddenly remembered the boy he used to look at when Lisa was not with him. The boy had blue orbs, a slight tan, his hair messier than anyone. He had a perfect built and always wore a trench coat. There was a girl who was around him always which got Dean jealous. He remembered feeling that before transformation but now it was stronger. He should've acted before he left school, he was now not even sure that the boy will be in the same college as him.
"Hey Dean!!" She gave a kiss on his cheek.
"Why Cas? Why are you doing this to him?"
"It's okay. You didn't know." Cas said and walked away leaving Dean standing there.
During the talks, Cas had zoned out. What if his father won't allow him back? Even his brothers, Nick and Michael told him that they two were Bisexual and Gay respectively which only fueled his anger.
What was this whisper? Is Cas in danger? He's not in his class. He saw the class again and he saw someone else not being there. Shit.
Cas really didn't want to disappoint his father so he burnt the midnight oil to cover all the topics he needed to know for his exams.
"Hey Charlie." He whispered.
The new found relationship between the two boys was going smoothly. They went on double dates with Lisa a couple of times.
"Thank you mother. For showing me this much love. And you too little brother." Dean said.
Jody sighed, giving up. "Anyways, why was there no call from you both? Were you guys hunting?" She asked
Cas/Steve nodded.
He sat down next to her with a considerable amount of space in between them.
"Hey how's he?"
"Hey it's okay. It's gonna be alright and I promise he's never gonna trouble you baby." Cas nodded.
"Oh.. I don't know. He's straight." Cas stated. Lisa nodded.
"Just helping Lisa solve math problems." Cas smiled his toothy smile. Charlie smiled at him.
"Wh-why are you...um.." Dean looked away. Dean heard Cas taking off the shirt completely.
"Yeah and he said some pretty hurtful words." Charlie added. This Dean did not know.
"He looks familiar but no. Does he know me too?" Castiel asks.
Dean turned to Lisa with Cas still on his lap. Cas started to help Lisa with math problems while Dean just listened to Cas talk and explain much better than the teacher.
He was panting now. Looked around and found no one and he recognized it as his bedroom. He didn't remember anything except for when he saw Cas sitting on the other man's lap, happy. He looked around frantically and eyes roaming to search Cas. He heard the door open and was hoping to see Cas but saw Sam entering with a glass of water.
"Oh....since when is this happening?"
"Thank you, guys. This means a lot to me." Dean thanked him.
The boy's went back to their dorm, and Charlie went to hers with a promise that she'd meet them at dinner.
"What?"
Suddenly the door opened to reveal Charlie and Lisa.
Dean entered the class. It was the first class where Cas wasn't there. He had gotten used to Cas being around him all the time. He was nervous. What if he gets the urge? Everytime he felt like that Cas was there to distract him but now? Dean took a few deep breaths and entered the class. The only left seat was next to a redhead girl. He saw her snap her head up when he entered. Dean wondered whether she knew.
: Hello boys, what're you doing texting us? Don't you have classes?
"What? You hear whispers?" Dean nodded for gazillionth time that day.
"It's going to be okay." Dean assured. Cas shook his head.
"I thought you... I thought it was human. I was so scared you son of a bitch." Dean yelled and hugged Castiel. Castiel chuckled a little and hugged Dean back.
They had a small case of a rogue vamp and they followed it to the barn.
"Why were you just standing there Dean? You scared me."
"Wh-what?" Mary and Sam who were standing behind her were shocked at the reveal.
Dean was about to answer when they heard somone call Dean.
"No....he didn't recognise the mark until you and my family."
"Sure baby. Whatever you want."
"Dean!!"
"I'm Dean, I'm 18 years old. I live with my parents and my little brother. I love pie." Dean chuckled and cas joined him.
"Good. And wipe your..." Cas said pointing his lips indicating Dean should wipe the remaining blood on his lips.
"So, what's going on with you Dean?" Lisa asked. Dean sighed.
Dean decided to take Cas on a date and give him the bracelet he purchased not so long ago.
"Look at me Dean." Cas said, making Dean look at him.
"Watch over Dean for me, I need to take care of some sons of bitches. And don't ever think of killing yourself." Castiel said with determination and as soon as Sam nodded and sat down beside Dean, he flew to where the demon who poisoned Dean.
"This is also my boyfriend's dorm, I can be wherever I want." Lisa spat as she hooked her hand with Dean's.
: Okay anyway I had no interest in classes today. Thanks for saving me and we're on our way.
Castiel always liked this. Getting Dean all frustrated cause he looked adorable.
"Dean!! Sam!!" And the brothers were crushed in a bear hug. Sam chuckled and Dean just smiled and patted his back, both of them hugging him back.
They packed all the weapons and clothes needed and headed for the road.
"Stop making a scene. I told you where he would be." Cas said as she growled stomped away towards the cafeteria.
"That's nice."
Dean put Cas on his bed.  He saw that Cas's shirt was slightly ripped. Dean checked for any marks but he couldn't find any. Thank chuck Cas wasn't hurt in any sexual way.
"Oh, here?"
"I love you too, little angel." He kissed Cas on the forehead.
"Mother, why are you bringing me wine?" Dean asked still growling slightly. His mother chuckled.
It was gonna be a long year.
"How fucking dare you?!?" Dean yelled as he kicked Justin. The boy spat out blood from his mouth.
"Yay!!!! Finally!!!" Charlie and Lisa were cheering for them in the background.
"Don't you have that boyfriend of yours to attend to?" Dean said and dared a glance at the angel. It was then that he realized that Castiel hadn't changed back to his original clothing, he was still looking sexy as he did a day before.
Cas nodded.
"The audacity to talk. Bitch you licked him with that filthy tongue. You disgusting shit. He told you he didn't like you then why, why did you hurt him?? I'm warning you. Stay away from him."
"I thought it might be Justin but now I've killed him. And I still feel the same."
"You asked for it. Now deal with it." Sam replied. He was never interested in that business in the first place.
"Did you seriously just use me? Did you not love me? Even for a second?" Dean's voice was getting louder and louder by minute. Cas was looking down. He felt guilty. Guilty for not fighting for their relationship. He noticed what Dean was saying. So this was what Mary had told him. He was using Dean? Hell no! He loved him more than his life. Still does.
"Alright. Just today." Castiel agreed.
"Dean….no one would dare take me away from a scary vampire like you." Cas joked not knowing his dream.
Dean leaned towards Cas and whispered "she's a werewolf." Cas smiles and looks up to Charlie. "Figures."
"Wassup?"
"Yes we did but I never agreed."
"He just went in Dean. He'll be okay." Sam said which relieved Dean a bit.
Cas decided he would tell Dean how he felt about him and if Dean says he didn't like him back he would try getting over him.
Day before their first year anniversary, Dean met with an accident due to the slippery roads on the first week of Christmas.
The students were told to introduce themselves and the teacher told them today would be a free class and they can have time to get to know each other.
Dean gulped. Why the hell did he even ask that?
He exited the washroom drying his hair. He saw Cas packing his bag for the day's classes. Dean had to do the same.
"I'm sorry. I'm not interested." Cas replied. Justin's face dropped.
"I know, are you completing yesterday's assignment?" Lisa nodded.
"Good night, baby vampire." Dean chuckled as sleep overtook them.
(See the end of the chapter for
"But you agreed."
"T-That means we...we can't be together?" Cas asked as he felt his eyes watering.
"You like him, don't you?" Lisa asked after a while watching Dean order the drinks. Cas sighed.
"S-Sam. H-he's gone. Wh-why?" He said. San didn't know what to say to Dean.
"John, he has true mate. His eyes colour was switching to red." She was happy. So happy. She didn't like the girl Dean was dating and she and John secretly hoped Dean would have a true mate and their prayers was answered.
"That night when we came back here and I wanted to freshen up, It glowed? Like your eye colour. It was magnificent." Cas said and looked down.
"What's funny?"
Dean follwed him outside the cafeteria and sat at the place under the huge tree. The both boys sat at the corners turned to each other with food in between them.
"In an hour or two." Sam replied and Dean nodded.
"Two?" Dean asked.
Time passed and neither of them had slept. Thinking of the future.
It was dinner time and they had to go on time to get proper food or they would get leftovers.
: okay.
Dean ignored Charlie and turned to Cas.
"Oh, So we reunite again." Castiel says and Sam just gets up and hugs him.
It was 5.30 pm when Bess had finished baking the cake with the help of Clarie. Garth had told one of his trusted werewolf friends to look after his sons as the change of Atmosphere of humans might delay their time in growth.
"Awesome." Dean smiled.
It was a pleasant morning, the family talked about various things during breakfast. Dean was asking questions back to back which made his father laugh. It was true though, all his senses were heightened.
after sex. He had never before felt like he had after their nights together.
He glanced back over to Cas as he slowed down, nearing a dirt road. Cas had immediately gone from easiness to tense with a frown, eyes downcast at his lap.
Cas only smiled as he helped Dean undo the buttons of his shirt. They continued in silence as he slid the shirt over Dean’s shoulders and off, letting it fall to the ground.
Shortly after their conversation, Dean slipped the stupid hat over his face and napped for a bit.
He knew he shouldn’t have told Dean about Hannah but he did anyway. He couldn’t keep it to himself anymore. There was desperation over the last several days to confide in someone, anyone, as to what was happening. Cas expected it to be Gabriel whenever he returned Cas’s phone calls—he didn’t expect it to be a man he had only met three times.
“That guy definitely loves his truck more than his wife,” Dean said, leaning close to Cas, pointing at a grumpy-looking man with a backward Confederate flag on it and a stained t-shirt. Cas smiled and glanced at Dean and instantly wished he didn’t. Dean had some sugar from the donut all over the lower part of his face and looked like an absolute mess. Cas’s first instinct was to just take Dean’s face in his hands and get the sugar off himself.
“That’s a question for the police, I’m just doing as I’m told. They’ll be back shortly,” the doctor said, looking down at a clipboard. “Dean’s going to be in pain for a while, even after discharge. His collarbone was shattered and we had to…”
Cas thanked him quickly and hung up before Joshua could say anything else.
Dean tapped nervously along to Little Drummer Boy and then to an instrumental piece of Aud Lang Syne; Cas hadn’t moved much as they drove, but Dean did smile when he saw his foot tap along here and there.
“Yes—it’s not that much but—“
Cas commended himself for not coming right then and there as teeth and lips gently worked the spot until Dean was satisfied. Summoning the energy, Cas shifted himself up onto his elbows to see it, but Dean covered it.
The clock in his head shifted into overdrive, adjusting now for the time he had left.
“How long are we going to do this?” he asked, voice quiet as the music paused for the next performer.
Cas couldn’t shake the image of Dean licking the sugar and kept giving him side glances. Every time he looked, he saw Dean’s cheeks flushed, and Cas was sure it wasn’t because of the heat.
“Oh,” was all Cas said as his mouth brushed Dean’s ear, causing Dean to shiver. He took a moment to gather himself, hands moving toward the button on Cas’s jeans.
Everything after blurred together into a pleasant moment of the otherwise mundane afternoon. When Michael eventually found him and shattered whatever good mood Cas had been in for a long while, anger once again flared in Cas. But he kept his mouth shut.
Dean nodded, resting his chin on his arms, “That’d be nice.”
Dean sighed and turned left, constantly checking his rearview mirror for headlights, but no one followed him.
He really stepped over the line if he hadn’t before. Not just crossed it but kicked it and punched it as well.
Jack first shook his head but then looked back down at the ring in concentration. He inhaled when it finally clicked.
“At the end of the day, I am an adult, and I can talk to whoever I want to,” Cas threatened.
But Cas kept his mouth shut and began walking down the sidewalk, slow at first so Dean could catch up beside him.
At almost 4 a.m., Cas got a call from Joshua.
“Inspiring nudist? We’re gonna have to move to a warmer town,” he said, a shiver breaking out all over, goosebump visible in the reflection.
They walked back and got into the car. Dean kept a reassuring hand on Cas’s knee, even as he tilted his head back and fell asleep almost immediately after Cas drove back onto the main road.
But Dean refused to feel bad for leaving. Every time he wanted to turn back and walk inside, his mind threw up the image of Cas’s face lighting up when he heard Dean’s intentions.
Over the course of his life, he had never encountered anyone with an unhappy home life. Lee’s parents loved each other, stayed in town; Benny’s parents divorced but got along fine and raised Benny in good fashion along with his niece; Cassie’s family got along, not all the time but never to the likes of which Dean and Cas had seen—
Canceling the date felt like a small way to tell Michael that Cas still had some amount of free will left.
“I should be finished after this,” Cas answered, placing the books in a duffel bag.
But if he stayed in Worthington he wouldn’t only just be ruining his life, but Hannah’s and Dean’s as well.
Rolling his eyes, Dean lifted his head, wishing his eyeballs really could throw daggers, “I have the right to remain silent.”
Neither had a guaranteed stable outcome.
“I told you the truth. It’s still in my car if you wanted to see,” Cas answered, keeping his tone light.
This time Dean had to break away, needing air. He didn’t move far, staying pressed against Cas, feeling him try to catch his breath as well.
“Merry Christmas,” Dean whispered against Cas’s mouth, smirking.
Instead, he reached over with his hand, searching for Cas’.
Cas did.
He sat there, back to the bar facing the dance floor with a smile on his face, waving his hand.
Dean, still sans clothing, stood there patting his face dry. But all the ease he had the night before, or in bed, or even walking into the bathroom all but dissipated as Cas noted the tension in Dean’s shoulders.
For a home rarely used, it was surprisingly clean. Cas had said he hadn’t needed to do much but the floors looked polished, shelves dusted, and everything appeared to have been preserved perfectly while the building had remained locked up.
Dean narrowed his eyes, suspicious, but at the same time, he also knew how much this Christmas had to mean to Cas. It was the first one really on his own. Last Christmas, Cas had moved into his apartment and didn’t have time for decorating, and just by him giving Dean snapshots of his upbringing, it sounded like Cas’s Christmas with his well-to-do family was more of a strained event than a merry one where no one decorated. They instead paid people to do it for them.
“You didn’t ruin my night”, Dean said, shaking his head, “That guy in leather was probably going to ruin my night.”
“Why is that scary?”
And that
It took Benny only a moment or two before Dean saw his face fall into an “oh” expression. Dean pressed on;
; seeing as well as feeling each pulse of fire that raced all over with every movement, every gasp, every whispered beg of a name—
He followed Dean, shook some hands, and smiled back at people, remembering to omit his last night. They smiled back with warmth and welcome and it actually caused Cas some sadness to think that he had never experienced this level of kindness or hospitality in his life.
“It was a 21st birthday present from Gabriel. It’s still in my car from the move so, I assume Michael thinks that’s a possibility as well.”
Dean asked himself. But he still decided to answer, going against that part of him that kept wanting to leave, reminding Dean that he was still in hostile waters.
There was silence for a moment, until Lucifer burst into hysterics.
“I had been trapped in King Lucifer’s Magic Mirror for years. I could see everything all around, had more power than I ever could imagine...but I wasn’t free...not until what happened today at the quarry,” he explained, “And I know you didn’t kill him. I know you’re not a killer, Dean. But you played a part in ending my curse and I can’t thank you enough.”
“Hello there, Dean,” he mused, rubbing his hands together slowly, “Did you see the nice surprise I left for you?”
“Crowley, you in there?” he cooed, knocking against the glass.
Dean shrunk back, biting his lips. He knew what Sam was insinuating, hell he knew what Sam was inferring was the truth. Castiel was his best friend; he was the prince who Dean felt he had a duty to protect and look after but it was so much more than that. Castiel made him laugh like no one else. He worried about Castiel’s life more than even his own sometimes. His heart would race anytime their fingers accidentally brushed or when they embraced, he wished they’d never let go. He didn’t need Sam to spell it out, but he was still too afraid to admit it because if Castiel didn’t feel the same way. Dean didn’t want to ruin their friendship.
“Sometimes...sometimes I wish I hadn’t known my parents,” Dean said, revealing something he’d secretly held onto for so long, “I had a pretty sorry excuse for a mother, she tried her best, I guess, but it got harder and harder for me to ignore the things she put us through as I grew up. Maybe if it was just me, Sammy and her it could've been different... but it wasn't so I'll never really know."
“Is that Castiel?” she asked, tilting her head in the same direction she had mere moments before. Dean turned around too, almost immediately, and let his eyes go to where Charlie had just been looking.
“No, it’s not just the hunt,” Dean stated “I just got this feeling, something’s not right.”
“About how it might be time for you to find someone? A princess perhaps to marry?” Lucifer pressed, “A true love?”
or an explanation. Cas rolled his eyes.
“So, what do you need to tell me?”
When he saw him again.
Cas pushed open the door to the small coffee shop which Anael, a family friend, owned. It was a snug building, and wasn’t overly busy. He’d come here immediately after hanging up his phone, ignoring the ping of texts from Dean. Cas had decided he needed some advice and Anael always seemed to tell him exactly what he needed to hear.
“Uh hello Charlie,” Cas said after answering the call.
Castiel ambled over to the bed and perched himself on the edge of the mattress. He carefully pulled off his boots, and placed them to the side before sliding his legs on top of the sheet. Then he reached forward and pulled the blanket over his body, wriggling downwards as he did so, snuggling up against it. He closed his eyes and started to drift off.
Cas placed a supportive hand on Charlie’s shoulder whilst she pouted.
Dean began to blush. In attempt to hide it he shrugged off Castiel’s comment like it wasn’t really a big deal. Like saving Castiel’s life and defying orders from the King was comparable to the time he retrieved ten-year-old Castiel’s blanket from a tree. Even though he had been the one to throw it up there. Accidentally.
He was yet to tell Crowley of the young Prince’s demise, and couldn’t wait to finally hear the words leave the man in the mirror’s mouth. That King Lucifer was finally the fairest in the land.
Song: 'Look After You'- The Fray
Well as free as he could be with his brother out there.
Once again thank you so much for reading and dropping kudos and commenting, it means so much to me!
Dean came to a screeching halt when he arrived at the large wooden Castle doors. They were closed and Dean realised as he pushed against them that they were also extremely heavy. Dean rattled at the handle, trying to pull them open, his impatience growing. Charlie and Sam pulled up behind him, but he didn’t really have time for questions or for them to lecture him as they most likely assumed that he was drunk.
True love was just a mere dream.
Song: 'Bones' by Josh Record
Dean darted out of the room, almost stumbling over his own feet. His ears were ringing and his breathing was unsteady, but he couldn’t focus on that. His thoughts were all centred on Castiel.
Song Rec: 'All I want'-Kodaline
“When do you think he’ll be coming to inform me about how him and his friends little hunt went? I like to know about these things seen as I am the one that sanctions them and helps provide them with the resources...”
Sam nodded, he understood. Dean wiped himself down, water dripping off his shirt. The rain was still heavy and the sky was getting darker by the minute. Sam pushed a handful of his wet hair out of his face and was about to ask Dean if he was ready to return home, when something suddenly caught Dean’s eye. Or someone.
Lucifer took another bite out of his apple, before slowly turning to face the mirror once more. His eyes focused on Crowley’s face, a clear build-up of rage within them.
“Talk later?” Castiel mouthed, slowly dropping his arm, appearing disappointed that their catch up session had ended so abruptly.
“Are you find with PDA?” Dean asked. Cas nodded in response without looking up, barely even taking in Dean’s words. “Well, all we have to do really is hold hands but if that’s okay in your ‘ground work’ or whatever then...”
The security guard looked more unimpressed with Dean as the seconds went by and when he was about to give up and walk away from the line, he felt a hand on his shoulder.
Dean raised an eyebrow, confused.
“So, true love, huh?”
“Here let me. It’s what boyfriends are for right?” He joked. Dean let him wipe it away and was in awe at how gentle Cas was being with him. Dean found himself leaning into Cas’s touch and was startled when he pulled his hand away. As Cas leant back, Dean sent him a thankful look and unintentionally traced the area above his lips with his finger.
Castiel blushed slightly, letting out a small chuckle as he began to stumble over his words.
“I’ve been expecting you, Dean,” the person said, slowly turning to face him. There was a loud crunching sound and Dean glanced at the person’s hand. Between their fingers were shards of broken glass which were clenched together before the man dropped them, letting the pieces shatter to the ground. Drops of blood stained both the glass and the fingers of this man.
“Thank you, Castiel.”
The day passed by quite quickly. Castiel spent his time inside the house, cleaning up and settling in. Charlie stuck to his side, he guessed it was her attempt to make him feel welcomed. She was nice and sweet but very talkative and he ended up learning more about her than he probably ever needed to know. Despite this, Castiel appreciated her efforts and company whilst he waited for Dean to finish whatever he was up to.
Dean slouched against the tall, brick castle wall and yawned. He’d stayed up most of the night trying to sort out every little detail of his plan whilst overcoming the shock of what Lucifer had even asked him to do in the first place. Dean’s whole body ached and he could barely even stand. His eyes were red, puffy and blood shot. As he patiently waited, he twiddled with the handle of his dagger which was peeking out of from his holster. He was unsure and nervous; he didn’t even know if he could pull this off. If it didn’t work, somehow, both him and Castiel would be in danger. He couldn’t risk it, risk their lives. Though he didn’t hold his own life in as high regard as he held Castiel’s.
The more Dean thought about it, the more Dean wondered just how far removed Castiel really was from the Charleston family.
“I’m sorry, but no,” Cas grimaced, throwing the bag over his shoulder. “But, I do think it’s a good idea if you left. Let’s everyone breathe a little.”
“—what do you think?”
“Y’did good,” Dean mumbled as he fought to stay awake. “Almost too good.”
The emotional rollercoaster continued to pull Cas around.
Caution flashed in Dean’s mind as he talked, warning him when he got to a self-identifying part of his life (school, job, family name).
and that was unhelpful.
“Yeah. And it just was—you know how it was. You probably went through it too. It’s a lot of confusion.”
a warning. Michael expected Dean to go after him.
Cas took a deep breath, ripping out another weed.
Cas, nerves building all Saturday morning, relaxed as he pulled into the driveway and saw Dean pulling bags of ice out of his trunk. The house on the south side of town, like all others around him,  was small in stature with one story, with some shingles out of place, and not a whole lot of square footage.
He stood out among the crowd as someone in plain dress while most had flashier outfits on, ready to party. Some wore makeup, some just had glitter, others weren't as flashy but still had more style than Cas with his jeans and button-down.
Cas frowned.
“You thought I was calling a priest to get married, weren’t you?” Cas asked.
“I got papers yesterday,” Dean mumbled, flicking a little bug out of the water. “They can’t force me out of here though, and if I have to live in the middle of a parking lot, then so be it.”
They wound up back at Glen Elder, full of people enjoying the sunny day. Cas stayed silent as Dean gathered together some fishing gear from the trunk of the car. What Cas often needed when he couldn’t shake the “bad” off was people. Sometimes he needed silence, and only Dean, but most of the time he needed to be around people to help settle himself. When Dean had asked, Cas only responded with “It’s a reminder”, and never elaborated, but Dean didn’t need him to.
And he wanted to go back to the club? Dean assumed Cas hated the place after the other night.
They didn’t speak for the duration of preparing the food, and Dean hoped and begged with everything he had that the heat building in his face was from the coals and not due to the warring narratives inside his head.
“We can’t afford that,” Dean pointed out, but still walking over to take up the sleeve again.
surface until Cas developed confidence. In that case, it’d be a race between them, but one where each one tried to go as slow as possible. Dean couldn’t stop thinking about how long they danced around each other already. He didn’t want time to get away from them again.
Cas pushed through the gate and saw Dean hanging onto the edge, legs kicked out behind him with a lazy smile on his face. Walking over to the lawn chairs, Cas glanced at Dean again, pausing as he went to undo the top button of his shirt, “Are you expecting a show?”
Maine welcomed them with open arms.
“It’s okay—it’s going to be part of my life, so I guess I have to get used to talking about it like it already is.”
Cas lifted his head and shot Dean a half-hearted glare. Dean had enough decency to look somewhat contrite.
Cas peeked through squinted eyes at Dean and laughed when he saw Dean’s face. Five minutes he’s been home and already Dean felt the familiar thrum of frenetic energy building in him. Under the bubbles, he moved his hand to feel himself already hard despite having only a few words and minimal contact with Cas.
hot, and he’d stay there for maybe an hour before calling it quits for the night and declaring it a failed experiment.
Dean didn’t know when it happened, how it happened, and didn’t care in that moment how fast it happened—he really did like Cas and very much needed something more to happen.
“How come you never told me?”
Cas left instructions for Joshua to call Cas if Dean showed up. But, if Cas’s suspicions were correct, then Dean wouldn’t be showing up there any time soon. His anger pushed Cas to head back into town, no longer looking for Dean.
Michael rolled his eyes and slammed his laptop shut, “I get that you don’t understand how things work around here, but I told you that we stay away from him, and his friends, and his brother if he ever decides to show his face again—“
“Is she in on it?”
The first time he’s fallen in love and it ends in heartbreak two days later. Cas wondered if that was a world record.
That was the most frustrating thing. They went somewhere, but you can’t follow them.
Trying not to let guilt overrun him, Cas took his phone and typed down in his notes app both Benny and Lee’s name with a reminder.
Cas said nothing but nodded as Dean parked the truck.
It didn’t take much thought to connect the fact that Zachariah had wanted to build on the south side of town, where land was already being sought out by someone like Michael, so he didn’t have to go through an extensive process to get it all up and running.
Reassurance.
Benny finished his last drink, wishing it numbed him up just a little more, still trying to shake the adrenaline of earlier off. He still couldn’t believe he shoved Michael into a table and knew there would most likely be repercussions. Benny expected cops to show up at his house tomorrow morning, ready to arrest him for assault.
Cas nodded, not knowing who the person was but giving them a wan smile, “Thank you, I’ll go find him.”
Dean and Cas decided to stay at the bar closer to the door that night. They didn’t need to talk about it, they just knew why.
Cas submerged himself completely and ducked his head underwater to get his entire body used to the temperature faster. When he rose, he saw Dean had grabbed the two foam noodles leaning against the side of the pool. They both moved onto them, staying silent for a minute.
But after the third, Dean could feel the ache in his shoulders and legs as he kept climbing up and down the ladder.
Cas blinked himself back to the present and cleared his throat.
Cas’s mind shifted to the intended discussion with everyone else later that morning. If Sam already saw it, it was most likely others did too but just didn’t want to say anything until Cas and Dean did. They wouldn’t ask the same questions as Jack, which eased Cas’s nerves, but he still felt that he didn’t have all the answers
But someone, somewhere, was watching him.
Cas, who already didn’t want to be at the party, suddenly wanted to bust through the window, just to get out of there. Dean sending the photo and video not only brought back reminders of their night, but physical sensations like feeling him move under Cas, or whatever noise he tried to keep to himself, ultimately failing.
Dean felt cool hands slide under his t-shirt and rest on his waist, triggering a wave of goosebumps. He gasped and Cas let out a soft laugh, almost like the one from the other night.
“Cas?”
Still without answering Dean, Cas moved to yet another rack, pulling off two more jackets. Dean frowned before he saw where Cas was slowly heading.
Dean smiled and decided not to yell at Benny and Lee after all.
12:22 p.m.
But the fire crashed over him again and the question couldn’t finish itself, its voice fizzling out completely.
Cas glanced down at his hand again, then over to Dean’s, unable to look away from the rings that were so small but that symbolized so much they wanted to say to the world.
“You don’t look—
Cas didn’t move but Dean felt the weight of his stare as he slid the plain black jacket on, the satin inside the sleeves cool against his skin. He turned to the mirror, but instead of looking at himself, he kept the smirk on his face as he watched Cas' face, eyes growing a little darker, not meeting Dean’s gaze but raking up and down whatever skin remained exposed.
“O-okay. See you then,” Dean said, still trying to play catch up.
Cas winced as he prepared himself, more sensitive than he thought. They probably wouldn't last very long—or maybe just him.
“You found the jacket first,” Cas said, shrugging.
Dean needed someone else.
“That was ages ago,” Dean mumbled, staring at Cas’s mouth as he pulled away, “Can’t hold me to that.”
Anticipation fueled him, both of them, eager to learn how to break down the rest of the walls, and to keep moving forward.
Despite Cas’s nest egg, they both had decided that it didn’t mean they shouldn’t still get jobs, even though the cost of living was substantially cheaper in Victory.
Michael shook his head, “She told me yesterday she wanted nothing to do with her aunt and uncle, which, I can’t blame her at this point. No—she is heading to… somewhere on the west coast, can’t remember, to try and get into a business school up there,” Michael huffed, then sighed in defeat. “I guess everyone is trying to get out of Dodge.”
“Not much. It’s so hot here, even going to the beach is like, whatever.”
“Did I put it low enough that time?” Dean grinned, looking down. They couldn’t see it through the water, but the first thing Cas did when he woke up Friday looked at it in the morning light. It looked even better in the mirror.
At one point, Dean kept saying Cas’s name and half the time Cas didn’t think Dean knew he was doing it. Nails dug into Cas’s side and the heat of the room, their space, their own world blew out of control.
Still breathless, Dean typed back it was no problem. He misjudged where his thumb went and accidentally scrolled up, displaying extra photos he didn’t remember sending Cas.
But they walked down the hall anyway and opened the door to a lively Christmas. Garth’s children sitting on the couch, dutifully watching The Grinch while Claire sat next to them, occasionally pointing at the screen explaining what was going on. Jack, Kaia, and Patience sat in concentration on the floor nearby as a Scattergories ticker wound down; Alex and Sam sat apart from each other, engrossed in some kind of conversation which, based on past experiences, probably had something to do with the latest crime documentary on Netflix; Eileen, Garth, Donna, Jody, and Bess all sat at a fold out table, their card game abandoned for some amusing story that occasionally had one or two of them laugh loudly over the TV.
But now as they passed by it in the dark, Dean couldn’t help but keep his eyes on it, glancing at it through his own window.
“I didn’t want to do it without you,” Cas answered quietly, laying some silvery tinsel on the branches, securing themselves in the needles, “It seemed special.”
He always had a skill of keeping cool under pressure and even if he was angry, he would express it in a way that didn’t further escalate the problem.
and was rewarded with Dean coming shortly thereafter with a shout, tensing all around him, holding him close in every way possible and not letting go as they rode the wave out together.
Despite the surge of adrenaline from earlier, when Dean had gotten back into his car, he realized that he would be leaving
’s lined up.
Cas rested his forehead against the back of Dean’s shoulder. When Dean looked back to the mirror, he saw Cas had tilted his head a little to stare back, looking utterly gone—dark eyes, flushed face, biting his bottom lip hard to try to stay quiet. Dean could hear every hitched inhale and struggle to keep any noise inside. On one exhale, it almost sounded like Dean’s name—
Michael didn’t look all that messed up, nothing in comparison to Benny, but he was already forming a bruise on his jaw and his nose looked swollen and blooden.
“When—?”
notice last night, but I had planned on telling you regardless.”
They both wanted each other—even needed each other—but was that enough for a stable future?
“What?” Cas asked as Dean watched him undo his button and fly.
“Do you love him?”
The place felt overgrown, even at night. Dean couldn’t see the moonlight through the thick trees that canopied the main road. There were cabins here and there, all dark, all quiet. He wondered if his car would make enough noise to wake someone up, peer out their window, and see a black car driving slow with its high beams on. That’d definitely get the cops called on him.
Some people were mistaken, thinking he had gone off on missionary work. He’d have to kindly explain to them every time that he was not an evangelist and had only been in Illinois the whole time. It happened three or four times, leading Cas to wonder what Michael was actually telling these people.
“I’ll name that one—”
It was still a very sore sport.
. The trust that he’d keep it together dissolved with Cas’s question.
Dean frowned, processing Cas’s words.
“He didn’t shoot himself,” Cas mumbled to himself.
After the basement was said and done, Dean took a second stairwell up that put him back in the dining room.
Dean smiled and angled his hips a little, “It’s just a finger right now—I hope I can at least take that otherwise we may have some problems.”
“That’s the other problem,” Cas cut Joshua off and tossed some smaller weeds into his bucket. “I had tried talking to him yesterday about a few things, including the—you know—future, and it didn’t go so well.”
“I can sort you out with at least one of those problems, let me call some places for your car,” Dean said. He didn’t know what to say about Lee’s job. He hated Lee’s job. “And I’m not changing my mind about leaving, I’m sorry.”
Both families had farms; both families sent word back to other friends and family; both had helped in growing the area’s population.
“He’s my brother.”
But the phone laid on the bed, beckoning him, and gently asking Cas to forget about church for now. He could go this Sunday; it was a problem for a different day.
much it was never an option.
Cas unwrapped the third box finally coming to the tiny one, also wrapped. He huffed in frustration but pulled on the bow and gently peeled away the tape from the paper.
“What the hell was he gonna do if you went through with your plans to be a monk or something?”
Cas had Dean trapped. Heart racing, trying to claw its way out of Dean’s chest, he automatically reached into his coat pocket and retrieved his own little black ring box, the one that had sat patiently in the corner of the library for nearly three months at that point.
A better idea came to mind.
Cas almost dropped the book in his hand, now looking back over at Michael stared at him, dejected and defeated.
Ice cold dread immediately flooded Dean from head to toe. He’s heard this before.
“I hope so.”
With a boldness neither of them initially had in the hotel, Dean didn’t hesitate in removing all his clothing. He didn’t look at Cas as he made a show out of folding them and tucking them into the side of the truck bed. He hoisted himself up into the cab and kicked off his shoes and watched them fall into the dirt. Eventually, Dean sat cross-legged on the makeshift bed, smiling, waiting for Cas.
“Shh,” Cas chastised, but Dean didn’t have to open his eyes to see the smile. He knew they were both close, just by Cas' stuttered breathing, faltering rhythm—
“Are you telling me I could have left all this time and not worry about the financial repercussions? I thought this wouldn’t last me a month.”
Eventually, to get off the subject of his family, Dean settled on telling stories of monstrous customers down at the auto shop, failing to acknowledge it was the shop at the edge of town.
The absurdity of the image reflected back at Dean drew a soft laugh from deep down—
“I think a light,
Looking back at their reflection, Cas had at some point crossed his threshold of maintaining his resolve. The flush on his face betrayed any sense of restraint he attempted, and the intense stare morphed into something almost pleading.
Swallowing hard, Dean reached for the homemade sauce and drizzled it on to make himself look busy. The last thing he needed was for this guy to think Dean was some creepy dude who only invited him to a cookout to—
Cas couldn’t continue.
“He left earlier,” Lee said, voice quiet. Benny struggled to stay awake, trying to take in as much of the conversation he could.
“She’s leaving in three days to look at apartments and I don’t know when she’ll be back,” Dean cut Benny off, pocketing his phone, trying to swallow his nerves. She wasn’t unkind, but she had a sharp tongue on her that Dean found hot most of the time, but now it terrified him.
“And how long is that supposed to be again?”
Reynolds, standing outside, was red and sweaty in the face as he breathed hard, peering into the engine of a large and old red tractor.
Dean only existed in the town. He didn’t live there. Every day he’d float through town like a ghost that just couldn’t let go. No one cared about him, no one asked him how his day went, no one sat around bonfires with him and just talked with him.
“Shower sex isn’t worth it,” Dean said as if he could read Cas’s mind. Cas frowned, forgetting there were still some things not foreign to Dean when it came to sex. Still, Cas wished he could try it just to say he did.
Dean thought back to Friday night, thought back to the text messages, to the bonfire, to their first meeting—every laugh, every smile, every nervous confession, every hesitant glance at each other—
But Dean was jealous, would probably always be jealous. He felt a sharp tug in his chest whenever Charlie talked about Stevie, one of the tour guides at Dino-Park two towns north in Pascona. Charlie knew who she was.
Cas, laid there for a couple more minutes, trying to anticipate questions Jack would have, if there would be any. He knew his nerves didn’t stem from Jack’s potential reaction to the news, but Jack had a tendency to ask the types of questions that caused Cas to sometimes think a little too deeply.
“I can’t do everything but I can do some things,” Cas countered.
“It’s alright,” Cas said. “Michael shouldn’t have done that.”
He tried one more time.
Until a few hours later when most everyone was in bed and Dean headed back to his room after brushing his teeth.
“You had that ‘want’ before,” Dean continued, “You had already bought a ring once. You saw yourself there at the end of an aisle with friends and maybe family there. To me, it seemed easy for you to snap back into it once you found someone again. I was never there, Sammy. And that’s what I told Cas tonight as well. This—” Dean gestured around him, “—wasn’t ever in the card and we eventually learned just
But here they were.
I couldn’t stop looking.
“I’m giving you fashion advice, calm down,” Cas responded with another smirk—Dean lived for those smirks when it wasn’t so damn frustrating sometimes—and finally gave up on the full amount of teasing, grabbing the boxers fully and giving a gentle tug in the right direction.
Cas smiled and brought Dean in for another quick kiss, trying to make the moment stretch out just a little longer.
All reactions to sudden grief happen almost all at once. When you catch your breath and wipe your tears and try to gather yourself, you have the false belief that you are in the clear. You can keep yourself composed.
But now, sitting there and watching Cas work through his rocky course to his future play out on his face, Dean felt pity and sympathy. If Cas didn’t go through with Michael’s plans, their family would fail, and Cas would most likely suffer just knowing how Michael operated. If Cas went through with it to save his family—
“Do you need help with that?”
Even in cool water, their bodies retained their warmth and Cas tried to control himself as Dean held onto the edge of the pool, pulling himself in. No fooling around. No games.
Cas, slow to open his eyes, nodded, “Let me tell Jack by himself first. I don’t want him confused with all the excitement.”
But it wasn’t hard to connect the dots.
He knelt down and opened the kit, using his phone as a flashlight and holding it in his mouth as he went to work.
“St. Mary’s cemetery on the other side of town” Dean answered with a deep sigh. “He died last year.”
Cas wanted to shake her and tell her that she wasted valuable time—but it would do nothing to bring the time back.
“I mean, sure, but maybe—”
Dean stayed, taking everything, which only drew Cas’s orgasm out even more.
The pleading, the anger, the sadness, and everything in between happens within minutes of each other and don’t plan on taking a break any time soon.
“It wasn’t me doing it—”
Over the last several days, it became painfully clear that speaking with Hannah would be a difficult thing to do. It wasn’t that she had an annoying voice or speech pattern, but just had no stories or no interesting facts about her that Cas could enjoy listening to. Her life sounded devoid of any color, just like his own.
you like it?” Dean asked, words hot in Cas’s ear. Cas nodded, half-aware of his movement. Dean began to pick up the pace.
But it didn’t change anything. That underlying, unspoken fear that had been with Dean since the first day they met had queued up in the back of his mind, waiting to take a swing.
Cas leaned in once more to place another kiss just above Dean’s naval, eliciting that swooping feeling once more and sending another wave of shivers all over. Hands gently pulled his jeans down, just to get them started, and Dean regretfully pulled away from Cas to step out of them completely.
“I don’t understand.”
One was him flipping the camera off after he took a shitter off the board, but the other one, the last one sent, was of Dean laying on his back at the lake with the hat over his head, just after he—
“Yeah, it does,” he answered, squeezing Cas’s hand again, “It’s why I bought a ring too. The dream was just flashes of random—whatever here and there but in each one, you had it on your finger and I couldn’t stop looking. And then when I woke up I couldn’t stop thinking about
The whole outfit drastically contrasted with Cas’s day-to-day attire, but after stating his concern, Dean only shrugged.
Cas blinked a few times to come back to the present and looked over at Hannah.
“So hopefully you’re doing okay at that party,” Dean grinned before ending the video.
He frowned and glanced at his phone again for the time. Cas had been gone nearly ten minutes and the bathroom was only just down the hall.
Cas didn’t know Dean had bought a house.
Glancing back, he saw Cas reaching over the counter, thanking the man while they shook hands. Cas tucked the ring box, wrapped in a blue plastic, into his jacket pocket and waved as he turned to head out the door.
Part of Cas always wondered why fulfilling the family’s duty to uphold their Catholic heritage relied on him when most of their family, as they grew older, stopped caring about the church. Michael was able to go to school and become a priest as well, but he decided he wanted to go into banking then the family business of real estate development. No one gave him grief for that. Gabriel was…Gabriel and couldn’t be told to do anything, and eventually, people stopped trying. Lucas disappeared without a trace after falling flat on his face in public while running for Mayor five years prior.
Dean took a deep breath, glancing at where the sun finally vanished below the horizon.
“I’ve been afraid of stepping out of line my whole life, and it took meeting you to realize that I don’t have to do everything I’m told.”
This was the first time Dean had seen them positioned like this but reflected back to him. Sometimes it still took him aback just how peaceful it all was, how rare it still seemed even though it was an everyday occurrence. Each small action, smile, kiss—everything always felt like the first time, just like when they were first learning how to be with each other—despite it being four years later. Dean once wondered if it was due to all the years they had circled around each other, his brain making up for a decade of lost time.
Pushing open the door, Cas stood by the farthest wall, next to a corner mirror, the small smile still on his face as the jackets hung next to him, an eyebrow slightly raised—expectant.
“Absolutely nothing.”
As Dean neared the end of the pasta aisle, he saw, almost in slow motion, another cart turn the corner. He threw his left leg back down and tried to stop the cart in time but it still collided with the other one, knocking it hard enough to force it to face in the other direction.
Sitting in his friend’s truck, driving another man out to a field to play astronomer and then fuck under the stars was
was when Dean threaded his hands in Cas’s hair and clenched his fist like Cas had done to him the other night. It was a small gesture, a small memory, but it pulled the right strings and snapped the tension inside Cas.
The worst thing was Cas’s age difference from the rest of his family. He was an accident, an “oops,” and all of his brothers were at least twelve years older than he was. It was hard getting them to understand what it was like being in their early 20s again.
They had only done anything like this once before in another store while trying on bathing suits, their first year at the lake cabin. They crowded into a small changing room, in a store almost as devoid as the current one, escaping the eyes of the fitting room attendant. It initially wasn’t to do anything handsy but to just give real-time comments on if the suits looked okay or not.
9:16 p.m.
For every scenario Cas’s mind imagined for him, away from Worthington, a duplicate spun off showing Cas all alone.
, Jesus—fuck,” Cas began to babble. He was there. Right there. “Dean—you gotta—I’m—”
Someone had blindfolded Cas, shoved him in faraway places his entire life, and then told him to live out the rest of his life where they don’t have to see him, and he will be quiet.
“Well, you were right, I was wrong,” she admitted, “Or more like those who investigated got it wrong and that’s a problem that has to be fixed. Do you know this man?”
Cas hummed a response as he moved again, a little more speed, a rhythm finally developing. Dean put both hands back up against the mirror, wanting to see as much as he could of Cas' face. But his own as well, an unusual thing to see.
, the voice reminded Dean but his racing heart drowned it out. Images of a bruised Benny, despondent Cas, and his dad laying in a hospital bed, wasting away to nothing—
Dean watched the mirror, more entranced than before. Of their years together, Dean couldn’t remember a single time where he saw them like that. And they moved so easily together, even standing (which wasn’t their forte), even when someone was down a little ways away from them—Cas didn’t stutter.
They waved each other off as Dean got to his door. He waited until Sam rounded the corner, heading to his own room, before taking a deep breath to shake off the conversation.
But Cas didn’t pick up the phone either.
Dean huffed and squeezed his legs again, impatient.
He even decided to leave his bible, a family hand-me-down that had “Phil’s Motel” stamped on the flyleaf.
But no one else.
“Dean,” Cas said, attempting a serious tone but when Dean glanced up back into the mirror he saw a small smile, “Do you want to draw or—?”
major in Theology and get a masters and sh-stuff?” Dean held back the curse word—Castiel didn’t seem like the kind of guy who spoke like that.
Michael left Cas alone as he packed up some extra stuff he couldn’t the other night. But as Cas walked into the library, he saw Michael sitting in an armchair by the window, pensive and lost.
“Yes.”
Gabriel paused on the other side of the phone after Cas finished before putting forth a heavy, frustrated sigh.
The town was lucky in the sense they had a bar that opened from 10 a.m., lasting to 2 a.m. Dean wasn’t sure how they swung it, but like most things, he figured Michael was somehow involved. Dean had never needed to utilize the place’s early hours until that morning.
“Was it—I don’t know—good?”
“Should we finish our drinks first?” Cas asked, glancing at Dean’s still almost full glass.
“How long have you been holding that in?”
Something wasn’t clicking in Dean’s head, but he couldn’t put his finger on it.
Dean.
“You’re still scared of something.”
But looking at the shirt, Cas had doubts. There was lighthearted ‘different’ and then there was whatever this was.
As Cas stood, he barely had enough time to rebalance himself before Dean pressed him back up against the fence with languid kisses. He explored Cas’s mouth and Cas tried to hold himself up — he always felt a little weak at the knees when Dean did this right after Cas got him off like that.
“You’d have to ask him that for any concrete answer,” Cas said, but smiled, “However, I think it safe to assume that yes, he is.”
But Dean couldn’t shake the warning Benny had given him earlier.
Dean shivered, despite his warmth, excited for this situation they didn’t often find themselves in—usually too content to just relax in the water and talk nonsense until it became too cold.
“My phone was dead.”
“I’m not saying it until you say it,” he whispered back, slipping his hand down once the pants were loosened, drawing a gasp out of Cas.
“Tell me more about this man.”
“We?” Cas looked down at his phone which he didn’t realize until now was dead.
Any thoughts of doom and gloom that filled Cas that afternoon was immediately pushed out of his mind as excitement took over. He had to wait a few more days but it gave him something to look forward to.
“Does that make sense?” Cas asked, and Dean nodded.
“You said you had a date with Hannah?”
A small match of hope sparked inside Cas as he practically leaped off the stairs and ran over to the neighboring house, forgetting all about the woman.
“Yes,” Cas flushed, trying to find his way back to the conversation, “And I wouldn’t mind a few more but—that’s not—”
, like he just
Cas would be lying to himself if he said he was going out into town to just do errands.
“I told you, I didn’t think it looked—“
Dean leaned over and took the cup away from him.
Dean glanced over at Cas and almost wished he hadn’t.
“I just got a call from the Missouri State Police department,” Joshua said, pausing again. Cas tightened his grip on the steering wheel. “They were called to the cabin about forty-five minutes ago. I guess—a heard what sounded like gunshots—” Ice cold dread sank into Cas, all the way to the bone “—went outside, and saw Dean laying outside the house with a gunshot wound his upper chest—not exactly sure where.”
Dean eventually lapped the entire front and side yard with the fear of being caught soon replaced by confusion. There was the possibility Cassie never wound up coming—it was a strong possibility, but she said two weeks ago—
“Is there any chance you’ll wind up falling in love with her and end up happy? Like, any at all?”
, Cas’s thoughts stopped on that word. It sounded so foreign, and too soon to use it. Way too soon.
“What is that supposed to mean? Are you intentionally trying to get Dean thrown out of Worthington?”
He felt his knees bump into Dean’s as he imagined what it must have been like for Dean. It was the nightmare scenario that Cas was terrified of for years but Dean was the one who had lived through it already. Judging by his sagging shoulders and inability to look Cas in the eye, it still deeply affected him.
Over the years they had several “fresh air” trips which landed them always at Glen Elder park, about forty minutes away.
“No I’m not—”
The fear laid in the shadows of Cas’s mind; the notion of Dean eventually calling quits and moving on to someone else. Cas didn’t think it would come down to lack of enthusiasm, but because Cas had too much baggage with his family, needed answers faster than Dean wanted to give them, and had such a tangled future that no sane person would volunteer to sift through.
Dean pointed at moving trucks.
You start searching for the rewind button because there has to be one, just to make sure you can get everything out you meant to. But no button exists, and there’s no rectifying the fact some things had been left unsaid.
“Yes,” Cas answered, not looking at Joshua, not wanting to see that look of pity that Hannah also gave him yesterday.
“What? What will you do to me? I can tell her anything I want, especially if she’s going to be my wife,” Cas almost choked on the word wife.
“You said there was something else?”
, Cas repeated to himself as he drove back to the church to pick up his things.
And it was all Dean needed.
“Yeah, but…” Lee trailed off and Benny frowned.
Castiel sighed like Dean had just asked him the meaning of life.
Cas shook his head.
Dean pursed his lips and mentally cussed Jack out in his head even though he knew Jack didn’t understand ‘tact’ yet. Staying silent for a moment, Dean took his time so he could choose the right words, otherwise--
“It’s such a shift for us, I think we needed the night to process it ourselves. Maybe even like, a week or something. We’re happy, but it’s still so brand new,” Dean said, thinking back to the park, the surge of confusion and emotion and adrenaline fueled giddiness that he hadn’t felt in a long time.
3:40 p.m.
But the fear always popped up when they had to do things like grocery shopping alone, pretending not to know each other. They were terrible actors and couldn’t play it off as just two friends buying some bread. They knew their limits.
The sunny and mild early-autumn temperatures had been replaced by overcast, foggy, and chilly weather overnight—but Dean was insistent that he finish putting up the window frames inside the barn. They wanted to get at least the first coat of paint done before the weather truly turned cold for the rest of the year.
He sighed.
Keep it simple.
“Ooh baby that’s nice,” he mumbled to himself with a smirk.
Dean watched, expressionless, as a hand covered Castiel and someone behind him began chanting words, causing the world around him to disintegrate into the abyss.
Dean said nothing.
“You don’t have to do that,” Cas said, but Dean pretended not to hear him as he patted himself to make sure he had his wallet and keys. He dropped a few extra bucks for the bartender, who waved his thanks.
But now the thought only brought sadness and worry. He didn’t want to be alone there anymore.
“I’m sorry,” was all Cas could say, finding himself wishing he could somehow go back in time to five years ago when he contemplated dropping out of college when he himself was battling with the self-realization. If he did that, he could have come back home and maybe have met Dean sooner, before the Grays moved in, before they got caught in whatever web they were in now.
They settled on the couch facing each other as Cas drew one leg up underneath him. Dean mirrored the position. His mind raced a mile a minute but there were no thoughts associated with it, just the laborious energy spent in trying to sprint to the desirable outcome. Dean already started to feel out of breath just sitting there. Trying to swallow, he gave up, realizing his mouth was too dry.
Lucas had Jack, illegitimate and part of his scandal that was released to the public during Lucas’ campaign. The woman, Kelly, had died giving birth to him and Lucas at first offered to take care of him, but then signed over adoption papers to Michael realizing he was unfit to be a father. Cas always gave him credit for that.
“Aren’t you going to show me around?” Cas asked, keeping his tone light. Dean hesitated before moving forward, brushing past Cas.
But that night, as Dean drifted off to sleep first, Cas had watched him, allowing wisps of thought to float in and out of his mind. They deposited vague, generalized scenarios of them together, asking him how it felt when he saw a text or call from him, videos, pictures, that weird sensation whenever Dean smiled or said his name.
“And then you came, and I still—I wouldn’t allow myself to go anywhere near this kind of future with a ten foot pole,” Dean continued with a deep sigh, “It was easier to accept nothing was gonna come out of my trying, which is why it took me—which is why I just learned to keep my mouth shut. I couldn’t get hurt if I didn’t put myself out there to get hurt. You know? And I think that all came back when I bought this.”
“I know you have a sense of what would be good for Hannah,” Michael started, gesturing to Zachariah. It was a business meeting. “Why don’t you go first?”
“I’ll fix your leak today, I’ll come back with a belt tomorrow. Sound good?”
“Wrong, yeah,” Dean said, sighing, “But we had a chat. He was more just upset that I didn’t tell him my plan, even though I didn’t really have a plan, before it all happened.”
Sighing, Dean put on a fake-thinking face and nodded. But instead of reaching for his belt, he angled himself back in front of Cas, a little closer this time.
Cas followed him into the bathroom, also tossing his towel on the floor, watching Dean bed over to turn the water on. Cas wanted him to stay bent over, right there—
“Figured it would just be something to do tonight. I was still wired from the lake trip so wanted to kind of… ride it out,” Dean finished lamely.
Cas paused, frowning, “I don’t know if I ever had it.”
It was early, but shit, Dean needed a drink.
“Thank you for that,” Cas said with a smile, trying not to laugh at Dean’s expression as he put the car in gear and backed down the driveway.
Cas sighed as he unpacked the sheets Dean had in one of his suitcases, wanting to sleep for at least twelve hours. He lamented the fact that he had to stay in the cabin on his own when they both should have been there, both should have made themselves comfortable already.
The parts of the front yard that remained exposed to the sun had turned brown due to the drought, and the hedges needed a desperate trimming. A high wooden fence blocked the view into the backyard, but Cas could feel the bass of the music through his own vehicle.
“Burned wings meant you weren’t coming back. I know how the rules work,” Dean explained, trying to stave off the memory of those markings when he went to lift Cas off the ground.
The hope lasted as long as it possibly could, but decision after decision led to what Castiel figured to be the second worse outcome for them all.
Cas let his body do what it needed to do, staying in as long as he could, and Dean let him as they came down together. He could feel Dean’s heart racing against his own, and for a minute, it really did feel like they had blended together, sharing the same breath, the same heartbeat—shared everything.
Dean didn’t look at it or Cas’s.
“Nah—I’m not sick, my AC’s been broken since last night and I probably just look like death,” Dean explained, walking toward him.
Dean turned back to Cas to say something else but the words died in his throat as he saw Cas watching the angel. The light of the color wheels also played off of his face, illuminating him in a multitude of colors and brightening his eyes, making them look almost rainbow. The sight of Cas’s wonderment only confirmed what Dean had decided on when he first bought the house.
Cas had no answers. Just like he had no answers for Hannah.
“I’m assuming that during this party I’m supposed to introduce myself and try to win her favor like we are actually living in this Shakesperian drama like you said, and somehow end up in one of those new homes in Stony Gates with three children and a dog?”
Dean thought about their conversations, how it felt being around Cas and that night at the hotel—but overshadowing it was the simple fact that Cas was on a path that Dean couldn’t follow.
“The photo—,” Cas cleared his throat, “I really liked that photo.”
Dean stopped his cart to look at Castiel, so the man knew he was telling the truth.
“I was looking for a Cassie, I think the person I asked didn’t hear me right.”
“Yeah—I mean I liked Gabriel though he picked on my brother a lot–I don’t think it was because of all this,” Dean explained. “Lucas seemed…”
“Are you going to give it to me?” Cas finally asked, his voice not quite scolding as it was teasing. Dean smirked.
“I think you’re right, but maybe it’s your jeans that’s dulling the appearance,” Cas said, keeping a straight face, looking back up at Dean in the mirror.
As both of them felt that tension wind tighter and tighter inside, Dean withdrew to take up a different position. But as he pushed up, Cas watched as Dean’s eyes slid to a spot just to the left of him.
He didn’t really care which star he pointed to at that point.
—” Dean emphasised, looking down at Cas who felt the heat rising in his face, “–got something to say and wanted to—”
Confused, happy, and tired, Dean turned and went inside, crawling into bed smelling like smoke and summertime, not bothering to change his clothes as he dreamed of beaches, cottages, and long, nighttime talks.
Cas frowned, confused.
Dean leaned forward a little, still aware of the man sitting behind them.
, Cas repeated to himself as Dean dissolved into a litany of mumbled swear words and pleas to continue.
There were small clusters of cabins, smaller and more rustic looking, on the road which made a back loop into the woods on a slight incline. Dean’s destination rested just as the road began its curve upward, the last cabin to have a lake view.
Pausing for half a second, Cas held up his hand so Jack could see the ring.
Heart beating a mile a minute, Cas took a few unsteady steps over to the couch. He collapsed onto it, staring off into space as Zachariah’s threat echoed in his head.
But that’s not how their game worked. Cas instead decided to turn his back on Dean to undo his shirt, much like the other night. He heard the sigh of disappointment and a frustrated kick in the water. Cas smiled as he glanced over his shoulder, undoing the last button. Much like the other night, Cas slipped the shirt off and folded it neatly on the chair.
“But I could have stopped you,” Cas countered, “and I didn’t. But that’s why I said the other night—”
The second time, Dean’s fist collided with Michael’s nose with a sickening crunch. Michael jerked back, falling over another chair while he held his tie up to his nose to absorb some of the bleeding. Dean followed him to the ground and held him there by his shoulder, throwing another punch, making contact with Michael’s jaw. That one hurt Dean, but he didn’t care—it was a satisfying kind of pain.
“Oh,” Dean cut off Cas before he could finish.
“You like it that much when I swear?”
Dean told himself, staring at Cas’s mouth as the fingers slid themselves to the front, working open his button and fly.
“You look upset.”
A brief flash of regret hit Cas, asking him what he thought he was doing stepping on the property of someone Michael has ten kinds of aneurysms about—
“No,” Cas cut Sergeant Mills off, “That was the uncle of the girl my brother Michael and
within the twelve hours he had the ring.
They didn’t mind the work. It made the place their own.
Dean frowned.
“If no one says anything and we don’t act any differently, then it’ll take him three days. Maybe. If he doesn’t realize it before he leaves, then that’s a solid two weeks Eileen would have to keep it to herself.”
Dean decided to try one more time.
what things were like.
It was also the first time since high school he had heard someone admit to their preferences out loud and wasn't found out in an extremely embarrassing way. Charlie was a blip that never saw a follow-up act by anyone.
“You decided a week before you left?” Dean asked, astonished, “I thought it was months before.”
The man sounded genuinely miserable, but Dean didn’t see it that way.
Cas thought about the previous afternoon for only a moment before shutting it out of his mind completely, hugging Dean closer to him. If he held tight enough, maybe he wouldn’t have to let go at all, and none of the problems that awaited them would manifest.
“Cas I’ve been looking forward to this all morning please just get over here,” Dean all but whined, voice already taking on a hoarse tone.
“You weren’t lying when you said you didn’t do anything to bring me back, right?”
“Wait.”
Dean shrugged and sighed, “Well, she’s a black girl in a sea of rich, white, midwestern freaks so I’m sure it won’t take long.”
“I don’t feel like I can do much good while I’m here.”
Dean glanced over to Reynolds to shoot him a reassuring albeit awkward smile.
“Your friend jumped me at the club.”
“Mr. Johnson has one I believe. He just arrived, I haven’t filled him in on any of this and I don’t think the police—”
Dean nodded as well but didn’t say anything at first. Another moment passed before he sighed, moving off of Cas and out from under the pillow to rest on his back. Cas missed the pressure and warmth immediately.
“I don’t know who those people are—and I didn’t even know who Dean was until you told me, so I don’t see how I was faulted for that first conversation,” Cas said, keeping his voice just below a shout. “And second, I was taught growing up that if someone says hello, you stop and say hello back.”
Arranged marriages were antiquated and horrific in Cas’s mind, and found it not only unfair to him but also this poor girl who may have had aspirations of her own. He didn’t know how Zachariah was but if he was a fraction of what Michael exuded in terms of authority, then she wouldn’t have a choice either.
“Is there… is there writing on yours?” Dean asked, confused.
When he pulled away, he drew out that smirk he wanted to see since he arrived; cocky, playful, teasing—normalcy.
He drew Dean in for another kiss as they waited to start round two, wanting to distract himself from the loud realization pounding in his head.
“What does Michael think you’re doing all these times you’ve gone out at night?” Dean finally asked, turning around with his shirt in his hands. Cas wished he’d put it on. It was hard enough having the conversation, even worse seeing what he was walking away from.
But he did. He owed Benny that much.
Belt on top of his shirt, Cas slid out of his shorts and everything else remaining. With a deep inhale, he turned around to witness a very flustered Dean who’s smile completely dropped.
. Reveling in every touch and whispered word, every swallowed gasp, grasp of the sheets, prayer and swears mumbled into the pillow— Dean cursed his age in the end for forcing himself asleep, knowing that had he been twenty years younger they could have gone all night and into the early morning without much of a break.
If Zachariah knew, then Michael—
“No—I mean, I thought she was going to be at this party, but this place is huge and I couldn’t find her.”
“Do you like her?” Dean asked, unable to keep the question out of his mouth.
, but Castiel didn’t take anything. Instead, they just kept talking.
And now stood close by as Cas adjusted the tripod.
It wasn’t a perfect fit—they were still two grown men in a fancy bathtub—but even a little went a long way. They took their time with Dean vaguely aware of the water beginning to cool around them and the bubbles disappearing. They kissed slowly, hands wandering wherever they wanted in the water. Only the little things were needed to jumpstart each other.
“I’m really happy for you, for you both,” Sam said, a small smile finally forming on his face, “If anyone deserves it, it’s you two.”
“Or you can warm me up, since I’m already here,” Dean suggested, pressing his mouth against the back of Cas’s neck. He had been waiting for this for hours. The hardest thing that night wasn’t keeping quiet about the rings or waiting for someone to notice—it was using all of his will power to not haul Cas into the bedroom by his shirt collar and release all that energy that had been building since he first saw Cas buy that ring.
“I should go,” Cas said, putting his phone back in his pocket.
“But you don’t like us now,” Castiel said not as a question but as a statement.
“I said I needed a switch-up instead of reading all night!” Cas raised his voice as he took a tentative first sip of his drink. The bartender didn’t lie, it was almost obnoxiously strong, and Cas was correct in guessing how sweet it would be. Cas’s face screwed up, waiting for the aftertaste to vanish.
Despite the closed door, Dean felt very exposed.
Dean smirked, understanding—but instead of going to the car, he bent back down and looked through the scope again.
“You look younger than forty,” Reynolds provided, a small smile on his face. Dean returned it.
Over the course of an hour, while staring at the ceiling, Cas moved closer and closer to his decision.
“We just came from here,” Dean mumbled as they strolled through the crowd back where they came from. When they came up alongside the side of the expo building Dean stopped.
It was Dean’s turn to sigh as he lifted himself off the couch and wandered to the fridge for a drink.
“I don’t know what I’m comfortable with yet.”
Benny paused and Dean glanced up to see him frowning in confusion.
And Castiel did, knowing full well it would be a failure.
“I’m from Worthington, just haven’t spent much time here. So you were expecting her to be in this kitchen?”
Promised “fun time” aside, they hated when they had to sleep in the car.
Michael nodded, putting his drink back down before walking over to the door. He patted Cas on the shoulder at a half-attempt at some kind of comforting gesture, before heading out into the hall. Without a word, he grabbed two other bags Cas had packed and started walking down the stairs to the car.
The gate was unlatched as Lee promised, and Dean slipped into the yard first.  Few people stood in the back garden, not bothering to turn their heads and see the new arrivals, too engrossed in their conversations.
For a while, he sat there, not able to take his eyes off of where they both had been sleeping that morning, his brain was trying to process everything and yet nothing at the same time.
Confused, Cas wandered out of his room and down to the ground floor. Dean wasn’t there. Cas made to text him again before realizing where Dean was.
Instead of panicking, Dean laughed in Michael’s face.
This was a bad idea.
“In my head.”
Benny didn’t ask why but just stared at Dean, waiting for him to say something.
Instead, Cas turned and grabbed the spare car keys hanging off the hook next to the door. He didn’t bother looking behind him as he flung the door open and slammed it hard enough behind him that the glass rattled.
“What do you mean?”
“All I know of arranged marriages is from those romance novels where the lady has money the dude wants or something,” Dean finished lamely.
“Nice they had those, didn’t want to catch a dry tree on fire in a wooden cabin,” Dean mumbled, watching the tree turn green to yellow to blue—
