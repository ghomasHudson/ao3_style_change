“Christ. Okay, Cas, lighten up, alright? You got no reason to be so damn grumpy, things are going… pretty much okay for us right now. Nothing’s tried to kill us all week.”
“Hey Cas.”
“Cas if you get a cat Dean won’t be able to come visit you, he’s really allergic to them,” Sam warns.
He tells his captain everything he observed from the past thirty seconds of play. “I thought you might want to know. You don’t have to do anything with this information, it’s just what I saw.”
“Don’t bother being sad over me.” There’s an odd scratch to Dean’s voice. Cas wonders what that means. “Last person got sad over me’s the one who sent me here anyway…”
“What?” Dean demands from behind him.
that anyone else has actually watched, so it shouldn’t be too hard.”
Looking around frantically, he checks for cracks, trying to see the spots where demons will seep in again and shatter this little escape fantasy of his. The hands on his watch move, five seconds, then ten, then twenty, then a minute. Nothing happens. Bobby’s still at the desk, nose deep in his own lore book. Dean swallows and yes, his throat is there where it should be. He’s whole. Actually physically he’s better than he can ever remember being, all the scars and crooked knuckles that healed wrong after they broke are gone and everything everywhere is so fucking
“Oh, seatbelts?”
Dean rolls his beautiful eyes. “I didn’t ask you to do that.”
“If I understand the situation correctly,” he says, very loudly and definitely interrupting, “your intent is to have a team comprised and formulated mainly for defensive tactics be an offensive juggernaut with high scoring games. I’m not entirely sure how you expect all of us to follow your logic from point A to point B in that case.”
Dean laughs and takes a sip of what’s now something with vodka in it instead of gin. “Actually I think I like this one better anyway.”
“Oops…”
“Essentially,” Cas admits, turning his eyes down to the floor. “I had no control of my actions. It was frightening and I’m still distressed by some of the things she made me do under her thrall.” Suddenly Cas stiffens and looks up. “Sam. The force I mentioned feeling.”
chuckles from where he’s wedged himself into the spot between Dean and Crowley, further separating the arrogant bastard from Castiel. “It’s called a mouthguard, Dean.”
and Crowley tap the puck back and forth between them a couple of times, then toss it to Castiel. He backhands it between his own legs towards the net while looking over his shoulder and is extremely surprised when it slips between the elbow and leg pad of the goalie. His teammates all crash into him, banging their gloves on his shoulders and head. He wonders if the hockey gods are playing pranks on them, because he got the first goal against Montreal too and that ended in a loss. Regardless, he skates for his bench, bumping knuckles with the others on his way to the end.
Um. What?
“Yeah, okay, sure. What does that have to do with…” And then it clicks. Cas’ vessel looks off because it’s aged a couple of years. “You’re from the future?”
HOW DID I MANAGE TO GET THIRTY THREE SUBSCRIBERS. I don't think I will
“And you dream about them?”
Dean sits up and rubs his forehead even though it’s already stopped hurting. Damn wings. Although actually it probably helped Cas to have billions of years to practice before even
If that actually is the reason why, it seems like it’s working a little bit. Gabriel does like his nephew after all, and he doesn’t mind pausing his busy schedule for some preening. Humans would compare it to giving a baby a bath, not really a chore most of the time as long as the baby’s cooperative and not fussy or upset.
The advantage here is that this line and this D-pair are just fantastic together. Two of the five are their most veteran players, Jesse Cuevas and Lee Chambers, so there’s a lotta experience to back up what the three younger guys bring to the table in terms of energy and speed. As they get into position around the center dot Dean notices Castiel watching everything attentively like he’s soaking up some kinda critical info through his eyes. It makes sense, though, he’s wearing an A so he’s probably doing the same thing Dean is and learning how to help manage the team.
“You know what statistics are?”
But this isn’t his usual nightmares, because Cas is here. “Dude. What the hell. Wait, which Cas are you?”
“Nah, not really. It’s not gonna, though. There ain’t any ‘better’ for me, there’s just ‘bad’ or ‘extra bad’ days.”
Eighty three subscriptions now! :)
“Don’t listen to him. You guys looked great today.”
“Sound more shocked!” he snorts. “Sammy thinks I’m not helpful? Now I’m gonna go sit in a corner and cry.”
Castiel does not look at his brother, keeping his eyes firmly fixed on his still nearly bald wing; some hints of down have begun to appear, soft and pale gray around the first tiny developments of brand new flight feathers. Currently he’s using a soft cloth to wipe away most of the oil that his uropygial glands are overproducing in order to facilitate Dean’s comfort.
“Your doctor says you still haven’t made any progress at all. It’s been over two months. I’m starting to think-”
“I know, you’re both forgiven,” she dismisses. “Cas, why didn’t you get married? You should’ve gotten married before you adopted him, I think you’d be a lot less stressed out-”
Angel blade in one palm and handgun in the other, they return to their own defensive zone - with the warding that’s been applied, flying in or out of the building isn’t possible and there are only two points of ingress, one to be manned by Mary’s team and the other to be held by Dean’s. However, flight inside the building hasn’t been blocked, so Sam and Bobby and a few other apocalypse-world soldiers will be moving around to track down any enemy angels that might try to circle through unchecked.
One final comment pertaining to DenCon - Jack is a kindergartner in this fic? And no kindergartner anywhere knows what pronouns even are. Ergo, for the purposes of this fic, I will continue to refer to Jack with he/him/his. However, in any future fics that I write, I will use they/them/theirs for Jack whenever the narrative informs me that they should be included in the cast :)
That’s just hurtful and unnecessary in Gabriel’s opinion, especially after everything that happened in the apocalypse-world. And anyway, he loves humanity almost as much as Castiel does - why the hell else would he have taken so much time to punish the scummy ones in humorously ironic ways? Plus right now he’s procrastinating on heading upstairs to churn out a fresh batch of angels in order to check up on Sam. There’s no reason anyone should still doubt him at this point.
“Whatever.”
He’s completely unprepared to land in Naomi’s office.
“Okay. Wait.” Dean drops the bottle, which he thank… whoever remembered to put the cap back on before falling over. “I thought you said you don’t want people prayin’ to you, first of all, and second I wasn’t payin’ to you anyway, so why’re you listenin’ in?”
“Yeah, but he actually loves humanity,” Gabriel points out, very helpfully in his opinion. They both seem startled when he says that. “Most of you, especially the tiny handful that’re left, are indifferent or resentful. And I’m gonna be honest, I friggin’ hate that. Because I like humans. They’re goofy and adorable and they invented string cheese. So, if I’m gonna be the boss of this overly-sterile bureaucratic nightmare, I’ll take angels like Cas over angels like you every damn time.”
“Will time correct itself, then?”
“It’s only eavesdropping if you’re standing outside their doorway,” his brother argues. “Anyway, this information is pertinent to your life, so I thought you’d appreciate it.”
“But we’re only two players. It’s not enough. We’re going to make a scandal and show the terrible practices that keep the team in low spirits. I know a reporter, she can get the work done for us, but there should be others who also speak with her about it. I think - Kevin Tran, and the goalie, the one who’s always grumpy and mean.”
“Where are we?” he asks, doing his absolute best not to sound challenging or indignant about it.
“Ativan.”
“Okay. Sure. You’re from the future, fine. What the hell is… now-you up to that he’s being so fucking sketchy about?”
“Yeah, sure.” Dean has no idea what that actually means, but he’s cool with it. Then he blinks and Cas is standing in front of him, and that’s just fucking weird, man. “How-”
rescues Castiel by snagging the puck and sending it to Kevin, who gets a breakaway.
Not that he doesn’t have good reason to believe that, Castiel realizes with a deep well of shame and regret. He’d assumed that because Dean never asked him to stay that his presence or lack thereof was inconsequential, but now he understands that Dean, in true Dean fashion, was simply unable to voice any desire for Castiel to be present. Said desire has, in fact, been there the whole time. And the only instance where Dean tried to make that desire known, to ask Castiel not to leave him, was moments before the Shadow arrived to steal both celestial beings from the room.
Movement in the corner of his eye: Jack throws Lucifer, then whips Gabriel’s archangel blade back into his palm. Gabriel holds it out ahead and his nephew shoves Lucifer forwards again to be speared through the breastbone.
Castiel rolls his eyes. So much for his night off.
Eileen comes in then, probably for a snack, and all Dean catches is “how are you” before she and Cas are just talking too fast for him to keep track of. He can understand if she’s talking to Sam because Sam’s also not quite fluent and she slows down then, but Cas knows every language ever so there’s nothing to throw up a buffer. Dean picks out a few things here and there, mostly Cas bringing up his name a lot, plus the words “hurt,” “sad,” “love.” Clearly nothing ominous here.
Dean pretends like he’s not embarrassed enough to drop dead. This is his first game as captain and he’s already fucking up before it’s even started. Awesome. He doesn’t have to look at the bench - he can fucking
“I have a half-sister named Anna, we have the same mother and she’s a year younger than I am. Unfortunately my mother had a number of mental health problems which were never resolved.”
His hearing still hasn’t cleared, but even through a half-shut eyelid Cas makes out “I’m sorry” on Dean’s lips exactly one second before he’s shuffled and jostled and finally pulled to sit upright. Cas suffers horribly for every one of those motions and then he’s propped that way, leaning into Dean’s chest. Admittedly, his breathing has slightly improved, despite the continuing tears and hiccups. Somehow he becomes aware of Dean’s phone - Dean must be calling an ambulance.
And that’s what tips over the scale. Castiel sees it flare up in Dean’s eyes and face, a reactive outrage in response to a friend who’s only trying to help. Dean’s soul is screaming and the Mark mistranslates that scream into bloodlust.
is sent out to take the faceoff in the defensive zone.
“Sure you are,” his brother snorts.
“I thought God-”
“Worst comes to worst, we’ll do it at gunpoint.” Castiel glares at him. “Oh c’mon, Cas! I was kidding! You gotta learn to take a joke one’a these days, babe.”
her pouting into her phone.
This gets a twenty minute conversation where Dean sits quietly in the back of his own head listening to Cas explaining the gist of angel wing etiquette (which is apparently A Thing) to Sammy. Cas especially stresses the whole close-family-or-mates part of being able to touch them.
she whines.
Cas is quiet for way too long, and Dean starts to sweat. Eventually: “Dean, your thoughtfulness flatters and humbles me.”
“And get this, he actually thought I should
it’s not cursed objects. Cassie, this sounds a
Cas almost chokes. “Dean, I wish you wouldn’t say or think things like that.”
He pulls out his phone and texts Meg:
“I - is it so much to ask that people just call me Sam?” he complains, rolling his eyes and pulling what Dean would usually call an
“You’re gonna be our bait,” Dean tells Jack, shrugging. “Sorry, kiddo.”
“Castiel. I thought it might be time for us to have a chat about your little escapade.”
“I knew you’d appreciate it,” Gabriel gloats, apparently interpreting his facial expression and arriving at the correct conclusion.
“How often were you down here spying on me, Cas?”
“Cas, you’re gonna be okay. It ain’t gonna last forever, you were just talking about that. Just a month to go and you’ll be able to do most things yourself again without help.” Dean’s thumb lightly brushes his cheekbone. “Here, how about after you finish your lunch we go out and do something, uh… we’ll hit up Wal-Mart for some movies. I know you haven’t seen like,
Dean stands absolutely still and stares. Castiel isn’t even convinced he’s breathing at the moment.
“So what’s goin’ on between you and that winger, Dean?” Benny murmurs, softly enough that nobody else will catch it over the clangor of the locker room.
Incidentally, I know nothing about
“Your recording equipment. Still there?” he asks in Russian.
“Why?”
The three of them relocate to the kitchen, where Sam is dutifully smacking Gabriel’s hands away from the cake every few seconds. In the center is a candle shaped like the number one. Dean attempts to sit Mary in her high chair, but she immediately relocates into Castiel’s grasp, which is typical. At any given point, the three adult residents must be prepared to have an armload of rambunctious baby Nephilim in case she flies to one of them.
“Mm-hm.” Dean nods slightly against the back of his head. “You’re g’nna be okay…”
I MADE IT TO ONE HUNDRED SUBSCRIBERS ON THIS FIC. That's amazing and I think I'm going to stop keeping track now, no exaggeration that's
Dean closes the door behind him and shucks his flannel and tee into the dirty pile, then actually takes the time to look over his shoulder at “his” wings. Small scatterings of bright spots stand out against the newly-healed skin, each one shining a different color like someone sprinkled him with rainbow glitter. The feathers aren’t growing evenly, either - there’s one of the big long primaries already forming on the end of the left one, but the right one has more down fluffed around the tiny coverts emerging on the inside. He scrounges up a microfiber towel and gently wipes away the oil, wondering how they’ll look once they stop being so bald and naked.
“I would’ve come back sooner,” Cas says. “But it took this long for Jack to figure out how to retrieve me from the Empty.”
“Dude.
“Cesar and Jesse. Charlie Bradbury. Max Banes.” Cas shakes his head slightly. “There are others as well, some who refuse to admit to it. And Lee Webb, of course.”
as unsubtle as the crush you’ve had on Cas for the past decade. Actually he’s the only thing less subtle than you, you’re both just thick.”
1. John Winchester.
So what if him and Cas are both gay, it’s not like they actually had sex or anything (again). “Are you getting all jealous on me ’cause I’m giving him attention instead?”
Cas pauses for a second.
He leaves before she can say anything else to him and turns over his gloves for drying, only ducking into the locker room long enough to retrieve his phone before secluding himself in a deserted section of hallway.
“What, with tree branches and shit? That don’t sound all that comfortable, Cas.”
“Okay, Cas. Be careful, buddy.”
“That sucks, man. At least you’re a righty since that one’s gonna be free sooner.”
“It was. I’ll speak with you soon.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Castiel, I know we aren’t close.” Cas is autistic and even
The squealing ring in his ear gradually gives way only to be replaced by the wailing sirens of emergency vehicles rapidly approaching. Cas is handled away from Dean and onto an ambulance stretcher, nowhere near gently enough, and when they ask him questions his only choice is to moan incoherently. They give up fairly quickly on that idea.
“You’re wrong.”
Castiel is so overcome with terror that he has no choice but to obey. Death, possibly older than God, can easily obliterate him. He must tread carefully going forward if he’s going to have any chance at correcting his past mistakes. They step through the door.
“Apparently the guy who likes to drop us into murderous versions of Candyland is my daughter’s guardian angel,” Dean grumbles, folding his arms over his chest with discontent. “Which is all info I found out in like the last ten minutes.”
New Jersey makes every attempt to exploit this obvious weakness, which would be considerably more frightening if they were a competent and dangerous team like the Canucks or the Habs or the Predators. It’s not especially interesting to watch, or to participate in. The Islanders are disorganized and the Devils are worthless. Castiel thinks quietly to himself that these fans should probably be asking for their money back.
- must find another way.”
On arrival, he’d been dragged into apparently some kind of family squabble by Crowley, who’d been squaring off with his mother and his son Gavin at the same time over something. Crowley dramatically announced that now all the people who hated him the most were in the same room together, and in response to this Castiel had very helpfully pointed out that Nick Vaught and the rest of the New Jersey Devils weren’t present at the moment before immediately leaving again. Crowley seems to have a habit of deliberately making bad situations worse and Castiel wanted no part of it this evening before a game.
“Yeah, Benny. And Jesse, because he was kinda our first ‘out and proud’ player, there was this big press conference and everything, it was a huge deal at the time. That was the year I got drafted, actually, and Jesse’s a good guy so I kinda went to him about it because he was already established on the team. He mentored me a little bit. But… my dad still doesn’t know. And I don’t think that’s gonna change any time soon.”
“You actually thought Cas was gonna let him off the hook like that?” Gabriel snorts, feeling for his archangel blade and quickly yoinking it back into his hand from ten feet away. “Have you
“To Dean?”
“Dean, I… I spoke with Bobby this afternoon. Or rather he spoke to me about some things. I never intended to become a problem, but it’s clear now that that’s the only thing I managed to accomplish. I was foolish and naive. And I made assumptions that turned out to be wrong.”
“There is no other way!” Prior-Castiel argues. “If you’re me, then you’re aware of that.”
“Yes, I would’ve called but I can never remember your cell phone number,” Cas explains. They go to sit in the section of the day room which has the television. “And it stands to reason Raphael would refuse to tell you where I am.”
“Dean, I’m not kidding.”
“Cas…” He stops. He has no idea what to say and it takes him a second to settle for just blurting out everything that he’s thinking. “Cas, I’m so fucking sorry, okay? And - yeah, you’ve done stuff that’s made me mad sometimes, but I never
“Super.”
“Hey, you got a phone call.”
“That’s a very discomforting statement coming from you.”
Out on the ice for warmups before the first period, Dean can’t help a self-conscious glance up at the rafters where the banners of retired numbers are on display - second from the right is
“Now promise me you won’t do it again.”
turn - Sam, and everyone you know, everyone you love, they could be long dead. Everyone except me. I’m the one who will have to watch you murder the world, so if there’s even a small chance that we can save you, I won’t let you walk out of this room.”
“Looks like you did good for yourself, brother.”
Dean makes a face and comes in to hover several feet away. “There’s more than one?”
He hears - something. It doesn’t matter what the noise is. And then four small explosions, one right after another. It’s so loud. His ears whistle but otherwise turn off. Why are things exploding? Should he even care?
Dean comes to on the shitty infirmary bed, shaking and weak and coughing up a giant blood clot that probably happened when he got speared through the fucking breastbone. When he’s done hacking up gore out of his lungs, he looks over to the only other bed and sees Jack and Sammy dicking around and repositioning Cas, who’s not even alive by the look of it.
A throat-clearing. “I see. Did you hear about Lucifer?”
“That’s rich coming from you, bucko.”
“Think you’d do better on the second line?”
Cas is woken by Gabriel repeatedly poking him in the side with the remote. “Rise and shine, Cassie! Don’t you have lunch with Anna and the dick today?”
“I know this won’t improve the situation, but I am sorry. Sam made many of the same points which you’re about to bring up and ultimately convinced me to tell you the truth.”
The thing that shines out at the end, which Dean can’t fucking believe he’s hearing himself say:
“Well, you should,” she insists, surprising him.
“Why would he do that?”
In the middle of all this, Dean does notice that Jack has a little bit of natural talent going for him. He has to wonder if Jack really is straight up adopted, because the kid does kinda look like Cas from some angles and this is almost too big of a coincidence. He’ll have to ask the next time he talks to Cas.
“Great! Wanna learn how to groom an angel’s feathers? There’s a bunch of spots I can never reach on my own, it’s easy and time-consuming so I’ll be able to answer your question in detail, and it’s nice and relaxing for both parties so you can wind down from your hunt - kinda like petting a cat, except I’m way cuter and generally more fun.”
“Cas, why didn’t you say something? We can help-”
“Charlie,” he cuts her off, “if you don’t stop hassling me about this I’m gonna ban you from using my Xbox again.”
exactly, but they’re definitely something, and he doesn’t look away as he slowly holds it out. And it makes sense. He’s not being aggressive, he just wants to see.
from me, and the fact you’re even asking that tells me you don’t know anything about handing firearms. You’ve prob’ly never even seen one in person and you’re way more likely to hurt yourself with it on accident.”
“Okay enough! I know you guys think you’re being helpful, but I don’t actually have time for this. In case you forgot, we’re literally sitting on our asses waiting for Lucifer to show up and kill us. I’m trying to help everyone get ready for that.”
Somehow, that actually does make it better. Dean manages to calm down enough that he can wrestle himself free from under his friend’s arm and go back to standing next to Cas against the wall. For all his bitching and moaning about personal space, he wants to be near Cas because at least he knows Cas won’t humiliate or make fun of him, either accidentally or on purpose. And the bastard puts a hand on his shoulder too, like on the plane however many weeks back, because despite having autism somehow Cas just
“The gas mileage hurts.”
“Hello, Jack.” The guy’s whole face lights up when he’s talking to his son. It’s super cute and Dean struggles not to start grinning just watching it. “Oh, is he winning? … Of course not. The Senators are one of the worst teams in the league and Uncle Gabe got traded to them to spite your grandpa and Uncle Mike. … Jack it’s past your bedtime and it’s a school night, I’m glad you called and that you got to watch Uncle Gabe play for a little bit but you need to go to sleep like Aunt Meg has
“Then why didn’t you just fly us someplace for breakfast?” Dean wonders, even though they’re already driving.
It doesn’t last long, almost exactly eleven seconds. Then Gabriel lets go and heads for Castiel, who’s clearly about two minutes away from succumbing to shock and losing consciousness. In spite of his own injuries, he manages to heal his little brother enough to be functional again (if still in horrible pain).
“You and Sam stay the fuck away from me,” Dean’s rough voice warns alongside his clomping footsteps. “Next time I won’t miss.”
The doors to the unit open and three people arrive: two in the forest green polo shirts which means they’re “transport” employees, and the third in between them wearing a plastic wristband and hospital pajamas. Cas risks it to look at his face… and can breathe again. This is not a demon. Sometimes the patients are demons, but this one is a person.
He wonders what he did to deserve the attention and friendship of this man… whatever it was, he’s glad he did it.
Okay. Random.
Anyway someone needs to punish Jensen Ackles for refusing to not be a homophobe when talking about Cas. Trying to be "ambiguous" about the whole thing is the exact opposite of helpful.
“How uncharacteristically observant of you, Feathers. Providing you can learn even a
of something.
Dean doesn’t miss how Cas is saying “you” and not “we,” and that really fucking bothers him.
“That’s. Dean, that’s a nice idea, but I had a panic attack at Wal-Mart while looking at movies the morning before Lucifer attacked me. This may bring up unpleasant memories.”
Cue avoidant behaviors - Cas takes out his phone to text his sister.
The remaining handful of minutes in the game are relatively uneventful; when the horn goes to signal the end of the 3rd, Castiel piles onto the ice with everyone else to celebrate with their goalie and quietly thinks to himself that he doubts their head coach will have anything nice to say about their win tonight. At the first opportunity, he goes for his phone.
“Yes,” Cas nods at the same time that Bobby gives a sharply disbelieving “What?”
Is Dean upset with him? Did he do something wrong? Cas tries to backpedal. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said-”
“You have two options,” Cas insists. “You can take care of yourself on your own or I’ll be impossible and annoying until you do.”
“It’s a shortened version of my name.”
“Oh. Great. That’s so much better, Cas.”
“Morning,” he says slowly, not a hundred percent awake yet. His wings twitch slightly behind him. “How was your hunt?”
Dean raises both palms and shoves Raphael so hard that he staggers back several feet and almost falls. “You picking on guys who can’t defend themselves around me automatically makes it my fucking concern, so how ’bout you just get the hell outta here before I kick your skinny little ass!”
what he was doing. Now explain yourself,” he snaps.
He hears the door open. “Dean?
“Cas, you - fuck, man, I thought I was too late.” Dean’s shaking and his eyes are becoming glassy. “I could’a been too late…”
“What-what did I do?” Dean asks, shaking his head slightly. “Cas - hey, c’mon, buddy. Calm down, okay?”
“What have you done?”
“Dean’s sad and I want to help him.”
“Jesse Turner set fire to the bathroom at my kindergarten.”
his friend agrees.
His largest concern, as always, is Dean.
“Yeah, I know you don’t, buddy. I don’t think anybody does. But y’know, once Sammy gets your dick brother outta the picture, there ain’t nothing here that’s gonna hurt you, okay? So you don’t gotta go around looking scared all the time like you do. It’s just your brain playing a trick like I said.”
but that hurts.
“Yeah, that. Whatever. Quit chewing it.”
“Thank you,” Layla whispers. She reaches out to grab his hand and there are tears welling up in her eyes. “And you said. You said Dean asked you to come?”
“I hope his jaw gets broken,” Castiel grumbles. “It might finally shut him up.”
Dean’s palm settles on the spot where his shoulder meets his neck; his friend’s thumb rests on his collarbone. He could grab Cas like this, move him around with probably not that much effort…
Castiel only remembers at the very last second that they’re teammates now and no, he should not be punching his liney in the face. He just barely manages to restrain himself from doing it anyway, because Crowley is simply that obnoxious to warrant being decked in the mouth.
Dean settles him on the bed, undresses him, struggles him into sweatpants and a flannel.
good news. Now we know she’s safe, you can tell Dean-”
“There’s like twenty or thirty of them now,” Dean reports. “And those are just the ones I can see, man. I bet there’s a bunch more next to my shoulders.”
“I am alive,” Dean snaps, thankfully not pulling away. He already seems to be on the brink of tears. “You made damn sure’a that, you feathered bastard…”
Naomi angles towards a point of space in recent time where she can feel the soul of Michael’s vessel; Nathaniel and Ion trail after her and the three of them settle in a parking lot outside a motel. Her feathers ruffle slightly as time stabilizes around her again and she tucks her wings against the back of her vessel, calculating how to proceed. From what she knows of Dean, he’s extremely mistrustful of angels as a rule, and also incredibly hostile to non-human parties intruding on his personal space.
Dean snorts. “Man, I did
Dean’s expression is immediately one Cas can recognize as
“Yes, thank you, because dating when I’m constantly all over the continent is extremely easy,” he says sarcastically. “And having undesirable mental functions such as autism just smooths the process further.
“I don’t know. I don’t think it matters. There’s an incredibly high mortality rate.”
“Sam, Dean is awake, I’m putting him on,” Cas informs him.
“Yeah.”
Attempting to distract himself, Castiel retrieves the Bible from where Dean set it down in order to see which version it is. Almost instantly, the book begins to burn his fingers and he drops it in alarm. The skin damage heals like always but it’s extremely concerning. Castiel wonders frantically what he’s done to deserve such an ill omen; he’s not on the best terms with Heaven right now (and really hasn’t been on good terms with them since practically the moment he met Dean Winchester), but as far as he’s aware he hasn’t done anything recently to “piss them off.”
Dean slowly reaches across the table and puts his hand on Cas’ wrist as a means of grounding. And because it’s Dean, who he trusts, the idea that he might simply be crazy like everyone says hurts a little bit less than when it comes from anyone else. And Cas wonders, for once, if he should believe it… if anxiety-not-otherwise-specified-with-psychotic-features is in fact what’s happening to him.
Day seventy five.
It begins as an intense pain, surrounding his heart. Castiel struggles to breathe evenly and quietly, not wanting to wake Dean beside him. It takes immense effort to get out of bed without disturbing the mattress. It’s fortunate that his wings are essentially immaterial and can’t impact the environment around him, because they’re flexing and spasming uncontrollably behind him.
Attention, we have passed one hundred subscribers - the current count is now 102, I love you all for keeping pace with this monstrosity of a fic 🥰
“Oh my god, why are you two like this?” Sam groans. “What’s he even saying?”
“Thanks, bonehead, we know that,” Gabriel snorts. “But humans are also really cute and snuggly, can you
“I’m watching it on tv…”
“My family sent me here. They believe I’m experiencing psychosis because I can see which people are actually demons. Why are you here?”
For a moment he watches, imperceptible, as John slumbers on the hotel bed and Dean sets about tending to a firearm. And he hopes desperately that he’ll succeed at what he now has to do.
“Mph,” he grunts around all the food crammed into his mouth.
Dean heads back to the kitchen again. He’s pretty sure there’s some pie there - pie fixes everything.
I was writing for a rarepair so I would average like five subscriptions per multi-chapter fic, this is a massive improvement :)
1. John Winchester.
“If we really want them to, they could,” Gabriel admits. “But it’s not a great idea, usually they get all panicky and scream and it’s just not fun for anybody. Plus then the angel feels vulnerable, because if your wings are stowed in the veil and not out in the open it’s harder for them to get hurt by something.” He tugs almost an entire handful of dead feathers free from Jack’s left wing and grimaces. “You’re gonna feel
And not only is it boring, but it’s also incredibly frustrating. Play is stopping almost every fifteen seconds for some fuckup or other, and near the end of the 1st the Isles and the Devils manage to both take penalties for too many men, one right after the other. Until the final six seconds before the intermission they’re at four-on-four.
“Please,” he begs, as quietly as possible short of whispering, “tell me that I can keep him safe this way.”
“I’m so proud of you, I know this couldn’a been easy,” he grins without looking. “And you can’t even see the fruits of your labors!”
“No, I mean it.”
This fic is up to fifty six subscribers, it's still baffling to me a little bit how this happens because my last fandom was mostly dead
“Thank you, Gabriel.”
What brings him to realize that he should make some attempt at contact is when a frightening theme begins to appear in Dean’s prayers. Dean murmurs similar sets of words - infrequently at first, but gradually becoming more common - which indicate strongly that Dean has no desire to remain alive. Castiel cannot allow that to stand, and is further disappointed in himself for allowing things to come this far before taking a decision to act.
“He’s my brother and this isn’t your concern.”
They hang up without saying goodbye as always and Castiel returns to the task at hand. Jack only helps until the spraying is complete - after that he abandons Castiel and returns to his bedroom and pile of Legos. Castiel watches him go and then starts putting his pads on the drying rack in the corner.
Castiel steps forward again, reaching out to cradle the sides of Dean’s damp face in his hands. Dean’s eyes close and he sobs once, a harsh and pained noise. His expression is written with anguish.
“Wow. I can’t even tell if you’re faking it or if you really are just that thick.”
Not that that wasn’t already true, of course, but he’s sure that if he gets a chance to explain to his friend why he has such an intense ongoing problem with Nick Vaught, Dean would definitely back him up and also pick fights with the son of a bitch.
“That’s for damn sure.”
“Shut up, jerk, we’re almost there.”
“Don’t transfer me again,” Cas immediately begs. “Please. I’m used to the staff here and they know me very well by now.”
“There’s no equivalent word in Enochian for ‘love.’ The closest I can think of translates to ‘worship.’ Enochian isn’t designed for emotions or endearments.”
He listens for the wings, but nothing. Fuck, those wings. It’s like all the doors in Dean’s brain got flung open at once and behind some of them are memories of glowing rainbow feathers. The most vivid is the one from when he was a kid getting his ass beat and Cas showed up randomly to intervene. Dean nests himself on the couch under a pile of blankets, pillow wedged between his shoulder and neck, and tries to sink into that feeling from when he got wrapped up nice and snug in a soft, fluffy wall. He wonders if it would be the same now that he’s grown, if Dean hugged Cas would Cas hug back with his wings?
“Quick question, babe.”
“Cas, you awake?”
The nurse only goes away when Dean gets off the bed, which leaves Cas with an abrupt shock of much cooler air across his entire back. He rolls over and sits up.
Gabriel is shaking with pain and fatigue, but he holds firm, locking his elbow and keeping the blade buried in Lucifer’s chest as the red-tainted grace-light flares blindingly from his older brother’s face. When that stops, he simply lets go of the handle, and as his brother’s body crumples to the floor the wing patterns burn in to either side like always.
They’re quiet for a few minutes, aside from shouting at the tv whenever an Islander misses a scoring chance. At one of the commercial breaks towards the end of the 1st the trivia question comes up: who were the two most recent players to have their numbers retired?
“Dean…”
“It… will require you to die.”
“Dean, he is me. You shouldn’t allow yourself to consider us separate entities. We’re the same angel from different points in time. It’s like saying you’ll be a completely different human in two years from the one you are now. I promise you, you’re the same man then. If anything, slightly more loving, or at least slightly more open about it.”
A brief silence. “I’m sorry, Castiel.”
“So, anybody you know from previous trades?” Meg asks while casually flipping channels on the tv.
(See the end of the chapter for
It only now occurs to Dean to feel weird about waking up with Cas in his bed, but y’know what, he almost died the other night and he also never expected to see Cas ever again, so he thinks he’s entitled just this once. Plus Cas didn’t seem to mind, and Dean’s a light enough sleeper that if Cas tried to get up and leave again he probably would’ve woken up and put a stop to it.
Now it’s his brother’s turn to howl in pain, but neither of them has fully incapacitated the other one yet. They stumble slightly away from each other, breaths heaving and trembling slightly from their injuries.
Castiel abruptly assembles the facts in his mind and subsequently begins to panic. The messages on Angel Radio had appeared mere minutes after he’d had sex with Dean that morning. He has a headache, when normally angels don’t experience that type of minor grievance. A Bible has burned him. He’s frightened of ingesting poisonous substances.
He stiffens for a second because he’ll
He rolls his eyes, then glances over his shoulder curiously. “How do you… y’know, flap them or whatever? How does it work?”
“Good. Don’t talk about your unholy fling with Crowley when I’m snuggling you.”
Dean. The last thing you need is to get loaded up on booze.”
“Your fucking tie, man!”
Because it’s different now.
“Aww, c’mon,
Dean takes another extended moment of silence before speaking again.
“What does it matter what I wanted when you were little?” she says, surprising him. “Sweetheart, you
“Go ahead.”
Cas plunges to the bottom, half-rolling and half-skidding all the way. When he finally lands he’s so overtaken by pain that he forgets everything else. His left wrist should not look like that. The fingers on his right hand are bent the wrong way and he can’t move them. He chokes on the blood in his mouth and closes his eyes. There’s nothing he can do.
Dean makes one omelet first and feeds it to Cas in its entirety before making a second one for himself, because otherwise his breakfast would get cold before he could get to it. Cas sits and drinks orange juice through a straw while observing Dean taking his prescriptions with swallows of coffee.
“I formed a begrudging alliance with Crowley in an attempt to overthrow Raphael. It technically worked, but in the process I inadvertently unleashed an ancient race of extremely powerful monsters from Purgatory. This temporarily cost me my life and also indirectly caused Bobby to die as well. I must undo all of that, Dean. I haven’t found another way to stop Raphael yet, but I will. And I’ll also stop myself in the process. There must be a way, I just have to find it.”
“Man, you don’t-” Dean stops abruptly and fidgets briefly before grabbing Cas, first around the end of his splint in a close approximation to them holding hands and then landing a palm on Cas’ right shoulder to squeeze gently. “There ain’t really any understanding this shit, okay? And I don’t think it really matters why he did it. The most important thing is he failed, and you’re getting better. That’s all I care about anyway.”
“Good for you, pal. Why’d you get traded?”
“I don’t know.”
ask for this. We should’a just traded for a new captain instead,” he complains.
“Yeah. But it ain’t like there’s anything I can do to fix it.”
The pain intensifies like his ribcage will burst. Castiel can only take small, ragged breaths. With great effort he manages to wrap his spasming wings around himself for protection. He wishes for Dean. If Dean knew, Castiel is sure he’d love to be present for the arrival of their child.
Back in his hotel room after, he immediately calls Charlie.
“Oh.”
3. Mention of alcoholism.
“Yes. Your boyfriend. You must wake him up at night to speak about pointless sweet things, I assume.”
“Kevin, yes,” Crowley agrees. “And the other spineless one, Corbett. Rookies are all cowards but we can convince them to do it. As long as it doesn’t show they’re the ones talking.”
“How was practice, Clarence?” is how Meg greets him as he enters his apartment.
“Sorry, I thought it was stuck.” Gabriel rubs his left wing with a towel to soak up the excess oil and then moves on to the right one. “Y’know, they’re growing in pretty fast, maybe there’s something to be said for having a soul that could burn someone’s eyes out.”
“Actually I did, Dean,” Sam answers smugly, “and the angel told me. He hasn’t done anything… yet. But he will.”
Dean grins. “You sound pretty excited.”
Castiel nods even though his friend can’t see him. “How are you, Dean?”
Cas drives back without incident and takes his ativan; once it’s had time to kick in, he feels ashamed of himself for being unable to complete a basic activity of daily living that he’s done countless times before. What’s arguably worse than the shame is knowing he’ll have to report this to a therapist he still doesn’t know well, and what’s indisputably worse is knowing he’ll have to return this evening and make another attempt.
“I was inside the veil. It wasn’t - it wasn’t really comparable to how humans give birth. I was extricating a foreign soul from my being.”
Cas shoves the paper away from himself so that it won’t get ruined as he promptly bursts into tears. Dean’s not allowed to visit him yet, not for another four days, and technically shouldn’t call him on the phone either. But Cas misses him so much, his warm hugs and the way he smells and his general goodness despite the perpetual bad moods he seems to have.
Dean tries to say something, anything, but all he can spare is a shaky whine. He almost falls asleep, or more like he drifts into a half-doze for awhile. Is it blood loss or Cas who’s responsible for that? Because he thinks maybe he should try to stay awake, or something.
Oh, look at that. Dean’s about to fucking cry right in front of both of them. That can’t be allowed to stand.
Daniel comes back and slaps Lee on the shoulder, effectively rescuing him from Crowley’s bullshit. Before Lee can go for his interview, and before Dean can lose his nerve, he clears his throat.
in season 14. It's despicable.
“Around fifty to sixty percent. Which means removing a corpse, handling a newborn, and attempting to help the bereaved second parent cope with the loss.”
“They’ll execute him. It’s not a risk I’m willing to take.”
“Sorry, kid, I got stuff to do.” At least he does seem genuinely apologetic about it. “Maybe tonight when the humans are all conked out.”
“I don’t own keys, Dean. Were you expecting me?”
He’s aware that by the end of this rant his voice has reached such a volume and pitch that Dean and Jack have undoubtedly heard him, but it’s impossible for him to care about that right now. He can’t recall ever having been so upset with Sam before. Somewhere in one of the cabinets an entire stack of ceramic plates abruptly shatters.
“Soon as we’re done here I’m kickin’ his ass!”
Cas realizes. It’s not a “crush,” he’s in over his head. But really, he doesn’t mind that either.
“No, I’ve been indisposed. My hands are still injured.”
Cas has previously slept snuggled up to his friend but this, clumsily holding hands with at least a foot and a half of space between their bodies otherwise, impossibly feels much more intimate and private - possibly because privacy at the hospital was a laughable idea at best. And now making contact with those green eyes is somehow shocking in a way it’s never been before.
“That you, Cas?”
“Yes. I’ll be permanently erased.” Then Castiel realizes what Death just said. “You meant Gabriel. But he was killed by Lucifer.”
Someone bangs on his bedroom door. “Yeah, what?”
But his prayers aren’t about emotions. He’s begging for help, for an answer, for anything at all. He must save Gabriel in order to save Dean but at the moment he has no way to realize that goal. Not without outside intervention.
“Alright. Well, don’t worry about it, Sammy’s a genius and he’ll find a way to get Raphael to fuck right off.”
“Samsquatch brought you some stuff too.”
“Shhh,” Dean whispers from behind him, very gently hugging him a little closer. “You’re okay, Cas.”
My head! Right now!” he bellows, ragefully jabbing a finger to indicate as if anyone could possibly miss it. Meanwhile, Dean has actually collapsed to the floor with hysterics, breaking the mug and getting coffee everywhere.
“You’ll be fine, Dean,” Cas says dismissively. Then his arms tighten just a little and his wings come around to wrap them both in a blanket of soft feathers. “Better?”
“Yeah…”
“It’s temporary,” Jack says one last time, then reams the angel blade straight into the middle of his chest.
Castiel smacks him again and immediately leaves. He swallows his anger and returns to the “Dean cave,” utterly unsurprised to have Dean and Jack both staring at him upon entry. He looks at them, sighs heavily, and sits beside Dean on the couch with his eyes fixed pointedly on the screen. Dean grabs onto Castiel’s wrist and by this point he decides it’s a compulsion, not a deliberate action on Dean’s part. Dean is indescribably afraid that Castiel will vanish.
“You don’t have feathers, though. So what’re you giving Dean?”
Tiny feet come running up behind him. “Hi, Daddy!”
“I told him not to say anything.”
“Yes. Well… you don’t really have a choice, do you?”
“Cas-”
A flare of agony spears through Dean’s head and spine, ripping his tiny moment of clarity out by the root. He abruptly stops crying and almost can’t remember why he started doing it in the first place.
“I hope you understand that that doesn’t answer my question, Dean.”
and then
“You ever think maybe you gotta realize you’re
“Up yours, mate. You took seventeen PIM tonight for no reason, ergo you have absolutely no grounds to criticize me for a two minute minor.”
“He did. Angels were instructed by God to love humanity when you were first created. I don’t believe He meant for us to have favorites, but Dean is mine.”
Okay, yeah, Cas kinda has a point. Dean rolls his eyes and doesn’t argue, largely because he’s still pretty tired and his side hurts and his wings ache and the sooner he gets this over with the sooner Cas will quit nagging him and he can go take a shower.
“No. You’re going to live. I want you to live.”
“Dude, personal space,” Dean snaps, stuffing his phone into his pocket. Even with it not being anything that Cas especially would find incriminating, it’s an embedded reflex like anything he does on the ice. That’s just what happens when you spend almost thirty three years in the closet. “You should know better, man, come on.”
“I don’t miss my former team,” Castiel Shurley says flatly, which is really surprising actually. “Fortunately despite the sudden trade I wasn’t forced to move.”
“Dean, it’s your turn.”
“I’m not - unloved,” he argues, even though there are times when he’s not sure that’s true. “Sammy, Mom, Jody. Jack. You, maybe - do angels even love?”
Which is completely fair and he knows it. “Okay, I’ll try.”
Benny Lafitte pops up next to Dean to join his stretching routine.
“Great!” Dean tries to sit up but realizes it’s not actually worth the effort and stops.
“Do you want me to start again from the beginning?” Sam asks, his tone of voice indicating that he’s desperately struggling not to be impatient with his mother.
“Gently, first of all,” Gabriel warns. “Don’t yank on the feathers, if there are any loose ones they’ll fall out pretty easily when your fingers pass through them. Mostly you’re just straightening them out, some of them are clumped up and crooked. Like I said, it’s really easy.”
“Great, let’s do that!”
“It feels good,” Castiel attempts to explain.
“What?”
“Anyone ever tell you you’re whipped?” Gabriel snorts, then grabs him by the shoulder and flies them again.
“Why, you Jewish or something?”
Gabriel grins even though he’s facing away. “I
Cas’ eyes open slightly wider. He seems like he’s recovering a little more. “Thank you, Dean.” A pause. “Angels are repeatedly warned against direct contact with humans. Especially for long periods of time. It leaves me to wonder if every angel came to Earth and met a human, how many of them would also fall the same way I did. We’re instructed to love all of God’s creations, but effectively from a distance. And Death said that I was doomed to this long before the blueprints of you had even been devised.”
Of course, Eileen is there too when Dean comes in. He cracks his beer and takes a long gulp of it, then sets it down so his hands are free.
Weirdly, Dean can tell even without looking that his friend is trying not to laugh. “You’re very straightforward and predictable sometimes.”
“I’m sorry, it was necessary to prevent further discomfort in the future…”
“What about you?”
Dean groans. “Man, you gotta learn this shit. Here.” He digs through his stuff and accidentally knocks his tylenol bottle out. “Oh, uh, yeah. If you ever have to get something outta my luggage, this bottle ain’t actually painkillers, so don’t take them.”
“No, no, it’s another patient,” she soothes, patting the back of his hand. “He’ll be here after lunch today.”
Cas.”
Cas pulls him in for a hug and Dean grabs back twice as hard, because maybe if he holds on tight enough Cas can’t leave. Then something tickles the back of his neck and when he turns his head enough to look, there they are, wrapping him in a blanket of iridescent plumage. Dean lets go with one arm so he can touch, gently carding the feathers with his fingertips.
“The fracture is too complex, the cast can’t come off for at least three and a half more months. Although it’ll likely be closer to five months in total, counting the past two weeks.”
Cas shakes his head and hugs himself tighter. A nurse gives him his ativan and a carton of orange juice, and once he’s taken it Dean’s arm moves across his shoulders. Cas lets the nurses pat his hands sometimes but in general doesn’t like to be touched by people… this, though, he’s alright with. Dean will protect him from Raphael. He’s safe with Dean.
“Do you want to tell me why you’re upset?”
They return to the locker room, where Crowley is also now taking a turn getting into it with their head coach. During the entire intermission, John doesn’t critique them at all, because he’s too busy being argued with by somebody. In Castiel’s opinion that’s a distinct improvement over the norm.
“Eat your pie,” she orders instead of directly answering that, stuffing a fork into his hand.
“But you… you don’t find me to be enough of a problem to destroy,” he observes.
Everyone’s dressed for practice and then it’s speech time - first the usual rant from John, demanding an exceptional performance from them this year because last year they didn’t make it past the first round of playoffs, and then Dean has to stand up and give a hi-I’m-your-captain-now-but-don’t-worry-we’re-all-equals shpeil.
“Um. Wait,
solid chunks of frozen galvanized rubber smashing them in the face at a hundred miles an hour. Crowley is making fun of them both, but they’re ignoring him because everyone knows the bastard mostly just loves the sound of his own voice. One of their brand-new baby rookies, Kevin Tran, is asking John about something, which he’ll learn probably immediately is
It’s impossible to make Gabriel angry. That doesn’t stop Cas from trying on occasion when his brother is being extra-irritating. Presumably this is a typical sibling dynamic, though, because he’s seen it in action between Dean and Sam as well.
Castiel wants to converse and offer comfort, but that would be odd and suspicious to Dean at this stage. Instead he walks over purposefully and in silence, then presses his fingertips to his human’s forehead and threads his grace through every inch of tissue. It rolls freely, gleefully, finally performing the task it’s been so interested in since he arrived here. Reigning it in again is almost a challenge. The handprint is still there, a fragment of Castiel is buried in Dean’s skin, and right now it’s still fresh and very much tangible. Eventually it’ll fade until it’s barely present.
as it floods him with adrenaline.
Playing against New Jersey is annoying. Their uniforms are ugly and their crowd is obnoxious, and Castiel isn’t excited for the time soon to come when his nemesis is back on the ice. (Although, granted, Nick isn’t his only enemy in the NHL. He’s fairly certain that Crowley still technically counts in a way, and of course there’s also Sergei Vantis.)
“What?” Cas looks terrified.
Gabriel isn’t an idiot, and he also isn’t a Winchester, so he doesn’t go charging right at his older brother. Instead he telekinetically grabs Lucifer by the wing and yanks sideways to throw him through a piece of machinery, which breaks apart under the impact and scatters impressively in several directions while Lucifer skids along the floor for several feet.
Cas shakes his head slowly. “It’s not too late, Dean. Why should it be too late for you?”
“Yeah, but you actually know stuff about humans, plus you’re more up on Heaven’s politics than I am.”
already told you to do. Okay. Yes, I love you too. Goodnight, Jack.”
She tries to pat his arm but he flinches back. He won’t tolerate being touched at this time.
Jack looks straight-up depressed now. “Oh.”
Nighttime, between days sixty seven and sixty eight. Cas is not in his own bed.
“No, apparently she wants to discuss something with him. I’m sure it has nothing to do with you, Dean. My world might revolve around you, but that doesn’t mean everyone else’s does.”
“Awesome!”
“Uncle Gabe, I’m confused.”
“Presuming I’m forced to hide and he finds me…”
Castiel slips closer to the Prince of Hell’s holding pen, further dampening his grace and beginning to feel pain the way humans feel it behind his vessel’s chest wall. It’s a struggle not to gasp sharply for air, but he needs to be as covert as possible. He tucks his wings uncomfortably tightly against his back. The heat of this place is becoming noticeable.
“THAT’S SO GREAT I’M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS”
“Hello, Anna. I’m currently sitting on a bench in my underwear, can it possibly wait for another half hour?”
After multiple bowls of oatmeal with strawberries and five Advil, Castiel goes to the practice arena. As is typical right now, Dean is present along with everyone else, but the types of exercise he can do are somewhat limited and he isn’t allowed on the ice for skills or scrimmages at all. He has his regular trainer and one of the medical trainers keeping eyes on him the same way Castiel watches Jack’s Halloween or Christmas candy to make sure none is getting eaten immediately before dinner; from this, he surmises that Dean has had issues in the past adhering to a recovery schedule. Given what Castiel understands about Dean, that isn’t surprising at all.
“I’m not sure it isn’t,” Cas says, frowning a little. “Sometimes, at least, it’s probably different. And I frequently don’t have enough experience to draw from to differentiate between emotions. I maintain what I said. I learned how to love by watching you.”
It comes into his head for a moment, how before lying on his back was simply discomforting for reasons he never put words to but now it’s nearly unbearable to the point of dosing himself with benadryl in order to fall asleep. Because it reminds him too much of being on the receiving end of Lucifer’s wrath, planted on the floor and facing upwards while being strangled or in debilitating pain - in either case, waiting to die.
“Healing slowly. I can cautiously predict that this won’t be necessary for more than a month or so, six weeks at most. I’m surprised he allowed it at all, to be honest. Usually Dean tends to roll over and accept death rather than put himself in such a compromising situation.”
it,” she keeps going, ignoring his reaction. “And after I read John’s journal and everything he wrote about you I was surprised when Sam brought it up. But this isn’t… it’s not a
“Forgive me for not seeing the humor in this situation.”
“What?”
“Yeah, Cas, I got it.” Dean takes a breath. “I’mhavingasexualitycrisisorsomeshit.”
Dean breathes heavily as he stands, control slipping again. Castiel can feel his thoughts and emotions, how he knows he needs to escape
“Say you’ll be less inept about this than either of our brothers have been until recently.”
“Hey, I’m excited for you, buddy, I really am,” Dean promises. “I just wish it wasn’t ruining all my shirts.”
“I agree with Uncle Gabe,” Jack butts in. “String cheese is a very fun snack.” He looks at Gabriel hopefully. “Can I go see my mother?”
“Cas…”
“Jack.”
difficult for me to actually write Dean and Cas fighting together. I tend to be part of fandoms with levels of violence that average between "fairly frequent" to "extreme," and in other fics I've written at least a few pretty slick fight scenes that I'm admittedly very proud of, but something about this one just
Dean processes this. He wonders if Cas is telling the truth, if he was actually in less danger than he thought. Ultimately he figures that there’s no reason why Cas would be lying about that. Plus Cas doesn’t really seem to lie most of the time anyway, at least not directly. He’d be way more likely to just fly away if Dean asks something he doesn’t want to answer.
“The hell’s that s’posed to mean?” Dean snorts.
“Yeah, I was planning on it after lunch.”
“Do you regret it?” Dean whispers.
“What’s got your wings in a twist?”
” Dean scoffs.
from the times Jack has gotten indignant with him.
“Yeah. Yeah. Dean, I saw an angel,” Sammy insists.
Down on the factory floor, Gabriel and Jack are going to draw Lucifer to them and face him away from everyone else. Castiel feels ambivalent about his own positioning in this battle. On the one hand, Dean is in significantly less danger by not being in proximity to a fight between three archangels. On the other, his son and his brother are facing off against a vengeful and perturbed Lucifer, and that makes him nervous. Presumably Jack and Gabriel will be able to win that battle, but they’re extremely likely to be injured in the process.
“Sounds like you never ate pork made by someone who actually knows what a kitchen is,” Dean snorts. “You at least eat bacon, right? If you don’t like bacon we can’t be friends.”
“Alright, but why?” he wonders even as he does so.
Castiel has no need to take glimpses at Dean’s nightmares, because on occasion Dean has described them to him in vague terms. He simply removes them from Dean’s mind’s eye and replaces these awful images with much more pleasant things. Fishing. Sitting on his car watching the stars. Soothing and mundane ideas that enable Dean to wake up refreshed.
“I can’t say. You’re talented and chaotic, a number of teams will probably want you. There may be a spot for you here with us, I don’t know whose contracts are at what stages.”
“Huh?”
the one who stopped him from getting beat as a kid and apparently answered his prayers a few times even if he didn’t know he was making them. His best friend, his guardian angel, his… his.
Cas has more than earned it.
Well, Dean’s away from the corner now. Mostly because he’s storming outta the kitchen and then outta the house altogether. It ain’t the first time Cas has tried that, but Dean clearly won’t have it. Bobby’s getting sick of them both behaving this way and going by what Dean would call an epic bitchface Sam’s done with them, too. Something has to happen… and since Sam is also refusing to talk to Cas, that means Bobby’s the one who’s gonna have to make that something happen. As always.
“You got autism?”
Very importantly, Castiel has completed Dean’s nest. So tonight, instead of research, he’s taking some time to reflect. The process of winning over a prospective mate is more complicated when pursuing a human rather than an angel, but in truth Castiel has never taken any interest in doing so until now. He understands that he’s flawed, there’s something fundamental that was miswired during his creation, and this flawed part of him is what felt drawn to a desperately sad human with a beautifully luminous soul. Castiel is broken and Dean Winchester is exceptional. They’re so mismatched that by all logic there should be no common ground between them, and yet here they are.
“He’s warded, right?” Mary asks.
“Oh. Yes, that stands to reason.” Cas slowly sits upright, grimacing. “I reiterate - that was foolish of you. Don’t ever do it again.”
At least Sam manages to get them to the hotel in one piece. Dean struggles painfully to walk into the room and ignores whatever Sam’s doing because he just wants to lie down and sleep for a week straight.
Dean randomly remembers this weird thing Sam was rambling on about once when they were kids, how he read in a book about the way people make stained glass and blah-blah-blah, and to make blue glass they use cobalt. And Dean wonders if cobalt is actually blue or if it’s used to make the blue for the glass, but either way that’s what Cas’ eyes remind him of, blue stained glass in windows. Cas is just unreasonably pretty, especially his eyes. And these eyes are staring at Dean, but in a different kinda way from how Cas usually stares at things.
“Because I’m trying to help, there are programs available for family members of military personnel and we’re looking into whether any of them will benefit you.”
“Yeah, but it ain’t just us, we’re backing up Gabe and Jack. We can win this, Cas.”
“Please shoot me, it’d be less cruel.”
Is Gabriel still alive?
nicer…”
Dean looks back at Castiel: “That sound okay, Cas?”
“That was great, buddy,” he grins, slapping the winger’s shoulder pad.
“So what’s the protocol for that?” Sam asks.
but you weren’t ten seconds ago and you’re not supposed to sleep in here,” he chuckles. “I’m sure your mattress is much more comfortable in any case.”
“Y’know what, you can give me shit about this when you unfuck your own love life, Dean. Until then you’ve got no room to talk.”
“Awesome.” Dean nods. “Here, we’ll go grab dinner after we check in at the hotel, there’s this awesome barbecue place we can eat at.”
Sam leans around him slightly. “Cas, you ready? Gabriel thinks you guys might be running low on time at this point, you probably gotta go now.”
“I AM” Dean argues. “LISTEN” A pause. “I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS MORE LATER”
of them. But enough have caused rampant destruction that this policy was deemed necessary.”
“How can I find Gabriel?”
“On occasion. As I said, this phenomenon is… unusual. You have to understand, Nephilim are incredibly dangerous and often uncontrollable.”
“Sure, whatever. You want your wings better, I want the itching to stop. Win-win.”
Cas raises a trembling arm and lands his palm on Dean’s skin. “I recall your rant on the topic. That was me interfering, by the way. I think it helped attract the attention of Death.”
Castiel approaches, refusing to be hesitant. He knows his own tells. He’ll be able to react if Prior-Castiel attempts to kill him. Reaching out, he places both sets of fingertips on either side of Prior-Castiel’s vessel’s skull and extends a tendril of grace. It’s met with an identical tendril, his grace recognizes itself, there’s no conflict. And he pours his knowledge and regrets into the consciousness of himself from two years past.
Trigger warnings in endnotes.
“It was,” Gabriel nods, no longer looking at him. “It’s fine, I’ll knock it off.”
Cas actually fucking hugs him, now. Dean wants and doesn’t want at the same time to shove him and tell him to back off; in the end he just stands there and lets it happen, but he doesn’t hug back.
Someone knocks on the door frame and derails his train of thought - a staff badge. Cas doesn’t make eye contact, but looks in the general direction of this disruption. “Yes?”
sense?”
He nods and tosses away the can. “Alright, then.” Dean compulsively checks the magazine of his sidearm to make sure he’s loaded up with the bullets that Cas scribbled with Enochian angel-punching sigils even though he’s already looked like four times already.
“I can get some guys to agree. But after I meet your reporter. I should see in person, that she knows what she’s doing. You can speak to Victor. He might see the sense of this.” Crowley very suddenly transitions back to English for absolutely no reason. “Riddle me this, Boy Wonder. You’ve been here for a grand total of less than two months, why are you so inclined to stirring up mayhem? Surely you have better things to do with your time, wooing Dean Winchester for instance or perhaps convincing the team that you are in fact worthy of wearing an A despite being on the fourth line with a problem player and a brand-new rookie.”
“I think you were sleeping. Dean, the only person who has a problem with it is you.”
Naomi wonders, not for the first time, what exactly it is about him that Castiel finds so fascinating. He’s uppity and unpleasant and there’s nothing special about him at all.
