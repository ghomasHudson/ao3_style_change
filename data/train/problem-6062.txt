(There’s another kid in the orphanage who’s also named Steve, so the others call him by his last name instead.)
“Jarvis?” He yawns.
I don't want it. Take it away. I don't
again so that you can bitch and moan about how your Profs don’t understand your genius.”
And yet his Ma was doing fine for the both of them, working in the hospital as a nurse, helping where she could and being treated nicely for her hard work.
Steve had been lucky to have he received a high school education with the encouragement of his mother, and had gotten into college. Most Omegas, especially those from poor families, could only ever afford to go to government-mandated Omega schools for their education, which focused more on how Omegas were suppose to act rather than how they could.
Steve wonders if he’s been doomed from the beginning.
It’s a pleasant surprise when he does drink, the chocolate just short of scalding, warmth enough to stave off the slight chills of Fall. Not that Steve has felt truly cold, not since the serum, but he could imagine the comfort it would bring. He moans into the drink, taking in gulps, the little marshmallows are kind of like sugar cubes, he muses, popping sweetly in his mouth with little crunches. He’s suddenly sorry that he hadn’t added more.
“Shame. Would have loved to run a test on it.”
“Really?”
With some effort, he gets Clint to walk with him out of the bar, towards the sidewalk where his bike is parked. Course, Clint is muttering nonsense into his ear, to which he nods and entertains, keeps the conversation going so that Clint doesn’t fall asleep on him. The ride back shouldn’t take too long, they’re only a few blocks away, and he should be able to get them back before Clint nods off.
“Which part?” Because of course Clint would have the report to his screaming.
Steve pulls off of Tony’s cock, quick as lightning, shucks his shirt and shorts. He returns to kneeling, Tony pumping his cock viciously in one hand, angry-red and throbbing, the other keeping Steve’s head where he wants it. “Gonna come all over you, Sweetheart. And you’re going to want it. Right?” Because of course Tony would ask.
“Oh yes, gods Stevos, fuck me properly with your dick already.” He’s impatient, and he really wants to feel that cock stretch him out.
“One must first be a demi-god, of lineage to a god. And then. A great show of proof. An ultimate sacrifice.” Stevos says after a long time, his beautiful long fingers playing with the tumbler still in his hand.

He’s the new kid, most of the others just ignore him for now. He would prefer that over this though. It’s already hard enough making friends without them picking on him.
“Oh good, thank god. I just need to sit down real quick and catch my-”

“Well, all I would do is provide you with more personal information about the Alphas.” So he could pick more than a pretty face and a knot, good. “But, if you would prefer to do it alone, I could give you slides with appropriate information and you may ask questions later on.”
“Don’t talk about him like that.” Tony snaps, suddenly flaring. “You’re barely hurt, have some painkillers and sleep it off.”
Grateful, Steve places a hand on Tony’s torso, a quiet thank you, tracing the smooth planes of scars and muscle before speaking.
“Oh yeah?! What?” Steve growls right back, stands as well, makes up for height by glaring at Bucky and showing teeth. “It’s been
“Heya Tony, I was back in DC and I thought I should tell you. Uhm. I wanted to give back the phone you gave me, so if there’s a way I can send it back safely, do tell me. If you ever want to catch up, I’m free on weekends. Bye.”
And now, Steve’s not even sure if he should be touching Clint at this point. Contact has always been an Omega’s language, and the small space between them is Steve’s way of saying that it would be left for Clint to decide.
And the Alpha does, stretches right off him with narrowed eyes and confusion.
Sometimes though, he still gets trapped in his mind, where all he can smell is the blood in the air, taste the mud on his tongue, the grit of earth where he dives, the sound of bullets whizzing past. The
A job is good, better than him grumbling around town when Bucky’s out.

isn’t sure what had caused the outburst, but when it bubbles out, he can’t stop.
I feel the need to tell you all that this story is canon compliant, as I might have missed saying so. I wrote a particularly long comment on my view of Stony (at least in this fic) on chapter 4 if anyone else might be curious about it.
“Back so soon. Didn’t you say you were only considering part-time.” Says the female Beta, peering at him from over her papers.
“Push to start?” Alright, he understood half of what Tony had been saying about the bike, some better than most, but that was the most confusing phrase he has heard yet.
It’s been an hour since his last orgasm, the time between waves lengthening as the Heat went on. Steve blinks owlishly at Tony, a quick glance and then a nod as he buries himself back in the blankets.
It’s Steve’s turn to look confused.
“Would you like to talk about it?”

sounds when they fall to the bottom. He shakes them for good measure.
There’s something akin to a sob before Stevos moves his arms over his head, and it sends a ripple throughout muscles when he clenches on the arm rest of Tony’s couch.
He’d always been most finicky with faces. The way a person smiles, the droop of their frown, crinkle in their eye. Steve liked to play with the emotion, an insight to a person’s thoughts.
It’s just a guess, one that Steve can easily deny, then they can go back to shooting things, hopefully move away from this topic until he can read up on Google.

“You kiss dames that way?”
Pants go next, and yet there’s nothing sexual about it, the clingy bottom half of his undersuit peeled away and folded properly. He's got briefs on, which saves both of them from his nakedness for the time being. Already he can see a darkening bruise on his calf. It doesn’t hurt yet but he knows it’ll be a bitch to deal with in the morning.
“We’ve already compiled a short list of Alphas we think would be compatible for you, and if you think you’re up to it, we could go over the list.”
“Are you sure you can take a bath by yourself?”
Steve gulps, trying to find more words but fails to clutch them in his mind. So instead he bares his neck, a general sign of submission, and acceptance. “Good. Alpha.” He breathes, watching for Tony’s response.
“You will receive a knot, Omega, whether you like it or not. Andrew!” He barks, catching the younger Alpha’s attention. “Next time, when you feel yourself knotting, you push, even if the Onega might pull away. You grab them by the thigh if you must.” And Ed demonstrates by strongehandedly lifts Steve hips until his knees are off the bed, and fucks into him at the new angle.
The door opens again, making them both stop to look at the newcomer. Another Alpha. This one eyes him openly, grin on his cheeks that stretches all the way to his eyes. “What’ve we got here, Annie?”
Steve does this now, curling in on himself, ducking his head as he places a tenative hand on Tony’s wrist. It’s a small gesture, something taught in school to kids during his time, that meant ‘
The Ironman suit is larger than he thought it would be. It has to fit around Tony

Steve can still feel the scrutiny on him even after she leaves.
Nobody disses on engineering and gets away with it. Not in the Stark cave.” Tony pouts.
“You’re very welcome to offer assistance, Black Widow.” Steve supplies, checks the corner before they barrel past to the basement. “How’s security?”
be stuck in this block for my whole life.”
"Tony, please. I'm worried about you." Steve pleads.
Steve all but throws the note back on the desk and curls up in the sheets, embarrassed. It was one thing to rely on Tony for his Heat, and another altogether to be given a

“Hon. First rule around here, never give out your real name.” She says. “Saves you the dignity of being called out in public.” And up close, he can see the thick powder on her face, carefully pinked cheeks, and fakeness of her curls. Wonders how different she would look if she wasn’t so dolled up, but maybe that’s just the artist in him.
“Who the fuck are you?” Not Tony’s greatest moment.
Steve watches them, as they babble through their tears and anger.
of the arc reactor.
Natasha Romanoff eyes him speculatively, Clint Barton seems to prefer pretending he doesn’t exist at all, while Nick Fury tells him that the two are now assigned to get him up to speed on how things run on S.H.I.E.L.D.
“You made him go away after he smirked at me!”
Steve nods.
New York was a wake up call.
Through dirt roads, something country playing on the radio, Steve has trouble taking in the scenery. He fiddles with the necklace around his neck, the thought of Tony's condition worrying him. Would he find Tony hooked up to tubes and machines, struggling to keep him alive?
“Very well.” But even Stevos is breathless now, hovering on top of Tony as he lines up his cock and pushes.
“Pretty much.” Tony says with an uncaring shrugs, opening and closing his hands like a child, motioning for the shield.
Steve paws at Tony’s neck, motioning towards his scent glands.
“Upper, she said. No. She hasn’t been eating well.”
Steve did a few searches on them, and lately, it looked like they’d been slowly 'getting back together’, or so the media placed it. With the construction of Stark Tower, they seemed to be spending more and more time with one another. And Steve couldn’t deny that they just looked
“Roast?” Steve inquires, settling into the nest of pillows they’d decided to set up. Pillow fort, Clint had argued.
“Just needed a small word with Stark, nothing to be concerned about.” Fury says, as if he read Steve’s mind. “He’s expecting you inside.” With that, Fury claps him on the shoulder and takes his leave.
“His name is Lucius and he’s very fluffy.” Clint comments, rubbing Lucius under his chin.
“And that’s
The vision had come so vividly to him, and it had hurt more than the water forcing itself in his lungs and freezing over, the dread in those nightmares was nothing compared to the realization that he was dreaming, and that he had to wake up soon.
Tony regards him, a smirk on his lips. “It wasn’t. Do you even know what it’s made of?” Challenging. Playful. Steve can’t help but be strung along.
With every moment that passes, Stevos seems to have a harder time controlling himself, he’s already started grinding his hips against Tony’s, hands pulling him closer to rub their lengths through the cloth of their jeans.
Eventually they do, with Clint just slightly lower than Steve so that the blanket can cover the both of them, his head place precariously on his chest, and their arms on top of each other in a half-hug, while their knees bump against one another.
Tony hands him a thick manila envelope in the car. He’d driven him in some ridiculously expensive car, insisting that Happy was out on an errand for Pepper so there really was no one to drive him. Tony had stopped short of the jet, parked just a few feet from them.
A whine escapes Steve throat, Tony smirks at him for it and then chuckles.
“You had prayed, and thus I have come.” Stevos laughs, like one would at the innocence of a child.
The Agent (Phil) doesn’t exactly chase after him, a tight frown as he watches Clint take off, but Steve notices the little twitch in his body that might have meant he would have gone on after Clint if something weren’t keeping him here. So instead, he’s met with a steel-gray eyes of the Beta, looking as though he can barely contain his excitement.
They take him in as a second thought, always referring first to Tony before they even look at him. Which Steve understands. Tony is the Alpha, and right now he’s an extension of Tony’s persona. As a sign of respect, they acknowledge the Alpha first before his Omega. It doesn’t exactly bother Steve, in fact, he’s more than ready to cede attention to Tony than take it from him. As it is, he’s not exactly expected to participate in the conversation, which suits him just fine.
“Making a friend?” He pipes up, raising a brow at Clint.
Straight at it then.
"I'm so happy you're alive." He whispers, lets the pain and heartbreak seep into his words before he lets go and leaves.
“So the shield was in fact from Wakanda, not something developed by the military or Howard.”
“Of course you say ‘swell’.” Tony rolls his eyes, but looks proud of the compliment regardless. “And complain all you want. JARVIS designed that phone, he could use some feedback from fresh eyes.”
“I’ll see the both of you back at base. Shouldn’t be more than a week at most.” He continues on, after a brief apology as to why there was suddenly a chaffeur in front of their AirBnB. Of course, Natasha had alerted them both of it’s arrival, ready to shoot if anything got too suspicious but Steve was quick to clear the air before Natasha could pursue.
Steve could imagine a smaller, ruffled tony, screaming at a rubberducky and tossing it out a window, and can’t help but smile.
Finally, the dirt road curves and Steve is treated to a huge cabin, if he could even call it that. It was made of wood, that was for sure, but where Steve was used to cabin looking sturdy, relatively simple, the sight was anything but.
he understanda but not really. “Have it your way, I will see you soon enough.” He tips his head to Steve and walks off, past the set of doors that Steve knows leads to the lobby.
“Steve, I couldn’t give less of a damn even if you broke his jaw, whatever that asshole did, he deserved it if it was coming from you.”
“Actually I had JARVIS do it, but I made him so.” Tony looks smug.
Tony’s narrows a glare at him, studying him for
Natasha settled back onto his bed, helping herself to some popcorn Clint brought along.
“Eventually.” Tony grumbles. “But you’re all drugged up and incoherent. Don’t tell me otherwise.” He adds when Steve tries to disagree with him, placing a finger on his lips. “So let’s just be shush while we can okay?”
Tony stares at him when he releases him, a soft smile, a shake of his head. “You always surprise me.”
Tony makes a motion to leave, but Stevos grabs his arm. It’s not enough to keep him there, and Tony considers just leaving anyway. But some part of him carries the guilt of his actions, the part that hasn’t been eaten away by bitterness suggests that he stay with Stevos, as a repentance.
, something he'd wished to be his whole life. Stronger body, indeed.
Except.
Quiet steps, Tony stares at his own creation. “Mark 1. Where it all started.” There’s defeat in his voice, the kind that Steve has heard from men with regret in their hearts. “Abysmal efficiency, drained my one good battery within twenty minutes. The casing is mostly steel, iron for bolts, too heavy for controlled flight, eventually it will rust with the condensation from higher altitudes. Weapons are… Well there’s a machine gun and not much else. Not to mention it’s a pain to put on, every latch has to be clipped manually and sometimes it doesn’t even lock.”
He’s still unsure when Nick Fury brings along two agent in tow the very next day. Natasha Romanoff, codenamed Black Widow, and Clint Barton, codenamed Hawkeye.
“The flight’s about-” Happy checks his watch. “Five hours if we’re lucky. Just in time for dinner. As soon as the crew is down with pre-flight, then we’re out of here.” Sensing Steve’s discomfort, but plainly not knowing what to do with it, motions towards the back of the plane.
“You could have warned me.” Was his dry retort. He would liked it much better if he knew that the shield wasn’t going to hit him on the face.
“Oh Pep! Meet Steve, he’s my date for Saturday!” Tony says enthusiastically.
“Sir has performed several upgrades to the estate, which includes bioscans within entry ways.” Comes the crisp reply.
It’s with shame when he takes Ed’s card and pockets it, an address and number, that will haunt his drawer until he can’t ignore it anymore, or until his heat comes along and option is there. Because, as much as it would hurt his pride, going through a Heat without an Alpha was still something he wanted to avoid.
##########
“I don’t understand what it is you want from me. You have Pepper and- I can’t be a secondary Omega, I just can’t. It wasn’t how I was raised. It might be alright with you, since you’re a High-level Alpha, and the law says you can claim two Omegas, no one would bat an eye. But that’s not me, I wouldn’t know how to do that.” His voice quivers, fingers worrying over the cup, and still Tony says nothing. He doesn’t know how he could possibly compete with Pepper.
Steve wasn’t built for that kind of thing, he’d never known how to handle that kind of attention.
“No! Stay here, think about your wife and children.” Tony pleads.
Holy shit, it's been almost two months since the last update. I swear like half of this was written in a week, and the rest has been pitter-pattering for days. It's longer than usual, but don't let the length fool you. Thank you to everyone who's still keeping with the updates, I know I suck at keeping to a schedule but I swear I love you all for leaving kudos and comments throughout the weeks.
“Must be some friend. That thing costs as arm and a leg! Uhm. If you don’t mind. Can I check it’s production code? It should be on the back panel, just under the battery.
Tony snarls at him, and Steve breaks eye contact. He knows he can take him, wrestle him to the ground if necessary, but this was Tony, the least Steve could do was try. So even when Tony presses his face to Steve’s neck without permission, Steve lets him, remains pliant while the Alpha performs his check on him. He can’t imagine what Tony would be like if he had brought his shield.
Steve lets out a shaky breath and flutters his lashes, twice.
“Why else would you?” There’s almost relief, perhaps to thinking he was right. “You wish to show me that I am not as powerful as I might appear. You wish to, as you mortals, say 'knock me down a peg’.” Stevos frown only deepens. “But it will not work, I am neither stronger or weaker in this form, nor any other form. It matters very little of what I look like.”
“No, maam. It’s fine as it is. I’m still going to be participatin’ part-time.” Even if he knows it pays less, at least he can come and go as he pleases.
His own Ironman suit is dented in more places than one, and it’s a pain to remove each and every plate from his body. Bruises blossom from his skin, no doubt they will be worse in the morning. He shuts down the lab and clambers into his bedroom.
He’d only ever gone feral once before, also during his Heat when it hit him the hardest. It was momentary lapse of mind, forcing its victim into the most basic of senses, affecting both Alpha and Omega alike, usually triggered by some chemical reaction in the body of varying degree. Betas were saved from it, but only because they weren’t so affected by hormones.
As soon as Thor disappears with Loki, Steve double checks everything on his bike. He averts his attention from Clint and Natasha, as it looks like Natasha is giving Clint an earful for the lack of notice.
“If you call for me, I will hear it.” Is all Stevos says, which isn’t a yes, but isn’t a no as well, and Tony let’s that be.
, must have embarrassed himself so much he shut up.”
JARVIS is apparently an AI (A really smart computer person?) and is in charge of the house and overall security. He had a feeling that there was more to it, but didn’t press, still amazed with everything around him.
“You come in with empty pockets, go out with a bit of padding and a little out of breath, what’s so different?” She laughs, clearly a regular around here if she feels so comfortable about it. A manicured hand is thrust in his direction, which he takes in good nature. “Starla.”
Steve presses his body to Clint, he can smell the fresh wave of panic and surprise, gathers him in his arms. “I know, okay? I can smell it on you.”
“This is where you’ll claim me?”
Andrew isn’t any bigger than Ed, but he fucks Steve will newfoud energy, thrusting enthusiastically into him, the wet slap of skin on skin suddenly sounding more erotic. “Oh God… Shit. This is better than his mouth. Wetter too.”
Stevos laughs, and clothes shimmer until they’re gone. Tony’s treated to the sight of those muscles, every beautiful curve of Stevos’s body exposed to him like a lover.
because this was the only way he knew to make chocolate himself.
Tony looks almost proud. “No, of course not. It’s a fantasy, your submission to me. I know it's already a gift when you were in heat, damn sassy and demanding.” He smiles fondly at the memory.
A high-level Alpha could in fact be entitled to two Omegas or more in certain cultures, provided that the Alpha could provide for them both. A scrap of information Steve had thought irrelevant, but now shed some light to the situation.
“Will you-”
Clint shakes his head.
It was a rare moment where he’d caught Clint napping, head pushed up to curl towards his torso, hands crossed over his chest, hanging precariously on the rafters.
“Sixties cartoons reference, sorry, just geeking out a little because
There’s a poised moment where Tony blinks and stares at Steve, as if weighing the options that Brock has presented. “Uh, no. He stays.” A note of finality, eyes pointedly looking at Brock as if in challenge.
, Clint.”
Except. Stevos is the very reason for his frustration, perfectly perfect in spite of Tony’s injuries. While the god lays there, golden-skinned and ripped beyond all measure, Tony has to deal with the
Steve already knew that SHIELD kept its eyes on him, and Fury was especially interested in his personal being for multiple reasons. He just didn’t think that Tony would resort to the same thing. Thought that the alpha knew at least when to let him be and trust that Steve could take care of himself.
Slow as molasses, he sheds Tony of his pants, pulled down just his thighs to reveal his cock because of course Tony wouldn’t have bothered to have underwear on, not in his own home. Nor, if Steve were to guess, while a wanted Omega was so close by.
, you mean.”
“You’re very sweet. Too sweet. I can’t imagine where he might have picked you up. Tony’s not very good at separating business from pleasure. ” There’s biting realization when it clicks into place, the implications Pepper was pushing forth. It wasn’t odd, he should have expected something like this to happen, the stranger that he was. A week of heat wasn’t going to change that.
Steve knows they’ll both get in trouble if the nuns catch them, but it makes him feel better when Bucky’s around so he just keeps quiet about it.
He wasn’t really all that drunk, he could remember what that felt like when he was tiny, and he was nowhere near his limit. He did feel warmer than usual, a little sluggish, but that was it.
Omega was suppose to go through. And then he was off touring the country and selling war bonds, shortly after sent (escaped) into the field. “There was a war, Tony. I couldn’t just-”
“That is actually… a good compromise.” Pepper admits, looking pointedly at Tony.
There’s no wind, no sound, no indication that something has arrived. Like all the previous times, there’s simply arms around him, strong and sure. It’s near instinctive when he grasps at Stevos’s arm.
“Looks like I am up.” He smiles, and gets on his feet. “See you two some other time then.” And he pushes right on through.
“Do you have plans for after?”
It’s days of going undercover, of following targets, rumors and acting as bait before they have an address for where most of the Omegas are being kept. But that wasn’t enough, they needed names and locations. It wasn’t hard to figure out that the Omegas were being moved across country, to different mating blocks under different credentials.
“I counted four times the smoke alarms set off, Tony.”
That made it all the more interesting.
“You shouldn’t have to. You shouldn’t have to deal with
Tony just looks at his hand and shrugs. “So how do we do this? Do I get him now or-?”
“Barely touched it.” He mutters but he grins when Tony sulks at him.
“Okay.” Tony says simply, hand finding its way to Steve’s hair, gently massaging. “Thank you.”
a slithery voice whispered to his ear.
“Yes.” Stevos quietly, breaking Tony from his thoughts.
Apparently not, not with the way he stares at the Omegas on display.
“Okay, fuck, sorry. I got a little carried away there.” Clint rubs his eyes with the back of his hand, very quickly turning away from Steve and falling back in bed.
Steve doesn't miss the fact that, among the clothes and things that Clint packed, there was still that dark box that held his bow and arrow. Made sense though, he’d brought his shield along too, in a large square pack that seemed like half a disguise. Of course, it was blaringly obvious what it was to those who knew, but looked innocent enough.
Simply put, an Alpha and Omega react to each other in a very specific way, because their bodies emit hormones that trigger one another in close proximity. A common way for these hormones to travel was by scent. Each scent was unique to the individual and triggers different reaction to the body, but inherently they all had similar properties. The mere presence of an Omega would be enough to call up a reaction of some kind. It was why, even though Alpha and Beta pairs could consummate, a knot would not form without the specific hormone from the Omega.
Just like that, Tony shrugs it off and heads for exit. Hesitantly, Steve places the copy of his shield onto a bare space and follows suit.
(The other Commandos would goad him for a drink when they could spare the time, severely disappointed that he couldn’t get drunk but then later rejoiced when it meant he could carry anyone who had passed out back to their camp with ease.)
“If it is alright, might you see to Sir at meeting room A. He is having difficulty with returning to his room.”
“And if I don’t want it slow? If I want it fast and hard?” Steve challenges, brutally kissing Tony’s lips until they both taste blood.
“First time, Hon?” One of the Omegas says, a smile on her painted lips. “No need to be so scared. In here, we’re all just co-workers, aren’t we?”
“Of course they’re perfect.” Tony snorts. “My engineering is always perfect, and my math is never wrong.”
“You, Steve Rogers, are as devious as they come.”
The pair glanced at one another, and then one of them nods, and walks off, leaving only one by the door.
to his stay there so long as he had a bodyguard of Howard’s choice to live with him.
“I’ll introduce the two of you in the lab along with the rest of the family.”
Tony sighs. “Yes. They probably did. But you’re sweating out all the pheremones they must have pumped into you. And it’s very distracting. So I’d like it if you could wash it off.”
“-spoke her- I don’t believe you.” He sneers, throws a hand in the air aggressively, wrinkling the sleeve of the
The chain on his neck feels almost weightless in his daze, remarkably cool on Steve’s heated skin. Steve feels hot, too hot, like his insides were set on fire and a deep seated hunger that comes with his Heat. He whines and bucks under Tony’s hand, impatient as his body demands
“B-But, why? Ma, p-please. I’ll be g-good, I p-p-promise. Please d-d-don’t let them t-t-t-take m-me away.” He stammers, fighting back the hiccups and tears that stream down his face, clutching at his Ma’s dress as insistent hands grip his shoulders, trying to pull him away.
“Anyway, wouldn’t be a good much. I’m too much for him to handle. I’d drive him mad after three days!”
had a hand for authenticity but I made a lot of suggestions.”
Steve isn't sure how to answer that, remains silent and simply enjoys the closeness he feels with Tony during the moment.
, even if he did only believe in one God, he can’t deny that both Loki and Thor aren’t from their world.
Steve might have spilled some hot chocolate on it just this morning, and he pales at that.
Frank looks over him, their arms pressed together as they walk. “It’s not that.” A thoughtful pause, a recollection of thoughts. “You’re not helpless, anyone who’s known you for five minutes would know that.”
Tony huffs at him. “So now you’re suddenly listening to her? When she’s taking your side? Great job, Dad, I’m sure she almost-”
“Vibranium.”

With that and a nod, Jasper leads him down through a hall, into another lobby with plush couches. It’s quiet, entirely private, and Jasper excuses himself. “Do make yourself comfortable, Mr. Stark. I just have a call to make about preparations.” The Beta scurries off.
, hangs in the air, but Tony isn’t that morbidly curious.
But the Alpha had been kind, the amount that was unmistakable, so Steve rolls to his back, belly shown, that much was a offering, looks up at Ed, waiting for him.
if he gets a fuzzy feeling in his gut when he sees that Tony is calling. Jitters, he thinks, but he smiles every time anyway.
“This doesn’t mean I believe you’re Captain America.”
“Was expecting something different, is all.” He can’t find it himself to say
"You stopped texting me after a couple of days. I thought. Oh I don't know, that what we had in your mind was just something out of Heat." Tony looks disgruntled. "It was fine afterwards you know, so I'm all fine with that. It worked out well enough and we're talking again now but I was always curious as to the
“Aha!” Comes the triumphant yell, holding up what looked like a watch. The same watch he’d been working on the night before. “Here. Put it on.”
“Stark. As in?”
“Sassy little bitch, aren’t you.” Tony slurs, eyes blown wide that Steve is both irritated and awed by the man’s self-control.
on his phone.
Jasper motions for him to follow, so Tony does, still a little confused with it all, as they walk through yet another part of The Gallery.
He spits on his own hand, gives himself a hungry stroke, cock jumping in his hand, and shoves himself right into Stevos. He pushes and pushes, the head of his cock popping into Stevos’s hot heat and he fucks into him is short sharp thrusts until he’s all the way to his base.
He’s busy. Busy is good. Busy means that he doesn’t have to think about the absence of a certain god. Busy means he’s down in the lab, roused only for required meetings, and is otherwise unavailable to the world. Busy means his mind can focus on several things and pointedly ignore one.
Instead, he takes a breath, let the anger and frustration die down before he opens his mouth.
“A friend gave it to me.” Is all he answers. It’s a sharp reminder of Tony, a man he’s been trying to get out of his mind every since they’d parted ways a couple of months ago.
There are forms to fill, but most of them merely need his signature for authentication sake. He has no doubt that no one will ever really see the contents of the contract, not while S.H.I.E.L.D. could help it. A thing to be grateful for.
Natasha looks extremely serious about her question.
God, what Tony would do for a burger.
“Oh, I uh. I couldn’t wear the necklace all the time. On missions. Nervous I might lose it. Didn’t want to lose it.” Steve fumbles, feeling almost naked now that he was under scrutiny.
Tony’s head whips towards him, eyes manic in their energy, teeth bared in display.
He’s warm and lazy, listens to the quiet
Steve smells him before he even enters the room.
So the day that Steve is to meet Tony Stark, it weighs heavily on his mind. He wasn’t sure if Scenting was done back in his day, though they probably didn’t call it that even if it did. It was as easy as getting close to an Alpha and feeling a little
“Nothing at all, sir. What can I do you for?”
“Sometimes, I don’t know if I’m still me.” Clint confesses on one quiet night. He’d allowed Steve to maneuver them on the bed and cover them in blankets. Steve positioned himself behind Clint, an arm on his chest to hold him close, protective.
Fury’s staring directly at Steve. And now so are Black Widow and Hawkeye, though they hide their surprise well under stoic gazes. It’s as if they are expecting him to suddenly take charge, say his part and be honored by the information.
The god had come visit as he had promised, around almost every other night. They talk, mostly, carefully skirting around more ominous topics and instead focus on lighter subjects. When Tony had asked if it was possible that Stevos be visible to others, the god merely smiled. Which made a blare of alarm as JARVIS informed him of the intruder. The bots also freaked out, Dummy rolled off into a corner, and U tried to spray Stevos with the fire.extinguisher. Needless to say, it caused quite a mess, and Stevos was incredibly apologetic about it. Which leads to second thing that they do.
“If you’re sure. Just. Yell if you need anything.” And Tony leaves him.
“Oh, they would have gotten so distracted by the way you would smell, happy and aroused. They’d be so fucking jealous of the beautiful Omega on my lap, unable to touch. Only look.”
The frustration and nervousness ramps up, until one day, he’s yelling at his psychiatrist, his chest shaking as words spew from his mouth, his fears, his confessions. Even
“Thanks Clint.”
But, just like always, Stevos catches him before he falls, cradles him in large arms and hot skin. He’s huge again, covered in muscle and overbearing but maybe that’s what Tony needs.
Steve hopes it’s dark enough to hide his blush. “Sort of. We’ve talk about it sometimes.”
Steve’s fingers find purchase on Tony’s shirt again. “Off, take it off,
After the fourth miss, Hawkeye calling out each shot, Steve feels a tap on his shoulder, signalling him to stop.
Tony makes a triumphant sound, finally taking out a tool that Steve perceives as a drill, and grins at him. Which doesn’t really alleviate his worry.
“Oh, I don’t know.” Tony says. “A kiss on the cheek? Flutter those pretty blues for me? One flutter for 'Get this creep off me’, two flutters for 'Let’s got out of here’?
“Tonight?” He blathers. “Oh. But we have to make sure he is thoroughly cleaned and groomed to your liking, wouldn’t want to-”
“Push your shirt up.”
Tony looks wrecked, a twitch in his mouth as he falls forward to drape his body over Steve’s, running his hands over Steve’s abs and pecs, the cool touch almost surprising to the Omega, like he was still trying to determine whether he was real. “Captain America is a fucking a tease.” He mutters under his breath, like a realization, amusement in his voice as his face goes through a multitude of emotions, that Steve barely catches, until he settles to fondness.
“Can I lead you to your room, Tony?” Steve tries again.
But oh, imagination can only take Tony so far. Human, is the keyword to it all. Politely human, that is the extent of Tony’s imagination. He has had his fair eyeful of perfectly built male specimens, and has had the absolute pleasure of playing with them as well.
“That should be kind of impossible.”
“Of Stark Industries. Founded by Howard Stark, now owned by Anthony Stark, his son. They started as a weapons and defense company. For a long time, they were the leading manufacturer of guns, bombs, ammunition and weapons of mass destruction.”
“So, you decided to torture Dummy instead.”
“So. Captain America, I presume?”
The last few hours have been exhausting, he feels like he’s been fighting for days, as compared to the actual hours. Steve’s stopped bleeding while they had eaten shawarma, but he knows that Natasha took a bad stab from the Chitauri, Clint still has been of glass embedded in his bicep, and Tony has a concussion at the very least.
Tony doesn’t follow him back to his room, Steve hadn’t thought he would. This was still a contract arrangement, even if emotions did run high during heat, there was a very obvious line when it came to heat-induced sex. Steve still believed that Tony genuinely cared for him, but he wasn’t going to hold anything Tony’s had said or done during the heat over his head. Not to mention Tony had already done so much for him.
“You’re going to claim me, aren’t you?” Steve interrupts when he realizes where they are. Bedroom. Dark. Curtained. Private. Doesn’t smell quite as strongly of the Alpha but Steve notes the scent of new sheets and detergent.
“You’re not bad at listening. Just… Better at talking.”
. He smiles. “Yes.”
“In an hour.”
When Tony quiets down, he looks up at Steve, realization in his eyes. “Thanks. For you, y’know, this?”
“Go to the meeting, Tony, it’s just for the morning, right?”
Tony kisses him as he comes, ravages Stevos’s mouth as Stevos’s body turns taut with arousal, Tony pumping the god’s cock with one hand while the other grips Stevos’s hair to make sure he doesn’t move. He pulses with his orgasm, coming deep inside Stevos, punctuating each wave of cum with a quick snap of hips until even Stevos is coming, clenching fast and hard around his cock, making him shiver and writhe with overstimulation.
Alpha, and Obie puts his hand on Tony’s shoulder again. “What your father is trying to say is, we’ll keep trying until you find yourself a perfect match.” He pats his back affectionately, but it only serves to irritate Tony. “One you’ll like. After all, their life will be tied to yours, until the day they die. You could always sell it to someone else, but you can never
.” Tony motions with his hands, just coming off short from slamming his hand on the table.
“Great, I’ll meet your guys up front. Car’s up with the valet.”
The glass gives way, but then water comes pouring forth, icy cold and unforgiving, forcing it's way into his mouth, blurring his sight. He tries to fight against it, tries to push back but his limbs feel like lead, against the roaring tide.
He sighs while he strokes him, spreading his legs to reach down further, rubbing up and down his shaft as it thickens with memory. The heat. More than a year has passed but it’s still largely arousing on Steve’s part. How many times had he clung to those moments to get off before he slept? An embarrassing amount of times, so much so that it’s become close to second nature to recall it.
Steve’s wet when Tony’s fingers make way to his entrance, teasing the rim with his thumb, pushing in a finger that easily slips in. Gasping, Steve responds in kind by kneading his hands on Tony’s ass, pulling him closer.
He jets back home after another round of insistent questioning from Rhodey, mostly his friend wanted to make sure he was alright but Tony isn’t known for straight answers when it came to his health. It didn’t help that Rhodey still doesn’t know about how he almost killed himself with palladium poisoning, and then prevented it with his dad’s notes from years ago. That story would have to come after a round of stiff drinks.
“C’mon c’mon, I gotta pet half of them at least.” Clint said excitedly on a particular occasion where there was a small event for a dog adoption campaign, almost like a kid as he bounced on the balls of his feet, impatiently waiting for Steve to grab some cash.
Steve’s mouth dries.
“Taking an interest, son?” Howard barks, laughs as he pulls Tony back down to his seat. Tony hadn’t even realized he’d gotten up, his thoughts were focused on getting a better look of the Omega.
“You don’t? You didn’t mean?” Clint’s face turns into a scowl. “Someday, Steve. You, me, Nat. Movie marathon back at base. Action, suspense, tears! We’ll get a projector and everything, barf up popcorn, chocolate bars and candy.”
“Need me to call someone? An ambulance? Paramedics? Happy? Pepper?”
Sometimes, they don’t spend the day together, and Steve wanders on his own, while Clint does whatever it is Clint does by himself.
things to you, and you let me think that I was alone in it.”
Tony nearly flinches at his voice, looking very much like a kid who got caught with hand in the cookie jar.
Steve nods slowly. He doesn’t understand the implications of it.
“Julia, you must tell me where you picked up those lovely hydrangeas featured in your resort villa!”
They stare at each other.
The car ride is quiet, Tony’s staring out the window, his posture stiff and scent neutral.
It was all very rooted in tradition, but Tony didn’t have much interest in it. He was a forward thinker, orientation has never given him advantage in the field of science and machines. Sure, he was still a college student, but he’s passed two patents already for his work in Artificial Intelligence, pending a third in assistive robot technology, but he liked to think that instinct and hindbrain thought were behind him.
There’s a beat of silence, before Steve starts moving, peeling off the shirt, folds it very slowly, and carefully sets it on the counter. He moves to unbutton his pants, but then freezes, and stares weakly at Tony.
“So? You’ve done a great job so far, I’m still safe, aren’t I? And you’re only doing this to scare off Steve.” He waves at the still-staring Omega. Though, if he’s staring because of the way Brock phrases it, or if he’s still seeing rainbows and butterflies because of the drugs, Tony’s not sure. “Anyway, I assume the condo is safe?”
“And compassion.” Stevos adds.
“It’s a small detail, no really, I’ve been thinking about changing the floor anyway, this one isn’t even reinforced to take the Ironman suit. Actually, in hindsight, I could have at least brought one that would be a match for you.” Tony goes off. “Clearly something has upset you enough to belay your usual good manners and decide to make me rethink about my poor choice of cars.”
##########
that much was undeniably clear, to hide that body behind any article of clothing would be a sin to nature itself. Muscle over layer of muscle, biceps bulging as the Omega flinches from the unveil, the light must be blinding him, crystal blue eyes blinking rapidly, adjusting. Soft-looking blonde hair frames his face, falls just past his ears, shorter than what most Omegas would wear, but nonetheless attractive in that wild sort of way.
It’s where he’d left it, in the little lockbox that their room had. Clint had told him that the box was a scam for most part, an easy way for would-be theives to know where exactly guests have stowed away their valuables. But Steve hadn’t wanted to bring his phone with him to the mission, feeling antsy about just leaving it around.
There’s a pause, and then the blonde turns his head at him. Hazy blue-eyes look at him, pink lips pouting. “Steve. I-” He frowns. “My Ma named me Steven.”
“It wouldn’t be a waste.” Bucky snarls. “You’re worth so much more than some goddamn paper. Don’t you get that?”
Tony’s not sure how long he stands there, staring at the tiny god. It could be five minutes, it could be fifty, but it’s long enough that Stevos squirms awake, nudges the blankets out of the way with spindly limbs. The little god blinks awake and offers a smile. Only to be alert and worried the next at the sight of Tony’s expression.
Steve chuckles at the two as they commence some kind of secret message in glares. They remind him of himself and Bucky when they were kids, telling each other how it was, having each other’s backs, except deadlier.
Steve knows he shouldn’t expect anything. He doesn’t want to bother Tony, not after he finds about his big project for the arc reactor, and he doesn’t bother with texts, not after the first few days, lets the chatter whittle away until the silence feels comfortable enough.
Steve can tell that she has a problem with him. Her expression gives her away. Underneath the makeup, he can still read the lines of hidden anxiety. Not to mention the smell of caution. “Tony’s very lucky to have someone like you worry for him.”
“That was when we were young and stupid, Cara.”
, is the word Steve would prefer to use but decides not to.
The heaviness in his chest overthrown only by the need to get out of his skin, so desperate an emotion to claw out. The anger that demands attention.
“Condoms?”
“The ice,” Steve continues, swallowing as he feels the shards pierce his skin. “the plane crashed, then there was water and I was drowning.” He hadn't expected to survive. Frankly, he doesn't know how to talk about it. His dreams are vivid but they aren't what had happened.
When he doesn’t give so much as a sign of agreement, Fury relents.
“That’s it?” Clint protests, deflates in his arms.
“A small elite group for international incidents.”
No way was he facing this miserable onslaught alone.
“That’s why, I can’t just
Steve feels so exhausted, but he forces himself up, uses the bathroom to clean himself, wiping between his legs, washing his face, gargles his mouth even if the taste of cock won’t go away until he properly brushes. He's shaking and shivering afterwards, the towels too thin to be much help, but it’s a neccesity, and he shuffles around for his clothes to go home.
“Of course.”
“Uhm.”
The team,
“Is that so? Me and my boys just want a good night ourselves, and I think this would do just the thing.” He runs a hand over the bike’s seat. “C’mon. Couple of faggots like you don’t deserve something as nice as this.” The man makes a point to say, a slimy smile on his face.
The god doesn’t say a word, but pulls back so that Tony is treated to the sight of the gods entire body. Stevos hoists up Tony’s leg and settles it to rest on his shoulder, the starts maddening pace.
“A little.” He admits, looking away.
Small warehouse. Seized boats on the pier. The struggling Omegas. He submits himself to the process and tries to be as unbiased as he could with the report. Purely professional. He doesn’t let the anger of the bust pour through. The report would be used by whoever needed it, so he gave as much of the facts as he could. The size of the operation had been relatively small, but that only made them conclude that this was but a small branch in the scheme. That there were probably hundreds of these low-level smugglers scattered around.
“No, stay down there, help the civilians evacuate, I got this handled.”
He blinks, peering at Tony with half-open eyes. “Hmm? Yes?” He hums.
They pull apart with matching smiles. Steve turns to Phil and shakes his hand, the agent wearing a conservative smile.
In the end, Steve comes first, and then sucks Tony off in what he hopes to be a good effort. He thinks he did well, if Tony’s swearing is to be any indication.
“Nothing wrong with that sugarplum. Now excuse me, I have a pirate to talk to.”
“The way my uncle and brother treated you wasn't right. It wasn’t right. The way I-”
Tony’s hands roam his body, brisk and checking, a huff at every crevice as the Alpha inspects him thoroughly. Steve keeps his breathing calm even when Tony’s hand reaches his cock, pauses at the mound of flesh before sliding down to his thigh, wriggling into the space between his ass.
“You ever do something you really don’t like, but you gotta cos you have to?” Clint asks, breaking the silence.
Steve takes a couple bites of the food that Frank has ordered for the both of them, out of politeness, before he crosses his utensil and looks pointedly at the Alpha. “I’m not coming home with you to fuck.”
“Like you did with me.”
“If you have any complaints about the phone, tell them to JARVIS.”
When Stevos finally strokes his cock, it’s a dam breaking apart. Tony shakes withe force of his orgasm, cock shooting spurts of cum all over his chest, wet and utterly satisfied.
“May I come in?”
“Congratulations on your first Omega, Mr. Stark.” He offers a hand to shake.
So this is like a half-chapter, since I didn't have as much time to write this week because of another fic I'm doing (It's also Stony if anyone wants to check it out), and also because I have to rewatch a few movies for reference, so I present this bonus chapter instead.
.” Tony smiles that tiny boyish smile, full of wonderment. “
Except tonight, it was different.
Also, as a forewarning, the 'sex' part of this chapter contains dubcon for Steve. If you'd rather skip it, when Steve starts taking his clothes off, you might as well skip it.
Bucky and Frank had already gone off to basic training when his heat settled in, so he had to take his chances with a stranger. Wasn’t the first time and the little bit of money he got after was some consolation at least.
“Would you look at that, two for each of us, Captain.”
It takes time, but eventually he gets the details just right.
Enjoy the chapter.
“Sir is currently fine. He is resting as of the moment.”
“I really am sorry.”
It’s only a few short minutes of being kept on a knot, but Steve slumps on the bed, closes his eyes. The shame of being knotted sits tight in his chest.
Steve’s bites his lip, drops into a chair. “Is he really okay?”
“What?” Huh? Steve blinks from his daze.
“Sorry, should have warned you about that. Wouldn’t want it to go loose while in action.” Tony sounds not very apologetic at all. “Anyway, stretch out your fingers, let it recalculate.”
“What’s going on here?” Ernie, his co-worker, says as he comes back from a quick smoke out back. “This guy bothering you, Steve?” Ernie frowns.
“I don’t know about
It’s the last wave of Heat. It’s nothing out of the ordinary, feels just like all the rest, the desperation seeps out of him in volume, and his skins is on fire despite Tony’s touches.
Bucky always did say he was his own worst enemy.
to bend over for every Alpha?
He laughs when Tony slaps his ass appreciatively, a shudder running through his body as the high of orgasm ebbs away from his body. His Heat would end soon, the hormones would remain for a few more hours but he was free from the thick of things at least.
Except his cock is still fully hard, probably has been ever since he’d sniffed out that Alpha. Tony, his mind supplies. Dark hair, dark eyes, and a strange Alpha to be sure, though Steve can’t put his finger on why. He doesn’t want to think too much on it, firmly focused on washing himself.
Hawkeye finally acknowledges him with a tight-lipped nod, obviously not excited about the idea, but has the bearings of a man who knows better than the disobey direct orders.
“No.” Steve breathes, the laughter taking away the breath in his lungs. “You broke Steve Rogers, U.S. citizen.”
He lets out a breath he didn’t know he’s been holding, and flinches when the arousal melts its way down his spine, feels the wetness between his thighs.
He’d dismissed the pain in his chest, the tiny flairs that stutters to an ache, thinking it was just the shrapnel wiggling around in his chest, or ghost pains from the nightmares.
A little bit late, but it's still sunday so I made it. Stuff came up, emotional stuff, so that's whatever. Also I went to see TMNT and Warcraft, had some ideas for maybe one-shots or shorts. Maybe you guys want me to fill a few prompts? Idk, comment below.
“The most sophisticated power source on the planet!”
to him, the quick change of Omegas. But then he recalls the fond smile on Marlow’s face, the open adoration for Cara, even while she considered Steve as her next conquest. A love so plain that even he, a stranger, noticed.
“You jumped back ten feet!” Steve suddenly realizes, Tony farther off than he had be a moment ago.
Natasha has that part covered, already in the control room of the building, retrieving locations and names from their database and forwards it to SHIELD for immediate operation. Steve has no doubt Brock will be taking one of those location, with his pack system and Omega on the team, it would be difficult not to feel disgusted.
“You too Steve. Mr. Stark’s a little rough around the edges, but you’ll get used to him.” It was the only sort-of bad thing he’s said about Tony all day.
Hello.
“I know. I just thought I should remind you that I can take care of myself, even from jerks like Hammer.”
“Plus, if your psychiatrist ever starts asking stupid questions again.” Clint makes a slicing movement below his neck and then winks.
Steve blinks. He's sure his mouth is agape. It was the last thing on his mind right now, worried to hell about how Tony was doing and his condition. At the same time he felt as if he'd gone deaf.
“What the
“No, it’s alright. No harm done, right?” Steve shakes it off. “We can’t exactly adopt right now, but we’d like to make a donation to your cause instead. I understand your organization provides free vaccination and operation services too?”
before, they’d all believed his story of going down with the plane, and then waking up to this place. No one had bothered to ask about authenticity. He opens his mouth to protest but Tony cuts him off.
“Good. Now. Can we stop talking about my dad while we’re naked? It’s kind of weird.”
Stevos deserves it more than him, Tony thinks fiercely. This being had saved him from his hell hole, gave him the opportunity to save himself from the pit he has dug himself, and yet asks for so little in return.
A mug is pushed into his waiting hands, empty, along with a tupperware full of tiny marshmallows.
“I get that reference, but yes, very close. I need you to believe that I am as real as can be, think of me from time to time, keep me in your memories and live by what I stand for.” Stevos says earnestly. “In return, I shall lend you my strength should you need it. I do not need your answer now, but I will know when you accept it in your heart.”
It takes Steve a moment to remember the rush of panic, instinct to get away and make sense of it all. “I wanted to get up. Leave. Prove I was-”
“So, the two of you have or haven’t?”
It dawns on him. Energy, Stevos lends him energy. Strength in it’s most basic sense. Power, the kind that can be transferrable between two bodies. Suddenly, it’s not magic at all, just science. The god must have a conduit of some kind, stable enough to transfer energy from one being to another, if he could just harness-
“You wanted me to pick an Omega, right?” Tony smirks, all bravado still, looks to Howard. “Well, I pick him.”
The reply comes quickly, in form of an email that pings on his cell phone. It’s a yes, to Steve relief, along with an attached file that Phil insists Tony sign and emailed right back to him. There’s also a carefully worded message that, should Tony be pressuring him into anything, he ought to tell Phil immediately and he can pick Steve up, no questions asks.
It was a close thing, where all thoughts blurred into actions and gestures, and the directive to
you wanted to?” He pauses to look at Steve for any sign.
“You work.” Is the brief observation. He’s forgotten how bad Frank was with words. Just about as bad as him, probably.
A hot spike of anger runs through Steve. It’s easy to imagine punching the man, and then taking his time with his friends until they’d learnt their lesson, and had better manners. He wouldn’t even need his shield for this. A good 'ol fist fight might just be enough to shake off the melachonly he’s been feeling for the past week.
Phil isn’t daunted by the task, if anything he looks happy to be of assistance. Steve is secretly happy that the psychiatrists were nosey as they were, at least he only had to go through
Steve flushes at that, but Black Widow continues.
Steve, testing out his mouth again to make sure it was working, makes a hideous noise. "???"
“You need to act all concerned, needle me into talking, until I break down and admit how shitty and broken I am, that I’m not fucking fine and I haven’t been sleeping well, then we both burst into tears, do manly hugs, make vows of bestfriendship and then stuff our faces in the morning with pancakes! God, Rogers, get with the program.”
Happy got him a sketchbook (watercolor paper, 300gsm, much too good for him) and a small assortment of pencil. Now he’s reclined in his seat, snoring quietly with a sleeping mask on, leaving Steve with privacy with his new tools.
“Bidding starts at a hundred thousand. Do I have any takers?”
##########
be back, some glazed voice reminds him, too lost in the tide of Heat to argue much further. Instead, he curls up on the Alpha’s side of the bed, and fumbles for the dildo.
Tony’s voice is rough, like he hasn’t had water for days but he still manages to smile. There’s a certain tiredness in his eyes that doesn’t escape Steve’s notice. But Steve would prefer a tired Tony to a feral Tony, there was just no telling what the man could do.
That catches him off guard. The Beta must get it a lot from other Omegas because she continues on without so much as a look. “We’d like to know in advance, you see? Some Alphas don’t like having an Omega in heat, a lot more of a handful and finicky. They just come here for a good time. But some don’t mind having an Omega for a day or two, somewhere on the tailend when it’s starting to fade.”
“We use scent blockers now, which makes it impossible for someone to know your orientation by smell alone.” He explains. “For a normal person anyway. I guess you’re far from normal.”
“Not disagreeing, Steve.” Is another reminder, less patient. “But some choose it for themselves. A few do anyway. Those couple of kids back there? The ones that wanted to stay? Their families probably get a fee for them going along with it. And then an allowance for however long they stay with their buyer.” Clint speaks with controlled remorse. “Better than everyone going hungry, better than getting rejected for jobs day after day because you were born a certain gender.”
“Anthony! I’m coming!” He figures it’s some kind of telepathic thing. Ugh, magic.
“This isn’t goodbye.” Phil reminds him, perhaps reading into the situation all too well. It makes Steve wonder how many wayward Omegas Phil has had to care for to perceive so much with so little but then he reminds himself that Phil is also Clint’s handler, which makes some sense.
“Clint.” He hisses, face flushing.
“Mr. Stark!” Jasper calls out, but Tony’s already out by the lobby. “Did you- Did you not like our surprise?” Jasper says, flustered.
##########
It should be humiliating then, to be swept off his feet, whisked up by the god in what he knows is the way to the bedroom. But he doesn’t care much for it, holds onto Stevos like he’s afraid to let him go, presses his lips to each bit of skin he can.
Hitching up his bag, he nods to the driver that Tony sent. The man introduces himself as Happy Hogan, a nice enough Beta, they shake hands, Happy takes his bag and he is ushered into the car. With that, he leaves S.H.I.E.L.D., the building a distant view from the backseat.
“I’m going to contact Pepper as soon as we touch base. The hospital-”
“It is this.”
He doesn’t treat him like he’s going to break with a few jokes, or the reminder that he’s not from this century. It was the truth, and while everyone was content to ignore that fact, at least Hawkeye could make light of it.

“I love you, baby boy.”
Right, Afghanistan, Tony’s kidnapping. Steve had read the files, along with the press and news articles during and after his abduction. Shortly after returning to America, Tony had gone on to shut down Stark Industries’s weapons department, and subsequent department that correlated to them. Weapon contracts were scrapped, and what manufactured missiles and gun were stripped down to their core and blueprints locked away. And then Iron Man appeared and Tony had outed himself the very next day.
“Fuck. See. I was thinking I could give you the time to figure yourself out first.” Tony leans forward, pressing his nose to Steve’s neck with another grind of hip. “You’re young, you deserve to explore what you like, fool around maybe and enjoy yourself. I can wait, be there when you need me to be, and then I’d take care of you like a good Alpha should.” A tongue presses to his pulse point, Tony’s body so warm on top of his. “Well, I
He thinks they’re brave to want to go with strangers, whereas he gets out of the way when a couple come by to adopt. He doesn’t like the idea of people staring at him.
Steve likes to see the best in people, a way for them to show that they could be more than they appeared. Others might not have given him the same opportunity, but that did not mean he would let bitterness cloud his judgement.
Tony tentatively touches Stevos’s length, curved proudly upwards with a drop of pre-cum just at the tip. He licks his lips and looks up for permission before he dives right in.
“Still exist.
“Aww. You should try to watch a little bit of porn. Ideas about sex and some positions should help, if you and Stark get serious you’re gonna need it.”
"There was this guy, when I got kidnapped in Afghanistan. He saved my life, totally fucked me over with the arc reactor but he worked with what he had. He should have been the stopping point. He died, because
UNKNOWN: [
“You don’t have to come with me. It would probably be boring to you anyway. Have your own time off, spend time with your friends. Natasha?”
Steve only looks at him, worry etched into his face.
Suddenly, there’s a body on his. Warm and strong and unmistakable
I understand. It's a lot to process right now." Tony goes on when Steve remains silent. "It all won't happen right away, I just wanted to tell you, that's all." Tony soothes, bringing his hand to Steve's cheek and stroking.

take to get him to loosen up.
Tony cuts him off. “I know.
Stevos helps him get up, the god’s touch is warm on his hand, and scoops him up. He doesn’t look at all burdened by Tony’s weight. Tony takes the opportunity to wrap his arms around the god’s neck for balance.
Punching out the code, he plucks out the Starkphone from the box, still turned off like he’d left it.
Everyone gives him a wide berth, though there a few people who are friendly enough. When Nick Fury (Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.) drops in and asks how he finds the agents, he tells him that they are all nice to him and he's glad that they can accommodate him while they are all so busy with their work. Which is the truth but all Nick does is stare at him that he wonders whether or not it was the right answer.
“There are still builders who pray to Hephaestus, who seek his guidance for their craft. Fishermen still pray to Poseidon, god of the sea, to keep their boats safe during a storm. Athena, my mother, has followers who look to her for wisdom, or the occasional college student who has their finals coming up. Most gods are needed, in one shape or form. Names may change, but intentions remain the same. The stronger the belief of their followers, the more powerful a god can be.”
“Being gay is totally fine Steve. I mean, I’d hit that no matter my presentation.” Tony offers in counter argument.
“I was, uhm, just. Playing with that idea. It’d be swell if I could have a home to myself back in Brooklyn, get to see my old neighborhood again. It’s a pipe dream though, dunno how I could possibly own a room to myself when I probably can’t even buy my own clothes.”
him before. He didn’t think that that still applied to today, admittedly it sounded outdated even to him.
Inside is a bangle, small like a child's but somehow Steve knows it will fit his bony wrists perfectly. The design is nothing glamorous, plain all around except for three blue gems that glitter in the diner's light.
“S-Steve. 'Cept th-there’s already a-another Steve s-so e-everyone justs-s calls me Ro-Rogers.”
He bites his lip and touches the gold necklace around his neck. “It’s a story Tony should tell instead.” Steve sighs, looking miserably at his empty beer bottle. The look she gives him says that she means ask Tony exactly that.
“No, I don’t.”
“Huh?”
Steve ends up giving Clint a piggyback halfway their journey back
Steve sighs. “Barton, you’re goddamn gossiping goose.”
case, again, Agent Barton was suppose to be of assistance.” Phil shakes his head, looking suddenly fatigue. Steve can emphasize, it was the look he got when Bucky would mysteriously disappear from a mission.
“I didn’t expect you to wear it all the time. Not on missions anyway.” Tony quickly dismisses. “By the way, was your latest mission the twenty third or the twenty fourth?”
“Do you like that Anthony?” Stevos asks, crooking his fingers to where he knows would make Tony moan.
##########
It's still Sunday in most places, right?
“Clint?” He asks.
Clothes are discarded and Tony mauls his chest with vigor, twirling a tongue on his nipple that has him chortling with laughter.
He reaches out to touch, run his fingers down Stevos’s abs and finally his dick.
Steve doesn’t even look at him. “You’d like?”
“Just worried.” Is Bucky’s way of apology, is
It’s a relatively minor mission, not quite for the likes of Captain America, but it holds a closer role to Steve’s chest, and Clint’s.
when he pulls off from sucking balls.
They’re… Different. Looked different, felt different when compared to the Ironman he had last seen Tony wear. It’s been a year, of course there would be differences but somehow they aren’t quite as refined as Steve had expected. They seemed blunt, almost thrown together with the way they are designed, lacking the finesse that Steve has come to expect.
“Twang?”
“See how he responds?” Ed goes along with the narrative, as he explains each action to Andrew, like Steve’s body is this chart. “A gentle, but firm touch is required. An Omega will do anything to please their Alpha, given the right incentive.” And that really does make Steve’s eyes roll, which earns him a light slap on the face. “Never be afraid to discipline the Omega, they have to learn their place. You will respect me, Adam. My nephew must learn how to handle an Omega on his own.”
The man is babbling. Excuses, he thinks. His focus still quite isn’t there. He catches words like Silly, Indecent and Omega. Tony is mad at him. Why, Steve can’t tell but he keeps his head low in a submissive gestures and allows himself to be pushed. And then another whiff of strong Alpha pheromones that isn’t Tony. There’s some more arguing, and then he’s being tugged away again, this time with less patience.
When he leaves. “Ohh, he’s just so
He has JARVIS forward the file named 'RELEASE FORMS - STARK’ to Tony as Phil requested, with his own small note. ‘
vibe than a
Panicked, Steve latches onto Tony. “No, I’m fine. Really.” He adds at Tony’s disbelief. He was making a mess of the night, after Tony had been so nice to ask him to accompany him and get him a suit. “I-I think a drink. A drink would be good.” He just needs time to calm down, get his thoughts in order.
Steve runs on his instincts, and bundles Clint up in his arms takes him to bed when he’s like this. In hushed tones, he coaxes Clint to moving, murmurs encouragement as they slowly move to the bed where Steve can tuck them in and wait it out 'til morning.
“Wow.” Michael moans, really just
“Just don’t. Break anything.” Tony says in a tone that makes Steve huffs, as if he needs to be told, shoulder hunching up defensively.
The god fits perfectly in his arms. Without the extra bulk, he can curls his arm over the god’s naked chest, find leverage on the bed, and manage to fuck right into from behind. All without straining himself.
“Well, he is half my age.” Steve provides, bemused. The nervousness had dwindled down somewhat, replaced instead by dread of what was to come next. Clint and Natasha do an awful good job of keeping his spirits high, clearly taking this
“Okay so. When you're a computer programmer, code doesn’t work for shit and you don’t know why that is because no matter people say we aren’t one with the matrix and we make mistakes too despite the number of things we say. And yes, that’s
And then the hand withdraws, Steve frowning as he looks up at Tony with reproach. Tony chuckles, brown eyes twinkling.
. We talked about this before. You said-”
The bidding is still going, three forty as yet another Alpha puts up his paddle, the highest amount yet for the night.
“It’s a good deal, just not the one for me, right now.” Steve sighs.
“I g-guess?”
Steve’s mind is a little gone, two cocks distracting enough that he can’t really follow the conversation but he can tell that Andrew is close, by the tiny gasps and frantic movement. Ed must notice too, because he suddenly stops moving to Steve’s dismay, and pulls out.
“Tony. I can’t.” God he’s such a mess, he can’t even do this one thing for Tony.
Steve places his feelings aside for the mean time, focuses on helping each and every Omega out of the facility and into support vans, huddles over scared Omegas, and offers gentle words for them. There’s a strained scent in the air, sour with fear and confusion, wide eyes and stares, while most are led away, too silent. Drugs, if he has to guess, to keep them quiet and obedient. Steve hates it.
, with a price tag to their name and their lives written off.
It’s almost ironic that he enjoys getting lost in the street, going for whatever catches his eyes, picking through alleyways and sidestreets.
It’s been a year now. Children come and go, but Steve’s still here, his Ma still comes every Sunday and some kids take notice. He won’t get adopted, that’s for sure, but he still lives in the orphanage like everyone else. Steve doesn’t think it’s a problem.
They fall silent again, the unasked question hanging in the air. He figured that if Clint didn’t want to talk about it, then Steve wasn’t going to push him.
And there he is, sprawled on the bed, with not even a blanket to hide his modesty. The room fades for Tony, his eyes set on the sight of the Omega, curled on the bed, the light of the room reflecting on the sweat that dotted the Omega’s body. He’s even much more magnificent up close, muscles heavily defined with every line of his body, wide shoulders and strong thighs. Tony licks his lips.
“We’ll handle them when they come. You’re still not flying out.
“Told you already. I don’t like doctor.” And Tony says little else about that matter.
“It was my honor, ma’am.”
. “Tell him I’ll wait for him.”
"I wanted to." He sets the bowl by the bed table, taking his earlier seat right next to Tony. "It isn't really a big deal, everything was already around. My first time using a pressure cooker too. JARVIS guided me through it, so maybe this meal is from both of us."
Steve actually laughs. “Me and the guys used to call him that. The engineer. Oversaw all our equipment personally.” He has some good memories to cling to, even if half of them were laced with pain. He clung to those memories, bitter happiness and spiked injury underneath each one.
was trying to be the fucking hero." Tony shudders, eyes glassy.
The god appears, almost ghost-like in the way he comes in the room, relief blossoming in Tony’s chest at the sight of him.
“And waste what we’ve got on me?”
It’s still a friendship born from a contract, one that Steve isn’t going to naively believe would change everything all at once. He can count on Tony as a friend, and he’s pretty swell, but Steve isn’t going to drag him into anything that he didn’t agree to.
“Amazing.” Stevos whispers, his fingers playing Tony’s beard, so intimate a gesture, and kisses him on the nose. “My brave Anthony, they will sing your name is praises, your image will be known throughout the world.”
Steve goes very still, takes in a deep breath and let’s it out, eyes Bucky with cold eyes. “Now Ma. I knew she told you to look after me, before she even came down with illness. And you’re just trying to honor her wishes. But Ma knew what it was to sacrifice yer pride. I do too. Do you? Or are ya too embarassed to know an Omega who’d fuck to stay alive?”
“Oh, don’t thank me yet. There are still other men about. I’m afraid they are long overdue for punishment.”
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.” Tony bursts out when he’s finally has enough of his brain to speak, bolting up and away from Stevos. “I shouldn’t have. What I did- Taking advantage and- How could you possibly!! Here. You. Why would you-” It’s shame, guilt, desperation, bubbling in his chest, thoughts he has to get out, but the words are jumbled in his lungs, caught and choking him so that all he can do is gawp like a fish.
############
“It was… More difficult to get out of bed that day.” He’d never wanted to curl in bed and never leave than he did in that moment. Steve takes a shuddery breath to calm himself.
He remembers reports, during his short rests in the SSR base when he could have them. It wasn’t the Alphas faults, not entirely. A fresh squadron handed off to a rookie Alpha officer, all the pressure piled up one way or another, placed into a life threatening situation.
is on the tip of his tongue but he can’t bring himself to say it, too ashamed to admit it out loud even when he knows there’s no other way to describe his actions.
Sometimes he feels too hot and dizzy to leave his bed, and sometimes he feels too cold to do anything else but shiver under his blanket. Most of the time, he has a hard time breathing. His breath getting caught somewhere between his throat and lungs. His Ma says it’s called Asthma, and it means he can’t really run around too much like everyone else, so he has to be careful.
“It ain’t a request!” Bucky snarls, pounds his palms on the table, rattles all the cutlery and plates on it. “I’m
“One million.” Obie gasps. “Tony, please, this is
“We’ll fix that.” She says with a huff, a new gleam in her eye that Steve doesn’t know what to make off.
“Not with those injuries.”
( JARVIS later informs him that this is what are called 'grabby hands’ and shows him several different clips when Steve doesn’t believe that it’s a real
He's on the plane again, fingers frozen to the controls. No matter how much he hard he pulls, his hands are stuck, he can't even pick up the radio to tell Peggy goodbye.
Tony holds out a thin gold chain, the alloy woven intricately in uncertain pattern, like wires twisted together and then unravelled.
“Ugh. No. Robot are way cooler. They don’t pee or shit all over the place. Also. Engineering. Technical design. A beautiful mesh of metal and battery. Robots!” As if that explains everything.
(He doesn’t know it’s because his Ma had to sell their house to pay for the debt that his Dad owed.)
“Steven?”
People screaming left and right, and yet he’s alone all at once.

“Why?”
“Or similar. Sometimes we walk with mortals when we can, watch what the world has become and intervene where we see fit.”
It was going to be okay, Steve tells himself.
“Wh-what?” Steve answers back, delirious from the pleasure, only brought back to his own mind when Tony’s fingers stop their torture.
They leave only for pancakes, which Steve insists on if they were going to follow Clint’s guidelines, stuff their faces with stacks and an alarming amount of syrup.
Steve explores the Alpha’s broad chest. Solid, warm, a soft thatch of curls that tickle his palms when he brushes over them. Flat solid abdominals, contrast to Andrew’s still-baby fat, the sharp angles of his hip, dipping low towards his cock, and thick thighs.
Tony raises a brow but adjusts in his seat and holds up his hand regardless. They quickly shake hands and Steve takes the chair directly in front of Tony, with a table separating them. He tries to smile at him once he’s found his seat but Tony doesn’t even bother smiling back.
They’re at the S.H.I.E.L.D. firing range. Suspiciously empty but no complaints from Steve. He doesn’t feel like being gawked at today, not after another grueling round of questions from the psychiatrist.
An intake of breath, ragged. “Why wouldn't I be?" But the smile falters, a twitch of the eye, the rustling of limbs underneath the blanket. "What did they tell you?" Suddenly guarded. Jittery.
Truth be told, he hadn't expected to survive the crash.

JARVIS sounds so earnest for a machine, for a voice that lived in a computer. Steve still has some trouble understanding how human-like JARVIS truly was.
Tony resists the urge to roll his eyes.
He and Tony had been exchanging conversation over text. Mostly because Steve didn’t have his phone all the time, and their timezones didn’t always line up, but when they had the opportunity, a call had been a better way to talk. And Steve feels like it must mean
Steve groans when he reads the occupation list.
They stay like this for a while, Steve just on Tony’s lap, until Happy raps on the partition and calls out. “Boss? Should we make another loop around the park or?”
“I don’t think you do.” Tony says after a while, having leaned over the shield and the drill had started up again, this time pressed to the underside of the shield. “A shield for defense. It was purely by chance that it could have been used. Not a lot of people know about the shield at all, it’s origins, how it was made. Many people still believe it’s made of some metal compound, some steel and iron, very medieval. Not many know about Vibranium, because it’s such an uncommon element, such an expensive metal, that it can hardly be used by the average person. In fact, because of it’s significant worth, it’s only used by the military, even NASA couldn’t afford this shit.”
He cooks breakfast right after, taking liberty of the refrigerator and it’s contents. He has to cook enough for himself, which is an embarrassing amount already. Sometimes, if he’s lucky, Tony joins him before he leaves for work. They would make some small talk, Steve knows he can’t pry about Stark Industries so he never bothers, but they find other things to talk about. Mostly it’s about what Steve reads up on, and he asks Tony about it for clarification.
the Omega, but he can be sure as hell can tell that he’s in the room
Still, he was careful not to take too much, the guilt was already eating him that he was spending the Alpha’s money.
Only Tony has a numbered paddle between the three of them. Money wasn’t an option, and it wasn’t like Howard would actually

“We have.” Steve answers, the blush doesn’t go away.
It was a traditional statement, when an Alpha was to
“No, it’s uh- Sorry.” Steve abruptly stops the nervous thumping of his foot, and rubs his sweaty palms over his expensive pants.
“You do.” He finally answers. It feels like a confession but it also feel like a lie. His insides boil at the implication of his own words (“I don’t need your protection, Bucky. I’m fine on my own.”), an admittance that he has to shockingly acknowledge even when he doubts them. He’s not sure if he said it for himself or for Tony.
“So that’s what has been bothering you?”
##########
“What? No.” Clint looks frustrated, and he smells like it too, like an electric zing running across the space between them. “Heard it from Maria, and I thought I’d-” He lets out a frustrated snarl and makes averted movements. “I need to get out of here. From SHIELD. But I’m not-”
Warmth spreads through him, a pleasurable shudder with every flick of tongue that sparks Steve’s nerves.
] Steve wrestles down the impulse to put his name on the end, and to keep his 'texts’ short and concise. It’s nothing like writing an actual letter after all.
Somehow they manage to spend an hour like that, with Tony’s head inside the machine and Steve handing him things that were out of reach, doing as Tony instructed, or holding onto Tony’s tools until he otherwise needed them.
Steve was vaguely familiar with bioscans.
They get dressed, Steve awkward for a moment but then realizes that Tony doesn’t seem to care much for their nakedness, and places on clothes almost like the way he puts on the uniform. Efficient.
He curls up next to the Alpha after cleanup, breathing in his warm scent, the sudden weariness that comes after sex demanding to be sated with sleep. The buzzing in his mind quiets to a murmur, worry and anxiety melted away from his bones.
“You’ve been talking to JARVIS too much. You’re remarkably adaptive for someone from the forties.”
“Still can’t believe you’re invited to this roast. Still
“Protocols updated.”
From behind him, he can hear the Curator making the rounds. “One million going once.”
Steve returns the smile.
“Tony, I just agreed to being your date.”
“For minor gods, however, a large following is difficult to obtain. By obscurity or similar, we could never hope to be as strong as our parents, so instead we gather Patrons to keep us in power. So long as we have Patrons who believe in us, we may remain in one form or another.”
spy of all spies.” Tony says, like that’s the explanation for it.
“I know you didn’t, Tony, it’s okay, you don’t have to apologize.” Steve tries to placate. He does know it, the Tony Stark he met in that lab wasn’t the Tony he knew from a few months ago.
“I’ll get your clothes back for you.”
That gets him a face.
“Can I climb in bed with you?”
. Stop trying to say
Steve startles as he’s loading up his bike.
Steve pulls away, his hands tugging at Tony’s shirt in a half-attempt to tug him forward, half for seduction. He smiles wickedly, sinking back onto his bed, legs spread in an obscene position to show off his half-hard cock through the thin cloth of his boxers.
He’s not ignorant. Half of the time Stevos doesn’t even come, and Tony can’t bring himself to care, which should bother him more now that he thinks about it. But he can’t, not when feels so sorry for himself. Even when there’s an actual god sucking his cock, very enthusiastically too, as soon as it’s all over, Tony’s either passed out, or is just too tired to reciprocate. There’s that sense of dread hovering on the edge of his mind. There to pry upon his thoughts if he lets it.
“Shield deactivate.” And the watch powers down as well. Steve’s breathing a little heavier than before, a quick realization that that had actually scared him, to have his shield come flying at him had been terrifying.
Not for the first time, Steve wishes that he could punch Loki in the face one more time.
“Yeah? Dunno how you’d know that. Unless they’ve given you my file.”
He had to stop and start several times. Hands shaking with frustration every time.
Brock sighs. “Then go ahead and disappear off into your rabbit hole. I’ll take care of Steve here for the time being.”

“No, no, no!” Tony backpedals, shaking his arms wildly. “Your presence is very much appreciated. Like, you’re so gorgeous, I could stare at you all day and never get tired. I’d do it right now but my leg hurts and my back aches from sitting like this.”
Omega that they’d forgotten about their previous issue and instead worried over him.
“Now with your pay… 20 cents an hour to start, we’ll see how well you do and maybe in a month or so we can bump it up to a quarter. Got it?”
listen? Did you see that guy? God of Thunder, makes sense, doesn’t it?”
Except, behind the agent is Clint, which
All Tony offers is a grunt, and moves into the direction of the coffee.
Tony prowls, circles to the side of the bed and sits just by the Omega’s back, he runs light fingers on the Omega’s back, feels the heat that comes off from him in waves, hot and sticky in the air.
They settle down on folding chairs, the first clip of Howard’s dream utopia on screen, and watch.
Steve looks up to see a dark-haired boy, just a little taller than him, staring at them.
, Steve, would you be my date? I’ll treat you good and kiss you at the door when it’s all over.”
Steve doesn’t answer, goes into a coughing fit.
“Alright. You’re not expected to talk to anybody. If someone comes up to you and starts asking questions, it’s better to act like you don’t know a thing and call for me instead. Call my attention, tap my arm, do a signal and I can handle the rest.” Tony says for the upteenth time tonight, as they escape the blinding flashes and enter the hall.
God, this was a lot to think about.
“N-No? Not in this century.” Emboldened, he continues. “I used to look at blue pictures, and before that, educational leaflets in Omega school.” Which were like diagrams on how heats were to be proceeded by, what to do, how to go about it, along with tips on how to please an Alpha.
“Yep, computers are basically slaves to the whims of humanity.” Tony nods solemnly. “But see, it’s incredibly frustrating learning to code, and even more frustrating when something doesn’t work the way it should. And thus comes the rubbery ducks to the rescue. See, the only way to go through the errors of logic in the code is go through it step-by-step, looking for the piece you’ve gotten wrong. Sounds easy enough, but when you’ve got thousands of lines of code to go through, and no one to talk to. I don’t have to tell you it starts feeling insane.” Tony gives him a look that Steve equates to understanding what he means, so Steve nods anyway.
It was awe, some boyish emotion that made Tony smile at him like he’d personally hung the moon. Steve smiles sadly, finding the sentiment too overwhelming to accept, pulling himself away from Tony’s arms.
There’s a pause, and then the cock is gone from his ass, but Steve knows that Tony is still hard from expectation. The Alpha doesn’t stop lavishing his neck with little kisses though, and one hand plays with his nipple still.
Steve gasps for breath, his heart thudding painfully in his chest as he sniffles and tries to draw in breath from his mouth, his nose too stuffed with snot.
Happy squeezes past him, looks used to it, settling into one of the seats with Steve’s bag still in hand, leaving him with a litany of choices and unsure of where he should place himself.
Which leaves Tony.
.” Tony waves off, plugs in the drill and tests it with a whir. “So, before I was interrupted so
Weird how the 'enemy’ slowly doesn’t even register as a human being when you’re hungry, cold and desperate. Where sometimes the only line between life and death is shooting first.
The rest of his time is preoccupied with 'cohabitation' as one of the psychiatrists had so plainly said when asked with what he has been up to. To Steve, it simply means leaving his S.H.I.E.L.D. assigned room whenever he is allowed, keeping to himself during meal time, and punching bags at the gym level of S.H.I.E.L.D..
It’s remarkably easy to bring him, but turns a lot more difficult when a muscular blonde with a red cape takes him.
“I know you wouldn’t.” Steve sighs, finds that he believes it, even if jealousy flared earlier.
“Dear 'ol dad had a trust fund set up for you. Was convinced that you’d reappear with a hundred hungry mouths to feed. Right now, that trust fund is still stable, a little bit of it goes to charity every year for recovering veterans. I wouldn’t know the exact numbers, not without consulting some accounting, but it probably still has a solid five mil in it.”
He was picking out an Alpha from a list instead of meeting them because of who he was. Because S.H.I.E.L.D. wasn’t going to reveal him
“Sshh Shh Sshhhh, just breathe for me, okay?” Steve soothes, bringing a palm up to caress Tony’s cheek, smiling as Tony goes through the motions. “That’s good, just a few more. Perfect.
It is Tony who makes the first move, taking Stevos’s hands in his own as he inches closer. At the first touch of their lips, Tony feels the spark that zips in his body, like his body is awakened by that simple gesture and he runs his hands all over the god’s body, over every crevice he could reach.
Just watching Tony maneuver the kitchen is surreal enough, even if it’s something as simple as chopping away at the brown lump, turning them into smaller chunks. In fact, he hadn’t been sure Tony even used the kitchen, everything had been far too pristine when he had first started using the kitchen, he had doubted that it had seen much use before him. Maybe he’d been wrong though, Tony seems to know where the everything was, as he pushes the chunks into the steaming milk, taking out a whisk next to lightly mix the pot.
believe you were ready, Steve.”
Instead, he runs in place, a television in front of him so that he has something else to focus on. It’s normally set to the news (but Clint changed it once on some morning cartoons that he enjoyed), while he listens to with curiosity. He doesn’t understand half of the things they talk about, but he adds them to the list.
“And neither will I.”
Steve takes a hold of his hardening cock, smooth and knotless, rocking into his fist as it fills. Every stroke is damn near pleasurable friction, pumping himself as pre-cum dribbles out of his tip. A sweep over the head has him mewling, the cool wetness slicking up his cock as it jumps in response.
He looks to the side just enough to catch Tony giving him a strange look, his own mug cradled in his hands like a precious thing.
He growls, low and deep, finding pleasure in that thought. Steve knows he shouldn’t, not right now, though his instincts told him that Tony was
Steve goes willingly, allows Tony to position him as he pleases, strong hands guiding him to face away from Tony.
“I will
Steve shifts on his feet. “I suppose? I’d say a lot of my becoming would fall under chance, yes. Howard had shield by the dozen lined up for me to choose from, but this one was the only one that had seemed right.” He thinks back to that moment, when Howard was bombarding him with choice after choice, confounded him with alloys, weight, density and more. Howard hadn’t even offered the shield to him, it had just laid there, unassuming and looking nothing like all the others. It wasn’t flashy, didn’t have all the contraptions stuck to it, it was plain and simple, and it had called to Steve in it’s humbling way.
Steve, for the life of him, though he desperately tries to keep a straight face, barks out a laugh as he hugs Tony’s side. “Tony, I gotta tell you something, it’s gonna blow your mind.”
It all seems so trivial when he knows he’s going to die, but he doesn’t want to give them the satisfaction of being whittled down.
But even more confusing are the ones that scream and cry not to be taken, clinging to each other, being difficult as agents slowly pry them apart, forcefully if needed.
“Dinner?”
Steve nods, it’s better than he’d hoped for coming in. “Yes, sir.”
Steve nods, and then his shoulders droop. “They. Took them.” He motions vaguely, away from him. Tony takes it to mean The Gallery took his clothes.
money. But it’s not much to live on, unless you do it every night. I think you’re a nice one though. The nice ones get picked up by an Alpha around here, then they never come back, or they become not-so after a while.” She shrugs.
“Yes, Anthony, there. Gods! There!” Stevos moans, thrusting back on his cock as he bows his head low on the bed.
Clint looks like he’s about to protest (say something nasty) but then Natasha hit him on the shoulder and that gets him quiet.
“Oh, it’s alright. We’re used to your brand of dumb.”
Wow, it's sunday and there's a chapter? Wowowow. Anyway. Finally got a new phone, still got to pay it off, but it's all mine. :) I'm trying to get back into the groove of writing again, so there's that.
But Steve also knows that certain people don’t change, and there will always be bullies like Hammer who will get their way.
Omega.”
He almost does, halfway through the motion before there’s suddenly a hand on his arm, prying it down, actually bending the metal and titanium as Stevos gives him a hard look, angrier than Tony has ever seen him.
He can’t help the smile on his face. “M’good. Just tired.” He admits. He doesn’t mean physically, merely all the worrying had taken a lot more from him than he thought it would.
Enjoy.
That takes Steve unawares. No one had ever called him an

The god raises his hand, and a round shield flies to him, fitting into his palm perfectly. He moves faster than anything Tony has ever seen, moves with a grace that Tony would equate to the flight of birds, if birds could make killing beautiful.
Steve doesn’t answer at first, just enjoys the presence that is Tony, who smells like earth, fresh air, metal and
Tony blinks. “Oh. Stay put.” And just like that, Tony darts out of the room, leaving the door ajar.
“I can’t believe it. It’s a fucking miracle, how the fuck did you survive all alone?”
“That we’re not alone in the universe. Aliens actually
“I’ll do my best, sir.”
The third finger is pressing in with a slow burn, the rest of Stevos’s palm squeezing his ass whenever he’s knuckle deep.
. Christ Stevie, I’ve been working extra shifts to cover us both.” Bucky says out of frustration, throwing his hands up in the air. “Even so, we don’t get payed by the hour no more, just by how much cargo we load in an’ out. An’ lately it ain’t been a lot.” Bucky shakes his head. “Dock work’s slow, even at three in the morning, they say we’re gonna have to join on the war effort with the Brits soon so there ain’t a lot coming into the city any more.”
“C’mon fellas, we don’t want any trouble. I just need to get my friend home. He’s had a too good of a night.” Steve tries, but when one guffaws, he knows it’s no use.
“Oh Tony, you and your jokes.” She says, already walking past them.
Steve grits his teeth, hoists Clint up a little onto his shoulder.
of pages. The sketchbook is filled with, well, sketches. Some drawn from memory, others from sight. It feels oddly intimate to share them.
She leans in a bit closer. “And if there were any… Incidents. We can certainly help you take care of it.” And that chills Steve to the bone.
Bucky just sighs, holds him closer.
“I did.”
“Oh my god, you’ve gone feral, haven’t you?” It’s a question, one he ignores as he grumbles in disappointment. But not for long as rough fingers plunge into his hole, massaging his insides with almost tactical precision.
It almost feels like those nights, back when it was just him and Clint, except he’s coming down from a full mission with him and adrenaline still courses through him. It should be habit to him now, and a few times it is. He works out the extra energy, extra adrenaline, by hitting the gym or painting, something to concentrate on to burn all the extra energy his body packs in at an anticipation of a fight. He also knows that’s not normal, most other people coming down from an adrenaline high run off on their hormones, but eventually they tire down and look for rest.
“He’s sort of a celebrity. Nat did his evaluation.” As if that was answer enough.
“Is there anything I can do?” I ask, shuffling across the floor to his side and resting a hand on his arm.
I use the back of my chair to push myself upright and clink a metal finger against my glass, suddenly facing a a quiet room full of friends with color in their cheeks, studying me with varying levels of amusement and interest. No turning back now. I plaster on a grin and hope it helps mask the nerves that alcohol has only partially smoothed out. "Friends, colleagues, fellow Avengers. I have an announcement to make, and I'm gonna need your undivided attention. But...god, that's a lot of eyes. If a few of you could like, look over there—"
“I’m sorry I brought it up,” Nat says. “But I’m serious, if I need to tuck-and-roll, you guys gotta give me a fair warning.”
On second thought, maybe we’re made for each other.
Steve’s new.
"We don't have time for 'buts', soldier," Sam snaps. "You all have your assignments. Now go."
My skull feels like it's caving in more than the snapped bones and crushed tendons in my leg. My vision is clouding. My breathing is irregular. I know why. It's not the pain.
He pushes my shoulder, just enough to sway me off balance. I grin and shove him in retaliation.
I suppose this will have to do for now.
"What's that?"
"Tony?" His moment of clarity devolves into a cringe of pain. He clutches his shoulder. "I was hiding. Waiting for my cue from Natasha, when...
S: We should get a dog.
“What, the dream?”
“Did you just say opponent?”
“It was a surprise to get the invitation, huh?” Bruce says. “Ol’ Tony’s been pretty quiet these last few months. I was beginning to think I’d never see the place.”
And then they're all gravitating around us, offering pats on the back and one-armed hugs. Scott gives me and Steve high-fives. Steve's a little over-eager, leaving Scott's palm tomato red.
“Not your fault.”
“Pretend that there’s nothing going on. Between us. Ignoring each other.”
“Hm.”
Wannabe cuts off mid-sentence, and there’s a pause before the familiar sound of strumming guitar fills the speakers.
Natasha takes the first stab at a conversation. “So, are you guys at each others throats again, or what? Because if you’re gonna get into argument and crash the car, I’ll need a heads up.”
When I’m less worried about falling on my face and getting my fingers run over, I allow myself to focus on Tony. He seems so content, in his element. There’s something softer in his expression that I’ve never seen before. It warms me from the inside out.
Steve's voice cuts through the static. "Nat, status report. How are those files looking?"
Tony doesn’t reply until I nudge him. “Uh, yeah.”
Again, no answer. I open the door slightly and peer inside.
His voice has an extra touch of warmth in the morning. Low, sweet, a little raspy still, and he speaks so methodically. I sink deeper into my bed and roll over, sandwiching my phone between my cheek and the pillow. I’m not even sure if I’m listening to the words anymore, I’m just listening to him. He could read me a court summons right now and I’d probably say thank you.
“Oh…Okay…wow. Thats— ”
“What would you like to talk about, then?” he asks.
“There’s a fresh pot.”
She chooses a flick that I’ve never seen before, and when it’s over, I still don’t feel like I’ve watched it. I just stare past the screen and feel grateful that at least I don’t have to pretend to remember what we were talking about anymore.
“Hmm.” She reaches into her bag and pulls out a tablet.  “Wanna watch a movie? Get your mind off it?”
Things have been different since we defeated Thanos. Well…if I’m being honest, things have been different for a lot longer than that. It’s been a long handful of years. Lots of hot-faced sobbing. Lots of walking around like an empty suit. Lots of public appearances that went south. Regrets piled up like the laundry I still haven’t been able to bring myself to do….God, I even bought a bunch of plain T-shirts and underwear in bulk when all of my remaining clothes failed the sniff test.
Steve: It's called 'knocking is important'.
A pause, static, a dull thud. My heart catches in my throat, only relaxing when Steve's voice cuts through the noise once again. "They're scattering," he says. He's out of breath, too. "Something happened, they all just... stopped fighting. Something's not right, Sam, you all should get out of there."
I wonder if he can tell that my pulse just quickened, or that my cheeks have taken on a touch of color at the blunt sincerity in his words. “Consider myself checked,” I say. “I’m fine, Cap. This civilian’s not in danger, you can take the night off.”
“I see how it is.” He picks up his own menu and sets it upright on the table, so all I can see are his eyes over the top. “You think you can out-flirt me. That’s blasphemy, you know.”
“Not really.”
Return to the cabin and face the fire.
“Cap! You son of a bitch, you made it! Come, come, let me make you a drink,” he shouts, ushering me over.
"Life is...complex," Vision continues. "In many ways, the DNA in this single leaf seems more complicated than all of the neurons that make up my internal code. Plants know what they need, innately. I can't say for certain what I'm feeling most times." He lowers the leaf, and fixes his inquisitive gaze back on Wanda. "Yet for all of that complexity, they ask so little from this world. They simply hope that the sun will continue to rise, and the rain will continue to fall."
Natasha sighs and settles back in her seat. “Oh boy.”
"Been worse." Natasha brandishes an SD card. "And just barely. I'd prefer not to cut it so close next time."
⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅
I clip in and gesture for him to do the same. He does, albeit begrudgingly. “I’m excited, Tony.”
"Are you saying you wouldn't go after him?"
I laugh slightly. Maybe I’m bad at reading sarcasm, or maybe I’m just bad at reading Tony, but I still can’t quite tell when he’s kidding.
It’s not the first time I’ve had this dream, though it’s never exactly the same. Sometimes the events are shuffled around, sometimes it’s Pepper that dissipates in my arms, sometimes I snap, sometimes I don’t.
“Oh.” I chew on that for a moment. “How much did I have to drink, again?”
“Wow, that’s great. Sounds like you all have this whole…thing…under control,” Tony says, setting down his glass and splashing his drink onto the tablecloth. “I guess you won’t need the rest of us, huh?”
He had rolled to safety, and is now watching me with eyes the size of saucers, grasping his blood-soaked shoulder with an equally blood-soaked hand. "I...I don't know. Maybe? But I won't just leave you like—"
"You can't just drop a bomb like that, man, we need you," Sam says. "Who's gonna fill your shoes when you're gone?"
⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅
He lets go, steps back. I can almost see the gears whirring in his head. “Is that a joke?”
Without warning, Tony rips away and staggers backwards. “I told you to shut up. God, you’re persistent. Like a fly in my ear, you know that?”
Steve raised his eyebrow, smiling back to him.
He sat on the bed, perfectly alert, and let himself be guided by his primarily senses. He found himself crouched at the foot of Tony's bed, his throat dry and his eyes burning with tears. It had been a long time since he last felt all this desperation, and now he had the feeling of drowning in it.
Steve frowned, looking thoughtful. Then he threw the bag on the ground and opened it, starting to rummage inside. After practically spilling half the content out, he finally seemed to find what he was looking for. Steve was holding a white t-shirt in his hand, the same t-shirt he had worn for the night at the Bartons'. And now, one knee on the ground as if he was proposing to him, he was offering it to Tony.
When any threat had been obliterated and the victorious heroes could allow themselves to rest and return to their – more or less – normal life, Rogers' attitude changed imperceptibly. Slowly, as the adrenaline dropped down leaving room for the tiredness and shortage of post-war emotions that they all knew too well, Rogers began to gravitate around him.
Steve snorted and moved into position.
“Great. Fantastic.”
Scenes like this were played more or less at the end of each mission. It was an unorthodox way to release tension, but for Tony was fine. He was happy to be able to play with his own sub-genre and pretend to flirt with an Alpha. He had never done either. Having the opportunity to experiment in that way with someone he could trust was a new and interesting thing, liberating even.

“Enhached olfact?”
Tony is usually better than that, he’s usually able to hold back the sobs while he cries.

Steve asked him to pass him a blanket, the big blue one, and Tony helped him to drape it over the wall of pillows that he had skilfully built. He seemed completely absorbed in the task.
“That they funded a movie with sharks flying into a tornado?”
Yes, Steve knew how to keep a secret. It was certainly not the hardest part of the matter. The hardest part was waking up with an Omega at the bedside and absorbing all his concern for you. To think that it’s beautiful and that it can’t be better. Then to find himself at the door of his nest-room.
Steve choked on water and Tony stared at him puzzled.
“No. Now shut up and just pay attention.”
“My parents could. And Jarvis too, bless him. Now… Rhodey, yes. He started to see it many years ago. And he’s currently the only one."
“You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?”

Steve untie a hand from their clutch and bring it to Tony’s forehead, kneading between his eyebrows. Tony closed his eyes and started to purr, and Steve smiled with relief and wonder. It had never happened before, even when they had nested together.

"You taste like honeysuckle."
Steve ventures to take a step forward. His hand hesitates for a long time before daring to squeeze around Tony’s, causing hawthorn to bloom.
“There, there.” He muttered uneasily, “Stop doing that, please? You're like… a forge of pheromones and I don't know what to do with all this tension, okay?"

Steve had thought about it, he couldn't lie to himself. But it had been easier to repress that thought. It had been easier to label it under the ‘demanding sub-genre’ voice than to think they liked each other for who they were.
When a robotic arm served them the steaming cups, the smile on Steve's face opened completely, showing all his teeth. At a safe distance, Tony looked at the fangs made to bite and thought that they were not as frightening on him as they were on Howard – or on any other Alpha he unfortunately runned into. Maybe it was the blue sky of his eyes that sweetened the whole, or maybe it was the chocolate mustache that gave him a childish air. Or maybe – well, maybe it was the fact that Steve, despite being a forge of pheromones and had all the reasons to become non-stop feral, had never done anything to Tony.
As with everything related to his relationship with Steve, Tony didn't stop to analyze what was going on until it was too late. And then he did this thing were he found himself stuck in a loop of continuous and maniacal hyper-analysis.
"Sorry?"
Tony began to nest in his closet – the first glimpse of what his future sub-genre was. But his ex-nanny was an Omega and Howard blamed her for teaching these ‘weak-kneed practices’ that were ‘misleading Tony’, so his behavior only reinforced Howard’s belief that his son needed healthy straightened. The quarrels between his parents also began and Tony increasingly took refuge in the closet, under a pile of blankets and clothes, crying in silence.

Steve knew about war’s traumas, but he was a trained soldier and had chosen that life. It could be objected that even Tony, despite being lacking in training, had chosen that same life, but in fact it was that life that had chosen Tony, whether he liked it or not.
Tony laughs hysterical.

Stark raised a hand and took a step towards him. Except then seem to freeze with the hand blocked mid-air. The distance was eventually covered and Stark managed to awkwardly pat him on the shoulder.
Tony rolls his eyes and sighs in frustration.
It belonged to them that sort of hesitant dance in which they fell at the end of each mission. It belonged to them the exchange of phrases that sounded less and less like a ‘sort-of-flirting-but-just-for-fun-and-stress-relief’, and were becoming more and more a ‘oh-fuck-we-are-actually-flirting’. It belonged to them the sublte shift from the exchange of words to the exchange of act.

Tony's gaze planted on his and remained there, conscious.
Tony turns around with his hands in his hair, which are now full of lavender.
“Yes.” He said.
“Do you mind, Stark?”
Yes, Steve understood him: it would have been like giving up the serum. He could have given up on Captain America's shield, but certainly not on the serum.

Maybe that wasn't a mattress–
"I want to be the one who kisses you and finds out what flowers you make bloom."
“No more apologies. I beg you.” Stark stepped back, putting some distance between them again, “Are we okay?”
“I can't read your mind, so–”
Steve has an idea, but he needs Tony to tell him. He needs to hear it from Tony's voice.
“Fuck society.” He snapped, “You are beautiful and that's it.”
“I'm not your Alpha.” Echoed Steve.
Now Steve was there, in a small room of the S.H.I.E.L.D. sickbay, with one knee on the ground and a t-shirt in his hand. With Tony's  staring astonished at him.
In a not too distant future, for example, Steve would run into a ghost from his past, and he would almost die at the hands of that ghost. Engaged elsewhere, Tony wouldn’t have been there to guard him, thus finding himself breaking that now proven rule. The consequences would have been unpredictable and to soothe the Omega it wouldn’t have been enough just a purr.
He pushed him away. With the hands. With his eyes he was attracting him like mermaids attracts sailors to their sweet death. Steve rested his forehead on his and closed his eyes, inhaled one last time his sweet pre-hest smell.

“Ah!” Tony's eyes widened in amazement at the realization, “Do you know how many years he spent looking for you in the damn ice? He didn't just want to find you, he wanted to find the only thing left of that experiment and start from there.”
After a bolder bite, Steve grabbed Tony's chin and snarled at him with bare fangs. Far away from being scared, the Omega open his lips and slowly licked them. Steve's growl subsided into a rumbling of pure interest, his grip relaxed around Tony's face. The Omega moaned and looked at him between his thick lashes, his mouth parted, so soft and eliciting.
“Something like that, I think.”

As if he had received a punch in the stomach, Steve backed away, head down, hunched his shoulders. When he looked up, his eyes were blue again.
“Go away, please.” He heard him whisper, pleading.
"Do you notice when you do it?"
Steve chuckles softly, the vibration spreading between them like a wave of unexpected sweetness.
“All right.” He forced himself to say, “Take care of yourself, Tony.”
"Why... are you staring at me like that?"
Than he pointed in his direction: “Your ice cream is melting, Capsicle.”
"That’s right, doll."
He felt Steve's eyes on him as he lowered the wooden plaque on the bottom exposing the voice detector.
“Mhm?”
The entire bottom wall of the closet moved to the side, and Tony took a step forward.
Tony took refuge in his Malibu villa and faced that heat

Steve blinked his red eyes and took a deep breath.
Steve lifts him effortly and seats him on the workstation, making space between his legs. Tony wraps his arms around his neck and pulls him down, exposing his neck to his kisses. The soft skin under his ear is inviting and Steve takes it between his lips and sucks, slipping his hand into his hair, his fingers sliding like silk between the rose petals. The moan that escapes Tony’s lips is faint, almost shy. He clings to Steve and presses, presses desperately, as if he were afraid of him suddenly disappearing. Steve grabs his face and lifts it to kiss him again, to take all that desperation off him. He’s there for Tony, to welcome his tongue in the warmth of his mouth and make it his.
“It was a hell.” He nodded, “For someone like me, if nothing else. But today it is different, especially for someone like you.”
"Alright." she doesn't seem convinced, but still she avoids pressing him, and he’s grateful for it, "Whenever you want. I know some very professional therapits."

“No.” He shrugged, and this time he sounded more confident, “It's not being Omega per se. It’s… all that revolves around us.” He gestured vaguely, “Come on, don't tell me you liked it. Back in your day it was even worse.”
Steve's hands don't stop stroking him. His hair, his back, his arms. As if to quiet his tormenting thoughts. And Tony already knows it’ll be impossible for him not to get used to that. Completely unsolicited and suffocating cuddles from a man who, dammit, Tony has always admired him from afar believing that he’s not even remotely worthy of his thoughts. And instead, here he is: Steve Rogers giving him the best cuddles of the 'next day', after giving him the best sex of his life.
“So…” Tony clears his throat, trying his best to pull out the fake voice he uses with the press, “JARVIS, let me guess: I left my microphone on.”
And just like he had come, he turned on his heels and left.

“Although, I must confess,” He said in a deliberately casual tone, “I was almost about to call it ‘Narnia’.”
Tony is lying on the worn out couch down in his lab, a wet patch on his eyes burned from too much work, and a glass of centrifuge in his hand. He finishes it just before the phone call is taken, and hands the empty glass to Dum-E.
“Has this happened to you already?” He asked, hoping not to be crossing that vague border that has not yet been fully traced.
"Yes. No. I notice it but I can’t control it."
Rule two: Tony’s inner Omega had expectations, even if he didn't know them either. But Steve had been an Omega, and he had never appreciated this tactical advantage as much as he does now. For example, if Tony was walking in front of him, Steve knew he expected him to put his hand in the middle of his back; and each time Tony slowed his pace and let himself go against his hand with an little sigh. Steve did this, as well as opened doors for him and gave way when they entered a room – and sometimes he had to refrain himself to move Tony’s chair for him. And all this Tony didn't

“Well, technically you're ninety-five.” Tony shrugged.
He had woken up in a bed in the Tower’s sickbay, never as grateful at that moment as he ended up there. He had breathed deeply the reassuring air, inhaling along with the smell of disinfectant also a familiar citrus and cinnamon smell, tinged with tiredness.
Steve grinned: “Yes, right, pretend you don't like it.”

So the next day Steve goes down to the lab with his sketchbook clutched in his hands. It takes him a while to make up his mind and cross the threshold.

in his place.
They could only stay in the moment, that was all it was granted to them. They could stay in those early morning hours, with the light still struggling to warm the air and the wooden walls that seemed to protect them from all the ugliness awaiting them out there. For a few moments, they could only be themselves, suspended in that limbo. Alpha and Omega: so close to the surface that they can really see each other for the first time.
"Mmmh."
Tony just didn't know where all this would lead. And for a control freak like him he was bizarre that he wasn't worried about it. A part of him felt reassured that he was committed with Pepper, because there was another part – a rather new and unknown and a bit frightening part – that felt flattered by Steve's attentions. Too flattered, honestly. In a completely unexpected way. So well, really, it was great that Tony was currently engaged in a serious relationship with Pepper. Because get a crush over a teammate that was clearly acting just for the sake of both their biology, well, that would be a damn mess.

raised his eyebrows: “Ah?”
Steve was silent. Tony slided into a rocking chair. He felt his stern gaze on him.
"Mh?"
“Rogers.”
When they part, both hard and stupidly happy, Steve glares down at him, all mussy hair and raw red lips. Tony can’t believe is going to be railed from Captain America.
Stark was an Omega.
"How about these? Have you ever seen them?"
The door handle fell to the ground with a loud, metallic thud. Steve's expression was unreadable.

What was he supposed to do? What did an Alpha expect from an Omega in a similar situation? Tony looked at Steve, but he couldn't see just
"My eyes are down here." he points a finger at his face.
Tony was there in the building and he was fine. Whatever had happened in those weeks when Steve was on mission, had already gone. Tony didn't need him to get by, he could take care of himself.
“Banner and I were doing research.” He tried to justify himself.
And Steve did.
“Mex?”

But what was he without his armor?
“Fourty one.” He finished for him with an obvious expression, as if shocked by the fact that Steve didn't know the answer, “For a total of forty-two.”
Steve didn't catch the provocation. At least until came the time to put the tomato sauce over the dough. The fight was unfairly unequal and as a good strategist Tony immediately understood that he was at a disadvantage, but he could take profit from his total lack of decency and the height difference. So when Tony found himself stuck against the kitchen counter by Steve's imposing mass, he let him spread the sauce on his face and stoically endured his victorious expression.
Stark’s voice was flat, his gaze distant. He was good at it – hide himself, his feels. Even too good. Years and years in the media spotlight, Steve reflected sadly. If he hadn't been able to read him in his scent, he might have fooled Steve.
“Do you remember I am, like, a

“You look good on your knees.” He said taking the t-shirt from his hand.
The silence is now deafening. How peculiar: JARVIS’ voice failed to shut him despite its numerous attempts, while Steve's voice succeeded on the first try.
“More?” He asked, hoping to receive a clear answer.
Tony watched him emptying the bags with a hint of concern.
“From a physical point of view, I would be able to explain the presence of sharks inside a tornado Yet I can’t understand how is possible that the base of this pizza has been completely burnt while inside it has remained raw.”
"Well, thank God. The last resort was a shrink."

Tony's face opened in a downy smile as he approached.
His voice was cold, but a note of sadness was in his smell. It crept through the cracks in Tony's armor and came straight to his heart and it

But somehow, despite the digressions and the distractions, Steve managed to untie the skein of that story and understand something about it. He understood that Tony had spontaneously sacrificed his Marks to make amends after the events of Extremis. That this act had cost him a great deal, but that for the sake of his relationship with Pepper he considered it necessary. That apparently that sacrifice hadn't been enough anyway.
Rogers stepped back. If Tony had been

wasn’t like this, not in the way people thought. But clearly it wasn’t so obvious. And Steve didn't know if Tony understood it, or if he was acting like that because his inner Omega needed to take care of Steve to feel okay. But frankly Steve didn’t give a damn about the reasons: he just felt so good and for once he only wanted to enjoy the feeling.

Honestly, Tony would have expected everything but this.
Mimicking the same phlegm, Steve joined him.
Steve looks at him and for a moment Tony regrets the words. He’s an old fashioned man, after all, maybe he wants to take it slow. And it would be okay for Tony, in fact it would be perfect, really. He just hopes he didn’t ruin everything with his words, as he always does. Why does he have to be always so over the top?
He was there to fix things with Steve, to reassure him. Even if he feel absolutely nonsensical that he –
Tony got up from the tatami and pulled up his arms, stretching himself lazily. Steve tried not to get distracted by the elegant arch created by his back, and above all by the interesting counter-arch created by his ass. Because Tony had started to speak at supersonic speed – as usual – putting several arguments one after one – again as usual – and opening parentheses inside other parentheses with various annotations and appendices and “ah did I ever tell you about that time?” and going to end with a nice “anyway what I was saying?”. As usual.
. At all.
Oh God, he
Mottled roses and dandelions.
"He’s your best friend." Steve raises a hand to cup his face, thumb brushing over his cheekbone, "I don't want to be your best friend."
Steve frowned: “I'm not talking about money.”
“You know how saying goes.” He sucked his fingers and released it with a wet ‘pop’, “Go big or go home.”
This was not how he had imagined giving him that gift. But they were doing everything in reverse: Steve had offered him dinner, then Tony had invited him to his den, finally they had slept together.
. It's easy to not grasp certain nuances when you don't get to know the real man behind the armor, and Steve doesn't mean the Iron Man suit.
"Can’t argue with that."
"Tony."
And Steve knew he would stay there, irrationally, until he had Tony in front of him again, alive and whole. His sweet, spicy scent in the nostrils, and its sarcastic voice in the ears.
Steve asked himself too. But he was too afraid to find the answer.
But after all, when they were out of the team dynamics, it was entirely different. They could laugh and joke indulging in camaraderie, but then they were the only ones left to deal all with of this
“Tony.” Steve tried to touch him again, but this time the Omega jerked away.
. He wished he could say he was annoyed, but francly he was not. Rogers kept himself so respectfully in his own space that Tony couldn't feel harassed. And all Tony had to do was answer to Rogers’ doubts, give him the slightest reassurance, or even just ask him to leave him room, and the Alpha immediately fell into the ranks.
Tony shrugs.
He had given up being himself sixty years
Tony let him into the bedroom and did not stop to reflect on the fact that many people had been in his bedroom, but never an Alpha. No Alpha ever entered and the first was Steve. Steve Rogers. Steve was walking into his bedroom and Tony was getting obsessed with the meaning of it – and they hadn't even gotten to the most intimate part of the situation. He couldn't stop thinking about it or everything would be derailed and he didn't want to derail. He could not afford it.
Then Laura comes to ask Tony for something, and Steve just stays there. He watches Tony speechless as he walks away, the scent of flowers still in his nostrils.
has seen them, Tony. You want to destroy them? Then do it, and we’ll never talk about it again." Steve wouldn't want it, but if that's what Tony wants he would never stop him, "It’s on you."
Steve's heart speeds a little.
. But no resignation, that was not there. Steve would not have been able to say if the shy hope he perceived in Tony was directed towards himself or towards the possibility of recovering his relationship with Pepper. He hoped for the first hypothesis. And for more than one reason, which however he categorically refused to analyze at the moment.
“If we exclude any biological factor, what is left is this. And I'd be a bad doctor if I didn't tell you."
Tony forced himself to stand still. He was tense and there was no point in trying to hide it, but he knew that under the tension Steve would read more, he would read everything else.
“You never wanted Alpha in the way.” He said softly, insecure.
That Steve wasn't his Alpha, but Tony was still an Omega and no, he wouldn't have denied this in front of him. They had gone too far. And it was fine. Steve was fine. Steve had his trust, he had earned it.
"You'll take me for a completely lunatic." he muttered, rubbing his face in his hands.

"What?"

Tony, of course, is looking for words, but for once he can't find the right ones. So he just stares at him speechless, his lips parted and his eyes full of painful hope. Steve thinks he looks twenty years younger and can't believe he's the one who caused that.
For this he had stolidly ignored the Quinjet landing, as if he had not had an eye all the time on a holographic projection of the return journey. Again, he had stolidly ignored J.A.R.V.I.S.’ notification about Steve’s imminent coming down to the lab. A little less stolidly he had welcomed said coming.
"Thanks, but... it doesn't make sense?"
“So...?”
“What do you want me to do?”
Staring at him, Tony rolled his head on the sofa’s arm and no, he

to come near!"
If he doesn't remember what happened a few hours ago, Steve's warm body sleeping behind him would bring his memory back. And even if that wasn't enough, Tony would just need to move to feel his muscles screaming for revenge.
"Good morning."
With considerable effort, Steve took his eyes off Tony and raised them to Natasha, who was standing next to him, smug as always despite her bed hair and the fluffy pink pajama. He opened his mouth to answer, but was unable to come up with something that made sense, so he just watched her sipping her coffee slyly.

and more and more
"I mean, there was that time a few days before, too, when we first met." Tony is deathly pale and Steve is seriously worried about him, “But I just smell it. Does it count? I don’t know."
s all very interesting, really, but if you don't mind I have a couple of things to finish.
Steve nodded, but the red on his eyes did not retreat and Tony clearly saw his tongue sliding over his fangs. Fuck. Tony felt his blood flowed away from his face, his chest intertwined in an icy jelly and he was
Following his nose, Steve had turned his head on the pillow. Tony was curled up on a small armchair next to him, an tablet abandoned in his hands. He was visibly exhausted, with stubbles messing up his otherwise perfect goatee, and hair that had seen better times. It was gorgeous, Steve thought with a heartache. He would have happily stay there, simply admiring him for an indefinite time. After the experience of the last few days there was nothing more comforting than being allowed to bask in the presence of an Omega worried about him – in the presence of
“Tony, it's okay.”
“More.”
Later, much later, Tony will wake up in his own bed.

Steve didn't mind a damn how the average Alpha would react. He had never based his behavior on comparison: he could do better and he would have done it. But he also believed that at that moment Stark had no need of an apologetic scoffing Alpha: they were there to confront each other and, perhaps – perhaps, why not? – find in common ground. If they wanted to work together, they had to try.

Citrus fruits and cinnamon and a spike of
"Not a dream, though it feel like one." Steve lays his forehead on his and sighs inhaling the flowers scent, “I can see it. I always have. Can I‒ God, Tony‒ can I touch you?"
“Tony–”
It's known that Alpha's eyes change color according to their mood. Tony had had the misfortune to often see red eyes: first in his father, then in several feral Alpha who had clashed with him. Finally in Steve, every time he went down on the battlefield – and sometimes even during the quarrels between them.
Steve hadn't had a chance to explore that side of himself yet. Back in the forties, suppressors and inhibitors were outlawed in the United States, no one could silence their sub-genre as was customary now. It was considered an abominable, unnatural act.
“No no no no… Alpha, I'll be good, I promise, I'll be good... don't hold me down, I'll be good... see? I'm good, aren’t I? Don't hold me down, don’t hold me down, don’t hold me down…”
He stopped in front of him, looking down with a smug expression.
Stark crumpled the ice cream paper and he threw it in a passing basket. The fresh air of Central Park smelled of citrus, cinnamon and melancholy. Talking about Rhodes and the secrets Stark had to hide from him hadn't been the best of ideas. Steve bit the inside of his cheek and concentrated on the pain, chasing away any harassing drive that was springing up in response to Stark's discomfort. He had once ruined the situation, he would not have done it again, certainly not after Stark was the first to move towards a kind of reconciliation.
It took a few months to settle down before starting a sort of functional relationship that did not compromise teamwork. And as much as he was less than amused at first, Tony was sure that seen from the outside the situation would have been hilarious.
Up in the blue sky above the Avengers Compound there's Iron Man, dodging War Machine’s blanks with sleek maneuvers, and looking fabulous as usual, even if it's just a training session. A little less ‘sleek’ and ‘fabulous’ is the monologue that Tony is carrying on inside the suit.
“Did they know?”
“Variation” could have been that they didn't train at all, because Tony was busy with some project, but Steve – God bless that ninety years old grandpa trapped in the body of a God – found nothing better to do than to wander around the lab, asking Tony questions whose answers would have required an engineering degree to be understood, taking away his favorite snacks to replace them with more healthy stuff because “good heavens do you ever eat a decent meal?”, and finally resolving to stay in a corner with his drawing materials. And Tony, well, he did not know how to feel knowing that Steve was portraying him: after all he was used to being under the media’s merciless gaze, but Steve's gaze was different. In what way it was difficult to say – and above all to accept – but it was
But now that particular secret was out, filling with unspoken questions the void between the two of them. Steve couldn't help but be curious: Stark was a strange puzzle. Much of the frustration that had hovered over their first encounter was due to the fact that Steve just couldn't quite figure it out the man.
Except that, at the end of it all, when he and Tony are saying goodbye ‒ when Steve hears him talking about how he'd like to drop everything and build a farm like Barton did ‒ the wind blows between them bringing the smell of wildflowers. And when Steve looks at him, he thinks, certainly in a moment of total madness, that he shouldn't be surprised by now. He should expect it, to see wildflowers bloom and fade into Tony's hair.
Stark had just entered the room and Steve didn't need to turn around to find out. He was amazed that the others present at the table managed to maintain a neutral expression. The smell was
Tony uttered a shocked verse and put a hand to his chest, scolding at him.
“They don't work on me.”
"Stop feeling ashamed."
Opening a passage under that armor, so apparently harmless, and making his way, one drop at a time, filling the void until the pressure created dangerous cracks on the whole surface. This had done Steve from the beginning. Tony didn't know if he was aware of it or not, but he would have bet no. The fact is that now the armor was hopelessly cracked and it would have taken little – very little – to completely collapse.
“Believe me, I wish I didn't know. It does not concern me. It's like…” He clenched his jaw, fidgeting on his feet, “Like being forced to spy on other people's homes. But there is no way to…” He gestured vainly and finally shook his head, “To mute it. And I think it can happen again, because I just can't stop being like this. I'm sorry.”
Tony cocked a smile in Steve directions and waggled his eyebrows. He looked at him in confusion.

Faced with that spontaneous confession, Steve didn’t know what to say. His inner Alpha stepped forward and replied in his place, resuming his purr again. Tony shot him a puzzled look, an adorable blush that made its way up his cheeks.

If Tony paid attention he would notice that JARVIS sounds a little bit anxious, as far as an A.I. may sound anxious. But Tony isn’t paying any attention.
"Hi. Can I stay here for a while? I’m bothering you?"
“How come I always find you here?” He scolded him, “Didn’t you get pumped with serum in order to get out of of doctors’ clutches?”
Steve rolls his eyes at his usual self-deprecating sarcasm.
“Well I guess you'd know.” Steve said coldly, “Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.”
Tony nibbled his tongue nervosuly.
Steve frowned: “What? Why?”
“Your place or mine?” He asks, stepping out from the suit.

He nods: "Those ones."
Steve was the one good with speeches and all that kind of things, but right now he didn't have the words to express how he had felt. Waking up with the Omega safe and happy in his arms, feeling him languid with sleep, smelling his desire, hearing his sweet purring. Steve only knew that he wanted more mornings like those, possibly for a lifetime.
Tony watched amused Steve, who was carefully observing the various robotic tools moving out from the walls.
And then it was gone.

The rest of the mission was a rapid succession of events that dragged them into the usual adrenaline rush. The Maximoffs joined them, Vision came to life, Ultron's droid army clashed to the Earth. Steve didn't have time to really work out what had happened between him and Tony, that they were already on the battlefield.
"No." he blurts out both annoyed and horny, "I know you think I'm a hedonist, but  when I’m having sex my first thought is not looking in the mirror like a narcissistic psychopath."
Seems like Steve has his methods for managing the ‘day after’. That includes manhandling Tony to turn him around and plaster him on himself, just like a rag doll. Tony feels a bit insulted: after all he’s
How ‒ and by now Tony is talking while ostentatiously looking away, his cheeks tinged with red like the roses blooming in his hair ‒ only few people could see it.
“Yeah. Read my smell, then. Go on, Alpha.”
Tony had been doing this on his own since he was five – a lifetime – and had never felt the need to do it with anyone. He knew that many Omegas were happy to nest with other Omegas, or their Alpha – or anyone who lends themselves for the occasion. Omegas were basically the gregarious part of the dynamics, the glue between the sub-genres. But Tony had never had the privilege of being able to express this side of his sub-genre.

taken advantage of it. But, hey, it wasn't every day routine that someone actively cared about him. He was Captain America: everyone took it for granted that someone like him didn't need anything or anyone. So big, so strong, ever in charge.
"Hi Cap."
That was only the first of many disastrous DIY dinners that neither of them digested, as many trash films that they put on only to be able to comment out loud. If they had eaten well or seen a good movie, they couldn’t have spent those hours pretending not to wooing eachother. Because those evenings weren't dates, absolutely not. But that didn't stop them from flirting badly, unable to call things by their name and carry them on properly.

‒ can easily reduce a poor man into a state of pleasant but extreme exhaustion.
“Welcome back, Captain. Mister Stark is currently in the lab.”
He’s confused when Natasha asks Steve if he’d like to train with her and he answers that he just wants to chill reading. He even waves a book in his hand. But then what happens is that Steve goes down to the lab to do ‒ who knows what? The book is usually soon forgotten and later Tony will have to send Dum-E to return it to him. The rest of the time Steve just keeps buzzing around him, touching things he shouldn't touch, asking questions that distract him from his work. Tony appreciates the company, really, but he doesn't understand.
Only then did Tony remember how they ended up sleeping together. He remembered the night before, the nightmare, the panic attack. He remembered Steve, who managed to control his inner Alpha to help Tony without oppressing him. He remembered his own inner Omega asking for
“Well, you guess good.” Tony smirked, than read from another note, “‘Sorry.’ I must say, the breakfast with which you accompanied the shortest of your messages was the most glorious that has ever ended up in my tummy. And you must be flattered ‘cause you are not the first who has tried to impress me with a good breakfast.”

, soft and enveloping like the blanket. Tony wondered if even his own smell gave off quiet, because honestly he didn't feel completely relaxed in that new and stunningly beautiful thing they were doing. Yet, as he rolled up in a blanket like a human burrito and let himself go on the pillows, he thought that never in his whole life he felt better than now, with an Alpha in his nest-room. For once his brain slowed down a bit – just a little bit, huh – but still enough to appreciate the moment he was living, here and now, and not need anything else.

“From the beginning.”
“I don’t know.” Tony suddenly admitted, staring straight ahead.

He gets up from the couch, walking around the room blindly, the patch still pressed to his face.
“Talk to Banner.
"No? Why?"
Tony looked at him uneasily: “I should be the one asking.”
A grin spreads across my lips. "I do."
“Then thank you. Or you’re welcome?” He laugh slightly. “I’m still unclear.”
Scott stares at me, and I recognize the emotions flashing over his face. Pure and utter hopelessness. A desire to help. The ability to do nothing. Slowly, he nods, turns, and staggers down the corridor towards the left entrance.
It’s sort of a joke, but Sam nods solemnly.
“Me too.”
“What the hell are you guys doing? Do you realize how late it is?”
“Nothing matters!” he exclaims through a toothy grin, spreading his arms wide and nearly knocking down a couple bottles in the process. “Who fucking cares? Happy holidays, life’s a bitch, why not celebrate?”
“How much have you had to drink, Cap? I think it’s time to cut you off.” Before I can stop him, Tony grabs my drink off the counter and drains it all. This sends him into another wheezing fit. He thumps his chest a couple times.
“I dunno, five-ish?”
“The party, Tony,” I say.
Nurse Debby is in and out often, checking my vitals, checking my chart, talking my ear off about important things I wish I could tune out of...it's all just noise, anyway. It doesn't help that the painkillers they've been giving me make me too groggy to form coherent thoughts. All I can do is dissociate and stew in my irritation.
“Of course not! But you started it, so go ahead, why don’t you say what’s on your mind? If we’re so not-fine.”
⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅
I can’t for the life of me figure out what changed his mind about having guests over at his new house. Though, I can’t pretend I understand any of Tony’s decisions. That man is an enigma, with a sharp tongue and a penchant for flirting. Plus an ego big enough to fill up one of those suits of his. Sometimes I wonder what he actually sees when he looks at me.
“Pepper?” I venture, quietly, though the name still feels too loud coming out of my mouth. Tony doesn’t flinch.
“Sure.”
My head was already reeling a moment ago, and now it’s spinning out. Images of the party last night, of Steve’s face so close to mine, the kiss, the blurry aftermath… it all flashes in my mind and refuses to solidify. What happened after the kiss?
“How long are we going to keep doing this?”
Tony: Stop what? I don't know what you're talking about.
It's done.
Oh god, I’m an idiot. I’m an idiot, and I haven’t done laundry in so long, and what am I supposed to wear to a date with an ex-rival, anyway? Business casual? I don’t do business-casual. All my shit is either business, or casual. What is he gonna wear? He didn’t even tell me where we’re going, and when I texted him about it, all he said was “you’ll see”. You’ll see?! Unbelievable. The audacity…
"Honey, I don't have a choice."
The ceiling is failing, dropping large chunks of rubble that hit my shield with surprising force. I just let it rain. There is nothing in my head but the will to keep moving. To find him.
“Okay. Sweet. I’ll, uh…call you?”
So, he settled on driving instead. I’m sitting in the front seat, fighting every urge to look at him. He’s staring forward as well, I can see his white-knuckle grip on the steering wheel in my periphery. It’s deathly quiet in the car.
“You good, man?” he asks.
“You’re the first, actually.”
When I open my front door, the last person I expect to see is Steve “Captain America” Rogers. Well, maybe not last, but the odds are pretty damn low. His broad frame fills my doorway, and his dimpled smile fills my chest with warmth and dread. It’s a harsh reminder of why I haven’t reached out in months.
