Slowing his breathing, faking sleep, he focused on his other senses. He was obviously still in a bed, the sheets confirmed that much, and he wasn’t restrained in any way. Whoever was next to him hadn’t changed his clothes, or disarmed him either. Which meant either they weren’t afraid of him, they couldn’t be hurt by anything he had on him, or they were stupid. They were roughly the same height as him, male, had shaved recently by the feel of the stubble brushing against his forehead, they were wearing some sort of coat, a shirt and a tie judging by what he could feel, they weren’t scared judging by the steady pulse and they were the source of the scent.
-------------
The melody pulled at him, weaving around him and lulling him into some sort of trance. The pain from his injuries faded away to the back of his mind. There was a sort of musical undertone to the voice, almost like a flute, but surely that wasn't possible?
For all intents and purposes, he should be happy right now. He should be at peace. He was in Heaven for fucks sake, driving down an open road in his Baby, with a case of permanently-cold beer and fresh cherry pie. His Baby was running as smooth as silk, the sky above was clear and bright, and Dean Winchester
.” Charlie told them, throwing her arms up. “Dean and Sam may have only had themselves when they were younger, but ever since Dean was pulled from Hell, they found another. They’ve had their third for years now, and they won’t be at peace until they have him again.”
that Jack would love it, and was hit by the sudden remembrance that they
“Because I was afraid.” Castiel whispered. “Because the last thing I said to you…” He shook his head. “I didn’t want things to be awkward. I never expected an answer from you, and I didn’t want to force you into that situation. I know you don’t reciprocate my feelings, and that’s fine. I didn’t want an answer, I didn’t need an answer. So I thought I’d just stay away, make everything easier. That’s why I didn’t want to tell you that I was alive - because you’d feel obligated to give me a response and I didn’t want to disturb your peace when you finally had it.” Castiel sighed again, wrapping his arms around his stomach.
The three words that echoed in his head as Dean cruised along down the road, barely paying attention as he rounded a corner without even slowing down.
The Angel swung around, panic and slight fear in his eyes as they landed on Dean's incredulous face.
It had been almost four months by the time the topic was raised amongst the boys’ family.
They put their plan into action the next day.
He drove mindlessly, following the pull of his brother, until he came across a bridge that looked familiar. He pulled the car to a stop and got out, walking to the edge of the bridge to peer down at the tumultuous waters below him.
Dean frowned as they stopped in a field. “Charlie, what exactly….” he trailed off as he realised his friend was no longer behind him. He spun around in confusion, just in time to see a translucent barrier snap into place a second after the sound of wing beats filled the air.
Mary and John blinked in confusion. “Well then get him here then.” Mary demanded, before turning and walking off. John followed her.
Excitement and joy flashed across Sam’s face, before a small amount of hope joined. “Is - is Jack here?”
Dean was exhausted.
It took almost two days of the brothers and Bobby working together to find out what they were up against, and another two days to track down them down and kill them all.
Dean didn’t call him out, and instead did the exact same thing, painting on a fake smile, cracking some cheesy joke, putting on his music a little too loud. They both knew the other could see through their facade, but they kept it up, knowing that if they broke now, it would take too long to put the pieces back together.
“I didn’t start speaking again until I was assigned to a flight. I had to speak then, I didn't have a choice. It was required, in order to accept and give orders and work with the others in your flight. But I didn't speak outside of that. I stayed a loner, I stayed on my own. I didn’t approach anyone, and eventually, I developed a reputation for it. I was the friendless mute who thought they were better than everyone else. And because of that I isolated myself more. It was a cycle, a vicious one, and when the earth was created, I fled to it. And guess what I found down there.”
Hesitantly, he shifted away again, only to meet the same resistance, and Dean’s sleepy voice begging him to stay with him.
“And I’m sure I’ll love him when he arrives.” Dean replied, patting Sam on the shoulder gently. Sam nodded, breathing out and leaning into his hand a little.
Castiel bit his lip, a thoughtful expression coming over his face. Then, softly, as though he was scared that Dean would change his mind, he began to sing.
“You thought the second one would smooth things over.” Sam breathes in realization. “Make him think that it was for all of us.”
Michael.
“What was that?” Sam blurts.
This morning Sam thought he was acting weird, but they both chalked that up to Dean and Cass getting back into groove. Little did Sam know that getting back into groove involved a whole lot of grinding and a tonne more kissing. And also an undercover date that promises to be one of the most awkward things Dean will ever experience.
“Good.” Dean says, his voice overly chipper. “Then we can listen to some Taylor Swift and Lizzo.”
Watching Dean lube up his erect cock is a thing of beauty. Carefully, he settles against Castiel, moving his legs up to get better access. His cock is lined up with his hole and he feels the head slip inside. Dean’s lips cover his then, distracting him from the slight burn he feels. One hand reaches down to glide over his cock as Dean slowly moves in.
“Coffee?” Sam offers, wanting to break the silence between them.
“So we have the pearl.” Sam says, feeling as though he’s teaching an empty classroom. “We have you and Dean. You touched the pearl and strange things happened. I want to smash the pearl because I think it’s somehow malfunctioning. The only way it
“I know you’re in love with Dean,” Chuck says.
“Thank Chuck.”
“Hey Cass.” He drawls, slowly ascending from his sleepy fog. Cass has his hard dick pressed flush against Dean’s pant leg, the knee from his other foot rubbing teasingly over his own morning wood. His fingers trail a path over his collar bone. A glance to the side tells him that the angel watches him, just as intently as always.
A being... powerful and indiscernible to him is racing after them.
“Whatever’s wrong Dean, I promise you that we’ll fix it.”
“You thought-” Dean breaks off, his eyes swirling with emotion. Then he laughs. Followed by more silence. “You’re dead to me.”
The tension is thick between them. He can feel Dean’s indecision and his fear, it calls to him like his Dean’s had.
“Oh.” He says again, this time, in realisation.
“I’m not giving it to them. I’m hiding it.” Cass sounds proud of himself.
Sam nods, about to duck back into his room when his hair comes into view again. “Just so you both know. I am deeply sorry. I didn’t mean to meddle and I was looking for the spell so that I could throw it away. Just… sorry.”
Dean gets out and barely manages a smile to Donna before heading inside with Cass.
Cass peers at him hopefully.
He balls up his linen with a sigh and heads to the bunker’s washing machine.
“Sure.”
“Dean, I’m sorry.” Castiel apologies. He should have said it sooner but his fear had paralyzed him. “I swear I just– I wanted to be with you and that book it– It’s horrible.” He breathes. “I know I’m
Dean frowns and steps closer. “Are you good?”
Wordlessly, Cass twists the knife, sending streams of blood down his chest.
Shifting to the right, Dean pats the newly created space. “Come lay down with me.”
“Human feelings… emotions.” She lays a hand on his arm to get his full attention. “They’re complex and at most times confusing. Sometimes you think that you should be feeling something so you convince yourself that you are. Other times, you worry that you
Dean shurgs. “Whadda ya say Cass.”
Dean sighs. “That’s the only thing I have going for me.”
Cass nods. “We have to be quick. Who knows how soon he’ll find us again. Worse yet, if he finds Michael, he’ll know that something is wrong.”
He stiffens. “Jack is dead.”
He gives the pan one last scrape before deeming it unsalvageable, which is a shame because he knows it’s Dean’s favorite. Maybe he should buy a new one…
So the only thing left to say is: “Of course I do.”
Dean glares at him then.
Crowley shudders… filthy, unwashed oven mitts of hands.
“An angel man-child, baby in a trench-coat.” Dean corrects.
Frozen, he wonders what he should do. Scraping it off seems impossible now that it’s hardened. Dean will be livid when he sees. Castiel doesn’t understand how this happened. He’d followed
He grins slightly, “What? Colorado?” Dean laughs once more, but it’s breathless.
“I looked
“Just unzip the pants.” He whispers.
“C’mon.” he pleads.
Eyes still shut, he just nods feeling his emotions drag him under. It was too good to be true.
Cass may not have feelings for him, but something is still bothering him and now Dean knows better than to let that kind of hurt fester.
Turns out that second time’s the charm. Crowley actually manages to get inside his head. Of course, carrying Crowley outside would be a severe misstep and it goes against Sam’s knee-jerk response to deny the demon anything he asks.
It’s the last memory he’ll take with him into the Empty.
What kind of maniac even does that?
“I know.”
Yes, really Dean?! He screams internally, wondering why he’d even say something like that. “Uh, um, well, you only go… on a brate… with someone, if you’re already the bestest of friends. Even if you screw something up, you’ll just laugh about it.”
That’s when it dawns on Sam what this really is: a trap. And they’d walked directly into the web. It had been laying in wait for them.
Mom is here, which is a great relief. She’s managed to keep it together while Sam’s fallen apart. She packed the remaining, unscorched lore into the trunk. She thought about food, about getting off the grid.
Stiffening, he suddenly remembers where he is… and who he’s with.
“Assuming you aren’t lying to me… how do we send you back?” Sam questions, “We need to do it before my Dean sees you and wants to keep you.”
“Hey, did you drink my almond milk?” Sam demands, popping up from the fridge. So much for ‘supportive brother,’ huh.
“Oh, I’m mad,” Dean growls, his eyebrows creasing, causing Castiel to feel a whole new bout of panic.
changed him, made him into his own person, someone he could be proud of. Loving Dean is everything. And now he knows it too.
“Thanks Sam.” Dean slaps his shoulder on his way by.
“Me too.” Adam says. “We see something and we want it. Even if we don’t completely understand. You’re not alone in that Michael.”
“Cass.” He whispers breathing a sigh of relief as his blue eyes spring open instantly.
“I can’t do that to you. Just forget about me. Take care of Sam.”
And he means it, Castiel can tell. He won’t hesitate to drag them both down with him. Billie wouldn’t intervene. There’s nothing she wants more than to trap them in the Empty. They would be lost, their deaths permanent.
“Sure,” Sam says amiably, gesturing to the seat across from him. “And maybe you can translate what Dean was trying to tell me earlier?”
“Cass. Trust me. He isn’t faking this.”
Frowning, he wonders what brought this on. Why now? It had been years since Dean started calling him ‘Cass.’
“People don’t know that we’re brothers.” Sam says, logical as ever.
Sam’s eyes widen as something hits him. “How do you remember?” He asks cautiously.
“I know that you don’t appreciate me putting you in this position.” He begins, “And that you’d rather not do this on the whole. I appreciate the effort you’ve put in so far and I would understand if you didn’t want to continue.”
It smirks in a manner so unlike Cass that Dean is left doubtless.
He blinks them away, hating how his voice quivers when he speaks next. “Dean… I h-have to tell you something.”
“I know… it’s just.” He gulps. “I feel guilty. The other you… he really kissed me. And he said stuff.”
“Well, at dinner we’re going to be showing him that we’re still best friends – who aren’t sleeping together.” Dean explains. “And that there’s nothing for him to be suspicious about.”
“Sam!” he bellows.
I'm so sorry that chapters are taking longer now. Writing on my phone makes me feel discontented and frustrated. But I'm hoping to get a new laptop soon. Fingers crossed.
Cass is there. And he
“Dean.” He says softly. “If you’re going to say… what I hope you are…”
“What’s he saying?” The anticipation is driving Sam wild.
The simplicity of the plan leaves him with a lot of doubts. But if Cass is convinced that this is the right thing to do, what else can Sam so but comply. Cass is incorporeal in any case, he has to depend on Sam to do this.
Dean bides his time.
Bright, red eyes gleam at him and as he makes his way out of the smoke, a smile spreads across his face. “Sam,” he says in a gruff voice.
“I know.” Is all Dean says.
“Do you want to come inside?” Dean offers.
“Hey Cass.” He says as his friend pops his head inside. “The sheets are dry?”
Castiel awakens to a loud roar. It takes him a few seconds to realise that it’s the Impala’s engine.
Dean falls backward in shock, adrenaline finally giving out. “Sam.”
“Yeah.” But his voice comes out rough.
“I’ll show you passion.” He presses another kiss to his hair.
Cass still looks uncomfortable though.
Dean's fingers curl around the wheel.
He loves Dean. He loves Dean with all that he is and all that he has.
“Adam.” Michael manifests himself. It’s dangerous to ignore the physical world and be here like this. But he needs to know what’s wrong. “Adam?” he shakes his shoulders gently.
They’re too much like them… they’re too real for Dean to kill them.
Sam makes a noise of agreement, “It’s called ‘I Will Go Down With This Ship.’”
“Cass.” He calls. When Cass doesn’t answer Dean contemplates tossing his dirty sock on the angel’s head. His aim is good enough to do it and he’s pretty sure
Cass perks up slightly, so Dean takes that as a good sign. “And – oh – this is the good part. We were talkin’ bout Themla and Louise and Bert and Ernie … last night on earth. I was supposed to get you laid, but a failed epically. It
Rolling his eyes, Dean points to his lips, “Now dumbass.” He huffs, “Try it out on me. A moan is good. A gasp is better.”
Most of all, he hates Chuck, for making him fall in love with someone he never thought he could have, and for forcing him by proxy, to give it up for ‘free will.’
Sighing, Dean twists slightly to look at his eyes. “I’m guessing you came in here to
And worst of all. Michael is back. Pounding away. Back from an eternity watery grave only to be welcomed to the eternal migraine.
“Relax.” Dean cuts his tirade off. “I have a plan to fix things. He doesn’t know anything concrete but we can throw him off.”
If only.
Now it makes sense. Sam’s mumbling. It was probably the spell, masking their essence even from him.
“Why?” he repeats this time, even he can tell how pathetic the word sounds.
be it.” His voice cracks.
“That was a nice moment you had upstairs.” He announces, purposefully making Dean fumble.
Dean isn’t there.
Castiel pushes himself to his feet, crinkling his nose, which causes a bout of pain. “Ugh.” He groans, reaching up to touch it. No doubt, it’s red and blotchy now. He spares a half-hearted glare at the door.
“Well… I’m teaching Cass how to sleep.” …
He scoffs at Dean’s expression. “What can I say? You’ve given me my true calling in life.”
If you want something happier, feel free to check it out.
“Why do you think you aren’t together Dean?”
Gulping, he watches the door to the garage close gently. He’d disappointed Cass. He’d disappointed himself.
“I’m larger than three hump back whales.”
And the look of happiness on Cass’ face leaves Dean shell shocked. Never, never ever has Cass looked to at peace, so free. Like a burden has been lifted. Just saying it made him so happy that he fulfilled his deal.
“You’ve come for me?”
He rifles around on the ground, cursing some more as Sam’s name lights up the display.
The next earth is quieter. They find a version of Sam and Dean who have retired and rest peacefully at a small fishing cabin. Dean sees the framed pictures on the wall. Of him. Of Sam. Even some of Castiel. But the angel is nowhere to be seen.
"No. No, it's okay Cas, we just weren't expecting you." He held his hands out in a placating gesture. He slowly moved towards the angel, unknowingly slipping into the role he took when trying to calm victims of monsters. He sank down to sit on one of the beds and patted the cover next to him. "Sit down." He clarified when the Angel looked at him, confused.
Then, as if pulled by a magnet, they crashed together forcefully, sweeping across each other with all the passion of decades of pining. Their hands closed into fists, tugging and pulling as if trying to merge their bodies into one. Lips parted, tongues entwined, breath was stolen. One of them gave a quiet moan, another whimpered softly, both noises swallowed into the kiss.
“By the amount of flashes, probably about four or five.” Castiel replied, and Dean groaned, turning his face to hide in the angel’s shoulder.
Dean didn’t know the language, but he closed his eyes and let Castiel’s voice wash over him, soothing him and calming his mind.
Dean shouldn’t want to take that from them.
“I missed you.” Jack breathed, and their arms tightened slightly.
“So who is this ‘third’ then?” John asked scornfully, and Charlie and Jo facepalmed in unison.
at Castiel wrong.
By the time their tears had dried, the sun had sunk low in the sky, and their muscles were starting to protest against their position. Slowly, they began to untangle themselves, stretching their muscles out and wincing as joints popped quietly.
Jack thought for a minute, and then nodded. “Yes. Yes, that wouldn’t be interfering.”
Cas didn’t stop him.
Sam’s arrival was announced by his voice calling Cas’ name, broken in disbelief. Cas looked up at him and smiled, his face streaked with tears. He beckoned for Sam, and the younger hunter crashed into him and Dean, his own tears spilling over as the gap in their lives was filled again.
Slowly, he went to move Dean’s head to rest against the pillow, so he could lie down properly, but as soon as he shifted, the hunter’s face screwed up and he clung to the angel.
“In which case,” Castiel started, a smirk starting to form on his lips. “I might leave now, stay away for a few weeks, until it all dies down…” He started to move, as though he was about to fly away.
Dean hated himself even more when he saw the hurt he’d been carrying around slip into Sam’s features. But he hated the comfort he felt in that most of all. Hated that it eased the weight on him a little to see Sam sharing his burden.
The angel looked to be on the verge of disappearing, his flight or fight instincts seeming to have kicked into overdrive.
But it wasn’t perfect: it couldn’t be. Not without Sam. Not without Cas. Not without Jack.
A thought came to him, brief and fleeting, but it stuck, and Dean swallowed before voicing it.
The angel froze, staring at Dean with wide eyes.
“Is he - Is he a good kid? Live up to his namesakes?”
Dean slowly moved towards the door, straining his ears, everything in him drawn towards the voice. Some part of his brain was screaming at him to draw a weapon - that this couldn't possibly be a good thing, but something else, deep down, calmed. This was a friend. It said. This was safe.
They all lingered in his mind, sometimes just at the back, a strange sense of awareness that they
A grin spread over Dean’s face, and he put his bottle down, throwing a salute at Bobby. Then, he walked purposefully over to his car, sliding into the driver's seat.
The others turned back to stare at Sam and Dean.
Those days, he remained alone. He didn’t want to burden his friends - his family - with his grief.
Sam was happy. Sam had a life, a family, down on earth.
The other three nodded and they started to walk off - together, like they should be.
At the contact, Castiel's eyes moved back to his face for a moment, before he let out a breath, his body slumping.
The two of them froze in that position, staring at the other with wide eyes. Castiel nervously wet his lips, causing Dean’s eyes to flick down to them for a moment before meeting his eyes again.
Bobby, Ellen and Kevin went to the location to set up the summoning for Castiel.
Dean wanted to interrupt him, to back up Gabriel’s words, to hold Cas tightly and take all the pain from his face. Deep down, his opinion of Gabriel jumped up a notch. Obviously he wasn't a complete douchebag.
They'd driven up to the town, interviewed the witnesses, looked over the dead bodies, checked out the crime scene - business as usual - and that's where things became strange.
For a second nothing happened, and then the barrier wavered slightly before collapsing. When the particles faded, a single teenage boy stood there, biting his lip and glancing at the three men with barely hidden want.
Dean knew that questioning him probably wouldn't help matters, but the curiosity was eating at him, so he opened his mouth and took the plunge.
“We missed you too buddy.” Dean replied, grinning at him through his tears. “Look - we know you want to be hands off, and we get that, but that doesn’t mean you can’t come visit us right? I mean, we’re already dead, not like you can really change our lives anymore.”
Dean smiled down at the waters. “Good.” He said softly, before they fell silent again.
Angrily, he jerked the wheel, sending his Baby flying around another corner, the beers rattling together in the back, refusing to acknowledge the tears blurring his sight, because Cas was back, Cas was alive, and apparently wanted nothing to do with them anymore.
Castiel blinked. “You...You
Jack was happy. He had Cas, he was in Heaven, he was helping people and keeping the worlds at peace.
“Jack!” Jody exclaimed, clutching one hand to her breast as she slowed her breathing again.
“I love you too.” Castiel breathed against his lips, and a second later they were kissing again, and one or both of them were crying, and it was everything Dean had ever dreamed of and more.
Bobby smiled wryly. “Never. In fact, I’m pretty sure they take the word ‘impossible’ as a challenge.”
Dean shook himself out of his confusion at the scared look on the angel's face.
Castiel swallowed hard, screwing his eyes shut in pain. “Of course I couldn’t even do that.” He whispered, his face crumpling.
Dean let out a sigh and opened his eyes. Sure enough, Castiel was the one lying next to him, looking down at him with a raised eyebrow. His right arm was wrapped around Dean’s waist, the hunter had an arm and a leg draped over him, and Dean’s head was resting in the space between the angel’s shoulder and neck.
—————
It only got more complicated from there. The case was a winding road of monsters apparently working together, and old legends that tied buildings and places and people together in a massive spider web of deaths and disappearances.
He was getting his brother back. A smile tugged at his lips.
him to sing was still lingering, as well as the emotions that revisiting his past had stirred up.
, other than maybe Sam or Bobby, should have been able to approach him in his sleep without him realizing.
Ellen turned to Sam, a concerned expression on her face. “You good?”
Dean felt his body slump as he listened, the tiredness of the past days returning. As his mind slowed and calmed, his eyes became heavier, and his muscles relaxed. His head fell to the side, landing gently on something firm and soft, and he gave into sleep.
The angel’s breathing caught in his throat, and his hands instinctively rose to rest on Dean’s waist.
“I don’t know what’s up with them!” Mary exclaimed after a few minutes of silence. “I knew Dean was in a strange way, but I was sure he’d be fine once Sam showed up!”
“Cas. Stay.” He whined sleepily, pressing his body further into Castiel.
Sam gave a wan smile. “Thank Ellen, but I’m fine. Just a little overwhelmed.”
“What is it?” He asked urgently. “I can fix it!”
Dena sighed. “You assume too much.” He said bluntly, and Castiel gaped at him. “First you assume that you can’t have what you want, then you assume that Sam and I wouldn’t tear the universe apart to try and get you back. Then you assume I’d feel uncomfortable around you. Then you assume I don’t want you in my life. Seriously Cas, maybe you should stop assuming and let me speak for once.”
Castiel closed his eyes and cursed in Enochian.
me to sing?” He asked, as though he’d never heard anything like it before.
“I mean, I’d always kinda expected it ya know. You being an angel and all. Higher being aren’t you, why’d you give a damn about two broken humans who keep breaking the world? We cursed everyone we touched, either scared them off or ended up killing them, obviously you’d leave at some point, but the way you did? I mean seriously Castiel, that was a douche move. You could have at least told us that you were leaving. Had to find out third hand that you didn’t want anything to do with us. Could have at least told us yourself ya know.”
Dean couldn't help his reaction. A growl came from deep in his throat and his hand tightened around Castiel’s almost to the point of pain. The angel glanced up, startled, but gave him a soft smile.
And not exhausted as in, 'I've-done-some-strenuous-activity-and-I-kinda-need-to-sleep" but exhausted as in 'I've-been-awake-for-96-hours-non-stop-and-I-am-dead-on-my-feet.'
The angel smiled wryly, one hand tapping lightly on his knee. “I almost wish it had stayed like that. Afterwards, it all started up again. They’d bully me, team up and pin anything bad that happened on me. If something went wrong, it was always my fault. They’d mock me, insult me, pick on me. I was their plaything, their punching bag.” He sighed softly, his hand pausing in its tapping to absently raise up and rub lightly at his upper arm. “Gabriel always told me that they were just jealous, and to ignore them. That they didn’t like me because I was different, because I was better.”
“The fact that Team Free Will always has been and always will be a
He had drinks with Bobby and told him about their lives and the people they met (“You better not have replaced me ya idjit.” “Never Bobby, never.”)
Dean groaned and thumped his head against the mattress he was half-lying on.
They both had bad days, and Dean showed Sam his grove pretty early on. It became an open secret that if the brothers disappeared, that was probably where you’d find them.
For the first time during his story, Castiel met Dean’s eyes. “Music. Songs. Humans who found ways to weave such ordinary sounds into so many beautiful melodies.” Castiel’s eyes took on a far-away look, as though he was remembering them. “It reawoke my love for singing, but these songs were so much better than those in Heaven. I was scared to sing them, because I knew if I tried to, I’d ruin them. So I settled for listening. I listened and committed them all to memory, so I could play them over and over again in my head. I tried to figure out why they were so much better than Heaven’s songs, but I could never figure it out until recently.”
Castiel let out a quiet laugh at the hunter’s dramatics. “Come on, surely it’s not that bad?”
The second thing he noted was the scent. The smell of pine and woodsmoke lingered on the sheets around him, and he breathed it in deeply, turning his face to nuzzle into his pillow. That was another thing he wasn’t exactly used to - cheap motel rooms genuinely didn’t smell very nice.
Castiel didn’t say anything, just gestured weakly for him to go ahead.
The sudden noises woke Sam up instantly, and he shot up with a gun in his hands, only to blink at the two men groaning and rubbing their heads.
They stood in silence for a few minutes, the tension between them steadily climbing, before finally a sigh broke through the quiet.
----------
“But, I messed all that up didn’t I? I thought I’d make you uncomfortable. Why would you still want…..?” Castiel stuttered, seemingly unable to get his words out.
----------
A choked noise escaped Castiel’s throat.
"My brothers and sisters would always complain or make fun of me when I did it. They'd tell me they couldn't concentrate because of the noise or that if I liked it so much I should go join the choir and how that might be an upgrade since I couldn't fight anyway, or that I should shut up because I was better not seen and not heard." The angel took a shaky breath. "At first I just brushed them off. I liked singing, so why should I stop? But it just continued and continued and more and more angels joined in. Eventually…I just…stopped. Realized that they must be right. I put more focus into my battle training, kept to myself, buried myself in jobs and training. At one point I stopped speaking altogether. Went mute."
“I didn’t know it was possible to be depressed in Heaven.” Ellen murmured quietly, her eyes fixed on the two figures leaning on the car outside. Her gaze rested on their stances, their positioning, the space that always lingered around them.
That was another thing - he had a home now. A home he made for himself, because he wanted to. A home he built from his memories and his dreams.
“Hello Dean.” Castiel spoke quietly.
Dean snorted again. “Sam and I have depression.” He said bluntly. “We’re in Heaven, and we have fucking depression.”
Slowly, the two of them started leaning towards the other, when a groan from the other bed had them shooting apart as fast as possible. Unfortunately, they’d forgotten where they were, and the sudden movement caused the sheets to tangle around Castiel’s legs. He lost balance and tumbled onto the floor, landing in a mess of sheets and blankets. Dean, shooting backwards, banged his head on the wall and then fell to one side, knocking the lamp and books that had been on the side table everywhere.
“Good.” Sam muttered, before pulling away and clapping a hand on Jack’s shoulder. The other two pulled away as well, though Dean’s arm remained wrapped around Castiel.
Dean blinked. “What?”
, sometimes a constant ache that had him strangely silent and distant. Sometimes, there were days where he couldn’t think of anything else, when he turned to remark something to Sam, when he held something up to show it to Cas, when he found something and just
“Cas?” The angel glanced over at him in questioning. “You said you’d memorized the music you heard when you came down?” He nodded, frowning. “Will you sing something for me?”
Ellen’s concern didn’t let up, but she nodded and stepped back to let Dean lead Sam out of the Roadhouse.
“Are you satisfied that I’m not an enemy yet?”
Dean sat in silence for a bit, and eventually Castiel continued.
Cautiously, he continued forward, closer to their door, and it got louder. He moved slowly, keeping his breathing quiet and even, and eventually, it formed words.
Slowly, not daring to make a noise unless the singer heard him, Dean pushed the door to their room open. It swung inwards, the carpet luckily muffling the noise, and he slipped inside, placing the bag down silently.
Sam nodded fondly. “Yeah. He does. He’s heard stories about both of you since he could listen. I think it became his goal. To live a life that you could be proud of him for. To be worthy to carry your names. He’s a good kid. Brave, selfless, caring, determined. He’s a warrior, but with a heart of gold.”
They were finally at peace.
Eventually they broke apart, pulling back the few inches needed to breathe. Neither could make themselves go any further. Their foreheads pressed together, their bodies stayed firmly entwined, and for a while they just breathed.
The young God looked around at them. “Sam, Dean and Cas are my parents.” He said firmly. “I want them to be happy.”
A second later, Dean and Sam crashed into their son, wrapping him in their arms tightly.
Dean raised his head to meet Castiel’s eyes. “You have met my brother and Bobby, right?” He asked in disbelief. “They’re going to be teasing us non-stop for months!”
Eileen distracted Sam, waiting for the call to take him to the agreed upon location.
Until they found the shapeshifter skin. And the missing hearts of the victims.
Their lips brushed together softly once, barely there, just testing the waters.
Dean laughed suddenly, forgetting that Sam wouldn’t know. “No, no, Sam. No, Heaven’s changed a lot since our last visit. When Jack took the reins he came up and fixed a few things up. Got rid of all the walls and separate Heavens and mixed everything together. Just one big Heaven now. Everyone together, everyone got their own small bit, but it’s all part of one.” Dean grinned at his brother. “Everyone’s probably waiting for you back at the Roadhouse. Bobby knows I’ve come to get you so he’s probably gathered everyone together.”
He asked himself bitterly.
Cas was happy. Cas was back in Heaven, back in his home, and he had Jack now.
Charlie dragged Dean away to ‘show him something that he absolutely had to see, seriously it was awesome!’
“Then why didn’t you?” Dean asked, not lifting his eyes.
"D-Dean." The angel stuttered out, backing away slightly. "I-I di-didn't sense you coming."
“I love you.” Dean whispered softly, his heart in his mouth as he finally let the words pass his lips.
“Our best friend?” Dean told him, an exasperated look on his face. When Castiel gave him a blank, expecting look, he groaned. “You, you idiot!” He yelled, reaching forward and shaking the angel.
“Well I wish they wouldn’t challenge this one.” Ellen sighed again, shaking her head, and thumping the bar angrily.
Sam got a similar greeting to Dean, with a similar reaction to his apologies. The only difference was that after hitting him, everyone sat him down and insisted he told them about his life and his family - something Sam was more than happy to do. By the time he’d finished, Dean was feeling a mixture of pride that his baby brother had such a great kid, and regret that he hadn’t been there to help raise his nephew.
“I guess I took the wrong message from that. Instead of being proud of who I was and standing up to the others I tried to fit in. I looked at what they did and I tried to copy them. It still didn’t work though, and I gave up. Became numb to it, became used to it. I think some part of me started believing that there was something wrong with me, that I deserved to be treated like that. That everyone else was right and I was wrong.”
The thump caught the others’ attention, and they made their way over, following their gaze and spotting the two Winchesters.
“You did Cas.” Dean replied gently, squeezing his friend’s hand again. Castiel’s eyes moved to his again. Deep inside them, the hunter could see something vulnerable. There was something in there that was cracked, broken, and Dean felt an overwhelming urge to do anything to fix that, to take away the pain. “Honestly, I think that was some of the most beautiful singing I’ve ever heard.” Dean thought back to the moment he opened the door and awe swept through him again. “It was...I don’t know how to describe it, it was just awesome.”
John shook his head, placing a hand on Mary’s shoulder. “I don’t get it either. They’ve always been fine with just each other, I don’t understand why they’re being like this.”
“And he’s no doubt already sent them to at least Bobby, so deleting them won’t do anything.” His muffled voice bemoaned his fate.
Sam muttered something that could have been "food" or could have been "shoe" and disappeared down the corridor.
The two boys who stumbled into the motel, injured and groaning, were running on adrenaline, caffeine and quite a large helping of stubbornness.
Jack gave a shuddering sigh and clung to his fathers desperately. Cas slipped into the tangle silently, burrowing under Dean’s arm and wrapping his son up, hiding him away from the world.
They stood for a few minutes, before Dean broke the silence. “How’s your life been Sammy?” He asked quietly, staring out at the river below them.
“You see, if you’d actually given me time to respond.” Dean continued. “Then you’d have learnt that my silence was actually due to the shock of knowing that my feelings were reciprocated.”
He even saw his Mum and Dad a few times, though that was a lot more awkward. Mary didn’t want to talk about hunting, John didn’t want to admit that he was wrong with how he raised his sons, and Dean didn’t want to admit that any stories he told would probably upset both of them. They ended up either talking about the far past, with his parents telling their childhood stories, or talking about here and now in Heaven. Dean didn’t spend much time with them. He had his found family, that was so much better than his blood family.
The space that was supposed to be filled by a dark haired, blue eyed angel.
The humans nodded slowly, and Jack smiled. “Good.” He said happily. “You summon Cas then, and get Dean there. Afterwards, I’ll erect shields so that neither of them can run away.”
Sure enough, Castiel stiffened again. His eyes darted away from Dean's, searching the air.
Who knew that all it took was three measly words to completely break the great Dean Winchester?
“When humans sing, they put their heart and soul into the music.” The angel whispered, his eyes focused on Dean. “They show their true emotions, and that makes their music special and beautiful. In Heaven, they just repeat what they’re told to, there's no feeling to it. That’s why human music is so much more than Heaven’s. That’s why it's so beautiful.” The angel smiled again. “And, I wanted to try that. I can’t express emotion very well, I don’t understand it, but...music I can do. So I wanted to see if I could show emotion through singing instead, to see if I could get even a fraction of the beauty of that music I heard.”
Almost instinctively, Dean covered his hand with his own. Logically, he knew it wouldn't stop him flying away if he wanted to, but it felt nice, so he didn't remove his hand once his brain registered that fact.
“We know them well enough!” Mary snapped. “It’s not our fault we were killed!”
Castiel warily made his way towards Dean and sat down next to him. He no longer seemed to be on the verge of fleeing, but Dean could see that he wasn't calm.
"Cas?"
Once Charlie was in sight of the small field they’d set up, she sent the notification to Kevin, who then started the summoning.
Dean dragged his feet in the other direction, towards their room, the go-bag over his shoulder seeming to get heavier with every step.
Castiel looked away, but Dean could see the redness creeping up his cheeks. It was adorable, he thought, hiding a smile.
Charlie met his eyes through the barrier, smiling sadly. “I’m sorry Dean.” She whispered. “But we had no choice.” With that, she left.
That didn’t help the feeling of eyes on his back, a familiar weighted stare seemingly cutting right into his soul.
Then, he would get up, scold himself for thinking like that, and go out to the Roadhouse to chat with the other dead hunters - because even in Heaven, the Roadhouse was a hunters bar.
“Yeah, Cas.” Dean said slowly, wanting to try and hammer the fact through his skull. “How many times do we have to tell you - you’re part of our family. Surprise surprise, we want you in our Heaven.”
Suddenly, all of Dean’s emotions broke free. Surprisingly enough, anger and hurt were the most prominent ones.
Donna hummed in thought. “Do summoning spells work in Heaven?” She asked no one in particular.
Tears welled up in Dean’s eyes, and it was a few minutes before he could speak again.
He was almost to his door when he heard a sound. It was quiet, soft, so soft that at first he thought he was hallucinating. Nevertheless, it made him stop for a second, frowning.
And they had somehow got close enough to him in his sleep that he was cuddling them.
The brothers had been given the hunt that they had only just finished four days ago by Ellen via phone call. A hunter had come across it but was already halfway through a hunt of their own, so they'd given her the details and she'd passed them along - a few people killed in mysterious ways inside locked buildings, strange corpses and witnesses who were "obviously" crazy. Pretty standard for their line of work.
“What was his name?”
He heard Castiel’s breath hitch, felt his muscles spasm under his hands, felt the shaky exhale against his skin, but he refused to open his eyes. He felt braver in the dark, things felt easier when he couldn’t see Castiel.
At first, they'd thought it was a witch. Hex bags were found near all the crime scenes, and that would explain the locked doors and strange circumstances of the deaths. As far as they thought, it was a cut and dry situation.
"I don't tend to nowadays." He muttered under his breath. "I used to do it quite often, it helped when I was stuck on tedious jobs like archiving." His nose wrinkled slightly. "Archiving is the worst."
“Stupid.” He muttered to himself, pulling the car to the side of the road and hunching over, his hands pressing into his eyes. “Stupid. What did you expect? He’s a freaking angel, Winchester. And now he’s back in Heaven, he’s back in his home, with his family. Why the hell would he spare a thought for a broken human who can’t even survive three weeks without him babying you?” Furiously, he brushed his tears away and straightened up, taking a deep breath and letting it out. There were people here he needed to see. People he needed to apologise to for a start.
Everyone grumbled a bit, but obediently started to leave, until Sam, Dean, Ellen and Bobby were the only ones left.
Sam moved into Dean’s house. Neither of them had to discuss it. They’d always lived in each other’s pockets, and Sam had never lived alone in his life. Plus, with Cas and Jack’s absence an aching gap in their lives, the two of them leaned on each other even more.
Sometimes he went for a drive, just letting himself get lost in the road and the music. Sometimes he went to a grove he’d found one day and just sat, letting everything pour out of him before bottling it back up and going home.
He was in Heaven. He might as well make the most of it.
After he spent some time just swallowing that news, Sam hitched a smile back onto his face. “Come on, I wanna go say hi to everyone else.” He called, his voice a little too cheery, a little too upbeat, as he headed to the Impala.
"I didn't know you could sing?"
“Well yeah, you’re missing a pretty vital component.” Dean told him, to which the angel’s head snapped upwards.
“Why Cas?” Dean asked quietly after a few moments of silence. “Why are they better?”
“Dean.” Castiel said firmly, cutting him off. The angel sank down opposite him. “Dean, no. No, you don’t understand. That’s not - I don’t - ” he sighed in frustration. “I wanted to come to you.” He said bluntly, tugging at his hair in a very human move. “As soon as Jack pulled me out, I wanted to go to you.”
Nodding, Cass grins, standing on the bed and jumping up and down. Dean laughs again.
“Hey, can I talk to Sam?” Dean calls through the radio. “Update him so we can start looking. I’m sure he’ll get his shits and giggles out of this one.”
Cass really seems to be enjoying this, which comes as a surprise. It’s rare that he gets a nice, slow blow job. Then again, this isn’t some dark alley and Cass isn’t some chick who’s half drunk.
He smiles at the memory, thinking how his heart had soared at the words. If he’d had his wits about him, he would have assured Dean he felt the same. That he would do anything, kill the world and himself for this human.
She knocks twice firmly. Nothing happens so she presses an ear to the door. Hmm, still quiet. The door opens abruptly, causing her to jump back in fear.
“I know.” Dean says, glancing to his side, where Sam assumes Cass is standing. “But you’re the one doing it. Not Cass. Sorry Cass.”
controlling this.”
“It’s funny how nice things can be when you don’t have to worry about time.” Cass muses, “We can stay here for days if we like. We have no duties, no disasters. It’s just us.”
“You have to kill me before you get into that box.” He growls.
“Do you have friends who do those things Dean?” Cass’ voice shreds his resolve.
Dean clenches his fist. “I don’t know.”
“You wouldn’t do what needed to be done anyway.”
This time he gets a broken off moan for his efforts.
’ floods through his speakers.
They sit in silence for a while, Castiel too angry at Dean to even consider his next move.
That makes him wince. He nods, slightly less enthusiastically than before.
The ghost has his heart in his hands… the only thing connecting it to Dean’s body is a pulsating chord. Sam can’t even find his voice to scream before a piece of iron comes flying, dissipating the ghost’s form. Dean’s heart, it literally drops… along with a sickening squelch that has Sam flying forward.
“By we, I mean me, you and your broken hearted boyfriend.”
“Dean and Cass.” He makes a swooping gesture, “Having a week of guys’ night out and racking up points with the ladies.”
Castiel freezes, cheese dripping off of his finger.
“You talked to Cass, huh?”
He shuts his eyes.
“You’re a real jackass Sam.”
“Castiel.” Her eyes shine with wonder, “I’m honoured to meet you.” she thrusts her hand out, “I’m your number one fan.”
Castiel struggles to figure out his friend’s reaction. What he’s thinking.
Cass to apologize.
He doesn’t want to carry on a conversation after that. He wants to just lie here and mope.
Dean gets in Baby, feeling comfort in the dependable, unchanging purr of her engine. Damn, he needs this. Something dependant. At least she wouldn’t fuck him and duck him.
He channels his anger onto Dean. “I see
“I liked you better as adults.” Dean copies.
“What does the other lore say?”
for the brothers who left him to rot and the angel who left him behind.
Dean presses his eyes together.
“I just –” His voice cracks and he takes a sip of his beer almost as a reflex. He can’t have this conversation without a buzz. “I couldn’t go through with it – not
He’d give almost anything to have that now.
Dean’s adult mind would immediately recognise the ‘you know who’s as ‘Dean.’
Sam closes his eyes and thinks.
“Wrong again,” Crowley murmurs.
What makes him suspicious, is that Michael has restricted them from speaking with Adam for the duration of his trip under the guise that it would endanger them. A flimsy excuse, if you ask him, but, of course, Dean hadn’t asked him.
“What?” Dean stares at him, aghast. “You can’t tell me that you support what I did… how I must have made you feel.”
“Heya Cas, I—listen I just wanted to uh…apologize I guess, for what that shifter did when he, um, looked like me.” Castiel blinked at him, confused. Dean was good at self-loathing, it was true, but surely he didn’t blame himself over Castiel getting captured.
The words felt stuck in his throat even now, but he forced them out at last. “I don’t love you either, Hannah. Not the way I’m meant to.”
be your hammer again.” He didn’t sound happy. His voice was nearly a hiss, and Dean felt horribly guilty for pushing Cas when he was so clearly unwell.
“Hey,” Dean breathed quietly against the shell of his ear, “‘M not going to be summoned away this time, I promise.”
Dean considered it longingly, before ultimately deciding against it. “No,” he answered, trying to keep his teeth from chattering, “there isn’t a good vantage point from the car. I’ll be fine; I just hope this guy transforms soon.”
Me: Shhhhhhhhh.
The reddened tips of his ears gave Dean away as being much more similar to Castiel than Hannah, in this regard. Lips parted slightly, but closed again without forming any words. The slight furrow at his brow suggested an internal debate.
“Everything,” Darkness answered, coaxing a swirl of colorful dust to become the first star.
“Nothing, I just…” Dean pinched the bridge of his nose and took a deep, slow breath. His frown slowly dissolved into a more neutral, if a little weary, expression. “Hannah seemed melancholy this morning. I had hoped to make a sweet we enjoyed together as children.”
“Welcome to the club.“
“Who knew such a lovely ceremony would be so exhausting?” she joked. “I don’t know about you, but I cannot wait for the feast to start.”
“You’re very beautiful, Hannah,” he told her, and although it was said with conviction, he hoped that it would be understood as a flirtation instead of a compliment to a dear friend.
Dean considered this as he scrutinized Castiel, presumably for some hint of deception.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, Cas, listen—I’ve spent my whole life hating myself for my mistakes okay, I know what it feels like. And you, you don’t deserve…you deserve to know how important you are to all of us, to…to me.”
Once Continental was being tended to by the stable boy, Castiel returned to the castle quickly in hopes that preparations for dinner had been started. Initially, he had planned to seek out Hannah; although his usual means of working through his troubles had been thwarted, perhaps it was worth at least entertaining the idea of asking Hannah about her expectations of him outright.
Dean should have said something. He should have grabbed Cas by the shoulder, turned him around and talked himself hoarse until Cas understood how crazy it was to think he was worthless. He
If that someone ever became known to him, he’d send them flowers.
“The dream world a Djinn creates often plays on very vulnerable aspects of the victim’s life,” Castiel reminded him. “It doesn’t strike me as odd that he’d be reluctant to discuss what he saw with us.” Angel as he was, there was no telling if Djinn magic would work on Castiel in the first place, but he was in no rush to find out for sure. The thought of being given the things he desired most, even if only shoddy imitations, and then having them snatched cruelly away again was gut-wrenching. Better to live in ignorance than with the haunting ghosts of his deepest desires fulfilled, Castiel guessed.
Against his skin, Dean’s fingers flexed and spread wide. The hand dragged downwards, sweeping slowly over his scapula, his rib cage, the dip of his lower back, his ass cheek. Like when he’d presented for Dean on his first day here, Dean squeezed the plush roundness of his backside under his fingers. If Castiel paid close enough attention, he could feel the slightest tremor in the way the fingers curled, like they intended to squeeze harder.
“Ready?” he asked softly, pressing back just enough that the head of Castiel’s cock pressed bluntly against where he was slick and open.
Warnings from Dean forgotten, Castiel had wordlessly followed Sam back into one of the corridors. Sam had aimed his flashlight forward until it landed on a pile of skin and bloody residue from the shifter’s previous disguise. He had stepped forward to take a closer look and had heard the rattle of chains before one of his wrists was cuffed and his angel magic rendered useless, and then Sam had struck him and the world had gone black.
“This morning, in the kitchens—I wanted to apologize.”
Tearing his eyes away from Dean’s turmoil, Castiel rushed at the cackling manifestation of Michael, intending to disrupt the magic with physical force. To his dismay, Michael simply evaporated into fog where Castiel made contact with him, sending Castiel careening none too gently onto the floor. Wincing, he sat up in time to watch Michael regain a solid form without so much as a sideways glance. Brow furrowed, Castiel got to his feet and summoned his blade with a flick of his wrist.
“That’s it,” Dean encouraged breathily, settling back against the mattress and using his hands to help guide Castiel’s hips. Castiel’s eyes were closed, but he could feel Dean’s boring into him, studying him.
“I could hurt you,” he argued. As far as kinks went, choking was not new to him; he’d had more than one owner get off on having their fingers around his neck, cutting off his air supply. Castiel hated it. He hated the dizzy, panicked feeling, he hated the fear that crept in at the edges and made him wonder if this was how he would die, he hated the feeling of helplessness.
The cheerfully surprised expression Hannah had worn smoothed into something warm and fond. “Join me,” she said, indicating the space beside her on the chaise longue. “Would you like a cup of tea? I’ve come to find chamomile especially soothing before sleep.”
"Off eighteen, huh?" The just-slightly-too-innocent lilt to his voice made Dean think Gabriel knew something he didn't. That rarely boded well, but before he could dwell on it Gabriel went on. "I've never brought a stray to the vet," he said, "but if I had to pick a preferred one, it'd be the one off eighteen."
Without his grace working there was little he could do to hide the very human flush that crept it’s way up his neck. His eyes remained steady, however, because this wasn’t Dean. He didn’t want this
You have no idea how much time I spent fighting the archive about getting those text messages indented properly, please applaud.
a wedding would require less effort than planning one) for the Unity Ceremony. On the rare occasions that Hannah had left his side, Dean had usually gone with her, resulting in the maddening contradiction that Dean’s presence always coincided with an utter lack of freedom on Castiel’s part to take advantage of it.
“…Do you really mean that? I’m…important to you?”
show him where Dean was.
Castiel’s faintly blue grace danced through and around the equally eager, iridescent lilac of Hannah’s, until the two colors were indistinguishable from one another, a shifting, colorful aura that surrounded them.
Castiel peered intently at the commotion around him, eyes chasing after a tendril of Djinn magic that flickered briefly into his line of sight. The bluish thread of light danced elusively, tauntingly, at the very edge of his field of vision, weaving in between a cluster of activity clearly imbibed with poison. Castiel reached out for the small fragments of magic and clung as best he could, willing the tug behind his navel to propel him forward. It felt rather like relying on a few bits of thread to keep him from pitching off the side of a cliff, but eventually, haltingly, he moved.
Still, each retelling had one notable thing in common: the sleeping princess and the person who woke her always fell madly, deeply in love.
“Well, Cas,” Dean said cheerily, “Let’s go home.”
Dean felt his heart race, but without warning, Castiel pulled abruptly away. Dean opened his eyes to find Cas staring hard at the werewolf’s house.
“You kept up with me well,” the man remarked from behind him, “but overall, your swordsmanship is lacking.” The words were spoken conversationally, consideringly, as though they were old friends instead vanquisher and vanquished. “Identify yourself,” he urged next, tone more stern.
“For what?” Dean laughed breathlessly, and Castiel registered the slight tremble in his thighs and his ragged breathing. “It’s incredibly attractive.”
“The child is without a match!” Light pulsed angrily, furious with Darkness’ carelessness. “She is one soul extra, doomed to wander the Earth in vain for a complement that does not exist! She must be struck down lest she upset the matches we’ve predetermined.”
“So,” he said, standing straight again and turning to the real Hannah, “How exactly does this work?”
The next day, Gabriel was still in no condition to come to work.
“Of course not,” Rowena affirmed gently, moving to stand in front of the window. The early afternoon light pouring through the colorful glass bounced off of Rowena’s decorated gown, sending pinpricks dancing around the room. “The creators are beings removed from the very concept of existence as we know it. It would be impossible for any other being to truly know and understand the intentions of something so omniscient, so unfathomable, so
name on the marriage certificate."
A hand cupped the back of his neck and Castiel blinked until he could see Dean sitting beside him, eyes sharp and hungry in the dim light from the window.
“Dean.” Castiel put a hand on his shoulder to stop him leaving. Dean turned to face him again and Castiel didn’t really see the point in bothering with words. There would be time for words later. Now, he stepped forward and pressed his mouth gently to Dean’s, waiting for reciprocation. He didn’t have to wait long, and soon arms were around his waist and Dean was kissing back, shy but earnest.
“Sam?”
“You have to find out what Crowley wants with that book,” he tells Sam.
This exact conversation, but Dean had cut Cass off before he could continue. Because he’d been too caught up in himself to see that his friend had something important to tell him. And by the look of it, Cass is expecting a repeat of that time. Dean feels his heart wrench at his friend’s expression. He put that dazed, off-kilter look no Cass’ face.
Oh God, the door knob is rattling and he hasn’t even made it past step two. He chucks his phone under the bed hoping that Cass is too distracted to notice the glow.
“Yes.”
“What’d you do with it then?” Sam wonders. The trench coat is iconic in his eyes. Cass is naked without it.
“How?”
Michael stepped closer, laughing mockingly. “I don’t really get it, Dean,” he chortled, stepping into Dean’s personal space, “Is it the naughtiness of it that gets you off?” Michael stuck a finger into the waistband of the panties and tugged so that it snapped cruelly back against Dean’s skin. Dean held his glare even as the red on his cheeks deepened. “Or the lace, maybe? Do you get hard for silk but not for cotton?”
The cat finished its meal. Gabriel reached out to it, cooing encouragingly until it stepped forward to sniff curiously at his fingertips. Apparently reassured about any immediate safety concerns, it rubbed its cheek against Gabriel's palm, chirping quietly.
“Even if I did know, and even if you could make me tell you, what could a shifter possibly want with an angel tablet? Are shifters allowed to become prophets? I was not aware.” Despite his pain Castiel spoke evenly, jabbing at the shifter’s pride. He may be captive, but that didn’t nullify his experience as Commander of the heavenly garrison; he knew how to hold his own as a hostage. It was only a matter of developing a strategy and waiting for the correct moment to make a move.
“Don’t, Dean,” Cas spoke normally now. “You don’t need to console me. I’ve failed, many times, and I must accept that as a result, my brothers and sisters no longer wish to be associated with me.”
Before he could stop himself, Dean had placed a hand against Cas’ jaw and plunged forward, catching Castiel’s pink mouth insistently with his own. He kept himself pressed against Cas until he needed to breathe, and when he pulled away Cas wore an amazed expression. He brought his own hand up to cover Dean’s and leaned into the touch gratefully.
“I’m honored to be called upon, your majesties,” she greeted, smiling amicably, “What can I help—my, my, you’re both in quite a state, aren’t you?” Her eyebrows rose high as she stepped forward to survey them more closely, the expression dramaticized by the colors artfully applied around her eyes.
“Focus,” Dean chided, though somewhat breathlessly. Castiel strengthened his grip again, shuddering every time Dean hit the right spot. Heat pooled in him and threatened to overflow. “Wanna—knot you—”
“I am,” Castiel replied honestly. He had intended to elaborate, but everything he could think of to say would either give away too much of the truth or be an outright lie.
“Go.”
With a dull
The Sam-shaped shifter sneered at him, lowering the flashlight and moving into Castiel’s personal space.
“What are you making?”
Sam gave him a disgruntled look. “It was an
Well, it looked like he might be following the same sort of imaginary path that Castiel often found himself wandering down at wholly inappropriate times after admiring Dean for too long.
?” Sam spoke up, finally.
And if Dean thought Castiel was nice to look at and selfishly wanted the opportunity to look a little longer, well. That was incidental.
Castiel huffed and returned his blade to its place inside his coat, filing the bittersweet information away to review later. On the one hand, his inability to interact with the Michael manifestation suggested passive magic, which meant the Djinn he and Sam had finished off was well and truly dead. On the other, it meant that Dean was trapped here until he could recognize the hallucination for what it was, thereby dispelling the magic himself.
Sam’s fist sailed through the air in a practiced arc, landing mercilessly against Castiel’s already aching jaw. His face snapped to the right with the force of the blow, knocking against his raised arm and jostling the chains that held his wrists in a too-tight grip above his head. His chest heaved and blood began to slip from the new cut on his bottom lip, surprising him—human punches shouldn’t hurt an angel, even if the punches came from a giant like Sam—before he recalled dully that these chains bore angel-warding sigils, which was partly the reason he was stuck here in the first place.
Dry dishes quickly found their homes on the shelves and then Castiel was nearly sprinting away from the kitchens in search of Hannah. He knocked frantically on the door to her bedchamber, already plotting the next few places he might check should she not answer.
“Think of what you’d like to see, and look below the surface.” She spoke absently, looking not at him but peering intently into the lake, as though she could see the bottom. “For example, it would be helpful to know where Dean is.”
When he was out far enough that the water lapped at his tail bone, Dean paused and let his fingertips trail gently along the surface, looking pensive. Castiel shifted his weight, leaning slightly forward around the trunk of the tree, and to his horror a small branch broke under his knee. Though the forest was by no means silent, the snap was a thunderous echo to his ears, announcing his hiding spot.
“Can’t wait any longer,” Dean growled into his ear, biting carelessly up and down the side of his neck. The fine tremor was back again, this time evident in the way his jaw twitched against Castiel’s skin when he bit down.
Sam’s laughter (or rather, a crueler, colder version of it) echoed for a moment, followed closely by Jack’s curious voice asking
. You deserve better.”
Castiel got to his feet with a heavy sigh. Dean would need space; he could give him that for now.
Neither of the other occupants seemed interested in or, indeed, even aware of the bizarreness of the space, however. Approximately thirty feet in front of him, Dean stood near a dingy, gray couch across from the young form of John Winchester. Castiel recognized anger in the set of his jaw, but the challenging, near-mocking stare was gone. Instead, Dean glowered at the ground in front of him, his shoulders hunched.
Castiel raised a skeptical eyebrow. “So…this lake shows you the future?”
Admitting it felt like exhaling; like breaking the surface after being held underwater too long. Another tear tracked down his cheek and he swallowed around a relieved sob.
It occurred to him that he could just keep squeezing. He could squeeze until the life left Dean and then he could take whatever valuables he could find and disappear. He would never have to see Crowley again, would never have to deal with shitty owners, would no longer be bound by a contract, would no longer be property. Maybe he could find his previous owners and choke the life out of them too.
It was customary for a prophet to be present at the birth of a child.
“It shouldn’t be necessary,” he said, giving the other two what he hoped was a reassuring smile, “but perhaps check on us in an hour or so, just to be safe.”
He drained the last of his champagne as the auctioneer brought his gavel down to declare the current bid concluded. Dean recognized the man; Crowley was a smooth-talking, self-serving bastard, well-known by criminals for being a man of many talents, nearly all of which he used for evil. Dean had fenced several pieces through him over the years—despite his obnoxious arrogance and condescension there was no one better for a secure and anonymous sale—and was not even remotely surprised to find him contributing to the sex trafficking industry.
me, and when you talked about dying to help stop the Darkness, I just…fuck, if you were gone, Cas—“
When the other man danced into his line of sight—infuriatingly light-footed for all that he matched Castiel in stature—Castiel lunged forward with a roar, worried for himself and for Princess Hannah and desperate to land a blow. His opponent bounced to the side with a reproachful tut; before Castiel could collect himself and face him once more, a solid heel struck at the backs of his legs, sending his knees to the unforgiving stone floor. Without so much as a second for Castiel to blink away the pain, the swordsman flicked his blade against the side of Castiel’s throat, warning him not to rise.
More research was necessary. They’d also need to suss out how the poison was able to linger so long after the Djinn’s death, but one problem at a time. First, Dean needed to wake up.
, no less—while she was none the wiser became a horrid, guilty knot of regret in his chest. His feelings in that moment, and certainly his actions as a result of them, solitary though they may have been, were a betrayal.
Drugs helped with the sadness, but not the loneliness. Cas sought comfort from the women in the camp, indulging himself in their soft breasts and warm bodies. He knew they were lovely women, physically and otherwise. He supposed if he cared to try, he could form a strong connection with one of them, but if he was honest with himself he didn’t want to try. So Cas went from woman to woman, burying the physical evidence of his loneliness inside them until it went away.
Sam gave an aborted nod and, as he ushered Jack out of the room in front of him, a particular look that he’d taken to giving Castiel in regards to Dean more and more frequently over the past few years.
“Dean…”
Dean couldn’t help the bounce in his step as he turned into the alleyway to find Sam leaning against one of the buildings.
When he looked at her, Hannah looked just as dazed and overwhelmed as he felt. He squeezed her hand under the table.
The drive home was silent. They arrived at the bunker just as the sun was coming up, and Sam yawned before announcing that he was going to bed. Dean and Castiel followed behind him towards the bedrooms, each disappearing through his respective door.
The drunken, disappointed grumble belonged to the real John Winchester.
“Castiel?” Princess Hannah asked, voice barely above a whisper, sounding awestruck. Castiel nodded, offering a small smile. She returned it, stroking a thumb softly over his cheekbone.
Though he couldn’t see the crowd outside, he heard their excited murmurs as they gathered below the balcony, waiting for the ceremony to officially begin.
“So far, you seem trustworthy,” Dean said, “but I need to be sure. I’m going to touch you, and I need you to keep completely still; can you do that?”
Castiel sat up, blinking away the last bits of sleepiness and smiling across the hideout at Hannah, who sat calmly in front of a small amount of food. He really was glad for the company.
“Hey,” Dean says as soon as they enter his room. It’s the first moment of privacy they’ve gotten since Crowley’s arrival. “Can we talk?”
“No.” Dean admits. “Separating… this from our normal interactions is hard. I like this too Cass.” He divulges. “Way more than I thought I would. I like being in bed with you, waking up to you when I fall asleep. I like that I can show you things and let go with you.”
She moves behind him  to rummage around in the pile of dirty laundry and tosses aside a few pieces. Cass grins up at him cheekily from his hiding spot and laughs.
Sam frowns and leans in to look at Dean’s hair.
“This isn’t real.” He growls past the pain.
“Like eating burnt beet.”
But that would mean opening up… telling him that Dean may or may not have feelings for him. It’s hard to come to terms with the fact that he might well have to say that out loud. To Cass. And possibly face rejection before his wheels even left the ground.
A freaking king sized bed.
I'm sorry. I'm not dead. Just having a rough go
Sam winces. “About that…”
“You know. He’s just… missing.” Dean glances over to Cass. The road is empty anyway, and his hand is firmly gripping the wheel.
“I’m not leaving you in here then.”
Dean’s hand closes around itself and he hears Sam drop onto his knees from the exertion of housing a cosmic entity.
Glancing down he rubs his fingers across the title.
“Oh from the way you two look at each other.
Crowley is out here doing the most isn't he 0;)
“Is that Casa Erotica?” He pouts slightly. He’s still dying to watch that tape. It’s said to have some of the greatest compilations known to man.
“You know how stubborn I can be?”
who wanted to scream them, if only to free them from the box. He berates himself for not chanting them, along with Dean.
“Sure.” Dean says easily.  “Just scream when you find him.”
Maybe he can just be there. Hang around and take Dean’s mind off of whatever’s bothering him.
“Giving you this pleasure, it seems to be an aphrodisiac for me as well.” Leave it to Cass to get all philosophical in the middle of sucking his dick. The angel gestures to his tented pants.
“No we didn’t.” Castiel agrees, slightly amused, slightly sad. Dean won’t be around tomorrow to pay that bill, but he won’t say that. “But I suppose going out to get the mail is the only thing that gets us out of the house.”
Sam has to save them like they always save him. But first, he needs to find a way to pick himself up. His mind and body ache terribly. He simply doesn’t have the will to carry on.
“Good.” Says Castiel again, “Bolp bliort bi-en cocasb io-iad”
“Okay.” Jacks says, “But… you have to know… I brought him back for you.”
“This is real buddy.” Assures Dean, still making no move to get up, “How can I prove it to you.”
Dean chuckles at his discomfort. “And who’s in the mirror jackass?”
“Just wanted to know.” He murmurs.
“First thing on my to-do-list.” And surprisingly, the grin on his face is genuine, as well as, he likes to think, the one Crowley returns. One drink and he’s already sappy. He must be losing his tolerance.
