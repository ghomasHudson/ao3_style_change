Sherlock yelled as he got out of his chair and stomped loudly on the floor, as if coming toward the stairs. A high-pitched giggle was cut off as the upstairs door slammed shut.
Wiggins nodded. “I ‘ears ya, Doc. Lemme take care a’ this.” And, with that, Wiggins slid away through the empty, foul-smelling alleyway, a homeless General marshalling his equally footloose troops in a campaign to liberate a captive or injured ally. John just hoped they would be in time.

He waved to me as I felt myself gently drawn back into the tunnel of light and deposited into the parlor at 221B Baker Street with a headful of questions. It was dark. The curtains were drawn, cutting off the light from the street lamps outside. There was absolutely no sound inside. Even the street was unoccupied. It was eerie and far too quiet.

“THEY TRIED TO DROWN YOU, SHERLOCK!” John protested. The Security guard just looked nonplussed by the whole affair.
John felt like he was about to burst. Feelings threatened to overwhelm him without cause or warning. He clenched and unclenched his hand in silent agitation.
John couldn’t help but observe.
“Fine, then
Sirens had aroused Sherlock from his after-dinner reverie. Without a word between them, Sherlock and John slipped on their respective coats and trotted down the way to where multiple panda cars sat with their lights strobing. Crowds were already beginning to gather, jostling each other for a better view.
John finally let out a deep, resigned sigh. “Yes, Sherlock, I’m here.”
John nodded. “Good plan.”
There was a sharp rap at the door of the suite. John took his precious time levering himself out of the low chair and, stopping first to run an appreciative hand over Sherlock’s bare arse and throw a silk robe over him, sauntered to the door and opened it. Standing in the doorway were two men in dark suits, conspicuous for their strange apparel in the heat of Florida’s summer. One pulled out his ID and John read it closely. “Yes, may I help you?” he asked, innocently, because, for once, he was.
John and Sherlock both stared in awe at the little girl who suddenly seemed a whole lot older than her actual years.
“All the more reason for killing you, then, for all the problems you have caused me.”
“Really, John?
…” He kissed Sherlock’s temple as he held him close.
John followed his gaze, then quickly stashed the knife on the counter behind him. “Sorry.”
Things were getting unpleasant. John and Sherlock were only unlocked, one at a time, to allow them to toilet themselves in a pail in the corner, which only increased the repugnant smell in the room. Combine
John tried various permutations. “Close, but not quite, Sherlock.”

“That was uncalled-for, John,” Sherlock growled. “At last observation,

Bet yer boyfriend don’t get much fun outa you! It’d be like getting’ fucked by a pencil!” He roared his laughter at his own puerile humor as the homeless network started to converge on him.

“Mm mmm, should I move?” John mumbled, his face almost buried in the sheets. “’m I too heavy?”

“Well, I assigned Donovan to take care of Whitey, who, by the way, is singing like a canary and pleading with us to ‘keep that mad bloke away from me.’ Did you actually threaten to kill him, John?

John swallowed with difficulty as he continued, “They called the Child Protective Services in to evaluate our home. Dad lied, Mum said nothing, and I was threatened with physical violence if I told. They said that, without physical evidence, they couldn’t do anything.” His voice caught. “Even my broken arm was written off as a sports accident. They

Bracing himself for the next onslaught of blows, Sherlock was surprised to hear what sounded like a battering ram slamming into a wall in the front room. Once. Twice. Thrice.

John nodded. “And that, my dear Wiggins, is why we’re going to try to lure him out here and get the drop on him.” He reached around the back of his waistband and pulled out his Sig for emphasis. “No way we’re going to let this bastard get away with doing anything to Sherlock. If he’s got his phone, then something bad is already in progress, because Sherlock would rather die than part with that phone.”
Sherlock’s bum carefully settled onto the pillow, adjusting itself for comfort. “Yes, please.”

John stopped all movement in sudden concern. “Are you all right, love?” he murmured. “Am I hurting you? If so, tell me and I’ll stop…”
“With everything in the status quo! It’s fine if I take care of your daughter while you work and go out with your friends and with women, but God forbid I should ever want anything for myself!” Sherlock yelled, his face turning pink in anger. “If you didn’t want anything with me, then you shouldn’t have offered!”
Sherlock nodded and, after carefully extracting himself from the padded chair, limped into the back bedroom. A voice drifted out through the partially-closed door. “An ice pack would be nice, too!”

“Do you want to get a cab, Sherlock? I think it might rain, and you’re carrying Rosie,” John suggested as they exited the restaurant.

of their faces and, with a confused look on his own, said, “What?”
A door opened, somewhere in the back of the flat, and out strode one John Watson, looking very pleased with himself indeed. He sauntered over to the sink and filled the kettle, his plan to make enough tea for himself and his flatmate, who had still not emerged for hibernation. He hummed to himself as he worked, reaching up to grab a couple of mugs that his tall flatmate had graciously placed on a shelf almost out of John’s reach, just so he could come over and fetch them for him. John never quite understood why until, one day, he realized that this was Sherlock’s excuse to rub up against him “innocently”. That was the day they had sat down and had a long conversation, resulting in the activities of last night.
“Mm hm.”
“And you’re willing to put yourself in the line of fire…”
...John downed the rest of the glass with one gulp.
“Aw, fuck, baby, if you keep doing that I’m gonna lose it,” he moaned. “Get up here.”

It’s going to hurt your brother, your parents, and your limp-cocked lover every bit as much as it hurt you. And they’ll pay to suppress it, believe me.” She laughed softly and leaned in to kiss his ear in a mockery of intimacy. “And, as for you, well, you’ll never think of having sex in the same way again. Once you’re of no further use to your good doctor, do you really think he’ll stick around?” She laughed harshly.
“Damned dog,” Lestrade muttered before yelling, “Toby! Get the hell down here!”

The rest of the evening was spent in a lively discussion, of sorts. After a gin-and-tonic or two out on the balcony, John made a statement to the effect that he could hump a hole into the mattress right then. Sherlock, righteous man that he was, noted that the mattress had done nothing to merit such abuse and was, in fact, a very young mattress with a lifetime of good works ahead of it. This irritated John, who asked since when Sherlock had taken to the defense of mattresses and asked if he would be willing to put his money where his mouth was, in essence. Sherlock stated, in return, that it was always his pleasure to do so, but, as they were talking about mattresses, not fellatio, they should stick to the matter at hand.
A gentle smile adorned his lips as his eyes rose to meet John’s. “I know, John. You told me so, remember?”
we could have evacuated them properly, but some of them were a little too close to crucial brain structures to attempt.”
“I hate it when you say that, you know,” he grumbled, walking past John’s chair.
“Where did you get...” John started, weakly.
“A flawed man, John, deeply flawed. I am a recovering drug addict who can’t ask for help. If you had not shown up when you did, I would have been a relapsed drug addict, possibly a dead one. I can’t bear emotional pain as others do. I am largely still estranged to most emotions except for the ones you have taught me...”
“He knew the victim had been shot before anyone else did.”
Sherlock nodded, even though Sergei couldn’t see much better than
The door burst open and a cadre of men boiled into the room. Sergei yelled in surprise as strong hands pulled him away from Sherlock none-too-gently. He let loose a stream of epithets that truly impressed Sherlock as he felt solicitous hands removing his cuffs and re-clothing his lower body.

John’s shoulders drooped and he released Mycroft’s lapels. His head dropped, along with his eyes, in defeat.
The smile faded as the adrenaline wore off and he began to think more clearly. He had just beaten a man to a pulp and enjoyed it. Enjoyed it. There was a violence inside of him that scared him, that made him afraid for Sherlock. Just imagine if that had been Sherlock. Instead of bumping him aside, I might have attacked him, injured him, and I would have enjoyed it. He shook his head. I’m a monster inside a very small, angry man. He deserves better than that...better than me.
“John?” A deep, familiar, and still somewhat-groggy voice queried through the open bathroom door.
John nuzzled the side of Sherlock’s head and kissed him. Sherlock relaxed even more, practically melting against his partner.

“Where the hell did he come up with ‘trumpet flowers’?” Lestrade mused aloud. “I mean, if we can’t link these flowers to the murderer, we have no case.”

“Not at all! I still have some cleaning up to do in the back. You three can sit out here and eat. You have the place all to yourselves!” he gushed, winking at the little girl, who giggled, spilling gelato on her robe in the process.
Sherlock smiled ingenuously. “I have a perfectly good bed for that...”
She smiled. “Not really. Sometimes we have to find our answers anywhere we can. So, what role does Sherlock occupy during these times? Who initiates; who suggests trying new things?”
“I always give you a bath on the days your daddy works late,” he countered, smoothly, as he picked up the rubber duck and squirted her with it playfully. She squealed in protest.
“Some fucking detective

John painfully sat up and Sherlock helped him place some fluffy pillows behind his back. John jerked his head to the bedside table. “Lube in the drawer. The rest is my job.”
“You deserved it. John is lying here, facing death...”
Lestrade screwed up his face and said, “Oh, God, what an incredible smell you’ve discovered!”
Sherlock mock-pouted. “Tired of me already, John? Maybe I should have held out for

John acted as though he had heard nothing until a bullet whizzed over his head and embedded itself in the floor. Predator and prey both looked up, astonished, as Mrs. Hudson gestured, two-handedly, with John’s pistol.
“Ha!” Sherlock laughed in derision. “John would sell me out in a heartbeat. He stays because I pay him well and he loves to fight. Other than that, he is tedious. More your style than mine.” He turned his head away and sighed dramatically. “What I have to endure...you have no idea.”
Long, agile fingers froze in mid-text. After chewing on his lower lip for a moment, Sherlock responded, “I have no idea what you’re talking about, John. Is this some sort of fantasy that you…?”

John smiled awkwardly down at him. “I really

“Well, Wiggins called ‘anonymously’ about where to pick up Whitey James—by the way, you didn’t have a hand in what happened to him, by any chance, did you?” Silence. “No?

Rhythmic smacking/thumping sounds with increased squeaking.
After a minute’s silence, John said, “I couldn’t.”
“Saucy git,” John muttered, as he wiped his chin dry. His pants now barely held back a screaming, striking python waiting to be liberated. He looked around to make sure they were unobserved, then stealthily slid his free hand underneath Sherlock’s greatcoat and, wonder of wonders, found that the detective’s pants were waging an
“Mmmmph.” Another wiggle, this one of possible anticipation.
“Aw, crap,” John muttered, finally putting it all together. “I’m a bloody idiot.”
Sherlock chuckled mirthlessly. “I don’t indulge in that sort of pettiness, John. No, I take drugs to dull the pain, to put reality at a comfortable distance. In my case, it would have been used as anesthesia. You see, John, I am an imperfect man. You use sex to cope with your pain, while I resort to chemical means.”
It seemed to go on forever, this battle, but it couldn’t have been more than a couple of seconds before John was in the water, too, striking at Sherlock’s attacker and loosing his hands from around Sherlock’s slender throat. A set of small, strong hands grabbed Sherlock by the collar and dragged him to the surface, where he sucked in air like a drowning man, which, in fact, he was. He finally regained his feet with John’s assistance and waded toward an exit door, where they were met by a Security guard who had seen them on closed-circuit TV. They were immediately taken to Guest Services and questioned, after being offered towels and, ironically, something to drink. They were also Breathalyzed, which came up negative.
John nodded. “He is, but he’s…indisposed at the moment. May I tell him what…”
Their eyes locked and open to each other’s scrutiny, John moved his free hand to Sherlock’s cheek, first touching the bandage he had placed there, then laying his palm flat against Sherlock’s cheek, their faces close, their breaths mingling…

There was a touch of amusement to Sherlock’s voice when he said, “Yes, so I heard. I got the full story from Billy after the fact. He said you went from ‘Doctor Watson’ to full-on ‘Captain ‘I’m-going-to-blow-your-face-off’ Watson’ in record time. He said it was breathtaking to behold.” He smirked. “Wish I could have seen it. You know how I love your ‘Captain Watson’ voice.”

John’s face must have been red and his gaze intense, like my own under similar circumstances. “Do you know which car struck intentionally versus which one was the accident?” No one met my eyes except Lestrade, who stared as if he had, well, seen a ghost. “Are you all blind? Look at the skid marks! The first car was the accidental strike! The man was still alive when the second car veered sharply to hit him! That’s the murder! And when did the bullet hit?”
Mycroft lifted his eyes as he tapped into mental recall. “Your father was an uncouth beast, an alcoholic, who became a soldier so he could beat up people with impunity. Why your mother married him is still a mystery.

, god help him, that John had just melted into a gooey puddle of adoration. Their lovemaking had comprised mostly of kissing, fondling, a blowjob, and a handjob, both of which were done with extreme enthusiasm on the parts of the parties involved. There was also much cuddling and many soft whispers and giggles exchanged thereafter, leading to a lie-in of massive proportions.

Returning to the parlor, John gently unfurled the comforter over the recumbent blue bundle of anti-joy on the couch. It barely moved as the coverlet settled about him except that strong hands grasped one section of it and pulled it tightly over its face. With a smirk and a chuckle of determination, John plopped down on top of the form and tightly surrounded it with his arms and legs while resting his chin on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Is that what’s going on here? Am I being used as leverage? I noticed your tone changed after he punched me. Quite unlike you.”
An officer ran into Lestrade’s office breathlessly. “Inspector Lestrade, we’ve just had a suspicious hit-and-run called in! They’re asking for you!”

“About time you two showed up,” I huffed as Lestrade and John dismounted from the panda car and hustled toward the corpse. “I’ve already studied the scene and formulated a hypothesis before you had even left Scotland Yard!”
A shake of the head, as if to clear it. “Sorry, sorry, drifted off there for a moment,” he apologized, yawning slightly. “Getting a bit late, y’know.”
Just then, the thin bobbling sound of an ambulance siren became audible, growing louder by the second. “About fucking time,” Lestrade groused. “Sherlock, how are you holding out? You need a blanket?”
John jolted in his seat. Sherlock slid down in his chair, shoulders hunched, face buried deep in his book...
Long, agile fingers pulled at the hem of John’s T-shirt, unceremoniously dragging it over his head and throwing it to the ground. John was having trouble untying the knot on his pajama bottoms, but Sherlock made a disgusted sound and snapped the tie in two, ignoring John’s squawk of protest. Strong hands pulled the pants down his legs and off his feet, where they disappeared under the covers.

in this one.”
“Like a freak,” Sherlock agreed morosely. “That’s what they call me at Scotland Yard.”
“Moriarty. I warned you there were people after you, Sherlock. The demons beneath the paths we walk. Yours isn’t dead.” He paused. “Yet.”
John appeared at the doorway. “Well, hello, there! Didn’t anyone hear me call?”
“John, I don’t think the neighbors need to hear this, hmmm? And
Reaching out to the box, John flipped the switch to ‘ON’ and waited. “I don’t always leave it on, especially if I’m going out. Haven’t heard anything since that day...”
Can’t...can’t open my eyes. Can’t move. What the hell?
“Nonsense,” Mycroft snapped back. “You know your own mind, John. You
“After the warehouse.”
The other small hand attempted to lift Sherlock out of his lap, without success, but the intention of it finally made its way through into Sherlock’s sex-sodden brain. He released his own cock to John’s attentive mercies and grasped the top of the headboard again, using it to help him raise and lower himself on his knees, pumping John’s erection into and out of himself, as fast and as deep as possible.
John hitched his head toward the couch and Mrs. Hudson looked over and nodded. “He’s been like that most of the afternoon, ever since he came in from Scotland Yard. He had a case to discuss with that nice Inspector Lestrade, and he was fine when he left, but, afterwards, he returned home in a huff, slammed the front door so hard it rattled the glass, and stomped up the stairs. Haven’t heard from him since.” She arranged the tray on the miraculously-clean kitchen table and began to pour. “I can usually hear him moving about up here, but, today, not a whisper.” She shook her head.
“He’s calling me names again. Blames me for the fact he is here,” Sherlock lied with great facility. “We don’t always get along, as you can see.”
you’re done making silent commentary on my husband’s and my eating habits, Agent Doyle, how may we assist you?” Sherlock asked, grabbing a pickle from his husband’s plate and exaggeratedly popping it in his mouth. John growled.

About this time, Whitey was starting to figure out that maybe this madman in front of him with the big shiny gun and the deadly smile was actually serious.

Sherlock held up a finger. “Just one thing, Mrs. Hudson. Are you sure you won’t…
“Lestrade! Get over here!” he called back, gesturing urgently. Lestrade hustled over (I followed at a more leisurely pace) and leaned over John’s shoulder, staring at the crime scene photo in John’s hand. “What is it?”

John hung on the column, catching his breath from the blow it had inflicted upon him. Finally, he turned around and snarled, “What’s between Sherlock and me is

“Shut it, you,” John replied, his voice soft and loving. He leaned down to kiss his husband’s shock of curly hair before Sherlock repositioned himself on his side, head supported by one arm. “You have never,
Lestrade nodded wordlessly. He was still looking a bit nervous.
Definite interest this time, as the comforter over his face was peeled down and a blinking Sherlock emerged. “Tim Tamms, you said?”
“Well, I think I’ve got you opened up enough now, so...come here, you gorgeous beast,” John said as he set his hands on Sherlock’s hips and manipulated him into position over his cock. There was a bead of precum shining there already. “Just let me position myself here...Do you feel that?”
John held up a finger. “Let’s try something,” he said, before turning to the GetBox and asking, “Sherlock, there is a file Lestrade gave me this morning that has to do with a possible murder. I haven’t had a chance to read it yet, but could you give me a clue as to what to look for?”
Sherlock took a deep sigh and turned his attention to cleaning up the bathroom. Rosie loved to splash him, so he was damp and chilled from the experience, but he used her towel to mop up the spilled water and put her bath toys into their suspended net next to the tub. Once finished, he slipped into his bedroom to put on his own ratty pyjamas (unlike Rosie’s, which were of the finest quality) and tying shut his dressing gown before entering the kitchen, where John was lightly rough-housing with Rosie, who giggled and shouted, “Daddy, stop!” as she struggled. She caught sight of Sherlock as he entered the room and yelled, “Papa!”
A quick trip to the loo and John was back, wriggling his way deep under the blankets and insinuating himself into Sherlock’s arms again. They were quick to re-wrap, accompanied by a contented sigh from their owner. John allowed himself to drift back into blessed sleep…
Reaching blindly for the lube, John set about preparing his lover. As Sherlock had stated earlier, it did, indeed, require three fingers, and a lot of lube, to make John’s entry into a pleasurable proposition. Sherlock gasped as John penetrated his initial defenses, along with the >pop<-like closure of the sphincter around John’s ample crown.

“Ah, pity, but I had to try,” Mycroft observed, ruefully, as he re-situated his faceplate and loudly ordered, “Resume duties!” The bridge sprang back into life and the guards gathered around Sherlock again. “Escort this prisoner to the dock. Maintain careful watch; this one is tricky.”
He sighed. “The most likely scenario, but, nephew, it’s
The table legs skidded behind him. He looked over his shoulder in time to see Sherlock hop up to sit on the edge before lying down and tucking his heels under his bum. His hands assumed their usual steepled position below his chin.
rather partial to that cape.”
Standing at the counter, he carefully peeled off individual slices of grayish-pink meat and checked them for mold, when he heard a door creak open quietly and the sound of someone relieving himself in the hall loo.
Within minutes, the two were asleep again.
Overcome with affection, Sherlock leaned over the tub and gave Rosie the biggest hug he could manage. She whispered, “I love you, Papa,” in his ear and, his heart swelled.
“So I don’t hurt him again later,” John responded, raising his head. Tears made wandering tracks down his broad face. “My God, Mycroft, I’ve hurt him
“Er, John! I, uh, didn’t hear you come in! I, I thought you’d be gone longer...” Sherlock stammered as he turned off the cd player and turned to face John, hands clasped behind his back like a child who had just been caught playing dress-up with Mummy’s clothes. He rocked on his bare feet, which were decorated by beaded ankle bracelets with chains leading down to his long, agile toes.

The two husbands glared at each other for several seconds before John closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He dropped his head, looking down at the worn oriental rug under his feet, before rubbing the back of his neck and saying, “Look, Sherlock, I don’t want to argue with you. It’s probably just the adrenaline talking.” He looked up at Sherlock’s pale, narrowed eyes and attempted a smile. “Why don’t we just go…” and he jerked his head toward the bedroom, “let off some steam, hm?”
Eyes still closed from the kiss, Sherlock sighed and nodded, wondering

“You have the most fucking incredible arse...my God, what did I do to deserve you?” he murmured again, still unmoving.

very nicely. If I’d known that I had this to look forward to, I would have pressed my luck further,” she purred.
They stayed like that for several minutes, just touching lips—whispy, feathery kisses, little nips, barely-there caresses of tongues—while they breathed in each other’s scent, lost in the thrill of re-discovery. Sherlock’s delicate fingers deftly stroked John’s cheek, skimming the stubble on his jaw and following it down to his throat. John’s eyes drifted closed again as he relaxed into the glorious sensations he had missed all this time. He hardly dared move for fear it would break the spell of the moment.
“That’s what I was afraid of,” Sherlock admitted. “I was afraid that you would be offended and leave, taking Rosie with you. I couldn’t bear to lose both of you. Better to remain silent and live with the status quo than to be rejected by the person I would lay down my life for.”
They grinned at each other as Sherlock bent down to retrieve the comforter and followed John into their bedroom. The door closed silently behind them.

Sergei turned to Sherlock and asked, “What did he say?”
“That’s why we’re a team, love,” John said, in his sincerest manner. “We look after each other. I’m just sorry it took so long for me to find you.” He quietly cursed everyone and everything that had cost him time that day. “I was ready to use the Sig to rearrange Whitey James’ face that day, one sector at a time, if he wouldn’t tell me where you were. We were all ready to take him to a nice, isolated part of town for just that reason when he finally cracked.”

Dark head cocked to one side.
The air had gotten considerably cooler than it had been earlier that evening. John looked around him, turning in desperate circles, trying to get his bearings. Everything looked both familiar and unfamiliar at once, thanks to his inebriated state of mind. He set off at a determined pace in what
The shadow that was Sergei moved toward Sherlock and a hand with a vise-like grip latched on to Sherlock’s lower jaw, lifting him onto his toes. “No talking!” he ordered, his breath worse than that of the decaying corpse in the corner.
John tilted his head quizzically. “Yeah. Finally admitted it to myself after all those years of denial, but you
“We’ll be right out, John,” Sherlock’s deep baritone carried well from the bathroom. He hurried Rosie into her sleep garb and slippers before allowing her to run out into the parlor. He could hear the joy in John’s voice as he greeted her and lifted her up into his arms. The high pitched, childish voice bubbled excitement as she asked how his date went.

“And I’m not one for blaming the victim, so there you have it,” Sherlock finished for him. He sipped his scotch just as the rain began sheeting against the window. Lightning flashed, followed by a dull boom, indicating the storm was still quite a distance away. “Ah, our storm has arrived.”

“Ponce,” John chided him, affectionately.

The silence was deafening.
John shook his head and raised his hands in defeat. “Sherlock…I can’t...”
There were heavy gold chains around his neck, a pair of gem-encrusted earrings hanging from his ear lobes, and a multitude of clanging gold-and-silver bracelets on his wrists. He wore a softly-draped shirt with full sleeves and a neckline cut down to his belt, showing his sparse chest hair and the single bullet scar near his heart. Over his hips was a wrap of purple-and-gold fabric, sporting gold coins and fringe that flashed and danced when he moved. The purple-and-gold print harem-style pants, again with gold trim, sat low on his hips and sported slits down the sides, reflecting the slits in the full sleeves of his top. Chiming anklets and an embroidered and gold- embellished short vest completed the picture. He looked...

the figment of a fitful night’s dream. “Sherlock,” he breathed, at once a name, a hope, and a prayer. He swallowed, hard, before asking, “May I…?”
I did, Sherlock. I mean, how long have we been living together?”
After he rounded the corner back to the high street, John decided that maybe, just maybe, he should return to Baker Street. He needed time to think and it was exceedingly bad form to be accosting total strangers in a drunken haze whilst trying to work out one’s relationship problems. He looked at his watch. It was late, but not late enough that Sherlock would be in bed yet, which meant he’d have to face him when he came in. He seriously considered just sitting in the park until dawn, but that seemed to be a bad idea, considering everything that had happened tonight. Besides, Sherlock would be in a panic by morning, if he wasn’t already…
, but Sherlock was
a boner I could hardly walk! It’s a good thing you had to go into the other room to dress or I probably wouldn’t have been able to walk out of there without a limp!”
Not entirely convinced, Sherlock crawled onto the bed, straddling John’s hips. John slid his fingertips under the hip wrap and began to tease the harem pants down Sherlock’s slender hip while rolling his pelvis upward into Sherlock’s own. Sherlock ran his hands over John’s chest and sides, sometimes leaning down to bestow a lingering kiss upon John’s lips or neck. He might have even left a love bite or two, but John was in no condition to care. Eventually, John slid Sherlock’s harem pants out from between them and discovered that Sherlock wasn’t wearing anything underneath them. The skin-to-skin friction was

John shivered with anticipation. Only having that small bit of himself inside…it was
John stopped and turned. A young man stood in a crouch behind him, holding an open switchblade. The shadowy figure gestured at him, making jerky, cutting movements with the blade. “Give it over! Don’t make me stick ya!”
“They’ve found Rosie,” Sherlock breathed. John slumped in relief before asking, “Where?”
“Hmm? Oh, I’m fine, mia dulce,” he said. “Just a passing thought.” He stood and leaned over, effortlessly picking up the child and setting her on his hip. “Time for bed.”
“Indeed, I am,” Sherlock nodded, popping a bit of toast into his mouth.
John nodded. “Yes. All those things

Sherlock quirked a smile. “The dreaded ‘what ifs’. They’ll eat you
well...
“Shit.”
“How is he today, doctor?” Mycroft asked, solicitously, as he entered the private hospital room containing his younger brother. His eyes darted to the quiet figure on the bed, attended by a worried John Watson.
There was the sound of slow, measured footfalls on the stairs. Sherlock went out into the hall and said, “Mrs. Hudson, you should call us when you’re carrying something up here!”
“Yeah, well, some of your experiments

Sherlock observed, somewhat unnecessarily. At John’s pointed look, he sighed melodramatically and started tapping on his phone keyboard before holding it up in front of John’s face.
“I’m not,
Sherlock looked vaguely offended. His nose wrinkled in distaste. “
“Unlike you, you lying bastard,” John reprimanded him. “Telling me you were a ‘high-level sociopath’ for all those years...and I was stupid enough to believe you, in spite of every clue to the contrary!” He thumped down his glass in disgust.
John nodded as he said, “Yeah, you might say that. Sherlock is in a right state downstairs on the parlor floor, saying he’s a failure and a disgrace because he misread the evidence, and THEN he saw the headlines...”
The moment finally came. John was alone in my old bed, sleeping. I watched as his breathing became shallower and shallower, listened as his heart beat slower and more weakly…
John knelt on the ground and, gingerly, examined the corpse. Donning gloves, he turned the battered body over to examine him. “Was anything touched, Greg?”

Mycroft reached up and, tilting his helmet backwards, removed his faceplate. The austere expression of Sherlock’s older sibling was revealed. He smiled coldly. “True, but I do so enjoy a good reprimand from time to time.” He snorted in derision again. “Besides,

Giggling. “You’re such an arse…”
Sherlock stopped his progress just long enough to watch as Mori-wan Iarty vanished into the ether. He shook his head.
He half-lifted John to his feet, then threw him against the wall and refastened the cuffs again, tighter this time. John’s head lolled. “Good fighter. If he had been stronger, he would have posed a problem.” Sergei said as he rumpled John’s graying hair
he yelled as he threw his body out of the clutching bedsheets and grabbed the note like a drunken man. He peered at it closely, then swore under his breath.
I waited, waited for the next verbal coaxing. It didn’t come. Instead, I heard what sounded like a choked sob, muffled and subdued, as if the person was embarrassed to be expressing such a mundane sentiment.

John’s struggling feet disappeared inexorably around the corner. “
Sherlock smiled. “You believed what I led you to believe. That was how I kept people away. Only thing is, after a while, I didn’t want to keep pushing you away, but, by then, it was too late. You had bought the story in its entirety. You would never believe I was a real human being under that facade, no matter what I did.” He sipped his drink before putting down. “So which one of us was the greater fool?”
Sherlock snorted indelicately and waved a dismissive hand. “There’s
John finally laughed out loud. “The answer is yes, Sherlock. Yes, we

Note: ‘Jean’ is pronounced something like ‘Jhawn’, with a soft ‘j’, in French. Just sayin’...
John shrugged. “Your decision, Sherlock, but, remember--whatever you decide, I’m in.”
“Why do you think I never acquired any diseases during my time on the streets? The chemist in me is too careful.” Sherlock responded, still not directly engaging his husband.
John sniffed in anger, his mouth distorted. “Well, before I left the Whitey James take-down, I told Wiggins to anonymously call the police and tell them where to pick up the wanker and why. I told him where I was going, so he included that in the call. Thing is, when Lestrade heard that the call was an anonymous tip about someone kidnapping Sherlock, he got on the line. He knew it was Wiggins right off, so he was able to get more information out of him. He sent Donovan and a team to pick up Whitey, then he and

Her fingertips slid under his belt, insinuating themselves into his pants in back while her other hand slid over his belly, down toward his lap. He could almost feel that graceful musician’s hand rubbing over his engorging cock, coaxing it to capacity, before freeing it from it’s denim prison.
“He thought this would be easy, otherwise he wouldn’t have taken the job. Little did he know…” Doyle chuckled to himself as John cleaned off his shirt.
“So, now, Mary, David, and the baby are on the run, you’re barely walking yourself, and John is in a coma,” Mycroft summed up. “What are you planning on doing, Sherlock? Another hare-brained scheme to catch Moriarty’s agents who caused the accident? Considering the circumstances, I would advise against it.”
She closed her eyes and nodded in satisfaction. “I thought so. You’re unhappy because Daddy goes out with ladies instead of you.”

The Sherlocktopus was back.
Sherlock shrugged. “Fine. I’ll make sure you’re on the bottom, then,” he said, as he bent down, put his shoulder into John’s midsection and, after straightening up, bore the struggling doctor on his shoulder as he exited the kitchen. “Why are you making such a fuss? I thought you were enjoying this as much as I!”
John grinned. “Sounds acceptable on all levels. What’s next…the Matterhorn? Space Mountain?”
“I think I would have preferred to go out for breakfast, John. The service here is incredibly slow,” Sherlock observed, acidly, as he perused his menu.
John waited until Sherlock came up for air, then said, “So, are you considering taking the case?”
Sherlock worked his lips in and out before replying. “You know damned well I don’t eat until you come back. What are these, the leftovers from your lengthy lunch?”
“Well? If he’s my Daddy, so shouldn’t I worry too?” she asked again, blue eyes gazing into silver with such earnestness it melted his heart.

Quizzical silver eyes rose to meet his. “Then what was this morning all about? And why were you looking at women in their underwear on your laptop?” he asked, his tone still a bit truculent.

that my favorite dragon-slayer was going to try to do something incredibly stupid, so I was trying to steer you away from it. Without success, obviously.”
He turned and trudged back toward Baker Street. No choice, then. It would be cruel beyond belief to avoid him now.
By feel alone, he tilted John’s not-unimpressive cock down so he could sit on it, the turgid staff lying between his bollocks and arse cheeks, allowing him to rock up and down on its entire, impressive length.
“I don’t know,” Mycroft answered softly, his eyebrows knit together in consternation. “Sherlock is quite adept at a number of languages, but his default has always been English, so…”
Sherlock murmured before slipping into sleep again.
“Yeah, yeah, I think I will,” John agreed, rubber-kneeing it into the parlor, where he poured himself a stiff drink and settled into his chair. A good, solid jolt of single-malt liquor came as something of a relief after the day he’d just had. As he took another sip, he noticed music wafting out of the back bedroom again, only louder this time. He turned in his chair and nearly snorted the single malt out of his nose.
A sigh. “But the others...”
Yes. Yes, it had finally happened. After all John’s hard work, support, and affection…

“Oh, don’t tempt me, honey. I’d rather put you in the ground than allow you to…
John looked thoughtful for a moment, then said, “Let’s let him handle the interrogation, then we can get the boiled-down version…if that’s okay with you, of course.”

“Always. You and your daddy are my primary concerns,” he affirmed as he squirted shampoo into one long-fingered hand and slathered it into her light-gold hair. She squealed in mock-indignation. “I’ll do it!” she squeaked as she pushed his hands away. “I’m a big girl!”
John nodded nonchalantly. “As often as I can,” he noted, glibly. Agent Doyle snorted, trying to suppress laughter. “But what did I say…”

John stopped in his tracks and returned to Sherlock’s side. “What? What is it? Is it about Rosie?” he persisted. Sherlock cut him off with a chop of his hand. John subsided.
“He’s not a meaningless scrap of ordinariness, as you stated once before,” Sherlock growled. “I nearly hit you for that statement alone!”
Sherlock grumbled to himself and rededicated his attention to the menu. After a few minutes, the server approached with a pot of hot coffee and a cup of tea for Sherlock. “Ta,” John said, then, after the server gave him a quizzical look, amended it to, “Thank you.” The server smiled and nodded before leaving.
Sherlock rose slowly from his chair but, instead of standing, he knelt facing John, his feet crossed as he sat back on his heels. His face opened up like a tragic bloom as he peered up into his husband’s face and said, softly, “I love you, John, but I need you equally as much. You keep me right. You keep me stable. You give me the understanding and support I could never give myself or find in others. Without you, I fall apart, I become less.” His eyes were deep silver pools that drew John into them. “If you wanted to leave, I would let you go because it would be what’s best for you, but I would wither away and, eventually, disappear into a fog of drug-induced delusion. An empty shell, awaiting it’s final dissolution and death.” He blinked back tears. “I don’t say this to coerce you into staying, John. I say this because it is the truth. I’m not what you think I am, and you are so much more than you think you are.”
“We can do

Lestrade nodded. “Yeah, I guess so. But, what about you? Don’t you want any credit?”

him. There was also a healthy dose of arousal thrown into the mix. Sherlock’s mercurial eyes darted around the room, then back to John, as if looking for some way to explain...

“And to you, as well, on your recent promotion,” Sherlock observed. The officer stopped and stared at him.
Both John’s hands went up in good-natured surrender. “I give up! You’re right, as always, Sherlock!”
John practically threw his plate onto the table in annoyance, where it landed next to Sherlock’s elbow. “At least, put something under your arse, then.”

. I can detect light through my eyelids. Can’t move my eyes, though.
I shook my head and shouted “NO!” If John had known I was there, he would have shaken his head, smiled, and said, “That’s Sherlock. Always resisting the inevitable.”
John rage-sniffed in annoyance and responded, “Didn’t think you’d notice I was gone. You could have helped me with the groceries, you know.”
“Well, Rosie...”
He smiled in what, he hoped, was a charming manner. It would have probably been more successful if he could have felt his face. “Nope. All alone. Jus’ me and my porter.” He raised his half-empty glass in illustration.
Sherlock’s head jerked upright, revealing a mask of hurt. “
A touseled head rose up and two silvery eyes glared at John. “No,” Sherlock said, flatly and with emphasis. “I don’t trust you anymore.”

“OK, then. ‘Morning, Toxic Waste,” John replied, smirking.
“Then Magnussen very nearly succeeded in sealing my death warrant,” Sherlock continued. “He wanted to control Mary but ended up also controlling me.” A pause. “Or, so he thought.
“I had to save John,” Sherlock replied, his voice flat and brooking no argument.
“Better report that we are currently under attack, John,” Sherlock said, calmly.

“Nice customer service,” John observed.
The lights were warm and welcoming in the second-story windows. John stopped across the street and watched. No one moved against the sheer curtains, and there was no sound of a violin playing. John shrugged and walked across the narrow street, pausing only to slip his key into the lock and open the outer door. Once inside, John could smell Mrs. Hudson’s apple cobbler. He knew Mrs. Hudson baked whenever she was upset. He sighed. That was another battle for another day.
Through the agony he could hear Irene’s voice next to his ear, dripping with hate. “You destroyed my life, Sherlock, you and that filthy brother of yours. I had everything—a thriving business, a beautiful home, wealth, influence--and you took it all away with one keystroke! You just had to win, didn’t you? You just had to prove how

“I think he said something about disabling the tractor beam that brought us here! I don’t know where he is! But, right now, we have to save Sherlock!” John said as he charged down the corridor toward a cell with a lit beacon above it. “It must be

Fucking wrong. He skidded to a halt, almost bouncing off the tall man in the long black coat who looked not one bit like Sherlock. John studied him carefully, just to make sure it wasn’t Sherlock in disguise. The elderly man stared down at him in confusion. Unless Sherlock had lost several stone and suddenly become Indian, John doubted this was him. He apologized profusely and scarpered off, his face hot with embarrassment.
John moved his head. “What, Mind Palace wasn’t enough?” he asked. “Thought you said...”

Sherlock waited with bated breath until he was certain they were alone. “That

“Heartily. As I said, it’s young but, nevertheless, such behavior should be…dealt with.”
Revelations come fast and furious at the end of John and Sherlock's Sex Holiday. Will valued relationships survive?
Looking at John over the top of his mug, Sherlock smiled in a self-deprecating manner. “My self-esteem would be nice.”
“You love Daddy, don’t you?” she asked, plainly.
“John…” Sherlock said gently, starting toward John, both hands reaching out for him.

“Well, I found out that you had something of an interest in ladies’ underthings, particularly lacy ones. In white. So I bought a pair to try to see what the fuss was all about.” Sherlock tilted his head and pursed his lips pensively, a smile tugging at one corner. “I must admit, they were quite soft and…comfortable. Unfortunately, that was the day Mycroft’s men came to get me at the flat and I couldn’t get away to take them off. So-o-o…”

are, Agent,” Sherlock stated, all offended innocence.
“It wouldn’t have mattered. When we shook hands, I asked him, non-verbally, of course, to come with me, and he, equally non-verbally, asked me to stay. I told him I couldn’t, and left it at that.” Sherlock sounded sad, and just a touch bitter. “Had to stay to tend to the pregnant wife, you know. Hmph. I wonder what he would have done if he’d known the truth at that moment?”
Sherlock experimentally rolled onto his back and stated, with relief, “Much better, thank you. Why, do you want to..?”

Sherlock looked up at the sign. “It’s a Small World? Really, John? It’s a child’s ride!”
“Got it, Doc. I’ll get on it rite away. Call ya if I find ennythin’” >click< The line went dead. John knew that Billy would get the homeless network galvanized into action. They respected Sherlock, even if they weren’t necessarily fond of his some of his mannerisms, and they knew that he always tried to help them.
“Yeah, all right,” Lestrade nodded, defeated, one hand rubbing the back of his head as if he’d been struck by a 2x4. “Sounds like a plan, John. Can you…?”
“You might change your mind, you know.” His tone was soft and reasonable.
He scrubbed his hand over his face and sighed. “God, I hope you’re right, Ella. If I can get him to respond to me…God, I just want to see the old Sherlock again, snark and all.
“John! John, can you hear me?” Sherlock said, urgently.
John grinned at the graceless concession. Sherlock knew that he needed to eat (which he hadn’t been for quite some time) but that John needed regular meals (which he hadn’t been getting lately due to his concern over Sherlock), so the only way to get John to eat (a necessity, in Sherlock’s view) was for Sherlock to eat as well. As far as Sherlock was concerned, John had lost entirely too much weight lately and was no longer as comfortably soft as he once was. This must be remedied.

After that, John slept--when he
Sherlock rolled his eyes out loud. “Oh, for God’s sake, the girl was bleeding profusely from the shoulder. What did you think it was, a poisoned dart? A supersonic arrow? The Spear of Longinus? Really, Agent Doyle, you are barking up the wrong tree here. Go see if the girl has any frustrated exes or traitorous friends.

As an old man, John finally found himself unable to tend to his own needs. He was well-situated enough financially that he could afford companion care for his bathing and his chores. A lively young woman with kind eyes would visit daily and assist him in getting ready for his day. She would then do the shopping while John wrote his memoires. He had already published several tomes recounting his crime-solving adventures with me in our glory days. He was now working on his more recent adventures (without mentioning his “ghostly partner”, of course) and a book on criminal behavioral analysis. He was content.

John slid down the seat laughing. The woman in front cast a poisonous look back at him and muttered something under her breath.
Sherlock shrugged. “’May old acquaintance be forgot…’ Hmmph, if only.” He turned and walked back into the bedroom, shedding his robe as he went. As usual, the sight caused an involuntary twitch in John’s nether regions, seeing that svelte body sashaying to the bed with no hint of body consciousness whatsoever. He laid down on his side on the bed and gestured seductively. “Come here, husband, I have need of you.”
Sergei walked to the center of the room and made a movement. A small click and a light went on, dim and flickering. Sherlock could see John chained to the opposite wall, dried blood trailing down his chin and staining his plaid shirt. They both blinked at the light, which

Breathlessly, “That was…that was…”

The riding crop came down again, this time harder. Sherlock’s back arched in agony but he refused to scream. That’s what she wanted, to hear him scream, to make him beg for mercy—twice. But, apart from that first strike to his genitals, Sherlock had refused to cooperate.
Sherlock glared up at him. “You know I become largely unintelligible once sexual contact is initiated!” he accused. “I couldn’t have said, ‘no’ if I’d tried!”
John sighed. “A while. I…just…

As the paramedics piled into the room and set up their equipment, John found Sherlock’s nearly-numb hand and squeezed it. “Can you feel that?”
“Lies,” I grumped. “The EMT’s examined him briefly and that officer over there,” I jerked his head toward an unkempt-looking officer standing at the periphery, “pilfered his pockets already. Shady lad, that one. Oh, and don’t miss the gunshot wound, John.”
amazing.”
“Because you and I both love Sherlock, each in our own way, and I will not stand idly by as you hurt him yet again.”
With an audible growl, Sherlock tapped out what he had tried to say and held up the phone.
He shimmied down farther until found John’s bollocks, firm and already drawing upward. A quick lick to one sent another chill up the man as Sherlock gently mouthed, then sucked in, one of John’s balls while bobbling the other one in a long-fingered hand. One long finger reached behind and pressed up into the flesh just between the sac and John’s entrance.
Eyebrows knitted together, Sherlock stated, “It’s not
“I know you’re out there, John, so stop pretending you’re not.” The voice sounded a bit peeved this time.
Everyone froze. Sherlock extracted his hair from the one man’s fist and picked up the discarded gun from where it had fallen post-bite. He slid to the far side of the seat and held up the gun, two-fingered, by its handle. A police officer opened the door behind him and Sherlock tumbled out backwards, tossing the gun as he fell. It was retrieved and the officer started to cuff Sherlock when a familiar voice called out from a car that had just arrived at the scene.
A Later Conversation
“John, don’t let her get away! John!” Sherlock called out, his voice cracking with stress, a tinge of hysteria just noticeable around the edges. “Stop her!”
A few pints later, John found himself sitting in one of the private booths in the back of the pub. A group of rowdies had come in and grouped around him, all clamoring for their beers and jostling him in the process. His mind was becoming comfortably numb under the influence of a good porter when a lovely young lady slid into the booth opposite him. John took instant notice of her, and for good reason. Her hair was long and straight and a beautiful shade of burnished auburn. She wore round, gold-rimmed glasses, behind which were a pair of the greenest eyes he had seen in many a year. She graced him with a slightly gap-toothed smile.
“For God’s sake, Sherlock, I just got off the phone with…wait a minute, did you actually call me by my given name?”
John gave him a look and quietly asked, “Did you just pickpocket me?”

Off they went, having retrieved their own towels, and returned to their scenic hotel room. Once there, John took a shower to remove the blood from his body and swimsuit. He was later joined by Sherlock, who made sure they wasted plenty of water in the pursuit of the perfect orgasm. Once dry again, they sent out for dinner, with the plan of spending another night in the room before venturing out to the ‘tourist traps’, as Sherlock viewed them, of the area around them.
John just glowered at the little girl, who ignored him.

Pushing past his husband, John stormed out through the parlor door. He
what’s the matter?”
It didn’t take John long to fulfill his promises. With a groan of pain/pleasure he shot his load deep into his lover, his body jerking in time with his ejaculations. Sherlock’s legs were locked around John’s back, his arms wrapped around his shoulders, face buried in John’s neck as he rode his lover’s pleasure to the end.
Clearing his throat, Sherlock said, “I believe there is enough room in my bed for all three of us, if it isn’t an inconvenience to you.”
The detective closed his eyes and said, sadly, “All of it.”
“How’d your date go?” Sherlock inquired as he turned back to watch the flames that danced perilously close to his perfectly-kept Oxfords.
He blinked as his eyes adjusted to the light. With his other hand he rubbed his eyes as he walked into the kitchen, not thinking to look…
John stood nearby, furiously taking notes. He had long since gotten used to Sherlock’s displays of deductive brilliance intellectually, but
John certainly
He held out his arms and showed off the dark blue evening gown with the draped sleeves, plunging V neck, and scads of crystals adorning the bodice. “Lovely, isn’t it? I appropriated it after your mother could no longer wear it.” He leaned in and confided, “Personally, I think I look better in it than she
had been the first night they had slept together.
“Yeah, well, turns out the victim was also undergoing a nasty divorce, according to his sister, who was contacted at home. Turns out, his wife had been cheating on him with, of all things, an army sharpshooter. There’s a possibility that that this might have been an accidental double-tap by both of them on the husband,” Lestrade finished. He and John exchanged bewildered glances before he pointed at John.
As John bustled about the kitchen, the bedroom door creaked open and a sheet-clad figure shambled out, moving painfully. It yawned mightily before its bright silver eyes lit upon its flatmate and its mouth twisted disapprovingly.
Sherlock shrugged. “Very well.” He closed his hand and tossed the vials to John, one by one, over his shoulder. “There. Happy now?”
A kiss. On my hand. I then felt my hand being cradled against a wet cheek and kissed again. The grip on it tightened, as if desperate.
He heard her walk toward where he assumed she had set up the camera. “Don’t think I’m done with you yet, Sherlock. There are just so-o-o many other things I’ve been wanting to do to you and they should all be immortalized on video, don’t you think?” her voice drifted back. “Hmm, plenty of memory left. You know, I shouldn’t be greedy. I should space this out, make it last. When I’m done with you, Sherlock, you will know what it feels like to be beaten. Oh, not like last time—that was just a taste. You’ve just had the appetizer. Dinner will be much more filling.”
“Yes, you are, John,” Sherlock reassured him. “You’re just too hard on yourself.”
He walked aimlessly, sometimes crossing streets, sometimes turning corners to avoid traffic. Hands in his jacket pockets, head down, no one bothered him. Why should they? I’m no one. Just an angry little man...
Sherlock convulsed in laughter, despite John’s weight on top of him.
? Are you telling me that you can’t recognize a carving knife wound in the arse as possibly being either a marital squabble or a drug-related injury? For God’s sake, man! You should have just called Scotland Yard and been
John shook his head. “No, that was someone else. I attended to the young woman who was shot.”
You just
Sherlock smirked internally. He began to sink slowly downward on the well-greased pole penetrating his arse. Vaguely, he could hear John groaning, as if in pain.
Crying? Why are they crying? What…?
. Such a silly name, only the English could come up with such a limp, bourgeois name!”
Sherlock ducked behind John, who covered him with blaster fire up the hallway. “Not a moron. Genius. High-functioning sociopath, to be honest. So, I would have no problem with dumping you down this chute, head-first, if you piss me off, fly boy.” He pulled a large grating off the wall and took a sniff. “Not pleasant, but better than where we are now. Come on!” he yelled as he went into the unnamed chute, feet-first.
A breath caught in Sherlock’s throat. He wasn’t really ready for that question. “Well, your daddy hasn’t said that he would like you to call me that. After all, I’m not your real Papa...”
Sherlock seriously considered retching.
promised to love, honor, and cherish. Is
The next time he partially emerged from slumber, there was a strange wind-like sound in his ear, and a cool/warm sensation on his neck that was familiar, yet he couldn’t quite place it. It felt nice, though, so he groggily reasoned it must all be part of some waking dream and that he should just lie there and enjoy it. He shivered in pleasure at the sensations, which seemed to move with some strange sort of intent. At one point, he even giggled a bit when a ticklish spot was touched. There was no feeling of danger or alarm, just a sense of being comfortable and warm and loved.
“Good, good. Lie down, then.” When Sherlock started to sulk, John added, “Please. I want to see your beautiful face…”
“Shit! Call for an ambulance!” John yelled and he scrambled out of the pool and to the young woman’s side. A quick evaluation of the wound and John called it a possible gunshot wound, through-and-through. He applied pressure to the entry and exit wounds simultaneously but the blood kept coming.
“And my motor centers? What of those?”
Lestrade was beginning to look a bit unwell, but John vigorously typed in the words “trumpet *” and “paralysis”, which had been one of the victim’s symptoms, into the search function,. The display changed to reveal a synopsis bearing a full-color image, the words “trumpet flower”, and a listing of “symptoms of trumpet flower poisoning”, which included “headache, nausea, diarrhea,...with possible complications including death, paralysis, shock...”
He looked dead into my eyes and said, calmly, “Sherlock, that is only

He could hear her approach the bed again, only this time the honey was gone from her voice and the steel was plainly audible. “Tsk, tsk, Sherlock. You’re not the only Holmes in the world, you know. There are other ones who could be embarrassed by your flagrant disregard for social convention, and once I am done with you, your entire family could be easily pressured into giving in to my

gifted in that area. Once again, he swung Sherlock around to face the wall, his pants still moored below his bum. Sergei’s rapidly-growing member began sliding between Sherlock’s taut cheeks, becoming more and more of a weapon with each stroke. Then, with practiced ease, he pressed the head against Sherlock’s entrance and pushed, hard.

Warnings: No Archive Warnings Apply
He heard a throaty chuckle as she approached. “Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Well, well, whatever are you doing in my bed?” she inquired, all innocence.
John stopped moving. His mouth twisted in that way he had before delivering a particularly scathing comeback. Sherlock prepared himself. Instead, John extended his chin in a familiar way and said, “No, this is all freshly-prepared. I even brought you the tikka masala you like.”

Sherlock complied.
“And this change,” John asked, scratching his head as he tried to wrap his brain around this explanation. “Is it…is it permanent? Or is there a chance he’ll return to normal, physically
They stayed like that, pressed together as though one body, for a long, long time.
“You knew we were going to Florida for our…” Sherlock started.
Just watching him sleep, knowing he would awaken at some point to a new wave of anguish, filled me with an anger I hadn’t felt on the “other side”. Lower vibrations, Uncle Rudy had said. Negative emotions must be lower vibration and, therefore, incompatable with the spiritual realm but perfectly at home on Earth. While here, I would be subject to the restrictions of this dimension, including negative emotions.

A finger flick to the face. “Ah, ah, AH, Sherlock, you talk nice to me or your partner pays the price for your insolence.”
He didn’t look up when he said, “I’m out of here. I can’t do this anymore. I can’t watch you stupidly risk your life over and over again. I’m

Lestrade fell back against the couch and swore in astonishment. “Holy shit, it’s...” He leaned forward

John squinted at her. “You...
John kept vigil at Sherlock’s bedside, sleeping fitfully in a convalescent chair in a corner to stay out of the way of the nurses. One ear and one eye were always open, waiting for a single word or movement from the bed. He often started when someone came into the room until Mycroft put an end to the constant stream of people. “Dr. Watson is perfectly capable of keeping tabs on my brother,” he stated, his tone uncompromising. “I have complete and utter confidence in his abilities.”
He watched as Sherlock chewed on a forkful of food, his face thoughtful and his eyes far away. “I don’t know. I may. As long as I can work from here, I don’t see a problem with it.” He returned his gaze to John. “What do you think?”

Lestrade’s eyes widened as he withdrew slightly from John. John was still shivering. I tried to put my arms around him but he just shivered harder. Of course! I’m cold! Unagitated energy has no heat! I backed away and he settled a bit when someone wrapped an orange blanket around his shoulders.

John nodded, still cradling his husband as the paramedics hustled up to them.
John tentatively touched Sherlock’s cheek, stroking the sharp cheekbone gently before smearing away a couple of tears that had escaped Sherlock’s normally iron control. “I know you’re not perfect, Sherlock. I’m not asking you to be...”
“’On every horizontal surface in the room’, you said…”

“Mmmm, no. Go ‘way, Graham.”

“As soon as we deal with John, Greg,” I returned.
What would he have done if he had taken Della up on her obvious offer? Done it in the loo? Gone back to her place? Fucked in an alley? His shiver had nothing to do with the cold. He was repelled by what he had almost done. That was something Three-Continents Watson would have done, but he’s long gone, isn’t he? In his place is Dr. John H. Watson, husband and blogger of Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective. He far preferred that life, even if he didn’t feel as though he deserved it. Not good enough, not perfect, not worthy...

John grinned up at me as a high, feminine voice caught our attention. A pretty, blonde woman had stuck her head out of the portal and called, “Yoo hoo! John, dear! Come on through, will you? Hurry up, we’re waiting! I’ve made biscuits!” Then she retreated.

The following years were good ones. John became quite proficient in my techniques, with a little indirect help from his “guardian angel”, as he came to call me. He always tried to be low-key about his investigations but, soon, the word got out that the associate of Sherlock Holmes was, himself, a prodigious talent in the field of detection. Scotland Yard consulted him frequently, and his private investigative practice was pulling in customers in droves. He was able to sell off his medical practice and concentrate on helping those who were hopeless and afraid. He found the work quite rewarding.
John wasn’t in much better shape, but he faced his lover’s ire head on. “Sherlock,” he whispered, looking up into that heated gaze with one of his own. “I want you to fuck me.”

try your very best to convert me as a child, as I recall. Quite useless, you know.” He stopped and stared into the reflective lenses of Mycroft’s mask. “Would you mind terribly removing that ridiculous thing? It’s rather like talking to one of your tiresome Stormtroopers; all firepower, no brain.” And, he added, “And some of the worst marksmanship I’ve seen in
This must be my funeral. Or a wake. Not even an Irish wake; not enough drinking going on. No toasting the dead. Nope, this is a funeral.
Sherlock smirked as the two of them sat down to eat. John was busy suppressing a grin. “Why do you have to bait the police at every turn, Sherlock? Not that it isn’t terribly amusing, but…”
. It suddenly made John realize a few things he would had preferred to have forgotten; that he was average in appearance, short, middle-aged, losing his military figure, and, possibly, might not be able to hold the attention of the one thing he loved more than life itself—Sherlock.
Sherlock lifted his hand and slapped John lightly on the belly. “Shut it. What I’m

“But threats and torture
Sherlock obliged. He straddled John’s hips, his own erection bobbing coquetishly in front of John’s chest. John eyed it keenly. “I don’t get to see it like this often. You usually finish yourself off before I...” he wrapped a hand around the slender staff and began to stroke it with long, sensuous movements.
“Ah, yes, Fleur. Sorry. Now...”

John didn’t even bother to call out to his friend. He knew there would be no response. He removed his jacket and hung it next to the belstaff greatcoat that hadn’t seen use in weeks.
The officer turned back to staring at Sherlock as he replied, “Okay, thanks. You know…” he pointed at Sherlock,”you look familiar…”
The two of them sat, their faces only a hands-breadth away, both of them breathing hard. Sherlock’s face was still rumpled in anger, while John merely stared him down, waiting for the storm to pass. Part of him wanted to break out into laughter from the ludicrousness of the situation. Sherlock knew he couldn’t best John in a tussle, for all of his extra 4 inches of height. John gazed calmly into his friend’s eyes and said, softly, “Are you done with your snit fit yet? Or shall we have a

Unleashing one more blast, Toby ran down the corridor to join them. Sherlock eyed him suspiciously.
“No,” Sherlock replied. His eyes were actually just a tad misty when John looked into them. “No, I don’t mind. Not one bit.” He stretched up for a kiss and John complied gladly. Suddenly, his face hardened again. “But only when we are alone,” he added, sternly, pointing a finger at John. “It wouldn’t do for Scotland Yard to...”
Toby growled unappreciatively.
“Really, boys, this is getting to be ridiculous. Who has it out for you?”
“Well, your ass of a boyfriend…”

should let me in on these things, John. We could have been here long before now,” he said as he managed to untie one set of restraints.
“Dr. John H. Watson.”
John nodded. “True. But a good doctor has to be able to look deeper. I didn’t.” His face relaxed as he asked, “Is any of what she said true, Sherlock?”
“No, it’s not that far, and she’s not that heavy,” Sherlock stated with certainty. As they walked home, the sound of thunder could be heard in the distance. “Smells like rain coming, and soon.”
John repositioned himself so that his extremities were tucking the comforter around Sherlock. “I am creating an anti-depression sushi roll.”

Sherlock sat down and crossed his long legs, his expression defiant. “I told your daughter nothing, John. Those were all her surmises.”

“Same as any man, John.”
Sherlock considered. “Better. I think I could lie on it without repercussions…”
Sherlock froze.

Silence. Sherlock was trying to contain himself, regain his composure before speaking. When he finally did, his voice was subdued. “Women.” It almost sounded like a question rather than a response.
A chuckle escaped John’s lips as he turned to look, side-eyed, at Sherlock. “Of course, we can, but let’s have some breakfast first, shall we?”
John caught the headline and froze. It read, in big letters, “Fishmonger killer caught by NSY.” In a sub-headline, it read, “Hatman fails to solve case!” He gasped involuntarily, causing Sherlock to look in his direction. John brushed the paper off the table, but not before Sherlock had caught the headlines with those all-seeing quicksilver eyes.

John sighed gustily. “Sorry, sorry...God, I keep having to say I’m sorry for hitting you, Sherlock. It isn’t what I want to do, it just...explodes from inside me, you know?” Sherlock nodded sagely. “And then I’m left to pick up the pieces of my fucking temper...”
But Sherlock couldn’t hear him anymore. What little conscious mind he had left was busily cataloging all the various sensations associated with being fucked by a cherished lover with a huge dick. His grasp on the headboard over John’s head almost cracked the wood as he leaned back, trying to impale himself even farther. He could feel John’s head lean in and a warm, clever tongue teasing his nipples to the hardness of pencil erasers. He had never realized before that there was such a direct connection between his nipples and his cock, which decided it wanted to get in on the fun, too. It was bigger than it had
“SHUT UP, MRS. HUDSON!” they both yelled.
He finally reached the high street and recognized where he was. He knew the way to Baker Street; he also knew the way to the pub where he had left Della. Doubt she’s there anymore, and, if she was, why would she want to have anything to do with me? I’m nothing. Without Sherlock, I’m nothing.
“Order some takeaway, put on the telly, spend a quiet night in?” John suggested, his voice gentle and amused. He knew what Sherlock had feared to hear.

“Yeah, but…”
“Tell me how that happened, John,” Ella said, soothingly.
That high-boned face went flat again. “Nothing. I am beyond salvation. I have no reason to continue.”
Full lips flat-lined obstinately.
John hesitated before continuing. “This new guy...”
Sherlock’s eyes widened as he considered John’s offer, a quirk of the lips indicating that he was not, in the least, offended.

John changed his movement from rocking to thrusting, pressing his pubic bone down on Sherlock’s heaving cock. Sherlock moaned deeper, thrusting upward into John’s groin, desperate to increase contact and friction.
A dry chuckle escaped John’s throat. “Well, as soon as I saw those panties, I got

A thoughtful pause. “Hmmm. Sixteen divided by mattress equals…”

“John?” A jostle at his elbow. “John! Are you woolgathering during an investigation?” John jolted back to the present to find Sherlock’s sharp quicksilver eyes peering into his own, concern and annoyance battling for dominance on his chiseled face.
John heaved himself out of his all-too-comfy chair and headed toward the kitchen. “So how did you sleep last night?” he asked as he set the kettle on the stovetop and turned up the gas. “I was so exhausted I just conked out.”
The two men smiled at each other. “Yes, I think we can,” John replied as Sherlock gestured for the bill.
“Well! I
“Lightning flash scared her. Too close, I think. Woke her up in a panic,” Sherlock replied in clipped tones as Rosie sobbed and tried to burrow into Sherlock’s chest. “She’ll calm in a few, but I think that, maybe, we should take her downstairs with us for a bit.”
John and Sherlock exchanged alarmed glances as they scampered around the flat, then around the entire building, searching for any spot that might be accessible to a small child. They found nothing.

“I’m not even going to pretend that that made sense.”
“Piss off, Mycroft.”

“He told Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock growled. “Dammit, I
that he assumed when he was putting facts together and extrapolating data. He steepled his fingertips in front of his chin and stared off into nothingness. John held up his hand to forestall Agent Doyle from interrupting Sherlock’s reverie.
One corner of John’s mouth quirked into a smile. “Perhaps, but I don’t think, ‘Oh, God, John, yes!’ should be it.” He sipped his own tea. “Too misleading.”
Finally, one typically cloudy day, Lestrade showed up on their doorstep, requesting that they attend a new crime scene. Even before John could mention it, Lestrade put up a hand and said, “We already have arranged for an interpreter to be on site. A good one; I know how fast Sherlock can talk.”

everything,” he would say imperiously whenever some fool at NSY would question his deductions. No, he could not afford the handicap of not knowing exactly where he was and what was going on.
John dropped the case on Sherlock’s table and sat down in his own chair. He sat primly, uncomfortably, with his hands in his lap, like an errant child.
Sherlock sighed, closing his eyes as he composed himself.
John crawled over the six-foot worm on the floor and trotted upstairs to his own room. He had some research to do.

“Are you OK? Did I do it wrong?” Sherlock asked, fingers frozen in place, deathly afraid he’d just hurt or injured John.

, all green palms and sun-drenched colors surrounding a pool full of turquoise water, and the strip of beach beyond, where the breakers made for a panoramic vista only found on carefully photographed post cards. The gentle breeze and the distant sound of the surf were wonderfully calming and filled John with a contented lassitude.
‘other lines’?”
“Jean.” Softly.
He looked up at me in amazement. I gazed lovingly down at him and said, “There’s so much for you to experience, John. Are you ready?”
“No, sir,” a youngish officer chimed in. “Everything is just as it happened.”
As he entered the toasty warmth of the kitchen, he heard a strange sort of music emanating from his and Sherlock’s closed bedroom door. It sounded sort of whiny and nasally and vaguely middle-eastern, from the snippets he could hear. It was accompanied by muted chiming sounds and light, rhythmic footsteps. His curiosity piqued, John walked stealthily to the door and listened intently. Yes, there was

considerate?”
“Oh, holy fuck, babe,” John sighed, reverently. He grasped a handful of bum on either side, obviously resisting the urge to plunge deeper. “How’s that for you, love?” he growled.
“Shot, you say? Did you see who did it?”
Sherlock tried to open his eyes but couldn’t. His eyelids felt like they weighed 10 stone. Besides that, he could feel that something had been wrapped around his eyes rather tightly. There were also traces of a sweet smell that he couldn’t quite place yet due to a pounding headache that was blurring his reasoning processes. He was way too groggy to remember what had happened precisely and Sherlock was, if anything, precise. There were too many things he didn’t know and he

Sherlock nodded and did as he was told. As he felt the crown of John’s cock breach his body, he bore down and was rewarded with the slick, conical head of John’s cock sliding effortlessly into his entrance. As soon as it was in, his ring of muscle snapped shut behind it, trapping it inside his body.

“Get on the fucking bed, Mastermind.”
I just grinned at him. “Welcome home, John. I’ll explain later...”
My eyelids slid inexorably downward. It was impossible to stop them; the morphine had seen to that. My last glimpse of blue eyes and I felt ready to face the unknown. I whispered
“Explain,” Mycroft whispered.
Well aware that John was still grieving the loss of his wife, whatever the circumstances, Sherlock provided whatever support he could with child-rearing and bringing in more income. He accepted cases he would have turned down years ago, accepting pretty much anything that paid. He had learned to keep his mouth shut and his opinions of the merits of the case to himself, all for the good of his two flatmates. It was galling, sometimes, but he would do

“Kiss him, Daddy,” came a girlish voice from under the table.
“Normally I would suggest ‘the talking cure’, but, in this case, I would recommend something more. Do you think you can get him to talk to you about it? Let him vent his feelings?”
I rolled my eyes. “Just call it ‘spiritual guidance’.”
Sherlock hauled out his phone and practically yelled, “
“Likewise, Agent Doyle,” Sherlock replied, with a nod.
Sherlock sighed. “This is
He could feel her hand on the small of his back, making little circles with her fingertips. Sherlock always liked to do that whenever they were together and John’s pyjama pants slid down a bit, exposing a hint of bum. He thought about those long, limber fingers, their touch so light and nimble. He would lean over and tease John’s neck with lips and tongue until the universe had narrowed down to just the two of them…
“Less than perfect. Less than the exact opposite of his father. Less than completely and totally
“Good night, Rosie,” they both said.
What happened next was a mystery to all involved. One second, John and Sherlock were seated in the back seat of the boat, with a goodly length between them and the next boat in line; the next, Sherlock found himself in the water, being held down by a pair of strong hands that were tightening around his throat. He couldn’t hear anything but the rush and pounding of blood in his ears as he struggled for release and breath.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and said, peeved. “
“Sherlock, promise me something,” John said.

Rosie’s lower lip stuck out aggressively.
The last thing I remembered was feeling warm, drowsy, and very loved by the man who held me in his arms. I tried—
A dry chuckle, then, “While your concern and outrage are appreciated, Mycroft, I believe the matter is...handled.”
A tremulous hand rose from the bed and angled in front of Sherlock’s face as he stared at it.”Et mes autres centres moteur? Qu'en est-il de ceux-là?”
The form beneath him stopped struggling. A silver-gray eye peeped out from the rolls of fabric surrounding his head. “A sushi roll,” he said, as if he was certain the speaker was insane.
Silence, except for the sound of the bed squeaking in protest.
“So, Sergei, you said you want to get back into the network again. What, exactly, are you looking for?”
answer, then I would say that I would want you to...fuck me.” He pinned John with the intensity of his eyes.
John smiled up at me and said. “I don’t ever want to be without you again.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Oh, for God’s sake, Mycroft, let the man go. Why must you be such a show-off? He won’t learn how to obey properly if you kill him!” He favored his older sibling with a disapproving look.
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded. “Give me the phone. I will call M on his secret line and arrange for him to come here for a meeting.
“Papa, why are you giving me a bath tonight?” she asked, her words slurring a little as tiny waves on the surface of the water sloshed against her lips. Her full pout was submerged in bubbles.
“Oh.” John looked at Sherlock. “And what is

of us to do that. You concentrate on getting clean, and I’ll do the worrying, okay?” He leaned closely and whispered, “That’s what adults are best at, you know.”

, I could be a rich man and get back everything I lost! And you will help me do it!” He patted Sherlock on the face twice before slapping him, hard. Sherlock’s left ear was ringing like churchbells as Sergei left.
Agent Doyle smiled. “And I’m still Agent Doyle, but it’s been an honor working with you, Mr… Sherlock.”
“No,” the older man said, rudely. “I want to talk to him
“John,” he whispered. “Thank God.”
The smug smirk on John’s face hadn’t faded yet because, at long last, he and Sherlock had been honest and upfront with each others about their “relationship” and how so much miscommunication had led to some totally-unnecessary dramatics over the years. Sherlock had been so soft, so tender, so...
She bounced in the tub, setting the water sloshing. “Fleur! I want to be called Fleur!”
Without further ado, John grabbed the tube and, as Sherlock straddled his hips, he slathered Sherlock’s entrance with its contents. It was cool at first, but John’s diligent attention to his anus soon had Sherlock completely distracted. One finger, two fingers, three...It was a good things Sherlock was already on his knees because they would have given out by now if he had been standing.
Sherlock grinned over his finger-laced hands. “What? That you’re every bit as daft as I am?”
As his head began to clear, he realized that the scent still clinging to his nostrils was chloroform, a very old but reliable method for knocking out one’s victim and rendering him pliable. Much less high-class than, say, Magnussen (who was dead, thank God, and whose execution at
“What’s wrong, love?” Softer, more gentle tone.
Sherlock pouted slightly. “You mean, we can’t do both?”
“Whenever the two of you are finished silently communicating, I’ll tell you about my date,” John huffed as he walked over to his chair. Rosie had thrown her arms around John’s waist, so he ended up dragging his daughter behind him until he unlatched her and sat down. She curled up in his lap and sighed happily.
Sherlock sighed. “Unfortunately, yes, John, I do. This is Sergei, the man who bestowed upon me so many badges of honor during my imprisonment in Serbia.”

Sherlock’s eyes had a faraway look in them for a moment, then they snapped back to John. “Yes,” he said, emphatically, with a single nod. “Yes. I want to. Show me what to do.”
“Hmmmm?” came the less-than-coherent response.
“…Causing it to slam into the brick wall to his right. Yeah, I know, I was there, remember?” John snapped in exasperation, running one hand over his face. “So he’s got multiple blood clots from the
Sherlock smiled warmly. “Yes, like me. Is daddy...was very strict and tried to make sure your daddy only liked ladies.”
“Sherlock...”
Lestrade led John to a nearby panda car and directed the officer driving it to 221B Baker St.
“Piss off,” John shot back.
“On the contrary,” Sherlock retorted, saltily, “I’m
He looked in the living room for Sherlock but the place was empty, so he bent to the task of putting away the groceries.
Once the storm had passed, John sat up and ran his fingers through his husband’s hair. “You’re amazing, you know that?”
A deep sigh signaled surrender. “I got it wrong,” he struggled out.
With every ring, Sherlock’s heart sank just a little more.
“I paid the bill and left without her. I’m sure she could get a cab home. Or maybe one of the men at the bar she was flirting with could help out, I don’t know and I don’t care!” John was a bit red in the face by this time. Rosie snuggled up to him and he hugged her tight. “I guess the only women in my life that I can rely on are you and Mrs. Hudson, eh, Rosie?”

what,” Sherlock shot back. “Mrs. Hudson is the finest woman I’ve ever known and I’ve looked after her, even protected her from her beast of a husband.” He crossed his arms pointedly.
The bedroom door creaked open, barely audible over the sound of frying bacon. John tried his best to ignore it as he poked at the crinkling meat in his pan. Grease spatters decorated the front of his apron, which he had put on solely to protect his robe from just such an assault.
“What, you didn’t think I was going to stay a dumpy old lady til my next incarnation, did you, John?” the voice came back.
because your sister was born 7 months later; NOT a premature birth, I can assure you, according to medical records. Stayed with him entirely
Very carefully, John lowered himself down upon Sherlock’s heaving chest, careful not to cause any new discomfort to his husband’s sunburnt back. Sherlock’s eyes were closed, his face stunning in repose. His panting breaths required that his tempting lips remain parted. John leaned down and kissed them tenderly, receiving a warm smile in return.
“Now, squeeze some of it out into the hand you’re going to use. Don’t be stinting with it. Where you’re going, we really don’t want friction burn.”

The tall, lean form of Sherlock Holmes, wrapped in his usual belstaff longcoat, stepped out into the stark lighting around his brother and husband, hands in pockets. He looked down upon them both, head cocked to one side in appraisal. “Thank you for finding him for me, Mycroft,” he said, his voice ever-so-soft. “I...wasn’t thinking clearly.”
Sergei laughed. “Yes, I could see how you would need a fool to run your errands and give you admiration, Dmitri...oh, excuse me,
to believe they had the upper hand. I have…” he reached into his shirt pocket, “a recording of their conversation when they believed I was destined for a lunch date in the Everglades. This should help you to put them away.” He handed the tiny recorder to the agent. “There are references on there to the boys’ mother. I would appreciate it if you could keep her in the dark as much as possible. She shouldn’t have to suffer from her sons’ misdeeds. She’s a good woman,” he said, his voice betraying the warmth he felt toward his landlady.
“Oh, fuck, yes,” Sherlock agreed, his own breath quickening from the excitement of discovery and the administration of pleasure to his partner. He pulled back slowly, his fingertips searching, until they found it and rubbed into it. John hips shot into the air again, higher than before. “Fucking Christ!” he yelled.

The end result was that John dated occasionally but never married. He said he could never find anyone like me. I called him an idiot. He smiled as though he had heard me.
The aggravation was slowly growing. Too many questions, and the answers were too elusive, as things currently stood.
“You are sexually and romantically interested in both men and women. You spent years while in the army bedding many women, am I correct?” He looked up and John nodded. “Also some men, like Sholto. However, you’ve only ever dated women in the time that we’ve lived together, although I’ve seen you flirt with other men in that time, too.”
“Can I effect physical change in this state?” I probed, wondering at the sudden sense of misgiving that had overtaken me. “Can I

“Wait until he pisses on you,” Lestrade warned. “He does that to people he doesn’t like.”

“I guess we should get more…exercise while we’re here, since it seems to do your appetite a world of good,” John noted.

Sherlock caught John’s eye from where he stood with the interpreter and smiled, nodding in acknowledgment. John’s mouth twisted unpleasantly as he turned away and pretended to consult his notes.
Sherlock’s eyebrows rose appraisingly. “You damage it, you replace it.”
“Come here, love,” John motioned from his supine position in the center of the bed. Sherlock started to remove the rest of his outfit but John stated, firmly, “No. Keep them on.” When Sherlock gave him a challenging look, he added, “Please.”
Sherlock gazed at Rosie silently for a moment, sighed, then said, “You can’t tell

John shrugged. “I would have stopped at any time you requested.”
She nodded very deliberately. “Yes, I am.”

“John, then why…?”
“OH, REALLY? AND WHY IS THAT?”
a girlish voice yelled from upstairs.
As John and I watched, Mycroft sat down in my chair and cried. I had never felt so touched. I had forgotten how much I had loved him.
John clambered slowly to his feet, his head spinning. Once he had regained his balance, Mycroft asked, sharply, “Why are you taking your rage out on my brother?” There was an unpleasant, accusative edge to his voice.
There was a ghostly
Resigned sigh. “I’ve created a monster.”
For one of the few times in his life, Sherlock was speechless. Eyes closed, mouth open, he reveled in the sensation of having the man he adored inside of him. He wiggled his hips a bit to explore the sensation…
He wandered into the kitchen and through the short hallway to the bedroom. As he stepped inside and closed the door, he could see the sheet-wrapped figure in the bed, unmoving. That figure was once John’s everything. Hopefully, it would be again someday.

He nervously licked his lips as he pondered his next move. John was a man of action and just hanging around the flat while others did the necessary leg work was abhorrent to his nature. Before he could give it a second thought, he was down the stairs and out the front door, ready to hail a cab, when his mobile rang. It was Billy.
He’d had this particular experience before, when he’d had a really bad nightmare about losing Sherlock and had sought him out, wanting to make sure he was really all right.

I knocked a book off a shelf full of books John had been intending to read but hadn’t gotten to yet. Lestrade walked over and picked it up. His hand shook ever-so-slightly as he read aloud the title-- “Idiot’s Delight.”

He lost his license to practice, became an alcoholic mess, and ended up on his own slab a few years later, dead of undetermined, though suspicious, causes. He had been about to go to the police about some matter that had happened a few years before; claimed they hadn’t held up their end of the bargain, so he was going to turn the tables on them. Sounds like he had been on someone’s payroll and they stopped bankrolling his lifestyle after he was no longer useful to them.”
After a few minutes of heavy silence and tea-sipping, John cleared his throat and asked blandly, “Is there anything I can bring back for you?”

There was an odd stinging in his eyes as he closed his notebook and walked back toward Baker Street alone.

“YES!”
He was led before a tall figure, dressed all in black armor, wearing a polished black helmet and a full-coverage breathing mask, which augmented the sound of his labored breathing. The two stood, toe to toe, eyeing each other. Finally, Sherlock spoke.
