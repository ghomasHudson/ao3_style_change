“Uh...It’s not,” Greg backpedals, also glancing at Sherlock and receiving a death glare. “Not at all. I just… He doesn’t usually invite people over, you know?”
“The voice,” John exclaims in hushed amazement. His eyes are fixed on Sherlock’s face, searching with intensity. It makes him feel like he has never really been seen by anyone before and the detective stands still as a stone to let John take in all he wants. And then John surprises him. “When you have eliminated the impossible…”
“I wouldn’t say I kicked his ass,” he remarks, “but I don’t mind fucking up his plans one bit.”
“Sounds delicious,” the doctor replies with a grin.
Yeah!
When is Mycroft going to start bothering our duo again?
Sorry, friends, I'm doing it to you again. No spoilers.
John just presses his lips together into a thin line and grumbles nearly inaudibly. He has no business being jealous. No place warding others away from Sherlock as though he were his. Sure, they spent the night together, that annoying voice in the back of his mind reminds him. They had sex, but that does not mean they are together. It does not mean Sherlock wants to do it again. They are able to step back into their lives and friendship seamlessly. This little jaunt proves it. There is no awkwardness between them, just some initial misunderstanding and then back to their kind of normal. If John is honest with himself, he has never felt so comfortable with anyone in his life. Not even Bill, and that realization strikes him with the force of a bullet.
“It is at that.”
“You left,” John remarked pleasantly, the joke plain in his voice. Sherlock had none of it, remaining stone faced and cocking a brow.
3. What will he find there if he doesn't?
The two gaze at each as the taller man takes a small step closer and looks at John with an open, honest expression. John’s heart skips a beat while Sherlock’s next words give him a heart attack:
Sherlock hesitantly steps close again and John takes his hand, smile brightening.

Greg fans: Will he be able to keep John's secret?
“Doesn’t matter,” he slurs. The sound of sirens reaches their ears and Sherlock takes his eyes off the man to see a police boat heading toward them, along with three other boats that saw the flare. Moriarty’s next words recapture his attention with their unbridled cruelty. “You’re too late to save your precious John Watson. He’s dead at the bottom of the lake and you will
She slips out the door, waving and pulling it shut behind. Sherlock purses his lips and turns his head to face Greg, who frowns back at him. The GM holds out a cautioning hand to Sherlock upon seeing his expression.
"Very good, Sherlock. I love the way your mind works. We're the same, you and I, in so many ways."
What a chapter this was to write/edit. I just want you all to know, as if you didn't already, I go absolutely out of my way to Jim a complete bastard. The biggest, baddest dick EVER. And he has cooked up quite a scheme to keep these lovers apart this time. Enter, the tears.
What I said in the summary.
What will happened when they start taking cases again?
(See the end of the chapter for
Well, now what shall we do now? Perhaps a little Q & A? Or just the Q, as it were because I'm not giving you any hints as to what happens next. Mwahaha.
John tries to breathe steadily when he has the regulator and ground himself as they continue to sink. He passes it over again and watches as Greg takes a few deep breaths. What the hell is Greg doing here? Sherlock didn’t bother to call the fucking police, but brought Greg along so he could risk his life too? And how the hell does Greg know how to scuba dive? Where the buggering hell did that boat come from? Neither of them ever mentioned a boat or scuba diving or so much as fucking swimming. Greg was definitely not on the boat with Sherlock. At least, not by the time John saw him.
“She does get up to things, doesn’t she?” John snickers.
“Okay, okay,” John responds, his tone growing defensive, “and I didn’t say much.”
6. Are we going to get the happy ending we all want or are you going to go all Lady Jane of Angst and Pain on us and make a sequel to this one where they finally get together in the midst of some other mystery? HOLY SHIT, JANE, DON'T DO THAT!!!
“To Smacks,” Trixie raises a glass. “To the surgeons and steady hands. To a speedy recovery.”
John returns Sherlock’s gaze, determined not to look anywhere but at the man’s face no matter how much he wants to. He opens his mouth to speak and the action is too much, as his eyes betray him and glance down at that mouth. Sherlock steps impossibly close, cups his hands around John’s cheeks, and swoops in.
Dance, dance, dance
Love, Jane
Sherlock’s eyes widen and sparkle with intrigue. Neither Mrs. Hudson nor Greg has ever seen him so invested in a person who wasn’t on wheels. Mrs. Hudson snickers.
“She really has put her trust in you,” he says quietly. “Yes, I was poisoned. I made sure everyone was told it was a bad case of food poisoning to avoid panic, but a couple of them knew what really happened. They could tell.”
“I seriously doubt that,” Sherlock retorts smugly.
“It was the late 80s,” Sherlock shrugs. “I don’t know what it was like in London, but things were pretty lax and the suburb was like a small town where nothing bad happens. They all knew us and we just went around the cul de sac and up the street, not far at all. Our parents knew it was safe and that we could be trusted. Mom used to say I was an adult at five.”
“Sure,” Greg answered after a pause with a look that told John he wanted to say more. He knew John and the whole situation far too well.
Love, Jane
“I will resume the investigation, Sherlock,” Mycroft said in a low voice. “My apologies.”
“Does he know you?” she asks in a small voice.
“I haven’t told anyone,” Greg protests indignantly.
“What?” he answers in a clipped tone.
She’s saying, come get me
“They weren’t accidents, Dr. Watson,” Billy’s voice is stern and his eyes are so intense a pang of discomfort jets down John’s spine. “Every one of those incidents was sabotage.”
Sherlock fights with these emotions he cannot show, trying to master them. He must maintain control like never before and tamp down his instinct to leap into the water for John or this is all for naught. He has to stick to the plan.
Fuck.
“NO.”
When the last of the ladies have entered the elevators and the doors have closed, Sherlock turns to see John leaning against the wall in wait. Sherlock walks to him and nods in the direction of the restaurant entrance. John nods in return and follows. Soon they are seated at a quiet table in the corner, each with a drink. Sherlock watches John take a sip of his scotch and then look at the liquid with approval. He turns his eyes to the coach after placing the glass on the table.
(See the end of the chapter for
Until we meet again, let's mull over these questions....
“She told you it wasn’t an accident.”
And the fact that Mycroft was helping him is just another sign that he has seen the light.
“As are you,” Sherlock stated. He rested both elbows on the bar and laced his fingers in between, a calculating edge to his gaze. “You’re here alone.”
Jammer - the skater who skates around the track and aims to pass all of the blockers on the opposite team. A point is scored for each opposing team blocker the jammer passes.
. “Now you’re quite the opposite.”
Sherlock hears the hint of desperation in John’s voice and stops. He inhales deeply and then drops down into the chair again. He takes John’s hands in his own, stroking the backs of his hands with his thumbs. Sherlock isn’t sure if it is meant to calm John or himself, but realizes he does not mind either way as he watches the doctor shift to a more comfortable position. John blows out a long breath and closes his eyes. Sherlock watches him, sees every feature on his countenance and sighs. He leans forward and rests his forehead to John’s. The connection point is warm and radiates heat down Sherlock’s neck and into his body. It does not stop until it reaches his toes and he hopes John feels the same. No, he knows it does because it is not simply a physical connection. It is one that runs deep into their souls.
“But I’m so...ordinary,” John finally laughs, unable to think of anything more articulate. For all his intelligence, Sherlock completely disarms him.
1) Now that they know and Moriarty doesn't know they know, nor does Janine know that they know, but THEY know that they know - Who's on first again? What's on second and I don't know who's on third.😉 - what will they do next?
John stops short. He stares at Sherlock a moment with wide eyes, his muscles tense. He looks as though he has either given himself away or been caught in the cookie jar. What had he been about to say?
“What?” John’s brow knits in confusion.
* And most of all, when the fuck is Sherlock going to finally going to get his head out of his ass and propose to John?? (We all know that's what Sherlock really wants. Am I right?)
What ever will happen?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just what kind of evidence do we need, hm?” Sherlock growls in a deep voice. “A bottle of poison with Moriarty’s name on it? A body? Would that be enough for these incompetents?”
I'm told even subscription to an author notifications aren't working, so I hope this comes to all of you somehow.
Sherlock misses the rest, thinking back on that night. It had been bliss. He’d still had a nightmare and woke. It was his first nightmare, in fact, but he had held John close after and then slept soundly, in spite of his concerns. Every night since, he and John had simply climbed into bed, bid one another good night, and gone to sleep. Yes, they had snuggled close and pecked one another on the lips a few times, but nothing terribly serious. Sherlock told him he would not rush, not push him into anything, and Sherlock aimed to keep his promise. Each night, Sherlock had a nightmare and got up to work after, leaving John to his slumber.
Anybody see that coming? Mary Morstan, WTF. Is she really just the gardener?
1. Can John escape this?
“I don’t know, John, but we can’t go hurling accusations around without concrete proof, especially with something as serious as this.”
”It’s no trouble at all, John,” he says firmly, placing both items on the counter. John’s lips are curled into the beginnings of a smile when Sherlock looks to him again. The coach actually gives himself a once-over before asking, “What?”
Poisoned?! What the heck is that all about?
Sherlock smirks and caps the water bottle, carrying it with him when he walks to the door. He should take a minute and hang his suits for the bouts, but they will be fine. He can always steam them while he showers if they wrinkle.
John nearly spits a mouthful of wine across the table, swallowing quickly and rushing the glass to his lips to catch any drips. His eyes blink wide.
Why the hell would Jim have a gardener?
He gapes at John, his mind suddenly back in focus. His eyes dart around the room and at John’s face. Seeing no trace of Moriarty, Sherlock sighs and lets his body fall limp onto the bed.
“Really, Lestrade,” Sherlock begins with a smile on his face and an exaggerated tone of irritation in his voice, “I cannot maintain any level of success if you continue to interrupt practices.”
“Coach!”
Sherlock had just turned to face John when two rather rambunctious couples collided with the doctor’s back, shoving him into Sherlock. The detective hit the brick wall with a thud and it knocked the breath from his lungs. John was pressed tightly against him, the other couples still right behind his back. Sherlock gasped when John’s hand cupped his face.
John tried, he did, but lying to Sherlock was too much for him AND he’s that much closer to seeing his true feelings for Sherlock. How great is the moment when Sherlock just  blurts it out? “I love you!” and he doesn’t try to take it back. He just lets it be. John’s reaction is the greatest too. “You...you can’t. You haven’t known me five minutes.” Hahaha! I love it! I mean, I’m clearly biased so please let me know what you think. I don’t want to beg, but I’m not above it and it has been a bad week. Any encouragement is more than welcome and VERY appreciated. You all mean so much to me.
And then there's the other problem for John and Sherlock. How long will it take them to talk about it this time? Will Sherlock ever get his head out of his ass?
”Oh, yeah?” John leans away from the taller man and cocks a brow. “What did I say?”
5. Just what were his past relationships like? How have they shaped who he is and how he views love?
“They tried to kill her, Greg. If John hadn’t been there, they may have succeeded and with the threat on his…” Sherlock stops suddenly, his voice full of emotion. Greg’s eye shift between the two of them as John gives the taller man an undisguised look saying ‘What the fuck’. Greg clenches his jaw and presses his lips into a thin line. This is 100 percent not on. He may not be ready to jump on the Moriarty is a killer bandwagon, but they are
“Of course!” Mrs. Hudson’s draconian persona melts away and she turns for the door in a flurry. She looks back at them as she opens it. “I’ll have Allie give it to you this afternoon. We’ll talk again then. Oh! I’m late for a lunch with Daniel and Craig.”
Da Da DAAAAAA!
“Don’t worry, Janine,” John’s eyes soften as he turns them toward her. His face relaxes and his body language is open, honest and comforting. “I’ll see you through it every step. You’ll be fine. Trust me.”
“Okay, okay,” John almost whispers. He clears his throat and looks at Sherlock with more of his usual certainty. “So, how do we find him? Maybe Greg…”
John sits back in his chair and his shoulders drop. His expression full of pain and empathy, he waits for Sherlock to continue. He looks exactly how Sherlock imagines he did when Coach Jones broke the news.
“No, I get it, but we still can’t accuse anyone of anything on the basis of that,” he counters.
Anyway, enough of the psyche of Jane. Let's just say I can’t tell you how happy I am to stumble into this world of derby and Sherlock and John today. This is a shorter chapter, but I hope you feel the same way and find quiet, happy respite like I did. Love you all!
“And you didn’t tell anyone else?”
Sherlock gives him a small smile and squeezes his hand. The corners of John’s mouth turn up. Sherlock feels… He feels happy and contented. His only source of disquiet is that John will not be with them on the plane. Janine may need him, but it still feels wrong. He does not want to leave John here.
“Hello, John,” a deep baritone, all dark chocolate and velvet rumbled from the man’s chest. John’s lips parted and he nearly gasped, but swallowed it down along with his surprise. How the hell did this man, with perfect cupid’s bow lips, know his name? “I’ve seen you here before. We have a friend in common.”
Love, Jane
“Thanks,” John replies, dipping his chin in embarrassment. He looks up at Sherlock from under dark lashes that have no business being so long. Flip. “I’m sorry about all this. I hate to impose.”
Will Sherlock ever propose?
The two men swim over to the side of the boat and Greg helps John turn so they are facing one another. He glances at John’s wrists with concern and then grabs onto a narrow, metal ladder fastened to the boat’s side from top down into the water. Greg must use it to climb back on after diving. He holds onto John’s torso just under his arm, mercifully on the side without the gunshot wound. They both kick their legs to keep afloat while looking at one another.
(See the end of the chapter for
“John, I…” Sherlock ducked his head and then met John’s eyes. “I don’t want to drive you away.”
“Were they always playing them when it happened?” John is intrigued.
He looked at the man in front of him with wonder. He felt as though he had known Sherlock all his life, despite knowing virtually nothing about him. It was a feeling, a touch. John’s hand found Sherlock’s where it hung at his side and opened his mouth to speak.
A burst of laughter popped from John’s mouth before he could stop himself. It was so loud that he quickly pressed his lips together again and glanced toward the man for fear of drawing too much attention and giving them away. He need not have worried. The club was far too noisy for anyone to notice. Sherlock smirked, his eyes bright with amusement.
An interrogation and some snuggles.
There's one more chapter in this part, friends, and the boys are getting ever closer to Jim as their relationship grows.
“No,” Sherlock’s eyes are wide.
“Go, go, go!” Hella answers and the three maintain the wall while Groot skates away from the pack and all the way around the track. When she rejoins, it is with the other group of women where she slams into one. With a satisfied gleam in her eye, Groot knocks her on her ass and shoves toward a second skater. The Woman takes the opportunity to follow behind Groot and dart around the whole group. The fourth blocker lunges to pick her up and misses, leaving The Woman to glide away free and clear, blowing a kiss as she goes and earning lead jammer. One of the trio lashes out at Groot in frustration, dropping her to her knees and drawing a penalty. She heads for the box as The Woman weaves her way around her own teammates and the opposing team with such grace and skill, earning four more points for Rock City.
“More kick ass and take names? I believe that’s what you Americans say.”
Sherlock fell silent again, his lips clamping shut as though they had acted of their own accord and he had finally managed to regain control of them. John stared into his horrified face and blinked. The initial surge of anger John had felt began to drain from his body, not even replaced with shock like Sherlock. To his surprise, John felt completely at ease and something he had not experienced in months sparked at the back of his mind: the warm glow of happiness. It bloomed through his mind and filled his body with light energy that John readily embraced.
“Yeah?” John asked with anticipation. He had looked like a child at Christmastime, his bright blue eyes shining.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock takes a little trip to get help from a "friend".
It started the moment they met. There was an electricity in the air when he laid eyes on the stunning man, all tall lines and dark curls and skin, so much skin! Why was it all covered with that tailored suit? When Sherlock Holmes looked up at John to take the offered mobile from his hand, John felt the air around them crack. And those eyes. Not quite blue or green or grey, almost silver, like a kaleidoscope of the universe in just those two beautiful eyes. John later decided they were most definitely silver with small flecks of grey that somehow reflected blue and green. Chameleons. Just like the man they belong to, who can put on another personality at a moment’s notice for a case.
“I came to tell you straight away. I thought you’d want to know,” he pauses to look at the coach with laughing eyes, “like I was saying.”
John fixes Mycroft with hard eyes and stalks forward, imaging the man can see the angry smoke rising off his head. For his part, Mycroft puts on that smile of forced pleasantry and opens his mouth to greet the doctor. John comes to a quick stop and cuts him off.
Hella hooted as she rolled by her partner, slapping her ass on the way. Sherlock had signaled for more laps and then glanced at John as his laughter grew even louder, tears actually beginning to roll from his eyes. Sherlock had grinned at the reckless abandon.
“The doctor was just looking at something for me,” Mary supplies angrily.
“Right, right. No need to tell me anything. I only love you, that’s all.” John sits up and leans into a pillow up against the headboard. “It was Moriarty.”
“Would you take a look?” she sways her hips and her breasts move with them. She continues in a low, sultry voice. “You can...touch them if you want. In fact, I think you’d better give me a full body examination.”
“Hey, Coach!” Harry ‘HardOn Skates’ Dewhurst calls from the track. He shifts his gaze to her in response. “You know your phone is ringing, right? Turned up the volume so you wouldn’t miss a call from Lestrade, wasn’t it?
How'd you like this chapter, friends? I love it. As well as the next few chaps. They remind me of my honeymoon in Cornwall. It was gorgeous and so much fun. A friend of my husband's was there with us. I know, I know, odd for a honeymoon, but it was brilliant. He grew up in Cornwall and took us all around. His family still lives there and we met up with all of them every night for dinner. He even gifted us his sister's cottage that she rents out. If you ever have the chance to go there, GO.
“Do you?” John asks thoughtfully. “God, I need to get myself a real place. Having my own equipment would be perfect.”
Now, question time!
Also, John kidnapped AGAIN?!?!
Love, Jane
Sherlock smiles at the memory almost wistfully. When he meets John’s eyes again, the doctor wears the same expression. John swallows a bite and props his elbow on the table to rest his chin on one hand.
Sorry this is such a short chapter, y'all. I'm hoping to get the next one out faster now. I must say I'm having fun editing it, but...of course I won't say why.
(See the end of the chapter for
John breathes slowly into the regulator when Greg hands it over and pushes down his fears. He cannot let himself panic, but how the urge does grow and it is all he can do to tamp it down. Sherlock said Moriarty would not kill him, that he wanted to destroy him instead and leave him to live with the pain. Moriarty himself said as much on The Crown, but Sherlock was pissing him off on purpose from the moment he showed up. He has a real knack for doing it too. God, John hopes he didn’t push the man too far.
“Riley is correct on all counts,” Greg begins calmly from where he stands, “and we were not here on a pleasure cruise. The truth of the matter is Moriarty, that man you’re pulling from the water and a woman named Sarah Sawyer brought Dr. Watson out here against his will, intending to kill him.”
“John…” Sherlock begins, but Moriarty’s face with that leering smile at the mention of John’s name flashes into his mind and suddenly he’d rather be nowhere else but at John’s side. “I’ll stay right here. Right here with you.”
“I took the liberty of examining the wound while you were making preparations,” Sherlock replies haughtily. “There are two visible shards in the skin. Possibly more.”
“What is going on?” Greg’s voice is calm, but commanding and maybe a touch apprehensive. “Tell me. Now.”
Much love, Jane
John wants him.
“Molly and I used to walk to the library in the snow after school to look at journals and magazines,” Sherlock says after the server has gone. He pops a ravioli into his mouth, his eyes sparkling. “We learned all about bearings and wheels and the tools we would need to make adjustments. Then Molly came up with shoveling driveways and using the profits to buy what we needed to be real professionals. Or, at least, what the minds children thought professionals would need. We weren’t far off though.”
“That, Mrs. Hudson, is a boldfaced lie,” Sherlock snaps, “but if you’d like to hear my objections to this farce at full volume I will be happy to accommodate.”
“Sorry. I’m sorry,” Greg says quickly, biting his lip. “I wasn’t expecting that. Who would expect that? You could’ve given me some warning.”
No spoilers, but I will say warm fuzzies.
John cocks a brow and his blue eyes begin to cloud. He opens his mouth to protest, but Sherlock cuts him off.
I promise to try and post it soon.
“Are you ready to move on?” he asks him, obviously repeating himself.
Love to all, Jane
“Yeah,” John croaks, swallowing hard. Visibly forcing his muscles to relax, he shakes away his feelings and gives Sherlock a kind of uncertain smile. “Yeah, I’m good. It was all good. Greg found me before I…”
John is in Sherlock’s condo, standing in right front of him in nothing but a pair of boxer shorts and a t-shirt. A somewhat clingy t-shirt at that. One that hugs every curve and muscle and dries Sherlock’s mouth in an instant. As he swallows hard, he notices the dark red stain of blood on the tee’s shoulder right at the top of John’s arm.
Greg to help his friends as much as he can, to do his job and get Moriarty.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock and Molly talk about John and the trip to Baltimore.
She pauses a little too long before continuing and John instantly begins to feel leery. This is not the first time she has flirted with him since they met. She takes a step closer and John wishes there was nothing at his back so he could inch away.
Thank you ALL for your love and support! It has meant more to me recently than ever before. I won't bore you with my own struggles, but having you all around has made all the difference. Thank you!
QUESTION TIME!
“I’m putting her on IR for six weeks.”
Sherlock shuffles his feet as he thinks, visualizes each play and all possible outcomes. His feet slide back and forth easily on his quads. Sherlock often dons his own workout gear and black skates for practice. He prefers to skate with the ladies rather than lord over them from the sidelines, providing critiques like most coaches. But he has always been unconventional. His unusual ideas and knowledge of the sport factored heavily into the Rock City comeback after a 23 year slump. In the 49 years since the inception of the Detroit Rock City Rollers, there had never been such a coach and there is still no other coach like him in all of the league.
“He gets his signals crossed when it comes to sentiment. He’s been burned before.”
A moment of silence follows and Sherlock feels suddenly compelled to convince John he has not lost his mind. He leans forward and grasps the hand that lies idly on the table between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
We've learned quite a lot in this chapter and learning is always good. Then there's all those fond looks and sparkling eyes. Sure he's not your date, says Angelo. Heh. Heh. But for how long? (infamous brow waggle, knowing smirk, and meaningful gesture) You all know me. Jane the Romantic! (and not evil at all heh heh)
When he returns, supplies in hand, John is not sitting on the bed. He is standing stalk still right where Sherlock left him. He stares, eyes shifting around the room slowly like they are drinking in every detail. Sherlock follows his gaze to a chest of drawers and settles on the photo of him Molly that sits upon it. He looks back at John and clears his throat.
1. Seems as though John trusts Sherlock with his past, but will he trust him with what he has found out about the mystery?
* Will their sex holiday remain full of only sex or will they be pulled into a case?
Not here to fool arou-ow-ow-ow-ound
A few minutes later, far fewer than they would have liked, the boat docks next to the police boat at the Metropark marina. When John and Sherlock emerge from below deck with Riley in the lead, the police are already interviewing witnesses from other boats. Moriarty and Moran are formally arrested and bundled into a patrol car. Two paramedics approach John for a look at his wounds as Riley removes the handcuffs from both he and Sherlock at Budreau’s orders. Apparently, Greg has given the man enough evidence to believe their story. Sherlock is the only reason the growingly irritable doctor walks to the back of the ambulance without incident. One of them begins packing off the gunshot wound, even as the other argues with John about an impending trip to the ER because stitching is not something they do on the scene.
“Greg, you can’t be serious,” John says incredulously. “Given what Molly remembers and the indications of a puncture wound on the back of her neck.”
Hope you enjoyed this chapter and the next. Also, I have been receiving notifications again, so I'm hoping the system has been restored and you're all getting them again too. Much love, Jane
3. Why should he trust Sherlock in the first place?
“Sherlock, please don’t move. Please just stay still.”
“You and the ladies are leaving tomorrow morning,” John reminds him.
John's first bout.
But seriously, my poor John. I've thrown him into certain death this time. He got away from Moran not once, but twice, but can he escape this? I won't lie, it doesn’t look good for him. And what of Sherlock’s plan? Does John being in the water toss the whole thing in the scrapheap? Wait, wait! I'm getting ahead of myself. Those were questions and I have not yet announced question time. Cart before the horse. *shakes head*
“Greg insisted,” Sherlock shrugs in reply and then his eyes soften. He tilts his head as he watches John wobble and begin to pitch over. Sherlock grabs him quickly to prevent his fall and wraps an arm around his shoulders, leaning John against the side of his body.
“On local channels. Nation-wide during the championship,” Sherlock chuckles at John’s wrinkled brow. “Don’t worry if you’ve never noticed. It’s rather eclipsed by the Stanley Cup playoffs, but it pulls in decent viewership.”
“It’s late and they will keep you in the station for hours,” Sherlock explains, making no attempt to keep the disdain from his tone. “You may as well get some sleep. Waiting to tell them in the morning won’t make much difference.”
John chuckled at his own quirkiness and somehow knew Sherlock would understand his sense of humor perfectly. Sure enough, the man’s mouth curled into a knowing smile and he cocked a brow. The expression made John think of Loki, God of Mischief himself. His chest gave into a tingling squeeze and he delighted in the pleasurable shivers rushing over his head and back.
*On my way. I’ll swing by her room*
Wrong. John was wrong. He was always wrong in a relationship. He kept himself closed off and his partner at arm’s length every time. Never letting anyone in and never actually giving himself fully to another person. Relationships can only last so long when one half isn’t all in. Claire had simply been the most persistent, but it had not worked either. She could not crack his shell. No one ever had and that was ultimately what John did not want Sherlock to know. If Sherlock saw that there was no hope of John ever loving him, if he saw that John was incapable of it, he would go. That is the truth of it. John really should not try to hide it, even in the interest of prolonging a relationship with Sherlock. It is dishonest and despicable. No better than the lies Claire tried to use to keep John. He will not be that person.
2. Will John share what he has found with Sherlock? Will he, indeed, not count him out?
John freezes on the spot, his eyes wide with shock. His jaw drops open and all trace of humor drains away.
“His intention was murder,” Sherlock says with a hint of a question in his voice.
“What? Oh, right,” John says, regaining his focus. He starts for the bed, but stops. “Sorry, I can’t do this. I’ll ruin your sheets.”
One short disclaimer: I fully admit that I'm taking certain liberties with the reality of waking from a long-term coma. I have made some aspects very realistic and others not so much. Artistic license.
The secret life of Harry Watson.
4. Will Sherlock stop him or just let him go?
“Her daughter died recently,” Sherlock said. “In the last four years and she has taken up with this man to start a new life, but can’t let go of the old one. She doesn’t love her husband anymore, but feels she would lose what little of her daughter she has left. She clearly shared physical characteristics with her father, likely the eyes and nose. Seeing them in her husband’s face brings the woman comfort.”
In the faded light you touch my body
Sherlock studies him for a moment, taken aback by the apparent flirtation. He wets his lips and glances away. He cannot be reading this correctly. John is not flirting with him. He can’t be flirting with him. He is joking. That’s what it is. He is making light of all this, of the situation.
“Good. We’ll follow you back,” Budreau faces Greg again and almost smirks, “while Mr. Lestrade here tells us about tonight’s events. Hm?”
Hahahahaha! Thank you again for all of your love and support. I'm having an amazing time and I hope all of you are too. For what it's worth, this has been the most fun I've had writing anything (and I've written a lot throughout my life). You all are fantastic!
“I am not frightened!” the detective replies furiously. He starts to move away and get out of the bed, but stops at a light touch to his arm.
“Sherlock, are you listening?” John sounds annoyed. Sherlock blinks twice in mild surprise.
“Thanks,” a smile plays at the side of his mouth and he takes the cup.
“It’s 3 o'clock in the morning!” John declares incredulously. Sherlock looks back at him and then shakes it off as irrelevant. John lunges forward to grab his arm and pulls him back. They are face to face now, their bodies close. John puts his hands on Sherlock’s hips and whispers.
“Oh, you didn’t, did you? But you’re more than willing to throw it in my face when it finally comes to a head. Fucking hypocrite.”
“You really think I should risk it?” he had asked after a moment.
YIKES, what a chapter! The blocked number, the roof, John watching from the ground..anybody fear the Reichenbach? I know you're out there.
Running out of patience and full to the brim with concern for John, who seems more and more wobbly by the minute, Sherlock opens his mouth to unleash some scathing deductions about the Budreau’s wife
I hope you all enjoyed this chapter and stick with me. Your support means so much to me and inspires me to keep writing no matter what. Thank you all. I love you. So, until next weekend...Keep your pants dry, your dreams wet and remember, hugs not drugs.
Holy shit, Jane!! Not Molly! WTF are you doing?! Weren't you just telling Pat and Franc how much you love her friendship with Sherlock? Why would you try to off her, you bitch? Yes, I know. I'm evil, pure and simple. But she's okay, friends. It'll all be fine. The real question is who did it and how? On the track? Immediately after? But I get ahead of myself. I'm skipping straight to the question portion of this end note.
I would like to draw everyone's attention to the chapter count. Yes, it is 11, and that means there's only one chapter left. AH! What will happen to our intrepid duo?? Lol. I feel in a very over-dramatic soap opera kind of mood, like I should ask leading questions about what will happen to each character. :)
3. What about Sherlock's plan? Does this play into it? Would Sherlock have expected this?
“All right,” John breathes. Without pulling his hand away, he turns slightly and sits on the edge of the bed. Swallowing hard and trying not to think about the fact that John Watson is sitting on his bed right in front of him, Sherlock reluctantly releases John’s hand and takes some gauze from the kit.
“Thanks so much for that,” he replies sarcastically.
(See the end of the chapter for
“My day off,” John replied with a slight laugh, leaning against the bar and resting his arm on its surface. “I need it. Ten days on and just as many late nights. I feel like the Duracell bunny, but on half full batteries from a Poundland Christmas sale.”
They go to work.

Thank you ALL for reading and caring. Please, please send comments if you'd like. I love reading them! They can be about the story, the weather, ideas, speculations of what might happen further on in the story, whatever. I love connecting with people and feel very connected to all of you. Just making someone happy with each chapter I post is the most awesome feeling ever. You all are my lifeline. <3
“Ah,” he gracefully side steps in front of the door to his own office. “Unaccompanied then, but I see you have spoken to Sherlock about certain...matters.”
Things happen in much the way they do for all of us.
The attraction was undeniable and yet, John “I’m not gay” Watson dismissed it. He tried to write it off as just being very intrigued with this most unusual person, who is brilliant and funny and fucking gorgeous. A man who positively HAS to be delicious when tasted and has ridiculous cheekbones. A man John killed to protect only hours after meeting him. Nope, nope, not attraction. Just intrigue.
Now, a little house-keeping. I'd like to draw your attention to the number of chapters again. It hasn't changed, but I think it just might before this is all over. It's likely to become eleven or twelve chapters. I'll keep you updated. I'm not sure if this will continue to happen in subsequent parts or not. We'll all see together. If nothing else, it just gives you more chapters to love. :)
“You usually leave with Greg,” it was not a question, but John’s voice rose with it as though it was. His Machiavellian expression made sure Sherlock understood his meaning, the underlying question in John’s uttered statement. The man was completely unphased by John’s directness, smiling and huffing a quiet laugh as he threw a handful of pretzels in his mouth.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth quirks up. John watches him, trying not to look nervous and probably failing miserably, judging by Sherlock’s expression. There is nothing John would like more than to change the subject and brush this off as he has done so many times in the past. He has run full-steam in the opposite direction, but Sherlock is so different. John is different too and he just doesn’t understand what any of it means. He has been allowed into this man’s life and knows what a gift it is, he treasures it with everything he has. Sherlock makes John feel  calm and free, whereas he has felt undeniably trapped with every other person he has dated.
“I know exactly at what,” he says in a low and dangerous voice. “What the hell are you doing?”
“Good. We’ll be off then. Best, Dr. Watson,” Budreau acknowledges John as he turns to leave. The doctor replies with a ta and the sergeant begins to walk away, but stops suddenly and looks back at them. “Take the championship. The Rockets are looking to kick you off the throne.”
“I’ll have to look for that this year,” John smiles.
Wise men say only fools rush in
“Will do,” she promises and adds with a wink. “I’ll see to Harry personally.”
Responses are in and darkness has not been discouraged, so we are all about to take a trip down the rabbit hole. I'd explain, but I think you all know what I mean. I just want to say please no one lose heart. The scale will tip upward again. Every story has highs and lows - it's what makes them worth reading and what makes the characters worth caring about. And MY characters are worth caring about. (An uppity assertion, I know, but I love these guys. Please accept apologies for my conceit.)
Keep your pants dry, your dreams wet, and remember, hugs not drugs.
“No,” John breathed. He shook his head slightly, staring at Sherlock agog. His mouth hung open a moment longer before stretching into a smile. “That was...amazing.”
Sherlock’s mouth opens, but no words come out and he ends up staring at John like a lovelorn fool.
Sherlock meets John’s earnest gaze with one of his own. His voice is quiet and deadly serious.
“Ah, I see,” John says fondly. “You get attached to people, don’t you?
“Well, we could talk now,” Sherlock suggests, the smile evident in his voice and John finally turns to look at him, still expecting to be mocked somehow. Sherlock does look amused, but John should have known better than to think Sherlock would ridicule him.
Sherlock feels like he is floating. He lets out a long, smooth sigh and then opens his eyes to find John staring back with an unreadable look on his face. The doctor blows out a quiet breath, his eyes searching Sherlock’s. His body is full to the brim with tension.
Now, the chapter summary.
He lets his voice trail off and when he turns back to John again, the smaller man is very close, right up in his business close. Sherlock’s stance falters, but he holds his ground. John is staring up at him intensely. He squares his shoulders and looks every bit the military captain he was before being wounded.
Yes, Jane of Cakes is back with another work and I really hope you all like it. It's my first AU and I'm nervous as hell to put it out there. I just keep hoping it isn't complete rubbish. As the quick description says, our boys are in the roller derby racket for this one. It is born out of my joining the local roller derby team in 2018. I love it. Unfortunately, my flipping back decided it was time to die and I had to stop skating, but not before giving myself a derby name. Say hello to Pepto Dismal. Hahahahaha!! I may not be able to skate, but I still keep score at bouts, which I love almost as much.
And I wanted to remind you of a few terms so the action makes more sense.
“Oh, going in,” Sherlock clears his throat. “Poe is a favorite author of mine.”
“Did you help him with a case?” John blurted with ardor.
“Their pattern of frequency and the days on which their meetings occur suggest visits to the city for business and he is clearly not a colleague,” Sherlock added.
Sherlock cannot stop a quiet huff of mirth and he pats her shoulder in thanks as he rises.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock and John tell Greg what's been going on.
“Okay,” Sherlock heads for the en suite again and tosses a look over his shoulder. “Be right back.”
Much love.
“Blood,” Sherlock blurts suddenly.
“Skated? You skated even back then?”
“Your thoughts. You were in your mind palace, yeah?”
Sherlock looks at him thoughtfully for a moment, considering his words carefully. John can practically hear the cogs turning. The light in the man’s eyes changes with his decision and even sparkles with intrigue just a little. The prospect of a new puzzle to work out, perhaps?
“Damn you, Jane! Why didn’t John tell Sherlock he loves him?! He figured it out, didn’t he? WTF’s the holdup?” Heh heh heh. What indeed.
There is a bit of forced contact in this chapter, but it is restricted to kissing and palming.
And smut.
Budreau is frozen to the spot, his brows raised in keen interest. He glances toward Moriarty who just sighs, rolls his eyes and looks away in disgust. Intrigued, the sergeant turns and approaches Greg while Riley cuffs Sherlock’s hands behind his back, leaving John to sway to and fro. Fortunately, the officer is no idiot and he helps John to the side of the boat where he can lean against something. Riley looks at the doctor apologetically as he handcuffs his battered wrists in front of his body, knowing it will be more painful if they are behind his back. Riley glances at Sherlock, who gives him a slight nod of thanks.
Sorry for the super serious notes when mine are usually somewhat humorous, but I just can't see making jokes just now. This is certainly a downturn in the story, but things will look up again. Highs and lows, up and downs...Persistence.
“Oh, Sherlock, that hurts. It really does.” He presses the knife closer and leers. “Does John ever whisper that in the dark? Because I’m gonna make him say it.”
Anyway, this is all stuff I should say at the end of the chapter. I’m getting ahead of myself, so I will stop and let you enjoy this last chapter.
We shall soon see.
Love to you all, Jane
“I have no doubt that Bill treasured your friendship and never had any expectation that you would serve together. He left his things to you as a remembrance of what you shared, not to make you feel guilty or that you’d failed him. You haven’t, John.”
“I rather thought Mrs. Hudson already covered that,” he replies with some bitterness.
Greg and Molly do the same.
“Are you all right?” he asks quietly. “You’re breathing fast. Is it the pain?”
“What did you study?”
“I can’t,” John’s voice was dull, but his face was full of surprise. “I have a boyfriend.”
Sorry, friends. No spoilers this time.
“And your point is?”
“I’ve had the odd relationship over the years, but have never been anywhere close to marriage,” John says, distracting Sherlock from his escape plans. Strangely, John appears to be completely at ease again as though Sherlock hadn’t said anything so idiotic at all and the coach is thankful for it. “Didn’t even bother dating in California, which worked out since I didn’t stay long. But now…”
But everything about you is tellin’ me this time
“Do you want to talk…”
more concerned about…”
“Sherlock!” Greg rises from his chair and glares at the taller man. He is not at all surprised at the insubordination, nor is Mrs. Hudson - Sherlock Holmes has spoken his mind since day one - but he is typically more diplomatic with the team’s owner.
“Yes, we bloody well do.”
“Stay where you are!” the policeman trains his gun on the coach, not knowing who is the perpetrator and who is the victim. “Both of you raise your hands slowly and stay right where you are.”
“I know it’s ridiculous.”
Ack! Jane, you're such a tease! Or should I say bitch? How many times? How close did they come to it? And that part when Sherlock thinks "I should just kiss him. It would be so easy right now and I really, REALLY want to".
Sherlock turns to face him, taking John’s hand in both of his and pulling it to his chest to give the already exhausted muscles relief. Sherlock lifts a leg and sits half on the edge of the bed, looking into John’s stormy eyes. He can see the fear still there, warring with the mind that tells him Rosie is safe and the danger is gone.
When everybody keeps retreating, but you can’t seem to get enough
Just after midnight, Sherlock wakes with a start from another nightmare. He has awoke this way every night since returning to 221B two months ago. He and John have shared his bed every night since that first one, which has made things difficult. Sherlock has gone out of his way to keep his nightmares from John and it has worked for the most part, but the detective is certain it will not last much longer. John isn't stupid and he'll soon realize that Sherlock's night terrors happen more often than he believes. Sherlock has to come up with something to tell John without lying, or telling the truth. God, what has happened to him?! Has falling in love so deeply and so completely laid waste to all of his mental abilities in a mere matter of weeks? And, if so, what can he do to combat it? Sherlock knows full well that trying to go backwards and just be friends again will not change his feelings for John. Or John’s feelings for him. They will still be drawn to one another. Laying flat on his back, Sherlock sighs up at the ceiling. Caring is not an advantage.
flirting with John Watson. He is absolutely
“Because when I take him…I want you to watch.”
“And a bloody awful one from the sound of it.”
Until we meet again... Stay safe. Stay healthy Do what you can to keep your mind and heart happy.
Sherlock visibly jumps at the thought, startled by his raw desire for John. He jerks his hand away without meaning to and the doctor’s smile is gone when he looks at him.
And we're back....
By the time Sherlock finished, they were well into another song. It was the third in a string of songs that couples could use to their advantage, which meant there would be one more and then faster songs would rule again. John and Sherlock would have to part and dance further apart again. It was the last thing John wanted.
Pack - the largest group of blockers from both teams skating within ten feet of each other.
It’s a low blow and John knows it. Sherlock hasn’t used in over a year. He bristles and glares down at John.
John swallows. Sherlock does not break eye contact or miss a beat.
Sherlock is perched on the edge of his seat now. His fingers are nearly touching John’s thigh where he grips the bedclothes tightly. He watches the doctor carefully as John squints and screws up his face in concentration. After a moment, John lets his features relax and looks at Sherlock almost sadly.
“It’ll be fine, Sherlock. We’ll be fine,” John tells him and Sherlock looks at him thoughtfully.
And what about Sally's "Yeah, I like him too much" line? WHA??? So much more is going on around Greg than even he knows!
Once the film was over, Sherlock knew he would never willingly part with it. He felt a certain kinship with the Grinch. Badly hurt in his past, unwilling to let it happen again, shutting out people and feelings, a single friend by his side. He has not mentioned how easily he can put himself in those shoes because Molly would just feel sorry for him, no doubt. She would also not appreciate being equated to Max, the dog and would staunchly disagree. She sees a side of him that no one else does. If they had not grown up together, he probably would have shut her out too. The changes in Victor and their divorce had hurt him so deeply, he did not think he would allow anyone but Molly into his life again. Then he met John and, just like with Cindy Lou Who, everything changed. He supposes John would also not appreciate the comparison.
I hope you all enjoyed that. I certainly enjoyed adding in the comments that are supposed to be all of you asking me questions in return. :D I hope you all enjoyed the chapter and keep on coming back for the rest. I love you all and thank you for you support from the bottom of my heart. You help make my soul happy.
* WHY DO YOU LIKE TO TORTURE US, JANE? WHY?!?!?! GAAAHHHHHAAAARRRG!
“Please,” Sherlock replies with a dazzling smile and his own stately bow.
A couple of logistical notes. I have marked this Part as being 9 chapters. The truth of it is that, as I have been editing, everything I have written from here on in claims to be one huge chapter. Needles to say, that is not the case. I don't what I was thinking while in my creative process or where the chapter divisions went. In any case, I will be splitting them into shorter chapters. I guessed on the number as 9, so it could turn out to be more or less. I'll keep you informed.
Love, Jane
Much love, Jane
“You did all this when you were seven and eight?” John asks in disbelief.
Sherlock comes to a conclusion.
“Shit,” John mutters, glancing around the restaurant. “There’s no one here. What time is it?”
“Sherlock is really a girl’s name.”
I’ve been told that people aren’t receiving a notification that this chapter is up. I don’t know why that would happen, but I’m trying to repost it.
“I want to stay with you,” Sherlock continues in a calmer voice.
Once again, no spoilers.
“If Lestrade had anything useful, he’d have told us. No, I need to contact my network. See what they’ve found.” He moves toward the edge of the bed and reaches for his dressing gown. John watches him with a look of shock.
Knowing he isn’t going to fall asleep again anytime soon, Sherlock gently kisses John’s forehead and quietly gets out of bed. He pads out of the room and down the hall, stopping only when he reaches his desk. Sitting down, he begins going over various documents, on paper and on his laptop, in an effort to find Moriarty’s safe houses and hired hands. He has evidence of several crimes, both already committed and still to come, that he must discuss with Lestrade in the morning.
Sherlock closes his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose, his fingers resting precisely on the two little wrinkles that traverse the top of his nose when he furrows his brow. He sighs in both frustration and anger.
Sherlock jolts backwards and plants his hand on a nearby dresser to keep himself steady. His breaths are coming rapidly and he holds a palm to his chest. His distress clear, John lurches forward to help, putting a hand on his arm.
Sorry. I really want to get the chapters out faster, but I'm editing. I need to sit down and have a mad editing night!
“The diner awaits,” the man replies with a kind smile.
Love, Jane
“I just thought...if you were ever looking for baby names.”
“But murder?”
Why do you hurt me this way?
Sherlock pauses to sip from his wine glass. John is looking at him with rapt attention like he is the most interesting person on the planet. Sherlock tries not to dwell on this and also tries desperately to ignore the flip in his belly.
“One for every year they’ve been together.”
“Trolls,” Sherlock wrinkles his nose.
Ug. Such a beautiful disaster.
Before I get started taunting you all, I want to thank my always wonderful beta, MyBreadAndButter. She is The Best and always ups my game. I have been scared shitless to release the last two chapters, but I'm feeling good about this one. I think I'm finally getting the hang of having someone else's input. Haha. It's been a learning process in many ways and I'm glad MyBAB convinced me to give it a try.
“You,” John pauses, his mind processing all Sherlock just said. He takes a step forward with a playful and mischievous smirk, “can’t always deduce me? Like you do everyone else?”
“My god, I can’t believe this. This...this is amazing,” John mumbles and wets his lips. “Is this a dream?”
“There’s no one here!” Sherlock’s voice raises in irritation. “Jesus, John.”
“It’s the tan, right?”
“When he entered his home Wednesday evening, John was attacked,” Sherlock explains, sounding significantly more calm than he had the rest of the meeting. “He managed to escape..”
And, above all, poor John. :(
Happy reading. I promise I'll be back to my old self next time.
“No,” Greg cut him off. The two men looked at each other, brows furrowed in mutual understanding. The muscles in John’s jaw flexed as he gnashed his teeth. Greg sighed next to him and John broke eye contact only to look over the floor again in another unsuccessful attempt to find the man he sought while trying with all his might to ignore everything unsaid between them.
“So.”
“Afternoon, Eileen.”
“And your leg.”
John knew it was defensive and unnecessary. Greg would never in a million years judge him, but to have this happen time and time again hurt. Greg’s words always stung, even though he meant them in the most supportive way possible. John knew he should take them to heart and he did, just not enough to do anything about it. It was true his relationship was far from perfect, but in all honesty, he really did not give a toss. It was what it was and it was easy to ignore what he did not like.
“I didn’t think it necessary,” Sherlock bites out.
“Someone tried to poison him to get him to leave and now as soon as you have another competent doctor, someone tries to kill him? No,” John shakes his head. “It’s too damn coincidental.”
“God, Sherlock.”
I'm sure there are plenty of questions, but I'm only going for three.
“She says he trusts me,” John gives a half laugh and turns his head away from the older man. He can feel an unexpected low burning anger in his gut, though it is not directed toward Billy. He continues, suspicious and spiteful. “I suppose I should believe her since they’re thick as thieves. There’s something going on between them.”
“I know,” Sherlock replied steadily, not backing down.
“What?!” Greg’s jaw drops. He doesn’t know what to say. He has absolutely no idea. John has not been with the organization long and is not acquainted with all… Forget it. They don’t have enemies, save the Demons, and they are just rivals, really. And murder? No, no, no. It can’t be something from John’s past. He is squeaky clean, perhaps the most likable person on the planet, which really just leaves one thought in Greg’s mind. “What the fuck is going on?”
“I’m going to the hospital,” he informs the cheerful team in a loud voice.
“In London?”
Will there ever be a right moment?
5) For the love of god, is John ever going to realize he's in love with Sherlock or am I just stringing you all along? 😈
“Oh, come on,” Greg barks as he stands to his full height. “How long have we worked together? Too long for this bullshit.”
Jim is a heartless bastard.
“They poisoned her, Greg,” Sherlock mutters in a low voice, fury bubbling beneath.
There was no question in John’s mind that what was happening to him was the same for Sherlock.
“Sherlock. Sherlock, wake up.” John pushes at his shoulders insistently, blocking Sherlock’s fist efficiently when he takes a swing at him. “Sherlock, what the hell are you doing?!”
The duo snuggle after the danger has passed.
You know that I want to be with you all the time
Jammer - the skater who skates around the track and aims to pass all of the blockers on the opposite team. A point is scored for each opposing team blocker the jammer passes.
with Sherlock. He
“Well, I don’t have a death wish now, do I?” John raises a knowing brow.
His eyes slip closed as he carefully analyzes each strategy against each jammer. His hands steepled with fingertips just touching his lips, every sound filling the stadium fading away as he enters his mind palace. This is the place where all the information is stored and every skill will match up with his ideas.
Sherlock eases back into his seat, listening as the ladies crack jokes and bolster one another. A small smile of pride tugs at his lips. Despite the accidents and obstacles, the ladies are a team above all else. They band together on and off the track like a family. The smile grows as Sherlock’s words from their first bout emerge from a corner of his mind palace; the ladies never cease to amaze him.
