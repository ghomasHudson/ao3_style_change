John shifts in his seat and hisses slightly when he fully realizes the pain in his body: his right temple, his left eye, his bottom lip, and now his right calf. The noise shocks Sherlock out of whatever self-indulgent trance he was in and he rises to his feet suddenly.
“Yes?” he answers cautiously, looking and sounding like he expects this to be a trap.
“No,” Holmes says in a petulant voice as he crosses his arms and sinks further in to the couch in a very definite pout.
? After all that, John thinks she’s crazy enough to do it again? Only a maniac would come back for more.”
Holmes nods, “I had just gotten you back and already you were kidnapped.”
“Not even during this debacle? There was never a shred of doubt, a nagging voice saying that I was a fraud?”
It’s not so much PTSD anymore - sounds are fine, smells are fine, pictures are fine – but more about missing the uncertainty, feeling so
you regret it?” Sherlock asks honestly, unable to hide the fear in his eyes.
“Where is John?” He asks as he calculates where his own weapons are. He might be able to reach the knife on the mantle, but he has no gun since John moved out.
“Yes, I had a great time, didn’t you?” He asks with genuine glee.
,” Holmes attempts to backtrack, but the looks of triumph and determination are already in Watson’s eyes.
Watson reaches the remote and pauses the DVD as John is hugging Sherlock.
“But there were other people in the videos, sometimes.”
John sits in his chair, hardly breathing as he reads the sentence over again for what may actually be the millionth time.
“Well, I had no idea what had been happening since you ran off and left me, I just knew I couldn’t let you take that pill.”
There’s a nagging feeling at the back of John’s mind as he thinks about how long it’s been since he’s shared a bed with anyone. He knows sleeping patterns and habits are prone to change with age and partner, so “No,” he admits quietly to his best friend, he is not willing to bet on it.
“Let them,” John replied, as the soft voice of the singer began to croon.
“I’ll cope,” he insists.
He sits on the edge of the bed heavily, and lowers his chin to his chest. It’s a natural move to hide his tears, but there’s no one there to see them anyway. It had been bad enough thinking that he wouldn’t see Sherlock for six months, but he would come back. In his head, that was the plan he held on to to hold himself together. But to learn that he wouldn’t come back from the mission and chose to come to his own end instead…where had they gone so wrong? When had John failed him so incredibly badly?
Next a woman and her son approach the trio and the little boy immediately runs to hug Sherlock, who awkwardly accepts it and pats him on the head. Flashback to Sherlock talking to Archie in 221B about his duties as ring-bearer before showing him photos of murders.
if John hadn’t been so different from the rest of the children he had ever met.
“That’s not a real thing.”
“Tell me what is troubling you,” he requested softly, showing only genuine concern for me.
“Myself,” Sherlock repeated, before waving his hand, “I’ve told you. It doesn’t work.”
“I love you, John,” Sherlock said in a barely-there whisper, his eyes locking onto John as he spoke, a pretty blush covering his cheeks and nose.
A quick scene of Irene caressing a newspaper photo of Sherlock. Mrs. “Not Your Housekeeper” Hudson cleaning up the kitchen and fridge. A stranger coming in to the flat and collapsing, then Mrs. Hudson yelling for them.
Holmes scoffs in derision, “No thank you; I rather enjoyed just staying in and doing a Bond marathon.”
and he can’t help but laugh. Suddenly somehow, incomprehensible to Holmes and Watson, they are okay again.
Holmes makes a horrified face of disgust, “No! But I do prefer my doctors clean-shaven.”
“You want this?” John asked, obviously confused and affected by their closeness. His cock had stirred even though it was unable to get hard again after his recent orgasm, but it didn’t matter as he rolled his hips and looked up at Sherlock lovingly, “Want
If he had known that, he would have paid a younger student to test the potion, as he usually does, instead of drinking it himself. But the truth is that he’s never been in love - isn’t even certain what it’s supposed to
"I'm about to be trapped in an electricity-free flat with a bored Sherlock Holmes; have you
Mary’s focus transfers from Sherlock to John, though her gun stays trained steadily on the former. Sherlock longs to jump up and steal the gun from her hand, but he knows she would shoot him before he had the chance, so he instead waits for the right moment.
“If I can help ease your mind, I certainly will,” he assured me with great honesty.
you...I mean,
He sits on the floor - legs unable to support the weight of discovery, but himself unwilling to place himself so close to the man whose hand wrote these sentences. He knows it’s a vast breach of etiquette and trust, but he cannot stop himself from reading on.
After the pool incident where Moriarty strapped you to a bomb and you offered to die with me, it was
John smiled shyly and then closed his eyes as his thumb rubbed against his slit, smearing the precome across his tip. He bucked his hips and moaned, biting down on his lip.
“You’ll need to carry me. I can’t
John has to think about this statement for a humiliatingly impressive length of time before his Doctor Brain can take control back over from the Sea of Scotch, “You mean wet dreams.”
John groans and closes his eyes as his chin falls to his chest. He had begged Sherlock to stop experimenting on himself and first years - to ask Professor Northup for help on how to get them tested legally - but he just won’t listen to reason. His way is faster, and with how quickly Sherlock can move from one idea to the next, he needs to have them tested as soon as possible. One of these days Sherlock is going to invent a potion that is life-altering, and John doesn’t want to see it never be realized simply because Sherlock got bored by waiting around for the testing phase to be done properly.
“I…” Holmes starts, not wanting to admit it.
John huffs out a quiet laugh and shakes his head in bemusement, “I mean sex and kissing and having consideration for my feelings and talking about things and give and take,” he elaborates almost as a challenge, holding Sherlock’s gaze as he assesses his reaction to the words.
Back to Sherlock and John in the cab where John is giving him advice, which Sherlock appears to be ignoring.
“But the younger version of the client?”
“Yes, it was very enlightening,” Sherlock nodded, “I certainly learned more with you than I did with Lestrade.”
you what your habits are; I already know
John has always trusted Sherlock when it came to danger and tea and even toxic experiments, but to trust him with his heart is something he’s not certain either of them can handle. He has watched Sherlock propose marriage before simply to break in to an office building, for crying out loud! So what is supposed to make him think that this isn’t just some ploy for Sherlock not to have to waste time taking John away from dates to go on a case anymore?
“They who?” Watson scoffs with a smile, “The scientists inside your Mind Palace who justify your smoking habit?”
“I think about your cheekbones and The Woman’s words echo in my mind, about how she could cut herself on them,” he continues while reverently tracing them with his thumbs, “I long to try.”
“Small mercies,” Holmes agrees with a smile.
“Oh please, don’t try to pretend that you understand the first thing about my scale.”
“Right…” John cleared his throat, “So…what do you need to know?”
John shrugged, “Business partner,” then moved his mouth back to Sherlock’s ear and added on a whisper, “life partner,” before moving down to his neck and whispering, “sex partner,” before lavishing a big, wet kiss to the side.
As Sherlock's speech comes to a close, something clicks in his brain as important, but he can’t quite place what it is. What transpires is a lot of back and forth for Sherlock between being present in the room and retreating in to his Mind Palace to be able to think. He knows someone will die – narrows down that it will assuredly be Sholto. Sherlock attempts to distract the crowd yet further as he continues to try to figure out who the murderer is, but it’s not until young Archie connects The Bloody Guardsman to the Mayfly Man that it all comes together.
When they arrive home the evening that the case finishes, Sherlock doesn’t even need to mention that John should come to his room once he’s changed; sleeping after a case - especially a long one such as this - is a given even outside of this experiment that he has no idea how to end. The truth of the matter is that Sherlock didn’t outline too many parameters of the study because he wasn’t certain what he was looking for. It was mostly just how they reacted to each other’s presence, so it’s difficult to decide when it’s done. Especially because he doesn’t want to go back to sleeping without John by his side.
Lestrade had laughed, taking a step back and holding up his hands before gesturing that it was for John to explain. John knew that he'd owe Greg a slap for this one as he moved closer to Sherlock, speaking low as he cleared his throat, “He's er...well, he's wanking, Sherlock.”
And before John knew what was coming, Sherlock’s mouth was crashing onto his own with Sherlock’s enthusiasm to reach him.
) at the view of John in tiny, cupping white Y-fronts.
Once he's gotten the fire going, he stands while rubbing his hands together to get the dirt and traces of wood off of them. He turns to Sherlock, "Come sit by the fire," he says before moving their chairs closer to the hearth.
He was smiling at me in his affectionate way that only I have ever seen.
Sherlock arrives back in the living room just a few minutes before John discovers him there, pacing.
Sherlock takes a deep breath as he turns back to John and announces loudly, to the entire restaurant, “I am in love with this man,” he gestures vaguely to the incredibly shocked John Watson before him, “The truth is I have been for a long time and I refuse to hide it anymore.”
Sherlock seemed to freeze, eyes staring at a spot above the head of another attendee who turned to look at whatever it was that Sherlock was looking at. It was a little bit spooky, in all honesty, watching Sherlock go completely offline. After a few seconds, Sherlock gave a sharp inhale and cleared his throat, lifting his fork shakily to pick at the chocolate cake in front of him.
“Let’s start at the top, shall we?”
“I thought that was fairly obvious,” Sherlock replies calmly.
John is drawn to it like a moth to a flame. How a freckle can look enticing and elegant, he’s never really been certain. But that new freckle just seems to increase the sensuality of the hand it adorns. Sometimes, when John realizes how attractive he finds the small marks all over his lover’s body, he wonders if there’s something wrong with him.
“Oh yeah, that guy!” Watson says, remembering that he was the one who had killed West.
Greg walks Sherlock and John through the back of a theatre, warning about the press outside. Before leaving the building, Sherlock pulls on a deerstalker and hands John a flat cap.
“Oh,” Sherlock breathes out in relief, “Goodnight, then, John.”
“Got it!” Sherlock says triumphantly as he sits back down and hands John his wallet.
John took Sherlock’s hand and pressed a kiss to the palm before beginning a walk to the bedroom, leading Sherlock behind him. There was a moment of hesitation before Sherlock cleared his throat and let go of John’s hand. Turning around sharply, John expected to find Sherlock saying he had changed his mind or he wasn’t ready, but what he found was a lanky detective bent in half, naked from the waist down and showing off his perfect arse and winking arsehole to the doctor.
insisted,” he said pointing at his mother, “Although I should have known; cross dressing runs in her family.”
The client – Henry – is standing, stunned, in the hollow where his father died. The opening credits begin.
Holmes shrugs, fighting a blush as he admits, “You like it,” before turning back to the telly.
“Honestly, Mrs. Hudson, it’s merely your face,” Holmes admonishes.
It starts innocently enough. Sherlock and John are working a case in Scotland and have to spend the night at a local Inn. It’s nothing that hasn’t happened on previous cases, but it is admittedly rare and they have always been able to get two rooms, or at the very least a room with two beds. This time? No such luck - the tiny Inn only has ten rooms and all but one are already taken.
"Precisely," he nods seriously before standing.
Flashes of newspaper covers about “Shag-a-lot Holmes” “7 Times a Night in Baker Street” “He Made me Wear the Hat”. Janine has been exploiting their relationship by telling the tabloids that they shagged like bunnies. It comes out that they never even got close to that ever happening. Sherlock turns his morphine tap back down when he realizes that Mary is near, not able to trust his mind to drugs around her. In his Mind Palace, he attempts to figure her out.
Sherlock quickly takes stock of their positioning: bodies pressed flush against each other - including their hard cocks connected through flimsy pajama bottoms - with Sherlock’s left hand grasping John’s hip while John’s right hand rests on his cheek. He realizes that he feels just as desperate for this man as he did in his dream, and judging by John’s pupils blown wide and his body practically thrumming against his, he wants this, too.
“He’s never experienced an orgasm?” is the fact that John latched onto, head rising from his hand in shock, “But...how is that even possible?”
“No.”
Sherlock pulled back, stepping to one side and gesturing to John, “Mummy, this is John Watson.”
John comes in to Sherlock’s room to find the other man already on his side of the bed, the camera set up facing them.
After a few minutes, when the anger has finally drained from him allowing room for remorse to take over once more, he stands. He walks over to the tea that Mrs. Hudson had brought up with the post and pours himself a cup, sipping it slowly as he stands and futilely attempts to ignore the ache in his chest.
“You were...” John smiled, grinning at Sherlock.
“Sherlock, you mean,” Holmes corrects.
When they near the door, John sees Angelo standing there, beaming at them.
“Right. No. None of that,” John warned, crossing his legs and putting his paper aside, “with strangers, I mean. If you...want to do that then I’ll help. Only until you know what you’re doing.”
Without fully thinking it through, John scoots higher up on the bed with his pillow, making Sherlock’s head fall just about at shoulder height. He then closes the minimal space that separates their bodies and gently (as gently as he can manage when the scenario calls for him to place his still slightly-aching arm under the other man’s head) settles Sherlock on top of his left side.
Sherlock subconsciously shifts himself yet closer and in to a comfortable position - his head more on John’s pectoral than his shoulder, his left hand near his heart, and his legs entwined with John’s. He lets out another, larger, contented sigh and all is quiet. Not even a hint at a snore.
“We don’t have to go further if you’re not comfortable,” John soothes, his finger doing another sweep of Sherlock’s cheekbones, “Plus, it’s not going to be attractive when I shrivel up because of the cold. I don’t want your first experience of seeing a living person naked to be my micropenis caused by sub-zero temperatures.”
“Yes,” Holmes says, fighting a smirk.
Sherlock reaches in to the pocket of his coat as he falls to one knee, his nervous eyes meeting John’s frightened ones. He pulls out a ring from the pocket, “John Watson, will you marry me?”
Follow me on
In that one moment, my dreams that never even had the chance to become reality were crushed, never to be realized. The dream, above all, that I could hold you and call you mine.
“Are you honestly keeping track of how many people think Sherlock and John are in a relationship?”
he admonishes himself. He can will himself to sleep, he
“All John Watsons love their Sherlock Holmes,” he says with conviction, as though there is not a single doubt.
“Sherlock?” John asked quietly, not wanting to get his hopes up; he had learned from a life full of disappointments how much false hope can hurt.
Watson’s face falls in to a stern look of determination. His captain face, “We can’t mess up their timeline with the revelation that they can be together; it’s what’s
“John?” Sherlock asks in true confusion. Surely he’s not asking him to…
“Maybe Moriarty couldn’t get cameras in the church,” Watson offers distractedly, entranced by John and Mary. His Mary’s dress had been the same one, but his tux was different.
, anyway; I imagine I’ll be able to get by just fine based on your moans and reactions of your body,” he said before dropping his mouth to the dip of his hip, so close to John’s cock and yet not nearly close enough, and whispering, “let your body guide me. Let me hear you,” he practically begged.
John wakes up some time later on his right side and feeling overly warm. It takes him a second to realize the reason is Sherlock’s hand on his neck, keeping his body heat from escaping from the prominent pulse point. He grunts in aggravation as he shakes his upper body to dislodge the scalding hand. When that doesn’t help, he physically removes it and carelessly redirects it towards the other man’s own body. As he waits to cool enough to fall back asleep, he hears Sherlock make a small noise of discontent before he feels the hand resume its position on his neck.
“It was the most efficient way to get the cops there without wasting our time on the phone,” Holmes shrugs with a smile.
love you.”
“Will you still pull the door shut with the knocker so it sits askew?”
“It is,” Sherlock promised, “so take me to bed.”
He addresses and stamps the envelope before walking to the corner of the street and dropping it in the postbox.
Mind Palace John removes his hands from his pockets as he steps smoothly toward Sherlock’s chair, walking around it in a slow circle, “Come on,” he chides in good humor, “you love when I compliment you, and I love to do it. There’s no harm.”
Holmes muses to himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
And it’s true. Watson hadn’t dated anyone before Mary since they met her on one of their first cases together and…well…he has yet to appear to express interest in anyone else since her passing nearly three years ago.
He knows that he cannot keep laying here and watching John, dealing with his own depressing thoughts on the matter, so he carefully stands from the bed and makes his way to the living room. He takes a quick trip in to the loo before grabbing his violin and returning to the bedroom. He may not be able to sleep with John tonight, but he can use the failure to test out a new experiment idea anyway.
It didn’t work.
“Oh God, yes,” Watson says, “Let’s quench the curiosity and be done with it.”
just recently break out of hospital against doctor’s orders after being shot in the chest. So probably not.”
Watson studies his friend’s concerned face. He really can be rather sweet in his regards when he wants to be. He debates lying to Holmes, but knows it would never work, “I was thinking about what it would have been like to have Mary around for longer after you…left.”
Moriarty came back and I tried desperately to keep you safe. I left you. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done and I never should have followed through with it. I don’t know how else I was supposed to manage it, but seeing the look on your face when I returned told me everything.
Thank you so much for all the support you have given us via kudos, comments and subs. It really means a lot to us.
Sherlock nodded, conceding that the thought had merit. When his hand wrapped around his cock, he hissed and his hips bucked upwards, “Oh…” he moaned quietly in wonderment.
Lestrade closes his eyes (he’s always done better dealing with Sherlock if he can’t see his manipulative face) and shakes his head, “Alright,” he concedes, eyes opening again and grabbing a stack of files from his desk, offering them out, “These are the cases we have right now. You can take a look and see if there’s anything you can help with, but I swear there’s nothing here worth your time, bored or no.”
You enter and place a duffle at your feet sheepishly, looking uncertain.
“And you have done quite well for yourself now, my love,” Mrs. Holmes soothed, “Consulting Detective, on the telly and in the papers.”
“Yes, his eyes are a bit more obviously laced with mania.”
I regret how obvious it is that The Blind Banker is my least favorite episode. I skimped a bit on this one, and for that I apologize. They definitely become more detailed after this one, I promise.
was that last bit?” Watson demands, turning to his friend on the couch.
“You really pretended to be a security guard to get a look at the painting?” Watson asks.
Watson fights a smile with a knowing glint in his eyes, “But you
“Do not move,” Larry tells Sherlock.
Mycroft ordered me on a case to Munich (dignitary drama or some such rubbish, I don’t even care to remember) and demanded that I fly there. I detest flying. What with the terminal gates, an excess of people, the high risk of contracting an airborne illness, and the potential for nearly a hundred things to go wrong, some would label it as a fear of flying. Okay, they’d be right: I have flight anxiety. But the case was time sensitive and they could not wait for me to take a train there instead.
“Sherlock?” John asks, concerned, “Shit, did I go too far?”
John sighs heavily in frustration at not being allowed to return to sleep when this man - this incredibly warm, comforting man still in his arms - denied him rest for so long last night before answering, “It was the only way to shut you up.”
“You’ve already passed her along to the father, so I bet she’ll be just fine,” he says sarcastically, not believing that her ex, David, would really want to be solely responsible for the little life he helped create behind John’s back.
John ducks his head as he allows himself to succumb to emotion, but quickly pulls himself back in to his straight soldier stance, nods his head in salute, and walks off.
off of rejoining
They watch as the “episode” comes to a close, Moriarty being hinted as being behind the entire thing, which they of course already knew.
, was to hold on to and comfort each other.”
In the morning, John is woken not by a sound, but the feeling of Sherlock moving slightly in his arms. The rational part of John’s brain that should be nervous to face Sherlock post-nocturnal-cuddle is still too tired to give a damn, so instead he makes a noise (a grunt, really) of discontent and pulls Sherlock tighter against him to stop his wiggling about.
“Yes, valid point,” John started haughtily, “but I never thought I’d have to explain wanking to a grown man! They didn’t exactly cover
“Did Sherlock just call her ‘Hudders’?” Watson laughs.
“John!” He yells, closing the short distance to him, eyes never leaving the growing blood stain on the denim, “Are you alright?”
Sherlock looks away from John and shakes his head, denying him an answer as he drains the rest of his glass.
Back at 221B, Sherlock’s phone receives another text. John looks at it for him, his face falling as he sees who it’s from: Moriarty. John, just as Watson had been, is none too thrilled by the idea of the mad man making his next moves with Sherlock. And why would he? He ended up strapped to a bomb volunteering to die with his best friend last time the man came around.
“I want you to get hard for me,” Sherlock continued quietly in his low timbre, breath falling hot against John’s left ear with his mouth so close, “Please, John,” he begged, “will you do that for me?”
“They’ve already caused enough change here,” Mycroft continues, as though they don’t realize the full implications of keeping them. As if they actually plan to do so.
Holmes knows, with a drop of his stomach, that he’s trying to make his disappearance easier on John. When he fakes his death – as he’s certain Sherlock will do, same as he did – and disappears without a word, he thinks it’ll be easier for John if he believes the lies. He only wants John not to hurt. But Holmes can’t voice this answer, so he doesn’t voice one at all.
“I’m sorry, did Sherlock just make a sexual orientation innuendo?” Watson asks.
I think it's safe to say that I'm in the majority when it comes to this episode giving me too many feels at the beginning and the end.
"Will you grab my chargers while you're up?" Sherlock asks, uncharacteristically polite.
She steps forward again, him back. It’s the slowest dance in the world.
John started to pack the night before their trip, folding his clothes carefully and placing them into his overnight bag along with his toiletries and a book just in case they retired early. The suit that Sherlock had insisted on buying him hung on the wardrobe and John cast his eye over it. It was obviously expensive, a designer that John had never heard of but who had his very own boutique on a fancy street in Central London. John had stood nervously whilst a short Italian man took his measurements and hummed something to himself in his own language when he measured John’s inside leg. John was sure he heard Sherlock chuckling but he immediately pushed the thought away as he was given swatches of fabric to chose from. Deciding on a blue pinstripe suit with a colourful inside and a white shirt, Sherlock had paid with a flamboyant swipe of his debit card and they were told to collect it in a fortnight.
“My pajamas are upstairs. I didn’t consent to do the study nude; I’ll be back down in a moment,” he calls without stopping his progress.
They’ve been through situations like this countless times before; it’s not really a big deal anymore. However, they’ve learned over the years that they need to navigate them cautiously so that one of them doesn’t end up hurt on accident. After all, there are worse things in the world than being mislabeled as a couple. Some lies that hurt more.
When John reached down between their bodies to grasp Sherlock’s cock, the younger man’s eyes shot open in alarm.
“You’re right: it matters little,” Holmes confirms.
“What makes you think he isn’t always just as clever?”
Sherlock catches them a cab as effortlessly as he ever does and they sit with a respectable distance between them, hands to themselves.
“Lovers will sometimes do these things together, but not friends.”
“You think I was pretending, but…”
Watson hums in agreement.
And then Holmes did something completely unexpected in that moment: he chuckled. Slightly offended, I pulled away so I could look at his face.
“Is he…Jesus Christ, is he
“Really?” John asked, shocked and surprised. His tone of voice must have been too much as Sherlock turned to move away with a mumble of apology, “No, Sherlock stop!” John insisted, pushing Sherlock back and trapping him with his arms, “It’s fine! It’s okay.”
“And you
“Sherlock,” John whispers, pulling away and stroking Sherlock’s hair, “Sherlock this --”
“They've been friends a while,” John answered, “Although Greg hasn't told me in person, he did hint that he was seeing someone...”
“Maid Marion. Yes,” Sherlock answered moodily, “
“You were going to lose me either way, I didn’t see what it mattered if I told you.”
“Let me see your cock,” he clarified with a playful smirk, “I want to see that big hand wrapped around your cock, those elegant, thin fingers moving along it over and over and over again.”
“John wouldn’t like it,” Sherlock huffed, “being looked at that way. If not by me then not by anyone. I’m his best friend, he told me so.”
Sherlock sighed heavily, as though he were the most put-upon human on the entire planet, “I simply meant your hand on my penis. It was far too much stimulation this early on in our love making.”
“There is no obviously in this case!” Greg seethed, “You broke into my flat, watched me...
Mrs. Hudson fusses over the trio until Sherlock growls at her (
“Wrong,” Holmes called harshly from near the bodies. Though he did not turn to face us, the rigid line of his back and the icy quality of his voice let me know immediately that he felt the same about Inspector Jones’ words as I.
- so if this is the only way he’ll get to keep Sherlock, it’ll do. It’s enough.
John’s face lights up with a smile made for a saint. They meet in the middle for a happy, chaste kiss. Nothing has ever felt this right.

John, however, returns in time to find Sherlock on the edge of the roof.
he did - but he had almost loved him so long that he forgot he’d never actually told him that yet. He turned his head to the left to look at Sherlock’s face, frozen in place by confusion and doubt.
Sherlock is taken to the plane full of corpses.
John’s body knows the answer to the problem, even if his brain is too muddled to remember it at the moment.
Sherlock looks as disturbed by the revelation as Holmes is, and John just as entertained as Watson.
“How can you tell?” Inspector Lestrade asked with awe.
right now.”
John asks about cases on the website which sets Sherlock off in to a frenzied explanation of a case involving a glowing rabbit.
“No way, you gave him your Captain coin?!” Bill genuinely whines before collapsing back in his chair, face towards the ceiling and arms to the side in a pose of complete surrender.
“John. This isn’t what I want…” Mycroft seemed to grimace, “In fact, I’d be happy to never discuss Sherlock’s...
“John!” Sherlock scolds with a pout. He
Sherlock leans back against the couch comfortably, giving John a sultry look that dares him to continue on. John answers the look with his own one of mischief before placing his hands on either side of Sherlock’s head to brace himself as he places his feet on the floor. He utilizes the standing position he's now in to open the button and fly of his trousers; not to remove the garment, merely to relieve the pressure on his burgeoning erection. Sherlock looks less cocky as he bites his bottom lip, eyes focused on John’s actions hungrily.
Sherlock is pulled from his inner mantra of “Alive, safe, here, alive, safe, here,” by John’s right hand gently carding through his curls.
,” I whispered in return, my breath caressing his lips. We dared not speak the names louder for fear of discovery, but we needed the intimacy that the given names provided us, “It isn’t fair,” I spat.
John just laughs, moving to grab his coat from the hanger, as well. It’s not cold enough yet to wear them, but it probably will be by tonight.
bad.”
“Good lord, you two are disgustingly domestic,” Mycroft bemoans, making a show of turning his face from the pair in disgust.
Watson opens his mouth to say something before he’s even formulated the words, but closes it again when he watches Holmes’ eyes drift to his mouth with undisguised longing. And he knows, as though he just plunged head-first across a threshold of revelation, that not only does Holmes return his love, but that the mere thought that he – even a different dimension version of himself – nearly lost John Watson and let him down is unbearable. Unthinkable.
John rolls his eyes as Sherlock insults the other guests at the table without even thinking about it, “Close enough,” he insists again, just as he did a few days ago when the argument originated.
Mortimer walks away from the table and John is left, once again, with a look of unsurprised
out, much less any of the million words that have been left unsaid between him and his deceased friend.
“Nope,” John shook his head, standing and walking to the hallway where he collected his coat and shoes before turning back to Sherlock, “I’m going away now. To forget this.”
“I still don’t know,” he admits, his unease also increasing significantly.
Merry/Happy Christmas everyone! We hope this smut makes up for having to deal with families. Love you all!
John sighed and ran his left hand over his face for a moment, thinking of other ways to help him.
The others make affirmative noises and Zach stands, “I’ll help you carry. Besides: I still owe you yours from the coin check.”
Holmes stares at him calculatingly, as though doing the math on the statement before turning away again.
“Shh,” John shushes, jaw feeling like it’s working overly hard, “Sleeping.”
Sherlock’s stomach drops and he sways on the spot at the news, unbelieving that John could really be dead. He shakes his head to clear the thought from his mind since it will only serve to distract him. He needs to take Mary down, and to do that he needs to focus.
anything, yet he can’t look away.
“Yoo hoo! Boys!” their Mrs. Hudson calls to them as she enters the flat with a tea tray in hand.
“I know,” John assured him, still smiling, “you hate it when I’m right.”
Sherlock attempts to continue to trust in her goodness, unwilling to believe that he could have been so far off base – so
move.”
“Yes,” Sherlock admits, seeing as he can’t exactly deny it.
Just as Sherlock proclaims that there never was a monster, they hear a howling. A dog appears, presenting as the hound to all of their drug-addled minds. There is another figure, breathing oddly, approaching through the mist at the same time. Sherlock approaches him and removes the gas mask to find Moriarty staring back at him before he morphs back in to the actual Dr. Frankland. Sherlock realizes that the drug is in the fog.
“Again!” Watson exclaims, “Merely a shake of the head and there I go in to some random car once more.”
“I don’t know why
“Freak thinks he’s some sort of proper genius,” Sally sneers, “and Sidekick over there thinks Freak hung the moon.”
Watson gives him a pained look before speaking truthfully, “There’s not anything you could ever admit to me about yourself that I would not accept you for.”
“I need you. Just you,” Sherlock said, reaching up to touch John’s face with a smile before lifting his hips and thighs into a better position so John could shuffle up the bed.
Sherlock peeked one eye open and pulled back just enough to see a bit of John’s eyes in return.
John huffs disbelievingly as he searches Sherlock’s eyes, but finding only an open, trusting longing in their bright depths, “You’re still dressed,” is all he can think to say.
“John clearly thinks Sherlock puts puzzles before people,” Holmes states, “Is that how you feel, as well?”
“Why would I need you?” Sherlock asked, puzzled; he was back in his family home, safe and content with his stomach filled and his adoring parents not far away.
God, it’s no wonder the rest of the world makes fun of them!”
one friend. He probably wouldn’t even have conceded to
“This one,” he says fondly, proclaiming his new favorite freckle.
“Maybe we should have done something like that for
“You don’t...feel disappointed not to hear them?”
"No; it wasn't fully charged when I turned it off and you know my battery holds a charge for shit."
Mrs. Hudson tells Sherlock to talk to John. Sherlock says John's position was quite clear.
“Do what I did; I know you watched every moment in fine detail,” he told him, holding back a blush at the thought of how thorough his brilliant mind must have truly watched him bring himself off.
“Sorry about back there,” Zach says, scooting just a bit closer to Sherlock, “I had no idea you didn’t know about John.”
“Sweet. Baby. Jesus,” Watson intones angrily, second-hand embarrassed once more by his alternate self.
make me that quietly excited. Has that not worked out well for you?” He purrs seductively.
As they dance in a slow circle, John pulls Sherlock flush to him so their chests are pressed together with John’s chin resting on Sherlock’s right shoulder. Sherlock inhales sharply as John whispers in his ear, “Now people will definitely talk,” he quotes a conversation from a million years ago.
“Tell me to stop,” John practically begs on a whisper, eyes still locked on his lips. His heart is hammering in his chest and everywhere he touches Sherlock is aflame despite the unbelievable cold.
“So why were you sad while I was near?”
“Please. Let me show you what you mean to me; how much I absolutely
John responded positively in kind, and when the kiss ended, it was Sherlock who spoke first.
“I mean night emissions, yes,” Sherlock is glaring at him challengingly. He didn’t think he had a problem with sex until he started talking about it with John, and now he can’t seem to bring himself to stop thinking about how knowledgeable John is about sex; how John could help him collect data on the subject, if only he could gauge whether John was about to die from laughing so hard at his best friend’s lack of experience first.
Watson laughs, “What other case have you used your riding crop database for?”
John makes the mistake of looking at the people around them and notices the mix of curious and pleased eyes staring at them. Fuck ‘em. Let them stare; they’re just jealous that John got to him first. He drops his head slightly so that his nose is now centimeters from the side of Sherlock’s neck, inhaling his familiar, comforting scent as Sherlock’s body shudders involuntarily. John closes his eyes to cherish the content feeling flowing through him.
“The hell is her problem?” Watson grumbles, “Hasn’t she caused him enough trouble?”
She laughs, “Not nearly recent enough to make the math work out for you to be the father. Were you just in denial?” She asks patronizingly with a smirk.
Sherlock looked at him in exasperation because
“Quite,” Sherlock says as he looks down at himself with a wince. He’s ruined everything. His one chance is gone.
They stare at each other with an intenseness they had been lacking since Holmes’ return from the dead; the closeness they had so easily at the pool. They can see the truths, the declarations, in each other’s eyes but cannot speak them. There’s nothing left but a million words to say.
There could be any number of explanations for this, but Holmes reasons that there are only two likely culprits: 1. Like Holmes, Sherlock doesn’t care to spend any time – especially drinking – with anyone but John Watson or 2. Sherlock merely wants to spend time with John – just the two of them – one last time.
? You detest it.”
John sighed, rubbed at his temples and then groaned low and loud, “Fine! Fine. Alright. Whatever you want.”
Back to John and Sherlock in the house, they prepare to head out and meet Magnussen for the exchange via helicopter. Sherlock iterates how dangerous this plan is, how dangerous Magnussen is, before they head out.
Sentiment for his daughter? Some sense of duty towards his manipulative wife?
Title is a snippet of the line "I hear the secrets that you keep when you're talking in your sleep" from "Talking in Your Sleep" by The Romantics.
like a clean-shaven version of you.”
“You’re awfully jealous, Watson,” Holmes observes of the encounter on screen.
The corner of John's mouth lifts, "Of course you're not," he sarcastically placates.
Watson’s lips are pursed and his eyes are a mix of apology and sadness, “I’m sorry,” he states, “You’re right.”
“Goddammit,” he swore quietly in reply, somehow thinking that he’s going to actually do this. He’s going to actually let this happen.
“You’re my friend. The only friend I’ve ever really had. You call me your best friend because you enjoy other people, but I detest everyone but you,” he whispers, still caught up in emotion but seemingly unable to stop the truth from escaping, “You’re kind and smart and so talented in so many things and you care about me, I know you do. I’m no good with emotions; my family isn’t big on touchy-feely declarations of love so I haven’t known…I never knew
Sherlock carefully gauges the situation and, by way of greeting, names them all from left to right, “You must be David, Zach, and Alan,” gesturing to each as he names them.
“No. No it's – er...” John said, not wanting to be a bad guest as he looked at Sherlock pleadingly, “I don't want to be a nuisance.”
“Extremely,” he agrees.
Sherlock leads John to seeing Mary as a client (skipping over “My lying wife” and “The woman who’s carrying my child who has lied to me since the day I met her”). The look on John’s face is completely manic as he assumes his natural role as assistant to Sherlock - only, for the first time ever, John’s empathy for the client is less than Sherlock’s.
At one point, Sherlock grumbles in annoyance at being pushed around and, still asleep, rolls on to his right side so that he’s now facing John. This obviously makes the snoring louder, because science. John growls angrily as he rolls on to his left side, facing Sherlock with mere inches between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
It takes John a good few moments to recognize that it’s Sherlock standing before him, but when he does he freezes, unable to believe his eyes. Sherlock attempts to make light of the situation, but John is too pissed off to hear it. He stands, punching the table as Sherlock continues to joke, and speaks in the lowest, most dangerous tone that Sherlock Holmes has ever heard him speak in, yet his eyes speak infinitely louder than his words of the immense hurt he’s been through. Sherlock has never been good with his own emotions, much less other people’s, so he attempts another joke about John’s moustache to deflect. John tackles him to the ground, trying with all his might to strangle him.
you,” he stressed before placing his hands on the flies of the trousers, his eyes pleading up into the massively dilated ones above him for permission.
“Goodnight, John.”
“No,” Watson states easily, a steely resolve in his own blue gaze, “you never ask me again. From here on out understand this: you run,
“But…” Holmes begins but is cut off by Watson’s lips against his own. His resolve melts as he considers never having this aspect of their relationship. He had lied to himself for years by insisting that friendship and living together was enough. It wasn’t even
And with that last sentence, Sherlock’s eyes open again. With incredible resolve, he rises from the floor – the monitors in the real world responding – and climbs back up the stairs. Sherlock wakes up.
Would they matter?
Mary takes Wiggins and Isaac home while John takes Sherlock. They arrive to find Mycroft leading Anderson and a woman in searching the flat for drugs. Sherlock curls up in his chair and John notes the absence of his own.
As Sherlock stands to close the distance between them so they can experience their first kiss, John looks down at the ring. It is a cheap child’s toy ring, adjustable, with a metal animal shaped in the middle.
“Why would we
Be that as it may, Sherlock can only think of one thing: “Never have I ever kissed the same person twice.”
“We know it’s hard to believe,” Watson assures her after a few more seconds of uncomfortable silence.
The group begins talking more about their jobs and struggles of civilian life, none of which Sherlock takes much of an interest in. Instead, he steels himself and slyly replaces his hand on John’s thigh, as he had earlier in the night when he needed comfort. His heart literally skips a beat (he feels it) when the fingers of John’s left hand naturally slot into the spaces between his own fingers, John’s thumb running lightly over the knuckle at the base of his pinky.
“Actually, I really would like to watch a bit of it.”
“Your turn,” John whispers, gaze still locked on the intense eyes of his genius.
“Hello,” Sherlock says unenthusiastically before he can stop it escaping. He curses himself in his mind; sometimes he thinks he must be subconsciously attempting to botch John’s chances with women to be able to keep him to himself.
John blinked at Sherlock's quick refusal but nodded, “Okay, that's fine; I'll just leave it on the mantle if you want to look at it. It's not for another two months anyway, so you have plenty of time to try and remember.”
“Yes, he should have been more courteous to you in that regard,” Holmes smirks.
” instead.
“Apparently Anderson’s idea of how Sherlock is still alive.”
bail us out if we were arrested?” Holmes asks his own question instead of answering Watson’s.
In 221B, John’s chair has been placed back in its spot, a bottle of Claire-de-la-Lune on the table next to it.
“But there was your wife?” David dries his hands with a paper towel before handing a few to John.
“Shall we continue, then?” Holmes asks as he grabs the remote and pushes play a second after Watson agrees.
Sherlock looks up from his phone curiously before putting the pieces together, “Oh, that. Yes. Well, the last couple of times it rather slipped my mind.”
John laughs, “Well, we can play a drinking game if you’d like to make it more entertaining.”
intentional?”
“John?” He questions quietly, a bit unsure of himself.
“He was. Actually, my first published work was done alongside Professor Ellis. We worked on a paper together documenting the effects of enzymes on the -- you’re not interested in that part. It’s dull and tedious and was discounted a few years later. By me,” Sherlock chuckled, “Professor Ellis sent me a card of congratulation for that and we stayed in touch. He’s a good man.”
Sherlock sighs dramatically, removing his coat with a flourish unique to the detective, and gives in, “Yes, fine.”
Sherlock looks confused as he snatches the last case from the other man’s hands to read it. John merely rolls his eyes and places the other three cases in a different spot on the table.
Holmes searches his eyes, unsure whether he can believe the words. He appears on the verge of admitting something then, but turns away before he can allow himself to.
John makes his way up to the flat to find Greg and Sally there with Sherlock. A kidnapping has occurred, the children of the English ambassador to the U.S. Taken from their boarding school, the ambassador requested Sherlock’s help specifically. The angle changes to a different camera, black and white, probably a security model.
“Sherlock!” John called after him, cursing under his breath as he practically had to jog to catch up to the other man. When he finally caught up to him on the front step, Sherlock was signalling to the family driver to bring the car around.
Holmes and Watson watch as Sherlock talks to Molly about having a suspicion he might die. She offers to help him. Meanwhile, John is back in Mycroft’s office, accusing him of leaking private details of Sherlock to Moriarty. Mycroft admits that it was the only way to get the information out of Moriarty that he had been seeking and John is affronted. He storms out, ignoring Mycroft’s attempts for John to tell Sherlock that he’s sorry.
John nods in satisfaction, “Will you keep making me non-drugged tea?”
They could use a tea and loo break, anyway.
Watson grits his teeth, “Yeah, well…” he trials off, nowhere to go with it.
“I know you have reservations because I first said it while under the effects of the potion,” Sherlock whispers again, but now merely nervous versus being emotional, “but I really do love you.
Mrs. Hudson assumes
Watson doesn’t want to continue the conversation for fear that his own romantic feelings towards Holmes will be revealed somehow. He’s not upset that Sherlock and John appear to be exceedingly comfortable around each other, he’s upset about how easy they make it look.
Moriarty is being led by police to the court room.
“Wait! Did you need us for something?” Watson calls in confusion.
“Sherlock,” John interrupts with a frown, “bit not good.”
Sherlock turns on the lights to reveal that it wasn’t a dummy at the end of the hallway, but John. The look on John’s face is a mirror of what Watson’s has been for a long time.
“Very easily could have been right, though. Truly, it was an adequate explanation of some of the facts.”
“When do we begin?” He asks, feigning a put-upon tone.
Awhile later, Sherlock made a statement, “No, I’ll wear the purple shoes,” to which John agreed, “They look better with the shirt.”
“Do you think our Moriarty did something like this?”
Regardless, I relish in your body pressing closely to mine in what very well may be – surely
Once his torso is bared, Sherlock runs his hands reverently over the skin before John swoops in for another hungry kiss. It’s a short one, John pulling back quickly to resume his work of undoing Sherlock’s buttons, forcing him to scoot back towards the taller man’s knees slightly to allow room for his hands to work. Once undone, John slowly guides the expensive material towards Sherlock’s shoulders. Sherlock leans forward, kissing John as his own hands move behind his back to yank the material off of his arms, throwing it to the side, uncaring of where it lands.
One of the women clears her throat and kindly asks, “So, how long have you two been together?”
He moans quietly before answering, “I can take care of it myself if you don’t want...if you don’t feel comfortable. I can do it in the loo, if you’d prefer.”
Watson performs a suffering sigh, “These DVDs with your name on it.”
Sherlock does not hesitate to give up what he thinks is his power card to get John out of that ruddy vest. Moriarty takes the missile plans and chucks them in to the pool, throwing the offering in their figurative faces. John seizes the opportunity to latch on to him from behind, leading the snipers to change their aim to Sherlock.
Sherlock surreptitiously checks to make sure that John is gone before pulling out his laptop and prompting Moriarty to meet him at the pool.
Sherlock immediately set off into his room, rustling fabric and squeaking the bed as he jumped onto the mattress and got comfortable, “Come on, John!” He called impatiently.
John wakes suddenly at the admission, groggy enough at first for Sherlock to remove his hand from his cheek in alarm, but not quickly enough for him to feign sleep.
“You had a nightmare,” I state, “that’s all I can tell,” I’ve always had a bit of a blind spot when it came to anything too in-depth with you.
“Yes, him. Awful boy. I wish I could have given him a good punch up the bracket!” Mr. Holmes complained, “The way he used to talk about our Lockie, calling him all sorts of names and making accusations. They said he was gay, you know, John. Like that was an insult!”
Anderson shifts from foot to foot uneasily before stammering, “Right, I’ll just leave you to it then,” and walks out the door.
John should have been surprised. He should have been frustrated. He should have been
“Oh,” Mycroft obviously grimaced, “I shall look into it. Thank you, Gregory.”
In their own past, Holmes and Watson had been walking to the Reichenbach Falls – Holmes wanted to show Watson the beautiful sight – when a young boy had come running after them. He was sent from the hotel they were staying at because a woman was injured – not bad enough to call an ambulance but urgent enough to see a doctor if they could. Watson had asked Holmes to come back with him but he wouldn’t, an odd feeling overtaking him that Moriarty had followed them here despite it all.
“John, John, John,” Sherlock pants as his pace increases. Neither of them will last long, not after what John has put them through.
“Holmes,” he uses his Captain voice, “Were. You. There?”
“Jesus,
“I had lodgings,” Sherlock answered, avoiding the topic before giving the briefest smile when he saw his mother, who had come to greet the car. John looked over at the woman, a short, stout, but kind looking woman with a bob of silver hair and the sparkling eyes of a mother excited to see her youngest child after a long absence.
John leaves the room and lights a magazine on fire to set off the smoke-detector as Sherlock walks Irene through the facts of the case of the missing pictures. Irene gives away the location of the pictures with a single glance when she hears the alarm. John has difficulty getting the detector to stop shrieking until an American sneaks up on him and shoots it before leading John back in to the sitting room.
Holmes and Watson both feel their stomaches clench at the words. This never happened with their Mary…most none of what she’s done ever did. Theirs was nice and genuine, and the fact that she died and this version has lived? It’s unjust.
"So?" He asks, clearly not thinking.
“What seems to be the trouble?” Holmes asked, standing from his chair and I followed suit.
“He should be more worried about his cholesterol. The fat git,” Sherlock sneered, but there was a sweet blush against his cheeks as he spoke.
If he wants to be honest about it (which he doesn’t) he hasn’t
John, standing by his side table, moves to place his keys in his overnight bag (he and Sherlock got a room at an inn in a town nearby to where Bill wants to meet up. His get-together, his choice). He hesitates as his hand hovers over the coin sitting atop the table, but figures that being out with a group of his old squadron, he’s likely to need the thing, so he places it in the pocket of his jeans. Truthfully he almost always carries it with him - except at work - just in case. That’s what they tell you when they give it to you: always have it within reach, just in case.
I stopped my pacing and stared at the door expectantly with bated breath. My heart began hammering in my chest at the mere thought of seeing his face, and I hated to dwell on the implications of that fact.
Watson smiles widely, “Of course I love you, too. It’s always been you.”
“Oh, God,” Holmes whispers, wiping his mouth with his hand as if to rid it of a foul taste, which, to be fair, is entirely possible considering the memory the title brings.
Holmes looks towards Watson briefly in shock before turning back to the telly with a contemplative, “Hmm.”
He nodded once, sharply, “Lead the way, Inspector,” said he and we were on our way within moments.
John smiles at that, “Yes and no. Like I said: it’s used as a unity tool, but also as a friendly pitting of the various branches of the Armed Forces against one another. For drinks.”
a nice dream.”
With a quick nod, Sherlock returned his focus lower, gathering some saliva on his tongue as he examined the dry-looking skin. He leaned forward and tentatively ran his wet tongue up one of the testicles, causing John to huff out a quiet something that sounded vaguely like an “oh”, but really, it was difficult to be sure.
The touch of lips is electric - dizzying. John moves his hands to frame Sherlock’s face and pull him yet closer. It is a kiss full of love and need and speaks volumes of time wasted.
When they look back at the telly, Sherlock and Mary have just arrived at the correct location and Sherlock does not hesitate to pull John from the burning fire. When John’s eyes are finally able to focus, they’re on Sherlock and not Mary.
“I talk and laugh in my sleep, and I still have nightmares occasionally,” he answers easily.
“John, how?” Sherlock pants, wanting to help make him feel as good as John had made him.
“They aptly chose to use Holst’s
“Because I sort of like the idea of us celebrating it on our own day; to hear it from him before anyone else.”
Watson comes out of his head to see his -
“Come on, let’s get you to bed,” John sighs in disappointment, recognizing that not all of the drugs have fully left his system yet, and assists him to his room. He pulls the covers down as Sherlock sits at the end of the bed looking very disoriented, “Shoes off,” John orders a bit firmer.
“No he’s not,” Holmes dismisses.
“I could deduce people to pass the time,” Sherlock offers quietly with a smirk, knowing John will not let him.
“No idea. Entire on-duty police force on our street, maybe they only had the one set of cuffs,” he says and they both laugh.
They fell back into silence as John read the paper and Sherlock went back to his research, but the peace was broken merely about an hour later.
“Not at all!” Mr. Holmes scoffed, pulling out the albums and moving to John's side on the other sofa. After sitting down, the older Holmes began pulling out photos and smiling, handing a few to John, “Oh look, there he is in the orchard! He was picking apples with Mrs. Henson, can you remember?”
for some entertaining posts.
,” Sherlock sniffed playfully, “absolutely dreadful.”
Holmes remembers his own fear in that moment. The American was smart, threatening John, because had he threatened himself he would not have budged. He doesn’t have much of a regard for his own life, but Watson’s is an entirely different matter altogether.
“Look! Sherlock leaves body parts in the fridge, as well!” He points out excitedly, as though this vindicates his own actions.
“That was amazing,” John breathes out reverently while smiling.
“John, there’s no
“A good pill and a bad pill laid out like it’s The Princess Bride?” Holmes asks in outrage.
“Yes. That,” John laughed, “and I’ll deal with...everything else.”
John does not look away from Mary’s face, even as Sherlock guides him to his chair so he can investigate, in fear that she will rise up and try again to shoot either of them. Sherlock grows frustrated that he can’t reach the wound past the restricting material and stands to finally grab the knife from the mantle. He uses it to carefully, despite shaking hands, cut the fabric up his leg.
“In a moment. I’ve just remembered something I have to deal with,” John called back, not daring to turn around.
“I suppose...we should go to our separate beds,” Sherlock whispers, sounding bereft and demoralised, “since we were only doing this to conserve body heat.”
“Inspector Jones,” Holmes greeted coolly in return, a slight nod of his head in acknowledgement, as his eyes never left the bodies on the ground.
“Of course you’ve been keeping track.”
Watson’s stomach drops to see the look on Sherlock’s face as he walks away. It’s subtle, but Watson has known Sherlock Holmes for long enough to see the pain there…how lost and listless he appears. He’s unspeakably glad that he never put Holmes through this. Did he? He looks over at his friend and sees an empathetic, calculating look on his face.
“I thought I was losing my mind, so I was reverting back to my comfort zone of being alone. I was afraid that you would judge me if you knew I had seen it, that’s why it took me a while to confess it.”
Holmes merely smiles as he obligingly says nothing more and turns back towards the telly.
Sherlock is talking to the tour guide – Fletcher - when John comes along. Sherlock plays like they have a bet going and John latches on to the lie quickly to back him up. Fletcher launches in to his recalling of seeing the hound about a month ago and Sherlock isn’t convinced until he pulls out a mould of a giant paw print.
He’s awoken again what feels like seconds later to the sound of more snoring, but the pain in his left shoulder tells him that he must have been in this position for some time now. With a pained groan, he rolls onto his back once more and tries to fall asleep through the twinge of pain. But Sherlock is snoring again, presumably because the contact has ended.
John began thrusting again, but he was definitely curious, “Oh yeah? Tell me another one,” he challenged.
“Father!” Sherlock shouted, outraged and scandalised.
Sherlock turns to look at him, a bit embarrassed, “I thought they would be more suitable for a night out with the guys at a pub,” he explains before shifting self-consciously, “Not good?”
Next scene is Moriarty just outside the Tower of London.
“That’s what the
Nodding quickly, John laughed, “Yes. Yes, please do. Help yourself.”
“You spent the entire time pointing out the historical inaccuracies.”
“I’m not going to swoon like a Victorian maiden, John,” Sherlock huffs, feeling suddenly brave as he shimmies across the space and settles himself in the crook of John’s neck, inhaling the scent whilst his hands roam tenderly across John’s naked torso. John smiles, hiding his face in the dark curls and inhales the musky scent of Sherlock’s hair, giving it a soft kiss before pulling away for a jaw-cracking yawn.
They watch as John gets hit in the head, Sherlock finding the spray-painted message, John waking up in a dark location.
They all sit down: Bill, Alan, and Zach on one side and Sherlock, John, and David on the other. Mostly the five former soldiers chat about old stories and “remember when”s as Sherlock happily sits taking in all of the small details about a John-before-Sherlock.
John falls to his knees between Sherlock’s spread legs, running his hands from knees up to the button and fly of the other man’s trousers now. John grabs the fabric of both trousers and pants, pulling gently at first to try to avoid causing any discomfort to the other man’s cock, while Sherlock lifts his hips to aid their departure.
because I got in to an unmarked, random black car?” Watson smirks.
Sherlock sighs at his lover’s sentimentality, running his right hand through John’s hair reassuringly.
Fury flashes in her eyes and she finally raises the gun while removing the safety, pointing it at his head.
“Me too,” I quietly agree.
this?” he parrots back quietly.
“I’m sorry, but she
I have no idea,” he says as gently as possible.
“Their minds are limited and I don’t care to be understood by them,” he asserts pompously.
Watson grits his teeth; he had not missed that sound one bit.
John places his hands over Sherlock’s before rising on his knees again, breaking the contact below, “I think about your hands,” he pants, eyes practically afire with desire as he looks at Sherlock hungrily, “your graceful,
John grits his teeth. Truthfully, he’s happy to see her and to know that both Holmes brothers are on his case, but he’s incredibly worried that Mary will see through this ruse and…what? She’s never gotten physical with him and, really, what more could she do to limit him? But still, he worries.
“Oh hell, what does that
Sherlock’s mind palace races as he combines facts that seemed to be completely separate from each other until this moment. Mycroft receives a message from Moriarty cluing him in to the fact that their Bond Air plan has been discovered.
“Oh God, please, Sherlock,” he whines, “Do
John smiles slightly and mutters a quiet “Yeah” and the rest of the meal passes in a companionable silence.
“Good...” Sherlock trailed off, not entirely sure what John wanted, “So, er...”
To hold you in my arms like you’ll hold her, except that she gets to keep you.
John settles himself comfortably on the bed before inserting the disc into his hard drive. He sees Watson appear on the screen, seemingly filming in the same bedroom. It’s surreal and disorienting, seeing one’s self recording something in your location without it being you.
John can travel no further up due to Sherlock’s sleeves. He’s wearing one of his white button-downs with the sleeves rolled up to just above his elbows.
The bell rings, heralding Henry’s arrival to discuss the so-called gigantic hound. He shows Sherlock and John a documentary in lieu of explaining it himself at first, but Sherlock pauses it and demands that he explains in his own words.
“It’s good; even better than the last one you slept through,” he kept insisting.
My own stomach dropped at the implication as my companion’s face fell in to a hard mask of determination.
“Then hurry up!” Sherlock hissed, covering his face with his hands, “The anticipation is killing me.”
As he hears the door close softly, Sherlock blushes.
Sherlock can’t help the laugh that escapes him at the absurdly random deduction. They get quite a few heads turning their direction - including an eye roll from Greg - and both try to stop smiling long enough for their apology to at least appear sincere. They don’t succeed.
If John wasn’t hard before (which he was, a little) he definitely was now after listening to Sherlock’s declarations and feeling his body tense with pleasure. Stroking him through his first orgasm, John cooed and calmed the younger man softly as he coaxed the last drips out to land on Sherlock’s pubic hair and then let his hand fall to Sherlock’s thigh, “You okay?”
“You cannot be implying that they were in love,” Inspector Jones scoffed, raising the hackles of Holmes and myself, and I daresay those of Inspector Lestrade, as well.
“You clearly think that settling down and having a normal life is something that you need, and, over the years, I have discovered that I need you,” he admits beyond his will. He detests being so open like this, “Now, I can’t promise you a traditional normal life, but I’m guessing by the number of times you have chosen to join me on a case over continuing a date that that isn’t disagreeable to you. You know you will never find a woman who will leave our dynamic unchanged. So, what I’m saying is that if you need to be in love with someone, maybe you could be in love with someone like me.”
He’s silent for a few moments before he quietly says, “Oh.”
“Jesus,” John choked, “What? Sorry? Lestrade and…Mycroft?”
Sherlock sees that John is calm, plan worked out and ready to go, he just needs to give him an opportunity to act. He takes a step back.
He smiled a bit sadly, “It feels like an eternity. I find myself barely remembering a time before your involvement, and even less will to do so. I am a man who distances himself from others because it is easier to assess situations with an unbiased mind, but I have never been able to deny the pull I have towards you,” he stated with more confidence than I think I may have ever felt outside of a battlefield, though I could see the trepidation in his eyes, entranced as I was with looking into them.
“And you wonder why some people find you a bit odd?” Watson smirks.
John is looking at evidence pictures and recognizes the wax seal from the envelope he picked up earlier. Sherlock makes the connection to the tale of Hansel and Gretel and the poisoned chocolate they must be eating. Sherlock, with the aid of his homeless network, discovers the location of the children. They arrive at Addleston and bring the children in to the police department for questioning.
“Bless that woman, truly,” Watson says quietly.
“Would you like me to help arouse you?” He asked innocently.
Moriarty sings him a song in his head as John rides with him in the back of the ambulance to the hospital.
“Please,” Sherlock moans again, left hand tightening on his hip and pulling him somehow closer for a roll of hips.
John rolled his eyes, “Bruised at best, but you
. It’s not that the nightmares are at all pleasant, because they are anything but, however they tend to leave more of a feeling of loss than of torment these days.
“Honestly, just one punch would have sufficed,” Holmes admonishes, remembering the thrill of the tussle even through the pain of his cheek.
“Here,” John whispers, cautiously moving Sherlock’s hands away and replacing them with his own. He slides each button through the hole and peels it aside, showing for the first time Sherlock’s arousal-flushed chest and neck which momentarily takes John’s breath away, “You’re beautiful,” he mumbles, unable to stop himself from speaking.
“And yet here you are.”
,” Holmes seethes at the end.
“John,” Sherlock whispered reverently as the shorter man extended his hand in invitation.
Holmes sighs in aggravation, but holds the other man’s gaze as he adamantly replies, “Yes.”
John looks up at him suddenly, looking as though Sherlock brought him out of a trance with the words. His hand stills, continuing to hold the other man’s.
And now you’re married to someone else, and I only have myself to blame. She reminds me of myself in so many ways that I can’t help but wonder if I ever stood a chance with you, had I had the guts to try.
at all. It never has been, “Like I showed with Bill buying you a drink: if the challenger isn’t of equal or highest standing with all others challenged, that person owes the highest a drink regardless.”
Holmes stepped closer to me; merely an intimate distance separated us. It was not uncommon for us to disregard personal boundaries, but with my mind currently hung up on an incriminating comma, it was closer than I was comfortable with.
John swings his right leg over Sherlock’s lap so he’s kneeling above the other man without touching. Without another word, John buries his hands in Sherlock’s curls before bringing his mouth down to the younger man’s hungrily. The new angle gives them both better access to the other’s mouth, and they relish in it.
They’re pulled back to the screen when Sherlock is talking to Molly about how to not get completely vomitus during their stag night pub crawl.
“I think I’ll like this. Sex,” Sherlock grinned, “Sex with you. Nobody else.”
John, just like the last time, pulls him back closer to him reflexively before responding groggily, “You kick,” he says as he moves his right leg against Sherlock’s, “and you’re handsy, you bloody sleep-octopus.” It’s not actually an accurate descriptor for Sherlock’s apparent need to touch him in the night, but his sleep brain loves the title anyway.
John simply sat staring at the empty hallway - at the closed door - for far longer than he probably realised. Something about Sherlock’s behavior had his sense of curiosity nearly bursting with unanswered questions. He sighed heavily, drinking his now-cold tea with a grimace before placing it off to the side.
feeling in his gut that he knew whose breath that was. Reluctantly, he opened his eyes and turned to find John nearly at his side; he hadn’t even heard him return.
“Don’t try to take too much. Focus on the head,” John whispered, moving his hand to curl into Sherlock’s hair, “You’re doing fine.”
“Fine, medical then. Doctor me,” Sherlock gestured between them, “I have a genuine medical emergency and need you to show me how to remedy it.”
“Oh, that’s just brilliant,” Watson fumes again, nearly as enraged as John.
know what that is?”
Henry arrives in the hollow first, prepared to take his own life with the gun in his hand, convinced that he’s gone insane and there’s no help for him. Sherlock talks to him, mostly attempting to distract him while they await Greg’s arrival, but also giving him the answers to his plight. That he isn’t crazy, someone - Dr. Frankland - simply wanted him to think so.
“It’s too much,” Sherlock said immediately, seemingly unable to stop the words flying from his mouth.
“What about it?” He looks genuinely confused.
Watson grunts, remembering that they
“It took you a ridiculously long time to figure it out,” she goads, “hadn’t you done the math that you practically refused to touch me after
John tilted his head and scrunched up his brow in confusion, “You said it
Sherlock is now pretending to be John’s waiter - with a fake French accent - and John is too caught up in his own head to notice. Sherlock walks away to get the champagne and Mary walks down the stairs to the table.
However, he didn’t think that it would be a problem this time judging by the twitching, throbbing member between his legs which seemed to already be leaking and coating the inside of his satin boxer shorts with wetness.
Sherlock asks in shock.
“Yeah, it’s a strange sensation,” John agreed, kissing the sensitive skin at the join of hip and thigh, “Just tell me if you need a moment.”
“Really?” Watson is shocked.
“This time I will not miss,” she assures him, “I made a mistake aiming for your heart last time; this time I’ll take out that massive brain you’re so proud of. There will be no Mind Palace to save you this time.”
John smirked triumphantly, cock growing yet harder from Sherlock’s dominant display, as he placed his hands behind his head and looked for all the world like the most relaxed man in existence, “Well, if you insist…”
What was Sherlock going to do?
Wiggins moves on to deducing further about John’s cycling to work by noticing that his shirt has creases, as though it’s been folded.
Watson’s eyes dance between Holmes’, looking for any trace of dishonesty but finding none.
Sherlock sighs, looking at his empty glass, “I think I need another drink; anyone else?” he asks while standing awkwardly.
He throws the pen down and leans back in his chair heavily, eyes closing as he tries to even out his breathing.
,” he says as he hugs him close again, “and let me get a few more hours of sleep.”
She’s trying to appeal to the father in him, almost as though she’s forgotten that that title was recently stripped from him.
I don’t know what kind of man you think I am, John, but even a Saint would place a curse upon you and yours.
people to think it was the same shade and connect the two of us,” Sherlock merely flushes slightly and moves to falsely negate the words, but John continues on before he can, “So you’ve gotten us in to this mess, and now you’re going to have to dance us right back out of it.”
Sherlock stressed in a muddle before exhaling, “I don’t want my first time to be -- in a hallway.”
“Oh, what’s it matter?” He asks with a touch of anger, “You were preoccupied being happy with Mary and I barely got to see you. It was like being alone all over again.”
like - and has been desperate to know if what he feels when he’s both near and far from his only friend is this fabled thing they call love.
annoyed with me,” John chuckled, although he did roll his fingers over the gland again, “One more finger.”
“I was a soldier,” is his only response to the statement, “Now put the gun down or I will shoot you.”
John shrugs and then gestures to Sherlock, “Your turn. What do you think I’ve done that you haven’t?”
John stills, his mind a flurry of activity, “Right. I see,” he says before adding, “actually no, I don’t.”
“Show me,” Sherlock repeated calmly, “those wretched videos aren’t anything like reality, and I need to understand why and how it all works.”
“Did he just
John doesn't even say anything, merely walks the computer to Sherlock's chair before turning to face him with a pointed look.
“No,” Watson says, dragging out the vowel, “just improbable and nonsensical.”
“She's away at her sister’s, we talked about this,” John sighed, making the tea and returning to his chair where he handed Sherlock his cup and then began to sort through the mail. “Oh, there's one here for you.”
“How very pedestrian,” Sherlock grumbled with a smile, allowing John to rearrange their limbs into a semblance of order so that Sherlock was finally able to rest his head against John’s chest, his fingers stroking patterns and equations onto the soft skin, “Won’t your penis get sore?”
“More James Bond than I actually am,” Holmes agrees, to which the other man looks at him with mouth agape.
“Hey, I can’t read minds or
I lost you?
“I think that might be the first time I’ve seen him actually use the umbrella for its intended purpose,” Holmes quips.
“Do they?” Sherlock asks, genuinely puzzled, “Why?”
“Is it that surprising? Some people like that,” John scoffs before he drinks and settles back on the makeshift bed, piling the blankets on top of himself and shivering.
Watson is stunned in to laughing, caught completely off guard by the affronted tone and his scolding of – essentially – himself.
“Just one patch at a time, please,” Watson admonishes.
He still looks uncertain about whether he should believe Sherlock or not, but he agrees hesitantly anyway, “Alright then.”
You’re expecting a baby. Something I could never give you.
We arrived to find the bodies on their backs, side by side on the cobblestones, and Inspector Jones hovering over them.
“No. You’re not.”
ever again.”
Huffing with a giggle, John does it again and again, stroking Sherlock’s flank in an almost hypnotic way until Sherlock pulls back, his eyes unsure as he stills John’s hand, “I...should I undress? The best way to treat hypothermia is with skin to skin contact.”
Sherlock puts his phone on the nightstand and moves on to his right side, facing John. He’s not incredibly tired, so he focuses his attention on John’s steady breathing. This is how he falls asleep.
He was so entranced by his own thoughts that Sherlock didn’t hear the quiet movements as John cleaned himself up, redressed, and moved towards the door. It opened to finally bring a distinctly disheveled, mildly confused Consulting Detective face to face with the sated, now shocked and mildly embarrassed Doctor. For an eternity (if either man had to estimate), they simply stared at each other.
“Sherlock is a bit of an actor, just like you,” Watson laughs at Sherlock’s sudden change in demeanor as he talks himself in to the building via a neighbor to the victim.
“Oh, this was a fun conversation,” Watson remembers.
“Oh, fuck,” John swore quietly as his hips bucked reflexively and his cock hardened, because the lower register of Sherlock’s voice has always been a weak point for him. Of course he had known.
Throughout the back and forth, one of them will move forward as the other moves back, as though they require that no more than four feet be between them at all times. John, in describing Sherlock to himself, becomes increasingly amused and gives him what Holmes and Watson can both identify as his flirty smile. Neither one mentions it aloud.
“I’ve heard,” John replied, turning to pick up their bags only to see them already disappearing into the house with the staff.
John closed his eyes and shook his head in disbelief at the direction that his life has gone, “No.”
Sherlock moves to take a bath, calling to John not to go in his room. So of course John moves towards his room as soon as the water starts. Janine comes out in nothing but a button-down shirt, calling Mycroft “Mike”, Sherlock “Sherl”, and telling him that things have been rearranged since he moved out.
“St. Agrecius - Patron Saint of All Things Atrocious.”
“I’ve missed this,” you whisper, eyes still lowered.
“Hmm,” Holmes hums, sucking on his teeth in thought.
“Alright,” John says in slight confusion, “thank you; I’ll be right out to collect her.”
“Hamish.”
“You’ve put up with so much during our acquaintance.”
There are lots of manly, hard hugs all around before John turns their attention to Sherlock, who is still sitting at the table.
Sherlock could not believe his erection hadn’t abated from the awkwardness. If anything, his arousal had only increased by having been caught listening outside the door. What the bloody hell was wrong with him?! He shook his head and tried to think of anything except the warm, hard body pressed against his.
-"If I Told You" from Wedding Singer the Musical
“You got what you had coming to you,” Watson holds firm to his beliefs.
Standing in the small group, Sherlock was arguing with a large, pasty-faced whale of a man who was pointing his thick finger into Sherlock's face, practically foaming at the mouth whilst Sherlock argued back. John felt his hair immediately stand on end, his anger building to bursting point as he clenched his fists and walked outside.
The first letter catches Sherlock off guard. Mrs. Hudson brings him a few pieces of post, one of which is a personalized envelope bearing his name in an extremely familiar scrawl: that of John Watson.
For not imagining this ever really happening, I had a pretty great time writing this and thinking up ideas.

Bill puts his phone down on the table and stands to embrace John in a tight hug, “I was beginning to second-guess if anyone would actually show. Whatever happened to that ‘to be early is to be on time’ shite they drilled into us in the army?” he grumps, but the smile gives him away.
,” he swears, “wake
“And the next second back to your old self,” Watson laughs, “You’re a bloody narcissist, you are,” he adds good-naturedly.
Sherlock gets John on the phone and directs him to where he needs to be. Holmes knows that there has to be some sort of plan, he wouldn’t really die in front of John. He had plenty of time to think of a plan or three, hadn’t he? While he waited for Moriarty to show up?
Suddenly, Holmes and Watson are even more grateful for the fact that they were able to come to an understanding that first night; that they were spared needing to go to these lengths to save one of the only things in their life
“Yeah, let’s never do that again,” he says seriously.
Over the course of what feels like the next few hours (but is more likely not even half of one) John continues to push, prod, and - admittedly - hit Sherlock to get him to just
“Oh pish and nonsense!” Mrs. Holmes chuckled, “Couldn’t miss the opportunity to see my boy. He hardly ever visits you know, John.”
“Well, get some sleep. It'll be a long day tomorrow,” John smiled, reaching over to squeeze Sherlock's hand, “You know where I am if you need me.”
“Shut up, idiot,” John laughs and gathers the detective in his arms, kissing him and shushing his protestations.
“Well,
”, “How were you supposed to have gotten me pregnant when we barely had sex?”
“Don’t see any reason why not,” Holmes doesn’t sound any happier, either.
The end credits roll.
Holmes is nervous about watching it because he’s not fond of being reminded of the pain he put Watson through, much less from this outsider perspective.
The first thing they see is what appears to be a retelling of Sherlock’s fall, but with truly horrendous action movie music in the background. They show Moriarty’s body being dragged away and a replica of Sherlock’s face pasted on instead. Sherlock jumps, bungee-cords back up, smashes through a window, and kisses Molly. Moriarty’s body is brought out of the building and placed on the sidewalk as Sherlock is shown walking calmly, remorselessly, out of St. Bart’s.
“Oh my God, is he going to frame her? Kill her?” Watson asks, reading the face that makes expressions so very much like his own, his mouth forming words in a cryptic way that he himself employs.
“Oh, Sherlock,
John moves his face lower so that their mouths are a mere breath away, his words coming to rest on his lips as Sherlock longs for the press of them against his own, “I think about your lips and how they would feel against mine,” he whispers, “I think about how swollen I could get them from kissing you for so long. Because I would, Sherlock,” it comes out as both a promise and a threat simultaneously, “I fear I wouldn’t be able to ever stop kissing them if you gave me the chance. Would you let me?”
“Inspector!” Mrs. Holmes interrupted, “That’s the one. Lestat, dear me. That was the vampire wasn’t it?”
) before Mrs. Hudson leaves him alone.
“Ok, next,” John finally whispers again, finding the next one to the right, “St. Alto. She was always coming second to St. Soprano.
Holmes laughs, “I’m glad to see that he’s a rubbish big brother in other dimensions, as well.”
Sherlock tutted in distaste before glaring indignantly up John’s body at him, “That won’t be necessary. Well...not
Greg laughed as he sat back on his sofa and laid his gun aside, aware of his nakedness only being covered by a stag patterned cushion, “You’re a bloody madman.”
For now, they both felt completely secure sealing it all with a kiss.
To the car dealership with the man who reminds Watson intensely of Sebastian again. Something about smug, greasy, untrustworthy people has always rubbed him the wrong way. They leave there and Sherlock does some experimenting until the phone rings again.
“A park.”
“Do you?” Sherlock whispered into the dim car, their eyes searching for each other.
did we just watch?” Watson asks.
“Are you going to tell me what the experiment entails?” John asks after settling.
“Clearly,” Holmes smirks as if he’s hiding a secret.
Holmes doesn’t voice any of this to Watson - he
“Homicide, you know that,” Watson admonishes.

run.”
With you I could have had a future I never dared to consider before...never wanted before you. Instead I head out in to the endless dark night and begin merely existing without you.
Sherlock and Molly go to the flat of the client who left his hat. Sherlock returns it and then discusses the security footage of one of Sherlock’s rats/markers on the tube, somehow disappearing between one stop and the next.
Sherlock couldn’t even form words, he simply nodded his head while shyly avoiding eye contact.
. He kisses that last freckle next to his spine in apology, and then he moves down.
Neither man is overly drunk, but it would be fair to say they were buzzed, and at the point where they were becoming very tired. Both men have felt the shift in their relationship tonight, and it’s the most comfortable they’ve ever been, knowing without having to say.
Sherlock swallowed thickly before nodding, “Alright.”
Sherlock demands to be given the phone, another difference from their own timeline. Holmes and Watson watch in confusion as he takes it over to the window. There’s a “flash back” to Sherlock rescuing Irene from her beheading and then he smiles as he places the phone in a desk drawer. The credits role.
“I think you should come in,” John says, stepping back from the door and allowing his best friend to enter. He can’t help but look around the common room quickly to see if anyone witnessed the display and is pleased to see the area deserted. He closes the door.
“Honestly, how is some of this footage even in here?” Watson asks incredulously.
In this same fashion, kissing every inch he could on his way back up, John finally stood and kissed Sherlock’s lips again. Taking a few steps back and placing space between their bodies, John lowered his steady hands to his own flies, removing the rest of his clothing as Sherlock watch with rapt attention to each bit of skin as it became exposed.
“As long as I can do it with my eyes closed,” he mumbles, almost unintelligible in his fatigue.
“No, just sleep,” he says before finally looking away from his phone, his eyes softening slightly as they land on John’s face, “Please,” he adds.
Back inside, John and Mary hug again before she goes limp in his arms. John helps her to the chair with uncertainty. Sherlock pops his head in and instructs John not to drink her tea. John quickly realizes that Sherlock has drugged the entire household but them and Wiggins.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock whispers brokenly.
“Good enough for me,” John concedes, lifting his arms above his head in a submissive, trusting gesture.
“What is it?” He asked with concern.
It wasn’t until three days later that the two men returned to their flat, covered in mud and leaves from their wrestle with a murderer. John had taken first shower, scrubbing himself pink, and then collapsing onto his own bed for a much needed nap, unwilling to deal with Sherlock’s pottering around the flat whilst he was so exhausted.
“Then we’re both well aware of how obstinate they’re being. They helped us, now it’s our turn to help them.”
His brow furrows, “Which part?”
“Would you like me to make you feel better?” John asked, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s jaw line.
Molly starts talking about her dad and Sherlock tries to stop her. But she keeps going about how he pretended to be fine when people were looking while he was dying, but when they weren’t…
Watson’s heart swells with adoration for this man: his friend and partner. He wonders if John really does love Sherlock like he himself loves Holmes. Are all John Watsons across the dimensions destined to fall in love with their Sherlock Holmes’? Because if there’s a way to prevent it, Watson clearly missed the signs.
They shake hands, John appearing as though he wants to renounce the hand and hug him instead, but he refrains. Sherlock walks away.
Holmes opens his mouth to say how dreadful that actually sounds – about as excited about the concept as Sherlock – but Watson speaks up before he can.
“Sentiment has never been a strong suit in our family. If there’s something to be gained, we acquire it by whatever means is necessary. I am constantly a card in his hand that he has no qualms playing.”
The thing is, now that he’s certain that Sherlock loves him in return, there is no way he can stay with her until that time has come.
have sex,” John shoots back, unwilling to take the blame for doing the right thing by sticking around for her and Amelia.
And that’s the moment John realizes.
“Yes,” he admits, eyes falling to somewhere near John’s arm, still wrapped around him.
Sherlock’s eyes hold a veritable array of conflicting emotions and questions and longings that John has no hope of even beginning to read, but he nods and answers with a quiet, honest, “Of course.”
Sherlock enters the pool and speaks. John enters via another door and Sherlock freezes, uncertain about the information being presented to him.
“He’s still alive there?” Holmes asks in horror.
Mrs. Hudson comes in and suffers Sherlock’s demands, as well. She refuses to tell him where his cigarettes are so he begins to deduce her recent activities, which sets her in to an embarrassed huff before she storms out. John attempts to stop him a couple of times throughout the tirade, but to no avail.
When he finally came back to full awareness - although still trembling hard - Sherlock had the good grace to feel sheepish at not having lasted longer, even considering it was his first-ever conscious orgasm. One look at John’s face put his fears to rest, however; John was smiling at him like he’s never seen anything more stunning and couldn’t possibly be any more pleased at his good fortune.
“I have...done that,” Sherlock grimaces, “A long time ago. However it wasn’t for romantic reasons.”
is alright.
His smile broadens of its own accord, “Yes.”
“And that was quick thinking on your part about me being your submissive sexual slave to explain the cuffs to the driver.”
lets himself believe that he can sleep through the rest of the night. With a quiet “Oh, thank God,” he does.
) but falters. Clears his throat and forces the words around the lump in his throat.
“What is this?” Anderson asks angrily, pointing at the screen.
“Hardened. Wankers,” Sherlock repeated slowly, all while looking at John like he’s an idiot again.
John deals with the check in process while Sherlock wanders around the room. Watson’s brow creases as he’s pretty sure the man is about to join the ranks of those who assume Sherlock and John are gay. John questions the inn keeper about the minefield and they chat as Sherlock does yet more exploring. Then the other inn keeper shows up and jumps right in to the ranks with the other believers of the nature of Sherlock and John’s relationship. John doesn’t correct him, merely changes the subject quickly.
Sherlock looks him in the eye with another
John appears not to have heard (or maybe just not care about) the terminology used to describe him just then, but Watson is affronted for his alternate self. John Watson is no one’s damsel in distress; he was a soldier, for crying out loud!
“But John!” Sherlock whined.
On a bench, as Sherlock and John wait for Bainbridge to come off duty, John asks Sherlock if he’d change anything about him being with Mary and Sherlock declines. Then John goes in to a touching speech about how much Sherlock has affected his life (which causes Watson to flush) only to find that the other man has walked off. John calls him a dickhead even though he can't hear him.
Next morning, Sherlock is playing violin as Mrs. Hudson fusses about with the cleanup from the night before as John puts his coat on and prepares to leave. Sherlock goes in to a flurry of speculation about how the counter being stuck at 1895 clearly means it’s the password for the locked phone. It isn’t.
Putting the comments together, John suddenly understood and smiled warmly “Oh! Oh you mean you haven’t...right. That’s fine! That’s...we can go slowly.”
“I was hoping that I had been wrong; that you wouldn’t succumb to the temptation to watch these DVDs,” Mycroft continues while grabbing the DVD remote and pausing the episode on John and other Mycroft talking in the warehouse to ensure that he has their full attention.
Sherlock uses the wall of 221B as a web map of rats and the sofa as a stepping stool to access it. Mycroft swings by the flat to enquire about how the case is coming along, but Sherlock doesn’t really have any answers except that he’s watching some people. They then begin talking about their childhood and how other people are idiots and dull.
“He’s going to make him watch?” Watson asks, appalled, eyes wide with hurt and anger.
Watson tips his head to the side, his brow furrowing in confusion, “Nothing I wouldn’t do again,” he assures.
The paramedics show up and place the assassin in the rig as John explains his most recent visit with Mycroft to Sherlock. They rush home and Sherlock tries to discover what it is that Moriarty told these killers he has that would cause them to paradoxically keep him safe. He discovers a security network nearby, asks Mrs. Hudson about the last time she dusted, and finds the camera near one of the books.
“So you should go to his retirement,” John insisted, “I’m sure he’d love to see you.”
“Oh, Hamish,” he admonishes with a sly smirk.
They see the title for the next “episode”.
“At this rate, we’re never going to finish,” Holmes mutters angrily, but Watson merely shushes him.
“No, it’s definitely broken; I couldn’t possibly touch myself now, Doctor,” Sherlock smirked, lifting an eyebrow meaningfully.
Sherlock merely rolls his eyes, still fighting a smile.
“I still can’t believe you followed him without telling me,” Watson says, the scenario exactly the same as they experienced.
“I've told you, I don't know him! I have no knowledge of a Professor Ellis, nor am I interested in returning to the school of my boyhood. It was a boring and uneventful period of my life that I have managed to ignore due to its tedium. Now, kindly forget it.”
John fumbles with the layers that are still so frustratingly in the way. He moves them just enough for their cocks to connect and grasp them both in his left hand. John thrusts against Sherlock and in to his own hand as Sherlock bows his back, his head tipping back in ecstasy. John leans down and sucks at the freckle to the right of Sherlock’s adam’s apple as he brings them both to mind-shattering, life-altering orgasms.
John tosses the garments aside before moving up again to support his hands on the seat cushion to either side of Sherlock’s bare hips. He leans down and kisses the lone freckle along the defined line where shoulder meets torso before moving to the six freckles of varying size and pigment located on his chest and sternum, above his nipple line.
“Yeah,” he says honestly, “Of course,” because it is. John has come to the conclusion that losing Sherlock - the multiple ways that he has in their past - was more painful than losing his traitorous, murdering wife. He doesn’t want to try to struggle through finding a woman who will accept the dynamic between Sherlock and himself without trying to change it - he’s too old for it
“We can always stop any time we want.”
As Sherlock softly plays soothing melodies that he knows John likes, he continues to watch his face to judge how it is affecting John’s sleep pattern.
“When?”
John attempted to kiss Sherlock’s lips, but the taller man consistently pulled his face to the other side so he was unable to land a proper kiss. John changed tactics.
“Pardon?” John blinked.
The day you got engaged was the day I died all over again, but this time for myself. You didn’t notice the difference because I was determined you wouldn’t see it; wouldn’t see the excruciating pain I felt in my very core to lose you after I was finally able to return home.
“No, I know that, I’m just saying that John isn’t the only one coming across as jealous,” he smirks as if in triumph.
“What are you on about?”
“Of course; that text was sent to me in our timeline and I deciphered it easily enough.”
John can’t think of how to properly word the end of the sentence, but Sherlock sways on the spot, ending the conversation anyway.
“Ye-yes, I am aware of that,” Sherlock gulped, attempting to clear the fog in his mind, “I just -- I’m not sure that doing it in a
There is complete silence in the entire restaurant as Sherlock and John simply stare at each other. John is trying to comprehend this sudden change of events, and Sherlock is subtly trying to urge him with just his eyes to make a choice quickly.
As they watch the scene play out, both wonder silently if John really is in love with Sherlock, but neither can voice it aloud.
“Nope, definitely true to form for you, as well.”
“Of course! Yeah…I don’t want you to miss out on this and it’s an excuse to get out of the flat for a bit. Go somewhere different,” John smiled, “Shall I RSVP for us both?”
“I came to tell you that I’m in love with you,” he answers simply.
“Sherlock has some fucking nerve sending you in here like this,” John growls, moving towards his chair and dragging it so he can sit in front of her.
“I do not
Wrapping a duvet around himself, Sherlock peeks out of his comfortable burrito for his next round.
Mycroft helps get them in without hassle, though Major Barrymore isn’t at all pleased about it. Sherlock has managed to get 24 hours of unfettered access to the facility to run his experiment which causes Barrymore to get in to a pissing match with the detective.
“But…” he says in shock.
Up in the girls’ dormitory, Sherlock finds an unmarked envelope with a red wax seal – same as the one John found earlier – and withdraws a book of fairy tales from it. They make their way to the boys’ dormitory and discover that he had hidden by his bed to attempt to avoid the intruder, writing “Help us” on the wall in linseed oil, as well as tracking it on his shoes. The boy liked crime stories so knew of the trick with linseed oil and black lights. They follow the footsteps down the hall until the oil ran out and the footsteps no longer show. As Sherlock collects a sample of the oil, John admonishes him for his timing of good cheer.
“Drugs, gloryhole, whore house,” Mycroft listed, “any of the numerous things he tried before. I’m following him on CCTV right now and so far he’s just wandering aimlessly around the park, but John…” he trailed off, clear worry evident in his voice.
John thinks, leaning back against his chair that’s helping support the roof of their hideout, “There’s lots of types, some better than others.”
With Sherlock’s hand held tight in his left and a bottle of expensive champagne in his right, John leads them out in to the night to find a cab to take them home.
“Yeah, why do you do that, by the way?”
John laughs before saying, “They’re not showing us the future are they?”
“Oh, looks like Sherlock isn’t too keen on Sarah,” Watson points out.
Moriarty clicks a second app on his phone, seemingly opening the vault in the Bank of England. Sally gets the call as they’re driving regarding it. Moriarty calmly writes “Get Sherlock” in silver marker on the glass before clicking a third app on his phone, seemingly letting down the security of the prison. Sally gets another call about this one, as well.
“John,” he calls quieter, as though he himself is lost.
John followed Sherlock the short distance into the room where they wordlessly paused next to the bed. John’s hands raised up to slowly, almost reverently, trace along the edges of the already-unbuttoned shirt and then down his cloth-covered arms, never once touching the skin directly. As he unhooked each of the cuffs, he took a moment to play lightly with the digits of Sherlock’s hands.
John’s eyes land on Sherlock’s lips for a moment before he looks back up, “Yes. It
“I do think about it sometimes,” Holmes whispers, unsure why he’s admitting to it, “which pill it was and if I would have died that night.”
Cut back to Henry, fighting sleep at his house; he’s so exhausted but every time he closes his eyes he gets flashes of the past that startle him back awake.

Watson grins lecherously, “
The security alarms go off and their progress is finally halted in a corridor. One of the male scientists – Dr. Frankland – covers for them for some unknown reason. He escorts them out, he explains that he’s a fan of the blog, and that he knew Henry’s father. He gives Sherlock his phone number so that they can catch up later.
“Bored,” Sherlock turns his face to the right, leaning in to his friend slightly, to mutter the word with disdain.
That did catch me off guard, “Why, I had no idea it had been that long!” For it had been
He had debated getting him a DNA necktie (in the event that he continues to guest lecture after retirement) or a stupid molecular-themed coffee mug (“Yet another year older...and still just as twisted!” with a double helix), but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. Besides, his well-meaning family members have probably gotten him the gamut of the available options as gifts over the years.
“Another example of you being cleverer than John; your idea of inputting all of Van Coon’s books in to a database on the computer and then using that to compare Lukis’ books to find overlapping ones was life-changing. There’s no way we could have gone through all those by hand and figured it out in time.”
“Mummy will ask questions. Be as vague as possible,” Sherlock warned, turning to look at John, “And don’t ask questions about my childhood, as she will insist on getting the photo albums out.”
Sherlock's eyes flit around and his hands rest in a thinking pose against his lips for only a minute before he breathes in loudly suddenly, "Okay, bored again. Entertain me," he demands once more.
Their impromptu staring contest is interrupted by Lestrade entering the flat. With a deep sigh, Holmes reaches for the remote to pause the DVD once more, just as Sherlock is going through his notecards to figure out where to start his speech.
“Holmes…” Watson starts, not entirely certain he wants to vocalize his most recent deduction.
“Oh please,” Holmes tries to stop Watson from reading too much in to it and stumbling upon the truth of his -
Back in the “present” after he’s walked through the case, Greg asks who had attacked Bainbridge and how, and Sherlock admits that they never figured it out.
After the opening credits, the screen shows John and Mary asleep in their bed, what appears to be John’s dream on display. Watson wonders how Moriarty knew what John was dreaming about, but knows that not only did Moriarty most likely make it up, but that it’s also pointless to ask the question aloud.
“A perfect match, we are,” John agreed with a soft kiss to the top of his lover’s head, “but we need to wash up before you fall asleep.”
“And will promptly masturbate,” Sherlock said without shame, “Let me watch.”
“You know, seeing it on screen like this, I spend an awful lot of time getting in to unknown cars with strangers,” Watson reflects.
“He thought he was clever; too clever to get caught. Unfortunately he was right.”
John was resolved to figure out why.
Watson glares at him again, “
I had to mean it,” he says defensively, eyes not raising as he prepares for John to mock him.
a trust-building bond if ever there was one, “he didn’t know. Sherlock had no idea I’m interested in men, much less that we’re a bit closer than usual friends.”
Watson merely rolls his eyes and asks legitimately, “And why is that?”
“Yes, but it needs to be.”
and a cuffing hug), and Mrs. Hudson (a quite impressive scream).
“What? She does?” He looks honestly thrown by that.
“Why?” I ask honestly.
Holmes is fascinated by this part because, much like most of this “episode” so far, this didn’t happen in their timeline. It’s very interesting, and he finds himself a bit disappointed not to have gotten to deal with it himself.
“Oh, I’m so sorry that I care about people unlike your cold machine of a heart,” he bites back defensively.
John kisses it, but then moves down - mouth open and breathing hot as his lips drag across the skin - to the spot along the tendon, just above the collar bone, that seems to have a direct connection to Sherlock’s cock when teased.
, but he can never seem to keep himself under control long enough. Oh, he’ll complete his map of each mark on Sherlock’s body, just a bit quicker on this plane of it. It helps that he doesn’t have as many on his back as the front.
– that I found it difficult to cope without my cold mask of deduction and indifference that I have spent so many years perfecting.
“Like you? Yeah,” Watson laughs.
“Agreed. Poor Sherlock and John,” he says with genuine pity.
With matching looks of confused trepidation, they turn back to the screen. This is, of course, all new to them as it didn’t happen in their timeline.
“Did you know you weren’t in your grandmother’s will
John brings his left hand up to run through Sherlock’s curls as his right runs over his back and side comfortingly. John is still incredibly turned on by the entire situation, but the cold from not being completely covered is making his erection wane. He desperately doesn’t want this to be over just yet.
“Ready?” John asks, still in a reassuring fashion that is so second-nature to the doctor. God, how he can genuinely care for others this much boggles Sherlock’s brilliant mind.
John opened his mouth wider and pushed more of his lover inside, controlling his breathing to ensure he didn’t choke or gag
“Well that was fun,” Watson says sarcastically with a smile.
Sherlock tilts his head in confusion. There’s something about the tone that implies a deeper meaning to the surface words.
“I was under the effects of veritaserum, you
Holmes shrugs, “I don’t know, an homage to easier times, perhaps?”
“But I
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock is taken aback by hearing his own words from so long ago parroted back at him, “Sherlock said that.”
“In two of your letters that you wrote to me while away, you inserted a comma in the middle of a phrase, and it changed the entire meaning. I need to know if it was intentional.”
their division?” Holmes asks snidely.
new person. You accepted that I was a bit odd and I accepted that you were a bit broken. Neither of us minded that the other wasn’t perfect; in fact, it only seemed to make it a bit easier.
“This is one of my favourites,” Mr. Holmes smiled, running a finger across the school portrait. Sherlock's features were obvious, although his hair was far more auburn than it currently was today, “Sherlock's first day at Saint Benedict's.”
“I do not insist on being mysterious,” comes the pompous, slightly offended reply from the doorway.
,” he says as he pulls him close again, “and sleep.”
“What the
Mycroft’s jaw clenches as his eyes flash with anger at the blatant attempt to manipulate him out of the flat.
My hand clenched harder and my teeth set. I could not speak, for I could not trust what types of words would come out of my mouth were I to open it.
Sherlock shook his head, nose barely brushing the other man’s, before surging forward to close all of the space between them. John chuckled as Sherlock’s nose came to rest against his neck, his arms wrapping tightly around his body to hug him yet closer.
“Probably all of them, knowing you,” Watson admits, fighting a blush, “but not least of which is that ultimately it’s
“Really? I found it rather interesting.”
“I think their main purpose was the same as ours was, fate just deemed it appropriate to bring them to this woman at the same time.”
His original, admittedly-not-very-thoroughly-thought-out plan was to stop touching himself when he heard Sherlock seeing to the fire, but he didn’t end up hearing that at all. What he
“But you’re different now; you’re successful and famous and respected across the country, even the world. You could show off!” John hinted, knowing how much Sherlock loved to show off.
John’s eyes narrow in challenge and he twists so Sherlock is now lying flat with John hovering slightly over him, “Yes, you are,” he insists sincerely, kissing a quick peck to the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, “You’re gorgeous like this.”
My eyes cast around the room for anywhere for my feet to lead me. My hopes rise when I see Janine wave to me, but my face falls again when I notice that she’s dancing with someone. My colleagues and Mrs. Hudson are dancing but…the old bat and Molly have always been too observant about my feelings for you and I can’t bring myself to face them at this moment.
it when John uses his few shortcomings for his own entertainment purposes.
“John, no! Stop stop stop,” he rambled frantically.
Back at the flat, after the murderer had been caught and arrested, John made tea and handed it to Sherlock who was clicking around on his laptop, occasionally humming, frowning, or grimacing at whatever he had found.
“Would you like to know what else I love to do?” There’s a mischievous glint in John’s eyes as he continues his circle towards the back of the chair again, almost like he knows something that Sherlock doesn’t, but that can’t be possible can it? A version of John that he created cannot know things that Sherlock himself does not. Without waiting for an answer, John leans down behind Sherlock to whisper in his right ear, “I love to think about you after. Think about how brilliant you are as I touch myself, alone in my room and wishing for you to catch me in the act. To deduce me with that brilliant brain of yours and realize just how long and very thoroughly I am yours.”
He picks up his phone and finds their old text conversation, opening it and typing the first words to him in a while.
“Minds like mine and his? He was attempting to seduce me with the puzzles.”
John leaned in and kissed Sherlock comfortingly. Sherlock was shocked by the act, anticipating that John would just go straight for his cock. This was another thing that he’d never properly experienced: a thorough, emotional kiss. Having John so close to him, kissing him like he
John steps away, making his way to the front room to grab a pen. He sits at the desk where he’s written so many of his blog entries that always barely concealed the true depths of his feelings for his best friend. He opens the journal to the last ten pages.
So we meet in secret and I act as though I don’t hate the fact that she makes you sneak around with me. You keep promising that things won’t be different when you’re married, but don’t you see? They already
“Are you honestly surprised by that? It was the easiest way to get up close,” Holmes reasons.
“What is your birthday?”
They watch quietly as things unfold, until Sherlock and John reach Van Coon’s residence.
“Sherlock?” he parrots back.
,” he reiterates, “So please, I know I’ve ruined everything, but I need you to lay with me. That’s all,” he promises.
“All ready, I just need to finish up these notes. Should be ready in about three minutes.”
“But he
“I wasn’t going to,” John said in disbelief as the car pulled up.
Holmes quirks one side of his mouth up a bit sadly, “You’re probably right. After all, I never did expect to be anyone’s best friend before you.”
The panel asks him about his involvement with the British Prime Minister and he claims not to have had any untoward dealings with him. When Magnussen looks at people, he sees bullet points of information about the person, including their pressure point.
Sherlock bit his bottom lip but nodded in understanding as he fell to his back, widening the space between his legs and taking a deep breath as John got into position. John smiled, stroking up and down Sherlock’s inner thigh before running his fingers up and down the crease of Sherlock’s buttocks, using his thumb and finger to spread the cheeks, looking at the small puckered hole beneath. John moaned, eyes closing as he bit his lip and chuckled darkly, “I don’t think this is going to last long.”
“No. Continue,” Sherlock said, although his voice was much more breathy and needy now, his eyes flickering constantly over John as he watched.
Sherlock has fewer freckles the further down his body one gets, most of them being centered on his neck and shoulders, but John finds them efficiently. One kiss to each: the inner left thigh midway between groin and knee, two in a diagonal line at the very base of his right calf muscle, one on the outer arch of his left foot, and finally one in the middle of his fourth toe on the right foot.
“Yes, Captain,” Sherlock laughed, nuzzling closer.
But something in his chest knows he’s been contemplating the same idea for awhile now.
“You can’t sleep on the floor in that position.”
“Is that all?”
A new topic is good. Is necessary.
“John,” Sherlock practically whined, “it’s not fair; I offered to help.”
Watson debates voicing his nagging fear aloud, but he knows that Holmes won’t judge him; may even be thinking the same thing, “That
Holmes shudders reflexively at the sound, a near Pavlovian response, “How obnoxious was his choice of ringtone?”
Holmes gives him a confused expression, “That
“And yet it does,” John pauses to smirk at Sherlock’s incredibly confused face before turning back to Bill, “he’ll take a glass of their finest scotch, if you would.”
But you chose her and I have only ever wanted you to be happy. That’s why I stayed with you at night when the nightmares would come. That’s why – when you asked me to be your best man – I pushed aside the gut-wrenching pain and helped the two of you plan the perfect day.
“Because it compliments my hand on your body,” he says simply, enjoying the way Sherlock’s eyes shoot back open at the statement. When their gazes have locked once more he adds, “And I’m the only one to have ever seen it.”
“Yes, let’s start there,” Sherlock agreed with a nod.
John always thought – when he dared to imagine it – that the transition from friends to lovers would come with a ridiculously high cost of emotion and humility. If he had known it would be this easy, he would have given in
more questions after that.”
“And then the one glistening tear,” Holmes says with pride, as though he just watched himself score a goal in football.
“Hmm,” Sherlock admitted with a grunt, his legs shaking and almost collapsing under him.
The screen flashes a newspaper article before zooming in on the front of a courthouse. Holmes and Watson spare another moment to admire the artfulness with which Moriarty assembled his footage, as though it were not someone’s real life.
John sees the trace of panic behind the falsely calm eyes and knows that something beyond Sherlock’s control is at work. He pushes aside the rush of joy at hearing those words coming from his friend whom he has been pretending not to have feelings for (because Sherlock has always proclaimed that dating is not his area) and brings his clinical side to the forefront.
John moaned deeply, his hips thrusting forward of their own accord as desire rushed through his body and straight to his cock.
“Oh, God,” Sherlock moaned instead, eyes unable to leave John’s.
“Those are great films, Holmes; classics,” Watson defends.
“At least I
“John,” Sherlock whispered, eyes closed as he shook his head in embarrassment, “I’m no longer fully erect.”
how you reacted!” Watson laughs.
“I’m sorry?” John asked after he had finished choking on the air he had been breathing.
Finally, something in Sherlock broke and he began stepping backwards, forgetting that he was on the steps, “John, I...I’m sorry, I didn’t…” he stammered before slipping backwards.
was married when this happened and had no reason to be jealous.”
Inspector Jones, for his part, did not appear to notice that neither of us were very receptive to his tone, so he continued on as though we were in on some joke with him, “From what I can figure, the two perverts left that bathhouse there,” he said while pointing to the nearby building, “probably after they engaged in their indecent behavior after having just met, and were murdered on the spot,” he finished speaking almost as though he believed they deserved to be killed.
“Sure sure, whatever you say,” Watson plays at forfeit and Holmes tuts in annoyance.
“What? Why?” John asks, a bit more awake than a few moments previous.
“Be back in a few hours!” John calls before exiting the flat.
Holmes used to go through these phases, too, but they have blessedly diminished in frequency over the years. They would drive Watson mad just the same as they appear to do John.
videotaping this,” he says, crossing his arms over his chest in a mix of anger and embarrassment.
“Probably naked,” he confirms, calm as ever, “or in a sheet,” he adds as an alternative option.
John took pity on him and raised his head to smile lovingly down at Sherlock’s face so he could see that he wasn’t being mocked, “I think you misunderstand me,” John started before leaning down to kiss Sherlock with clear intent, his hips moving in small circles and causing them both to shudder. He pulled back to finish the statement, “I love that you think of it that way.”
you might not be. I had a few friends I’d discuss ideas with, but the group was never that large.”
“Yeah it is,” he says through a chuckle.
“I still don’t understand how he could do that; give you up like that, his own
“Fine,
“Determination?” Watson offers, fixated on the scene.
“God, yes,” John whispers in agreement, “this Catholic service is taking forever.”
"The power is still out," John tells him, not surprised that he hasn't noticed.
Watson does honestly consider but can’t think of anything, so shrugs in defeat.
They look back down at the discs for a moment before Sherlock speaks up again, “So, shall we watch them, then?”
“What tone? It’s my normal tone,” he argues, forgetting a bit of his empathy from moments previous.
Holmes turns his head to study Watson, as though attempting to suss out his reason for asking before turning back to the screen and answering quietly, “Unfortunately, my brother is rarely wrong.”
Bill sits up again to continue to argue, “It’s not even his! It shouldn’t count.”
“Jesus, I had forgotten about that,” Watson laughs.
“John!” Sherlock gasped, his hand moving to grasp John’s wrist tightly, his hips bucking and his eyes rolling, “John! John, I think it’s happening!”
“Oh, but I am,” he assures, then steps a little closer, “and you know what I think?” Sherlock shakes his head, “I think you dressed us in closely matching blues on purpose; you
“What does that mean?” Sherlock asked, but John refused to answer him as he finished stepping out of the cloth.
“No idea,” Holmes lies, having a
“Watson…”
“Let me,” John begged as he began to undo Sherlock’s infuriating buttons one at a time, kissing the skin he exposed. John pushed him up against the hallway wall, so close to the bedroom they had both been aiming for, but now too far from it to care to try to close the distance.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Look, I’m sorry,” John composes himself, “it’s just that we’re meeting with the lawyer in an hour and were supposed to bring these back.”
Sherlock’s body took it upon itself to move things back into a direction it was more interested in by pressing their hips closer and increasing the pressure on his cock, causing them both to moan.
“So what are you doing here?” John asks.
“When you were asleep the night we got it. Very simple, don’t know why Mycroft even required our assistance.”
There’s a bit of a pause as Sherlock works up the courage to voice it, “Why did I never observe you dating any men?”
John runs off to finish out the West case as Sherlock presses Wenceslas for details of the beginning of the case. Sherlock shows up later to help John finish out Mycroft’s case. They break in to the suspect’s flat, point a gun at him when he enters, and drag the story from him. Nothing as interesting as Sherlock or John was hoping. Sherlock confiscates the thumb drive.
The story on the mini telly ends and Sherlock demands to get out of the cab, only to find that Moriarty was driving him the entire time. One of the international assassins pulls him from the street before he can be hit by a car, then is shot after shaking hands with him. John’s cab pulls up seconds later and he runs out.
“Probably shouldn’t just eat people’s come, Sherlock,” John grumbled, rubbing the back of his neck and watching his cock slowly soften.
John makes some odd exhaling sound that is neither an affirmative or negative, “In the morning. For now, come to bed.”
We both spent the years yearning for the other – you for me not to be dead, me for you not to be ignorant of my living – but with one significant,
And in that moment, Sherlock looked so incredibly like a sad, abandoned puppy that John couldn’t stay frustrated at the situation. The moment he decided to throw all caution to the wind and just
face specifically, with as much time as he spends looking at it. So he instinctively knows how delicate the situation is.
Beside him, Sherlock feels John tense in anger. It’s probably a good thing, Sherlock considers, that himself and Zach are on complete opposite ends of the table from one another. Sherlock’s hand tightens slightly on John’s thigh in reassurance.
Holmes nods in an understanding way, his eyes falling to the floor instead of his friend’s nervous ones. They make their way back to the sofa and resume the “show”.
“You’re not hard,” Sherlock stated, trying not to sound disappointed but failing.
“The real mystery is how they kept the plane from smelling atrocious,” Holmes points out, “Some of those people had been dead for quite some time, yet there was no strong scent of decay.”
Follow me on
A combination of the appearance of the first comma and my friend’s extended absence had my sleeping pattern imitating his own. I had barely slept in nearly a week and found myself pacing the flat in agitation when I heard the front door open. I ignored it, assuming that it was yet another potential client seeking the help of Sherlock Holmes, who was still absent. I was then, however, pleasantly surprised to hear Mrs. Hudson speak to the new arrival as none other than Holmes himself.
“Apparently,” he agrees quietly, “which helps explain it,” Watson looks at him quizzically, so he begrudgingly continues, “it’s difficult to describe succinctly, but it comes down to this: Sherlock Holmes’ life prior to John Watson dealt a lot with drug use, so, with John being swept away from him again, it probably felt natural for Sherlock to fall back in to his old routines pre-John.”
“There is proof - well guarded, mind you - of multiple dimensions existing at once, having branched off from each other at different points.”
begins to play. Flash over to the Bank of England and then Pentonville Prison – all three locations being shown at the same 11:00am. Back to Moriarty with the jewels; he clicks an app on his phone, seemingly setting off their alarm system and taking out a guard, leaving him alone in the room.
- but simply shrugs with a shake of his head.
“Will you keep wearing your posh shirts and trousers?” John inquires, his turn to ask the questions.
As they rut, they grow frustrated. It is a fantastic level of torture, but it’s not nearly enough for either man. John leads Sherlock’s body onto his back with his mere presence, and Sherlock follows willingly as he wraps his legs around John’s waist instinctively.
“I don’t remember any of that,” he practically whispers, not truly certain that he
John pressed the palm of his left hand to his heart, trying in vain to ease the ache. It’s interesting, isn’t it, how they call it heartache even though it radiates through your entire body? Like the sorrow enters your heart and gets pumped to your extremities along with your blood, until it permeates every cell within you.
Sherlock positions himself as he knows John will like. They’ve never done this thorough exploration of the marks on his body outside of their bed before, but Sherlock of course knows how best to aid John in the endeavor in this new location. His hands are braced on the back on the sofa, his knees spread comfortably wide so that John can fit close to him via the space between his feet.
“And what is it that you think you do?” Sherlock counters petulantly.
Sherlock’s eyes moved rapidly back and forth as he deduced, finally finding the answer, “Afghanistan,” he said in understanding, not even a question.
“John, what do you do for a living?”
“And Johnny
“Hmm,” Sherlock hums, eyes taking on a mischievous glint, “Looks like you’ll have to pick a new favorite, then.”
Watson’s eyes open and he turns to look at his best friend, his left hand twisting to grip the hand offered to him as an anchor, “I know. It’s not the pool that causes me distress, not really.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock said lowly, although he wasn't entirely sure which of the hundred reasons he was thanking John for, exactly.
When you’re ready to let me help you…
“Thank God we never went through that with
When we entered our flat upstairs, I could hold my anger in no longer. Before I really knew what I was doing, my left hand had punched a hole through the wall next to our sofa. Within what felt like seconds, Holmes’ elegant fingers of his left hand were wrapping around my tender fist, his right gently cradling my neck as he pulled the left side of my body to his front.
Sherlock buries his face in his hands, unaware how to cope with the information in front of him. He needs to research.
For half a minute they stand just like this, breathing in unison as they relish simply being close to one another. Then Sherlock’s face moves and John’s heart - just recently calmed by the lack of further movement - begins to race once more. Sherlock’s left hand comes up to rest on the side of John’s neck, his thumb moving lightly over a particularly sensitive spot just under his ear. John shudders and presses forward in to his body without thought, but God does he want this man. John’s left hand loosens its hold on Sherlock’s shirt, merely resting on his too-thin side instead.
“Sherlock still doesn’t understand John at all, does he?” Watson begins to rant emphatically, “There
good idea what they mean.
walking back through that door after so long.
Sherlock moans as John undulates above him, still too far away to actually feel him beyond the hands that grip his tightly. John throws his head back and bites his lower lip, possibly trying to control himself, though it seems impossible at the moment.
Both men turn to face Trixie with twin looks of shock on their faces. She blushes.
I am uncertain how long I simply stood stock still due to shock, but by the time I could force my body to move once more, I had convinced myself that it was a simple grammatical error. It meant nothing.
Holmes turns to place his right hand on Watson’s left shoulder, “God, Watson, I am
“Word it however is best,” John answers cautiously, looking down at their clasped hands and then up to Sherlock’s flushed face.
“I never had cause to,” Holmes assures him.
“I know, it’s just…” John finishes and moves to the sink, staring himself in the eye. The alcohol brings the confession from his mouth to one of his closest friends; going through a war with someone - now
“Yes there is, things have been disappearing and reappearing since the discovery.”
He sighs heavily just remembering it.
“Anorgasmia,” John mumbled, diagnosing Sherlock without thinking, “It’s when you can’t achieve orgasm by yourself. Usually due to personal issues or religious upbringings.”
From Sherlock’s bed in the dark room, the real John is wrestling with both of their bodies. Sherlock is practically frotting against him while he seemingly calls out to John on sinful moans, and John can’t quite bring himself to pull away from him as he rubs their hard cocks together.
“I understand that Sherlock has been...
“So what are they like?” Sherlock asks over his plate of mediocre ravioli. No Italian compares to Angelo’s anymore...except probably if they actually went to Italy. He’d have to find a case to take them there one of these days.
“Take it,” John was chanting, coming unhinged and mindless in his pleasure, “Take it, that’s it, so good. So clever. My detective.”
about sexual stimulus.”
John shakes his head tiredly, “No, not this time,” sometimes he does, depending on how emotionally upsetting the nightmare was; other times he simply wants to go back to sleep. He’s always nervous that he may slip right back in to the nightmare where he had escaped, but it has only actually happened a handful of times.
As soon as Sherlock had spoken, John’s attention had been drawn to him like a moth to a flame, but one look at the genius’ face of delighted rapture had his trousers feeling altogether too tight. Fearing that Sherlock would notice, John had made a bee-line for his bedroom.
sexual release, if not with someone else than of your own free will,” he states as logically as he can through the haze of alcohol. Following Sherlock’s scientific lead actually helps his own level of embarrassment come down to a more manageable level.
to mask his affection.
Holmes groans at the poor come-on, but it’s also tinged with the tiniest bit of interest as his traitorous cock agrees that it
“Doesn’t
“I love you,” Watson says intensely, locking eyes with the other man. It’s not a tender declaration: it’s proving a point.
“Marrying you myself is precisely the only thing I
John smirks as if flattered and Sherlock starts speaking seemingly before he even knows what he’s going to say.
“What is this?” Watson asks.
“John?” Sherlock whispered uncertainly near his left ear.
Sherlock is attempting to figure out how to get in to the safe, what the code might be, when the Americans enter the room and force John and Irene to the floor by gunpoint. The lead gunman tells Sherlock to open the safe, but he is insistent that he doesn’t know the code. He’s calm as he’s ever been until the gunman on John is told to shoot him on the count of three, then the panic sets in.
“Or that some of us no longer run around chasing after danger like you do,” Alan reasons with a knowing smile.
“Lestrade, I assume,” he answers his own question.
Sherlock’s eyes flash in anger as he literally moves forward and takes a deep breath in, ready to let the entire table know about the illicit history between Sally and Anderson. John quickly places his left hand on Sherlock’s lower right thigh below the table and leans in to him while whispering “Sherlock” in a warning tone.
“What do you
“Wait,” Watson says in confusion, as if hearing the words for the first time, “does that mean you weren’t going to try to escape until I got arrested, too?”
Watson lets go a laugh, “Only you would consider the 1800s easier times.”
“You’re right: you know him better than I do. All I can offer you is an outsider’s view that shows that I think you’re missing a key piece of the puzzle.”
"Go check Mrs. Hudson's flat for wood," John orders, but Sherlock turns away the key that John produces from his pocket. Mrs. Hudson has gone to visit her sister and she always leaves him (never Sherlock) with a key in case of emergency.
“I reiterate: you were going to lose me either way,” he reasserts gently, a deep sadness in his eyes and an aching feeling in his chest.
Sherlock turned sharply towards him, “Don’t,” he stated, but it was practically a plea, his eyes filled with turmoil, “Don’t say anything you don’t mean or that we can’t come back from.”
It was one of those days. One of those endless, monotonous days in which nothing interesting happened and Sherlock could feel his brain cells slowly turning to dust through lack of use. He had already used a considerable amount of energy to shout at the television - another lie detector show with an annoyingly prickly host - and now he lay on the sofa, his hands resting flatly on his stomach with his eyes closed, going through a cold case murder from 1926 he had filed away and forgotten.
"It's electronic - its battery will die."
Back to the beginning, then.
“Coincidence,” Holmes waves off.
“He always
Sherlock is washing his hands in the restroom when a female journalist comes in.
“Sherlock,” John whispered, lips just grazing the cock with the barest of touches.
Then there’s another ridiculous flashback to Sherlock’s jump from the roof that makes no sense.
As John removes his fingers and Sherlock senses him preparing to enter him, he stands swiftly. John looks confused and a bit worried for only a moment before Sherlock is kissing him and leading him to the floor.
A few hours later saw John full to the brim of heavenly homecooked food, and amazing scotch which Mr. Holmes had insisted on pouring for them. Sherlock was curled up on the small sofa, his toes buried under Mrs. Holmes’ legs as he read through her most recent thesis, making soft humming noises of agreement which made his mother smile.
“What, alpha males?” John asks with legitimate shock, but when Sherlock opens his mouth to explain
You let go, your hand dragging down my neck as you step back reluctantly. Your eyes hold a million thoughts and emotions, and it’s impossible for me to register all of them before they’re gone. Finally, unable to hold my gaze, you look down awkwardly.
“Does Sherlock Holmes need setting straight?” Watson asks honestly, but with a joking air. They haven’t broached the subject of his sexuality since their first visit to Angelo’s.
So when you asked me to be your best man, I had difficulty processing it. Had I done such a remarkable job of hiding my pain at losing you that you thought I’d be fine taking part in giving you away? But I must have. Instead of dwelling on that, my mind latched on to one smaller, more significant fact: you considered me to be your best friend and that? That would have to be enough. I have almost convinced myself that it is.
gay then?” Watson presses.
, John.”
Mycroft belittles him for succumbing to Irene’s charms, and Irene ignores Sherlock in favor for threatening Mycroft. They go back to Mycroft’s estate to barter. Mycroft attempts to find any way not to be under Irene’s thumb, but she’s done a fantastic job of getting him there in the first place, so it’s easy to keep the upper hand. That is, until she mentions her dalliances with Moriarty and mocks Sherlock for thinking that she could ever want him. From there, it’s a simple (egotistical) deduction of what’s in her heart: Sherlock himself. He unlocks the phone, hands it to Mycroft, and makes to walk out. Irene begs but to no avail.
“Don’t you want to know what I figured out?” Sherlock called to him in disappointment. Catching a lead on a case - even a cold one - is only as pleasing as John’s reaction to it. Without that, what’s the point?
"Get out of those clothes and into some warm, dry ones," John orders Sherlock, moving towards his own room to do the same while ignoring the indignant grunt he receives in reply.
