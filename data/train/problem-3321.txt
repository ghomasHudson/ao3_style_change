Castiel shook his head before resting it on Dean's shoulder. He liked this part of Dean coming home, where they both talked about their days, even if there wasn't a lot to tell. After years of lying or keeping things from each other, they could finally be open. "Not really, but I did go up there around noon to spend some time with Jack. He's coming down to earth for a visit pretty soon."
Sam laughed at the confusion. "Oh come on, heaven, hell and everything in between know it, do you really think your own brother hasn't realized?" He argued.
"You're good with people and cars, that's most of the job. You'll still be working on cars, so don't worry about that. But your eye for the product will mostly be useful when buying second hand cars, since we eventually want to start selling fixed up second hands. As for the people aspect, you'll be leading the team and handling customers who either have complaints or special wishes. How does that sound?"
"What about that one?" Jack asked, pointing at a slightly smaller, but fuller tree. Dean smiled, patting the shoulder. "You've got a good eye, kid. Go on, get it down." Dean encouraged him, handing him an axe from the back of the Impala.
"Imagine the pain of running your hand under hot water now." He said, now holding both of Dean's hands in his own. "I need a little time to warm you up gradually. Is that okay?" Castiel asked.
"Yeah, you know this thing." He motioned between them. The confusion on Cas's face told him he couldn't avoid talking about it anymore. "You, me... That whole thing... Your confession speech... Those uh.... Those things I prayed to you..." He could feel his face heat up and looked away. It was hard to acknowledge how he felt. Like he should be ashamed of the things he said in prayer. The things that for him were so clearly romantic, even if he had only used the word 'love' once.
When Castiel opened the door he was surprised to see it wasn't Marjorie standing outside. Sam and Eileen were stood in front of their door. There was a giddiness to them Castiel hadn't seen very often before. He greeted them, stepping aside so they could walk in.
"Yes." That had to be the obvious answer. Hadn't Cas even considered rescheduling? "Was cutting out the important people in our life really the first thing you could think of?" Castiel seemed dumbfounded, but Dean let the question hang in the air as he stuffed half a slice of pizza into his mouth.
Dean waited another moment, but Cas still wasn't getting up. Was that how it was going to be, really? "Good night," he returned, his voice as flat as Castiel's had been. On his way up, he glanced back over his shoulder. Castiel was looking at him now, not bothering to hide it when he saw Dean look back. Was Cas waiting for Dean to ask him to join. That wasn't happening, if Cas was being stubborn, Dean wouldn't be the first to give in.
He inhaled deeply once Cas reached him, realizing he had forgotten to breathe after seeing his soon to be husband walk towards him.
When the girl started asking questions about what Dean was looking for exactly, he realized he had no idea what he was looking for. It had been a spur of the moment decision to stop at the shop and get Bobby some decorations. He didn't even know Bobby would like it if he brought something. He briefly considered telling the girl he'd be back when a by now familiar voice kept him in place.
The ease with which Dean pulled Castiel closer when something exciting happened on screen still made him feel like butterflies fluttered in his stomach, but the sudden movement no longer made him fear Dean was pulling away. It was a constant reminder that this was their new life and they were allowed to enjoy it, without having to fight tooth and nail to defend it. Even if Dean's taste in movies was a bit outside of Castiel's taste, he could stay here with him forever, listening to Dean as he explained how they did the special effects that made some woman's head blow up.
On the way back Dean stopped by the shop again. He felt a bit nervous as he looked at it. He chalked it up on the fact that he had no idea what he was supposed to do. He considered taking flowers from the display outside, but figured that he might be better off asking for help, since he had set his mind on getting what ever it had been that the florist had described.
Dean smiled gratefully. If Cas wasn't happy with the idea, he would have declined. But even though he might not have been the most attentive partner in the last few months, Cas was still there for him. His one point of steadiness. He couldn't wait until the new location was up and running so he would have more time to spend with the other and show him how grateful he was for being able to rely on Cas.
When Dean made his way to the kitchen, Cas followed him wordlessly. Dean turned on the oven. "Jack seems to really be enjoying himself." Dean said as he looked over at Cas. Castiel nodded. "Yes this was a good plan." Castiel agreed. "I still don't get why you gave him the gloves. He's a nephilim, you know he can handle the cold."
"It's okay Cas, I get it. I didn't think they would be able to do this either," he muttered, not letting go of Castiel's hand. "But we'll figure it out, okay? I'll talk to the guys tomorrow and explain what happened. I'm sure they won't mind me leaving on time for once so we have the whole evening to work out what to do. Whatever we decide on, we'll get it done this weekend."
"I was called in today for a meeting with Levar," Dean told him straight away, wanting to get to the good part. "He offered me a promotion."
After Dean put a bacon wrapped hotdog on his spike he wrapped his free arm around Castiel as well as the meat roasted over the fire. "What did you do today? Did heaven need you?"
"Well, I think it'll easily hold two hundredth guests, but the higher ups think you guys might have to use both floors to fit everybody so it's best you guys check for yourselves."
Sam's face changed. He frowned and Dean tried to ignore how blatantly Sam was studying him. Then the expression softened, turning into a smile. There was something about the look that made Dean feel a blush coming up. "What?"
But tonight, he decided not to act on those fears and instead focus on what was real. And what was real was Cas sitting there, next to him, his arm clumsily around Dean after Dean rested his head against the others shoulders. The quiet of the moment and the dancing fire.
He would grab the beers in the kitchen and yell from there that Cas had been gone long, no matter how many days he had spend in heaven. Castiel sometimes wondered why Dean always waited until he was in another room, before saying something like that.
The night flew by in a haze of laughter and good food. Around midnight Sam and Eileen decided to call it a night. Around half an hour later, Jack got up as well. He told him he had to get back to heaven, But he would visit again someday soon. It was still hard to get away from heaven for an extended period of time, but he enjoyed the quick visit down.
"You need to sleep," Castiel assured Dean, playing with his hair like he did every night. "And I don't feel alone anymore."
Castiel didn't seem as excited as Dean felt, which was dissapointing. But if this house wasn't what Cas wanted, they had more than enough time to find something that suited both of them. "I mean, not that house in particular. But you know... It seems like an okay neighbourhood, and it's close to Sam and Eileen."
Dean still slept in the bunker during the project, so that was where Cas reappeared with pie after his visit upstairs. Dean just got out of the shower, cleaning of the days grime when the angel called him. Dean's grin widened, he had missed Cas more than he cared to admit, and he was excited to show him what he did with the place.
Dean squirmed away from the poke. "You won, I surrender. Pancakes it is." Those were the magic words to get her to move away, already heading for the door and the promise of Sunday morning breakfast. Castiel grinned as he let go of his wrist as well. Dean squinted at him, shaking his head despite the grin he couldn't hide. "The two of you are going to be the death of me." Before going downstairs, he walked over to Bobby's crib, picking the little guy up. "When you're older, you should be on my side instead."
Castiel quite enjoyed working on the house along side the other. Dean talked a bit more easy when his hands were busy laying tiles of fixing plumbing. Cas liked hearing him talk, there was a sort of hapiness in Dean's voice that used to be rare, but now was there almost every day. Dean also seemed to value Castiel's opinion on the house more than he expected, explaining his plans for each room and asking Cas what he thought or what he would want.
Dean bit his lip. "Uhm..." He let out in though. The man looked at him again and Dean could see the way his expression had changed, just by the pause in Dean's answers. He figured the guy was losing his patience and Dean was holding him from his work like this.
Castiel shook his head. In a swift and familiar motion, he revealed the blade he had hidden up his sleeve before he left. "Just a few drops right?"
Whe Dean returned with beer and plates for the pie, he asked Cas how he had been. They talked about heaven for a bit and Jack's efforts to resurect angels. Dean enjoyed those moment together so much, he almost forgot he made dinner plans with Sam and Eileen. When he realized he shot Sam a quick text saying he was on his way and he was taking Cas.
"I mean, he knows what he's doing, doesn't he? And it's his house as much as it's mine." Dean shrugged.
"I thought you were on a break." Dean noted and Sam rolled his eyes. "Yeah from classes, but I've still got a lot to do." He explained. Dean rolled his eyes. "A break is a break if you ask me, but you know, whatever floats your boat." He sighed, putting the pizza boxes on the table. Sam could only just pull away one of his notebooks before Dean got grease on it. At least he got the hint and cleared the kitchen table so they could eat. Dean grabbed both of them a beer before sitting down to eat. Sam smiled as he took a pizzaslice. "I might be the only person that actually eats healthier at college instead of at home." He noted and Dean couldn't help but note that Sammy still considered their apartment home.
"So Gabriel..." Dean started as he gestured to the couch. Gabriel took place, with Sam sitting down next to him. "Do I need to ask you what your intentions with my brother are?" He asked it as a joke, mainly to annoy Sam and see if he could make his boyfriend at least a bit uncomfortable. Gabriel smirked again, completely unfaced as he lifted an eyebrow at Dean. "I don't think you'd want to hear an honest answer to that."
"No dumdum," she rolled her eyes as a chuckle left her. "Have you seen the way those two look at each other? I'm surprised they aren't glued together right now. I'm just saying, your dad is looking great." The comment seemed to calm him a little as he smiled again.
"Yeah, it's hardly too early for that." Dean shrugged. "We've been living together since long before this thing started."
Jessica had brought Sam and Cas a coffee each. She tried to keep it together but she barely could. She barely noticed the way the people stared at her as she walked through the halls of the hospital in her wedding dress. She had too much to deal with to care about that. Her Sam was heartbroken and Cas and Dean, who really felt like family by now had been wounded, possibly deathly in the case of Dean.
Dean was grateful for the silence. He didn't want to spill it all, how he felt for Cas, or how much it meant for him to have that normal american apple pie life for once with someone he loved. He knew Cas knew, it didn't need to be said. He wanted to enjoy their time together. Instead he changed the subject, asking Cas about Jack and heaven.
Castiel gave Jack a hug before the other took his place next to the make shift altar. Jody granted them another moment of silence as Castiel took both of Dean's hands in his, receiving an encouraging squeeze. It was still hard to believe this was really happening, but he also didn't doubt it for a second. His happiness was to real for the rest of it to be fake. Once the music stopped Jody started speaking. "Friends, family, we are gathered here today to celebrate the official union of Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak."
"Doesn't he mind you coming up here and leaving him to finish your home?" He asked with a kind-hearted laugh.
Jack seemed to sit on that answer for a little while before he continued to his next question. "Okay, got it. And how does he know if I've been nice?"
Castiel looked the house over. It was weird to think Dean wouldn't go home with him.  "I guess I'll be heading back to the bunker."
"You...." Castiel was at a loss for words. He looked at the house briefly before finding Dean's eyes again. He looked so vunrable. "I didn't realize it was for both of us. You seemed so excited when we passed here, I wanted to be excited for you. I mean, when you didn't bring it up again, I figured you just didn't feel the way I did. I thought I had been clear." Apparently he had been at first. But it seemed like he took that certainty away. "I love you, I want a life you. I want to watch you grow old and spend an eternity with you in heaven afterwards." He made sure to say it in the plainest terms possible, so there was no posibility for Dean to misunderstand or doubt the meaning behind his words.
Eileen let Dean into the organized chaos of their home, with her soothing the crying Bobby while Sam was struggling to get Maura's hair in place. None of them looked the slightest bit ready, which was understandable, but it highlighted how long Dean still had to wait before he would see Cas walking down the isle and before they could start their life as husbands.
A look at Jody was enough to tell she had trouble keeping in tears as she spoke. "I now pronounce you husband and husband. You may kiss the groom."
The bridesmaids had apparently been there for hours already to help Eileen. Charlie and Eileen had grown really close after Dean introduced them. He missed her, and decided to pay a visit to her LARP campaign. They'd been best friends ever since and she often joined the group for dinner in between meetings. In this timeline, she had won the trust of her boss as well. But since he wasn't a Leviathan and he was just a decent person, he had given Charlie the reigns of the company after he retired.
The longer they stayed like that, the more Cas felt like he had to ask. When he looked at Dean again his eyes were closed and his chest was moving gently up and down with every breath. It could wait until the morning, or he could just blame Dean's actions on him being tired, and probably lonely after nearly three weeks on his own. He let the hunter sleep for now, watching over him as he did. Watching over Dean was as close as he could get to sleep. It was relaxing and it gave him time to empty his mind.
It was about three days later when Dean asked Castiel if he should make a bit. Castiel had hoped it would have taken Dean longer to make the actual ,ove, but it was true that he wasn't going to find a house like that in Sam's neighbourhood any time soon. He told the hunter it was a great a idea and tried to ignore the sting.
Dean had been drinking so Cas was the one that had to drive home after Sam and Jessica’s wedding. The wedding itself had been beautiful. They got married in a little chapel almost hidden in the woods. Their first dance had been magical and afterwards they pulled Dean and Cas both from the crowds. Jessica pulled Dean on the floor, knowing how much he hated dancing, Sam pulled Cas out, knowing how badly he wanted to dance with the reluctant Dean. In the end Dean even smiled as they waltzed as well as they could, Cas leaning his head on Dean’s shoulder and Dean pulling him just a little closer as if to say the rest of the world didn’t matter at that moment it was only them and Dean would always take care of him.
But this time he wouldn’t give in, he couldn’t. Not again. It had taken him so long to realize he was nothing more then a tool. And no matter how sincere Dean sounded, he wasn’t going to put himself through that. Not for Dean, not for anyone.
Once she calmed down a little she squeezed Dean's hand, the hint of a smile played on her face. "You best hold onto him while you can. Don't waste a moment." With her free hand she opened the locket she wore on a chain around her neck. Inside the locket was a picture of a kind looking man. "I lost my Cas almost a year ago."
"I've always loved it, but the flower shop makes it even more fun." The florist admitted. "In here I get to play around with all kind of seasonal decorations and flowers."
"Thank you. That means a lot. He's doing really well, but I fear he still needs guidance. I can't always be up here, not until there are enough angels to supply grace all at once."
When Jessica walked back Cas sat up right. “What did she say?” He asked. Jessica let out a sigh of relieve. “He survived the operation.” She told them with a small smile and both guys sounded relieved. Jess’s face tensed up again. “She also told me the chance on full recovery was small. He suffered some brain damage  and they don’t know how successful the operation was until he wakes up.” She told them, tears in her eyes. “But he’ll live.”
Dean nodded. "Yeah, you go get them." He told Jack. He could tell the other was as excited about Christmas as Dean had always been. Not for the presents, although Jack was certainly interested in the prospect of getting them, but because of the family foccus. Because they were really celebrating as a family for once.
"They were great Cas. I didn't know Dean could even step foot in a store like yours." Sam grinned. Dean could feel his cheeks burning up again, but he never the less tried to give Sam a look that meant shut up. Sam lifted an eyebrow with an amused smile.
Dean asked about heaven and Castiel told him that Jack had asked Bobby for help. Dean seemed to be reassured by it as much as Cas had. Dean listen to the stories with a gentle smile on his face. After the sun set the temperature lowered quickly. It did give a new dimension to the garden.
No one argued as they went to sit around the round table. Dean grabbed a bottle of Brandy from their supply. He grinned as he poured a shot into his mug. "Gotta keep traditions alive." He said. "Mom and dad loved a little Brandy for the flavour." He continued pouring a shot into every mug of hot choco except for Jacks. He stilled as if he considered his options.
"Open the box as well," Sam instructed them amused. His eyes were glued to Dean's expression as soon as he said it, so Dean gave him a small smile before opening it.
Those blue eyes looked at him, just as intensely as they had and Dean wondered if Sam knew enough about restraining orders to help Dean with the one that would surely be pressed against him. Castiel, the florist he had scared into giving Dean free stuff, just to get rid off him, was sitting at their table. A glance told Dean that Sam was as surprised as he was, though he didn't seem to mind Cas joining them. In fact he smiled at the other. "I didn't know you invited Cas." Sam told Gabriel as they made their way over. Gabriel grinned. "He loves this place. And since Dean apparently already knows him, I thought it would be fine." Gabriel gave Dean a smirk the other couldn't read. He was still focus on those words. Did Gabriel tell Cas that, that Dean had said he knew him? He wanted to fall through the floor, but since the earth wasn't merciful enough to burst open and swallow him whole, he made his way over reluctantly.
Sometimes Dean was amazed at how lucky he was. Castiel had told him all those things, everything that made him love Dean, but he didn't expect Dean to be that open in return. He allowed the love to be said only in prayer, and didn't expect him to say it straight to his face.
The next day when he drove past the shop the girl and Castiel were talking as they put the stock on the ground to display. When He got out of the car Castiel waved at him as soon as he saw him. Dean waved back, wondering what Castiel thought about the man that had never bought a single flower before and now came by every day for one thing or another, despite admitting he didn't even like Christmas decorations to begin with.
Castiel grinned, making his way back over to their bed next. "She can take a nap if she wants to." He slid under the blankets and put an arm around Dean, who instantly took the invitation to use him as a pillow again. There was a reason he never won these arguments and he was pretty sure Cas was well aware of what he was doing.
Castiel's eyes lit up again. "Right, then how about this little table top tree." He suggested as he handed Dean a box containing a fake 2 feet tall tree. "I know some people don't like the fake stuff, but with this, you don't have to water it and it won't make a mess." He explained.
Dean could feel those happy feelings spread inside him again. He had been working his ass off for nearly three weeks, but it was definitely worth it to get the reaction Cas gave. "Yeah you like it?" He asked again, as much to confirm as to just hear it again.
After looking around for a bit, Jack's eyes fell on a tree that reminded him of the one he had seen in a townsquare. "That's a nice one." He said with excitement as he pointed at the large tree. Dean shook his head. "I don't think we can put that one on baby." He told Jack as he put a hand on his shoulder. "Try again."
It was morning when the sunlight woke Dean up. He moved away to yawn and Castiel already missed having him close. The hunter didn't seem to mind the fact that Castiel had been looking over him. If anything, he seemed happy. "Sorry... I must have been more tired than I thought. You should have woken me up." Castiel couldn't help but notice the pink tint on Dean's cheeks as he looked into the hunters eyes. Dean looked right back at him, with a soft of unexpected warmth in his expression. "Did you just stay in one position all night?"
Sam gasped at the sudden overwhelming cold, but stood up with a grin nonetheless. He was just quick enough to shove his half formed snowball down the back of Dean's neck before he could get away.
"Dean Winchester, do you take Castiel Novak to be your lawfully wedded husband? Do you promise to uphold the vows you made before him and love him, comfort him, honor and keep him for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and health. To be faithful only to him so long as you both exist?"
Dean actually missed this a lot, just sitting and talking with his brother. He wasn't someone with a load of friends, he didn't really like most people. The only exceptions being Sam and Bobby, but that was family. Still when Sam moved away, half of his social circle was gone. It didn't cause him to much pain, but it made him appreciate these moments.
Apparently he was as skilled in suppressing emotions as he had hoped. He could feel Dean's eyes on him as he stared at the ground, willing himself not to cry.
Castiel looked doubtful, his eyes falling on a piece of paper next to him. Dean grabbed it from the table, ignoring how uncomfortable Cas looked as he did. It was a list of names, the guestlist Dean realized. Except more than half of the people were crossed off completely. The ones remaining were all marked with different colors. About twenty names were green; Sam and Eileen with their kids, Jody, Donna and the girls, Marjorie and a few other people they were very close to. A few more names were yellow, like some of Dean's co-workers, some of the angels Jack brought back like Gabriel and Balthazar and some hunters. The rest of the people were either crossed off or marked blue. "Cas, what is this?" He asked almost breathlessly. In the back of his mind he knew damn well why Castiel made the list.
"Thanks." Dean smiled softly, nestling in against Cas's chest. "Are you sure you don't want me to stay up with you? I can try if you don't want want to be up alone. Hell knows I've survived on less sleep."
"Don't sweat it. Just text me if Cas is on board to check it out tomorrow." With that, the other end when silent. Dean stared at his phone in disbelieve.
He had imagined the moment before, but he was sure he would feel regret and shame. He always thought he'd hate himself after kissing Cas, but that couldn't be less true. He finally felt happiness.
"So, you're not moving in together..?" Bobby repeated, like it was a foreign concept. "I thought the two of you were... Well, something." Bobby said, looking at Jack for back up. The nephlim looked a bit unsure how to respond.
"It's just excitement." Sam assured him. Bobby grinned as he cut in, hugging him as well. "Best be careful with those shaky hands boy, you don't want to mess up when signing 'I do'." Sam grinned. "I'll try not to."
“Hey Cas.” He said, moving another rock from the riverbank bouncing over the water. “I saw you sitting here all gloomy… Trouble in paradise?”
"Oh I want to show you around." He said with a grin before he looked at Cas. "Let's give him the tour."
Although Dean was usually very focused on physical pleasure, he didn't expect that out of Cas. He had only ever seen the angel be intimate as an act, or in human form. He had decided long before they even got together, in those sparse moments that he dared dream of something more, that if Cas didn't need the physical aspect or if he was uncomfortable with it, Dean could live without it. It meant a lot to know that if Dean couldn't speak his mind, Cas allowed him to keep it to prayer. To the outside it probably didn't even seem like anything between them changed.
"It's not. I really am happy" The realization hit him harder than he expected. Of course there were bad times, but he
After that last visit, Castiel needed to go up to heaven a lot less. He enjoyed the painting and decorating stage they were in now a lot. Dean seemed to think all colors with vaguely similar hues looked the same, so he had put Cas in charge of deciding on colors. When they were working on the upstairs, Cas and Eileen did the guest room while Sam and Dean worked on the master bedroom.
"Just, you know... That I felt the same. And like, I don't know man...." He was still struggling to say it, but he had to make Cas understand what this had meant to him. He couldn't look at the angel anymore as he continued. "I thought you meant the thing you told me in a different way. I messed up okay. I prayed to you that I wanted to get a house for us, and then we passed this and you told me to bring out an offer..."
"It felt like a long while." Dean answered softly. "I'm glad your back." He admitted before resting his head on Cas's shoulder.
Castiel let out an angry huff, his eyes like thunder as he turned around to face Gabriel. "Then leave." The command was short. He had wanted this for so long, he wasn't going to let their special moment be ruined by Gabriel. Gabriel seemed to notice the frustration, but looked uncertain about what to do.
Apparently Dean wasn't thinking big enough. "Were opening a new location and I want you to run it." Levar put it as bluntly as he could, which Dean appreciated. Because if he had dressed it up even a little, there was no way Dean would have reached that conclusion. He expected to be fired, not promoted.
Cas couldn’t even think about that ‘if’ without his eyes swelling up again. Through the wetness he saw two figures nearing him. He knew exactly who they were before even wiping their eyes to see them more clear. Poor Jess and Sam, still dressed in their wedding attire. Sam sat down next to Cas and clasped him tightly. They didn’t speak, but rejoiced in pain, while listening to Jess talk to the nurse. Apparently Dean was stable for now, but it all depended on how the surgery would go and on how fast he would wake up. She told her everyday longer it took Dean to wake after the surgery, the chance at full recovery decreased. Jessica nodded softly and thanked her. She turned to her new husband and his best friend. Shen put her hand on Sam’s shoulder and squeezed it for comfort. “I’m so sorry Sam.” She then turned to Cas, his head was split under the bandages, his arm was broken and he had about a million cuts, most of them covered by the hospital gown he was wearing. She had pity in her eyes. Cas kept quiet and so did she, but the genuine concern and pain in her eyes felt almost as comforting as Sam’s arm wrapped around him. They must have been told it was Cas’s fault.
Sam nodded. "Yeah well, he's had to cope with a lot. I uh... I wasn't myself after you died. I made a lot of mistakes Dean."
This would be perfect. The scene was right and Cas looked as enchanted as Dean had hoped. It also helped that he hadn't seen Cas in almost three weeks, so he suspected both of them could do with some time together.
“Yeah and if he hadn’t killed Belphegor, Rowena would still be alive.” Dean argued, his voice hard and loud.
Bobby had given Dean a weird look at first when he walked in with the tiny tree, but Dean just smirked. "I thought I'd bring a little holiday spirit." He explained.  Bobby just kept his eyes on Dean in a look that Dean knew meant 'Bullshit' so Dean turned away to give the tree a place on the counter and hang the very fitting ornaments. He had to admit it looked well on there. A small smile crept on his face, but he made sure Bobby couldn't see. He didn't know what made him so happy about that decoration, but he didn't mind the feeling. When he got to work he found himself staring at it every time he walked past the counter. It just worked in the setting. He found himself thinking about going back to the shop after his shift to that the florist, but he decided that would be weird. Castiel had just done his job. Besides he was planning on swinging by there tomorrow before work to pick up some lights for the tree. It would be better to thank him then.
About two months after Jack saved the angel, Castiel returned to the bunker like he usually did, with pie in hand. Their ritual started and Dean talked about a nest of vampires he had killed. Half way through the story Dean realized that he had made plans to go to Sam and Eileen's place for dinner. He sent his brother a text, apologizing for being late and informing him Cas was coming along.
"You.... I didn't realize it was for both of us. You seemed so excited when we passed here, I wanted to be excited for you. I mean, when you didn't bring it up again, I figured you just didn't feel the way I did. I though I had been clear. I love you, I want a life you. I want to watch you grow old and spend an eternity with you in heaven afterwards."
Gabriel look at him, a glint of mischief in his eyes. "It's tradition, isn't it." He said, quirking his eyebrows.
The kiss that followed pulled away the tension that had been building up. Although he relaxed against the other, Dean's hand was still shaking as Castiel put the ring on it. As soon as Dean traced the band with his finger, a warmth overtook him. It reminded him waking up in Cas's arms, of the way his angel followed bees around the garden and the patience with which he listened to Maura's questions. It brought back memories of their first night in the garden, their first kiss, their first dance at Sam and Eileen's wedding.
"No," Dean sighed. "I don't think there are any venues that can take us on such a short notice. If we want to keep the date, were probably going to have to size down a lot and hopefully find some other big venue to have a party in a few months."
"I like this one." He said showing Cas the angel, and seeing the other smile. The other didn't even look at the angel for more than a second before he looked back at Dean. Dean could feel those eyes boring into his soul, then slowly moving down staring at the others lips.
"What?" Cas hesitated, looking at Dean unsure. "Is that why you stopped? I thought I was the one that scared you off." Castiel admitted and Dean felt like Cas was looking right at his soul in search for his reaction. Dean chuckled softly. "I don't scare easily. Not even by obvious set up your brother organised here."
Sam and Eileen were excited to see Jack as well, both pulling them into hugs. When they all had a chance to catch up a little, Dean invited them to come to the garden so he could fire up the barbeque.
Gabriel gave a low whistle. "Bit short tempered  there, little brother?" He grinned but turned to walk out of the kitchen. "Don't forget the pie." He reminded them in an amused voice before walking out.
So I might add another update later today because I really want to get it finished before Christmas and I have to work a lot.
As soon as Dean got home, he was met with the smell of burgers frying in the pan. He hugged Castiel from behind and leaned in to kiss his cheek as the other flipped the meat. "How was your day?" He pulled back to set the table while Cas talked about babysitting Bobby and the walk they took. It was hard for Dean not to instantly tell Cas about Levar's offer, but he wanted to give Cas a chance to talk about his day, before Dean's news would take up the whole conversation.
"Well then, let's get straight to the point," Levar grinned as he gestured for Dean to walk into the office. "Come in, have a seat. I have a proposal for you."
They were excited, hugging Jack and asking him how he had been. Jack seemed to revel in being treated like a normal kid. It was like their son had come back from college all grown up, to be greeted by parants that missed him a lot. Once they had caught up a little, Dean asked them to all join in the garden so he could fire up the grill.
Dean's eyes filled with tears. "You mean all this time, you thought I just hadn't answered, hadn't even responded to what you told me, that you love me." He said, the crack in his voice as he repeated the words cut through Castiel.
Even if Dean wouldn't have been told that Maura was Sam's daughter, he would have know in an instant. Not only was she the spitting image of her father, she was just as curious and full of questions as Sam had been when they were growing up. That was one of the main reasons it was so hard to put Maura back to bed. Dreams would bring her more things to wonder about and she did not like to go back to sleep until all her questions were answered.
Jack's excitement reminded Dean of how much he liked it when dad took him to the Christmas Tree Farm, before Yellow Eyes stole every sense of normalcy he knew. It wasn't quite the same. This wasn't picking out the nicest tree among merry families, this was illegally stealing a tree from a forest. But still, he wanted this to be as magical for the boy as he himself once thought Christmas was. Castiel had been right, Jack deserved to be a kid for once, and they all deserved to celebrate the holidays as a family.
When he got back home, Sam was almost done decorating the tree. Dean smirked when he saw the effort Sam had obviously put in it. "Trying to impress someone?" He teased, knowing full well that Sam was in fact hoping to impress. His little brother rolled his eyes. "Shut up." Sam sighed, rolling his eyes. "I just want this place to look nice."
Castiel looked amazed, eyes wide and mouth agape. He turned to Dean, taking a second before he spoke. "This looks amazing. I didn't expect... This is great."
By the time they finished two snowmen, a large one by Dean, Cas and Jack and a smaller one by Sam and Gabriel, Dean's hands were freezing. He was to stubborn to just ask for his gloves back, but decided it might be best to go back inside. Just when he was about to suggest that, he could feel something his his side with a thud. He turned to see Gabriel laughing and to see Sam already holding a snowball of his own.
"I mean not that house in particular, but you know." Dean seemed to realize it was hard for Castiel to watch him leave, why else would he ask his opinion at all. Cas smiled, trying to look as supportive as possible as Dean continued. "It seems like an okay neighbourhood, and it's close to Sam and Eileen."
In all fairness, this was the Dean he fell in love with all those years ago. The one that became distant and cold when he felt like he was losing control. That hadn't been what made him fall in love, but it had always been included in the full package. A lot had changed since then, but they hadn't faced any real hardship in the past five years. Of course Dean would retreat back into himself, that had always been his way of coping when he felt like he was no longer in control. With a sigh, Castiel resigned himself to the idea that this was what he signed up for all along. It didn't change how much he loved Dean, but it was a bitter pill to swallow. After feeling like they were in it together for years, it was hard to face rock bottom alone.
Dean couldn't believe what he heard. His colleagues had always had his back, but this was more than he hoped to expect. The way Brian mentioned the other guys made Dean feel like the plan was a team effort. "That's... Thank you. That'd be amazing."
The kiss was more gentle than Sam had expected. He felt Gabriel's hand on his hips hand put his arms around Gabriel as well.
The switch was so sudden, Castiel had no idea what brought it on. He hadn't even told Dean about the phone call yet. Dean voiced his complaint in a low steady tone that made it clear he was holding back from shouting instead. "I hoped there would at least be food when I got home."
Castiel's eyes followed him until he closed the door behind him, leaving Castiel to stare at the house, wondering if this might be good for both of them and hoping he would still get to be a part of the brothers lifes, of Dean's life.
"I'd say he doesn't want me to die, but I'm guessing he just likes his peace and quiet up there." Dean joked, almost burning his hotdog after not paying full attention to it as he listened to Cas.
Castiel didn't want to spill the whole confesion and Dean's silence on the matter. He shrugged. "I guess Dean is moving on from the bunker and from hunting. He mentioned finding a job a few times."
"Morning again." Castiel greeted him. Dean smiled at him with his signature smirk. "Yeah yeah I know. I'm back." He laughed. "I just need some lights for that tree I bought yesterday."
Al though he had only just been there, he convinced Cas they had to visit the house. Cas didn't seem to thrilled when he agreed, but Dean was sure he would be. It was still light out, but dawn was close, so if he wanted Cas to see the changes in daylight they had to hurry. He had everything set up in advance, so all he had to do was drive them there.
"Great." Dean was returning more and more to his old mannerisms. A sarcastic smile plastered on his face and lifeless eyes that zeroed in on Cas. "So we might not even be able to get married? That is just great, Cas."
A pang of guilt hit Dean at the question. Of course he wasn't happy that they might not get married. But what was he supposed to do? Work had been hell and the only thing he wanted was to come home and relax a little before passing from exhaustion. But even that was too much to ask. He just fell from one problem into the next lately and honestly, he didn't have it in him to deal with yet another complication on their road back to happiness.
Castiel nodded. "I didn't want to wake you up. You seemed to need the sleep, and you know I don't mind watching over you."
"Dean. You know I love you, have loved you for so long. I know we don't need this, but I want to celebrate our love... Our happiness. I want to give you this ring, infused with my grace. It's as close to my being as you are to my heart. Will you marry me?" There was a tremble in Cas's voice that Dean barely registered over the rapid beating of his own heart.
"So, we all know you're not just here for coffee. What's got the two of you looking so happy?" Dean asked, squeezing Cas's shoulder as he talked about being happy.
It was great, seeing his closest family all sit around a table, sharing food and stories. In the past, he cherished those moments, because with the life they lived, everyone of those moments could be the last. It still could be of course, but the chance decreased dramatically now that they were no longer hunting. But Dean was done being scared about dying. He was ready for that day when it came and he had more than enough experience with dying. But living, really living, Dean was ready for some of that.
Sam was still smiling. "It's fine Dean. I'm happy for you guys." Sam said quickly, when Dean narrowed his eyes at his brother.
Gabriel grabbed him out of his thoughts as Sam he asked Sam's help to put a reef on his bedroom door. Sam looked at him confused. "Why do you need help with that, also aren't those supposed to go on front doors?" Sam asked, lifting an eyebrow. He knew Gabriel was up to something, he just hadn't figured out what yet.
After that last visit, Castiel needed to go up to heaven a lot less. Dean gas grateful for that. Now that they had started painting, Cas's help was much needed. Dean and Cas had gone to the store for paint where they found out that either Dean was slightly colorblind, or Cas could see different spectrums of light. Where Dean saw all vaguely or sometimes completely similar colors, Castiel would describe the differences between the swatches, matching them up and looking for combinations. Dean declared that Cas would officially be in charge of painting and decorating.
Sam's finger moved over the titanium as a smile played on his lips. "He's going to love it. Putting in the ring is the last step. Do you need help extracting your grace?"
Jack sighed. "Does all this stuff really matter? Sam made us wait for food until you guys got here, so can we eat now?" He said, looking at the feast Gabriel had conjured up hungrily. Cas sighed before smiling. "I guess it doesn't really matter for now." He agreed. "Let's eat."
"Well..." Gabriel started and Sam gave him another look and a shove, both completely ignored by Gabriel who seemed to be even happier to continue his story. "Despite Samshabam here being so great at ice-skating that he figured he could teach me, he managed to skate into the hot chocolate stand, landing face down on the other side of the counter." Gabriel cracked a wider smile, but Dean first looked Sam over to see if he could spot bruises or injuries before  laughing at the story. Gabriel seemed alright to Dean, as far as snobby rich guys go at least.
Jody addressed the crowd again. "You can join us in the next room to celebrate the union of Dean and Castiel Winchester."
The angel smiled against his lips. "I just figured you might like relaxing by the fire after the week you've had," He answered before kissing Dean back. The hand on Dean's side took away a days worth of muscle ache with a simple touch.
Claire smiled softly when she pulled back, tugging her hair behind her ear. "I'll go find Kaia and the rest, I'll see at the reception." With that she turned back to go to the main entry as Cas and Jack hid away in a room to the side until the ceremony started.
"He isn't mine, you know. She was pregnant when we met. I always tried to be a good father to him, a father like Bobby was too us."
"Can't let the first attempt be a failure right?" Dean tried, relieved to see a broad smiled spread across Cas's face. "If you want to come back to the apartment for some drinks that is."
Hair that wouldn't be as soft and malleable in a few hours. Not after Dean styled it with that pomade that made his hair smell of bourbon and oak. When they danced, that scent would fill him as he would rest his head on Dean's shoulder. Another glance at the clock told Castiel only two minutes had passed. This was torture. He had tried everything to make the time go by faster, but nothing worked.
The flash of blue light that followed was blinding. It took Castiel a second to recover from the shock before he dared to look into the bowl again. The ring was still there among dusty ashes. His grace was gone though. If everything went well, it should be absorbed into the ring. There was only one way to find out. He fished the ring out from in between the ashes. As soon as he moved a finger over the titanium band, the force of his own grace seeped through. "It worked," He told Sam, who was curiously eying the ring "Thank you." . When Castiel looked back at it, he noticed the blue hue on the titanium band where the light hit it. He put it back in the velvet box carefully.
Dean's eyes flew open, his shock almost masking the hurt in his eyes. "Maybe someday? Listen Cas, am I missing something here?"
Despite the silence, it was clear the words were getting through to Dean. His hold on the fridge door tightened enough to turn his knuckles white. After a deep, deliberate breath Dean finally spoke. "What? They suddenly don't do weddings anymore?"
He choked on his words, the silence surrounding him. He looked around the room, expecting the angel to listen, expecting it to be enough. But no flutter of wings, no wonky tie and no hand on his shoulder.
Dean dismissed the comment with a shake of his head. "That's different. This is hot chocolate for grown-ups. How about you get an extra marshmallow instead." He asked with an excited look. Jack didn't seem bothered by the difference, and looked at Dean enthusiastically as Dean plopped another Marshmallow into the drink.
"No, I do. It's amazing." Castiel assured him. Why was he being this upset. It wasn't fair to Dean who had worked so hard and seemed so proud. After a small pause, Castiel added "It's really a family home.". That's what this was all about after all.
Dean told Cas to hold on for a second so he could get changed, so they could go back to the house. As much as he loved working on the house, he was disappointed that they didn't adhere to their ritual. He was looking forward to telling Dean about Bobby and Jack, and how they were redesigning heaven. Dean told him it would be worth the drive so Cas gave in. As soon as Dean got dressed he led Castiel out to the car, seeming to burst with excitement. Castiel started to wonder what it was he was so happy about.
He could feel the silence grow tense as he waited for a response, but none came. This was it, he had made it too real and he was about to be punished with rejection. When he couldn't take it anymore and he just wanted Cas to get over it, he looked up. When he looked into the others eyes, he could see the other trying to figure out what to do next.
With Jack keeping heaven stable and the angels in control, the problems they faced were a lot easier to handle, but they made sure to visit Bobby, even if they were just assisting with minor cases.
"Are you coming too?" Dean's voice was small but hopeful and Castiel couldn't deny him even if he wanted too. But right now, there was nothing he wanted more than to just be close to Dean.
"I, uh..." Dean shook his head in disbelief, trying to find the words to explain Brian's offer while still trying to wrap his brain around them. "Apparently Brian had a talk with management. They're letting up use the garage for the wedding."
"I thought this was going to be the house for you and maybe someday a partner." Castiel admitted. Dean had never said anything about Castiel moving in, and cas still assumed Dean was going to go for an american pie family life, not to spend his whole life with a friend.
The sheets were cold and the bed was too big without Cas there. The last time he slept alone had been years ago, back when Castiel still had to go up to heaven for several days at a time. Even though it was hard for Dean to fall asleep alone, he never blamed Cas for going up there. Right now however, he was blaming him for staying downstairs. He stared at the ceiling, wondering how long it was going to take until Cas gave in and joined him in their bed. As exhausted as Dean was, he couldn't fall asleep again. With no distractions, all he could do was think. He grabbed Castiel's pillow when he could no longer resist the temptation and curled up around it, trying to pretend his angel was next to him. Cas was always close to him, even now his being was captured Dean's ring. Dean rubbed the titanium band, needing to feel the comfort and warmth that usually brought him. It didn't come. Did Cas know he was holding back his grace, was he doing it on purpose? This was the first time touching the ring didn't evoke a feeling of warmth and safety. Or at least Dean thought it was.
The difference between her and her dad was, Sammy only had Dean when they were growing up. Dean was a kid himself, with no idea or interest in how the world worked outside of hunting. Maura on the other hand had an ancient being with a philosophic outlook that didn't need to sleep and was more than happy to indulge her in all her questions. Even though she wasn't aware of what Cas really was, she had long figured out her uncle Castiel wouldn't try to tuck her in again right away if she woke up with a million new questions and ideas. Eileen's perseverance also wasn't lost on the little girl, she knew just how she was able to make things work out for her, no matter how young and small she was.
Through happy tears, Eileen told them she was 3 months in. "I already got a scan," she said before pulling an envelope out of her bag. "Do you want to meet your new niece or nephew?" Dean opened it up, seeing the echo showing a tiny new little life. "We didn't want to tell you guys until we were sure everything was good and healthy, but we had these made just in case." She explained, gesturing to the glasses. "We just got back from the hospital. They're healthy and growing at a normal rate." When she was done talking, her hands rested on her stomach.
Jack's eyes grew wide with panic as he looked at Dean, who sighed. "Don't worry. I'm playing nice." He assured the kid before glaring at Sam.
It took over an hour for Cas to get his senses back completely. When he was able to back away from the bed he walked over to the chair, dragging it over to the bed and having one more look at Dean before sitting down and grabbing Dean’s hand again.
When they got back to the bunker Dean helped Jack take the tree off of the car and down the stairs. Jack smiled. On the table of the entrance hall waited 5 steaming mugs of chocolate milk with a bag of marshmallows and a can of whipped cream. In the center of the table there was a big plate of Christmas cookies that Gabriel was already eating from.
After everything that had happened, it shouldn't have surprised Sam in the way that it did. He had no words, no comfort. He pulled Dean into a tight hug. "I wish we could do it all over, the whole thing the way we wanted, without Chuck pulling our strings."
Once Dean's pressure at work would die down a little and the new garage and dealership would open, maybe they could set some time apart and talk. Not just to plan the wedding, but to talk about what happened and how Dean's reaction made Cas feel. They were better at communicating than they had been at the start of their relationship, but it was easy to fall back into old habits when they were faced with all this stress. Dean turned into himself more when he was going through a hard time. That's why Castiel didn't take it personally that the other had stopped telling Castiel he loved him on a daily basis. He didn't need to hear it as long as he could feel it. But today, he couldn't even feel it. He had been feeling horrible ever since he had gotten that call. Although he had been nervous to tell Dean, he never imagined the other would make him feel worse.
He let himself be led outside, trusting the hunter to be his guide. When Dean removed his hands Castiel took it as a que to open his eyes. The sight that met him was astounding. They were halfway through the garden, on a stone path surrounded by the most beautiful array of flowers. The colors that met him almost distracted him from what was at the end of the path.
Before heading to the wash room, Dean grabbed the ring from his locker. The happiness in the grace still wasn't at full power, but Dean started to realize it hadn't been for some time. At least the spark was back now, some of Castiel's happiness had returned.
She didn't say a word, but the fact that she dropped her coffee was a clear indication of how she felt. Dean rocketed out of his chair, hurrying to clean up the spill before the hot liquid could trickle from the side of the table and burn the old woman. When Dean faced her, she was shaking staring blankly ahead as tears built up in her eyes. This was even worse than he imagined. But when he looked at her again he realized she didn't look appalled or disgusted. She looked genuinely hurt. It wasn't long before she started crying and as soon as Dean got closer to see what was wrong she reached out for him, clutching his hand in hers.
Beneath the table, Cas grabbed his hand and slowly stroked the back of it with his thumb . The touch grounded him as it always did. He looked over to his angel with a wide smile before looking back at the scan again. This was it, this kid would break the chain. They would be so loved, with two parents and two uncles that would keep them safe and give them the world. With God himself looking over them. No matter what would happen, they would never have to doubt they were loved.
"I just wanted to let you know, I killed another vampire nest today. Nothing I couldn't handle of course... It was almost boring in a way. Hunting... It ain't the same without you and Sam. I'm glad he quit, and I know you'll be back to join in a few days, hopefully..."
Cas was almost disappointed when Jack asked him to come back for a bigger project. Now that there were more angels that heaven could seep grace from, Castiel would probably be able to stay up there longer. Of course Cas went up to to help, he wanted to be there for Jack, for heaven itself. He was sad to leave for a longer period of time, especially now that the house was so close to being finished. Dean seemed just as disappointed to see Cas leave for more than a few days. It was to be expected. Cas had been helping him every single day he was there. It would really delay the progress to miss him for a few weeks.
"As for our future, we both know I'm going to screw up again and again, but I'll try to do better each time. I vow to spend the rest of my life loving you and showing you how much I do." He let go of one hand to take Cas's ring out of the box, covering it in his fist. "I used to have only one place that really felt like home. But now, I'm truly home when I'm with you." He showed Cas the ring before sliding it onto his shaking fingers. It was almost an exact copy of Dean's engagement and wedding ring.  The only different was the middle band. Where Dean's ring had grace infused titanium, the one made for Cas had tiny band of glass covering a strip of sheet metal that was dented, bend and polished to give a sparkling effect. Cas's eyes grew wide when he saw it and he let out an unsteady breath. Dean hadn't expected him to understand right away, but it seemed like he did.
The whole project took almost half a year, but it was finally finished. Dean still couldn't believe his life had taken such a turn. During the built, he hadn't gone on a single hunt. He wasn't planning on going back to hunting either, not unless he had to.
"Uncle Castiel," Maura started again, more certain this time, like she had decided on a topic. "Do you know if dreams continue when I wake up? I can only see them when I close my eyes for a
"What do you think about something like that?" Dean asked casually, trying to get a feel for Cas's tastes.
Cas could feel the guilt take hold of him again, he had been driving them back when in the depth of night, in the middle of the woods a dear crossed the road. Captivated by the headlights in its last moments before Cas hit the brakes hard, but despite his best efforts the collision couldn’t be avoided. From there on it was all a blur to Cas.
Dean listen to the stories with a gentle smile on his face. After the sun set the temperature lowered quickly. It did give a new dimension to the garden. Dean had added little lights throughout the flowers, linked to a sensor that switched them on after the sunset. Castiel looked at Dean, instead of the beauty before him. "You did all of this in the short time I was gone?" He asked. Dean nodded, moving a little closer.
Cas didn't, so Dean didn't stop until he fel the angels lips against his. Sweet and soft and everything he had never dared to imagine. Cas let go of Dean's hands to instead wrap his arms around Dean's neck.
"Okay, so which one of these is for the bedroom?" Sam asked, showing Dean the options Cas had sworn were different when they bought the paint.
"Yeah." Jack said as he looked up from his plate. Dean prepared himself for a question he was not willing to answer. "How long does the pie need to be in the oven."
Dean's eyes grew wide as Castiel walked through the door. "Cas." His voice was barely a whisper, but the angel responded, looking right into Dean's eyes.
"I do." The answer was quick and without a moment of hesitation. They slightly altered the traditional words, since they knew death wouldn't actually 'do them part'. When Dean died, Castiel would be right there in heaven to continue their existence together. After years of avoiding commitment, the idea of an actual eternity together hadn't frightened him at all, much to his own surprise. If anything, part him looked forward to being in heaven alongside Cas and everyone he loved. But only after a life well lived.
He wanted to be angry, to tell his brother that if this place wasn't good enough, he should just go spend his Christmas without Dean, but he didn't. Partly to avoid a big dramatic fight in which he would have to admit to Sam why he cared that much about the way Sam saw his place, but also because he knew it wasn't Sam's fault that he felt like that. Not really. He was just nervous about everything that might go wrong or that might change his image. A crappy apartment might really down sell him, even if he himself still loved the place.
"I don't know," Castiel answered again. This time it didn't sound as broken as it had last night. "You're home early. Is something wrong?"
Castiel looked at the way those lips turned upwards as Dean talked. There was a comfortable quiet falling over the room and Cas wished it wouldn't end. They were both taken out of their moment of quiet peace when they heard footsteps approaching from the hallway.
That didn't sound like he was in trouble, so that was good. Once they were seated on opposite sides of the desk, Levar pushed a small ring band towards Dean. "You must have noticed the steady increase in business over the last few months."
"Not our wedding." Saying the words was like twisting a knife that was already lodged deep inside his stomach. The call replayed through his mind for the hundredth time, but it was still as painful as it had been right after he put down the phone. The woman had been so bubbly and friendly as she explained what kind of celebrations would be allowed under the new management, before commenting that theirs wasn't, like it was an afterthought. Before Cas even realized what she was saying, she was already quoting clauses in the contract. He only realized what happened after she hung up, so he couldn't blame Dean for staying quiet and needing some time to process the news.
Dean had to stop himself from laughing. Castiel smiled. "He must be proud of you, putting up something like this at your age."
As a kid, Dean had liked that almost as much as he liked getting presents on Christmas morning. He was crushed when the first Christmas after Mary's death, John didn't even want to get a Christmas tree, let alone follow through with any other traditions he had enjoyed his whole short life.
Dean hadn't meant to fall asleep, but Cas didn't wake him up. He sat with him, holding him until the light of the sun woke Dean up. Dean let out a yawn as he moved away when he realized they had been there all night. "Sorry... I must have been more tired than I thought. You should have woken me up." He said with a gentle smile. "Did you you just stay in one position all night?"
Of course Castiel knew what rings she was talking about. A soft smile painted his face as he thought about his answer. "Did mommy and daddy tell you what those rings mean?"
Although he always explained they were going to be uncles instead, every time those questions came he started to wonder if they should look into adopting. Dean asked Cas how he felt about having or not having kids, trying to communicate more clearly with the man he loved after their big misunderstanding. They talked about whether having children was right for them, but in the end they decided against it. As amazing as it had been to raise Jack and to see Claire grow, they deserved some time for the two of them. In the end the agreed it would be nice to not be needed for once. Instead they were allowed to be the fun uncles that got to spoil their niece and nephew rotten.
When they got inside, Dean threw of his coat. Castiel couldn't help but notice the hunter was still shaking, the back of his shirt was covered in already melting snow crystals and his hands were a dark shade of red.
As Castiel made his way down the stairs and over to where Sam was sitting, he brushed his fingers over the railing of the stairs, the metal cold to the touch. Sam watched him with careful eyes, only looking away to add another ingredient into the grind of fine powder. Castiel wasn't sure what he put in, but it looked like some dried herb. "Still as skillful as ever." Cas commented as he looked at the fine mixture.
It took Dean a little time to get used to having someone in his bed again. Even more with that person being Cas. It wasn't so much that he was sleeping next to a man. After he believed they had been dating for months, he was comfortable with the idea that he loved Cas, male vessel and all. It was still hard to accept Cas not only loved him, but that he wouldn't leave Dean when the charm wore off. Sleeping next to Cas with the other awake made Dean more self-conscious than he expected. Last time it happened, in the garden, Dean wasn't even aware he was falling asleep, with comfort and exhaustion doing all the work. This time, it wasn't that easy. Cas had seen him battered and bruised, but that was another kind of unflattering and back then, in the heat of the fight, Dean hadn't cared how he looked.
Dean hadn't really prepared for this many questions. He was just hoping to spend one Christmas in a semi normal way as a family. "How about we listen to some Christmas music? That'll tell you everything."
Castiel looked at the house again. Dean had never really been one to care about the street view, so it had to be about something else. "It needs a lot of care, don't you think?" Castiel said, watching the hunters face as he did. He wasn't sure what sort of reaction Dean expected of him.
"Yeah..." Dean answered, wondering what els he could mean. "What did you think this was for? I'm not going to flip it. If it was all for money, I've got a few credit cards I can misuse more easily."
A grin spread across his face. He'd heard those words from angels and demons alike, using it to point out his weakness or trying to use it as an insult. All he could do back then was clench his jaw and try to ignore how painful it was to hear that those feelings that he shouldn't have in the first place would be used against him and Dean, even if the latter didn't realize. Now, hearing the same statement brought him joy. Especially when put so plainly and without malice. "That's also right. So maybe I should get uncle Dean a ring, huh?" It wasn't the first time he considered proposing, but he always found reasons not to.
"Since you said would it would take you some time to get back, I figured I might as well make use of that. Oh there's more. If you don't mind staying for a little. You can see the lights go on when the sun sets. I can start a fire, get a blanket maybe?"
Was Dean blaming him for this? That was one step too far. He couldn't go back to that time when Dean would blame him whenever things went wrong. How could he be angry when he didn't even seem to care about Cas's feelings or their wedding beyond the inconvenience.  Castiel's voice was icy as he stared up at Dean. "Is it?"
He had seen how Dean had acted around people he found attractive or that he considered as a potential partner. A hand on the shoulder or a clasp to the back usually didn't cut it. He had to face facts, Dean would go on with his life, finds someone he
"Thanks guys." He didn't want to be ungrateful, but a whiskey glass couldn't be the only reason they looked that excited. "Uhm... What is this about?"
Seeing Jack and Claire interact like that was always a delight. It meant a lot to Cas to have both Claire and Jack help him get ready for one of the most important days of his long life. Despite not calling Castiel her father, which he didn't think she should, Castiel did feel like they shared a similar bond. Which only strengthened when she met Jack and decided right away the then all powerful Nephilim and now all powerful god was definitely her little brother, and treated him accordingly.
When they appareard in Dean's new home, Castiel mimicked how Dean had surprised him. He stood behind Dean, covering Dean's eyes with his hands.
Dean looked at him bewildered again. "What do you mean that was all. I... Okay look, I'm not good at talking about this sort of stuff, that's why I kept it to prayer, but everything has changed. The touches...." Castiel was still replaying the last few months in his mind. They had been closer, but nothing that would be clasified as romantic as far as Castiel was aware. Except maybe that one night under the stars.
Dean nodded softly before swallowing. Without a word, he made his way over. Castiel was still sat in the chair, looking up at the man he loved as Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel and pressing him closer. Tears streamed from Castiel's eyes, wetting Dean's shirt as he clung to the other. Lips pressed against the top of his head before Dean let out a calming hush. "We'll figure it out Cas," Dean muttered against Castiel's hair. "I love you."
Rowena was one of the bridesmaids as well. She had just showed up one day and told the boys 'yes I know everything' and had been their helping witch since then. She trained Sam even further and she'd grown quite close with Eileen as well throughout all of it.
Dean didn't let go of Cas's hand as they walked upstairs. Cas took of his suit and joined Dean under the blankets. When Dean rested his head on Cas's chest, the angel realized he hadn't taken care of Dean's overworked muscles like he usually did. With a small bit of grace he healed his aches, along with the cuts and bruises that formed throughout the day.
Just looking at the paper filled table was overwhelming. Then again, everything was overwhelming right now. Wedding planning had seemed like fun, but Castiel started to understand why Eileen and Sam had hired a professional wedding planner when they got married. It hadn't seemed necessary for him and Dean, since they had a lot more free time to take care of stuff themselves. Sam and Eileen had both been working and raising Maura in the run up to their wedding. Since Castiel was home for the better part of the week and was only asked to babysit mornings, he figured there would be more than enough time to plan a modest wedding themselves.
"Of course you do, I've been talking." Castiel pointed out, wondering why Dean even brought that up. "I mean, guess who is with me as a surprise."
Orriginally, Dean had planned to start painting next. But now that he had some time without Cas, he wanted to use that to surprise him.
He put the angel on the counter before the florist got behind it again. "So you must be pretty into that Christmas crap?" Dean noted with a grin as he looked around the shop again. It was decked out with Christmas decorations, plants covered with glitter or fake snow and twinkling Christmas lights. The florist nodded. "Oh I love it. The lights, the songs..."
Two hands found Dean's wrists as Cas left him defenseless. Maura smiled wide as she countered by tickling Dean back. Castiel was such a traitor. "Alright enough," He conceded between fits of laugher. " I give up, please."
Cas was still at home, presumably Claire and Jack were there already to help him get ready. Dean couldn't wait until he saw him again. For now he spend his time getting ready at Sam and Eileen's, which meant helping with the kids before putting on his tux, rehearsing the vows he had written and listening to Sam tell him how proud he was.
The sound of the door opening grabbed his attention a few moments later. "Hey Cas," Dean's voice was empty, like it often was these days. There was a black grease stain on his cheek. His hands showed similar stains and the work overalls he hadn't bothered to change out of were patched brown with oil and grime. It must have been a particularly hard day at the garage if Dean didn't even take the time to clean up. And now Castiel had to add to that.
"Yeah..." Sam said in his normal awkward voice, trying to act more casual than he clearly felt about the flowers. "When we were done we went to meet Gabe's brother and apparently he had this waiting..." Sam explained, probably having caught Dean looking at the roses. Gabriel smirked proudly. "Don't pretend like you don't like them..." He told Sam who rolled his eyes at him. "You know I like them." He told Gabriel before turning back to Dean to add some context. "His brother is a florist. His shop is really close by actually."
As soon as Dean stepped into the house he called out for his angel. No response. Dean had a slight fear that Cas had been called back up to heaven at the last moment, but he was sure Cas would have let him know if that was the case. Maybe he was at his hive.  As soon as Dean went into the garden to check, he spotted him next to their fire pit instead. "What's this?" Dean asked on his way over, before greeting Cas with a kiss. Dusk was already falling, but the fire took away the chill of the early spring evening.
Before Dean and Jack had returned Gabriel had reiterated a few times he could make everything fully decorated with a single snap, but Sam and Cas had finally talked him out of that. He was still convinced that doing this by hand was basically a useless endeavor, until he saw Sam's eyes light up, just at opening the boxes. He pulled out a cord of fairy lights and held it up.
“What about what we lost?” Dean asked, raising his voice. Sam scoffed. “He has lost more.” He reminded Dean. “Heaven is empty, almost all his brothers and sisters died, his father tried to destroy the world and killed his son. And now you… We… We have abandoned him.” A knot twisted in his stomach as he realized he had done nothing to stop it. He had been so caught up in his fear and grief that he completely missed the riff forming between the brothers and the angel.
Cas went back up to heaven a lot. It usually took a few days, never more that two weeks at a time. He came back to recharge and spend some time with Dean. Dean had hoped Jack would come along, but he hadn't been able to leave heaven for even a moment since Chuck's powers were transferred. Dean tried not to dwell on it, and Cas had assured him Jack was doing well and he would visit as soon as he could.
Jack seemed to think about it. "Okay..." He said with doubt in his voice. "But does he think hunting monsters is nice?"
"My dad used to say that putting the light on was the most important task in the house." He told the kid as he tested them. "You see, it's the base of the whole decoration, so you have to do it right. We always used to start with that." The hunter continued to give strict instructions on how Jack should place the lights, where they should clip on to branches. When the lights were all placed he turned them on and smiled proudly, looking at Jack.
Dean tried to look away, but Sam could see how his eyes got red, a tear falling as Dean swallowed hard. The fact that Dean didn't even try to deny anything made Sam realize how bad he had it. "I've driven around for ages, but he's nowhere to be found." Dean admitted. "I thought he'd be around, you know. Apparently he's back from the empty. But he hasn't shown up. Maybe angels can't get here."
With trembling hands, Dean put the ring on Cas's finger, smiling as he met the others eyes. "I've thought a lot about what I wanted to do with this ring, how to make it more personal. There is one thing that represents the journey we've been on together best. Baby. There's a bit of her metal in the ring. It's as close as I can get to giving you a physical part of my heart and my soul."
"Oh sorry hello." He answered, a small blush painting his face. Dean held back a grin at how flustered the guy got for not noticing him before. "So, how did your brother like the angel?" He asked. Dean was somewhat surprised the other remembered him, but made sure not to show it.
As she continued describing how them being friends for so long only strengthened their relationship, Dean's hands started softly shaking while Cas tried to give him a reassuring smile, hoping Dean understood he agreed with Jody's words. Then she said something Castiel had tried to put into words before. "We don't get to choose who we fall in love with, and Castiel and Dean are a good example of how love sometimes sneaks up on us. But we do get to choose to love each other and there is no clearer example of that either. These two knew what they were choosing when they chose each other, most people can't truly say that. They knew the other as well as they knew themselves when they started on this journey together and it shows. So for all the jokes that will be made tonight about how oblivious they used to be, I'd like to highlight how that only strengthened their relationship once they finally realized. I'm still going to make the jokes. Come on, it took them 12 years, we can laugh about that, but it's with the knowledge that those 12 years formed such a strong basis that there is nothing that can ever break it." She paused, looking at Castiel and Dean as she opened the little box that had been in Bobby's wagon and tilted it towards Dean. Castiel hadn't seen his ring yet and Dean said he wanted to keep it a surprise. Even now, with the box tilted towards Dean, he still didn't know what his ring looked like.
He must have looked too deep in thought, since Sam walked off, guiding Gabriel to the couch to watch TV. Dean shook himself out of it and sat down, looking at the two. "So, any hilarious falls?" He asked with his standerd grin, trying to forget the conversation they had just had. Gabriel smirked and Sam shoved him in response. Something had happened, it was clear.
"I'll ask him." Her words were still quiet but her hands made up for that, finger jolting at her chest.
“And hell would be messed up. Cas did what he believed was best and you know he did it to save our world.”
Sam and Cas both walked into the recovery room. Dean’s bed was the only one of the three that was filled and they were thankful for that, since it meant they had some privacy with him. Cas walked forward first gasping at the sight of the love of his life broken and hurting in the hospital bed. He was slightly reminded of the time a bunch of his old friends had waited for him just outside of the school to beat him up. Sam had found him there, barely able to move, bruises and cuts all over his body. Dean had picked him and Sam up and brought them to Sam and Dean’s home. He got the first aid kid out and slowly but surely treated every cut while pressuring Cas for the names of everyone who had done this. All the people he named had gotten very obvious bruises in  the following week and Cas knew it had been Dean.
Castiel smiled, looking at the house again. "That is true. It looks like it has a nice garden as well. No you're right. I like it." Castiel told Dean with a nod. "Most houses here are kept up pretty well. If you want to work on the house yourself, it seems like this is the best choice."
They sat there for a bit, lazily talking about their days in heaven and at the garage as Dean finished both the hotdogs and the smores. After a few hours, Dean started yawning, snuggling closer to Castiel as if to get comfortable for the night. Castiel had been waiting for the right time to pop the question, but his nerves kept getting the better of him. Now it was almost too late. Moving as little as he could, he took the velvet box out of his pocket, clutching it tight. All he needed to do now was to get on one knee. Dean let out a whine when Cas moved away a little, holding him tighter in protest. "Come on, can't we stay a little longer?"
Dean was unsure what changed. He'd gotten off half an hour early to take care of this and now Brian was asking him to set those things aside and focus on work instead. Why would Cas even have to be there. "It's quite a busy weekend for both of us. Why?"
This home, moving in with Cas, It was all the start of a new, better chapter for the two of them, and that meant they had to celebrate. Dean had invited Sam and Eileen to come barbeque at the new place to celebrate. He enjoyed preparing the food in their new kitchen. Castiel walked in after making the bed with the new sheets he had picked out. Dean was about to ask if Cas would like to spend the first night in their bed as well, to watch over Dean, but before he could work up the courage the angel told him he had to go back up to heaven to take care of something. Dean's heart sank, until Cas assured him he would be back in time for the party.
"You're home sick?" Dean's question threw him off, wondering what he meant by it. "So what's your plan then, live here during the day and go back to the bunker at night?"
“That’s not what I mean.” Sam said, his eyes narrowing in on Dean. “He has lost everything, and you let him go on alone.”
When being in heaven and using his grace to keep it running took to much of a toll, Castiel told Jack and Bobby he needed to go back down. Bobby asked him to take a walk through the heaven they had created so far before he left. As soon as Jack was out of earshot, Bobby turned to him. "I just wanted to thank you, Cas. My boys were up against God himself, and if it weren't for you and the kid, it wasn't a battle they would have won. They'd both be in hell, and trust me, that ain't an easy ride."
All of a sudden, Dean's throat was dry. He had practiced this so often and still, it took him some time to calm his nerves and remember the words. "Cas, Castiel... When we first met I didn't trust you. I think I made that very clear." A small chuckle left Dean as he remembered their first encounter with walls clad in warding in a knife in Cas's chest. The sound of Cas's gentle laugh calmed his nerves enough to continue. "Maybe I was even right back then, at the very start, to be wary of you. But through the years, time and time again, you showed me what a good person is supposed to be like. You showed me how to become a better man myself. And even thought I didn't realize it for a very long time, it didn't take me very long to fall in love with you at all. With your crooked tie, goofy smile and complete lack of understanding every time I made a joke." He squeezed Castiel's hand as the other left out a throaty laugh that made his eyes light up through happy tears. Dean mirrored him, shaking his head as he remembered. "How could I not, when you were so kind and caring. So good in every way. I have never felt as happy as I've felt since we've gotten together. But if I think back to the time before that, most of my best moments have always been with you." By now, there was no way to stop the tears that were building up in his eyes, so he let them fall, his voice wavering as he continued.
Dean walked back out with a blanket and some matches. He grinned when he caught Cas staring at the building. "Can you believe it, it's almost finished. Just a few more weeks and it'll be ' bye bye bunker'." He grinned, as he lit some kindling. "I am going to miss that place, you know."
He finished the glass slowly, feeling Castiel's eyes on him as he stared at the golden brown liquid swirling in the glass between sips. The rumbling of his stomach was the only thing breaking the silence. Maybe it wasn't fair to expect Cas to cook for him day in day out, but he had done so for years so of course Dean was going to rely on it. The least he could have done was text Dean that he should order something before he left work or pick up something at the drive-through. It wasn't like Dean required to be greeted with a home cooked meal every day. But after a 12 hour day of intense physical labor and concentration, his body was demanding food in order to even think straight, let alone act on the information Cas dropped on him. At least the food would be there soon, he should be able to power through for now, even if it felt like that was all he had been doing for the past few months.
Castiel didn't seem to think about those differences, but instead pulled the same excited face he had when he picked an angel for Dean.  "I know just the thing." He told him before he headed inside, waiting for Dean to follow. When Dean stepped into the shop the other was already holding a box of tiny ornaments. All small cars in red and gold. "Do you have a Christmas tree at work?" He asked but Dean shook his head. "Not a lot of space for something big like that." He admitted, once again reminding himself how ridiculous it was that he was here to get Bobby unwanted Christmas decorations.
With a groan, Dean paused 'Witches of the seamonsters casket'. They were right at the scene where the iron maiden was about to get opened to expose the pierced headwitch covered in slimy green blood. There was no way they were going to miss that, it was easily the best part of the movie. Reluctantly, he moved away from his angel so they could get up to see who was at the door.
The velvet box was soft against Castiel's fingers as he reached for it in his coat pocket. It had taken him a lot of time, doubt and help from Sam and Charlie until he had finally found the perfect ring. It was only missing one last thing, something he would entrust to anyone except Sam. They had agreed to meet up in the men of letters bunker. When Castiel walked into their old home, a wave of nostalgia hit him. The old creaking door, the damp musky smell of old brinks and to finish the picture, Sam sitting at the large table in the entrance hall, grinding up something from a dusty jar in a large stone mortar. For just a moment, it was like nothing had changed, but in his hand he had the prove of how untrue that was.  A smile was all the two men needed to not only greet each other, but acknowledge the weight of being there again.
Castiel nodded slowly, eying Dean carefully. "They caught me off guard. I barely registered that she was canceling, let alone why..." He admitted. Dean lifted Cas's hand to his lips, pressing a kiss on the back of it. It was a tiny gesture but it meant so much.
"Thanks man." Dean smiled. So much could be said without saying anything really. He knew his colleagues had his back.
"You're home sick? So what's your plan than, live here during the day and go back to the bunker at night?" Dean had just hoped Cas would see this as a home straight away, that he didn't need the bunker as a back up to feel comfortable. It's not like Dean would notice it if Cas would leave when he was asleep, but it still didn't sit right with him.
He wasn't working on it alone of course. Whenever Sam and Eileen had time, they'd come to by to help on the house or bring Dean food. Cas had a chance to be on earth a little more as well now that the biggest damage done to heaven was restored. Dean enjoyed those days the most, where it was just the two of them, working side by side in a comfortable quiet or while talking about the plans for their home.
“I guess.” Was all Cas said, grateful not to be alone for now. Kevin nodded. “Yeah, you and Dean seemed tense, and not in the usual way.” He said. “What did he do?”
The girl giggled. Others always tried to put her to bed if she woke up in the middle of the night, but she figured out pretty quickly that Castiel didn't do that. Because he didn't need to sleep himself, he had a lot more patience. He had tried to make the conversations at night a little shorter after both Dean and Eileen told him Maura needed to get enough sleep or she would get grumpy the next day. Sam on the other hand seemed to be glad Castiel encouraged her questioning mind, citing some study or another about developmental stages and the impact on her critical thinking skills. Castiel just liked talking to his niece and listening to what her young mind came up with.
"Dean." He stepped closer, hoping to show Dean it was okay, that he was there. He put a head on Dean's cheek to try and get him to look at the angel.
Dean smiled at Cas as they drove towards the ceremony hall. It had been 12 years since Gabriel triggered the failsafe and their old lives seemed almost like a weird fever dream. It had taken some getting used too for the boys, especially when they first went to visit Bobby, the one that raised them. They had to keep reminding themselves that some shared memories weren't shared anymore. It was sad in a way, but they got the chance to make new memories.
"So what about you? Still going where the Whiskey takes you?" Sam asked, making Dean look up at him.
"I don't want to do this either Dean, but there aren't a lot of other options. This is my list. I want to ask you to make one as well so we can see who we really need to have there. I found a barn that can hold 70, but I still need to hear back from them. If we don't find anything, we can always have the wedding it in our garden, that'll hold about 20 people I think."
"Nothing wrong with pizza Sammy. It's got everything you need, there's even vegetables." He pointed out, making Sam huff out a laugh. "Tomato sauce doesn't count Dean." He pointed out and both of them chuckled.
"Oh no, I know couples kiss. I always kind of wondered why I hadn't seen it before, but some people want privacy right." He concluded. "If I'm honest." Jack continued. "I was more surprised about Sam and Gabriel kissing."
"Yeah...But that's just not the same..." He said as he got up once one of the larger blocks caught fire.
Cas laid it out so bluntly and Dean wished he had communicated like that, instead of hiding his feelings in prayer and taking Cas's smiles as confirmation.
The initial nerves of their new relation had worn off pretty quickly, and now that they had been living together for almost three months Castiel couldn't even imagine keeping his distance from Dean as they relaxed on the couch or not kissing Dean after the former hunter woke up. How had they spend so much time together, denying themselves this bliss.
The other smiled at that. "Always happy to help." He assured him. Dean nodded as a grin spread on his face. "That's good news, cause I'm gonna need that help again. Yesterday you were talking about a bouquet with Amaryllises or something like that... I don't know what to expect, but it sounded pretty good." He noticed the other trying not to laugh at his pronunciation and gave him an apologetic look. Still the other didn't correct him, but instead nodded in understanding.
"Yes, three drops of grace right into the bowl." Sam gesture to the mixture again. Castiel had considered becoming human more than once, but he couldn't abandon their child. Jack still needed his help and guidance in heaven and it was a lot harder for him to come down to earth without heaven spinning out of control. So Castiel couldn't just become human, no matter how much he would love to experience life as a human with Dean. After making a little cut in his neck he could feel the grace leaving his body, even parting with a few drops of it left him weak. Still, he had to will himself to pull back after the final drop hit the mixture. He held the cut closed until it healed, watching as Sam placed a hand over the bowl and chanted some spell before dropping in the ring.
"Yeah, you know... This thing." Dean motioned between them.  "You, me... That whole thing you confession speech... Those uh.... Those things I prayed to you..."
"Candy, Sam?" Dean said, lifting an eyebrow. "Or is it just cause there is no sugar in this fake one." He asked before he laughed at his own joke.
Sam lifted an eyebrow as he looked at Dean. "You've seen him around the flower shop?" Sam asked, putting an emphasis on the word flower. Dean crossed his arms, hoping the obvious blush had faded by now. "You don't know who I'm bringing flowers." He threw back, shutting him up for only a second. then he pointed at Dean with a knowing laugh. "So there is some sort of secret love you're getting flowers. I knew you were at the settling down stage by now."  Sam pointed out with a triumphant smirk.
Castiel slowly slid the familiar ring onto Dean's finger, feeling the warmth spread through both of them as Dean traced a finger over the grace. "With this ring I vow to be by your side and to spend every moment on heaven and earth as yours as you are mine."
He and Cas had talked about maybe having children when Eileen was pregnant with Maura. It wasn't really something Dean imagined as a possibility after getting together with Cas, but his neighbors seemed to do the thinking for him. Speculations grew as the couple prepared for the arrival of their niece. Anyone that came to their house could see the stack of parenting books Castiel was reading. On hot days, Dean had the garage door open as he worked on a crib he was preparing for when they babysat. More than once, a well meaning neighbor had asked them if they had a surrogate or if they were adopting.
This was different, vulnerable. What if he drooled on Cas or if he snored into his ear. Of course Cas wasn't going to leave him for being unattractive in his sleep, but what if he would? Dean had never felt this nervous about something he knew wouldn't happen, it was just hard to ignore that ever present feeling that told him he wouldn't be able to hold onto something good. That's why he was on the far left of the bed he had invited Cas into himself. Castiel stayed on the right side, calmly giving Dean time to adjust. At least he didn't ask if he should leave, but the question would come eventually if Dean kept looking so uncomfortable.
After they had written down all possibilities and had categorized the guestlist again, Dean's phone rang. With half an eye he checked to see who it was. "It's Brian, I need to take this real quick."
"Hello Maura." He greeted her as she successfully navigated her way down the final step. She climbed up on top of one of the kitchen chairs, silently watching as Castiel tested the formula on his wrist to make sure it wouldn't burn Bobby when he drank it. He gave Bobby the bottle before pulling out the chair next to Maura and turning it so they were facing each other. "You're up early." He grinned.
Castiel was okay with that, with having given his life in order to save his world, in order to save Dean.
“No use fighting over it now Sam, the dude has left, and he isn’t coming back. There’s nothing I can do to change that.”
He sighed, frustration ebbing away as the hurt took the overhand. He looked at the floor. "Well one of us is."
When Dean slowed down a little Castiel first thought they had arrived, but one look told him they weren't at Eileen's house yet. Castiel followed the hunters gaze, noticing the unkept house and overgrown front garden. "What do you think about something like that?"
They followed Gabriel, who had apparently taken care off the bill during the moment alone, out of the building. As the walked out Gabriel turned and held up a hand. Dean looked at him quizzically, but Gabriel just pointed upward.
Dean hated this, hated how he had allowed himself to feel happy about those sort of touches or about the smiles meant just for him. He had stopped forcing himself to ignore his feelings for months now. Even though he tried to hold on and push it all down, he felt defenceless against how real it felt to have Cas there. How good it felt to lean into that touch.
"It's probably Marjorie." Dean figured, unable to be too annoyed at her interrupting. The older woman that lived next to them often came by for some coffee during the day. Dean had a soft spot for her, and not just because she liked baking pie.
"What's that supposed to mean?" Dean asked, feeling like he should be offended. Sam shrugged. "Just wondering if you were were settling down a bit yet." Sam said, and Dean could tell Sam was trying to study his reaction. Dean just huffed. "Why would I? Relationships are nothing but trouble. As long as there are bars and pick up lines, I don't need someone to tie me down." Dean smirked, proud of his reply. Sam was less impressed, judging by his face. "Spoken like a true adult." He muttered and this time Dean was the one that kicked him.
Apparently Marjorie's husband, Casper, died around the same time Dean bought the house. She didn't really have a lot of people to talk too and it was still hard to be reminded of him. She apologized for dropping her coffee but Dean assured her it was fine, thinking back at how lost he had been every time he had to grief Castiel. Back then, he couldn't even stomach Sam mentioning his name without feeling like he was about to break down. So he stayed silent, holding her hand until she smiled through her tears. "Cas... Casper, he is probably looking down on me right now, telling me not to be so sad. But it's hard, you know."
"Moving on from hunting sure. That's good. But moving on from you..." Bobby shook his head. "He is going to regret that one, I tell you." Bobby sounded convinced, but Castiel knew the truth.
"Jack said we all get to pick an ornament we like for the tree." He said as he dug through the box. He landed on a beautifully made glass reindeer and turned to Sam, still grinning. He knew he was not only the reason Sam was blushing, but also why he was smiling, and he liked being the cause of that more than a little. He pretended to be comparing the ornament and Sam, holding it up next to him. "Not quite a moose, but a reindeer is close enough, I guess." He grinned.
Castiel could see the way Dean played with the fabric of his shirt. He seemed really proud of the garden and Castiel was touched that his opinion still seemed to matter to Dean. He nodded before exploring the garden some more as the hunter went inside.
"I thought it might." Levar grinned, motioning to the ring binder. "I've drafted up a contract I want you to look over. I'm not expecting an answer right now. If I were you I'd talk it over with your fiancé first. We are going to ask a big time investment on top of your regular shifts. You'll have to follow a management course for 6 Saturdays, plus study time. Brian told me you are getting married in a few months, in my experience that means a lot of planning. I'd understand if it's too much to focus on things like this on top of that, but if I'm honest I don't think this opportunity will come by again any time soon so I really want you to think and talk this through."
"How about you hold off on that for now?" Brian sounded almost amused as he suggested it. "Do you and Cas have time to come look at the new garage this weekend?"
Nights usually flew by for Castiel. Although he didn't sleep, he did consider the night to be a moment of rest. Most nights he listened to a podcast or an audiobook for a bit as Dean used him as a pillow, but some nights he just allowed himself to take in the moment. He could spend entire nights listening to the sound of Dean's breathing, honing in on the steady rise and fall of his chest and the touch of Dean's warm skin against his. As an ancient creature, eight hour didn't feel as long as it might to some, but in the trance like state he experienced those nights it felt like mere seconds.
Dean had decided to finish by going floor by floor. The first floor was finished. The walls were painted and most  of the furniture was placed. Sam had suggested to start with the bedroom so Dean could sleep there instead of heading back to the bunker each night, but Dean wanted the first night in their new house to be special. If he could get himself to ask Cas, he wanted Cas there with him in bed, watching over him. As dumb and creepy as the phrase had once sounded, it was nice now.
Dean could get used to having Gabriel around. Though it was still weird that he was Castiel's brother.  Then again, why would that guy remember him, really. He just went to the shop a few times. Even if it was creepy, it wasn't as bad as he had first told himself, Dean figured. And why would he meet the brother of his brother's boyfriend in the first place. Maybe if it got really serious in a few years time, but that was a long way away, and if Castiel hadn't forgot about Dean already, he would have by then. At least, that was Dean's hope.
Dean nodded. "Yeah... It's heaven alright." He responded, his voice harsher than Sam expected. Dean turned to look at his brother. "Welcome to eternity."
Dean wasn't sure who initiated their first kiss, he was too caught up in the moment to register who pressed in before those soft lips hit his. He also had no idea how long they stayed like that. Kissing softly as they held each other.
When Cas kissed him again and the stress in Dean let up, as he kissed Castiel back, soft af first, but then more passionately. It was a good 5 minutes more before they finally stopped so Dean could put the pie in the by now heated oven.
Dean encircled Cas's waist with one arm, the other finding its way to Cas's hair. When they broke apart he rested his foehead against Cas's. He couldn't see anything but those beautiful blue eyes.
Sam said a few words to his brother, how he wasn’t allowed to not pull through this. How he had to fight, how young he was and how much more he could do. If dean could actually hear it, he might not wake up just to spite Sam after that chick-flick moment. Sam just nodded softly before leaving the room. They had agreed he’d be back in 3 hours so he and Jess could change out of their wedding attire and Cas could sleep in the time Sam took over from him.
They drove away in the dark early morning, the snow still falling lightly, covering the world around them in a white blanket.
Castiel was so touched, not just by Dean's words, but by Dean's gesture. He knew how much Baby meant to Dean, and now he would always carry that with him.  "Dean," he took a deep breath, already feeling his voice wavering. "To stand here today, in front of all of these people to tell you how much I love you is a privilege I never expected to have. Love to me was a foreign concept to me for so long. It was something I never truly understood and never expected to feel anyway. Not until I met you, suddenly I cared about things and people. And then I realized I was in love. You made me see what a force love can be. And it was a force I couldn't fight, no matter how much I tried to fight it at the start. But there is no fighting the way I feel for you and even if there was I wouldn't want to fight it. If I start every morning by seeing your smile, I'll start every day happy. I love you Dean and I want to be with you always, in this life and the next. We've been through so much together, but I'm ready for so much more."
