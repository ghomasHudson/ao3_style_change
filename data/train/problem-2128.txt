"That's the problem." Atlas sighed as she looked to the ceiling. "Is it the poison?" She asked carefully after a while.
"Are you excited?" Atlas asked Rosie who eagerly nodded her head before plonking herself down on the floor. She scooted against Atlas' legs in request for her hair to be brushed. "One, two or three?"
"Hey," John said putting a hand to her back as she looked at him.
"It's always a bad outcome when you've been thinking."
"No, I know, Ida, I know," Mycroft continued. "How's about I read you something?" Atlas nodded before gathering herself back under the bedding of the bed. "Shall I sit here or-"
"That doesn't make enough. He doesn't pay you the normal rate and you haven't taken any of his cases in months." John frowned.
"I really am grateful." Sammy gave a weak smile as John looked over to him.
"I've already got it," Atlas said quickly. "CPTSD."
"She wasn't," Sherlock insisted, Atlas and Sammy linked to an arm each.
"Now, Miss Rosamund," Sherlock said affectionately as he took a seat next to her. "We got you something to try. But you can only have a little bit so your not high as a kite."
"Yeah...Okay." Atlas said looking at him sadly before beginning. "I wish I knew you the way dad did." She scuffed her foot. "I wish I knew what you were like because all the nice things you did when I was little...I can't remember them. Dad tells me you brought home flowers, but I can only remember you throwing the vase against the wall, painting it with water. I can remember dad, picking me up and hugging me...loving me. And I do, sometimes wonder what it might have been like. To have you as a mother. Because in reality I didn't have the
a new house.
"Sherlock, I'm not asking you to do that." John sighed looking at him, feeling overwhelmed.
"Please." Atlas smiled and then he was gone.
"Yeah." Atlas replied as she got up and pulled May by her hand until she was on her feet.
"I'm listening," Atlas said.
ATLAS felt remarkably lucky when she woke up. There, by her bedside, she saw her dads and Sammy and Rosie and she was attempting to smile. She was very much fixed in her bed, unable to move and her side was painful.
"I know, love." John whispered, Sherlock letting out a little sob in the small silence that follows. "I didn't like her." There was another little cry. "She offered me her number, but I gave it back." John rubbed his chest.
But then, Atlas supposed, she was getting a family out of it all.
"Yes. It's not that far." Sherlock smiled before John turned his face to him. Coming round, Sherlock opened the door and took John to stand infront of the house. Atlas had decided to go with Rosie and Rebeard to the park and meet up with Mycroft. They would see the house later. Carefully, Sherlock un-tied the scarf carefully and let it drop from John's eyes and putting back around his neck. John looked up at the house and blinked.
"Pa," Atlas whined before he walked towards her and hugged her himself.
"Yes." Sherlock frowned at her.
"I love you," Sammy whispered.
"Dad, you tried to fucking die!" She screamed at him, hot tears, pulling away from John.
SHERLOCK glanced down at his hand, where his ring was glinting under the sun. His fingers were linked in John's as they sat on white, metal chairs next to a white metal table. Around them, people milled about sharing laughter and smiles.
"Go ahead," Sherlock smiled. "On holiday?"
"Aw, just fuck off will you?" John asked, Jo looking at her husband before he sighed.
Atlas rolled her eyes before getting to her feet and removing her lab coat and goggles, hanging them up and putting them in the cubby below.
"Okay," Rosie said frowning more. "Can sparkles help? And unicorns? And...and...Jeff?" Rosie then started bustling about the room. "This book on...it's on fairies. You like fairies and...this one....it's on...the...hob-hobb-hobbit! You really like this one!" She placed everything in Atlas' lap. And then finally with one final harrumph pulled the weighted blanket off of Atlas' bed and helped John put it around her shoulders.
"Not Atlas' recipe. But yes, it's that recipe. It's my aunt's recipe. Would you like to help me make it?" John asked as he looked over to Sammy.
"I was thinking my jumper. The one papa gave me because it doesn't fit him anymore," Sammy said as Atlas grinned at him. "What? Why are you grinning?"
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Our wedding. I want us to marry, sooner rather than later." Sherlock said. "We keep putting it off so why don't we just do it tomorrow, take the girls out of school and nursery for the day and go to the registry office."
"He was ninety-four." Sherlock smiled.
"No, it's more than that. I need you to be alive.
He let out a shaky sob. "Sherlock," John said quietly. "Take a deep breath."
"I won't."
"Because I love them. All of them." Sammy sighed, looking at the wooden table.
DR FIONA HARPER:
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Peter? Are you alright? Are you OK?" Sherlock asked before he pulled him to standing. "Torches, we need torches!"
"SO, your the government." Eurus said quietly as they slipped down a pathway she was sure they had already been down.
"She...well...she died. We kept her in a facility and then she died. We...uhh...she committed suicide. We weren't expecting her to but she managed anyway." Mycroft answered as he began to mix some of the ingredients together. He was lying. She could tell by the way he was behaving, two bets she was alive and staying in his house. "What's your full name?"
"Christ Sherlock, you took it too far," John scolded as Sherlock looked at him. "You took it too bloody far as always." Sherlock turned and left then, just as Dr Aduba appeared with Dr Young.
"Does she like Hamilton?" John asked, rubbing her back up and down.
"I don't think so." John sighed, scratching his eyebrow before Wanda looked at him with a furrowed brow. "Atlas has a migraine, the end of it now. She was sick last night and Sherlock being the person he is hasn't moved from the chair in her bedroom."
John shuffles uncomfortably as Atlas felt her body being dragged into an awkward hug."You deserve to have Atlas because nobody else can ever carry that name the way you do. You deserve Ida and Elizabeth because your great grandparents are who they are and you can't choose them. As for your last name. You are not Holmes or Watson because you are a Watson-Holmes. The Holmes in you is smart enough to make Einstein and Turing quake in their graves. The Watson in you makes H. H. Holmes and any person who has ever committed a crime quake in their graves." There was a pause as John pulled out of the hug and put his hands either side of Atlas' face. "Okay?"
"I was just trying to protect him from it. He doesn't do well when I'm sad and I'm not sad it's just..." Atlas stopped throwing her hands around in the air.
"No," Atlas mumbled before she leaned against him. "Food."
Thirty seven minutes after class began she was back inside the room feeling like she was going to throw up.
"Rosie get off to school alright?" Sherlock asked.
"Georgia's room, I have something I want to collect," Sammy said as Sherlock followed him into the room which was purple walls and butterflies. "She wasn't like Rosie, but she has a few things that I think Rosie will like."
"I'll fill your hot water bottle up." John smiled before he put a hand to her shoulder.
"Do you know when papa gets home?" Atlas asked, eyeing him up and down before leaning against him.
Wanda left before John could add the little bit more to it.
"Yes, I know. You didn't." Atlas winked as they made their way inside the shop, picking up a basket and heading for the fruit and vegetables aisle.
"Dead." Sherlock simply stated as Mycroft peered over Mary-Anne's body. Meanwhile John was at Atlas' side checking her over, he was a war doctor. He could handle a bullet wound.
"And that even when she's at home, she's upset and sad and she's just not her," Sammy said quietly. "And it makes me so sad."
"Sherlock." John said sternly. They'd had a similar conversation the night before.
"Did you know that the Scottish government have been providing free period products in schools and colleges and universities for years?" Sammy said with a grin. "And they are about to roll it out permanently, everywhere. Provided in cafe's and restaurants. I always carry sanitary products in the little pocket on my rucksack because my whole life I have been friends with girls and its nice be there for them. It also happens they are running a poll through about making it known that bra twanging is actual a form or harassment and abuse and will be a legal reason to suspend a student. The offending student of course."
"Oh, so now your being responsible?" John exclaimed, holding his hand.
"Yes," Sherlock smiled.
"Why?" John asked warily as he slowly put the tea down on the coffee table. When it clinked against the glass Atlas sat down next to him with her knees drawn up to her chest. Then, leaned against him, her legs still neatly tucked.
"I'll come back some other time. I'll be at Books & Beans on Brubeck street until he wants to speak." Atlas announced before picking up her large backpack and satchel and leaving the room. Atlas darted down the stairs, brushing away tears as they threatened, then fell from her eyes.
"I'm not any good at hair," John provided and Rosie frowned.
"Okay. I'll make sure to bring it up to Dr Young the neuro-surgeon so she keeps that in mind while she checks you over." Dr Aduba smiles. "For now, I'll leave you in peace. Get some sleep."
"Box on the top shelf, in that cupboard," Isla said pointing to the cupboard, Sherlock opening and finding the box he needed. Taking it out he rifled through and found that he didn't quite rightly know exactly what it was he needed.
"Alright, papa?" Atlas grinned.
"I love you." Sherlock said quietly. "Just know that, please."
"Try not to ask him questions and pray to God my pa gets up soon." Atlas said into Sammy's ear, before starting off for her bedroom, not even having to tell Sherlock what she was off to do.
"Don't," John said. "It'll just make it worse. She needs to wait it out."
A kind doctor entered the room before handing her a small shot like shaped glass and letting her take her medication. He slowly increased her morphine dose, then he departed leaving the group in peace. Atlas attempted to stretch for her book but failed, causing herself some pain from moving. She resolved that she would have to wait until someone could hand it to her.
"Yes, it's Sammy." He said as he plonked himself down beside her. "I'm sorry, I should've kept an eye on you."
"Isla."
it's quite long and probably doesn't stop in the best place.
"Not to me, but I've seen it happening to other girls...and I've had the bra twanging thing done to me," Atlas said with a sad smile. "All the girls get it at some point in their lives, it's worst when it unclasps and you have to go to the toilets just to right it. Also not great when it's a girl doing it to a girl either."
And then he weeped. Hot tears streaming down his face as he started to laugh taking a seat on the end of bed seat.
John's hand absent mindedly stroked through the curls, brushing them off her forehead as she closed her eyes. Sherlock leaned back in the chair he was in and he too began to fall asleep. John watched, gently, before closing his eyes himself.
If you haven't already figured it out, I don't edit these.
"Was it too tight?" Sherlock asked bewildered, looking like a deer in headlights as he looked at her concerned.
"NO. I can't do that." John insisted, putting his hands out on the lunch table.
"We'll sort it, Atlas is old enough for a debit card and we can get you one too. It might be handy to also get you a credit card so you can start building credit." John said with a smile. "Pay for fuel and then pay it off."
Not edited.
"Speak to her," Dr Khris said.
"Right," Atlas signed. "Xerxes, you and me are going to start work on the batter whilst May, Sammy and Rosie can start looking out colourings, icing and other things. Baking cases too."
"Sherlock. I've been here for a three minutes and twenty two seconds." Atlas said as she crossed her arms. "I did say your name at least five times during the course of this time."
"A multitude of things." Atlas said as she walked along some stones. "I needed to clear my head and your the only person who will get me when my venting goes on a tangent." Sherlock gave a smirk which unsurprisingly Atlas reciprocated as she watched the dog wade into a rock pool. "There's obviously more but I'll get to that." Sherlock put an arm around her shoulder as they made their way up onto the path and continued along. He squeezed it and she looked at him smiling.
"She didn't have to." Sammy frowned before John just gave a smile and looked at him.
Knuckles white against the edge of the chest of drawers his head down. He squeezed his eyes shut and let out a shaky breath. The now not so ordinary mind was racing alongside his pulse and he felt like he was being strangled. He hated his dad. He
"So, are you two?" Jo asked. "The last time I checked you were just together."
And then he felt a presence. At the door.
"Hop in," Sherlock said poking his head out the window.
"Okay." Sherlock said as Rosie squeezed around the back of the sofa and tied it around his eyes. Launched into darkness Sherlock waited anxiously. Rosie walked over to the front door and opened it for Atlas to step through with Redbeard. Wanda and Timothy shared a knowing look as they entered.
"Stop." John said putting his hands either side of her face and kissing her forehead. "I should've asked you a lot sooner."
This is so bad. And the endings of my chapters are worse but considering I'm publishing this book all in one go, I personally didn't feel like it would matter too much.
EVERYONE had settled off to work within Rosewood Cottage, rooms being prepped for painting with various pieces of furniture out in the front garden and on the driveway ready for a little bit of refurbishing. Atlas was dotting around, dictating in appropriate places with Sherlock not too far away.
"Peter Pan," Sherlock said.
"Ida." Sherlock answered as he continued studying the file he was looking at. John gave him a pointed look causing him to look up. "Her name is Ida Atlas Elizabeth Holmes. I suppose she thought Ida and Elizabeth were too boring."
"I'm no good at formalities either." Sherlock replied still messaging on his phone and Atlas took that as yes, she could. She shuffled closer to Sherlock leaning her head against his shoulder which surprised him. Her mind suddenly became flooded with images of the strangled girl, the trafficked girl and she couldn't get them out of there head. Her throat clogged up and she felt a tear fall from her eye but she swiftly brushed it away. Another one fell and she hastily removed it before not being able to keep up.
Atlas sang, giggling as Sammy joined her for the next verse.
"We would like it if you would leave us alone." Sherlock said putting his hand out, the man's attention being caught by a security guard who knew Sherlock.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"I packed up my rucksack," Atlas smiled as she looked into the backseat. "Food and waterproofs are in there too."
"Now, your dad's are out in the hallway, but they've fallen asleep." The doctor smiled weakly.
"Thank you."
"How's about we all go change into some really comfortable clothing, get some walnuts or popcorn, put on fluffy socks, get some blankets and head over to the hospital?" Sherlock smiled. "Atlas is getting a little better but I think the most she'll be up to is watching a movie. We can all sit onto the bed and we'll watch something, yeah?" Rosie nodded with a frown growing ad she reached out an arm to her dad. Sherlock gathered her from John and held her a moment before they all went off to get the various things they required.
"That's not how adoption works," John said quietly. "Are you afraid I'm going to leave?"
"No," Sammy whispered. "But I have to."
"I love you too." Timothy smiled, rubbing her cheek before sitting in a seat. A moment later and Harry appeared, with her mum close on her heels.
"That was pretty good," John laughed and Atlas nodded before she looked up at him. She nodded before she smiled again.
"I'm not telling my dad or Rosie about it. So could you? You know." Atlas said, Mrs Hudson smiling before nodding allowing Atlas to go up the stairs. Sammy hot on her heels.
"She's the closest thing I've got to a mother. Aside your own, who is my mother-in-law but in my years of knowing her has become very important in my life." John smiled, Sherlock giving a little smile.
"Again, she's drowsy and we're going to need to monitor her for a wee while, but you should be okay to go back home soon," Dr Khris smiled before nodding and leaving.
He sauntered over to one of the guards who had come in with him. "Do you want me to stab you in the chest like this?" He shouted driving the knife into the chest of one of his guards. The other keeping his composure and remaining still. His eyes however, showed pain and fear. He knew he was next. Her other hand was now released, however, she appeared still tied. "Or slit your throat like this?" Mr Peterson asked as he dragged the knife across the mans throat once. There was nothing Atlas could have done for him and besides, that meant there were less bad guys to fight. He walked back towars her, his breath hot on her cheeks by the time he got up close. With one swift movement, knowing the wife was unlikely to stop her, she pinned him to the floor. Her fingers encased his throat and she pushed hard against it till she could almost feel his oesophagus closing.
"He-He-He-He..." Atlas tried to say again but she saw John just shake his head.
"I'm sorry Dr Watson. Our student, Atlas, sometimes forgets to be quiet." The teacher, Mrs Pertwee, said her gaze directed towards Atlas.
"Yeah, we've just finished the one about Aberfan. It made us cry," Atlas said with a frown.
Slowly, Atlas walked to John and wrapped her arms around his waist. Her temple on his shoulder.
"If your sure?" Mr Thomson asked.
"I know." Atlas nodded, tears falling again as she looked at John. "They aren't bad now, I didnt want to worry you."
"Don't say that too loudly." He laughed, pointing towards the spare bedroom. "It was my dad."
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"That's my pa." Atlas whispered in her ear, Aba's eyes going wide before she sat back in her seat. Exchanging a look with Sammy as the game began.
"Yeah, come here," John said opening his arms and letting Sammy nestle his nose gently against his neck. "God, why do you have to be so tall?"
"Ida Atlas Elizabeth Watson-Holmes, sit up," Sherlock said suddenly and Atlas sat upright like a young child being reprimanded. "Are you alright?" He asked in the wing mirror.
"I think I made the wrong choice." John explained sadly, knowing he didn't have to say much more for Atlas to know exactly what he meant by that.
"Don't be ashamed of me. Part of the appointment enclosed a mental health thing too because the seizures I had before were caused by stressful situations." Atlas frowned. "Here it goes...I have anxiety...like...quite bad..."
"Dad." Atlas scolded. "You can't sit in a chair for the rest of the night."
"I'm saying yes for nobody but them. I know what it's like to need somewhere to go after..." Atlas paused and swallowed thickly. "Abuse, as do you. So, I'm agreeing because I want to help. And largely because I love you and they're my family and I really like sharing a room with Ro."
"No. No, I can't." Atlas said.
"Do you want him?" Sherlock asked with a small smile, Atlas just nodded, her eyes welling up in tears.
"We saw, we're up from London seeing my family so we should be able to find a trainer," John said.
"Because I don't need to." Atlas explained as she put a bookmark in her book and put it on the side table. "Sherlock knows what I know, maybe more and you know yourself. I don't need to deduce and tell the whole room. I'm more content doing it and not telling anyone my conclusion. It's far more entertaining."
ATLAS WATSON-HOLMES:
"Sorry."
family. John was a doctor so unbelievably medically smart, Sherlock was just...well
"What time is it?" Atlas yawned as Mycroft lowered her onto the bed.
This chapter was originally written as a joint with the next one lol.
"Redbeard," Atlas said.
"Another good day of cases." Sherlock announced in his strangely upbeat manner of awkwardness.
"We know it does," John said before Sammy sat down on a chair with Rosie who eventually hopped off his lap before climbing quietly onto the bed next to Atlas and lying next to her. "Careful, sweetheart." John whispered.
"You can," John said as he stroked her cheek with his unplastered hand and she clamped a hand beside his ear.
"Don't be cheeky." Mrs Pertwee scolded, Atlas sitting back in her chair. "Not many people wear the name Holmes."
"Atlas always knows." John laughed, before frowning when he saw his partners face. It was sincere and quiet.

"The poison made it happen but we believe that whilst you two were out collecting something to eat from the cafe and having a momentary break, which is, by the way, completely understandable, she may have started hallucinating. Another symptom we were predicting may occur, and when it would occur, it would put stress on her body due to the severity of the hallucinations. However, we did not anticipate them to occur so soon or for Atlas, and please don't take this the wrong way, to be quite as clever about it as she was. In her head she may have been off somewhere else but her fight instinct was clever enough to switch off her monitors
"I'm afraid you'll have to tell me." Sherlock said after some time of trying to figure out why his eldest child wanted to walk with him.
Sherlock randomly appeared with two large teapots and cups, sugar and milk. Placing them on the table he shared a look with John before deciding that his bow needed more resin.
"If we oomph it up a little." Atlas said. "That's such a good idea Rosie! It could sound so cool."
This time, it was Mycroft. Good old, Uncle Mycroft. And she thought about his headaches that he had been cleverly hiding since the lodge - he'd had them then aswell. She hoped it wasn't serious. Mycroft was, to be frank, one of her favourite people. And it was an even bigger added bonus that Eurus was there too. A wonderful person contained in a tortured and troubled soul. But deep down, she was one of the most beautiful people Atlas had ever met.
"I'll take in a while if I still need some. I don't really like taking medicine." Atlas sighed as John rubbed his hand over her back.
Sherlock brushed it away as pointless mind witter when the forearm against his neck loosened.
"Oh, by the way." John said, not a moment or two later. "One of the new surgeries have offered me a GP position." Sherlock looked up at him, before nodding.
"I know," Sherlock said, a soft smile now spreading across his lips.
"Good. We're good friends."
"You'll curse it, Ida," Mycroft smiled but Atlas shook her head. "You will."
"Sherlock. I was thinking..."
"I've still got that headache," Atlas whispered after a bit of time.
"Hey," Atlas said after a moment.
"Cloud Atlas or The Book Thief." Atlas replied with determination. "Not only does one of the titles have my name in it but they are both good. The Book Thief is heartwarming however Cloud Atlas is incredibly philosophical."
"Ughhh," Sherlock sighed as he looked at her again.
"Sherlock?" A voice asked, causing him to whip around and look in the direction of the voice. "Thank god. It's only you." Relief flooded out with her speech as he slowly took a seat on the chair. It was very early on, after Atlas' first dead body that he first broke the physical boundaries of a socio-path. He'd touched and hugged both Mrs Hudson, John and Rosie several times but it still took years to get to this point. In a matter of months he'd knocked down his own walls, and little did he know but he had knocked down Atlas' aswell.
"I love you too." John said pulling away and putting his hands on either side of the teens face. "Now, go see your sister."
By the time they arrived it was around 10pm and Rosie had fallen asleep.
"And John, John was just giggling away," Sherlock said patting his thigh with a grin and dazzled eyes.
"Yeah?" He asked gently.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"I want to do something. And you need to do something for me." Sammy said, taking up her hands, her eyes constantly avoiding his own. "Either go live with Auntie Pol or go to a rehabilitation unit."
Both Sherlock and John looked at each other, not long after both receiving texts.
"See, you are a good dad," Sammy said as he looked at Atlas. "We've got you. We've got you."
"Our shampoo. We've run out." Atlas said quickly and dramatically, as if it was the worst thing in the world, which, was debatable at this current moment in time. And when Sherlock's head of curls finally appeared, she realised that he'd obviously made do and used Rosie's child shampoo. His hair was a mass of frizzy curls that he'd obviously tried to calm down with some water or mousse, but that hadn't worked.
"Sherlock," John whispered.
And Atlas bolted out the backdoor and threw up onto the grass. People watched, people were looking at her as she dry heaved before pulling back to the side of the house. Who was she? She was supposed to be able to handle things like this. She thought she could do it. She thought she could be
"She needed a laptop too." Sherlock said as John looked over to it. He smiled at the yellow bedding and curtains, bright colours laced throughout. Yellow cushions and striped cushions on the window seat.
"It's not that bad," Sherlock said.
"I really hope..." Atlas began as she filled the silence. She choked on her words, taking a deep breath before she could continue. "I really hope that you are going to wake up one day soon after a peaceful, restful night and say you remember me. I don't think that's going to happen though. I'm just going to have to work it out. Maybe I'll go stay with Mycroft for a while if your not...well not better when you get released home."
"What she said," Sherlock smiled back to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Bless," Isla whispered before she disappeared behind them and stuck the kettle on.
"And I'd make it so good for you too. And then I'd probably twist your neck." He said again, running a finger over her stitched again. He pushed with his index finger making Atlas gasp in pain. "Then do it all over again while your body was still warm." He grabbed her arm.
"Yes." The tall man replied, his eyes trained on the teabag. He sounded so small, like he wanted to curl up into a ball and stay there.
"Yeah, sorry, you should be asleep," Atlas said as she looked around the room.
A few moments later the linked pair achieved the bench by the stream. A teenage Sherlock could often be found here admiring the world or studying books upon books of random facts for his hard drive.
Atlas was now sat by his bedside while he slept. Alone. John and Rosie had gone to find food, insisting she have time with him.
"Whenever."
Disclaimer: I am a Scottish student in a Scottish school. Therefore my knowledge on schools in England is INCREDIBLY poor. Therefore I just want to say that I may not be the best at writing and understanding Atlas in school/college. I have researched but with the whole age thing...
"Dad," Atlas said again, before looking up at Sherlock, eyes shining with unshed tears.
"Go back into the kitchen." John said sternly, before looking at the man again. "Mycroft!" John shouted before the man scurried into the kitchen.
(I scribble a few down on some paper, Atlas seems intrigued, I believe she will follow through.)
"Whisky?" Mrs Hudson frowned. "Why'd you touch it?"
"Taking a photo because right now is a little bit happy," Sherlock said as he took another one just as the pair began to laugh again. "We need to capture it, I think."
When it finished it was to eager applause.
"Atlas. My name is Amy, I am from the family Court." The lady smiled and suddenly she came into view.
And that was when Sherlock appeared, alone. He moved to John's feet instantly.
"Since around three weeks after you arrived. You had enough of your proper medication to last you." Sherlock noted as Atlas nodded.
"It's alright Sherlock," John smiled. "It's going to be alright."
"Technically, you are," Atlas grumbled.
"Everything alright?" Timothy asked as Sammy nodded.
"And so unfortunately, people didn't really like your mother." John said before realising that saying to a five year old that her mother was not liked by people. "We had you, but you won't remember her. You were too little." John paused. "I wish you could have met her."
"John." Jo said warningly. "Your name is John Hamish Watson. Need I remind you that all of your fathers side are from various points in the highlands, from Ardnamurchan to Dunnet Head to Inverness to Aviemore." Jo laughed, which caused John to give a little smirk. Sherlock smiled as he learnt more of John's secretive history except for what he already knew: his father was once a drunk and abusive and that his father's side was 100% scottish.
"Excuse me, Rosie," John said as pulled Atlas into a seating position against the sofa, getting her to look at him again.
"Come on then," Sherlock said as he lifted her into his lap, her back to John, her feet on Sammy.  He kissed her temple as he pulled her to his chest and she rested there, not looking at the sky anymore.
"I'm not they," John said quietly. "I'm not leaving, for a start, I love your dad too much for that."
"Yes and thank you Mycroft!" John shouted back as the older of the brothers departed the house with a sigh and one last look inside.
"Nice to meet you." Atlas said as she approached Molly and shook her hand. There seemed to be an exchanged smile between the two and a lingering handshake.
"In the lab," John smiled.
"SO," Sally said, pouring some yellow into a tray ready for the roller.
"I love you too," John smiled down at her as she rested her head just below his chin, her eyes closing. She pulled the blanket a little further over so it rested over him aswell before his hand met hers.
"I want you to," Sammy whispered before Sherlock nodded and climbed the stairs, following him into his room.
"Oh. Mrs Hudson. You really didn't have to. I can get it myself you know." Atlas somewhat scolded as she took the tea and Mrs Hudson laughed before turning to leave.
"I'm not your sister. John doesn't want me. Nobody wants me!" Atlas shouted her voice hoarse as Rosie was knocked to the ground. She wailed, the sound not going unheard from downstairs. Sherlock and John making a speedy appearance as Rosie got to her feet and held her head, hot tears running down the young girls face. Atlas stayed where she was sat, her face blank. Nothing inside. Her brain was nothing, like Mrs Pertwee said. She was nothing.
"Yes," John said with a small smile before he kissed the crown of her head.
"What are we going to make?" Atlas asked her uncle inquisatively as he flicked through one of his many tattered recipe booklets.
WHEN Sherlock walked in with Harry and later John with Jo, Atlas was sitting on the cabinet chatting with Mycroft. They looked fully engaged on their conversation about the security service which, worryingly, Atlas appeared to know nearly everything about.
"'Course not." Sherlock smiled.
"No, not children," John said with a small smile. "A GP."
"But if-"
"If your sick again you can come and get us okay?" John said, Atlas nodding.
"I love you too." Atlas signed as she beckoned for him to come a little closer. He lay down next to her, his face opposite hers and she looked at him.
I don't write this.
"Oh, right, it's just, some people don-"
Then silence.
"Ah, Eddie! I expect your catching up with them all this evening?" Gordon smiled as the man nodded.
"We'll go home together." Sammy said before they made their way down to the car and hopped in. It was a short way from the memorial site but Atlas was glad of being in the comforf of something she knew.
"What the hell?" Peter exclaimed. "Sophie, since when did you have a vendetta against everyone within the LGBTQIA+ community?"
"Yeah, why not." John smiled as Sherlock got out some of the new wine glasses he had bought and then the denby plates he bought. "Atlas, you gonna help me with the dough?" John asked, Atlas nodded, got up and put on an apron before helping John knead the dough. He threw some flour on the kitchen bench, Atlas rubbing it in before managing to get it in her hair and on her face. Sherlock then came over to do some kneading, laughing as he too got some in his hair.
"No, finsihed two days ago," Atlas smiled at him.
"Oh, uhh, thank you," Sammy smiled before he took a seat on the sofa and tore the paper from the picture. Inside, was a painting of his mum and his sister and his dad on a picnic blanket in a garden of luscious green grass with wild flowers and bees and the blanket was covered in cakes. The sky was as blue as the flowers in the scene. He felt himself swallow around a lump in his throat as he watched tears fall on to the picture. "Thank you, Eurus."
"About Eurus. About how people used to treat you. It baffles me at how cruel people can be towards those who are smarter." Atlas explained easily, each word rolling off her tongue in semi anger. She was frustrated that people could behave like that, instead of embracing the smart they were envious. They would put them down to raise themselves higher on their self depreciation.
Earlier in the week Atlas had ordered a dog collar that was dark blue - note that it was infact the colour of Sherlock's scarf. In specific request she asked for it to come with a metal tag that had 'redbeard' engraved on it with who to call and where to find his owners. It was also around this time that Mycroft revealed that the dog was infact a large one and very similar to the one Sherlock had fantasised about having all his life.
"Okay," Sherlock said as he rested his cheek against her.
"John." Sherlock said again. "John."
And John exchanged a warm smile with his husband.
"Sammy." John sighed as Sammy ran over and stopped dead infront of them.
"I think it was the teenage daughter." She replied quickly handing it back, Sherlock nodding in agreement before he continued to type.
"Atlas, it's us," Sherlock said with a frown, reaching out a hand to touch her head but she pulled away.
"Alright," Sherlock said. "This has to sit a while before I can hoover it off, but we missed Gogglebox last night, shall we go catch it on ITV Player?"
nice." Sammy smiled.
"Atlas." John said quietly, a hand reaching to her shoulder but never making contact. It lingered a thoughtful moment before dropping back to his side.
"I don-" Atlas started again
"It depends...she could experience hallucinations, uncontrollable eye movements, seizures not caused by her condition, cardiac arrest, there is quite a long line. We don't know how the poison was been administered, how long and I know you can't help us with it. I respect that." He paused and looked around the room. "At the moment, it is recommended that we only have two people visiting her. Keep the stress down and from the information we have gathered, we think after a few days of being unconcious, it would be malpractice to now overwhelm her in any way."
"Greg." Atlas nodded as she grabbed a glass from the cupboard and downed a glass of water. She filled up another round and began to make her way to her room. Slowly.
"I'm not," Atlas said pulling away. "How can I be? How can I be, if all I can see when I'm not looking at someone I know, someone I love, I see monsters?" Her face screwed up as she sobbed through matts of hair that were tangled curls. "And that, that they keep talking. And I...I just want to go home. I want the monsters to all go away. I want them to..." She stopped before she looked up.
"Okay, okay, you can. She was sleeping but you know what she's like. At last count she was lying on her front, her stitches go around her back of course." John said quietly. "Jesus."
"Right miss, go find Atlas and make sure she isn't doing any work and if she is doing work, even if she isn't, you and Atlas can take the dog for a walk past the music shop." Sherlock said as he flashed a tenner before the five year olds eyes. It was swiftly becoming Atlas and Rosie's favourite past times as they enjoyed browsing sheet music, and then, together they would select one for Atlas or Sherlock or both to play whilst Rosie would dance around with John. Sherlock lifted Rosie off the stool as she dashed off to find her sister.
"O-okay." Atlas stuttered as they began to walk through the canteen. People shoved and pushed as Atlas clasped her hand against his and breathed in and out. She could see hundreds of people with hundreds of lives and she carried them like bricks for the wall on her back. When eventually they reached the queue Atlas saw the three teachers tables, where a handful were sat, quietly munching on their food.
"And Atlas?" Harry asked.
"Hey Sam," Atlas said gently as she crouched next to him, kneeling on the floor. She put her torch upright on the floor and looked at him kindly. "Hey, hey, what is it?"
"Papa." Atlas sobbed.
"Did you see anyone in the room last night?" Sherlock asked Atlas giving him a look as if to say 'if-I-had-I-would-have-said-so-last-night.' Atlas looked at Sherlock her face faltering slightly. All she could remember was a pale face of a man, still alive, planted. Or did he put himself there? She couldn't tell. As she got lost in her own mind Sherlock moved away from where he was standing.
"Oh."
"Atlas." John said before walking towards her. "Be careful." She nodded once before disappearing into the black of a door leaving John alone in the seperated room. He kicked the wall hard - exasaserbating a groan of pain - before shoving his hands in his pockets and looking toward the glass ceiling. And not before long the man had disappeared leaving nothing. Then the water started.
"I'll show you to your rooms." Timothy said as he progressed to show them all where they would be spending the next three nights. Rosie and Atlas were in a cosy room together, which Atlas didn't mind one bit. The house was larger than one may expect and seemed to exude happiness and rays of sunshine - Atlas pondered the thought that Timothy may have been the one to decorate the walls and choose the colours.
"Are you close with them all?" Isla asked with a smile.
"Fine. I'll send someone round to pick you up."
"Hey," Sherlock smiled before sitting back onto the bed with her.
"That's a long time driving, Papa," Atlas said quietly.
SMOOTH air brushed past John's face as he sat on a picnic bench with a takeaway from Books & Beans with his sister and mother. He was helping them house search or rather flat search. Unfortunately, he realised too late that Atlas' help on the matter would make it go faster and he had already promised that she could attend a society meeting tonight. Chuckling under his breath he remembered back to when she asked if she could attend it.
"Papa?" Atlas asked.
"Atlas?" John tried sitting on the floor next to her. "You in there?" A hand on her shoulder was shrugged off and she cowered. "Okay, we'll just sit a moment, yeah?"
The blow hit her nose with a powerful crunch, blood seeping from her nostrils. He was about to go in for another one when a frustrated Donovan pinned him and sat on his back. Atlas stood, her nose throbbing, watching the boy. She was watching him for more information. Ginger.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Lala." Atlas said, reading aloud the name of her cat before proceeding to move onto the details. Black and white, female - all the cats Mrs Hudson had selected were female and small. Small for a cat of her supposed age of four and a half. The next cat was "Babushka", tabby and younger. Two to be exact and looked like an absolute handful. But Mrs Hudson said she needed something to occupy her time with. Finally, "Jem" a female rag doll, seven, blue eyed and fluff, fluff,
"She has good days and she has bad days. She has days where she can breathe and days where she is choking on the air around us. Days where she hallucinates, days where everything is too real. Days where she goes through episodes of PTSD and days where she doesn't." Sherlock said, reciting it as if it were an old, worn poem that had started to fade in the light.
"I love you too," Sammy whispered before John could be heard calling from downstairs.
"At?" Rosie asked, adopting a new nickname.
"Probably," Atlas muttered before Sherlock kissed her forehead.
Eurus snapped her head up at her. "Really?"
"HELLO John dear." Wanda said as she fussed him the next afternoon. The rest of the night had gone fine, Atlas had not thrown up anymore and he'd slept relatively OK. That was completely different to that of his partner who had only come out the room for coffee and toast at lunchtime - despite his own and Atlas' insistence that she was perfectly fine. Infact the migraine was lifting already, and she was starting to feel a lot better.
After much crashing, banging and rudely inappropriate words from none other than Sherlock. A few wall scratches later and the duo had managed to get the piano upstairs. It was placed in the agreed location where Sherlock smiled. He'd have to move the location of his violin to put the piano there but he didn't care. Then they lifted the two plastic boxes of sheet music upstairs, stacking them up next to the sofa. John was left to carry the embroderied piano stool up the stairs whilst Sherlock spent a sneaky few minutes having a look ove the sheet music, finding several piano and violin duets - some written by Atlas and some written by others.
"And you," John said pointing at Atlas as she got out. "C'mere."
"Another heart attack." John replied and he felt Atlas began to shake in his arms. "Shh...shhh...I know....I know..." Sherlock sat on the bed opposite her and held her hands.
"Dad," Atlas groaned.
"Papa." She cried, Sherlock putting his book down and shuffling over towards his partner. Atlas remained at the door before entering and sitting on the bed. She then lay her torso on John's legs, curling up slightly.
Not a doctor.
Jo was taken aback a moment before smiling. "Your welcome, pumpkin." Sherlock looked at Jo with an appreciative smile before helping Atlas draw out the idea of how a murderer could conceal the murder weapon on a recent case, considering he had to get through airport security. "This looks interesting."
"Feel free to get out and stretch your legs," The Police officer said before disappearing and Atlas burst into tears.
"What'd you find?" Atlas asked quietly.
"I'm going to head upstairs, make sure they haven't killed each other." Molly said, before disappearing.
Hanging her head, still hyperventilating, she put her head down and began to shake.
Pulling in to the forest they all hopped out of the car, opened the boot and began walking along the forest track. Sammy and Atlas hanging near the back.
"Papa." Atlas frowned, looking at him critically. "Go home."
"She didn't mean it," Sherlock said again. "I used to say that about Mary-Anne and I held onto her and I tried to fix her..."
And everyone was
Atlas looked tongue tied so Sherlock stepped in. "Pain, tremors, fainting, the seizures...is that about it?"
Atlas looked at him with a frown before bursting into tears.
"Yeah, so a few weeks ago, my mum took Georgia to the doctors." Sammy sighed as they overtook some cars. "And they decided to test her for various things and the results came back negative. But today, she's going to the doctor's to find out the results of her most recent test..." Sammy let out a hot breath. "A test for lukemia."
"Now, Rosamund, how's about you show me these lights," Mycroft said, lifting her up as she nodded and put Jeff on top of his head and started talking to him.
"I know. He only smiles when he's really relaxed and comfortable with people. Either that or when he's drunk or high. And he hasn't been high since I moved in." Atlas smiled before taking a seat at the kitchen table.
John looked at him with a soft look. "I know Mycroft is looking into a cello for her, but I think your the best person to buy her a ukulele. If you give me your card thingy, I'll transfer you."
Sammy nodded. "It's the PTSD, isn't it?"
"I sure was," Isla smiled. "John, didn't tell you?" She asked pulling the table over to place the biscuits and drinks.
"Lorazepam," Kate said. "How long do her seizures normally last?"
"Why?"
Rosie however, got to her feet and whispered in Sammy's ear. "How do you say whale?" Rosie asked in his ear, her hands cupped over it. Sammy showed her, before the little girl did it to Xerxes which she then received a round of applause, or rather hands shaking in the air. She bowed before plopping down in Sammy's lap, munching on a home made cookie.
"Good." John said quietly, Atlas' breathing approaching some sense of normal. Her body still shook, tears still fell and her throat was still dry.
"I love you too, Ro," Atlas smiled. "I love you too."
"Well, yes," John smiled, wiping a tear that fell from his eye. "Always where your concerned because just like your father, every word, every sentence you say is beautiful."
"Papa!" Atlas shouted before reeling and looking at him.
"I love you too," John said before they got up and went to get the Xray.
"Do you like it?" Rosie asked, prodding Atlas' chest.
"It's not." Sherlock said quietly and Atlas shook her head.
"Just enough time for a round four then." John smirked.
"What if he wants to divorce me?" Sherlock asked as he looked at her. "I haven't told him before and then we got married...what's he going to think of me? That's the sort of thing you tell someone...right?"
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
SAMMY rested his chin on his folded arms with his eyes closed as they waited for their meal to be delivered to their table. They were at Books & Beans, by now their most favoured place to eat. He was staring at his drink of Diet Coke with a frown, clearly deep in thought. Rosie was sat next to John on the other side of the table.
"Behave." Mrs Hudson scolded whacking Sherlock with a tea towel, a laugh forming in Leannes throat. A smile on John's lips.
"Okay. We've been reccomended in recent weeks, as this is a developing condition, we have been reccomended to test siblings." Dr Young smiled. "Now, I would like to outline your treatment plan."
"I'm just really scared Sam," Atlas whispered as he put his hands either side of her face.
"Alright. I forgive you for whatever it is your apologising for. But if your apologising about this, don't you dare." John said rubbing with his thumbs. "Your allowed to be upset."
"Language," John scolded.
"Okay," Sherlock said before he nodded to John and Sammy in turn. John looked at her before they all began to move away, John nodding to his husband.
ready to take on a teenager seven years early."
Martha smiled before the three of them led her into the open space and they all sat on various items of furniture, each of them smiling. The warmth from the circular stove was flowing through them and Mrs Hudson sparked up conversation, Redbeard settling at her feet.
"Atlas-" Sherlock said again.
"I do too." Rosie squealed from where she appeared from the seating area with Mycroft.
"Why didn't you mention it?" John asked, reaching out a hand to gently rub at Atlas' knee. "We'd have helped." Atlas moved to the middle seat and looked at them.
"Have fun." Mycroft drawled as Eurus shot him a look that told him to shut the hell up. Mycroft sighed and rubbed his forehead before looking up to see his brother sat with his head on the armchair arm. It looked as if he was giving puppy dog eyes to John who sighed and put down his book and looked at Sherlock.
"Do they not brush it for you?" Sherlock asked quietly as he pulled it through again.
"Your...your a Holmes?" Lestrade asked, shock laced in his voice. Atlas rolled her eyes in response as two young children came running up behind him. A young blonde haired girl and a light brown haired girl came up behind him. The blonde girl looked about five and the other one around four.
"He's lost his memory Mycroft." Atlas said as she rubbed a hand over her face. Mycroft looked at her more curiously. "He doesn't remember me arriving in October."
ATLAS was out with Timothy when John's parents arrived promptly on the doorstep of 221B. They'd been out, trying to persuade the local publisher to publish his book and so Wanda, Rosie, John, Sherlock waited in trepidation for their return. Mrs Hudson was down in Cornwall checking on some new property she had just bought, whilst Mycroft was working to stop a plan similar to Guy Fawkes.
The sun was now rising faster than Atlas ever realised it could as they spoke more about their history. Their families. She learnt more about Sammy; how his mother worked at the primary school Rosie would be attending soon; that his biological father was not in fact the man in the car accident but someone else who he never knew; how he loved the man who died as a father; how he was expected to be attending the same sixth form college as Atlas. Atlas told him much about herself, something telling her he could be trusted. She was incredibly good at spotting liars, being able to do it effortlessly herself.
"Since I was one and a half," Atlas whispered, face neutral.
PULLING into the carpark, Atlas and Sherlock were both glad to see that it was quiet with only two other vehicles. He pulled into a spot and, hopping out, collected his boots. Atlas already had hers on, so pulling on a fleece, she collected her rucksack and let the dog out the boot who immediately went to Sherlock.
"What's Risto's?" Sammy asked as he looked to Atlas who smiled at him.
"Atlas." Another voice said as it entered. "You need to listen to me." It was Timothy and he was taking her shoulders and taking her to her bed. "You need to breathe. Your having a panic attack and you need to breathe."
"John told me about the seizures." Sherlock whispered softly as he bent down to Atlas' eye level and looked at what she was looking at.
"Your not insured to it," John said quickly before Sammy looked at the floor.
"Do you guys wanna head out of the city? I don't know, make a day of it? Go and explore somewhere. We can pick up sandwiches at the shop." Atlas suggested before looking over to Sammy who was smiling.
"You know your one of her favourite people right?" John said looking up at Mycroft with a gentle smile.
"I'm not feeling very good, pa," Atlas whispered, her stomach coiling.
"INSTRUMENTS," Sherlock said, clapping his hands together. "Line up, by the car in five minutes. John?...John?"
"Can everyone leave?"
"Your pretty damn cool." Sammy laughed as Atlas let out the breath she didn't realise she'd been keeping. "So how come you were in my unused bus stop?"
Atlas' shoulder was jostled by a girl going past and Atlas was suddenly gifted a waft of strong smelling perfume. To her right she heard someone throw up, the music blared and some lights flickered infront of her. Staying by the door she looked around and saw that none of the grouping were there and that they had all disappeared. All of them.
"How's your dad?" May asked. "Your papa I mean."
"Alright my rainbow." Leanne said, Sammy reeling back as she attempted to plant a loving kiss on his cheek. Finally he gave in before they could leave.
"Oh Sherlock. This is why I'm going to marry you." John said round a mouthful of pasta before he reached out a hand and clasped it in Sherlock's.
"Promise me something?" Kirsty asked as Atlas frowned, tears streaming down her face. "Don't you dare kill yourself."
"Losing my sight." Sherlock answered quietly. Atlas looked up at him before hugging him again.
As always,
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
In an air B&B.
"And how do you know all this?" John asked.
"Because," Amy started. "Because I saw just how ill you were and I saw how much comfort John or rather your papa brought you. And I thought, I'm going to do everything I can."
"It'll be okay." Atlas sighed pulling John's hand closer to her chest, along with Sherlock's. "I'm still scared though." She admitted. "And I really want a proper hug. But I want it tommorow morning when I wake up, instead of now."
"Eurus and Mycroft." Atlas sighed before she rested her head against his shoulder. "I love you."
Xerxes tapped Rosie's shoulder. "Your very pretty, Rosie. And is this Jeff, who you keep mentioning?"
"Dr Watson we can't al-"
And finally, there were a pair of feet. Boots, like the ones that John had said Harry used to wear.
Atlas shrugged her shoulders at that. "They normally do."
As another little note, often in Scotland you will have someone who turns 17 before another in the same year has turned 16 - so a 15 and 17 year old in the same class. This happens with all age groups and is to allow for people to attend school when they are ready to.
"Until what?" Harry asked from the gaggle of family.
"Me." Another voice said this time from the chair as Rosie looked up to Atlas.
"I don't know." Atlas said as John sat down opposite her and she looked at her in the eyes. "Experimenting with chords outside of the traditional I, IV, V, VI."
"Your father is one of and always will be one of the best and bravest men I know." Sherlock said taking Rosie's teary face between his hands as she sobbed. "Infact, he's maybe
"Let me help," John said and Sherlock shook his head. "I'm different to her mother."
"You know Atlas."
"Your the first girl who hasn't thought I'm trying to hit on them by taking them up here." Sammy laughed as he kicked at a stone with his shoe.
"Thank you so much for giving him the confidence to try."
"Alright," John said, sitting down to eat. "Atlas and Sam, it would be appreciated if you two would get a good night's sleep. It's 7 hours driving tommorow of which me and Sherlock are taking turns."
"Do we have any food?" Sherlock asked as they hit the motorway and Atlas rolled her eyes.
"We just watched through an episode of Game Of Thrones on catch up. Forcing your dad to watch it." John smirked putting the mugs into the sink. Atlas knew that both men had spotted the hot water bottle, that she had taken Ibuprofen - of course they knew this in different ways - and she sighed. Both men looked at her, expecting her to speak.
"Okay." She said quietly, lurching forward into Sherlock's embrace. "The Holmes aren't cold." The little girl stated quietly as she hung her arms around his neck.
"Exactly. And that means?" He asked again as Atlas just looked at him as he watched the cogs turning in her head.
"Leave them." Atlas interjected. "They spend too much time worrying about me."
"Would it help if we went and sat in the living room?" Sherlock asked.
"Yep," Atlas smiled before they all made their way out to the car.
"Okay," Sherlock said gently before he pulled Sammy out of the hug and put his hands either side of his face. "I love you."
"Christ Sherlock. I love you. I love you." John said before Sherlock snapped his head up to him and they hugged each other tightly.
"Are you awake sweetheart?" John said as he walked over to her bed and put the painkillers, medicine and water onto the sidetable.
"Would you like something to eat?" Mrs Hudson asked as she came into the room. "I have some mince and dumplings just cooked and I've made a little much." Atlas looked up and then to the clock and read it had gone seven. She often did that, get lost in a good book. "Sherlock messaged me to say they would be a while, she had to get an x-ray or something." Atlas nodded once before putting down her book and getting to her feet. "John messaged me with something similar, he seemed worried."
"Atlas," Ruben was trying, through the discussion. "Atlas, can you hear me?" Her eyes had gone blank.
"Ahh. Splean as in the Russian rock band." Sherlock said as himself and John entered the kitchen, John nodding in Mycroft's direction.
He forced a smile past strangers and forced a smile to the perfectly willing taxi driver who drove him to Mycrofts.
Go on. Kill me.
"Okay, Atlas, we're going to move you onto your side." Jen said kindly and Atlas nodded once. She was moved onto her shoulder and her legs rearranged neatly so she couldn't tumble. Fatigue began to seep into the edges of her vision and before long she was having a light shone in her eyes.
"Okay." Atlas said quietly before sagging against John's grip. He gently laid her down to lie before pulling up a seat and holding her hand, squeezing it gently. Sammy came to sit by him and rested his head against John's shoulder. "Sammy."
"Will you lot be going to prom?" Ruth asked and signed whilst Atlas sighed.
"Right yes, sorry." He paused. "Yes." He paused again, the words not coming into his mouth. The saliva in his mouth was running low on supply, the fears he'd been having for weeks ready to be displayed in front of this woman. "Yes, I've thought of it. More than once. I just don't know if she's ready, if
"I'm surprised your so upset." Mycroft said, Eurus elbowing him in the arm which he held in defence.
Again she fell asleep this time awakening alone as she groaned. This time she could feel the aching pain encompassing the side of her body where she was shot. She winced as she moved to get a better look around. To her left was he bed side table, she could make that out through her blurred vision. Just beyond that was a chair, one John had occupied moments later. She turned fully onto her side and she could now see that she was not alone.
JOHN ran a hand over his face as he entered the house at midnight. Sighing, he toed off his shoes and hung up his coat, dropping his bag in the lobby. As he entered the living room he saw Sherlock, bustling around the kitchen preparing a meal of tortellini for him in pyjamas. Just as John approached the breakfast bar, Sherlock swirled around and made up a bowl of tortellini with sauce and swiped infront of John.
"She hasn't got another tear has she?" Mycroft asked urgently.
"What Sherlock means to say is, we can drop you at a station or an airport, pay for your travel, look after your instruments, give you some food before you leave and we'll pick you up when you get back." John smiled.
