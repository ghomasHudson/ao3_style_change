“Alex Burson said; ’Oh, fucking hell, you fucking nosy posh
John frowned and listened carefully, but it became immediately obvious you really didn’t need to try to listen very
"What did you mean then?"
Greg selected his message recipient and started typing. “You c’n come and watch me one weekend though, if you like,” he said casually, as he did so, not looking at Mycroft and so missing his slight jerk of shock. Greg paused to check the brief typed message through for any spelling mistakes and pressed
you,” he said, directly in Mycroft’s ear, really emphasising the profanity, the words a hot spoken rush of physical desire. Used like that, in such a crude manner, the word should have been horribly coarse and vulgar and offensive to Mycroft, but
Sherlock said something else about the practicalities of using boiled linseed oil and she started to laugh. Like her voice, her laugh was rusty - it didn’t sound like it got used very much.
"Oh, right? What?" he said easily, all interested.
"When you were shot in Afghanistan, did you scream or were you silent?"
on it in large blue letters. “I like to cook with wine…” Siger said mysteriously, but with such a grin that John could tell there was a punchline coming. “Go over and see that postcard from Sicily, John…” he directed, nodding his head at it again. John smiled and dutifully went over. The postcard from Sicily was being held onto the fridge by a large fridge magnet of a vintage illustration. It showed a stylised drawing of a smiling 1950’s housewife wearing a striped apron and brandishing a wooden spoon. The caption on the fridge magnet read, 'I like to cook with wine…sometimes I even put it in the food…' John snorted laughter and turned to Siger, who, at the very moment John turned to him to acknowledge his joke, raised his glass in a jaunty salute. “Cheers!” he said brightly and took another big swig, making John laugh.
- it was incendiary to John’s desire…the way Sherlock kissed, his mouth, his voice, his long body straining under John, one strong hand and long fingers on John’s cock, the other sliding up John’s back and the nape of his neck and on up into and through John’s hair, and the smell of him; familiar but fiery and amplified by sweat and sex.
Sherlock looked up at him, flicking his hair away out of his eyes. “Uncle Rudy taught me,” he said simply, “when I was four. He was a firm believer that every child should have a penknife and he gave me a good one and taught me how to use it. For a lot of different things.”
“Who would know…” replied Sherlock vaguely, turning his back to John. He set down the notebook and picked up a piece of sheet music, studying it briefly before he returned it to the pile of various papers which covered the desk and which he then began to rifle through.
it, in fact, and in turn, he found his own hands suddenly at the fly of Sherlock’s expensive trousers and this time he opened them himself - but much more carefully than Sherlock was doing his own. He popped the fly button and then drew down the zip, while Sherlock hurriedly flicked open each stud on the fly of John’s Levi’s. They looked up at each other, when they were done, hot and flustered and breathing hard.
, goodness! And, oh, I
“—You mean a yacht?" said John.
read his expression, as clear as the copper coins in a swear jar.
The waitress came and cleared their plates, and then presented them with the dessert menu. Both of them felt inclined to express their enjoyment of the meal, which Mycroft felt had been absolutely exquisite - even by Constantine’s high standards. Maybe it was also something to do with the company. The company caught Mycroft’s eye. “So. Pud?” he asked, cheerfully, and then, “Have you got a sweet tooth, Mycroft?”
as he always used to think, and his height had never been a problem for him. Sherlock's height wasn't a problem for him now. The fact that Sherlock was a man wasn't exactly a ‘problem’ either, it was just what made this so very different, but as he had realised just moments ago; even if his brain still cared about that, his body didn't. His heart didn't. It knew and had always known what his brain had resisted. His feelings for Sherlock were nothing new to his heart. In the moment of revelation, when he finally saw that shining and golden fact, John took his mouth away from Sherlock's and he gasped, his hands stilled on Sherlock's body. "I think I know something new about myself now that I didn't know this morning," he said hesitantly, incredulously.
Gabriella continued, starting to collect her brushes and wiping them on a strip of rag. "With the money we made on our parents' house, I was able to pay off his debts and clear his name, and I supported him financially while he went into a retreat, and from there, joined Gamblers' Anonymous. When he came out of it all, he wanted a fresh start.” She stopped wiping and looked at them both. “And quite frankly, so did I! I didn’t want his money - I don’t need it - so in exchange for the debt he offered me his artist’s identity. He had always wanted to emigrate to Australia and get away, but my mother would never have let him go without a fight. He couldn’t go when our parents were still alive, but once they were gone, he was free. And so he went. He now lives in Sydney, Australia, with no debts at all in this country and he has created a new life as a sculptor out there under a different name, and I have a completely anonymous wonderful life here as a painter and writer.” She bent and started to pack away her paints and thinners as she spoke. “I don’t want all the fuss and fanfare, thank you very much. I just want to enjoy my life. Which is painting and writing.” She shut the little carrying box and looked up at them both to judge their reactions.
Sherlock sat down on a random seat next to the window, facing the back of the train, and he leaned the painting carrier carefully against the empty seat next to him, making sure it would stay on there before he let go of it. He turned his head to look out of the window and gazed outside. John, who had been following right behind him, put his package of paintings down carefully next to Sherlock’s and went to sit on the seat opposite. He hated facing the wrong way on trains. As John sat down, he felt the book in his pocket press against his ribs and remembered that Gabriella had signed it. He hadn’t had time to see what she’d written when they were back at her house. He sat the bag of scones on his lap and undid his coat, taking the book out and turning to the inside of the front cover to see.
They kissed each other passionately, their bodies striving to get even closer, their hands roving; on chests, on backs, down shoulders and arms...eventually they broke for breath again, and Greg stroked his fingers back and down through Mycroft’s hair as they separated. When he looked at him, Mycroft could see immediately that Greg was worried about something. “What is it?” Mycroft asked quickly, but with some reservations as to what the answer might be.
“Me!” said Siger proudly, grinning over at John. He was using the gigantic one that he had used earlier to chop parsley. “Little sideline of mine. Woodwork! And I do wood-turning. Made the wooden light pulls in the bathrooms too.” He gestured at the board John was using. “That one you’ve got there, John, is from the cherry tree that came down in the hurricane of 1987!”
Then Siger
Sherlock shrugged minimally. “Like what?”
…” he gasped. He was breathing very hard. Mycroft lifted his head and wiped his own mouth delicately with his thumb and first two fingers. Greg happened to be glancing down at that moment and saw him do it, and he threw his head back against the pillows again and laughed. “Oh
Intrigued, he frowned, put the rest of the stuff he was holding down on the sideboard, and picked the note up, opening it out to read it.
sherry o’clock by now!”
John already knew that Sherlock had planned on bringing his violin this weekend; he had told John that his mother had insisted on it, and so John knew that he had it with him, but when a violin suddenly began playing somewhere upstairs above John's head, he was momentarily surprised and he stopped reading to listen. John didn't have a clue what Sherlock was playing, he still knew very little about classical music, but he knew whether he either liked or didn't like the various pieces of music that Sherlock played. This...well, this was beautiful. Something about the violin not being in the same room as John, but upstairs in the room directly above; with the acoustics of the old house, the echoes and wonderful quality of resonant sound travelling down through the wooden floorboards…It was vintage surround-sound. It was, quite simply, magical to hear.
my holiday slides,” added Greg, sitting back in his chair and letting go of Mycroft’s hand with pretended relief, as if that had been his true incentive all along. Mycroft barked with laughter again. “Only your slides, Gregory?” he managed to ask daringly, recovering himself. Greg lifted an eyebrow. He liked where this was going. “Maybe some cine films an’ all...if yer lucky...” he added.
- one that’s
Some hard-hearted cynics might say of this chapter, “On a balcony? In February? In London? Nude and then almost nude? I don’t think so.”
And then, today.
Greg was instantly electrified by the command in Mycroft’s voice and he obeyed immediately. “It makes me wonder what it would be like to
"Oh, yeah, I'm fine, thanks, Sherlock! And how are you?" John asked, cheerfully sarcastic, before shaking his head in exasperation and then responding in a more normal tone of voice to Sherlock's question about Lestrade by saying, "...And yeah, you
“—You would say that, what with you constantly making bloody deductions all the way through it,” John said grumpily, continuing his moan while scrabbling about in one of the drawers. He just wanted to check the cost of the slightly extravagant take-away bill from last night for God’s sake, why was nothing ever easy?
"How long for?” John demanded irrationally, but suddenly wanting to know and unable to tear his eyes away from Sherlock’s till he answered.
"Erm...sorry, what?" he asked.
Sherlock called loudly up the stairs.
...But there was more. When exactly had the different become
Sherlock didn't answer, just continued holding up the picture and looking at it.
So the scarf had come from one of the most exclusive tailors in London.
He obeyed immediately, his cheeks and ears pinking more than they were already, coming up on both palms above Greg to make space, as Greg tipped the bottle generously onto his own lower stomach and top of his pubic hair. “Now come back down,” Greg said throatily, as he recapped the bottle briskly with a single careless twist of the cap and set it back without looking above his head on the bedside table. His hands, both now oily and empty, simultaneously slid down Mycroft’s sides to his hips and then his arse as Mycroft lowered himself back down to lie on Greg and they each pressed their bodies firmly together. “Mmmmm,” said Greg and then, “Oooh, your
Sherlock had sat down, opened the paper and lifted it up - but only as thinking cover - and decided to start at the beginning. What he needed to think about was
“No, yer right! I didn’t, did I?” mused Greg. He sat back and rested his weight on his palms, his arms locked straight behind him. He’d also unbuttoned his cuffs and rolled his sleeves up a bit while Mycroft had been gone, and Mycroft discreetly took in the sight of his toned muscular forearms displayed so attractively. Greg smiled. “When I saw you across the room, talking to John and that other fella, you had such a haughty, disinterested look on your face…not about John, I didn’t think, but about the whole thing - about bein’ there, full stop. Like you was up on some untouchable pedestal…”
Sherlock's father grimaced good-naturedly and waved a hand comically in the air, making John smile at the similarity to Sherlock once again. ”Oh, pffft!" he said. "
fucking name by now it would have all been completely
Sherlock paused for a moment, then he replied seriously - as if he had just been counting - “Mmmm, well, that would be the first…”
Mycroft burst out laughing; a real and genuine laugh which was surprised out of him like a startled rabbit out of a hat. Greg grinned, pleased with his little bit of story-telling magic. His thumb pressed down on the back of Mycroft’s index finger and slid up the back of his hand. His fingers were broad and warm in Mycroft’s. “Wanna come back to mine for some cheap scotch after?” he said, his dark eyes sparkling.
John had worked that bit out.
When Ian the ticket inspector reached their carriage six minutes later, he glanced in through the little window in the connecting carriage door for a moment - right before he pressed the door-release button, like he always did before he opened the doors - and then stopped short with his hand hovering frozen just in front of the button.
“Beastly thing,” snorted Mycroft, “don't encourage it.”
John began to see where this was going.
Mycroft, heart still thumping at Greg’s incredible offer, was amused. “Oh! What do you wear in bed then?”
That was how it was. Always. Simple. But it was what he knew. Along with the drugs, of course. He knew those. He knew those
he thought.
but he said nothing about it. “Oh he's busy, just saving the universe, this time, I think,” he said instead, and Lucia shot him a sharp look.
“You can leave the bike down there,” she said to him, gesturing to a narrow passageway behind a second gate at the side of the cottage.
It was then that it hit Gregory Lestrade, as he remembered Mycroft’s words from earlier;
But Greg was. “Ah, happy…er...Valentine’s Day!” he said, like he was pleased he’d remembered to say it.
When Sherlock was nearly finished speaking, Gabriella re-entered the room carrying a huge tray laden with a large plate of scones, china side plates and cups, and the huge red teapot, which she brought over to the coffee table. “Slightly out of season, Clary darling, but these are very welcome!" remarked Gabriella cheerfully, as she set the tray down. She handed them out the mis-matched side plates from the pile.
Greg grinned against Mycroft’s skin again, sending a thrill up his spine. “Oh, I like it… Listen, I
Using the medium of mime, the fish declared that Siger was
John was determined that he would see Sherlock first. He couldn't miss that first time for the world. He bit down hard on his lower lip and moved his left hand firmer and faster on Sherlock. Suddenly Sherlock's face changed, his eyes dropped shut again and he gasped John's name. His hand stilled on John's cock and his head tipped bonelessly back, his lips parting slightly. His neck arched beautifully and his head rolled gently against the wall in a slow, sensuous arc.
and went back to The Lancet.
Greg’s broad grin shone out then like his hair had shone so brightly under the moonlight outside. He said nothing about anything but he leaned back in carefully and kissed Mycroft gently. Mycroft kissed him back, not very gently. The kiss got more involved, Mycroft’s fingers found their way to the buttons of Greg’s shirt at chest height and stopped.
"Sherlock, please," he corrected. "Just Sherlock." He paused for effect, sipped his tea, and then put his cup down decisively. John almost expected him to crack his knuckles before he began.
But, Gregory was a Lestrade. And they did things their way...before Mycroft could get too smug, suddenly Greg shifted, lifting and moving his right thigh to insinuate it in between Mycroft’s, pushing his right foot down firmly between Mycroft’s ankles to settle it on the floor between Mycroft’s feet, shoving them both lightly aside with his own to be able to achieve this. He held Mycroft slightly more firmly as he did it, knowing he would be knocking him a little off balance. The tightened grip and the slightly rough treatment did amazing things to Mycroft, and now Greg was able to, standing with his right leg planted firmly between Mycroft’s, he pressed his right thigh deliberately further in and upwards slightly, and the space between their two bodies became almost non-existent; the pressure and the situation making Mycroft gasp in some air in a delightfully shocked way.
“Like Alice down the rabbit hole,” Mycroft had observed, “but you still need to come back up and face yourself, Sherlock.” But - curiouser and curiouser, Sherlock thought - since John had been living at 221b, Sherlock had thought about what relief the drugs gave him much less often…and besides, he had sort of
“Whatever you like,” said Greg, amiably. “Feels quite nice to stand up after bein' sat down all night.” They smiled at each other and both took a sip of their whisky. It was obvious that Greg had suggested they move to the sitting room for the sake of the comfortable seats, but really, neither of them actually wanted to. Not only because, as Greg had said, they had been seated all evening, but also because standing here was good; it was good physically, true, but being near each other like this, admiring each other in the close confines of this small room was…even more so. Mycroft had noted without meaning to when he passed the sitting room, that Greg’s armchairs were rather far apart, and the tiny two-seater sofa that he had in there had looked much too much of a squeeze for both of them to relax on. Especially with the full laundry basket that was currently on it. In Greg’s small and cosy kitchen however, Mycroft could feel the energy and chemistry between them like the push of heat and the drift of sparks close to a bonfire. From the deep look in Gregory’s beautiful brown eyes, he knew he could feel it too.
Mycroft looked at her. “A note?” he said.
In Mycroft’s neatly ordered world, this glorious, hedonistic abandonment to such a primeval activity simply wasn’t done.
"I do, don't I?" remarked Gabriella, turning to look at her partner and shaking her head and smiling. She took over the story at that point to explain further. “So what happened was, the gallery owner, Nicolette - her name is Nicolette - when I was delivering the first three paintings that were finished, she said me, 'People are so looking forward to meeting your brother.'

“And what might that treatment be?” asked Sherlock, reaching out to run his index finger across John’s lower lip lightly as he spoke.
the sound carrying clearly through the house. John and Sherlock heard Siger guffaw in delight and reply loudly,
The little antique sofa at 221b had never seen so much action in its life. Because Sherlock lay beneath with John above him, John was free to move...and so he made the most of this advantage, and he
And nothing more was said about it.
Mycroft had nearly finished his slice of toast and he put it down on his plate and rose to the challenge at once. “Gregory?” he said, really softly, sliding the back of his hand under his chin. He sat up straight and looked down his nose a little, quite deliberately.
He had suddenly thought back to the decision he had made at Christmas time, when they had finally met to speak again at Sherlock's parents' house, after all those months of silence. By then he had decided that it was his duty to look after and to protect Mary and the baby - the lying murdering wife and the unborn baby that he didn't feel he had bonded with at all, but if it was his duty, then
There was a lot of drinking going on, John noticed. He wasn’t a judgemental person in the least, but previous history with Harry’s drinking habits over the years had made him hyper-aware of who was drinking what and how much in situations like these, where there was a lot of alcohol present. It was kind of ingrained in him to notice. The Holmeses however, were not like Harry. They were cheerful, and he liked them a lot. There was none of the angst and anxiety here in their house that he had always associated with Harry’s drinking and Agatha was simply a force of nature, he’d decided - with or without the alcohol. She was great.
John was first of all rather taken aback that by coincidence, out of all the poems in the book, Sherlock had memorised the first two lines of what he thought of as one of his favourite poems, but then he thought that with Sherlock, there were no coincidences - and then he was instantly distracted from his own introspection when he noticed the artist's reaction to Sherlock's words - and her reaction was very odd. Standing next to her as he was, John suddenly realised he could feel the tension emanating from her in waves. He looked down at her hand holding the paint brush and saw that the smallest joints of her fingers were white and rigid where she was holding the brush so tightly. Her hand was very slightly shaking and her posture had straightened. Her ruddy face had even paled somewhat and she was looking fixedly at her canvas. She was suddenly wound as tightly as a spring. Gone was the relaxed laughing attitude of only a few moments ago.
Mycroft turned a little to face him, holding his mug in both hands again, enjoying its warmth. He smiled. “Only when one must. Most of the time I try not to, but I actually stole those from Sherlock yesterday morning. Had to see him about…um…something…and he was being particularly obnoxious.” He sipped some more of his tea.
Fiercely, passionately, hot and hard, they kissed each other. Their hands swept over each other's bodies like the sweep of hungry flame over dry wood. John slid his hand slowly down the front of Sherlock's lean body again and felt him gasp into his mouth. He drew back once more and looked into Sherlock's eyes and saw that something truly momentous was happening right now. This was entirely different, and both of them knew without question that there was no going back from this.
But John was in an interrupty mood today, it seemed. “—But
Of course Mycroft had noticed something and even felt the need to pass comment. Naturally, he had put it in a way that was so typically Mycroft. "Your choice of companion seems to be doing you good, brother, dear," he had purred knowingly. Sherlock had told him to shut up.
not a machine!"
Great Aunt!” he declared, with evident disgust at the very idea.
John was just then sifting quickly through various bills, their old tenancy agreement and a hand-drawn floor-plan of the Old Bailey - which made him raise his eyebrows before he discarded it - so it was a moment before he answered. “Not when I’m trying to watch a bloody film, I don’t,” he replied, “I wish you’d just let me work it all out for myself.”  He gave up looking in that drawer abruptly, slamming it shut to start on the next.
Mycroft could not keep his other hand out of Greg’s hair. Like being attracted by magnetic forces, his fingers were drawn to it, and once again, he made another gentle fist of the soft silver strands and pulled a little. Greg moaned, his hand on Mycroft’s cock squeezing hard and speeding up. At the same time, his other hand slipped under Mycroft’s shoulder and dug his fingers in, making Mycroft groan out a little in return.
“Oh yeah, I like that,” said John, and his voice was rough and husky.
He needed to think about what he had actually said yesterday, about what had been almost the first thought in his mind this morning when he woke up.
Gariella paused for a moment and looked at them, each in turn, gathering her story. “That’s better,” she said, meaning her facing them both at the same time. Then she settled back on her seat and started. “—My brother was already massively in debt by the time he was just beginning to get a name for himself in the art world..." She paused and looked at Sherlock. “Do you remember the news about the Turner Prize in 2013? It caused a huge sensation as it was won by a complete unknown.
“Not for me, thank you, just with a little water, please,” said Mycroft. Greg put the ice cube tray back undiminished, shut the freezer door as he straightened up and turned to face Mycroft. He hadn't switched on the bright overhead light, and the low-level under-cabinet lighting was soft and pleasant. He looked at Mycroft and Mycroft looked at him.
Now he looked properly at them, and saw what he had missed; a large old black and white photo of a smiling couple in their early twenties, a handsome, clearly brown-skinned man in R.A.F uniform, and sporting a very full moustache, his arm draped around the shoulders of a pretty fair-haired woman, and the second photo of the same man kneeling down with his arm around the shoulders of a small child with plaits aged about eight or nine; clearly this was Clarissa and her father. But Sherlock had moved on. Pointing at a slim wooden case on the wall sited between two bookshelves and behind John’s head - John hadn’t even noticed it there - Sherlock said, “The medals in the case, the age of them - clearly your father’s, and your very unusual accent - I can hear rural Suffolk most keenly in the vowels, so - early childhood at Mildenhall.”
Mycroft’s heart, already softened beyond recognition by the evening’s events, melted.
“Where’s yer tie gone?” asked Greg, wondering about its very conspicuous sudden absence. Mycroft smiled and patted his trouser pocket, where the neatly rolled tie now resided, tucked in like a tidy Swiss roll. “In here,” he said. Greg smiled back at his innate orderliness.
John hesitated to say exactly what had been on his mind. “But mine’s further away from Mrs. H…if we get…ah…if it gets noisy…” replied John.
Sherlock…that’s…that’s perfect.” He grinned. “But you know traditionally, it’s sort of supposed to be a mystery who a Valentine’s Day card is from? Even if it’s obvious. You’re not meant to write your name in it.”
“Oh, hang on, you ‘aven’t heard the best bit yet...” warned Greg, and then he grinned and revealed the punch line. “...It turns out it was only a bloody nudist beach!”
He loved Gregory’s tentative gesture. He released the glass and took his hand away from it, taking Gregory’s fingers with him. On the tablecloth, unheeded by glassware, they lightly held hands like a couple of love-struck teenagers. Greg grinned at him and Mycroft found himself actually grinning back.
It was like the heart of embers when the fire had burnt down low; the black shells of coal and the dark grey ash hiding the vibrant coral glow that was buried in the centre like a warm secret.
grin, but when he did so, he he realised that Mycroft didn’t look exactly
This was where they were meant to be.
John saw his cue, which was to ask what the throw-away comment had been, and he took his opportunity to reach for the scone while covering his action with the question. "Which was?" he asked quickly, taking the scone with one hand while he reached for the butter with his knife.
“You haven’t seen her when Mycroft starts stealing vol au vents,” said Sherlock clearly, knowing his brother was right next door in the study, with the door wide open.
"I'm here," said John.
…shocking, yes, and it had certainly shocked John, but more than just shocking; to John’s ears it had been something else. It had all sounded…somehow so…deliciously…
John saw then that what Sherlock was trying to say was essentially the same sentence that he himself was trying to say, and both of their sentences translated simply as the utterly terrifying combination of those three small and individually innocent words, “I” and “love” and “you”.
he thought, and he almost moaned himself. “Oof, say it again, just like that...” he demanded, and he flicked his tongue lightly up Mycroft’s neck and kissed it.
'So much for talking to cool things down! Holy fucking…
He could hardly think straight at the dizzying turn of events.
Is that all I get?” asked Greg, lowering his glass, pretending to be quite dismayed. Mycroft smiled wryly. He thought he’d been extremely honest already. As much as he realised that Greg was teasing him here, he also realised he was going to have to
have any cigarettes under there,” he said sniffily. “Anyway, I have two patches on today.” He suddenly brought both hands out from under the table and pulled up his dressing gown sleeve, holding his right arm defiantly out to John to demonstrate them. John glanced at the patches and then back at Sherlock’s face again. He was relieved to see he had been wrong about the cigarettes. “What
Sherlock certainly looked like he wanted to get up from
John looked down at the slip of paper. "In love," he announced, rather amused. Mycroft certainly got his own back with that one. He thumped the table and roared with laughter, much in the manner of Agatha earlier. John had never seen him laugh quite like that before, and he looked over at him, delighted, grinning wildly.
Well. This chapter. This chapter is also known (affectionately and privately, just to me and my beta) as
He couldn't say that yet, but instead he murmured, “It's always all about you, Sherlock, you stupid, mad bastard. It always has been.” He squeezed Sherlock tighter; with his arms, with his body, clutching a fistful of the back of Sherlock's shirt and with his head pressed to the side of Sherlock's face, his eyes shut tight, lashes wet with both the tears he had just shed and with fresh ones threatening.
a few seconds long to show his disapproval.
Now he felt really faint and he actually had to shove his chair backwards and move his cup out of the way, so that he could cross his forearms on the table and put his head down onto them. 'I'm definitely concussed,' he thought. "Sherlock, I think I might go back to bed for a bit. I think I need to lie down," he said with his head down on the table.
much closer, but before he could voice that sparkling little gem of common sense, Greg leaned in and up and kissed him. Lightly, just a first press of his lips against Mycroft’s, closing his eyes to feel the sensation, and so Mycroft closed his own eyes - at first, simply experiencing the feel of Greg’s soft lips against his own, and then Greg’s warm hand stole up to the side of Mycroft’s face and held him there gently and Mycroft was just...
and on being released, who had he wanted to go to? There was only one person. He had gone back inside the silent flat only for his coat, his wallet, his phone and his keys, and then he had slammed the front door closed and started walking.
Greg grinned and delivered, lowering his glass. “So I can shove ‘im up against the wall and show ‘im who’s boss.”
The elegantly defined muscles of Sherlock's shoulders and back were...distracting John somehow. He put his hand near Sherlock's uninjured right shoulder, high up on his upper arm, to steady him, and again, like before when he had touched Sherlock's face, he was aware of something changing in the atmosphere of the room. They so rarely touched each other - it was as if the room was holding its breath. Sherlock's right shoulder was very warm under his hand. 'Get a grip!' thought John, and he mentally shook himself. 'Do what you're supposed to be doing,' he thought firmly, and he pressed carefully, decisively, just above and then just below the reddening at the base of Sherlock's neck. John concentrated on making the steadying right hand do its job - be steadying and solid, while his left hand - the palpating hand - palpated and examined Sherlock's back effectively all around the reddening and the abrasions, feeling the muscles and what was going on underneath them. He checked all the ribs, asking various diagnostic questions such as, "Does this hurt?", "Does this?",  "How about here?" and Sherlock's answers were mainly in the negative.
Hmmm. They were. He still felt... something
as I prefer to call her," said Gabriella, with a grin. “But I think she calls me something else! Come in and make yourselves at home…coat hook
"I was," Sherlock replied, with a sharp intake of breath over one of his lower ribs, "but then I decided I needed to get closer to the inside, so after I left the manager's office, I went out of the restaurant and found a place out of sight to leave my coat, then I went back in through in the kitchen entrance and I was someone called Jamie Hinderson."
But Sherlock held John just as tightly as John held him, and he said softly in his ear, “No, no, it’s always been all about
sang his internal voice gleefully as he indulged himself by running his fingers through Gregory’s gorgeous silver hair again and again.
Sherlock looked at the fabric ball and smiled. He laid the packet of strings on the table. “You went to Guiviers' to get these,” he said, amused. He turned to look at John. “So this was the Secret Squirrel business yesterday.”
he murmured weakly.
‘What happens now?’ John thought, excited, aroused and totally terrified.
It was quite a difficult sentence for anyone to get out the first time, and saying it always made one feel so suddenly, incredibly vulnerable, but this was not just anyone; this was
Moving head only: Jealous,
gasped Sherlock instantly, and he squeezed John’s cock hard, drawing his other hand sudden and hard up John’s back, his long fingers firm, the nails lightly scoring reddened lines of desire into John’s flesh.
“What?” asked Mycroft, frozen in a breathy gasp.
"What now?" asked John, irritated if there was going to be sarcasm to follow, because Sherlock had been in a bad mood all morning, and John was now at the end of his very long and normally very elastic tether. Sherlock's volatile mood swings and his sarcastic snappiness were trying at the best of times.
he thought, sickened,
“You 'ave the white one,” Greg said and he took another deep drag on his cigarette. Mycroft slid the white dressing gown on one arm - finding it actually turned out to be rather big and so surprisingly luxurious - and he passed the blue one to Greg. As Greg took it, he offered Mycroft the half-smoked cigarette in exchange, before he opened the balcony door on the left and stepped out there, standing over to one side, so that when Mycroft came out they could both fit comfortably.
“I—we’re really doing this?” asked John, and Sherlock smiled.
had simply come from nowhere too. Greg released him for a moment. He drew back so he could see Mycroft’s face and paused, smiling delightedly and looking at Mycroft with something like wonder. He slid his hand that was currently in Mycroft’s hair back down the side of his neck and down to the top of his shoulder, turning his palm so the side of his thumb rested on the level of Mycroft’s collarbone through his shirt. He stroked it familiarly back and forth through the fabric.
Greg laughed heartily again. “Oh
John glanced over at Sherlock with a questioning expression on his face and raised a confused eyebrow.
Greg’s eyebrows raised even higher, his mouth dropping open a little. “No, Mycroft, I didn’t!” he said, firmly, but he looked astounded. “Look, are we both going loopy ‘ere?” he asked, resting his hand which held the cigarette on the balcony and leaning onto it. He gestured with his free hand as he systematically went through the series of events. “I got a note from you - well, it wasn't
he was, Mycroft wondered. Possibly not. And his voice….rough, deep and as hot as the seventh circle of Hell. Mycroft thought he could have burned there quite happily all night; listening to Gregory talk so knowledgeably about how the different types of Iberian ham were produced in Spain and Portugal, and then give detailed instructions on how to make the perfect Spanish rice pudding; following his grandmother’s recipe, using orange peel, lemon peel and a cinnamon stick to flavour it. Mycroft had listened to it all, discretely enraptured. He checked his watch. It was now 8pm exactly. He adjusted his cufflinks unnecessarily and straightened his tie, before pushing open the black walnut door.
He didn’t want to be the parent here. “I’d really like there to be no secrets between us…” he said carefully, as he folded the list over again and then tucked it into his wallet on top of his Tesco clubcard. “…But if you've got some cigarettes under there, I’d really rather know about them than not.” He closed his wallet and put it back in his inside pocket, and only then did he look up at Sherlock’s face.
This was different because the knife-wound business had been an instinctive assessment of a very visible and bleeding wound, which urgently required his attention, and as a doctor and a surgeon, John's attention had been drawn to that wound and the blood with the single-mindedness of a hungry shark. But this was not the same. There
right...” he purred, deliciously pleased with himself, and Mycroft felt him smile against his neck once more. Mycroft made some kind of strangulated inelegant sound and Greg suddenly pressed harder against him. With that, Mycroft could simply take all this teasing no longer and he brought his hands up fast to slide his long, pale fingers into Greg’s silver hair and turn his face towards his own, where he kissed him with a building hunger that had suddenly raged from nowhere. In retaliation, Greg’s right hand gave his arse a proper squeeze, his other hand coming up to the side of Mycroft’s face and then round to cup the back of his head. They kissed fiercely for a few moments, pushing against each other, seeking friction, the hand on his arse sliding once again up Mycroft’s back to pull him closer still, until Greg broke away and looked at Mycroft, breathing hard. “Oh Jesus, you’re somethin’ else...” he gasped. His eyes were sweet, dark pools to drown in, Mycroft thought. “As are
Did Mycroft mind it?
turn…” and he pushed Mycroft up and off by his shoulder and waist and shifted himself sideways under Mycroft to get out from underneath, turning as he moved to flip Mycroft over onto his back on the bed. Then he slid on top of his lover, lying almost directly between his long legs. Mycroft moaned out loud at the change of sensation and as he wrapped his calves around Gregory’s again, and felt the new firmer friction as Greg began to move once more, he actually growled in response. “Oh, that’s so
... Gregory’s immediate proximity, his delicious, intoxicating scent, the feel of his body so very close, his feet tight against Mycroft’s, his legs beginning to press against Mycroft’s - where he was leaning further in and up to reach Mycroft’s mouth more firmly - and now, as he leant closer, Mycroft could begin to actually feel Gregory’s body taut against his own. While Mycroft was processing it all, on some other level, his hands were both beginning to get involved in their own early exploration of Gregory’s firm body and his broad back, and then, while Greg’s right hand was still on Mycroft’s face, the other left the worktop and found the bony curve of his hip.
John snorted again and nearly laughed outright. “Oh, I think I have something I want to press into you," he said, filthily. He was good at that sort of talk.
at which John cracked and broke into a broad smile. Sherlock shook his head a little disdainfully at all this very immature behaviour, and then simply lifted his glass and tipped the holly sprig straight into his mother’s empty glass next to him, making John snort with laughter.
Sherlock carefully lowered the painting to the floor and leant it against the wall. "This one was the last painting that he completed and it was still on his easel, at his London studio in Leytonstone," he said, studying it.
he thought, ignited with a fire that was far from holy. Greg started slowly, but then went to town on the length of Mycroft’s long, pale neck, and Mycroft quickly became unable to repress the sound that was forming in his throat any longer. As Greg’s left hand swept up from Mycroft’s hip to his waist, and then slowly up his long back, the other that had been on his face slid round into his hair - Greg’s fingers curling delicately to caress the base of his skull - Mycroft experienced the surreal feeling of being encased by Gregory Lestrade and he could no longer stop himself. His mouth fell open and now he did actually moan softly.
They emerged on one of the busy side streets outside the shopping centre, but every cab that passed was taken.
“No, come on - she's sweet,” said John, stroking her. “She’s purry and friendly. What more do you want from a cat?” The cat twined around his leg, winding her tail around his calf. He wasn't much into cats actually, but this was a very friendly  one and he definitely had time for such an affectionate animal.
Sherlock brought the other man towards John, weaving between cars and then walking on the roadway, and flashing his stolen police ID badge very quickly at a woman who was looking interested. Sherlock even said to her, "Nothing to see here, move along please," in true police fashion. John soon realised why the man was coming so easily. "Handcuffs?" asked John, amazed, "Where did you get those?"
I love the 1987 British film ‘Maurice’ with an absolute passion. It’s one of my favourite films (and favourite books!) On tumblr I yak on about it endlessly. 😜
John grinned. “Googled ‘who is the best living violinist?’ and his name came up - there were a few others, of course, but he’s the first one to play in the U.K. next and he’s coming to London next, so,
He tried again.
Mycroft swallowed. “And what might that be?” he asked falteringly, but, oh, he knew.
Just then, Lucia came in in oven gloves, bearing a pile of hot side plates ready for their first course. John was looking up at her as she entered the room, and he saw that she had immediately spotted the sprig of holly that Sherlock had transferred over to her empty wine glass. She caught John’s eye and smiled at him. When she’d gone around the table and deposited all the side plates onto each placemat with a warning about how hot they were and to be careful, she lifted her glass and tipped the holly sprig out on to the top of the table decoration of clementines, without a word about how it got in there. Then she tucked the stem of it in neatly between the clementines, so it sat perkily upright near the centre. She winked at John almost over Sherlock’s head as she did it.
Agatha had become a close friend of the Holmeses by long acquaintance, as they and their next-door neighbour had been living in the same two houses for the last forty years. “—So we’re all like a little extended family,” Siger chipped in, helping himself to another mince pie. John just caught Mycroft's face recoil in a moue of distaste at the description before he recovered his composure.
He smelt good. He smelt really good. John could feel his heart start to beat faster of its own accord. His mouth was suddenly very dry. John swallowed with difficulty and went closer. "What's your movement like?" he asked, almost thinking aloud, and then he asked Sherlock to first rotate and then flex his neck forwards, and, like before, Sherlock could demonstrate a fairly full range of neck movement. "It just feels very tight," he said.
Nearly forgot the
Mycroft stepped back, his own mouth now dropping open a little, before he realised what he was doing and closed it quickly, swallowing the growing feeling of horror - the realisation that he had been right and something was truly,
Mycroft, you’re gorgeous,” he whispered, looking down at Mycroft’s smooth stomach, his lower abdomen, the top of his underwear, and - where he could see it - the shape of his erection visible through his burgundy jersey trunks. Greg ran one thumb experimentally up and down over the edge of the waistband and the skin of Mycroft’s lower stomach, while Mycroft just waited, taut with nervous tension and desperate to see what Greg would do next. But Greg had noticed the discreet brand logo on the elastic of Mycroft’s underwear. Not to mention the feel of very expensive real silk. “Crikey, I think your pants might cost more than my whole
would you—” John was so horrified he went a bit high-pitched. But Sherlock didn’t look like he thought he’d done anything wrong, so John took a breath and calmed down and pressed on. “—Ok, so you’ve forged a note from Greg to meet Mycroft? I can’t—” he stopped again and flung his hands up, suddenly imagining the carnage. “He’s gonna go mental! They’re both gonna go mental when they find out!"
Mycroft burst out laughing. He actually had to put his drink down before he spilt it. He thought he’d never laughed so much in one night in his entire life and certainly never while feeling so aroused at the same time. “Gregory, you’re so…
"I'll have a look when we get back," said John, soothingly.
“Well, unless I ‘ave guests…” Greg added, sliding his leg up and down a bit, grinning boyishly, “…but I think on this occasion, it might not be a problem?”
She gave a visible start.
"Oh! Hello! I'm Clarissa," supplied Clarissa, unnecessarily - though of course she was unaware of that fact - quickly pulling off her muddied gardening gloves to shake hands with each of them. She repeated their names back to them as she shook their hands, obviously using a memory technique to cement them in her mind, and she shook their hands in a pleasantly firm way. Her warm, confident manner spoke of someone who had had long practice in meeting people. And not that many women shook hands so firmly, John observed, feeling a bit Sherlock.
And now he kept
the best massage I've ever had…”
He cleaned the wound carefully and applied two steri-strips over the first part of the wound near the shoulder blade, where it was deepest. The rest of it only needed several large dressings.
John snorted. The next drawer was stuck and wouldn’t open, and he jiggled it about to try and shift the contents. Immediately he got it open, he saw why it was stuck. It was stuffed to the gunnels with more bills, newspaper cuttings and general household paperwork. “Oh, for God’s s—” he muttered at the drawer, then raised his voice to call back through to Sherlock, “Well, can’t you maybe just
Mycroft smiled and shrugged with one shoulder.  “Well, maybe just a very small flag…” he conceded, sipping his tea in a manner to equal Greg’s.
Sherlock could see John thinking all this and he had to stop it, fast. Slightly panicked, he held up a hand to say
Mrs Hudson had also noticed the change in him and she had put it not so subtly. "Oh, he's good for you, Sherlock, dear," she had said, warmly, rubbing his arm fondly as she spoke, and Sherlock had just looked her in the eye and sort of smiled. He wasn't angry about Mrs. Hudson knowing. And she knew, even if she didn't say it out loud.
Sherlock sat forward in his chair and put his now empty cup on the coffee table. “The gallery owner told me that Gabriel was very angry about the positioning of the paintings and had slammed the phone down after shouting that he ‘wouldn't be blackmailed’, but what interested me was the throw away comment that she said he made afterwards," he said.
it.” He gasped the last few words in a rush. “Feel free to...ah...you can say it again...if you like?” he offered, almost hopefully.
fucking angry and hurt that Sherlock had put him through that hell, and left him there for so long.
He smiled at John, who was still stroking the cat’s head as she rubbed against his leg. John grinned at the name. And the theatrics. “Nice name!” he said, approvingly.
“Mother, he’s a doctor and an ex-army surgeon, not a veterinary nurse,” growled Sherlock, returned from the pantry and back leaning sulkily against the worktop.
"Because you are very embarrassed by it, therefore it has embarrassing connotations for you, so clearly there is a link to sex, you were with her long enough for her to teach you some techniques and for you to feel confident enough in using them to offer to use them on me, so clearly not a brief…
John didn't reply. He felt the shift in the comments from joking to not-joking.
“Oh, yeah, I’ll have some, please, Sherlock,” said John, holding up his water glass to make pouring from the full jug easier, and Sherlock obliged, saying nothing more. Agatha was holding her newly-replenished wineglass in one hand as he gestured at her with the jug a moment later, just about to drink from it, and though she didn’t stop telling them both about the bowler’s beautiful leg cutter, she covered the top of her water glass with her free hand quickly and dramatically so Sherlock couldn’t fill it, like people usually did when they were refusing more wine, and making a quick noise of scorn as she did so. “No,
“Hey, I’ve just realised - it’s nearly twenty past,” she said, looking at them with consternation, “You’d better get a move on if you want to catch your train!”
have asked you out on a…date, Mycroft,
indeed.
By the time he got to Tesco’s - in fact, way before he’d even got through the automatic doors - he had been bombarded by Valentine’s Day merchandise everywhere and the incessant prompting to buy some of it for his Valentine…John didn’t really go for all this ‘Valentine’s day celebration’ stuff, he couldn’t help but feel it a cynical commercial attempt by the shops to simply extract more money from everyone now the enforced austerity of January was over, but all the same, he thought it might be a nice surprise to get
what he was dealing with, John thought, amused. No one was fooling anyone in this house.
"What are you doing now?" asked John, but he thought he could guess.
of your cabbages, Sigs!” she exclaimed in dramatic wonder as she shrugged her coat off and chucked it messily over the hook on the back of the door. “Mycroft was just showing me…Oh, and here’s your lighter, Mykie—er,
“Well…” he said in reply. Then they grinned at each other.
A glance at the clock showed just under an hour had passed. He felt so much better. No pounding head - no headache at all. He sat up slowly, and then he leaned over for the glass and drank the rest of the water, turning to look and noting that the only sign that Sherlock had actually really been there, and it hadn't just been a surreal dream, was the indentation in the pillow where Sherlock’s head had been, lying next to his own.
“But Sherlock, they’ll both have seen through it as soon as they spoke to each other!” John persisted. He paused. “…Well, not casting any aspersions on Greg, but Mycroft will have realised and seen through it immediately.”
"He's a new waiter," continued Sherlock. "Saw it on the staff rota. He was supposed to start work today at 11.30, but as it was only just after 10.30 I said I'd got a lift and had to come in early."
At that, Greg really laughed, and as Mycroft smirked at him from across the table, Greg thought, with his insides all aglow, ‘Honestly, thank you, Sherlock, for the best Valentines’ Day of my life!’
- I am kissing
Curling of sides: Fickle,
He felt a building surge of pure amazed joy, and of a strange liberation; the stark incredulity that this was
"Excuse me," she said to John and Sherlock suddenly, and turned her head to call through to Gabriella who had returned to the kitchen. "Have you taken the—"
"What ‘ave you got planned for the rest of the day then, M?” Greg asked, seemingly reading his mind as he got up to retrieve the latest round of newly popped up toast.
“Right!…Well, ok, er…right. That’s a bit…um…cryptic!” replied John, rubbing his head, shifting in his seat, suddenly feeling acutely embarrassed. He laughed a little with awkwardness. He felt a bit…
about you!"
Sherlock couldn't even begin to try to say to John what he had just worked out. "Nothing. Nothing, it doesn't matter."
After a moment, where they eyed each other on the edge of a precipice, Sherlock said in a confessional tone, “I happen to quite like it when you tell me what to do."
Sherlock glanced at John and went straight into the kitchen before she could get back downstairs. John just stood where he was and ate his canapé - which was lovely - and smiled at her as she walked back into the room. She hadn’t changed her clothes either, he noticed, relieved, feeling slightly more comfortable about the whole thing. She mentioned the ongoing cricket disaster as she passed him, to which he responded fairly sympathetically, and then she went straight back over to settle into what was clearly her preferred armchair…just as Sherlock reappeared with her drink.
Sherlock stopped. “Oh. You like that," he said, softly. It was not really a question.
he asked calmly.
Half an hour later, John was sitting at a different table in the kitchen, helping to peel and chop vegetables with Lucia and Siger, when Sherlock waltzed into the room wearing his suit jacket and scarf. John looked up at him and knew instantly - not from the smell of smoke but from the guilty look on his face - that he’d just sneaked outside for a cigarette.
‘Right,’ John thought. ‘I’ll bloody well
Greg smiled. “Oh, well, that’s that settled then!” he said, happily. He tucked the cigarette back between his lips and held it between his teeth to smile around it. “Now I can smoke happy!” he said. Mycroft snorted a little in amusement at the very idea.
thought Greg, and he said, “I’m saying I’d like to take you upstairs to my bed,” all his cards spread out on the table and no shame about any of them.
"Well, I'm not storing them till next year. Come along!" said Lucia, shaking the box at him urgently, making the crackers inside rustle and rattle intriguingly. “Hurry up and take one! Quick, before our food gets cold!”

“It said….” Now that he knew Greg hadn’t written it, Mycroft was acutely embarrassed to repeat precisely what it had said. He swallowed and forced himself. “It
this way. It was so…
"How did you know it was my favourite poem?" he asked, wonderingly.
“No, I put it in my desk at work to hide it from anyone seeing it…” said Greg. He shifted his position, and pointed his finger to pin down the facts. “…So, hang on, you just said you got a note from
Sherlock’s body. The exertion earlier of running after the business man had raised his body temperature and so now John could smell him. John breathed in deeply and inhaled the soft, familiar scent of the man he lived with; woody, somehow, musky, very….
The roads became more and more residential until they eventually turned down a quiet side street of elegant, terraced Victorian houses; all decorative red brickwork with high bay windows and bevelled sills of pale stone. There were large, mature London plane trees dotted periodically in gaps in the paving slabs on both sides of the street, their seed pods dangling like decorative baubles from the bare branches. Greg directed the driver of the taxi and he came to a smooth stop halfway down the street, outside number 29. A low brick wall separated the front garden from the pavement, and the wall was clearly the same vintage as the house; constructed of the same dusky red and aged bricks. There were skeletal tufts of small-leafed hardy plants growing in various cracks and fissures in the old mortar, and in clumps around its base.
said John slowly, more shocked at the fond warmth emanating from Mycroft’s text than at anything else.
They both looked at the envelope.
Just over five minutes later, Greg had come back to bed bearing his own coffee, his phone, and Mycroft’s tea on a round, red Christmas-themed tray. Mycroft moved back over to the empty side of the bed so Greg could get in. Greg set the tray carefully on top of his pile of magazines and shrugged off his dressing gown to hang it on the back of his door again. He was totally unfazed by being completely naked in the soft early morning light, which had now noticeably brightened, and as he came back to bed, he reached down and switched his bedside lamp on. The warm gentle glow once again transformed the room. Greg getting back into the bed to sit up beside Mycroft transformed it further. He twisted round to reach Mycroft’s mug from the tray and handed it to him. As Mycroft sat up to take it, he realised his heart was still doing a gymnastic display about last night, which he had been thinking about while Greg had been gone. ‘Will I ever stop thinking about it?’ he wondered, smiling, taking the mug gratefully. Which made him realise that it was not only his heart that was on double-time. His smile had never seen so much action either. Being with Gregory Lestrade was like having an almost non-stop facial exercise workout.
) Now Mycroft did laugh, at all of it.
"No," he said to Sherlock, standing at the window, watching him. John loosened his hold on his cup of coffee carefully. "No, I...didn't scream," he said cautiously.
gesture. Wide-eyed, he jerked his head back in annoyance and made an expansive quick flare of irritation with both hands. God, Sherlock could be annoying.
Sherlock looked surprised. “Itzhak Perlman!” he exclaimed. It was hard to surprise Sherlock but clearly John had managed it. “How do you even know who he is?” he asked, clearly mildly astonished.
he gasped. He nearly dropped his mug.
"Oh, probably dislocated shoulder, bloodied nose - most likely broken - and very angry, but he’ll have cooled down a few fair degrees by now."
Sherlock nodded sagely at Gabriella’s story. "We all need to be listened to, don't we?" he said encouragingly and he was looking straight at Gabriella, but John couldn't help but feel again that that was meant for him, somehow. It just wasn't a very Sherlock thing to say.
she trumpeted enthusiastically. “I’m
He scrubbed a hand vigorously through his hair and continued. “Mornin’s are the worst! God, what I wouldn’t give for a disgustin’ filthy fag right now.” He tapped his fingers a few times on his duvet-covered knee in frustration, before reaching back over to pick his mug up again as a self-distraction technique.
They sat at the kitchen table for the tea, mince pies and biscuits, and discussed how Christmas had been - for John, no discussion necessary, it had been absolutely terrible, but he stuck to his cover story and said it had been lovely again for the sake of politeness. For the Holmeses, Christmas had been either bearable, moronic, wonderful or tremendous; depending on which member of the family was answering the question.
Before she even finished the sentence, Sherlock was coming out of the pantry holding a large container of black peppercorns. “Here,” he said, putting it on the table.
a normal person might quite reasonably be inclined to ask. But life at Baker Street was never what you’d call ‘normal’; things generally weren't ever
“Final word,” Sherlock murmured softly, to himself.
exactly…it’s my name, isn’t it? It’s just…well, no one usually…everyone just calls me Greg.”
he thought. This was getting worse. John felt like he had been very childish about forcing Sherlock into a corner, and now he was paying the price of his tit-for-tat. Now Sherlock knew something else was up with him but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.
What did it
and he glanced over to the room’s open doorway…just in time to see Mycroft lean back quickly on the desk chair, swivelling it round as he did so, and then - in a beautiful example of chair-ballet - propel himself forwards to the door to push it quietly but very firmly closed with his outstretched foot. He didn't even get up from his seat to do it.
Greg’s kitchen was pretty tiny and Mycroft was not. He was very big in the small room. Greg noticed. He couldn’t
“God, you’re a sight for sore eyes...” Greg murmured, clearly relishing the spectacle of his lover naked in full daylight.
“Oooh
“Well, you would, wouldn’t you, with a father in the R.A.F….Mildenhall first though, wasn’t it?” Sherlock interjected casually, and like that was a natural assumption.
mended, after all, to a degree, but with a repair that had moulded someone else into their lives. It was no longer
Mycroft returned the newly-full tea pot to the table and went to get some fresh mugs while it brewed.
"I am!" he replied, a little deafened but undaunted, holding out a hand for her to shake. “Pleased to meet you, Agatha!” He felt so much better since he'd arrived at Sherlock's parents' house. Much more like himself.  He dealt with people every day at the surgery - sometimes emotionally draining and very difficult people - and he could see immediately that she was going to be neither of those. Someone like Agatha was going to be absolutely no problem for John. She took his hand in a firm handshake and clasped it warmly with her other hand. "What a pleasure to finally meet
"The head chef. He's in on it. I already knew that but I needed proof. Unfortunately though, he was onto me. He’d heard my voice and seen me speaking with the manager earlier but he was out of sight and I didn’t know he was there."
Oh holy
leave his emotional comfort zone if this were to progress. This concept was also very new to him. He swallowed the last of his delicious scotch in one burning gulp.
"Mmm. Most doctors are not so good with the hands-on aspect," commented Sherlock as John worked a particularly tight area loose.
should do now.
Once the tea things were cleared away (by Siger and Mycroft, John was not allowed to help and Sherlock didn’t offer), Lucia started gathering ingredients and utensils to create her next culinary masterpiece. “Do you like vol au vents, John?” she asked, as she put a last mug in the dishwasher, shut the door and switched it on.
defensive now, he realised, fists clenched involuntarily, and he thought savagely, 'Oh, well, that's just
Instinctively, on impulse, Greg broached the gap between them and reached for Mycroft’s hand again, squeezing it and then keeping hold as he leant forward quickly to kiss Mycroft lightly on the cheek. His lips were soft, the brief scent of his aftershave dark and woody. Mycroft was so taken aback that he had not seen that coming at all. 'What’s wrong with me,' he thought, looking at Greg with surprise, feeling Greg’s fingers once more laced between his own, ‘that I didn’t see that coming? Is this what emotional involvement does? Totally annihilates one’s senses?’
"I just...er...I just meant I was going to go and lie down. And you said...I thought you..." John stopped and paused for a second. "Why, d'you…
widely. This amount of smiling must be some kind of record. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been this happy. “Oh, I don’t see any problem here,” he said smoothly, around the smile.
thought Mycroft, helpless in the face of such easily given affection. Not to mention the outright temptation. Mycroft swallowed hard, feeling the heat building in his face. Thank God it
“No! Er, no…No. Oh God, that's–that's nothing. I'm–er, I'm used to that."
It was the complete polar opposite.
Greg suddenly realised just how much he really wanted to be

So it was boring, but it was also a perfect setting for thinking.
events of last night - totally buck naked and wild in all his dishevelled glory. The thought made Mycroft’s heart race, and he smiled at Greg awkwardly and a little nervously.
no doubt
Of course John hadn't. Sherlock had got the address from the gallery owner when she had phoned him to ask for his help in finding the missing artist and his four missing paintings as quickly as possible before the exhibition started, and Sherlock had immediately gone round to his studio, found it empty and picked the lock. "It's the size of a shoe cupboard," Sherlock continued. "It'll be even smaller when it's full of police-idiots ogling. Anyway, his exhibition opens on January 7th and they'll certainly need it back before then. We need to find him before the exhibition opens or there's going to be a very unpleasant empty space on the wall."
“Good,” said Greg. “So am I.” Greg moved in then, deliberately slowly, planting one polished, chocolate-brown Cheaney boot on either side of Mycroft’s shiny black Oxford brogues. “And I'm not jokin’ around now, I mean it,” he continued. “What else can I do to please you, Mycroft?” His voice was a dark, seductive whisper and Mycroft could barely breathe.
Dear patient Mystraders/Gregcrofters: This is the chapter you've been waiting for...well, the start of what you've been waiting for anyway! I promise there's so much more to come...
“Hmmm, well. I should hope not…” Mycroft replied, but he smiled at the hot part. “Don’t call me that in public though, will you?”
She gave a start again and tried to smother it. “I…I don’t know what you mean…” she said quickly and, John thought, cautiously, as it was obvious that she did.
“Agatha,” Sherlock said, coolly, by way of greeting - interrupting her as he stepped forward smoothly into the room and towards her.
Mycroft had managed to gather his wits enough to answer, and he squeezed lightly back as he did so. “Am I indeed?” he asked, intrigued. “And where should I be?”
she said, interrupting him, “Oh, good God!” And she turned round and looked fully at him, studying his face, brows lowered, her mouth slightly open.
sending you a note like this?” He glanced back down at it. “It’s pretty suggestive, isn’t it? It says, ‘I’ve seen you—’ ”
Now John went over to look back out of the window again. It faced the same direction as the one in John’s room, and looked out over the garden and the countryside, but it was a much larger window, so more could be seen. The view was stunning. “God, the views here!” said John enthusiastically, taking it all in properly. He was far too used to looking at the grey, beige and brick cityscape of London, with barely a single tree dotted here and there to break the monotony.
thought John, almost delirious with joy but no longer laughing, looking down at Sherlock in something like wonder. ‘This is
She laughed and actually slapped her knee. “Oh, that wily old bugger, Leslie! I knew him from times past!” she said, shaking her head, all jolly once again. “He would have gotten away with that for

but to even say Sherlock’s name like
Siger reached over without asking to re-fill Agatha’s now empty sherry glass and then discreetly topped up his own too, earning a little frown from Lucia, who had sat back down at the other end of the large table to continue rolling out her pastry.
Greg really liked this table too, as it went. “So,” said Greg, smiling, after they’d sat down. “The note. I was really surprised that you—”
“Stab," replied Sherlock. “Mmm, maybe more of a cut. Can’t be sure.”
stop fantasisin’
"Oh, of course, obvious," said John, ironically, with a trace of a smile. On seeing Sherlock's child-like delight at being proved right, he forgot his irritation. It never failed to amuse him how pleased Sherlock was when his deductions were confirmed by science to steadfast unbelievers. Even when these deductions concerned the mysterious hiding places of murder weapons.
He began by thinking, slightly abstractly, that he had thought, at least, that he knew
His once pristine white shirt now looked like a clumsy graffiti artist had been at work - but with a small cup of blood instead of spray paint. Blood stained the shirt fabric in a long, shallow, curving line that started high over Sherlock's left shoulder blade, moved outwards from his spine, and then curved down his back round towards the midline again to end abruptly on his left lower rib cage. The blood wasn't too excessive though, except for one area at the point of first contact where the wound was obviously deeper, but the rest of it clearly wasn't quite so deep - there was much less blood lower down. The shirt fabric was mostly cut through but it was otherwise clean - no obvious sign of any contaminants anyway - and the blood was all very fresh. "Bloody hell," remarked John, appropriately, moving closer. "Shirt off and come into the light," he instructed, going into professional mode at the sight of blood and moving the desk over a bit, so Sherlock could stand full in what dreary light there was coming through the windows.
John held up his nail file to show her just as Agatha said, “I still don't know what the blasted thing is supposed to be!"
“Oh, that’s alright, you’re welcome, darling!” she replied cheerfully, still grinning at John over Sherlock’s head in a way which clearly read;
"Go on, Mycroft!" barked Agatha, encouragingly, now tucking eagerly into her food.
that you were back,
Meanwhile, Mycroft had been feeling increasingly awkward as Greg had been speaking.  “Ah…erm…” he fiddled with the edge of the duvet uncomfortably, trying to think of a polite excuse.
she replied smartly, adding exasperatedly for Siger’s benefit, “Seeing as I’m currently elbow deep in bloody cheese spread and prawns!” Siger chuckled at this, sounding just like Sherlock again, John thought to himself; even that little realisation making him smile inwardly.
In the shadowy dimness of the room, lit now by the full moon and the soft glow of the lamp, he was like a pale flame in the night. “You look…
desperately, in a raw beseeching plea, and he had felt the cold tears, felt the cold air, and embraced them both. He whispered "Goodbye, John," again and he jumped into the abyss.
He had stood there on the pavement for a few more minutes, as cold as stone with his shock and his anger, but
He took the remaining two steps over and stood in front of Greg, taking his hand and feeling as awkward as he had when his usual tailor hadn’t been there once, and he had had to deal with the new fellow.
“Where's Mycroft, darling?” asked Lucia quickly. John noticed with amusement Sherlock’s slight flinch at being called
Then the avalanche gradually subsided, like softly settling snow, and his hands relaxed and John breathed in deeply and sighed it out hard and repeated quietly, “Yes…Sherlock…like I loved you."
need to stop for a minute an’ all…things are getting pretty fuckin’ close for me…listenin’ to you moan…havin’ you in my mouth…” He leaned back further, looking up at Mycroft, his hands both loose now on his own thighs, his shoulder blades resting against his bed. “You’re so fuckin’ tall and slim and lovely,” he said seriously, almost awe-struck. Then, simultaneously, he lightly jerked his thumb and head behind him at his bed. “I want you on this bed ‘orizontal now so I can lie on you and feel you against me. Get them trousers off.”
saying it back. Coming from Sherlock, that awkward broken speech and that strange sentence that he had just managed to say meant very much to John indeed.
Greg grinned. “Let’s keep it that way then…shall we?” he suggested. He was smiling but his gaze was very clear and direct. His gaze said what his words didn’t.
They lost track of time for a while until Greg broke away again, needing to breathe, and - as if they hadn't stopped speaking for that marathon several-minute snog - took up the reins of the conversation and said in a rush, “Or you could just take them off?”
John snarled instantly. "Like I loved
Jilly’s two little babies!” barked Agatha amiably. She took another huge gulp of sherry then announced, “They’re due a dose at lunchtime and I'm overdue in doing it because of those blasted trains!”
He realised his phone was squawking distantly at him and he brought it up to his ear.

yourselves!’ ” Sherlock said it all like he was reciting some lines that he had learnt for a play, with a hearty emphasis on the particular words where Alex Burson had put his own hearty emphasis. There was a split second of shocked silence and then he pushed his chair back from the table loudly in a violent movement, still staring straight at John. He stood up abruptly, then shoved the chair back in place under the table and turned and stalked over to the window. He glanced out of it for no apparent reason and then turned around into John's slightly wide-eyed, stunned and frozen silence and air that had suddenly turned rather a shocked shade of blue. Sherlock tipped his head a little to indicate that there was more to come, and then he took up the reins again, but this time, he spoke in a much calmer tone. “…I then reminded him that blackmailing his daughter-in-law to sign the trust over to him wasn't
Mycroft was now sitting up fully, holding his mug cupped in both hands.  He stroked its smooth surface thoughtfully back and forth with for a moment with his thumbs. “I—I don’t want to

thought John, delirious with lust and happiness. John was so close and he could see Sherlock must be too. Sherlock had his eyes closed, his full lips parted, his sensuous mouth slightly open. He had never looked more strikingly beautiful to John as he did at that moment. He looked like an angel caught in the midst of having sex.
He surreptitiously lowered the Sunday Times and looked over the top at John. To check things were still…
great fun!"
With the scarf in his hand, he went and got Sherlock’s other present from his underwear drawer where he’d hidden it and put it in his pocket, along with the one he’d just gone out and collected. He was feeling a bit guilty now, in that he’d just blankly assumed Sherlock wouldn’t even know what the day was. Sherlock had obviously gone to so much trouble and expense to get him such a lovely gift,
she said gleefully, sounding it.
“Not to me, it doesn’t,” said Greg. He confessed, sort of. “I knew you were Sherlock’s brother before we spoke…I’d heard a lot about you…And anyway, I like a challenge…” he grinned widely as he said the last sentence.
“Well, it’s your bedroom,” replied Mycroft easily, “of course not.”
“Oh, I just did!” John snapped. “Just that - to get you back. Because I knew you didn’t want to tell me and you were being a such a dick about it. I wanted to make you swear in retaliation.
When he could speak, he managed to ask, “How many
- pretty ironic, really - the Catford cat burglar. He’d been sleeping on the ex-girlfriend’s sofa all week…Sherlock got that from the dog hairs left on her cushions, do you remember?”
But instead of explaining any of it, Sherlock came back to himself with a brief shake of his head and fluttered his hand dismissively. “Just…something…made me think of—nothing, don't worry. It’s just funny you should say that. That exact phrase you just used was the very last thing the gallery owner said to him - said to the artist - and apparently he was so outraged that his work wasn't going to be hung in what he considered to be 'the pride of place' that he slammed the phone down, apparently stormed off somewhere—"
“ ‘Moving tail only: Independent,
“Stop talking,” growled Sherlock, “and kiss me.”
"Yes, you
“Oh, Clarissa's back," she remarked, but more to herself as John wiped his feet on the doormat and Sherlock reappeared behind him.
They're basically a colourful cardboard tube with two clearly defined 'ends' and a central holding bit which contains a coloured paper hat, which is in the form of a crown (but we always call them 'paper hats', don't ask why, I don't know), a joke on a slip of paper (traditionally always a pretty bad joke), and a little toy/puzzle/useful item (or not so useful item). You all simultaneously (if possible) pull the cracker with another person, and it bursts into two pieces at this point, opening up the central chamber and thus revealing all the little things inside. They also have a little strip of paper inside which makes a 'bang/crack' sound as it rips apart. This is the 'crack' of a cracker and why they have that name!
Sherlock, the film critic, had his full and lengthy review all ready. “It was moronic anyway,” he drawled through from the bedroom.
The early part of the afternoon passed uneventfully. Due to the lack of wifi on his own laptop, Mycroft had been forced to resort to using his parents' ancient desktop computer in the study to check on some dodgy diplomatic situation in Uganda and John was in the sitting room, idly leafing through one of the few books that he had expressed an interest in receiving for Christmas and had actually received. He had yet to start reading it properly but was enjoying the easy pleasure of reading the long, rambling introduction. Sherlock had disappeared somewhere upstairs.
The man in blue glanced awkwardly over at them. “Me?” he said. The woman he was with appeared suddenly horrified and pointedly looked away from her companion to disassociate herself from the situation.
Greg smiled. “And how do you like it? I’ve got normal semi-skimmed, but my sister’s just been down, so I’m fully stocked with a few different kinds of non-diary milk an’ all, if you want any o’that?” he explained.
John almost shouted it, furious again now because Sherlock wasn’t listening and wasn’t getting it. "Because of
Siger walked ahead of John until they reached the short dark inner hallway that opened directly into the kitchen, whereupon he suddenly stepped back against the wall, and gestured for John to go through the doorway first.
"Morning," said John.

Equally compliant, the British Government set about doing as he was told too, making John feel guilty about being waited on. “No, don’t worry…I’ll do it!” said John, feeling bad as Mycroft went to the kettle.

Greg suddenly rose up on his elbow, sliding his left hand from Mycroft’s shoulder down to his ribs. He wrapped his leg around Mycroft’s again to hold him still.
in the moonlight,” murmured Mycroft, slightly overawed.
“Erm,” said John, not much of a sherry drinker, “er…no, thank you, I’d actually prefer another cup of—” and then Mycroft appeared abruptly in the doorway, in almost an echo of Sherlock’s sudden appearance a few moments before, but rather more looking as though he had been shepherded towards it and then forcibly pushed through it.
Mycroft snorted a short little involuntary laugh. All this amusement and laughing, he still could hardly believe it. He was almost shocked at himself - let alone the fact that his own family possibly wouldn’t recognise him. Meanwhile, Greg had continued. “…I’ve got real coffee on the go for me that’s nearly done, there’s plenty o’ that, and I’ve got Yorkshire tea, loads of different herbal ones or cheap Tesco red label, if you prefer tea?” Greg said, quite unaware of the earth-shattering revelations that were still going on in Mycroft’s head this morning.
"John? Hello? Hello?" Lestrade was barking on the other end of the line.

Four weeks after that, Sherlock took a risky roll across the bonnet of a large fast-moving car, in order to chase a fleeing business man whom a terrified witness had just alleged had been the one responsible for the murder of his wife. Sherlock leapt for the bonnet, meaning to skim over it and land sure-footed on the other side, but misjudged it slightly and rolled awkwardly over it, then landing hard and badly on the road. John was way behind him, but saw it all and sprinted faster, heart in mouth. He was relieved to see Sherlock get up from the road a moment later, cast an almost apologetic glance back at the driver - who was getting out of the car, yelling abuse at him - and then run on after the suspect. Though Sherlock had appeared to be unhurt, by the time they had delivered the man to the police ("Guilty," Sherlock had pronounced discretely as he handed him over to Lestrade), John could see he was suffering from the consequences of his actions now that the adrenaline level had dropped. He was stretching his neck from side to side and repeatedly rolling his shoulders.
Mycroft, surprised, replied, “Er…yes, of course. Happy St. Valentine’s day to you, too.”
you?”
Three years I've been writing this. Three years! It's been a labour of love and I've loved every minute. ❤️
Greg opened his eyes and leaned in to kiss him, laughing as he did so.
“Maybe it’s too much to ask over the festive period,” he suggested to Sherlock, about the nice murder. “Everyone’s probably quite busy…” But something Siger had said had caught his attention. “Sorry Siger, what did you just say? You just called it the Old Year’s Night? What’s that? I’ve never heard it called that before!”
Sherlock smiled his little sideways smile. “Mmmm. Well, it was a close call, I can tell you.  I was very nearly christened Sherringford,” he said, and paused, waiting for John’s reaction.
he said again, as he had in Constantine’s, once more feeling amused by the strangeness of his use of the word and the action. They sipped their drinks, enjoying the scent and the full, complex taste; heather and honey and gently smoky ripe, dark fruit. Greg leaned back against the counter and closed his eyes briefly in appreciation as he swallowed. “Ooh, thats good,” he remarked quietly with evident satisfaction. Mycroft hadn't needed to see that expression on his face and hear him murmur those words to know it was his favourite - he had already known by the amount left in the bottle, and its position on the shelf - but for other, more personal reasons, it was absolutely wonderful to behold both nonetheless. He didn’t say a word to himself about what he was doing, but he filed them away carefully for private quiet contemplation later.
Sherlock was struggling with this, but he had realised recently that not only did he need John's praise like other people needed food and water, something had woken up in him - something that had been long dormant. Something had been switched on, been ignited with a slow burn. And now he couldn't switch it off or snuff it out.
Sherlock groaned quietly, indicating a family joke which was about to be explained. Again. Siger totally ignored him on this too. “I’m glad you asked, John!” he said, his pleasure at the imminent re-telling very evident.
"Managed to block the blade. Mostly. Didn't realise he was armed," said Sherlock.
“I will, thank you…just give me a moment…” he replied.
Sherlock was thinking. He was sitting in his armchair, pretending to read the Sunday Times, but what he was actually doing was letting his eyes glaze over at the newsprint and he was thinking. He had walked into the room needing to think about what had been on his mind this morning when he woke up, and been about to lie down on the sofa and think properly, but then he realised as he stepped towards it, that if he did that, John might ask what he was thinking about and he didn't want to tell John that he was thinking about him. As John himself would have put it, for this he really needed to "act normal." So, mid step, he had changed direction abruptly from towards the sofa to towards his armchair and had picked up the paper that John had laid on its arm for him, already opened to the obituary pages, and had sat down. John was in his own armchair, sipping his coffee and reading The Lancet, and he was being quiet. Dust motes were gently dancing their usual slow waltz in the sunbeams slanting in through the windows, and these were, in their turn, creating two rectangular pools of slightly dusty warmth on the worn carpet. There was no case on. It was peace personified.
Greg's smile widened at the description. “Righto. I’ll bring it up…stay there!” he said, and with a smile, he went off to make it. He resumed the whistling as he went back downstairs, and as Mycroft was hearing it from the beginning of the song again, suddenly his mind helpfully placed the tune. ‘Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy’ by Queen - one of his father’s favourite bands. Mycroft closed his eyes and smiled at the coincidence.
one in his presence. He wondered if the total divine-ness of Gregory Lestrade could possibly get any more so.
“Let me put some more of my mince pies in,” said Siger, stuffing his phone back in his pocket and moving to do so. He meant about putting them back in the oven for a minute to warm up.
John dropped the accent and hastened to explain. “It means, a wet and damp winter…well,
detached-psycho-analyst expression on, and then he leaned forward and put his elbows on the table and steepled his thumbs and fingers under his nose and chin and stared at John with narrowed eyes and suddenly his eyes widened and John could see his

fantasising?” he said, and then he thought desperately, ’Please don’t stop!’ His mind didn’t seem to be working properly. He squeezed Greg with both his thighs.
"Mmmm...Well, yeah, ok," agreed John. There was a pause. "What do you think, then?"
…it was pretty elementary stuff, really," said John. "I think he had some James Bond aspirations,” he added, and then he realised and started to smile. He pointed at Sherlock accusingly with an amused look on his face. “And
The paper began to lower to his lap, as his hands that were holding it began to lower themselves to his lap, and he saw John come into his line of sight over the top of his newspaper. John was looking at him oddly. Sherlock realised he must have had a very strange look on his face because the look John was currently giving him back was slightly concerned. "What's up?" asked John, innocently.
who’s boss...” purred Mycroft as Greg landed where he wanted him, a wry saucy grin on his face.
So; Sherlock realised. And he kept his new knowledge hidden. Even his subconscious shut up about it after that, because it had got what it wanted; he had
low and deep and rough at the back of his throat through gritted teeth, and the way he said it crashed into Mycroft’s auditory memory palace, flung itself about and knocked down walls. Greg thrust himself hard against Mycroft in an exhilarating burst of pleasure. He did this three times more, building up a rhythm again before Mycroft grasped Greg’s shoulders and held him still to stop him. “Wait,” he gasped urgently,
thought Mycroft, looking down, delving further into his pudding, feeling Greg’s eyes on him all the time.
like you.” The whole thing simply rocked Mycroft’s world. He felt all at once, dizzy with desire, and with a deep, delicious clench of his stomach, found he was suddenly - embarrassingly - rather hot under the collar. Greg’s hand, which had been resting on the tablecloth, slid over and his fingers just touched Mycroft’s where they rested on the base of his wine glass. Mycroft had a hard time keeping his composure at that, but he maintained it and merely smiled in an encouraging way. Greg took this as the ‘yes’ that it was and moved his fingers up to lightly cover Mycroft’s. Now they were holding the base of the glass together, but somehow it didn't feel foolish. To Mycroft it was just…
To deflect it, he launched into an immediate defensive attack. He flung his hand up in the air and banged it back on the desk dramatically, as a distraction. “Oh,
As John was getting his jacket on to leave, the poetry book slid out of the inner pocket and bumped down onto the floor. Feeling like a fan at a convention, John picked it up awkwardly and looked at Gabriella with a sheepish grin. “Can I ask you, er..." and he held it up and waved it a bit.
"He played along at first. I went into the walk-in freezer to get something that he asked me to get and he came after me, I only heard him behind me at the last second because of the noise of the freezer engines but I wasn't quick enough to avoid him completely. That's why it goes off sideways, I bent and twisted away from the blade."
Sherlock’s bedroom was nothing like John had thought it might be. John had imagined - when he’d even thought about it, that was, which had only really been since he’d come upstairs to see where he would be sleeping - that Sherlock’s childhood bedroom would be vaguely like his bedroom at Baker Street; not exactly
Blunt, unadorned and as passionately honest as Gregory’s words were, to Mycroft they made the most eloquent of love sonnets. Mycroft laughed a little and then sighed in rapture. “There’s nothing I want more right now than to do that,” he replied.
able to look up and say the next words directly to Sherlock, looking Sherlock directly in the eye, because he realised that for this part, he absolutely had to. “So do I, Sherlock,” he said clearly, "I feel...I feel differently about you, too. I think I always have.” Neither of them were making any sense whatsoever, but that didn't matter. It didn't matter at all. Now John knew. Mary had been right.
John could not deal with that question right now.
, then? Why didn’t you just say so?”
Sherlock hissed a breath in through his teeth with pain, bending his body down and to the left carefully in order to use gravity to help drop the coat from his shoulder. "Caught by a maniac wielding a knife," he replied, more calmly than a sentence containing a combination of words like that demanded to be said.
chance.
He stopped and froze, his thumb halfway down the frame.
John couldn't drink his coffee. He got up carefully from the table, poured a glass of water, and went back to bed, where he drank half the glass of water in one go and then put it down carefully on his bedside table. Then he just as carefully got into bed again and pulled the duvet slowly up over his ear. He could only lay on his right side, as the bump on the left side made it too painful to lay that way, and it was so sore that he could feel it when he laid on his back, even when he turned his head to the right. Because of this, he was lying facing the window, his back to the door, and he only realised that Sherlock was in his doorway when Sherlock pushed the door softly all the way open. John heard the familiar soft creak of it opening and sensed Sherlock was just standing there, but John wasn't sure what to do or what to say, so he did nothing and said nothing. He just lay still and waited to see what Sherlock was going to say. But, like him, Sherlock didn't say a single word. He came over and sat softly down on the edge of John's bed, making the mattress dip under the extra weight. His back where he sat down was pressed against John's.
… Carefully, almost reverentially, Greg finished gently opening his belt, popped the fly button and slowly unzipped his trousers. He slid them down over Mycroft’s hips slightly with the backs of his fingers, caressing the curved bones of his pelvis lightly with both palms as he did it. “Oh
which evaded him repeatedly, and there had been a knock at the door downstairs, which he ignored because Mrs. Hudson was in. But the knocker kept knocking even when he bellowed, “Mrs. Hud-
And that was all that mattered.
John was in the middle of drafting out a referral letter for a patient whom he needed to send to see a consultant. He sighed.
Sherlock was also barefoot in his pyjamas and dressing gown, but looking far more elegant than John, and he was drinking coffee and standing by the window, looking out at the street. He looked so decadent somehow, thought John. It was the way he carried himself, everything about him was luxury.
, he thought.
Sherlock wanted to clarify it so there could be absolutely no mistake, and so he just said the words, finally, after all these years, and what he said was; "I feel…
did you know that?" he barked.
It wasn't a trick, was it? He set you up on a bloody date…with me! And look how that turned out? …A total disaster!” he said the last three words softly, teasingly. He grinned and moved closer to stand right in front of Mycroft, turning quickly to dump the nearly finished cigarette neatly into the ashtray-beer-can between them.  Now he had both hands free and so he slid both his empty hands simultaneously up Mycroft’s defensively crossed arms to his shoulders. “Look what he's done to you,” Greg said softly. “‘Ain’t this terrible?…” Greg was grinning now, his hands beginning to move soothingly up and down to stroke Mycroft’s upper arms. “…Set you up a date with a hot copper who really bloody fancies you…” here he leaned in and lifted his chin to kiss Mycroft’s set and stony lips. “
