"Wait, Dean, of course, I want to mate with you," the alpha stopped his train of thoughts and Dean felt his stomach go crazy or something. "I just didn't think you did. At least not that soon."
“I can’t believe I am carrying a non-human being,” the alien lady muttered while the three men stared at the photo. They already seemed to have forgotten about her, thought.
The older hunter had the suspicion, that Cas had only been speaking aloud because there were other people around since he had been able to communicate with their daughter when she had still been in the womb.
Her family was perfect the way it was and she would protect them from any teasing if she must.
What if something had happened to him? Without his consent, dread settled in Deans stomach.
They followed the plan nonetheless and send the guy home after he had forgotten them. Then they decided to take shifts watching the flat, until they would meet up with Glynn the next morning to let her in on the supernatural world. The only things that happened in these few hours were, that the roommate returned from work and Dean drove himself crazy with his own thoughts.
“I don’t
“Maybe we should go somewhere else”, Sammy piped up, watching the very sparse traffic with a worried look on his face. But perhaps he was looking out for angels or demons or anything else that wanted them dead.
Well, Dean remembered masturbating a lot more the last few days, but he thought it was because he finally left the hospital and didn't have constant company anymore. And if one calculated for a second, it was precisely one month after his last heat triggered by their first meeting and hadn't he learned back in health class in school, that freshly mated alphas and omegas went into heat and rut respectively at the same time and far more frequent than the usual four times a year. But why didn't he...
Zachariah looked thoroughly pissed now but made no effort to stop his nephew. What was his mistake.
“Hey, is this one free?” the older Winchester asked and the girl turned her whole body to him smiling.
Dean tried to think of innocent things. Sheep. One sheep, two sheep, three sheep.
Dean just furrowed his brows; they had agreed that Crowley would talk first, and the omega still wanted to find out what this weird feeling was. Something shifted in the group behind Zack.
“Okay,” Dean said a little breathlessly after some minutes. Then he remembered something. “Then what about Mia?”
“Well, it was weird, I knew something was not like in the romantic Hollywood movies, but I didn’t have anything to compare it to.”
“So, you are saying,” Sam interrupted Dean’s down spiralling thoughts, “that, that Glynn has these pains means, that she is going to die for sure?”
It had been sent to Cas old house, that they still frequently looked after but without the uncertainty already would have sold.
She brought them to her ancestor’s library with the insistence, that they would never infiltrate her or her family’s life ever again. Dean crossed his fingers behind his back, just to be sure.
Next one will be epilogue, and then it's done!
“You won't, okay, Cas? We're still us, ya know? We’ll figure it out together.”
Sam sighted loudly, while apparently trying to rely his tense shoulders. “Yeah, let’s get some food. But please stop dying for a weak now okay?” He thought I would say no, Dean thought. Why did nobody believe in his will to live?
Well, maybe more moose sized, Dean thought as he now slower limped towards his brother, who held the suspect down with his whole-body weight.
“She also said, she sets me free,” Cas said blue eyes full of adoration and wonder. How could this wonderful man ever like me, Dean thought, but voicing his thoughts as: ”Cas, you don’t have to…” he was quickly cut off by the press of the other's lips to his.
On the other side was a three-centimeter shorter, dark-haired, blue-eyed man with a very sleepy looking infant in his arms.
As the other didn’t pull back after an appropriate time for a man-hug, the hunter allowed himself to take a deep intake of that scent he had thought about earlier. It was just as astonishing, as he remembered it, some kind of honey like smell but triggering the same feelings you get when you stand in the woods after a heavy summer rain.
“If you don’t give her willingly,” the voice whispered because of course, you could hear magical-in-head sounds, no matter what noise there was else, “We will have to come and get her.”
After that, Cas had let his hand fall from her head and settled it on top of Dean’s, which had been laying quite conveniently next to him on the seat. The older hunter had had the urge to pull back, to store his feelings back into this little box they had been in for the last who-knows-how-many years.
“You stayed?” the Winchester asked to get her to finish the story.
“What do you want with her?” Dean asked to buy time after he had watched how the demon came to a halt, only to realize, that there were more of them approaching behind him.
“No, you can’t,” Zack all but screamed out, all of his previous calm demeanour gone at the foresight of his failure.
to do this, uncle,” Castiel said, turning towards Zachariah. “But you left me no other choice.”
“You want to appeal to paragraph forty-nine,” Crowley exclaimed before anybody else could say anything. “If the current leader is too weak or mentally compromised to lead…” He left the last words hanging in the air, but even Dean got what he was saying. Cas could get rid of his uncle for good.
So he had contemplated, all the way back home if he should still go to Crowley's diner today and visit his beloved Baby. The 1967 Chevrolet Impala he had inherited from his dad at the age of twenty, surely held more than memories of a childhood on the road, but also a hidden trunk with a few of Dean's favourite weapons.
"That means if that were true, you would have been the reason for this awful, long heat," Dean said as realisation swapped over him like a big wave, and he regretted saying the words out loud, the moment he was finished speaking. Damn him, and his first act then think scheme.
"You-" he started but was interrupted by an especially hard thrust, "you need to bite me as soon as it pops, alright?" Cas just nodded but was otherwise quiet, burying his face in Dean's neck again. As the omega pulled him closer by tangling his fingers in the other's hair and his alpha let out a moan, that was shaking him in his core.
"It's a mostly biological thing, I think," the dark-haired man continues with furrowed brows at Dean's vague answer. "It happens when two people, an alpha and an omega fit together perfectly by nature and their bodies react to it without their conscious consent."
“Please take my uncle outside,” Dean heard Cas utter towards two men behind him, and they obliged immediately. Zachariah, of course, didn’t leave without a protest, but as soon as he was gone, a noticeable amount of tension left the room.
The Winchester neither saw how people tried to get out of the way of the falling lamps nor did he recognise where the shootings were coming from since his vision got blurry for a few seconds. He must have hit his head pretty bad.
Sam nodded and Dean deepened his frown. He could feel Cas gaze one him but preferred to stare at the table, so the others wouldn’t know, that he didn’t quite know, what report was spoken about. But of course, the angel guessed his train of thoughts immediately.
They spend almost all of the following day in bed, only getting up to pee and eat some breakfast, Dean had made entirely naked. Cas had watched him the whole time, and at one time he sent a groan through their bond, that made the other drop the spatula and turn around. The eggs nearly burned right then right there, but it was all in all one of the best days Dean ever remembered having.
“Hello Dean,” a familiar gravelly voice said inside his head. For a second, he was back inside the diner again, sitting opposite of an angel pouring unholy amounts of sugar in his coffee. Then Sam came back into his view, extending an arm to help the other hunter up and of the table.
So, please stay for the sequel if you'd like to; I really need to continue writing about this lovely family and their road in between heaven and hell. I own nothing as usual :D
“Okay, well, she left for grandmas with the bus in front of our flat, so she should be one town over already. Do you want me to give you the address? It’s three hours from here.” Dean made a choking sign, before his brother could even think of going there.
"I don't know," he admitted the truth. "I thought, I mean, I li- like him and I made a deal with Crowley to get out, but what if like in five years, he starts to think I'm boring or I do something stupid or..."
His own way meant, that, after he had been scolded enough by Crowley and had helped some others with the planning of a heist, he wouldn't be part of, he departed to the exact same Gas'nSip he had robbed just over a week ago.
“Here you go,” Glynn said at setting two cups in front of the hunters. No wait, Cas was… ah, whatever. “Any progress?” The content of the tea cups smelled weird, but they took it anyways; Cas even nipped on his.
The older Winchester really wanted to pray to Cas as shit went down and Sam got separated from him, but refrained from it, because the guy probably had better stuff to do. With those dicks, who called themselves angels for example.
They had talked for the rest of the evening about everything and nothing. They had exchanged numbers and then they had gone home. Each of them to their own home.
“I’m fine,” Dean said automatically. “I’d like to talk to you about Cas, though.”
Wait did that mean, that every other pair of true mates had mated except for these two?
When it came to be Cas turn to tell about his family, Dean got a little distracted by the way the other's lips moved and how he folded his legs under himself, not wearing any shoes. What he caught was that the alpha had a gigantic family, but a lot of them had died a few years ago in a car crash while Cas had been in college, what had made him decide to come back here. He had one brother left, Gabriel, who didn't like to be bound to one place and a sister Anna, who was still in high school and who he tried to support now by working in the fuel station.
"Keep me updated," Sam hastily fit in before Dean ended the phone call and stared at the device for some time. Maybe he should at least talk to Cas. Maybe he just wanted to hear that deep voice again.
The baby was coming.
“Now, as you all know, I’m not born in this business,” Cas addressed everybody again, and Dean could feel, that the encounter had left him tired and sad. He really just wanted to lay in bed with him and cuddle forever. “Therefore, I want to appeal to paragraph sixty-six, b, that states, that I can name a permanent leader in my absence. Which will hopefully be for a very long time.”
Dean reached out with his arms and Cas showed him how to hold the baby close to his chest.
“Why didn’t you tell me earlier?” Dean asked bluntly, because yes, he was very bad at all the feels stuff, but he didn’t care right now. “I mean, I know this isn’t something you tell your neighbor, but I thought the both of us were something like friends by now.”
The three hunters (and hunters in training) gathered in a corner to discuss, what they thought about the story.
Sam, who had also joined them by now, looked around their heads into Dean’s jacked with this expression he always had when he was examining an especially interesting supernatural object or being.
“Dean,” he started and why did the hunter feel a little bit warmer at mention of his name by a certain gravelly voice? “I am sorry that I didn’t ‘drop by’ today, but you seemed to be occupied, so I didn’t want to disturb you.”
His greasy fingers tapped an unknown rhythm on Cas engine while he waited.
He smiled.
As the angel was finished, the older hunter handed their daughter over to him and reminded him how to hold her when fed.
“I think your brother will leave without his arm, before he leaves the car,” the angel muttered, lowering himself into the backseat as the last person and Dean started the engine.
“Wait, Dean, hold on.” There were some muffled sounds in the background and the sound of a phone being set on speaker. “Did I just understand you correctly? You, my big brother Dean, want to talk to me about your feelings? For the second time already? What did this guy do to you?”
Suddenly the doorbell rang, and Dean's heartbeat picked up on the speed. Okay relax, he thought while scanning the room one last time. He had set up some candles, after arguing about it with himself for half an hour and he had cooked some paste he hoped Cas liked. What if the guy was allergic to something?
“Shut the hell up, Rufus,” Bobby griped.
Dean nodded, grinning back at him as he stepped back.
“Then Bobby and I will go to Naoki’s,” Rufus added.
As Doug locked the doors, Dean turned to Cas, pouting.
“Uh...yeah,” Dean said, frowning.  “Guess you are psychic.”
The look in Dean’s eyes was pretty clear.  More.
Sam stared at the two men in amusement, starting to grin.
“The town,” Sam assured.  Too bad his assured look cracked quicker than thin ice under lava boots.
She nodded, her cheeks blushing.  “It’s a...we’re...”
Dean was laughing again.  “I’m so sorry, man!  You need back-up?  I got your back, dude!”
Gabe looked back out the window as the sound of another car could be heard.  “Now Garth’s here!  What the hell?  Is there a fucking picnic I forgot about?”
Cas didn’t give a shit either.
“Do you want me to drive you to the hospital?” Sam asked, seeing how scared she was.
“You know, if you complain about something, say something positive!  That way you don’t look like you’re a grouch.”
“Yes.  A family heirloom,” Melanie affirmed.  “She had it in a lock box at the bank...and when I went to get it today, the box was empty.”
****************************************************
“No, but Dean scared the shit out of me by his car.  He’ll be down soon.”
“This Frank guy is good.  Bobby swears by him.”
“Maybe not,” Sam said, “what kind of tea did he have?”
“Wow,” Cas mouthed.  He went to the coffee pot, helping himself to a cup of coffee, then silently slid a chair out and sat down.
Their ‘stint’ in Charming Acres (as Dean referred to it) or ‘during their real-life episode of the Twilight Zone’ (as Cas called it) was a shared past they could not deny.  It had shaped them in some ways.  It had certainly made them both mistrustful of people that smiled too much.
Dean shook it off for now.  “How’s your day going?”
“That’s what I thought,” Dean muttered back.
“Really?  They were awfully snippy toward each other,” Cas recalled.  “He seems to be at the center of a business venture to open a strip mall in town with the Smiths, the Frielings, and the Bermans.  But it didn’t seem to be going well.”
Memory of his butt being grabbed made chills run through his body.  Alone with thoughts, he couldn’t figure out if it was fear or lust.
Charlie wiggled with enjoyment.
Jody joined her girls at the table, all of them talking in hushed voices.
They settled in for a lazy afternoon of laying in the sun and swimming.  By late afternoon, Castiel was able to put his towel in the shade and get some sleep.
Sam laughed.  “Damn, Crowley!  You look down-right approachable!”
Sam and Cas looked to the kitchen window.  “No,” Cas said quietly, “we see them too.”  They got up, heading to the window.  They couldn’t see anything but the side of the Frieling house, red and blue lights flashing against it.  They exchanged a look before both headed to the front door and stepped out onto the porch.  A police car sat in the Frieling’s driveway, lights finally going off.
Castiel fought a gasp.  The sudden care and attention were making his mind shut down.
They did a quick drive around Charming Acres and settled for Good Graces Cafe.  Neither had eaten there yet and it seemed like their best bet for a sit-down breakfast.
“He died?” Rufus asked, shocked.
Holy fuck wow.  Dean felt his eyes go as wide as saucers as Cas’ did the same, Sam choked, and Gabe (who was hugging Donna hello) laughed loud and off beat, saying entirely too loud, “Man that drive!  How ‘bout that drive, huh, Sammy?”
“Twenty-six,” Dean added, still annoyed she had a higher count than him.
Dean looked surprised.  “You?”
“You drove all the way from Alaska?”
Dean went in, some sort of comment on the edge of his lips as he quirked a grin and went inside.
She grinned wide, bobbing with a knowing nod.  “You fellas want some fries or something to go with those shakes?”
“Have a seat,” Gabe said, holding a hand out.  Sam folded himself into the tight spot.
“That doesn’t sound too bad,” Sam said softly.  “How often do you go there?”
Ding, ding!  They were in.
“That’s kinda...crazy,” Gabe said.  “How does that happen?  Was it gory?”
“Wait...Lucky Charms is in on this?” Dean asked.
“I can hardly wait to use it!  Thanks, Dean!” Claire grinned,  giving him a wink.
“No,” Castiel huffed.  His leg was on fire from Dean’s touch.  His stomach was surging with butterflies.
Don looked regretful.
Cas waved, catching her attention as she turned.  She waved back, sitting on the hood of her car.
Cas tilted his head, looking at him.  “Yeah?”
It took Castiel’s breath away.  The finale boomed with brighter lights and louder bangs.  Castiel gasped softly and Dean ventured only the slightest, tasting him, their tongues meeting.  Castiel tipped his head and Dean plunged further, his hand fisting the short hair on the back of Castiel’s head.
He picked out several and took them to the clerk to pay for them.  As he laid them on the glass counter, he noticed the jewelry below the glass.  The Emporium had some nice pieces, but he had little interest in jewelry.  The man at the register gave him his change and receipt, plus a flyer.
Sam jumped to his feet.  “I checked the calendar this morning!  It was empty!”
“When?” Gabe wheezed from where he was pinned down.
Castiel’s secret crush was crippling.  Dean just kept getting better and better looking.  It was brutal.  The moment at the old gas station had eventually faded.  Dean’s attention had dialed back to its usual light teasing.
“Let’s do this!” Dean clapped, rubbing his hands together.
“Are you?” Castiel barely whispered.
Our boys are doing what they are good at.  Only this time they have a whole support system to work with.  I hope you enjoyed!
“I figured we could just walk,” Cas began.
“Thought that was you,” Gabe said.  “Whatcha doin’?”
“You could come have a drink with us,” Castiel offered, keeping up his brave streak.
Three weeks after Hael had gone with her sister, the news had apparently spread and Dean watched from his new favorite spot behind the curtains as two elderly people approached Cas old house. Said bed haired guy was sitting on the couch, Mia next to him and Mary in his arms. Billy meanwhile was being fed by Jo in the armchair.
"Hello, Dean," he said in that deep voice of his, and the addressed tried to scoot back on the bed for the following conversation to be more comfortable. That was apparently not possible without flinching which in turn got Cas to get up and bring this heavenly scent of his closer.
He dug right in, both hands on the other man’s cheeks, feeling his stubble scratch at his palms. Even though the blue-eyed man’s lips were chapped most of the time, they felt even softer than Dean had imagined. And Dean had imagined a lot.
“So here is the thing. The babies came out two days ago, and I want you to meet William,” he lowered her down so she could touch his head briefly and she tried to repeat “Billam” at what every-body chuckled, “and Mary.” He also lowered her to the small baby bed in which normally both of the small humans slept and that was now only inhabited by the baby girl. Mia’s small hands gripped the cloth of the yellow blanket to see better and Dean could see a smile tugging at her lips.
“Dean, I don’t know, if you know this, but a student teacher relationship is something illegal,” He deadpanned and Deans grin grew wider. “Besides, I’m not interested.”
After they passed the border to Kansas, Dean remembered for a split second, that they didn’t really clean up the church and what the priest might think, if there were two sets of wings burned into his changing room. “Sakristy,” a voice said and the hunter chuckled.
Now it was Sam’s turn to knit his brows together. He didn’t seem quite satisfied with the direction their conversation had taken. As if he had thought it would be easier to dance around the topic and still talk about it somehow.
“Castiel has been talking a lot about you.” She smiled understandingly now, and Dean felt his cheeks heat up in embarrassment. “He has been visiting you in the hospital for a few weeks now, and I got curious,” she explained and shrugged. “But he hasn’t been in, at least a few days, asked me to take a few of his shifts. I can give you his address though.”
"Dean," the omega said without thinking and immediately scrunched up his face. He had told his real first name, and that was dangerous. Everything about him was dangerous for the other.
Involuntary, Dean started to grin at that and was grateful, that his back was turned to his angel. The angel.
“Hey,” Sam said to Dean from his other side on the second sofa. Jess was occupied with reading a bridal magazine and Dean grinned. “I think your wife already likes him,” the younger man teased and his brother shoved him in the side.
Well, you couldn’t be disappointed when you’re dead, a tiny voice in his head reminded him, but he tried to quiet it down. He really needed to get a hold on his thoughts, since he didn’t want his mate to worry. His mate.
He laid down next to her but couldn't close his eyes and look away, even as Sam left the room and Cas laid down facing him. She was so tiny, and he would give his life to protect her. But what if she was the one she needed protection of the most?
Cas just chuckled at first. Was he making fun of the omega? But he sounded so genuinely happy, that Dean couldn't find himself being offended.
“Soo, whoever of the gentlemen is the father, could come over here and hold the hand of our brave mother, what do you think?” the doctor asked and startled the hunters a little bit with that.
“What, what… what?” Dean stammered as soon as he had found his sense of speaking again. “Why would it be your fault?”
"Ahh, Crowley," he spat out, seemingly unharmed from their last encounter but definitely pissed. "And the Winchester boy, I really had worried for a second, that you had died there."
“Yeah,” the older hunter smiled a little bit but didn’t want to let the younger of the hook just like that. “But what exactly do you mean.”
“Maybe she ist staying somewhere outside of town”, the Sasquatch remarked when they left the bar. It was getting dark, and the older hunter really wanted to lay down or eat something or do both simultaneously.
“Well, it seemed practical back then,” he said lamely and grinned at Mia, who had stuffed her face with mashed potatoes and smiled shyly back at him.
“What,” his brother asked and scrunched his face at the others madness.
With that Cas turned his face into the morning sun, probably enjoying its heat. It was a beautiful day, the older hunter had to admit, but it would be nothing without his family around him. Speaking of.
They would have to care for a small alive human being in a short time and it was written on all their faces, that they rather liked to face a monster in a direct fight than eighteen years, and probably all of their lives in constant fear.
After having put up all the protection, the bunker was capable of, a quite odd sight greeted Dean as he entered the war room. The big, table, that usually stood right in the middle of the room was pushed aside, in order to make space for all the blankets the others could probably have found in such a short time.
The cold was made of some kind of metal with ornaments all over it, and there was a pentagram carved into the wooden handle. It didn't seem too unusual until Dean opened the container for the bullets and revealed eight bullet-shaped, transparent vessels, filled with a yellow liquid. At closer inspection, Dean could make out the words 'Heaven's water' at the bottom of each. As he had no idea what that meant, he decided to stuff the vessels back in and hide the colt in the trunk again, to have a talk with Crowley. The King of Hell sometimes was an annoying drama queen, but he seemed to know a lot about things he shouldn't know anything about.
Dean heart multiple people in the room screech but most of his thoughts were on Cas and their daughter. He hoped they had made it out unharmed and were far away by now.
Dean watched as a machine next to the soon to be mother of their child came to life and a monitor lit up with blue and black colours, like he had seen them on previous ultra sound pictures.
“Hey, it’s all right, I’m here,” Dean said in a soothing voice, cutting off her umbilical cord and clamping it like his brother explained to him. Then he was handed his daughter, wrapped her in one of the blankets laying aside and closed his leather jacket over her small form laying at his chest.
Crouching behind a pile of old cupboards and stuff, Dean noticed his boss, who sat on a chair about 30 feet away from him and was surrounded by angels with big, impressive looking guns. The omega searched for his gang mates for a second until he found a few unconscious on the floor and a few being held hostage by other angels.
“Fuck’em and go?” Dean asked, still a bit unsure, if he was ready to joke jet.
“’And in the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents’,” Sam recited what was written underneath the picture.
Sam uttered his agreement and the both of them left the room and Dean alone to dwell in his own thoughts.
The alpha named Castiel caught up with him as soon as he left the shop and he had to admit that a tiny part of him would have been disappointed if he hadn't.
That couldn’t be it, Dean tried to think through the thick clouds in his head as he found himself on the floor, head pressed down, knees tight to the chest. He had no idea how he had gotten down there nor how to get up again.
"Alright, I quote: True Mates is a pair of an alpha and his omega, for who the act of mating is unavoidable. The two of them will feel a great pull towards each other, blah, blah. Ah, this sounds like it: Within certain proximity, the pair will always be able to scent each other, even if disguised. Upon being mated, each party will always be able to locate the other and in rare cases know about their wellbeing. Eh, well, and this one: As soon as the omega smells their true mate for the first time, they will know, since they will want to please the other in any possible way. The alpha will know because the omega will listen to whatever they say immediately." Dean swallowed hard.
Cas nodded in resignation. „Alright,“ he said, bunched up his coat and used it as a pillow against the window. And if Deans eyes closed after their daughter had fallen asleep and he sunk onto his angel's shoulder, not even Sam was going to mention it.
It was as if somebody had flipped a switch. Being gentle at first, Dean found himself unable to hold back any of the bottled up tension after a few seconds.
Dean noticed now, that two people were holding Cas by his shoulders, even if they probably didn't have to. Cas would do anything for his family, just as Dean would.
The moment Dean wanted to reply with questions about where they would put the baby’s crib or how it should go to school one day when everybody would be chasing them, a dark silhouette scurried across the street about ten meters in front of them.
"Because he is my uncle."
Cas’ eyes watered.  “Goldy died today.”
“Yes, but you don’t walk away from trouble either!”
“I was thinking about getting a room here too, but this place kinda weirds me out.  Your door wasn’t even locked.”
Gabe was sitting at the table with Sheila, and Cas could hear Marion humming in her bathroom and talking to herself.
“Eighteen,” Dean boasted for him.
“Don’t worry about them.  They all think they’re sooo cool.”
“It’s black,” Dean smirked back, shaking his head as he went inside to get another cup.
Dean thought he might die.  Sam looked like he might short circuit.
Gabe leaned forward, drilling his eyes into Dean expectantly.
“Yeah.  The more I see how good our life is, how functional we are, the more it seems possible to not ruin someone by bringing them into it, ya know?”
Gabe raised both eye brows.  Unwilling to fill in the blanks for him.
“Yeah?” Gabe chuckled.  “Was it gross?  Was it okay?  Are you in looooove?”
“Tessa.  She’s having a pool party.  You should come.”
“Is that the place with the giant milkshake in front?” Cas asked.
“I was just getting ready to take Jack for a walk, but he pooped out, literally, and now he’s sleeping.”
The bride, Ava, came in around eleven, with her straight brown hair prettily styled into a French twist.  She seemed to run the whole family, her mother busily taking care of everything.  Her best friend, a guy named Brady, stayed by her side the entire time.
“Assimilated from where?” Sam asked.
She smirked.  “Well, don’t say I didn’t warn ya.  Keep hangin’ around with Bobby Singer and you’ll be knee deep in trouble before I collect my next paycheck.”
Dean walked over to the coffee pot, unfazed and most likely unaware of how his handsome face and lean build could effect anyone.
Very quietly, Cas whispered, “Her name is Donna Hanscum and she’s new to town.  I spoke with her this morning at work and pretty much gave it away that the call was from me.”
“Are you okay?” Sully half cried, half whispered, looking up at him with terror-stricken puppy dog eyes.
Luc’s grin spread.  “I’ll find you at your locker.”
Sam caught up to Castiel, grabbing his arm.  Castiel took the hint, at least letting Sam open the door and go in first.
Castiel groaned with a pleading lilt.
Dean groaned back, stroking harder.  “You better come quietly.”
“Yeah.”
Cas woke the next morning, rolling over to fit himself more tightly against Dean.  He looked up when Dean ran a slow hand down his back.  He could tell he was awake.
Cas leaned forward.  “Settling it...how?  Fighting or fucking?”
“Ha!” Jody laughed.  “Don’t get your hopes up too high there, Brandy.”
The nurse’s aide headed in the opposite direction, getting back to work.  Gabe headed for his friend.
Oh God, he recognized her as soon as she grinned and said something.  He had met with her a few weeks ago about her up-coming wedding in the fall.  This was bound to end well.
Gabe rolled his eyes, crossing his arms over his chest.  “That’s fine.  I’ll use my cell phone.  Ya know, like the rest of us here in the twenty-first century.”
***************************
“What?” Dean asked incredulous.  “How would you know anything about them?”
“Marion says Wayne Whittaker is a leprechaun,” Gabe added, taking a fragile looking cup of tea from Marion.
Cas looked so fucking amused with him.
Sam, already sweaty in his shorts and t-shirt, squatted beside him.  “Sure is.”  He sat the cup on the floor and leaned down to kiss him.
“God,” Cas panted, canting back into him again.  “I want you to fuck me.”
“I gotta go.  See you tomorrow guys.”
Dean’s head dropped back to his pillow with a groan.  “And I suck at pillow talk.”
Castiel flipped the lid up and squeezed some into his palm.
Her eyes narrowed, studying him.  “And the...Castiel?”
“Oh stop,” she giggled, waving him off again.
“The girl, Brandy, said Jody told her about us.”
“Huh,” Dean said flatly, holding his comments back.
“I did,” Cas grinned, his eyes steadily on Dean.
When they had met at Sam’s graduation, Dean was insanely adorable, bragging and so evidently proud of his brother.  At the time, Cas was traveling a lot and though he found Dean incredibly attractive, he had no intention of hooking up with someone who might someday be family.
He wrapped his arms around Dean as he did the same and kissed him again.  And again.  And again.
“And it’s only one page long?” Dean asked, patting Sam on the shoulder.  “Dude.  You need to work on your observation skills.”
Dean’s fingers ran a soothing circle around his bare shoulder.  “I guess we’ll see.”
And just like clockwork, just as Dean didn’t think he could keep his hips to himself any longer, Cas pulled away, giving him one last chaste kiss before lying back with a happy grin.
A bathroom counter with double sinks was at the furthest part of the room, one door leading to a closet, and opposite it, a door that led to the bathroom.  The floor was white vinyl with blue stars in the worn pattern that had seen better days.  Cas flipped the light on and heard Dean give a little moan.  He turned, entranced with the sound, giving him a quizzical look.
“Yeah, Maggie and I are going through a tough time,” Don admitted quietly, looking down.  “Trial separation.  It’s temporary.”  He looked back up at them, maintaining his calm demeanor.  “Sometimes you grow apart.  It’s no one’s fault.”
“He’s-“
Castiel assured Ms. Dowling for the third time that he and Dean were not interested in dessert.  She only relented in her offering of a large Jell-O mold of red and yellow in the shape of a ring when he explained they would be going to Harrington’s for milkshakes.
Dean rubbed a hand along his neck.  “Just got home.  I fell asleep at a friend’s.”
“We gotta move the body,” Gabe said again, Dean nodding in agreement.
Castiel frowned.  No wonder the residents did not care for him.  From what he had ascertained so far, the aides, nurses, and other staff were quite kind to the residents.  The doctor’s curt manner must feel abrasive in comparison.
Chapter 1:  Charming Acres
Melanie grinned, nodding.
“We would like a seat,” Cas amended, nodding his head at the host kindly.
Dean pulled up to Crowley’s, banging the ridiculous dog head door knocker.  He flipped off the security camera, knowing Crowley would check it first.
Naomi was reading, Mary was half asleep in the sun, and Gabe and Sam took off to jump in the water.
“Well, it sure is good to see you smiling so much,” Camille grinned, taking Fletcher’s hand.  Her playful grasp suddenly jolted into a hard grip, making Fletcher’s face drop from a happy grin to fear in an instant.  Camille’s eyes rolled up unnaturally and her entire body went stiff.  Fletcher whined, pulling his hand with no escape.  Sam, Dean, Melanie, Gabe, and even Cas stared at the two in shock.
Bobby sat back with his mouth gaping.  “I knew it!”
Cas pushed the macaroni further back on the counter.  “Can I get you a glass of water?”
“Sorry,” Cas apologized.  He’d already been scolded for coming back after nine O’clock a few nights ago.  Then, apparently, he seemed odd to her at dinner the next night when he talked about his travels to Japan.  “I just wanted to let you know that I’ll be staying at Sam’s tonight.”
Dean eyed the place suspiciously.  “It looks like everything has tofu in it.”
“Dude, dude, dude!” Sam whispered, patting Gabe’s chest as his eyes went wide.  He pointed to the Frieling’s front porch.
Donna’s face lit up.  “Well now, just the man I’m looking for.”
He stood up abruptly.  “Come on, Cas.  Food’s ready.”  That was loud enough for the others to hear.  But there was no way he was getting up right now, sporting the erection Dean had created in a matter of seconds.
“Too much time spent with the dying.  I told you your job was a real downer!”
“They know we’re coming?” Cas asked.
Sam’s door was white, like the siding of his cape cod style home, built in the 80’s, like most of the homes on their street.  It had a wide front porch with chunky stone columns at the front corners.  His roof would need replacing within the next few years, and the hardwood floors were pretty scuffed in the main walkways.  Nothing he couldn’t hide with some well-placed rugs.
“Oh yeah?” Dean grinned, kissing him with a warm chuckle.  “I like compensating you.”
“Gotta go, Bobby,” Dean said quickly, taking the phone.  “I wanna get pictures of everything.”
“What?  At least he remembers right now.  Tomorrow he’ll be all freaked out and worried.  What did Rhonda do?”
“I got beer,” Rufus said, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Good.”  Gabe looked at the front doors with a new determination set in his shoulders.  “Nobody is fucking with these residents on my watch.”
Dean grinned, touching the feathered end of the dart to his own chin.  “If I remember correctly, you liked the basement.”
“No need, officer,” Dean grinned smugly.
“Yeah.  Next door on the other side of us was Melanie Golden.  She moved to Las Vegas and sold her house to Ms. Butters.  Sweet lady, you’ll love her.  She’ll have you stocked on cookies in no time.”
“Trust me, you’d end up in panties in a closet if you ever got the chance,” Dean defended.
They followed the Carrigans to the parking lot, which was a field next to the fairground.  At their car, Sam had the little boy sit between Gabe and himself in the back seat, keeping him distracted by asking about what the fairs were like here.
“In all fairness, I have never seen an episode of Scooby-Doo,” Cas admitted.
Sam waved him off, not wanting Sully to hear them talking as he stepped into the kitchen, greeting his coworker like they were old friends.  After a hug Sully pulled a very worried look on his face, he patted Sam’s shoulder.  “Are you doing okay, Sam?  Sudden deaths can seem very scary.”
“I like it,” Dean grinned, feeling his own shoulders relax.  He had seen Nellie watching their crossing from the perch of her porch, empty watering can in hand.  He was sure she was already reporting their little party to whoever it was she gossiped to.  The privacy of the little woods felt like a relief.
“Are we ready?” Sam asked, rubbing his hands together.
Ms. Dowling said he couldn’t have women up here, but she’d never said anything about bringing another man up.  He opened the door to his room and held a hand out for Dean to go first.
“I know,” Gabe shrugged, knowing he had just won over Sam’s heart for the millionth time.  He looked down at the little, curly-haired boy.  “Want some popcorn?”
“They are all around us,” Marion declared, looking around her room as if she sat in a garden dancing full of fairies.
At least Garth was getting her out of the house soon.
Goldy gripped his hand tight as the aide ran from the room.  “Mahoney!” She gasped.
***********
The pair grinned, despite their circumstances, and kissed.
Castiel nodded.  He could not imagine his mother’s reaction if a baby were in the house though.  She would flip out and lecture him on his choice of friends.
He headed back into the house feeling a bit raw.  Gabe sat in the living room on the couch wearing a plain white t-shirt and a pair of shorts.
“Hey, Dean,” Jody grinned, hugging him tiredly.
Sam patted his shoulder, staring toward the Carrigan’s house.  “It’s alright.  We know now.  And next time, we’re goin’ all the way.”
“I’m freaking out because of the wedding, aren’t I,” Sam said nervously.
“That’s not possible,” Dean rather whispered than said and looked down at his hands to recollect his thoughts. He had a magazine gripped tight in his fist and noticed that it was the latest ‘Busty Asian Beauties’ edition when he unfolded it. He tried to breathe shallowly to get his brain unclouded.
“Cas, can you… you know, go somewhere for a second?” the older hunter thought while picturing the diner he had seen the angel in before.
“I never heard yourself call Sam ‘tiny’, Dean,” Cas suddenly said in a way to straight voice, what made everyone in the room giggle.
The woman entered the house, and the older Winchester saw a glimpse of his hopefully-soon-lover in the darkness of the entrance hall. He sighed and turned around. He would have loved to support Cas during this talk, but that would only make things more complicated.
(See the end of the chapter for
He limped inside and noticed immediately, not only from a look but also from the smell that Cas wasn’t here. Damn, why couldn’t things be easy for once? After a few seconds of contemplating his options, Dean approached a short, brunette woman, who was currently stacking away snacks.
"Where do I sign," he asked through gritted teeth, but Dean could look past that. There was a glint in his alpha's eyes that he had never seen before, and that seemed to scream of trouble. Where had that helpless guy gone, that Dean had wanted to protect from anything evil just seconds ago? If this weren't such a delicate situation, he would have admitted that it turned him on a little.
“Are you helping me?” he asked the little girl and then said to Dean in the proud wonder only parents could probably muster, “She is helping me, Dean.”
“Did you kill them?”, Sammy asked before Dean could open his mouth. He really needed to remember how to breathe.
“How… When…?” he tried to ask, but it seemed as if the softness, that had creeped into Cas eyes took him by surprise.
Sammy went to shower, and when the older hunters down on the bed next to his angel and their daughter, he noticed his mother watching them intently from the couch.
“It’s okay,” the omega repeated and let himself relax against the pillows again. He didn’t feel anything wet behind him so he hoped, he hadn’t pulled any stitches. “You didn’t do anything wrong,” Dean continued referring to the earlier situation. “It’s not your fault, that our bodies react this way. Relax, okay?” The last part came out sourer than he had intended.
“I told him to call off sick, but he won’t,” Dean said, the pair standing and following him inside.
Cas smiled, the blue in his eyes warming to flames.  “Devastatingly.”
Dean’s hips were canting in a solid rhythm.  “It’s loud out there.”
Cas waved Jo over to the table to get Crowley a drink.  She waved and came back with two beers, pulled a chair up, taking a much needed break.  “You guys seem to be having fun tonight!”
Fletcher, sitting next to her, waved, his mouth was full, but his bowl was almost empty.
“I’ll see,” he said, going to the laundry room hastily.  The knob was near the finish mark, so he pulled the door open.  Warm, dry sheets fell into his hand.  He pulled them out with a triumphant grin.  “They’re done!” He called, folding them hastily.  He shot the brothers a grin as he rushed through the kitchen.  “I’ll be right back,” he said, going out the door.
Gabe kicked a stray piece of wire across the floor.  “No idea.”
Having survived dinner and assisted with as much clean-up as Ms. Dowling would allow, Cas directed Dean into the parlor.  “Would you like to see my room?”
“I see you still like hanging out with these two,” Melanie smiled, Fletcher nodding emphatically where he perched on Gabe’s hip.
Castiel nodded.  They gave each other a look of understanding.
“Hi, Gabe,” Sully said quietly with a sympathetic smile.
Castiel closed his Chemistry book, sliding it away from himself.  He added his name to the top of his homework paper and closed the binder.
It was only then that it dawned on Dean that Cas might be waiting for HIM to make the next move.  He stood up so abruptly that the bench teetered, and he had to steady it before it clattered to the deck, waking half the neighborhood.  Was Cas waiting for him to...what?  Touch him?  Ask him?  Just start pulling his boxers off?  If that were the case, no wonder they hadn’t gotten any further.  For some of the crazy shit he had done in his time (including having sex in a freezer surrounded by dead fish) he had never started it.  His game was flirt, then let them take over.  Wait and see what he got.  Bait the hook and ride what he reeled in.  That was his comfort zone.
“There’re monsters out there.  And we hunt them.”
“Hey there,” a brown-haired man said, coming toward them.  “We haven’t met yet.  I’m Gary.  I live next door to you with my wife, Deb.”  He pointed to a pretty woman with a heart-shaped face and long, thick brown hair, who waved at them.  She said something to the woman she was talking to and headed their way.
“What’s new on the hunting front?” Dean asked, sitting down with a beer of his own.
“Hi!”
“No,” Sam sighed.  “Deb says she’s getting total silence from the police department now.”
Castiel broke out in a huge grin.  “You like Gabe.”
“I need to stop at a friend’s.  You mind?” Luc asked.
Sam plugged the stick into his laptop and slid it over to Gabe, who began clicking once it was loaded.  “Here is the moment in question.”  They all got up, crowding behind him to stare at the screen.  “Here comes Doc Mahoney.”
“Cas!” Dean laughed.  Castiel cut anything else off with a heated kiss that had Dean’s hands pulling his shirt off.
“Yeah,” Dean nodded, dousing the meat.  “Thanks.”
Dean grinned down at the table, noting none of the warm, lush tones he was accustomed to hearing when it was ‘Hello, Dean’.
“Whatever the historical society allows, I suppose,” Cas surmised.  Running every decision past them was getting a bit old.
“Bobby called me, and I left work right away, luckily you two got out anyway.  My poor baby!” Gabe pouted, inspecting Sam’s finger.
Sam did not look convinced.  “Quit keeping secrets from us, Cas.  You have no idea the damage my dad can do in a weekend.  Let alone a freaking week.”
Sam headed out to the yard, finding Gabe standing near the neighbor’s pool, Zoe hung on the side, goggles on her face, talking to Fletcher, and Cindy going on about an up-coming parade on Labor Day weekend.
Dean’s disgruntled look shifted to a beaming grin.  “Sounds good to me.”  He followed Dean out the door and down the stairs, the pair of them sharing a proud grin when Cas caught his hand in the foyer, and they left the stuffy confines of the boarding house.
She had long, light brown hair that hung in loose curls to her shoulders.  She didn’t strike him as a hunter.  She just didn’t have the burnt feel.  He glanced at Buddy, the best barometer for character that he knew.  The dog watched her curiously but did not seem eager to greet her either.
“Oh, was he now,” Rufus said darkly, glaring toward Bobby who looked downright murderous under the long bill of his ball cap.
“I meant no, don’t snookums me.”
The second room had a twin bed with a pink bedspread, fluffy pink curtains, a make-up table, and a chair.
“Knock it off,” Dean laughed again.
Their mom went back to work while Castiel and Gabe went over to Sam’s.
Gabe scoffed.  “Please.  I’ll pay the fines.  That fucker deserved it.  I never liked him either.  Cas is too nice for his own good sometimes.”
“And if Deb Frieling is cheating on, was cheating, on Gary with PJ Berman...that can’t be good for business.”
“Now you two just wait here, nice and quiet,” Madge grinned, shoving a washcloth into Dean’s mouth as Ed did the same with a hot pad to Sam.
At the moment, Dean was looking around the room with a mixture of amusement and trepidation.  Knowing how eager his hands had been less than an hour ago, Cas decided to bank on the notion that Dean wanted him as badly as he had back at Gabe’s.  He’d never really been the lead in a relationship before, but the closer he got to testing the waters, the more he wanted to do it.  He had waited night after night for Dean to take them to the next step, but nothing was happening.  As Dean kissed him tonight, it finally dawned on him that Dean was not shy in taking the next step.  He was shy about initiating the next step.
“Stop getting turned on when I’m angry,” Cas said, frowning harder.
“Right,” the guy winced, remembering the two were brothers.
“Alright,” Rufus said, waving for all of them to sit down.  “This is how mistakes are made.  Keep it together.  I say, WE help Bobby by helping Donna figure out what the hell is going on in this town.  Then she’ll leave, THEN we move the body.  Then we go back to our normal, boring lives.”
“Fuuuck,” Dean muttered against his mouth.  “Fuck.”
“Wonderful,” he grinned at her a bit more slyly this time.  “Hurry back, you know how things fall apart without you.”
Their last night at the beach was a good bit calmer than the others.  While Dean did kiss him for what seemed like all night, and they brought each other again to climax, they spent the wee hours of the morning sleeping, cuddling, and touching.
“So, Donna doesn’t know about...the yard,” Sam said, half question, half statement.”
Dean smirked as Doug walked him roughly through the door into the police station.  The officer at the desk inside the door watched curiously as Dean was paraded through a large room with four desks, down a hall and into another hall with two wide cells in it.
“Anything,” Castiel whispered.
“Yeah, I think so,” Dean managed miserably, head jerking upright.  He took a quick stock of his body, but other than his pounding head, everything seemed to be in working order.  He turned, seeing he and Sam were back-to-back, tied to chairs in Ed and Madge’s kitchen.
Castiel shook his head.  Kevin was by far the most heavily watched friend he had.  He couldn’t hang out half the time because he had to practice cello, or do homework, or work.  The guy was really smart, but his mom kept pressure on him pretty heavily.
“Okay...” Dean frowned, Cas chuckling.
“No, no, no,” Dean grinned, leaning a bit toward him, eyes sparkling like he was holding five aces.  “Like...everywhere.  Like I bathed in it.”
“Zoe’s mom does it too.  And Kat’s mom moans sometimes.”
“All night long,” Castiel sighed.
“Sure.  We’ll come visit you in juvey too.”
Castiel quirked a grin at him.  He was glad Gabe saw him that way.  He did not think of himself as judgmental.  But it was true, he could be pretty hard on himself.
“Well, I shot him.”
“It’s not,” Sam assured as tactfully as slamming a door in her face.
“What?!” He and Gabe scoffed.
“See?” One of the nurse’s aides said, bumping Gabe’s elbow with his, nodding down the hall.  The guy had pulled him out of fixing a heating unit, telling him there was some sort of something going on with police and HIS brother.  Sure enough, Cas came out of Wayne Whittaker’s office, hands cuffed behind his back and Donna Hanscum leading him out by the elbow.
“I’ll call her right away,” he assured her.
Just as Dean began to worry what Cas must be thinking, Cas’ hand returned to his knee, gently, and Dean winced internally at what an idiot he must look like right now.  Damaged was for teenagers.  He was fucking thirty.  He should be way over this shit.  This stupid, pointless, worthless shit.
Dean was heading toward the wing when he turned around, walking backwards.  “Him and Sam had a fight.  I fixed it.  Ya know, brother stuff.”
Castiel grinned.  “You sleeping?”
“What?” He, Sam, and Gabe said.
Fred stared up at the TV, not even noticing their arrival.  Donna, on the other hand, stood up with a big grin.  “Well, lookie what the cat dragged in!”
“My mom,” she said sadly, poking at her cheerful scoop of ice cream.
“Heard you’re the new girl in town,” Garth grinned, sitting next to her at the table with his enigmatic grin.
“Yeah,” Sam agreed.  “Something’s up with him.  I think he’s kinda off because he graduated.  He keeps talking about moving.”
“I don’t want to go back home,” Sam said, staring out at the rain.  The ocean crashed loudly onto the empty beach.
Sam sighed, giving Dean a bitchface.
“God, I love you!” Dean yelled, flooring it.
Dean’s brow quirked.  “As in...the Moonlight Diner attached to Moonlight Motel?”
Cas chuckled.
Bobby came in the door, giving the group an unsure look.  “Anyone wanna explain why my new dentist and that goofball Sully are coming to your door?”
Dean closed his eyes.  “I did not need to know that.”
Bobby and Rufus exchanged another quick glance.  He pulled open his desk drawer and lifted two glasses onto his desk.  “There’s more glasses in the kitchen,” he said to Gabe, who glanced around before getting to his feet to fetch them.
“You are out on bail, Gabe!” Sam snapped.  “You haven’t even had a hearing and you have quadrupled your fines.”
Dammit, Dean.
“You gonna be more careful?” Sam asked.
“Well, I’m pretty sure these are your bunkmate’s, my friend.”  He helped Joe step out of the tangle of material.
“I’m just trying to figure some things out before the whole world knows.”
“We, uh, came to make a deal.”  Sam attempted to sound sure of himself, but they had all been quite sure Stark was the mastermind, or possibly Mahoney.  “So...Stark’s just the money man?”
Bobby bit his lip, studying the blonde.  “Thought I’d have more time to ease ya inta all this.  Come on.  Let’s get outta here.  I’ll introduce ya to Crooks.”
“Jody?” Gabe asked, watching as one of the girls with dark brown hair walked over and started talking to the hunkered down old bat scribbling in a book at the bar.  And as baffling as it was, the guy got all wound up, flipping through his book to write something in it.  And the girl didn’t look confused or weirded-out!  She fuckin’ watched him, nodding along to whatever he was saying.
Chuck and Kevin were waiting on the porch for Sam.  They threw together a quick plan.  Chuck stole the keys to his dad’s car, the four heading out of town where John Winchester lived.
Hiring Bobby as their grounds keeper had been the best decision they could have made.  He stepped into the job with ease.  And his health and demeanor had improved.  He did plenty inside the manor still, but time outdoors was what he seemed to crave and thrive on.
“Mommy said Kat is still sick.  She can’t come play because she’s at the hospital.”
“I thought someone was in there!” Nellie said, high pitched and somewhere between scolding and concern.
“It might be loaded,” Gabe hissed.
“Thank you, dear,” she smiled, sipping it.
“I hear you were an angel to our Bobby,” she smiled at him with what Dean already seemed to understand was an uncharacteristic spot of sweetness.
Justin came out of the back door in his suit.  “Hello there!”
“Congratulations,” Sam said, meaning it, clinking beers with his brother.
“Oh, it’s party time.  Sammy and I caught a lucky break and we’re about to go in.”
Gabe squatted down, resting his arms on her armrest.  “That is an excellent idea.  How much should I charge?”
Castiel shrugged with a little grin tugging his mouth.  “No idea.  Maybe we’ll go get stoned and rob a liquor store.”
Dean hugged him again.  Wishing he could do something.  Make sense of all the strange things they seemed surrounded by.  Why was this town so strange?  He was glad he had not blurted out his disgust with Carl Stevens obituary, which claimed he died from heart issues.  Just like Gary.  He hugged Cas tighter.  “I’m gonna figure out what the hell’s wrong with this town, Cas.  I promise.”
“You broke into an office!” Sam argued back.  “And so did you!” He pointed at Cas.  “And we’re planning on breaking into our neighbor’s house this weekend!”
Bobby’s eyes darted over to Rufus who dropped his mouth like he never heard of the guy.
No comment.  Sam grinned down at his own cards.  “Nothing is wild?”
“Did they see us?” Sam asked, searching the woods.
“Is that a hickey?” Sam brushed a finger over his neck.
Dean took the spoon, their fingers brushing against each other briefly as it transferred from his hand to Dean’s.  Incredibly short of his fantasy...yet exhilarating all the same.
So are the mysteries.
“Who’s he drinking with?” Castiel asked, yawning.
“I don’t think so,” Dean said at the same time Cas said, “No.”
And it was enough.
Cas and Dean finish their date.
“Cas!”  He took Cas’ hand in his, inspecting the splinted fingers in the dim light.  “You shoulda come to my house.”  He looked back at him with a determination and attention Castiel had never received before.  “Don’t ever run away again.  Ever.  You come find me.”
“I don’t think so,” Sam grinned, putting a hand on Gabe’s shoulder.  “Dean’s right.  Let’s go play some games.”
Dean gave him a warm, quick grin before turning back to Don.  “Yeah, me...ever.  Actually, it makes me question your politics,” Dean said to Don matter-of-factly.
She was still stretching her neck to gawk across the street.  She looked back at them, scanning them quickly as if she was looking for weapons or evidence.  “The last person that lived in your brother’s house wasn’t very sociable.  Hope those two don’t turn out to be the same way.”
“It’s so good to see you too, Fletcher!” Donna grinned, not paying any of them any attention as Bobby said something into Fred’s ear quickly and quietly, the man nodding.
They cleaned up dinner and headed for the porch, watching the rain on the ocean, playing cards, and Dean picking at his guitar.
Dean shrugged.  “Get outta my car so I can go to bed, flirt.”
“Sonny?” Sully said sadly.
The statement made chills run down Castiel’s neck so hard he stifled a gasp.  It wasn’t the words so much as Dean’s voice in general.  And so near his ear and neck.
“Who?” Sam frowned.
“Unscrupulous,” Dean whispered to Cas, winking, making his blue eyes light up in challenge.
Cas shrugged.  “He deserved it.  Dean, I don’t want this to be a problem.”
“I won’t,” Castiel assured him instantly, reaching a hand out to grab Dean’s jacket.  He let go after barely a second holding it.  Dean swayed a tiny bit closer.  “I’ll have one shot.  I... I could use some practice.”
“Cas!”
Castiel got in bed, turning the light off.  He didn’t stop moving, knowing he would totally lose his nerve if he did.
“Hey, Bobby.  We’re about a mile from Sioux Falls,” Dean said.
“I don’t know.  And neither does Sully.  But he’s going to keep an eye on all of them when school starts.”
“Cassie,” Gabe sighed.  “I’m gonna handle this.  I already have a rap sheet.  Let me take this one.  It was my fault anyway.”
Gabe:  Cassie, I know you’re mad.  Dean’s a dick.  But he just met that girl.  Nothing happened.  I need to know you’re okay.  Fuck Dean.  I want to know if you’re okay.
“The bracelet!”  Goldy exclaimed.  “They’re stealing!”
Sam pulled his t-shirt off, heading for the bathroom.  “Come on.  Dean will be here by noon.  The moving truck will be here by two O’clock.”
Cas went into the bathroom, his heart feeling as light as a bird.  He loved Dean.  That’s all there was to it!  He considered himself a passionate man, and even by his standards, that sex had been the most passionate moment in his life so far.  Steamy, ridiculously, insanely passionate.  He stared down at his half hard dick perking up in his boxers, huffing a laugh.
“He actually can,” the man who had handed over the briefcase spoke up, and Zack turned to him in an overly dramatic gesture. “If he has the medical records…” Cas opened his jacket and got out a stack of papers and handed them over with an unchanging expression. What the fuck was just happening.
“I’m fine, I’m fine”, she reassured them as Sam looked her up and down as well. She looked over at Cas, who hadn't left his side of the impala, even though he was standing in the middle of the road.
As soon as the third person had disappeared, the omega sprung into action. He approached the person closest to him and decided on a way to knock them both out at the same time so no one would shout.
“It was this one writing where a Nephilim claimed for his human mother to be alive.” It was silent for a moment after that, the feelings of hope, guilt, anger and fear mixing between them.
Cas eyes narrowed first in irritation and then opened wide. Food completely forgotten, he blinked a few times unbelievingly and Dean would think of it as funny if there wasn't so much at stake.
It was quiet, it was in the distance, but it was unmistakably the howling of a wolf or rather a werewolf because why would a regular wolf hunt this close to humans.
“Okay,” Dean said instead. “How’s the marriage preparation going then? She already crazy?”
“Yeah.” Sam looked up and blew his ridiculously long hair out of his face. “It’s the witness I interviewed today. Jim Walter.”
"No, not that I remember," Sam replied, brows furrowed. "Why do you ask?"
“There was a lady a few days ago who asked the same questions. Do you know her?” an elderly man at the local bar asked, and Sams's eyes snapped up from the investigator's block he had been scribbling on.
Due to lifelong training, the hunter was outside and hidden in no time, even though whatever attacked them could probably trace him down however hard he hid. As he crouched down and looked around the cement wall he was behind, a rumbling went through the floor beneath his feet like an earthquake.
“No,” Dean said and took a deep breath. This was it. If they were all going to die soon, again, he could at least this time finally let it out. “I love you like I love you. Like my mom loved my dad before he turned to be an abusive bastard probably.”
“Did she come back?” Dean asked and was painfully reminded of his own stay with his dad, while Sammy had gone to College, to get out of the hunting life.
“Dean, in case of an emergency you can drive with one hand and we will be a lot faster if we are the two of us.” When he said it like this it actually sounded very reasonable. Dean just hadn’t been alone with his daughter yet and it seemed a little bit scary since Cas also had this unspoken connection with her.
“You’ll make sure I don't roll onto her?” he asked the angel while pulling his boots of. Despite having just lost what had been their home for the last years, the situation felt quite domestic.
For a second it was silent while Dean stared at the others determined to make them accept his words. “And if I don’t come back in ten minutes, lock the doors.”
“Aw, Sammy, come on. Can't you be happy for us?”
“I got a little bit of boiled water from the coffee machine at Walmart,” Sam uttered from behind Dean. He had already placed a baby bottle, a package of white powder and a few cups with lits on them on the roof of the Impala. “They should be cold enough by now.”
Ten more minutes sitting next to the girl he had knocked up and Dean wished he was outside again with the enemies. If he was a woman, he thought, there was no way, that he would ever want children. Or maybe, he could adopt some, because they were really awesome and cute, but all of this pain couldn’t be worth it.
"Give me all the money," Dean blurted out not nearly as intimidating as he wanted, as he remembered what he was supposed to do. He yearned to facepalm himself because there clearly were more intelligent sounding ways to rob a fuel station.
He reeled back and tried to put as much distance between the two of them as possible in the small hospital room. Pressed to the far wall, Cas stared wide-eyed at Dean.
So, he kissed Cas.
They sat down at the table after Dean had hung Cas jacket and at first ate in silence. It kind of was comfortable, and kind of wasn't since Dean knew he had something to ask for and didn't know how.
Cas nodded as if he didn't really want to but to continue their talk.
Making sure they couldn't move or speak as soon they woke up and wouldn't be seen by somebody passing, the Winchester slowly made his way to the more enlightened part of the building, leaving the area were where a lot of big, dark objects were located which had been useful as hiding spots.
Castiel closed his eyes, breathing out shakily.  Dean pulled his wrist, moving his hand to rest on the inside of his thigh.
He went back into the Gas-n-Sip with a new energy.  He was in love.  And he had a date.  A real date.
Cas chuckled, scooping the pile toward himself, stacking his chips neatly.
And there it was.
I think you like my brother?  I think you need to stay away?  I think you’re gross?  I think I hate you?
Castiel blushed so hard he was sure the capillaries in his cheeks would burst.  Mouth open in pure want, Castiel slid his hand down Dean’s soft shorts.  A long length of hard, hot penis filled his hand.  As if every touch, stroked his own, he had to fight the urge to not come in his pants.  He stroked the length, feeling the ridge of his head through the shorts.
Five miles down the road, when everyone had settled in a bit, Castiel let his hand wander over to Dean’s thigh.
“I think you just like to make sure I’m sleep deprived,” Gabe grinned.
“Oh!” Deb grinned, “Sam, Gabe, Cas, this is Naoki and Olivia.”
“You guys are obsessed,” he muttered, sitting next to Castiel, patting him just above the knee in greeting.
“Bobby is down the hall with Fred,” Cas said, frowning.
Sam glanced back nervously, then looked at him again, nodding.
“I’m going to take that as a no.  Which is concerning.”
“We found a basement door, well, we’re pretty sure it was a basement door,” Sam said, getting everyone’s attention, “and it had a big lock on it.”
“Dean, Sam, Cas, Gabe, this here’s Ellen Harvelle.  Owner of The Roadhouse and generally in charge of pert near everything.”
Dean stammered slightly but managed to look at Don fairly confidently.  “Yeah, that’s what we heard.”
Dean went into the weapon room, griping that Claire had, in fact, taken the flame thrower.  Cas sat at the table.  “What did you want to ask us, Lee?”
“No.  It was tea,” Cas shrugged.
Dean laughed, nodding.  “I heard that too.  Can’t say I wanna even go in a nasty-ass place called ‘Weasel’s’.  Besides, could be a dude on the other side of that hole.”
