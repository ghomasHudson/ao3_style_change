Sherlock nodded, somewhat wary of looking at John after what they’d done the night before. He was still partially afraid that John would be able to tell what he was really thinking, even though he knew logically John didn’t have that capability.
They ended up face to face this time, both of Sherlock’s hands braced on the headboard, one knee hooked over John’s good shoulder, the other clinging to John’s back, as John pounded into him. It wasn’t gentle, or nice, but it made Sherlock's blood sing.
Sherlock reached out for it, giving John’s penis the same treatment John had given his own, until John came into Sherlock’s cupped palm.
For a time (he wasn’t sure how long as his brain seemed to have gone offline) he just sat there, his hands full of food and suspended over Sherlock’s head. When he had come back to himself after this indeterminate period of befuddlement, there didn’t actually seem to be much of a choice in the matter. With a put upon sigh, he set his tea and his plate on the side table within arm’s reach, picked his remaining sandwich half up off the plate, and set to finishing his meal with his flatmate snoozing away on his legs.
John kept one hand nestled in Sherlock’s hair, and the other began stroking down Sherlock’s back, the skin gradually warming up under his palm. He did this for a long time, he wasn’t sure how long, and he couldn’t remember what he’d read the night before about coming out of a drop. Was it supposed to take this long? Sherlock had been dropping since the night before. How concerned should he be?
He handed the mug back to John, who placed it again on the bedside table, and then there was silence, a rather awkward and painful one that involved Sherlock trying to bore into John’s mind with imaginary laser beams coming from his eyes. John swallowed and spoke.
“I’m serious, now,” said John. “I know you haven’t had sex, but STIs are still something we should discuss. I was tested two months ago after I broke up with—”
John let out an undignified squeak, and in his surprise, attempted a mini-leap off the sofa. Sherlock grunted and pushed him back down, his hand never leaving John’s trousers. He burrowed his head back into John’s lap to get comfortable again, his hand still gently resting under the waistband of John’s pants. Aside from the location, it felt oddly non-sexual. John found his hand pulling at Sherlock’s hair just a little too tight, and he released his grip. He soothed his hand over Sherlock’s head in apology. He tried to act casual.
Sherlock didn’t answer John, merely quirked his mouth a little, and lifted his hand to examine it. It was, of course, splattered with John’s semen. Before John could suggest they clean up a little, Sherlock lifted his hand up to his mouth and began licking it clean, his eyes on John’s the whole time.
“Two fingers now,” said John when the slight burn turned to pleasure, and Sherlock complied, his free hand digging its fingers into John’s leg and giving away just how nervous he was.
“Little,” said Sherlock, and John obliged as Sherlock rolled over. He scooted up behind Sherlock and tucked their knees together, pulling the other man close to his front. John was pressed so near to Sherlock there was nowhere else to place his nose but the spot where Sherlock’s ear met his neck. It was extremely comfortable. He’d never spooned someone taller than himself before. He wondered what it would feel like the other way around. Sherlock was so big, he’d be able to wrap himself almost completely around John, but with John as the big spoon, his largeness made this feel special, too. It made John wonder, that for someone so larger than life, so loud and brilliant and at times abrasive as Sherlock could be, that there was something inside of him John had unearthed that needed nurturing, and care, and comfort.
Sherlock had slipped back into real sleep over an hour before, so John moved carefully. First he reached around and extricated Sherlock's limp hand from around his arse cheek, then he cradled Sherlock’s head in both his hands, lifting him gently as he slipped out from under his flatmate’s weight. Soon he was up and Sherlock’s head was laid safely on the sofa, his breathing deep and easy. John stretched automatically, and his spine popped audibly. He’d been sitting in the same position for too long.
John moved to place a hand on the brow over Sherlock’s right eye, and brought a penlight up to shine in his pupil. Reactive and normal.
John handed him the toast and Sherlock took it without thinking, immediately beginning to eat. John brought his arms to wrap around Sherlock’s chest, and rested his cheek on the top of Sherlock’s head as Sherlock contentedly munched away. When he finished his first slice John handed him the second, and this went on for a bit. When he had finished, licking his fingers to get the lingering jam, he leaned fully back onto John, his head turning so that his cheek was against John’s chest.
Once John had Sherlock sitting up, from his position straddling Sherlock’s lap, his knees resting on either side of Sherlock’s thighs, he was able to easily divest Sherlock of his t-shirt. Sherlock lifted his arms obediently and looked up at John with comically wide eyes as the t-shirt pulled over his face and then mussed his curls as it was pulled off. Sherlock, it seemed, was rather confident when sex was only a matter of simply touching the other person without giving over anything of yourself, but he was shockingly vulnerable like this, naked and open, and waiting for John to make the next move.
Only, he’d come home to find Sherlock sitting on the couch with a dish towel wrapped around his hand, calm as anything. He’d proffered said hand wordlessly to John, who found underneath a single, long but shallow cut on Sherlock’s palm. It had bled pretty badly at first, judging by the amount of blood on the towel, but the bleeding had clearly stopped.
, made me watch as your body fell, and your head and your bones and your beautiful mind, and all the rest of you hit the ground and broke forever. And you left me.”
John’s breath was coming in short gasps, and his penis was hardening even as Sherlock watched. It was very nice, John's penis. Thick and sturdy, like John.
Well, it's been almost exactly two years to the day since I first posted this story, and I am finally uploading the last chapter. Lots of things have happened in two years, including a health crisis, which was the initial reason I never got around to the last chapter in 2018. By the time I was motivated enough to come back to it, I had lost the thread of the ending. I think it took me so long to finally get it out because the original ending I had planned was no longer the one that the story needed. So, on the one hand I'm frustrated it took me so long, but on the other hand, I'm much happier with the way this story turned out than I would have been had I written it two years ago. Hope it's at least an all right ending for you, but at least it's finally an ending.
Sherlock wiped his hand on the same tissue John had used earlier, and they sat in silence for a while, neither of them watching the telly, but eyes fixed on it nevertheless.
It was in the cab that things got heated. John’s giggles turned to furtive glances, and before Sherlock knew what was happening, John had picked up Sherlock’s hand and placed it on top of John’s crotch, whereupon he felt John’s erection hot underneath. His hand remained there for the rest of the ride home. He wondered, had John reacted liked this at the end of a case before, or was it new, a result of their arrangement? Had others been the recipients of John’s amorous attentions post-case? Sherlock didn’t think so. Too many nights had ended with just the two of them, eating Chinese food or some-such.
The thrusts slowed in pace, but did not stop. They were harder now, and John stayed inside him longer, before pulling out and entering him once again.
“This is why virginity is such a useless construct, John. When I say that I am a virgin, it could mean anything. I could mean that I’ve never participated in any sort of sexual behavior at all, from masturbation all the way through the spectrum up to penetrative sex . . .”
With a monstrous groan, John heaved himself up and eased himself out of Sherlock’s arse. He pulled the condom off and disposed of it in the bin by Sherlock’s nightstand.
“You like that?” asked John. Sherlock just closed his eyes in response, and leaned into John’s hand. “I’ll remember that in future.”
It was on a Saturday night. John had gone out for drinks with Lestrade, and Sherlock had been left in charge of Rosie. He secretly cherished these nights alone with her, playing and trying to communicate with her, holding her and smelling the top of her baby soft head. He need not worry about anyone observing him as he allowed himself to experience the feelings she brought out in him. She was a safe space.
“Not the right question, John. As ever, you see but do not observe. The variable here is you, not me. The same sexual act, the same recipient, very different results.”
“Yeah, all right,” said John, putting his book down and gazing fondly at Rosie, who was on her back under that absurd baby playmat with the dangly bits (Sherlock had replaced several of these with more scientifically accurate versions of the animals and insects represented, but neither John or Rosie had been pleased, and they had been removed).
As if reading his mind, Sherlock stilled, pulled his hand off John’s prick, spat on it and put it back, making a looser fist, but not moving his hand. He leaned his head down and in a low rumble, whispered in John’s ear, “Move”. A full body shudder took John at that moment. Sherlock’s forehead was warm against his own.
The wonderful part for Sherlock was that something in that post-case encounter had broken some sort of barrier in John’s mind, and he now had no trouble whatsoever initiating sex with Sherlock. He was turning out to be quite insatiable, in fact, and while he usually had the sense not to try anything when Sherlock was busy with a case or an experiment, there had been a few times when Sherlock had had to swat him away.
“Last night on the sofa, I just—you made me so angry, doing what you did, and I just have to let it happen, those things that you do. When I saw you there, not a care in the world, no thought for how your reckless actions might have turned out . . . I needed to claim you. I needed to feel you willingly submit to what I wanted from you, what I needed. I knew you liked it, the roughness and the control, but I wasn’t doing it for you, Sherlock, I was doing it for me. And that’s fucked up.”
Sherlock grabbed John’s calves, right in the space below the hollow of his knees, and pulled him forward so that he was slouched down in the chair, and Sherlock was nestled in the vee of his legs.
Sherlock complied, rolling over and resting his head on his arms, and waited for John. His heart was pounding in his chest. It had been a long time; he’d forgotten the horrific vulnerability of bottoming for another man.
After he’d put her to bed, he’d puttered around the kitchen for a while, checking his samples, and then retreated to his own bed in defeat. He hadn’t really slept in a couple of days, just cat naps on the sofa now and then in between experiments, so he allowed himself the luxury of a long, hot shower, and then crawled into bed naked, his preferred sleeping attire when the weather allowed. The bed did feel quite lovely. Mrs. Hudson had been in sometime today and changed his sheets. They were clean and smelled of fabric softener. He breathed deeply and was out in a matter of minutes.
He took another pause, this time acutely aware that he’d just bared his most closely kept secret to the one person he’d never wanted to know it. His hands were shaking, he was sure Sherlock could tell. He had to go on.
“. . . or I could simply mean that I am by some limited definitions still technically a virgin, because even though I’ve experienced orgasm with another person, or caused another person to orgasm, sexual activity doesn’t count as ‘real sex’ unless someone is being penetrated. Some people believe that, you know. Dull.”
Sherlock seemed to have realized that the time for exploration was over now, as his hand was firmly and steadily moving. Every third stroke he ran his thumb over the head of John’s cock, brushing the sensitive underside.
“Sherlock, I’m serious.” He met Sherlock’s eyes. “If we’re going to do this, it’s going to be for both of us, and that means we both get off, every time. Agreed?”
“I’m going to try moving now,” said John, lifting himself slightly, as Sherlock only hummed in agreement. He gasped as John pulled up, and then pushed back down, the new sensations nearly overwhelmed both of them.
“The one afternoon kind. I propose that you lie still on this bed and let me do what I wish to you, until two o’clock when you have to go get Rosie.”
“Don’t say ‘cock’. It can hear you,” said Sherlock, nodding down toward his wayward penis. Unthinking, John looked down as well. His face suffused with heat again as he took in the erect state of said appendage, which was now lying parallel to Sherlock’s flat and seriously pale belly. John reminded himself to think clinically. It was so engorged, it looked almost purple. Talk about blue balls. He shuddered imperceptibly, this time in sympathy.
Sherlock, the bastard, knew what John was about to say, and forestalled it. “Please, John.” He looked at John with such open conviction it was almost painful.
John smiled. “Yes, that one probably could have gone unmentioned, but I suppose it’s nice to have it said aloud anyway. Did you have more?”
John withdrew his fingers, and Sherlock heard as he pulled his cock from his pants, rolled on the condom, and slicked it up. Sherlock wished he could turn around and see it, watch as John pushed himself inside of Sherlock, anticipating the stretch and the pleasant burn of it. He moaned and raised his hips up slightly, widening his stance and raising up on to his knees, effectively presenting himself to John.
It had been months and months since the start of their arrangement. Rosie was now toddling around the flat, and they’d had to baby-proof it, which turned out to be a nightmare for Sherlock. He watched in a state of extreme distress as John threw out most of his experiments, saying they were “toxic”, and removed all the breakables and sharp objects at toddler height. He wouldn’t hear it when Sherlock tried to explain that Rosie was smart and Sherlock would teach her not to touch his things. In the end, they’d compromised and bought Sherlock a separate refrigerator for his experiments, which they kept padlocked.
“—Jeanette,” finished John, without a pause. “I’m clean and haven’t been with anyone since. Were you tested after, you know?”
“Yes,” said Sherlock, who was now taking slow, deep breaths once again. Probably a smart idea. John didn’t even know if Sherlock had ever had a hand-job, or any sexual contact with another human being.
He and Sherlock hadn’t really been okay in a long time. A lot of that was on Sherlock. John’s fists still clenched in remembered rage whenever he thought of that long drop from the top of St. Bart’s, rounding the corner to see Sherlock’s broken body lying on the ground, and the dread and certainty that the brightest thing in his life was gone forever, for no good fucking reason. But that had been years back, time long gone. Which was just an excuse. Not even a year ago that old anger had been set loose on Sherlock once again, and in his most self-reflective moments, John knew the incident in the morgue wasn’t really about Mary’s death. Or rather, it was, but that was only one part of it.
“Right,” he said, “I have an idea.” And he maneuvered them so that he was lying on his belly, both of Sherlock’s knees resting on his shoulders this time. Sherlock only realized what was about to happen just as John’s mouth began to slide down his aching prick.
An unmistakable coil of desire was unfurling low in John’s belly, running a line straight to his own cock, sparking nerve endings on random bits of his skin as the rest of his body got the message. With every stroke of John’s hand, Sherlock reacted, his breath now coming in heavy gasps, his head tilted to the side in what John could only think of as “wild abandon.” He was close now.
“Whoops,” said John, picking a crumb out of Sherlock’s fringe, and then pausing to take Sherlock’s pulse. Still fine.
John read long into the night, websites all about informed and enthusiastic consent, about dominants and submissives, about subspace and aftercare.
“I didn’t realize that’s what was going on until last night, when you were so upset with me. I could tell something was wrong beyond even your normal levels of annoyance, and as soon as you walked out of the room, I knew I’d crossed a line. And the more I thought about it, I realized that most of the time when we have sex, you sort of, I don’t know, turn yourself over to me, and I’ve just horribly taken advantage of that. Do you understand?”
“Hmmm,” said John. “Twenty minutes? Doesn’t matter. Don’t need an erection to kiss you all over, make you feel good.”
Soon he was up to two fingers, and then three. The feeling of fingers inside of him had been slightly disturbing at first, but he quickly grew used to them, remembering when John brushed his prostate how pleasurable anal intercourse could be, with a competent partner. He just lay there passively experiencing it, having turned his body over to John to do with it what he willed. It was a vaguely familiar feeling, similar to the high he got from drugs, but this was different. Warmer, more fleeting, but somehow also more real?
John’s thoughts tripped a bit as Sherlock articulated the phrase ‘penetrative sex,’ but he didn’t interrupt.
The girl was safely returned to her parents by noon the next day, and John had been with him for the last stretch of it. John watching Sherlock be brilliant never failed to make the man giddy, even after all these years. Lestrade finally had to shoo them off of his crime scene when the giggling got out of hand, and they bundled into a cab home.
“Good god, man, articulate,” said John, dropping a kiss onto Sherlock’s temple and releasing Sherlock’s hands, which immediately (surprise) gravitated towards John’s bare arse.
The force of Sherlock’s orgasm seemed to push John over the edge. With a few more forceful thrusts, he came, shooting into the condom, his breath heaving as he knelt over Sherlock. Both of them didn’t move, couldn’t move, as they came down. The encounter didn’t seem to have gone the way either of them expected. Sherlock could feel John’s penis softening inside him.
It was another quiet night at Baker Street (Sherlock was more and more coming to appreciate these, since John was here again). John had just finished putting Rosie to bed, and Sherlock had made him a cuppa while he sang and read to her and gave her a quick cuddle. John looked pleased when Sherlock handed it to him. Sherlock did occasionally make tea now they were living together again, but he didn’t do it very often.
Sherlock brought his mouth in close to John’s ear, his deep voice low and sure: “I want you to stay.”
“We don’t have to talk right now. Right now, I just want to know what you want to do. Do you want to sleep? Or do you want to get up for the day? I left Rosie with Mrs. Hudson, but I can go get her if you want to see her.” John knew Sherlock sometimes liked to have lazy mornings with his daughter when he thought John wasn’t paying attention. He’d often caught Sherlock holding her close and smelling her head. Rosie was a safe subject, so John finally brought his gaze back to Sherlock’s, whose face was betraying nothing. He only looked at John as if he were listening attentively for maybe the first time in his life when a case wasn’t involved.
He leaned down for another soft kiss then sat up, grasping Sherlock’s prick in his hand and guiding it to his entrance. He felt as the crown breached the first sphincter and he tightened by reflex. Sherlock was whimpering a little, squirming, obviously fighting to hold himself still while John took his time. John knew that feeling, the need to move, to thrust, to claim.
“It’s all you from here, Sherlock. I know you said you tried having a wank, but you’re going to try again, and it’s not going to be a big deal.”
John came. His orgasm left him with the force of a freight train. It was long and urgent, and Sherlock’s lanky body held him close while he rode it out.
John wanted very badly at this point to reach out and touch Sherlock in return, but something made him stop. Sherlock hadn’t asked him if they could have sex, just for permission to touch him. This was as much an experiment for the genius as it was a sexual encounter. John could almost feel Sherlock weighing his reactions, asking himself, “Do I like this? What about this?” John hoped there would be time later for him to touch Sherlock in return, but for now he would wait. Instead, he clasped his hands together and wedged them underneath his pillow. Hands off.
The feeling was indescribable. Not pleasant, exactly, just so full. He paused when he was sank all the way and gazed down at Sherlock, whose eyes had gone half-lidded in bliss. He swore he could feel Sherlock’s heartbeat as they sat there. It was peaceful waiting for John’s body to adjust, watching Sherlock’s face as he learned the feel of being inside of another person for the first time.
He felt Sherlock’s fingers clinch on his chest, and this time he grabbed Sherlock’s hand with both of his and held it close.
Later, his sandwich and his cuppa in his hands, he contemplated his sleeping flatmate; he contemplated the view from his chair to the TV. He also contemplated the inevitable crick in his neck from craning to see the TV from his chair. He made the decision.
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock!” John hissed, unable to told back his reaction. By instinct, he shielded the phone from prying eyes, even though no one else was in the room.
John scooted himself down under the covers all the way and pulled Sherlock’s head to rest in the crook of his neck. John himself liked this part of his lover’s bodies; he always found the warmth and the smell comforting. Sherlock seemed to agree. Gradually, his whole being turned to John like a flower to the sun. He nuzzled John's neck and his breathing became not faster or slower, but more peaceful. John sighed into his hair.
“Yes, I’ve already considered this,” said Sherlock, steepling his fingers under his chin. ”I don’t believe the arrangement should require strict guidelines, but I do have some stipulations.”
John pulled his hand away from Sherlock’s and rolled over onto his back. “Because the reason I didn’t notice you were miserable, and in pain, it’s really fucked up, Sherlock, and I’m afraid it’s just going to keep happening. I can’t do that to you, not now that I know.”
He felt when Sherlock drifted off; the soft, even rhythms of his breath lulled John into a sleepy haze, one where he wasn’t quite awake but not yet asleep, either. The image of Sherlock kept flashing into his mind: Sherlock closing his eyes in defeat, knowing that John would leave him. It was the last thing he saw before sleep took him.
“As much as I love watching that magnificent brain of yours deduce things, now is not the time. And anyway,
Sherlock obliged him, though John could tell he wasn’t pleased by the interruption. His face heated at the thought that he’d done this to Sherlock, made him languid with kisses. Bloody hell, if he’d known all it took to make Sherlock stop talking was a good snog, he’d have done it years ago. But John needed to talk. It was suddenly imperative that they were on the same page.
“John, enough, you’re becoming hysterical. This conversation was your idea. I’d be more than happy to keep having sex with you.”
Sherlock’s soft, warm belly provided just enough friction to John’s recovered erection . . . he groaned out his second orgasm of the night as Sherlock’s hips started to falter in imminent release.
That was when John realized he’d made two mistakes. First, he would have been better off next to Sherlock on the couch, because at least then his vision would have been limited to select body parts at a time. As it was, he was now being treated to the whole visual spectacle of Sherlock in the throes of uncontrollable pleasure (and John could now see that it was indeed pleasure), and that his hand was the instrument of that pleasure. The second mistake? Agreeing to this at all.
“The thing you have to understand, Sherlock, is that I didn’t know the real story—why you’d done what you’d done and how—for two years. All I knew,
This was when John realized Sherlock was still very much naked, and John had no idea what was about to happen to him.
“Oh, shit, hold on a second,” said John, climbing off Sherlock’s lap. “Lay down,” he said, pushing Sherlock back onto the bed, making sure the detective’s lube-covered hand didn’t touch the sheets.
“I assure you I am in earnest, and if you genuinely have no interest, by all means decline and no harm done. But I know my physical form does not repel you, and I would not have made such a proposal if I did not think there was a chance it would be accepted, no matter how often you proclaim your heterosexuality to anyone who will listen. I think such labels are beyond us now, don’t you?”
Meanwhile, Sherlock was repositioning their lower halves. Back went Sherlock’s thigh in between John’s legs, this time Sherlock deliberately pushed it up into John’s groin, pleasantly compressing John’s balls. His left hand snaked under John’s waist, coming to rest underneath the curve of John’s hip, and yes, cupping the side of John’s arse once again. It seemed Sherlock had a definite affinity for John’s arse.
Sherlock was genuinely surprised. He’d known before he asked that John wasn’t yet ready to start up that whole ridiculous rigamarole again, but he hadn’t been expecting 'never' as his answer. He’d thought maybe two more years, three at most, and the revolving door of women would start up again, but this was unexpected. Sherlock didn’t know what to say. He hadn’t prepared for this, and John looked so deflated. As if he’d come to a conclusion he didn’t like, but accepted it nonetheless.
The arrangement is no longer satisfactory for either party. Sherlock and John figure out what's next.
reaction was not small. Sherlock let out a long groan before John’s grip had even closed, and this time John couldn’t tell if it was a groan of pain or pleasure, or both. Sherlock’s cock was pulsing with heat in his hand
John reclaimed his place on Sherlock’s lap, and Sherlock immediately folded himself around John, planting tentative kisses along the skin above his breastbone, and the base of his throat.
A pause while Sherlock considered. John was not letting him look away. He wondered what John would think of him, what his reaction would be if he knew that Sherlock was already holding something back from him. That the parity John was striving for was already hopelessly lost. Had been lost for months. If he knew what Sherlock truly desired of him. Sherlock was certain he knew what John would say, how he would react, without having to ask. It would mean no arrangement. It might mean no John at all.
John’s hand left his penis and Sherlock almost cried out at the loss, but it soon became apparent that John had only stopped in order to move Sherlock’s loosened trousers further down, leaving Sherlock’s erection exposed to the open air. He could feel his testicles resting just under the band of his underwear.
He found himself soon drifting on waves of electrified nerve endings, as John’s mouth on his anus seemed to be stimulating his entire body. Goosebumps covered his skin, his prick was stiff and dripping onto his pillow (onto Mrs. Hudson’s freshly clean sheets, his mind supplied), and for the first time in his memory, he lost track of the world. It all faded away, and everything was John and his mouth and the sensations that were being wrung from his body, beyond his control.
He was unbearably close now. Their noses were almost touching. John closed his eyes and leaned his forehead until it rested against Sherlock’s. He sighed.
“Thought so. Now, have at it.” John moved to get up. “I’ll be in the other room. I’ll need to take your vitals when you’re finished.”
Sherlock breathed slowly and steadily for about five minutes, and his pulse, though still elevated, had ceased that feverish beating that had made John so nervous.
For a moment, there was nothing but a blank silence that felt markedly different from the quiet peace from just minutes before. John’s face was indescribable. Sherlock knew he hadn’t been expecting anything of the sort to fall from Sherlock’s lips and was probably still trying to formulate a response. Sherlock fought hard to maintain his outward calm, though his insides were roiling. It was nearly unbearable.
John kept stroking him through it, warm semen falling on his hand and shooting up to Sherlock’s chest and belly. He gradually tapered off the squeezes and pulls as Sherlock’s now-relaxed body began the come down from its five-hour high. John released Sherlock’s prick with one final, gentle pull, and Sherlock collapsed bonelessly back into the couch.
Sherlock seemed to be enjoying it as well. He was making soft little contented noises as John played with his hair, and he’d somehow managed to scoot his head even closer to John’s stomach, so that his face was practically buried in John’s jumper.
“Yes,” said Sherlock, his other hand moving to caress John’s thigh, though his voice trembled, just a little. And then John guided his hand back. He shivered and fought not to pull away as Sherlock’s index finger covered in cold lube brushed against him. Sherlock’s eyes never left his as his finger circled John’s tight opening, coaxing it to relax enough that Sherlock’s absurdly long finger could slip inside.
“Right,” said John, and began manhandling Sherlock to the center of the bed. When there was enough room, John stripped down to his boxer briefs, lifted the covers, and climbed in next to Sherlock.
The next week was made of agony. Normally Sherlock would take out his frustration on the mantelpiece, or the walls, or on John, but all three would be counterproductive in this particular instance. Lestrade delivered zero cases, and nothing of any interest whatsoever had come in over email. The parasitic twin distracted him for a small period of time, but even the small, perfectly articulated skull attached to the dead man’s back could not entirely overcome the roiling in his gut.
The next hour or so of John’s life was strange but lovely. Sherlock had indeed tasted every inch of John’s skin, bit by agonizing bit, and more than that besides. Most of the places Sherlock placed his mouth were to be expected: John’s nipples (Sherlock spent a long time there), his stomach, his navel, his hips and thighs, his fingers and hands. He had also been strangely fascinated with the skin on the inside of John’s elbows and knees, and had spent several leisurely minutes with his face shoved in John’s oxter.
Sherlock knew from experience that if she wasn’t seen to at this stage, the shrieks would increase in frequency and duration until she was red in the face and very hard to manage. John had shown him how to put her to bed soon after moving in, knowing there might be nights when it was just Rosie and Sherlock. He found the process comforting, and he didn’t even mind the singing. Sherlock wished he was going up with them now.
John looked up from his book in surprise. They were sitting companionably in their respective chairs by the fire, sipping the tea Mrs. Hudson had brought up earlier. It was cozy and homelike, and the perfect time for Sherlock to make his first move.
John’s eyes glanced quickly downward to Sherlock’s lap, and then back up again. Sherlock’s erection had now clearly gone, and in its place was a blooming patch of wetness.
Sherlock was content simply to watch John as he began to remove their clothing, first Sherlock’s, then his own. John took his time, savoring each item’s removal, and Sherlock thought he understood. John was enjoying the anticipation, teasing himself. Completely naked at last, John once again took Sherlock’s hand and led him to the bed. Sherlock sat on the edge, but when John attempted to push him back onto the bed and climb over him, Sherlock stopped him. There was something he wanted first. He pulled John close and bent his head, taking John into his mouth. It had been weeks and he hadn’t forgotten the taste of it.
He certainly smelled wonderful, Sherlock remembered that. Everything about that instance of fellatio was wonderful for Sherlock. John was warm and musky from being under his clothes all day. The wiry fuzz of his pubic hair tickled Sherlock’s lips and cheek. The smooth glide of John’s foreskin under his tongue, the thick fullness of John pulsing as he came right in Sherlock’s mouth, the bitter tang of his semen afterwards. All lovely and new.
And to Sherlock’s credit, he had tried, but his definitions of urgent and John’s couldn’t seem to line up. He was like a child, wanting what he wanted when he wanted it, and what he wanted was John to fix the things he broke. John, his own personal medical doctor comfort blanket, or perhaps safety net? But of course, John gave in more than not, because he was weak, and a sucker for people who thought they needed him, even if they didn’t really. If he was being honest with himself, he hated the idea of Sherlock in pain, any kind of pain. Even if that pain was almost entirely in his head. So if there weren’t patients counting on him, he did sometimes oblige Sherlock, enabling his melodrama.
And if he woke up Himself, who bloody well cared. John wanted crap telly and tea, and he wanted the sofa, so on the sofa he sat.
John kissed him again, a soft peck, and slid across the sheets to dig around in his bedside table, where he found what he’d been looking for: a half-used tube that John had purchased a couple of months before.
“Oh,” said John, embarrassed. “Sorry. Should have asked if I could do that.” He went to pull away and settle in for sleep, but Sherlock held him in place.
Once he had collected the necessary supplies, and brought Rosie down to Mrs. Hudson’s, he moved back into Sherlock’s bedroom, placing them on the bedside table.
“That’s different,” said Sherlock. “Hudders and I understand one another. I allow her to mother me, and she doesn’t evict us for putting bullets in her wall.”
“Yes,” said Sherlock, and stood there, waiting for John to take the lead, which it seemed he was all too happy to do.
“Git,” said John, scooting close to Sherlock. He cupped Sherlock’s face in his hands. “That was bloody brilliant,” he said, placing a soft kiss on Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock’s eyes widened, again with surprise.
He found himself constantly leaving rooms in order to get rid of erections. It was highly inconvenient.
Sherlock made the weakest of shrugs. John reached out and laid his hand on Sherlock’s forehead, stroking with his thumb. The movement caused a full body shiver from Sherlock, and for a moment, the light came back into his eyes, before fading away again. Sherlock tried feebly to push John’s hand away, but he didn’t seem to have the will for it.
“Oh, fuck,” said John, and Sherlock felt as one of John’s hands curled into his hair, cupping the back of his head. Goosepimples spread from the contact point all the way down to Sherlock’s tailbone, down his arms practically to the tips of his fingers. He moaned onto John’s cock, and John thrust up into Sherlock’s mouth in response. Sherlock gagged a little, but didn’t pull off.
He wasn’t going to even bother asking if Sherlock had condoms and lube. The lube he knew he’d need for sure; any way to make things smoother on Sherlock’s overstimulated bottom half. In fact, perhaps a condom, too, to blunt sensation? But no, didn’t want to drag this out too long, after what, almost five hours now? Perhaps it wouldn’t be the most enjoyable orgasm, but it would hopefully get the job done.
He couldn’t stop looking at Sherlock, who had a manic gleam in his eye, as if trouble were brewing. John loved that look, and hated it, too.
Sherlock was sat at the kitchen table seven evenings later, looking into his microscope when John came into the kitchen. He had yet to look up from his mold cultures, when John spoke.
By the time he got upstairs and had hung up his coat and scarf, John had finished pouring out a couple of fingers of whiskey into glasses, and handed one to Sherlock. Both of them downed the whiskey at once. The glasses safely on the kitchen table, John held out his hand. Surprised, Sherlock took it, and John led him into Sherlock’s bedroom, where Sherlock found John had already been. The bedding was turned down, and a bottle of lubricant and a condom graced Sherlock’s nightstand.
John stared at the screen in front of him, at a loss for the moment. Their last few texts had almost pushed the picture out of frame. John’s eyes studiously avoided looking directly at it again. He began typing furiously.
“Yes, John, a hand-job was my original intention. I didn’t think I’d have to spell it out for you. But then you went into doctor mode, and—”
“Oh, fuck,” said John, as Sherlock uttered simultaneously multitudes of Johns: ”John, John, John, John.”
“No,” said John, forcefully. “Let me finish.” Sherlock removed his hand from John’s head, but left the one on his chest.
Then John was pulling Sherlock’s face off the back of the couch. “Hold on to it,” he said, so Sherlock did, gripping the cushions as hard as he could. John tugged his head back so far that it rested on John’s shoulder, and his torso was arched back to align with John’s. He could hear John’s breath in his ear, and the exquisite pressure on his scalp sent ripples of pleasure from his head down his spine, all the way to his ankles.
Later, he wasn’t sure how long it lasted, only that he had been completely absorbed in his task, though he guessed it hadn’t lasted very long. It had been over a year since John had anything more than his own hand to work with, and the warmth of Sherlock’s mouth, the movements of his tongue, his lips (tight suction, up and down, swirling around the head, lapping up drops of pre-come), would feel wonderful. Sherlock liked the idea of making John feel wonderful.
“Do you think you could sit up for me?” asked John. Sherlock nodded weakly and began trying to hoist himself up. He still looked a bit shaky, so John helped a bit. John sat back against the headboard of Sherlock’s bed, propped up by several pillows and in reach of the bedside table, and pulled Sherlock so that they were sitting back to front, Sherlock’s head resting on John’s chest. His legs came up to bracket Sherlock’s body. Sherlock’s curls threatened to go up John’s nose in this position, but he didn’t move. Skin to skin contact was good for premature babies, so why not Sherlock as well?
This incident had concluded with John “eating him out” (sexual vocabulary could be so vulgar), his pyjama pants pulled down to his knees, while Sherlock knelt in his chair, still clutching his violin. Sherlock felt he’d gotten the better end on that one. John had brought himself off with his own hand, and Sherlock had come out of it with both a spectacular orgasm, and a new piece for solo violin, which he called “For John and his Tongue.”
“One, that each sexual encounter should be fully desired by both parties. Two, either party can initiate. Three, we will only engage in sexual relations at night when Rosie is asleep, or when she is out of the house.”
With his eyes still closed, and the silence, all he had to focus on were the sensations, which were quickly overwhelming him.
Sherlock blushed. He’d never blushed in his life before today, but he was blushing now. He was practically curled up into a ball at John’s feet, and was finding it unexpectedly difficult to look him in the eye.
, he’d smacked his head into a kitchen cabinet and wouldn’t leave John alone until John had come home from work to examine Sherlock’s skull personally. He’d felt unable to refuse that one, just on the off chance the git had actually concussed himself.
Much to Sherlock’s surprise, their third encounter didn’t happen until a week and a half later. He assumed upon reflection that John’s needs had been temporarily satisfied, and that he would initiate again when he needed to. Now that Sherlock had orgasmed—twice—with John, he was finding himself reluctant to be the initiator. There seemed a power in orgasms with John that orgasms by himself, or with his long ago partners, did not hold. Sherlock knew all too well what that power was, and shrunk back from it. He would wait for John.
The cataloging continued for a long while. John nearly came several more times, two of which were during Sherlock’s interlude with his prick, perhaps the longest ten minutes of John’s life. When he was sure he couldn’t take much more of it, Sherlock abruptly straddled him, slicked up John’s cock, and lowered himself down. This all happened very fast; John hadn’t even noticed Sherlock preparing himself, and now Sherlock’s tight passage was gripping him, and he thought he might die.
At last, Sherlock moved, combing his fingers through the wiry gray and blonde curls that surrounded John’s cock, and then came to rest there. He gripped the base tentatively, still feeling it out, not yet giving pleasure. John found it impossible to remain still during this tortuous exploration. His hips bucked, the motion causing his erection to slide up through Sherlock’s open hand, and along his wrist before he could manage to still himself again.
He watched as a slow, lewd smile appeared on John’s face, and then John was up like a shot, stumbling clumsily out of his clothes in his haste. Off came the shoes, socks, trousers, and jacket. Before he took off his shirt, he pulled a small packet of lubricant and a condom out of his chest pocket and threw them onto the bed with Sherlock, who had not moved in the slightest. He was mesmerized by this tipsy display of casual nudity. At last only his pants remained, and he crawled onto the bed. Sherlock rolled so that he was on his back, facing John, who promptly yanked down the single layer of bedding that covered Sherlock’s naked form.
“Sherlock, we need to talk about what’s been happening to you,” and though John was still speaking he saw Sherlock’s face do something indescribable that he couldn’t get a read on. He continued, “You’re my best mate, Sherlock, and our friendship is really important to me.” John looked down, he couldn’t look at Sherlock while he said these things, he just couldn’t. “
And to make it even worse, John was entirely sure Sherlock had no idea about any of it. Sherlock had told him right from the beginning that his main motivation in all of this was to explore his sexual side for the first time, and he’d been asking for John’s help to do so. John had not obliged. John had taken over.
John knew it was paranoia, but he couldn’t help checking Sherlock’s pulse one more time. Steady and slow.
“Please,” said Sherlock, forcing himself upright, and pulling his trousers clumsily up his legs. As he stood, John held out his hand, proffering the wet cloth. Sherlock took it, and as quickly as he was able with his fettered body still twitching in places, he stumbled into his room and closed the door.
“I don’t know! I don’t know, okay, I just know that I am. These feelings, they just sit down there in my gut, and they never go away, and you almost die five times a week, and I really couldn’t take that, Sherlock, I really couldn’t handle that.”
“This isn’t an emergency, Sherlock. You’re fine,” he’d said, relieved. “It doesn’t even need stitches. Just put some ointment on, and wrap it up with gauze.”
When he woke up several hours later, John stretched, and with a feeling of simultaneous dread and excitement, headed down the stairs. Sherlock wasn’t in the sitting room or the kitchen. With not a little trepidation, he knocked on Sherlock’s closed bedroom door.
But he heard nothing from Sherlock. Only the wet slide of his hand on John’s prick, the swoosh of skin on skin. And his own heavy breathing.
“Hmm,” said Sherlock, “I still have plans for you.” He pulled his fingers out of John’s arsehole, wiped them on the sheets, and placed a sweet kiss on John’s right arse cheek.
As it turned out, there were weeks in between the tipsy bed sex and the next time John decided he needed sexual release with another person, but Sherlock wasn’t surprised this time by the delay. John seemed wary, almost ashamed of what he had done with Sherlock while slightly intoxicated. He was very polite to Sherlock for days afterwards, even when Sherlock was being extremely annoying on purpose to test him out. Sherlock supposed he needed to build up his courage again. Or perhaps, he was just not in the mood? Sherlock knew John was attracted to him, but attraction was fickle. He didn’t take it personally.
“The alternative is that we bundle you up and take you to A&E. I can guarantee you won’t like the way they’re going to help you out.”
Sherlock endeavored to be as normal as possible. He vaguely insulted John’s intelligence, blew something up in the microwave, and screeched incomprehensible tunes on his violin (Rosie was very amused by this, and joined in with screeches of her own), but his heart wasn’t in any of it. How long did a person need to THINK? Surely this decision would have taken minutes at most for Sherlock.
“Several times over the years. All attempts ended in dissatisfaction for both parties. The feelings simply weren’t there on my part.”
After Sherlock had retreated to his room and not come out until the middle of the night (John had heard him turning on the shower, though it didn’t seem to take nearly as long as Sherlock’s showers usually did), John had done some research. It didn’t take long to learn that his approach to sex with Sherlock was fucked up. If he was going to dominate Sherlock in bed, there were things he needed to do, they needed to do together, which they (he) had absolutely not done. There had been no discussion of limits, no safewords, and the consent on Sherlock’s part had been iffy at best. There had been no aftercare, and with a pang of adrenaline that started in his gut and seemed to run all along his arms down to his fingers, he wondered just how often Sherlock had been crashing after their encounters. That was almost certainly what had happened the last time. There had certainly been no equalizing of power afterwards; that would have involved actual communication.
As if John needed reminding. His penis gave a soft twitch of awareness upon hearing the word ‘orgasm’ fall from Sherlock’s lips.
“Yes,” said Sherlock. “I thought it was me, I thought that’s just how it was for me, with sex. And you did everything I asked of you. Why do you want to end the arrangement?” Sherlock had been holding onto this hand the whole time, and now John felt Sherlock’s thumb begin to stroke over his wrist. “If I can have just the pleasure without the rest of it, I want that.”
“Sherlock, why are you telling me about an octopus’s penis?” asked John, pausing slightly, not really expecting an answer. He was undeniably aware of the proximity of his own penis to Sherlock’s thigh muscles. “Why are you in my bed?”
He was able to move quickly enough to save his food being squashed into a pillow for Sherlock’s head, but not quickly enough for his brain to do anything about moving himself. His mad flatmate, whom he’d jerked off not an hour before—lest we forget!— was now lying with his tousled head on John’s lap. Curling himself around John’s middle like a comma. With sex hair.
John’s mind had already fast-forwarded past the act. It seemed easier that way, to think of it as something he’d already done.
“Sherlock, just so you know, this thing, us, whatever us is right now, I’m, er, I'm in,” said John, rather awkwardly. He felt Sherlock lightly kiss the place where his neck met his shoulder.
He’d banged his shins on the baby gate more than a handful of times, as he crashed around the apartment. But it was a fair trade-off for having the Watsons in his life.
“That’s why I was so angry with you, Sherlock, because when I say you were the most important person in my life, I mean that I’d never felt about anyone the way I felt about you. I was drawn to you, in awe of your intelligence, couldn’t stop looking at you. It was the dangerous aura about you, I thought, the way you’d saved my life and gave me purpose, gave me excitement and puzzles and danger. I was jealous and a little heartbroken when I saw you disdain normal human life, when you were so drawn to Moriarty, because I thought that meant you disdained me.  I would have taken a bullet for you, back then, Sherlock, stepped right in front of the gun. Did do, didn’t I? That first year. But I wouldn’t have understood why. Why you had to be protected at all costs, even with my own life.
have you, it would kill me, like looking at the sun straight on. But I couldn’t say no to you, to that. And I fucked it all up. I’m so sorry, Sherlock.”
Sherlock and John engage in rough sex without any discussion of boundaries or hard limits. They don't have a safeword. John is oblivious to what's going on with Sherlock, and Sherlock doesn't know why he keeps crashing after sex. The chapter ends with John taking Sherlock roughly on the sofa without a condom. Sherlock enjoys the encounter, but John drives it entirely, and afterwards, Sherlock has a breakdown because John hasn't been taking care of him after they have sex.
He mumbled something too softly for John to hear. He seemed to be intent on using both John’s hand and John’s pillow as a shield.
“That’s not exactly a great application of the scientific method, Sherlock. I believe you’re forgetting a variable, a rather sizable one . . .”
At John’s evident pleasure, Sherlock seemed to gain confidence. John tried to keep his eyes open as Sherlock’s fingers worked him open, brushing his prostate every now and then. John’s cock was half-hard now, and Sherlock’s eyes were vivid below him, fascinated by the reactions he was pulling from John. He looked as though he was discovering how to play some new type of sexy violin.
Understatement again. Bloody hell. Probably there was something Sherlock wasn’t telling him. John thought for a moment before he texted back.
“As you know, recent events have led to my reevaluating some things. Though I have cultivated my logical mind extensively, I have been repressing certain parts of my biology and my emotions, as I believed them a liability, and a waste of time. As you are also aware, I have realized this attitude has been quite harmful to me, and have been taking steps to correct it.”
He spent the rest of the night lying awake in his bed, imagining every possible future scenario for John’s answer, telling himself surely John wouldn’t have reacted so outlandishly if Sherlock’s proposal hadn’t hit a nerve.
He strengthened his grip on Sherlock’s hair, and tilted back Sherlock’s head. Sherlock’s mouth dropped open, and he felt himself go limp.
As he brought both hands back to his side, the elbow of his jacket brushed across just the place Sherlock didn’t seem to want contact. Sherlock’s reaction was immediate. His hips lifted up off the couch, and he groaned, but in pain, not pleasure. Blood rushed to John’s face out of embarrassment, but Sherlock’s obviously genuine reaction also made John want to help him very badly. He reached out with his right hand and took Sherlock’s left, which was currently bunched at his side, fisting at his pants.
Sherlock pulled John to the middle of the bed and urged him to lie down, on top of the covers. “I want to see you,” said Sherlock.
Just some smut, no biggie. And the smut expanded while writing, so whoops, there will actually be four chapters.
John broke their stalemate after Sherlock had been particularly brilliant solving a case involving a missing five year old girl. She’d disappeared from her bedroom at the top of a seven story building with windows that didn’t open, and her parents in the next room. The police, of course, had been baffled, the parents distraught. Sherlock only took the case when he had satisfied himself that neither of them had done it.
John opened the lid on the lube and squirted a generous amount onto his palm. He made sure to rub his hands together to warm it up. The last thing Sherlock needed on his overheated prick
Sherlock had been thinking of the best way to start this conversation now for days, and he hoped the words he’d settled on would get him the information he needed. He’d thought up a hundred different ways to trick this information out of John, but in the end had settled on simply asking him.
John felt a flicker of disappointment when he realized Sherlock’s position prevented him from being able to touch Sherlock’s lips. Probably for the best, that. John wasn’t sure he would be able to prevent this from becoming a sexual encounter rather than remaining a comforting one if he had the opportunity to touch those lips. Lips, if he was being honest with himself, he’d not been able to stop himself from thinking about in a rude fashion on several occasions. Lips that hours before had uttered John’s name while the rest of Sherlock was occupied having an orgasm.
“Surely you haven’t changed so much in the years we’ve lived apart, John,” Sherlock managed, recovering himself. “You’ve always been,” Sherlock paused a fraction of a second to search for the right word, “ . . . voracious.”
.” Sherlock’s eyes seemed calm and clear as he said this, still attempting to maintain control over his breathing, but John could see he wasn’t out of the woods just yet. Enough stimulus could push him right back in to the panic attack.
“In the last 24-hours alone we’ve both given each other handies, so the first one’s definitely off the table,” said John helpfully, unable to silence the giggle he felt rising up in him. He was feeling punch drunk with lust and the unexpected intimacy of Sherlock in his bed, under his duvet.
. Those words at the heights of passion had inflamed him, but now they stuck in his throat. As if he were the one who ever went anywhere. Sherlock would be boneless for the next thirty minutes at least, and John would be out the door, running some errand, meeting a friend, off to work, to bed, to pick up Rosie, to make a cup of tea.
“How far do you want to take this?” John whispered close to Sherlock’s ear, then kissed the soft skin below it.
“No, John. I am a virgin, if you are in need of a label, though I confess I find the need to box human behavior into such socially constructed and ultimately meaningless categories rather tedious. The patriarchal obsession with sexual purity is absurd.”
“Why do you think my hand will do it for you, when your own wouldn’t? Presumably, your hand is more familiar with the, er,
“Yes, until you touched me. Imagine my surprise, John, when your touch not only didn’t frustrate or repulse me, but actively added to my pleasure.”
They made it to three fingers, and now both of them were breathing hard. They just looked at each other as the sounds of Sherlock preparing John faded into the background.
John didn’t know what to say. He got up, pulling his pants back up his hips, and stopped to pick up the rest of his clothes.
John stood up slowly, adjusting himself as he went, and headed to the kitchen where he rinsed his hands, and soaked a cloth in the warm, flowing water. He squeezed out the excess and headed back to Sherlock, who was plainly fast asleep on the sofa. The sight was oddly comforting. John wiped the warm washcloth over Sherlock’s chest and belly, and then braved the lower district as well. He’d probably be out for hours, and it was no good waking up covered in dried come.
John was reminded of his thought earlier in the day, wondering whether Sherlock had ever had any kind of previous sexual contact with another human being, and he still had no definitive answer. John had the uncomfortable feeling, having now experienced his kissing technique firsthand, that that afternoon’s hand job had indeed been a first, though surely he’d kissed before? Experimented? Sherlock was one of the most dangerously curious men he knew. He wouldn’t have ignored such a large field of knowledge, would he?
When John got up in the morning and stretched on tiptoe to reach the mugs Sherlock had placed just out of reach for this very purpose, his t-shirt riding up and showing his belly and the dimples on his lower back, Sherlock got an erection. John stepping fresh out of the bathroom in the morning in nothing but bare feet and a robe gave Sherlock an erection. One particularly threadbare white t-shirt of John’s was so old that in just the right light, Sherlock could see John’s nipples, and he got an erection. John sucking on the tip of his pen whilst doing the crossword gave Sherlock an erection. John kissing Rosie on her neck and then giggling made Sherlock wish John would kiss
All thoughts of his cock dispersed when he realized that his neck was wet. Sherlock was crying, silently, it would seem, and had been for quite a while.
One afternoon, in the middle of a case (involving drug smugglers, imported hedgehogs, and a decapitated head found in Hyde Park), Sherlock was contemplating his notes back at the flat, which were currently pinned up all over the wall behind the sofa, as he was wont to do. It helped to spacialize his thoughts, to form tangible connections. He heard the front door slam, then John came stomping up the stairs, clearly agitated, breaking Sherlock’s train of thought entirely.
When had he put that there? John tried to remember, and couldn’t. Sherlock’s hand was large and sturdy, and it felt nice against the bare skin of John’s lower back. The fingers were mimicking the movements John had made earlier on Sherlock’s scalp, curling and uncurling. He supposed this was Sherlock’s way of returning the favor, of petting him back.
Sherlock liked this position. It didn’t feel quite as good on his prostate, but he liked seeing John’s face as they coupled, liked being able to look down and see it actually happening. Every time John’s penis disappeared inside him, Sherlock got a little thrill. It was like an incredibly sexy magic trick.
“Sherlock,” he managed to say, but Sherlock only made a “mmm?” noise into his neck. “Sherlock!” said John, louder.
“Yes. Yes, John. That. Please.”  John kissed the top of his curly head while Sherlock breathed into his neck.
“Yes, but that’s the problem,” said John, pulling Sherlock’s hand away from his face, but he didn’t want to let go, so they ended up sort of holding hands. Sherlock’s were large and dry and warm. “Do you know about BDSM?”
“Somewhere in the last five hours or so, we stopped being just friends and roommates. I’m not going to pretend I didn’t know exactly what you were asking me when you asked if you could touch me. Call it whatever you like, sexual partners, lovers”—Sherlock’s face moued in distaste at the last word—”but there are certain things you do when you’re having sex with someone, particularly someone you care for, and one of those things is respecting your partner’s history and their boundaries. I can’t do that if I don’t know what those boundaries are. Normally, I’d be able to make a good guess, but . . .”
he knew it would happen soon. Sherlock was non-verbal with pleasure, but his body was beginning to go taut again, his hips rising ever so slightly with the building tension that comes before a release. A lightning bolt ran straight from John’s gut to his dick at the sight. Sherlock's cock thickened in his fist.
When John had satisfied himself of rubbing his semen gently into Sherlock’s nethers, he crawled up Sherlock’s prone body and collapsed onto the bed next to him, exhausted.
John seemed to understand; he increased his pace and tightened his grip. Sherlock’s breathing was heavy and loud. The bee documentary droned on in the background.
This time John did smack him, right on his luscious arse. And then they kissed until they fell asleep.
“Sherlock, I need you to open your eyes for me. That’s good,” he said as Sherlock complied. His eyes were wide and a little panicked as they met John’s, the pupils dilated, the whites a little bloodshot. John was momentarily thrown. It was unsettling to see Sherlock like this, so out of control. No, out of control wasn’t exactly right. He seemed . . . helpless?
His fingers found Sherlock’s pulse again. “Just keep breathing, mate,” said John. “I’ve got you. This is not a huge problem and you’re going to be okay.”
“Oi,” said John, “be respectful now! He’s not some spectacle for you to ogle. He’s a person whose life has just ended. And don’t go asking Molly if you can bring back bits of him to examine, either. I do not want to find any small formerly parasitic men stashed in the butter dish.”
But there was only so much one could allow their flatmate to get away with. There were some boundaries you just shouldn’t cross.
“Yes, I see,” said Sherlock. “You’ve never encountered anyone like me in your many and varied sexual liaisons.”
He was grateful for John’s presence in his life, but it had most definitely been easier before he knew what he was missing. He’d scoffed at sentiment and human companionship for most of his life, and now he longed for it, missed it when it was gone.
As if in a fugue, he made it up to his room, retrieved his lube and was back sitting next to the prone Sherlock, who once again had his eyes closed. John’s trip upstairs had seemed to take forever, and yet no time at all. Jesus, this was going to be weird. He realized before he started that he was going to need a better angle. He supposed he could keep sitting next to Sherlock on the couch, but he would have to move much closer, and that seemed a step beyond. He needed to maintain a professional distance. Instead, he pulled up an ottoman and placed it in between Sherlock’s already spread knees.
Several hours later, he was awoken by a tentative knock at his door, and a crack of bright light shining over his eyes. He blinked and saw John standing in the doorway, a sheepish expression on his face.
“Hand cramp,” John said, once again grasping Sherlock’s penis. This time Sherlock couldn't help it. He let out a sort of whimper that turned into a sharp intake of breath as John ran his thumb over the slit, gathering up the pre-come that had begun to leak out, and using it to lubricate his thumb as it continued making circular motions. When it passed over Sherlock’s frenulum, Sherlock thrust up with his hips and let his head fall back onto the sofa. His face and genitals were warm with blood.
John’s fingers found the pulse point on Sherlock’s neck and he looked at his watch to get a reading. Sherlock’s heartbeat thumped feverishly against his fingers. His skin was hot and slightly damp. John kept counting. Heart rate elevated, but not critical yet, though Sherlock was clearly in distress. He didn’t need to take Sherlock’s pulse to know that, though it would be a handy gauge in the next few hours.
John’s hands were now fisted at his sides, and his hair was stuck up on the sides of his head. He looked somewhat deranged.
A jolt of adrenaline shot through Sherlock’s system and he was instantly alert, though he tried not to betray it on the outside. Looking calmly back at John, who looked rather adorably hopeful, he simply said, “All right.”
Sherlock remained floating, but it didn’t feel so pleasant or warm anymore. He felt unmoored and rather alone. An ache welled up in his throat and he tried to push it back down.
“Er, Sherlock, I know it’s not really your area, married to your work and all, but you do know that sex and dating aren’t mutually exclusive?”
“I know you framed this as a mutually beneficial arrangement, and I would very much like that to be the reality, but I also know that you don’t have much experience with this sort of thing.”
Things are going to get a little bit dicey and emotional for Sherlock next chapter. He doesn't quite know what he wants/needs, let alone how to ask for it.
“Right, well, not that long of a story as it turns out,” babbled Sherlock, clearly on board with this new plan. “Never wanted to have sex before. Now I do. The end. Your arse is touching my skin, please can I touch it back—oh.”
“Hands up next to your head. No, loosely, like that, and leave them there unless I tell you otherwise.”
He felt John scoot closer towards him; John was warm against his side. The nature documentary was featuring a man who was being followed through the desert by a swarm of so-called killer bees. The man was being stung through his protective suit. Had been stung fourteen times so far.
“I didn’t realize until after you were gone what all those things meant, together, and you were gone, so what did it matter anyway? I was angry with you for leaving me before I knew my own mind, and for not loving me the way that I loved you, and how none of it fucking mattered anyway, because you were never coming back. But you did come back, didn’t you? And suddenly the thing I wanted most—you were there, and you were smiling like a tit, without a care in the world for how you made me feel or what you’d left behind. Good old John, he’ll be here when you’re reading for him, no need to consider his feelings. I punched you. A lot. I’m not proud of it. But dammit, Sherlock.”
“Penetrative sex?” said John, teasing him, and Sherlock’s head fell down to John’s shoulder, as if it were all suddenly too much to bear.
“Actually, I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately,” said John. “I don’t think I’m going to do it anymore. Er, date, that is. I think that part of my life is over. I’m done.”
“We cannot know the circumstances of every sexual encounter we will have, John. It might not be wise to set such a potentially unmeetable rule.”
Finally, Sherlock betrayed signs of lucidity, but he didn’t completely untangle himself from John, only shifted so that they were facing one another, his head lying on John’s pillow.
“This isn’t sex, John. This is a medical procedure for your patient who is in great distress. If it doesn’t work quickly, I will allow you to take me to A&E.”
“On your front,” said John, giving the side of Sherlock’s arse a light smack, with the easy confidence of the slightly drunk.
He was flustered. This wasn’t going well. He would never get the data he needed if John wouldn’t comply to his perfectly structured social engineering!
John was definitely fighting off a smile now. He was going to make Sherlock say it, he was going to—
It was at this point that John realized he was almost completely naked, save for the shirt that was still rucked up to his chest. He pulled it the rest of the way off, and used it to clean up the rest of his mess, most of which had landed on his sheets. When he was done, he threw the shirt onto the floor with his other dirty clothes and pulled the duvet up around him, snuggling in. Sherlock just watched him.
“Tell me to stop if you don’t like it,” said John, echoing their first encounter, and that was all the warning he got before John’s mouth descended upon him.
Sherlock was wrapped around him from head to toe. His head was tucked under John’s jaw, his face pressed into the curve of John’s neck. John could feel every breath Sherlock took, the rise and fall of his chest, which was firmly snugged against John’s, and he had insinuated one of his long legs in between John’s as well. One of his hands was tucked under the pillow below his head, but his other was clasped around the small of John’s back, dangerously close to John’s arse.
It was obvious to John that Sherlock was determined to use John as some sort of self-soother until his exhaustion passed, whether or not that was something that John actually wanted.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, just nodded, his eyes locked on John’s. John knew they weren’t out of the woods quite yet.
Sherlock was still staring at him. “I am not leaving this bed. If we go out there, you will not tell me what I wish to know.”
“Sherlock, I can’t do this right now. Can we go get some tea? I’ll make you a nice fry-up.” John checked his phone on the nightstand for the time. It was almost noon.  “Mrs. Hudson only has Rosie until two, and then she’s got tea with Mrs. Turner.”
“I just got off the phone with Greg,” said John, his breath heaving. Sherlock knew if he looked, John’s face would be squashed up in anger, his fists clenched.
Of course, despite John’s expectation of honesty, he didn’t tell John any of this. He wouldn’t know how even if he wanted to. How would that conversation go?
When he was done spasming into his best friend’s hand, he sank back down into the mattress, warm contentment spreading through his limbs.
Sherlock loomed over him on all fours. “Hello,” he said. “Close your eyes.” John obliged, not sure for once whether or not he didn’t want to see what was happening to him. He felt as Sherlock lowered himself so that he was nearly pressed top to tail with John. Sherlock’s still soft cock brushed gently against John’s belly button, which was fairly distracting on its own, until Sherlock began placing soft kisses on John’s upturned face: His nose, his cheeks, his brow, the side of his face, his chin, and then down to his neck. Sherlock moved so that his weight only half landed on John, and half on the bed, and this gave him easy access to John’s neck and the underside of his ear, both of which Sherlock proceeded to lay claim to with sucking kisses, licks and gentle nips in turn. He trailed kisses around the circle of John’s neck until he reached the other side and started the whole process again.
When Sherlock came back to himself, he remembered the terms of their agreement. John seemed to be intently focused on the bee documentary, but before Sherlock could say anything, reached down to unfasten his own trousers, and pushed them down. The tip of his erect prick was peeking out of the top of his pants.
Seemingly in response, Sherlock shifted his arm up so that the crook was now resting on top of his head, and slowly and with obvious effort, opened his eyes.
John looked down at Sherlock’s face, lax in obvious genuine sleep. Sherlock was close enough that John could feel his warm breath heating the fabric of John’s jumper where it lay over his belly. In and out. In and out. Warm, then cool. Warm, then cool. He looked . . . peaceful.
He would have lost it right then if all those weeks of prolonged masturbation hadn’t improved his stamina. He’d given plenty of blow jobs, but he’d never been on the receiving end before. It felt lovely and warm, and John seemed to be enjoying himself. Sherlock had already been pretty close to his climax when John pulled out, so it didn’t take long before he was fisting John’s hair, trying to get enough oxygen into his lungs to warn him. John didn’t pull away, and Sherlock came with a silent scream, that floaty feeling once again descending upon him.
It didn’t take long after that for Sherlock to achieve climax. John had pulled out a tissue from his pocket and caught the mess before it landed on Sherlock’s shirt. Sherlock’s vision was full of stars, and he was warm and sleepy. He lifted his hips automatically when John pulled his trousers back up and tucked him inside.
He felt as John reached up for a pillow and propped it under Sherlock’s hips, raising Sherlock’s arse slightly into the air. His legs automatically shifted apart, and the cool air from the open window blew across his bare flesh.
John had risen from his chair, obviously unable to contain himself, and began pacing about the room, his hands clutching his hair.
Was Sherlock now supposed to say, “You’re welcome”? It seemed an inappropriate response to a sexual encounter that had made him prematurely ejaculate while still wearing his trousers.
“Yes,” he was now muttering to himself, as if he’d forgotten John was present. “Yes, the sexual feelings must be a natural outgrowth of my affection for you, John, but further experimentation will be necessary.”
It wasn’t Sherlock’s penis Sherlock should be worried about doing damage to. It was his heart. Erections, the whole human sexual response, they weren’t meant to be sustained over long periods of time, and with the drugs in his system . . . it was unlikely, but there was a definite chance if Sherlock didn’t relax and get some, er,
John knew he needed therapy, but he just couldn’t bring himself to go. A part of him guessed that if he opened up the lid on everything he kept tight inside himself, he would explode, but what he feared was what came after that explosion. He didn’t want to know what kind of person would be left afterwards.
“I’ve done the whole friends with benefits thing before, and it can work, if you’re honest with your partner from the start about your expectations and your boundaries, and if you’re honest, you know,
“Color?” asked Sherlock, finally lifting his head, then lowering it immediately to a new target. His lips were already swelling and his face bore the marks of John’s stubble as he drew John’s left nipple into his mouth, gently scraping it with his teeth.
