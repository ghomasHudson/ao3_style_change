Would Steve care, Tony wondered, that he followed Steve’s note about breakfast that morning? Ugh, Tony was embarrassed just from thinking that. He quickly tapped in an appointment request and tossed his phone somewhere on the bed to push his worries from his mind.
Steve was becoming more familiar with what he enjoyed in bed with every evening he spent with Tony. He enjoyed holding Tony in place, with his bare hands or with Tony’s leather. He pulled just a bit tighter on his thigh; he would love to have Tony in his ropes.
One hand found the top button on Tony’s dress shirt and Tony’s breath hitched. He grabbed Steve’s wrist and shook his head. Steve wordlessly lowered his hand to Tony’s belt buckle instead.
“So, I had an idea: if I really just need to let out the sexual energy, or whatever…” Steve felt his cheeks heat just a bit. “I figure I can isolate that variable by setting myself up as an escort. If it’s just a sexual outlet that I need, it would do the trick. I found some places that hire online.”
he remembered Steve’s reaction when he had pulled the leash taut, blocking his own breath in bursts as Steve fucked him for the second time last night.
Steve had been actively keeping Tony out of his mind, but that comment reminded Steve of his note to Tony that morning.
The pet-name struck Tony, and another shiver ran down his spine. “Please,” Tony whimpered. “Please, Sir, let me come.” Tony worked desperation into every syllable, needing to express his need in his voice since Steve couldn’t see his face.
He still had an hour before the appointment was officially at its end, but he did not think he would be able to fall back asleep. He spent the remainder of his time holding Tony close, thumb stroking Tony’s shoulder through the silk shirt.
Before Steve could locate the toggle for the shower, the water began to flow from overhead. The temperature was at a glorious heat, soothing Steve’s muscles. The water turned back off when he stepped away. He slid the glass door closed behind him and began to rub himself down with the towel Tony had provided him with. He dropped it into the basket by the door where he spotted Tony’s towel.
He turned and left as quickly as he could to avoid running into Cap on the way to the elevator. Maybe JARVIS would care to explain why Cap was reported to be present in the apartment when he was not. Tony hopped onto the elevator and was about to ask for the workshop when his phone vibrated.
A king sized four post bed with dark, soft sheets was illuminated as they entered. The automated lighting made Steve start gently, and Tony smiled. He loved when that happened. Tony led them forward to the side of the bed. He removed his watch and put his phone down on the bedside table. He looked to Steve, who stood by him, watching.
Tony nodded, eyes and cheeks burning. “Fuck—yes, Sir.” His voice shook when Steve thrust his two fingers deep inside him, slick with lube that Tony was too distracted to notice Steve applied.
“Well, if you wanted to, you could wake me up by touching me, or… fingering me, or, I—I have to admit I haven’t bottomed in a long time, but if you could, I’d love to wake up with you fucking me, it’s um—it’s a, a bit of a kink of mine.” Tony’s blush was rising again, and he wanted to hide his face against Steve’s shoulder again, but that time had passed.
. Steve moaned when Tony began to suck and swallow around his erection as it was paused in his mouth. “Fuck, you want it that badly? Want me to shoot down your throat, Tony?”
He set about making himself breakfast before he would head down to the gym, or maybe find Natasha before she found
Pepper rolled her eyes, taking up her coffee cup. “I know you’re already on it, Tony.” She took a sip. “Now tell me about the mystery man.”
Tony sighed as he heard the bathroom door close behind him. He didn’t feel ready for sleep just yet, but he got comfortable nonetheless. He slipped under the sheets and he listened to the sound of the water running in the next room.
A knot in his throat nearly made Tony forget how to breathe. He tried to hide his gasp for air before he summoned the words Steve had stalled his beautiful thick talented fingers for.
Steve looked up to meet Tony’s eyes, watching for cues, consent. Tony’s throat was raw, eyes glazed, mouth pink and lips swollen. He looked well-fucked and he took a deep breath before nodding quietly.
Steve’s strength had been something he still needed to get accustomed to in civilian life. He exhausted himself on the punching bags in the SHIELD gymnasium, spending hours alone with his thoughts.
“Natasha knows?” Tony looked like he was about to cry. Steve could hear the hammering of Tony’s heart and just wanted to hold him.
“I was wondering,” Tony began as they sat together on the couch. Knees touching again. “How do you feel about a little roleplay?” Tony spoke as if every word were a flower petal he was plucking, hoping for his wish to come true.
This piqued Steve’s interest and he watched Tony’s expression for tells. Hints as to what Tony could be thinking. He slid one hand warmly from his own thigh onto Tony’s, “That sounds like fun,” he said, smiling.
“Okay, Tony, I think one more question and then we can go to the bedroom. One more bite, yes, good boy.” Steve stroked Tony’s hair again as he chewed. “You listed somnophilia. Tell me what you’d like.”
Steve manually turned on the showerhead, bringing it to a soothing warm temperature before instructing Tony to step under the spray. “I’ll have to clean you myself.” Steve said, feeling silly as he pushed along this narrative, but Tony’s face was red, his pupils wide, and Steve felt assured he was doing well.
Steve nodded slowly, wordlessly, watching Tony’s reaction. Then, he added, “not anything that we’ve been doing! She just knows that you and I have been meeting.”
Steve nodded tightly, breathing in through his nose deeply. “Yes, Sir,” He whispered, closing his eyes as the ropes shifted with his heavy breathing.
Steve reached out to touch Tony’s elbow, just for a quick second, smiling. “Tell me what you’d like to talk about.”
As he stepped back out to his bedroom, towel wrapped tightly around his hips, Steve picked up his cell phone to look through the request list for tonight. He hummed, scrolling through the items with his thumb, and his other hand clutching his cotton towel.
Tony cringed at the words. He didn’t need to be congratulated on making it to the shower. He was not that pathetic. He held Steve’s hand tighter.
“Tony,” Steve tried to chastise him, but it was weak. “I didn’t know what to expect the first time we… had an appointment. But, it’s become a lot bigger and messier and more fantastic than I ever dreamed.”
“I… thought it would be safe. With you. If I cared for someone, I thought it would be good. And… it was. It was different from the other people I’d been with. You were different and I craved you every second I wasn’t with you.” Steve ran out of words, and Tony was standing stiffly, left hand clutching the edge of the countertop beside him.
“Or do you want it slow? Soft, sweet? Want the sap of lovemaking?” Steve ignored the fact that he had experienced none of that before. “Staring into each other’s eyes as I make you come on my cock?” Steve internally winced when his voice waivered. Tony whined, eyes squeezing shut, arching up to gain more friction against Steve’s hard cock.
After the longest second of his life, Steve heard Tony let out a little chuckle. His hand came up to rub Steve’s muscular arm. “It’s alright, Steve, you don’t have to keep it up now. Just relax, be you.”
“Did I tell you to stop, Stark?” Steve’s grip slid from Tony’s shaft down to his balls, a hint of a threat. Tony whimpered, hot breath rushing down the valley between Steve’s pecs. Before he could get his mouth back on Steve, he was pushed back down onto the mattress, Captain America’s body looming over his.
“Well, let’s not get tangled up in technicalities. I technically make money off doing whatever you want for 12 hours tonight.”
Tony followed the order once Steve gave a small tug on his leash. When Tony planted his second knee on the bed, Steve laid a swift slap on his right ass cheek. Tony let out a gasp and looked over his shoulder wordlessly at Steve as he continued to crawl to the center of the bed.
“You have a beautiful home.” The man began, smiling at Tony with all the charm of a boy scout. He held out an open palm. “My name is Steve.”
The panic that pulsed through Tony’s veins as they walked towards the living room couch had him about to run to the nearest exit until Steve’s hand closed around his wrist as they sat together, knees touching. He breathed.
When Steve was close, he summoned all of his strength of will to pull out, drinking in the delicious sight before him. Tony, teary-eyed and messy around his mouth, looking up at him with hazy awe and curiosity. What would come next, Tony looked to be wondering through his veil of subspace.
Steve then felt bad about keeping Tony completely clothed so he reached up for the top button of Tony’s shirt. When he made contact, Tony’s let out a weak but sharp gasp and grabbed Steve’s wrist. He wordlessly shook his head, staring into Steve’s eyes. That was alright. Steve could live without taking off Tony’s shirt.
Steve hummed, thinking. Thinking? Was he not into it? Obviously, he wasn’t into it, that’s so fucking sketchy, Tony shouldn’t have asked—it’s not too late to take it back, he could just say he changed his mind! He—
“What, you think something’s wrong with me?” He had asked, giving a soft chuckle to mask the insecurity he was voicing.
Steve watched Tony carefully, pretending that he could not feel his heart pounding in his throat. “Your first time?” Steve asked, kissing Tony at the first chance he had when Tony climbed over him slowly.
Steve lifted Tony’s hips with ease to tug his pants and boxers down. Tony’s cock bobbed freely, hard and dark red from waiting. Steve’s warm fingers wrapped around the base, his hands were so large only the head was exposed above his grip. A small whimper escaped Tony’s lips at the touch, his hips jerked up. Steve made himself comfortable between Tony’s legs, spreading the brunet’s knees and running his left hand along Tony’s inner thigh. Tony shivered at the touch.
Tony stretched out his limbs across the mattress before picking himself up off the bed. He gathered a set of silk pajamas from his closet before heading to the en suite bathroom.

“Welcome back, Sir. Captain Rogers has left you a written message in the bedroom.” JARVIS helpfully shared as Tony stepped across the threshold.
did Tony need for Steve to rip off Tony’s shirt and bite his neck, his shoulders, to play with his nipples and pull his hair. Tony palmed himself through his jeans. He was still standing in the middle of his workshop.
Steve raked his fingernails down Tony’s asscheeks, making them sting perfectly. Tony squirmed under the touch, and Steve gave another slap to Tony’s right cheek. He squeezed the warming flesh with both hands and spread the cheeks, exposing Tony’s hole.
The meeting was brief for something that had been dodged for months; Tony had figured they would demand much more face time but he was grateful to end his day as soon as he could. He returned to his penthouse, already loosening his tie before the elevator doors opened.
to answer.  Steve seemed to have the patience of a saint and it should have been embarrassing as hell to have to be babied by his prostitute, but damn Tony felt good. He felt safer than he had in a long time. He swallowed.
Tony asking permission for anything was causing Steve’s heart to mysteriously flutter, stomach warming and flipping with arousal. “Yes. Good job asking for permission. Hold my hips to keep steady. Don’t wander.”
The fingers in his hair resumed petting him and Steve smiled. “You’re such a good boy, I can hardly imagine having to spank you,”
“So, if I need to get laid, I don’t necessarily need a date. That’s the trouble, you know… Hard to find someone if I’m not supposed to exist.”
Tony scrambled around the room to get dressed. He started shouting again as soon as he had boxers on. “Seriously, how could you actually— how long did you know I was Iron Man?”
“I should’ve had you strip first, would’ve been a sight.” Steve’s voice was low, and Tony’s blush grew. Steve opened the bedroom door for Tony when they halted in front of it. “Undress and kneel by the bed.”
“Just wait for him to come to you,” Natasha said, rising from her seat and tapping Clint’s shoulder. Clint looked up from his food and piled up a few take out containers and his plate and followed Natasha.
Tony opened the bedroom door and stepped in before Steve, turning to see him in. Steve followed Tony into the bedroom, and as they stepped close to the bed, the lights above turned on. Steve was surprised by the automation but Tony seemed to not notice. Steve watched as Tony stepped past him and began to remove his watch and place it on the nightstand along with his cellular phone. When Tony turned to look at him, Steve had a sense that he was not the only one in the room at a loss for what to do next.
The head of Steve’s cock was insistent on Tony’s tongue, a firm heat that he sucked on greedily, for just a moment, before Steve’s fingers tugged on his hair.
Activities in the bedroom would depend on the company and Tony’s requests that evening. Sometimes he felt like bondage, or pegging, or whatever Tony’s guest picks out of his drawer of toys.
Tony could have purred when he felt Steve’s warmth curl around him, and the lights faded in the bedroom.
Tony looked up at him with such wide, wanting eyes. “Good boy.” Steve whispered, and relished the little moan Tony let out.
“So is this punctuality anything to do with your scheduled blackout last night?” Pepper asked, unprompted and correct as always.
Tony whined against Steve’s lips, arms shaking, his fingers desperately working Steve’s pecs and nipples. Tony squirmed, away from or up into the touch, he couldn’t tell. Steve could tell. He pushed his palm down, using the tips of his fingers to rub Tony’s perineum, skin there still slick from the inspection scene in the shower. Tony’s breathy gasps pleased Steve, stoked an ember burning in his gut.
“You want my come, sweetheart?” Steve planted a wet kiss on Tony’s neck. Tony nodded, gagging momentarily as the tips of Steve’s fingers tapped the back of his throat. “Pity I didn’t take your gorgeous mouth tonight, you’re so needy.” Tony moaned, and Steve gave his fingers a few thrusts in time with his hips. “Well, the night is still young. I can get in another round or two—fuck, you’re so tight.” Tony’s hole clenched at the suggestion of another round and Steve’s hips quivered. He came hard, spilling hot inside of Tony.
“Oh god, don’t tell me a guy with your ass is straight.” Tony joked, and the thought of Tony checking out Steve’s ass made him blush furiously, but Steve powered through Tony’s charm.
Steve made quick work of tying Tony’s ankles to his thighs, wrapping wide bands of rope for easy handling. Tony’s mind was fuzzy, but it registered once Steve
The rest of the team were easier to get along with. Hawkeye, Clint, worked hard in the field and seamlessly with Natasha. Without his hearing aids, Steve struggled to communicate with Clint a bit around the tower, but they were on a good enough basis. Steve adapted to texting technology quickly, but he did need to ask Natasha about the emojis Clint sent frequently.
“I know, Tony, I know, come for me. You look so fucking gorgeous, I wanna see what you look like when you’re coming.” Steve’s words were kindle to the fire of Tony’s arousal, sending shivers down his spine and waves of need to his cock.
and Fury is going to—” Steve rolled his eyes and stepped towards Tony’s metal case. Tony tensed. Steve raised his gloved hands to placate him. “What-?”
“Strawberry.” Tony said, mouth left softly open, breathing deeply as he watched Upside Down Steve apply strawberry flavoured lube to his large cock.
When he blinked away the small tears brimming his eyes, Steve was staring down at him with his mouth lax, cheeks red, hair damp around his face. Another hard push, eyes never leaving Tony’s.
Tony’s mouth opened slightly at the touch of Steve’s thumb on his lower lip and Steve felt heat shoot through him at the trust and vulnerability Tony had shown him on these nights they spent together. Before he could act on his urge to slide his thumb onto Tony’s tongue, JARVIS spoke up.
It was not as if he had never hired an escort before. Tony had realized years ago that dating would be incredibly difficult with his lifestyle. He’d never hired a man before, though. He was happy to specify his preferences on the website (height, musculature, hair colour, etc.) but his anxiety was growing as the minutes ticked by, approaching the agreed time of 9:00pm.
“Fuck,” Steve rolled his hips down against Tony’s, their cocks rubbing together. “What a fucking slut you are, you’ll take it any way you can get it. Let’s see, darling, if you can come while I’m fucking you, choking you, hard and fast, then you can come. Once I’m done, you’ve lost your chance. Understand?”
He peeked through into the room. The queen size bed was neatly made and the room looked tidy and untouched aside from a small picture frame set up on the nightstand. “Captain?” Tony felt strange saying that title outside of his armour, for some reason.
Your physical characteristics we have on file have matched with an appointment request received by the following client.
The elevator doors opened into Captain America’s level and Tony stepped out. The décor was relatively untouched from the original layout arranged when Tony had agreed to accommodate the team in Stark Tower. The walls were bare of any personalization; the only evidence that someone had used the space was a pair of dirty boots by the elevator and an easel set up by the center the plate glass windows on the Eastern wall. Tony made out a partially painted rendition of a sunrise on the large canvas perched on the wooden easel.
He looked down at Tony who was staring avidly at his own feet. Steve reached with his right hand to tilt Tony’s face up towards his. Those brown eyes were shining and wet, tearing Steve’s heart in two. “Tony, you deserve everything you want-- you could never want too much.” He surprised himself with how much he meant his words. Surprised himself with the affection he felt for the man in his arms. In that moment, the adrenaline of the scene gone, the both of them standing together barefoot in the quiet bathroom, Steve allowed himself to listen to Tony’s body. His heart was pounding, but gradually slowing to a sustainable pulse.
Webs of colour clouded Tony’s vision as he returned to alertness. Steve was still pumping in and out of him, and Tony hummed in satisfaction. Steve smiled down at him, pleased that Tony’s eyes were open again. “You made a mess of yourself, sweetheart. Didn’t think you’d come from just that. You look gorgeous, sticky and spent.” Tony groaned, looking down at his chest. Stripes of white along his stomach. His head felt hazy and pleasant. “You love being used like this, huh? Your cock making a good effort to go again, to come on my cock.”
Thanks for reading! Even though I'm absolutely terrible at responding to comments, kudos and comments are my lifeblood.
Steve dove down to meet Tony’s mouth, hands pushing Tony’s knees open and up towards Tony’s shoulders. Tony moaned, feeling stretched and exposed and vulnerable under this powerful man, helpless but to take what he is given. Steve sucked and nipped at his bottom lip languidly while his hands pressed at Tony’s skin roughly, sliding warm palms up his inner thighs, his groin. All of a sudden, his balls were taken by one large, warm hand, pressed and rolled and
he had to fight to find words. This was good. This was very good. His head was floating but his body was held in Steve’s strong hands. But Steve demanded words. Tony groaned and he worked to find them.
Tony hadn’t fallen asleep so fast in months. When he awoke, JARVIS informed him it was 10:31am. Tony had one arm splayed out onto the mattress behind him.
I'm still considering writing the Second Appointment from Steve's POV just as a side-fic, but it's not high priority right now.
“You look so beautiful, marked up and filthy like that.” Steve’s voice was a whisper suddenly by Tony’s ear. Tony breathed shakily as Steve pressed kisses to his neck.
. Tony was watching as a glistening bead of precome collected on the tip of Steve’s cock. “…t, or you’ll get a tug. Understand? Tony, did you hear me?”
of that shit—we can just do whatever you want. I think my finger slipped like a dozen times, or I fell asleep on my phone. Y’know how it is, I don’t usually sleep longer than 3 hours a night, I was totally disoriented that morning. Who knows—? Whatever, we can even just do what we did last time? Tour of my collection and everything! It’s different food, though, so maybe we can just skip that part and head straight to showing you my—”
Steve then recalled the phrase that Natasha pointed out in their text conversation earlier. He opened his web browser and input “in the closet” to the search bar.
Steve didn’t know quite how to respond to that truthfully, so he relied on deflection. “Well, according to your profile you chose
Steve shrunk into himself, eyes cast down to Tony’s vacant pillow. He listened to Tony angrily shuffling around the suite to get ready, desperately trying to remember what he planned on saying to convince Tony to not completely write him off as a scumbag who manipulated his team mate (his subordinate officer, if they were to be formal about this) into having relations with him. Steve’s heart hammered in his chest as he thought of what Tony must think of him. He had never meant for them to get so entangled, and had never anticipated feeling so strongly for this man. He could blame Natasha for encouraging him, but none of this was because of her. Steve pushed this too far and he knew it.
, or his safeword. Steve was tied up in a fanciful rope harness across his chest, wrapping up his forearms behind his back. The rope was soft, and brightly coloured. Steve felt… delicate. Secure. He knew that he could shrug out of the rope at an instant, tearing it like tissue paper, but he would not.
Why hadn’t Cap said anything? He was such a mother hen, he would definitely have demanded Tony go to medical thinking that such immediate bruising was the result of the
Steve lifted Tony’s hips to tug his pants and boxers down and off. Tony’s cock stood up, hard and red, dark. Steve wrapped his fingers around the base and Tony’s hips jerked up slightly. A small whimper passed Tony’s lips as Steve made himself comfortable between his knees, spreading Tony’s legs and running his free hand along Tony’s inner thigh.
The women Tony usually hired from this service were often his height, brunettes, dainty and dressed in delicate evening gowns with sheer stockings and garter belts that drove him crazy. He enjoyed romancing them for the evening (‘the girlfriend treatment’, they would tease) and taking them to his bed.
Tony plucked and rubbed at his nipples, staring up at Steve’s face, his body looming over him, between his thighs, splayed wide. Steve’s rumbling moan encouraged him, gave him the courage to push up with his shoulders that extra inch to silently ask for a kiss, his wordless whimpers notwithstanding.
Tony shrugged. “Cuddling?” He worked hard to develop this leveled tone for when he asked to cuddle with his escorts.
He had every intention of telling Tony this would be their last appointment together. That had been the plan. He didn’t feel… right. It wasn’t right to keep going like this when he knew the truth and Tony did not. He risked a glance back towards the bed. Tony had his eyes closed, breathing softly and calmly. Steve felt a rush of pride for having helped Tony to that state. Except... it had been Captain America, in Tony’s eyes. Tony wanted Captain America. He tried his best to remember roleplay was just that— it was play. A game. Steve shouldn’t be taking it to heart, and yet it aches in his chest.
Iron Man, name still unknown, was a match with Steve’s stubborn energy, but he made good and quick decisions when needed— despite how reckless those decisions may be. Steve still had yet to meet Iron Man outside of his metal armour; however, he had been told by SHIELD agents that his identity was kept secret for security reasons as he was also privately employed by Stark Industries to protect Tony Stark himself. After Stark was kept hostage in Afghanistan, Iron Man had been put on payroll to prevent further attempts on Stark’s life. The Avengers Initiative took on Iron Man when it became evident that he was a valuable addition to the team. However, Steve was slightly uncomfortable having a team member who he had never seen out of combat gear. “He probably has a family that he actually goes
Steve couldn’t refrain from rolling his eyes but did not respond to him. “What had the truck been transporting?”
Tony smiled softly and brought one hand down to test the water. It was deliciously warm, and bubbles were slowly forming by the faucet.
whimper when Steve pulled out and coaxed Tony’s knees down. He climbed over Tony’s body to straddle Tony’s chest.
Tony’s fist sped up over his erection, gasping and sputtering nonsense syllables when Steve’s fingers pressed at his prostate. Tony’s eyes gazed up Steve’s bare chest, slim waist and beautiful broad shoulders, and found Steve grinning down at him. Before Tony could demand to know what was so funny, Steve spoke.
The company of a person who gave their full attention, focus, and body, to him. Steve could admit to himself that he got a rush, a thrill, from having that with Stark that one night. He had dominated other men since their appointment, but, he had not replicated that connection he had felt with Tony’s body under his hands, under his direction and control.
Steve pressed his open hands against his red cheeks, shaking his head to himself. He shouldn’t be thinking these things. Tony was… Tony was special to him.
Tony felt the urge to look away. Steve’s gaze was too deep. Too strong. But he was held by it. He pulled again.
Three fingers were pushing into Tony, fucking him rough and good, before Steve withdrew and tugged on Tony’s hair, dragging the man backward against his chest. The length of his dick was pressed firmly between Tony’s plump ass cheeks. “Ready to beg?” Steve whispered, nipping on the shell of Tony’s ear before tugging him out of the shower stall, getting a soft yelp.
Tony shot off on a tangent, then. “Excuse me, don’t think that just because I’m shorter than you automatically makes me the little spoon here. I could challenge stereotypes! Overcome the ideas of what a subby dude is ‘supposed’ to want or like, and—fuck, yeah I’m a little spoon.” Tony turned over on his side, back facing Steve. Tony looked over his shoulder at Steve, expectantly.
Tony reached out to touch Steve’s shoulder. He had intended it to be a brief tap, but his fingers lingered on the soft smooth skin. He tried to find words that would get Steve to climb into the tub, but nothing came up that would be smooth.
He opened his eyes to look at his phone again. He still had his V.P. Escorts profile open, ready to request an evening with Steve, or, 72091. Tony absently wondered if Steve did freelance outside of the service. Certainly, a specimen like Steve would not have a hard time raking in some high-paying clients without the fees from the escort service cutting into his earnings.
Silence. Steve pulled the sheets up over his lap, unsure if it would be acceptable for him to be hard again so quickly.
They walk towards Tony’s den where Tony has his bar stocked and ready for company. Steve shakes his head. “Do you mind if I opt for a beer?” Tony releases Steve and gestures to a bar stool as Tony walks behind the slim counter to duck into the mini fridge.
Steve laid Tony forward again, fingers slipping from Tony’s mouth, thrusting his hips slowly as he rode out his orgasm. He pressed himself down against Tony’s body, their sweat mingling, breath coming in pants. Tony’s heart was pounding in his ears and he never wanted Steve’s warm weight to leave his back. Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s shoulder blade, staying in place.
Steve was very intent on being able to seamlessly engage in conversation with people. He did not want to be caught clueless about something that was common knowledge to everyone else in the room with him. He researched popular books, famous figures, movies, music, and one night he found himself researching major laws that had been passed while he was—while he was asleep.
Tony shrugged. “Cuddling?” Tony’s eyes shot up to briefly meet Steve’s gaze before looking at Steve’s hands.
“Fuck,” Tony’s voice was raspy. Steve released the bite, grinning at the mark left behind. “S’good.”
Tony came between their chests, hot white coating Steve’s fingers. When Steve’s fingertips pressed against Tony’s lips, Tony’s mouth opened without thought. He sucked his own spend off Steve’s thick fingers, gasping when Steve’s teeth closed over the flesh at the joint of his neck and shoulder. Then, Steve’s thrust paused for just a moment, and Tony relished the thought of being filled with Steve’s semen.
“Please, Sir.” Steve had whispered, his voice made soft with desperation. He was not sure what he had wanted.
Tony felt heat collecting inside his gut, his cock throbbing in his hand as his head swam in thoughts of Steve. His hands, his chest, his dominating energy that brought Tony to his knees and made him only want to please Steve.
“Nuh-uh, I don’t think so.” Steve found himself growling. He brought Tony’s left hand to hold the back of his thigh. He continued fucking into Tony’s mouth. “‘s that why you didn’t want rope just yet?” Steve’s mind was running wild. Tony moaned around Steve’s dick, which was still thrusting roughly, tapping at the back of Tony’s throat and breaking the moan up dissonantly and beautifully. “Sneaky boy you are.” Steve took Tony’s right hand to his thigh too.
“Alright, I’ll let you enjoy Cap’s offerings in peace. He’d bite my head off if he knew I ate some. I’m off to bed.” Clint said, grinning and hopping off his seat and heading towards the elevator.
Tony, who Steve had come to have a soft spot for. An inexplicable urge to hold and care for. He actually
, Tony thought. “But I would love to get your ass pink and warmed up for me to eat you out, all flustered and sensitive.” Tony’s eyes closed, nodding, leaning into Steve’s hand in his hair. “Bet you’d be begging so fast, not sure if you want it to stop or if you want more.”
“You are going to go into your bedroom, undress, and kneel at the foot of the bed.” Steve paused, thinking hard on how to phrase the next part; the agency’s study materials had not exactly covered roleplay as your actual secret job with your unknowing colleague. “The captain is going to come to inspect you. You will address me as ‘Captain’ or ‘Sir’ and I will call you whatever I like.”
service? No.” Natasha looked appalled, “No, just no. I know a guy. You’re way too gorgeous for the basic package. I’ll get you a spot with a luxury service.”
Steve nodded. He did, indeed. Steve had researched every item on Tony’s request list. He had been eager to learn, to be able to step into this role asked of him and be able to appreciate something other than a successful SHIELD mission, as Natasha insisted that he needed to do. She may not have exactly envisioned
Steve licked his lips and gave his cock a few more strokes before coming with a guttural moan. Warm spurts struck Tony’s open mouth, his cheeks, his forehead. He closed his eyes to enjoy the sensation and float in the haze.
Steve shed his clothing, folded them neatly, and placed them on the bedroom floor, along with his shoes. He gently arranged Tony on the bed with his head hanging off the edge. The tent in Tony’s suit pants made Steve proud, pleased. He made that happen. And Tony seemed to be happy to be trapped in his clothes, which satisfied Steve’s newly discovered enjoyment of seeing Tony like this.
“Fuck,” Steve’s voice was low and surprised. He started a steady rhythm, hard and fast, just as he had promised Tony. “You’re too much.” Before Tony could think too hard, he probably couldn’t with his collar strung tight by his own hand, Steve dove forward to plant a kiss to his forehead, his cheek, his jaw, his neck. “So good.”
Steve dropped the working end of his ropes and brought one hand to cup himself. He closed his eyes and recalled how delicate Tony’s breathing was, how hard and red his cock was, how his eyes were dazed and wet when Steve came inside him for a third time. He inhaled deeply and squeezed himself firmly through his jeans. He hummed and slid his free hand down his left thigh and dipped his fingertips under the rope wrapped around it.
“I thought you’d never ask, Tony.” Steve worked to keep his voice level. He had been enjoying the dream-like state he had been floating on. This had felt like a
Tony shuddered, skin crawling at how he had allowed Steve (Cap!) to touch him. He felt utterly exposed, more than he did when he was buck naked in front of Steve last night.
Tony gave an offended look to Steve when he removed Tony’s hands from his thighs and pulled out of Tony’s mouth. He pulled Tony’s shoulders up and nudged him to the center of the bed, setting his head on one of the lush pillows.
“Ugh… Alright, J, show me.” Tony grumbled, grabbing a towel from the pile of clothing and rags that had been collecting for days.
The next morning came too soon. Steve awoke around 6:15 and considered his options as he looked over Tony’s sleeping features. He looked so peaceful, brow smoothed free of stress and mouth slack and relaxed. Steve was so tempted to softly caress Tony’s bottom lip with his thumb. Steve could slip out of the penthouse right now, and avoid a third attempt at the most awkward conversation he might ever have to have. On the other hand, he could stay and hope Tony could forgive him. He could forgive him and maybe even give him a chance.
“I thought Clint was here.” Tony's voice was rough but coherent, allowing Steve to worry just a bit less about Tony’s state.
He must have dozed off, because he opened his eyes to see Steve climbing onto the mattress. He still shone a little from the shower, but he didn’t drip. His hair appeared towel-dried and tousled in a way that Tony wanted to have done himself. Tony’s eyes travelled down the stretch of Steve’s neck, across his bare broad shoulders. He was tempted to bite down onto Steve’s neck once he got within range. Steve’s chest and abs were absolutely delicious, and as Tony found his way down to Steve’s flaccid cock, his mouth practically watered.
The time until Steve responded felt eternal. At least, to Tony it felt that way. As soon as the words left his mouth, he regretted it. How desperate Tony must look to this man. His escort, Tony reminded himself. Escort. Not boyfriend.
“Well, I… I don’t know, if I had it my way, we’d be eating burgers and fries, but I figure it would be more suave to arrange for a curated arrangement of wine and cheese. But I know you prefer beer, so I have that too, if you want. Don’t feel pressured to eat, though, you don’t need to if you don’t want to, I mean—”
Steve started stroking Tony’s dick steadily, slowly. Tony left out a huff of breath, eyes closed, hips jerking up. Steve used his left hand to find the bottle of lube once again and slick up his fingers. “I—” Tony cut himself off when Steve’s finger found Tony’s hole. “N—f-fuck.”
Tony keened downward, melting against Steve’s warm body. He was growing hard and he could feel Steve’s cock hardening against his thigh. The hand on Tony’s ass pulled him down, grinding their bodies together.
Tony’s hole was glistening, and Steve gently lowered the tip of his middle finger to it. Tony’s breath hitched but his hips pushed back towards the finger. Steve grinned and let the single finger gently press inside, but only to the first knuckle. Saliva could only go so far.
Tony’s grip was firm and steady, a good handshake. In that moment, Steve recalled Howard Stark’s handshake, and Tony did resemble his father so very much. He blinked away the thought.
, I mean, he is not what I expected him to be. He’s…” Steve trailed off, wringing his hands, avoiding Natasha’s gaze.
It was weeks until Tony received an update from the escort service. He was not too torn up about it, though, because he had been flooded with work to do. A couple of calls to assemble, some repairs and upgrades to tinker with on the suit. Tony also had a feeling he could design a sturdier arrow for Clint that can pierce through thicker armour but not weigh him down too much.
’s throat twitched around his cock and his fingers tightened in the blond hair. A thick presence in his ass was suddenly brought to his attention as Steve crooked his fingers (had to be three, at least three…) and then pressed tenderly against his prostate. A moan broke out, loud and wordless, into the bedroom and it took Tony a moment to realize it was his own voice.
Tony’s face went red and moved to turn into his shoulder, a growl and Steve’s other hand corrected him, cupping his chin and forcing him to look up at Steve.
Steve started to bob his head enthusiastically, now that he knew Tony was awake, Tony supposed. Tony gasped quietly as Steve took him down deep, the head of his cock nestled roughly in Steve’s throat, his nose pressed against Tony’s pelvis. Tony brought both hands up to cover his face, his cheeks were hot. Steve’s free hand came up and pinched Tony’s nipple cruelly and Tony let out a loud yelp, before Steve pulled back for air. Tony peered at him through his fingers. Steve sat on his heels, looking at Tony with a challenging expression. His cheeks were pink, his lips looked swollen and red. Maybe Tony had been sleeping through this for longer than he’d thought…
Tony felt a fresh rush of heat in his cheeks again and he opened his eyes wide again, watching Steve’s expression. The blonde’s gaze was steady, eyes warm like his voice, lips soft, grip on Tony’s wrists hard as he wriggled them to test Steve. He sighed happily as he was still trapped by the man’s large hand.
“You’d think a billionaire like you would have qualms about cold pizza.” Clint signed, chewing his chicken happily.
Steve’s cock pulsed as he came down Tony’s throat. Tony held his breath and swallowed earnestly, long after Steve was spent.
Fury seemed to be out of patience, and Hill spoke up. “A wanted criminal in the hold, the evidence of his latest crimes in the front cab with the driver.”
Tony came with a shout and his arms were shaking before they fell from their position above his head, from holding the headboard. They felt like jelly and he relished the aftershocks of his orgasm.
Steve hummed, enjoying Tony’s obvious enjoyment, and rolled the two of them over. He grabbed both of Tony’s wrists in one hand, pressing them against the mattress above Tony’s head. He rolled his hips down against Tony’s again, keen on hearing Tony curse and beg.
Steve hummed with approval. “I’d love to see you crawl.” Tony let out a whimper. “Take another bite.”
When Tony’s back was to Steve, he took the opportunity to run his fingers down the dip of his spine. Tony subtly shivered and moaned breathily. With a grin, Steve let his hand travel lower, giving Tony’s ass a firm squeeze. “Have you showered?”
“Hands over your head, sweetheart. Hold the headboard.” Steve’s heart fluttered when Tony obeyed, eyes watching Steve carefully as he gripped the top bar of the wooden headboard behind him. “Good boy.”
When Steve pulled out, Tony looked down and felt a strange disappointment when he saw the condom on Steve’s dick.
Steve’s second client was quite a different experience from what Tony had been. The man requested that Steve spank him and have him call Steve “Daddy” while Steve fucked him (which… surprisingly, Steve found himself quite amenable to…). Steve was becoming more familiar with the limits to put on his strength in the bedroom. He enjoyed the use of safeword check-ins, particularly during the spanking, as he was not sure how softly to begin with, considering his enhanced strength.
Dirty thoughts about Capsicle? Now that was just a new low. Embarrassing. Tony was not desperate enough to lust after
Tony was confused again. Why would Steve ask for a check-in? They were done with their scene. He just wanted—He wanted something. And he didn’t know what.
At Steve’s panicked expression, Natasha gave in and patted his shoulder. “Not since before the Avengers came into existence,” she said. Steve let out a relieved breath and nodded tightly. “He’s not one to change his ways for just anyone, Steve. He’ll get over this, I know it.”
Relief came over Steve and he took a calming breath. He reached across the counter and placed his hand on Tony’s elbow, then quickly decided against the touch, and placed his palm down on the counter instead. He smiled at Tony warmly to make up for the indecision. “Tell me what you’d like to talk about.”
Tony set down the glass and looked at Steve. Their gaze held strong, neither of them speaking for a moment. Steve’s neck prickled, fearing that this would be the moment that Tony recognized him.
He unwrapped his bonds, gently smoothing his palms over Tony’s muscles, feeling for temperature and getting massaging. “Sit up for me,” he whispered, guiding Tony up and off the bed, and to the bathroom for them to clean up.
Tony’s mind was hazy, at once a blur of a thousand buzzing ideas and yet overwhelmed with warmth, pleasure, and need, and all by Steve’s hands. He whimpered around the fingers in his mouth, sucking and licking. “So fucking desperate, what a good slut, you need to be filled up in both your holes. One isn’t good enough, is it?” Tony could only whimper, a sobbing moan, as Steve whispered filth into his ear.
Peeking out of one eye, Steve looked up at Tony, who was dressed in silk matching pajamas. “Nice PJs.”
“You jealous? Maybe next time I’ll lend you some, but since I paid for the overnight, I’ll get my money’s worth of your ridiculous body.” Tony meant to be playful, but it sounded more crude than anything. He would have never said that if it were a woman laying on his bed.
Then his left hand was being plucked from the bedsheets and felt a leather strap being pressed into his palm. “You control your breathing, sweetheart. And keep yourself in check, no touching your cock.”
He was not seeing anyone. Not anymore. Well, not ever. He and Steve weren’t anything. Tony somehow found a way to derail the one thing that was keeping him grounded. Two things, he supposed, as he rubbed one thumb against his thigh where the slightest bruise was blooming.
Fear not! Subscribe to the series for more of this AU. More is coming, I just have a lot on my plate and I’m just writing slower than I’d prefer to be!
“You’d look pretty on my cock, I know that,” Steve mused, watching Tony’s red cheeks hollow as he sucked on Steve’s fingers. “Now I have two tight wet holes to choose from.”
When Steve had been given his assignment to lead the Avengers, he was determined to serve as Captain America, to fight for what was right. He had a goal. His team was an eclectic group: Banner, Barton, Romanov, and the elusive Iron Man, whose identity was secret even to him. The fact that it frustrated him that Iron Man would not reveal his identity, even privately to Steve, was something Steve was not sure how to confront.
Steve had returned to the Avengers tower feeling at peace that night. And the next morning, Steve had finally done what he had been procrastinating on for weeks. He responded to the repeat request from Tony Stark.
Tony gave a small affirmative huff and Steve popped the plastic container into the microwave. With the buzzing of the appliance running as ambience, Steve stepped over to Tony slumped over the table and quietly placed his hand on Tony’s shoulder. He made no movement, so Steve kept his hand there.
Steve dropped the towel and gripped Tony’s face in his hands, tilting his head back. Tony’s eyelashes were wet, eyes blown. He was beautiful like this.
that he sensed in the AI’s voice. He stepped into the elevator and took a deep breath as the doors closed. Steve thought to wear his jacket to make it seem like he had actually
“Good boy. You’re taking me really well, sweetheart. I think you missed one, but you ready for my third load?” Tony’s mind was reeling. This 20-something sexy bastard could go three times, and he was rubbing it in his face. Tony shivered.
Tony’s eyes cast forward to Steve’s cock, a scant inch or so from his mouth, and licked his lips. His gaze traveled up Steve’s defined abs, his firm pecs, his pink nipples, his beautiful broad shoulders. “Please—
Steve was looking at his chest. Before Tony could sputter any excuses or jokes, Steve spoke with a stern expression. “How’s your breathing, Tony? I wouldn’t have blocked your airways so much last time if I’d known you had—”
The shower was hot and soothing on Tony’s limbs, his arms pleasantly ached. He breathed deeply as he tapped on the arc reactor. He stepped out of the spray and dried himself off with a lush towel. With a fresh folded towel, he emerged from the bathroom dressed for sleep, but he was feeling restless.
“Y’gonna fuck me, or what?” Tony bit his bottom lip once the words were out, watching for Steve’s reaction.
“As per your instruction, Sir, SHIELD classified identity information has been restricted from verbal access.” JARVIS replied, and Tony was certainly not drunk enough to just be imagining the smug sound of his voice.
“Your first time?” Steve asked, kissing Tony again softly when Tony climbed over him slowly, planting an elbow by Steve’s shoulder for support.
Tony’s eyes shot open and he looked over his shoulder at Steve. His cheeks and chest were pink, red, his hair mussed, his eyes trained on Tony’s. He gave Tony’s hips a firm squeeze, gaze unmoving.
Steve blushed. He was about to huff about the unrealistic expectations about ‘Captain America attitude’ that had built up around his code name, when his phone pinged.
Tony remembered his hand still on his cock and gave it a gentle stroke. He brought his free hand up to touch his neck, where the bruises from his collar were left.
At that, Tony hesitated-- mouth hung open, voiceless. Steve leaned in to press his lips to Tony’s ear, “I’d advise you not to lie to me.” This close to Tony, Steve could hear the smallest moan escape the man. “Time to hit the showers, Stark.”
Tony rubbed his eyes with the heels of his palms, his cheeks were hot, and he did not want to see that he was so pathetically hard again. But now that Steve had mentioned it, it was all Tony could think about.
When he woke, in SHIELD’s care, as they put it, he poured his focus into preparing himself for the world. He was given cultural briefings in the form of thick bundles of papers he was meant to read and suddenly understand the world he woke up in. SHIELD provided him with a headshrinker, but the man felt too eager to be speaking to him and it made Steve wary that he would be the type to be seconds from pulling out collectible Captain America merchandise for him to autograph. Steve read, fiction and non-fiction, on an electronic tablet SHIELD provided him with, to immerse him in the technology of the time he had been thrust into. After the screen of the first tablet they provided was cracked when Steve swiped away aggressively from a tasteless “news” article, it was replaced with a tablet that was fortified by a metal casing and came with a rubber-tipped stylus for use on the screen rather than his fingers.
“Or do you want it slow? Soft, sweet? Want the sap of lovemaking? Staring into each other's eyes as I make you come on my cock?” Steve’s voice waivered when Tony whined, arching his back and rolling his hips up for friction against Steve. “Impatient, sweetheart? Shh... I’ll take care of you, don’t you worry.”
Steve smiled and pressed just a small fraction of his strength around his grip and Tony moaned. Steve hummed in approval. “Yeah, you’re such a slut for that, aren’t you? Just begging for me to choke you out, hm? Tell me, Tony, use your words now.”
Tony nodded silently, his range of motion hampered by Steve’s grip at the crown of his head. “Answer me properly,” Steve demanded, knowing that Tony was probably losing his words. And Tony loved being prodded into speaking when he was slowly slipping into subspace, a little blush grew every time Steve would demand that he spoke. The loquacious man felt such a rush of sensual humiliation when words came to him so slowly under Steve’s hand.
Black Widow smirked before heading Eastward with Hawkeye in tow. They quickly disappeared into the trees.
Steve threaded Tony’s leash over the top of the bed’s headboard and in through one of the centre vertical slats. With an experimental tug, Tony’s collar was pulled taut against his windpipe for just a second, and Tony gasped with surprise, and then let out a deep moan. His pupils were blown, staring up at Steve like he was a god.
Captain America’s cowl was still sitting on Tony’s coffee table. Tony should go down to return it to Cap and maybe try to convince him not to tell Fury that Tony’s cover has been blown. Tony would do anything to keep himself in the Avengers.
Pepper is present in person for the first time in this whole series in this chapter! I'm already working on a bit of a prequel that further explores Tony and Pepper's relationship history, I'll post it as it's own fic but included in the series, as it will build on this world.
Tony could not believe that he had gotten so clingy that morning he sent in that request for Steve again. How could anyone manage to read such a dense and obviously desperate list of Tony’s kinks? God, this was humiliating and not even in the fun way.
Motion at Tony’s sides made Steve look down. Tony’s hands were clenching on-and-off by his hips, fidgeting with his shirt. Tony needed something to hold again.
came down against Tony’s cheek. He sucked in a soft gasp and closed his eyes as Steve’s palm returned to his pink cheek gently.
His hand slid from Tony’s chin just enough down to get a solid, even grip on the front of Tony’s throat. He could feel Tony’s pulse at his fingertips, his gulp as he swallowed saliva. He gently used his hold on Tony to lean him against the couch back. Steve wanted him relaxed.
Tony wondered if Steve was going to pounce on orgasm denial now that he had it on the request form. Steve seemed to like it last time, he brought it up himself. Tony was torn between saving his load for tomorrow night’s possible fantastic agony or jerking off now so he wouldn’t be quite so desperate, pathetic, needy for Steve’s permission.
Steve slid his hand from holding Tony’s palm, hooked their thumbs and pulled him down by his wrist. Tony’s lips met Steve’s in a breathy rush, Tony’s teeth catching Steve’s bottom lip and dragging back as they opened their eyes. “Very good.” Tony whispered, pushing with the wrist that Steve was still holding to drop Steve gently onto his back.
“Shh… you’re doing so well.” Steve had smiled and closed his eyes, enjoying the gentle touches and kind words. They washed over him like a warm summer rain.
Tony’s mouth fell open wide, his eyes closing once he saw Steve’s intention. Steve carefully lined up the head of his cock between Tony’s lips, and he tried to hold back a moan when he felt Tony’s tongue swipe out to lick across the slit, his hot breath rolling across his erection. Once Tony’s mouth settled open, ready, Steve’s fingers curled into Tony’s hair gently and pushed in slowly.
When Tony Stark had invited the Avengers to reside in Stark Tower, Steve had half-expected to see Iron Man out of his suit at
and he was pulled roughly backwards against the sheets and then rolled to face Steve again. His balance was teetering with his legs bound, he found himself extending his foot to balance himself precariously on the tips of his toes against the bed.
“Sounds like your day is starting off hectic,” Steve whispered into Tony’s hair, pressing an indulgent kiss to the crown of his head.
Natasha cocked one eyebrow and reached out her hand for Steve’s phone. She grinned, saying nothing, as she read the email. Steve watched Natasha’s face carefully, waiting for her to speak.
The microwave beeped and startled them both. Tony sat up as Steve brought over the plated food to him with a spoon and a glass of water. Tony wordlessly picked up the spoon and tentatively started in on the meal. Steve sat by him quietly.
Steve tugged the leash, pulling Tony back up on his hands and forcing his back to arch. “Shoulders back, strong and proud. What a good boy.” Tony let out a shaking moan, cheeks warm and vision blurry. He whined as he felt a second finger slide between his cheeks. The fingers together pushed roughly at his hole, still wet with Steve’s spit, rubbing and teasing but not pushing in further.
Tony stared at the two bottles for a long moment. Steve did not say anything as Tony’s gaze wandered from the bottles to Steve’s naked body. He wondered if Tony was looking at his lack of body hair. Natasha had insisted it was all the rage to be clean-shaven.
The team were taken by helicopter north to the forest where the coordinates of the truck had last been recorded. “Okay, Widow and Hawkeye will go East, Iron Man can head West and patrol from overhead.”
, which established the legal groundwork for the structure of Escort and Sex Work establishments in the country.
Tony wordlessly whined, mouth falling open, wanting to demand that Steve fuck him already. He didn’t care how, he just needed it. It dawned on Tony how long it had actually been since Tony had been fucked. His mouth watered, suddenly felt empty, missing something, as he thought of how to phrase his thoughts for Steve.
Tony sighed. Pepper would have a field day if a civilian knew he was Iron Man. Then there were the Avengers, who, Tony reasoned, would shrug him off like a spoiled rich boy if they knew. Tony was more afraid of Pepper.
Tony wondered how long he had been asleep while Steve was working him open. He wondered if Steve started sucking his cock first or if Steve fingered him first and his cock was just there, so convenient. Steve didn’t even have to do that. Tony’s hands pet through Steve’s hair at the thought.
They stayed that way for a while; Steve was on his elbows and knees over Tony, kissing and sucking and biting at the smooth skin over Tony’s shoulder. When Steve next spoke, his voice was gentle and earnest. His stream of praises flowed through Tony’s ears and his mind quieted. He wanted to just enjoy as the soft sound of Steve’s voice washed over him. Tony 's eyes fell shut as he drifted in and out of awareness, floating on the border of subspace. “You’re so far under, sweetheart.”
Tony pulls the cowl over his head, grumbling about the fit. “Now just head back to the quinjet or the Tower or—”
Tony was hunkered down on his workshop floor, skin covered in oil and sweat, stomach running low on patience and DUM-E standing by threateningly with the emergency water hose to hydrate Tony if JARVIS deemed it necessary. Had Tony only been more caught up on sleep and nourishment, he might have noticed what his creations had been up to, but Tony wasn’t, so Tony didn’t.
He gave Tony’s cock a firm slick stroke before taking his own in hand to line himself up. Tony’s groan was wordless and breathy, watching Steve with wide eyes, pupils blown and hazy. Steve paused and trained his expression away from the grin fighting to show, “Say it.”
“You didn’t specify online, is kissing good?” Steve asked, blinking away his anxiety. Tony nodded quickly. Steve smiled and slid his grip on Tony’s hand to his wrist before pulling him in for a kiss.
“I assumed you wanted me to sleep in here. Did you have a setup in mind, or…?” Steve trailed off, gesturing with open palms.
Tony shook Steve’s hand and smiled, nodding politely at the compliment. “Tony.” With their hands still together, Tony pulled Steve closer to himself and placed his left hand at the small of Steve’s back. “Can I offer you a glass of wine, Steve?”
Steve’s warm hands wrapped thick leather around Tony’s neck, fastening it smoothly before pushing his head back down against the mattress. Tony may have felt embarrassed by the gutted moan he let out had he been more lucid, but at this point he was floating peacefully, contentedly.
him again. He just let out a humoured exhale through his nose and held Tony closer. Because he was a selfish, selfish man. But he was also weighed down by guilt too heavy to carry forward.
“Good morning, Sir. It’s 6:30am, the weather in New York is 54 degrees, expecting light scattered showers. Your first appointment is at 9:00am and you have 4 messages from Ms Potts awaiting you.” Tony was stirring as JARVIS spoke, grumbling and turning in towards Steve’s chest.
Tony was nodding furiously, desperately rolling his hips, spreading his legs for Steve again. The sooner Steve was inside him, the sooner he would have permission to come. Steve positioned himself between Tony’s legs again, the head of his cock brushing against Tony’s sensitized hole. Tony’s eyes closed momentarily, relishing the sensation and anticipating the feeling of fullness that was about to come.
Clint squinted, eyebrows furrowing in mock offence. “I can’t believe you learned how to sign ‘birdbrain,’ I might just refuse to eat with you.” He said.
“Yes, Sir!” Tony yelped as Steve laid a quick slap to Tony’s ass before leading him to the luxurious and especially non-military shower, but it would do perfectly.
hit Tony in his gut. He remembered Steve’s gentle hands when they bathed together. Tony had been floating high on hormones, stomach fluttering with every swipe of the soft cloth as Steve washed with him. It had been so intimate, and it hadn’t even made Tony’s skin crawl. The memory of Steve’s hands touching him in the water – caring and delicate – was in consummate opposition of other memories Tony had of water.
“Alright. Well, you certainly can’t keep your hands to yourself. My helmet is shredded. I’d’ve been fine if you hadn’t interfered with my armour!”
Steve used his right hand to carefully line up the head of his cock between Tony’s lips. He moaned low as he felt Tony’s hot breath. Tony’s tongue reached out to taste test. The strawberry was strong and mouth-watering. Steve slowly pushed into Tony’s mouth, fingers curling gently into the short curls at the back of Tony’s neck.
Steve had bathed him. The man’s hands had been so gentle and delicate, something Tony would not have expected from a man of Steve’s size. He had been so good to Tony. He had dealt with Tony’s crying snit, too. So embarrassing.
Steve sighed and leaned on his elbows on the table, scrubbing his hands over his face. “What should I do in the meantime?”
The conversation was cut short by a cracking sound to their left and Steve’s breath was knocked out of his chest as Iron Man plucked him from his stance and down to the ground with a crash. Steve’s ears were ringing and in what seemed like a blink, the trees to the immediate south of them were collapsing, their leaves aflame. “Well, shit.” Iron Man’s voice boomed, the metal reverberating against Steve’s back. “We’ve got another incoming.”
Steve cleared his throat and smiled at Tony earnestly, “It’s good to see you again. You know,” Steve paused, spotting the colouration of the skin just above the collar of Tony’s crisp shirt. “Arnica gel could help with those bruises.”
know why Steve chuckled before pushing further. Tony’s throat was full, stretching tightly around the hot intrusion. As Steve settled, Tony punched out a huff through his nose, closing his eyes. Steve’s balls were hairless, Tony noticed when the discomfort of pubes under (above?) his nose never came.
Plain bar soap would predictably not be in sight in a billionaire’s bathroom, so Steve reached for a bottle of body wash. It smelled of lavender and sage as he poured some out in his palm and lathered.
Steve hummed through a moan, rolling them both over. He gathered both Tony’s wrists in one hand, pressing them against the mattress above Tony’s head. He rolled his hips down against Tony’s to hear him groan again.
Before Tony’s thoughts could return to science, his stomach rumbled in a cry of hope to get attention. “That’s a good idea, I guess.” Tony lifted himself to his feet.
Tony emerged from the en suite bathroom, rousing Steve from his stressful train of thought. He was wearing a three-piece suit now, perhaps he discarded his tee-shirt while Steve was distracted. Tony looked absolutely stunning, even as he glared at the bed, avoiding Steve’s eyes.
“And fucking,” Tony huffed and slumped down onto the cool tile floor, folding his legs up in front of his chest. Steve nodded, “yeah.”
“So, what happened?” Natasha asked, seated by a reasonable portion of pilaf from last night’s dinner order. She held her phone in her hand, not looking at Steve.
The excitement of stepping into Tony’s bedroom that night was distinct from every previous appointment. Steve’s stomach fluttered as he entered. The sight of Tony kneeling for him, eyes cast to the lush rug under his knees, was almost too much to bear.
Tony still didn’t give up, of course. He carefully glanced up at her before returning to his papers. “What do you mean?”
At that, Steve gave a shallow thrust before pulling out until just the head of his cock was cradled between Tony’s lips. Tony’s tongue licked across the head quickly, catching the salty taste, before Steve started up a steady rhythm.
Steve would combust if he could, truly. He wanted so desperately to turn Tony in his arms, shake him by the shoulders, or maybe kiss him again. And
“Hello?” Tony called out, surprising himself with his calm-sounding voice. He took careful steps towards the door, listening for a response.
“Do you like being a good boy?” Steve’s question was rhetorical, mostly. Tony looked at peace being held by the hair, eyes closed, chewing obediently between answers. “I bet you’d love being my good boy. You’d kneel and beg for me, waiting to be used by my fingers, filled with my cock. What’s your safeword, sweetheart?”
, the way his insides fluttered thinking of how Steve manhandled him. Tony was so close, his breath coming in airy wisps.
point, but instead the man was as secretive as ever. Steve had even dreamt one night that Iron Man was simply the suit, run remotely from some kind of electrical panel. In the dream, Steve had pulled up the face plate of the Iron Man suit, and there was nothing but wiring and glowing lights, burning brighter as that warm, yet sarcastic and snarky, voice sassed him in the field.
Soon, Steve heard the bathroom door open again and a soft towel being placed beside him on the bed. “Your turn.” Tony said.
Tony groaned weakly. His cock ached and his grip on Steve’s thighs tightened as he fought his urge to stroke himself over his pants.
All Tony wanted to do was be able to just throw on a smile and make an appointment with Steve, the perfect match to his cluster of kinks, his walking wet dream, the dom who had helped him forget about his life for a few hours, the man who Tony had been hoping… But there was no point. No point in dwelling, in hoping.
“Uh-huh…” Natasha was listening, but also watching as a couple of teenagers entered the shop. She looked idly suspicious of their presence. Steve wondered how expensive the shirts were that Natasha was having him carry.
Tony mentally facepalmed himself. He had multiple degrees. He was a successful businessman. He certainly must have had picked up at least one or two social skills in his time on earth. Apparently, they didn’t extend to this situation – horny, deprived, and being straddled and dirty talked to by a blonde god.
“Wait, that’s it?” Steve turned as she rounded the table towards the hall. She smiled over her shoulder and then Steve zeroed in on the motion in his peripheral vision.
Tony stared at that date, only a day away, as he rubbed himself dry. He threw the towel back onto the pile whence it came. “Works for me. Set it up!” Tony called to JARVIS.
He froze for a moment. The two couches surrounding the table, and the table itself, were all bare – not a blanket, a book, or an abandoned sock in sight. This might not have been a good spot to place an important item; if it were Tony, the cowl would go overlooked for weeks if not months.
He could feel Tony’s pulse, his breath. Steve gave the most subtle squeeze. Tony’s hands twitched, fists closing and opening in quick succession before gripping the bedsheets. Tony’s nose was pressing against Steve’s balls and Steve was in disbelief that Tony actually had Steve’s entire cock in his mouth. And that Tony loved it.
Steve looked at Tony, taking a short gasp. Without a word, Steve slid off the chair and stepped towards Tony’s spot on the floor. He knelt and lifted his hand slowly, placing it on Tony’s arm gently. “Pepper’s gonna be real proud of me,” Tony mumbled, bending his neck and pressing his warm forehead against Steve’s fingers.
To his luck, it was past 1am and his only company was Clint who was transfixed in a movie, laid out on one of the couches.
21 anymore. Steve looked too pleased with himself as he pushed his cock in slowly. “Your cock is mine to play with.” Steve’s voice was playful, eyes crinkling with his grin. Tony’s stomach flipped pleasantly, and he tightened his fist around the leash handle. He focused on his breath as Steve’s cock seemed to take up the space in his body that oxygen usually did. Still, he readied his left hand to tug, waiting for Steve’s first proper thrust.
His excitement was barely contained until DUM-E sprayed him briefly with cold water. He yelped and shook, muttering grievances towards his creation as it dropped the hose and hurried off to its charging station and
“Sit, um...” Tony said, and Steve sat gracefully on the edge of the bed, holding his hand up to ask Tony to follow. Tony stared down into Steve’s stupid amazing blue eyes and forgot what he had been meaning to say next.
“And I want to give you everything. I spend my days thinking of how to treat you next time I see you, how you might like it if I do this, or do that…”
Steve had been halfway up to standing, when he swiftly rushed through the open door of his bedroom closet. He pulled the door nearly shut, so as not to reveal his position with the squeak of the knob. He dared peer through the slim part and caught sight of Tony stepping carefully into the bedroom. “Captain?”
Tony gasped and whined, suddenly restless and out of rhythm. He turned his cheek and pressed it against Steve’s chest. “Captain, Sir, please, ah-”
Tony scowled at her without any real fight. “It was good, I think. I was hoping for it to be more than just… I don’t know what I hoped for, really, but it can’t happen so it’s just an absolute mess right now.”
Steve followed the man on slightly wobbly legs, and he was surprised at himself. When they reached the man’s office, Steve was put to his knees by the man’s thigh at his desk chair. Steve half-expected the man to demand that Steve provide him with oral sex, although no sexual activity was requested that night, but Steve would not be opposed. The client’s face was kind and open, though worn from stress and age. Steve felt safe with him.
Everything was buzzing. The hard fullness and force of Steve’s cock like a piston in and out of him. The ache around his neck where he might end up with a striped bruise in the morning. The pulsing need in his balls to come again, but he did not think he had it in him. And then Steve’s fingers on his right nipple, rubbing, pinching, and
After what had felt like only a short while, Steve’s client squeezed his shoulder firmly, but again gently. “Thank you.” Steve blinked away his thoughts, his stillness, and looked up at the man. He smiled. “Let’s untie you. You’ve been so good.”
When Tony’s suit was yet again assembled around Tony’s body, Steve turned, removed his cowl, and tossed it over his shoulder to Tony. “Don’t peek now,” Steve warned.
Steve could not stop his hand from touching Tony’s thigh, sliding up to caress Tony’s ass. Tony gasped and shivered as Steve squeezed his firm cheek, fingernails digging in slightly. “Good, good.” Steve whispered as he squeezed Tony’s wrist, still trapped between their chests.
“What—” Tony began to stammer, eyes shifting and refusing to settle on Steve. He seemed to be struggling within the suit. “Come
, but Steve’s gaze never wavered. With his eyes still trained on Steve, Tony reached down with his right hand for his own cock. With a satisfying flip in his gut, Tony’s hand was thwarted as he’d expected, and his wrist was pinned down to the mattress by Steve’s free hand. Tony grinned devilishly.
Tony whined at the words, rolling his hips down against Steve’s body. Steve could feel Tony’s erection growing and he could not deny his own, swelling steadily pressed against Tony. He squeezed Tony’s ass cheek once again, pulling Tony down and rubbing their clothed erections together.
“Now I want you to keep your hands to yourself, Tony.” Steve began, and Tony was working very hard to focus on Steve’s words when Steve was so very naked, and so very beautiful, and so very
Steve’s gorgeous, strong, warm hands supported Tony’s weight as he was guided off the bed and onto the soft carpet. Tony’s legs were quaking beneath him, but he hoped it wasn’t obvious. He walked by Steve’s side, enjoying his warmth. “Good boy, we’re almost there.”
, Tony thought just as one of Steve’s hands came up to cup one of his pecs. His thumb started rubbing his nipple gently at first, and Tony took a deep breath, focusing. Tried to focus. Could not focus.
Steve’s fingers slowly pumped in and out, getting Tony loose enough to take Steve’s dick again. Tony remembered the burn of the stretch around Steve’s size the night before. It was so fantastic.
Tony took a testing sip of his cocktail before setting it down and leaning forward slightly on his elbows. Steve’s eyes were a strong blue and they did not back down against Tony’s gaze.
The man provided Steve with water and offered a snack, but he only took the water. Steve had not realized how parched he had been, but he would be at the Tower soon after his departure from this man’s home. On the sidewalk outside, he confirmed the completion of this evening’s appointment with the service, and called a cab.
Tony whined wordlessly again. His mouth opened, shut, and he swallowed thickly, looking away and back a few times.
Steve knew Tony had cleaned out before he arrived. Tony was anything but unprepared. Steve would be able to finger Tony open right here, maybe even fuck him in here. As he slicked up his fingers, he imagined what Tony would look like in Steve’s arms, pressed against the tile of the shower stall, body pink from the water, cheeks red from arousal and lips swollen from Steve doing just whatever he wanted to them. Bite, suck, gently kiss…
Tony huffed, rubbing his aching head. He could use a drink or eight. He skulked over to his bar and started fixing himself a martini, heavy-handed on his olive juice because there wasn’t anyone around he was planning on making out with.
Now that Steve had discovered that Tony was even more entangled in Avengers business than he initially thought, he felt obligated to step away. Tony was under his command in the field (however, Iron Man did not tend to respect this chain of command anyway). Nonetheless, it would be inappropriate for a superior to be fraternizing with a subordinate, regardless of how insubordinate the man in question tended to be.
Tony began to suck happily once the first couple of inches were pressed against his tongue. Steve pet Tony’s hair for a moment before giving a gentle tug. Tony let out a whine and let his mouth so slack again. Steve chuckled softly before pushing further into Tony’s mouth. It was so hot, wet, and soft. Steve could not have been able to imagine this. This was incredible.
Steve took a pause, he didn’t know how to answer that. Was this Tony flirting or Tony hiring him privately? He could hear Tony’s heart pounding, he had to mean it. He had to… want Steve. Steve was screwed. “Tony,” he said, “I think I need to straighten something out before we—”
After a moment of bathing in the haze of Steve’s weighted warmth, Tony’s focus was drawn again by his erection, pinned between his stomach and the mattress. He attempted to wriggle, to get some friction and relief, but Steve’s body kept him from moving.
“Not much of a conversationalist, are we?” Tony asked with a little grin. Steve chuckled, his cheeks a little pink. “That’s alright, I’ve been told I talk enough for three!”
Steve took a deep breath, remembering his place, his position of dominance. What Tony wanted. “Impatient, sweetheart?” Steve cooed, “I’ll take care of you, don’t you worry.”
Tony nodded, a look of reverence on his face, as he settled two warm palms on Steve’s hips, fingertips pressing in gently to Steve’s golden skin. “Thank you, Sir.”
“How can you be so sure?” Steve was listless. Tony couldn’t even bear to listen to him, to look at him. That seemed like hatred to Steve.
to.” Clint had said sullenly one night as he, Steve, and Natasha sat together in the common room. Natasha had touched Clint’s shoulder silently. Steve did not speak again about his frustration with Iron Man’s identity.
It took Steve a moment to realize that Tony had begun to panic at his hesitation, and he hurried to get words out. “Yes, yeah, Tony, that’s so good, I’m proud of you for telling me that.” Steve hoped his tone was warm and sensual rather than terrified. Tony’s heart was pounding under Steve’s hand. “We can definitely do that tonight,” Steve found himself promising, even though the thought of roleplaying as… himself… had him sweating. Not any less hard, however, he noticed.
“Hold on, baby, the main course is still coming.” Steve teased, pulling his thumb away. He brought his hand down to support the back of Tony’s head.
Tony squirmed at that. He did not need someone to ‘take care’ of him. Steve pressed another kiss to Tony’s temple, as if he could hear the disquiet of Tony’s mind. “Shh…” One hand found Tony’s hair, stroking gently. “Let’s get you out of the collar and into a shower. How about that?”
“I’ll bet you are.” Steve said softly. His licked his lips quickly, it was a small movement but it was distracting nonetheless. Tony remembered he had cleaned out and shivered then. Steve grinned and leaned in. “Kiss?” Tony nodded eagerly and was rewarded instantly.
“You have to learn the everyday phrases if you’re gonna learn any language.” Tony signed that with surprising speed, inwardly proud of himself in that moment. He took a slice of the meat lovers pizza and bit into it cold.
Steve was led into the kitchen to be offered a series of different food options. There were finger foods with unfamiliar names from different languages, featuring different meats and different preparations. Steve felt embarrassed but he could not resist the mini cheeseburgers sitting in the center of the table. “Sorry, I guess I’m a man of simple tastes.”
Iron Man changed their trajectory, southbound. “Well, I can’t seem to find any heat readings. But it’s pretty freezing out here. Easy cover. Ugh. Canada.” They suddenly swerved to the right, then began a zig-zag flight pattern. “Machine guns? Really? These guys are so
When he emerged from the bathroom, he found Tony lying under the sheets with his eyes closed. Steve carefully tried to slide into the bed without disturbing Tony, unsure if the man had fallen asleep. When Steve’s knee dipped the mattress, Tony’s eyes opened.
Tony had been so vulnerable in front of Steve the previous night. One would never have had been able to imagine
of here. Gotten more intel on what’s around us, but without my HUD I can just go aerial, but not too fast unless I want to muss up my hair, or, y’know, break my neck. And now Hawkeye and Widow will know who I
“Yes, Tony. Their name is Izzy and they have worked for you for two weeks and that is the longest you have kept a secretary since me, so please don’t make HR find yet another replacement. Be nice.”
He took out two slices of bread and picked out some slices of meat and cheese before setting a completed sandwich on a plate for Tony. “You’re going to eat while we talk, then.”
Tony whined softly and Steve pushed hard into Tony’s wet heat, steady and pounding. They fell into a harsh rhythm, Tony groaning and moaning around Steve’s cock, taking in tiny gasps of air when Steve let up minisculely for him. Steve roughed up his throat, pulling and pushing Tony with two fists in his hair; all the while Tony held Steve’s hips tightly, fingers digging in as he fights the urge to touch himself, no doubt.
He pressed his nose against Tony’s ear. “Tony, I’m Captain America,” he whispered, before holding his breath. Waiting, listening, hoping.
Steve seemed to respect the effort Tony put into getting to his dick, so made no move to remove Tony’s hand. Steve continued to fuck Tony with his fingers, slowly and steadily destroying Tony’s resolve.
Pepper managed to express her eye-roll with silence. “I expect you down here tomorrow at 9’o’clock sharp.”
Shoving Tony to his knees on the plush bath mat, Steve grabbed a towel off the rack to dry Tony off. Patting his hair gently, Steve made sure not to obscure Tony’s face. Like that, Tony had a tempting view of Steve’s erection, close enough he could have simply leaned forward to press his nose into the trim pubes at the base. He wouldn’t, though. Not without permission. Approval.
“Bite.” Steve’s voice was a breathy whisper. He brought his hand to the back of Tony’s head and growled when Tony tentatively dragged his teeth along his erect nipple while sucking. “Good fuckin’ boy.” Spurring Tony on, Steve reached down with his free hand to wrap it around Tony’s cock, its first touch tonight.
, feeling safe and at rest and needed. He wondered briefly what the man above him was getting out of this interaction, but he realized he knew.
“Put your hands to good use, and we’ll see if you get to come once I’m done.” At that, Tony gasped and reached up, nearly afraid that Steve’s grin and the glint in his eye were a trap to fall into. Probably were, but he didn’t much care at that point.
Steve found himself drifting as he laid alone in the bedroom. He just… had sex. For the first time. With
His time was up. “See, if you don’t have an answer, it’s been too long. If you don’t find someone, I’ll find someone
No Steve around to prod him and push him, to humiliate and praise him in the same breath.That was just fine. Tony didn’t need him anyway.
of that. He reasserted his grip on Tony’s throat and moved himself to straddle Tony’s thighs, crowding him into submission. Tony’s eyes looked up into Steve’s, his hands clinging to Steve’s biceps. “Here is how tonight is going to go:
“Or would you rather I take the lead here?” Steve spoke carefully, stroking Tony’s jaw with his thumb. Tony blinked for just a moment, then nodded silently. Steve grinned. “That’s what I thought. You know I know what’s best for you.”
“I…” Steve did not know what to say. “What do I do if…” He trailed off, eyeing the name of the client.
He thought back at what had been included on Tony’s list. Biting, dominance, rope bondage, humiliation… Steve had spent more than a few hours looking at every piece of information V.P. Escorts had provided him with from their Activities database, as well as online from niche websites.The rope usage had definitely been something Steve was interested in and he wanted to do it correctly.
He took a moment to gather himself before exiting his workshop and heading up to the communal floor. It was dubbed ‘communal’, however Tony rarely stepped foot on that floor unless it was in the middle of the night. It would have certainly looked strange for the billionaire landlord and tech support of the Avengers to duck into the communal kitchen to raid the leftovers, even if his body guard was on the team.
to be here. The mirrored elevator walls allowed Steve a last few moments to double check his appearance. He fought back the panic rising through his chest, to his throat. It was impossible that Stark would recognize him as Captain America. He was consistent in wearing his cowl while in uniform and at the SHIELD base. His identity was highly classified, and he doubted Stark had the interest to delve into his details, given how much he seemed to dislike Captain America.
The elevator came to a stop, and the doors opened to reveal a smartly dressed Tony Stark standing by to greet him. Steve suddenly felt incredibly exposed, particularly because he could feel Stark’s eyes roaming over his body. The evening’s purpose became very real.
Tony’s leash suddenly has slack. Tony opened his eyes, fingertips brushing Steve’s thighs plaintively. “No, wait, stop—” Tony began, pleading in a too-small voice. Steve froze, he was halfway to kneeling upright again. Tony’s forehead was still warm from their contact, now gone. Missing.
Steve decided not to think about the certain swirl in his gut that he felt when he heard Tony call him Captain out of the field.
“Shh…” Steve’s voice was warm and soft. A gentle kiss was pressed to Tony’s cheek. “Wanted it to be easy for you to get back to sleep. Time’s almost up, but you need rest.”
he’d said. Tony groaned and dragged one hand down his face. He had been so excited to be praised, hoping to be special and rewarded for following Steve’s instructions. Maybe he had still been in subspace. Yeah, that would explain it. Any sub would crave affection and praise after doing a good job, being good. And Tony had been
Steve scanned Tony’s blushing face, his dilated pupils, his ragged breathing, and smiled. “Well, sweetheart, you play it off like you’re a blushing bride and it’s adorable.” Steve’s smile only grew wider when Tony’s blush burned brighter.
He moved on to Tony’s belt, and looked at Tony for any discomfort. “Your poor cock has been ignored all night.” Steve began to unbuckle Tony’s belt and unzip his fly. He laid his palm on Tony’s erection, still held tight in his boxers. “You have been such a good cockslut, let’s give it a little reward, shall we?”
Steve took a quivering breath at the sight, imagining what it would be like to have that fantastic hot mouth on his cock. “Hold on, baby, the main course is still coming.” Steve teased again, pulling his thumb out of Tony’s talented mouth. He moved his hand down to support Tony’s head.
He returned with the brown leather collar and its matching leash in hand. He draped the leash over Tony’s shoulder as he wrapped the leather around Tony’s neck. Steve took Tony’s chin between his thumb and forefinger, tipping it up to look in Tony’s eyes. “You’re gorgeous.”
Tony attempted to shrug, but with his hands otherwise occupied (one still pinned by Steve’s left hand, the other on his own cock), it was not apparent. “I’m generally not polite before breakfast.”
Steve looked at Tony’s eyes, watching for cues. Tony’s eyes were glazed, pupils blown making his brown eyes look black, mouth pink, and lips swollen. He looked thoroughly fucked and he nodded quietly. Steve felt oddly proud that he had made Tony look like that.
“You want me to fuck you, Tony? How do you want it, baby? Rough, on your elbows and knees? Want me to bend you over and take you and leave bite marks across your shoulders, bruises on your hips?” Steve rolled his hips again, leaning in once again for a kiss. This time, it was fast, sloppy, and he took his time sucking and biting on Tony’s bottom lip before continuing to speak. Tony was blushing and eyes hazy already.
to the list. He was then prompted for any Notes to send to the client. He did not know what to say. He left it blank and sent the email.
Steve’s jacket and clothing were left folded on the bedroom floor. He arranged Tony on his back, his head hanging off the edge of the mattress. Steve was holding two small bottles in front of Tony’s eyes, one red and one yellow.
Tony — seen right through his insanity and talked him through it. Tony remembered the feeling of being held in Steve’s strong arms, hushed and comforted, but not stifled. Not infantilized for his tears. Steve had changed the energy to sexual so quickly; Tony had crawled to the bedroom for him.
After they were clean and dry, Tony and Steve returned to the bedroom. Steve tucked Tony under the sheets before turning to coil the rope and return it and Tony’s collar to their drawer. Time seemed to stand still as he carefully wrapped the rope, his thoughts suddenly abuzz.
After a minute of tinkering with the torso piece of the suit and talking aloud with JARVIS, the suit then folded in on itself and arranged itself into a carrying case. Only then did Tony turn his attention to Steve.
Steve huffed, victorious. He withdrew his fingers and Tony’s mouth opened again, in protest, before he felt the head of Steve’s cock press against his hole. Just the head, pressing so deliciously against his sensitive slick spot.
to say is that Tony is stubborn. I spent a good amount of time spying on him to know how much of a hard-head he can be—”
Tony breathed deeply. The smell of his pine and spearmint bubble bath. The firm warmth of Steve’s chest against his back as his ribs expanded. He washed around the reactor, enjoying the gentle touches of comfort Steve provided in his hair as he did so. He smelled his pomegranate shampoo. He closed his eyes and let his mind drift, let Steve take care of him.
“We don’t have to take a bath,” Tony said, leaning heavily against Steve’s side, cheek pressed against his collarbone soothingly.
“Two nights in a row you’re MIA for secret reasons and it’s not a relationship? Come on, Tony, I know you better than that. You pushed things aside for him, you like him. Don’t be stubborn, go talk to him.”
Tony let his left hand slip down his bare stomach to his cock, which had been stirring since his thoughts had returned to Steve and his gorgeous body, his gorgeous smile, his beautiful eyes and the way they looked at Tony with adoration and without pity. Steve had
Tony sighed and circled a worrisome point in the proposal paper. “I don’t want to sell tech that can be weaponized, Pep.” He looked across his cluttered desk to her with tired eyes.
Steve smiled and replaced the pineapple lube in the drawer. He decided to make a show of applying the lube from the red bottle onto his hard cock, stroking it from the base to the head. When Tony licked his lips, Steve couldn’t stop himself from teasing, and trying to touch upon the request for humilation. “Something big to stuff your big mouth with.”
Before another plea could be uttered, three fingers were shoved into Tony’s open mouth. He moaned, muffled and desperate; the invading fingers were a satisfying weight on Tony’s tongue while they brushed at the edge of his throat. “You will come when I’m ready, and not a moment sooner.” The growled order was followed by a drag of teeth pinching Tony’s earlobe. Steve gave a squeeze to Tony’s balls. “You’re mine. Don’t you dare forget that.”
“Sounds like fun. Want me to help you study?” The glee in Natasha’s voice was unmistakable and Steve had to look up at her face.
“Well, they’ve been pretty interested in the possibility of upgrading their deception screening tech to process live footage. And Stark tech is the superior developer, as we know.” She said smoothly, shooting him an encouraging wink.
It was only once he had requested Cap’s floor to JARVIS did Tony begin to panic. He might be able to drop off the cowl if Mr. America hadn’t made his way to his floor yet. “J, is Cap on his floor yet?”
Tony tapped impatiently on his phone while he waited for this evening’s entertainment to arrive. He was willing himself not to get too absorbed in any design schematics or SI documents Pepper had been prodding him about.  He wanted to be relaxed.
“Can’t stop you, but if you get off without my permission, you definitely won’t like the consequences,” Steve said. Something in Tony’s mind made him think he definitely
Tony took a quick inhale. “Uh, no. Not yet.” He looked down at Steve’s waiting hand for a moment, considering it, before taking it. Steve gave his hand a gentle, hopefully reassuring, squeeze. He looked up at Tony, who was still standing by the bed in front of him. Tony’s cheeks looked pale, like he hadn’t seen the sun in days, and his lips looked soft—they were almost red from being pinched between Tony’s teeth. Steve did not think Tony was aware of how much he abused his bottom lip. But, oh, Steve wanted so much to do that himself.
Steve was getting close. A few more thrusts, then he held Tony’s hair tightly and stilled, when he realized. He didn’t know if Tony wanted
There was an email notification from V.P. Escorts. Tony requested another appointment. Despite Steve’s better instincts, he accepted. Tonight.
“You need to get laid.” Natasha said at some point as they were huddled together for warmth in an abandoned apartment complex, a few blocks away from a target’s last reported location.
“I never wanted to hurt you. It wasn’t my plan. I don’t think I ever had a plan. What I did was selfish. Immoral…” Steve had a sudden flash of back home, attending service with his ma and listening to the priest’s words. Immoral.
“Tony, Tony, whoa, calm down, hold your horses!” Steve had to grab Tony’s face between his hands and force him to look at Steve. A blush arose on Tony’s cheeks and he was fighting tears as Steve pulled him into a hug. One large hand firmly rubbed Tony’s back, another hand cradling the back of his neck. “Shh… I didn’t mean anything like that.”
He darted into his bedroom and skidded to the floor on the side of the bed out of sight from the door. After a beat, Steve felt ridiculous. He could be mature. He could be brave. He’s Captain America—he could face Tony. He could talk.
, if that wasn’t the sexiest thing Steve had ever heard. He grinned down at the man he had below him, at his mercy. “That can be arranged.”
To skip the sex with not-Tony: “The next few weeks” is where it starts. And then you can jump down to read the last paragraph of the chapter.
“Good,” Steve said gruffly, “I wouldn’t want to put my dick in something less than pristine.” Steve placed both hands on Tony’s hips firmly to keep Tony stationary, face to face with him. “I’d have to scrub you down from top to bottom, every nook.” Steve’s right hand curled around Tony’s left ass cheek, fingertips brushing against his dry hole, clean, soft and perfect just as it was yesterday. “‘Yes’ is your final answer, Stark?”
Steve grinned devilishly as he settled each knee on either side of Tony’s hips. Tony wondered what Steve would do. Would Steve ride him? No, he doubted it.
He didn’t know what to say to fix whatever had been between them. Tony was sullenly drunk, rubbing his eyes into his sleeves. It struck Steve how different Tony was from his typical extroverted persona when he was drunk, it made him wonder how much of his behaviour was a front for the public, a show for an unimaginably expansive audience. He gave Tony’s shoulder a small squeeze.
Steve emerged with a smile. Tonight, he wore a black t-shirt and jeans, his leather jacket hung on the crook of his elbow, both hands in his pockets as he stepped towards Tony.
Steve licked his lips as a bead of clear liquid collected at the tip of Tony’s cock and he gave Tony a gentle stroke.
“Yeah, they—” They were suddenly careening towards the forest floor. Steve was pulled to the center of Iron Man’s chest and they rotated for the suit to take the brunt of the impact.
Steve leaned forward again, slicking Tony’s hole with his spit, licking and pressing Tony’s tight entrance with his tongue. Tony shivered, struggling to keep himself still. Steve laid a slap on Tony’s left ass cheek, and Tony appreciated the balance the sensation gave him.
Steve’s eyes were scanning through the snowy woodland, trying to see a pattern in the disturbed trees. A thin trail of void led backward from the fire they were fleeing from. “Iron Man, we have to follow that line in the trees. They were hiding out somewhere there.”
Steve flushed. He could not or did not want to believe his ears. Through Tony’s declaration, Steve was enveloped in a rising sense of dread-- once the name “Captain America” was uttered, his pulse was in his ears and his mind was reeling at the implications of Tony’s proposal.
Everything became a haze as Tony focused dreamily on the fullness of his mouth, the pounding on the back of his throat, the taste of bitter precome and sweet strawberries. The hair at the nape of his neck was fisted tightly once again and Steve’s thrusts halted, his cock lodged fully in Tony’s wet heat. Tony swallowed around him desperately, relishing the weight of Steve’s cock in his mouth.
Steve was not convinced. “I’m going to need some incentive.” He teased, voice purring straight into Tony’s ear. God, Tony could have shot his load right then, Steve’s voice was perfect, dominant, playful, and sexy. So fucking sexy.
Steve’s eyes darkened, grin like the Cheshire cat, which silently said ‘I know something you don’t.’
Tony let his mind wander to the previous night. Steve had been so good to him; held him down, tied him up, talked him into subspace so easily. Tony felt unbelievably relaxed around Steve. Tony had had such an intense orgasm he had passed out, and came to with Steve still inside of him, fucking him hard and
, ah!” Tony continued to string together airy pants and pleas as Steve at last pushed inside. He could not seem to stop, his urgency being matched with Steve’s pace. A blur of full and empty, bursts of light in his vision with every thrust against his prostate, and the flurry of words ceaselessly coming from his mouth.
Cap grunted as he felt the unmistakeable strike of a bullet graze his thigh. Iron Man must be monitoring him because he reported to the comms, “Cap is unprotected from oncoming fire.”
The narration swings between insight from Tony’s and Steve’s POVs, I hope it’s clear! Also let me know if I missed anything I should tag :)
“Great,” Clint grumbled. “So, where are you planning on dropping us off? ‘Cause I’m going to need something with sleeves.”
Tony grinned. “You jealous? Maybe next time I’ll lend you some, but since I paid for the overnight, I’ll get my money’s work of your ridiculous body.” Steve tilted his head, staring up at Tony. The tone sounded playful, but the words were… Steve did not know.
Pepper’s face twisted in confusion, eyes widening in shock and then narrowing with suspicion. “You’re… early,” she said tentatively.
“Do you want me to leave?” Steve asked, when all he wanted to do was feed, water, and care for this wobbly man.
Steve shook his head, embarrassed. “I thought… Nat kept telling me to put myself out there. And… And I was… I didn’t know how. I figured sex could be stress relief, and if Nat believed I was finally taking care of myself maybe then I would be.”
This is Steve's perspective of Tony and Steve's first appointment, his perspective of the evening, his thoughts, which may or may not align with what Tony was thinking that night.
“Certainly, Sir.” The screen cleared but Tony was still thinking about that list of his. God, what had he been thinking? No wonder it took so long for them to get back to him – he was basically screaming ‘Tony Stark wants to be your bitch!’
“Sir, your guest from V.P. Escorts has arrived for the evening. Shall he be brought up?” JARVIS’s voice pulled Tony out of his thoughts. He checked the time. 8:55pm.
