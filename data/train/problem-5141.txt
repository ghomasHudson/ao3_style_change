Castiel was silent. He couldn't find it in himself to lie.
Finding out they were expecting a pup— it had been a miracle. A reward for the pain, the hurt and the despair.
"I love you," Castiel mumbles, his own eyes wet with tears as he stares down at Dean, who gives him a weak smile and rests his forehead against his cheek, "-don't go back. Please. Stay with me, I need you, Dean. I can't do this alone."
A tear rolls down his face.
A glance at his watch tells Castiel it's around ten forty-five AM.
"Don't get me riled up, Sam. For your best interests."
Dean laughs, but his eyes twinkle with wonder as he brushes his nose against Castiel's, and a flurry of warmth unfurls inside Castiel's chest at the casual gesture.
For a moment, the world around Castiel comes to a crashing halt as he drinks in the truth of Dean's words.
"Yeah? What do you think?" Dean teases.
"Sure, we'll help you with anything," he sighs, and Dean nods in accordance.
his lips, his mind, his heart
Castiel's message is followed by no response at all, and the online symbol next to Green's name on the messenger disappears as well. An anchor drops within Castiel's gut.
“Life’s unfair, Blue, nothing we can do about it. But look at the impact he made. People worship him, buddy. He’s an icon, and the world will always know him as such.” A dim buzz, from the beer must be, thrums under Dean’s skin as he speaks.
The maid outfit, erm, it suited Castiel. Dean had no idea why in the world Castiel would wear something as vulgar as that, especially when he was working at
"Which I despise, by the way."
Jack nods with a gulp.
. Could you, Blue?"
"Mhm. They sound different now, just fancy words on a white paper, but when you're in love, it's as if every word means the world." Castiel smiles.
Now that Dean thinks of it, it does sound marvellous, this new plan of his.
Part of him knows better. Part of him knows it's best if they never meet. Besides, Castiel doesn't appear to be inclined towards speaking to him anymore. Not that Dean blames him. Truth be told, Dean wants to see Castiel just as much as Castiel wants to see him, but he knows it would only complicate whatever is between them.
Castiel simply raises his eyebrows, unable to answer with the burger in his mouth, and Dean pokes his puffed-up cheeks, to which Castiel simply rolls his eyes. Once he's swallowed the bite down, Castiel imitates Dean's previous actions— wipes his fingers on a napkin, and meets Dean's eyes to regard him with an expectant look.
“What’s that?” Dean asks.
"Do I look like I did?"
"Erh, alright," Castiel shrugged, and turned away, deciding to carry on with his music hunting, only for a hand to grip him by the shoulder.
Drowning in his lust, unable to control himself, Castiel turned over, and just to please Dean even more, spread his legs apart and held his ass open, showing Dean his puffy, red virgin asshole (although there remained nothing virginal about it anymore).
"Damn it, Dean, why do you have to make everything so complicated?" he asks, eyes wide and breath shallow.
“I know, but to be an openly queer musician in the nineties, think about all the people he inspired, all the people his existence validated. Of course, people still speculate whether he was bisexual or if he realized he was gay later in life, but knowing for a fact that he was queer, I mean, it’s exceptional. Sometimes I wish I had an idol like him to look up to when I was young, but my parents never indulged in rock music, and my brothers and I, we practically grew up in a church.”
sorry, I was eating. So, tell me what book you got."
quite funny, Mr.Green, what makes you think it isn't?"
more than himself.
"On the outside."
"Well, how have you been feeling this morning?"
’ don't linger in the air inside the room.
"You'd rather come home once every three or four months, covered in blood, broken and shaken."
"So, my car's right around here, hope you don't mind walking for a minute or two."
"That's Mr. Winchester for you."
Dean croaks out, and Castiel sighs, before reaching for the soap of bar and nudging Dean to turn around. Castiel rubs the soap over his back, lathering it all across the vast expanse of his bare skin, before letting the soap wash away and massaging his fingers into Dean's flesh, pressing into the cricks at his neck, or working at the knots in his shoulders, thumbs digging into the flesh, before he steps away and allows the water to pour down Dean's skin, silently washing away the soap. Castiel turns Dean around and hands him the soap, before turning away and shampooing his own hair, letting Dean clean himself up.
"Just wear it."
Both men pause in tandem, caught off-guard by the other’s words. Castiel shuts the book, setting it aside as he leans back, head brushing against the wall as he sucks in a deep breath.
"I can see that." Castiel breathes, and his finger runs down over the tip of the scar right above Dean's right eyebrow, across his nose, to where the scar dips down onto the left side of Dean's face, ending on his cheek below his left eye.
A smile graces Dean's lips at the memory of Castiel.
Jack straightens up, a guilty look crawling across his face, and Castiel smiles. Of course, he hasn't. But Castiel doesn't quite blame him. After all, he's got homework and assignments
"Hm?"
are you doubting me? I ain't eighty yet, my ears work, my eyes work. He called me too, told me he was movin' out sooner than before. You can read the notice if you want. It's the seventh of December today, right? Means he's leaving in… six days. On the thirteenth."
rung through the room, and Deanna cracked an eye open, only to find Juju, their cat, sauntering into the bedroom. Deanna held her hand out, and as if having understood her, Juju jumped onto the bed and trotted over to Deanna. Deanna pulled the covers on Cas and herself, and watched as Juju plopped himself down on her covered chest, purring when she stroked his head.
"Mhm, me too. But it happened and I couldn't call you soon enough, I'm sorry—"
This is the man Dean has fallen for, body, soul and mind.
"My, how far along are you?"
supposed to be here. That he's choosing Castiel. That something changed within him, something that made him come back to Castiel.
"Of course. I've been feeling strange ever since." Castiel sighs, and Dean turns to him in the slightest.
"What about yours?"
Castiel hums, fingers dancing against the black ink tattoo near Dean's collarbone, tracing the flames of the anti-possession symbol with his nail, "And again? And again, and again, and ag—"
Castiel nods, but he doesn't care about that anymore. He needs to get away from Dean, from the world, for a few moments. He needs a second to
"How noble," Castiel yawns, as if somehow put off by Dean's words, "-and what of it? Why are you here?"
. Black smoke slipped inside his throat, and he realised just what Dean was doing.
. Omega heat. With instincts high on alert, Deanna walked into the living room, where the scent had diluted the usual pine scent of their air freshener, and yet, it wasn't as heavy. Her eyes snapped towards the bedroom, and she knew at once, that the bedroom was the source of the scent.
Dean smiles at the sheer randomness of the statement, a warmth unfurling in his chest at the fact that Castiel feels comfortable enough to speak his mind to Dean.
"I don't have anything for Cas. I'm just... scared. And
"I'm surprised you forgot," Dean laughs, but it doesn't sound genuine
"Some of us," Dean said, pressing a kiss to Castiel's forehead, "—actually decided to wear long sleeves."
The next moment, he was leaning down, near Castiel's face, and Castiel held his breath as he watched Dean move closer to him.
“Don’t be mad at me, Cas, I was just trying to
The lighter falls to the counter next to him and the paper drops from his hand into the sink until not a single trace of it, except for the char on the sink wall, remains. That too, dwindles away the moment Dean twists the tap and a stream of water gushes out, sucking down the drain what was once a confession of Dean's love.
Grabbing a glass of water, Jack shrugs before pressing it to his lips.  "Just get Tinder. Or Grindr."
"Oh, thanks, I'll take that,” he says, and waits until his student and her mother have walked away before shutting his door.
"I like the sound of that."
"We have time, Dean. We have all the time in the world."
"You say that again," Dean warned, squeezing his arms around Castiel and lifting him off the ground as Castiel yelped, "-I'm gonna' break your teeth."
Castiel's warmth moves away, and Dean's heart skips a beat, but a moment later, soft, gentle lips press against Dean's, and he stands frozen, rooted to the ground as Castiel barely brushes their lips together.
"You callin' me a liar?"
. The moment you kill me, the spell will die with me," she pauses, and Dean nods to her words, urging her to go on, "-But in case of a collateral spell; if I curse you with a collateral spell, the others around you will be affected, and not you. In such a case, the spell will derive its power from
He sucked bright, red marks into Castiel's neck, never breaking skin, but enough to ward off anybody else who'd try to compete for his omega's attention, enough to brand the omega as his own, and in turn, every small noise, every whimper, every moan Castiel spilled, significant of how much his alpha pleased him was enough reassurance for Dean.
"I suppose..."
"Alright, you know what," Castiel starts, turning away with a hand on his hip, "-good night Mr. Green, I'll knock tomorrow."
But the warmth never leaves.
They speak for a while. Dean is smiling, although sadly, and Kreschner is... Castiel can't see Kreschner's face, but he knows he's speaking. And then, at once, something changes in the air between them. Something that tenses Dean's shoulders, something that hardens his eyes, something that washes over Dean, and for a second, his and Castiel’s eyes meet from across the parking lot. Castiel wants to smile, but he can't, because there is an intensity in Dean's eyes— something resolute, something shattering.
Dean sucks in a breath before plucking a fry off the plate and popping it in his mouth. Castiel finds his eyes lingering on Dean's lips.
If there was a book filled with piano notes, was there a piano in the manor?
If the wetness near Dean's knees is to be considered, it seems as if Castiel as orgasmed as well.
Castiel smiled. What else could he possibly do?
"I am so glad we bought a bed the first thing in this house."
"Dean? Are you alright?"
Jack, his student, reaches here at four-thirty precisely, every Thursday, and since he has about five minutes left on the clock, Castiel decides to go through his student's notes once again. The coffee is set aside as he grabs the bundle of papers
"Rowena, please, we need your help. It's Castiel, he's– he's hurt. Something is wrong with him."
"Yes," Castiel chuckled, his face flushed red as he stared up at Dean from under his coy, fluttering eyelashes, "-very hungry. Only for master."
"Cas? Hey, it's me, Dean, I need you to wake up for me, Rowena's going to do a little spell on you, yeah, and we'll figure out what's wrong. Cas?" Dean shakes him by the shoulder, and after a few, long seconds, Castiel stirs, his hand creeping up to rub at his eyes, and he heaves a deep breath, before blinking his round, blue eyes open, and rolling onto his back.
Silence meets Dean's ears, and he knows he did cross a line. After all, the fact that his neighbour is sharing this with him doesn't give him the right to preach to him.
"Six-hundred," Castiel replied timidly, nibbling on his bottom lip.
"Remember during the fight at the witch's altar, when she blew a curse towards you?"
A warm, calloused hand ran down his bare chest.
"Cas," Dean croaks, "-what's wrong?"
"How was school?"
Mustering as much courage as he could, he stepped into Electrical. He wasn't fond of the room, nor did he think anybody else was. It was the perfect spot for an Impostor to kill someone. Dark, quiet, murky, and full of strange corners where who knows what could be lurking. As he approached the light circulator, he realised however, that the room was empty. Breathing a sigh of relief, Castiel stepped up to the circulator to fix the lights, when at once, a loud clang rung behind him.
"Now, boy, this won't hurt at all, it will tickle a bit, but I need you to remain silent at all times. It is imperative that I complete this spell. Alright?" Rowena asks and pulls away to grab the bowl set on the nightstand.
Dean appears to be quite jaunty this morning. Of course, this is no surprise to Castiel, who knows Dean is a naturally buoyant man.
Dean groaned, loud enough for the sound to echo through the shack, before he slammed in deep and hard, and his piping hot come filled Castiel's ass. Silence filled the room for a few seconds, as Castiel cried— so close to orgasming, yet ruined in a split second when Dean stopped— until Dean spoke up.
Although confusion sparkles in Hannah's eyes, Dean feels nothing but excitement and anticipation thrumming under his skin at the prospect of seeing Castiel at last. Hannah nods solemnly, and pulls the door open for Dean to enter. He walks in, still in attention, his posture straight and rigid and his gait sharp. Hannah swallows thickly, before mumbling something along the lines of 'good night, your highness', and shows herself out. The door shuts behind Dean with a firm thud, and at last, Dean's eyes wander over to the front of the chambers.
"Actually," The alpha said, and Castiel turned at once, hope rising in his chest as he stepped closer to the alpha, their eyes meeting from a few feet away, "-I have an idea."
"Fine," he groans, and on the other end, Castiel hears a faint shuffling, a light tapping on the floor boards. He knocks at the wall, only to be met with utter silence.
"My father was in the Corps. Mom was a medical officer. I'm the eldest son, so obviously they wanted me to join. And my dad was my inspiration, my biggest mentor, and I wanted to follow his footsteps, so I enlisted as soon as possible. My brother, however, didn't give a single shit about serving the country on the borders
Moans spilt past Castiel's lips as Dean's hands wandered up towards the zipper on the back of Castiel's space-suit, the other curling around Castiel's head to protect him from the metal door. Castiel curled his back into Dean's touch, feeling the zipper slide down, slow and tempting, and Dean pulled away from their kiss, instead diving into the depths of Castiel's neck. A whimper escaped Castiel's throat, and he felt himself squirm in Dean's arms with need and arousal. His cock grew heavier, and strained against the fabric of his suit, when at last, the zipper unraveled, and Castiel felt his suit fall open from the chest below. The musty air in the room kissed his skin, leaving goosebumps over his flesh as he let his head fall to the side to allow Dean to suck marks into his skin.
“Read me a poem, will ya’, sweetheart?”
"Right, about that." At once, Sam's voice dims down
And then, Castiel was
A pregnant silence ensues between them, only dissipating when Blue speaks up again.
"Stop that right now or I'm gonna' fuck you so hard into this leather you'll be leaving this car with my pups in your belly."
The movement of someone close to them draws Castiel out of his trance, and he blinks up at a waitress, who clears their dishes away on a tray and wipes the table clean. Dean grabs a paper napkin and rubs his hands clean, and Castiel does the same. They reach for their wallets at the same time, and Dean sends Castiel a threatening look.
Lisa was an angel.
The warmth in his chest. The thumping of his heartbeat. The buzz in his veins.
"Yeah, I guess."
"Well, well, well," At once, the Empty's voice echoes through the room, and Castiel glances around with panicked eyes, as he holds on tightly to Dean, "-perhaps I underestimated you."
Dean brushed his lips against Castiel's in a tender, hesitant touch, simply testing for a moment, before diving in deep. Within Dean's arms, Castiel felt himself give in completely. He had no escape. He had no refuge. He was going to die here, Dean was going to kill him, but with the way Dean kissed him in his final moments, passionate, loving, delicate, it made Castiel feel, in the slightest at least— that the warmth he had shown Dean meant something. Even if he knew Dean would kill him, he knew also, that he would do it with much more affection than he did to the others. And somewhere inside Castiel, unfurled pride at having been Dean's exception, of having been the sole owner of Dean's affections.
A sad smile graces Castiel's lips, but his eyes, cold and devoid of their usual wonder, regard Dean with a guilt-ridden expression.
"Don't lecture me, Sam," Dean admonishes, but Sam persists.
"I'd say we're a little past the stranger zone, aren't we?"
"Some days. But then again, if I'd stayed with her, there's things I would’ve never learnt."
Dismissing his thoughts, Dean ducks into the refrigerator, grabbing a bottle of beer and uncapping it with the bottle-opener magnet on the fridge, before pressing the rim to his lips and drinking the first sip of the chilled, bitter drink. A soft rustle behind him catches his attention, and he glances back at Sam, who enters the kitchen with slow, hesitant steps. His eyes are narrowed at Dean, and his lips turned up in a confused frown.
A smile spreads across Dean's face.
"I don't know."
and then the music stops
Instead of words spilling off his tongue, however, it's tears spilling down his eyes. And then it gets hard to breathe, hard to see, hard to comprehend anything but Cas, and this time, Dean doesn't hold back. He falls, without any qualms or burdens pushing him down, right into Cas's arms. He squeezes Cas, as tight as he can, and buries his face in Castiel's neck.
"I couldn't sleep, Blue, you know it. Besides, I always fall asleep around four and there's about a quarter of an hour left until then. So, I thought I'd keep you a little company."
Next, I'd like to thank my artist, the one and only,
A loud wail echoed through the room as Castiel's eyes widened, his jaw dropped, and his body curled into Dean's touch. His hole, his poor, tiny pink hole, now gaped around Dean's cock, and Castiel cried thick, fat tears when he felt Dean's cock bottom out inside him. Deep. So deep. Too deep. Absently, Castiel grazed a hand over his stomach, and found it bulging with Dean's fat cock plunged deep inside him.
A rich, thick laughter reaches Dean's ear, and at once, his heart quickens. Must be a blessing for anyone to hear this man's laughter each morning.
Dean's eyes flashed red.
"My apologies," Dean clears his throat, and takes a hesitant few steps towards his highness' bed, "-but I had to battle an ambush at the northern borders."
“S’there more?”
"Should I go get my violin?" Castiel asks, eyes wide with childish excitement, lips hung open as he waits for Dean's answer.
"My name is Dean. Dean Winchester."
"With great faith, Orpheus began his journey out of the underworld, joyful that he would once again be reunited with his love. However, as Orpheus was reaching the exit of the Underworld, he could hear the footsteps of his wife behind him. He wanted to turn around and embrace her
"You'll hate me for this, but..."
"I mean it."
"I've been what, Dean?"
,'” he finally says. “You're my friend, Castiel, of course I'm going to bother, of course I'm going to give a shit about you."
"Fine, fine, I plead guilty. I won't call you an Oxford Dictionary. 'Kay?"
His eyes flashed red, and he nosed against Castiel's mating gland, holding himself back in case he ended up doing something they'd regret. His cock splurted out another load of semen, and Dean felt it surround his own cock inside the tightness of Castiel's ass.
"Do you wanna' come with me for a drive? I got my car right around the corner, and erm, we could listen to the tape... Are you from here?" The alpha asked, and Castiel nodded, gripping his sling-bag to keep himself from swaying.
, spluttering with the thick, white come shooting down his throat, burning like gasoline, and although the taste wasn't altogether as bad as he imagined it to be, the sudden onslaught of it caused him to cough, and Dean pulled back, only to grip Castiel by the throat and pull him up.
"Dean?"
Funny how the universe works. How it plants people in your life who make you feel invincible, only to uproot them when you need them the most.
Jack laughs at Castiel's comical expression, shrugging with a shameless grin on his face. "But, for real, Cas, you haven't dated anyone in years, and I've had a girlfriend
Castiel nods to Dean's suggestion, and he feels his face heat up with the way Dean's eyes fix onto him. From the corner of his eye, Castiel notices Dean leaning in, and before he has the time to move, Dean kisses the side of his neck.
With a dejected sigh, Castiel steps away, only to be drawn back by the noise of a knock on the wall behind him.
"Anything," he says with conviction.
-slept."
In a desperate attempt to save the conversation from falling apart, Dean recalls a few notable moments from their conversation the night before.
With a sigh, Castiel grabs his earphones and searches for his phone, which he's sure he put on the coffee table some time ago. Maybe he'll catch up on a podcast; he's been trying to find the time for one for a few days now, but somehow, work always interferes. He feels fresh, having woken up from his sleep not more than three hours ago, which keeps him on his toes all through the evening.
"Sure," Mr. Kreschner says, grumbling to himself, "
Nevertheless, he brushed his fingers over the ivory railing of the staircase, and step-by-step, one hand on his stomach, descended down the stairs. Without Garth or Dean with him, the manor was empty. Standing in the middle of the foyer, Castiel let his sight wander around the chipped, roughened walls and the cracked, plastered fixtures. Now, devoid of his coat and his gloves, Castiel could feel the prick of the snowy air on his skin more intensely. He let his feet carry him, not having a determined destination to his venturing, and soon enough, found himself walking against the walls of the foyer, studying the broken, battered glass frames hung on them, the few shelves resting against them and the thick, layered dust atop them. On one such shelf, he found a book, and with how muddled it was with dust, it almost faded into the brown wooden tint of the shelf. It was leather-bound, and the moment Castiel flipped its pages open, a cloud of dust burst through the air and he ducked his head away to cough.
Relief coursed through his veins as he felt his orgasm spill on the bedsheet, for the fifth— no, sixth time that hour, and yet, he didn't bother pulling his fingers out, rather, pushed in a fourth finger.
A chill tarries in the air around them, of the cool December night, a miserable reminder of Dean's impending departure in the morning. As they walk, a silent, mutual understanding flourishes between them, one where Dean knows Castiel has things to say, and Castiel knows Dean has things to say. And yet, neither speaks. Their fingers brush against each other, only for Dean to jerk his hand away at the sparks thrumming under his skin. Castiel mumbles an apology with a blush on his face, and Dean wonders if his face appears as red as well.
"You make a solid point. But then how am I to match a face to this enticing voice of yours?"
And the morning after, they never spoke a word about it.
Exactly four seconds later, Castiel hears someone shuffle into the room across the wall.
"Come again?"
"Does yours?"
One more step.
"Shhhh... S'gonna' be okay, s'all gonna' be okay. I'm not crazy, baby, I'm not going to hurt you. We need to get you nice and wet, right? If we don't, your little cunt's gonna' keep hurting, and as little as I care, I just don't think that's fair for you, is it?"
, and God, they need to come up with more adjectives in the English language. Dean finds himself nearly speechless.
Footsteps echo on the ground outside.
"That's a very beautiful thought, sweetheart. What made you think of it?" Dean’s arms tighten around Castiel.
I’m not straight. Not completely. I like women. And men.”
"I'm gonna' take care of him, papa. Forever," She said at last, determination glinting within her big blue eyes. Castiel ran a hand through her wavy blonde hair, and pressed a kiss to her forehead.
"And I'm sorry, I really am." Bright green eyes gazed up at Castiel, and before Castiel could run, Dean had him pinned against the metal door, one hand gripping Castiel's narrow waist, and the other cradling Castiel's jaw as Dean stroked a thumb over his cheekbone. As if on instinct, Castiel felt his eyes flutter shut.
and on a support beam across them, pieces of abstract art. The large window, similar to Dean's, has its shutters pulled down. Castiel hangs his keys on a hook next to the door and shuts the door behind them.
"You're, you're moving out? When? Why?"
"I did. Up until we were told to bomb buses filled with supposed terrorists, or raid houses of men
"Oh yes," he moaned, as Dean continued to ruthlessly fuck two fingers into his hole, stretching them, tugging them, crooking them, scissoring them, hitting the right spots inside Castiel that had slick dribbling down his thighs.
"You know what it is."
Castiel grins.
In the blink of an eye, Dean turned Castiel over onto his back, and grabbed him by his hips. He pulled Castiel flush against his body, until Dean's cock rubbed against the flesh of Castiel's ass, and Castiel gasped, pressing the back of his palm into his mouth to stifle a moan as he felt Dean heave his hips up and split them open, until the tip of his fat cock was nudging right against Castiel's sensitive hole.
"Castiel," Dean called out, and Castiel froze. He knew he wouldn't be able to run any farther, as he fell back against the large trunk of the tree, and met Dean's eyes from across the dimly lit grove.
There's an edge to Dean's voice, and Castiel winces at the tone, only for Dean to slide his hands around Castiel's waist and pull him back to embrace him.
"Ho, ho, Mr.Textbook, someone is hella’ salty today."
"You're lucky, Dean, you know that?" he chuckles softly and smiles, although his smile doesn't quite reach his eyes, "- you're lucky to have someone who has seen you for who you are— who sees nothing but your soul, with its imperfections, its flaws, its impurities— and yet, loves you more than they could ever love anything else. Castiel isn’t just in love with you, Dean, he’s— he’s devoted to you. And you should be savouring every second you spend with him instead of holding yourself back. Yes, facing the truth might hurt, but what good will lying do? And come on, how long are you going to keep lying to yourself? You need this. You need someone you can lean on.”
“Things came up, Cas. The house I was supposed to move back to, dad’s house, the renovation wrapped up way sooner than expected. Sam called me on Sunday, said I had to move in as soon as I could or there’d be problems with the neighborhood council and whatnot. I didn’t have a choice.”
The pain stops. It vanishes. As if it had never been there before. As if Dean never felt it.
Not wanting to prolong the silence between them, and mostly to distract himself, because he knows it's only a matter of a few seconds before he says something he’ll regret, he changes the topic.
"You feel that? That's your fault. Make it right."
The doors flew open, and Deanna felt her alpha-instincts set ablaze as soon as her eyes fell upon the slender, naked body on the bed, knees held up, one hand sinking between her thighs, the other pinching a dusky, brown nipple between two fingers.
"Reminds me of another quote," He smiles weakly, "-
Dean's heart ceases to beat.
A finger drags down his back and dips into his ass, dragging down the taint before reaching the tight rim around his hole, and it punches a gasp out of him. Castiel leans down lower and meets Dean halfway for a kiss. This time, their lips crush against each other, noses pressing, breaths heaving rapid, and wandering hands drifting over each other's skin.
Behind him, he clicks the door shut. The bathroom is small, compact, made for one person only— which doesn't allow him much space to breathe— but the solitude is more than welcome. His hands wrap around the rim of the sink, and he doubles over as a stream of tears rolls down his face. His lips purse, his eyes ache, his vision is hazy, and he slaps a hand over his mouth to muffle the noise of his sobs as his tears, one by one by one, fall into the white, ceramic sink.
"Okay, you wanna
"I wish it were that easy."
"Were you waiting for me all this time? That's sweet of you, baby, did you want your alpha to be the first to fuck your virgin hole?" Dean growled, and yet, Castiel couldn't get himself to focus on Dean's words because Dean's cock was
"Mint— really— why don't you just squeeze a bunch of toothpaste in your mouth?" Dean retorts, and Castiel narrows his eyes at the wall.
No response.
Somehow, Castiel losing hope about Dean altogether is monumentally worse than his incessant pleas.
you're
"Oh, you were a Marine? You don't sound that old. "
The man across the wall chuckles, and Dean hears a slight thump. Must be the man sitting down.
"Sorry," Dean starts, looking away from him, "-didn't mean to Hulk out back there. Just–"
"I'm aware," Castiel urges him on.
"Give me your name, and I'll make it even better." Dean's eyes, chips of coal, now unfurled into bright apple-green, and somehow, with the fingers tweaking Castiel's nipples, the swollen nub aching for more contact, Castiel found himself speaking unbidden.
"Nothing new?"
"No way, did you make this yourself?" Dean asks, and Castiel nods in response, only to remind himself Dean can't see him.
"I don't want you to be," he muttered under his breath, as he dropped his mouth open and pressed his tongue flat over the head of Dean's cock. He licked his tongue around the length, and laved his spit all across the tip, sucking it in with an obscene slurp, even when he felt a trace of pain at the bottom of his jaw. He looked up at Dean, hoping he was alright with his skill, especially since Castiel hadn't had much practice before, but in turn, Dean simply had his head thrown back and his fingers massaging Castiel's scalp. Castiel decided he wouldn't keep thinking of whether he was right or wrong— he would simply do his best, and work his mouth around Dean's cock as he pleased.
Dean shuts his eyes, and lets his head fall back against the wall, spreading his legs out as he slumps lower on the chair.
Dean mumbles against his lips, and Castiel sucks in a breath, dragging his lips lower, down to Dean's collarbone, as he hum, and mumbles back a soft
Refreshing. Soothing. Necessary.

"Oh, Mr. Winchester—"
"Say, angel, you ever been fucked?"
The very voice that startled him in his thoughts not a moment ago speaks again, and Castiel clutches his hand tight around the book, not bothering to answer Dean as he resumes reading.
"Hello Dean," he mumbled, quick enough Dean would miss it were he not paying attention.
"No. Wanna' sleep."
"So," Green asks after a prolonged silence. "You got more ravioli left?"
, anything you
Dean pauses, and his gaze drifts over the mundane items in his room. His heart, however, races, his thoughts ablaze, questions popping up on every nook and cranny of his mind.
There's underlying desperation to the man's voice, one that curls something warm inside Castiel, and he lets his head fall against the wall.  "Maybe tomorrow afternoon? When I wake up?"
Dean's voice is sore, and his jaw locks as he takes a step forward.
For the first time in days, Castiel felt fear.
A surprised
Dean's eyes wander over the table, his bottom lip caught between his teeth as he tries to recollect his memories.
He bangs his fist against the wall he shares with Dean, eyes frigid as they fix onto a mundane part of the wall.
"Yeah."
Castiel grinned, and his eyes wandered over to Dean, whose face was soft, eyes fixed onto Castiel with such tenderness in his expressions, Castiel couldn't help but flush under his attention.
The man behind the wall. Someone he's never met before, someone he doesn't know, someone whose only identity is his voice—mand yet, there's something simmering between them, a certain pull that Castiel finds himself drawn by.
He shuts his eyes, and sucks in a deep breath.
Regret washes over him at once, punching him in the gut as the weight of his words settles between them.
"You better tell me about whoever you do end up with. And if he ain't into music, any kind, or if he's one of those dog people, drop him." Dean takes another swig of his beer as he hears Blue laugh louder, prompting a smile to pull at the corner of his lips.
Dean wants to turn. He really does.
while we engage in this, erm,
"...Right?" Dean asks, and it draws Castiel out of his reverie. He raises an eyebrow at Dean.
Dean moves into action without another thought, falling to his knees and holding Castiel close. His face is pale and smooth in a strange, content way Dean has never seen before, and yet, he continues to breathe softly when Dean holds his hand up to his face to check. The feel of Castiel's breath on his skin reassures him, and before he can do anything else, he throws his hands around Cas's back and pulls him into a hug.
"Let it be there for a while. I need you right now, Cas."
A rich, exuberant laugh follows on the other side, prompting Castiel to roll his eyes, a smile twitching at the corner of his lips.
"Thanks for the eggs, Dean, it smells really good."
.’" He let out a short, bitter laugh, remembering the words his father would say to him at times his attraction to men would show through, even after years of hiding it.
hurt, Dean." Castiel breathes out, a soft, lewd smirk lingering at the corner of his lips as he drags his foot down Dean's neck and presses it into Dean's chest.
Tears streamed down his face, one after the other, as he watched Dean, still dressed in a navy-blue suit and tie, with his hair messy and his eyes hungry, move closer to the bed. His broad, large alpha frame hovered over Castiel, who let his hands fall to his side, and squeezed his legs shut at once, head hung down in absolute shame and guilt.
"Usually I'd change, but I'm too tired, and I don't want to move anymore." As if to emphasize his point, he yawns again, and Dean smiles.
"This one's your black—
"God, such a slut for my finger, aren't you? I wish you could see what I'm seeing right now. It's gorgeous, Cas, gorgeous. If you'd'a told me you had such a pretty little hole before, and that it swallowed up my finger so
“Crap,” Green mutters, and Castiel laughs, continuing his sentence.
Castiel turned away, not sparing Dean a glance, because by avoiding Dean's eyes, he was sparing himself.
"Deeeaannn—"
"Yes," they say in tandem, and Rowena nods.
Heats were rare for Castiel, given how he'd been using suppressants for more than half of his life, ever since he'd started studying at a beta-dominated university. Although suppressants worked best for the time being, when it came to the long-term effects, they were devastating.
Castiel doesn't hesitate, simply walks over to stand in front of Dean, who slides his hands around his waist, hyper-aware of the sudden intimacy between them. God, if he doesn't touch Castiel right now, he might combust.
Dean has felt this before. The warm, cosy feeling of being in love, of having someone to talk to, someone who will, at times, simply listen. But he’s also felt the harrowing weight of heartbreak, knows what it does to a person. Part of him wants to grab this feeling of comfort, of love, and never let go, no matter where it takes him, but the other? The other part of him wants to shun away all and any feelings of love because he
A bold, black notification glares at him from the top bar, and he taps on it.
Somehow, his eyes darted towards the corner of the record store, and onto a thin, black stack of— ah, wonderful. Without another thought, he strode over to the shelf of cassette tapes, browsing through each one, considering them with deep thought. At last, his eyes fell upon a particular cassette, with bright, blue packaging, and he reached for it, only to find a hand snatch it away. Perplexed and confused, Castiel turned to the side, only to find—
“Why didn’t you tell me, Dean? It’s a simple question.”
Another breeze grazes Dean's face.
He drops a small string of spit over the prince's rim, massaging the saliva into his hole as Castiel cries out softly, his hole twitching and clenching around Dean's cock.
Castiel hears Dean walk away. He returns after a few seconds, and the sound of him settling against the wall echoes through.
wall.
Sam chuckles.
Oh, so wrong.
Dean mumbles, and Castiel smiles.
snow feels special. It feels as if it were falling only for them, for Dean and Castiel, floating through the air and landing on the ground for no one
"Oh," Castiel gulps, evidently caught off-guard by the sensitive admission made by Green. Not wanting to prolong the silence between them, Castiel asks, "What did you play for her?"
The word is a plea, and Castiel shuts his eyes, letting his head fall against the wall as he digs his nails into the plaster.
"Naw, was just lost in some memories.”
"Of course. Practice over the weekend, yes?"
It was 600 dollars after Castiel had bargained with the record store owner.
"So, you are one of those people."
, which loosely translates to the 'kiss of death'."
"Take me there."
“If?” Dean’s voice, barely audible, floats through the wall, and tugs at an odd warmth inside Castiel, one that scares him, has him knitting his eyebrows together, has him worried, hesitant in ways he’s never found himself to be.
"It's erm, it's not much."
Castiel couldn't answer.
He cracks an eye open, and in his lap, a tranquil grey book.:
"Go back where, baby?"
Dean was
Right as he's walking out the door, his eyes fall upon a slip of paper, a flyer of sorts, and a fun idea pops up in his mind.
"Well, the second greatest, I guess," Dean added as if on second thought, as he laid a few dollar bills on the glass counter, and Castiel turned to him once again with confusion on his face.
"Is it like a
At once, Castiel's eyes snapped up, as if to watch out for something, and he trailed his eyes over each corridor, wondering which room he might find a piano in. Part of him wanted to check each room, study the inside of each one, see if he could find any semblance of life in any of the rooms, perhaps even a photograph, or maybe, simply a scratch of a nail on a desk— anything to convince him there once existed joy and laughter in the manor. Anything. He walked towards the staircase, deciding to rewrite the notes into his own notebook.
"What," he begins, once he can form a string of coherent words, although he doesn't know how long he's been silent for. Seconds. Minutes. Hours, "-what makes you think I don't love you?"
"I don't understand,” Blue asks and Dean allows himself the time to pop a few more peanuts in his mouth. “-Is that supposed to be funny? It sounds quite hurtful." With an indignant hum, Dean continues.
"We're just—" Castiel starts, but is cut off by Dean who grins at him.
A pause.
"Must be a peg, I'll tune it."
"Well, not really—" he starts, but Blue cuts him off again.
"I am. I live a few blocks away."
Tears sting Dean's eyes, and all he can do is gulp.
"That so? Whatcha' thinkin'?"
"It's wordplay. For catch up."
Twenty minutes later finds them jammed into the side of a booth in a bustling diner at ten-fifteen in the morning, and Castiel can barely hear himself over the chatter in the diner. There's the scent of various different spices, most prominently oil and meat, and with how hungry Castiel is, the scent only causes another rumble to shake his stomach. The diner is wide and spacious, white tiles on the floor, and a bright red paint on the walls, with weird, rock band murals. No wonder Dean likes this place.
"–yes, Dean. We saw it. All three of us. It hit Dean square in the chest."
Mr. Kreschner nods, before his eyes twinkle with realization.
"Well then," Castiel laughs softly, "-I guess I'd just have to raise you from perdition again."
"Perfect. You're perfect," Dean smiled, and Castiel preened at Dean's praise. A moment later, the hilt of the blade came to a searing halt inside Castiel's ass, just a few seconds short of Castiel's orgasm, and Castiel whined out in protest, before the ropes on his arms and legs seemed to vanish, and he fell to the ground with a painful clamour. The Blade slipped out of his hole, and the rim of it burned with an extremely excruciating burn.
"Oh, Dean. This is exactly why I'll miss you."
Dean had wanted it for months, but Mary had deemed it too expensive.
The demon trudged over to where Castiel had been suspended with the ropes, and smiled with a satisfied hum.
"That way, he'll think I'm a bad person, and he won't like me anymore. That way I can stay without any guilt of having left him heartbroken."
Castiel still doesn't know how to handle the fact that Dean will be leaving in a month, but the prospect of him leaving in a week? Castiel can't even begin to imagine what he'd feel, much less do. Part of him hopes Dean will laugh at the prospect, telling Castiel he's being paranoid, and that Kreschner must have read the dates wrong. Part of him worries about the possibility of Dean accepting the accusation.
It was true. Castiel had asked Mary to give Dean his gift, but she had insisted on Castiel to give it himself. But he would never be able to tell her the reason he didn't want to face Dean.
"Man, you don't know how good it feels to hear that," the man says, prompting Castiel to laugh, and the sound is loud enough to drift across.
"It’s settled then. I'll just call you Blue."
"It's easier to say, Cas," Dean starts, and Castiel sighs.
And then, in reply to this, a deep, sleep-soaked baritone voice will rise up.
"How do you always...?"
"Fuck," Castiel panted, rocking back on Dean's fingers, meeting Dean's thrusts in-sync, his knuckles white from holding onto the edge of the countertop. Dean slid his own hands into Castiel's, while the other slid forward to wrap around Castiel's cock, pumping in lousy strokes at first, increasing his pace when he felt Castiel clench his ass on Dean's tongue. Dean pulled away, licking his lips to swallow down every last taste of Castiel, before pushing a second finger inside Castiel's wet, sloppy hole, thrusting them in to his knuckles, until the cold metal of Dean's rings rubbed against Castiel's pucker and he gasped.
by Mary Oliver.
. He folds the paper in half and holds it in his hand as he walks out and shuts the door behind him. With his heart in his throat, for although he knows Green and has been talking to him for quite a while now, they haven't quite delved into the
With a deep breath, Dean presses the tip into Castiel's hole, watching as it finally breaches the rim, prompting the prince to cry out in pleasure. Inch by inch, Dean pushes it in— no, rather, Castiel's hole swallows him inside, deeper and deeper, until their bodies touch each other's, and at last, Dean is buried inside to the hilt.
"Then there's nothing you can do, Dean."
Still a bit disoriented by the sudden onslaught of emotions, Castiel hums with a jerky nod and moves as Dean steps out, beaming at him when Dean drops a soft kiss onto Castiel's hair.
his skin, and he needed nothing more than to claw the fabric off his body and fall into the decadence of his plush, soft white bed. The cocktail that evening, organised by the lovely head of the Board of Directors, a fancy, elegant middle-aged Scottish woman, one of Dean's seniors, had been a cause of celebration for the entirety of the company. Sandover and Inc. was an up-coming name in the world of stock-markets and investments, and as VP of the company, Dean had loads of work. Of course, his salary and bonus made up
It's about ten minutes until the clock strikes four-thirty on the dot. With a content sigh, Castiel steps away, walking over to the large window spanning the outer wall of his apartment, eyes wandering over the stillness before him.
"If you don't do this, Dean," Sam begins, his voice dropping to a whisper, "-Cas is going to die. Can we really afford to lose him again? Can
It's more of a complaint than a question, and Castiel's voice is wet, soaked with emotion as he speaks. Dean only rubs his waist in answer.
"Cas, watch out—"
"Dean?" he calls out, hesitant, hoping he isn't disturbing Dean.
Castiel laughs, and Mr. Kreschner continues, "You back from work?"
"Don't take it off, it's cold out here."
"Yes."
"Cas. Be honest with me. How much did it cost?" Dean asked, anger seeping into his voice, and Castiel stepped back, slightly afraid of Dean's reaction.
"The spell lasts only for a week, Samuel. It wore off this morning. What Castiel was facing was simply the aftereffects of it," her eyes wander over to the direction of the passageway, which echoes with the sound of a bed creaking and a string of loud, hoarse moans, "-let them have at it for a while. Lord knows they need it."
when I think of you leaving.”
Around ten o'clock in the evening, when Castiel is on his fifth episode of a podcast about a truck driver trying to find her missing wife through a series of clues, and has downed one full bowl of fettuccine alfredo, he steps into his light blue scrubs. He begins to pack his backpack when a knock on the door— no, the wall— startles him.
He remembers the tears at the rim of his eyes, the tremble of his lips, the quiver in his voice as he’d consoled Dean,
The scent of warm sandy oceans, of clear skies, of autumn and pie, of
Dean hummed and chuckled around Castiel's nipple, pushing his tongue flat against the nub before licking a thick, fat strip down the pinkened flesh. Castiel's cock grew heavier, and his toes curled as Dean crept an arm up towards the other nipple, rolling the nub between his thumb and his finger, pulling it and pinching it, stretching it away from Castiel's skin, sending a wave of arousal and pleasure crashing through Castiel's body, drenching his nerves in pure ecstacy— ecstacy Castiel knew was forbidden.
He knows now, where the string has been twanging, so if the pegs have been tuned right, the melody should flow with seamlessness and grace. Castiel hitches a breath as he nears the chorus. Something inside him wants this to be right, wants this to be fulfilling, and if it goes wrong, he's going to have to look deeper into it.
Not until they've walked a few steps further, does Dean speak up. "Are you still mad at me?"
“I’m sorry Sammy, I know how hard it must be… about Eileen.” he said trying to shift the focus from his sob story to Sam’s. He’ll admit it was a bid of a dick move to bring up Elieen to run away from talking about his feelings, but it was also a Dean move.
“Yeah, sure. See you in 10!” Dean replied waving goodbye for now.
“Now stop apologizing it was my pleasure but Dean did most of the work. Don’t tell him I told you this but he’s always loved cooking.” she said with a fond smile.“I heard that.” said a low voice that could only be Dean’s. Cas turned around to face the man and once again he was awestruck at how handsome his man was. The sun was hitting his face just right and his eyes were greener than the night before.
“Check this out, it says here that in the late eighteenth century witches were cursing each other a lot; so one of them developed a spell to separate supernatural entities if they were merged together. Do you think it will work?” Jack said carrying a book to where Dean was looking through books in the library. They all gathered around the table Jack was at to read what they needed. Sam searched through the thing Rowena had left him after she died and they found the spell they needed, damn that woman had everything. They would have to thank her after this was all over.
“Dean, is this your car? She’s beautiful!” Cas exclaimed in wonder, Dean blushed
After a bit of prep work and painting the sigil on the ground: the small group was gathered around said sigil while Sam recited the incantation. Nothing seemed to happen, not black goo appeared, no lights flickered, zip, zilch, nada. Then suddenly there it was in front of them, still in Meg’s form. It appeared to have warmed up to her look.
“Um, guys, you might want to see this!” they heard jack say from the war room. The boys exchanged confused looks then booked it out of the kitchen, well Sam did. Dean had to turn off the stove; they wouldn’t want to add a burned down bunker to their list of problems. When he caught up with Sam and Jack he saw what Jack meant. There in front of them stood, Micheal... or Adam, well both of them.
Dean let go of his surrogate son’s shoulders, seeing that Jack was being sincere. He nodded stiffly and turned his attention to Sam who looked on the verge of exploding with confusion,
“He doesn’t but darkness and empty are pretty similar so I was able to reach you. “ she said
This chapter is a little sad, in my opinion, but nothing too bad, I promise.
“Jody, are you okay?” he asked with a smile
“Well, I just finished so what if I give the kiddos some dinner and you and Cas get some for yourselves There’s a 24-hour diner and the road was just plowed.” she suggested
He finished ringing him up and handed Cas the key. Dread filled Cas as he realized that he would have to go back into the biting cold to get the bags. He thanked Dean and turned to Jack. “Hey buddy, I need you to wait here, while I go get the bags from the car.” he told his son
Medic67 10:10 PM <<
Castiel doesn’t think it’s worth pointing out that Jody
Castiel rolls his eyes and sighs, dropping his pen in resignation. He wonders briefly how Pam got past his receptionist, but receives an answer to his own question when Tessa—a fierce but friendly brunette—stands in the doorway looking upset.
Castiel listens to his brother’s excited ramblings for another twenty minutes before finally shaking his hand and heading home, tucking Dean’s slice of pie into the passenger seat beside him, some of his melancholy fading at the thought of seeing his good boy again soon.
Dean lifts his head, his eyes shiny and unfocused. He moves stiffly to the table, pauses momentarily to decide where to sit. To Castiel’s surprise, he kneels on the floor in front of Castiel and begins unbuttoning his shirt.
“I do, yes. Most of my meetings are conference calls, so if you could look at that to-do list Missouri left over here…” Castiel leans over him and points out a to-do bar on the side of his calendar. “Then I have an in-person consultation meeting with Mr. Adler around lunch. I’d like it if you can sit in and take notes for me.”
“Maybe it’s time for a grand gesture. That’s what the supporting role always says in a rom-com, anyways. Right?” She grins, then checks her watch and the casual expression fades. She stands up and stretches. “Time to go. Can’t believe I have boot camp tomorrow…after a night shift, and after eating three slices of pizza. Jeez. Mark both of those down in the ‘bad idea’ column.”
The man moans loudly and without shame, and Castiel is pleased but not altogether shocked that the man appreciates the idea of being claimed. “Is that want you want? A collar so you know who you belong to, so I can hook you up to a leash as you suck my cock?”
“Not yet,” Dean begs softly, gripping Castiel tightly. “Just…just hold me like this. Please?”
Pity spread plainly across Sam’s face makes Dean sick with shame. He forces a fake smile on his face and claps a hand on Sam’s shoulder. “I’m fine, alright? Plus, I’m seeing about a job today.”
“I decided to get a bit creative. This is a leather cinch strap I just bought. Would you like to help me break it in a bit?” Castiel gives him a devilish smirk.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” Castiel asks, flabbergasted. “No, Dean, absolutely not.” His eyes revert momentarily back to his brother, who gives him a slight frown. “Gabriel is right, unfortunately, but not because I don’t trust him. I suppose, after everything Lucifer has done to us, I’m just…”
“Gabbing with your secret bestie?” Gabriel asks cheerily, and Kali wrinkles her nose in confusion, so he explains, “Cassie’s had a catfish situation going on for like,
“Not,” Castiel says, hoping his voice doesn’t sound too sharp. He needs to sound bored, despondent—not as angry or wrathful as he truly feels.
Castiel closes his eyes, transported momentarily to happier, easier days. “Divine.”
“Always knew you were a show off.” Benny gives a warm laugh and slap on his shoulder. “I’m happy for you, Dean. Call me soon and we can shoot some pool or something, it’s been too long.”
“Thank you. “Dean said simply and sincerely
“Oh, okay well I’m glad that I coul-we could provide a little help. Well um, I think that’s all of it.” Dean said reaching up to close the trunk of the car.
“Alright that settles it see you in a while Dean, Cas, Jack enjoy the breakfast. I’ll see you all later!” she said before waving and heading out of the dining area. They all got a plate of breakfast and sat down at a table for three by the window.
“Okay, now that we’re all acquainted. Let’s get to work on getting Chuck to show so we can get Amara on our side.” Dean said
Sam and Dean chuckled in response” Adam, everything in here is unsettlingly convenient; that’s kinda the whole point of this bunker. We have almost everything we need to deal with the supernatural.” Sam teased.
He was brought out of his thoughts when the man answered “Right, I’m Castiel but, everyone calls me Cas.” Cas somehow that fit him, any other name Dean could have guessed would not have lived up to that. They made their way back inside and they got some news from Jody about the weather. So, the storm would take a while and Cas and Jack were here indefinitely. Sure he probably should be upset that they won’t make it to their destination for the holidays but they seemed okay with the situation so why shouldn’t he be? Cas tried to take the bags from him and lug them to the room himself but Dean wasn’t about to let that happen and miss an opportunity to find out more about Cas. Dean walked next to Jack and Cas on their way to their room making small talk with Cas along the way. Finally they reached the door, Cas went to tuck his son into bed and Dean set the bags down by the door. Cas walked up to him to say thank you for the help. At least he had finally stopped apologizing for everything. Dean knew this was his shot to throw in a little flirtation. He tried to be suave but instead, he used the cheesiest pick-up line known to man. Really pretty blue eyes, that’s the best he could do. He didn’t have time to correct himself or even guage Cas’s reaction before he was walking briskly back to the lobby. How much more elementary could he get, basic lines and then running away what was he a middle schooler. He was pulled out of his thoughts when he saw Jody waiting for him looking extremely amused.
The next morning, Dean walked into the bunker’s kitchen and began to make breakfast. The rhythm of cooking always relaxed him, not that he could relax in this situation, but he had to try to keep a level head. Sam walked in and mumbled a ‘good morning’ in Dean’s direction and sat down at the table. Dean nodded in Sam’s direction and went back to the eggs in his pan. His mind drifted back to the events of the day before. “ I love you “ those three simple little words that he never thought he would hear, especially from Cas. Tears began to well up in his eyes but he wiped them quickly he couldn’t focus on that, not now.
“You know I’m adorable when I’m grumpy.” Dean retorted
“Hey, um Jack, is it what if I go with your dad and you wait here with my friend Jody. That way you are taken care of and your dad is safe. Does that sound good to you?” asked Dean walking up to Cas’s side. Jack looked up, he was clearly thinking this over.
“We’ll be here.” he said with a smile and hung up.
Dean was torn of course he wanted to have breakfast with Cas and Jack but what if he was just hurting himself by enabling his little crush. He was about to decline but then he looked at Cas; blue eyes full of hope and he looked at Jack eagerly awaiting his response, his heart melted and so he gave in. Of course, he gave in.
The second part of the dinner date Dean and Cas had.
“She gets that from you, you know.” Cas teased
It was about half-way through the movie when Dean felt a warm weight on his shoulder. He glanced down without moving his head, not wanting to disturb Cas. He felt a flutter in his chest when he saw that the other man had laid his head on Dean’s shoulder. Dean couldn’t help but feel pride and like the luckiest guy in the world. God, what was this guy doing to him? It had only been a couple of days since they’d met, but Dean was already head over heels. At first, the thought that he should deny that he was falling for Cas. Not because he was ashamed or anything, Dean had been an out and proud bisexual man since his teens when Jody took him and his brother in when their Dad left them. It was because he didn't think that being in love could be so easy. He was no stranger to love but it was always gradual. With Cas, it hit him like a freight train, and it was so simple. Then he had to remind himself that he didn’t know how Cas felt. They almost kissed earlier but nothing had happened since then. Maybe Cas was trying to pretend it didn’t happen. He was snapped out of his thoughts when he heard Jody call for Claire.
Dean looked through box after box of magic crap that Rowena tried to sort before she bit it. There was nothing helpful in the twenty boxes he had searched and oh look at that there was nothing in the twenty-first either.
“Hey boys, did you have fun?” she asked
“Okay, well I’m not one for speeches, so uh, good luck and all that. See you on the other side guys.” Dean said they all nodded and went to their places.
The two men sat in comfortable silence while they looked over the options for dinner. Cas was unsure what to get until he spotted the burger section. He always liked burgers and it was difficult to mess those up. He set down the menu just as Donna walked up with their drinks.
“Well, thank you both for the breakfast it looks wonderful. Hey since you went through the trouble would you guys like to join us?” Cas asked the pair in front of him
“Castiel.” Micheal clarified with a sigh
“I’m game if you are,” he said looking almost hopeful, although that could just be Dean letting fantasy mix with reality.
After a couple of minutes of silence, Micheal piped up and tuned towards Dean. “Did you say Amara was back earlier?” He asked.
Micheal and Gabriel struck him as did Amara. He flinched but his smile didn’t fall, not even when Jack struck him with all his power.
“No, not yet.” Dean answered
“How are we back here?” Dean asked her
“Hey, Jody, I have a customer whose son needs to be looked after for a couple of minutes while I help him get some stuff out of their car. Could you help with that?” he said as he entered Jody’s office.
Cas felt horrible, he had only met this man and he was already dragging him out into the cold to appease his seven-year-old. Dean came back with a coat and a woman who looked a bit older than him. She had the kindest smile on her face and looked more than happy to look after Jack for a couple of minutes, he still felt bad.
“I am going to get him back.” the older Winchester promised. Micheal saw the intent and nodded his head.
“Jack, you were able to wake Cas up in the empty before right? “ Sam questioned. “You think you could do it again?” he added.
“Yeah, what happened one second we were on high alert, and the next we were somewhere else and then we were back. Is everything over? Did you beat God?” she asked one question after another
“How about staying alive?” Jack asked, the kid was upset and angry.
“Really Cas, I thought you were on my side!” Dean said playfully offended with a hand on his chest
There was a sudden burst of cold air that hit Dean as soon as he stepped foot outside, he wasn’t that phased though, growing up in Sioux Falls meant he was used to the cold. He soon realized that Cas was not the same. He glanced over at the man beside him standing there shivering despite wearing what looked like three layers of clothes. Dean and Cas made their way over to a bench that was under a roof and therefore was free of snow, they sat down and kept an eye on the kids. Dean could see that Cas was worried about Jack, those blue eyes were fixed on his location at all times.
“Now, hold on Dean didn’t get him killed.” Sam defended “Cas nobly sacrificed himself for-”
“Get what?” Dean said dumbfounded
“Yeah, best worker my ass. Go ahead, but just so you know compared to two seven-year-olds, records are easier.” She chuckled out
“Yes, I heard but I thought Dean said he tried and couldn’t?” she said with a confused look on her face.
“Of course you do, it’s your move. What I’m not hearing is why I would agree to anything you proposed.” it said with a smirk.
“It’s alright, plus you’re not too bad yourself,” Cas answered with a gummy smile
“I’m sure you remember that I’m more powerful than my brother; I used my strength to get us back here and put up that warding I broke last time, he can’t get to us unless I drop it and I won’t let that happen.” she said rubbing her temples, she was clearly drained “So what’s your plan?”
“Alright, well let’s get mixing the potion and takedown daddy-o!” said Gabriel
“I didn’t know you thought of Cas as family at all, I thought you said he was a rank and file angel? Dean retorted a bit defensively
“Okay, Mr. adventurer it’s time for you to go to bed.” Cas said reaching out for his son’s hand. Jack took it and they headed to their room. He reached for Dean to give him the other bags. “Oh, no I’ll help you get the bags to the room, It’s  no trouble so don’t apologize.” Dean insisted
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Cross my heart.” Dean chuckled
“Of course, no problem, now go on an get your bags.” she said kindly
“I’ll have a bacon cheeseburger with french fries,  please.” he answered. He looked over at Dean who looked at him in awe.
“Here it is, if you need anything we’ll be in the library. I know you’re doing this for you and all but I want to say...thank you and I’m sorry. We shouldn’t have lied to you.” Dean said, Amara nodded and he turned to walk away.
“Well I should get going, I’d hate myself if I fall asleep in my office again.” Dean said turning to leave
“I’ll never get tired of hearing it, I love you too, Dean. Not that I don’t want to stay here with you but is Jack here? Sam?” Cas asked him
“No problem, look I’m at a disadvantage you know my name but I don’t know yours.” Dean said expectantly
“ About as well as you.” his brother retorted.
Dean sits on the cold floor of the bunker’s storage room attempting to process everything that just happened. Cas’s last words to him echo in his mind: “I love you.” “Goodbye, Dean.” A perpetual pang of hurt envelops his chest as he hears the faint buzz of his phone next to him. He slowly picks it; through blurry vision, probably caused by the tears quickly forming in his eyes, he sees the screen lit up with Sam’s name. He knows he should answer, after all, that has happened around them so far, Sam might get worried if Dean doesn’t answer him; but he can’t. So he tosses his phone on the ground and buries his head in his hands as the buzzing stops. He tries to move, knows that he has to move but he can’t. His whole body feels heavy and tired; so he just sits there. The only noises he produces are the faint sobs that are pouring out of him along with the hot, salty tears that have begun to run down his face. That’s how Jack and Sam find him when they get back to the bunker: sitting alone on the floor, in shock.
Gabriel took it and said, “Huh, alright, Gabriel nice to meet ya.” he said shaking the other man’s hand.
“Cas, Jack this is Claire: Jody’s daughter.” Dean introduced calming Cas down and preserving his hope that he might have a chance.
That night Dean dreamed of the night he and Cas met and how their friendship has grown. Those dreams soon turned into nightmares as he was forced to rewatch Cas be taken over and over again until he woke up in a cold sweat, he glanced at the clock, well four hours would have to do.
“Yeah, you said that you thought having her back would put out the fire in me.” he answered
“Come on Dean, I know how it feels to lose the love of your life. I know how you feel.” Sam answered knowingly.
“Okay whoa, just because the world is probably ending doesn’t mean the no chick-flick moments rule is abolished.” Dean said trying to laugh and lighten the mood, the effort was futile
“Yes, we did the food was wonderful and so was the company, thank you for taking Jack for a bit Jody, I hope he didn’t give you trouble.” Cas answered
Flashbacks encompassed his mind and he swallowed before answering “ He um, he’s dead. The Empty took him, I tried to get him back but The Empty wouldn’t play ball.” tears threatened to fill his eyes as he choked out the last word.
“Don’t worry I’m just teasing, and no I’m not a car guy per se, but I can recognize a nice vehicle when I see one.” Cas said breaking into a grin all seriousness leaving his features. Dean relaxed as the tension melted away.
“Would you? Oh, thanks.” Cas said handing the sleeping seven-year-old to Dean who didn’t stir or flinch at the handoff, he must have been tired.
They all went to the library, they were on a mission. They had a plan and they were going to make this work, they would make sure of it. Dean would make sure of it.
“Go get her Sammy.” Dean interrupted
“Cas is...gone” Dean almost couldn’t get the words out, he didn’t want to say it,  saying it would make it real.
“We get to stay at a motel tonight!” he shouted excitedly his eyes becoming saucers
“Yeah, she is, isn't she? Fixed her up when I was 16, didn’t take you for a car guy, Cas. “ Dean commented. Cas’s eyes narrowed for a second and his head shot up.
“This wasn’t well thought out but lucky for you nothing in my life was really well thought out; I think I have a way to fix our one archangel problem.”
Jack looked between Sam and Dean wiping the tears quickly forming in his eyes. “What now?” he asked. If the brothers were honest they didn’t know where to go from there, what could they do? They were alone, at least it seemed that way.
“Hey, baby bro! “ added Gabriel not trying to hide the emotion in his voice.
Dean and Cas walked into the lounge and saw that Jack and Claire were indeed asleep. Cas walked up to Jack and lifted him up not wanting to wake the tired kid. Jody came in and did the same with Claire letting Dean know she was gonna head home and put her to bed. They said their goodbyes and Dean walked Cas back to his room. When they go to the room Cas fumbled to get his room key.
And while you’re at it, tell me how to keep Sam safe, how to lie to his face and say everything is going to be okay when everything is so fucking far from okay. Tell me please, ‘cause I feel like I’m bursting at the goddamn seams to try and understand. Tell me, just tell me, Cas, please—”

“I’m coming in, little brother.” Dean opens the door as a smell hits him. It takes a moment for him to recognize it. It’s not a smell he’s encountered often, except with himself, but there is no mistaking it.
Medic67 12:14 AM <<
CB: Yeah TCBaby?
“You’re shitting me?” Sam scoffs and shakes his head. “No fucking way…that’s amazing!”
one… As more than just friends, y’know? Have you ever been—”
“You good, boss?” Ellie calls, peeking into the office.
Dean laughs, the sound of joy personified. “Yeah, Cas. That’s a ‘hell yeah.’”
“Take a good look,” Dean says stiffly, “‘cause that’s all you’re ever gonna get.”
“This was a team effort. Besides, we couldn’t have done any of this without you, Becky,” he says, putting a hand on her shoulder. “Thank you for having the courage to speak up. I’m only sorry I didn’t see this sooner.”
Dean looks like he can’t believe his luck. “Anything?”
“Oldest story there is, unrequited love. Only, I don’t think it’s as one-sided as you think.” Benny smirks and tips his head a little. Dean turns and sees Castiel standing by the theater door watching him, blue eyes narrowed and focused.
a ninety-three percent match?” Castiel’s voice breaks. He knows Becky already told him Marv switched his score with Cain’s, but to hear it confirmed by Charlie herself…
“Hey,” Dean breathes, and Castiel scoots up closer, their foreheads on the verge of touching. “Listen to me, okay? That wasn’t your fault. The whole thing was beyond shitty, and I’m not gonna tell you you’ll get over it one day, because hell if I ever would. But you can’t carry all that guilt around. Jimmy made his own decision—it had nothing to do with you.”
Hello All!
But that’s Castiel the dom talking—not Dr. Novak, the well-respected psychiatrist. So he listens to Dean stress about the mound of responsibilities and expectations piled on him by his family, listens to Dean discuss how his only outlet is sex but even that hasn’t worked lately, listens to all the failed exercises and discussions of boundaries Dean shoots down again and again.
“Roman bit Dean,” he growls thunderously. “He—handcuffed him to a table in the police station. He forced himself on Dean. He violated him! What if…” The words
Castiel straddles Dean’s lap, reaching for the pointer finger on his right hand and lathering it in lube. “Why don’t you put your finger here—” He parts his cheeks, and feels the pressure of Dean’s finger sliding against his crack. “—and find out.”
“Holy fuck!” Dean looks at them and tries to make sense of what he’s seeing.
, coming right on command—shooting all over his stomach and chest. It feels glorious and Dean floats for a moment on his high before focusing back on the Dom between his legs.
“I love you, omega. Stay strong for me.”
When Gabriel picks up on the second ring, the only way through is forward.
“You came here on the behalf of a politician?” Castiel asks incredulously, fighting back a laugh. “I’m a businessman, an investor. You know I don’t involve myself in politics.”
Dean nearly trips over himself in his haste to get into the house, ignoring the chuckles behind his back. He hurries out of his boots and up the stairs, body vibrating in anticipation. He barely feels the twinge in his calf as he makes it to the bathroom and turns the water on to start heating up. It feels good to strip off the sweaty clothes from his skin. It reminds him a bit of being in the desert, long days patrolling on foot in heavy gear. He’d always been desperate to wash the sand and sweat away.
“Is this the online guy, or the dude you keep sneaking off to see?” Sam smirks, flopping down in a chair at the kitchen table.
He sighs, rubbing a hand over his forehead. He thought the day they officially absolved their white-collar contract would be the happiest of his life. He’s relieved, surely, especially since Dean will not only own his own contract now, but Sam’s. Still, he never imagined a future where Dean’s contract being null would still leave them parted.
“Hey, boss,” Charlie says with a grin, hand fluffing her bangs absently. “So, you gonna introduce the new kid?”
Castiel, for all his years of domming, can’t find the strength to chastise his sub for calling him by his first name now. He simply kisses him again, slipping his tongue into Dean’s mouth, before finally coming up for air and whispering, “Good boy.”
Castiel laughs, the memories hazy but the feelings all the same. “First Balthazar, now Inias?” Dean blushes a pretty shade of pink, and Castiel kisses his cheek. “Were you jealous of every gay guy we knew in high school?”
“Wretched horse,” Ruby squawks with an angry scowl on her face. “He broke my arm!”
Dean’s mind stops whirling and he feels his heart thump in his chest. He’d hoped this might happen, even prepared a little for it, feeling all too aware of the silk slide under his jeans. He’d checked up on Castiel too, talked with Meg and few others in the community. He was a good dom, practiced safe play. Dean looks at the cool, blue eyes watching him, waiting to see what he does. He knows he can walk away at any time but he also thinks this man could deconstruct him just the way he needs.

“Rowena left a bit ago, said she needed to run back to her office. Ellen and Jo had to go open the Roadhouse, but they said they’d be by to visit you soon,” Bobby replies.
Whatever happens next will be completely up to Cas.
Hannah 12:15 PM <<
“I can smell the sweet heat on you. Absolutely delicious,” Azazel whispers in his ear. Dean clamps his mouth shut so tight his teeth grind.
“Nothing, it’s just…” There are tears in the corners of his eyes, likely from the intensity of his orgasm, and the man brushes them aside and exhales with a smile. “You went through that whole process of cleaning me up, and now I’m dirty again.”
“Anytime, son,” Bobby says, his eyes firm when he adds, “I mean it. You’re family now, so don’t be a stranger.”
"Really? A Titanic reference?" Dean snorted.
Castiel flips through the beaten up National Geographic on the side table. He just skims the pictures, unable to absorb any of the content as he waits for Dean. He did much of his own research into this form of treatment. Most of what he gathered is that the first few sessions could be extremely taxing, to say the least. He tries not to let the worry seep in, knowing it won’t help Dean to have Castiel stressed as well. Still, it tears at him knowing Dean is on the other side of that door reliving his most traumatic moments and Cas isn’t in there.
*shoots off confetti*
Castiel is sitting in the middle of the love seat now, his legs spread obscenely wide with a pillow on the floor in front of him.  He extends out a hand to him. “Come here, Dean.”
April turns around in the door, hair messy and wild. She looks thoroughly ruffled and sex-worn, her skin slightly sweaty, her makeup smudged. Castiel’s almost embarrassed that she’ll be seen by his staff in such a fashion.
“I agree with Sam, what about you Dean, would you be willing to work with The Empty, I mean it did take Cas away.” Jack asked concern overtaking his smile.
“Yeah, I guess you’re right.” Adam responded nodding.
“What?” Dean responded hazily, looking back at Sam
“Weren’t you listening, she was CONSUMED by Chuck!” He chuckled out
Later that night, after Sam and Elieen picked up Kevin, Dean, Cas, and Charlie sat on their couch with their dog, miracle, sitting at their feet. Charlie had begun to fall asleep between her dads while watching Scooby-Doo. Cas had also begun to nod off with his head on Dean’s shoulder; all Dean could think was ‘man I am the luckiest man in the universe’. As the credits of the episode rolled, Dean nudged his husband awake.
“Oh, hey buddy, hate to break it to you all but Jack here doesn’t have his powers. I mean I don’t know how he is still alive but he’s definitely too weak to hurt me. “ Chuck taunted
“Hey, Cas?” Dean started
“Dad are you coming back to watch the movie?” shouted a small voice
Dean begrudgingly followed his brother to the kitchen.”What, Sam? You heard it, we’re not getting Cas back!” “ I hear you, man but this is all we got. Once we defeat Chuck, we can work on a way to get Cas back, but if we can get Gabriel; we would only need to convince Amara.” Sam retorted calmly. “Oh, is that all?! Come on, Sam!” Dean added. “Dean, please. I promise we will get him back but we need to do this!” Sam pleaded
“Oh, Jody I’m so sorry you had to go through the trouble for just the two of us!” Cas apologized
“If it’s that dangerous, why would you go out there alone, you could get hurt, “ Jack retorted
That last sentence sent another pang of hurt into Dean’s chest. The thought that Cas was so sure he couldn’t be happy was the worst thing that he could imagine. Hell, he didn’t have to imagine it, he knew how it felt but he hated Cas going through that.
The mark glowed on Amara’s shoulder and just like that Chuck was gone in a flash of light. The group looked around as Sam and Dean came out from where they were hiding. They all let go a breath they didn’t know they were holding.
“Oh, I see how it is! well- hey Jack?” Dean asked
First off Happy Thanksgiving! I hope it was a good day and if it wasn't I hope tomorrow is better.
That night Dean lied awake for hours filled with excitement about seeing Cas and Jack the next day. He had resigned himself to insanity for being excited to see a guy he had just met. Realizing it was crazy didn’t stop the butterflies in his stomach one bit though. Dean was so screwed.
“Yeah, it’s over, it’s alright.” he said
After a couple of hours of preparing, they were ready to take down the warding. Their plan was set and they were gearing up to fight God. Amara would drop the warding Jack, Micheal and Gabriel would weaken him, Dean would crush the sphere, Sam would keep the warding to trap Chuck up and Amara would slam the door to the cage. Then boom, no more capricious God.
They headed back to the lobby where they met up with the guy and Jack. Dean grabbed his coat before following the stranger outside. He realized that he should probably ask him his name when he got the chance. It was colder outside than Dean anticipated he wasn’t too cold though, this guy had him blushing so much it kept him warm. Dean asked him why he was at the inn and was pleased when this guy didn’t mention anything about a spouse or partner. What sue Dean for having hope. Soon they had gotten all of the bags out of the car, and Dean said “No problem, look I’m at a disadvantage you know my name but I don’t know yours.” his heart raced with every word, it was like any possible name for a person left his brain.
“So what I’m hearing is, you got my brother killed?” Micheal stated matter-of-factly
“Dean, what’s wrong man? Where’s Cas?” Sam asks sprinting to Dean with Jack following him.
“I will give you Gabriel but Castiel is mine. He made a deal fair and square. Plus I heard your plan, he is not necessary. Those are my terms, take it, or leave it.” The Empty countered
“Yeah! Of course Jack those socks are amazing!” Dean responded sending a smile in Cas’s direction. He seemed genuinely excited not like those adults who pretend to think what a child is showing them is interesting, he was sincere. That just pulled at Cas’s heartstrings more.
“Are you ready, Amara?” Sam asked
Cas was at the table sending his parents an update on the situation they were in; he hit send and looked up to see Dean giving Jack a probably unhealthy amount of bacon. He wanted to be mad but he couldn’t; seeing the smile Dean was putting on his son’s face was heartwarming. For a second he let himself hope that this was a possibility for him. He had to admit the idea of Dean waking up and getting excited to make him and Jack breakfast made his heartache in a good way. He snapped out of it when he saw the pair walking over to the table.
“Look Mike-” “Actually it’s me, Adam, Micheal checked out when you realized that this plan was shit.” Adam corrected
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Dean asked hoping he could fool his little brother into believing he was fine.
“Hello, front desk how may I help you?” she asked
“I can’t reach the top to put the eyes on steve!” Jack said Cas still didn’t know why he insisted on calling the snowman Steve of all things.
“Yeah, but maybe with Micheal here you would both have enough juice to pull him out?” Sam offered
They sat down, ate breakfast, and just talked until they had finished. Just as they were picking up the trash leftover, in came a young blonde girl about Jack’s age. She immediately sprinted into Dean’s arms. All Cas could think was ‘oh god, does he have a daughter, he probably does and that is why he is so good with Jack. If he has a kid does that mea-’.
“Oh, no we couldn’t leave you with them! You’ll be outnumbered” Cas said politely, Dean was a bit disappointed that Cas had denied the offer. Jody must have sensed his feelings because she said:
“I feel the same way Dean, I thought I was crazy or moving too fast.” he said with a smile, Dean smiled right back at him
“Well um, goodnight, thank you again I don’t know what I would have done if it wasn’t for you and Jody.” Cas told the man standing opposite him
“Please, he was great. He and Claire are watching a movie in the lounge, but I’m pretty sure both of them are asleep.” she chuckled
“Of course, anything to make your stay easier, plus I’m a sucker for pretty blue eyes.” Dean said with a smile before heading back to the lobby leaving Cas standing there in shock. Had he imagined it or had Dean just flirted with him. Just then he yawned and decided to go to bed, it had been a long day. He could freak out and overthink this tomorrow. However, he couldn’t help but smile thinking about the man’s green eyes and freckles, and how kind he was, oh man, Cas was in trouble.
“Of course, see you boys in a bit.” she said, Cas heard the receiver click and he put the phone back in its proper place.
“Alright, fine I’ll watch Jack for a couple of minutes."
The group explained the plan to Amara and she sat there in shock. Dean scanned her face for any indication of emotion, there wasn’t any. There was a shrieking silence as she took the plan into consideration. She looked around at them before asking “Alright” she said as if she was just asked if she wanted to eat somewhere. “Really?” Dean asked in utter confusion. After all, they did to her, she was willing to help them, maybe she could help bring back Cas, no- he shouldn’t get his hopes up. Even if she could, The Empty wouldn’t give him up. “Like I told my brother, I’m doing this for me, not you.” she answered snapping Dean out of his thoughts.
“Hello, Welcome to the Miracle Inn, my name is Dean how can I help you?” the familiar phrase rolled off his tongue as he set down the boxes. As he looked up he saw the most gorgeous man he had ever laid his eyes on. Dark hair, blue eyes, and the softest smile. He rang up the handsome stranger and had to remind himself on multiple occasions that this wasn’t a chick-flick. Only after finishing up the process of checking him in and giving him a key, he realized that there was a kid in the waiting area. He had a kid, which probably meant he had a wife, or a husband hey, he didn’t judge. His kid seemed to be giving him some trouble, well-placed trouble but trouble nonetheless. He didn’t mean to eavesdrop but it was a small room so he thought he’d offer the guy a lifeline. He thought the kid’s name was Jack so that is what he went with.
A couple of days later everyone they cared about was at the bunker. Jody, Donna, the girls, Boby, Elieen, Garth all of them. They drank and hugged and joked about surviving yet another apocalypse. Gabriel and Micheal were mingling along with Amara. Jack was talking to Claire and Kaia who were standing hand in hand, while Jack talked their ears off about Star Wars; the bunker was full of laughter. Sam and Eileen were talking to Jody and Donna about cooking family dinner for all of them soon. Amara looked around with a smile, there was one person missing from this picture, Dean. She found Dean in his room with a glass of whiskey, she knocked and Dean said ‘Come in’ so she did.
“His deal!” Jack exclaimed softly, worry and despair overtaking his features. That got Dean’s attention.
“I wanted to but he asked me not to and I couldn’t betray his trust!” Jack explained
“Purgatory, they need a leviathan blossom for the spell, to give you the mark to close the cage.” he answered nonchalantly
“Hey! What about me?!” Said Claire
“Hello, Jack,” Amara said walking up to the library table to see what the Nephilim was up to.
“We were heading to Minnesota to visit my parents for Christmas. Jack hasn’t seen them for about a year so I thought it would be nice for him. Not to mention I missed my mom’s apple pie.” he answered simply
“Okay so we have everything we need, again this is so convenient it’s weird.” said Adam binging over a box containing the ingredients.
“Oh, that’s right, we haven’t met I’m Adam; Micheal’s vessel and Sam and Dean’s half-brother,” Adam answered nonchalantly reaching out to shake Gabe’s hand.
“Remember kids, you must stay where Cas and I see you at all times.” Dean reminded the two energetic young ones. The two kids nodded and the group headed out to the garden of the Inn, which was now covered in a blanket of fresh snow
“Last time?” she questioned
“I must admit, Dean does have a point. How will we be sure The ruler of that ‘crap-hole’ as you so eloquently put it, won’t just come and take him again. By the way, I’m still confused as to why he needs to be here at all, he is not an archangel.” Micheal asked eyes fixed on Sam.
“Not yet, buddy, we’re gonna have to stay at this motel for tonight. We can’t keep driving in this storm; it’s dangerous,” he said with an apologetic smile in his son’s direction
“For Dean” the archangel finished. Dean had to admit that final comment hurt like a bitch.
Dean was having fun talking to Cas. Their conversations were easy, there was no tension or awkwardness, other than that 30 seconds at the beginning of their dinner. As they kept talking, he learned that Cas had adopted Jack in after his parents gave him up for adoption. The way his eyes lit up when talking about Jack was adorable and reminded Dean of how he looked when he talked about Sam. Cas was amazing, kind, caring, and stunning to boot, how did Dean get so lucky as to meet him. Turns out Cas only lived about an hour and a half from Sioux Falls but had gotten a late start to their trip. They talked about how Dean loved pie and Cas swore he could make a mean apple pie that would surely knock his socks off. The guy was funny too, and he did this cute little thing where he would tilt his head when he didn’t understand a reference Dean made. He decided that he had to tell Cas how he felt about him, although he was scared that he would freak him out, he would hate himself if Cas left the inn and he never told him. They finished up their dinner and paid Dean insisted he would get it but the other man was relentless so they ended up splitting the bill. They said goodbye to Donna and headed back to the inn.
“Well, really you really don’t learn do you?” Chuck asked playfully. “You might be a little more powerful sis, but you’re still two members short of the original lineup. I only count Micheal and Gabriel which is only two archangels, unless you have Lucifer stashed here somewhere, you don’ have the juice to weaken me.” he added
“YEAH! Come on Jack!” Dean said
“Wait Dean, before you go. I just wanted to thank you again for the dinner and for the help with Jack.” he said with a warm look on his face and a shy smile.
“Is he gone?! Did we do It?!” Sam asked just then his phone rang.
“Hey, Jack how you holin’ up. “ Sam asked the young Nephilim
“Claire-oh there you are come one stop bothering the guests.” she said and tried to grab her daughter’s hand
“Hello! I’m Jack, oh wait you know that cause that is what Dean just said.” Jack answered which made Claire chuckle. Then she turned to Cas and introduced herself and Cas did the same. Soon Jody came in.
“Only if Jack says it’s okay. What do think kid, is it alright if I have breakfast with you and your dad?” he said crouching down to Jack’s level and was relieved when Jack nodded with an excited smile.
“Yeah, I did it earlier. Hey Dad, I’m hungry.” Jack replied
“What do ya say you team up with me against your Dad?” Dean asked the boy
“Really?” Dean asked enamored by the lack of embarrassment he felt discussing this with Jody
Dean's POV of the first encounter.
“I would but Jack is worried about his dad going out by himself and will only stay behind if I ‘protect’ his dad.”Dean explained
Dean took a second, Jack was right. This thing took Cas from him before he could tell him how he felt. This thing took Cas from them before he could say goodbye to his son and best friend. This thing took Cas from them. From him. However, this thing could give him back, it would give him back.
Cas laughed at the group's antics, he was initially disappointed when he and Dean were interrupted, but the disappointment was quickly replaced with fondness at seeing Dean join in with the pair of giggling kids.
“Oh! How wonderful! Where's the little tike?!” Donna asked looking around them
“Yes, I am.” she said
“‘Dean! Do you have Kevin’s elephant? You know he can’t sleep without it.” Cas called from the living room of their house trying to keep their nephew from having a temper tantrum.
Sorry, about not updating in a while, finals are a bitch. That's also why the chapter is so short this time. I hope you enjoy it! Again sorry, for the short chapter. I'll try to get the second part of it up within the next couple of days.
Dean and Cas sat there looking awkwardly at each other for about 30 seconds before Dean finally spoke up.
“Oh, wonderful I’ll just get Jack dressed and we’ll head down. Thank you.” Cas said gratefully
“Great so now we lost Cas? who else are we gonna lose!” Sam exclaimed at no one, in particular,
“Sure, I guess” he answered
“Enough, we didn’t summon you to have a friendly chat. We want to make a deal.” Sam said redirecting the focus of the conversation.
“I’m okay I guess, I just want Cas back.” Jack replied not looking up from his book.
“Oh, I get it!” she said with a playful smile appearing on her face
“Yeah, but it's okay. I appreciate the compliment and you’re pretty perfect too.” Cas reassured him, with a timid smile. Dean smiled and cleared his throat and turned to Donna.
“Look, I really want to make this work because I really like having you and Jack around and since you only live an hour and a half away from here, I think we have a shot. What do you say?” Dean said hopefully
“Sure, no problem.” the ma-Dean answered.
“Billie…Cas…The Empty.” he stuttered out slowly, not being able to string together more words than that.
“Do you promise to keep my Dad safe? From anything that includes monsters.” Jack quizzed  Dean
“Alright, but I’m going to go outside and keep an eye on you guys. Dean, would you like to join us? “ Cas asked turning to the man next to him.
“Well let’s go.”Jack chimed in “We got work to do. “ he added sternly. They all agreed to split up Sam and Jack would research and Dean and Micheal/Adam would look through their storage to see if they could find anything useful.
“Cas and Gabriel.” Dean responded matter-of-factly.
“Thank you, you’re very kind.” Cas thanked the man They reached the room and Cas got Jack into bed before taking the bags from Dean.
“Yeah, I get it.” Cas said raising his own bags. They shared a laugh and walked back into the warmth of the lobby.
“Winchesters!” The Empty said annoyed “Why is it always the Winchesters!” it continued rubbing its temples. As Dean caught its eye, it smiled and added. “You know, I could look like your angel friend, if you prefer Dean.” it taunted. Dean clenched his jaw but said nothing; he wouldn’t give it the satisfaction. “Huh, I guess you don’t want to see him again. Alrighty!” It added after seeing his reaction or lack thereof. Dean had to admit that made him want to lunge at it, but still he was silent.
“Okey-doke, you boys ready to order?” she asked after setting down the two cups and straws. Cas looked over at Dean and they exchanged a nod. Dean gestured for Cas to order first.
A couple of minutes later Dean watched Cas and Jack walk up to him and Claire by the entrance to the garden area of the Inn. The little girl immediately ran and hugged her new friend as if they had been separated for decades. Dean and Cas shared a fond smile.
“Come on Cas, two against one ain’t very fair!” Dean said looking expectantly as Cas. There was snow caught in his eyelashes, which Cas had to admit was extremely distracting. He quickly snapped out of it and grabbed a handful of snow and lobbed it in Dean’s direction hitting him square in the nose as his son had before.
“Really?” Sam’s eyes practically light up. “What is it? Where?”
“Big ol’ sap,” Dean mutters. After a moment, he adds, “Can’t believe you’re askin’ me about all this. I don’t know shit about business, babe. All I got is a GED and a give 'em hell attitude.”
should know, you took most of the pictures.” Hands on the wheel now, Dean’s next sentence is quieter, more grounded. “Besides, that was forever ago, man. Lotta things have changed.”
to.” Was he a fucking mind reader now?
PS: you can find me on tumblr CBFirestarter however I am not on there very often so if my response is slow thats why but I'd love to hear from any of my fellow fic lovers.
Three and a half hours later, the power still isn’t on and Dean seems to be on the verge of flipping the game board.
“Don’t be overdramatic, Bobby,” he mumbles, and rolls his eyes.
“You're being smart, right Sammy? Watching your drink and not going out alone?” Dean can feel the anxiety course through him at the thought of his omega little brother alone at a bar.
“Where am I?” he asks a bit uneasy, trying to remember how he ended up here.
Dean feels about two feet tall—this guy is so out of his league. He wonders if Castiel's just looking for a hookup with a kid from the wrong side of the tracks. He was okay with a casual relationship but he doesn’t want someone slumming it with him.
“No, no, I couldn’t… I don’t want to impose,” Castiel says in a rush.
“You’re fine now, Sam, but you just started your heat. It's gonna get a lot worse, okay, and your needs are gonna get a lot stronger. Just keep them nearby, in case you need them. Take some Advil too, it should help the fever.”
Dean followed silently after him and Castiel kept a close eye on the man, not sure if he might topple over at any moment. He thought about all the terrible things he would do to Nick if ever given the opportunity. He was starting to think his cousin was more than a sadist. He might actually be deranged to want to inflict this level of pain on another person.
“Dean, be still,” he commands and Dean freezes on the spot. Castiel grips his chin gently meeting his eyes again, “I have loved you for a long time, Dean. I am hopelessly in love with you. Though I had hoped I would get to tell you before you told you.”
Welcome, welcome, welcome! It's our favorite day, y'all…
“Don’t you ever do that again,” Ellen scolds, before pulling him down for a hug as well. Missouri, Kevin, Joshua, Charlie, Alfie, and even Gabriel all greet him with hugs and slaps on the back. He finally catches a glimpse of Sam and Cas standing off to the side, heads tipped down in conversation. Sam glances up at him and gives him a relieved look.
Castiel 12:12 PM >>
“I am. Consider it a perk of the job,” Castiel says casually, and sees Dean smile and shyly drop the blanket, facing the wall again. Without the distraction of an ongoing scene, Castiel can finally appreciate all the smooth curves and freckled skin of the man standing in front of him. The slopes of Dean’s shoulder blades are muscular and carved, his calves tight and athletic, his ass perfectly perky. Castiel finds himself distracted as he works, reading emails but then losing his train of thought as he tries to reply. It’s barely been two hours, but he’s tempted to fuck Dean all over again.
“Open up, toy,” Castiel commands, and he does, watching as Castiel unzips his fly and pulls out his mostly flaccid cock. Dean knees himself forward, taking the large cock into his wet mouth and resists the urge to suck and lick. It's like having a really good ice-cream bar in your mouth but being told not to eat it.
“That was… I dunno, it was...intense. Was that subspace?” he asks cautiously.
Hello Readers!
“Sure, follow me,” he replies quickly and doesn’t miss the guy checking out his ass as he climbs down off the ladder.
“Excuse me?” he asks, putting away the rest of his supplies.
“Please…” His sub gives a disappointed moan at the loss of fingers, but he’s staring down at the prostate stimulator with wide, excited eyes. Castiel hasn’t explained the device to his sub yet, and he wonders if it would ramp up the anticipation.
"Oh yeah, I mean, you just look young is all."
. He tries desperately to breathe.
“Still, I’d like you to use a cold compress to help with swelling.”
“You’re gonna beat the shit out of me either way, aren’t you? Just get the fuck on with it,” he challenges, and the cool stare ratchets up his fear a bit. Better to know now just how bad Cas can get.
“Jeez, okay. What’s got your panties in a twist?” Gabriel frowns, peering over his menu. He sucks ridiculously hard on the sucker in his mouth, making a wet and irritating slurp.
“Sammy, these are a fact of life, okay? Believe me, it will get really painful without them. They are all new, and they are meant for…for beginners.” Dean feels heat creep up on his face.
what’s gotten into Cas lately but neither want to discuss it. Finally, when Dean moves on from Castiel’s hands and begins to run a warm, wet washcloth over his dirty cheeks, he whispers, “Don’t be sorry.”
He keeps track of her blood pressure, which is lower than he would like. He gives her a fluid bolus and once her pressure improves he gives her some fentanyl to help ease the pain. The team moves quickly, and soon Dean can see the night sky above him, one step closer to getting his patient out. It’s then that he looks up to see medflight landing, two medics jumping out as they make for one of the other overturned vehicles, ready to take the patient from the medics on the ground. It’s just a glance, barely longer than a heartbeat as he looks harder and sees a familiar square jaw and deep commanding eyes. He’s pretty sure he’s hallucinating, because there is no way in hell that medic is also…his dom.
Castiel feels a spike of adrenaline course through him. It’s been forever since he’s been with a submissive this resistant, this inherently bratty. He generally dominates the upcoming graduates from the facility, to both ensure they’ve been properly trained and to fulfill his own intense, biological urges. Dean’s unyielding attitude is unusual, both angering him and making his cock twitch with interest. It’s been a long time,
“People?”
Dean’s gaze down on Castiel’s lips, and Cas wants so badly to kiss him, to banish the last hour of mayhem into the recesses of his mind. “Dean, I want you to know that this is real for me. I never meant to hurt you.”
Cain hasn’t fucked him yet but he sure likes to beat Dean. He has a wicked paddle that whistles through the air before it strikes him, even though Dean has always preferred the biting sting of a crop or flogger over the bruising pain of a paddle. It has him avoiding sitting down since he got back to Sioux Falls. He supposes since it’s punishment though—for some infraction Dean can’t begin to understand—he shouldn’t like it anyway. Still, even with Castiel he always felt relief with punishments. With Cain it feels more like he's a sponge for the guy's rage. He’s mostly thankful that Cain hasn’t forced him to spend the night in his bed. He likes to stroke Dean’s back for a bit while he calms down after a beating, sometimes mumbling the name “Colette” in between his soft apologies. That's usually it for aftercare, though, and that's fine by him. The touch feels all kinds of wrong, just like everything else does. He isn’t sure how much longer he can handle being called a
He takes a long, hot shower in his enormous walk-in, the cracked stone tile rough and textured against his feet. He lets his mind wander, analyzing the day’s events. It’s pleasing to see Dean fitting in so smoothly already, and he’ll need to alert Charlie to set Dean up with his own laptop and email account first thing tomorrow. Perhaps Castiel can take a long run in the morning during Dean’s onboarding session. Despite being mentally fatigued, he seems to have a lot of pent-up energy today, a fact that becomes undeniable when he glances down and notices he’s hard. That happens so rarely these days—Castiel’s private thoughts are generally quite business-focused—that he decides to indulge himself.
“Truth or dare,” Cas repeats flatly, as if Dean hasn’t even spoken.
“Oh, fuck…” Castiel moans, feeling on the edge already. Dean sucks him off mercilessly, like he has no intention of teasing Cas, of being gentle or gradually building the pressure.

“Well, go give it a try.” Castiel gestured toward the grass and Dean thought on it, but finally made a move, heading for the lush green lawn. It felt spongy and damp beneath his toes. It was fairly warm for that time of year and Dean lay down flat on his back, star-fished out beneath the sun. Dean loved the sun, and even though the grass was a little damp it still warmed his skin. He heard a rustling and only flinched a little as Castiel lowered himself next to Dean. They stared up at the clouds and Dean focused on the rise and fall of his chest with each breath. Breathing was about the most basic thing for Dean to do. It was all he had to do to keep his brother safe.
“This is your suite while you will be staying here. If there is something you need or that can make you more comfortable, just make a list on this note pad.”
Sam breaks Dean from his thoughts, and he blinks up at his brother. He can see the toll everything is taking on him as well. Sam is looking thin from his heat, and has bags under his eyes. Dean needs to get his head on straight and take better care of his brother.
Dean’s eyes widen. “You want me to…?”
“You’re being ridiculous,” Castiel mumbles to himself. “It’s been two days. That’s all. Don’t freak out after two days.” His quiet, stagnant kitchen doesn’t offer a reply, and chuckles to himself darkly. “And now I’m talking to myself.
“I’m not letting some uppity little bitch kick me out of my family home,” Lucifer growls, stalking closer. “I think it's time someone showed you your place.”
Castiel finishes feeding Dean his fries, pleased to see all the food almost gone. Though, there is the pie, which Dean has been eyeing eagerly from his spot on the floor.
“Now this is the kind of dessert I like to have after lunch.” Castiel licks over one nipple, making him shiver before he pulls back to stare at him.

Come chat with us in the comments :)
“Oh, god, no. You kidding? The way you’re handling things now, pretty sure I’d have to tell you
Castiel turns his blue eyes back to Dean, and they soften into a smile when they land on his face. “Don’t be. I hardly knew him.” Castiel shrugs it off. “Do you have a favorite author?”
“But I’m still…processing,” Castiel argues, looking around his kitchen to try and locate the fifth of Jim Beam he’s been demolishing. He normally doesn’t drink much—that time he got drunk on Gabriel’s birthday was a total outlier—but there’s something about finding out your best friend is also your secret sexual partner that makes Cas want to act out.
“No, you’re not,” Castiel says evenly.
“Yeah, haven’t seen him in a few weeks, plus maybe he will have that book I keep waiting on at the library.” Only Sam would get that excited about a history book.

*****************
“Oh god,” Dean moans, shutting his eyes closed tight.
The week is long, but Dean finds himself looking forward to his few short moments with Castiel. The other man waits for the other customers to leave before coming to get his cappuccino. They talk about their brothers and about favorite foods. They both avoid the subject of parents and that’s fine by Dean. He learns that Castiel doesn’t mind his hotel but he hates that there is no bathtub, something Dean can’t understand since he hasn’t taken a bath since he was a kid. Castiel says he should really give it a chance and Dean replies only if Castiel gets in with him. The look Cas gives him makes it clear that is definitely on the table.

His head turns and he sees Sam jogging over to him, a wide smile spreading across his face.
“I should go.”
“You have yourself a deal.” Castiel leans in, kissing him again, and he is really starting to love those lips. “Now, you promise to call or text me if you start to feel off, or have any bad thoughts. I know you said you read about sub drop, but…”
“Cas…” Large belly between them, Dean still somehow manages to touch their foreheads together, eyes closed. “Nothing’s gonna happen.”
“So now, you’re one of the few people who knows,” Castiel says in an even tone, “and you understand why I’ve never been with an omega before.”
“Yes, I like them. Please.” He pushes his wrists up a little higher, trying to control his breathing.
I had a great time, thanks for meeting with me. I will try and look at the list tomorrow.
of you. Want your usual, babe?”
The shower has finally warmed up enough for Castiel’s liking, and he grabs a towel and arranges it on the hook. The past few showers he’s spent long and slow, daydreaming about his sub and coming all over the shower walls. But he has a guest in his apartment at the moment, plus he’s pressed for time, so there’s little chance of working through his sexual frustrations today.
about it. Castiel knows. Castiel knows what he's feeling, knows what he wants to say.
Castiel turns to Dean, lips quivering as his tears roll down his face, and he slips his arm around Dean's torso to burrow himself within Dean's side.
But no.
"You? Will tear down a
Dean sighs.  "I think it's a long time, a month."
"Dean, I need you to breed me."
A silence ensues, and Castiel glances back at the bright red-rimmed wall clock on the front of the room. There's about five minutes until break ends; until his call with Green ends.
"Very."
“Man, he must be gettin' chicks left, right, and center.”
Blue laughs, and Dean listens, simply listens to how his laughter resembles that of a child, and how it sounds like melting chocolate in a cup of warm milk, or like a glass of whiskey on a cold, lonely night.
"Well, not really. It's only been a day or two. Besides, I hate small talk. Why do I need to go over to some stranger's house to talk to them for absolutely no reason besides compelling them to acknowledge my existence?"
. Now he's irritated Dean.
"Castiel?"
"Are you here to see me out of pity or...?"
"The spell that hit you, Dean," She starts, "-was what we call
"I'm going to prove to you that the tuning is right, and that you don't need to poke your little nose into our affairs again."
"I've been alive for eons, Winchester, I know better than to play dirty. A deal is a deal."
?" Dean shoots Castiel a hard look, who blinks at him once, before shrugging.
"Baby come on, just a shower," he says, and kisses the top of Dean's head, who stares out the window, eyes passive and inscrutable, and the expression coils something dark within Castiel's gut. At Dean's silence, Castiel slips his arms under Dean's armpits, and makes a lousy effort to haul Dean up. Dean smiles as he blinks back to the present, nudging Castiel away as he steps off the bed. Castiel grins, reaching up on his toes to drop a kiss over Dean's forehead, and before he can step back, Dean hooks his arms under his thighs and hauls him up, a sad smile on his face as Castiel yelps, and chuckles into the depth of Dean's neck.
"Fuck," he panted, "-I haven't come that hard in
Slowly, Dean pushes the hood on his head back, rising up taller over Castiel, as he flexes his back, and Castiel takes a staggering step back, his eyes wide as they notably linger over the long, thick scar running across Dean's face, and his breath hitches as he meets Dean's eyes. Dean sees a conflict within his eyes, for a fleeting moment, before he composes himself with a steady breath.
"Say please."
"Shoulda' done that ages ago," Dean chuckles, and Castiel rolls on his side to drape a hand across Dean's chest. He snuggles into Dean's side, and Dean runs a hand through his hair.
is her absolute favorite.
A laugh slipped past Castiel's lips unbidden, and before he knew it, there were broad, tender arms sliding around his chest, pulling him into a hug, and for the first time in days, Castiel let himself have it.
"Great," Dean mutters, and takes a swig of his beer. For a moment, both men simply bask in the presence of each other, before Sam rubs his hand over his mouth, runs it through his hair, and looks up at Dean.
"To extents which I cannot describe," Castiel sighed, his eyes meeting Dean's as Dean grinned, and paused at the cash counter.
"Anything for my boy," he sighed, and pressed a soft kiss to Castiel's forehead.
Standing in the kitchen, his hands occupied with a knife and the pie he baked, he glances at the calendar and notes it's the third of December, which means it's been almost a month and a half since Castiel struck up an eccentric friendship with Mr.Green— no—
"All the pain."
"I don't know," Castiel sighed, his voice heavy with stuttered breaths as Dean stroked him, and he felt the pressure in his gut creep further and further, deeper into his cock, and oh, release seemed seconds away, when—
open it is to break it down, or unhinge it perhaps," Mildred said, and turned away, resuming her walk towards the kitchen. Castiel's eyes snapped towards the room, and back to Mildred.
"Like you said, we're just a couple of dumbasses."
Urged by Dean's words, but also wary of his temper, Sam and Castiel get to work. Dean pauses for a moment, wondering if he's feeling alright.
Part of him wishes he’d never met Blue.
A sigh slips past Castiel's lips as he picks at a fingernail on Dean's finger.
"Hey, hey, Cas, what's happening? Look at me, ba-buddy, hey," Dean whispers, knowing how frantic he sounds as he sits up and runs his hand over Castiel's head.
Dean walks into his bedroom, drops onto his bed, and groans loud into his pillow.
Castiel knits his eyebrows together, head tipping to the side as he flutters his eyes open, lips quirked in a pout.
"Cas, I didn't have a choice, I told you, they want me to either move in or sell the house—"
"I may have misjudged the Sunday crowd."
"Probably."
"You didn't answer my question, Dean," Castiel says, and Dean heaves a sigh, before taking a sip of his coffee.
There it was again, the pounding of his heart, the pounding in his head, the paralysing numbness in his feet, the quickening of his breath, the tightness in his throat— for the first time in days.
"So you're my true mate?"
"Would your apology change the circumstances we've landed ourselves in?"
"Why not? That sounds great. We could play some Zep, grab a few burgers and
and you ask that Winchester boy about the date."
Castiel's hand at Dean's jaw falters, and drops to his thigh, where he squeezes hard with a rough groan. At last, his orgasm rips through him, and shoots out in thick strings, painting Dean's hand white. Dean chuckles behind him, pressing another kiss to Castiel's forehead, before slipping his hand out of Castiel's soiled sweatpants.
"I'm sorry, Dean, put me down—"
"You want me to touch you? If you answer me, I promise I will."
"Wha— what are you going to do to me?" Castiel asked, only to realise there was no way the demon would ever answer his question, or even acknowledge it, and he hung his head down in surrender, knowing there was no escape for this demon. Perhaps during one of his torture rituals, death would finally engulf Castiel. He would like that. But knowing the demon, it wouldn't. And Castiel would have to live through shame, disgust, and misery— all through the end.
He ignores him, and picks up his feet as he begins to walk. He's thankful for the momentary distraction, but his mind still wanders back to Castiel.
Who was she? The omega Garth had told Castiel about, the one who died young and unmated? Was it perhaps, her sorrow that echoed through the air in the house? Castiel couldn't say for certain.
"Right. Did you think of me when you watched it?"
"There's a package. At your door. Thought I'd point it out."
But Castiel hadn't done any such thing. And he had no plans to either.
"You're delicious, baby, what a tasty fucking slut. God, you're gonna' be a good lay."
escapes Castiel's mouth, only to be swallowed down by Dean's lips on his. The world, in all its might, is reduced to nothing but the brush of a set of lips against Dean's own, Castiel's lips. It doesn't matter anymore, how loud the wind howls or how heavily the trees sway. All Dean can comprehend is
Castiel doesn't respond for a moment. His eyes wander over Dean's face, searching for an answer; for truth.
Still unaware of Dean's presence, Castiel continued to hum under his breath as he glided across the kitchen floor, grabbing mugs and whatnot, but Dean could do nothing but remain rooted to the ground and
"I thought I would never have it."
Something glimmered within his eyes.
Neither men say anything for a moment, and Dean feels his face heat up.
Castiel nosed against Dean's jaw, purring contently, and Dean reached up to caress his pointy, black ear, to which Castiel blushed, and looked away.
Dark, deep green eyes met his own.
"Must be hot, no, angel?"
Castiel gazes down at the book in his hands.
"Dean, where is he?"
Castiel smiled, crossing his arms against his chest victoriously. "And that, mister, is why we don't judge a book by its cover."
"I'm gonna' step out a limb and say that was your first kiss."
"I don't know what to do." he whispers, his bottom lip trembling, and Sam, hearing him speak for the first time in so long, stares up at him with wide, wonder-filled eyes.
"I'll miss you too,” he hums, “-But it's just a few hours, Mr. Green, and you need to be sleeping. Why don't you try some cold milk?"
Utter and complete silence engulfs the room as Dean stares down at Castiel.
And so, the first verse to O Sole Mio fills the room once again. Although to the common ear, the music might sound excellent, to Castiel's ear, the melody is gritty at the edges, and it can be better, it can always be better.
— I need your cock—"
"I won't say you did what you had to do, because you made a choice, Mr.Green, the consequences of which you must have known. All I can say is that we all do bad things. But life goes on, and though we can't ask for forgiveness, we can always choose to learn and grow."
This was no ordinary demon.
The beer on his tongue now tasted bitter, or perhaps it was his own anger leaving a repulsive taste in his mouth, either way, Castiel wanted to leave, wanted to disappear, wanted to pretend seeing Dean was an illusion, that they were nothing now, that ten years of friendship meant nothing, that it took only one girl, no,
"Who ordered the ambush?"
"Oh, no," Castiel purses his lips. “-I mean, is there something else?"
"How you feelin'? Hope the ride wasn't too bad," Dean asked, his voice soft, laced with concern and worry, and it tugged at something within Castiel, as he turned around in Dean's arms, and pressed himself against his alpha, as much as his swollen stomach would allow. He noticed how Dean's hands rested on his belly, instead of curling around his waist, as they usually did, and it made him smile.
"Wait, so how many instruments do you play?"
"Oh— more— Dean—"
give me a moment."
"I've untied you," the demon clicked his tongue, "-now turn over for me. Let me see your hole."
with an expectant look in his eyes and an assuring smile.
"It's curable, yes, and actually a very common curse used by amateur witches.""
The door locks with a click, and Castiel leans back against the rosewood frame, staring down at the package in his hands. Again, a thought pops up in his mind, about who could have sent him something like this? He barely talks to anybody in the apartment, except for well, his neighbour, who he also only speaks to through a wall. Thoughts racing, he sets the package down on his coffee table and right as he does, a slip of paper falls from the bundle, at once drawing Castiel's attention to it.
A pause, and Castiel feels the hesitation in Green's voice. And then comes from across the wall, in the quietest, softest voice—
"What a pretty sight, omega."
"Fuck," he groans, and slips his arms under Castiel's waist. With a measured breath, he lifts him into his arms and hauls him up. Castiel chuckles, wrapping his legs tight around Dean's waist, as he leans down to nip at Dean's ear. Dean glances up at Castiel in his arms, a wide, raunchy grin on his face as he carries Castiel to their new bedroom.
"So good for me, Cas, how about this, you answer another question and I'll do something about this," Thick fingers grazed against Castiel's leaking, throbbing cock, and he gasped, burying his face deeper in the refuge of Dean's arms, finding himself unable to move or speak, as Dean wrapped his palm around Castiel's cock, and stroked it in lousy, slow thrusts, driving Castiel closer and closer to the edge he'd been teetering on.
"Fuck, you're so fucking tight, Cas—" Dean mumbled after a long silence, and Castiel in turn, squeezed his hands around Dean's shoulder with a whimper, "-I'm gunna' breed you up so good, every one's gonna' know just who you belong to."
It feels as if an anvil drops into Dean's guts.
"I know, there's a lot to talk about, Dean. But hey, listen I'm calling for a bit of business."
"Man, I'm going to have to wear earplugs tomorrow, aren't I?"
"You look nice. And smell nice too."
"Well, you're not either."
"Oh, god—" she groaned out, and trudged over to the bed, plucking layer after layer of clothes off her body, until she was left with nothing but a pair of lacy panties and a bralette, and the moment she dug a knee into the bed to crawl over her mate, Cassie's eyes flew open, bright and blue, fluttering with confusion and arousal, before she spread her legs open and, and held her hands out in invitation.
Being held in Dean's embrace reminds Castiel of a home he's never been to before.
"Never been better," Castiel says, and with a laboured breath, sinks down to the hilt on Dean's cock, both men moaning out in unison as the ecstasy of their touch crawls under their skin. For a moment, he remains idle, but then he moves, and his eyes wander to Dean in question.
Dean sat in the tense silence as Castiel pulled his boots off, and he watched as the man pulled away his elegantly knitted socks with a dragon pattern adorning them. He admired the shape of Castiel’s manly calves and then blushed and averted his eyes, not wanting to be caught staring. Quieting his own breathing and willing his fluttering heart to slow, Dean fixed his eyes on the yellow dandelions dancing in the grass until Castiel, once again in total control of himself, stepped around him to the lake’s edge, apparently determined to continue as though he had not just experienced a flare of desire.
When Brady stopped at Dean’s door, the omega held his breath. He watched the man insert the key into the lock. Why would he lock Dean in? But no! He turned the key and then the knob. He entered the room!
“As next of kin, we will need you to come identify the body.”
“Cas,” he replied against his lips. The kiss lasted long enough for Silla to trot back over to the kitchen mat and try once more to fit her large frame onto the soft rectangle.
He pasted on an affable smile and stood at the back doorway to bid his mate a modest farewell on his way to the stables. “Wait,” he said, when they had barely set foot on the track that led downhill. He detoured to the garden and pulled up a pair of carrots, each of which he snapped in two. Handing the four treats to Castiel he said, “One for each of your horses, and one for Baby and one for Nova.”
“It is all the rage on the continent, I assure you, Dean,” Sam pleaded his case as his brother pulled at his sideburns before moving his attentions to his new sister.
“That was Colonel Milton outside your door, sir. He has been there these three hours or more looking as miserable as a man can be, barely moving or even breathing, except to growl, until that door opens and then he’s huffing his fool head off so he can get your scent and drive himself mad with it.”
Wanting to dispel the tension, Castiel brought up the wedding, feeling like an absolute imposter for doing so, but Dean’s brilliant smile brought everyone to life, and Castiel could not feel guilty about putting it on the omega’s face.
"She's licking your face because you literally handed her a quarter pound of meat on a paper plate."
She certainly treated him like a brother, ever punching his shoulder or teasing him mercilessly for some mild misstep. Often they lost hours together twisting fine wires and laughing at the tiny cuts on their fingertips.
Never a yes or no answer from this guy.
Cas eyes Sam warily. "Yes. Those are some of his many names."
