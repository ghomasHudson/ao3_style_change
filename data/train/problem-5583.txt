"You know Steve, it's been awhile," Tony broke the comfortable silence, and leans over on his alpha, circling his finger on his clothed abs.
Steve gently removed his fingers from his puffy ring, and got off the bed to grab a condom. Sliding it over his length, he held Tony's waist, "Peter better watch his head," He quipped, positioning his tip.
Strange paused, before leaving the room. A couple of minutes later, he came back with a towel covering their deceased baby.
Tony answered by pulling away. Steve's own hand replacing Tony's mouth, performing fast, liquid strokes around himself.
Peter's cries echoed into the quiet night, alarming the parents. Tony grunted, and turned onto his side. Steve didn't want to wake his lover, he carefully gets out of bed, and strolls over to his child's room.
Giving his hole some attention, Steve licked it, catching some slick as well. Tony moans, and grips the pillows, entrance clenching for more. He moves his tongue around his lover's sensitive pucker, lightly breaching it with the tip of his tongue. Tony whines for Steve to prep him so he could fuck him quicker.
love my cock don't you, baby?" Steve grabs his lover's chest again, purring in his ear, "Even when you're seven months pregnant you still want me to fuck this pretty little pussy. Damn, even Peter's gonna know how badly daddy loves papa's cock.."
"God, I missed your cock.." It has been months since they done it, since they had experienced this feeling. The sensations were much more powerful since they'd gone so long without them until now.
Steve holds his hips, thrusting a little faster than before. Tony's body scoots upwards a tad, and he grips the blankets from the feeling of Steve's thick hardness deepening in and out of him.
"Of course you do," The alpha unbuttons his pants, and pulls out his semi hard cock from his boxers. Tony's heart fluttered when he saw it. It's been six damn months since he's even seen his pounder. He didn't forget the length and girth and how the veins looked and twitched when he was near his orgasm. Tony smirked up at him, grabbing his slightly heavy shaft and licking his tip. His tongue delved in between the slit of his cock, lapping there.
Tony gave it all he had, pushing and pushing, screaming painfully until finally the little boy''s cries erupted from under him. The brunette gasped when he heard the bawling infant. Steve smiled brightly, and kissed Tony's head, rubbing his shoulder.
" Steve objected, kind of in a surprised manner, not meaning to lead Tony to believe that by the words he said, "God, no Tony. A slut could never describe you, dear. You're so pretty and perfect, I can't see you like that. Not now. Right now, you're the sexy lil' thing carrying our baby," Steve kisses his neck.
The brunette opened his mouth with his tongue out, eyes lighting up when Steve suddenly bursts his orgasm onto his face and mouth with a long, pleased noise along with Tony's name in there. Some semen splashed onto his slightly swollen chest, and Tony swipes his tongue over the mess on his face, enjoying the familiar taste.
Steve smiled gently, and puts an arm on Tony's shoulder, "I wasn't even out for five minutes, though."
Tony grunts, feeling the impact of Peter's feet slightly stronger than normal, "Ooh, he's kickin' more.. He probably likes the sound of your voice. I know I do," The brunette giggles softly.
Some slick escaped out of Tony, Steve's cock becoming slippery and easier to maneuver in and out of him. Erotic, wet sounds emit between them from their bodies colliding with each thrust. A moan comes forth of Tony's mouth, lifting his head up.
"God, yes.." Steve grinds his hips against his lover harder, nearing his own release as it crept up on him, and he growls deep from his chest, "I'm gonna cum soon.."
Steve closed his blue eyes to fully appreciate the wet warmth compressing around him. He groans throaty and long at the wave of slick, "God baby, you just got so fucking wet. Feels so good."
Steve looked down at his crying son's face. Brown hair, and blue eyes. 8 pounds and 6 ounces. A healthy baby. Steve wiped his tears away, seeing how small he was contrasting with the doctors big hands.
There, Peter wailed, squirming in his crib, tears rolled down his rosy cheeks. Steve walked towards the crib, frowning.
"It's not like that. When I think about a slut, I think about other people using you.. having sex with you. I don't want to think about that. We're married, and you're pregnant on top of that," Steve said, kissing his cheek.
Steve pants, and tenses up from his climax. He pats Tony's head as a praise. Tony stands up to kiss Steve's neck, placing a knee on the bed to maintain balance. He starts planting kissing down to his chest and he sucks on one of his Alpha's pecs. Steve sighs in pleasure, unusually sensitive in that area. Before his serum, his chest wasn't as sensitive as it was now. Tony makes a hickey on his meaty muscle, and pulls away from him.
"Come on, harder. Fuck me harder," Tony blurts as a demand, the tone in his voice showing that his desires needed to be fulfilled, "Give it to me like an alpha should."
Steve noticed a Captain America pacifier that was located inside of his crib. He picked it up, and placed it in the infants mouth, rocking him. Peter's cries turned into small whimpers before he became completely silent, sucking on the pacifier as his eyes started to close. Steve smiled, and kissed his son's forehead. He carefully placed him back in the crib, and the baby slept soundly, softly snoring.
"Me too, Tony," Steve wipes his tears, smiling back at his lover, and they share a soft kiss. Tony lays back down, with a yawn.
"Fuck, Tony.." Steve's cheeks began to flush at Tony's choice of words, "Gonna fill you up so good. Gonna get you nice and creamed."
That caught the parents by surprise. They looked at Strange and the other doctors stunned, eyes widening.
"Mr. Stark, you're having a second child. I need you to just calm down and breathe." Strange said straightforwardly, getting back in position between his patients legs.
"Love these gorgeous tits.. My favorite part about your pregnancy.." Steve says out of the eroticism of it all, kneading his husband's mounds.
Steve smiles as well, but then it fades and he averts his eyes, face reddening. Tony tilts his head, "Got something on your mind?"
Steve kissed his ass cheek, and nibbles down on it and created a small hickey, Tony slightly jumps from  feeling his teeth. Steve positioned his fingers onto Tony's hole, then slid one inside, earning a gasp of slight pain.
"Steve, I'm not crying.." That was a lie, Tony was currently wiping his tears away, "It feels like I don't deserve you. You'd do anything for me. You make me feel special. All my life, people demeaned me and made me feel so ashamed and I blamed myself for what I was and you're the one who made me truly accept myself. I would've never thought about my life coming up to this moment. Knocked up by the love of my life, and being due within a few months. We're going to have a family and it still boggles my mind. I love you too, Steve. So much." Tony tried to keep his voice from breaking, but Steve heard it.
Steve nodded.  Then actually tried it and found that proposition took a bit more doing than he realized, but between the two of them, he managed to get his feet under him and follow the King into the bedchamber.  The King nudged him forward until his thighs hit the edge of the bed and he sat down heavily and looked up at the King who ran his hands down the sides of Steve’s face before dropping them to Steve’s shoulders and pushing him back onto the pillows.  Steve swung his legs up onto the bed and waited.
“He’s not in there.  They wouldn’t…he’s, ah. He’s one of the more progressive candidates, I guess you could say,” Tony admitted carefully.  He picked up his fork and stabbed at the egg yolk, though didn’t take a bite.  He was pretty sure if he did, he’d choke on it.  Which, all in all, might be the better option.  Instead, he cleared his throat and looked up at Steve.
Steve took the coin from Tony’s hand, turned and dropped it in the water.  It made a soft plink as it landed and sank to the bottom, where it gleamed amidst the darker coins.
“This place plays tricks on the mind,” Tony said with an understanding smile. “Coupled with all our talk of disappearances and visions, it is no wonder you were disconcerted.  Come,” he urged, “I don’t know about you, but I am ready to leave this place. In truth, we should be getting back before Josiah and Peran come searching for us, despite my order.”
It went on like that for a while, the two of them trading stories and questions, most of them innocuous, but sometimes, Tony would say something, something meant to be flippant that wasn’t, like his first crush, some boarding school classmate with what Steve decided was the asshole-sounding name of Tiberius, and sometimes, Steve would share a memory of his mom or the hospitals, being sick all the time, and there would be this moment…Steve was starting to recognize them more and more, these moments that felt more real than others with Tony.
Steve said nothing, just stood there, ramrod straight.  He wasn’t afraid of Stane, but he wasn’t stupid enough not to be wary.  The man had nursed his depravity under Tony’s nose for decades and built quite the handsome empire for himself in the process, and Tony was too smart for Steve to dismiss that kind of subterfuge as a fluke.
Tony's hands moved of their own accord to clutch at Steve's arms, and he knew he was shaking him, without really meaning to, but he couldn't seem to get himself to stop. He buried his head into the center of Steve's chest, his arms wrapping around him to claw at Steve's back. His face was wet, and he couldn't get enough air, and he needed Steve to say it. When he looked up, he could see the pulse jumping in Steve's neck to match the pounding in Tony's ears where Steve's heart throbbed against the side of Tony's head, though that was the only part of Steve that moved, the rest of him held rigid where he stood.
Steve’s grip on the table was almost painful, would have been except he couldn’t feel anything except the way the King’s mouth felt as he drew Steve’s cock in deeper again, deeper this time than before, until Steve felt a slight shift as he slid all the way down the King’s throat.  The King swallowed around him once, the motion constricting and then releasing around Steve’s cock, then pulled back and let Steve’s cock slide almost all the way out before the King’s lips caught around the head and sucked hard.  He looked up at Steve with a wicked gleam in his eye and reached one hand between Steve’s legs, just behind his balls and pressed the pad of his thumb into the smooth skin there.
She looked up at Howard, then over at Maria.  Something passed between them, though Steve couldn’t see the answering looks from the camera’s angle, but Peggy held out her hand and, after a moment, Howard slapped the robot toy into it with a tight puff of air and turned away, flipping through the script pages and calling out for someone to get on the lights, it was too God-damned bright in there.
Something about that prickled in Steve’s mind, leaving a crawling sensation behind it.  The warmth fled, chased away by a flurry of thoughts that seemed to spring into Steve’s mind all at once, and he was suddenly adrift, a small boat rocking in a windswept sea, with a wave curling around him, sending him under until up was down and he wasn’t sure which way held the sky.
“Well, don’t throw things at me,” Bruce muttered, brushing a hand across his chest, then wincing as another berry flew past him. “Besides, I do not have a--Steve, don’t listen to him.  I had one--
“I’m out late all the time,” Steve boasted, which was somewhat true and also a big, fat lie, as fat as Mister Crumpton, the banker over in Gulleytown, who was so large they had to make a special bench for him at the church over there, or so Bucky said though sometimes Bucky exaggerated a bit because he knew Steve liked the stories.  Steve really wished he could go see the special bench, but his mother said it was too far and that it would be blaze-famous, besides. Steve wasn’t sure what blaze-famous meant, but he figured it had something to do with hell, since it seemed to him that the Reverend said just about anything fun would lead straight there.
“Tyler Durden is a manifestation of anti-consumerism and toxic masculinity, Objectivism taken literally would lead to sociopathy, and Rand had an affair with one of her followers twenty-five years her junior and then excommunicated him and falsely accused him of embezzlement when he slept around on her, all the while her husband drank himself into alcoholism,” Steve said.
“Yes, it’s fucking working!” Brock shouted.  “See! This is what happens!” he snapped, pointing a finger at Steve’s face.  “I knew it.  I fucking knew it.  You get around Barnes, and he puts all these crazy ideas in your head.  What’d I tell you about him, huh?  He’s not good for you, Steve.  He doesn’t understand you, not now, not when he has his sweet little wifey to take care of him.  He doesn’t need you and your baggage, that’s for sure as shit, didn’t you get that memo when he was playing house husband over there?  And now you’re listening to whatever bullshit he puts in your head, and for what?  Why’s he suddenly so interested in your life, huh?  Let me guess.  You gave him a million reasons to care, that it?   Bet that’d help with the honeymoon, huh?”
“I heard you talking while I was in the coma.” Tony hissed over his shoulder. Already there was a bruise forming across his face, his bottom lip was swollen, stained with blood. He shook against the floor, sweating with exertion. “I know what you are, I know everything.”
“You took the serum because you were a sad, little nobody who would have done anything to be more than what you were.” Tony sneered, “Just like the rest of them.”
“Wake up.” Steve snarled, his voice a thunderous rumble echoing around the room. From the bed, one bright blue eye opened. It met Steve’s gaze, impossibly focused despite the rude awakening.
“Yes. Well, no. Not exactly. I didn’t start your journey. That was some other asshole. I just hijacked you…” Iron Man sighed, and the noise was so tired, so defeated. The sound of a man close to giving up. Steve let his anger fall away slowly.
Peter glanced down at his own picture. The fan of crayons had left a curve of colourful streaks and lines around his stick figure family, framing them like a rainbow. They were all definitely holding hands.
Tony stiffened, and the stern nurse frowned in warning at him. “Remember the position.” She told him.
Steve looked up. Tony’s head stretched out over his head, blue eyes peering down at him worriedly. He smiled reassuring up at the child. “I used to be. I’m not sure anymore.”
“Nobody can quite figure out what’s going on.” His mother was saying, “But look at him, my baby’s withering away. There is something wrong here.”
Steve felt sick. He sat upright, turned away so he could swing his legs over the side of the bed. Away from Tony.
“We’re looking for the cosmic cube shards.” Tony’s expression was stilted, uncomfortable. “I’m coordinating the others, not much use outside the workshop.”
He was polite but Tony could hear the want in his voice, the desperation to find something familiar. Tony remembered the emptiness, the nothing he had found in this room after Howard’s death and felt a stab of concern. This could end up being an exercise in cruelty and Tony and Steve had spent too long being unknowingly cruel to each other. Tony didn’t want to hurt him again.
“You’re the one whose been moving me through time?” Steve asked, his voice hard. He suddenly remembered the dreams, the strange flashes he had experienced between each time jump. Tony’s voice calling out to him, asking for his help. Steve had thought it was his own twisted psyche, unconscious desires or guilt embodied in Tony. He hadn’t thought that Tony might have been behind this, that Tony might have done this to him. After the future he had just come from, Steve couldn’t bear the thought of battling Tony again.
“Get up,” Steve repeated loudly. His voice had finally stirred the occupants of the bed and the young couple sleepily roused, mumbling confusedly into Tony’s pillow. From the bed, there came a dark, muffled chuckle and then Tony was twisting, moving easily to sit upright in the bed, his arms around the naked occupants of the bed. It was a show, a demonstration. Except Steve didn’t understand what it meant.
Like a predatory sensing weakness, Tony stalked forward, dropping down on top of Steve. He landed heavily in Steve’s lap, legs bracketed Steve’s thighs and his hands pressing hard into each of Steve’s shoulders. Steve stared up at him, trapped and broken. He had a memory of another fight between them. But in that fight it had been Tony who had ended up on his back, staring up at Steve, unable to move.
“I know. I know.” Steve told him softly. He sighed, and squeezed Tony’s shoulder, letting the man drop his head so he could rest against Steve’s forearm. Tony’s skin was clammy, feverish against his. “But you can do this. I know you can. You’re a hero. You can still help people.”
Steve winced. Tony’s expression was tight, irritated. It wouldn’t take much for it to slid into suspicion. “I’ll be healed soon.”
The Hydra Supreme had come alone, a solitary figure in black. He was an intimidating figure as he stepped into the atrium; his footsteps were cat-like, barely making a whisper. Steve’s eyes were trained on him, muscles tensing in preparation. The Hydra Supreme grinned; a fearsome red skull stretched out across his torso proudly. In the far corner of the atrium, Tony had disappeared and Steve felt something relax in his chest slightly.
“I know. Steve’s memories were rewritten. Reality was changed. They made him think he was a Hydra sleeper cell.” Tony’s voice was slow, controlled as if this was an explanation about just another one of the enemies they had faced together. But Steve could hear the edge to his words, the curtness to his explanation. This AI version of Tony may have had more time to acclimatise to the reality of a Hydra loyal Steve but it didn’t mean he was dealing with it any better than Steve was.
“Ok.” Steve’s cheeks were pink again, the corner of his mouth twitching as if he had overheard something funny and was trying not to give his eavesdropping away. He let himself relax once again, spreading out further around Tony until Tony thought he was going to try and envelope him. Tony’s eyelids were heavy, sluggish and instead, he found himself tilting his head towards Steve’s fingers, the curve of his cheek coming to rest against them.
Tony shrugged, “Hard to know. Maybe you’ll snap right back to your own time or maybe you’ll be keelhauled around the space-time continuum for a bit first. You’d think this would be something Rogers would have mentioned to his team.”
The nurse told Maria that she couldn’t enter the operating theatre and would have to wait outside until it was over. Unlike most of the other staff in the hospitals, the nurse had seemed unmoved by his mother; indifferent to her wringing hands and tear sparkling eyes. Maria had watched as Tony was wheeled into the theatre, a slender figure in a sunflower yellow dress, silent but almost vibrating. Tony had almost forgotten his worries about what was about to happen to him, his attention focused on his mother’s bright, feverish eyes. She had smiled at the nurse easily, her expression pleasantly vague and Tony knew she was furious.
“I would never...” Steve turned the face, Tony, blinking at weak blue light pouring off the AI. He shook his head, jaw clenching. “I would never willing join Hydra.”
There a pinch, a shock of static electricity against his shoulder, jolting him literally from his thoughts.
Steve smiled grimly, already knowing what had happened. Already knowing what his reaction would be to Tony’s offer. “He said no.”
Tony hummed, “I’ve never heard of him. Is he just a comic book superhero? Because you know Captain America was real and my dad says Cap’s comic books are a load of bullcrap anyway.”
Iron Man placed a hand on Steve’s shoulder, squeezing gently for one long moment as if he couldn’t quite bear to let go. “I can’t tell you how glad I am to see you, Winghead.”
Steve smiled and made his way over, carefully but quickly starting his search. Tony wasn’t sure what exactly he was looking for, and wasn’t sure what Howard had kept. Howard would never have allowed a child’s sticky fingers near his prized keepsakes. The only reason Tony had any idea what was in the cabinet was because he had fumbled through it as a teenager looking for his father’s whiskey.
It was a child, barely bigger than a toddler with a head of wild dark curls and big, tired looking eyes. He was curiously not wearing shoes and had to keep hopping from one foot to another, trying to avoid standing on the molten tarmac too long. Deciding the child wasn’t an immediate threat, Steve relaxed and sat up gingerly. Other than the road he was lying on, there were no visible landmarks. Sandwiching the highway were fields of swaying corn, stretching out as far as the eye could eye see.
Steve shifted, the noise a whisper in the darkness. The movement was too far away, too quiet for Tony to hear him, and yet he did. Tony twisted; the move strangely serpentine. His hand dropped, the photograph disappearing into the folds of his jacket. His expression was neutral, impossible to read by the time his gaze found Steve.
A muscle twitched in Tony’s jaw, eyes moving guilty.  “I made him a forcefield to go around the earth to stop the Chitarui getting in. I didn’t realise, I was locking us in too. If I hadn’t set up the Defence Shield, he wouldn’t have been able to take control. Carol, Quasar - they all would be here and not locked out in space fighting a war they can’t win.”
Tony smirked, a snake-smile. “Oh, will you? How will you be doing that? Are you going to beat me into submission again Steve?”
Tony blinked, cheeks colouring with embarrassment. “I guess what I’m trying to say is thank you for rescuing me.”
Tony shook his head, grabbing Steve’s wrist before the man could pull away. “No, it’s fine. It’s nice.”
Distracted by his thoughts, Steve didn’t notice as Tony wiggled closer, shuffling so he was tucked under Steve’s armpit. Steve let his arm curl around Tony, drawing him closer. The feeling of holding the other man was nice.  Tony pressed a soft, lazy kiss to the edge of Steve’s jaw, lips burning Steve’s skin. His next kiss landed on Steve’s mouth. Steve made a noise of protest, tilting his head. He misjudged the movement and it opened him up for Tony’s advances, the man’s tongue tracing the seam of his lips. Steve breathed in surprise and let Tony kiss him. His moment of indecision kindled the fire in his stomach and blood rushed away from his brain. Steve groaned and kissed Tony back, thoughtlessly chased the feeling. The kiss between them lasted too long. Before Steve even realised it, their kiss had depended from something soft and sleepy to something more aggressive, more desperate.  Steve inhaled sharply as Tony shifted. He was aroused, his hardness pressing against Steve’s leg.
Steve forced himself to relax, holding out his hands, “Hey, I’m not here to hurt you. I know your father. I’m here to help you.”
Tony was still talking, his face tilted up towards the night sky, seeking stars that disappeared with the bright city lights. “I’ve always just been too much of a coward to tell him.”
“Wow, you were hungry,” Tony said. Steve made an agreeing noise, cheeks stuffed with food. Tony laughed fondly and switched on the TV facing them from across the room.
Ahead of him, a guard glanced back, his eyebrow raised at Steve’s language. Steve didn’t wait. He surged forward, breaking away from the SHIELD agents easily. In one stride he had twisted, shoulder coming down like a battering ram as he ran straight at the guard’s torso. The man went down fast, dropping out of the sniper’s range. And then the bullet hit Steve. It cut deep into his neck, just missing his carotid artery. Fire cut through him, spreading like glass fractures through his skin. He gurgled blood and stumbled, knocked off balance by the force of the blow. Around him, people were screaming, running. Panic hung in the air, almost tangible.
“Papa feels really bad about it and he’s getting some help so he won’t ever hurt me by accident again.”
The coffee machine pinged distantly in the background and Tony remained still, fighting with himself.
Peter turned his face into his Daddy’s shirt as Papa walked out the room, unable to watch as he left them.
“Where should I start?” Steve asked softly and Tony jumped, forgetting for a moment the man was next to him.
Steve couldn’t watch; it wasn’t right to see Tony like this, so broken and hurt. Especially not when it was another him’s fault. Steve turned away from the one-way-mirror. He looked at his arms, still clad in a black Hydra uniform. Both he and Tony knew what the Hydra Supreme had threatened, what he had insinuated. Steve couldn’t bear to continue wearing the same colours as him. He pressed the button on his band, sighing at black melted away, revealing his normal suit.
“Breathe,” The nurse ordered and Tony blinked in confusion, sweat dripping into his eyes. The tube inside him twisted, a sharp knife of pain breaking through the pressurized, dizzying ache and he yelped like a dog.
“Sorry, sir I did not mean to… interrupt you.” The way the agent said ‘interrupt’ sent the hairs on Steve’s arm upright. He wondered sickly what exactly the agent thought he was interrupting.
“A year, give or take.” A third member of the group spoke. Sam Wilson, Falcon. He had his hand resting reassuring on Sharon’s back, caring as always.
Steve should have noticed the sniper earlier. He should have known something was off. But his thoughts were scattered, pulled apart by an unfamiliar sense of self-doubt which had tormented him since his arrest. Unlike Tony’s utilitarianism, Steve had always let him sense of duty, of right and wrong dictate his actions. And usually he had found it easy to figure out what was right. Steve had been so certain that he doing the right thing, self-assured despite the price. But in the settling dust of SHRA, of the civil war, Steve found himself standing in the ruins of his life and wondering if it was all worth it.
Half through colouring the Hulk – a great giant mass of green felt tip with a little Bruce-Stick-Man standing in his palm – Peter felt his eyes droop. He looked at his Captain America sheets wearily, running his palm over his Papa’s cartoon face, and decided he wanted the real thing.
Tony looked like he was going to say more when a sharp alarm sounded around the room. Steve jumped to his feet, wincing at the pain the movement caused him.
Tony’s eyes lifted open once again, pained. “Because the real Steve Rogers doesn’t want anything to do with me at the moment.”
“You miss him,” Steve said. They were sat close, facing each other from opposite ends of the couch. In the background, the TV was playing music, something orchestral, soothing. The lights around them were dim, soft. The sleek, white room felt almost cosy, inviting.
Tony snorted, “Yeah well, this Tony Stark is a pathetic alcoholic with no money and no friends. I’m nobody’s role model.”
“They are fighting in the streets; people are killing themselves.” Steve snapped, voice climbing, “they don’t look normal, they look –”
“Definitely not his best work,” Tony repeated, nudging the robot with his booted toe. A long shadow moved across the sky, accompanied by a familiar whirl of engines. Tony risked a look away from the waiting doombots to see the sleek crisp lines of the avengers’ jet hovering above him.
“No, he’s not.” Steve snapped; his anger surprised the occupants of the room. Bucky crossed his arms, looking troubled. Even Steve wasn’t sure where his response had come from. The last thing he remembered was being led in handcuff to his own trail. Steve might have surrendered to Tony but it didn’t make sense to want to suddenly defend the man, and yet Steve did. Something hot, dark was burning in his gut at the thought of Tony. Familiar and yet undefinable.
“Oh, I am,” Tony said. The Iron Man suit had melted off his skin, liquid metal floating around him as started to circle Steve. “I’m just helping myself to a little something extra on the side. It’s a win-win situation. I keep you alive and you give me the secrets to your super serum.”
Bruce remained absent, he wouldn’t risk the hulk for a dozen poorly made robots but Tony knew was on standby: in the jet above them, on the comms and ready to take action.
There was something about the way F.R.I.D.A.Y. had announced the intruder. Neither the A.I. nor Tony had seemed that concerned. If anything, Tony had seemed… excited.
“Oh,” Tony didn’t know how to respond, he felt off-kilter, surprised by Steve’s mention of his father and his words dried up as he tried to realign himself within the conversation. Tony looked back at the coffee cup, almost able to see his mother’s delicate hand curled around it, pushing it towards him, urging him to drink up to settle his stomach. He wondered what Steve would think if he told him that his mother used to give him coffee when he was four years old.
The Hydra Supreme made the next move, advancing hard on Steve. Steve was panting, the wound in his side aching, sapping his energy as he struggled to ward off the lightning-fast blows coming from the electric baton. The baton went left and Steve twisted, catching it with his shield. The movement sent a hot twist of pain through him and he was slow, unsteady as he tried to re-centre himself.
Tony glanced over at Steve’s perfect, blonde profile. He couldn’t have envisioned this being his reason.
Maria was a beautiful crier. He eyes got bigger, more lustrous with tears and the enticing fragility that had drawn Howard and a number of other men to her seemed to get more pronounced. The doctor, when he arrived spent the first 10 minutes cupping her tiny hands in his and reassuring her that he would fix things, that she didn’t need to worry anymore.
Everyone else was easy. The little Tony-Stick-Figure was hot red and highlighted with golden glitter. Little Steve-Stick-Figure was covered in white sticky stars, complete with matching shield, and the little stick figure that was meant to represent him was purple, because that was his favourite colour. Jarvis however…
It was painfully easy to gain entry into the Triskelion. Everything was coded to Steve’s DNA and the scurrying Hydra minions were too afraid to question why the Hydra Supreme was walking around alone. Steve’s heart was beating like a drum in his chest, almost rabbit-like as he marched through the Triskelion atrium. The flying eagle of S.H.I.E.L.D. which had once arched across the marble atrium floor was gone, crudely painted over by the hollow-eyed Hydra Skull. Steve clenched his fists at sight, leather cracking with his anger.
“Steve.” Tony breathed. His eyes went wide, huge in his face. Steve had always thought that Tony’s eyes gave him away, too revealing for him to be as cold and detached as he wanted to be. Maybe that was why Tony liked sunglasses so much. He could see himself reflected in Tony’s eyes, half dead on his feet, covered in his own blood.
Nearby voices suddenly echoed around the alley, dragging Steve out of his thoughts. Two dark shadows had stopped near the entrance, close enough to hear but too far to fully make out their faces.
His smile stalled half way and Peter found himself staring at the big dark mark across his Daddy’s jaw. It was really bad, it looked like he’d got purple and red crayons and rubbed them together all over his cheek. His cheek was so swollen his eye was squinting. Peter’s felt his throat lock up miserably as last night came rushing back to him. Daddy sometimes had other bruises, he said they were from avengers missions but maybe they weren’t, maybe Papa had hit him then too.
“I don’t think I could do it again. Last time nearly destroyed me.” Tony was saying, his voice distant with memories.
At home, Maria ordered Jarvis and the chefs through the changes needed to ensure Tony’s safety. All of Tony’s food had to be specially prepared and stored. Gone were his ice cream trips, the thoughtlessly stolen fruit from the fruit bowels, his fizzy soda. His mother caught one of the maids slipping him a jelly snake one afternoon and had fired the girl on the spot, holding the candy against the crying woman’s face and asking in near hysterics if she was trying to kill Tony. After that, the staff were much more careful. There were locks on the fridge, on the cupboards and all Tony’s food had to be overseen and approved by his mother, provided alongside his medication and new happy coloured vitamin pills.
The morning Steve had been led up those courthouse steps, he had let go of Tony. Given him up, like one would release a bird to the wild.
Tony was silent for a moment, there was something in his face, a theory not quite articulated. He bit his lip, the expression strange considering he was made out of pixel.  “Now that I’ve stopped trying to bring you here, you won’t jump as fast and it should stop hurting as much,”
“Peter, I love your Daddy very much. I did hurt him, it was an accident but I still feel really terrible about it. I hate that I did that to him, I hate that you saw that.” Papa’s voice cracked and a tear fell down his face. Peter didn’t think he’d ever seen his Papa cry before. “I’m really proud of you for trying to protect your Daddy, it was really brave. I’m sorry I scared you. Do you think you can forgive me?”
Tony shuddered, body spasming as if he was going to throw up again. He turned away from Steve sharply, leaning against the wall. After a few minutes, the violent shivers passed and Tony slumped, panting with exhaustion.
“You need to run to it now. Go through the field and don’t stop until you get there. You need to stop the first car you see, tell them who you are and that you were kidnapped. Tell them you need help, that you are being chased.”
Steve was silent. He cracked his neck slowly, balancing on the balls of his feet, energy thrumming through his limbs as he waited. He didn’t often think he was a violent man, but he thought he might enjoy teaching these men exactly how scared the child they had kidnapped had been.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you Tesoro.” She told him, voice catching. “I was just upset. You made the doctor think you weren’t sick and I’m worried for you.”
Steve smiled unwittingly; hell, the kid was cute. They had started walking, moving slowly up the road. Tony was dancing around him, obviously desperate for the company. Steve wondered sadly how long he had been alone, how scared he must have been to find the company of a stranger so pleasing.
Bucky’s words were a comfort, a homecoming but Steve felt a bone-deep sense of regret. Unfounded, and all-consuming. He closed his eyes, drowning, confused in the sensation. He should be happy he was here; he was back in his time with friends. They had obviously been working to save him. But he felt sad, bereft. Like there was something missing. Steve frowned; he was forgetting something. Something important.
“Tony, stop. I know you don’t want to fight to me, not again. That didn’t work remember? You need me. We’re better when we’re working together not in conflict. People get hurt when we fight.”
“The asset’s room. And the viewing room.” The man said gesturing the to the two doors.  “Is there anything -
Tony sat quietly in the doctor’s waiting room, listening to the coughing and sneezing of the waiting patients around him.
“Jesus.” Steve hissed. Like his bedfellows, Tony was completely naked, shameless as he stood bare in front of Steve. His eyes slanted off to the side of the room, his cheeks burning. “Put some clothes on!”
The Hydra agents scattered, boots stomping across the marble floor. Steve remained still, trying not to let his desperation, his nervousness show as the men streamed past him. Tony, who had been watching this from his safe nook appeared at the edge of the atrium, moving slowly out the corner of Steve's eye.
It had been Jarvis who had prepared him for those visits, who had taken him away afterwards to soothe him and provide reassurance. His mother had grown jealous and cold at the encroaching interference of Howard and would ignore the summons, taking Tony off to ice cream parlours and doctors’ appointments instead. She would ignore Tony afterward, looking at Tony as if he had betrayed her somehow. The first time his parents had ever argued it had been about those visits. All their subsequent arguments had been him too: about who got to have him.
“You’ve been gone a long time,” Bucky said. He held out his hand, palm up, fingers spread. It was a familiar gesture; one they had done a hundred times throughout the war and after. A signal of their friendship. Steve only hesitated a second before taking Bucky’s hand. The man dragged him closer, squeezing his hand hard. “I’m really glad you’re back Stevie.”
“I think you must be missing some memories if you think that Tony would blindly follow me.” Steve snorted.
“And, I know we don’t talk about it but I know Howard was… difficult as he got older. You probably don’t want to talk about it with me but I'm here if you ever do.”
It was easy to be with the man. He was sharp and sometimes strangely cold, different in ways that made Steve’s chest hurt. But he retained Tony’s magnetism; that special type of charisma that had drawn people to him his entire life; that made them worship him, love him. Steve felt drunk on Tony’s attention. He was a man drowning after so long without water. Gods, he had missed this, missed Tony
Before he could fall, Tony was at his side, sliding under his arm, holding him upright. “Hey, hey. I’ve got you. Stay with me,” Tony said. He was almost cooing, the words soothing. He moved them, somehow easily manhandling Steve so could lie down on Tony’s bed. Steve stared up at him, panting in exertion. The pain was fading, simmering beneath the surface.
Tony wiggled sleepily, nose pressing into the dip of Steve’s neck. “Will you be here when I wake up?” he asked, voice husky with sleep.
Steve felt every muscle in his body clench in anger. Tony’s flirtations with lechery had always annoyed him, another failing of a fallible man but at least Tony had never rubbed Steve’s nose in his exploits before. Tony had been up here enjoying himself with this young couple while Steve lay unconscious, bleeding a floor beneath him. Steve had woken up alone, thinking he was in a prison.
“Why haven’t you sent people in after him?” Steve asked, his voice sharp. If Hydra had had Tony for three days, they should have been going after him, rescuing him before something bad happened.
Sharon stumbled away from him, catching the edge of the examining table before she could fall down. Her face red, eyes bloodshot as she coughed. She twisted to look up at him, her eyes bright through the wayward strands of blonde hair. “We brought you back.” She gasped.
As soon as the boy said his name, it was obvious. His dark hair, blue eyes and full mouth were nearly as familiar to Steve as his own face. Fierce intelligence illuminated the boy’s narrow face and Steve recognised the way emotions flashed across his features; a thousand micro expressions moving at the speed of light.
Steve swallowed and slowly slid off Tony, hands raised up in surrender. Tony sat upright, confused and wary.
The image of the screen changed; Tony’s face replaced by the Triskelion. It loomed against the sky, blocking the sun. Seared into the pale walls like a brand was the dark symbol of Hydra. Steve’s jaw clenched in anger at the sight of it. Hydra had taken Shield’s most secure base, because of him.
“Oh, leave him be, Jarvis.” Maria interrupted, waving her hand dismissively, “His stomach is probably feeling a bit unsettled, isn’t that right Anthony?”
“Leave now.” Steve interrupted, waving a hand at the agent. The man hesitated and Steve raised an eyebrow at him, sending him bobbing and shuffling away. Steve watched him go, waiting until he had disappeared around a corner before turning back to the two doors.
“It’s been so hard on Tony. He’s been so ill and we’ve had no answers. No one seems to know what is wrong with him.”
He’d managed to twist the sheets around him and was clawing at them desperately. They weren’t a match for his strength and he ripped them apart easily, writhing in the torn remains.
Or at least it felt like he was falling, his stomach was riding high in his rib cage, adrenaline rushing through his system. He tried to throw out his arms out to balance himself only to meet resistance from the tight cuffs around his wrists, his arms locked tight behind his back. Shock waves rattled painfully up his forearms.
Maria deflated. She dropped to the floor with a sob, prostrating herself next to his bed as she might start praying to him. Tony flinched at the movement, nervousness churning into worry. He knew that this was his fault, that his mother was upset because of him, for him. He struggled an arm out of the tight covers and reached for her hand. She snatched up his fingers, kissing his hot little fingers with a miserable desperation.
The night before his court date he had laid awake in his jail cell. His thoughts a carousel, going around and around the events of their war. Steve had been trying to figure out the moment when things went wrong. Trying to pinpoint when their relationship had become unsalvageable. He wondered when killing Tony had become something he could even consider. The morning had dawned with Steve no closer to any answers and he had trudged, weary and beaten, towards his trial.
Tony exhaled loudly; a sob hidden at the edges of his ragged breath. He nodded, the movement violent with determination, “I will save him.”
The picture on the wall focused and Steve blinked at his own curious face. He titled his head and the image of him on screen copied the move. Snorting in realisation, Steve waved cheerfully at himself.
Steve smiled tentatively, his face lighting up like the sun. He stepped closer, a hand reaching for Tony and then falling short, resting just shy of Tony’s own hand on the table. Their fingers were an inch apart, close enough that Tony could feel the heat coming off Steve’s skin.  “You make me happy all the time. God knows what I would have done without you, Shellhead.”
“Tony, wait.” Steve reached out, big hand curling easily around Tony’s wrist. Tony didn’t bother to try and break away, not that he had a choice if Steve wanted him to stay.
More times than was healthy. But having super soldier serum had made him brave, careless and he had lost the fear that a bullet would kill him. Or at least, that it would kill him instantly. Familiarity didn’t make a bullet hurt any less and bullets hurt a lot.
Even as he spoke, the avengers were dropping into formation around him; Clint found a perch on a nearby car roof, Natasha and Cap had landed behind him, herding the doombots together.
Papa snapped around to face the voice, his eyes still wide and unseeing. Daddy took a step backwards but Papa was already leaping to his feet, closing the gap between them faster than Peter had ever seen anyone move and grabbing the smaller man by the shoulder.
Tony hadn’t been in his father’s study since the night his parents had died. He had stumbled drunkenly, grief-stricken, through the manor, hoping he might storm into the study and his father would be bent over his desk, eyes flashing at the interruption.
Steve’s eyelids were stuck together, tacky with sleep. He peeled them open slowly, hissing at the prickling sensation. In the background F.R.I.D.A.Y. continue to run through statistics, her lilting voice soothing as Steve wavered on the edge of consciousness
Tony snorted and closed his eyes, head leaning back to rest uncaringly against the damp, moss-covered wall. “This is a hallucination, isn’t it?”
Hurt flashed across Tony’s face. He sent a stiff smile in Steve’s direction and Steve grimaced, realising he had mis-stepped.
As he grew, an increasing carousel of minor sore throats, stomach issues, migraines, and fevers plagued him. His spells of dizziness abated, but in its place came intermittent stomach issues: nausea, pain, and diarrhoea. Tony wasn’t always sick. Some days he ran and played, forgetting until scolded that he needed to be careful, that he wasn’t well. Other days, his sickness was undeniable.
Tony felt his mouth fall open, shock robbing him of his words for a second. Whatever he thought Steve was going to say, he hadn’t expected that. “Excuse me?”
“Men are like that, they eat and drink and fuck like animals, unable to control themselves. And I’m left to pick up the scraps.”
Steve pressed the heel of his hand into Tony’s sternum hard, flattening the man to the bed. Tony went silent, breathless under the pressure. “Actually, this is me. The real me. There’s no magic, no spell. This isn’t something you can fix. It’s real.”
He wanted, in that moment, nothing more than to get himself a drink. A martini, or wine or straight-up vodka for all he cared. Just anything that could slow down the furious sharp edges of his whirling, sleep-deprived mind. It was how he had always dealt with things previously. Well, alcohol and sex. It had been too long since he’d had either.
“No.” Tony tried to turn away but Steve held him tight, grasping his head easily with one hand. He seemed amused by Tony’s efforts rather than annoyed at him, laughing as Tony hissed like an angry cat at him.
Steve reached out slowly, half expecting his fingers to slide through the shield like it was an illusion. He touched the cool viburnum, feeling it vibrate through his fingers. He smiled at it, heart lifting. It felt like home. He looked back over at Tony; the A.I. had his hands to face, almost vibrating with expectation. “How?” Steve asked.
“I just said, if you have air support, why—okay, okay, fine,” Steve cut himself off at Tony’s reproaching glare, then smiled and laid his head back on the pillow.  His hand was tracing a path up and down Tony’s back, tangling a bit in the hair at Tony’s nape on each pass.
“Don’t.  Just don’t,” Tony snapped in a hard, brusque tone.  He brushed past Steve and bent to pick up his golf ball, before turning back and giving Steve a long, measuring look.  “I don’t like it when people touch my stuff.”
“I guess you could say it became something of a mission in life to find you,” Tony said, eyes on Steve. “Then, I did, and, well.”
The alien pulled away, leaving Tony feeling suddenly bereft and adrift, though the calmness remained.  Tony blinked up at the alien and breathed out a shaky breath. The alien sat up, gave Tony a forlorn look, then waved his hand and the not-gel rippled and peeled back again, leaving Tony free, albeit still very naked and, well, half-hard, but who was really counting?
Tony looked down at him, an expression of such tender yearning crossing his features that Steve reached up to touch Tony’s cheek, as if he could brush it away.  “Tell me that you are happy, my treasure,” Tony said, his voice flat, almost emotionless, but his face was tight and his eyes heavy with a desolate sort of longing.
It was taking a long time, actually.  Tony shifted his knees a bit on the flat cushion.  Maybe they should’ve tried for the bed after all.
The beeping pattern of the unlock code was all the warning he had before Rhodey slammed the door open and stalked over, grabbing the back of his chair and spinning Tony around so Rhodey could loom over him, which he liked to do sometimes, because, really, the guy flew jets and stuff, so compact was not just an adjective, but a job requirement.
“I know you did, Howard,” Peggy said.  Steve watched here throat work as she struggled with the words.  “I wanted him home, too.  But none of that is Tony’s fault.”  Her voice was steady there, clear. The same voice Steve remembered hearing truths from in a burned out shell of a London pub.
He was standing on a platform, Howard’s machine around him, just like when he closed his eyes, except now, he was in some other lab and Howard’s machine was scattered around the room in plastic-shrouded pieces.  Shuri’s bright, streamlined screens and consoles were gone. Instead, huge panels of black screens lined with green letters and numbers scrolling through some kind of sequence sat in front of empty office chairs. A bank of machines stood to one side, whirring loudly, with large, square-shaped red and green buttons on the front.
. The universe brought you to me, Steve.  The future, whatever it is, we’ll deal with it.  Together.”
“Tony, you don’t need to do that, really,” Steve protested at the same time. “It’s fine.  Bucky’s fine, we can come by tomorrow—"
“Come on. Let’s get you home,” Steve urged, turning Tony towards the SUV when the black-clad driver hopped out to open the door.
“Of course, Sir,” Jarvis responded and damn if the AI didn’t sound pleased.  Steve shook his head.  He was probably projecting. It wasn’t long before Jarvis was telling him that Happy was waiting, and soon enough, Steve found himself back at the apartment.
“Maybe,” Tony answered honestly.  “I don’t know. Have at it.  All yours.  The coffee, I mean.  It—you can have it.  I have—I need---there’s work.  For me.  My work. So, I’m just going to go.  Because of the work.”  Smooth.  Completely believable.  Natasha could take lessons.  He closed his eyes in abject horror and pushed himself off where he reclined against the counter, heading for the stairs that led down to his workshop.
“You just take all the time you need to sit there and think of a reason why—or who—might've been the reason for that,” Rhodey told him in a quiet, carefully neutral tone, sounding almost regretful about delivering what probably should be good news, but what managed to sound like a horror story.
“This way, Mr. Stark,” the man, whom Tony assumed was the head of the Development Office.  “We cannot tell you how pleased we are that you’ve decided to—“
“Calm down there, Mother Theresa.  Not that I wasn’t enjoying the whole public transit thing,” Tony said.    “It was great. Really.  Happy, don’t knock it, I’m telling you.  Sure, I have the sudden urge to compost.  Is that normal?  Should I get a rain barrel?  Too late for an Al Gore bumper sticker?  We need to stop at Whole Foods.  I’m craving granola.”
“I don’t flail,” Tony said with a frown.  “I should get Steve to show me some moves.  Like basic—oh, that sounded bad.  Desk?”
“I was thinking of setting them up on the balcony.  Maybe do something with the Strip, I don’t know,” Steve said.
“We will,” Tony corrected. “I don’t know how to…how to think of this place,” Tony gritted out, looking down and away from where Steve stood next to him. “What was done here, in my name.  It is almost too horrible to comprehend, yet it brought you to me, and I cannot reconcile those things, except to say that both are true.  Life and death.  If those things have a home, this is it.  An end and a beginning.   At least, I hope that is what it will be.  That is all I have to offer, pitiable recompense though it may be.”
“You mean did I ask why the Bonding of a mere Army Captain was a national security matter that required the Director of SHIELD, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and people with titles I’m not supposed to know exist?  Yes.  Yes, Anthony, I asked,” she replied, a rebuke stinging through her words.
The armor didn’t allow just the groin piece to come off.  In retrospect, a glaring design flaw that he should really remedy as soon as possible.  Which meant they needed to get back to the Tower.  The team could handle the rest of the mop-up.  Or not.  Really, midtown could use some renovation.
“Eh, yeah.  Just a stray shipment bound for Incirlik that somehow ended up outside Uruzgan,” Tony explained.  “Marines found it by accident.  On some farm that was a front for moving supplies to the Taliban in Deh Rawood.  Got lost and stopped for directions, can you believe it?”
“And honestly, Tones?” Rhodey continued.  “This whole marriage thing has thrown Obadiah and everyone else totally off whatever suspicions they might have had about your sudden interest in glad-handing in Vegas.  He’s in town for the gala thing tomorrow night. So is Pierce.  Consider it a good opportunity to assuage any of their concerns that you’re anything other than some half-drunk playboy who found himself a boy-toy at a Vegas strip club to keep himself busy while not paying attention to anything else going on.  So, ogle Steve and act oblivious.  I feel like you can do that.”
A moment later, Steve felt a wet hand cover his and give it a light squeeze.  He looked over at Shellhead, who husked out a chittering, crooning noise that seemed to reverberate through his chest. Steve wasn’t sure what Shellhead was trying to communicate, but it sounded a bit like an admonishment.
“Right. Well, actually, the guy I talked to, Professor Thorne, he works mainly with some kind of observatories in Louisiana and Washington, I think he said, though he does most of his research from here,” Steve explained.  “Seemed like a nice guy. He’s going to be the one actually giving you the tour.”
“Breathe.  You’re making me nervous.  Look, its fine.  Good even.  Really,” Tony assured him at Steve’s rather incredulous look.  “Pep’s not even mad.”
They talked through the rest of the toast and two more cups of truly awful coffee. At some point, Tony resolved to have a new coffee maker delivered to the place out of a sheer sense of duty to the caffeine gods. Steve’s eyes finally flicked up to the clock behind the cash register, and he gave a quick little grimace that he tried to hide around the last sip of his coffee.
“Oh,” Tony said, seemingly at a loss for words. Then, just as suddenly, it was like the sun broke over the horizon. Tony’s face lit up with unbridled joy, the kind that Steve thought he rarely got to enjoy. “You do,” he breathed out, relief and happiness seemingly at war in his voice. Tony wanted this. More than even Steve realized. Maybe it was a cruelty, after all, Steve thought, but it was too late to take it back, even if he wanted to.
Howard was watching the whole thing like a he’d been pulled out of the audience into some kind of show he wasn’t supposed to be a part of and had no idea where to stand or what to say.  He watched his father pick up the ubiquitous tumbler from the edge of the billiards table and take a drink that lasted a little too long, then pick up the decanter to pour himself another.   Not because his was empty, Tony noticed, but to give himself something to do.
He did it again, pushing his fingers in deeper, relishing the burn and stretch.  Then again, finding a rhythm he liked. He stopped long enough to slather more fluid on his fingers as it dripped down from his cock.  It wasn’t enough, but it wasn’t not enough, either. With his other hand he twisted his nipple again. Harder this time, tugging at it a bit in time with the thrust of his fingers.  A long, low moan escaped him. He felt wanton. Shameless. Unmoored as he drifted on a haze of unfiltered pleasure, pure and sweet, and unburdened by needing to process what anyone else thought about it.  All he had to do was be good for Tony, and he was. So good. His cock pulsed and throbbed to the point of pain, but the desire to touch himself there was gone, replaced by a need to touch himself everywhere else.
“Dum-E and U like the poster, too,” Tony added.  “Can robots develop crushes? Is this like robot porn?  Am I contributing to the delinquency of a ‘bot?  They should put that on the Turing test.  Be more interesting than ‘Tell me about your hair,’ at least, though, I suppose, if you were an A.I.—“
Bucky always said he was good at keeping parts of himself locked away from the world.  There was a bird—a jay, Steve thought—that lived for a while under the awning of the tenement that liked to steal bits and pieces of things.  The wax paper that candy came in on the rare occasion someone was lucky enough to get a treat. Thread, sometimes. Steve saw it take a button once, right out of the sewing basket Mrs. O’Malley was using to mend her daughter’s dress.  When Steve told Bucky about it, Bucky said he was like the bird, wanting to hide away his bits and pieces, Steve remembered, though Steve didn’t think Bucky quite knew just how much that was true. Maybe that was what he was doing with this.  Hiding away something precious so no one could find it.
“Yeah.  Yeah, I guess so,” Bucky repeated, then groaned.  “He’s crazy about you, you know that, right?”
Tony stopped the motion before the—what was it this time?  Wrench, he noticed, looking down at his hand.  Before the wrench hit the edge of the workstation again, where it was clanging out a sharp, staccatoed echo in the garage.
“Thanks. Again.  For the car, I mean,” Tony said, trying to keep his voice neutral as he maneuvered from the ramp onto the freeway Frogger-style as Steve sucked in a breath and pursed his lips, probably wishing for some pearls to clutch.  “And the license thing.  You didn’t have to.”
“Considering last night, I’m not sure if I should be flattered or offended,” Steve replied in a flat voice.
“OH MY FUCKING GOD, YOU HEARD ME!?!” Tony shouted, bringing both hands up to each side of his face and, well, trying to crush his skull or whatever would make the last thirty seconds disappear from reality.  He could feel his face catch fire with horrified embarrassment.  “Oh my God, you
Tony let his eyes slide closed, blowing out a huff of air, not quite sure if it was frustration or resignation.  Probably both.  He knew he could press the issue.  He wasn’t sure if it wouldn’t be kinder in the long run not to let Steve just walk away from this, chalk it up to too much drink, too much exhaustion, too few inhibitions.  He could, he knew.  Hell, he was familiar enough with Steve and his reactions that he had a fair idea what was flailing through the poor guy’s head at this moment, and he could use that, push a little, scrabble at whatever walls Steve wanted to throw at him.  Because he knew, he fucking knew, how Steve responded to him.  He may not know much else, but he knew that.
One of Tony’s hands wound into his hair, angling his head, and the other moved down his back, over his spine, to grip his hip, fingers splaying downwards, pulling him closer until he was pressed full length against Tony and there was nothing chaste about this now.  The feel of Tony, fully clothed, pressed against his naked flesh did nothing to help calm him.  There was certainly no doubting Tony’s interest.
“I made that myself!  That was a great card!” Tony protested, swiveling in his seat.  “When you solved the equation and graphed it out, the lines intersected.  I can’t wait to intersect--how is that not funny?” Tony demanded, throwing his hand up in the air.  He shot a look at the middle-aged man in a rumpled suit sitting on the seat opposite them, who was giving Tony a befuddled stare.  “It’s funny, right?  He thinks it’s funny,” Tony asserted to Steve.
He was thankful, again, for the anonymity the robes and veil offered.  As elaborate as they were, they allowed him to all but disappear into the role he had been given.  The King’s Prize. The foreign concubine who had so entranced the King. Nameless.  Faceless. No one. Anyone, everyone. He belonged to the King, yes, but the story belonged to each of them. An image that each of them could conjure on their own.  That was who they came to see. That was the story they wanted. So, Tony gave it to them.  And in return, they showered Steve with an adoration that bordered on fanatic. Tony had warned him, before they left, that word of him had spread and to expect the interest.  Tony worried it would unnerve him, Steve thought. He wasn’t sure how to tell Tony that of all of this, this part was the most familiar.
He couldn’t watch, but he couldn’t entirely look away either.  He focused on Steve’s face.  His eyes.  Steve was watching Tony with a heavy-lidded expression, tight-lipped, skin pulled too taut over his bones.  Pain, Tony thought.  Pain and determination.  He knew that look.  He’d seen it in the mirror.
“Thanks, Agent Paz.  I’m sure SI would appreciate the opportunity to compete.  Tony, he’s got all these amazing ideas.  You wouldn’t believe some of the things he talks about.  It’s all way above my head,” Steve said, giving the agents what Tony thought of as Steve’s aw-shucks grin.  Tony clamped his mouth shut and narrowed his eyes, watching Steve charm the agents through things like requisitions and cost-plus-fixed-fee arrangements like he was shilling used cars.
Finally, Tony tore his mouth away.  His lips were red and swollen, still wet from Steve’s, his hair askew and his eyes so dark they were nearly black. I did that to him, Steve thought.  Steve could feel his cock judder in Tony’s hand in response. I did that. I made him feel like that. Amazed wonder and desperate want coursed through him.  He wasn’t sure which one felt better.
“Well, how about you start acting like it?” Fury suggested, seemingly unconcerned by Steve’s response.
With a sigh, Steve started to heave himself up and crawl out of the burrow.  He stopped, something catching his eye in the morning sun. There was a shell sitting by his head, almost the size of his hand, flattened out almost like a butterfly’s wing with whorls of dark purples, blues, and greys swirling in a sea of opalescence.  Steve reached for it, held it up to the light and watched the sun reflect a rainbow across the iridescent lining. It would have housed some kind of mollusk at some time, Steve assumed, but now, it was nothing but a relic. Steve remembered seeing baskets of them back in port where they were made into jewelry or decorative pieces to be shipped to Europe, New York or other far flung places.  It was pretty, nothing more. Steve supposed that was enough.
Tony slid his hand into Steve’s and climbed out, gazing around at the crowd of people filing into the hall in pairs and small groups.  Around him, camera’s flashed and clicked.  He hadn’t really thought about photographers being here, but he supposed it made sense.  There were a lot of important people in attendance, at least based on Steve’s mental list.  Not like reality TV star kind of important, but still.  Tony felt Steve wrap his hand around Steve’s outstretched elbow, and realized he’d been standing there like it was his first time facing the Kodak soul-stealer or something.  He sucked in a breath and straightened his shoulders, looking up at Steve only to find Steve watching him with an expression that made Tony’s mouth go dry.
“So you…” Tony started, groping for the string of conversation.  “You, ah…illegal concessions, fights…bit of a rabble-rouser in your misspent youth, huh?”
“There’s Happy,” Steve said quickly and pulled his arm from where he’d looped it through Tony’s, cleared his throat and nodded his head towards the valet line.
“Someone has to,” Steve said, then gasped as Tony thrust his hips again.  “Tony,” Steve said, voice low and full of pleading.
“Stop the international terrorists, get the goods on my murderous pseudo-Uncle, talk about feelings with my fake husband, impress said fake hubby’s bestie….I’ll just pencil in privatize world peace for a nooner,” Tony grumbled.
“Jack, it’s fine, I got you covered, here,” Brock assured him.  He pulled out his wallet and handed Jack five one-hundred dollar bills.
“Aa--ah--oh!” Steve shouted in a pant of breath that was knocked out of him as his whole body arched into the contact.  God, that felt amazing.  The warm, wet heat of Tony’s mouth against the cold, hard nipple. The way Tony’s thighs braced against Steve’s, hugging him and keeping their cocks pressed together with only thin layers of wet, clingy fabric between them.  The firm pressure as Tony began to suck at the nub that seem to throb its way right down to the head of Steve’s cock like the nerves were connected.  Everything. It was all so, so
“Hey, now.  Ursa Major was not creepy,” Tony objected. “She had a bow.  With…little x’s and o’s on it.”
.  Safe from the rain of deadly arrows and mortars that flew from above.  It was amazing.  He had never seen anything like it, never thought of anything like it, and yet he could see at once the advantage.
“Ah,” Tony said, cutting Steve off with a raised hand.  “I see.  Come here,” Tony said, voice gentle as he motioned Steve forward to the place in front of his chair.   “You will not listen to me from over there.  Your head is too full, my dear one, and no wonder.  Please,” Tony urged again when Steve didn’t move.    Finally, Steve walked over and stood in front of Tony’s bent knees, then knelt down and looked up, as much out of a shocked curiosity than anything else.  “Do you truly think that I would ever hurt you?  Really hurt you?”
“If you’re here, it’s great,” Steve replied. Oh. Well. Okay, then, Tony thought. He never quite knew what to do when Steve said these things to him, though he did it regularly enough that it shouldn’t be unexpected, not anymore, yet each one caught him by surprise. What he felt for Steve always seemed so close to the surface, threatening to bubble over at any moment, and Steve…Steve was his rudder, keeping him on an even keel. Well, most of the time, anyway. Not even Steve’s superpowers extended quite that far. But the point was, loving Steve was the easiest thing he’d ever done. It just existed, like air, requiring no effort on his part, but it was always there, surrounding him, present in the most real way possible. He just assumed loving him had to be a lot harder for Steve, and counted himself lucky that Steve thought he was worth the effort, but then Steve would say something or look at him a certain way, and Tony would be amazed all over again at the thought that maybe, just maybe, it was as effortless for Steve.
He could do that.  He could be good for Tony. And then he would be seen, not while he struggled, but when it was done, and he was
me!” Almost as if he had only remembered he had it, Rumlow raised the whip high into the air.  That’s no warning, Steve had time to think, but a hand caught Rumlow’s arm before he could bring it down.
“Tony,” Coulson said, sounding almost out of breath.  Something about it was so off, it made Tony slow his steps until he was standing in front of the cabin door, unable to move.  He looked up at the porch light, dull and gray during the day, with a brown moth with eyes patterned on its wings clutching at the bulb.  “It’s Captain Rogers.  There was…an incident.  During the mission.”
“I just…you know.  Suggested it.  As a possibility.  I’m not a chemical engineer or anything,” Tony pointed out.
He gave me a robot for my birthday, and we put out my birthday candle in the best way possible, and then I lost the plot, Tony thought to himself.
“Yes, I like that you can barely think of anything but me. Of course, I like that, Tony. You’re my Alpha. It’s…comforting. I’ve never had this before. Every time I’d get ready for my Heat, it was always a chore to prepare and figure something out, but now…I don’t have to worry about anything. You’re going to take care of me, and I know it’s going to feel…pure. And true. And right. And I want that,” Steve whispered almost brokenly. Tony raised a hand to settle on Steve’s shoulder, then ended up carding his fingers through the fine, blonde strands of Steve’s hair instead, stroking back and forth the way Steve did up and down Tony’s back to comfort him. “It seems like I’ve been waiting for that my whole life. You don’t know what it’s like, when you’re an Omega. Everyone wants you because they know you’ll make them feel good, but when I look at you, all I see is you wanting me to feel good.”
Head down, shoulders back, Steve thought as he strode down the hallway outside the locker room, past the startled crush of people coming to see what the fuss was about, past the vending machines and water fountains, past the cameras with their flashing red eyes.  Except, it was easier this time.  Not such a slog, he realized.  Where each step had once been a force of will at times, it was easier now.  His head wasn’t down. His shoulders weren’t back.  He was just...walking.
“I have things to do,” Tony replied, the words laced with steel.  Steve lay down on the bed, but watched as Tony quickly changed into something more suited for Court than his workshop.  When he was ready, he walked over to stand by the bed and looked down at Steve, though said nothing, just took Steve’s hand and squeezed.  “I will return when this is taken care of.  You are to remain here.  I’ll send for Cam as well.  Peran and Josiah?”  Tony called out without looking away from Steve.
The gift is life, Tony thought, and looked up at the alien hovering above him, still stroking his forehead, and came with a surprised cry, spilling himself into the cylinder.  He stared, blinking, as the cord siphoned off the spend into regions unknown, licked his lips, then looked up at the alien again. His expression, Tony saw, was soft, and Tony had the strange thought that it was...apologetic?  Maybe. Almost. But, not unhappy, he didn’t think. No, definitely not unhappy. Maybe just worried, Tony wondered, and had a nearly overwhelming desire to brush that worry away. Almost as quickly as he thought it, the alien’s face went slack, he blinked, then smiled softly down at Tony again.  The alien stroked his hand over Tony’s forehead again, and Tony felt such a sense of deep, aching tenderness flood into him that he thought for a moment that he might actually cry, but then it diffused, settling into a warm sense of languid peace.
“Sometimes.  Guess I always knew where to look for it, that’s for sure,” Steve admitted.  “Um, would you—Sorry, I should have asked.  I’m just—ah--there’s water and coffee.  I think maybe some soda.  I can call the mess—the, uh, cafeteria, I mean—and have them send up anything you want, if you’re hungry?”
“Brock,” Steve breathed out, momentarily at a loss.  “You can’t do that.  Dammit, leave him out of this, he has nothing to do with any of this!”
“There you are!  We’re about to eat without—oh! Oh, sorry! Sorry, I—well, I’ve gone and put my foot in it, haven’t I?”  Maria said with a wince in her tone.  “You’d just taken so long and…well, I…I thought…I’d better check…”
“Why not?” Tony shrugged. “There’s an extra suit in the guest bathroom.  Pepper bought it.  I may have made a suggestion.”
Steve picked up the spear-thrower and turned it over in his hand, then picked up one of the small spears and, after a few tries, got it notched in place and pulled back on the string until it was taut.  “You made this?” Steve asked. Anto nodded.
“Really?” Tony asked, twisting to look up at Steve.  “I magnetized the thing for you!  It’s like you’re just trying to challenge me.  Drop it to the bottom of the Potomac, leave it on the side of a mountain, hey, no worries!  It’s not like it’s that important or one of a kind or irreplaceable or anything like that.”
“Well, he’s very polite, have you not noticed?  Keep to your lessons like a good boy, how about?” Tony said.  “We’ll make a scribe of you yet.”
“Of course.  Though, it goes against everything I believe in about this world,” Tony said with an exaggerated shake of his head.
He did catch the driver’s lip twitch though, so he took it as a small victory.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Tony close his eyes and duck his head with a smile.  He figured by this point, Tony probably thought he was an idiot.  A pretty idiot, maybe, but certainly not the brightest crayon in the box.  He sighed.  This kind of thing had always been difficult for him, and tonight he was entirely too nervous to worry about impressing Tony with his mind.  He was pretty sure that wasn’t going to be required anyway.
Steve stared at him for a long moment, then dropped his gaze to where his hands were clinging to the edge of the table, crumpled in the white tablecloth the servers had so artfully arranged.
Stane was offering him a way home.  Him, Cam, and Cam’s mother.  The impossible thing he wanted.  It hardly seemed real.
“Wasn’t the last time you got all brassed off with me, was it, Shellhead?” Steve asked the memory, smiling fondly.  God, Iron Man, he thought, giving his head a rueful shake.  He had never wanted to strangle anyone more. Of course, Bucky said that was actually half the reason why Steve liked Iron Man so much, but Bucky said a lot of things that...that just weren’t true. And then Bucky was gone, and the War was over somehow, and they’d won, even if it hadn’t much felt like a victory in that moment, and somehow, in all of that, Iron Man said goodbye, of course, because he surely had his own home and responsibilities to attend to, though Steve somehow hadn’t quite expected it.
Shellhead nodded, smiling somewhat proudly at Steve.  Steve wasn’t sure if he was proud that he thought of such things or that Steve figured he out.  Probably the latter, Steve thought with a grin.
The ears could be explained. Birth defect, maybe.  Something. The flawlessly smooth skin, like fine marble, could happen, Tony supposed, if you avoided sun and manscaped the hell out of yourself.  The physique, while impressive, wasn’t impossible. But, the eyes. The
Clint had given them his daughter’s room, probably on purpose.  She had a double bed covered in pink and white sheets with horses running across them and one of those nightlights that projected glowing greenish stars on the ceiling. Tony had unplugged it without a word.  Steve had graciously offered to take the floor, and Tony let him because he couldn’t come up with an objection that didn’t sound pathetic.  Then—then.  Then he’d woken up, shaking and soaked in sweat, body clenched in a rictus of muscles, panting for air.
When he woke up again, Tony was asleep in the armchair, and Thor, Steve could only assume, was enjoying either his lifetime supply of Pop-Tarts or a sudden visit from Jane.  Bruce never stood a chance on that one, Steve reckoned with a slight smile.
Maybe she had, Steve thought as he shook his head and huffed out something that passed for a laugh.  The laugh fell from his face as he looked down at the first file.  Stark Expo.  The Expo.  God, he could almost smell the roasted peanuts, feel the gnawing pit in his stomach as he and Bucky walked over to the girls Buck had rounded up from somewhere. The air had seemed to thrum with some kind of electricity that sparked through the crowd, the feeling of being on the edge of something. That’s what it had been. The precipice before the jump, toes curling around the edge, deep breath filling your lungs to bursting, the
“Steve,” Tony said as they passed by the discolored dirt. “Are you sure you want to do this?  We can go back.  Rhodey can find Barnes.  Or put Natasha on it, and she’ll probably have him skipping into camp in no time.”
By the time he made it back to Steve, there was a sandwich and drink waiting for him.  His stomach rumbled, which was something of a revelation in and of itself.  He had been hungry for so long, he stopped being hungry, but he liked to have food around, constantly available.  He kept it stashed around the workshop in little bags or plastic containers.  Steve knew, though he didn’t say anything about it, just kept gamely insisting on bringing trays of food to the workshop for Tony to shift around on the plate until it looked like he’d eaten enough to satisfy Steve.
“As long as I can still laugh at the Church Lady,” Tony quipped with a burst of relief.  “Kids, money, religion…” Tony reeled off.  “Guess that leaves sex.”
“I know. I was going to,” Steve said, pulling out the small device that Peggy had given him.  Tony gave it a look of utter contempt.
He tried to focus on what Brock was saying.  It was at least distracting enough, if he really concentrated, to keep his mind from straying too close to thoughts better left alone.  Steve made a few vaguely attentive noises as Brock talked until finally, Steve assured Brock it all sounded great, and Brock turned his attention to the complimentary TV where some action movie was showing.  Steve found himself idly sketching on the edge of the crossword puzzle until he realized it was the rock walls of the Grand Canyon he was trying to capture in blue ballpoint.
“You did so good, Tony,” Steve husked out.  His voice sounded warped, used, almost brittle.  “So very, very good for me.”
He wasn’t sure how long they lay like that, with Tony inside him, splayed on top of him, breathing heavily.  He felt Tony pull out and heard him move from the bed to another room that Steve assumed was the bathroom.  A few minutes later, he saw Tony return, pick his boxers off the floor and redress, then sit on the edge of the bed.  He wasn’t sure what was supposed to happen now.  He could still feel tremors running through his body, his breathing still shallow and strained.
By the time he got down to the gym, it was fairly full.  A few members of the strike team were there, mostly lifting weights.  Steve nodded at them and received the same noncommittal greeting in return.  As much as Steve missed having a team, he didn’t think they actually liked him, so much as tolerated him, and the feeling was very much mutual. They were an
“Should be pulling up any minute now,” Nat told him.  “Come on, you,” she said, tugging at Barnes’ sleeve.  “Home.  Bed. To sleep,” she clarified at Barnes’ eager puppy look.
He sucked in a breath of cool night air and let it out again in a long, low hiss.  Maybe they could try Ghostbusters next.  Thanks to Steve’s Paul Bunyan impersonation, they had enough firewood to actually roast Mr. Stay Puft himself, but Tony would settle for s’mores.  Steve would like that one.  It would make him laugh, really laugh, that deep, full-throated laugh where he tossed his head back and threw a hand over his heart like he was intending to say the Pledge, but got overcome by hysteria instead.  Tony loved it, probably because on the rare occasions he got to hear it, it was always followed by a sense of accomplishment, like he’d cracked some kind of enigma code.  Stupid brain chemistry getting fucked up over his Alpha laughing, that’s what it was.  That was all it was.
“You do, indeed,” Steve agreed with a grin.  A table in the center of the room was set with food.  Steve’s stomach rumbled, as if awakening from a deep sleep, and he realized he was, in fact, starving.  He used the privy and took a quick splash bath from the basin of warm water Cam had helpfully provided, then wrapped a simple cotton robe around himself.  He and Cam rushed through the meal, though Cam still managed to use more words during the course of it to discuss their impending adventure than Steve had probably uttered in a month’s time.  When they were done, Cam rang one of the bells to have the table cleared, and set about placing items on the bed for Steve.
They made it off Clan land by nightfall.  Steve had no idea, of course, but Anto knew—Tony, he mentally corrected.  He was Tony now. A man of the Others. He tugged at Steve’s hand to stop for a moment, and Steve did, giving him a questioning look, but not demanding an answer.  Tony looked back for a long time. His entire life had been spent there, and he would never go back. Even if he did, they would not see him. Not even Jhrvis. He looked over at Steve, and reached out to take his hand.  He was Steve’s now, and Steve was his, linked somehow, in a way he only barely understood. Maybe a Mog-Ur could tell him, or maybe Jhrvis already had.
He and Rhodey had plotted out their course across campus. It had taken them the whole day to get the damn thing to their apartment, but they'd spent it stopping at various points on their journey for snacks and posing for photos. His mind flashed to the one of the whole lot of them in the middle of Eastman Court with that stupid sofa that Thor, Steve and Barnes had managed to balance precariously between the Hexagons sculpture, Tony lounging across it with a floor lamp that Nat supplied from God only knew where next to him, everyone else slotted inside the hexagons with various living room odds and ends the always eager to get up to something MIT students had helpfully supplied. He wondered who had that picture. Nat, probably. That had been the last time they were all together like that. Well, until the other night.
Steve nodded once, then pulled his phone out of his back pocket and hit one of the contacts.  A moment later, Tony could hear him in the living room, asking for a veggie pizza, hold the black olives, probably because Tony had picked them off last time.
“Ah,” Steve said, because he liked to over-explain like that, Tony thought with a disgruntled, sideways look.
“Remember I told you about Peter?” Steve asked.  Shellhead nodded. “After Peter’s parents died, there was just his aunt, and she was elderly at that.  Didn’t really have much for him, but she put him in one of the orphanages so he could get at least a daily meal and paid his allotment for as long as she could, I guess.  But, if you stop paying, then the state makes them a ward. Lots of people, they couldn’t pay, you know? Ma said people were always leaving the little babies outside the rich folks’ houses up on Fifth Avenue.  One time, Bucky’s Ma heard him say he was going to go up there and see if he could get adopted, and she boxed his ears real good,” Steve said with a slight smile.
“No,” Steve said after a moment.   “I don’t think he is, either. I don’t know what he’s like, to tell you the truth.”
“Oh. Right. Steve’s here,” Tony said into the moment of silence that followed, raising his hand and vaguely pointing in the general direction of the man standing in the doorway. He gave Ty a wide, flat smile, proud of himself for finally remembering what he had wanted to tell Ty, not that Ty was paying him any mind at the moment.
Steve nodded once, pushing his thoughts aside, and watched Tony wipe his hand on his breeches, seemingly unconcerned about the mess Steve had made.  Tony stood up, then guided Steve to his feet and helped him to the tub where it sat warming in front of the fire.  It was low enough for Steve to step into rather easily.  The water was lukewarm now, which was probably good, he thought as he let out a slight hiss when it reached the flayed skin of his thighs. It wasn’t as bad as it had been this morning, but was still raw enough to sting.  He sank down on his knees, bracing his arms on the edges for support and let his chin dip down to his chest.  His eyes drooped closed. The whole day seemed to cover him like a heavy blanket, warm and weighted. His mind chased the feeling.  Or ran away from something else, Steve wasn’t sure. He didn’t fight it, though.
He loved the feeling of being so full of Steve’s cock that the pressure and fullness seemed to be in every part of his body and then still having to take more.  Being knotted went beyond pleasure or pain, beyond orgasm or sex, it was deeply intimate, giving and receiving on a fundamental level.  They were tethered together in an act that spanned thousands of years, that made both Alpha and Omega vulnerable for a time, and yet, was required for procreation.  It seemed to make no sense, and hadn’t to Tony for a long time, but then, there was Steve, and being with Steve like this…having Steve be his in this way, it was, well…it was breathtaking.
“Look, be happy I can form words at all, even four letter ones.  Suspenders? Seriously, I’m, like, having a moment here, Christ,” Tony murmured, his mouth hanging slightly open.  It was, well, encouraging, Steve could admit. Steve smiled, feeling his face heat. “I remember the blush. God, you’re fucking gorgeous. Can you die of blue balls?  Asking for a friend,” Tony said after a moment.
“Tony, stop.  You’re not buying the building. That’s—that’s ridiculous,” Steve said.  “He’s not—he’s not really doing this,” Steve told his neighbor.
Tony looked the alien up and down, considering.  Images floated through his head again, one after the other, men and characters that seemed to have a number of similarities, at least in Tony’s mind, and that, Tony realized, was what the alien seemed interested in.  Someone Tony liked. Admired. Even...desired, if he was honest.
“Yeah.  Yeah, I know,” Steve said, giving Tony a soft glance that made the corners of his eyes slant.
Steve used his other hand to tear an ad for Acme coffee out of one of the Life magazines stacked on the table next to the bed.  A smiling woman held out a steaming cup over the tagline.  ‘Husband Pleasing Coffee,’ it read.  He balled it up and tossed it into the metal stew pot on the floor by the cot in which he’d built a small fire with one of their precious matches.  It wasn’t much.  They couldn’t risk too much light, but even the small glow seemed to offer some warmth, though he suspected that might be the suggestion of warmth more than anything.
“Why not?” Tony replied with something of an overly cheery tone.  He swiped the bottle out of Steve’s hands and sat down. Steve stared dumbly at him for a moment.  He should have pulled the chair out for Tony. That was the polite thing to do. He was messing this up.  He could tell. Tony was barely looking at him now, his shoulders set with tension. He doesn’t want to be here, Steve thought.  He doesn’t want this. He doesn’t want me.
Okay, sure, a knee massage while Tony was completely naked, fucked out and leaking come, and three fantasy versions of Steve were waiting their turn to fuck him again, but still.  Definitely not erotic at all.
Wave after wave of pleasure crashed into Tony, so fast he couldn’t recover between crests, just had to ride it out.  He tasted salt, and realized he was sobbing, chest heaving, hands bunched into the sheet so hard his knuckles were white.
“Fancy,” Tony remarked with a huff.  Sitting in a stuffy room that looked like a bottle of Pepto-Bismol birthed a floral arrangement listening to a bunch of Omegas discuss hair products, celebrity divorces and how little McKynleigh knows all her Presidents did not sound like a great deal of fun, but whatever.  Technically, he’d never actually been in one, but he’d lost enough IQ points watching TV shows that depicted them like Downton Abbey: Kardashian Edition to know that he probably didn’t belong.
“Tony’s in trouble.   Stane pulled the, ah. The pacemaker thing out.  What do I do?” Steve rushed out, glancing nervously at Tony.
It was—it was just too ingrained not to respond.  He knew Steve hadn’t quite meant it like that, but an Alpha had given the signal.  He had to comply. He twisted out of Steve’s arm, dropped his sack, sank to the ground until he was on all fours, then bent his chest down to the ground, all in one fluid motion.  He lifted his shift up and presented.
“Tony,” Pepper entreated softly. “It's okay, you know? To love him. I'm not saying you do. At all,” she clarified quickly. “But. If you do. It's okay. We all do stupid things when we're young. I mean, you've seen the pictures of me with a perm, right?” she teased with a wobbly smile. “Five million dollars? That's security for a lifetime when you're nineteen. I'm not saying it was right, not at all, it was terrible, and you deserve so much more, let me be the first to say, but...if he's who makes you happy...then, that's okay, Tony. You don't have to justify anything to anyone. Not me. Not James. We just want you to be happy. You know that, right?”
Tony kept looking Rogers over, since he hadn’t been told not to, and he was being open-minded and shit.  Whatever image Tony had conjured in his mind, it sure as hell wasn’t this, he could freely admit.  Handsome didn’t really quite capture Rogers, Tony thought, like it was too small a concept for what Rogers was like in person.  More like, someone should put him on a billboard kind of gorgeous that made Tony suddenly feel ridiculous with his hair that wouldn’t stop trying to curl, watercolor suit and make-up that was probably smudged by now, though, it was kind of nice that Rogers appeared to have put some effort into his appearance, too.  That was something.  Not like Tony wasn’t a sure thing, at least as far as Rogers knew, but it was something.
Exactly how often over the past few months he found himself thinking about that whole experience now that there was some distance to it and now that he knew Steve so much better was not something he really wanted to contemplate. Certainly not out loud.
He tossed the wrench towards the toolbox, missed, and watched it bounce out and land next to the Audi’s back tire.  Tony glanced over at DUM-E, who was hooked into the CPU, downloading a programming update and whirring so excitedly through the process that Tony half expected him to ask for a cigarette when it was complete. Which U would probably helpfully put out, but whatever.
“I know!  That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you,” Tony muttered into Steve’s shoulder.  “You love me.  You do.  I don’t know why, but you do, and no take-backs.”
He'd been sitting there on that ugly monstrosity of a couch, lounging on Steve---because the fabric made Tony's skin itch--working on getting the fuse right and thinking about power generation and thermal fuses with self-resetting features, and the idea had just sort of burst, fully born, into his head. A bright flash of the rare complete thought, gone before he could quite grab all of it, but he'd seen it, the whole thing. And the start of it, the bit of wiring and fuse he'd been toying with, was sitting in a box in Steve's shitty apartment, a souvenir of a eureka moment that only the two of them shared.
“Tele--wait.  Empty garage?” Tony repeated, eyes lighting up as his gaze darted up to Steve.  Beautiful, Steve thought. He’s beautiful like that.
“Raiders are using your own ports to offload their cargo. I used to watch them.  Sometimes.  When I could see the ships,” Steve told the King in careful, punctuated words.  He didn’t like the memory, hot and sweat-soaked and tainted with a desperate thirst that even now clawed at his throat, but even terrible knowledge could be useful.
“His people, they are nomadic, you know,” Yinsen explained, “and so I think–from what I have gathered, anyway, I think it is considered, well…very much a–a pleasing thing to be given your Omega’s things to carry, because the Omega will…well, one day, I mean…you will, ah…you will carry–”
“Which one?” Steve asked as he gripped a hand on the doorframe.  He could feel the wood under his fingers.  A slight heave of pressure and it would splinter.  That was true of a lot of things, he thought, though he held his tongue.
His stomach churned and growled.  Loudly. Okay, so maybe he was a little hungry.  That much alcohol on an empty stomach had probably not been his best life decision.  Ty had said he could eat here, but the chips and whatever had been poured into the bowls downstairs had been long gone by the time they got here. Point being, while an empty stomach was a blessing at the moment, some food might actually help, he decided, scrolling through the photos on his phone from last night out of sheer boredom.
“Turned out to be Mr. Stark’s new husband,” Tan Suit told him, leaving Stern’s mouth to open and shut a few times as he tried to digest the news. “Can’t talk to him.”
“Me?  God, no!” Tony winced.  “Not that anyone has ever brought to my attention, and I’m sure they would have.” A stab of relief in Steve’s gut punctuated Tony’s words.  He knew from Cam that Zola made sure the female concubines took certain medications on a strict schedule, but he had wondered. Not that it should matter to him.  Still. He couldn’t deny that he felt it. Tony leaned down and captured Steve’s lips in a searing kiss. “Good morning,” he said again, smiling.
He sends these to me, Steve thought with a sudden tightening in his chest.  This is one of the things he does that the slaves and servants talk about amongst themselves.  White lilies.  Every day.  Because that night in the garden, under the lanterns, with a blanket of them at our feet, I told him they reminded me of the white star on my shield.  And so he has them bring these to me, every day, and I have only just now noticed.  What else have I missed, Steve wondered with a sigh, going back to where Cam waited impatiently, bobbing back and forth between his feet as he held the blue robe in front of him, trying to entice Steve to cooperate with his plans for dressing him.
“You know it’s killing Tony not to be able to just spoil the hell out of Steve.  Let him have a pass on the lunch thing,” Rhodey suggested evenly.  “How many more do we need?” Rhodey asked with a nod at the grill.
Tony smiled, almost knowingly, Steve thought.  “It’s just food, Steve, I assure you,” Tony said, then stopped, his dark eyes seeming to latch onto Steve somehow and dig in, catching hold.  Steve could almost feel himself swaying on his feet, lightheaded and dizzy for a moment.  “You really should eat something,” Tony added, his voice low and soft, little more than an entreaty to a guest, really, but oddly insistent.
“Starving,” Tony replied.  Steve winced a bit and grimaced.  He didn’t think it was meant as a rebuke, but, well.  He was supposed to be paying attention to these things, taking care of Tony, and all he had been doing with his time was thinking about himself.  He should have ordered food earlier.  Or brought Tony something else to snack on after lunch instead of moping around the cabin doing no one any good.
Steve blinked, a surge of happiness filling him, though he wasn’t sure why.  The food was good, but...he looked down in confusion for a moment, then the strange giddiness passed, and he found himself staring--again--at Tony.  He kept trying to look away, but something about Tony drew his gaze inexorably back.
“Captain Rogers?” the doctor asked, leaning a bit over Steve, all efficient compassion now that whatever fallout might happen had been effectively transferred to Coulson.  “I’m almost done.  Can you hold still for me just a big longer?  Good,” he said when Steve nodded in response.
“—doing the same thing you did before, Steve.  Don’t think I don’t see it. You let him in.  Here.  Make him right at home in your life.  You’re good at that,” Barnes continued in a low, frustration-roughened tone.  “Tony Stark, and you’ve got him taking a bus and living in some cramped, bullshit Brooklyn walk-up when you could be playing Lifestyles of the Ridiculously Rich and Infamous down at his Tower.”
“”M close,” Tony said.  “I need. God,” he keened as the alien rammed into him, sending an aftershock of concentrated pleasure rocketing through Tony’s body.  He gasped and moaned, writhing as much as he could under the gel blanket that held him. “Please,” Tony moaned. “Pleeeaaase, I need, I need,” he stammered, all the air rushing out of his lungs on the alien’s next thrust.
“Sorry, I—I didn’t mean to oversleep, I--what?  Ah…yes?“ Steve stammered with a surge of embarrassed awareness of his nakedness, even though that made no sense after the night before.  Still, there was something different about waking in the King’s bed the next morning, naked, sleep-warm and thick-tongued, while the King himself was so splendidly attired.  He felt wildly out of place, like whatever spell had fallen over him the night before broke with the rising of the sun.
“Get better,” Tony replied softly.  “Steve, from the moment I met you, you always took care of me.  Let me take care of you this time, okay?  Please.  Please, Steve.  Let me do this.”
“Did you not think I was serious?” Barnes asked, pulling an exaggerated look of disbelief.  “Steve, don’t get your panties in a wad over Estes, for Christ’s sake.  Tony, Steve thinks it’s awesome, he just needs a bit of time to get his head around it, okay?  People don’t usually do stuff like that for him, so he’s freaking out a bit.  It’s always him taking care of other people. Case in point, here. He’ll get over it.  Steve, please let the nice billionaire who is clearly head over heels do some crazy, rich-people shit for you.  Fight for your honor or whatever.  Jesus, Steve, you’re killing me with this fall on your sword thing, man.  Come on, live a little, would you? The guy had it coming, and you know it,” he finished, saluting Steve with a barbecued chicken wing.
“He’s busy.  And I’m not that sick, I told you,” Tony said, then sneezed again and made a soft grunting sound as he tried to breath in through his stuffed-up nose.  “It’s just a cold.  Everyone gets colds.  He’ll go to Def Con 3 over it.”
“Jus Primae Noctis.  Right of the first night.  Old, stupid law written by old, stupid men, but…still technically there and perfectly usable by young, stupid men,” Tony said, canting his head to one side to twist around and look at Steve.  “The Lord, or, in this case, since you married a Lord, me, has the right of the first night.”
“Yeah.  It’s just a couple of dates, Tones,” Rhodey said.  “I was kidding about the marrying thing.  Don’t marry him.  Tell me you’re not going to propose.”
Next to him, Bucky snorted out a laugh and nudged Steve’s shoulder. “I told you. These Alphas tend the hearth. That is why they are so easily defeated.”
“What time is it?” Steve asked, sitting up on his elbows and blinking down at Tony.  “Why are you on the floor?  Buck, what are you doing here—ah, shit, I’m late.”
.  At some point, Tony got up and returned with a soft cloth, wet with water from the basin.  He cleaned Steve with gentle strokes, while Steve attempted to force his muscles into some kind of action instead of lying there like limp straw.  Tony somehow got them both under the blanket and curled against Steve’s side, one hand thrown over Steve’s chest where his fingers traced lazy patterns into the skin.  Steve shivered.  He could feel the scar-roughened skin of Tony’s chest pressed flush to his side.  Tony’s warm breath puffed over Steve’s skin, just below his heart, evening out sometime long after the fire had burned down to little more than embers glowing in the hearth.
“I’m pretty sure I did a fairly bang-up job of screwing things up, too,” Tony replied. “I was the one who broke it off,” he pointed out.
“Tony, what if—and I just want you to consider, for a moment, this crazy, fanciful notion I have—but, what if your Alpha simply likes to do things he believes will make you happy for no other reason than he likes to see you happy?” Jarvis asked.  “Think of this as a wonderful new equation for you to solve wherein your happiness is enough for those who love you and you do not need to add any other variables to it.  What might that look like?”
“Really?  A tour?  With the King?” Cam squealed with delight.  “I must tell Lena and Marcus.  They will be so jealous.  They never go anywhere, except the laundry or the storehouse, and those don’t count.  You will wear something special for the King tonight, yes?  To thank him?  I will come with you to the baths and see that they take proper care of you.  You should be beautiful for him, and tell him how happy you are.  He will like to hear this and will want to take us other places with him,” Cam stated with his usual directness.
That was good. Steve relaxed. His body went languid, easy. His breathing steadied. Tony ran his hand down Steve’s spine and over the cleft of his ass, then both hands were cupping the supple cheeks, kneading and working the flesh. Steve would have groaned, but what came out felt like half of that, breathy and desperate. Cool air grazed his hole as Tony parted him, holding his ass spread wide, seemingly content to just look for a long moment.
“Just someone who is very interested in history and how it continues to screw us over today,” Tony interrupted, raising an eyebrow at Steve, who was pretending to study his notes.
“Director Fury thinks this will be good for me.  Help me acclimate.  Your Dad, he—he said you were excited.  About this.  Not really sure what you get out of it though,” Steve admitted.  He knew how selfish this whole thing was. He knew it, and he couldn’t say it, couldn’t tell Tony why he should run for the hills, and he knew an excuse when he heard one.  But, if Tony wanted this,
“Actually,” Steve said, interjecting quickly before she could hang up. “I’m a previous client for, um. Room Six. From a couple of years ago. I was wondering if the other person was still, ah. If he was still using that room, and if—if he’d be available. Today. Now. If possible.”
“No one is going to touch you,” Steve cut in.  There was the Steve who tried not to smile at Tony’s audacity, and there was the Steve who was strangely more tongue-tied than Tony at times, and Tony was still trying to reconcile these things in his head.  Then there was this Steve, who said something that Tony believed was one-hundred and ten percent true because absolutely no-fucking-one was going to do anything except what Steve said to do.
Tony looked at him blankly for a moment, then put his coffee cup down and leaned back in his chair.  “What is your life?” he demanded incredulously, but he was smiling, wide and carefree, so Steve counted it as a win.  They discussed the relative merits of a proportional response, at least as it related to candy thievery, for a good half an hour while they finished breakfast and Tony downed the remainder of the coffee.
Steve thought, maybe, some part of him had known the truth or some version of it that his mind could comprehend this whole time.  Ever since the night on the road, he had been different.  Felt different.  Whole, in a way that he had never felt before.  Unafraid, for one thing.  Unafraid, and...he thought that was perhaps the last time he had been truly lonely, that night on the road, running from something in the woods and running into something that by all rights should have been far worse.
It felt divine.  And like not nearly enough.  Steve groaned plaintively, earning a low chuckle from Tony.
“Take the left just past the light, Happy,” Steve said, glancing over at Tony before looking back out the window.  “You don’t have to come in, you know.”
Tony lay there  on the bed for a while, watching Steve and listening to the sound, stone against metal, over and over.    It was strangely soothing, he thought, though he didn’t know why. He should be afraid. He had seen what Steve had done earlier today, after all.
He checked his personal email, finding one from Pepper, too casual to be anything other than her checking up on him.  “Jarvis, send the Potts-Hogan suite at the St. Regis something that says ‘Tony is eating and sleeping appropriately and completely not engaging in self-destructive behavior,’” Tony called out.
Tony shifted in his seat and twisted to look at Steve.  He’d missed something. Steve’s back was stiff and his jaw tight.  One hand was rubbing up and down on the top of his thigh.  Not a switch-flicker, but something, Tony thought.
It was hot.  Steve had gotten used to the cooler, sea-facing confines of the Castle and compound, where a steady, salt-tinged breeze flowed through the halls.  Out here, beyond the wall, under the scorching sun, with little in the way of shade, he found his mind wandering to the maps he had studied in Tony’s library.  The mountains were craggy and layered with rocks and more caves than could be counted. Places to hide.  Shelter from the sun in the day, warmth when the temperature dipped in the night.  Water was an issue, he thought as he sipped the sweetened brew in his hand.  The river, Steve remembered, was used by the farmers to make their land arable, and the runoff from their efforts made the water this far near the mouth undrinkable thanks to their preferred choice of fertilizer.  But, as the river thinned to a trickle closer to the mountains, it would be cleaner.  He hoped, anyway.
“Good job, buddy,” Tony said, his mouth quirking up in a lopsided smile.   At least someone was trying to offer help.  It wouldn’t matter, he told himself firmly.  Whatever it was that Steve wanted to tell him.  It wasn’t going to change anything.  He loved Steve, and Steve…felt something for him.  He was
Steve looked down at the counter where his hands curled against the linoleum and balled them into fists, letting out a long sigh as he did.
Tony flopped back on the bed, staring at the ceiling until he heard the door snick closed.  He rolled over and disengaged the gauntlet, though tucked it on the table by the bed.  Just in case.  A lot could happen in three seconds, really.  What was even the point of counting to three?  Give the other guy a running start?  Really, schoolyard fairness had no place when it came to threats to Steve safety.  Or happiness.  Or really anything that would annoy him.  Or hunger, because that obviously meant no sex for Tony, so that was definitely—you know, counting to three was just a waste of time in the strictest sense of the phrase.
Tony tore his mouth away, giving Steve a firm look when he made a noise of protest, and kissed a line down the center of Steve’s chest, all the way down, licking his tongue into the cup of Steve’s navel, stopping only when he reached the first curls of wiry hair where Steve’s cock bobbed insistently.  He shifted back up, grinned, and bent his head to take Steve’s right nipple in his mouth, making Steve gasp with shocked pleasure.  As he had done to the lobe of Steve’s ear, Tony swirled his tongue, sucked and edged at the peak with his teeth, making Steve draw a leg up at the sudden burst of pressure that exploded somewhere deep inside his gut and sparked hot tendrils of need to the tip of his cock.
“Yes…how would you possibly understand not wanting someone else near your mate?” Jarvis asked drolly.
“Absolutely,” Agent Paz agreed.  “Tony’s given us a lot to think about.  I didn’t know SI was even working in the UAV arena, but Tony’s points…well, I’m somewhat dismayed that we haven’t been more proactive about the lack of upgrades to the product.  SHIELD’s had the contract with Hammer for years now, but it’s up for renewal soon.  I’ll have to put a word in with the Director.  Have him take a look at what SI has to offer.”
Whatever Steve wasn’t supposed to let Tony do was lost to a thin, reedy moan as Steve closed his mouth over one of Tony’s nipples, sucking, then scraping his teeth over it, before lapping at it with the flat of his tongue.  He let go and pushed himself up on his hands, leaning his head down to mouth at the spot under Tony’s jaw, just below his ear.
“I asked Ms. Potts to have someone pick it up from the apartment for me.  You think it’s okay?” Steve asked. Ms. Potts must have had it cleaned and pressed. It didn’t smell like mothballs anymore, at least. He tugged at the lapels of his blue mess uniform and looked over at Bucky.
“No, of course not, it’s fucking adorable. Everything about you is fucking adorable, I can’t with you, honestly.  But…I’m going to pretend not to like that for a really long time,” Tony said.
“What?” Tony snapped, eyes going wide as his body spasmed so violently that the wine sloshed over the rim of the goblet and ran down the sides, dripping onto his hands and pants, not that he seemed to notice.  “That’s not possible.”
“If I was on fire, I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t offer me a glass of water,” Tony muttered disconcertedly, shaking his head and frowning a bit as he pictured the scene.
“He’s fine, Ma’am. He is…with me.  Sort of.  He had a bit of a, um, reaction, earlier, but it seems a lot more under control with the…suit…on,” Steve replied.  That made some sense, Tony thought.  The suit had its own air system, so whatever scent-whammy he’d been hit with earlier had probably largely dissipated, allowing him to come back to himself from whatever pheromone storm there had been.   Had he…he struggled to recall…he’d been standing there by Fury…Fury had said something…then Steve had said something…something nice…and then Steve had been there at the window…he looked up at the cracked glass…so, that might have not gone as Fury had hoped.  Or maybe it had.  Fury was shifty like that.  The important thing was that with the suit on, he was in control, his mind was not being ruled by some ridiculous biological imperative.
There was a pause, then Tony’s voice came again, low and careful this time.  “I’m sorry.  You’re right, this is inappropriate.  My mistake. I’ll talk to Ms. Romanov tomorrow.”
Steve wanted more.  He wasn’t quite sure he could articulate what he meant by more, notwith Tony doing what he was doing to to him, but he knew he craved it.  More.  More
A kiss pressed to Tony’s scalp.  Soft caresses fell over his thighs and stomach, down his arms and across his chest.  Deep inside him, Tony felt the familiar pressure of the knot start to form, slowly expanding and filling him, pressing into his prostate with a constant force that created a rising tide of pleasure that seemed to seep into Tony’s blood and bones and push out through his skin.  He sighed.   One of Steve’s hands settled on the curve of Tony’s belly for a moment, just below the garter belt.  One day, Tony thought.  Soon, maybe.  He could take a year off before grad school.  They could come back to the cabin.  Steve would paint the guest room.  They would put those glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling.
“I kind of want to put the sharks in the pool. Don’t you? Why would you have shark art, but not put it in the pool? Doesn’t make sense,” Tony said.
“It...was a rough start to the year,” Steve admitted.  “And you know how much I appreciate you being there for me and all, but, we don’t exactly have the money yet,” he added pointedly. “I can indulge you right up to the cost of this meal and...maybe a pack of gum. If you’re good.”
“That’s…good.  What you do.  I’m more the…keep-your-distance kind.  Getting close, it’s…well, let’s just say that doesn’t usually end well for me,” Kirk said, locking his eyes on Steve’s gaze, before he looked away, biting his lip between his teeth and holding it there for a moment.  “Army, school, helping the sick, the whole devoted son thing.  God, my Dad would love you.  Except for the gay thing.  He’s not a fan.  That could be a dealbreaker for him.  How’s your fragile masculinity?  On a scale of one to anything involving an Axe product,” Kirk questioned, tapping a finger at the edge of his mouth, as if considering.
“Not a trick question,” Tony said, meaning to be glib, but it just sort of came out like an apology, though for what, he had no idea.
him agree to any of this.  Steve had wanted to.  Hell, it had been his idea to agree in the first place.  He thought.  Hadn’t it?  Maybe both of them had been thinking the same thing, he wasn’t quite sure how it all came about that he was suddenly saying they should take Tony up on his offer.
As he walked, Steve tried to remember all the rules Ms. Potts had gone over before the trip.  Do not touch him.  Keep silent, unless he asks a direct question. Never walk in front of him.  Do not eat until he eats. Never interrupt.  Do not sit until he is seated. Do not stand until he rises.  Do not hand him things, but it was acceptable to take something from him, if offered.
“I—I know,” Tony said.  He didn’t know, not really, but he knew enough.  “I never…you have to believe that I never knew about any of that.  That wasn’t me.  I’d never—God, Steve?  You really think I’d hurt him like that?  That I wanted any of this for him?  I—I loved him.  Love him.  More than anything.  I’d never, not for anything in the world, see him hurt. It kills me, if I think about it, I—I can’t think about it, you know?  I can’t.  I’ll lose the plot, James.  I will. I—I just want to make it right.  Okay?  That’s it.”
Steve looked vaguely over his shoulder towards the bathroom, remembered the unopened pack of Trojans in the medicine cabinet and the fact that he remembered buying them for Bucky’s twenty-first birthday party when they went to Coney Island.  Steve got food poisoning, likely from some combination of corndog and cheesesteak, and ended up at the urgent care on an IV after emptying the contents of his stomach two steps off the Electro Spin Luna Island.   Bucky got the nurse’s number.  Point being, if he was sitting here wondering what, exactly, the expiration date of a condom was, his stash may not be the best idea.
He sighed and rubbed his hands over his face, squeezing his eyes shut for a moment.  Giving up on the book, he closed it and set it aside. If he returned here, it would be waiting for him. If he returned here, so much would be waiting for him.  And what waited back home, even if he could make it there? The war was over. Bucky was dead.  Clint would have returned to his farm and family.  Sam to his home, if it still stood, and his falcons in their mews.  Scott missed his daughter fiercely enough to eschew his life of crime, even if those skills had proven useful in the war.  Steve supposed he, too, would have returned home by now.  Would Natasha have stayed with Fury?  That seemed likely.  Wanda and Pietro had each other.
“Sure.  No gang signs, though,” Tony admonished as the student leaned in and held out his phone with one arm.
“Sorry—that’s—you probably slept wrong.  I should’ve thought of that.  Woken you up.  I wasn’t thinking—I don’t know why I didn’t think—“ Tony stuttered.
.  Not that you’re, ah.  Struggling.  I’m glad I’m here, and, you know, can maybe help,” Tony offered.  “Coulson said.  He said maybe I was helping.”
“Your robots. Do they—do they do stuff? Like the one from your cartoon?” Steve asked, head titled to one side.
He looked around, but couldn’t see much in the dark, at least not until his eyes adjusted. Honestly, this whole facility was just pathetic and sad. Villainy had really taken a downslide since just about anyone could pick up a few alien artifacts on the black market, or, hell, eBay, these days. Some chick on Etsy had been making Chitauri leftovers into lovely candleholders until SHIELD put a stop to it. This place, whatever it was, was clearly not meant to hold two Avengers. The interrogation room had been lovely, however. Eleven of out ten prisoners would recommend reducing it to rubble as soon as they got out of here.
Though Bucky had departed for Brookland, or what remained of it, a few days ago, Steve wasn’t at a loss for companionship on the journey, he thought, as Dugan and Jones rode up next to him, breaking into his reverie. Morita was scouting ahead, per Steve’s orders, but the rest of the Commandos were never far from his side.
She tilted her head to the side, narrowed her eyes and regarded him.  “Sometimes that’s what we do,” Natasha replied with a cold sort of equanimity.   Her voice was barely a whisper over the hum of the engines, though Steve had no trouble hearing her.  “Sometimes, that’s the best thing we
Tony could feel Steve’s hand glide down his back to settle at the curve of his waist, sending fire through his veins as it did.   Tony tried to swallow and felt it get stuck in his throat, unable to move past the lump there.  He’d already misread things once.  He wouldn’t make that same mistake.
Stark’s head snapped around, his mouth pulling into an odd half-smile, like he couldn’t quite figure something out.
Tony let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding and stared down the empty hallway. The dishes. Good Lord. He let out a giddy, shaky laugh, his stomach roiling with relief. The dishes, of course, the stupid dishes. Of course, this was only a temporary reprieve, but when Steve's door stayed closed for long, loud ticks of that damn mantle clock, he decided to ignore that for now and do the best damn job of putting the dishes away that was humanly possible.
“That...you signed that,” Tony clarified. “Before we got—union-ed or whatever the kids were calling it in those days.”
Granted, all of those things sounded a lot like things Tony wanted to do.   But that wasn’t because of any particular reason, not really.  It was just, well…that was just what they did.  That was what they did, he mentally repeated.  Fuck.  They did things Tony wanted to do.  Had he ever done something Steve invited him to do?  He…
“I don’t think that would be a good idea, Captain, considering, but don’t worry, there is no way Stark will make it past your level. I’ve instituted our highest security protocols and—God dammit, Stark, quit overriding our security systems!” Fury seethed.
he can. It’s one of the reasons I pledged my sword to him as soon as I earned my spurs.  But you—you want
“That’s what you do, right?  Keep it professional?  Keep a certain distance, even when you’re…you know,” Tony said, mouth flattening for a moment before he turned to look back down on the Strip.  “Probably easier that way.”
“Me, too,” Tony said quietly, catching himself as his voice shook a bit.  He cleared his throat, trying to shake the lump loose.  “I mean, I’m glad, too.  No one ever picked me.  Before, I mean, when I would meet them.  The suitors.  They thought I was too much to handle or not…not right, you know?  I was always kind of glad, or I told myself I was, even if Mom and Dad…worried,” Tony trailed off, picking non-existent lint off his pants.  “Then I had a Heat, and I think they panicked because no Alpha.  Obie—he’s our CEO, remember?  He offered to, you know. With that.  But my parents didn’t want to, because some Alphas, it’s—they want, with someone who hasn’t—so, more options, I guess,” Tony stopped, catching Steve’s look.  “You’re not going to throw our CEO off a cliff, are you?”
Howard’s eyes bulged, whether from terror at Steve’s words or a lack of oxygen, Tony wasn’t sure.  Tony heard a sharp, shocked cry and looked over at the study door where his mother hovered with a hand at her throat, eyes wide, Jarvis just behind her with a similarly stunned expression, though he didn’t exactly pull off appalled with quite the aplomb that Maria mustered.
“I think that you did exactly what you needed to do.  I think your mission was a total success,” Tony told him. “Thing is, no version of me would let you do something like that. Not alone. Not without me. Which means, whatever this future was, I wasn’t there. And we failed. We failed badly enough that you did something that stupid, trying to fix it.  So, what I think,” Tony said, his words coming out shaky, “is that you succeeded. You didn’t need the Tesseract to fix the future. You needed us. Together. Maybe the universe knew that. Maybe there’s some cosmic power trying to get us to get our shit together, I don’t know. But, I know one thing.  This—you and me—this was meant to be. I told you. I’ll find you. Across time, across space, whatever it takes, I’ll find you. And you’ll find me. I believe that with every fiber of my being. You found me, when you weren’t even supposed to be looking,
“Not for me. That hasn’t happened for me yet.” Steve said. He looked at Tony, saw the fondness, the love in his eyes as he waited for Steve to calm, to say his piece. It was the same look Tony had been sending his since they first met. Steve just hadn’t understood. He swallowed. “Another you told me that you had always loved me, since the day we first met.”
“So, what – going off by yourself was just some childish tantrum because I told you something you didn’t like?” Steve pressed; his eyes were so blue, electric fire as he stared down at Tony.
He reached out for the door to the room where Tony was being kept and stopped, fingers resting on the doorknob. The metal was warm, fading heat from someone else’s hands. Steve pulled away sharply, his heart was beating fast, a rapid rabbit rhythm against his rib cage. He moved to the other door, the viewing room and entered, hand resting on his shield.
Steve took a step backward, suddenly cold. Tony was still playing this game, still messing with him just as he had been doing in the white room with F.R.I.D.A.Y. “That’s not possible.” He retorted.
Tony had levelled himself upright, his eyes hardened even as his arms shook under the stress of holding him up. “Fuck you!”
“This one,” Maria said, pulling Tony into her lap with a wink. Tony folded easily into her embrace, legs curled up beneath him and hands reaching out to help his mother balance the yellow-pages. She shifted him, pressing a faint butterfly kiss into his curls and pointed to a printer name. “What do you think, Tesoro?”
Steve could barely speak, the words wrenched out of him with desperately.  “Then where is he? The real Tony?”
“Steve,”’ The AI shimmered, taking a step forward, his hands held out like Steve was a wild animal he was trying to approach. “It’s not what you’re thinking.”
Slowly, the pain faded. Tony’s head was full of cotton wool; his hearing dulled as if he had slipped under an ocean wave. He felt a bit like he was watching the room through the wrong end of a telescope; everything seemed out of focus, objects wavering and bulging oddly when his eyes tried to move too quickly. Tony didn’t mind, he was glad of it. He felt sick but it was better to feel distant, removed from the reality of what was happened to his body.
Tony glanced up abruptly at the doctor’s words. He didn’t want to do it again, the thought of it made him feel hot and nauseated. His mother’s face was turned up towards the doctor, beautiful and glowing and Tony found for he couldn’t look at her, that he couldn’t bear to look at the bright excited light in her eyes. He
He twisted, tried to fight the invisible force holding him. His fingers scrambled, trying to cling onto Tony who still sleeping against his bare chest. His hands slid right through Tony’s back as easily as Steve was made of pixels.
“Tony, extremis is dangerous! You of all people should know that!” Steve could feel himself getting agitated. Tony’s unfeeling response kindled the anger burning inside him. He could feel his fingers twitching and repressed the urge to reach out and shake the other man. Didn’t Tony remember the hallucinations, the overloading of information, the mind control! Did he not care. “Why! Why would you sell it? What were you thinking?!’
Tony remembered the sinking, horrified feeling of his stomach dropping away when he’d looked up and seen his father’s shadowy bulk framed in the doorway. He had frozen like a hare caught in the gaze of a fox, the sharp edges of his circuit board cutting into the soft skin of palms. Howard had dragged Tony up off the floor, fingers pressing bruises into his thin wrists and Tony had felt tears forming in the corners of his eyes, sure he was about to be beaten again. Instead, he’d been lifted, dangling in his father’s arms like a ragdoll. The Howard had dropped Tony onto a high stool, shoved him towards a workbench, and ordered to build another circuit board but better. Howard’s expression when he’d completed the second circuit board had been delighted, lips pulled open so wide that Tony could count all of his teeth.
Afterwards, they settled back down onto the cot. Tony curled up easily into Steve’s arms, tucking himself into the line of Steve’s side as if they’d been made to fit together. Steve breathed deeply, content. His arm was stretched out under Tony and it was easy to fold Tony into towards, holding him protectively in the circle of his arms.
Tony spent hours on the toilet, clutching his stomach as his bowels cramped painfully and then he started having violent, unexplained vomiting fits. Maria was always there with him. She sit crossed legged in her designed jackets and heels on the cold tiled floors of Tony’s bathroom, rubbing her hands up and down his back, fingers searching and pressing into the knots of his spine as he strained into the toilet. She would hum gently, musical notes dancing over the sounds of his retching.
“There’s an extraction point two blocks away; we just have to make it out the front door.” Steve glanced over at Tony. The dark-haired man was panting hard, his face pale, apart from the two pink dots high on his cheeks. He hasn’t complained as they made their way through the Triskelion but it was obvious to Steve that he was nearing the end of his capacity, shivering and sweating with exhaustion.
“Oh, come on, Nat. That shouldn’t be allowed to do that at breakfast, some of us are trying to eat.”
Behind him Clint made a gagging sound, the noise abruptly cutting off as Natasha’s hand clipped him hard around enough the head to knock him off balance. “Be nice.” She scolded.
Tony didn’t answer, he felt exhausted, raw and he let himself close his eyes not wanting to look at the nurse as rolled the bed out of the theatre and down the hall into a small room. There were a few minutes of silence between the nurse leaving and his mother entering. Tony almost felt like he’d had more of the gas, not quite part of the world.
“I’m still the same man that you love, that you believed in. I’ve not changed that much” The Hydra Supreme continued, his grasp on Tony softening to a caress, fingers gently tugging through Tony’s mused curls. He leaned closer, almost unable to control his excitement. “I don’t want anyone with me more than you. Stay with me, Tony. I’ll you out of here, you can do anything you want. I trust you.”
There was a pause. If Steve had been talking to a person, he would have recognised the delay as indicative that he was starting to annoy them.
Tony hesitated, continuing with a sigh at Steve’s fierce look. He ran his hands through his hair, blue pixels blurring together, jumbling up before they reformed. It made his hair look like it was floating, a halo around his face. “The Chitarui were coming. Steve sent our most powerful fighters to space, to intercept them before they came here.”
“Hey, hey!” Tony skidded into view, hands held out and waving fanatically. “You’re safe. You’re safe!”
Steve glanced down the at the Hydra Supreme. The other Steve was covered in blood, his eyes wild, mad with fury and disbelief unable to accept he had lost, not believing that his prisoner, that Tony had been the one to shoot him.
A hand wrapped and squeezed comfortingly around his bicep. “How about, I get us some food and we can watch TV and have an early night,” Tony said gently. “I’ll even fend off those pesky SHIELD agents.”
“Good morning, Mam. Shall I bring breakfast out here for you both?” Jarvis asked. He always stood with his elbow bent at 90 degrees, arm held out horizontally in front of his chest. Tony thought it was a very awkward way of standing.
“He’s getting worse. I just can’t quite figure out what’s wrong with him.” Maria told the newest Doctor. Tony was sat limply in his mother’s lap, his face pressed into her chest so he didn’t have to see Doctor Everette’s face. Before the doctor had arrived, his mother had reminded him of his failures previously; he needed to show the doctor exactly how sick he was. “I’m at my wit's end, Jonathan. No one will take me seriously.”
Steve released Tony’s arm, wincing at the red band he had left in his wake. “Sorry.” He mumbled, not sure if he was apologising for the bruise, or for not thanking Tony for his help or for something more.
“Steve, you don’t want to see this….”  The AI was saying, voice rising with warning. Steve ignored him, batting the A.I. away as if he was an annoying fly.
Steve could feel his thoughts fraying, pulled apart by pain. He forced himself forward, each step a mammoth task. He altered his trajectory, aiming for where Tony had landed. Maybe, if he hadn’t been dizzy with pain, Steve would have hesitated; he would have remembered that they weren’t friends anymore, that they had destroyed their friendship. Tony had put him in jail and Steve had put Tony in hospital. But the pain made his mind slow and his body acted on autopilot. He turned a corner, stepping clumsily onto a boulevard.
Howard Stark paced around outside the room before a nurse walked up to him with a bunker in her arms. “How is my Son?” He asked her anxiously. The nurse’s smile faltered a bit at hearing this.
“Looks like we need to tell the world that my daughter is a genius. Organize a press conference Obie.” Howard said as Toni beamed up at him. A few hours later Toni was standing in front of Howard as cameras threatened to blind her with their flashes. Howard’s hand dug painfully into her shoulder as she fought not to cry out in pain from the crushing grip. She talked about how she had made the board. How she had shrunk it down to make it work.
He made his way towards where Obadiah Stane was standing with a cigar in his hand waiting on the news. He spotted Howard walking towards him and he smiled. “How’s the boy?”
He didn’t understand. Neither Doctor Everette nor his mother had explained what the scratch test was and he jolted like a live wire at the first sharp line that nicked into his back.
Tony smiled, no one had ever called him champ before. His mother called his Tesoro and Baby and Jarvis called him Tony. He liked Champ, it sounded exciting, grown up. “Hungry.” He said finally.
The car was seconds away, close enough that Steve could the snap of guns being cocked. “Tony, you need to go. Go now!”
Tony wasn’t sure how long it lasted; he thought it took a long time maybe but once he started breathing in the gas, time went unstable.
Tony’s face twisted and he shifted guiltily. “I didn’t say I didn’t like it.” He mumbled, staring down at his feet. Steve looked down at him softly. Tony was still hoping from one small foot to another, the movement flashing the red, singed soles of his feet. The boy must be in pain and yet hadn’t complained, hadn’t even mentioned his discomfort. He reminded Steve of the Tony he knew, quick to react to the perceived hurts in others but unwilling to share his own pain. There had been many times when Steve had nearly pulled out his hair in frustration after finding out about injuries Tony had kept quiet about. He couldn’t help but wonder sadly where that habit had come from; how young had Tony been when he’d learnt there was no point in telling people when he was hurt.
He had spent his life both loving and hating Captain America.  This thing that had sprung up between them had an air of inevitability about it, a giant fuck-you to Howard combined with his own personal fantasy fulfillment…how was he supposed to resist that?  Seriously, who got to literally exorcise their demons in the best possible way like that?  That should be enough for anyone. More than enough.
Steve would never tell his mother, since he knew that it would upset her, but he rather liked the nights when the mountains seemed to come alive.  It was, at least, something different, and besides, when the thunder echoed down the mountains, other things seemed to happen, too, though he wasn’t sure if anyone else noticed. Maybe they didn’t notice the other things because they were grown-ups and busy with all the grown-up things they had to do, like till the soil and plant and dye the wool and such, but things did happen when the mountains came alive, he was sure of it. Good things.
“Think the King will call you back tonight?”  Cam wondered.  “They left today.  Those people who were visiting.  I think he will.  Maybe he’ll need my help again, too.”
Granted, it was probably his own wildly vacillating thoughts that made him feel that way. A huge part of him kept wondering what he was doing here. What he hoped to find. What did it say about him that he was even here? What kind of hero did something like this? Tony. Tony did this, Steve reminded himself. If Tony did it, then it had to be okay. It helped him. Maybe it would help Steve. Maybe it would help him not look at punching bags and see body bags. Maybe he could sleep tonight and tomorrow night and the nights after that without utterly exhausting himself. Maybe he could do all of this again and again and again without worrying that it was going to be another God-damned bad day.
Steve seemed suitably impressed by the Tower, if by impressed you meant showed virtually no reaction to anything other than polite appreciation.  Olympic-size pool fifty floors up?  Well, you sir are no James Buchanan Barnes, that’s for sure.  Where were the questions about every, single God-damned thing?  The not-so-subtle trolling that no one would believe came out of Captain America’s mouth?
“That's amazing, Tony. Wow. Robots,” Steve said, giving his head another shake and huffing out a small peal of laughter.
“Gods, Steve,” Tony panted out in rough heaves, tipping his head back enough to put some space between them.
He slept, finally, long hours later, dreamless, until the metallic creak of the lockbar being lifted on the door woke him with a start.  Zola entered, flanked by two guards, an attendant and Steve’s least favorite overseer.  Steve went still.  His stomach swooped, as if he was falling.  A rush of cold swept over him and his hands balled into fists as his sides.  His stomach churned with a sick, helpless hatred.  There was a scream building in the back of his throat and it took all of his willpower to swallow it down.  He looked over at Cam, feigning sleep on his pallet and was thankful, at least, for the boy’s sense.
“Steve…” Tony breathed out, brow drawing together, something else, something cleverer, something better, hanging on his lips, but he couldn’t get it out.   “Are you…are you…okay?” Tony asked in halting, stuttering bursts when he could get the air out of his lungs.
“I want you to know that I have no intention of being the bigger man here and letting bygones be bygones about this,” Tony told him accusingly.  “This is going to come up at a team meeting, let me assure you. There might even be a memo. I know how much you love your memos.  I’ll title it, “Re: Avengers Should Not Pee on Each Other,” which, come to think, is probably not a bad thing to memorialize, let’s face it.”  Tony grinned at the image of handing that particular memo in to Steve, and Steve smiled back, tongue poking at his teeth and making a watery, slurpy sound, apparently just because he could.
That was nearly a week ago. It was the last time Steve mentioned anything about the Bonding to anyone, until Coulson told him the negotiations were complete and Anthony would be coming to meet Steve here at SHIELD, an unfortunate necessity given that Steve had a mission in the works that had required far too much planning to delay.  Steve would have far preferred Anthony’s home or someplace a bit more neutral than a SHIELD conference room for their introduction, but under the circumstances, it couldn’t be helped, he supposed. Privately, he wondered if this was part of some machination he couldn’t quite see, like so much of what went on under Fury’s purview, though he didn’t object.  He was probably destined to make a fool out of himself no matter what, but at least here, he had something of his feet under him. Everything was familiar by now. He wasn’t going to spend an hour watching people heat food in minutes in what he’d learned was called the ‘microwave,’ or ask the money machine in the wall to give him money like it was some kind of magic lamp.  That had been embarrassing.
Oh God, what if it hadn’t been good?  Why had he spent all that time studying thermonuclear astrophyics or clean energy solutions when he should’ve been focusing on important stuff like whether you were supposed to use some kind of scented oil in the bath and how to reinforce carpeting?  Stupid fucking MIT and their useless curriculum.
He was fairly certain the whole experience had been designed to make him more cooperative with Howard’s plans.  Be a good, little Omega, get on his knees and beg for some big Alpha to be so kind as to knot him.
Steve sighed.  He was apparently rather transparent, despite his best attempts to hide his feelings.  “Let’s just say I think the Tower is going to be a bit too crowded tonight.”
“Smooth,” Brock said, leaning back and grinning at him.  Steve flattened his mouth into a frown directed at his boyfriend, but felt hot embarrassment flood his face.
His throat was parched.  He remembered that from before.  That was a good sign, he supposed.  Gingerly, he propped himself up on his elbow.  Behind him, he could see the coils of the machine, just dark loops of shadows, but he knew it well enough by now to recognize it.  So, he was somewhere with the machine, but…not the SHIELD lab. And not Shuri’s lab.
“It isn’t perfect, I know.  But, it keeps the worst of it at bay, at least until you get a couple of dumb kids wanting to show off like today,” Steve said.  “We’re handling it. I—yeah, I do think it’s important, Tony.  But, it isn’t as important as you.  It never was, and I shouldn’t have let that get away from me.”
“It isn’t you. You’re, ah. You’re great. You’re actually exactly my—I mean, it isn’t anything to do with you. I just…I haven’t really been with anyone for awhile. Since my last relationship ended, really, and it wouldn’t be—I’d be using you,” Steve rushed out, all in one breath.
“I-I have this amazing, wonderful life, with everything I ever wouldn’t let myself want,” Tony husked out.    “I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m supposed to be happy. I know that, Jarvis, really, I’m trying.  I’m trying, but…sometimes…I didn’t know I wanted that, see?  Not just from Steve.  From anyone, really.  But now--now, I do, and I can’t make it go away.  I try, and I’m good for a while. I’m good.  Then. Then, he…he comes home from a mission I’m not supposed to think about with a coffee mug that says ‘Blame it on Dark Matter. Everyone Else Does,’ and a Wall-E poster that, hand to God, Jarvis, he tells me is for Dum-E and U.  How am I not supposed to, you know…feel things?”
“Steve. Um, it’s Steve. I’m Steve, that is,” Blondie said quickly. “Well, the bus you want’ll be a good hour or so before it picks up again. It only runs a few routes that go all the way back to downtown on the weekend, so. You don’t want to pick the one that only goes part way and get stuck. It can be kind of confusing if you’re not used to it,” the man—Steve—said helpfully. “So--ah—you’re—you’re kind of…” he trailed off, but waved a hand up and down in the air, apparently to point out that Tony looked like a drowned rat, perhaps the wire-stealing kind, Tony thought nonsensically. “Would you—I have a towel. You could, you know, dry off a bit. If you wanted,” the man offered. “While you wait for the bus.”
“Turn around,” Zola ordered.  Steve looked down at him, then over at the second pallet, where the boy’s dark head was barely peeking out of the thin blanket.  He turned.  Zola undid the metal skirt and pushed a finger between Steve’s cheeks, drawing a line up and over his hole.  “Hmmm,” Zola said, holding up his hand and rubbing his fingers together.  “Good. If you didn’t please him, I’ll hear of it, I can assure you,” Zola warned, lips curling as Steve just stood there impassively.  “Lord Hammer will want you tomorrow.  He always wants them when the King is done.  He’ll be good for you.  Take you down a few rungs.  Likes to fuck their mouths.  Likes to make sure you swallow it all,” Zola told him, tipping his head to the side and watching Steve with a predatory smile that looked a lot like hope.  “Now, clean yourself up.  You’re a mess.”
It wasn’t as if the tiny speedo Tony was wearing was effectively hiding much, Steve realized, as Tony rubbed his hips up and down over Steve’s wet swim trunks.  Blood pounded to Steve’s cock in a searing blaze of need, leaving him lightheaded for a moment as his hips juddered up against Tony’s.  He could feel a different kind of wetness gather around the head, warm against the cool, damp trunks that clung to him.
“Sir, I am currently unable to take orders from you. And I should tell you that one more word from you will likely result in my protocols requiring me to report you to the F.B.I., New York Police Department, SHIELD, and possibly the D.E.A.,” JARVIS informed him.
.  It isn’t like I haven’t tried putting all kinds of weird shit in my body since this thing in my chest started trying to kill me.  Truth is, I should be dead by now, anyway,” Tony sighed. “You saved me when you didn’t have to, so there’s at least that, and I guess this is some form of asking nicely, I don’t know. There’s a whole year of undergrad that’s a blur of ‘lie back and hope for the best’, so not like this is my first time around that particular block.  Fine. Let’s do this. God, I can just hear Rhodey Jiminy Cricket-ing in my head. If something bursts out of my chest in a few hours, I hope it eats you first. No offense,” Tony said, waving a hand in front of him as he settled back down on the table. “Come on,” he added, looking up at the alien, who sat next to him on his knees. “Get on with it.  Let’s have this ‘gift’ of yours,” Tony huffed, making air quotes with his hands. “I mean, I still say that sounds like a line. Just saying.”
“I can’t,” the boy protested weakly.  “My stomach…I’m too...if I eat, I’ll get sick.  If I get sick, Master Zola won’t send me tonight, and I don’t go, he’ll punish me or sell me or…I don’t know.  I have to go.   I have to do good,” Cam said, running his hands through his hair.  “I’m not going to do good, am I?  Oh, God, I’m going to mess up, I know it.  I know I am.  I am.  I’m…you said it was okay, right?  With the King, I mean?  You said it was alright,” he rushed out in an anxious, hitching voice.
“What?” Tony blurted out in confusion.  “Of course you can! What does that even—of course you can.  You’re fine.  Forget--forget what I said.  I didn’t mean that!  Hell, I’m the one who has the issues, really, we both know that.  If anyone shouldn’t be on the team, it’s me, let’s face it.  You’re—of course you can lead the team.”
“France?”  Tony repeated, slow-blinking at Steve like one of those dolls you tip up and down to put it to sleep or wake it up. “France.  Like, Marie-the-baguettes-France?  The country.  France.  Wait, why is France giving you a Bonding gift?  Did you insult England really, really well or something?” Tony asked, stupefied.  “Oh my God, you’re secretly the President of the Jerry Lewis Fan Club, aren’t you?  No, no, don’t tell me,” Tony continued, holding up a hand.  “I’ll never be able to look at you the same way.”
“Embrace it.  Own it,” Tony said, grinning madly. “Besides…there’s a hell of a severance package,” he leered.  Steve just shook his head, shoulders shaking with laughter.
“So, that was fun.  Who knew solving my company’s existential crisis just required mutilating a perfectly good bagel?” Tony huffed out as they exited.
Tony paused, watching Steve for long enough for Steve to start shifting his weight from one foot to the other in nervousness. “I know...” Tony began, voice soft and low.  “I know that’s all it can be.”  He sounded so defeated, so un-Tony-like that Steve sucked in a breath, finding himself blinking against the picture Tony presented as Tony sat there, waiting for Steve to react, to judge him, to yell at him, to berate him, even offering to let Steve hit him if it would help Steve feel better about this whole thing…all for the same thing Steve had been doing, all because Tony thought that was all this could ever be.
Tony watched as the alien turned his head slightly and looked down, not at Tony anymore, but at some part of the table. He reached over and tapped at something. Some kind of screen, then, Tony assumed.  The thing inside him moved to one side, then the other, while the alien started fixedly at the screen.
“I wanted to...I’d looked into it, but, actually we leave tomorrow, so...not this trip,” Steve replied. He looked back over at Tony.  They were treading too close to things Steve didn’t want to talk about.
“Then I broke up with you, and you didn’t have to,” Tony filled in for him.  “Is that,” he broke off, blinking hard and biting his lip as he tried to swallow past the lump in his throat. “Is that why you didn’t argue? Didn’t try to…”
Steve closed his eyes and bent over where his elbows lay on his thighs, letting his head dip low. He couldn’t deny Bucky’s words, wouldn’t deny them. It had been an honorable fight, though he couldn’t say the same for how he had felt afterwards, the deep, dark satisfaction that ran through him when he thought of it.
“I’m not taking away your math pie.  I don’t see why you get that, and I get, ‘Pumpkin pie is good for the digestion, James,’ but here we are,” Rhodey responded.  “They’re not going to disinvite you.  They like you.  And Steve. Who would Granny watch the parade with? She likes his stories.”
“You said, and I’m quoting, ‘Sorry for denting your wall.’ You dented my wall with me, Stark!” Fury ground out. Tony shrugged. Shield’s structural integrity, or lack thereof, wasn’t really his problem. “So, given all of that, you’re really just flummoxed at why I would feel the need to check up on you?” Fury asked shrewdly. “The only person to ever receive the full benefit of Erskine’s serum is having a child with a genius, billionaire, former playboy, philanthropist who happens to have access to—what are we up to now?—thirty something weaponized armored suits? All this surrounded by a group of the world’s most powerful people, including an Alpha who turns into an enormous green rage monster when someone gets testy with him or, apparently, shorts Steve’s Thai food order by a spring roll. Yes, I pay attention, don’t pretend to be shocked. Now, what about any of that could possibly raise my concern?”
“Your work is well renowned, Lord Hammer. Respected the kingdom over. I hear the whispers of the generals and the Council, you know. If the King fails to properly appreciate it, well…” Zola trailed off with an obsequious little bow of his head. “I’ll leave you to it, then, shall I?  Should you require anything further, I am your most humble servant, as always,” Zola vowed, while Hammer gave him a disinterested wave.
Everything in here was supposed to be soothing.  The walls were painted a warm, calming tan.  The sofa was overstuffed, with two pillows plumped in each corner.  The table was wood, homey, with an array of magazines spread out on top promising recipes and weight loss and summer tans, even though it was winter now, not that California was showing signs of acknowledging that occasion.  A metal-leaved tree hung on one wall, next to black-framed degrees. The doctor’s chair---no, therapist, that’s what they called them now.  The therapist’s chair was more streamlined than the sofa, but still a cozy, muted green.
The doors shut behind him. Somehow, the gym seemed far more empty than it had before, Steve realized as he looked around. He glanced over at the punching bag where the red dots from the impact of his knuckles formed a neat row just above the center. His eyes dropped down to the card in his hand. It was crazy, of course. Obviously, he couldn’t possibly do anything like what Tony suggested.
“One of the guys at work does porn on the side, and somehow, ended up doing all of these parodies.  Says there’s a niche market for them.  Forrest Hump.  Pulp Friction.  Honey, I Blew Everybody.  He’s very proud,” Steve said with a small lift of his shoulders.
A week dragged by without hearing the ringtone even once.  That pit that had been slowly opening in Steve's belly grew and grew, until finally he was able to call it acceptance.
“I did.  Every word,” Steve told him, his voice firm and unwavering.  “I’m not saying I’ll succeed.  I know I have a lot to work on, but… I’m going to do my damnedest to prove it to you, Tony.”
Tony stared down at his suitcase in consternation, then grabbed one more pillow and stuffed it in one of the corners. He was almost certain the island had plenty. He’d been pretty specific with his decorating order, after all, but you couldn’t be too careful.
“Seriously, why are you still here?” the King demanded, snapping his fisted hands together, then popping his fingers apart, his mouth twisting into an exasperated frown.  Zola looked up at him in surprise, turned and practically ran out of the room.
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Fugitive, big underwater prison thing, future of the planet on the line, yadda yadda,” Tony grumbled.  “Come home.”
“Here,” the King said, pulling a square of soft fabric from the pocket of his tunic.  “I believe I promised you a gift.”  Steve started blankly at the pouch in the King’s outstretched hand for a moment, then looked up at the King.  “Take it,” the King urged.  Steve did.  The pouch was heavy with something inside, and when he opened it, a large, round stone of bright blue, circled in gold, fell into his palm.  “I thought, perhaps, it would match your eyes, but I see now that it pales,” the King said, taking the stone from Steve’s hand and reaching up to hook its bail around the collar at Steve’s throat.  “There,” the King finished, with a satisfied look.  “It suits you, nonetheless.  Lets everyone know your value.”
Tony’s eyes had been running over him again, hands still rubbing over his arms and shoulders in gentle, sweeping motions, but at Steve’s words he went stock still.
He wasn't sure what to think about Steve, or, to more fine a point on it, Steve's easy acceptance of Tony's fit of retail therapy. And the garage thing. Letting him keep it to himself. He hadn't expected that. At...all. But, then again, he hadn't know that was going to turn out to be the hill he was going to be willing to die on, either. As soon as Steve had mentioned it, Tony knew he was going to fight tooth and nail to keep the garage, to keep it his, his space, his...his sanctuary.
So why did he still feel like he had missed something?  Like if he had just looked harder, said something profound, done something else instead of just falling asleep, that… something would be different.  He wasn’t sure what, or what he even wanted to be different, but--okay, that wasn’t true.  He wished Tony had been there in the morning, and then they could have… and that’s where his mind sort of swerved off into a blank sense of guilt-filled wistfulness that longed for something he wasn’t able, or ready, to name.
Steve could hear the music as the car pulled into a long, circular driveway behind a caravan of other dark-windowed sedans and limousines, all waiting to pass through the wrought-iron gates.  Bach, Steve thought, before the familiar strands stopped and gave way to something newer, some popular song he had missed.
The crowd finally thinned as their party approached the city wall, a tall, twisting structure of thick limestone blocks that circled the city.  Steeply angled to prevent siege towers from directly abutting it, the wall was wide enough for four horses to pull carts abreast and easily as high as six men.  Curved towers, harder to climb or lay siege engines against, crowned it at various points, with battlemented terraces on their tops.
“I know I said...but, I mean, this is, ah.  This is, you know, a lot of trust happening here, and I didn’t really think you meant, when you did the mind meld thingy with the powerpoint show of my life in pictures, I wasn’t really thinking...this, so,” Tony stammered.  He paused and watched the alien for a long moment as a series of emotions seemed to sweep across his--okay, fine--across his seriously, unfairly gorgeous features. It really wasn’t helping Tony’s decision making process that the alien looked like he stepped off the front page of intergalactic Grindr.
“What a day!  Never seen a crowd like that before,” Josiah said by way of greeting.  “Wonder what they were all having a gawk at?” he teased, giving Cam a wink. “The King’s Scribe, I think it must have been.  Word travels fast, young Cam.”
have said something similar.  Hard to tell.  You know how I word vomit when I get nervous.  Anyway, we’re moving to California together when all this is over.  I’m designing a toothpaste tube and a prosthetic arm that can flip people off. Because love, I guess,” Tony said, grinning manically as he waited for Rhodey’s response.
Steve finally pulled away and looked up at him.  “Not that I don’t have plans for that sofa cushion, but I never actually got my Thai food, what with Hulk showing up, and by the way, you tipped the delivery guy
“How did the meeting go?” Steve asked.  His shoulders were tight with tension, and Tony could see the muscle flexing in Steve’s cheek.  Worried.  About Tony.  Worried, but not scared, Tony noted.  Not scared, because they were in this, whatever it was, together.  And that made all the difference.
Steve wouldn’t do that.  He said.  He said he didn’t want that.  Not from Tony, anyway.  Tony squeezed his eyes shut and tried not to think about it, not to see it in his head, Steve behind him, stripping him, opening him, looking at him like that, displayed and ready, dripping with want.  He sucked in a harsh, shaky breath and shoved his fist in his mouth.  His body pulsed and jerked, another spurt of warm fluid spilling down his thighs.  Stop.  Stop it.
“Do you see an angry redhead in the cab next to us?” Tony asked, and Steve found himself turning to stare dumbly out the tinted window.
In Steve’s experience, pretty much everyone was always better at things. Faster.  Stronger.  All the things Alphas were supposed to be, and Steve had fallen somewhere down below Betas and even most Omegas by that measure, so he’d long ago stopped letting himself be intimidated by people who were better than he was and started admiring those who put that to good use. Like Bucky and Peggy, who would both probably get in line to box his ears if he had a whiff of a problem with his Omega being some kind of genius.
“I think it would be smart. But, I was once told rather firmly that it should be your decision, and while that does make me want to bend cutlery, I’ll settle for your promise to take care of yourself,” Steve prompted.
Sam was quiet for a long moment, eyes locked on Steve. Then, his mouth twisted into a grimace and he drew in a long breath.
Hands gripped his hips, holding him steady, and the King began to thrust in earnest, long, deep strokes punctuated by shallow, quick ruts of his hips that kept Steve on the edge of something, not able to find purchase, his whole body thrumming as the King slammed his cock into him again and again.  The only sounds in the room were the slaps of wet skin, the occasional grunt as the King pounded his cock into Steve and Steve’s own gasping moans that slowly gave way to pleading, nonsensical cries.  A wave of pleasure built inside him, holding him at the top.  Steve reached for his own weeping cock, only to feel the hands holding his hips give a sharp, hard squeeze.
“Yes,” Tony cut him off, holding his fingers up to Steve’s mouth to silence him.  “I will give you one each day, and perhaps you shall know my regard for you as well as my people do.”
Steve huffed out a snort of air that clearly said he wasn’t buying Tony’s noncommittal answer any more than Tony was.
A one-way trip, Steve thought, an uncomfortable shiver snaking up his spine.  What would happen to him, he had asked, if he stayed, stuck in a past where he had to watch himself make the same mistakes?  What was he supposed to do, just sit there? Do nothing, Bruce warned. Nothing. Say nothing, except what had to be said. Even that was probably too much, but could the outcome really be any worse?  That question went unspoken and unanswered, but Steve supposed they all agreed on the answer. It couldn’t be worse. No matter if everything went wrong with this crazy plan. It couldn’t really be worse. A saving grace, if such a thing existed anymore.
“Don't get ahead of yourself, Tones,” Rhodey cautioned with a slight frown from where he sat on the seat next to Tony.
“I was talking to Stark,” Bucky jerked his head at Tony.  “Still can’t believe all this is because someone paid
“Uh-uh, not anyone. Not you.  You said,” Stark pointed at him, “But now you’re here. Look at that,” he smiled. It should have been obnoxious, Steve thought, but it somehow flew past that mark.
“This is where you tell me he has a great personality, right?” Steve chuckled, taking a sip from his beer.  Craft beer, they called them.  Twenty-seven on tap, or so the sign said.  The future left many things to be desired, but sometimes, it got things incredibly right.
“Okay, see, I'm going to need more syllables here, Steve,” Tony protested, running a frustrated hand through his hair. He started to pace in the small space between the uglier of the mismatched bookcases and the low coffee table where a textbook lay open to a page proclaiming Americans and the Great War over a grainy black and white photo of dirt-faced young men hunched down against the curve of a trench. Why was it so difficult to ask what he really wanted to ask?
“You’re kidding me with this, right?” Tony demanded, throwing his cloth napkin on the table in apparent disgust.  “Not hurt, he says,” he muttered under his breath.  “Why don’t you just ask me for the money?”
Steve woke up with a start, sitting up in bed. His breath was coming in pants and he was dripping with sweat.  His heart was slamming against his ribs. Next to him, he felt Tony stir, and looked over at him as he slowly blinked awake.
Ty was truly a man of the world. He studied philosophy, literature, religion. Hell, he could quote Nietzsche, the Dalai Lama and Hunter S. Thompson interchangeably.  He even spent a summer at some temple in Nepal finding his spiritual center or whatever he called it. Tony couldn’t remember.  It had sounded impressively cool when Ty talked about it, though Tony couldn’t quite recall why.  Something about chakras? Anyway, all Tony could manage was the occasional Monty Python reference and an encyclopedic knowledge of Lord of the Rings.  That was…definitely not as cool.
“Okay, Tony.  But, if you need anything…Any. Thing. At. All,” Pepper enunciated sternly.  “You tell me, alright?”
It was a simple, clear imperative in his head.  He liked that.  Everything here was always so twisted and messy, full of unknowns and hidden meanings.  But, the idea that these people shouldn’t be thinking about Tony was a straight-edged throughline in his mind.  He knew them, these Alphas. He knew who they were and what they did.  Tony,
“Still thinking about robots?” Steve asked.  He barely sounded winded.  Tony shot him an annoyed look over his shoulder. Well.  Mostly, he turned his head from where he was grinding his forehead into the mattress and drooled in Steve’s general direction, but whatever.  He felt he made his point.  Steve laughed then, and sped up his thrusts, giving quick, hard snaps of his hips that soon lost all sense of rhythm.
