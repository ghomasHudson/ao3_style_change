The room they're in is dark, so Tony doesn’t know how it's possible, but Steve’s eyes look shockingly blue in that moment.
“I don’t know about you,” Steve interjects, bringing his lips up to Tony’s ear, voice dropping into a whisper, “but I’m pretty tired.”
“Don’t you think you should tell us both?” he asks, and Steve thinks, what further harm could it do at this point?
“Oh, Steven! Come, join us, we were just speaking of you!” Thor turns a large grin on Steve, beckoning him over and Tony takes it back. There’s nothing about Thor that he likes. Absolutely nothing.
When Tony licks inside his mouth, hands now on Steve’s sides, insistently pulling him impossibly closer, Steve feels need and desperation pooling low in his body. His body is quickly learning the feel of Tony’s against it and he doesn’t know what he’s going to do when it’s taken away again.
“Those friends that you’re replacing you mean? Alright, Rhodey,” Tony says, reaching forward to clasp the kid on the shoulder, careful to avoid jostling him. His eyes are wide with fear, and Tony’s mind flashes back to Phil for a moment. To the there-one-second, gone-the-next look in his eyes that Tony still doesn’t entirely believe that he saw, before the anaesthesiologist put him under.
“Thanos is coming. From 2014. We were betrayed, the Nebula that returns from Morag is not the one who left with Rhodey, Nat—” Here his breath hitches again. “Nat won’t make it back,” he told Tony the same thing only moments ago but he can’t stop the air catching in his lungs, and watches his past self recoil as if hit. “There’s a battle. Tony—”
A desire that Tony resents with the next words out of Steve’s mouth: “You’re hurt, Tony, we can’t do this now.” His voice is faintly reprimanding, even as Tony leans up to latch his lips onto the pulse point below his jaw. He listens to Steve’s breathing stutter and relishes the victory. It’s a short-lived one when Steve refuses to resettle his weight.
“Sure,” Tony scoffs, “it’s easy to say that, but we all know that I’m going to be the one left holding the knife.” He feels himself deflate momentarily, the confidence he’d been riding since his talk with Bruce waning. He refuses to meet Steve’s eyes, because the last thing he wants right now is to be forced to deal with the understanding he knows he’ll see there.
“Hi, sweetie,” his mother greets him, her voice soft and brittle, made that way over years of being talked over in conversations, of giving way to the two dominant personalities in her home. Even on the phone she remains as unobtrusive as possible, always defers to the other side of the conversation. Tony hates it.
“No, no, no,” Tony steamrolls right over anything Steve might be about to say. He needs to get this out or he might never try again. “It’s my turn, you can talk later,” he says, waving a hand dismissively.
“Was a dare,” he groans, despite the painkillers now pumping into his body. “My friends, they dared me.”
They’re half way to radiology when Fury catches up with them. His expression is thunderous as he moves to block their path, everyone else in the corridor giving them a wide berth as they pass. Tony wonders if they shouldn’t have taken the alternate route.
He’s dimly aware of his hands clenching and unclenching, high on Tony’s thighs, where they’re still holding him aloft.
“Right…” Clint says, reminding Tony of his presence, “any plans aside from ‘enjoying the scenery’ and maiming hospital employees?”
Once he’s set Parker a task that he’s rather sure the intern is capable of, he turns to the patient, keeping himself on the kid’s right side while Natasha stays on his left and the rest of the team flit around like worker bees in the hive. He stays out of their way as best as he can; aware he’s not capable of physically practicing medicine right now.
He hates Steve for always doing this to him, for chipping away at his walls until he wants nothing more than to bury his head in the warm juncture between Steve’s shoulder and neck and pretend the world doesn’t exist.
Steve’s mind fractures and the warm, vibrant body in his arms is suddenly replaced with his last sight of Tony on the battlefield, the right side of his face burned, his body struggling to draw in enough air, FRIDAY’s voice saying “life functions critical”. And there’s something new working its way through his body, a sob building, and before he can rein it in it shudders out of him as buries his head into Tony’s shoulder and gasps wetly.
But the memories aren’t real, only imagined ones that his brain had conjured after the fact, to torture him with his failure. The truth is that Steve had kept his distance, watching Pepper and Rhodey and Peter cry over Tony while Steve stood frozen, because no matter how Steve (now realises he) felt, Tony was never his to keep and he could never be enough to hold him in the world.
“I’m…” he weighs the word in his mouth, “reconsidering.” He turns back to Parker: “Dr Parker, present.”
“Sure do. Bruce and I talked about it. Piece of cake.” He waves a hand dismissively, but Steve still looks unconvinced.
By the time he makes it to the top of the mountain, the chill hasn’t abated despite the pleasant ache in his muscles. It takes him a moment to notice the dark, floating figure in the shadows.
, Steve wants to say but holds back. “You should rest, I’ll show you a chamber you can stay in,” she says, turning away and expecting him to follow.
They remain that way for another ten minutes, watching as people hurry around, the constant activity of the hallway reminding Tony that in the grand scheme of things, his little problem isn’t much compared to all the life-changing activities going on in the hospital right now.
He ducks behind a pile of supplies as he watches his younger self—and though it’s been only a few days and it seems ridiculous to think of this Steve as younger in any meaningful way, Steve feels infinitely older than he did when he was walking around this camp, tentatively hopeful of what the future might bring—turn around.
Tony knows that the odds he’s actually rendered Fury speechless are slim, so he doesn’t have any plans to wait around for the chief to recover his wits and decide to punish Tony regardless.
The truth, of course, is infinitely more complicated. Somewhere along the way, probably on some occasion when he and Steve had been wrapped around each other, when he'd been pressed up against Steve's warm skin and miles of muscles that had no place on a surgeon, a small part of Tony had started hoping that maybe this could be more than just a tumble with a co-worker in an on-call room.
“It’s my home, you know. In a way my parents’ house wasn’t, boarding school definitely wasn’t, and college…” he huffs a sigh, aware that he’s rambling but unable to make his thoughts more coherent. “I grew up here, you know. Following my dad around, running up and down the halls, falling asleep in employee lounges,” Steve raises an eyebrow and Tony chuckles, conceding. “Okay, I guess I’m still doing that…”
His younger self looks sceptical, but after a quick outfit swap, Steve fixes the band on his wrist and puts in the date.
“No, I—I have to believe it can be better,” Steve says, and watches his counterpart disappear wearing the uniform Steve stole at Camp Lehigh, with the note Steve wrote about Bucky in its pocket.
Tony feels like he’s standing on relatively solid ground as he waits for Steve’s response. Sure, there’s a part of him that’s holding its breath, just waiting for Steve to turn away, but that’s neither here nor there. Most of him is confident. Fine, at least 67% of him is confident. Then Steve does something that sweeps Tony’s footing out from underneath him; he laughs. Tony feels it rumble through Steve’s body, and if Tony couldn’t see the delight in Steve’s expression he’d start worrying that maybe Steve was laughing
“We spend years reading books and call ourselves surgeons—as if that means something—we pick up knives and cut into people in the name of science, as though we have any right to— we should call ourselves butchers and be done with it.” He won’t look Steve’s way but he can feel his gaze like a physical sensation, a weight he isn’t sure he can bear right now. He pushes away from Steve’s hold, arms thrown out wide. “We try and we try but—People die, they do it all the goddamn time and nothing—fuck! Nothing we do matters.” He lashes out, fist impacting with the wall, the drywall crumpling beneath it. He can’t even muster any relief that it wasn’t a load-bearing wall, that his two-million-dollar-a-year hand isn’t a mess of blood and broken bones.
Shit. How did Steve not realise that this is where Tony ran into his father? He watches the surprise steal over Tony’s face as he recognises the voice calling out, and Steve knows who it is that Howard’s looking for, and he feels a frisson of anger rattle through him. So this is it, Operation Paperclip.
Steve’s hands remain steady on Tony’s waist, bunched in the fabric of his scrub top, which gets rucked up with every movement. Steve’s hand is impossibly warm (and god, what is he, a furnace?) when it finally touches Tony’s skin, tracing up his side. Tony’s considering the logistics of freezing time and having this moment stretch on forever when Steve takes back some of the control, pressing him back into the bed and draping part of his weight over Tony’s slighter form. The shift of their bodies is enough to jostle Tony’s injured hand and his groan of pain is muffled against Steve’s mouth. Of course, Steve hears it anyway and pulls back.
“Fine,” Tony says, wondering how much longer he has to be here today to keep up the pretence of being a caring son.
“I hear Fury’s making you cut into parasite guy’s head,” says Clint, displaying his usual amount of tact, popping another chip into his mouth with an audible
Tony’s absence feels like a hole has been carved into the world, and Steve is fighting to keep from sliding into the abyss he’s left behind.
mattered. I didn’t know how anyone could survive after a fall like that, he looked so small on the stretcher. I thought he’d broken his back or something, not to mention the state of his arm. But they saved him. He even kept the arm. I remember thinking that they were like superheroes.” He ducks his head to catch Tony’s gaze, the negligible distance between them narrowing even further.
There are so many ways Tony could react to Steve’s admission. So many ways he wants to react. He could dwell on the terrifyingly soft, earnest look in Steve’s eyes when he says the word ‘love’ and looks at Tony, or he could brush it off as nothing more than a coincidence.
“If you’re sure, Cap,” Bruce replies, something uncertain flickering behind his eyes, but Steve knows he isn’t the only one hiding behind a veneer of
There’s hope wavering in her expression and he’s careful to meet her gaze head on. He’s confident, and wants her to know that. Steve’s words have been banished to the back of his mind.
Those two had hit it off pretty much right away. Up until that point, Tony had suspected that Natasha was incapable of being nice to anyone but Clint, and theirs was a history he hadn’t even attempted to parse through. Sure, she was always civil and he’d even seen her smile at Thor a few times, but Tony had never been on the receiving end of one.
“Patient Phil Coulson, 49, admitted for a serious case of neurocysticercosis,” Tony tilts his head toward where the patient’s sister, Maria, still stands. “Er…parasites in the brain,” Peter explains, glancing towards her, sheepish. “MRI shows eight cysts in total, almost all of which are blocking the third ventricle, patient has already suffered one seizure and diagnosis indicates that without immediate surgery, the frequency of the seizures could increase and lead to elevated ICP, which could lead to a coma and...” One look at the horrified expression on Maria’s face is enough to halt the words in Peter’s throat.
“I’m sorry, my friend,” Thor says, clapping him on the back with one of the massive paws that he uses to break and reset bones down in ortho, “but I fear that you are mistaken.” Thor always speaks as though he should be living in a regency-era aristocratic family—it’s one of the things that Tony secretly likes about him. “While they do indeed speak of all those that you mentioned, they undoubtedly prefer to focus on your affair with Steven.”
When Steve talks again, Tony can feel the little puffs of air against his skin. “I realised that’s what surgeons do, Tony. They’re not butchers, they’re artists. And even today, I can remember that feeling of helplessness. That was when I decided that I never wanted to be in that position again.” His hand brushes against Tony’s again, light enough to avoid hurting him. “To watch someone I love in pain and not be able to help them.”
“You’re carrying a heavy burden,” she says, completely derailing the thoughts spiraling through his head. “You have suffered terrible loss for one so young.”
“Keep telling yourself that,” he says, throwing himself into the seat opposite Fury’s. “But in the interest of letting you maintain your delusion, I’ll be brief. Not like I want to spend any more time in your glowing presence anyway.”
Tony’s learned to cope with this, the blankness in his father’s gaze when he looks at him, even on his more lucid days, when he starts rambling about his friend Obadiah and fiancée Maria, and the good old days when he’d revolutionised Shield’s neurology department and invented the ‘Stark Method’ to fight brain tumours. Most of the time he still doesn’t recognise Tony.
“No,” Steve says, shaking off the lingering choking despair and willing his conviction into the warm brown eyes staring into his with a mix of fear and trust. “You’re not going to die.”
There are some days when Tony desperately wishes he’d grown up wanting to be something other than a surgeon. He could have been anything, done anything. Could have been a lawyer or the CEO of a multinational company or an engineer…Man, he would have made a great engineer. He’d have been the best damn engineer in the world; built fighter jets and flying cars and invented a sustainable, pollution-free energy source that saved the whole fucking world.
It’s only minutes later that Tony feels his body dropping off, his eyelids heavy and the steady beat of Steve’s heart lulling him into slumber, so he almost doesn’t catch the words that Steve breathes into his skin, his voice heartbreakingly earnest: “You’re my home, too, Tony.”
“Let’s get this outta you,” he says, as the general anaesthetic takes effect. Watching the kid’s eyes close, he vows that he’s going to be there when they open again.
From what Steve understands of this whole time travel thing, telling this Tony anything won’t change anything for his Tony. No matter how much he wishes it would, but that doesn’t mean that this Tony has to die. The universe has already exacted its price, and as far as Steve is concerned even one Tony Stark is far too high a price, why should it get two?
Instead, he lets Steve have his moment before he interrupts. “Okay, I’m glad that you find my emotional distress so amusing, but—”
“Nothing,” he plasters a fake smile on his face, “nothing at all.” Forcing himself to his feet, he throws his hands out in what he hopes is a placating gesture.
“You didn’t think it was odd that I never talked about or introduced you guys to anyone else? In all the years we’ve known each other?” Steve shrugs, fixing his look somewhere over Tony’s shoulder.
“Perhaps you will soon have to make some choices of your own,” she says cryptically. “You look tired,” and there’s a hand coming to rest on his cheek.
“I came to warn Tony about something,” Steve says, carefully avoiding the question and rising to his feet, reaching a hand out to pull Tony up. If Steve holds Tony’s hand for longer than strictly necessary, no one says anything.
“Of course, it’s all part of my charm,” Clint grins. It reminds Tony of the first time he’d met Clint.
“Well, yeah, but I don’t see how it’s any more difficult than just the one.” Bruce says, turning away when the computer at his desk makes a sound. He doesn’t return to Tony’s side after checking whatever it was, apparently declaring the discussion over.
“Hey, Steve, no, it’s okay,” Tony says, holding Steve in place, his movement arrested with Tony still close and soft and warm in front of him. “You just surprised me, is all, look it’s fine,” Tony says, and Steve can’t believe it when he tugs Steve forward again, wrapping his arms around him. “I was just kidding about you not trusting me to get this done,” he says, and there’s still a question there, “I mean, no big deal, right?”
“If that were true, you wouldn’t be holding that right now,” she says, tilting her head towards the hammer still held in Steve’s hand, his knuckles white with the force of his grip.
“Well, the other place I spent a lot of time, was in hospitals,” as he speaks, Steve moves the hand not cradling Tony’s to Tony’s side, drawing him away from the wall and back towards the bed. “I don’t know if you know, but my mom was a nurse, so on days when I was too sick to stay home alone, she’d take me to work with her. I’d sit in the nurse’s lounge and watch as nurses and doctors went about their work.”
On Morag, he steps past the unconscious body of Peter Quill to leave the power stone, and feels something prickle across the back of his neck but there’s nothing there.
Steve grins in triumph for a moment, jacking his hand hard and fast, and their lips are pressed together, more gasping breaths into each other’s mouths than kissing. Steve knows he isn’t going to last much longer, and if the way Tony is grinding down on the hand still on his ass and thrusting into his hand is any indication, he isn’t either.
“If you laugh at me now, Steve Rogers, I’m climbing off you and going to go confess my love to somebody else.” Tony warns as Steve’s lips, still red and far too inviting, quirk into a smile.
Tony from only a few days ago, walk across Camp Lehigh with no knowledge that in such a short time Tony will be—
“You should respect your friends’ choice,” Schmidt says, with what is definitely an undue amount of glee, like he knows exactly what he’s doing.
“What do you want, Stark? I know you think my life revolves around you, but you’re sorely mistaken.”
The cysts sit, heavy and inflated, almost entirely blocking the third ventricle of the patient’s brain
“Can you finish your story? If you don’t mind, I mean…” He almost doesn’t recognise the timid person who voices the question. He’s Tony-fucking-Stark, not this uncertain, weak shell of a man.
“Now, I want you to know, Captain Cardio,” Clint says, kicking his chair back to balance on two legs, “that normally I’d be rolling my eyes at you trying to turn everything into a heart issue,” he says, a fake reprimanding look on his face as he points at Steve. “But, in this case I might have to agree that that’s actually a good idea.”
He watches Maria’s face crumple when he gives her the news. The taste of bile sits heavy in his throat.
“You know me,” he claps Steve on the shoulder, dislodging his hand and dismissing the obvious concern in his gaze, “I’m always okay.”
“What did you say you guys were talking about?” He asks, settling down between Thor and Natasha. Natasha pushes her tray over, silently offering Steve his pick of the food on it. Steve picks up the pudding Tony had been eyeing and Natasha doesn’t even care.
“What are you going to do without your…thing?” his counterpart asks, holding up his wrist and waving his other hand in its direction.
“Have you checked her heart?” Asks Steve, drawing Tony’s reluctant attention. “It’s rare but an arrhythmia could cause seizures.”
Three years later, and Steve and Tony have traded in wanting to stab each other with scalpels (Tony can’t say he never considered it) to simply wanting each other, falling into this weird on-again-off-again relationship pattern that Tony’s best friend (and occasional psychiatrist) Pepper thinks is a direct result of Tony’s inner self-loathing and commitment issues and Tony maintains is because neither he nor Steve are looking for anything serious.
Having made his decision, Steve could put his plan into motion while his counterpart is still unconscious, but Steve knows he’d want to be given the option, and while he isn’t sure what he’ll do if he doesn’t receive the answer he’s looking for. That’s a bridge he’ll have to cross when he gets to it. It’s about trusting that he knows what the unconscious man wants more than anything else, and trusting his
And that might actually be worse, because that means that Steve hadn’t needed to keep his distance or fight the feeling that had come bubbling up his chest when Tony turned up with a solution to all their problems and Steve’s shield stashed in the trunk of his car after everything Steve had done to prove he didn’t deserve it.
Steve claps a hand over Tony’s mouth, amusement still evident in the easy curl of his lips and softness in his eyes. “No, you’ve said your bit, it’s my turn now.” He waits until Tony nods his acquiesce before removing his hand.
Steve reaches with an arm and Mjölnir is flying towards him because he has to get away from Thor, he has to get to Tony, but Thor snatches it out of the air, dropping it to his side.
Tony chuckles, head dipping in a bow, and Steve forces himself to step away, to separate himself from Tony’s gravitational pull. His mostly-silent double watches them with an awareness that this moment isn’t for him.
“That’s good. Wow, time travel, huh? Every time I think things can’t get any weirder…” There’s a wry twist to his mouth. “When did you come from? If you can tell me, that is.”
“Yep, was an easy fix, I installed a pacemaker so now she’s good to go. Yet another kid saved by my brilliance,” Clint says, eyes still fixed on Tony.
Mechanic’s hands, covered in callouses and scars, work roughly against the length of Steve’s cock and Steve doesn’t have a lot of experience with this sort of thing, but Tony is so confident in his body, in Steve’s reaction to what he’s doing. He’s watching Steve with the kind of certainty that
, Tony shouldn’t be the one comforting him, but he can feel the flutter of Tony’s heart against his back, the rise and fall of his chest, the strength of his arms, determined to hold Steve together even as he shakes apart.
“Hey Stark,” Steve echoes, not even bothering to tamp down on the grin that wants to burst across his face. “Pretty sure I was promised shawarma. You’re not the only one who hasn’t tried it, you know.”
He takes the two steps needed to bring him to Steve and drops one leg to either side of the other man’s thighs, leaving Tony straddling his lap. Steve’s hands come up to bracket his hips reflexively, his eyes searching Tony’s.
He watches from his limited vantage point, breath caught in his throat as the other Steve’s eyes flick over his hiding place, returning to focus on their next step only when Tony says something to him. Steve breathes a sigh of relief. If there’s one thing he’s sure of this time around, it’s that he needs to not let his younger self see him. He tells himself bullshit excuses, that the temptation to warn him, to tell him what’s to come, will be too much; that he’s there to return the space stone, and nothing else. In and out. Focus on the mission.
Before he’s quite thought through the potential consequences of his actions—and Steve is self-aware enough to know that this is definitely one of his failings—Steve has plugged a date in, made a quantum jump, and he’s watching himself and Tony—
“No, wait,” Tony whispers, breath feather-light over Steve’s lips, “you caught me off guard. Just wait.” And it’s the gentle grasp of Tony’s fingers, and the lack of hatred in his eyes, that has Steve stalling his movements.
With absolute perfect timing, the indecision takes the opportunity to rear its head again, and the doubt rushes back. He’d been grappling with it the entire walk over and though he’s almost certain he’s about to do the right thing, there’s a lingering sense of obligation that scratches away at the back of his mind. Unsurprisingly it’s his father’s voice telling him he’s a disappointment, that
“What the hell were you doing in an abandoned house?” Tony asks, trying to bring the patient’s attention back to him. He can see others moving around, getting ready to remove the rebar and pack the wound so he doesn’t bleed out before they get him into surgery.
“Yeah, I dropped by to see how Howard was doing. No big deal,” Tony shrugs, the movement automatic although she can't see it.
“Not that I’d know why anyone would want to get into a relationship with me—beyond the obvious.” He gestures up and down to his body, a smirk plastered on his face. It slips off quickly. “But even if they did, my bucketload of issues would probably chase them away pretty fast,” he says, and he isn’t being self-deprecating, just honest.
Both Steve and Tony whip around to find Steve, this Tony’s Steve—and damn if that doesn’t shoot a flare of bitterness and irrational jealousy, that he still has a Tony to take home with him, nevermind that Steve had that same Tony’s mouth panting against his not too long ago—standing in the doorway, arms crossed and looking distinctly unimpressed at Steve’s presence.
“Shh,” Tony whispers, his forehead soft against the side of Steve’s face, and breath ghosting against his ear. “It’s going to be fine, just breathe, a few deep breaths,” Tony says, and while Steve comes back into an awareness of his body, and the sound of Howard’s receding footsteps, the awareness also brings with it a renewed sense of every part of Tony’s body that is currently pushed against his, from knees to chests. The pulse that tingles through him this time is definitely not anger or fear or adrenaline, but something much bigger, so big it feels ready to claw its way out of his chest and swallow the world whole.
“Steve, you’re scaring me, I need you to ease up for a minute,” Tony’s voice has a slight hitch in it and that more than anything has Steve dropping his arms and scooting backwards because the thought that he’s hurt Tony again is enough to bring him right back into the moment.
But then Steve had arrived and Natasha had pretty much welcomed him with open arms. Of course, it isn’t that unusual that someone would take a shine to Steve—Tony suspects that it’s physically impossible to dislike the guy (his own initial feelings notwithstanding), but that even Natasha had warmed up to him right away, when Tony had been incapable of carrying a proper conversation with her, is more than a little disconcerting. (Not to mention that she was close to Steve back when he and Tony couldn’t even be in a room together without sniping at each other.)
“It’s Phil. I uh—he’s—” he trips over the words, his tongue suddenly feeling heavy and inarticulate in his mouth. “You were right.”
,” Tony’s never heard the word uttered so scathingly before—if it hadn’t been directed at him, he’d be impressed—but Fury never raises his voice and fuck if that doesn’t just piss Tony off more, “I am the Chief of Surgery and I don’t care what you
And Tony doesn’t know what to do with that, so he wraps his arms around Steve’s familiar, reassuring form, and takes whatever strength he’s willing to offer.
“Not if I can help it,” and Steve knows it’s probably a colossal, stupid mistake, knows that if his Tony were here he would say something like,
But the worst part, the worst part is that it doesn’t matter who you are or what you do, there’s no way to avoid it. What you eat, how much you exercise, none of it fucking matters.
“How…how was he? When you saw him?” She asks, voice unsteady enough to make him nervous. He thinks about the visit, about Howard’s behaviour.
He considers Tony for about 20 seconds during which Tony has to fight to keep himself from either making an offhand remark about how ridiculous that suggestion is (something that will surely give him away), or simply getting up and making a hasty retreat down the hall. Tony does neither of those things and Clint seems to find what he’s looking for.
Afterwards, Tony can only recall disjointed fragments of the events in the OR. The uncharacteristic tremor in his hand as he made the first cut; securing and deflating the first cyst; his unrelenting grip on the forceps; watching the fourth scolex die in the petri dish;
“I’ve got my interns prepping a patient for an appy so I might swing by and subject them to a bit of fear and humiliation,” she says, and Steve looks absolutely horrified at her admission and Clint snickers openly. “If I publicly eviscerate one of them every once in a while, the others fall in line a lot quicker,” she offers, by way of explanation, before sauntering out the door.
It was only later, after a lot of shouting and confused questions that Tony found out Clint was the new head of paeds and that he came highly recommended. Sure, he’s snarky and a bit eccentric, but Tony hardly has a corner on the market of “normal”.
“Has anyone ever considered doing an experiment to study out how fast news travels around here? Because this is like, scary fast,” he leans back in his chair and briefly considers stealing a pudding cup off Natasha’s tray before thinking better of it. She’s almost certainly got a scalpel hidden somewhere on her person and Tony’s hands are way too valuable to risk a stab wound. The woman is the genius with a blade when you put her in the OR—Fury himself chose her to take over his position as head of general surgery when he stepped down the year before—but outside the OR she’s a little terrifying.
Steve wakes with a strangled gasp, his heart hammering in his ears. Even awake, with the sounds of the battlefield and the taste of blood in his mouth fading, Steve can feel the earth beneath his knees and the solidity of Iron Man beneath his hands.
Steve shifts his grip slightly, one hand slipping around the curve of Tony’s ass, and now Tony is grinding against Steve in uneven, frantic movements while Steve’s other hand goes to work on finishing the job of getting Tony’s pants open. Steve can feel Tony’s own erection straining against the fabric of his slacks, and when he gets his own hand around it, giving it a sharp tug, the breath punches out of Tony and the hand he has on Steve stutters in its rhythm.
The day finally comes and he meets Bruce, Sam and Bucky by the lake, near the spot where they grieved for Natasha, and it feels right that this is where he’ll say goodbye.
There’s no fear or worry in Schmidt’s face, only something assessing as he looks at Steve, something that sees far too much. His eyes drift, covetous, towards the case that Steve dropped in his haste.
Tony is considering the pros and cons of waking Steve when he feels the other man moving against his back, the arm around him tightening slightly.
“So…I got a call from mom yesterday. She’s doing well. Says she’s going to come by to drop off some of the books you asked for…so that’s good, I guess…” He fixes his gaze somewhere over his father’s shoulder. The visiting room is surprisingly empty, only a few families take up the available clusters of seats and Tony imagines, for a moment, what they’re talking about. Whether their conversations feel as stunted, how they feel about looking their friends and relatives in the eyes and seeing no recognition there.
Instead, he shifts on the bed, his body sliding forward until it is pressed up against Steve, the bulk of his form is familiar. Tony feels his muscles relaxing in response. Although both men are of a similar height, the sheer width of Steve’s upper body is enough to make Tony feel sheltered, something Tony often (secretly) relishes.
Clint disregards his silence and pushes on, a definite teasing note in his voice. “Look, Stark,” and though the two of them are friends, Tony can count on one hand the number of times he’s heard Clint call him by his first name. “I know you’re emotionally stunted, but can you do something about the tension already? The rest of us are over it, I don’t know how you’re not.”
“Yeah, sorry,” he plasters a fake smile on his face and hopes Bruce can’t tell. “You operate the Quantum Tunnel. I’ll be back before you know it.”
That doesn’t mean it isn’t weighing on him. Every time someone asks him about his father he mumbles out another lie—he’s travelling with doctors without borders, he’s writing another book, he’s planning his next clinical trial.
through Steve, and he didn’t think he could get any harder than he already was, but he can feel his cock swelling in Tony’s hand.
“About what, exactly?” Tony asks warily, because it’s better to play dumb than make a fool out of himself by misunderstanding (or giving away too much).
“Yep, definitely,” he says, giving her a bright smile. “Now, you, Parker, get over here!” He demands, and the intern hurries over to his side.
Steve is aware of his counterpart’s eyes on him, watching what Tony’s death will do to him in such a short time; conscious of Tony, watching him tear pieces of himself away to leave them lying in a heap, leaving him nothing more than a mess of bones and nerves that have been scraped raw.
The patient is a teenage boy—Tony guesses about 16—with sweat matting his black hair to his forehead and a piece of rebar jammed through his abdomen and, evidence suggests, his spine.
The thing about Alzheimer’s is that the odds of developing it under the age of 65 are only 4 percent.
He places a hand on Tony’s arm, the touch firm and grounding, bringing Tony’s focus back to the busy hospital hallway filled with doctors and nurses rushing around, each of them with somewhere to be, someone to save. And Steve. Steve with his kind eyes, watching Tony warily.
“Wow, try to rein in the amount of info you’re heaping on us there. I don’t know if our little brains can handle it,” Clint says, eyebrow quirked.
Tony scrutinises the expression and realises that Fury’s most likely fighting to keep all his pain at losing his friend buried behind a façade of anger, that blaming Tony is probably the easiest solution for him right now.
“Hey, hey! How am I getting all the blame here? What about Thor and that resident—Jane? Or Bruce and Betty and their ‘forbidden love’,” he makes sure to punctuate the statement with air quotes. “Or you two!” He points accusingly towards Clint and Natasha, who stare stonily back at him. “Don’t pretend they aren’t whispering about you and all the secret trips you’ve been taking to on-call rooms! There’s no way they’re talking about me!”
Tony finds himself caught momentarily off balance, and though he knows that it’s a deliberate manoeuvre on Fury’s part, feels his hackles rise.
“Can I talk to you for a moment?” Steve asks, and Tony checks his watch, hoping that if he appears short of time, Steve might change his mind.
For years, since he woke up in an unknown future with nothing and no one, Steve has been trying so hard to avoid bleeding on people. He keeps everything in, bottles it up and locks it away. But now it’s coming out in a torrent, and it might just drown all of them.
Steve flicks the case open to pick up the space stone, then swaps it with the tesseract still in the safe. With a deep breath, he hands it to Tony, who is ready and waiting with a gauntlet covering his bare skin. Steve closes Tony’s fingers over the cube with a heavy heart.
“How many people have I dated in the time that you’ve known me?” Steve asks, and Tony can only blink in response.
“You’re on the brink of a decision that is not yours to make. You shouldn’t do this, Captain,” the Ancient One tells him, as she gratefully takes the time stone from him.
“Steve, I think you’re having a panic attack, I need you to breathe with me. Whatever it is, we can work through it, just breathe,” Tony says, scooting over to Steve’s side and laying a hand against Steve’s chest, telegraphing the movement as he does it, and Steve, he crumples, folding forward, sobs he can’t hold in anymore, ones he’d felt building, desperate to come out when he’d seen Tony’s body lying unresponsive on the earth, cracking through his chest.
It isn’t that he dislikes his mother, he just doesn’t know how to talk to her most of the time. When he was growing up Maria Stark wasn’t exactly the maternal type. Sometimes he thinks that the only reason she had a kid in the first place was because Howard wanted to be sure there’d be someone around to carry on his legacy. Quite the family man, his father. That isn’t to say that Maria was a bad mother, but Tony always felt like there was somewhere else she’d rather be, that he and Howard were tying her down, and a sense of duty was all that was keeping her there. Sometimes Tony thinks that him getting a life of his own and Howard getting Alzheimer’s might have been the best things to ever happen to her.
He hasn’t slept much since the battle and succumbs to his exhaustion as soon as his head hits the pillow, but as much as he runs from that day in his waking hours, it’s much harder to escape the memories in sleep.
“Okay, so you know I’m not great at the whole relationship thing either,” he says, even as he’s preaching to the choir. “I mean, this is already the longest relationship I’ve been in since…well, ever, and it’s hardly what you’d call a relationship…”
Taking a moment, Steve looks up into the depths of what is still Stark Tower and lets himself breathe. Hopefully JARVIS is still disabled—Tony had worried about the AI’s response at seeing two versions of them in the tower—because Steve isn’t sure he wants anyone to know what he’s about to do. He doesn’t know how he’d explain it if they did.
It takes all of a few seconds for Tony to get from what was Coulson’s room to the closest on-call room. He barges in, slamming the door behind him and feels the adrenaline rush out of his body. The result leaves him dropping back against the hard surface and sinking to the floor, knees pulled up to his chest.
“You sure about this, Stark?” Natasha asks with what is definitely amusement playing around her lips.
It was only a year after Tony had started working at Shield and he’d gone into a young cardiac patient’s room to find a man in there already. Young and blonde, wearing a ridiculous mask with a quiver of arrows strapped to his back and a bow clutched in his hand, he was regaling the little boy with tales of his work as government spy, and the kid was enraptured, eyes wide as Clint bounced around the room.
Instead, he stands in an operating room day after day, armed with a drill and a scalpel and the thought that he could make a difference.
The paediatrician obviously sees right through Tony’s attempt at subterfuge but goes along with it anyway, “I’ve got this patient, 15-year-old girl, came in today, keeps having seizures. Apparently had one right in the middle of a performance—she plays trumpet in her school’s marching band” he clarifies at their questioning looks. “Trying to diagnose her now so if you have any ideas off the top of your head…”
Steve throws his elbow and hears the faint hiss of air leaving Thor’s chest but the pressure doesn’t abate.
Keen observer that he is—and there have been instances where Tony’s considered the possibility that Clint may actually have once been a spy—Clint must notice Tony's uncertainty. He lists sideways again, this time keeping his weight pressed against Tony’s shoulder. Tony feels the stress start to bleed out of him.
His body is churning with the sick realisation that he's just killed a man, a nice guy who’d fallen victim to Tony’s ego and inability to stand up to Nick Fury. The worst part is that, despite his burgeoning guilt and rage, he can’t help but notice how adorably sleep-rumpled Steve looks.
“Then you must allow them the dignity of that choice,” and suddenly Steve is no longer speaking to a dead queen in an alien world, but sitting in the bombed out remains of the Whip & Fiddle in a devastated corner of London, trying desperately to get drunk, and Peggy is telling him to
“Oh God, I can’t wait to get this inside me next time,” Tony says, and between that, and the skilled twist of Tony’s hand, Steve shudders through his release and Tony follows.
Pain sparks throughout Tony’s hand, the ache shooting through the limb to leave his whole arm tingling. He needs a distraction. “Why’d you change your mind?” he croaks.
“I really should keep going,” but he’s sensing his odds of escape dwindling in the face of a woman who he imagines tends to get what she wants.
The compound is being rebuilt. “Tony would’ve wanted you to have your home back,” Pepper tells him as she signs off on the construction, her hand shaking with the faintest tremor when she says his name.
Before he knows it he’s crossed the space between them and has pulled Tony into his arms. Tony, obviously not expecting the sudden physical affection that had never been a part of their relationship, stiffens, and Steve is caught off guard by the hands that he’d lifted in—what? Fear? And that makes Steve drop his arms, ready to lurch back because this had been a mistake and
, and Steve wishes he’d never been so stupid, because now he has the memory of Tony’s mouth against his, and he doesn’t know how he’ll go on knowing this is it, this was his one shot and he ruined it.
Even after the disaster of the Accords, when he and Tony hadn’t been on speaking terms, Steve had somehow reassured himself with the knowledge that Tony was only a phone call away; whether Tony would have spoken to him or not seemed so much less important than the knowledge that he was still out there, breathing, whole.
Some days when he closes his eyes he sees Tony as he was when he returned from Titan, all jagged edges, beaten and broken because Steve had failed him.
There’s an interminable moment where time seems to freeze and everything else fades into the background, leaving Steve aware of nothing but the light scratch of Tony’s facial hair against his face, the dryness of both their lips, the wide-eyed surprise in Tony’s eyes, the stutter of Tony’s breath in his chest where it’s pressed against Steve’s where his own heart feels like it’s about to burst clean out of his ribs. The awareness that Tony isn’t kissing him back has him clenching his eyes shut in mortification and pulling away, ready to apologise, to beg forgiveness when, for a second time, Tony grasps onto him, hands slipping onto the back of Steve’s neck and fingers threading into the hair there.
When he sticks his head into Fury’s office he’s surprised to find the chief there—surely he should be off terrorising some poor unsuspecting intern somewhere in the hospital…or just at home. He tells Fury as much and receives an unimpressed scowl for his troubles.
“He isn’t with Pepper. Don’t make my mistakes,” Steve takes a deep breath in. “And keep him safe,” and then he isn’t there anymore.
“Peggy?” Steve is definitely surprised by the suggestion. “Peggy and I realised that we were better off as friends even before you and I ever started this…thing. Is that what you were worried about?” Tony will never admit to breathing a little sigh of relief in response, but it’s possible that Steve sees it anyway. “I was always ready, Tony.” He fixes his gaze back on Tony, who can’t help but think that maybe he’s still a little uncertain. “I just wasn’t sure you were. Or that you wanted that…more…with me.”
He stops by the attending’s lounge on the way to his patient’s room and finds Thor, Clint and Natasha sitting at the table and snacking.
The sky overhead is a blend of purples and blues, trapped in perpetual dusk. Not a single structure – man-made or otherwise, stands in obstruction to the vast, barren landscape. It’s almost peaceful in its tranquility.
The patient is lying in bed, conversing quietly with his sister, who is seated in the chair by the bed. Phil Coulson is pale against the dark navy bedclothes that are standard on this floor of the hospital. The dark bruises under his eyes and his thinning hair combine to make him appear much older than he is. His hands repeatedly clench and release the blanket covering his legs.
And Steve, he knows that voice, has heard it repeated over and over in his head as the years have gone by, taunting, “
Steve turns and walks away, not letting himself look back at Tony holding his destruction in the palm of his hand. As he walks by his younger self, Steve puts a firm hand on his shoulder.
With his lab coat, salt and pepper hair and glasses, Tony has always thought of Bruce as the most visually suited to this profession of theirs.
And because the universe loves him—before Tony can even give voice to the indignant reply sitting on the tip of his tongue—the door to the lounge opens and Steve walks in.
The first time Steve looks over his shoulder for no discernible reason is when the battle is won and the dust of Thanos’ army has settled. Somebody, and Steve isn’t even sure who, asks, “Now what?” and Steve looks over his shoulder. His search gives way to confusion because there isn’t anybody there, but he soldiers on. “We rebuild,” he answers.
“Don’t be a fool. There is no returning from a death caused by the stones.” Steve shoots him an unimpressed look. “A real death. I was merely transported. Your friends, they have been taken. This power is not for mortal men. It extracts a price.”
“Screw his rules!” He growls in frustration, kicking the wall with the heel of his foot, “Screw his stupid pride! We have to tell people, I’m sure he doesn’t want to die in that place when he could have been saved.” The sob he hears this time is louder. “Stop crying!” He snaps, then immediately feels guilty. It isn’t his mother’s fault, she’s as much of a victim of Howard’s ego as he is. He flicks a glance at his watch and starts at the time.
“Steve,” Tony says, nudging Steve’s considerable form aside and stepping towards Fury. Tony may be having a shit day but that doesn’t mean he needs anyone to fight his battles for him. Steve moves aside without argument, but Tony can see him in his peripheral vision, watching them closely. “It was my fault, Fury,” Tony offers and Steve makes an unhappy sound in his throat. Tony shoots him a look, both eyebrows raised, that he hopes says ‘will you let me finish?’
The decision is an easy one to make because Steve has felt adrift since the battle, the links in the chain anchoring him stretched thin, cracking. He thinks that maybe this will give him a goal, something he can accomplish, instead of standing back, powerless, while...Steve exhales a deep breath, “I’m sure.”
“There’s a 50/50 chance that if we stuck this out, one day I’ll look at you and not even know who you are,” Tony says, uncertain of where the conversation took a turn from talking about a hypothetical person to Steve himself. He doesn’t dwell, better to get to the point faster. “And I don’t want to do that to you. But you know what? I’m selfish. That’s what I am, I’m selfish and narcissistic and I’m so
Tony drums his fingers against his knee for a moment, wondering how to start. “I love this hospital,” he announces, apropos of nothing.
“What will you do now?” Tony asks, eyes flicking back to the case of stones Steve still has to deliver, but Steve doesn’t think that’s what Tony’s really asking.
The moment is broken by Steve. Steve, with his gentle hands and soft words and his tendency to take on everyone else’s problems as though his own aren’t heavy enough; those strong shoulders of his braced against the world.
“Then what do you want?” Steve asks, looking into eyes that are and are not his own. He remembers waking up, having just experienced loss worse than most people will ever live through in their lifetimes, but it isn’t over yet.
“Yes, sir, Captain, sir,” Tony performs what he’s sure is a sloppy approximation of a salute, and pretends to zip his lips in response to Steve’s unimpressed (yet amused, Tony notes gleefully) glare.
A pained groan sounds from somewhere near Steve’s feet and he looks down to find the younger man waking. His eyes widen when he sees Steve, and he rolls away, springing to his feet.
“Come on, Steve. Wouldn’t want my broken hand to fall off, what with all the money it rakes in for the hospital.” He grabs Steve’s hand and pulls him further along down the hall. He watches Fury’s one eye flick towards his injured hand as they pass, and he must decide that Tony has a point, despite the exaggeration, because he lets them go without comment.
“Something tells me you know more about what will happen than I do,” her eyes are bright and there’s a small smile on her face, and Steve feels his face flame.
Shit, if anyone could pull this off, it’d be him. He wasn’t exaggerating when he told Fury that he was the best. It was simple statement of fact. Most of the neurosurgeons he knows wouldn’t even go near a case like this. With good reason too.
But Steve doesn’t have time to deal with this now, he looks over and Howard is looking the other way for the moment, but he won’t be for long. He uses the grasp he has on Tony’s hips, lifting him and spinning them both around the corner so they’re hidden behind the safe the cube is still sitting in, and Steve hopes Howard doesn’t notice that the door is ajar, the faint blue glow of the tesseract bleeding into the room.
The cushions are soft under his body, despite the cramped space they’re sharing. He briefly considers the merits of moving to an on-call room, but even the closest one seems so far away, and Steve is right there, soft and sleepy. It’s a no-brainer, really, so he wraps his arm around Steve’s back, slipping his hand under the neckline of his shirt to rest against smooth skin. Steve shifts to press a kiss to the skin under Tony’s jaw and he feels a smile slip onto his face.
“Tony, we’re ready to go over here. It’s time to put him under now,” Natasha tells him, voice surprisingly soft. He looks over to find her watching him. He’s trying to decipher the expression when she reaches over and clasps his uninjured wrist, giving it a light squeeze.
“Wait, wait, it’s okay,” Tony says, arm outstretched like Steve is a wounded animal he’s trying to calm. There’s something ridiculous about the image too, They must look quite the pair right now, clothes rumpled with their pants open and come staining their clothes, and Steve can feel the certainty that this is the last time he’ll ever see Tony washing over him, and it’s terrifying.
Rounding the corner, Steve hears “back in the game!” and promptly walks into an office chair. He flinches, and Tony turns to him, eyes widening.
She looks at him, expression cryptic, and he can’t seem to read her at all before she comes to a decision. “Very well, but remember, time is a tricky thing. I hope your goal is as straightforward as you think it is. Sometimes things are meant to happen the way they do.”
“Only one stop left on the tour,” Tony says, gesturing to the mind and time stones still sitting in the case. Steve nods.
Apparently he’s only informing Tony as a formality because he hooks an arm around Tony’s waist and settles back into the couch, pulling Tony down with him and rearranging them into a more comfortable position as he goes. His body is heavy and relaxed, his head tucked into Tony’s neck and Tony can feel his own muscles loosening in response.
Tony has always taken up so much space, the air seeming to warp around him, pulling people into his orbit. Steve had always fought the instinctive pull, trying to protect himself from the gravity of Tony Stark, because something about it told him that if he let himself get pulled in, he’d never escape again.
“Sometimes I wonder where the line is, you know? What makes us any better than murderers?” His fingers tighten in the cloth and feels Steve’s grip mirror his. Tony wonders if he were to let go, stop holding himself up, whether Steve would catch him.
“It’s been eleven years,” he huffs, shifting his head to press his lips to the palm of Tony’s hand. Tony’s expression turns soft, and desperately sad. “Don’t you think it’s time we finally stopped lying to each other?”
, he thinks, checking the surgery time against that on the giant clock above the board. The numbers written beside the procedure list their start time as two hours earlier which means that Tony’s stuck waiting for anything from one to four hours and how the hell is he supposed to wait that long? He slumps back against the wall.
“Don’t think there’s such thing, Tony,” Steve says, crowding Tony even closer against the wall, pushing his thigh between his legs to brace him there while Steve’s hands grow bolder, undoing Tony’s slacks and slipping beneath the waistband over the warm skin of his ass. In response, Tony’s hips thrust forward, grinding against Steve’s thigh with a groan. Steve can’t help himself, and leans back in to kiss Tony hungrily, aware of an insistent tug against his waistband, fingers undoing the button and pulling down the fly to—“Shit,” he gasps into Tony’s mouth as a hand,
Steve is so focused on paying attention to Howard and the sound of his footsteps coming closer that it takes him a moment to realise that, in his attempt to shield Tony with his body—even though Steve’s the one who needs to avoid being seen and recognised—he’s pushed Tony tight against the wall, and he can feel the length of their bodies pressed together.
“You gonna stand there all day, Stark, or you gonna help make sure this kid can walk?” Natasha barks, tendrils of red hair escaping her scrub cap, which appears to be covered in—spiders? That’s it. Tony is officially giving up on trying to understand the woman.
“I’m sorry I ever made you think I didn’t trust you, Tony. It was never about that. And I do trust you. I trust you with my life.” Steve is breathing the words into the shoulder of Tony’s borrowed lab coat, and he knows this is too much, that there’s no way Tony won’t mention this to the other Steve and this is going to be impossible, and Steve has made a mistake but he just
He only manages to wait five minutes—Tony suspects it must be a personal best—before he cuts a sideways glance at Tony, “so, who are we waiting for?”
“My bad!” Tony calls after her, not entirely sure whether he means it or not. She doesn’t look back.
Steve reaches forward, his hands cupping Tony’s elbows in silent support. Tony refuses to look at his face.
“Please,” Clint scoffs, waving away Tony’s words, “like your opinion on the matter would count for anything,” he rolls his eyes, head tilted back against the wall, and Tony sputters, outraged.
“Nothing, Tony,” Steve says, his hand twitching in an aborted movement towards Tony. “He’s not going to do a damn thing because he’s ordering you to do it. It’s on his head, not yours.”
The others are about to clear the room and the last thing Tony needs is to give Steve the opportunity to get all judgemental about his approach to the surgery. He looks at the clock over the door, desperate for an escape. “Hey, wait up, you two,” he says, dropping his legs back to the floor and heading to his locker for his scrub cap. He picks his favourite, the one covered in little robots that Pepper once bought him as a joke after he told her about how he almost went to MIT to study engineering. It’s become a sort of good luck charm and to be honest, he could really use some extra luck today.
“Come on, my hand’s fine,” he lifts it up into their eyesight and has a split second to consider the intelligence of his decision before he’s stretching his fingers to straighten it out.
Something seems to shift in Fury’s expression. “Now here’s a day I never thought I’d see, going to have to mark it in my calendar,” he says, tone calculated, mocking. “The great Tony Stark admitting defeat.”
in Siberia. “Oh, God, Tony, I’m so sorry,” he manages to stutter out when he feels hands grasping at his uniform.
“Except when the situation involves Steve, and your brain flies out the window, leaving a pining, love-struck teenager in its wake,” Clint says, pulling his scrub cap off and running a hand through his hair, leaving it standing up in spikes. Tony won’t admit that the words hit a bit too close to home.
“Steve, I don’t think you should,” Tony says, but Steve brushes him off, because he won’t let Tony do this alone. Maybe together they can find another way.
“This is what you want, isn’t it?” Steve asks, holding the soul stone. “If I return it, do I get Nat back?”
The problem with Steve is that Tony has never quite been able to work out where he stands with him. The two had met when Steve had transferred to Shield from an obscure, little hospital in the middle of Bumfuck, Nowhere. The rumours had started up shortly beforehand; about Dr Erskine’s golden boy, the unknown kid who’d taken his hospital’s teaching programme by storm, shooting through his internship and residency with flying colours before he enlisted and went off to treat soldiers in a war zone. Almost the second he got back he returned to his previous employers who immediately offered him the job of attending cardio surgeon and fuck but that never happens. A few years of establishing himself as a veritable cardio god and picking up every award in the medical community followed, before he made the move to New York and Shield where he spent months clashing with the local head of Neuro.
As he slips out of the room, he comes face to face with an elegant blonde woman with kind eyes and a regal bearing. Steve braces for the possibility that he may have to make a run for it, but—
“Someone get me some gloves and a surgical mask,” he demands. Only then does Natasha notice the cast that reaches half way up his forearm.
With the change of angle, Steve’s aware of the insistent press of Tony’s cock where it’s trapped between their bodies, and before he’s caught his breath, Tony’s hands are deftly pulling Steve’s shirt out from where it’s tucked into his pants, undoing a few buttons, only to be met with the white undershirt Steve has on. “God, why are you wearing so many layers?” Tony asks, pushing until his hands are splayed across Steve’s abs, which twitch at the sudden shock. All Steve wants is to push all of Tony’s clothes out of the way, get his hands on as much skin as he can, but there simply isn’t the time.
It’s almost an hour into Tony’s wait that Clint finds him. His only response is to raise an eyebrow at Tony’s position on the floor before settling down beside him.
Tony stands frozen, his body shaking with rage and a roaring in his ears. Then, for a moment, one shining moment, he wonders if he could do it: just walk out the door and never have to deal with Fury and his thoughtless manipulations, or look at his stupid fucking eyepatch ever again.
because he’s holding on to Tony and Tony is holding him back and he’s so alive. Steve is on the verge of something that might be a breakdown, but there’s no way he could ever explain that to Tony if he starts sobbing all over him, but there’s something else that’s building inside his chest, something terrifying, and Steve doesn’t know if he’s going to be able to hold it back as his body shakes in Tony’s arms.
“Howard—my, er—my dad. He’s sick,” Fury straightens and tips forward towards Tony, who puts his hands up to stall the oncoming questions. “It’s early onset Alzheimer’s. He’s in a care facility,” Tony says, forcing himself to maintain eye contact with Fury. He remembers the first time they met, how he’d opened the conversation with ‘so do I look at the patch or the eye?’ To this day, he’s never quite figured it out.
But maybe it doesn’t matter. This is hardly the way that he wants to earn his father’s approval anyway.
He tells himself that he doesn’t care that Steve looks hurt by his words. What right does he have to feel hurt when he doubts Tony’s judgement?
He doesn’t let anyone see it, the fear he feels when he sees the legendary Howard Stark reduced to this. This old man with the messy hair and frightened eyes, asking ‘where am I? What am I doing here? Who are you?’
Steve doesn’t second guess himself as his hands, still on Tony’s hips, slip further around his back, and skirt down the swell of Tony’s ass and lift, pushing him back into the wall. The faint sound of surprise Tony makes into Steve’s mouth turns to a moan and when Tony wraps his legs around Steve, his answering groan reverberates back into Tony’s.
