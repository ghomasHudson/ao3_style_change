“I think I’ll let you go now.” He said reluctantly. “What time will you be home tomorrow?”
“It’s different; you don’t know my family.” John’s gaze softened but it didn’t leave his phone and the lack of eye contact was grating against Sherlock’s nerves. He reached out and gripped John’s chin with one slender hand, turning it to face him and holding it there firmly until John’s eyes connected with his.
As the server grabbed John’s plate as well as the bill the front door chimed and John immediately stiffened, eyes fixed on a point behind Sherlock. The professor noticed the change in John’s demeanor immediately from the rapid melt of John’s soft smile into a worried frown to the flex in his arms as he clenched his hands into fists beneath the table.
Sherlock was not one to hold anyone’s hand. When the student began to run through his list of excuses Sherlock tuned him out directly and walked the rest of the way to his car planning a very extensive research assignment to spring on the class last minute as punishment. If Sherlock had to listen to this load of shite the man would pay for it with the wrath of his classmates as well.
“Hello?”
“Sherlock, it’s John.” Sherlock blinked into the dark room. He pulled the phone from his ear and checked the time.
A good hour had passed in silence as John sipped at Sherlock’s tea and cuddled his cats, Sherlock trying to deduce what had happened without staring too obviously, before John spoke. Without looking away from the empty space on the wall he had been staring at, John took a deep breath and then slowly let it out.
Sherlock shook his head.
“Then don’t pay rent. I’ve been paying it just fine since I moved in.” John laughed bitterly.
A nearly imperceptible snore passed the student’s lips and Sherlock smirked. Now that the man was asleep Sherlock turned away from the program, that had only had a quarter of his attention in the first place, and focused on the John sleeping in front of him. The professor carefully mapped and catalogued every inch of the student’s body that he could see from his corner of the sofa. The professor had managed to get through every sign of obvious neglect and abuse as well as a few low confidence indicators when he realized that he was spending an inordinate amount of time looking at the other man’s lips.
Thankfully the cafe was just tapering off from the lunch rush when John and Sherlock walked in. It was just busy enough not to be uncomfortably quiet and not so busy that the tables went unwashed between customers.
The detective barely glanced at John from his sprawled out position in the sitting room, yet John could feel the man deducing him silently; figuring out how the other man had slept without the small talk, the inane chatter of more common folk. The daily silent assessment was nearly unbearable, draining whatever energy the nightmares had spared the night before. It brought into clear focus the awkward silence in 221B that hadn’t been there before. John placed the kettle on the stove and fell heavily into one of the dining room chairs. As the water boiled, John’s eyes unfocused and brought him back into his dreams.
Sherlock wasn’t sure which of them let out the gasp of a moan when Sherlock’s fingers slipped from John’s guiding hands, finding their way past the band of John’s jeans and smoothing down the thin fabric of his briefs. Their lips parted as Sherlock’s grip tightened and John’s hips bucked against Sherlock’s lap. There was the hint of something dangerous in Sherlock’s eyes as they met John’s dilated pupils. The professor could feel John’s pulse racing as his lips met the skin of John’s neck, as his teeth sank into the skin just hard enough to bruise. His hands released the perky flesh of John’s arse to run down the outside of John’s thighs and then back up the front.
The bandages coiled around her wrists were very pointedly ignored in sight and conversation. Mummy wasn’t feeling well, but she would be fine, there was nothing to discuss. If Sherlock opened his mouth his mother would wake, simply to talk above him. If Mycroft glanced at the linen bracelets covering a good part of her forearms she would tsk and carry on about the dangers of cooking or rock climbing. She would ask about their jobs, the weather, the political climate in Asia. Their mother was alright and neither son should be worried.
“I’m not letting you pay for me.” John pouted. Sherlock only smirked, waving the bill a bit from his side of the table.
“I live in his house, I don’t pay rent or food, he practically raised me on his own. He’s right, he deserves more from me.” Sherlock finally looked over at John and frowned.
“You should have been there.”
Lunch was just as silent as the car ride earlier and Sherlock spent the rest of the day at his mother’s side as she wandered the grounds restlessly. Mr. Holmes did not appear for lunch and neglected to show up for dinner, having both brought up to his office. It was almost like the man was actively avoiding his wife and sons, though Sherlock suspected the man’s pride would never actually allow him to do such a thing. Children avoided those they had problems with; adults faced them head on and used every opportunity to look them in the eyes.
“It’s normal to sleep at odd times during the day when you’ve spent the entire night studying.” Sherlock shrugged dismissively.
“The nurse who came in twice now since you’ve arrived is your lover. She barely glanced at the chart when she came in and her eyes were unfocused when she talked to my mum. She was paying too much attention to her peripheral vision. You’ve been spending more time on your appearance of late, an unusual amount of time, and the perfume your mistress wears is one that lingers long after it’s been sprayed. She is not allowed to wear anything more than deodorant in the hospital due to the risk of aggravating allergies or weak senses of patients and yet I still caught a faint whiff of it as she passed my chair.
At first, Sherlock assumes that Mrs. Hudson must have been cleaning the flat while he was gone. Surely the old woman had seen John’s miserable state and decided that she needed to help him out around the house. The woman may have vehemently denied being their maid but she brought up enough treats and gave enough advice to confuse herself for their mum. But, when Sherlock turned to his bed he noticed something he hadn’t since he had returned.
Despite the loudly fleeing cat and the ball of black fur trying to stealthily reach the sandwich Sherlock had placed on the coffee table Sherlock’s attention was captured entirely by the man sitting opposite him. It was strange, this feeling he had around John. No one else had ever held Sherlock’s interest for more than a moment or two. The only reason he and Lestrade were as close as they were, was due to the other professor’s complete lack of shame. Lestrade had spent a solid year hounding Sherlock with questions about lectures, test and quizzes, emails from the school, and invites to lunch and drinks when he was first brought on as a professor. But, this man, who had not even completed his Doctorate, had only to appear at Sherlock’s door and the professor was hooked.
John’s eyes flew wide open, every muscle tensing as his hand flexed into a fist beneath his head and a breath rushed into his lungs. The tabby at his back jumped up and looked around bewildered before jumping down to the floor. The black ball of fur at the man’s chest looked up sleepily, bristling a bit before settling back contentedly at the sight of Sherlock. Sherlock took his hand back, head cocking to the side quizzically.
“Wait here, I’ll grab a towel.” John hesitated before following Sherlock into the entryway. As the professor set Marlowe down on the sofa and disappeared into the back hallway he saw Allan jump down from his perch and prance over to purr against John’s legs. When he returned, towel in hand, John was sitting crisscross on the floor. The med student’s face was buried in Allan’s fur as the kitten nuzzled and rubbed it’s face against the side of John’s head. Marlowe glared accusingly at Sherlock from the arm of the sofa.
“We’re not-” John spluttered at the closed door. Sherlock bit the inside of his cheek to keep from grinning and strode past the med student to the lift.
The way your eyes gravitated towards not-quite polite parts of her anatomy indicates you haven’t been intimate as much as usual either; it must be hard finding the time for a proper shag what with conflicting schedules and exhaustingly long hours at work and it must be frustrating that your wife no longer wants to give it up either. The only reason your wife would withhold sex is that she knows, she has to have smelled the perfume on your clothes and with the amount of make up your lover wears she is sure to have left some smudged on your clothing at some point.”
“Studying for an exam.” Sherlock opened his eyes, let his gaze settle somewhere near the floor. Every muscle in his body was tight, he felt the need to escape but he wasn’t sure from what or to where. He tried to picture John, sitting on the sofa back at his flat with Marlowe, highlighting passages in a thick textbook, writing down small thoughts in the margins.
Eliot gaped up at Sherlock and then looked back to where his grandfather stood by the seats. Sherlock let the kid have the window seat and spent the entire flight answering questions about his last-minute lecture and the University he taught at back home. By the time they landed Eliot didn’t even seem to be remotely related to the kid Sherlock was introduced to at the beginning. Getting him to stop talking long enough to answer the questions was nearly impossible.
Sherlock heard Allan before he saw him. As soon as the professor had put his key in the lock he had heard a loud meow from within the flat. Small claws had just set to an attempt to ruin the bottom of the front door when Sherlock pulled it out of the cat’s reach. The small black kitten fell back to all fours and then meowed happily as he latched himself onto Sherlock’s pant leg instead.
“I assure you, she will be well looked after. My father has an office at home and they have a maid that lives with them.” The doctor’s frown deepened and Mycroft’s forced smile tightened.
“I had to pick the bugger up. It was either that or get knocked on my arse every time I tried to move.” Sherlock chuckled.
“Are you leaving already?” Mycroft asked, his own gaze holding nothing but judgement and a near-complete lack of interest.
“Welcome home.” Sherlock looked up at the second greeting he received to find John smiling at him from the kitchen, holding a purring Marlowe in one arm. His hip was cocked to the side to support the added weight and he was definitely wearing the shirt and joggers Sherlock had let him borrow before. Golden skin peeked from just beneath the shirt where it rode up on the side Marlowe was being held, John’s hair stuck out in all directions, and some sleep was still lingering in the corners of John’s eyes. It was all the professor could do not to drop his bag and maul the med student before he’d even properly entered the flat.
“Hey! Bugger off.” Sherlock scolded Allan quietly, snatching his sandwich and taking a large bite. The cat meowed pitifully and rolled over onto his back in feigned innocence. Sherlock merely rolled his eyes and opened his laptop again, scrolling back to the place he had left off. When John returned, in the now dry clothes he had arrived in, he merely plopped down on the sofa beside Sherlock and leaned back, closing his eyes.
The trill of his phone brought his attention back to the discarded device. With a slight huff of annoyance Sherlock picked up the phone and answered without checking the caller id. His face fell as the voice of his brother drifted through the phone. As soon as they hung up he was crafting an email to John as well as a separate one from his university email announcing lectures would be cancelled tomorrow.
Doctor Sherlock Holmes stared at his laptop, mouth twisted into a frown and brow deeply furrowed. With a dramatic huff, he pushed his chair back from the desk and stormed from his office down the short hallway to Doctor Gregory Lestrade’s office. Sherlock began cursing the very cells that made-up Anderson’s person even before the door to Greg’s office had opened wide enough to see inside. The way in which the door swung wide to reveal an empty room cluttered with papers and books of all ages and lengths was nearly smug.
After a second of hesitation Sherlock tentatively clicked the notification. A short paragraph appeared on the screen, neatly formatted like a proper letter, letting him know that John Watson had arrived at his flat and had found the key beneath the mat. Blinking at the message Sherlock tried to decide if it was odd that John had sent him an email simply to tell him he had arrived at Sherlock’s house.
“It’s not normal, you know.” The med student sighed heavily, his shoulders slouching further inward. “You’re a proper adult now; he shouldn’t have that much control over your life.” John shook his head slightly before Sherlock had even stopped talking.
“Please, what?” Sherlock’s voice was nearly a growl, almost unrecognizable to himself. John moaned and within moments the pair were stumbling their way out of their clothing and into Sherlock’s bed. They filled the room with the whisper of skin against skin and fumbling hands, the gasping of breath and the whispered names of two men discovering one another and growing closer than either thought possible. They twisted together as the moon crossed the sky and slept in each other’s arms as the sun regained its territory. When they had both awoken John stood in the kitchen with his phone, watching the screen light up with several missed calls. Sherlock crossed the linoleum to wrap his arms around the blonde man’s waist.
-~-~-~-~-~-///-///-~-~-~-~-~-
.” Sherlock ignored the man, focusing instead on John’s face as he was pulled from the cafe and out onto the street. He watched the blonde until he was out of sight and then Sherlock slumped back into his chair and sighed.
“Really now, must you pick a fight with every person you meet?” Sherlock yanked his arm from his brother’s grasp and gave his best pout. The electric overhead lights seemed brighter than the sun shining through the wide windows; amplified by the polished steel and tile covering the entirety of the private waiting room. There was not a hint of color, as if even a glimpse of blue or green would breed disease and mayhem like a cracked petri dish. The magazines on the side tables boasted trendy new diets and tips on how to gain muscle quickly through simple workouts. A single plant, some muted dark green color, seemed to wilt in the corner beside the door.
No one is real. Sherlock read through the very paragraphs of his reply, edited a few typos, and hit send. When it comes down to it the connections we see between ourselves and the people around us is only further proof that it has all come from us. Ten minutes passed and the screen lit up.
“Oh, it was an easy conclusion. Your grandfather picked the smartest dressed, least threatening, male sitting at the gate and then held a conversation with me. His body language gained confidence as we talked and you grew more relaxed as we talked. This is obviously only your second or third time flying, you were both nervous, and your grandfather wanted to be sure someone on the plane would feel obligated to stand up for you or make sure you got to safety if something were to happen between here and Ireland.”
“Mr. Holmes, breakfast is ready downstairs.” A voice muffled by thick wood and well insulated walls called out.
“Well, I’m not going to just send you back home without letting you eat something. There’s a cafe around the corner?” At that John looked up and blinked at the professor. The mold was of little importance outside of Sherlock’s experiments and therefore needed no more explaining. It didn’t hit Sherlock that John’s odd look might be due to his offer to take John to a cafe for lunch until a few moments later. Sherlock shut his laptop a bit more forcefully than he intended and stood up, quickly moving to the front door. “Alright then, come on.” He said, avoiding John’s questioning gaze.
“A doctor? I knew you looked like a sharp fellow. Are you going to Ireland on business, then?” Henry settled into the chair across from Sherlock as Eliot hesitated and then sat beside him.
The experiment beneath the floorboards in the corner is, unexpectedly, thriving in the dark conditions despite Sherlock’s nonexistent attention. It had been a possibility, but a highly unlikely one.
Confusingly, the shelves have all been dusted, and recently at that.
“Did you eat anything when you made me a sandwich?” John shook his head without opening his eyes.
the caller ID informed.
“Somehow, I don’t think that would help.” John replied bitterly shaking his head.
“I can sleep on the couch; I rarely ever make it to the bed anyways.” John blinked at him and then laughed. His cheeks flushed and he looked away, mouth working a bit before he finally spoke.
“Oh, I do?” Sherlock drawled, rolling his eyes. “What are you going to do if I don’t? Sit on me?” Now it was Sherlock’s turn to flush. As soon as the words left his lips an image of John pushing Sherlock’s chair back and straddling his hips flooded his inner mind and he nearly choked. Sherlock quickly took a sip from his tea, using the cup to hide his expression.
“Ah, Sherlock, welcome back. Where is your mother and Mycroft?” Unlike his son, Mr. Holmes had no problems with letting the grey in his hair remain visible. He wore the wear and tear of his age like a badge of honor. It was another sign of proof that he was wiser, more capable, and more knowledgeable about anything of consequence than those around him. The desk he sat at was immaculately clean, nothing but a stray pen and a thick stack of papers marring the surface. Everything else was placed neatly off to the side in an organizer or holder. The monitor at one corner was thin and sleek, taking up as little space as possible. Sherlock was not surprised in the least to see his father in a dress shirt and suit pants though he would not have left the house all day.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said, picking up the tea without a second glance at the sandwich. John hummed in acknowledgement and as the two men ate in silence Sherlock felt that companionable warmth in the air that held so tenuously between his brother and mum earlier at breakfast. The professor glanced over at John, at the way he stared off into the distance, lost in his own thoughts. The crease in his brow and the upcoming University exams made the subject of John’s thoughts transparently clear. “Do you have any plans for what’s left of today?” Sherlock asked, startling John a bit. The student flushed as his eyes focused back on Sherlock’s.
“I don’t live here any longer. You don’t own me or my mother and you’ve never had a hope of owning Mycroft.” Sherlock growled. Mr. Holmes’ eyes narrowed.
“I wanted to, but Moriarty’s network would have known.” Sherlock’s grip on John tightened just enough to be felt. “Mycroft and I had to make it believable so that Moriarty would let you live. I did it for you, John. I’m not going to apologize for protecting you.” Distress coated the man’s words and John realized with some inactive part of his brain that Sherlock was shaking slightly. He took a deep breath as if steeling himself and then whispered. “I am sorry for the way in which I had to do it. I’m sorry that it took so long to come back to you. But I would do it again if it meant keeping you safe.” Each syllable was like silk, tentatively attempting to smooth over the rough, jagged edges that made up John’s battered heart.
“I’m not some sort of
“See you tomorrow, Sherlock.”
“But how can I be sure of that when you won’t let me see her! You’ve had her for hours now. Surely if you were any good at your job she’d be able to have at least
“Molly… She gave me your scarf. I was almost jealous that it was a decision she had the ability to make.” John gave a self-deprecating laugh and lifted his head barely an inch to bang it against the window. “You never truly realize what a ridiculous idiot you are until you feel possessive over a damn scarf.”
“Why didn’t you tell me?” John’s fists tightened around twin handfuls of Sherlock’s shirt. His voice cracked and strained around the few syllables which were so thoroughly twisted and muffled by the other man’s shirt John doubted he would be heard. The doctor’s knees trembled and, as if Sherlock had developed telepathy in his absence, the detective’s own knees began to fold until they were both kneeling on the floor. Sherlock’s knees moved to frame John’s and he found himself nestled in the other man’s body. He was surrounded by the rich, dark scent of Sherlock and the warmth of his skin. The beat of Sherlock’s heart thumped distantly against the side of John’s face. A thin hand rubbed circles into his back while another carded through his short hair.
” He’d say with his fists planted on his hips. The soldiers would groan at his unfaltering response.
Marlowe was ecstatic to see John again, the tabby had refused to leave his side since he arrived. The med student assured Sherlock that he had not brought catnip that first visit and would not bring it this time either. Apparently, it wasn’t good for cats to have. Sherlock wondered if this was something John had known before meeting Sherlock or if he had searched the information out afterward. Either way it was best not to read too much into things.
“Don’t.” Came John’s strangled gasp. The hurt in Sherlock’s eyes flickered briefly before his mouth began to turn down as if readying for a childish strop. “Don’t kiss me, don’t start this if you are just going to leave me again.” John pulled himself together enough to form the words he wanted to say. “I can’t go through this again, this losing you. Do you have any idea how painful this entire ordeal was for me?” John cursed every crack in these last sentences and at their utterance Sherlock’s face smoothed out of its masked hurt.
“I’m not going to say I didn’t look you up, because I did look through your student files at the university… However, there is no way I could’ve known you live with an abusive father.” Sherlock moved to take a sip of his drink and then thought better of it, placing the bitter tea on the coffee table beside John’s. “I’m not going to tell anyone else, either. Even if I was inclined to tell someone else; I don’t have friends.” Sherlock deadpanned. John gave him an incredulous look.
Marlowe’s purrs emanated through the silence between John and Sherlock. Both men were tensed and holding their cups like shields before them. After a few tense seconds John moved to place his cup on the coffee table. Sherlock flinched, knuckles whitening around his own cup. John paused, catching the reaction out of the corner of his eye just as he set the cup down.
“I’ve said everything I intend to.” Sherlock replied, placing his half-eaten toast back onto the plate and finishing his tea. With a quick kiss to his mother’s cheek and a nod to Mycroft Sherlock stood up from the table and shouldered his bag once more. He turned to face Mr. Holmes face to face.
Two weeks later Sherlock found himself sulking in a leather upholstered chair in the corner of Lestrade’s office. Lestrade had barely looked up from his laptop and the various documents spread across his desk when Sherlock dragged himself into the professor’s office. After a few silent moments of sulking he had sighed loudly to get the doctor’s attention and then recounted everything that had happened between him and John, from the night he had gotten home from the lecture to what had happened in the cafe. Sherlock told Lestrade about the strange daily updates and the pictures attached, about the fact that John had fought with his father before appearing at Sherlock’s flat, and how he was later dragged from the cafe by the man but he skipped past the bruises and the black eye.
A large man with a messy crewcut complained.
“I’m certain I know someone who can take care of that last part and as for a job, I can help you apply.” Sherlock’s eyes widened suddenly. “Actually, Lestrade has been bugging me for a while about hiring a teacher’s aide. You could grade papers for me and handle my emails and the University will be the one signing your checks so you won’t have to worry about being indebted to me or any of that nonsense.”
“Anderson? The secretary?” Sherlock scowled, this time genuinely, his hands fisting a bit unconsciously.
“That isn’t right, there are plenty of decent fathers out there. We just ended up on the wrong side of the fence; our grass is a bit browner than the other patch.” A few more moments of silence passed between the pair, before it was broken by a soft laugh.
A minute passed and then five and Sherlock strode over to his room and knocked on the door. When there was no answer he opened the door to find John crumpled on the floor, face buried in Allan’s fur. Marlowe had jumped from the couch to follow Sherlock and seemed to almost glare at Allan before nuzzling his way between the student’s face and Allan’s stomach. The laugh that broke out of John’s throat was cracked and hollow and Sherlock gently fell to his knees next to the ball of fur.
“Doctor Sherlock Holmes.” Eliot seemed to perk up at Sherlock’s title, suddenly not as interested in the convenience store down the aisle though not yet looking near the two older men.
“John.” The doctor’s body slumped forward, his eyes closing in resignation. Sherlock repeated his name in that low baritone as if it were a silent plea. But for what? Surely the man didn’t see a need for forgiveness. The brilliantly stupid detective never truly understood when he was being a totally unreasonable prat and John had no energy left for this bickering. Looking back, he could pinpoint the exact moment his patience snapped.
“You’re eating this sandwich by the way.” Sherlock rolled his eyes at John’s smirk and sighed.
“He asked me what I thought.” Sherlock shrugged.
“Sherlock, dear?” Sherlock blinked at his mother.
“Doctor Holmes?” Sherlock blinked and then frowned.
John’s knuckles were white against the wood of the sill. His body was strung so tight Sherlock could almost feel the tension beneath his own skin. Before Sherlock could stop himself, he was walking towards John, closing the distance that had spread between them.
“Professor Holmes, there is a student waiting on the sofas downstairs for you. He has been sitting there for an hour now and the stupid way he keeps staring at the front of my sweater is starting to get on my nerves. It’s like he is waiting for it to suddenly become see through, the look of confusion on his face is insufferable, and it is plain rude.” Anderson slapped the papers in their hand onto Lestrade’s desk and then turned on their heel and marched out of the room again. The two professors glanced at each other.
It turns out the remote was merely buried under a few cushions on the sofa. After unearthing the thing Sherlock settled into his corner and John settled into his. Marlowe curled between them and Allan ran off into the bedroom for god knows what reason. Despite the cliffhanger from the previous episode Sherlock somehow caught his eyes continuously wandering back to sneak glances at John.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s your father. You don’t owe him anything for doing what is necessary to keep you alive.”
Things were beginning to get out of hand. Sherlock shut his eyes. It was never a good sign when his thoughts began to talk over one another. Was he trembling or was the bed shaking?
As Sherlock’s hand landed on the door handle he turned on the man coldly, cutting him off and informing him that 1) The questions he had asked in his email were clearly answered in the syllabus 2) Doctor Sherlock Holmes did not take late work and 3) University did
“Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes?” The two brothers nodded in impatient unity. “Right then, Mrs. Holmes is in stable condition for now. If you would like to see her I can let you in now but you must refrain from waking or disturbing her in any way. She needs all the rest she can get.”
“I guess, she and I have something in common then.” He murmured. John turned a confused smile on Sherlock.
sit down; you’re going to make me throw up.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and nearly earned himself a slap from Mycroft’s umbrella when the brothers were interrupted by the return of one of mummy’s doctors. Both men snapped to attention as the doctor looked down at his chart and then back up at the two men.
“For a time, I wasn’t sure I could live a life without you.” The previous silence of the room seemed to take on an extra weight. It was as if someone had deposited the two men in a sound proofed room, so deadly silent Sherlock could hear his heart racing, every breath reflected off the window John took. Every syllable of every word came amplified against the backdrop of these sounds. “It wasn’t just the fact that I… That I missed you. It was the way that everything reminded me of you, of our life together. I went to the hospital and I carried on throughout my shift doing the mundane things I do every day, and when I left I couldn’t go home. I knew that the flat would be empty. I knew that I would be ordering Chinese for one, making one cup of tea, sitting alone in this living room where a madman used to sit and sulk and solve impossible murders.”
“You’re back a bit late, but I’m only just now making lunch. Do you want a sandwich or something?” John nodded to the stove at his side where a kettle was set to boil. “Tea’s on as well.”
“Hullo?” Sherlock watched as John’s shoulders straightened and his posture corrected unconsciously. The tightening of John’s hands gave the caller away almost immediately. “Yes, sir… I’m sorry… Yes…” John’s jaw flexed as he ground his teeth together and Sherlock made the Herculean effort to get off the sofa and walk over to stand next to John.
“You sent me a rather distasteful email this morning. I think you may have confused me with a different professor.” Anderson looked up at Sherlock as innocently as they could manage and after a short silence Sherlock huffed angrily and leaned towards the desk. “You can’t mean to tell me that in less than a month I am supposed to be boarding a plane to some conference in Ireland to give a lecture that I have absolutely no time to prepare for.”
“No, I even fed him multiple times. I don’t know what else to do, George. Why did you have to send me such an attractive and interesting student?”
His mind wondered at the same time it asked:
“Sir?” Sherlock blinked and then shook his head.
“Next you’ll be telling me Doctor Lestrade is the most competent and intellectual professor on staff.” Sherlock scoffed as he sat down on the sofa in a huff. John sat opposite him, in what was quickly becoming
Sherlock's hand froze on the handle as he stared silently into the drawer deducing these minuscule details and forming assumptions. The click of the front door opening snapped Sherlock back into the present. He quickly shut the drawer and turned on his heel, striding over to the couch and throwing himself down on it. As footsteps sounded up the stairs Sherlock threw an arm over his face and let his body go limp, praying John would assume he had been like that for a while.
Sunlight had begun to weakly filter in through the curtains of Sherlock’s room by the time he began drifting off to sleep. Just as his mind began to shut off the bed vibrated once more and Sherlock groaned, eyes startling open to blink blearily at the ceiling.
While Sherlock was away he had no time to play the violin. He had also refused to touch any violin that was not
“Let me buy you dinner first, at least.” John looked up, eyes wide. “Consider it part of your payment for watching my cats, a thank you for the daily updates.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow at the man beneath him and John flushed a bit, rubbing the back of his neck.
Sherlock turned his head to the other side, his arm moved bumping his hand against the outline of his phone. He remembered throwing it aside after staring at John’s picture. It had landed facedown and as he turned it he noticed that the screen was lit.
visitor by now!” Mycroft echoed Sherlock’s sigh, though his was more apologetic and long suffering. He gripped Sherlock’s arm tightly, leading him with difficulty towards the chairs, and gave a polite yet dismissive nod to the doctor.
that John actually liked him. Sherlock was a hard to please, hard to befriend, arse of a person and John was like bottled sunlight with just enough grit at the bottom to enhance its shine. He turned away with a grimace as John hung up the phone.
-~-~-~-~-~-///-///-~-~-~-~-~-
violin which he had left back at the flat. The feel of the solid wood in his hands, resting atop his shoulder, was a comfort. The bow still fit perfectly into his hand as if an extension of it. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed as his cheek lowered to rest against the base of the instrument. Any fears of errors due to lack of practice were erased at the first seamless chords and so Sherlock strained to play what he could not speak.
Sherlock paused for a second, glancing at Allan dozing in the hallway to his bedroom.
“It seems to me that we are all making a fuss over something of little to no consequence. I’ll be the first to admit I am not the most self-aware person to have graced England, however, that is no reason to bring in a psychiatrist. I can personally assure you that I will be just as safe at home with my husband and my maid than anywhere else you may think to put me. Did they not find me where I had fallen and bring me to the hospital in record time? Both of my sons have driven all the way here to be at my side for this minor visit; if I was having issues with my mental state I have no doubts that they would be at my side at a moment’s notice.” The doctor shifted uncomfortably and looked over both Mycroft and Sherlock in turn.
“Promises are arbitrary, John.” A wrinkle appeared between dark eyebrows and John felt something between a laugh and a sob well up in his throat. As he went to stand up, to figuratively run from this beautifully frustrating apparition, that smooth velvet reached out once more to rub against jagged rock. “But, I will do everything in my power, try every other way, so as not to leave your side ever again. Just,” Sherlock made another distressed sound, his eyes pleading and his grip on John tightening, “don’t leave, please.”
“Dr. Lestrade.”
As the upstairs bedroom cluttered with storage and dust, John’s nightmares were beaten back by the unrelenting presence of Sherlock wrapping himself tighter and tighter around John’s heart. The detective wiggled into all of the holes that had been stoppered by secrets and hidden feelings and he continued to erode every sharp and painful edge back down to something manageable.
Allan stood up from his spot at John’s feet and hopped off the sofa, stalking towards the kitchen as Marlowe watched from John’s lap. John’s fingers repeatedly threaded through Marlowe’s thick fur as Sherlock’s eyes followed the movement, sorting through what John had said.
“She is out of town that week.” Sherlock replied flippantly, looking to the side to watch as two freshmen began to yell at one another. “Besides, I don’t want her to clean my house; she will mess up one of my experiments.” Sherlock’s nose scrunched up in distaste and the potential fight ended in a ruckus of laughter.
“Well, I did tell Molly I’d meet up with her at some point for coffee.” John admitted reluctantly. The twinge of jealousy that crawled up Sherlock’s spine was embarrassing to say the least and also something he was going to ignore.
“Sir? Is anyone sitting there?” Sherlock startled and looked up to see an old man gesturing at the seats across from his, blocked off by Sherlock’s long legs stretched into the aisle. A young boy, maybe twelve or thirteen, stood just behind him looking anywhere but at Sherlock or the old man.
“I have nothing to talk about.” Sherlock sighed at last, tearing his eyes from his mother to the ones looking back at him through the mirror. “I’m not going to fill the silence with inane small talk just to make you comfortable. Just put on the radio.” Mycroft held his gaze for a moment or two before returning to the abandoned road. The car fell back into silence.
“I’m actually a professor. I have a doctorate in Biochemical Engineering and Criminal Pathology.” Sherlock crossed his arms and resigned himself to having a conversation, in the airport, during a flight delay, as both Eliot and Henry’s eyes widened a bit. “I’m flying to Ireland to talk at a conference for one of my colleagues.”
“Of what?”
“No, no one is sitting there.”
It took nearly every ounce of willpower Sherlock had not to shove the doctor out of the way and march past him. The room they were led to was as colorless as the one they waited in and utterly devoid of magazines and plants. Mrs. Holmes seemed to have had the color bleached from her as well. The hand Sherlock held in both of his was limp and considerably colder than was usual. Sherlock and Mycroft locked eyes, the quiet buzzing of the heart monitor the only sound between them.
Sherlock’s flat was becoming uncomfortable stuffy as he pictured a stern John Watson glaring at a group of soldiers demanding he let them deal with one of his rebel patients.
“Not in particular…” John took a deep breath, held it for a moment, and then slowly let it out. “I’m not sure why I called, if I’m being honest. Just can’t sleep for some reason.” Sherlock smirked and huffed out a short laugh.
“Are you reaching for a gun or a knife?” John’s eyes cleared and he let out the breath he had been holding chuckling shakily.
“If we’re agreed then, that this stays between us I mean, I’d like to drop it now.” Sherlock frowned but nodded his head. He nearly winced as the cliché
“It is never okay for someone to hurt you.” For a moment, it seemed as if John would collapse and then he was firmly and purposefully twisting away. This time Sherlock let go. He watched as John shoved his phone into his pocket and gathered up his duffel bag, already packed and ready to go. The med student seemed to notice then exactly what he was still wearing and a deep flush covered his cheeks as he mumbled that he was going to change and disappeared into Sherlock’s room.
“So, he hasn’t contacted you at all since then?” Sherlock frowned across the desk at Lestrade as he slouched further in his seat. His feet pushed against the front edge of Lestrade’s mahogany desk and his right knee brushed a stack of books piled up from the floor.
“I don’t need help, I just need a moment to rest.” The short silence that followed nearly held a tangible disbelief. “What are you doing right now?”
“Oh, the emails, yeah. I just thought you would want to know that your cats were being well taken care of since, you know, we never really got to meet in person beforehand.” Allan meowed plaintively as John picked him up and set him down on the sofa. John stood up and moved around Sherlock to start closing his books and packing them into the book bag set on the floor.
“Don’t generalize, John. You’re smarter than that.” John scoffed and then looked away.
The frayed edge of the corner of the old man’s jacket and the boy’s converse shoes marked the pair as middle class. The older man was clearly the younger man’s grandfather due to his tone and vague protective stance. He could have been the boy’s father save for the relaxed set of the boy’s shoulders and the older man’s lack of hyper vigilance and willingness to talk to and even sit with a stranger. The boy was holding a boarding pass while the old man held a simple slip of paper meaning he was only accompanying the younger boy to the gate.
John pressed his face even harder into Sherlock’s shoulder and choked on something that could have been a sob or a curse. His white-knuckled grip on Sherlock’s shirt was painful and after a few more moments, when all the tears had exhausted themselves into the detective’s shirt, John pulled reluctantly away from his shoulder. That intensely blue gaze was locked onto John’s and all he could do was sit there and let the other man cradle him as he felt his heart shattering once more.
“I’m going to kiss you, John.” It was barely a whisper and it took John a moment to fully comprehend what had been said before his eyes went wide and he began to jerk away. Sherlock let him scoot backwards, moving his hand from the doctor’s hair and placing it on his hip instead.
He opened his eyes to the nearly perpetually annoyed ones of Donovan. “Lunch is ready downstairs.” Sherlock gave a short nod of acknowledgement which the maid answered with the roll of her eyes and a huff of displeasure. Sherlock wondered at the barely concealed bruise just at the bend of her neck. Had she been having visitors again? It couldn’t be the old gardener; he never left bruises. Sherlock resolved to break into the detached house later and try to deduce the new man in Donovan’s life. That is if he had time before he left the next morning.
bad.” John chuckled.
When he turned around Marlowe was crouched in front of the door, rear-end wriggling in the air and muscles tensing. The professor gently placed his violin back on its stand and took three quick strides to the door, hurriedly picking Marlowe up just before he tried to leap for the handle once more.
As Sherlock locked the flat behind them a click sounded from one of the other doors.
Sherlock scoffed and tossed his phone onto the sofa as he continued pacing across the floor of his living room. He hadn’t stopped thinking over his and George’s conversation earlier that day, running it over and over in his head, tearing each sentence apart and reconstructing it. Sherlock looked over at the side of the sofa he had not sat in since that first night John had curled so perfectly into the corner to watch television with him.
“No, no, I don’t want to get in your way. You are probably itching to unpack and take a break.” Sherlock snorted and walked into the kitchen taking out his phone. An hour later John and Sherlock were sat on the sofa, surrounded by Allan, Marlowe, and a dozen or so boxes of Asian takeaway, watching a TV show about two brothers fighting monsters.
The kitchen and dining area lay to the left of the door, separated from the living room by a single half way that ran only through the middle of the space, leaving a short entryway on either side. Along the top of the wall were various plants and small petri dishes. A large microscope sat on the small dining room table pushed into one corner and John had spent the better part of thirty minutes cleaning the pile of dishes during an episode of frustrated procrastination.
“Move in with me.” Sherlock whispered. His eyes popped open as soon as the words left his mouth and he heard John’s breath hitch. The med student began to pull away but Sherlock’s arms wrapped around him firmly.
“You’re going to lose track of the plot if you keep staring at me, you know?” Sherlock blushed and turned away.
There was a pause as Sherlock watched Allan stretch and shift into a different position before falling back to sleep. The pictures John had sent at the end of every email flashed in Sherlock’s mind and he glanced at the cold tea and the bags beneath John’s eyes before letting out a slow breath.
(So sorry about the update being late! I was out of state all last week, visiting my grandparents and I didn't bring my laptop with me. Whoops! Anyways here you go, sorry it isn't longer!)
“I just… I guess staying here for that week. It was like an escape, like I’d won a paid holiday or something.” Sherlock reached out and rubbed Allan’s ears, the knuckles of his hands brushing against the fabric of John’s borrowed sweats, as he thought over John’s explanation. “You are also a lot nicer than people make you out to be.” Sherlock froze and Allan meowed in protest, continuing to push his head against Sherlock’s palm.
“You’ve obviously never seen me around Lestrade, or
“You didn’t come to the hospital.” Sherlock’s father barely blinked. He simply sighed and leaned back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest.
“John, if you need any more help with your studies, or anything else, you are welcome to visit at any time.” Sherlock said firmly, locking eyes with the man. John nodded mutely, blushing furiously and obviously forcing himself to maintain eye contact. His father grunted.
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes, your mother is always dying. She is at that hospital at least once every month. I simply
. He watched himself type as though through a screen of his own. Life is an illusion. Nothing truly exists; it is all an elaborate play of imagination.
The look on John’s face was unreadable and so full of emotion Sherlock almost panicked that he had said any of what his brain had admitted out loud.
“I’m beginning to agree with Geffrey and that’s not something I ever wanted to say out loud.”
.” Sherlock scoffed, looking up at John. The student burst into laughter at the utter offense that showed in the professor’s expression. “I’m being
The cafe was a small corner shop down the street from Sherlock’s flat. It was set up in the fashion of an 80’s café with a long counter displaying different meats, cheeses, and sandwich extras along the back wall. The two street-facing walls of the shop were floor to ceiling glass windows with two and four seating tables crowded along the edge. A narrow walkway separated the tables from the counter and left just enough room for the line to queue at the counter and a person to squeeze past it on their way to a table.
“Surely you have friends? Everyone has friends.” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Yes, he did mention that.” The professor said slowly. The man’s face flushed, his teeth grinding together.
“You were serious?” Sherlock’s brow furrowed and he opened his eyes again and sat up a bit. The creak of the bed seemed to echo through the room and Sherlock winced.
He had pulled it out when the flight attendant at their gate had announced their plane was delayed, to check for further information, however, the email just below the one he was looking for caught and held his attention first. The sender was an artificially generated University email and since it was a strand of numbers and not a nightmare inducing mix of abbreviations and shortenings of names it was a student email. But how did a student get his personal email?
“Hello, John and I were just on our way to the cafe.” John perked up as the woman nodded and went to bend down for the mail at her door.
” glared from the midst of John’s email as if highlighted. Sherlock wondered at the answer to that question as a text from his brother previewed at the top of the screen.
The nightmares that had woken him that morning. and every morning since Sherlock had strode into the door and crashed onto the couch, falling asleep instantly, flashed behind his eyes as Sherlock continued to stroke through his hair. Pale hands slipping from his own, black hair disappearing into a crowd, a note left on the door telling John not to look for him, all of Sherlock’s things evaporated into thin air, Sherlock lying dead on the pavement, Sherlock riddled with wounds, blood everywhere.
“How did you…” John glanced at the table and then rubbed a hand over his face. “Right.” Silence fell between the two men as the tabby cat raced off to one of the back rooms. The black kitten had moved to nestle in the blonde’s lap, purring quietly and quickly falling back to sleep. John looked down at Allan and smiled affectionately. “Well, I guess I should get going then.”
John had nearly kissed him Sherlock concluded that the answer was
John thought he would die when it finally, fully hit him that Sherlock was dead. He hadn’t eaten or slept for days. John had avoided contact with other people for the first full week, locking himself in Sherlock’s room and burying his head into the prat’s pillows and blankets. When John finally realized just how desperately and easily and naturally he had loved Sherlock Holmes it was like losing him all over again. It was all John could do to hold himself together as he had sobbed longer than he thought humanly possible. At times, it had felt as if every piece of him would just implode, choosing self-destruction as opposed to life without the crazed detective.
Sherlock’s smirk lasted the entire lift ride. It vanished when a tall, lanky man, with something that was attempting to pass as a beard on his face, leapt to his feet and started talking as soon as the professor had stepped past the threshold of the lift. The student followed a breath behind the professor as Sherlock strolled towards the front doors.
“Will you… Will you read it to me?” There was a beat of silence, Sherlock closed his eyes again and started to quickly add information on how the process of reading a text aloud helped memorize it before he was interrupted by John.
The rest of the email was short and, unsurprisingly, included no mention the incident last night. Sherlock wasn’t sure whether he appreciated the lack of questions about what exactly was happening and why he had wanted John to read his textbook to him.
John blinked rapidly, tears shining at the corners of his eyes and a frown pulling at his mouth. The thoughts and doubts racing through his mind were nearly visible in his eyes and Sherlock refused to let him go as he attempted to twist his chin out of his grasp. Sherlock’s other hand came up to lay gently over the place where John’s father had dug the stain of his fingers into his arm.
“As Mrs. Holmes’ doctor I would feel better if she were to stay a few more days so that we could have our psychiatrist examine her. The wounds you came in with could have been fatal had they been deeper or placed differently. You lost a great deal of blood.”
Sherlock lay on his back staring up at the ceiling above him. In one nearly limp hand a cigarette, unlit and unmarred, dangled dangerously between two long fingers. The professor brought up his heavy hand to present the circular object before his eyes. He twirled it between the pads of his fingers in the air before him and he felt his body sink deeper into the bed beneath him. Each twirl of the cigarette, each second he suspended his arm up and in the air, weighed heavier and heavier until the muscles began to tremble and Sherlock at last let his arm fall back beside him. The cigarette fell as well, tumbling onto the carpeted floor uselessly.
mad, how you
John blinked at the professor and then answered with a simple, “yeah that’s the run of it.” Sherlock hummed and then stood as well, striding over to the suitcases he had left leaning in the short hallway to the bedroom. Pulling out his wallet he handed a handful of notes to John and glanced towards the bookshelves.
“You know what, I don’t bloody care anymore who this sod is or why you are here. You are coming home. Now.” The man grabbed John’s arm and yanked him up from his seat as Sherlock grimaced and glared at John’s father. He could feel the skin between his shoulder blades bristle as he scrambled for a reason to keep John just a moment longer.
Sherlock smirked, Allan had always been a bit of a drama queen. “
“I’m not
“I hope you don’t mind, I threw my clothes in your dryer.” Sherlock shook his head and watched as the man stood up and went to get his clothes. When he disappeared around the corner of the hallway Sherlock looked down at the forgotten sandwich just in time to see Allan crouched into position.
“He has taken a liking to you.” The professor agreed, leaning back against the counter but not really moving out of John’s space. John hummed, the fingers of his left-hand curling to pet Marlowe a bit awkwardly while he finished the first sandwich with his other and started on a second.
Everyone came to University these days expecting to be spoon fed information and given reminders every few hours with instructions on what to do and how to do it. No one wanted to think for themselves or create their own schedule. Without parents to wake them up when they slept through their alarms, students expected their professors to make special exceptions for tardiness due to hang overs and laziness. They wanted to party all weekend and then be given extra time to catch up on the homework they should have done instead.
“I still stand by my assessment.” John said smugly.
Two pairs of eyes turned to regard Sherlock when he entered the dining room and something like anger would have flared beneath Sherlock’s skin if it weren’t for the heavy exhaustion pressing it down. There was no reason to expect his father to have come down for breakfast; it was obvious his place at the table had not been set for quite some time. His mother’s eyes flickered to his duffel and back to his face carrying a touch of hurt and confusion.
“It seems the feeling is mutual. I’ve been staring at the ceiling for hours.”
Lost in the forced recap of last night’s dreams, he failed to hear Sherlock approach him. In his mind’s eye those feet were gliding away from him. Those fierce blue eyes staring at John as the man he loved, that he had killed for, that he would gladly die for, walked off the building’s edge. The feel of a million arms tearing his fingers away from Sherlock’s wrist, wrestling him away from the man sprawled across the pavement, burned his skin. The sharp metallic tang of blood filled his nostrils until he felt he was breathing it into his body. John jumped, eyes wide, as a slender hand fell onto his shoulder.
and I’m not going to live with you because you
Sherlock frowned and looked over the student once more, his arm coming up to awkwardly hover over John’s back. He almost immediately lowered his arm again. Sherlock settled for resting his forehead against John’s shoulder, hoping he could just send his intentions through his skin, past the thin fabric, and into John’s bones. His hands fisted in his lap uselessly and his brow furrowed in frustration. Then, John was turning, his face nestling into Sherlock’s neck and moving Sherlock’s head beside his. The purring mess of cats was now between them and John’s knees rested firmly against Sherlock’s. A deep breath passed between them.
John watched, enraptured, as Sherlock’s face contorted in concentration, his body swaying with the rhythm and intensity of the piece he was playing. Every sleek line of his body orchestrated to further enhance the music pouring from those small strings strung tight against wood. The sight of Sherlock playing, the sound of music filling the flat for the first time since his death, was enough in and of itself to have John’s eyes tearing up. But, what brought those tears tracking down his cheeks like water burst from a dam was the pure, unadulterated emotion conveyed in every sound and expression.
Sherlock’s flat was set up in an interesting fashion. The front door opened to the living room, the wall opposite the door filled with bookshelves where random knick-knacks were set in amongst the disorganized hoard of textbooks and nonfiction novels. To the right of the front door was a short, narrow hallway leading back to the bedroom and the flat’s only bathroom. Along that wall was the entertainment center.
Rain lashed against the windows of Sherlock’s flat, adding a constant static sound to the keening of his violin. Marlowe had hidden himself somewhere in the flat as soon as the storm clouds had started smudging the London sky and Allan had perched himself on a hard won, miraculously empty, space on the half wall between the living room and kitchen. The black kitten’s tail flicked left to right as his green eyes studied the professor’s profile.
Sherlock groaned even louder and threw an arm over his face. He supposed Lestrade couldn’t have known Sherlock had been on the verge of sleep, nevertheless, he was still tempted to suspect Gerard of some sort of evil treachery.
“Sir, with all due respect, I have a medical degree and years of experience working in a hospital.” Sherlock nearly rolled his eyes. The precise calluses worn into the man’s pale hands gave as much away. The doctor looked from Sherlock’s pinched brow and down turned lips to Mycroft’s sullen stare. “I can assure you that we are doing our best to help your mum. She is in the hands of our most skilled physicians.” Sherlock sighed and threw up his hands.
“What? No, not really.” John’s eyes shifted from Sherlock’s at that last part and the professor’s brow furrowed.
Sherlock was certain that the hospital conspired to make their chairs as uncomfortable as possible to encourage some sort of empathy for the patients laying in the beds. Or perhaps they did it simply to discourage anyone else from cluttering and dirtying their rooms. No matter how Sherlock fidgeted or shifted his legs there was no escape from the cold bite of metal or the uncomfortable pain in his side from contorting himself away from the offending silver. The professor resolved to stare a hole into the side of the doctor’s head in an attempt to revolt against their collective aim to make any visit to the hospital a terrible experience.
“I’ve missed him, Allan too.” John confessed.
“I went through something similar.” He said at last. John’s eyes cleared, looking up from his phone and focusing on Sherlock’s, his brow furrowing in confusion.
. Sherlock grimaced and closed his eyes thinking of his brother’s dyed hair.
There was decidedly too much of his brain dedicated to hypothesizing the feel and taste of them, the sound they would make sliding against skin, sliding against his skin, how they would look if John bit him. Sherlock stood up abruptly at that mental image, startling Marlowe, who had settled on the back of the sofa between them, and shook his head. He quickly walked to his briefcase, thrown somewhere by the door, and began pulling out his laptop. Sherlock allowed himself exactly three seconds to think about setting up next to John, with that errant foot pressed against his leg, before he hastily booted up the laptop and poured himself into reading every word of the essays he had just gotten in from his students the other day.

“John is in med school.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
time to prepare. The conference isn’t for a few weeks from now.” Anderson smirked up at the fuming professor and folded their hands on the counter in front of them, locking their fingers together over their phone, face down. “Besides, the University wanted Doctor Lestrade to do it. They only came to you after he turned them down. You should be talking to him.”
“Oh, his name’s Gregory.” John offered a bit lamely. Sherlock laughed at John’s confusion.
The game is not as fun when one has found something that cannot be taken as fun while playing it. Two children playing hide and seek cease to play the game at the local park when one of them nearly falls into a pit. A man stops playing beer pong when he nearly dies from alcohol poisoning while playing it. Sherlock has decided to stop playing “find the differences” around the flat when he finds the next thing that changes his assumptions of John’s life during his death. Really, Sherlock realizes he should have quit playing when he deduced the thing with the gun. But, some people must learn things the hard way.
(Hello! I apologize for the short chapter! I've been super busy this week with graduation for my kids at one job and then working a ton of extra hours at my other job. But now school is over! Which means more time to write! I'm so happy people are actually reading this story and to everyone who has left comments and kudos and who has subscribed: THANK YOU! You encourage me to continue posting and it's for y'all that I stayed up till 2am last night to make sure this chapter got finished and could be posted today before I rush off to work!)
. I was… looking at Marlowe.”
“Sherlock,” He corrected. “The first day I met you, you were asleep on my sofa and when I woke you up you immediately reached under your pillow for a weapon. The speed of your reaction means it is still a reflex you rely on currently. The size of that imprint on your arm and the circumference of your black eye indicate a male opponent. Since you were wearing nothing but a t-shirt and an old pair of jeans, and the fact that it has been raining since 10am this morning, you had to have left from your house. So, unless I was wrong that day and you have a considerably older brother, you still live at home with your father who regularly verbally abuses you judging from your reluctance to let me do things for you, and occasionally physically abuses you.” Sherlock gestured with one hand to indicate John’s physical state. “The way you barely wince when you drank that tea, even with a split lip, means you have to deal with the sting often. You barely paused or shifted at all to find a comfortable position despite your favoring of your right leg, almost as if you are used to sitting in a way that minimizes discomfort from bruises.”
The car had barely stopped moving when Sherlock flung his door open and marched past the maid and into the large front doors of the Holmes estate. He ignored the frustrated call of his name and stormed up the stairs, down a short hall, and into a large mahogany office.
“Were you going to leave without saying goodbye?” Sherlock glanced at Mr. Holmes, standing in the doorway to the dining room in his suit. He had tucked his hands into his front pockets, thumbs out a display of dominance, and was slightly puffing out his chest as if unconsciously trying to make himself appear larger. The man had also positioned himself square in the middle of the doorway, blocking both exit and entrance.
“Thank you for letting me barge into your flat again.” Sherlock watched as Marlowe shifted and began to kneed his paws against John’s leg, purring growing louder at the sound of his voice. Sherlock hummed in acknowledgement and then paused for a moment before reaching out with a foot to nudge at the cat laying across John’s feet.
“Where do you usually go when this happens?” John’s eyes widened and snapped to the professor as Sherlock brought the cup up to his lips and took his second or third sip. He had definitely over brewed the tea.
“Yes.” There was a beat of silence and then John cleared his throat and began to read where he had presumably left off when he called Sherlock. The professor laid on his side and listened, eyes closed, to John’s voice, letting the rough tenor smooth along the edges of his thoughts. Each word ground down upon the ragged, racing edges his trip to the hospital had torn until he found himself falling asleep. The next morning, Sherlock woke to a sore spot on his cheek where the phone had dug into his jaw and a numb ear. The call log recorded last night’s conversation at two and a half hours.
They had nearly made it back to their parent’s house when Mycroft’s eyes flicked to the back seat through the rearview mirror. “Your silence is becoming a bit unnerving; if you have something to say just say it.” In the passenger seat Mrs. Holmes watched the trees and brush pass by with a vacant expression. Sherlock wondered vaguely if she even saw the scenery.
There wasn’t much to be said, what with Mrs. Holmes voluntary muteness and Mycroft’s secretive and largely classified job, yet the silence of breakfast was softer than the one they had endured the day before. Mrs. Holmes worried over her son’s health in the way she passed Mycroft a second piece of toast after her grudgingly finished his first. She gave him a concerned and stern look when he began to pick at and crumble bits of it on his plate. There was a warmth in the way Mrs. Holmes passed Sherlock the butter and a hint of curiosity in her eyes when his cell buzzed in his pocket. Everything was brighter as the sunlight slowly peeked between large tufts of clouds to shine across the room.
floated through his mind like a banner. A banner that was quickly torn away.
Slowly a room without doors or windows unfurled in his mind. A large and unlit fireplace stood along one wall, a small chair and a couch, a coffee table, horridly boring wallpaper. There was a desk in one corner. Pillows and cushions and a throw blanket draped around Sherlock’s shoulders where he sat cross legged on the sofa. His cats appeared, of course, as they always did. A tea cup, brimming with perfectly warm and sugared tea sat before him on the table. Sherlock looked up expecting the scene to have come to completion when he looked at the chair to his left and saw a pair of stunningly blue green eyes staring back at him.
“John? And Sherlock, dear!” The two men both turned at the sound of their names to see an older woman with short red hair coming out of one of the other flats. “I didn’t think I’d be seeing both of you today, what a pleasure.” She smiled at them each politely, eyes widening only slightly at the sight of John’s black eye, and John smiled back as Sherlock gave a short nod.
“You’ve got to eat that first though.” He said with a grin. Sherlock raised an eyebrow at the med student.
“If you keep making that face it’ll get stuck like that, you know.” Sunlight spread across the cheap outdoor tabletop, casting shadows beneath the paper lunch bags set up between Sherlock and Lestrade. All around them the crisp smell of fresh cut grass and the upbeat chatter of University students on lunch break drifted in and out with varying levels of intensity. Sherlock turned the glare he had trained on his food to the professor sitting opposite him.
brilliant. And I just… I couldn’t.”
“Sherlock?” John’s voice called through the receiver. Sherlock’s lips parted but no sound came forward. “Can you hear me?” Sherlock’s jaw worked, his lips moved, his lungs filled and then emptied. Nothing. The professor closed his eyes, one hand fisted in the material of his jeans as the other clutched tighter around the phone.
“Looks like we will be sitting together.” The boy said quietly. His voice was deeper than the professor had expected and held that note of uncertainty that grew naturally from adolescent awkwardness.
“Sherlock, I’m not a charity case!” John fumed.
Sherlock, of course, acted as if nothing had happened; save for the few brief moments in which he seemed to acknowledge that something was still not okay between John and himself. Even these brief acknowledgements were in their own way flippant.
“I’m not hungry.” He whined, thinking of the half-eaten toast he’d had at his parent’s house.
“I couldn’t look Greg in the face for a few solid weeks after they drug me away from your side. It was too much to know that if I looked in his face I would see nothing but pity. We wouldn’t go to the bar to talk about how brilliantly you had solved this case or that or to laugh over something odd you had done without realizing it. No, we would sit down and drink beer and he would want to reminisce about how you
“John won’t be needing any of your help,
John turned to the side and walked to the window. His hands gripped the sill as he leaned forward to press his forehead against the chilled glass. Sherlock watched as John’s eyes closed, as his breath fogged the window. Rain steadily knocked against the opposite side of the window, as if attempting to draw John’s attention from the man behind him. The man who had finally gathered courage he wasn’t aware he lacked to bring up the assumptions he had made about the pills, the scotch, and the gun.
“When do you plan on leaving tomorrow?” His brother asked curiously.
The room feel deadly quiet. Dr. Grundy simply stared at the professor in shock, Mycroft offered no noticeable reaction, Mrs. Holmes looked from her son to the doctor and then back to Sherlock.
The two men ended up turning to the television once again. A new episode of the show they had watched that first night was airing. As the men fought demons both within and without them on screen Sherlock found himself spacing out. His mind’s eye wandered until it found itself picturing John, in army green with all of the equipment, shooting shadowy figures in the darker alleyways of London. Or, given his major, perhaps the student would be running through bursts of gunfire and debris to reach the wounded of either side; patching up wounds and performing amputations regardless of the color on the men’s sleeves.
“Surely you can stay a bit longer. At least until breakfast is over.” Sherlock blinked at his mother.
“What do you mean?”
“It isn’t pity.” He said, voice firm. “I want you to move in with me.”
“Well, I mean ‘you can come over if you need to borrow a textbook’ isn’t the most obvious come-on on the planet.” Lestrade dead panned, rolling his eyes. “Besides, I’ve never known you to be the type of person to get all loopy over a nicely shaped arse.”
“I eat out a lot.” John shook his head and then rubbed the back of his neck with his free hand. Light was shining through the dampened window across the room, which explained why Sherlock’s screen had gotten dimmer as he read.
Sherlock looked down at the man curled up on his sofa contemplatively. A black ball of fur, that would have to be Allan, was curled against the man’s chest beneath a protective arm. Another, larger ball of tabby fur, Marlowe, had nestled itself between the back of the sofa and the back of the man. All three were deeply asleep. The faint sound of Allan purring had been audible even at the front door.
“I’m not
. Sherlock thought drily. At the end of the email was a single picture of Marlowe curled in John’s arm with a look of pure bliss on his face. On the floor, Sherlock could see Allan eating out of the cat bowls in the kitchen.
Sherlock cleared his throat and watched curiously as John shot straight up, blushing terribly. Allan meowed and pawed at John’s face in protest. For a moment, Sherlock contemplated making a joke about giving John some privacy with his cats but decided against it, instead holding the towel out to him.
Slowly their lives began to piece together more and more. Mycroft began annoying them once again and John began to volunteer at various homeless shelters when they weren’t on a case. Sherlock and John would survive hand in hand, moving forward as a unit, even more thickly entwined than before, until the last case was closed and their last breaths had passed.
Sherlock had come back. The insufferable prat was sleeping in the bedroom downstairs. He was alive. Yet John’s brain seemed to deny this so thoroughly, the doubt so deeply ingrained, that every morning since his return the doctor woke to the fresh surprise of his best friend alive and well; wandering around the flat being generally obnoxious and brilliant.
A small package was waiting on Sherlock’s doorstep when he got home. Wrapped in a bit of paper and napkin were a few biscuits and a small note encouraging Sherlock to come over for dinner if he felt peckish later. Sherlock smiled and tucked the letter into a small basket by his door filled with other nearly identical invitations. As he sat down on the sofa to eat the biscuits Marlowe and Allan descended upon him to fight for their own bites in a protest of meows and starved looks.
John’s blush deepened a shade or two and the wetness in his eyes came back. “I appreciate it, really, Sherlock. I wish I could but he would
“Sherlock?” John’s voice rang through the silence of the apartment as the door to their flat opened. Sherlock tracked John’s movement through the sound of his bag hitting the floor and shoes being kicked off just inside the entry way. The waver in John’s voice, the uncertainty there, was not new. It had been there in the slight hesitation of John’s tone since the first time he had uttered it upon Sherlock’s return. Yet the detective had missed it just the same. A wave of guilt crashed against the shore of Sherlock’s consciousness; the brilliant detective that couldn’t recognize the lingering grief in his flat mate’s heart.
Within two hours Sherlock had John’s confirmation and a bag of necessities packed away for the drive to his parent’s house in the countryside. The words “
“You know, maybe that’s it. Maybe he thinks you’re just jerking him off. It sounds like he has enough to deal with at home, you can’t blame him for not playing games.” The only answer was a grunt of annoyance. The two professors sat in silence for a moment thinking over the issue before a knock sounded on the door. Anderson strode into the room with a handful of papers and their nose in the air.
“Well, I’m going to take that as a yes on the food.” John shook his head without looking up.
John still wakes up gasping for breath, hands clutching the sheets twisted around him as if they could somehow ground him. As if the thin cotton, that he has been sleeping under for years, could somehow bring him back to the present, away from the nightmares that plague him in his sleep.
“Change it.” Sherlock snarled.
Sorry about the late update!
John and Sherlock sighed together looking down at the cats between them.
“I was thinking more of a subtle approach.” John mused, swinging his leg up to rest his heel on the edge of Sherlock’s chair. He then bent his foot forward to hook it through the back, locking Sherlock in on one side. “I’ve also hidden the remote and I’m not going to help you find it until you finish the sandwich.” John challenged, crossing his arms smugly.
-~-~-~-~-~-///-///-~-~-~-~-~-
His body felt heavier, immovable; as if he had turned to stone in the space of an hour. If only his eyes would stay closed. They had opened, seemingly of their own accord, to stare unfocused at the ceiling yet again. He felt an itch, buried beneath the layers of stone immobility, a twitch in his fingers for the strings of his violin. If he had brought it he could have risen from this stupor, he could have at least told himself he would get up to play it. Mrs. Hudson wasn’t here to chide him for waking her up at an ungodly hour of the morning. Or was it still night?
I was VERY tempted to end the chapter right before Sherlock got home. You're welcome. <3
Sherlock’s arms came up and wrapped firmly around John’s torso eliciting a hitch and gasp in John’s breathing.
“Please leave.” The doctor spluttered.
John shrugged and glanced away, his eyes beginning to lose focus again. “Isn’t this just more proof though?” He asked, shoulders slumping as the tension left his body to settle in more hidden areas.
“I’m not quite sure,” Sherlock said relaxing once more. He picked at the corner of his sheets. “Hopefully I’ll be out of this house by the end of breakfast.”
It was as if John had been transported to another timeline. He felt as if he were watching from the sidelines, frozen, as his body stood sharply, knocking over the chair, spinning around to grasp at Sherlock’s biceps. His fingers gripped the man’s arms with bruising force as his eyes met the detective’s. Sherlock’s eyes had widened in surprise, his mouth slack. Then John’s arms were tightening around Sherlock’s body, his face pressing firmly against the man’s chest until he found it hard to breathe. Sherlock was wrapping his own arms tightly around the doctor’s body. He had taken up the repetition of John’s name once more, the plea turning into more of a prayer. In this alternate universe John felt tears burning behind his eyes. John could count on one hand the number of times he had let those tears form. This time, he put up no resistance, letting them form in the corners of his eyes and track across what skin they could reach before being absorbed into Sherlock’s shirt.
“Tell me how to help.” Sherlock’s brow furrowed and he frowned.
John jerked back, cheeks flaming, and Sherlock felt everything in him on a spiritual level break into pieces and shatter onto the floor. He just barely managed the energy to open his eyes and catch John striding over to the dining room table where he had left his phone.
“It felt weird enough going through your pantry, trying to find something that wasn’t expired or labeled for future experimentation. By the way, you never did explain why there are petri dishes of various molds on your counter.”
“It’s not like I don’t have a reputation for being a cold asshole.” Sherlock huffed. “Surely, any attempt at being friendly on my end should be an immediate red flag that I’m probably propositioning you.” Lestrade laughed and hit his desk.
Mycroft’s glares kept the nurses at bay until well past visiting hours as the men watched over their mother. Sherlock held her hand the entire time while his brother shifted between gently moving the hair from her eyes and standing guard at the window and door in turn. Mrs. Holmes did not stir, her only contribution the quiet beeping of machinery; a cold and calculated reassurance that she had not passed.
“I’m not taking your bed from you.” Sherlock’s head cocked to one side as he looked back at John. “There isn’t room for a second bed in your flat and I’m not going to make you sleep on the couch.” A faint blush had begun to spread across John’s cheeks.
Of the two things Sherlock expected to see on the other side of his door so late in the evening John, soaking wet without a jacket or umbrella, was neither. The med student looked exhausted; dark purple bruises beneath his vibrant eyes and a slackness to the muscles around his mouth. As Sherlock’s eyes adjusted to the bright lights of the hallway streaming into his unlit room he noticed that one of those purple bruises was considerably darker and larger than the other. A red line split John’s bottom lip straight down the middle and, as Sherlock’s eyes scanned over the rest of his body, he noticed the outline of a hand on one of John’s arms and that the student was favoring his right leg.
“How did you…”
“Actually, I think I’ll be going to bed now.” Mycroft met Sherlock’s eyes and gave a short nod.
Honestly, sometimes Sherlock wouldn’t have been surprised to find out he had been teaching High Schoolers this entire time without realizing it.
For a short moment, Sherlock had the very clear image of himself striding across the space between them, gripping the letter opener from its designated place, and stabbing his father in the eye. He could almost feel the hot blood wetting the spaces between his fingers, staining his fingertips, pooling in his palms. The door shut behind him with a loud
“John? It’s nearly two in the morning.”
be there every time she feels as though she might faint. She always comes back right as rain. Now if you don’t mind I have work to do; unlike some in this family, I do not have the luxury to call in a sick day.” Sherlock bristled but his father turned back to his papers and waved a flippant hand in his direction as he picked up the discarded pen.
“Marlowe is laying on top of my head.” John said sounding slightly amused and slightly annoyed. This time the student earned a full laugh punched from Sherlock’s gut.
“Your fridge is a wasteland; don’t you ever eat?” Sherlock jumped at John’s voice and blinked up at him. The med student’s hair was tussled, a few crusts of sleep in the corners of his eyes. John’s bruises were a shade darker though Sherlock was not quite sure if it was the lighting or if they were slowly revealing the strength behind the marks. Sherlock’s eyes quickly skipped over the low waist band of John’s borrowed sweats to see Allan following closely behind the student.
“Doct-Sherlock… I don’t know what kind of research you’ve done on me but I’m impressed.” Sherlock frowned, his brow furrowing deeply. He opened his mouth but John shook his head, looking down at the cat laid in his lap instead of the man at the other end of the sofa. “I guess I shouldn’t be surprised you would look me up. I mean we didn’t get a chance to meet at all or even talk that much before you let me basically live in your flat for a week.” John’s mouth twisted down and he winced. “But, you can’t tell anyone what you just said. Whatever else you found out about me; you can’t tell anyone.”
“Well, he
The right hand, top drawer of John's desk has been opened hundreds of times in Sherlock's absence. He can tell because, when he pulls it out, the grooves, where the wheels that allow it to slide in and out of the frame rest, have deepened considerably. There is a scratch at the lip of the drawer that wasn't there before. The amount of dust is not consistent with three years of disuse. There was no doubt that John had been opening this drawer repeatedly in the wake of Sherlock's death. A drawer empty save for the solid weight of a singular, metallic object; John's gun.
“I put an old shirt and a pair of sweatpants on the bathroom counter for you to change into; just leave your clothes in the tub for now.” John opened his mouth as if to argue but the weight in his shoulders seemed to discourage him enough not to argue. With a satisfied nod, Sherlock walked into the kitchen and began searching for his tea pot.
With all the drama, occasional self-centeredness, and melancholy surrounding his mother Sherlock still loved her more than any other human being. Of course, the companionable atmosphere held between Mrs. Holmes and her sons as they ate was never going to last when the storm that had ripped into their lives when Sherlock turned six stalked the halls.
. Mummy’s voice chided softly at the back of his mind.
“Yes, well, we all know your mother. I have a lot of paperwork to go through,” he said with a gesture towards the stack of papers, “she doesn’t need me there every time she gets admitted. Besides Donovan took care of everything just fine.” Sherlock snarled at his father, hands fisting at his sides.
Sherlock hesitated when he reached John, standing so close behind him he could feel the heat of his body. John hadn’t moved though he must have heard Sherlock coming towards him. Panic began to lick at the edges of Sherlock’s mind. Was this going too far? What exactly did John mean by telling him this? Was there something beneath these admissions that revealed one more, very important, thing Sherlock had failed to notice in his self-centered hurricane of being or was he drawing conclusions that weren’t there to be drawn?
Sherlock’s face performed several acrobatic feats before he shoved a hand into his trench coat and pulled out his phone.
, his brain pleaded.
“Thank you, my name is Henry.” Henry smiled and held out a hand to the still slouched, nearly out of his seat, professor. Sherlock considered snubbing the gesture but Lestrade’s constant displeased comments on his lack of basic social skills found him sitting up straighter, pulling his legs in, and letting the larger man’s hand engulf his own. The callouses sang manual labor and dedication. “This is my grandson Eliot.” Sherlock smirked and nodded to the boy.
“Listen, I’m… Thanks for letting me crash on your sofa. I didn’t mean to fall asleep.” Sherlock leaned back against the wall behind him, his head hitting with a soft thunk. Allan sat down and began rubbing his head against John’s ankle, purring. Sherlock watched the black cat for a moment and then frowned.
There would barely be a pause before his thumb clicked on the email as it popped up. A short paragraph or two would fill the screen, sometimes only a few sentences. At first Sherlock found a picture of one or both of his cats at the end of the emails but, occasionally, after the third day the man he had hired would pop up in the photos as well. It started off with a lap or an arm, maybe a hand, but the day before Sherlock left to come home the man had sent an actual selfie with Allan perched on his shoulder. There was no describing the eyes that crinkled into the lens of the camera or the way John’s smile, tight and controlled yet genuine, tightened the muscles of Sherlock’s heart and lungs. He had quickly closed the picture and abandoned his phone on the nightstand for the rest of the evening.
The number of files in Sherlock’s
Sending off the text Sherlock spun on his heel to stalk further down the office hallway to the lift set in the center of the building. Just as he stepped onto the lift and pressed the button for the first floor his phone buzzed in his pocket.
“We’ve had this conversation before.” Sherlock frowned suddenly. “You called me
A beep sounded from the direction of Marlowe’s escape and Sherlock’s brow furrowed as John blushed.
“She’s a friend, a year below me in the program. She’s focusing more on autopsies and things, though. I’m more interested in living patients.” John chuckled. Sherlock grinned thinking about the eyeballs at the back of his freezer.
“Thank you, love. You should put some ice on that bruise, dear.” She frowned and tutted as her eye caught the bruise on his arm. Mrs. Hudson opened her mouth to say something but then shook her head and gave a short sigh. “Well, I’m glad to see you and Sherlock spending time together. You’ll be good for each other.” She all but giggled the last part, reaching out to give John’s cheek a cheerful, if carefully delicate, pat. Before either man could process the implication behind her statement she disappeared back into her flat, leaving behind the smell of brewing tea and biscuits.
That first email at the airport hadn’t been the last. During Sherlock’s absence, he had received an unexpected daily update. At first it had seemed a bit annoying and frivolous. Surely, the man did not think Sherlock was crazy enough to require a daily picture of his cats. But after the third or fourth day he would find himself laying in the uncomfortable guest dorm bed, staring at the email inbox on his phone, waiting.
“I’ll come with you.”
John’s tanned skin and thick eyelashes were enough to win anyone over. The fact that he had eyes the color of the ocean’s tide, ever changing according to the weather and current, and toned muscle, that betrayed his high school rugby years, was frankly unfair. And now this gorgeous man was leaning over Sherlock’s frozen body, hands landing on either side of the sofa’s backrest just brushing his shoulders. John’s lips were chapped and pink and closer than Sherlock had dared hope for. Sherlock’s lungs were screaming for air, air that his brain reasoned, was utterly nonexistent save behind those lips. He closed his eyes reluctantly and just as John’s face came close enough for Sherlock to feel each breath two different ringtones echoed off the walls of the flat.
Moments passed, an hour, time dripped like honey down the length of a wooden spoon, and slowly Sherlock let the image before him fade and drift away until he was back in his hotel. Sherlock’s eyes refocused until they found him looking at a phone clutched in his lap. The notification light at the top left corner blinked up at him, yellow for emails blue for text messages red for everything else. When he unlocked the screen he pointedly ignored the twisting of his heart as he clicked on the email from John.
Sherlock asked the mirage of one John Watson. The man had the audacity to smile knowingly and give him a look that carried all the certainty Sherlock’s mind held. John was safe. He was as safe as the sofa beneath him, the blanket around his shoulders, the tabby cat curled in his lap, and the black one laid on the mantle. He had no right to be the warmth of a good cup of tea or the comforting smell of fresh biscuits. John Watson had barely crossed the threshold of Sherlock’s life and yet the professor found himself yearning to be the tea cup held so firmly in his hands. Blue china, a match to the one before him on the coffee table.
The ceiling, slightly faded from old age, was no proper replacement for John. Sherlock frowned disapprovingly and closed his eyes. When the tea was finished, John returned, placing one mug on the floor by Sherlock’s dangling hand and the other on the side table next to his chair. Sherlock did not touch his cup the rest of the night. He didn’t move from the couch until well into the morning. He spent the hours between pacing the halls of his mind palace, wracking his memory of every image of John, trying to find what else he had missed.
. He swiped the answer button just before the ringing would have given up and played the voicemail tone.
Sherlock, please.” The whisper was enough to bring Sherlock’s attention from bruising the man’s shoulder with bites and kisses.
“I could tell you all were getting pretty attached while I was gone.” A red color tinted John’s cheeks as he rubbed the back of his neck again. “The place your renting now doesn’t allow pets, does it? And you didn’t have any growing up?”
going to think this was anything less than impractical. It certainly wasn’t
“Come down when you feel like it then, or starve, see if I care.” Donovan huffed. Sherlock glared at the door but eventually slid off the bed and begun dressing himself. The thought of food had begun to turn his stomach and the more Sherlock replayed the conversation with John over the phone the more he found himself wanting to leave immediately. Maybe, if he left now, Sherlock could get back to the flat in time to take John to lunch. The idea had him stuffing what little items he had unpacked into his duffel bag faster and marching downstairs.
“What about Mrs. Hudson?”
“It’ll never happen.” John scoffed. “Are you going to finish that?” John’s brow furrowed in concern as he gestured at Sherlock’s food with his fork. The professor looked down at his carton and scoffed, setting it on the table. He had ordered enough food for two more out of a need to make the student feel more at ease than out of any real sense of hunger.
Exhausted. Protective. Has a younger sibling? Overworked. Dedicated. Grew up poor.
“They take every opportunity to make my life hell.” John chuckled in amusement that broke on a yawn.
“Sod off!” Sherlock yelled in response. There was a loud and distressed sigh.
.” Sherlock winced and looked away. “I realize that sounds a bit terrible saying something like that to you.”
Now, Sherlock didn’t consider himself the strongest man on the planet. But, he was fairly confident he could push John’s leg off the chair with minimal injury to either of them, depending on how hard John fought him, and it didn’t take a genius to find a remote in such a small flat. Sherlock reasoned he had a clear advantage and yet he set his cup down and began to eat the sandwich anyways. It was worth it to earn the grin John sent his way.
“I have work to do.” It wasn’t exactly a lie. Though, the work Sherlock had to do to prepare for lectures Monday could wait until later that night and all his grading for the last assignment was done and submitted. The professor spent most of the Summer outlining and planning his lectures and assignments in-between the few Summer courses he taught and so the only prep left was a few tweaks or additions. Mrs. Holmes frowned.
That faint smell of John’s cologne was stronger than it had any reason to be near his bed. The pillows were flatter than he had left them. The bed had not been made with that military preciseness. And since when did Sherlock sleep with a bottle of scotch and a half empty bottle of Ambien in the bottom drawer of his night stand. Sherlock decided to stop looking for hidden differences in the flat when he noticed the prescription date did not line up with the number of pills missing and the bottle of opened scotch had quite a bit missing from it for having been opened so recently.
“No… Neither. I’m sorry.” John shook his head as he carefully sat up on the sofa. “I shouldn’t be sleeping in the middle of the day.” Sherlock glanced at the medical textbooks open on the coffee table with a note laden notebook and a pen beside them. There was a cup of long-gone cold tea sitting on one of the coasters.
