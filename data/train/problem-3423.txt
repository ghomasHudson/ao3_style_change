“Oh, that sounded like a good idea, isn’t it, Charlie?” Balthazar turned his attention to Charlie, before he looked around his seat in confusion. It took him few seconds to register, “There’s no seatbelt here.”
Dean smiled and tapped Rowena's hand before he stood up to get some books from the Men of Letters' collection.
, being Death, I have the privilege of transporting the departed one there. If, and only if, the departed one is an angel or a demon. Just like what The Empty would take."
Someone answered the call. No, not someone, Castiel answered the call. The man he was actually looking forward to talking with.
From the reaction that he gave, Dean smiled when Crowley caught his intention. "That's what I've been sitting on these past few days. Then when I returned, we could do the demon purifying ritual. Just like what we did when I had the Mark of Cain."
Dean shrugged at the suggestion, “No, I haven’t. But, maybe you’re right, I’ll go ask the HR. Thanks, Balz!”
Someone with dark messy hair and probably the bluest eyes Dean had ever seen, it was like looking at the sky after the night had lifted up its blanket of darkness, and before the sun had fully risen. Dean didn’t want to sounded so chick-flick-ish, but that was all he got for that man’s eyes. For now.
The Empty somehow looked satisfied with the answer given, then he made a sitting movement. At that moment, the black goo that surrounded him before started to make a shape that looked like a chair with a Gothic regal design.
There were times where Castiel wondered if he should tell his children about his sexuality. But, he was afraid,
“So, what’s up with you today?” Sam came with a slice of pie for his big brother and sat next to him. “Wait, few days ago you said that you felt something weird on your teeth, why are you having pie?”
Dean was about to let that go, when one of the students that he supposed to teach for his next period came and asked for the hall’s key. The teacher told the pupil that he will be there in five minutes, as scheduled.
“Then I think it's the ending where you're just like us,” Sam said calmly, as he continued to look down on Chuck. It was the voice of someone who was beyond forgiveness, and way far from compassion, “And like all the other humans you forgot about.”
Dean huffed and placed his face into the hook of his arm on the top of the Impala. “Cas, don’t scared me like that. I thought there was something happened to you.”
"No. It was dark and quiet. I didn't hear anything. I didn't know what she heard, what made her say it was loud."
“What? No, no, Cas. Sorry about that. Sorry for scaring you, I’m alright. Look, I’m on my way home and I’m gonna stop at the supermarket to get some stuffs for our cooking show tomorrow. So, what’s on your mind? Have you looked for recipes?”
"Abbie!" Charlie raised her wine glass that now was half full. "Sorry, I was talking to this girl, and i don't want these boys to peek," Charlie made her way to Castiel's side and joined him. "Wow! Love your hair, sister! Ginger power!"
It took a few moments for Dean to remember what his brother was talking about, then it came back to him about the candy exhibition. The first person that came to his mind, of course, Castiel. But then on a second thought, dentist and
“Well, there he is, the handsome angel,” Rowena smiled to Cas, who returned it with an equal sheepish smile that he gave to Dean. “It’s so glad to see you again, sweety pie. Here, have a drink,” she handed a glass of whisky to the angel.
Without waiting for his guest’s response, Castiel dashed up to his bathroom and let out a long sigh when seeing his silver ring next to the basin. He quickly wore the ring and jogged down the stairs, while grabbed the two mugs on the coffee table.
Then Cas realised that by answering so, it might be sounded worse than saying that the man across the line is the man that he currently smitten of.
Dean reflexively grabbed his phone that was sliding off the dashboard to the other side of the car when he turned a corner. For a moment his Impala went off the lane and made the car behind him honked furiously.
"No, come on. I know that face," the elder brother frowned, he was familiar with the gestures and tone of voice whenever something was bothering his little brother's mind. "That's uh, that's Sad Sam face."
“Turn around,” Mick purred on Castiel’s ear while he took out the sachet lubricant from his pocket. As he saw his bottom turned around and flaunted his gorgeous globes, Mick landed a soft slap on each cheek. He then poured a generous amount of lube into his hand, and then the rest went to Castiel’s hole. While he prepared Castiel with his fingers, Mish placed kisses on the other man’s back, all along the spine up to the neck. He then stopped on the shoulder blades before biting the spot where Castiel’s shoulder met the neck. Again, he managed to make Castiel release a filthy moan from his mouth.
was changed to the clean one, since the one they were using before was all dirty from the half-explosion their cooking was made, due to lack of surveillance.
It might be a slight confession that Cas just gave him, but Dean didn’t care. He would agree to meet Cas anytime!
“Dean,” his eyes widened (if it was still possible) and it looked like he could cry at any moment, and it somehow made Dean’s chest hurt. He didn’t want that look to stay on Cas’ face.
"Jack," Eileen rose up from her chair and walked to the boy, "I think there's a room in the dungeon with Men of Letters' archives and documents. Let's find something there."
“I’ll be back,” the lady turned on her heels and headed to another booth. She clearly missed out the two grown-up children who were now giggling to their menu book.
For now, she knew that she will continue writing that first morning together for Dean Winchester and the newly human Castiel, that was filled with happiness for both of them.
"Cas," he started in a lower and softer voice than he intended to, "I honestly didn't know Abaddon is your sister, twin sister even."
The other man chuckled as he followed Dean inside, “Yeah. She’s a good dog. I’m honestly amazed, Crowley taught her well.”
Hearing that, Dean decided that he might as well tell his brain that he never had any information about one Castiel Novak from Balthazar, except the fact that they used to be lovers.
He paused, and, again, from the look on his brother's face, Dean could tell that Sammy could see where the story would go, or how it would end, but he decided to let his big brother tell him the story.
"I'm sorry, bro," Gabriel shrugged at Castiel's remark, "I don't think you would like going to bars and do silly things here."
Sam slung his arm around Eileen and said to Dean, “So, hey, you don’t mind having Jack with you here? He could give you a company for the drive home.”
The last bit made sent shivers to Castiel’s spines before he lifts up his face and met Dean’s face. The blond man was having his eyes on Castiel, with calculating look on his face, that made the doctor blushes and have to look down to the folder again to hide it.
have his good night sleep because of this when Gabriel slide next to him, and crowding him to the armrest. “We are gonna talk about this
” Castiel knew the effect of his deep voice to his sex partners, and he liked it. After he felt two more playful slaps on his ass, Castiel heard the sound of a condom pack being opened and not long after, Mick entered him. As the Irish man paused and let him get accustomed with the size that had entered him, Castiel felt Mick’s hand find his nipples and started teasing them. It didn’t take long for Castiel to think that the stimulation had done too much to him. He pushed his ass backwards to Mick as a sign for Mick to start moving.
The big brother opened the boot of the Impala, there was a quick faint of change of expression on his face when he saw what was inside. It was from the sight of a ruffled duffle bag that looked like a tan trench coat at first glance. It was something that completely skipped his memory, apparently, since the brothers haven’t used that duffle bag in a while. He then continued to open the compartment under the boot that revealed a deadly arsenal for monsters of any kind. From shotguns, machete, grenade launcher, all that you could dream of.
the colour orange!” the small protest that came out from Cas’ mouth just invited Dean’s laughter to join. “I bought it just after I moved here, two years ago, I guess.”
Castiel’s laughter exploded again at the question, and it quickly replaced the light jealousy in Dean’s chest with covering warmth. “Yeah, yeah, that’s the one. His name is Fergus Crowley, but God knows why he would prefer to be known as Crowley. I’d forgotten the whole story, but it involved three pigs.”
changed him. He watched me protecting you, he watched me protecting people that we saved, and it changed how he sees about humanity. I didn't even know that-how that was affected him, Sammy. I just did what I was trained to do, you know? Hunting people, saving things, the family business, but Cas saw
But when Rowena said that she could also make a spell as Dean requested, he could feel like his hopes just boosted again.
Cas smiled while putting on the tan trench coat, "Thank you, Dean. Maybe later when we're about going to bed?"
“Um, yeah, so far,” he paused, and made Dean feels almost guilty for asking, but then Cas continued, “I don’t think I will have anymore soon. Since I doubt Lucifer will ever remarried, Raphael was busy working with my father. I couldn’t say much about her, because we weren’t that close, and father treated her more like apprentice than daughter these days. Then, Gabriel … he’s, uh, he’s living his life to the fullest and I don’t think marriage is in his plan. I think he had relationships here and there, but it’s hard to picture him settling down, really. He’s happy enough with Claire in his life, I suppose, and Lucifer didn’t mind Gabriel baby-sitting Claire, so that worked well. Samandriel was still in college, marriage and reproducing probably still far away in his mind, he’s quite ambitious that boy.”
his first time being manhandled, but this was the first time the other person was bigger and more buffed than him. And it felt fantastic.
It was five-thirty in the morning, and the sun will rise in near time. Castiel loved enjoying the sun rise from his giant window, across his living room’s sofa before going out for his morning jog. He sat, with Misha having breakfast next to his leg, and looked around his current staying place.
Before she could answer, Abaddon noticed Castiel’s signal from the way he moved his eyes to the direction of Lily, who came to their table with their breakfast orders. With movements that were shaped by years of experience, she placed the pancake — just like Castiel ordered, with
The barely there question triggered violent drumming inside Cas’ chest, yet he still managed to nod as a response before closing his eyes and succumbed to the touch, when Dean had his hand wrapped the side of his face.
Unfortunately, just as they turned around, the rest of the vamp-mimes pack were there, waiting for them. It was a trap. As soon as he saw them, the big brother told the kids to run out from the barn to safety, as he promised, while he and his brother fought the vamps. There were four of them, two for each brother. Shouldn’t be a big deal.
Earlier, he needed a bigger fix than usual because coping with stress isn't something Castiel is equipped for anymore. Maybe once, as a proper angel, but not now. Now he's weak and scared and anxious, self medicating himself through experimentation and careless risks. For a brief while, it looked as if Castiel was improving. That maybe he wouldn't die an addict, but old habits have a tendency to come back with a vengeance.
Open they go, searching for their counterpart. Blue, the exact blue in his dreams. Normally, it's hard to hold eye contact with an alpha, his submissive nature instructing him to avoid it. But not with these eyes, these eyes are so different, so unique.
"Oh," is all Dean can manage at the moment because Castiel's pace quickens, the drag of his dick unlike any other Dean's ever experienced.
Already moaning, Dean feels like he could at come at any second. He's never been this turned on before and he doesn't even know what this person looks like.
Castiel produces a delayed sort of yelp at the sound of more knocking, finally shuffling across the room to answer it. At the last second he decides to look down to make sure he's dressed.
Now that they're both sated and tucked away, he wants to see Dean's eyes, like a gas tank running on empty, Castiel needs to
"Your fucking scent drives me crazy," Castiel husks out, still fucking his never ending load into Dean's raw ass. "I smelled you from down the street. And I just knew, that's
"Neither, found a new guy. Fucking loaded...so I need you to make him wanna come back, understand?" John says and Dean hears the unspoken threat loud and clear.
He decides to kiss Castiel in order to avoid the hardship of words. The kiss is awful, because the moment they make contact more silent tears are cascading down Dean's face. "Cas, let's make love, like we used to..."
"I'm going to save you from this terrible place," Castiel declares, fucking into Dean hard and fast. "And then I'm going to kill that piece of shit..."
Breakfast is a quiet affair, there's really nothing to talk about. Eventually, John will tell him the plan for the night. Dean's hoping for an easy lineup, just a couple of blow jobs and a few quick fucks. He's not in the mood for one of the regulars to book him in private for the whole goddamn night.
It feels good, despite the nominal pain and the fact that the passion is gone. It's sterile and mechanical, like Dean is fixing an engine rather than pleasuring a lover. Castiel's orgasm builds regardlessly, boiling deep in his gut. It's true, he's become a whore.
Castiel has studied Dean long enough to know that he’s feeling reckless and bold, lust engulfing the hunter’s entire aura. Poorly timed bravery might just end their whole charade right here, right now. And in this moment, the fog of desire clouding his better judgement, Castiel realizes he’s too far gone and weak to care.
Castiel almost sobs, because Dean's pulling out of him way too fast. Collapsing forward onto the puddle of his own come, Castiel curls himself into a ball and lays on his left side. He faces the array of drugs on the end table, wishing he had the energy to light up. Although his expression is blank, Castiel finds himself pathetically wishing that the hollow, empty feeling inside him was solely physical.
Dean can't handle much more, he needs to come again. Castiel relinquishes his hold, allowing Dean's arms their freedom. For the first time, Dean touches and explores his lover. His curious palms make their way into Castiel's raven colored hair, carding through the locks and traveling down his neck to explore the muscles of his shoulders and back.
Adding to his turmoil are the severe pangs of guilt that strike whenever he thinks about how he’s forcing Jack to lie as well. Castiel hates the idea of the boy carrying around that kind of weight, he wants Jack to be honest and free. Jack deserves someone to lead by example for him.
It seems Dean is taking too long tonight, because he hears the stern call of his father, "Where's my bitch?"
The long, hot shower is the best part for Dean, scrubbing himself clean of all the men who soiled him. Sure, he cleans himself in between clients, but this shower isn't part of business. With this shower, he can take his time, decompress his muscles while soaking in a bath if he wishes. Dean likes the bubbles. He imagines the dirt, sweat, and come physically falling away from his body, that maybe this will be the last time, that maybe tomorrow something will
Dean staggers towards him, swaying this way and that, unable to walk a straight path. He's hammered. Again, selfishly, Castiel wishes Dean was 'angry drunk', coming here to fuck his brains out. That's easier. Easier than watching the man he loves crumble and fall apart.
No amount of stories or hearsay could have prepared Dean for what being claimed feels like. Castiel's teeth pierce the skin on his neck, activating life's most permanent of rituals. The bite is quick, yet the aftermath is wonderfully drawn out. Castiel keeps rocking into him, all the while sucking additional marks and territorial bruises all over Dean's throat. Dean feels reborn, an unexplainable satisfaction diffusing throughout his body. He's
He craves the subtle comfort of someone trying helping him, of someone wanting to save him. A nasty little part of his brain nags at him, hissing darkly that he doesn’t deserve those things.
is actually telling the truth. Then there’s also the possibility that being intimate with Dean will not bring him the ultimate happiness he thinks it will.
"Not done yet," Dean nearly growls. "When are you gonna realize those assholes you're technically related to aren't important. Just 'cause they're blood don't make 'em family. Their opinion of us or your job doesn't matter, don't even give them an ounce of power for one fucking second. Your family is
Dean is seething. At the moment, Castiel doesn't know or care why, maybe he's jealous, maybe he's drunk, maybe he's angry at the shit situation their lives have become.
Castiel pins Dean's wrists above his head, sinking his cock inside Dean's wet heat in one swift movement. Dean can't help but shout, Castiel's cock is absolutely huge and fills him up perfectly. They slot together like they were specifically designed for each other. The alpha's weight feels massive on top of him, his frame large and masculine. Castiel grazes his teeth over the thin skin of Dean's neck, the temptation to bite down almost getting the better of him. He decides to nibble playfully instead, leaving Dean teetering on the edge of what he wants most.
There's a knock on the door, but the stranger doesn't wait. Upon entering, the person brings in with them the most heavenly fragrance Dean has ever smelled. It not only fills his nose, but burrows its way into his
Castiel can't help but feel uneasy, as wonderful as their reunion was, many other unrelated things plague his mind, causing him to be silent, clinging onto Dean extra tightly. Castiel knows that Dean can tell he's upset, praying that he just let's it go, not wanting to verbalize all the nonsense swimming around inside his head, because once he starts he won't stop.
Dean theorizes that he must be dead. His father snapped last night and finally killed him. Because fairytales like this are nonsense, they don't happen in real life.
Dean holds strong, clinging to Castiel determinedly, "Why don't you ever say it back? I know you love" --hiccup-- "me, Cas...I know you do."
Suddenly, Castiel is screaming and coming, his pulverized hole clenching around Dean's length. It gives Dean the push he needs to spill his own release into Castiel with a low groan. Dean never uses a condom with Cas.
They reposition and Castiel's cock enters Dean's shaking, sweaty body with excruciating slowness. The whole time Castiel remains mesmerized with Dean's appearance. He's so beautiful. Swollen lips and burning, red cheeks smattered with freckles. Castiel doesn't dare blink. Once bottomed out, Dean sighs and begins to rise just as slowly, restarting the process.
So many crazy things are coursing through Dean's mind during this moment. He would die for this man, sacrifice himself in an instant. His soul feels fresh and unburdened, if it were a tangible item he's sure it would being glowing. He can
John comes with a growl, his knot pulsing wave after wave of hot come into Dean's throbbing ass. With not much fanfare, John rolls them onto their sides and spoons his body around Dean, his cock still buried inside. There's no 'good night', just silence and then snoring. As the sun comes up, Dean finally shuts his eyes. His last thoughts are always dedicated to Sam, hoping he's safe.
So he smokes, killing himself slowly. Castiel can bear a bit of discomfort in his throat, so long as the promise of escaping reality is his short term reward.
He transports his brain somewhere else. Closing his eyes, he pretends the cock in his mouth isn't John's, he pretends it's his true mates. An imaginary man, that if he concentrates hard enough, Dean can almost visualize. He's tall and toned and has eyes a shade of blue deeper and truer than the ocean.
"So green," the man whispers, studying Dean's face. It's almost like looking in a very strange mirror, internally Dean feels exactly how the other man's expression looks.
scent, about what it would feel like to be in love. He starts playing with his tiny cock, trying to convince it to harden. His fantasy is enough to cause a gush of slick to flood his hole, his cock perking up as well.
Still fully clothed, Castiel only exposes his cock, lubes it up with spit and pre come, sliding home inside the man he loves with a gasp of unrivaled pleasure. Nothing in the world compares to being inside Dean, pressing their bodies closer and closer, Castiel burying himself as deep as he can go. Lacing their fingers together, Castiel lays his chest possessively over Dean's back, slowly building up a rhythm until he's pounding into him.
War has altered Dean's chest with new scars and inflated muscles. Castiel wishes he could erase the blemishes on Dean's sun-kissed skin like he used to, instead of just gawking at him sadly.
Dean is relieved it's not Crowley, but sometimes the devil you know is better than the one you don't. Things can always get worse, life has certainly taught him that.
Castiel doesn’t need to say it and Sam certainly doesn’t need to hear it, but there is is, dangling between them anyway. Sam seizes the opportunity to lunge forward like some overgrown puppy, pulling Castiel into a lumbering bear hug. It’s uncoordinated due to the fact that they’re both sitting, but the imperfection of it only makes Castiel cling tighter.
His tolerance has grown to a point that would be considered impressive if it were any other topic. Most of the time he doesn't even feel high anymore, he just feels...ironically human. Consuming just enough to get by.
"I do...I wanna have a baby with you. Didn't really know it 'til right now, but yeah, that sounds...awesome," Dean confirms, kissing Castiel's cheek before adding, "You'd be such a great Dad."
Some of the tension leaves Dean's body as he relaxes against Castiel. They stand there for a while, until Castiel begins to sway and sag, sinking slowly towards the floor and pulling Dean along with him.
It's something Dean's learned to cope with, years of abuse tend to do that to a person. It's either deal with the life he's been given or go insane. And insanity isn't an option in Dean's mind, he needs to hold onto whatever shred hope he has left.
Sometimes Dean almost makes him feel too much, truly scared of how easily he loses himself to this man. Ready at any moment to give it all up, all of it for
Dean should stop touching himself and look up at the man, but he literally can't stop himself. Lust and instinct enable Dean to keep going, all logical thought slowly eroding away. Not to mention addition of this guy's voice, rough and underused, it has Dean leaking everywhere.
Castiel's stomach drops when he realizes he's become part of that burden, become just another thing for Dean to look after and protect.
It’s a very odd phenomenon to mourn your life prior to your own death. Castiel is no stranger to dying, but this new daunting fate he’s been sentenced to feels foreign, somehow much scarier than any of the other times. It’s twisted and calculated and heartbreakingly evil.
Leaving it unbuttoned, Castiel plops down onto the bed and revels in the warmth the soft shirt provides.
Blood boiling, his rage is back worse than before, he hasn’t felt it like this in eons. He knows that if his Grace were at full power he’d be able to muster enough raw energy to summon an earthquake and leave Lebanon in ruins. However, the lightbulb from his bedside lamp sparks feebly, but in the end it doesn’t shatter. Castiel barks out a false laugh, even the lamp is mocking him.
Dean turns back to look down at Castiel from the top of the stairs, “Kid just doesn’t understand the rules.” Dean’s lighthearted voice is clearly forced. He further covers up
awakens something primal inside him. Dean suddenly wishes he wasn't on the pill, he wishes that Castiel could get him pregnant. He wants his tits to swell up with milk and his belly to become round and stuffed with his alpha's child. He wants Castiel to breed him. These new desires should feel scary, but Dean's not afraid.
Dean’s face falls, “Look man, I’ve been patient...I really have, but you gotta tell me what’s goin’ on.” He glances down at Castiel’s lips for less than a nanosecond before finishing with, “Just talk to me.”
Dean strides back over to Castiel, stopping right in front of him. He bends down to kiss Castiel's chapped lips, chaste and lovingly. Whimpering, Castiel's eyes droop shut as he feels Dean cup both sides of his face. Dean places kiss after kiss onto him, slow and repetitive, no tongue, nothing dirty.
"My name is Castiel." As soon as the name escapes his lips, he's crushing them onto Dean's. Dean gasps and parts his lips, giving Castiel full access to his mouth. Castiel accepts entry and ravishes him, his mouth dominant and impatient. As they kiss, Dean repeats the man's name in his head over and over. It's beautiful and somehow exactly what he wanted to hear.
Castiel knows he must appear dazed, Sam has his serious worry face on, the one that’s reserved for real tragedies.
Dean's nights are long, but his days feel longer. During the day is when Dean and John sleep, there's no money to be made during the day. Every day at dawn is the same, Dean is expected to shower and join his father in the master bedroom.
The anguish that infects Dean's soul grows like cancer, rapid and incurable. Castiel wishes he could take the pain away, bring Sam back to him and make things right. But he can't, Castiel isn't the cure, he's just the chemo.
Castiel studies the hunter as if through foggy lenses. Head to toes, he can still see how unimaginably beautiful Dean is. Castiel hates being
Although unaware of any of the specifics, Sam and Dean are not going to let Castiel rot in the endless limbo of the universe. It’s so easy to put his faith in these men, to trust and believe them even when there’s no solid plan or a single issue has been solved. Because no matter what Castiel has done, whatever mess he’s wrapped up in, they’ll bring him back home.
"Right, sorry, please don't stop, Cas..." Dean babbles, removing his hand from the rumpled dark locks and gripping the steering wheel with unnecessary force.
“Maybe. There’s no way to know anything. Something completely different could still trigger it...or nothing at all. And it’s just that, now...I don’t want to risk it...I don’t want to die, Sam. It’s different than before...Jack needs me and...I’m quite content here with you all.”
John sent Sam away a few years back, barking about his younger son being an inconvenience. Of course, he told Sam something different, a bullshit story about the benefits of boarding school. Dean feels sick without his little brother. Sam is his everything. His absence is terrifying. Dean's all alone with these monsters.
Pulling away, Dean takes Castiel's hand and heads for the bed. Sharing a pillow, the two broken men face each other, their toes just barely touching. Castiel doesn't mind that the mattress is worn and uncomfortable, tonight it feels perfect. He doesn't even think to reach for the night stand, not requiring anything to aid himself into slumber tonight.
The storm brewing inside him is going to win. He considers leaving The Bunker, but it’s too late. Right on cue, a loud, booming yell of frustration escapes from the depths of his lungs. Inelegant and guttural, he
“Hey, you know that thing I asked if you wanna come with me before?” Dean chuckled soon after Cas raised his eyebrows in puzzlement. “Okay, you might have forgotten about it. Well, it was this event on this weekend, I think it’s on Saturday, I’ve got a ticket to an opening of an exhibition.”
The girl in the room set an innocent look on her face, but it was more like someone who just got caught doing something mischievous and tried to hide it.
might scared the poor man, unintentionally. A snap of horror filled Dean’s mind, what if Cas refused to talk to him again after this? What if that was their last chance on planning dinner, and he completely
At the smile beamed from the man sitting next to him, Dean felt both proud and jealous at the same time. How did the jealousy surfaced, he was still trying to understand, since it was Sammy, his
"Oh, hi, Rowena, how's the Dean Cave?" Dean chuckled, but it only lasted a few moments before he realised something. "How much did you hear from us?"
As he grew up, Castiel saw how his father would disappear from the house often in a long time. His mother would say that he went for inspiration, but ever since he was young, Castiel knew that the answer was just a sugarcoat. He hated that answer. He hated how his father would neglect his family for “inspiration”, without news or even asked how they were doing.
even! For his two years living there, Castiel still couldn’t get over at how spectacular the apartment is. It has its own loft for the bedding area; bed, a small study and wardrobe. On the main area there was an L-shaped sofa, facing the entertainment set, and a window that shows the view of the city, which includes sunrise every morning.
A long sigh came from Dean’s side of the line, letting Cas knew that the PE Teacher was bumping himself down to the bed. “I’ll be free the whole next weekend, Cas, your call.”
“Actually, yeah. I’ve got an early class tomorrow, at eight-thirty. What time is it no-oh, it’s almost midnight already?”
The morning where everything officially begins, from family activities to frustration with the freckled-faced man.
“Uh, it was the Oreo one, I think?” Dean replied while being trapped in an eye-contact with Gabriel, who still looked menacing to him. Most probably since Sam’s been looking over the doughnuts for the past fifteen minutes and hasn’t made any decision yet. Quietly, Dean took a look around the store. It was near empty, which actually made sense since it was still ten in the morning on a Sunday. “Come on, Sammy, we’re gonna be late.”
“Not the first time, Cas,” Dean answered with a smile, and Cas’ knee hit the ceiling of his desk. As Dean asked if Cas was alright, because the sound of the bump was quite violent, the dentist could only nod with a grin. “You made your lunch yourself, Cas?”
Dean noticed Jack's smile, then he continued, "The Empty told Cas that when Cas felt true happiness, it would come and claim him. Cas thought that he could never have his true happiness, that's why he kept the deal to himself, knowing that The Empty could never take him. Until he revealed it to me a few nights ago, when Billie was behind the Archive Room's door and ready to kill both of us."
“I do. I really do, I love the lights, I love this, I love y-” Cas caught his tongue. “I love your brilliant ideas. And this by far is one of the best. Thank you.”
Granted, Cas was indeed taller than his employer, but it still sounded odd. As for the cup… oh. There was something scrawled on the side that Cas hadn’t noticed before.
“Sorry,” Cas said sheepishly, stopping so that Dean could catch up. Even as a human (again), Cas still had some of his former strength, and intended to maintain it. Dean, not so much. After announcing his semi-retirement, he was more than happy letting some of the junk food show. With Sam and Eileen running the hunting circles now, it was easier for the eldest Winchester to relax a bit more. In Cas’ words, it made him more huggable, which was a big win.
The road trip to Charles Shurley's birthday began. Castiel and Charlie had an eye-opening talk about Castiel's little rendezvous at the pet park.
Dean took Cas' hand and took him to the shower, stark naked. They had another sex session under the shower.
Dean made sure that everything was back in order before he locked the hall and walked back to the teacher’s room to do some paper works on his students, while waiting for his next class.
In Eileen’s car, he saw Sammy pulled on the familiar sideways, in front of her apartment. Then Sam’s giant figure stepped out from the car and ran to the front door before he pressed the doorbell.
"Sit," Rowena intentionally cut Dean's words. Before the man could get a moment to take a deep breath and prepare himself, Rowena had spoken an incantation while pushing the device slowly into Dean's waist.
The blue-eyed man was still wondering what did that mean, when he heard Dean walked back to the kitchen, still talking to the phone.
Dean raised his voice to distract everyone in the room from Sam's story. Then he continued telling Cas of the plan they had to make him half-dying as a human, instead of a demon, because of what Billie said as well.
"Shut up," after he made a playful snap to Crowley, Dean turned to The Empty again. "Where did Billie go?"
Claire and Jack all by himself for the past seven years. And how they both still insisted on living with him after all these years. As he looked at his children now, Cas could understand how people thought that the two of them are twins.
Dean unconsciously nodded again at that information, “Got it. Oh, please let me know if you arrived home, okay?”
Working on Saturday night wasn't something new for Castiel. He enjoyed the quiet campus library, his colourful teammates, also ... the new librarian. Although it was all on different kinds of enjoying.
Dean lifted his face slowly to Castiel, and he could see that the blue eyes before him didn't look as bright as before. "Um, you keep saying that. Everything's good between you two?"
After lunch time, Gabriel went out to meet his client, the very reason he came to where Castiel lives. Claire went to read a book, while her youngest uncle watch the television, with Misha curling between them. It was a very relaxing day, the weather was good and Cas occasionally texted Dean, having a light conversation, until he fell asleep in front of the television.
“Good girl. Now, roll over,” once more Sam made Juliet obeyed his words, earning claps from Charlie. “She’s really adorable! Do you really have to return her to your friend, Cas?”
When he reached Rowena and Sam's table, he saw Sam was working on the spell, while Rowena was supervising. Dean smiled at the sight before him, and he approached the Queen.
“Thanks, Sammy,” he replied shortly. “I, uh, I'm probably gonna head up to the kitchen first. I’m hungry. You guys just go if you want to take a rest. It’s been a long day, a long week, for us.”
The look on Crowley’s face was equivalent as if Castiel just told him that he and Dean spent their night hunting cockroaches in his kitchen and peeling potatoes afterwards. “I honestly don’t know you anymore, Castiel,” he said as standing up and walked out from the room.
Gabriel let out a very irresponsible grin, "Cassie, you do realised that the building was full of tall
“How many hours did it need to finish?” Dean asked and read the packaging. It might slipped his own attention that his voice had gone softer when he addressed Cas this time. But it surely didn’t for Cas. “Do you remember what time we started  making  this, Cas?”
By the time Balthazar answered his question, Castiel was sure the colour of his face was completely different than when he arrived.
Castiel never used to talk back, especially when they fucked like this. But now life's just a game, so why not play along. "Yeah, Dean, fuck my ass, c'mon, harder!"
Dean Winchester, hardened and cold, but deep down still Dean. The hunter forced the life back into Castiel's broken body, along with the help of some makeshift 'doctors'. Tears running down his face, Dean roared in anger when Castiel reopened his unwilling eyes. He's not
The first words Dean says to him once he's fully sheathed inside, makes Castiel's entire body go weak. "We're gonna have a baby...Cas, love you..."
"Dean," he breathes, slowly coming back down to planet Earth. Once he carefully slips out, Castiel grabs one of Dean's worn out, grease stained t-shirts that he uses for the garage, from the back seat, wiping them both clean.
Sam changes gears and springs into action, “Well at least that gives us something to work with, there’s no specific pressure for time...we just gotta find a loop hole.”
Dean swallows a visible lump in his throat and scratches a fake itch at the back of his neck nervously. Stumbling far away from Castiel, Dean slings his arm around the boy, directing them to make their ascension and head for the door, “Told ya, that was a one time thing...”
Dean pauses, kissing Castiel's always slightly chapped lips chastely, hugging him closer, craving his warmth. "But I'd rather get fucked raw on the side of the road any day, who needs romance?" He chuckles, combing through Castiel's thick hair, further messing it up.
Castiel decides he'll call Mom and Dad tomorrow, tonight he's too drained to talk about the flight and work and when he's coming to visit. He also remembers that he has to try and find some time to plan this extravaganza of a double wedding anniversary party Gabriel wants. He'll call Sam tomorrow. Tonight he just wants to disappear inside Dean, hide away from the rest of the world.
Dean isn't patient, prepping Castiel hurriedly with spit and three meaty fingers. However, Castiel is into it, moaning and telling Dean he's ready when he's not.
"Can you come on my tongue, Dean?" The man asks, diving deeper until his tongue disappears completely.
Despite his sour mood, Castiel feels an indescribable warmth trickle down his spine every time he remembers that his son is safe. Because as miserable as he might be, Castiel regrets nothing. The decision to trade himself for Jack would play out the same way a thousand times over. He will always protect Jack.
Dean makes him crazy, like he'd agree to anything, and he's right, it's almost an hour drive to get back home. So apparently they're going to fuck now.
Overwhelming himself with silent thoughts of affection, Castiel decides he can't wait any longer, lunging down, he starts undoing Dean's belt buckle.
"No, we did this bullshit our whole lives and look what almost happened. I swore to myself that I'll never be that stupid again, if something is bothering one of us, we need to tell each other. I can tell you're upset, I've always been able to tell. Believe me, I know 'talking' is hard, so much easier to just...hold it all in. But we don't have to do that anymore, at least not with each other. Cas, your problems are mine, I chose that when I married you, and it's never been a chore. We're a team, let me help...let me in."
Castiel says, his voice full of sass. "It's one of the rare privileges that comes with being our fearless leader."
"Got your work cut out for you tonight," John begins, skipping coffee and going straight to beer. "Private room."
Dean moans when he feels Castiel's knot expanding, he's close. God, Dean's never wanted someone's come so bad, he wants Castiel to pump him full of it, so he can hoard every last drop. He never wants their bodies to disconnect.
“Cas, you’re not gonna die. We’ll figure it out...I promise.” Sam looks devastated as he reassures him, adding, “Jack’s not the only one who needs you.”
Dean hates to admit it, but he likes the feeling of cock in his mouth. It's numbing and calming in a way that no other activity provides. After more than half the movie, John begins to harden, yet Dean doesn't move a muscle.
Castiel leans back against the headboard and places his hands on Dean's waist, "Well, I hate when you drink cheap whiskey, messes with your...scent." He almost laughs when he says it, but it's too truthful. Castiel despises anything that masks Dean's aroma, especially something so harsh as alcohol.
Castiel looks up to find that Jack has joined them, his brow furrowed and he appears to be in minor distress. “Sam is going to take a shower now and he told me to ask you guys what we’re doing for dinner,” Jack announces.
John and Dean live and operate out of the house he grew up in. The memories of his beautiful mother and the fun they used to have fade a little more each day. She died shortly after Sam's eighth birthday, leaving the two boys alone with John and his bitterness. The stress of losing Mary may have been the initial catalyst for Dean presenting as an omega so early. Showing all the signs, John lost his mind. His brain diseased with with grief, John took Dean that very night, fucking his twelve year old son through the tears and shrieks for help. His once caring father succumbed to the evil within and began this whole downward spiral towards the unforgivable.
Time and time again, they’ve saved each other and it’s time to accept the truth. This family is all they have and there’s no stopping until the peace they’re so fiercely seeking shines brightly down upon them.
He has briefly considered the fact that nothing at all will happen, it could all be a sick bluff. There’s no guarantee that that
Dean's cock spurts triumphantly, painting his hand and lower abdomen white. The man growls when he feels Dean's walls contract around his tongue. Drinking up the juices from Dean's orgasm, the alpha seems content to taste him for eternity.
Castiel's a fool. He should send Dean away, make him drink water and go to sleep. But instead, he gets caught up in a blur of action as their clothes are discarded, all but that damn amulet. It should be disturbing, but Castiel is beyond that.
Settling in, Dean lays on his tummy and takes his father's flaccid dick into his mouth. He's allowed to keep the robe on for this part. Dean doesn't even care that this is the fourth time this week they're watching
Castiel collapses onto his side, hugging Dean's back to his front as close as he can. Dean is sore all over, his muscles and bones are in sort of a shock. The knob of his neck hurts the worst, but he's
, it never becomes mundane or routine. Making love to Dean is always a gift, one that, for most of his life, he never thought he would be lucky enough to have. The knowledge that Dean loves him as much as Castiel loves him back, is surreal, falling more in love with him each day, their bond only strengthening with time.
has the man pulling away from the sweetness of Dean's pussy. That skilled tongue cleaning up the glorious mess of Dean's come as he crawls up his body.
"Fucking nevermind, don't listen to me...definitely keep doing that...ugh, yeah, baby, just like that," Dean whines, swerving the car a little, unconsciously nestling one of his hands in Castiel's beautiful wind blown hair.
he exudes, stronger than any other alpha he's met. Like a good omega, Dean listens to him without question, continuing to rub and stroke his uncharacteristically hard prick. He distracts his free hand by curling it around the bed sheet. He doesn't want to touch the alpha without permission.
It hangs there in the silence, Dean soaking up what's been revealed to him. Dread is filling Castiel's insides, twisting his stomach into knots, petrified of Dean's response.
Tiptoeing around Dean like their sexual tension isn’t perpetually on the verge of snapping. Or as if they’re not always one dangerous sentence away from confessing a secret that’s been seasoned with ten years of denial and bandaids.
The fuzzy cushion of drug induced pleasantness that frequently surrounds his brain is fading fast. Castiel shifts uncomfortably, heaving one of the girls off his chest to reach for the nightstand.
"Hey, uh, I love you too, Cas..." Dean dares, biting his lip nervously and turning away from Castiel's gaze.
Dean squirms, eagerly trying impale himself on the cock that's teasing him. "Castiel," Dean never wants to stop saying it.
His behavior of late has been erratic and unsettling, constantly trying to hide the fact that he’s lying. Sam and Dean can of course tell something is wrong, but they’ve stayed silent for now. They’re gifting him with the time to come clean on his own and Castiel desperately wants to hold up his end of the unspoken bargain.
Dean feels the man's lips kiss and nip at his inner thigh, the spot of contact spreading an intense warmth throughout his entire body. Searing hot, the man's tongue swoops out of his mouth, licking up the slick on Dean's leg that's been generously dripping out of him.
Because unless Castiel wants to die instantaneously and spend eternity floating through nothingness, he has to keep his mouth shut. And for the first time in a very long time Castiel truly wants to
time. Within minutes, they annoyed me...telling me that I'm wasting my time in Kansas, if I want a real career I should move to the city. But it's all the unsaid things that really bother me. They don't like you, Dean. And it just...ugh it makes me wish I could...smite them!"
inside, even now, with this life. Then again, maybe John felt good at one point too, maybe this is Dean's future. Maybe the good inside him is actually just a mask and one day it'll crumble away. What if Dean ends up just like John and hurts Sammy?
He must have dozed off, because when he opens his eyes it's to an empty bed and the smell of something cooking. Castiel feels a little more normal, able to somewhat function again.
Castiel pretends to enjoy the moment, he pretends that his heart isn’t shredding itself into a million pieces as he smiles pathetically and waves goodbye.
"All yours, Cas, yeah," Dean responds as he simply lays there and takes it. He enjoys every thrust, every sharp snap of Castiel's hips, every sinful slap of skin. The unwavering pressure on his wrists feels so good. Thumping harmoniously, his pulse and circulation are deafening.
Castiel extracts his saturated fingers and lowers them to slide between Dean's crack. He circles around the tight rim, eventually dipping inside and causing Dean to moan.
The dust settles and Castiel’s hearing begins to return, the only reason he realizes this is because he wasn’t aware it had dulled in the first place. There’s footsteps, faint at first but soon they morph into long, clumsy strides that sound more like a run.
"Fuck, angel, take my cock so good..." Dean grunts, fucking him with long,  rough thrusts. Castiel abhors that particular pet name now, but he doesn't bother reminding Dean.
But right now, Dean's torn down his wall with so little effort, knowing his way around Castiel's head like an expert. And for some reason this is really important, he wants this baby, wants it like every nerve in his body screaming for it. That's why he can't bottle it all up anymore.
However, every time this circular argument makes a pass through his brain he eventually dismisses it. Because just imagining how Dean’s mouth would feel moving against his, millions of tiny kisses exploring each other until every surface of skin has been claimed is enough to convince Castiel otherwise. Or whenever he thinks about how Dean’s strong, work-worn hand would feel touching his cock, stroking him roughly yet still kissing him tenderly. Sometimes Castiel dares to dream even further, picturing the way Dean would look beneath him, how it would feel to be inside him.
Still sitting in Castiel's lap, Dean guides Castiel's fingers into his mouth, wetting them thoroughly with his warm saliva. Watching and feeling Dean suck on his fingers has Castiel hardening in no time.
It's Dean's voice, Castiel doesn't even have to bother looking. The girls stop gyrating immediately and Blondie sighs dramatically, doing nothing to hide her annoyance.
"This what you need Dean?" Castiel's voice is still sweet, purposely avoiding crossing the threshold of violence. "Want me to tell you that I love you?"
He doesn’t quite recall how or when his life became this, how every fiber of his being starting revolving around this little family he cherishes so much here on Earth. Heaven is often an after thought, a distant group of relatives he can barley remember being a part of. Longevity means nothing, blood means nothing, what truly matters is finding a place you belong. And Castiel belongs here with the Winchesters, not lost in the Empty. Not after everything that’s happened in the past decade.
anymore. It belongs to John, and John likes it naked. The emerald green robe is a treat, one that Dean clings to.
Castiel can’t decide if he’s immensely disappointed or relieved from this turn of events. Jack may have just saved his life.
The angel jumps slightly when he feels both of Dean’s welcoming palms cover over his own stress-ridden fists, caressing them like something precious. Dean coaxes Castiel’s knuckles open, his muscles unable to resist the soothing sensation. Castiel’s breath hitches when Dean twines their fingers together and moves so close that their noses bump. Dean slowly ebbs away the pain and suffering that’s been steadily corrupting Castiel, their unique bond working in overdrive to heal him.
Releasing the death grip on one of Dean's thighs, the alpha nestles his hand into Dean's own, the one that's been violently ripping at the sheets. Dean doesn't understand what the fuck is happening, because holding hands has never made him come before. Euphoria takes him over, the world feels pure.
Eyesight still shrouded in darkness, Dean's other senses feel more alive. He mewls weakly when he feels one of the man's hands comb lovingly through his hair, the other hand still locked in Dean's own. He shudders from the heat radiating off the alpha's cock, mere inches away from his hole. The sloppy, open mouthed kisses being trailed along Dean's neck have him quivering. He's ready to do
Dean hums and drools when Castiel aids him in bobbing his head up and down. Castiel should feel guilty, he should cringe at the desperate, messy way Dean is throwing himself at him. But he can't feel that anymore, all he can feel is Dean, here and now, pleasuring him with every ounce of effort he has left. It's so easy to forget, to
Castiel used to ask Dean to stay, beg even, but on nights like these, Castiel has learned it's a futile attempt.
properly, like he's just now taking the first true breath of life. And it feels as if Dean's always known this man, he's familiar, he's home.
Dean's hole is wet and ready, a little excess slick dripping out of him before John plunges inside. It's all mindless rutting and routine dirty talk from there. Dean's little cock doesn't even get hard anymore.
Castiel rises and replies automatically, “Dean.” His nerves are absolutely flayed and hands are discretely curling into fists as he tries to hold his composure together.
Dean doesn't even flinch at the name anymore, he simply hurries up and throws on his robe. Dean loves this robe. It's so soft and fluffy and only worn when he's clean. It's the only remaining clothing he owns, there no need for anything else. He doesn't leave the house and his body isn't
Wet is an understatement, Dean knows the bed beneath him is getting soaked. "Oh, fuck, Alpha, fuck!" Dean babbles, his hole greedy for more.
Kicking some books out of the way, Sam shoves himself into the chaos of the room and sits down beside him.
Dean says it like a prayer of encouragement, willing Castiel to trust him, to understand that he won't judge him or be upset, that he loves him unconditionally.
An understanding is finally dawning on Castiel. Or maybe it’s simply an exhilarating rush of confidence, whatever it is, it doesn’t matter.
"There you are. I don't like to be kept waiting, Dean..." his voice is lighthearted. John's not angry tonight. He's not even drunk. Dean secretly wishes he was either, that way he could blame his father's sick urges on something other than pure want and desire. Sober John is dangerous, it's never quick, it's never easy.
Castiel grins as he momentarily pulls his mouth off Dean's cock with loud pop, "The least you could do is keep both hands on the wheel, it'll definitely increase our chances of survival--"
Dean lays next to him quietly, watching Castiel. When Castiel turns to face him, he can't see straight or focus. He desperately wants to cry like a child, because more than anything in the world he wishes he could be unhigh for a moment, he needs Dean's
His patience is all out. Castiel rockets forward, landing Dean on his back. Castiel begins fucking him with vigor, hard and fast, but precise.
Castiel wants to tell him that they can never make love again. That whatever they end up doing tonight would
Castiel pets him, mindlessly grounding himself the only way he knows how. He randomly thinks Dean needs a hair cut, the short bristles much longer than usual. Castiel realizes he likes it a little bit longer, his fingers naturally curling closed to grab a decent sized chunk.
"Dean, come," Castiel says automatically as he hastily snatches up a joint and lighter from the top drawer.
It used to be a choice, a stupid and stubborn choice not to tell Dean the truth about how he feels. The fear of rejection used to be horrifying enough, but now Castiel realizes the
Within the next eight minutes Dean parks the Impala in an empty parking lot behind an old abandoned building, neither of them caring enough to bother finding out what exactly. Dean is putty in Castiel's arms as he grabs him, tugs his jeans and underwear down, preparing him quickly, yet still gentle. Castiel uses his tongue and fingers to spread him open against the side of their beloved car, until Dean's begging, quite loudly, to be fucked.
Castiel is smiling smugly as he sits up and stares at Dean, the blankets rumpled so his naked body isn't covered in the slightest. Dean doesn't even glance at his cock, determined to hold Castiel's eye contact.
He almost had to watch Dean die today. Useless, Castiel would not have been able to heal him, or bring him back. All the ex-angel has now is a gun, a meaningless defense compared to his Grace.
No more conversation is necessary, Dean knows what to do. He's never disappointed a single client yet.
Sporting puffy eyes and quivery lips, Dean whispers, "I hate when you smoke, messes with your eyes."
"Fuck you, Winchester," Red spits, extracting herself from Castiel as she gathers up her clothes from the floor.
Castiel ghosts his fingertips over the small piece of brass, throwing Dean a sad look. Dean is struggling visibly, like he doesn't know how to ask for what he wants.
“I’m sorry I ruined your shower,” Castiel sighs dramatically, giving Sam a half apologetic half kidding look.
Castiel takes pity, closing his hand around Dean's aching length, stroking him evenly. "Come, Dean."
That he's a coward and can't deal with the severity of things to come. But denying Dean has never been one of strong suits, so without argument, Castiel stows the drugs back into the drawer.
Dean's nostalgic fondness for this place has warped into something ugly, twisted. He hates being here now. The family photos have been ripped from the wall, replaced with dart boards and lewd artwork. The fridge is stocked with alcohol and leftover takeout, long gone are the yummy snacks and home cooked meals. Worst of all has to be the stench of sex and cigarettes imbedded in the carpets and upholstery, not a trace of his mother's loving scent remains.
They're kissing again, more frantic than before, already naked and prepared, Castiel falls back onto the soft mattress, pulling Dean on top of him. "Want you," he whispers, spreading his legs, urging Dean to take him.
Although his speed is picking up and his pleasure is becoming obvious, Dean's still not looking at Castiel. Castiel grows frustrated and grips onto Dean's hips, helping him along, thrusting upwards every time Dean slams down.
The door bursts open loudly and although Castiel's reaction speed is somewhat poor, he knows who it is. Nobody else seeks him out past midnight.
Suddenly, Castiel is beyond turned on again, his libido has no sign of age when it comes to Dean. He's ready to make love again, ready for Dean to crawl inside him.
“How long do you have?” Sam asks methodically, tucking a section of drenched hair behind his ears and wiping away some glistening water droplets leftover on his face and neck.
It’s the most painfully awkward conclusion that Castiel has ever heard, but it’s accurate all the same.
Dean just moans in response, an answer Castiel expected. "Well, I do, Dean. I love you more than anyone's ever loved anything...look at me."
Dean scoots closer, wrapping Castiel snugly inside his arms, chest to chest. His leg hooks possessively around Castiel's hip, bringing them even closer. Castiel tucks his face into the crevice of Dean's neck, sniffing him unashamedly. Dean smells amazing as always, even unshowered and covered in grime. The intimacy from being joined like this will never compare to having sex, Castiel would pick this every time.
Sam takes in the state of the bedroom, his worry turning to sadness like the latter never occurred. “What happened?”
Dean is crowding him and Castiel feels ridiculously like his heart is ricocheting violently around the walls of his rib cage. Dean has this way of wiggling into every crevice of Castiel’s core, his presence so large, so important Castiel is drawn to him like an addict.
Dean's breathing is irregular, failing to hold it together as Castiel consumes him, starting to pant nonsense when they reach their first stop light.
Hours later, they've done everything on Dean's list of welcoming Castiel home: eating homemade cheeseburgers over candlelight, Castiel feverishly riding Dean's cock on the couch because they couldn't make it all the way to the bedroom, before finally indulging in a relaxing shower together. Laying in bed, Castiel's head rests on Dean's bare chest, the lamp on the night stand is still on, and the television is playing some cheesy show about ghost hunters, but neither man is watching it.
“Who said anything about in love?” Castiel didn’t mean it, but his asking came out as a whiny protest.
Cas had forgotten about the chill on his body as he lined off the call. He walked in and snuggled into his blanket, earning a nosy nudge from his big brother who was channel-surfing next to him before he came inside.
about ‘my boyfriend’?” Castiel felt his palms were sweaty and hurted, apparently he was holding the steering wheel too tight. But, he never expected that his niece would know about him this soon, and it caught him a bit off guard.
He watched Dean walked without looking and reflexively grabbed his arm to stopped him when they were about to cross the road.
“My older brother gave this to me before I went to England for my studies,” Castiel quickly added when he saw the look on Dean’s face changed a bit. This time he could swear there was a relief on the other man’s face after he explained.
It was the voice that Cas missed, he turned around and saw the young man of the house come from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hand.
Eileen looked at Dean, as if he just suddenly changed his eye colour, "You have a thing to make people, even your former enemies, fond of you, Dean."
. Of course, this would later lead them to discover what almost all teenagers of their age were curious about, sexualities. High school was the time for them to explore and try, then when they entered uni, it was all hells break loose.
“It was a place where angels and demons go after they die. I’m planning to cross there and take Cas back.”
Bobby and Ellen, for always being there for him, even during his lowest state. They might not be the perfect people to be parents-substitutes, but they’re the best that Dean ever had, even with them raised him in their own ways. He also now had another younger sibling, Jo, Ellen’s daughter who currently studied Visual Arts in Ohio. Growing up with Bobby and Ellen had given Dean quite an influence on living. He saw how Bobby fixes car in his spare time of being a police officer and how Ellen used to manage a diner in the area. They both had given quite an impression to Dean growing up, that right after he finished uni, Dean knew he wanted to have his own bar to manage.
