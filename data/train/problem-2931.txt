The rest went quickly; Sam and Jack returned a few moments later to say everything was ready, and they all loaded up their arms with food and drinks to carry it outside and set up a build-your-own-burrito bar out behind the bunker. Dean brought out a radio, and while he fidgeted with the dials, Sam disappeared back inside, then returned a few minutes later wearing a wide grin and toting a frisbee.
“We should get back,” Castiel agreed softly. He reached for his clothes and grimaced. “They’re not dry.”
Dean rolled his eyes and reached for his glass, and Castiel did the same. Sam spoke again before anyone could drink. “Hey, uhh…” he started. He sniffed when he saw the three watching him curiously, then lifted his glass and leaned back. “Congratulations, guys,” he said gently, looking first at Castiel, then at his brother. His gaze lingered there seriously, but he cracked a smile when he continued. “It’s about damn time.”
“Give you something to think about,” said Dean, grinning wolfishly. “Y’know, for later.” He dried himself off quickly, rubbed the towel over his hair, and then tossed it to Castiel, who barely caught it. “Sammy’s gonna wonder, so I’ll meet you out there?”
Carefully, he moved the tone arm down and set the needle on the record, toward the center instead of the start, and a bluesy, slow, familiar rhythm picked up. He looked over his shoulder at Castiel, whose eyes had flown open to stare at the ceiling. “You recognize it?”
“So—art? Music? Literature? Tell me, Michael: Have you ever known a fish to write poetry?” Castiel pressed, his anger bubbling. “Humans, they’re—they’re miracles! Little gods, little creators in themselves—”
to. Dean passed out a little before ten AM, shortly after cleaning up from their “miracle,” and Castiel craved nothing more than to be able to join him in his dreaming. He didn’t miss that much about being human, but dreams—those were strange, wondrous things. Holy things. He wondered what Dean might be dreaming of, and what his own dreams might look like after the morning they’d had. Castiel was briefly tempted to reach into Dean’s mind and watch, but he’d done enough of that lately, and besides—he promised, long ago, not to read Dean’s thoughts without permission, and dreams were a certain kind of thought.
“Of course I’m not!” yelled Dean. He grabbed the front of Castiel’s shirt on instinct, but released it almost instantly, taking a step back, eyes widening.
Castiel reached out and took one of Dean’s hands. “A honeymoon,” said Castiel, lips pursing as he began to draw Dean forward down the rose-strewn path. “Sort of.”
Castiel exhaled slowly and leaned his forehead back against Dean’s, closing his eyes. “Just feels too good to be true.”
“Well, it’s like a devastatingly handsome temporary human once told me,” said Dean, smirking. “You deserve good things.”
Impossibly fast, Dean found himself breathless on his back in the grass, Cas hovering above him, head tilted. Dean’s arms were triangled above his head, Cas holding his wrists. After a few moments of intense staring, Cas gave a satisfied smile and ducked down to snag a kiss from Dean’s stunned, parted lips. “I suppose this was you letting me win?” he asked as he pulled away, sliding his hands up to link fingers with Dean.
or my giving mood will disappear,” Rowena snapped, digging through her bag. Dean watched in silence as she pulled out a small stone bowl and various vials of oils and dried plants. She measured them in drops and pinches into the bowl, then set a pestle inside, and quickly reached for a pen, then grabbed Dean’s hand, scribbling something on his palm. “Find something of Castiel’s—a hair, an eyelash, something he’s touched—place it in the bowl, and use the pestle to grind it to a powder. When you’re ready, repeat this phrase thrice, and light the contents on fire.”
“Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away. For the winter is past, the rain is over and gone,” Castiel repeated in English.
“Yeah. Whatever you want. Well—kind of,” said Dean. “I was trying to remember what you liked from last time, so it’s pretty much burgers or burritos. We can do one now, the other for dinner.”
Castiel, upon the contact, lifted his chin and narrowed his eyes in defiance, jaw set. It was a look Dean hadn’t seen—not directed at him, anyway—in years. The last time he saw it, Castiel had called him “Boy,” and he was reminded suddenly that Castiel, childlike though he could be, was very old and built with power, a soldier of Heaven who spent most of his long existence commanding legions—archangel grace or not. A hot blue anger flashed behind the angel’s eyes, and Dean recognized it—not as Michael’s grace, but Castiel’s.
“Damnit, Cas! We ran out of options!” Dean snapped, hurling the empty skins of his fruit over the cliff. Castiel and Sam stared at him in silence, and he balled his fists into his jeans until his knuckles turned white. His teeth felt like they’d crack from the pressure of his clenching jaw. After a long minute of silence, he spoke again, words tense. “We didn’t have a choice,” he said slowly. “You were gone, and we had to make a decision, or you were going to stay gone. Because we could take you home right now, but that would only solve half the problem. We’d still have to deal with Michael, and you know he’d be back. He’d never quit. And he never will unless—”
Sam and Jack were putting away the last of the groceries when Dean and Castiel walked into the kitchen, and Dean didn’t bother releasing Castiel’s hand. Sam noticed, and smiled, but didn’t tease and—mercifully—kept Jack distracted until Dean and Castiel thought better of it and hesitantly let each other go. Neither were in the mood to field questions from the kid. Especially questions they didn’t quite yet have the answers to themselves.
“It’s good to see you again, Claire,” said Castiel, smiling, but cautious. Things with Claire had improved, but she still needed distance from the body of her father inhabited by someone else.
be, so on the walk back to his room, Dean focused hard on believing Cas should be in there and not the kitchen. If he opened his door and found the angel, he’d have definite confirmation that this was all some kind of messed up dream. If not, well. Square one.
Castiel stood in the road, lips pressed, and watched the taillights disappear. After a minute, he crossed back to the right side and tugged the earbuds from his phone. He stuffed them in his pocket and pressed Dean’s name on speed-dial. Castiel smirked to himself, darkly, when it went straight to voicemail. Dean had already turned off his phone. He thumbed out a text to Sam and then pocketed his phone once more. He jogged the rest of the way home in silence.
Slowly, the dark mirror began to shimmer like black silk in liquid ink. A face, pale as death and twice as horrible, appeared in the center. It was that of an impossibly old man, the skin stretched gaunt over bones just inhuman enough to be unsettling, and whiter than chalk. Wisps of smoke curled away from his temples like hair, or the ghosts of horns, and where there should have been lips there were only teeth. His nose was almost not a nose—more nostrils slit snakelike into the center of his face—and there were no eyes to speak of, only empty sockets of unending black, but despite that Dean had the distinct feeling Belial was looking deep into his soul.
“Because I like holding your hand too!” Dean yelled, taking a step closer to Castiel. Almost instantly, he realized what he said, his anger falling off sharply into fear. Immediately, he retreated, backstepping until he bumped into the table.
Reluctantly, heavily, Castiel dragged himself to a seat and then took Dean’s hand, staggering forward. Within two steps he was gagging and pressing his hand to his mouth, swaying in Dean’s grip, and Dean mumbled under his breath and tried to shuffle faster. He barely got Castiel to the bathroom and got him on his knees in front of the toilet before the contents of Castiel’s stomach made their appearance.
Dean blinked at him and Castiel narrowed his eyes. “Okay, alright, chill. What’s—oh.” Dean pressed his lips into a line and his face went pale. “Sorry, Sam.”
Dean dropped his hand to his lap and looked back up to watch Jack and Castiel, and after a moment, let out a long sigh. He settled into his chair and pinched the bridge of his nose, snagging his beer with his free hand. “How long you think it’s gonna be before that stops happening every time I’m happy?”
In the center of the room was Dean—barefoot in jeans and a t-shirt, and he was clinging to another man dressed just the same—another Castiel. A dream Castiel. They were pulled close, chest to chest. Dean had his arm around the dream Cas’s waist, hand on the small of his back, and dream Cas had his hand curled around the back of Dean’s neck. Their foreheads were pressed together, and their other hands were linked and held lazily out to the side. Castiel stared for a solid minute before it occurred to him they were dancing. He watched, unable to even blink, as Dean and dream Cas swayed and rotated slowly, barely moving, eyes closed.
Castiel watched, eyes wide and lust-blown, jaw slack as Dean stepped out of the shower and wrapped himself in a towel. “Why’d you do that?” he said, almost breathless as he turned off the water.
The bunker door swung open and Dean and Castiel trudged heavily down the stairs, both shivering, and Sam smirked from his place at the table below.
Jack looked from Dean’s already bruising jaw down to his bloody knuckles, then up at Sam. His voice hitched higher when he asked, afraid, “Where’s Cas?”
“I was wrong?” said Castiel. His gut twisted, and for the moment, it had nothing to do with the grace.
It was like looking into a smudged mirror of the past: a dark room, a ring of fire, desperate voices bouncing off the walls. Only the roles were wrong. Inside the circle this time stood not Castiel, but Dean Winchester, illuminated by burning holy oil—and it was Castiel, not Dean, who was begging at the outer rim of the flames. Not far behind him was Jack instead of Crowley, and Sam—the only constant.
Dean blinked open his eyes and looked at Castiel, who nodded, and Dean finally laid back, resting his hands on Castiel’s thighs.
Castiel grinned. “Yes, I can get you television,” he answered, and his smile faded back into his trademark serious half-frown. “But I was hoping we could talk.”
“Okay, let’s do it,” said Dean. He leaned forward to steal another quick kiss before scooting off the bed.
“CAS!” Dean screamed, reaching out, but the light surged and cut Castiel off, and Dean’s fist closed around thin air. “NO!” Dean pounded his fist into the ground where his lover had been moments before. “No, no, no, no, NO!”
When Sam and Dean manage to subdue the evil archangel that’s wearing Castiel’s body, and he gets to come out for a moment, gets to hear the way Dean so desperately says his name.
“Heaven on Earth.” Michael shrugged. “Obviously, it didn’t. The wars continued. I wanted to restore it, as foretold—wipe away the scourge of humanity that ruined it. Castiel wanted to wipe away humanity and burn down everything our father created out of revenge.”
“Don’t freak out,” said Sam, wary. He unhooked the last manacle and Dean sat up, rubbing his wrists.
They finished eating, and while Dean sealed up all the food and stacked the dishes, Sam dragged Jack and Castiel out into the little space of open grass just before the tree line to give frisbee instructions. Dean toted everything inside but the cooler and the radio, which he turned up when he got back outside. He seated himself and leaned back comfortably, reaching into the cooler for another beer. The lid slapped heavily closed, and Sam turned his head that way, then handed the frisbee to Jack and slapped him on the shoulder. He loped over to Dean and relaxed into the chair beside him.
“I like that,” said Castiel. He clinked the rim of his glass against Dean’s. “To us, and free will. Which I think, in truth, are one and the same.”
Sam glanced up at the afternoon sky. “Just after sundown,” he said. “Something tells me Belial doesn’t like the light.”
Castiel lifted his chin in question, and Dean gripped Castiel’s arm, squeezed it hard in answer, smiled. Castiel smiled back and rocked his hips forward once, slowly, then pulled out even slower. He groaned as he picked up a slow rhythm, rolling smoothly in and out of Dean, who arched and moaned beneath him, wrapped his legs around Castiel’s back. Dean braced himself with a hand on the door behind him, head thrown back against the seat, eyes closed, mouth open. “You won’t break me,” he whispered brokenly to Castiel when he felt the almost-angels arms shaking with restraint, and Castiel growled, thrusting harder, faster. A loud sound of pleasure rolled from Dean’s chest, and Castiel growled, pressed a hand to the window. Dean let one foot slip to the floor for leverage and lifted his hips, and Castiel bucked harder, took Dean’s erection into his hand and began to pump with the rhythm.
Dean huffed a little laugh. “Somethin’ like that,” he said, and dug out an age-stained notepad and an old fountain pen. The letterhead on the notepad was dated 1958. Dean cringed a little at the date and sucked on the pen to get the ink going, then crossed it out and wrote,
“Or,” said Sam, interjecting, “We take you to Michael and leave you both free, but sealed off in another universe, and we destroy your way out.”
“So,” said Castiel. He pushed his palms down the front of his pants—not his dress pants, but a pair of Dean’s jeans. “Michael’s grace is gone now,” he said quietly, gaze level with Dean’s. “Or—not completely gone. But low enough that it’s useless and will be gone within the day.”
“Yes ma’am,” said Dean. He scooped up the bowl and held it protectively to his chest, setting off down the hall for his room.
“Yes. I mean—no, not technically—I mean—” Dean tumbled over the words, brows knitting. “I know I never said it. But that doesn’t mean I don’t.” Finally, he looked back up to Castiel, and his green eyes were wet and rimmed in red. “I do, Cas.”
Castiel tensed his arms around Dean, somehow tighter, and he almost worried that it was too much. But Dean didn’t express pain, so he let himself hold his beloved too tensely, gave into the need of it. “What makes you think I’m okay?” He whispered into Dean’s hair.
“I don’t think they’re mutually exclusive,” answered Dean, still grinning, though he looked down awkwardly at his messy, naked form.
Claire rolled her eyes, though they lingered curiously on Castiel’s blood-splattered body as she answered, “Yeah, well, they let out early today.” She tapped her phone, then turned it to face Dean and Cas, a breaking news article pulled up on the screen. “Another body dropped. The starting quarterback’s mom. So if you two are done with your lover’s quarrel, we should call Sam.”
The light pulsed, and the archangel and former angel began to fade. “Dean!” Castiel found the strength to call out, voice strained with hurt. “I love—”
“Sorry to break it to you, Michael, but you’re not wearing me to the prom again,” Dean growled, stopping an arm’s length from the archangel. Dean sucked on his teeth for a moment, considering, and then said simply, “We can still dance though.”
“Dad’s dead,” he said softly to himself, scanning the room. “His journal’s in that drawer.” He walked over and tugged it open and, finding the journal, let out a sigh of relief. He closed it and pinched the bridge of his nose, shaking his head. Dean stood like this for a few moments, steadying his breath, and finally lowered his hand. When he opened his eyes, his blood went cold again. He stared at the small pile of vinyls on the dresser, the sleeve on top with a man sitting in a bar, the record player beside them.
“I swallowed half of Michael’s grace,” said Castiel, glancing over. The song ended again and started on a much more upbeat track, and he didn’t move to change it, but Dean did, turning the tape off entirely and plunging the car into silence.
“I—hurt,” said Jack with a groan, and he sat up slowly as Castiel took a step back. “And I’m hungry. Really hungry.”
“Right, then,” said Rowena. She picked up the blade again and closed her eyes, hovering her palm and the knife over the goblet. “Lirach Tasa Vefa Wehlic, Belial,” she said softly. Then once more, with more force: Lirach Tasa Vefa Wehlic, Belial. She repeated it twice more, each one louder than the last, and when she repeated Belial’s name for the fourth and final time, the candle flames roared high, bouncing off the black of the scrying mirror and lighting up the room.
Castiel ran his hands up Dean’s chest, then his arms, pinning his hands above his head. He kissed him deeply, thoroughly, until neither of them could breathe. He leaned up to look down at Dean, catching green eyes with his blue, and when Dean gave the slightest of nods, he released his hands to tug at the hem of his own shirt. Castiel rid himself of it quickly, then worked Dean’s off easily as well. Beneath him, Dean squirmed, toeing off his boots, and Castiel sat back to do the same with his sneakers.
“Don’t you think I’d have used that already if I did?” she answered. “The book’s warded against that sort of thing. But when it was written there weren’t copiers or cameras.”
“Because one of the parents was a teacher, and I already sent in fake documents saying I could be a substitute,” said Sam.
Castiel stepped around the island and smiled. “I know,” he said again. “We talked about this a little, actually. If you remember, right before…” Castiel trailed off and shook his head, a faraway look shadowing his features.
“It…I thought we might be able to use it,” said Dean, protesting. “To save Cas! To barter him back.”
“Want you to do whatever you want,” Dean answered softly, his back arching just slightly as Castiel’s fingers dragged up his side.
“Yes, we’re selfish. Because we love,” he said. “It’s not an excuse. Just the truth. Now…” He turned to look at Sam and Rowena. “We need a plan.”
“You really do, kid,” said Dean, lifting his glass as well. He took a long swig—nearly all of it—then cleared his throat. “Alright, we’ve had the chick flick moment. Can we just drink now and be normal?”
Michael continued to smirk. He folded his arms across his chest. “Oops,” he said, unapologetic. “Did I ruffle your feathers?”
“Now,” said Rowena, ignoring Dean’s protest. “You’ll feel it instantly but have about a minute to get where you’re going. So I suggest you hustle.”
“We—she’s across the country with Bobby,” said Sam with a grunt. “We wanted to leave her out of this until—”
Dean turned over his shoulder to rake his gaze over the mess he’d made of his room, then back to the shelf, and back to his room. Nothing was there that didn’t belong—save the record player—but something was missing that should have been there—something bigger than cassette tapes—and he kicked himself for only just now realizing it. He stood and moved quickly through the obstacle course of belongings to his door.
“How old are you?” Dean scoffed, making a face at his brother. He pushed open the door with a foot and ticked his head to motion Sam inside.
Castiel hesitated, though when Dean said his name, he answered carefully, “I didn’t think you’d ever want that. Not with me. If I hadn’t, I don’t think we’d be here now.”
Sam smirked. “Yeah. The Seal of Solomon. We think that’s what Michael has, and what he used to skip worlds.”
“Yeah, well, I ain’t a role model,” Dean scoffed, and then settled. “C’mon, man. I don’t want to fight with you. Not right now. Not anymore.”
An uncommonly large smile split Castiel’s lips, and his face lit up and turned red at the same time. “Thank you, Sam,” he said. “And thank you for all of your encouragement. I know I can—that Dean and I can both be, as he’d say, a couple of dumbasses.”
“You stay where you are and we find another way to deal with Michael,” said Dean, trying to conceal the panic rising in his throat.
A blinding blue light flashed out from Castiel’s body like a bomb, illuminating everything. That same light poured from his eyes and mouth—the tips of his fingers. Behind him, the shadow of his wings, though still broken, spread wider than they ever had before.
Castiel shuddered out a heavy sigh and leaned his forehead down to press against the table. He squeezed his eyes shut and in the dark, grace buzzed and flickered across the backs of his eyelids like heat lightning in a summer sky. He let out a low, pained groan and took deep breaths to steady himself. A moment later, a hand landed on his shoulder. Castiel sat up stiffly to find Jack staring at him with a chaotic kind of anxiety.
Castiel sat up after a moment as well, tugged up his sweatpants. “I know. I’m sorry. I wish I knew how to help.”
They drove the first twenty or so minutes in a blissful silence, Dean taking in the feeling of Castiel’s warm hand in his, Castiel taking in the countryside as if seeing it through brand new eyes. When they hit the Nebraska state line around the half-hour mark, Castiel started peppering Dean with questions about humans—specifically, why they felt the need to carve up the Earth with arbitrary borders and invisible lines, and why those lines created identities. Dean didn’t have any good answers, but he tried: “Because we’re selfish.” “Because we like things that bind us together.” “Because we like things that keep us apart.” It was a shame, Castiel said, that people couldn’t see difference as a thing of wonder and beauty, and Dean agreed.
She lifted her hands and spoke another word, softly, before directing her fingers to Castiel. The smoke curled itself into a ball and hovered just beyond her fingertips, and she walked it slowly over to hover above Castiel. “When I say, breathe this in, deeply as you can. It isn’t going to be comfortable. Aye?”
Jack strode across the room and passed it off, and while Dean kept Castiel above water Sam carefully worked the thermometer beneath his tongue.
“Ten minutes might as well be ten hours,” grumbled Dean, slamming down the mug in front of Sam so hard some coffee sloshed onto the table.
“It ain’t for the taste,” said Dean with a smirk. Castiel gave him a side-eye and he shrugged, downing the rest of his glass. “Alright,” he said again, reaching for the bottle. “Who’s up for round two?”
“Means an hour ‘n a half here is ‘bout six there,” said Sam around a bite of pancake, chasing it with coffee. “Mean’s ten minutes is—”
"You're here," answered Castiel. He pulled back enough to look Dean at and smile. Dean pushed his hand into Castiel's hair and kissed him so hard, so painfully, he saw stars behind his eyes.
But sunset came on more swiftly than any of them would have liked, and before long they made their way back to camp to begin setting up for the ritual. Sam put together Belial’s summoning space while Dean worked on Michael’s, and Castiel paced between the two, helping where he was needed, correcting their Enochian.
This one's a little longer and more of a logistics chapter, but I promise there's a bomb-ass fight & some sweet, sweet angst coming soon!
he wants are his problem. Not yours. I know you’re worried about your brother, but he’ll be alright. And whatever happens between he and I, I’m not going anywhere. Alright? Like you said, we’re family.”
Castiel smiled to himself as he walked by the woods, flanked by his bickering family for the first time in what felt like years, and for a moment, the trails of the evening were forgotten to the sounds of home.
Dean lost himself to Castiel’s passion, reciprocating it in turn. He pushed his hands into the angel’s hair, bruising his lips against Castiel’s, whose mouth opened for him, his breath becoming Dean’s breath. One hand loosed itself from Castiel’s hair to move down to the waistband of Castiel’s jeans, and in a moment, the angel’s hands were there too, pushing his clothes quickly to the blanket, and then they both dropped down in a tangle of limbs, Castiel half-straddling Dean.
Jack nodded and sucked on his finger, embarrassed. Sam smirked and moved to corral him out. “You guys good?”
Once the three were out in the hallway, Sam began, “Are you sure he’s—” but Dean cut him off, shaking his head and holding a finger to his lips. He pointed two fingers down the hall, toward the kitchen, and Sam nodded, the three of them setting off.
Without warning, Castiel’s hand was in Dean’s hair, his lips claiming Dean’s in a soft, but somehow burning kiss. His other arm snaked beneath Dean’s back and Castiel rolled so that he was on top of him, and the kiss turned breathy and bruising. It sent sparks shooting through Dean’s blood, and when he recovered from the shock, he slid a hand up Castiel’s back beneath his shirt, gripping skin with fingertips, gasping into the kiss.
The woman Cas had been talking to laughed and said, “My Blake’s the same way. Good to meet you both—you make such a lovely couple.”
“Cas, don’t listen to him! It’s a trick! You know it’s a trick,” called Sam, and suddenly there was a hand on his shoulder, pulling him back from the fire. “You know he’s just trying to get under your skin. Don’t let him.”
They stared at one another as they had so many times before, and Dean shook his head. “Why’re you so good to me? After everything I’ve done to you?”
“Yeah,” agreed Sam. He looked away from Dean and back to Jack and Castiel, then laughed. “Look at this,” he said.
“Is it so hard to believe that I’ve grown fond of you boys?” she trilled, and then shrugged when Sam lifted an incredulous brow. “Well, I did mean that. You’re alright for
Castiel disappeared again in a quiet woosh, and this time, the cold waft of air made Dean shiver. He blinked at the sudden emptiness and shook his head to clear it, then glanced over his shoulder. A small window at the top of the garage was still black against the stone—still hours to go until sunrise, or at least he figured. Time felt different lately; it had always felt borrowed, the hunting life being what it was, but now it felt more tenuous. Precious, because now he had more to lose, but it wasn’t just that. Time itself felt as if it was moving in a new way, and in some sense, it literally was. The last week or so for Dean had been months for Castiel, and he found himself not only angry about that lost time, but jealous, and yet strangely thankful that he was on the “weeks” side of missing Castiel.
The angel sat on the other end of the couch, and Dean was struck by the existence of his body, still in the borrowed t-shirt and jeans—he was so unused to seeing the angel without layers of ill-fitting clothes. And coupled with the piercing blue eyes leveled on his, Dean almost lost his nerve.
“I want to see you like this from every angle,” Castiel whispered, now gazing up instead of down at Dean. He slipped his hands beneath Dean’s thighs and lifted him effortlessly up, then slowly slid him back down, Dean shuddering out a moan.
Sam huffed, but conceded. “Belial is, according to this, a ‘Demon Prince,’” he began. “Or, what we know as a Prince of Hell.”
Dean wasn’t really Dean—more like a projection of himself, a thought that contained no flesh or blood—but even still his face seemed to pale. He stared at Castiel, expression somehow soft and horrified at the same time. “What?” he finally croaked out, bewildered.
The record player stared back, indifferent. Dean looked for a few more seconds, then let out a loud roar of agony and anger. He reached for the record player and grabbed it by its sides to yank it from the desk. The lights flickered as the strain on the cord shifted the plug until it came loose, and Dean hurled the whole thing at the opposite wall. It slammed into the cinderblock with a loud, hard crash, then hit the floor with a smack. Dean rounded on it and slid to his knees before the broken player, then roared again as he began punching the largest pieces still intact, over and over and over. Broken plastic sliced into his knuckles. He didn’t relent. When a large piece lodged itself between his middle and pointer finger, he ceased his punching and picked up another chunk, hurling it at the wall beside the door which, a half second later, swung open so hard it smacked into the wall.
Castiel was leaning back in his chair, bare feet propped on the table as he drank out of the coffee pot and skimmed a book with the other hand, when Sam shuffled past at nearly four-thirty. Half a second later he appeared in the doorway again, staring at Cas in confusion.
“I did,” agreed Cas. “But I know you, Dean. I don’t need to read your mind to know what you’re thinking.”
“Spare me the dramatics,” he said and rolled his eyes. “We both know you wouldn’t hurt Dean. Not even to get to me.”
“Yes,” he answered. “It’s just a matter of when. I don’t know how long it would take my grace to fail me. I think I have at least a few years left, but I can’t know for sure. And if God returns, it could get better and never completely burn out.”
“You’re so weird,” sighed Sam. He shook his head. “Point is, he’s gonna have a ring. You could get one too. To be your anchor. Unless you had one in your head too?”
A few minutes later, Dean swung the car around a tree-hidden curve of road and slowed to a stop. On the other side of the street, heading his direction, was a very out-of-breath Castiel sweating through a thin gray t-shirt and shorts. When Cas saw the car he slowed his pace to a walk, then finally stopped, panting and staring at the Impala as he pulled the earbuds from his ears.
Castiel blinked down at Dean, bewildered, and then finally released him to sit back on his haunches and collect himself. “I don’t know. I don’t exactly have a baseline to compare to, though I suppose it’s entirely possible some of my grace has bonded permanently to this vessel.”
“Actually, Sam is right,” admitted Castiel. Dean sighed, and Castiel smiled. “How do you want the tomato cut?”
“I just want to touch you. Commit every inch of you to memory,” Castiel murmured, his left hand trailing slowly up Dean’s side. “We don’t have to go further than this.”
Sam and Jack stood, wide-eyed, in the doorway. They both gaped at the image: Dean Winchester in the lap of Castiel, angel of the Lord, surrounded by books and broken glass, lip-locked. Or—they were lip-locked until Sam spoke. Dean cleared his throat and scrambled backwards to land hard on his rear, blushing furiously.
“Stop it!” Dean shouted, the lead in his feet dissolving. He took two running steps forward, but Michael stopped him short.
” Rowena commanded, and guided the tail of the smoke into Castiel’s mouth, pressing her palm over it. “Separabis originem invasor!” She whispered harshly.
Castiel’s mouth opened, just slightly, but he didn’t yet speak. Instead, he followed Michael quietly through the forest, toward the sound of rushing water. After a few minutes of walking, the trees again began to thin, the ground slowly bearing less and less grass, turning to stone. When they finally broke through the other side of the tree line, Castiel sucked in a breath.
Castiel softened without meaning to, his guts threatening to spill out again. He stepped forward, a bloody hand instinctively reaching for the crumbling hunter. “Dean, I—”
I take a deep breath; I realize suddenly that my human body, though it might not need sleep, still requires respiration. On the exhale, I lower my hands into my lap. Dean is still staring, and he looks beautiful like this--for a moment his grief is forgotten; his eyes are sharp with wonder. I smile in spite of myself; for that moment, he seems every bit like Sam's brother, all wide-eyed awe. I close my eyes again, but leave my head turned in his direction.
“Mmmnfff,” Cas answered, writhing beneath Dean. He hugged his knees into Dean’s side and this time, when Dean dropped his hips, he rolled back up into them, finally catching Dean off-guard enough to let slip a moan of his own.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Classic Cas,” he mumbled. “Those are—I dunno what those are. But they’re not either of those things.”
Almost instantly, Jack’s body went slack. Sam caught him and dragged him to one of the plush chairs in the library, beleaguered by his own yawns the entire way.
Castiel opened his mouth to speak, but his voice was overshadowed by another one; a darker one, full of amused malice.
“Hey,” said Dean softly, releasing the handle of his pan to press a palm over Castiel’s folded hands on his stomach. “You okay?”
Castiel blew air out of his nose and his shoulders slumped defeatedly. He turned around to rest against the table and crossed his arms. He met Dean’s gaze and they stared at one another like they had so many times before. Something in Castiel broke at that moment, and the fight left his body in a rumbling wave that vibrated the air. Dean shivered, though Castiel suspected he didn’t know what caused it. Finally, he spoke, and his words were low and tired, and brimming with defeated sadness.
“He’ll need to double the amount he’s using to account for what’s missing,” said Jack, brows lifting. “Which means he’ll extract more at once, which makes him weaker.” Beside him, Castiel let slip the barest grin.
“Always so dramatic, Sam,” Michael said, rolling his eyes. “I’m merely curious. Nephilim are rare in every universe.” He winked at Jack. “Don’t worry, kid. You’re of no use to me dead—and I
Sighing, Dean obliged. “What are they?” He asked, fingering one of the buds as he walked over. Rowena smacked his hand.
The song was still playing, though it began to warp and distort as if it was in a tunnel, the sound growing distant as it sped away.
Jack opened his mouth to speak and milk dribbled down his chin. He dropped his spoon and clapped his hand over his mouth, holding up a finger to Dean while he loudly crunched the too-large mouthful.
“What a predictable nerve I seem to have struck,” said Michael, rolling his eyes. He must have seen Sam standing, too, because his other hand balled into a fist, and Sam collapsed to the ground, eyes wide, clawing at his throat for breath. “What about this nerve, Dean?”
“Yes, actually,” said Castiel, lifting his gaze to Dean. He let the pen cap drop to the bed. “Horizontal six was ‘Epicureanism.’”
Castiel’s eyes widened with the word, and he repeated it like a revelation. “Heartache…yes. And, no. It’s similar, I suppose. Angels aren’t meant to feel anything so intensely, but I feel it in my grace. It’s consuming. I never had a name for it. I’ve only understood love by human standards for a few years. Since I—” Castiel paused, and he smiled sheepishly up at Sam. “Well, since I pulled your brother out of Hell. I didn’t know what to call it then, of course. But I learned. I learned that love was warm. Like witnessing my father build the stars. I didn’t know it could be cold as well.” He shrugged. “Now I know. All those moments I’ve been so angry with Dean—angry enough to kill him—that was love, too.”
When they finally rolled up to Verona High’s parking lot, Dean hung his head—a moment of defeat he’d been staving off with anger all day.
Dean mirrored Sam’s nod and closed his eyes, blowing out a long, steadying breath. “Okay,” he said, barely audible. “Okay.” Sam was there before he opened his eyes, pulling him into a tight hug. Dean peered over his shoulder at the door, the splinters of wood around the handle where his brother had kicked it in. He scrunched fingers into Sam’s back and indulged the embrace for a just a moment before patting him and pulling back. “Okay,” he said a third time, sniffing. “So what do we do now? Where’s Jack?”
Castiel blinked at the shaggy-haired hunter in the doorway, then down to the half-empty pot, then nodded. “Oh. Right. My apologies.” He chugged the rest of the long-cold coffee while Sam watched with a sleepy kind dull wonder, then rose and paced over to pass off the empty carafe.
So when they got home after days of trail mix and beef jerky, they were all worn to the bone—even Castiel—or so Sam thought. They got in just before midnight and Sam was in the shower, so tired he was barely staying on his feet, when the lights again went out, then flickered to red, and the water suddenly ran ice cold before stopping completely.
“He says it hurts,” said Dean, cracking open his beer mechanically. “But he describes the physical pain as like…I dunno. Like we’d talk about a headache, or a sprained ankle. I don’t think that’s the bad part.”
“Am now,” Sam said as he took a few more steps and closed the circle. It took up almost the entire center of the warehouse floor—nearly thirty feet in diameter. “Probability’s on our side with this one.”
“So what do you think I should do?” Castiel asked Jack as he pushed the faded blue ‘57 Ford Skyliner down the road—the most inconspicuous of the conspicuously vintage cars left in the Bunker’s garage. The motor was loud and rough, the vibrations rattling up through the seat and into Castiel’s bones, but he liked the sensation; it was grounding, a feeling he could trust in its reality. “What would you do?”
Behind him stood Cas, but he wasn't quite right. And he wasn’t standing so much as hovering, arms behind his back—in the mist that was rolling suddenly in, his legs were obscured, and Dean couldn’t tell if Cas’s feet were touching the ground.
“Get out of the car,” said Castiel. He opened his eyes wide and they spilled out beams of violent blue light. A high-pitched ringing started to slowly consume the air. Dean threw a hand over his own eyes to shield them, and Castiel sat up to grip him by the shoulders, push him toward the passenger side door. “Get out of the car, Dean!” he repeated. “Now!”
Castiel smiled to himself and lowered his hands, looking back over at Dean, sound asleep and lightly snoring. “This is a miracle,” he whispered in belated agreement, and propped back up onto his elbows. “
“He’s begging me to spare you, you know,” said Michael. Cas tried to scramble to his feet, but Michael snagged him by the collar of his shirt, hoisting him up effortlessly. “He
“He will,” said Sam, watching the angel carefully. “And he’ll come back,” he added, soothing. “You know he will.”
Cas closed his eyes and stretched, savoring the warmth of the sun. “You humans are too dependent on those things,” he said.
“Sam—” he tried to yell, but found his throat wasn’t immune to the rigidity, and it came out a hoarse almost-whisper. He cleared his throat and tried again, mustering all his energy. “SAM!” this time, his voice bellowed and echoed off the stone hallway. Castiel wondered if it would have been loud enough if he’d been behind a closed door.
A hand closed around his wrist, prompting Dean to open his eyes. “Cas?” he whispered. Castiel stared up at him looking like a raw, angelic nerve, his hair was a messy, dark shock against the white pillowcase. “What’s wrong?”
The color drained from Dean’s face as he balked at Sam, and then rose again as Jack jumped out from behind a shelf where he’d been hiding and listening. “I heard!” he said cheerily, all but bouncing up to Dean. “So, when’s the wedding?”
He was cut off by Castiel closing the distance between them with a desperate, bruising kiss that pushed Dean, silently, back into his room.
“Alright,” said Castiel, returning the smile again. Dean turned his back and focused again on the cooking. Instead of going to the pantry to get the supplies, he stood and watched Dean in silence—noted the way the blades of his shoulders moved beneath his shirt, almost like the muscles in a pair of wings. Something painful twisted in his gut, and Castiel’s feet moved seemingly without permission to carry him across the kitchen. Silently, he approached Dean and wound his arms around his torso, pressing his forehead to the back of Dean’s neck to kiss the center of his back between his shoulders with a long sigh.
Michael snorted and looked over at Castiel, appraising him mildly. “You aren’t the Castiel I knew. Your time with the humans has made you weak—”
“I don’t know, Sam. This time feels…different,” said Cas. “I think he believes he’s dead, and this is his Hell—getting everything he wanted only to have it unravel around him.”
“No, not particularly,” admitted Cas. “But it’s a—what you’d call a creature comfort, I think. The caffeine has little effect, but I find the gesture soothing. A remnant of my time as a human, I suppose.”
“That’s fair,” said Dean, chuckling softly. He sat up a moment later, considering Castiel, lip pursed in thought. “You still think of this as a vessel?” he asked, reaching out to give Castiel’s knee a little thump. “I dunno, man. To me this is
Castiel’s voice floated from behind, almost muffled, as if behind a thick wall of glass. The hairs on Dean’s neck stood on end and he whirled around to find his lover standing beside the foot of the bed in a dull, shimmering blue light. He was almost transparent.
Castiel swept his gaze over Dean’s chest, then loosed his hand from Dean’s to trail it down his sternum. “Whatever I want?” he repeated softly.
“Don’t you think—” Cas began, and cut himself off, sighing through his nose. He straightened and picked up the sleeve again, pulling the record from it and settling it on the turntable, though he didn’t start it. He held the needle, and with his back still to Dean, nearly whispered, “After everything we’ve been through, everything we’ve endured, everything we’ve
Dean did, awkwardly moving back onto his haunches, slipping out of Castiel almost completely with the shift. Castiel squirmed onto his knees, then draped his arms over Dean’s shoulders, winding fingers into his beloved’s hair. He kissed him deeply, and when Dean sighed into it, he sank back down, his weight giving Dean a new depth, and they both cried out without intent.
Castiel leaned forward to brace a hand next do Dean’s head and kissed him hard, swallowing a moan from Dean as he began to slowly pump and squeeze. He licked into Dean’s mouth on the upstroke, and again Dean bucked his hips upward. Castiel broke the kiss and pulled back, and he released Dean as well, instead using that hand to touch at Dean’s lips with his middle and pointer finger. Dean stared up at him, and Castiel said lowly, “Open your mouth.”
“Come on, Sammy,” said Dean, pouring Sam’s drink. “This life? We don’t get to be happy. We don’t get relationships.” He set the bottle down, a little too loudly, but Castiel still didn’t stir. “I mean, look at our track record. Lisa, Jessica, Amelia…”
Dean’s body felt like it was being tugged apart an atomic level. He could feel the smallest particles of himself splitting and then coming back together, like a video of a bomb on a loop, going off, then rewinding itself into nothing. And then, as suddenly as it began, it ended—his knees ached against a hard stone floor, his palms pressed to the cool surface. He couldn’t open his eyes, though—not yet. Part of it was a strange nausea moving through him in rapid, stomach-tugging waves, and part of it was fear. Dean didn’t know what exactly he would see, and at least like this, he could live for a time in this in-between space, the moment before the moment when he would know, for better or for worse, what had happened.
“Yes, I feel fine, actually,” Castiel said, still rummaging. He pulled out a large block of cheese and some butter, bumping the door closed with his hip and turning to Dean. “I think Sam and I were right about the graces mixing, it—What’s wrong?”
She complained that she didn’t have a lot to work with (“You guys really do look like lumberjacks, you know. But sadder.”) but she cobbled something together that made the pair look a little less out of place. Dean was a little taller than Castiel, but Claire managed to make a pair of the hunter’s jeans work for Castiel by cuffing them stylishly at the bottom, and with his already black shoes and one of Dean’s black tees, she admitted the angel didn’t look half bad. Castiel’s transition from Holy Tax Accountant to Gay Dad went smoothly, without him giving any resistance. It was for a case, after all. Dean, however, was indignant.
Dean whipped his head around to see Sam, risen, and staring hard at Belial in the mirror. His chest was heaving as if he’d been running, and he was digging his thumb into a scar on his palm—the one he used to use to tell Lucifer’s games from reality all those years ago.
“The Sons of Darkness and Sons of light slaughtered each other,” continued Sam. “Down to the last demon and angel. Except,” he held up a finger and reached to tap a paragraph toward the bottom of the book in front of Dean, “for Belial, and the commander of the Sons of Light: Michael.”
Everyone agreed it was better if Sam drove. Dean was mostly okay, thanks to the doses of grace, but he was still a little dizzy.
“I’ll…get the bandages,” said Jack from the doorway, awkwardly. Sam nodded at him and frowned, and Jack disappeared down the hall.
Michael roared back at Dean and staggered backwards, hand at his throat, bottle protruding from his stomach. He took stock of his body briefly before returning his attention to Dean, who, while Michael was distracted, had managed to shuttle Sam, Jack, and Castiel away from the mayhem and toward the bunker’s entrance. If they made it inside, Michael was back to playing a waiting game, and Sam wouldn’t make the same mistake twice. He couldn’t fight them all in his weakened state, it was true; and with the new damage to his vessel, he knew there was no chance of getting the grace from Sam. The younger Winchester would crush it in his palm the moment Michael tried, and it would all have been for nothing. But he had enough power to do one thing.
They stared at each other for a moment, awkwardly, before Castiel finally cleared his throat and asked, “Did you sleep well?”
“As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted,” sassed Rowena, “Hold your destination in your mind’s eye. When you’ve got it, squeeze the Seal with the intent to be there.”
He cleared his throat again and slipped two fingers into the bag, closing his fist around the ring before he pulled it out, hiding it from Castiel’s view. He crumpled the bag and shoved it back into his pocket. Castiel stared at Dean’s closed hand, then looked up at Dean, and his blue eyes narrowed with curiosity.
Slowly, as they both came down from their pleasure, Castiel lifted himself from Dean and collapsed on his chest. Dean wound his arms around Castiel and kissed his cheeks, his lips, his forehead, then pulled Castiel’s head down into his shoulder, and Dean began to sob. Castiel splayed himself across Dean and tucked his arms beneath his shoulders in the grass, and without really meaning to, began to cry with him, while the trees of Eden whispered overhead in the breeze.
Castiel laughed softly and scratched his head. “It’s not me he has to convince, though I’m admittedly apathetic either way.”
again, though he left the phone on the table, watching it ring. “I know you and Dean need to work through some things, but I wanted to ask if it could wait.” Castiel arched a brow, and Sam amended quickly, “Not long. Just an hour or two. Jack has a surprise for you that you’re obviously not supposed to know about it, and he worked really hard. It’s just—”
“Known what?” Dean wondered, nearly a whisper. He trailed his arms down just slightly to clasp his finger’s behind Castiel’s neck at the base, thumbing gentle circles into his skin.
The whole time Sam and Dean are missing, and when they find him, when Dean chooses to sit beside him in the backseat.
Cas regained his composure quickly and grinned up at Dean. “You think I didn’t know that was coming?”
“You’re a witch,” said Sam with a low chuckle. “Don’t you have some sort of—I dunno, cloning spell?”
He nodded at the scribble and then tore off the page, leaving it on Sam’s chest. “Should do it,” he mumbled, then turned back to Castiel. “M’hungry.”
“Oh, wonderful! Welcome, welcome,” she said. “I’m Gretchen Abrams, the assistant principal and PTA president. I’m sorry, you’ve come in at a—trying moment. We’re enduring some tragedies in our community,” she blanched, and then added, “But not hate crimes. Nothing like that. Verona is a really inclusive city. We even have a thriving support group for students with same-sex parents, if you think your daughter would be interested.”
“I—don’t know,” grumbled Dean, still hovering inches above Cas, but looking back over his shoulder towards the door, brows knit. “Thought I heard something.”
“Aye, you didn’t think I’d stay here, did you?” Rowena smiled. “Just remember our deal, boys. Au revoir!”
Claire had gone rigid in her seat, jaw set. “It’s fine. Don’t worry about it. I’m calling it a night.” She stood to leave and took the remaining beers with her, loping up the stairs. Castiel flinched when he heard the door slam, and with his still-angelic hearing, lock behind her.
“You don’t need to be sorry,” echoed Castiel. “I’m the one who walked in on something I wasn’t meant to see.”
“I’ll get started on the hex bags. No use wasting the night,” he continued, wishing bitterly that in that moment he had his wings, that he could just disappear. The walk to the door felt like a humiliating slog through a river of molasses. “Cas!” He heard from behind him, and Dean’s scramble to rise, but the barely-furnished home was small; he was at the threshold more quickly than expected, shutting the door behind him and disappearing into the suburban almost-darkness, envying the fireflies their flight the whole walk down the drive.
“If I need to stop I’ll stop,” assured Jack. He lifted the hotel phone and set it to speaker, and a dialtone filled the room. “Go, Cas. Go get Dean.”
"Yesterday," Sam sniffs, woozing a bit on his feet. I reach out to steady him, but he waves me off. "He could use you there. I don't think we're good for each other right now, you know? And you guys--profound bond, or whatever."
“Yeah,” echoed Sam, finally getting to his feet. He glanced around at the field around them, and the forest at the edge of it, and sighed. “How the hell do we find Cas in all this?”
“I—I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to—” Sam started, and Dean spoke at the same time, a chorus of awkward male voices.
“Hey guys,” he said, trying to defuse the atmosphere. “We hit four different fast food joints. Dean, I got you a milkshake this one place called the ‘apple pie.’ There’s actual pie in it.”
“Okay,” he said softly as he removed it and set it aside and looped his arms back around Castiel. “Keep it up, Cas. Gonna be fine.”
Dean’s fingers gripped hard into Castiel’s thigh, the other pumping in time with Castiel’s steady grind. Castiel’s own fingers dug into the grass beside Dean’s head as he brought Dean nearly fully out, then sank him back in in an increasing pace. As he quickened, he began to pant out rhythmic, elongated groans, pulling similar sounds from Dean’s open mouth.
Just as he spoke the room got heavier—they both felt the weight of the intimacy the seldom-used full name carried—and in the same moment, Jack burst through the door, arms laden with paper sacks, and he announced cheerily, “We got burritos, and burgers, and…”
Dean tugged a folded piece of paper from his pocket, Jack’s and Rowena’s names written on the front. He held it up to Sam in display, then walked over and stuck it to the fridge. “So they’ll know.”
Castiel gave the smallest of smiles. “Right. What the hell.” He turned to look at Jack, and said, “Ready?”
“Calm down, Hulk Hogan,” Dean said with a smile, hoping his voice didn’t waver too much. “Let’s get you in fighting shape first, huh?” Castiel tilted his head, bravado fading a bit, and Dean held up his phone to explain. “Sam and Jack are back. You still hungry?”
Without really meaning to, Sam leaned his shoulder against the doorway, transfixed. He’d seen Dean cry before—when their dad died, and hell, even when he’d died himself, and a few other times—but somehow this was even more intimate though his brother shed no tears. He knew Dean loved Castiel differently than a brother, or even a friend, but he didn’t know just how much, how deeply, until they’d lost him last year. Now, after hearing what Michael said to Castiel, and watching him cradling and singing to the unconscious angel, he knew in his gut that Dean wouldn’t come back from it if they lost Castiel again.
“That’s what you want, isn’t it, angel? Pretty damn pathetic. You really think I could want you like that?”
“Seriously? You fucking child, Cas,” Dean spat. He cranked the Impala and sped off out of the parking lot even as he dialed the phone company to turn on GPS tracking. “Hi, I need to—don’t put me on hold—damnit!” He drove around the small town, hitting every side street and back alley he could find, searching out any place that might be a haven for a vampire. All the while, elevator music played from the speaker of his phone on the seat beside him, the nearly thirty-minute hold mocking him.
“Alright, don’t get your trousers twisted,” she chirped back and waved her hand flippantly at Sam. “It’s not like no—”
“Kiss me,” Castiel whispered on a breath, pulling Dean down further to smush him into a messy, sloppy kiss.
“C’mon,” he said, and Castiel rose clumsily, heavily from his lap, and then Dean stood as well. As quickly as they could manage in the deluge, they gathered up the candles and sopping blanket, put out the lantern, and shoved it all haphazardly into Dean’s duffle bag. Castiel grabbed the cooler and Dean threw the bag over his shoulder, and they made their way the twenty feet or so back to the car in a slow, splashy jog, the mud of the shoreline sucking gently at their shoes.
“Yeah,” said Dean, simply. His lips twitched in the barest smile as he looked up in time to watch Jack shake the frisbee loose but cling to the branch he’d climbed to, from which he now hung—just a hair too high for Castiel to reach him.
“Sorry, I’m sorry,” the woman cleared her throat and began again. “They found Alan and Sue the same way they found the others. Their son is being taken to his grandparent’s house a few hours north—oh.”
. And when he came home, he taught us the names of his creations. And we worshipped--bodiless, formless, free--we worshipped. What we did--you might call it singing, dancing--art forms for our Father. We watched him create
Instead of relief, Castiel felt himself grow suddenly, very humanly bitter. He balled a fist around the hotel blanket beneath him and again, the grace flared hot and wild in his chest. “Then why?” he said lowly, voice almost a hiss. “Why couldn’t you just—unless you’re ashamed.”
Castiel blinked, then stood to look in a mirror hung on the other side of the room. His eyes were glowing blue, but not only that: bright grace was rolling down his cheeks like tears. Castiel didn’t cross the room to the mirror. Instead, he sat back down on the edge of the bed and pressed his fingers to his cheek. The grace swept away at his touch like wisps of smoke, then dissolved into the air.
Rowena, Sam, and Jack argued, voices overlapping, and all the while Castiel was silent. He rose from the edge of the bed and padded to a window while they continued, oblivious to his movements. After a few moments of staring out into the dark, he cleared his throat and turned to face the bickering trio.
Nobody spoke. Dean cleared his throat and looked down to his shoes and made a noise in his throat, and Sam, blinked back at Jack and broke into a wide smile of his own.
Dean woke up screaming. His body was covered in sweat and his heart was racing, but despite it, he was shivering, covered in goosebumps. He sat bolt upright in bed and panted, stared around his bedroom. He touched his face and the sheets to make sure they were real, then turned to his side, looking for Castiel. The bed was empty. He threw off the covers and ran to the bathroom, forced open the door. Empty. He looked for the glass of water he’d given Castiel the night before and found that it, too, was gone. “No, no, no,” he whispered to himself, panic thick and bitter in his throat. He shoved out of the bathroom and looked for something—anything—to prove this was real, that he was free of Michael.
“Will it change anything to wonder?” asked Cas, leaning up. “What good does it do to question? We can’t go back.” He squeezed Dean’s hand and slipped out of bed, scooping up a pair of boxers and stepping into them as he walked towards the record player, still skipping with static.
“It’s not broken, Cas!” Dean snarled, and both their faces went blank with the blurry deja-vu of memory, with realization. Castiel was silent, staring, and Dean folded, his voice still gruff, but the edge of anger gone. “Look, just—we’ll talk about it. Okay? I promise. I swear, we will talk about this. But right now, I need to kill something, and I need to work this case so that something doesn’t kill anyone else. Okay?”
“That I needed you,” Castiel answered, looking back up to meet Dean’s gaze, though his hand remained in place. “That I was lost without you, not because of you.”
“Can a two-year-old do this?” asked Jack, standing up and pointing at the book of lore he was digging through. “Can a toddler—”
“Yeah?” challenged Dean, stepping into Castiel’s space. “Because you’re acting like this is a walk in the park. Not waking me up, not telling me your brain’s going nuclear—”
Castiel softened. “Dean, it’s—you’re always human. I don’t stop you,” he refuted gently. Castiel reached out for Dean’s cheek, flinching when Dean turned away from the touch. “It isn’t fair,” he concluded softly.
“But you can speed it up, obviously, or you wouldn’t be here. Right?” asked Dean. He tried to conceal the panic edging into his voice.
Dean choked on his beer and his ears and cheeks flared red. Across the table, Sam didn’t even bother trying to conceal an amused as hell grin. “That’s not the point,” he finally said, clearing his throat.
“So there’s your answer,” finished Claire. “Poor woman lost everything, spent two years studying, and got her revenge.” She pulled a piece of paper from her pocket and passed it to Sam. “Here’s her address. What do you say we pay her a visit?”
Dean must have accidentally eventually dozed off, because when he woke to Sam’s knocking at the door, announcing Rowena’s arrival, he was beneath the blankets with a very much awake Castiel, tangled up in each other’s arms.
It was nearly noon when Dean finally woke, but the library was still bathed in shadow and sickly lamplight; no one had flipped the main switch to illuminate the room. He stirred with a groan and lifted his head from the table, picked up the whiskey bottle, empty save a splash, that had fallen to its side. In the glass dome that housed the growing crystal Dean caught sight of his reflection: the wood-grain pattern pressed into his cheek and the five-o-clock shadow beginning to dust his chin, his sleep-messy hair. He groaned again and scrubbed his hand down over his eyes, then focused on the Seal. The geode-like crystals that covered the stones were still small but beginning to come to points that grew towards each other instead of out. Assuming it was a good sign, Dean pushed back from the table and wobbled to the kitchen.
Castiel stopped, blinking down at Dean, who’d completely lost himself to a fit of rarely heard, authentic laughter. His head was thrown back against the pillow in an open-mouthed smile, his body shaking beneath Castiel’s with his amusement. A few tears found their way out of Dean’s eyes, and he’d barely calmed himself down when he jerked Castiel back down, kissing him hard and happy through an un-killable grin.
“It’s fine, you oaf,” Rowena answered. She glanced up at him and took in Dean’s features, heartache and worry lining his face, badly concealed. She sighed and set down the stalks of flowers, reaching for a large, black bag. “Wait a moment.”
“Just for a little while,” Sam said apologetically. He tapped the end-call button as it went to voicemail, then scrolled down and pressed the call button on another number. “For Jack. He’s so excited.”
They spent so much time outside after lunch it was half-past three by the time Dean and Castiel were ready to hit the road. They had just slipped into the Impala in the garage when Dean patted his pocket and lied. “Guess I left my keys in my room. You wanna run and steal that cooler while I get ‘em? We can pick up some more beer while we’re out.”
Castiel’s heart seized as he watched Dean—heartache, like he and Sam talked about all those days or months ago—and he reached out to touch Dean’s cheek. It was clammy, cold to the touch, but radiating enough heat from deep within Dean’s body that he was sweating. “Wait here,” he said, finally, swiping his thumb over Dean’s cheek. “I’m going for a moment, but I’m coming right back. Okay?”
He left the plates and box on the blanket, then rose to walk a few feet back through the sand to where the shrubs and grasses began. Castiel poked through the scrub for a minute or two until he found a couple of reasonably long branchlings, then returned to the blanket. He stuck them into the sand, one at each of the top two corners of the blanket, and then drew a small string of old-fashioned, multi-colored Christmas lights from the duffel and carefully twisted them up one branch and down the other, making a kind of drape in the middle. Finally, he pulled a small boom box, one last bag, an envelope, and another small box from the duffel, then shoved their earlier discarded clothes into the bag.
“So you saw—everything?” ventured Dean, still not looking up. The crests of his ears were burning red where they peeked out from his messy hair, which was longer than usual—Michael hadn’t bothered to get it cut.
Dean nodded, breaking into a sheepish grin, and Castiel continued. “Give me your hand,” he said, and Dean held out a palm. Castiel unfolded and opened the envelope to shake out a heavy ring into Dean’s hand that, at first glance, looked as simple as the one he’d given Cas. Dean opened his mouth to thank him, but Castiel shook his head. “I want to tell you about it first.” Dean closed his lips and nodded. He began to turn the ring over in his fingers, moving it closer to a candle to let it catch the light. It was then that he noticed the silver of it, solid as it was, almost looked like a liquid, as if it was molten, and appeared to be shot through with tiny veins of a lighter silver—almost blue, like lightning, giving the ring a subtle cracked finish that caught the firelight.
“A bullet will hurt me, but it could kill you,” the angel answered gruffly. “Let me at least get us oriented.”
Dean snorted. “Shut up,” he said, and filled his brother’s glass, allowing a little grin. He set the bottle back down and leaned against the desk, swirling his whiskey, though he stared over the rim of his glass at Castiel. “It really doesn’t matter?” he asked, almost a whisper.
Dean shook his head and laughed, leaving the bathroom light on and the door open, though he turned off the lamps in the bedroom. He settled in bed fully clothed and rolled on his side, staring at Castiel until the whiskey pulled him into sleep.
Cas wrenched his head free. “Dean, don’t—” he started, but the shadow Michael’s hand clamped down more tightly.
Dean nodded, and slowly guided Castiel’s fingers out, then licked his palm, slicked Castiel, and lined him up. He looked into blue eyes, and when Castiel nodded back, he sank down slowly, exhaling a moan that turned into a laugh. Castiel gasped and writhed, hips bucking up without meaning to. Dean slowly lifted, then sank back down, Castiel’s hands warm and tight on his hips. “C’mere,” he whispered, and pulled on Castiel’s shoulder to guide him forwards. Castiel moved slowly so as not to unseat Dean, lowering him onto his back on the seat of the car.
“Yes,” Dean whispered through a breathless sound of pleasure, and Castiel released his hip to wind fingers around Dean’s other hand and force them both more prone.
Castiel braced himself on his knees and when he was sure Dean’s position was steady, he began to thrust more quickly, finding a rhythm. Dean arched into the sensation and his knees slipped, forcing his chest to the floor. Instead of slowing, though, Castiel found more depth and pushed in harder, more fluidly, grinding Dean’s hips into the blanket on the floor. Castiel let out a low, filthy growl, and sank himself somehow deeper, pulling a loud groan from Dean that bounced off the wall.
Castiel tilted his head. “I’m just getting started,” he said. Without looking away from Dean he slipped his hand between Dean’s legs, palming slowly up over his length through his jeans, and Dean gasped. Castiel smiled, and it was dark. He broke Dean’s gaze just long enough to find the button and zipper of his jeans, and made quick work of them both before hooking the fingers of both hands into beltloops and jerking them partway down.
I sigh. I don't mean to, but I sigh. How very typically Winchester of him. A long time ago, I would've said I didn't understand, but now I do. Now, I've been there--felt that need to swaddle feeling, to protect it like an infant. And the frustration instantly fades. I can't find it within me to be angry at his deflecting. Not anymore. Not this time.
“You like her too!” said Dean, only letting go of Castiel’s hand to push his brother’s shoulder and guffaw.
Castiel stopped chewing to look up at Sam, then Jack, and finally, when his eyes started watering and his face turned red, Dean—expression almost comically wounded.
Dean snorted, jamming his phone back into the inside pocket of his suit jacket and striding for the door. “Yeah, okay, Dr. Phil. You coming or not?”
Gently, he pressed a ghost of kiss to Dean’s lips and slowly shuffled himself out of bed, tucking the sheet and blanket back around Dean. They’d both slipped back into boxers before crawling into bed for Dean to sleep, and Castiel donned his earlier discarded jeans and t-shirt and padded silently to the bathroom. He blinked at himself in the mirror when he turned on the light—his hair was a wild, dark mess from where Dean’s hands had been, and because of that, he was hesitant to fix it—the physical proof of Dean’s touch. Still, for Sam’s sake, he pushed his fingers through it to settle it into something a little more typical.
“Let me,” Dean panted when he was settled again, and Castiel nodded. Dean settled his hands on Castiel’s shoulders, and rolled his hips, lifting himself up on his knees. He couldn’t move as patiently as Castiel’s angelic strength allowed, but the angel didn’t seem to mind, and neither did Dean. In a few slow thrusts his head was rolling back, lips parting in a silent cry as he rode Castiel, and Castiel wrapped his hand around Dean’s length once more, letting Dean’s motion carry him through.
Dean pressed his other hand to Castiel’s through the barrier. “I just want you,” he said, a broken whisper.
“I did,” he nodded proudly. “But Sam had to buy the champagne. And the streamers. And…well, everything, because I have no money, and I can’t drive.”
Dean’s mouth fell open, and Castiel reached over, simply, to place his hand on Dean’s where it rested in a fist on the desk. “That’s alright, thank you. We’re sorry for your losses, and glad to be here.”
Dean reciprocated clumsily, panting into Cas’s kiss as he fumbled with the button, though his fingers faltered, and he folded into an involuntary groan as Cas slipped a hand beneath his boxers and gripped him hard. For a moment, that was all that mattered. Instinct and desire took over, and within seconds he and Cas were a tangle of quickly-stripping limbs, grinding and groaning against each other in unbound bliss.
Dean stammered, but he couldn’t look at Castiel. He pushed into the parking lot and fumbled needlessly with his keys, shaking his head. “It’s not like that, Cas,” he said softly.
“Yeah,” said Sam with an awkward grin and glance toward Castiel, who moved to sit on the bed Dean had just vacated.
The room dissolved into silence once more, and it stayed that way for almost three minutes until Rowena said, simply, “It’s nearly there, lads.”
Dean groaned low in his throat, but what was a noise of contentment soon turned to one of struggle. “Cas—” he said, but Castiel didn’t relent. Instead, he kissed somehow harder, bruising into Dean’s lips. “Mmphh—” he started again and tried to push back against Castiel as his airway began to close. Suddenly the car went silent and dark: the music and engine ceased, and the headlights flickered off, as well as all the lights in the garage with a muffled pop. Instead of pushing, Dean was pushed back.
Then the second raindrop hit, and the third. Fourth. Thunder rumbled above them, suddenly loud and engulfing, hard enough that they felt the vibrations in the ground. Before Dean and Castiel could think to pull apart, the sky flashed once with lightning, then split open above them, sending down a torrential rain. Castiel pulled back and looked up into the water, blinking, and Dean looked up at Castiel, his dark hair suddenly heavy and wet, sticking to his forehead.
Dean didn’t answer immediately. He searched Castiel’s features for a long while before finally asking, “You want this?”
“I’ll try not to get caught,” she winked, and picked up the hem of her dress to turn and sweep out the door, heels clicking all the way up the stairs.
“Aye,” nodded Rowena, meticulously rearranging a few jars of sinister-looking liquids. “Go and fetch the lovebirds?”
“I don’t mind you being human either,” said Dean, closing his eyes with a soft sigh. “But I worry less when you’re an angel.”
Dean smirked and dipped his head. “She’s gonna be pissed about that. But I’d have done the same thing. You talk to her yet?”
“You would’ve killed yourself,” Sam said bluntly. Dean opened his mouth to speak, but Sam cut him off. “And don’t say you wouldn’t have. You didn’t see yourself. So, yeah, I made a judgement call because I can’t do this without my brother. You can punch me later.” When Dean looked away, Sam sighed again. “Come on. You need to eat, and we need to catch you up.”
“Not long,” answered Castiel, padding barefoot over to the table. “But I feel strangely okay. Just a bit more…human, than normal.”
Dean blinked and straightened with the realization and touched his cheek, then looked down at his fingers, smeared in blood. “Right,” he said, then turned to Castiel and scowled deeper. “You’re still bleeding, Cas.”
“I’ll just—bring the bottle,” said Sam haltingly. Once he loosened Castiel’s fingers, he took hold of both his hands. “Can you bend your knees if I pull up?”
“Why can’t we?” Jack blurted, face contorting in anger. “If he’s in as bad of shape as Cas says he is, can’t we have umm…” he paused, then snapped, looking up. “Power of Attorney?”
“Yep,” said Dean, defused. He strode to the fridge, which was now working despite the city having long ago turned off the foreclosed home’s power, thanks to a jolt from Cas to the transformer outside. “Hey, Cas, you think you could make the cable work too?”
Castiel leaned back up to watch Dean’s face as the dream took hold, and when he smiled in his sleep, Castiel knew it had worked and Dean was enjoying a salty sea breeze with his toes in the cool water, lounging on white sands somewhere along the Gulf of Mexico with his brother. He grinned down at the sleeping hunter and leaned back on an elbow to let his gaze linger for a while, content to be curled against Dean’s warm skin. With feather-light touches, Castiel traced the contours of Dean’s face: the arches of his eyebrows, the curve of his lips, the hard lines of his cheekbones and jaw. He brushed his fingertips over the soft ends of Dean’s eyelashes and the satisfying prickle of his stubble, the almost-invisible creases in his forehead that weren’t there when they first met but had been rendered permanent by years of anxiety and loss.
“Dean, stop,” Sam interrupted, shaking his head. “God didn’t kill Belial. He locked him up like he locked up Lucifer and the Darkness.”
"You know, I'm old, Dean--not the oldest thing out there, or even close to the oldest angel--but I'm old. By your count, in human time, I've been alive for...oh, millennia."
Dean shook his head and laughed, embarrassed. “I really don’t. Don’t even like the word. Don’t like the ‘married’ word either, honestly.” He paused and cleared his throat. “But I’d do it, y’know. If you wanted to.”
Carefully, Sam slid the thick needle of a large, ancient-looking syringe into a vein of Castiel’s arm, and with a nod from Dean, he gripped the plunger and slowly began to pull.
“Based on the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus,” said Castiel. “The belief that the soul does not survive after death, therefore allowing a life of guiltlessness, as there’s no eternal punishment without a soul.” Dean blinked at him, and Castiel shrugged a bare shoulder. “He was wrong, of course. I happen to know Epicurus is in Hell for preaching a false doctrine.”
Michael gripped Castiel by the hair, jerking his gaze harshly upwards. “Say goodbye, Castiel,” he crooned.
Castiel grunted low as he struggled to stand with Sam’s help, and staggered awkwardly to collapse in his chair beside the table.
“You’re not any of those things,” assured Dean. “Your grace is down the hall. It just takes time. And even without it, you’re not helpless.” He cleared his throat and sat up, pulling his boxers up and running his fingers down Castiel’s back. “If we’re being honest, man, I think I got some kind of PTSD. I saw you die—bright light, burnt wings, the whole thing—and I don’t know. It messed me up. It’s not your fault, and it’s not fair. But it messed me up.”
Dean snorted softly, shaking his head against Castiel’s. “Right,” he said. “Right. I mean, you’re right. It’s—hard, man. This thing with you, it’s…” Dean sighed and ran the pad of his thumb across Castiel’s cheekbone. “Having you like this, after so long—it’s terrifying.”
“Who, then, protects the rest of creation from the humans?” Michael snapped back. He crowded into Castiel’s space, forcing him closer to the cliff’s edge.
Sam ticked his head to Jack and he reached for the doorknob. He gave Dean and Castiel one last pained look, then slowly closed the bedroom door. Castiel leaned forward and kissed Dean on the forehead, then gently extricated his hands and stood, walking to snag the first aid kit.
Castiel grabbed his chest as if he’d been punched and took an involuntary step forward. “Why couldn’t I feel it?” he said, brows knit.
He came around a bend and the road straightened, and Dean used the familiar, simple street path to quickly scroll through his notifications.
“Cas, stop,” Dean answered with his gentler gruffness, the soft tone reserved most often for Castiel. He shook his head a little and let out a humorless laugh, fidgeting with his beer bottle, still not looking up. “Just—you can’t drop something like that and not give a guy a second to think, okay?”
“Yeah, okay,” said Dean. He blew out a steadying breath, then rose to look up into the late afternoon sky. “Weird,” he said.
, stranger—and Castiel explained how in Eden, without pollution, the colors of the atmosphere looked different. Something to do with the molecules being cleaner, uncorrupted—but that in truth, he preferred the “human” sunsets on Earth.
Dean threw a wink over his shoulder and left Castiel lounging on the blanket. He felt the angel’s eyes on him, and any other time he might have been embarrassed, but something about it felt right—or maybe he was just too tired to care. The water that tickled over his toes and ankles as he neared the shore was warm, but it got cooler as it got deeper. Still, it wasn’t cold, and the waves were calm enough for swimming, so he waded further out, let the water lap against his thighs, then his hips, following the long path the moonlight made on the surface. Finally, afraid that his exhaustion might catch up with him if he went further, he stopped when the water reached his elbows, letting it move around him. He wiggled his toes in the shifting sand and sighed, letting his head fall back and his shoulders relax.
By the time the sun was setting eight hours later, Dean and Jack had both gone mostly quiet, opting instead to look out the windows—save for a moment of bickering where Sam turned off the classic rock cassettes to play a podcast and Dean objected until Sam reminded him who picked the music and who shut his cakehole. Castiel offered to change places when they stopped for gas, but Sam declined, saying he was alright, wanted to wear himself out a bit more so he’d be able to sleep tonight. Instead, after more griping from Dean, Castiel finally gave him the front seat to shut him up.
Dean made his way back down the hallway, stopping to hover in front of his bedroom door. He sighed and pressed his forehead to the wood, praying silently to Castiel on the other side,
“Finally, someone who appreciates my talents,” Rowena exclaimed, beaming at Jack. She turned to Sam and pointed at Jack. “I like this one.”
“No,” said Dean, and that invisible gaze shifted his way once more. “Lucifer and Michael might be dead in this world. But this isn’t the only world, and there’s another Michael. One you can kill, because this time, God’s not coming to help him.”
“I thought it was obvious,” trilled Rowena, eyes fluttering. She looked down at Castiel once more, now still and silent, and she slowly removed her hand from his mouth and stepped back. “His eyes are dimming,” she said. “Once they go out it’s over, Sam.”
“Cas—” Dean interrupted, staring wide-eyed at the angel, but Castiel lifted a hand and clenched it, and Dean’s voice disappeared. Had Castiel been more himself, he’d have noted how strange it was that even in Dean’s mind, his powers worked.
Castiel was silent, but his lips parted, and he looked over to Dean, eyes searching. He turned back to watch the road, then looked at Dean again, and Dean looked away. The car dissolved into quiet once more, and a few minutes later, Castiel pulled the car to a stop. “We’re home,” he said softly.
He meandered further down the hall and paused in front of Sam’s room, no light spilling from beneath the closed door. Dread was creeping its way back up his throat, past the feeble dam he’d erected since the conversation with Castiel to try and keep himself sane while he waited. Dean had lifted his hand to knock at Sam’s door, fully prepared to wake his brother up, but hesitated; he had no idea if Sam had slept while he’d been out, and despite wanting the company, Dean moved on. He snagged a bottle of whiskey from the kitchen, shut himself in his room, lay down on the bed, and drank in hopes of falling asleep.
“What’s that you like to say—there’s always a way? I knew you’d find a way because you always do. Because you’re a miracle. The only thing I was afraid of was
Just as he was about to let his punch fly, he looked at Dean on the floor beneath him—really looked, and his stomach was suddenly filled with ice, his blood chilled. Dean was staring up at him, but he wasn’t fighting back. His arms were splayed out above his head on the floor, fingers loose and unfisted. His smile twisted Castiel’s gut—reminded him too much of the way Dean smiled when he was a demon—but the worst was Dean’s eyes: the green of them was deep and sad; brimming with guilt. Castiel stared back and his lips parted in a heavy sigh. He uncurled his hand and panted through his anger, and now his heartache. Dean hadn’t thrown a single punch, but Castiel felt like he’d been hit in the chest with some large, heavy object. He shook his head slowly, still staring down at Dean, and finally pushed to his feet.
“Figured as much,” the cashier said, shrugging happily before backtracking, “I mean, not that—it’s cool, I have two moms. I just meant you guys argue like they do.”
"I want you to be," I interject. The tightness in my chest feels like a fist again. What is this? Rejection? Or the fear of it? Have I frightened him? "I'm not--I'm not who I was, back then. I'm better now. More human than I ever dreamed. I'm so much better."
“Something is snatching parents from a local high school,” Sam said, clearing his throat. “The article I read said they were all from the same PTA group.”
He blew out a slow, steadying breath as the nausea began to subside, and as he did a warm palm touched his cheek in the darkness.
“He is,” said Castiel, and then mirrored Sam’s scowl. “But it all means nothing if we can’t convince him to abandon his dream state and eject Michael.”
“Fine. But don’t think this is over,” said Sam, flipping a book open so loudly some hidden librarian shushed them.
Dean started to sway in a slow, barely-there turn and closed his eyes, tilting his forehead against Castiel’s. “Is this like what you saw?” he asked quietly, and Castiel went suddenly tense beneath his fingers. He lifted his head and opened his eyes to find his angel staring hard at the doorway. Dean’s stomach sank and he released Castiel’s hip to reach up and use a finger to gently turn Castiel’s head. “Cas…” he said, and then, “Cas, look at me.” When the angel turned, Dean shook his head. “It’s not a dream. You’re not gonna walk through that door. This is real.”
“I’m serious,” said Sam, stern as a parent. “I know he doesn’t really sleep, but I’m telling you man, he needed it this weekend. He wouldn’t leave you. Not even for a second.” Sam’s eyes shot toward the stairs; Castiel had gone up when they got home to give Claire’s leg a touch of grace.
“He’s alive,” said Castiel. “But he’s not okay. We need to get him out of here.” Castiel pressed two fingers to Dean’s forehead. “I’ve fixed the superficial things, but—I’m using borrowed grace—grace from the angel who did this to him. I won’t be able to pull him out of this. He’ll have to do it himself. Which is why we have to get him somewhere safe. Now.”
“I don’t think I should take the grace until we’ve tried to get through to Dean with magic,” said Castiel lowly.
His face disappeared in the mirror, and it was as if Belial pulled the air in the room with him when he left. The candles blew out in the strange wind, and suddenly the power in the bunker shut down with a dull hum, plunging them into brief darkness before the red lights of the backup generator bathed them all in crimson. Jack sucked in a deep breath and started coughing as if he’d been drowning, and Rowena emerged from the shadows, mascara streaks drying on her cheeks.
Dean didn’t say anything, but looking over his shoulder, Sam saw the tension leave Dean’s body in a hard shudder as he turned around and ran his hands through his hair.
“Huh,” Sam said, chewing the inside of his cheek, resisting the urge to peer over at Dean, who he could practically feel seething beside him.  “Did you ever have any kids? A—partner?”
“I wanted to be okay for you,” said Dean. His voice cracked under the weight of building tears. “And I think—thought I was, after last night in Eden, but—shit, Cas, I think I was just—I don’t think I thought it was real, and I just wanted it to be real so damn bad, and—” He cut himself off and swallowed hard, shivered involuntarily as Castiel’s sad sigh hit his ear. “How are you okay, man?”
Castiel made a low, content noise in his chest and settled easily against Dean’s chest, like it was the most normal, natural thing in the world. They settled into a comfortable silence as the song played through, then ended, filling the room with soft static. “Hey, you—” Dean began and lifted his head, but stopped short. He looked down to find Castiel snoring gently, his lips parted in sleep. A warmth washed over him at the image, but only briefly—it was overturned by a cold stone of fear as he realized, once more, that angels don’t sleep.
Castiel turned one page, then another, and another, poring quickly over each one. He felt the growl churning in his chest, and before he knew it or could think to control it, the rage was bubbling over. In an uncharacteristic display, Castiel let out a primal, angry roar and slammed the book closed, then hurled it across the room, where it knocked over a lamp, shattering glass. The lights flickered, and he hunched forward, his eyes wrenched closed, teeth grinding, fists pushing into the floor.
“Hurting you,” she answered. Shock colored Dean’s features, but Sam’s face softened, and he blinked at Rowena. She returned a slight smile, then without warning, dragged the blade across Sam’s palm in one quick jerk.
Dean rolled the corpse from his body, his white Fed shirt soaked through with her blood. He sat up to find Castiel still clashing with the angel in the middle of the room, blades flashing and clanging, each celestial deftly avoiding the other’s blows. For a heartbeat, Dean was nearly star-struck: he so rarely saw Castiel fighting without being involved in a skirmish himself, and the sheer skill and dance-like grace with which the blue-eyed angel moved made him catch his breath. With a pang of guilt, he realized his angel really hadn’t been in grave danger from those vampires; Castiel could handle himself, and more.
Castiel nodded and set the ingredients down on the kitchen island. “You did,” he said with a gentle matter-of-factness. “They’ve always been there. They’re here now, though I know you can’t see them.”
“Want to be inside you,” Castiel groaned, and slipped a hand down to Dean’s lower back. “Don’t want to wait.” Dean felt something hot move through is body—the same sensation as being healed by grace—and then painlessly, Castiel was slicked smoothly inside him, a small cry escaping the angel’s lips as one of pleasure passed Dean’s as well, his knees hugging Castiel’s sides. And then, suddenly, Castiel stopped, fully sunk into Dean, and pulled back to look at him. “But I—want to watch you, too. I want to go slow.”
“What do you mean?” said Castiel, his own voice dark and suddenly full of anger. What kind of stupid question was that, he wondered.
Sam and Dean looked at each other in some silent, sibling understanding, and then they both smiled back at Castiel.
Sam had been subconsciously leaning forward into the scene, and he winced as he snapped himself out of it by spilling steaming coffee onto his hand. He hissed and some of it splashed to the floor and he jerked his head up, fully expecting to see Dean staring at him. But Dean kept on singing, clinging to Castiel, and Sam reached inside to set the coffee mug quietly on a little end table by the entrance before turning into the dark hallway and closing the door behind him.
Castiel tilted his head. “Are you suggesting I don’t know what it’s like to lose you?” He asked. “Because I wish I didn’t, but I do.”
“It is,” said Castiel dryly. “I did the math. He has an eighty-nine point seven seven nine percent chance of landing in the circle.”
A chilling silence swept through the room once more. The empty eyes of Belial’s white face didn’t betray any emotion, but Dean swore he saw the tight skin around the corners of Belial’s mouth grow somehow tighter.
“I know it isn’t,” sighed Castiel. They dissolved into an uncomfortable silence until Castiel asked, “Is there anything I can do? Anything you need?”
Castiel tried to answer, but as Dean’s hand wrapped around him his head fell back against the rain-blurred window, open-mouthed. “Yes,” he said, broken, and moved his finger gently inside Dean, other hand digging into his hip.
“No, you’re not,” Sam replied simply, “And if your head’s not in it you don’t need to be out there. Go to the house, have your domestic spat, and fix it. You’re driving everyone crazy.”
“No, I’m—that’s not it, Cas,” said Dean. He cleared his throat and swallowed the acid. “I just—you sure about this? I mean, being human, it’s—”
Castiel stared, wide-eyed, at Sam, a mixture of heartache and incredible fondness swirling awkwardly in his chest. At some point he realized he’d been holding his breath, and he sighed it out and nodded at Sam, though his gaze dropped to stare at the table.
“I’m sure I will be, considering I don’t know what the surprise is,” said Castiel, a wry grin twisting his lips.
“Creation has no need to create!” Michael roared. He gripped Castiel by the collar of his t-shirt and forced him to the cliff’s edge, Castiel’s heels knocking pebbles over the side. “They do these things out of arrogance, not love! There is art here, Castiel, but unlike human art, it’s done without need for applause or approval. The bowerbird weaves beauty into its nest for no one—for no reason but to do it. The art here? The beauty? Without humans, it’s
Dean didn’t answer with words. He bruised a kiss into Castiel’s lips, and Castiel reciprocated, biting Dean’s lower lip and sucking it into his mouth before Dean did the same, over and over, until where one began and the other ended was a universal mystery. They gasped into each other’s kisses, stole the breath from each other’s lungs, and Dean slipped his fingers from Castiel, lining himself up against his entrance. “Okay?” he gasped.
“I’m sorry,” said Dean, the words coming out almost as a gasp. Castiel sat back and Dean pushed himself up to rest against the door. “Can’t believe I’m sayin’ this,” he mumbled, breathless, running his hands through his hair, “But I think I might be having a panic attack.”
“How long—aaaahhh,” Dean growled. He slammed his mug down on the counter and hissed when hot coffee splashed onto his hand. “How long ago did he leave?”
Sam nodded, then peered around Castiel to the piles of books and papers. “What are you doing, anyway?”
“I—you—too smart,” Sam stammered and mumbled, shaking his head. He turned back for the door again and yelled, “Dean!” pounding it again. On the third strike the door flew open.
Every sound went silent as a bright blue light, like a shockwave, pulsed away from Castiel’s. It sent Dean flying against the wall and knocked him out cold. The room went dark, save for a throbbing, angry neon blue in the front seat of the car. Castiel was flat on his back, an arm hanging off the seat, tendrils of grace spilling like blood from his chest like an open wound to the heart.
you. I want a normal life—whatever normal means for us—with you.” He thumbed at Dean’s cheeks, the skin flushing red beneath his fingers. “Is that too much to ask?”
“Why now?” Sam cut in, rising slowly, his voice still strained. “We’ve been out here vulnerable before. Why today? What’s different?”
“I need you,” Castiel whispered, finishing for Dean. He glanced back to check that Sam was sleeping, then ticked his head and mouthed, “Come on.”
In Dean’s head, Michael’s voice was coming to him as if through a tunnel, and his ears were ringing. Finally, when Michael snapped his fingers and the radio went silent, he managed to speak. Once more, the words felt thick and foreign, like they were rolling off someone else’s tongue. “How did you—”
“And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss,” Castiel said softly, a small smile ghosting over his lips. Dean’s brows lifted in question, and Castiel explained, “Romeo and Juliet…what spell is this? How long do we have?”
“Calm down, Samuel. We’re getting there,” she said. “Yes, I followed you. You’re not exactly subtle in that grumbling machine you call a car.” She paused, and then added flippantly, “And the tracking spell doesn’t hurt. Anyway—after I called you, Sam, I put on a cloaking spell and moseyed over here myself. Knew you’d show up before too long. As for the
Jack stared hard at Castiel, then looked to Sam again. Sam nodded, and Jack sighed in resignation, returning to his seat on the bed. “So we let you sacrifice yourself instead?”
“I don’t get it,” said Dean. He shook his head. “When Lucifer was possessing Cas there were two angels in one body and it didn’t seem to be that complicated.”
“I—” Dean began, but Castiel’s lips were too hungry, unwilling to part. Castiel swallowed Dean’s words, his hands moving too quickly and deftly down to Dean’s belt buckle. “Cas—” Dean tried again, but he couldn’t get the rest out—and part of him didn’t want to; wanted to stay in this moment of sensation.
“Uhh—soon. Very very soon.” He scrunched up his nose and looked to Sam. “Help me with some math, Sammy?”
Castiel stared, dumbfounded and silent, at the place where Michael had been moments before, his hand still outstretched.
The witch shrieked out another quick string of strange words and Castiel’s voice strangled in his throat. He fell to one knee, both hands coming up to claw madly at his temples.
“Excellent,” Rowena hushed, and for the first time she sounded anxious. She ceased her murmuring and the blue glow disappeared as Castiel pocketed the vial once more. Rowena backed away into the shadows, barely visible, and dropped to her knees before three spreads of magical ingredients: binding, silencing, protection.
“No, nope, that’s—sounds right to me Cas,” Sam said, practically beaming. Dean remained silent and slack-jawed, though his gaze hardened to something sinister at his brother.
“Sure,” answered Castiel. They loaded up their arms with hamburger buns, condiments, and bags of chips, and—at Sam’s behest—a few bottles of whiskey, and set out.
“No, Cas. I mean yes—I don’t know. I don’t know how to answer that question,” Dean struggled. He finally looked up to meet Castiel’s gaze, and his face fell as he did, eyes raking over the angel’s expression. “Oh, Cas…” he almost-whispered, broken.
“The thing!” Dean said, waving a hand at Castiel, whose head tilted further, lips parting, brows furrowing. “THAT!”
Dean didn’t speak, just stared slack-jawed, and Castiel sighed. He returned his hands to Dean’s shoulders to gently move him a step aside, then leaned down to turn on the sink and splash his own face until the water ran clear, then pat it dry. He turned back to Dean. “I’m asking you to stay with me.”
Silence settled over the car. Dean leaned into Castiel with a sigh and closed his eyes, content for the moment to relax against his angel, and Castiel seemed to savor the arrangement as well, face buried in Dean’s hair. Finally, Dean broke the silence with a little laugh through his nose, smirking. “You’re such a freakin’ romantic, Cas.”
Dean watched as he dragged out the old green cooler to the fridge and started filling it with ice. He pressed his lips and his brow creased with worry, but he swallowed it, turning his attention back to the cooking.
“I’ve been stealing the neighbor’s wifi,” she shrugged, and added with a smirk, “Anyway. Seems like you two could use some alone time.”
It finally happens for the first time—the real first time—in the least romantic way Cas could imagine. Not that he’s great at provoking scenes of idyllic romance anyway, but even he knew this wasn’t the way these things were supposed to go.
He finished the first stack—ten books and a handful of scrolls—in three hours. The bunker was still silent despite the afternoon hour, and Castiel was relieved. The longer the boys slept, the less he’d have to deal with worrying them. Another hour passed. Three PM and still, silence. Annoyed with the unhelpfulness of the second stack of books, Castiel rose and paced to the kitchen to make a large pot of coffee he didn’t really need. When it finished, he neglected a mug, instead opting to take the whole carafe back to the library with him.
“I’ll show you,” said Sam, watching Dean carefully. “Give me a minute, Rowena? There’s coffee in the kitchen. And some breakfast. Help yourself.”
The first thing Dean became aware of was the ringing in his ears and a throbbing headache. Sam’s voice was next, yelling his name. Then hands on his shoulders, shaking him gently—another voice. Jack. Sam and Jack were here. But not Castiel. Dean blinked his eyes open and found the blurred figure of his brother hovering over him, backlit by what overhead lights remained intact in the garage.
“Of course,” said Jack as he loped over. He tugged off one of Castiel’s shoes and tossed it aside, then the other, and then he looked up at Dean. “Dean…you’re bleeding.”
“Calm down, Samuel,” trilled Rowena, who’d been in the background packing a bag. “It’s only my ride.”
“What the Hell?” Sam called after Dean, but didn’t rise. A librarian shushed him again, and he rolled his eyes, muttering to himself, again, “Idiot.”
“You don’t think I can tell when your walls go up?” hushed Castiel. His hands lifted to Dean’s face to thumb at his cheeks. “I know you well, Dean Winchester. Well enough to know when you’re running. I’m asking you not to.”
Dean shook his head. “Just curious.” He looked around again, and then to Castiel. “This one of the ‘tomorrow’ plans for your temporary wings?”
“We’re contacting someone in Hell, boys,” said Rowena, obviously. “We need the closest thing to demon blood we can get.”
The whispery laugh sounded again, but before Belial could speak, Dean managed to add, “Against Michael.”
“Are you sure you want to go there?” Dean warned, and then threw up his hands, accusing, “Can we just work the job, please? I swear, man, it’s like you want to fight.”
Jack’s legs kicked out awkwardly as he shifted to look down. Sam just barely dodged one of his feet, and Castiel ducked on instinct. The next time Jack swung a leg, Sam caught his foot, instructing him. Castiel turned around to look for Dean and when they made eye contact, they both smiled. A peaceful warmth inflated Dean’s chest as Castiel said something to Dean, the words lost in the rustling leaves, and then started walking away—towards the table where Dean sat.
Dean sniffed and started to pad away down the hall. “No part of our lives is even remotely legal anyway,” he said. “And I wanna change and then eat.”
“S’okay. I like it,” said Dean. And then, “Do want some champagne though, or whatever it is.” He reached for the glasses and Castiel nodded, going for the champagne bottle and uncorking it with ease.
Dean grunted a little into the kiss, breaking it just a bit to rub his nose against Castiel’s. “You’ll have to eat,” he said.
“Annoying,” Michael’s voice groaned. “What’s it going to be, Dean? You said ‘yes’ for Sam. You won’t do the same to save your dear Castiel?”
Dean bolted for the door so quickly he forgot to pay, a high-pitched beeping and the annoyed stare of a lazy teenage cashier following him out.
“Say that again, but slowly,” said Dean, attempting his typical nonchalance and sarcasm—anything to make himself feel normal.
“Okay, let’s do this,” said Dean. He and Sam thunked the chairs down and they echoed in the empty stone room. Jack wandered in behind them, trying his best to look stoic and brave—like a Winchester.
“What are you talking about?” said Dean, attempting nonchalance, but panic was tightening his chest. “Why wouldn’t it?”
“Cas is missing, and you kept me—” Dean started, but cut himself off as he tried to stand, his body weak and head woozy.
“No, Cas. ‘Course not,” said Dean, voice strained, almost a whisper. He shook his head and looked away from Castiel, but the angel didn’t release his grip. “I worry…”
Castiel clenched his fingers around Dean’s hip and hand, and then withdrew almost all the way, gasping as he did. He rolled back in and moaned, slow and heady. Back out—a moan from Dean. Back in, and he bit down hard on Dean’s shoulder.
“It’s painful,” said Castiel. “In multiple ways, but…” Jack slipped into the room proper and sank to a knee beside Castiel, placing a hand on his shoulder. The angel looked up and managed a fond, if tired, smile for his son. “No, I don’t think it’s dangerous. I think it’s just something I need to ride out.”
“That old chestnut?” the woman spoke, her lips curling evilly. “I thought we were beyond questioning reality, Dean.”
When they made it upstairs, Dean disappeared for a long, hot shower, and while he did, Castiel rifled through one of Dean’s drawers to find some dry clothes, borrowing some jeans and boxers and a light gray Henley. The shower was still going when he was dressed, so Castiel wandered out into the hall and to the kitchen, where he found Sam hunched over a book and a mug of coffee, looking haggard.
The voice returned. “Now you’ve got it!” It taunted. A shadowy, man-like figure appeared behind Cas, its hand suddenly visible, wrapped around Cas’s mouth, the other on the side of his head. The blue light of angelic grace pulsed dully within the featureless shadow, who tilted what was probably his head. “Did you think this would be so easy? That I wouldn’t return?”
,” said Sam. “We couldn’t get you to stop. So I need to know you’ve got your head on straight before I unlock you.”
“On it,” Dean replied, abandoning the jars. He went to lean over Castiel, nudging Rowena out of the way.
in ways the other angels didn’t seem to, so I kept it to myself, but—seeing your soul that first time in Hell? Beaten as it was, it was holy. It made me whole.”
Castiel turned to walk toward the door, leaving Dean scrambling. He turned his head to eye the desk drawer that held the ring, and turned back to call out, “Cas, wait!” But his voice was a hoarse whisper, and the angel had already disappeared into the dark of the hallway. “Damnit,” he whispered to himself, and followed Castiel out.
“Hmmph,” Castiel laughed through his lips, dropping his hand. He looked over at Dean and exhaled a happy sigh. “I love you.”
A throbbing headache pulled Dean from sleep, and he startled when he found himself in his bed. He sat up with a groan and the room spun so badly he had to press a foot to the floor to keep from tipping over, still drunk from the night before. A low, sick groan escaped his lips and he nearly gagged when the smell of his own whiskey-thick breath reached his nostrils. Dean closed his eyes to steady himself and glanced at the clock. Nine AM. He reached for his phone on the nightstand and scrolled through to reread for the thousandth time the last texts he’d gotten from Cas, days and days ago, when they’d been fighting:
The mind is a powerful thing. Especially for an angel. And someone had fingers deep in Castiel’s cerebellum, rearranging the folds of his memory, rewiring the parts they didn’t like. What they forgot, though, is that Cas had been in a human body for a long time, and even though much of it was still foreign, still strange, much of it wasn’t. The mind is a powerful thing, but so is the heart—and too much heart was, as many had said, always Castiel’s problem. Angels weren’t meant to feel the things he felt; angels weren’t meant to love—especially not a soldier, and this time, when Dean spoke, that human muscle in Castiel’s chest overrode the mechanic in his mind.
Dean shook his head. “Nah, I like it. It’s—I dunno. Classic Cas.” He paused, then added, “Not that I don’t like how your hair is now.”
“Like I drank a fifth of bourbon,” Dean grumbled, eyes still squeezed shut. His voice was rough with sleep. “And then got hit by a bus.” He opened his eyes and tried to sit up but blew out a stream of air instead and sank back down to throw his hand over his face. “And dizzy.”
Rowena set them up in the dungeon, surrounded by Devil’s traps and warding sigils. Instead of the interrogation chair, in the center of the trap was a small, round table draped in a black cloth with white occult markings. In the middle, a bronze goblet etched with more sigils. Four black candles flanked the goblet, a black scrying mirror was propped behind it, and a silver ritual knife sat near the edge.
“There has to be something,” said Jack. He reached to put a hand on Castiel’s sleeve, and the angel’s shoulders slouched. “There has to be some kind of hope. Dean wouldn’t just give up.”
“Okay,” said Jack, and turned around to face stacks of books and papers scattered across the library floor. “Uhh. Which one?”
Michael wrenched Castiel to his feet, and Dean could just barely see his face over the mist now. The archangel leaned in, his lips at Castiel’s ear, but his eyes on Dean. “I told you, Castiel” he murmured. “Since you love humans so much, it’s only fitting you’ll die like one.”
“I think so,” said Castiel. He knit his brows in an odd kind of confusion. “It’s been a long time since—well, since the last time I was human. The memories are fuzzy.” As if on cue, Castiel’s stomach gave a loud, irritated growl, and his lips turned up in a half smile. “Yes, I’m hungry.”
“I got it!” said Jack, dropping his can of spray paint to hurry to the air conditioning unit on the wall.
“I think so,” said Castiel, and his eyes shot over Sam’s shoulder as Jack arrived, holding a phone to his ear.
“Watch over Sam,” he commanded. “If something goes wrong, get him out of here.” Jack advanced again, stubborn, and Castiel lowered his chin. “Don’t make me put you under too, Jack. You’re no good to Sam unconscious.”
Castiel smiled back, the first real one he’d managed in months. “He would,” he agreed. “I’ll bring some back if we—when we’re coming back with Dean.”
“And you’ll be cooking?” Castiel asked as Dean pulled away. He arched his brows in a look so uncharacteristically full of human excitement it made Dean melt.
Dean blinked. “The record player in my head?” And then, with understanding, “…right, the song. I knew that.”
necessary collateral for Michael’s untouched grace, but that didn’t mean Michael was doing Castiel any favors. He was human, after all, and Michael had better things to do than babysit. And he knew Michael made Eden his home base, but he didn’t stay there. He hopped worlds almost constantly—trying to build an army or an empire, no doubt—and came back for a day once a week to make sure Castiel was alive.
Dean snorted again and shoved Castiel back, kicking off the blankets. He stretched again as he stood and padded slowly for the bathroom, then glanced back to Castiel sitting cross-legged on the bed in some of Dean’s pajamas, pouting. A swell of fondness inflated his chest and he leaned against the frame. “Hey.”
Castiel slid into the backseat and across the far side so that he was behind Rowena, Dean’s legs spread limply across the seat behind Sam. He wrapped his arms around Dean’s shoulders, angling his body so Dean’s head rested gently against his chest. The whole drive back to the hotel Castiel pressed his lips to Dean’s ear, whispering Enochian words of love and grief.
A soft purplish light settled like a haze over the room, and Michael’s face contorted like he was choking. “What—” he coughed, and then his eyes rolled back, and his head hung forward. The archangel was bound and silent.
Castiel cracked a little smile as the trio dissolved into silence. The sun was warm on his face, and in spite of what the evening promised to bring, he felt happy—his lover, his brother, both here and healthy and whole, seeing something no human had witnessed before. The scene filled him with a strange surge of pride, and after a moment he cleared his throat, scuffed the toe of his sneaker into the rock below. “We have some time,” he said. Both boys turned to look his way. “I could—you know—show you around.”
Castiel felt a familiar ache shuttle through his being—perhaps the grace made his projection more real, or perhaps it was because he was the one doing the work of infiltrating Dean’s mind. Whatever it was, he felt every moment of it, intense as ever. But the grace was working on him another way: his patience. His restraint. Castiel wasn’t used to such power, and it was desperate for an outlet. The ache suddenly flared into a barely controllable rage.
Castiel leaned in closer, pressing his forehead to Dean’s. “We don’t have to fight,” he soothed quietly. “Just talk to me, Dean. Tell me what you want.”
Dean hid in the shadow of the hallway and watched the entire interaction. He’d made a show of being preoccupied with digging through a box for his cassettes when Cas left to go to the kitchen, and then followed a few minutes later. Now, listening to them, he regretted it: what if Cas was right, and he was dead? Maybe all Billie’s talk about having work for him was bullshit—some kind of cruel trick to get back at him for all the times he’d cheated death—lull him into complacency with promises of purpose, then rip the carpet out from beneath his feet. He didn’t put it above her to play that kind of game.
“That—y’know. Telling me what to do thing. Not that I’m complaining, just—that’s usually your go-to ‘I gotta put the fear into some demons’ voice.”
Dean swallowed and glanced across at Sam, and the sight almost made him want to vomit: his little brother, brave in the face of everything, had sunk down out of his chair and was on his knees in the floor, palms pressed hard to either side of his temple, and it occurred to Dean that he was cowering. He hazarded a look behind him at Jack who was rooted to his chair, unblinking and seemingly unbreathing, stiff as a statue and almost as pale. Rowena, for her part, had backed away from the table and was hidden away somewhere in the dark, out of sight.
The old man smiled a little, and added, “I remember when her first color film came out in the sixties. Boy, I swear, I saw men leave their wives at the drive-in—and she had to be fifty years old by then. Man, she was a fox. Those eyes were so blue they’d break your heart.”
Somehow, the sides of Belial’s mouth twisted grotesquely into what one might otherwise consider a smile. “Amara,” he said. “That’s a name not been uttered in my presence in millennia. Tell me, how do you know of Amara?”
A stinging palm connecting with his cheek interrupted his panic, cleared away the mist. “Dean! Snap out of it, man!”
Sam sat in the kitchen, drinking the last dregs of the morning’s coffee with his lunch while he absently scrolled through the local news, looking for cases. Across from him, Jack was pouring his third (or fourth) bowl of brightly-colored, sugary cereal of the day. The noise made Sam look up from his reading, and he sighed.
“No you don’t,” said Sam simply, slamming the door. Before Dean could make a counter-argument he’d started the car, and Dean slid into the passenger seat in defeat.
Dean nodded, and Sam turned for the stairwell. With a groan and a glance toward the grace in the cabinet, Dean slowly followed behind.
“I need silence,” said Rowena, rolling her shoulders. “And darkness. Jack—be a dear and get the lights, would you?” While Jack obliged, Rowena leaned in and brought some matches up from a pocket, lighting the four black candles. The room was plunged into darkness, save the flame, and as Jack was seated Rowena repeated herself. “Silence,” she said. And, with a pointed look at Dean, “And restraint.”
Castiel blinked at Sam, mouth agape, but Sam waved his hand in a beckoning motion to the angel, repeating, “Poughkeepsie,” and Castiel joined in. Together, they formed a strange Poughkeepsie chorus, and finally, Dean’s head began to lift.
After what must have been at least the eighth Bunker blackout in half as many weeks, Sam had figured it out, and was over it. He ignored it most of the time since they tended to occur at predictable times—early morning or late night, mostly—and he made up something for Jack about “old wiring,” but he suspected that Jack had figured it out too, considering Dean and Castiel never seemed to be around when they happened.
“That could take weeks,” Dean answered. “We do it your way, we need to call in backup. We can’t hunt four things—that we even know of—at once.”
“Long enough,” answered Dean calmly. He left his place and walked over to collect the book from across the room, dusting away shards of broken glass. “What’s going on man?”
Michael stared at Castiel, and Castiel pushed the blade ever so slightly further. From somewhere behind, Sam yelled, “Cas, don’t!” Though his voice sounded thick and watery behind the protection spell.
“I’m going to give you this wee bit of Michael’s archangel grace,” she said. “And in return, if you catch wind of my future exploits and you find them
It was the warmth that roused Castiel from unconsciousness—warmth that spread across his face and the skin of his naked arms, contrasted sharply with the cold dampness leaching into his t-shirt and jeans from below. He wondered, briefly, if he was dead—then he heard the birds. A songbird—a wren, he thought—or perhaps a lark or finch. Briefly, it occurred to Castiel that had he had his grace, he’d know which birds were singing, and even be able to translate and join them in song, and for the first time since losing his power, he felt bitter over its absence. He lay still and took in his surroundings in darkness: the tickle of six legs crawled over the back of a hand, prompting him to curl his fingers into the dampness—grass, he discovered; somewhere nearby, the soft gurgling of a river or stream.
This,” Castiel swiped his hand out at the stacks of books, “is all completely useless. I either know it all already because, angel, or it’s just got nothing.”
“Dean, of course he is,” said Sam gently. “Unless you know something we don’t—but he texted me a few days ago about a case in Poughkeepsie.”
