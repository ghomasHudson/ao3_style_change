The trick, he already realised, was to make it Sherlock’s idea. To offer something Sherlock could not have. Something forbidden.
John hurried over and dropped beside him. He loosened Sherlock’s collar as best he could as the man jerked beneath him, one arm flailing hard and landing against the gate with a crack.
Instead, he stared at Sherlock, who stared back in challenge.
John knows what he’s up to. He’s no fool, and even though Sherlock puts on a very convincing show, John doesn’t really believe that he is tired of the dirty streets and alleys, or worried about the rising crime statistics, or getting too old for the hustle and bustle, or one half as intrigued by dodgy vicars as he pretends. It’s all for John, and the only thing that rings true is his fixation on bees and hives and his stated plans to install a half dozen and take up beekeeping.
No, he was IN a tree. A very large tree. With an extensive canopy and several main trunks and lots of leaves and twigs and branches to catch on clothing and ropes and parachute parts.
“Her injuries aren’t detailed,” John noted with a frown. “But the treatment she’s receiving – poison?”
“They’re looking at Rosie,” John whispered. “And no one cares about your buttons.”
“No.” He definitely was finding his voice. He kept his eyes on John, not moving, and John felt a bit like a bug under a microscope.
John laughs again. A sharp intake of breath and a sound that is mirthful only in a dark and hopeless world.
The General had died in his sleep, naked and flat on his back in Irene Adler’s bed.
John tried to wait patiently while Severus was sorting out Scorpius. The door wasn’t fully closed, and try as he did to distract himself, he still heard the two speaking loud and clear.
Bringing the new patients to the garden was Molly’s idea.
“That? You pick up on that and not the curry? I think we need to stop eating so much take-away.”
“Dr. Watson.”
He shifted in his seat, grimacing in pain as the car bounced along a road that could only generously be called maintained. He’d been met at the train station in Yorkshire more than an hour ago, and had barely had time to stretch his sore muscles and try to work the stiffness out of his leg and shoulder before he was being ushered into a car by a grey-suited driver, impatient to deliver him to his new assignment.
when Mycroft Holmes had the resources of bloody England behind him?
“John - the torch,” he whispered. “Turn it off.”
He had the chance for another question before Sherlock had his turn, though, capturing a third pawn.
He waited for Sherlock to come to his senses - the disorientation following a seizure was always troubling for the patient. John knew better than to hurry Sherlock through it. Five minutes passed, and John stayed where he was, speaking quietly to his friend and checking to assure that Sherlock was breathing and had a steady heart rate.
Anderson shifted. He glanced at Sholto. “We’ve got to stop wasting time,” he said tersely. “Don’t for one minute think the Germans are sitting on their arses waiting for us to catch up now that they think the Magpie is out of the picture.”
Sherlock grinned. “Remember the anti-gravity shoes?”
Billy and Mrs. Hudson exchanged a glance. A worried glance that held something John could not interpret.
He was wound up so tightly inside, angry, just barely suppressing the incredulity of it all, that his words were sharp-edged, his voice clipped.
But somehow, traipsing through a man’s inner sanctum felt all wrong.
Sherlock glared, John grinned and back at the Ministry, the very fit Mycroft stepped into a lift, glanced around to make sure he was alone, and let his hands roam over his backside once again and vowed to throw out every ounce of Honeyduke’s chocolate in his office.
“What? You’re disappointed that he sneezed?” asked John.
The man was so utterly exasperating – brilliant one moment, sulking the next, acting out in front of John’s superior officers.
How hard it would be to give this up – for the cause. For the greater good. For England.
Sherlock was paying no attention at all to Peeves, a very dangerous oversight indeed. In a move so unexpected that Sherlock had no time to take evasive action, Peeves made a beeline from the stairway toward Sherlock and upended the goldfish bowl over his head.
“It’s a bee button, Dad.” Rosie had bent down and picked up a silver-coloured button from the grass at her feet. “You’re shedding buttons, Sherlock!” she called up. “You should try to keep still!”
John couldn’t help smiling. “Extremely.”
Molly looked over at him, and he turned his head to meet her gaze. He might have expected a pitying look, but it was understanding he saw, and he looked away, ashamed that he’d expected something less.
“I suppose it’s good that all my new followers know you’re off the market now, yeah?”
And off they’d gone, rapidly discussing his injury, nerve damage, therapy, recovery potential and whether the better course of action might be to give up on the left hand altogether and instead concentrate on working with the right until it became his new dominant hand.
John was torn. Sherlock obviously wasn’t going to tell him what he really needed. But did John, given his already crumbling resolve to treat their relationship properly and professionally, really want to know what Sherlock needed from him?
Molly’s laugh, when it came, was surprising and very welcome.
“You are to avail yourself of Miss Hooper’s services as well. And that, Dr. Watson, is an order.”
He’d had roommates all through uni and med school, girlfriends too, even lived with one for those last months before he’d joined up. Then his mates in the army. Never a moment alone there. Never a chance to feel alone either, no matter how
“Think about it John -
Lestrade nodded and gasped out a single word.
“Your reward was staying off the front lines,” Mycroft stated dismissively.
He watched as Sherlock rolled slowly onto his stomach, then laboriously pushed himself up on hands and knees. He paused, took several deep breaths, then dropped into an awkward seated position against the bed, still breathing heavily. John watched him without offering to help, realising that the man wouldn’t appreciate being babied, and had doubtlessly righted himself from this same position dozens of times previous.
He didn’t see Sherlock lean back in his chair, or steeple his hands before his face in the contemplative pose he so often fell into. He leaned down, then, and picked John’s cane off the floor, resting it against a chair.
Sherlock didn’t look up. He was staring through his steepled fingers.
“Dr. Watson – we’ve been expecting you.”
“Music!” he exclaimed. “We shall have music!”
John wasn’t sorry to see Holmes’ car driving away the next morning. The staff acted differently when he was on site – jumpy, on edge. There seemed to be a universal sigh of relief when he was gone, and life soon returned to what passed for normal at Rosethorne Manor.
“No!” he slammed the door shut and ran outside as quickly as possible. They were obviously looking for their wiz sticks so they could ebolagate him.
He’d given then conditions, after all. Conditions designed to protect Sherlock’s health and recovery. And here they were, on the first day, flaunting those very conditions and threatening Sherlock’s health and recovery. Never mind that Sherlock did more to inhibit his own recovery than an extra hour or two in meetings would do.
“Good Morning, Dr. Watson,” she crooned, reaching down to brush the bottom of his chin with the tips of her fingers. “I wondered when you’d find your way here.”
He didn’t have to call Sherlock or John or Molly to his room for a briefing. Sherlock was at his door within fifteen minutes of his arrival.
John didn’t bother to argue about how desperately – or not – he needed her help. “Everything about this assignment is odd,” he said, choosing his words carefully. “But I’m no one special – nothing special. The army’s not about to invest extra resources in me.”
It was ridiculous. He was a grown man. Rosethorne was a mere blip in the timeline of his life.
Mycroft nodded, the barest movement of his head, but when John reached the door, he spoke again.
And he was looking at John, and how could anyone in the room have missed the way his voice choked on the words?
While Sherlock was engaged in button counting, John held up his own robes.
He reached for another sandwich, helping himself to two then topping off his tea. He was aware, as he added milk and methodically stirred it in, that the room had become very quiet.
“I have an idea,” he said a moment later, standing in the kitchen doorway and smiling pleasantly at Mycroft. “Let’s go out for tea.”
“It would be made well - our great-grandfather was a da Vinci manque of sorts. His specialty was clocks….” He manuevered himself inside the piece as he spoke and looked between the shelf he’d indicated and the one below it. “There’s a torch on the table in the corner of the workroom. Would you…?”
John smiled and wiped his eyes again. Wanky janky sounded like a euphemism for shagging.
“Alright – two of us. I’ll go up to London that Friday and stay over with Rosie. Sherlock can stay here and look after the bees.”
It came so naturally after that.
have something to say about Sherlock’s performance.
It had seemed – still seemed – an impossibility to even dream of being a surgeon again. Too much was at risk – too many lives. One missed stroke, one fumble with an instrument, and he’d lose much more than his dignity, suffer much more than mere frustration and embarrassment.
“There are too many fathers.”
“What? What do you need then?”
said the voice in his head.
Sherlock let out a weak chuckle.
He had questions. Dozens of questions. But they would wait ‘til morning, or even longer. If this was Sherlock Holmes, sleep deprived and suffering the after-effects of three seizures, what would the man be like at full throttle?
decided to grace them with a visit.
“Not an eclipse,” John said with a sigh. “Have you deleted astronomy again?”
“But – you must be tired now. It’s the middle of the night and you’ve just had – ”
By brute force of will, calling upon the discipline he’d lost of late, but that he’d practiced the entirety of his adult life, he adhered to a strict schedule for those first long weeks. Weeks when he slept the night through without a call to go to Sherlock – to help him through a seizure – real or feigned. Up early for a brisk walk, breakfast, rounds, treatments, an hour in the music room coaxing tunes from the piano with his inadequate fingers, then lunch, more rounds, a game of chess in the mid afternoon.
John leaned in to examine the buttons on the cuff – perfect little honeybees, silver in colour. He stared at them a long time but they didn’t even tremble, much less buzz.
“Home!” Rosie announced. Hamish, standing between Sherlock’s legs with Sherlock supporting him around the middle, squealed his delight and bopped Sherlock on the head with a set of plastic keys. Sherlock caught Al’s eye as he struggled in laden with packages.
John squeezed his hand again in acknowledgment. “I suppose we could clean this place up and have private candlelight dinners in the dining room.”
“Ugh. The name a’gin,” John said, grabbing the handcuffs from Sherlock. “Jesus -
“Phone me,” Sherlock says, then rattles off the number. The man gives him the oddest smile – half indulgent, half amazement – as he complies, pressing in the numbers and waiting, expectantly, until Sherlock’s own mobile, in his own pocket, begins to sound.
sources. You wouldn’t be here if he hadn’t found you suitable for me, if he didn’t think we’d work well together.”
And then, with the mark from the instructor and a whoop of glee, Rosie was gone and Al was in position. The instructor’s hands were all over John and John stood stoically as Sherlock shouted something to Severus he couldn’t make out as he automatically took the position Al had just vacated – with a whoop to rival Rosie’s.
“Do you think they think she killed him?” Molly edged her chair a bit closer and lowered her voice.
“This doesn’t have to be a game, you realise,” he said. “I’m quite happy to practice, and you could just tell me about Sholto.”
221B greets them.  It’s silent as a tomb, the furniture enshrined in dust-covered sheets. They stumble through and John drags them both to Sherlock’s bedroom.  They fall together onto the stripped-down bed and cling to each other in relief, holding tight to solid belief beneath their fingertips.
John glanced around the room, at the wrapped presents under the tree, the shredded wrapping paper, the opened gifts his friends had brought his daughter, the empty wine glasses.
John grinned. “Was he wearing the jumper?”
“Come, walk with me around the garden,” he demanded as he set off down the outer path, and John, surprised, hurried to catch up. “And tell me more about Lestrade. Is he really mute? Does he make any sounds at all?”
He wondered if he’d gone too far, but Mycroft only laughed.
The attacker, however, was stronger than he looked and soon had John pinned to the bed.
They landed precisely where he meant to take them, dead-center in a wide swath of grass – the designated Apparition zone – a few meters from the gate. He let go of Mycroft’s hand when he had his footing, and the child immediately teetered, fell over onto his side, curled up into a foetal position, and let out an unholy scream.
He expected to see Greg Lestrade, or the old gardener from the village who came now and then to help out, but it was Mycroft Holmes who was approaching, dressed in traveling clothes, and looking completely out of place despite being the master of the manor.
“I wanted to thank you – for the use of the music room,” he began after a prolonged silence, back still turned. He took his time closing up his bag, then turned to face Holmes, for he wanted to see the man’s face when he answered. Holmes had stopped studying his toe and was looking at John with interest. “I’ve noticed that someone else is using the room,” he continued. “Who would that be?”
“Or course.” John had no intention of bringing Sherlock out any earlier – he was nervous enough even this late in the day. “Hat and glasses – we need to get back inside.”
The significance of her statement finally began to sink in.
But why?
He looked away, and John knew there was more he wasn’t saying, but he didn’t pursue it. And after a moment, Sherlock continued.
John had an idea, an idea Sherlock would very likely summarily reject.
They intrude on him when he’s having his tea or sitting in the garden with the newspaper. The door opens and a startled looking man peeks in on him, then hurriedly closes the door. He’s getting out of the tub, stepping carefully onto the mat, when the door to the bathroom swings open and an elderly woman gazes at him in shock, then pulls the door shut again. Once he is sleeping and the cupboard door opens to a young woman in a bridal gown, clearly not expecting to stumble upon an old man’s bedchamber.
Lestrade managed the single word, almost a whisper, then fell silent again.
“I didn’t tumble off a roof three weeks ago onto a flock of sheep.”
Sherlock, however, had paused to crouch down beside a flower bed. He pushed away a layer of leaves to expose new green shoots. “I knew them once,” he murmured. “Common and scientific names. Genus and family.”
Mycroft would be appalled.
“You’re hardly a citizen, Mycroft,” Sherlock called out.
The months pass slowly with Sherlock away and John left behind at Rosethorne.
- to see for himself, assess for himself.
John stills against him, then pushes himself up until he is looking into Sherlock’s eyes. They stare at each other.
“I’ve told you already – sleep is difficult.” Sherlock’s foot began to jiggle. “Especially with Mycroft lingering on and on.”
He turned away, then stepped outside without waiting for an answer, pulling the door closed behind him.
“You said you need to do something,” he said after a few more quiet moments. “What did you mean?”
“Ancient history,” John said, voice falsely bright. “So, anyone for pudding? I made treacle tart.”
Oddly, though, he wasn’t quite ready to share that with Sherlock.
“I didn’t ask to be dead!” Sherlock snapped. He settled back into his chair, trying for aloof. “It’s very distracting.”
“Those are real buttons,” John said, watching as Sherlock worked to fasten them. “With button-holes. Not just decoration.”
His hand throbbed, the pain still biting. He tried to ignore it as he supported Sherlock, finally letting him roll onto his back as the seizure finally ended.
“Do you know what is in those packages, John?” asked Sherlock, folding his hands behind his head and looking upward to study the clouds.
The tree was sad – it had likely been cut down in October and shipped in from out of country, and as he’d waited until December 23rd to make his purchase, the selection was slim and the quality of that inadequate selection disheartening. The poor thing stood only four feet tall on tip toes, and listed to one side so severely that he’d had to prop up one leg of the stand with a book to even it all out. And, as they’d never before had a tree at 221B, decorations were ad hoc at best. He hadn’t exactly thought of how he’d get from bare needles to festive décor when he’d bought the tree on a whim on the way home from the clinic – he’d only caught the scent of the trees in passing and found himself transported to a frosty Christmas morning when he was six years old.
But she’d be coming here on Saturday morning for breakfast before they left together for the wedding.
This disquiet – this seething
It was the singular most unusual request John had ever had.
seen a change in Sherlock –when John came to fetch him every day at four o’clock, an hour after Molly left to do afternoon physio with her patients, Sherlock actually noticed when John knocked at the door. He seemed genuinely pleased to see John, ready to be done with the work and to get on with the more pleasant parts of the day. Sherlock looked healthier all around, and though the seizures continued, they’d not worsened in severity.
“Oh.” Sherlock tried to hide a smirk, but John saw it, and narrowed his eyes in suspicion. “Well – I said I’d swear you were with me. I mean, of course, I will swear to my brother. He’ll in turn provide you a workable alibi.”
John had an idea that this mystery wasn’t a mystery at all. Not for Sherlock. John would wager, from Sherlock’s initial reaction at seeing the key, that he’d seen it before, or had lost one like it himself. Still, he went along with it and played the game. “I have no idea how you do that – but yes, it was in a tree. In an old tree house, actually – well, under the ruins of the platform, in the bowl made where the trunk split. I put my hand on it by accident, and when I saw what it was, I pocketed it. I thought it interesting. But now I know that the gardener had a whole ring of them when you were a boy, so it’s hardly unique.”
“Pillow, Mrs. Hudson, please,” he called out, almost automatically. How many other times had he done this? Grabbed for a pillow, positioned it just so under his wife’s head? He waited, wiggling his fingers until Mrs. Hudson hurried over to the bed, then pressed a pillow into his outstretched hand.
“Not necessarily,” he answered. “I would have approached you with my reservations about releasing Miss Adler if my examination had given me reason to believe she needed additional recovery time.”
Molly Hooper took a seat behind the desk, picked up a fountain pen, then opened a leather notebook and made a careful notation on a blank page, all without looking at John or acknowledging him at all. She studied what she had written, the finally lifted her gaze to meet his own.
“Will anyone else be coming to help them here?” It wasn’t the top question on his list, but it seemed an acceptable one.
his sister had accused.
,” laughed Rosie. “Granny Molly – look who I have.”
“What is the Wizarding world’s most popular deodorant?” Snape asked, in the same tone of voice one might use when asking what was on the menu for lunch.
John captured a piece first. He set the pawn to the right of the board, considering. He’d not played a game like this one before, and hesitated to ask the questions that interested him most. Better to see where Sherlock went with his own questions and ask something relatively safe, innocuous.
“Really. And Severus is a brilliant wiz – wizfit.”
“What are
John had to agree with him. Those four-inch heels were not sinking into the earth at all.
“What – with M15?”
“Alright – Sherlock, then.” Sherlock made no sign to acknowledge the concession. “Try to sleep, please. I know you’ll find that your brain will work better once you’ve given it a rest. You’ve just had three episodes, and - ”
“Natural conditions?” he repeated. “As opposed to?”
They passed in the entry hall, and he instinctively reached out to take her arm. Not yet fully recovered from her illness, she was clearly overtired and weakened by the long day.
“Stop it. The only reason you don’t like her is because she’s got better hair than you do.”
“He can work no more than four hours a day, preferably in two sessions with a significant break between. A minimum of three hours each day spent out of doors, walking or gardening or doing some sort of physical exercise that doesn’t tax his brain. Regular meals, plenty of water, no alcohol, and a minimum of eight hours of sleep each night. He’ll benefit as well from a regular schedule – I’m willing to set one and try to enforce it.”
“Could you wait and have William and Rosie scatter us together, then? You can speak Spanish but I can’t.”
Mycroft’s gaze hardened. “They’ve made little progress in the interim. His methods are unorthodox - yet his results, to date, are flawless. It hasn’t been easy to pick up the pieces and continue since the team often can’t understand their starting point. You understand, Dr. Watson?”
He wasn’t an expert, and had never even seen a secret drawer in a desk, much less a secret door in a wardrobe. But it stood to reason that if the wardrobe was hiding the entrance to a tunnel, the back panel of the wardrobe must be false, and removing it had to be simple enough for a single person to manage. He opened the doors and began to examine the panel. It was a solid piece of the same dark wood that made up the rest of the wardrobe, and had no knotholes or flaws that John could see. He ran his hands around the edges, pushing inward, and feeling a bit ridiculous for his efforts. When he gave up on the rear panel, he turned to examine the shelves on either side. He thought he saw a knob on the top right shelf, but soon realised it was just a discarded drawer pull.
And John had already issued a prescription - a healthy mind is tied to a healthy body. The brain heals itself by making new connections, new conduits. Those new connections and conduits were strengthened and enhanced by a strong, active body.
Sherlock blinked, then turned his head quickly and wrapped his hand around John’s neck and kissed him exuberantly.
A vague smile was his only acknowledgement.
Lestrade, mute Lestrade, whose mouth was moving, breathing a barely audible word, but a word nonetheless.
“My father?” he repeated, more harshly than he’d intended. “Why?”
John rolled his eyes. “I hate that list.”
Rosie inched up closer to Al and rested her head on his shoulder as they walked.
John didn’t even bother to pretend he wasn’t watching the clock.
He smiled, fingers still trying out the keys, and wondered why he’d never thought of this himself.
John looked up, startled. His cane? Where had he left it now? Sherlock laughed.
To summarise, he wasn’t taking it well.
Is anyone else having a helluva time writing during the airing of new episodes of Sherlock? Incredibly  hard to keep these guys in character now, so please pardon any slips. I'll reread when my blood pressure goes back down and try to fix missteps. My plan was to publish new chapters after each new episode to offer something that you have reasonable confidence will end well. I'm so grateful I have a fellow fandom fan coming over next week to hold my hand during The Final Problem. Ugh.
Molly cleared her throat.
“You prefer – what? Dodging traffic in London?”
And how the
He found it with little effort, just off the workroom. It was small and bare, but clean enough. John gave the toilet a flush - it did the job, though slowly. He tested the taps - the flow wasn’t strong, but warm water did appear after half a minute. There was paper, a rubbish bin and two white hand towels and a stingy bar of soap. Checking the cupboard behind the mirror, he found the shelves bare, so he mentally composed a list of supplies - plasters and disinfectants, the basic medications and supplies for common ailments and first aid. A medical kit similar to the one he kept upstairs.
. This – this
“Yes! Exactly that - it was brilliant! But it makes no sense. Less than an hour ago, you were convulsing on the floor. Your brain should be a chaotic mess still - foggy and unfocused. Look at how you’re moving, Sherlock. As if every muscle in your body hurts. You’re considering each step before you take it, and you’re careful to lean against things for extra support because you’re weak and sore from the uncontrolled muscle movements. The only reason you’re up at all is that the attack was mild, and didn’t last very long. But regardless- your brain should not be so - so -
For two days, John spent nearly all of his free time walking the lawns and gardens of Rosethorne Manor, exploring the grounds and looking for the best place to bring Sherlock. He’d love to get into the locked garden, but simply couldn’t risk approaching Lestrade for the key. He’d walked as much of the perimeter of the stone wall surrounding the gardens as he could, and hadn’t found another gate, though the walls were often covered with robust ivy, with wild and overgrown bushes pushing up against the vines. Despite what Lestrade had managed to tame around the manor house, Rosethorne still suffered the effects of long neglect.
It was, if John had to guess, an old garden maze. Or had been. Made of hedges once carefully squared off and angled in intricate patterns.
“Teak? Oh. You mean…?” John was catching on now,
But it
Sherlock, who’d seated himself beside Bill’s wife Fleur and was listening raptly to her and nodding and smiling as she expounded on goblin hygiene, didn’t even turn his head at Mycroft’s very out-of-character display. John was torn between examining Mycroft for concussion and elbowing Sherlock out of the way to take his own rightful place beside Fleur.
Lunch at the Burrow was even more raucous and chaotic than John remembered, as the Weasleys had grown in number by a factor of three, with spouses and children and the occasional friend mixed in. The old house had risen to the challenge, expanding to allow extra space for napping babies and extra people at the table. When Molly rang the dinner bell, Mycroft trudged in with the rest of the Quidditch players, mud-covered and exhilarated, and sporting a black eye.
Ginny Potter scratched her neck and looked at the ground, hiding a smile.
Sherlock was an adult. He didn’t need John – or anyone – to fret over a past that he’d clearly put behind him.
“He’s done it! He was crying and you weren’t going to him so I went in to get him and his dummy was in his mouth!”
“I want to see papers before I leave,” he said. “A handshake agreement isn’t enough.”
And here, today, Sherlock wanted John to know that he knew. That he knew and had not judged. That he understood how complex these things were.
“Possibly – but not very likely,” she answered honestly. “Dad will, though. So he can tell you all about it.”
But frankly, John wasn’t invested in or, to be honest, much interested in Holmes’ health. Holmes was a grown man, intelligent, educated. He should certainly know to keep a wound clean and dry. No, John had immediately assumed that the infection had come from the procedure itself – the doctor’s hands, or his instruments, or the dressing.
“An experiment,” Sherlock murmured. “Inspiration. Proof of concept. My muse. Many things.” Sherlock sighed and John watched as sleep finally began to chase him down, grounding him like a top taking its final spin. “Many, many things.”
“Like this, John.” Molly worked her hand under his, coaxing his hand into a higher arch. “Press down deliberately, one by one. Don’t drop your entire hand.”
John couldn’t hear the murmured words, and apparently Severus couldn’t either.
“Sherlock – I hardly….”
And the story spilled out. The locked gate, the overgrown garden within. The gate left ajar, and his peek into the second garden locked up within the first where Lestrade worked with clippers on the maze of living things.
There’s a staring match, an argument, an attempt at bargaining, a sulk, and then, true to form, John capitulates.
John, who’d been scanning the webpage, closed his laptop again and stood up. Standing up was not easy for John, and Sherlock usually gave him a hand if he was nearby. When John stood up, John had somewhere to go, or some point to prove.
When he’d turned his back and walked away a minute ago, Sherlock had been studying the gate, standing several paces back with his hands in his trouser pockets, sizing it up.
He heard the bathroom door creak open then shut, and he leaned against the doorframe and blew out a breath, trying to steady himself.
They all stared at him a moment, then Sherlock turned his glare on Potter.
"He came for me." Mycroft shifted, grimacing a bit, then limping forward toward a garden table, sanded and polished, and the sturdy chairs around it. "Sit, John," he said, motioning to one of the chairs.
Sherlock leaned over John to address Rosie and Lily. “Would he like to drive a train in the London Underground?” he asked. “I’m owed a favour and could bring him along.”
He won’t recall any of this when he wakes again, though he’ll be left with a vague, unsettling quiet.
“Mycroft will have your head.”
He finds that his mouth is often open, ready with a “Stop!” or a “Wait!” when the door closes but that the sound never issues. And while his body can react – a turn of his head, or jerking his head up quickly from microscope or journal – he can’t jump to his feet or move toward the door. Not fast enough, anyway.
John, for his part, let him be. He didn’t have much interest in bees as a rule, but found himself studying Sherlock studying the bees with intensity akin to that of Sherlock studying the bees themselves. He’d given up on keeping Sherlock away from the bees – Sherlock stated that if they killed him, so be it. His life, his choice. John didn’t think Mycroft would take too kindly to losing his brother to an insect bite, and had assembled all the items he would need for an emergency tracheotomy. He carried them in a kit in his medical bag, and hung it on the chair's handle.
This was Mycroft’s doing, and John could protest all he cared to, but to what end? He was the resident physician at Rosethorne. He had explicit orders to be here. He had a capable second in command in Molly, and with Sherlock gone, no other assignments to distract him. He couldn’t even write to Sherlock, or expect to have a letter from him, or even news, as his location was closely guarded and his very existence not yet official.
“He only wants what he was promised,” John said. “For Mycroft to hold up his end of the bargain.”
John Watson’s glory days of saving soldiers while the earth rumbled beneath his feet were over.
“She couldn’t swim,” John said, still looking at the board and not at Sherlock. The statement felt weak. If fell flat between them.
John stared at him, mouth slightly open in surprise. “You didn’t.”
Sherlock, not surprisingly, refused to do a somersault. John suspected he didn’t want to muss his hair.
Sustained him through Moriarty, through his fall and his absence and through all of Serbia. Sustained him until the moment John pushed back his chair in the restaurant and tackled him. Until John’s body crashed against his own, John’s hands clenched at his shoulders, his neck, wanting to strangle him in anger. Until John’s legs clenched around his torso, holding him down while Mary and the other waiters tried to break them apart. Until those eyes – those angry, hurt, betrayed eyes – stared at him and challenged him.
"John - I've been looking for you."
Shopping bags?
“James is about ready to kill her,” muttered Lily.
“Wait – where’s Scorpius?” asked Rosie as the wedding party began to assemble.
Two blinks of an eye.
They dance in the sitting room, tiny eight-pound bundle of sleeping William cradled between them. He’s the eighth wonder of the world. They’ve marveled at a fragile new life before, raised Rosie from infant to woman, but Will is a poignant reminder that they’re not the same men they were then. That years have carved them into a different-shaped package, that aches and ills have dulled the edges of wonder, turned their focus too inward.
“Surprising? Not in the least. Your mother was quite gifted – her unrealised intellectual potential made her untimely breakdown and institutionalisation all the more tragic. Not that your father was a lightweight himself, though his refutal of the theory of genetic evolution in the peppered moth post Industrial Revolution left him a bit high and dry. But then again, he was always a bit of an outlier, wasn’t he?”
to teach me to ride a broom. The Ravenclaws are on the pitch now but they’re the last ones today. There are trainer brooms in the locker room and the headmistress figures those won’t be too fast for Sherlock.”
“Mycroft – Christ – you should be in bed.”
Sherlock trudged up to the cottage, bemoaning the loss of at least two buttons. He was understandably distracted, given he’d spent thirty minutes hanging upside down in a tree while the best champagne was being opened and served at the reception. He’d chosen the champagne himself, an extravagance he didn’t question for the occasion of their daughter’s wedding. He pushed open the side door and walked into a small laundry area, then turned to the left, found a closed door, and pushed it open.
John stepped back, into Molly’s sight as was proper, and schooled his features.
“Do you dance?”
“Green, and firm. So - which is it? And why?”
“I know what the report said,” Sherlock answered. “Your wife drowned in the sea on holiday. It was ruled accidental.”
. He heard the echo of footfalls above them, a slow walk down a long corridor, but Sherlock released him as the footsteps receded and pushed past him, seemingly incorporeal again.
“He’s quite the artist,” John commented. “Has he always been?”
James and Arthur Weasley appeared from behind a room divider and a woman stuck her head around the screen.
He wanted to tell everyone.
Sherlock’s not averse to using Mycroft when Mycroft is most needed, and traipsing all over the Sussex countryside in search of the perfect retirement abode with John’s bad leg is not in the cards for John and Sherlock. So he labours over a list – the must haves, the nice-but-not-necessaries, the absolute deal-breakers. He wants to choose from no more than a dozen properties so he straightens his back and holsters his pride and visits his brother – actually
He groaned, a deep guttural reverberation, as Sherlock bent his head and pressed his warm lips against the corner of John’s mouth even as John turned his head and captured Sherlock’s mouth.
Shrelock has envy - button envy.
“Quidditch game,” Arthur said as he led them to seats overlooking the pitch and brought them lemonade.
John stepped forward and grabbed Sherlock again.
a common wizarding name,” Severus contradicted.
He stirred beside John now, wrapping an arm around John’s torso and pulling him back against his chest. They had all of a minute to enjoy the peace and quiet before an ear-splitting scream rent the air. Sherlock rolled stiffly out of bed and bent to pick up one of John’s shoes, groaning at the stretch, then flung open the bedroom door.  He’d clearly forgotten they had a guest in the house.
Mrs. Hudson, distraught, shaking, who led him to the west wing, and down a corridor he’d never before visited.
“I don’t have anything to wear.”
Here at Rosethorne, at least before Sherlock Holmes began to occupy his thoughts more than any one person or thing, life seemed utterly predictable.
And if all this had happened because of his dependency on drugs – wasn’t it his own fault, anyway?
“As am I,” said Holmes. He stood then, and walked to the window, where he gazed out into the darkness for some time while John stared at his back, for all appearances patiently waiting.
The peace offering of milk seemed paltry indeed, considering the absolute wreckage of this day.
“That the old man had taken another bad turn,” she whispered as they passed quietly through Sherlock’s room. Sherlock was sprawled across his bed, head near the foot where a stack of books reached nearly as high as the mattress. He appeared to be sleeping, and in the muted morning light, he looked younger than he was, and decidedly peaceful.
“I’m sorry?” Molly held her hand over her cup as John offered a warm up. “Mind palace?”
“There’s no letter, is there?” he asked.
“And you would have written the letter no matter your findings?” Mycroft persisted.
“How much of this did he actually tell you?” John asked as he reached around Sherlock for the milk and put it back in the refrigerator.
It was no one’s business, actually, except for their own. Or wouldn’t be, in other circumstances.
Sherlock grimaced. “Ouch. They’re going to kill us. They'll see it as having missed several months of grandchild privileges.”
Sherlock steps back and waits, silently, while John continues his slow, upward struggle. He offers John a hand when he reaches the top and steadies him when he is back on his feet.
He could hear sirens now, and everyone ran off except for John, who stood below him shaking his head fondly. “You realise that the photographer has a complete video sequence of you parachuting into the tree, and about a hundred photos of you dangling there bare-legged?”
“Greg is in over his head,” she told John one morning, lingering over the breakfast table and blowing across her already cool tea. “He’ll never finish what needs finishing before winter, John. And the boys – ” She trailed off, biting her bottom lip.
Garden crew. That was it, wasn’t it? These days, resources were scarce. Nearly every able-bodied man who could was fighting the Germans. Old men and children, wives and daughters – those were the garden crews, the at-home work force, these days.
The manor house proved far too large for two men and a handful of associates. John looked up Charlie, and they brought him back to Rosethorne to restore the cottage. The manor house fell gradually back into its role as a long-term hotel for convalescents, with Molly and Mrs. Hudson at the helm, and John being particularly suited to helping redirect its residents to new purposes. And Greg stayed at Rosethorne as well – he wasn’t ever too far from Molly, as they married just after the war ended and in short order produced three children and acquired chickens, a milk cow and a dozen sheep, plus a border collie to keep track of them all.
Sherlock’s eyes had closed again, but he gave a single downward tilt of his head, dipping his chin toward his chest, in answer.
, a new little Watson-Potter, not just a potential wiz-fit or Muppet.”
“My uncle lost an ear in the war,” he told her, touching a particularly bulbous earlobe with the tip of one finger.
John stared after him, heart beating furiously. What did Sherlock mean by that?
“What do you mean?” John settled onto one of the two benches that he had built, with a bit of reluctant help from Sherlock, from the next boards they’d scavenged from the shed. Unfortunately, it was his first bench, not the much-improved  second, the one with the slightly off-kilter proportions. The seat canted back nicely for the much taller Sherlock, but left John’s feet with toes barely touching the ground
She recovered quickly. “Yes. That’s – that’s good.”
“I did that on purpose, you realise.”
“Mrs. Hudson,” he began.
Stubborn git, John thought. He gathered Rosie up and climbed the stairs to their shared bedroom, changed her into her pajamas by the pale Christmas Eve moonlight, and tucked her in bed. A message was waiting for him when he settled back into his chair a few minutes later.
There was a time he doesn’t care to remember, a time so foggy in his mind that what he does remember he doubts. A time after Mary died and before he reconciled with Sherlock. When he struggled to function. When Molly took Rosie on Friday nights so he could get out – get away for a breather – and sleep it off in the morning. A time when he drank too much – far too much. A time when he mourned his losses, each a separate punch to the gut, and over time, forgave everyone but himself.
“Only one of your hands is compromised – it’s certainly not crippled. You can use the tools in your right while you steady with your left.” Sherlock, apparently happy to be distracted, put a foot to the bench and jiggled it. “But John, the real work is in the planning and design. The best results will spring from coupling the brain with the strength of the body and the agility of the hands.”
“Well, that was cheerful,” Sherlock told John a few minutes later as they prepared to board the second plane. “Could you remind me again why we’re not doing this in a church?”
“To unmitigated bastards who think they know what’s best for me, and to utter cocks who force confessions from me when we’re staring death in the face.” He swallowed, and Sherlock started to pull his glass back but John shook his head. “To pompous asses who interrupt my proposal speech, and to preening peacocks in bespoke suits and shite flatmates who leave the milk out to spoil and users who only shoot up for cases and – no – don’t stop me. Not done quite yet.”
Fortunately, only one person failed to reach the ground as planned, and that person was Sherlock Holmes.
John smiled at the thought. They seldom made it through the tunnel now without stopping to lean against the earthen wall, to kiss each other in the darkness, to touch each other through their clothes and sometimes skin to skin. They’d found a comfortable nook in the cottage, a cubby hole of sorts between two bedrooms, windowless and even more private than the rest of the forgotten building. But always their private time was hurried, moments borrowed from the business of the day, constrained by the ticking of the clock and the downward journey of the sun.
John shifted uncomfortably. No matter what his impressions after his first introduction to Sherlock Holmes, it was quite clear that Mycroft Holmes knew quite well that Dr. John Watson had been willing in the past to step outside of the expected norm of behavior to accomplish an end.
“Liar. You spent eons in the garden. You made benches. You planted tulips. You practiced the piano. You were too tired at night to do anything but close your eyes and fall asleep.”
makes you believe there’s a tunnel connecting the house and the cottage?”
“I love to fly,” Sherlock noted.
ooOOOOoo
He took a moment to try to get his bearings, and quickly realised he was hanging upside down with his legs exposed and his new robes hanging down around his head.
“The headmistress is trying to smooth it over, Mycroft, but you deserve the truth. I’m your BROTHER, your
“Right – wouldn’t want to interfere with your cortisone shot for your bad knee or your afternoon nap.”
“John,” Sherlock began, then cleared his throat and tried again. “John - I am supposed to be
It was a question he’d been asked many times, back in the day, and he had a ready answer.
“I don’t think we’re going to need that shed, John,” Sherlock said. “What we are going to need is a ladder.”
He turned away then, and went to fetch the wheelchair which he’d left, abandoned, over near the fountain.
“And in person?” John asked. “Disappointed?”
The child was standing mid-way up the great staircase, hands on his ears, eyes closed and emitting a sound so high-pitched that John could only just register it. Above him, Peeves spun in tight laps near the ceiling, holding what looked to be a goldfish bowl, and squealing with delight. The headmistress was drying off three sopping wet students, all of them holding toothbrushes.
Sherlock shrugged out of the coat without comment and dropped it unceremoniously to the floor, then pushed it out of the way with his foot, as if distancing himself from it would separate him from the act John could not forget, the memory of those coattails flapping in the wind.
John couldn’t help but smile. “Fine. Another one to tell me after the game, then,” he said.
John stared at his mobile.
Was it?
“What do you know about my make-up?” John asked, his voice steely. But it was all for show, really. He shouldn’t be surprised - at all - at any of the startlingly accurate deductions made by Sherlock Holmes.
“I didn’t need to. I saw owl pellets.”
He gave John a pleased smile, and John couldn’t help but shake his head and groan.
John lifted one of the man’s still-heavy eyelids, revealing an eye whose colour he couldn’t name, an eye still dull and unfocused. “What did you say his name is?” It was something odd, uncommon. Not wholly dissimilar to Mycroft.
“I didn’t say he was,” Sherlock snapped. “And stop trying to placate me.”
“I don’t believe anyone qualified that task as more important than the others.” Mycroft sounded nearly as irritated as John felt.
“Professor?” Sherlock stopped wiping and focused on Al.
“One of them anyway,” Rosie answered. She stuck out her hand with a confident smile. “I’m Rose Watson.”
Inside those four point two seconds, Sherlock makes his near fatal error – and Mary makes her decision.
“Sherlock, kick off your shoe!” Lee was ordering from above.
As Rosie grows, so too will their Christmas tree. They’ll be handmade glittery pinecones, trinkets from their first trip together to the Spanish shores, and a multi-coloured flight of origami geese. Sherlock will tease John about his obsession with the tree, and will delight in hanging household items on it for John to discover – a cocktail shrimp or two, hung by the tail, a decorative bar of soap, a miniature bottle of ketchup from a room service tray. But they’ll hang the little bee every year, and make a game of finding it in the branches, and the story of that first Christmas tree, and the buzzy bee Rosie chewed on for years, the woolen scarf made from John’s old jumpers, and the crystal suncatchers that still hang in the window, will be told and retold at Christmastime until John can’t be certain what really happened and what Sherlock has inserted over the years. His father might have had a heart attack, or been attacked by a bear, or broken his leg skiing, and he might have wrapped the two of them up in that scarf as soon as he opened it, giving John no choice at all but to kiss him silly.
“Why were you jealous of my friendship with Lestrade?”
John put down his pen and relaxed back in his chair. He enjoyed the easy camaraderie with Molly, though sometimes, as with so many of the residents of Rosethorne, he thought there was a lot to her not showing on the surface. “I’ve no idea – I agree with the rest of the staff, though. She left because of what happened to the general. I have an idea we’ll be finding out more about that in the days to come.”
If so, it was about the only thing in this moment of time that was over-rated.
“Spy, then?” he asked, opening his eyes and focusing on Sherlock. “Will your brother have to kill me now?”
No matter that Lestrade had opened the gate for them. No matter that this was Sherlock’s family’s ancestral home and he should have a right to go where he wanted about the estate.
of the fireplace – and not a one leading
“We’ll wait,” Harry said, glancing at Severus who looked perfectly patient on a second needle-point chair.
The plot – if plot it was – was beginning to click into place.
But he tamed the dragon, caged the beast, and settled for something over nothing.
“Of course! I’ve spoken with Lestrade - he hasn’t admitted to knowing about the garden - he affected muteness again to avoid answering, but he’ll come around quickly as soon as I go poking about with you.”
“So gallant, Dr. Watson,” she murmured, extending a hand and brushing her knuckles along his jaw. There was nothing weak, nothing hesitant, in her touch, and her eyes, when he met them, were hard and determined. “Don’t let him break you, John,” she murmured. “Remember why you’re here.”
London
“Charlie?”
He rubbed the heel of his left hand with his right, holding both hands in his lap, finished for now – for quite a while, if the pain running from his thumb down into his arm was any indication – but already in possession of a grim determination he hadn’t had before.
“Where did you – no. Never mind. It doesn’t matter.” The infection had likely come from the actual surgical procedure, John concluded. At this point, it would be a waste of time to chase down the butcher who’d performed the procedure. It didn’t matter who had done the job – taking care of the resulting infection was far more important than finding someone to blame. John would have to treat it as best he could with clumsy hands and the supplies he had available.
“Mrs. Hudson asked me to bring this,” he said.
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson?”
“That’s her jumping outfit,” John reminded him. “There’s a skirt to put over it when she lands.”
“No - wait. How did you know that?”
John’s heart was still pounding and he was half out of breath when he reached Sherlock’s room. He found Sherlock at his dresser, holding the wig in one hand and running the other through his flattened curls. A lamp with a weak bulb illuminated the room poorly, but enough for John to see that the bed was not empty.
his help, but he certainly didn’t
He iced his hand after lunch, then, still frustrated and out of sorts over the letter he’d read the night before and his reaction to Sherlock’s relationship with Lestrade, he made his way to the music room, determined to clear his mind. The bee stings on his right hand, and the resulting short-term inability to use it, had underlined the importance of strengthening his left. He’d been remiss of late – hurrying to fit his daily responsibilities in a smaller window so he could take Sherlock out to the gardens at suppertime.
“Quiet,” they whispered.
John was torn between outrage and admiration. During the horrible event itself, and the weeks that followed, no one had even suggested that Mary’s death was anything but a horrible accident. When the idea of neglect had arisen - that John Watson perhaps should not have been sleeping while Mary waded in the waves, the quick determination was made that John and his wife were at the seaside, on a much-needed holiday. That John was a doctor, overworked and tired, that the sun could lull anyone to sleep. That Mary was a grown woman, and knew the risks. That she could have an attack at any moment, without warning.
Sherlock smiled. “And dungeons,” he said dryly. “Functional dungeons.”
“He doesn’t take tea.” He said it with quite a bit of conviction, despite not having any real evidence to support the statement, and knowing full well it wasn’t an argument that would buy him a reprieve.
“Lab coats!” blurted Sherlock. “I wear a lab coat at Bart’s. It’s practically a robe!”
John’s gone out the door and he hears footsteps on the stairs, a pause, and steps back up again.
Four and a half seconds.
Sherlock reminds himself vaguely as he sinks into unconsciousness. His eyelids don’t flutter. They don’t blink. He feels John’s hand on his arm, on his shoulder, a brief squeeze. Fingers run down his arm in an almost caress.
“His seizures have become more frequent since he started working again,” John said at last, deliberately not answering Mycroft’s question, but not cutting off the conversation either. “Not more severe – just more frequent. They’ve been relatively minor but the increasing frequency isn’t a good sign.”
“Oh?” he asked. He hadn’t worked out why she’d initially been so unwelcoming. “And what exactly did you expect?”
“Bzzzzzzz,” said Rosie. “Bzzzzzzzz.”
John swallowed away the memories and cleared his throat. “We have code-breakers, and spies, and war rooms with simulations. The generals move the pieces around like a chess game. But you’re saying – you’re thinking – that you can -”
He didn’t think of Molly Hooper at all.
“What are you doing?” protested John, squinting the dimming evening sun at Sherlock. “You’ve lost your shoe.”
“You’ll need to speak to Sherlock about that,” John answered curtly. “In the morning, after a few hours of sleep.”
Sherlock Holmes, London’s only consulting detective, has become accustomed to them since he’s moved here to 221B. He’s proud of his orderly, organized mind, his generally superior intellect, his grasp of scientific principles, and despite the abuse he’s imposed on his body these past years, and the mind-altering substances he no longer uses but still craves, he does not believe he’s insane, or hallucinating. These things happen sometimes in the universe, things that simply can’t be explained. They don’t happen to him, of course, but he’s read accounts of ghosts and spirits and inexplicable occurrences that happen to other people. A subset of humanity believes in alien abductions, and time travel, and parallel universes. A much larger component believes in a rich, idyllic afterlife. And while his great intellect can sort out paradoxes and puzzles, it simply cannot explain the presence of a gentleman in swimming shorts staring at him through his bedroom door, or an elderly woman’s shocked expression as she opens the bathroom door to find him standing there naked, shaving his face.
“In Molly?” John hadn’t meant to make it sound like a question, but surely Sherlock couldn’t be that clueless.
“At the Burrow – well, that’s what they call the house. Gramps and Gran are still there.’
time,” he said. “They need to rework things in their heads. It can’t be forced.”
John quickly filed away this new information. Holmes, apparently, was a man to be watched – and not necessarily trusted.
And Sherlock closed his eyes and dreamed about flying.
Sherlock’s hand was still outstretched, and John eyed the newcomer suspiciously, but reached into his pocket for the key, dropping it unceremoniously into Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock’s expression changed immediately, though he schooled his features quickly, and affected an air of casual interest. He turned the key over on his hand, then held it up, studying it in the fading light.
He’d been a better surgeon than a pianist, though he’d been a competent pianist, when he still had the use of both hands. Surgery was science – rules, and procedures, and a determined order of things. True – a good surgeon had to be inventive at times, ready to do a sudden turn to get around an unexpected problem, but once that detour was made, it was back to business as usual.
But with Sherlock - one never knew. John had heard and seen more than his share of preposterous and impossible things over the time of his stay here at Rosethorne. Hadn’t be been fetched once and taken to see a dead man now alive? Then awakened by said dead man in the guise of a woman? And what about crows keeping keys, and locked gardens, and tragic stories of a man left a widower by a bee sting?
Sherlock stooped to step through the opening and examined the panel that had opened to reveal the tunnel. “It’s a simple latch mechanism from this side,” he said. He took several steps into the tunnel, running his fingers along the tightly packed dirt wall, then turned to face John. “Ready for a new adventure then, Dr. Watson?”
“Robes!” she exclaimed. “Al’s finally picked out the style he wants.”
“No – ankle’s broken.” John paused as an odd tingling in his ankle spread up his leg and vanished as suddently as it had begun. “Christ – where did you
“I’ve been so focused on recreating the original system that I didn’t realise I was building something new atop the rubble. Something made of colour and sound and motion and scent – memory is
"You're a bit late, Mycroft," John said, surprising himself with how casually he was able to say the words.
John chuckled at Mycroft’s tactics. “He may be an arse, but he’s clever.”
“A small team,” Sherlock clarified. He spoke with his eyes fixed on Anderson, and he wrinkled his nose again as if smelling something unpleasant.
“Captain Watson – good of you to join us,” Holmes said, perfunctorily straightening a stack of paper before him.
“I don’t care what he does. I’m going to be in the Ministry when I grow up – the Ministry of Magic, not the Muggle Ministry. Muggles are dull, and most of them rather stupid. Father’s a Muggle, but he’s more clever than most, and of course he has Mummy and she’s quite smart. We don’t do magic at home, though, because Mummy wants me to use my brain first and magic only for emergencies.  But sometimes I can’t help it – something will be out of place in the sitting room, or I’ll have a tear in my trousers or a spot on my shirt and poof! My magic makes it all right again without me meaning to do anything!”
Severus glanced upward, sighed, twitched the wand and the black parachute turned pink to match Sherlock’s.
He thought of it as planning, though. Covering all contingencies. He’d learned early in his life that he must always have a plan. He must always be aware of his circumstances, his surroundings. He would attract far less suspicion if he was never caught slinking around, slipping off without a goodbye, disappearing and reappearing at odd hours. It took a good deal of care, and discipline, and certainly planning, to have secrets.
“But it isn’t,” replied Mycroft. “Because you’ve tossed your mobile at the sofa and John has retrieved it. Thank you for that, John. I assume you’ve heard the news, then?”
"At sixes and sevens" refers to a state of confusion or disarray, and can be used to a state of disagreement between two people.
John sipped his tea, taking his time to consider his answer.
“Noted,” said John.
“Well, Mycroft, you always win, don’t you?” he said as the applauding crowd settled back in their seats. “Here I am even though the last thing you ever heard me say was ‘I’m still not going.’”
John nodded. Of course. Don’t let the mice play while the cat was away. “I’m quite sure all will be in order from my end,” he said.
“Albus Severus Potter, today, tomorrow and al ….”
“You’re holding us hostage.” Mycroft, calmly sitting behind his desk, said the words matter-of-factly.
Both Ginny and Scorpius were groping in their clothing, looking for….
“I will be leaving shortly and may be gone as long as a month. I remain in contact with my key staff while I’m away and they will appraise me of any important developments.”
“In London,” agreed John.
“Bogsworth,” supplied Sherlock. “Let’s just hope they’re Muppets.”
It ended with coloured pencils and rulers and drawing paper spread across Sherlock’s work table. Drawings. Measurements. Materials lists. Doodles of pirates with eye-patches, wooden legs, hooks for hands. A John pirate with a sickly-looking parrot on his shoulder. Sherlock with eye-patch and spyglass. John and Sherlock in tricorn hats, side by side, peeking over the top of a hedge maze.
He couldn’t help but wonder how much time Lestrade spent in this place - for it really was a place of wonder and beauty, far beyond the great work of art at its center. There were mismatched beds of early summer flowers already in bloom, and there were flowering bushes and statuary and paving stones and ivy. There were fruit trees - apple and pear and plum - and closer to the garden walls grew a group of oaks, and beneath them, some stone benches, shaded by the trees from the afternoon sun.
All eyes moved to Sherlock, who was standing, brandishing his violin and bow, and looking half mad scientist, half excited child.
Sherlock let out an undignified chortle, totally in contrast to the serious tone of John’s voice.
“Oh for God’s sake!” Sherlock hurled his mobile at the sofa. It bounced and slid across the keyboard of John’s laptop, fell onto the sofa and dropped into the gap between seat cushion and armrest.
Sherlock passed through Wiggin’s room quickly, and John glanced at the rather Spartan bedroom curiously as he followed Sherlock into the connecting room.
Chapter 7
“You don’t trust me,” Mycroft said, voice bland, as John remained silent, still standing behind the chair. He didn’t wait for an answer, nor did he seem to expect one, but stood, steadying himself with a hand on a chairback. He looked like a man unaccustomed to infirmities of any kind, confused when his body refused to cooperate. He sorted himself then nodded at John.
“Play along, John,” Sherlock murmured in his ear as he pushed away from John and wobbled toward Lestrade.
“Christ - Sherlock!” John whirled around, startled, heart pounding. “Don’t do that!”
“Sherlock.” John’s voice held a warning, but Sherlock ignored it. He studied Molly a moment longer, then stood and walked over to one of the stained-glass windows, leaning casually against the wall beside it.
“Left hand.”
His thoughts were on the mysterious invalid, and the improbable man in charge of his care, and when he reached the lock gate in the garden, he very nearly walked past it without stopping to stare through the bars at the forgotten garden beyond.
They went through it once, with fumbles and foibles, learning the rhythm together, two separate hands and souls awkwardly keeping pace with each other.
“Al!” Rosie had stooped to pick up Hamish, who buried his face in her chest and blew a raspberry.
He could hear a telltale
“Orders?” She obviously had not been briefed.
John chuckled. “An accident waiting to happen. How about the Speedo Faskin? You were convinced she’d be an Olympic swimmer. You must have spent ….”
“Oh, I can’t imagine that,” he said, an odd smile flitting across his face. He nodded. “Your move.”
of garden shears now, and the sound of someone whistling. He felt like a voyeur as he watched the man work, for the artist had made an appearance at last, circling a peacock-shaped bush, carefully – surgically – trimming its plumed tail. As he worked, a pair of squirrels kept him company, sitting a respectful distance away, but staying close, and running out to fetch the occasional peanut the man tossed their way. At one point, a robin flew off the wall and lit on the man’s shoulder, and balanced there a few moments before taking flight once again.
The door closed with a small
“I suppose it might recognise me,” John conceded. “Funny they can tell us apart – they all look the same to me.”
"And Sherlock?" he asked, holding Mycroft's gaze.
Sherlock doesn’t answer John’s question because the truth is buried so deep within himself he can’t find it without picking the locks on a dozen doors in his mind palace and decoding the pirate’s treasure map he’s placed within.
“Can’t risk it, Sherlock. I picked this garden in large part because it’s so neglected. Not much danger of Lestrade or Ben wandering by – especially this time of the day.”
Someone had found them. Someone was trying to help.
His hand was trembling – he’d done more than he should have, but far, far less than he wanted to do.
“So – you’re seeing something you didn’t see before. Something important, or it wouldn’t be gnawing on you all the time like it is. So why don’t you pitch it to Mycroft and the others? Let me tell them you can’t continue like you’ve been going at it. Your seizures haven’t slowed down since you started – you’re having far more than you used to and we all know it has to do with the work.”
“You first,” Sherlock says, passing a wrapped package to John. It fits easily in his hand, and is practically weightless. John smiles his thanks, then lifts the lid and removes the bubble wrap covering.
It was an unexpected relief, a relief almost palatable, to face Sherlock Holmes over the chessboard and finally let go.
Sherlock. No. Not Sherlock. He wasn’t part of the plan – just part of the game. And John had been foolish. Foolish to think that the garden, the violin and piano, the coloured light dancing on the walls of the music room, the childhood regained, that any of this opened up a secret door in his heart, or Sherlock’s. That magic was at work when it was so clear now that this was just more wartime strategy.
“It’s private in your room at two o’clock in the morning, or in the music room, or under the stars in the garden. It’s private nearly everywhere in this rambling manor. And besides - I’ve something else in mind when the time is right.”
“Sherlock Holmes – you’ve obviously already met my bully of an older brother. I’m the smart one, of course – he has me breaking Nazi code in return for keeping my feet on English soil, not that I’d be an effective soldier with injury-induced epilepsy, but that’s another matter altogether. So – you’re part of the team now, but things aren’t exactly as they seem, are they? I don’t need physio – Dr. Watson has my physical needs quite covered already. I need an assistant. Someone intelligent, loyal, unattached – someone who won’t stand out otherwise here at Rosethorne – someone who can double as a qualified member of the medical care staff. I hoped you would work well with Dr. Watson, and I’m not at all disappointed.
“Sleep is highly over-rated,” Sherlock replied.
“Fine – top ten visits to the A&E.” He looked at Sherlock triumphantly, then gave his attention back to the puzzle.
“Get inside the enemy’s head. Accurately predict the enemy’s next moves based on a study of the information revealed in and by the intercepted messages?”
“I’m going to make tea. Would you like a glass of milk?”
“Client?” Sherlock mouthed.
John laughed, and the corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched in a near smile.
But the piano….
“Well, nothing here for us to see, John,” Sherlock said with a sigh. “The navigation system is not to be trusted – I’ve told you that for years, haven’t I? It’s taken us to a deserted house – probably full of criminals and miscreants.”
John shifted. He inhaled, straightened his shoulders even more, and waited.
“It’s badly infected,” John said. “How long ago did you….?”
Well, they weren’t cold before he started thinking about them.
“We don’t have years,” Holmes said dismissively. “It’s been months already.” His fingers continued their rhythmic tapping.
“Who gets this white one?” he teased.
It had been too long.
Finally, Sherlock looked away.
Molly’s sandwich sat on her plate, ignored, while her tea cooled in its china cup.
He regarded Sherlock with interest as the other man steepled his hands before his face in the now familiar gesture, taking his time to consider. He looked up to meet John’s eyes, and held them for some time. For the first time, John noted their colour – a stormy blend of grey and green, as if they couldn’t decide on a single colour and tried out different shades and intensities at random.
“You see but you do not
“Alright – happy coincidence then,” she said.
“No – not at all. I just hoped butterflies or fireflies would fly out of his mouth,” Sherlock acknowledged.
“Wait.” John held up a hand. “In his
He’d changed it up after a month, found a take-out coffee place nearly as close as the café – two hundred and forty-six steps once he closed his door behind him. Carried the coffee to the park and sat on a bench and did the crossword in the morning sunlight, when they were lucky enough to have it, filling in all the spots he couldn’t solve with mild obscenities and self-deprecating words like
“Are we going to talk about the general at all?” John asked with a noncommittal shrug.
“Of course.” John placed his bag on the foot of the bed and waited while Holmes took his time removing his slippers, then moved closer to the side of the bed where John stood.
Once, he had killed a man who’d ruined Mary’s life, who’d left her with an injury that left her weak and shaken, with a hole in her heart too big for even John to fill.
“Oh yes, he’s gone,” small Mycroft said with a huff. “And he’s probably not going to get my Mummy, is he?”
He’d regret it later, when he took time to consider what a blow like that could do to a man with a traumatic brain injury, but his reflexes were in charge and he’d reacted to the perceived threat appropriately.
“I need to
ooOOOoo
“I live in a three room prison – a rather lavish one, I admit.” He moved his head, winced, and felt the back of it tentatively, then sighed. “It’s hardly a life.”
Perhaps it was the nonchalant way he asked, or the fact that John himself was so obviously damaged that made Charlie step forward instead of back. Or perhaps it was the fact that he’d spent much of his childhood in his grandfather’s woodworking shop, and watching John cut the plank and pick up a sanding block to begin smoothing it out stirred something long-buried within him.
Sherlock placed his finger on a spot near the front of the wing.
“But I could if I
But Billy as a musician? Billy composing?
He shouldn’t be flirting with Sherlock Holmes.
“My turn.” John could give as good as he got. “When Rosie stuck the carrot up your nose and it wouldn’t come out. When Mrs. Hudson got chemical burns on her hand when she tried to clean up your experiment. When Rosie stuck the miniature teacup up your nose and it wouldn’t come out. Sherlock – you really do have an over-large nose.”
It was missing something.
Sherlock scoffed.
Sherlock groaned as John squeezed once more. “I had no physical activities to distract me,” he said. “I’m afraid my thoughts of you were not quite so pure.”
“John – I’ve been looking for you.”
John shifted to accommodate the growing weight in his groin. God – he was getting hard just from
It could have been just a bit more normal in their decidedly not-so-normal lives. Another accident, another misunderstanding, another recovery. Rosie might have come home to find her father nursing a twisted ankle, wrapped foot propped on a pillow. John might have limped from sitting room to kitchen to fetch the tea. Sherlock might have tolerated it for a day or two or three, then broken free from 221B, completely stir-crazy and itching for a case.
“It’s in your head, John. It’s always in your head.” He bowed, touching his forehead to John’s. “Ready, then?”
Sherlock grinned. “Show me,” he persisted. “What do you have in your pocket?”
- was ambrosia. Nectar of the gods. Manna from heaven.
Alright,then.
John settled on the ground beside him. It felt good to rest, and better yet to do so out-of-doors in the calm evening, with Sherlock slowed down to nearly his own speed. He gazed upward into the tree for a minute, wondering what Sherlock was staring at, but couldn’t make out form in the shadows. He watched the clouds roll by for a time, then let his gaze wander back to the garden wall, and the doorway in it, and the shed just past the doorway. It was as if everything they needed to execute their plan had been dropped in pieces at their feet for them to assemble.
“It is conspicuous in its size - inappropriate for a small loo such as this - the doors don’t even open all the way with the placement of the sink and commode. It’s against the south wall and is large enough to accommodate a grown man. It’s too large to have been moved here - so either the room was built around it or it was built into the room. It must have a purpose.” He leaned in close to John again until John could nearly feel the phantom scrape of the stubble on his chin. “Look at the shelf - there’s a build-up here -” he touched the edge of the shelf he’d indicated - “that you don’t see on the opposite shelf or the ones above and below. Residue from fingers, laid there over some time, and most importantly, not rigorously cleaned by the servants. Lifting the shelf, or doing it in combination with another action, could trigger a release mechanism on the panel.”
He nearly ran into Mrs. Hudson as she rounded the corner at the same time he did.
John rather agreed with the boy, but kept his expression neutral as he bent and picked up the offending sock and tossed it onto Sherlock’s chair. “We’re busy,” he said. “I work odd hours at the clinic and Sherlock works with the police – he’s a sort of detective.”
“No.” His fingers twitch atop the cane. “You’re still here.”
“I’m not wrong, John.”
“Couldn’t you have done that ten minutes ago?” Sherlock asked as he and Severus packed up their respective chutes, his now back to normal size.
“Very?”
“It was the least she could do after I got rid of that awful mustache for her.”
“The father of the bride traditionally dresses to match the male members of the wedding party,” Rosie explained patiently. “But Sherlock – you’re being fitted for robes next week! Robes!”
“He’s always been a prick so that shouldn’t surprise you.”
“I did. Once.” He slid onto the bench and, unable to stop touching the lovely instrument, picked out the melody of a popular wartime song.
Sherlock sighed. “I’d insist you stay, but the bed is barely large enough for one.”
John stepped forward as he spoke softly, feigning confidence and innocence he didn’t feel, relieved that his instincts as a physician had risen before true panic set in. Mycroft, remarkably, let himself be pushed gently back into the room as John moved forward, still with no idea what he was going to do or say, and shut the door gently behind him, taking care to not wake Sherlock.
“I thought so - once,” Sherlock answered. “Looking back on it, I imagine what I actually felt was something between infatuation and lust.”
to dig. I soon gave up and stomped off, after calling Mycroft every bad word I knew.” He tossed the key up and snatched it again from the air. “And then, Dr. Watson – I stole Ben’s keys. Found the ring on a garden bench while he was up a ladder pruning a tree, and, believing that this one, the largest, the most ornate, had to fit the gate to
“I doubt I’ll ever get to know him well enough to judge,” John said. “I’ve not yet seen him lucid. At this point, we’re just trying to keep him comfortable.”
“And you call yourself a gentleman! It’s one thing to not be monogamous, but to sleep with mother and son! I could almost forgive that -
When they were old men, when the war was over and other wars had come and gone, when John’s needed thick spectacles to tell one chessman from another and Sherlock’s hand shook so much at times that they’d  taken to using an over-sized chessboard with clunky chessmen, they would remember the chess game that night, but neither would recall who’d won.
“So you have spies.” John said. He glanced toward the door. “Billy.”
He gazed at the photo contemplatively, scratching his chin.
“Why third?” John asks after a bit. Sherlock has already engineered a solution to secure the hinge on the shed in the yard of the home they don’t quite own yet.  He realises he’s wrong about household repairs and who’ll be doing them.
No – it was his behavior. His clear disdain for authority. His subversiveness in working against his brother in the Irene Adler affair. His unpredictability. It was the whole idea of this complex, creative and obviously brilliant man subjected to the random attacks of the brain that was so obviously his most prized asset.
“My brother’s antics have caused me a great deal of trouble and have put me a week behind on a project of national importance. I trust you can keep him out of additional trouble, Dr. Watson?  He’s eager to see you again, though he won’t indulge while I am here. He doesn’t trust me, or my motives, for that matter. Extending the length of his recovery, he believes, inhibits my plans, or whatever he’s determined they are. And before you ask, we need him. The war effort needs him.  He has a certain gift, you might call it, and we haven’t yet found someone who can replace him.”
He shifted uncomfortably, repositioning his arm on his stomach and frowning against the pain.
I worked to make this longer but as someone smart once said, it is what it is.
ooOOOoo
“Shhh!” hushed Sherlock. He was on knees and elbows on the lawn, looking intently at the base of the elm tree.
But now, here with Sherlock, he was dancing, not counting. Sherlock held his weak hand firmly, holding it in position so that it was neither liability nor distraction, and in the quiet John heard him humming as they moved.
“Your move,” he said, coolly, eyes resolutely on the chess board.
- never recover all that was lost after a brain injury.”
“Pants or drafty bits?” she asked matter-of-factly.
John thought of Mary in her party dress, dancing in the ballroom, of kissing on the balcony on New Year’s Eve. He thought of holding her hand in the hospital, sitting at her bedside time and again and lifting her hand to his lips. He thought of walks in the park, hand in hand, feeding the greedy swans, huddling up against the wind on a bench as the autumn sun went down.
They didn’t speak much after that, and when John was safely delivered to his comfortable and spacious quarters, he divested himself of coat and shoes and sat on the edge of the bed, then let himself fall back and stared at the ceiling.
“The Work,” Sherlock confirmed. “I can’t do the Work. The Mind Palace is in ruins.”
But not to achieve Mycroft’s ends. No, not for that reason at all.
Molly blushed. “It started as a hobby, really. Just something that worked for me when I was learning anatomy. It’s nothing like Sherlock’s– because it’s not in my head. I documented the entire process on paper – it’s possible to apply it to other disciplines.”
Three Weeks Before the Deal
“You mean…?”
John shakes his head fondly. He’s gazing down at a very sleepy William, whose beautiful muddy blue eyes are beginning to close. He can’t help but see his mother in them, and remember days pacing the floor with her, at the house he shared with Mary and then at 221B. He remembers the weight of her in his arms, the warmth of her small body as he paced with her on his shoulder after Mary’s death, soothing her but really – really – soothing himself. He remembers dancing, moving purposefully into Sherlock’s arms that fateful night, Rosie a soft and warm bundle between them.
“In the past thirty minutes, I ambushed you in your own bedroom, implicated you in the disappearance of one of Britain’s finest spies, and asked you to follow me here, all while disguised as a woman. And the first question you ask is about my sleep habits.”
“I wasn’t there when he died and couldn’t have stopped it from happening had I’d been. But fortunately for the Placido family – who were enjoying a Sunday outing in the park – Mycroft was strolling by on his way to stick his nose in some important government business that was really none of his business at all when they most needed someone’s help.”
“Look – you’re going to have to help me,” John said, keeping his voice low and speaking as calmly as possible. He needed to keep Lestrade close. “I’ll tell you what’s going on, but you have to promise to help me get him back inside without anyone noticing.”
And what would he be with access to this mind palace that seemed to be his central focus, and the heart of the reason John had been brought to Rosethorne?
But John didn’t want a wounded, defeated and weakened Mycroft. He knew how to bristle at the cold, business-like man, the taskmaster who came and went without notice, who made the very air stale and unbreathable when he spent days at Rosethorne. John knew how to meet his usual cold indifference with a soldier’s stance and clipped, but proper, words in return.
He couldn’t tell whether she was more angry, or more hurt.
Possibilities dance through Sherlock’s head and he analyses and sorts each as it occurs to him. “Do you have a mobile?”
“Yes. I simply
Sholto and the colonel ignored him while Anderson froze, a biscuit raised to his lips.
“Of course a church! It’s traditional!”
That was it. Long memories. Smart birds, with long memories. He sometimes wondered if he was thinking aloud given the number of times Sherlock appeared to read his mind.
Sherlock sleeps.
He fell asleep in the impossibly comfortable chair, and didn’t know that Sherlock played on for nearly an hour, or that he tucked a blanket ‘round John, lifting his crippled arm with curious tenderness. Or that he stared off into space for some time after – mentally reciting pi to one hundred places, listing the elements of the periodic table, counting to one hundred in Cantonese.
It was a foreign feeling, and he held it carefully, acutely aware of how tenuous it was.
“I don’t really pay much attention to how we get there,” Al said. He looked nervously around for Rosie, then stood up. “Well, I’d better go down for a bit.”
“Infuriating.”
“No – that’s it! That’s what he’s done!” Baby Sophie began to fuss and Sherlock expertly patted her back and bounced her a bit.
“Are we celebrating or mourning?” he asked as he poured.
Thus is was that Severus found himself with a hitch-hiker when he bee-lined directly to the nuptial circle which was forming below him.
He gave an exaggerated sigh. “That last can’t be helped, I suppose. I’d much rather stay put in my warm bed than be hauled away to play doctor in the middle of the night.”
“Yeah. Visitors. Visitors who don’t actually visit.” The man laughs dryly. He stares at Sherlock and blinks. “You’re still here.”
“In this weather?” John shrugged. “Well, it’s not summer yet – maybe he just likes fires?”
"He came for me." Mycroft shifted, grimacing a bit, then limping forward toward a garden table, sanded and polished, and the sturdy chairs around it. "Sit, John," he said, motioning to one of the chairs.
John rolled his eyes. “What - timed your seizure to coincide with the end of our first romantic encounter?” he asked, lifting their joined hands and pressing his lips to Sherlock’s knuckles in a casual gesture of affection, as if they weren’t two grown men hiding out in a dusty women’s dressing room.
ooOOOoo
“You came to me at Baker Street, and then you came back with Rosie, and now….” He trails off and gestures at their surroundings. “Though I suppose you'll have at least seven....”
“Wait – ”
It’s a moment that’s stayed with him all of his life after, the dazzling moment of clarity when the stars aligned and the earth’s orbit – and John’s heart - skipped a beat in unison, giving in to the gravitational pull of the new center of the universe. The moment…the feeling…being in the right place at exactly the right time, catching Sherlock at his very best with Rosie, then sliding sideways into their private moment, claiming the family that was his for the taking.
Sherlock brightened, forgetting about his beloved bees. “Oh – good one, John. It was so fun to shop for her – she was hardly the traditional little girl, our Rosie. Can we do William next?”
He picks up his keys, pulls one off the ring and tosses it to Sherlock. “There you go – I’ll be back in a couple hours and can help you move your things then.”
“You’d stay then? Here?”
John carefully unfastened the tape on one of the ends of the neatly done-up package then jerked back as the paper began to unwrap itself until only the contents remained on the table and the paper had disintegrated into a million miniscule pieces of confetti with a very surprising
John bristled. He hated Anderson’s attitude. It was utterly offensive. He acted as if Sherlock had somehow engineered this catastrophe - had very nearly been killed through some fault of his own. It didn’t escape him that Anderson’s statement implied that the Germans had intelligence on Sherlock, that they’d known about him and his project, and like everyone else, thought him dead. But even with that weight of that knowledge, he attacked back.
arranged for me to take up the piano as therapy.”
Lestrade was nearly always present those late afternoons in the garden, and as the summer slowly gave way to autumn, he began to engage John in preparations for the winter.
Mrs. Hudson appeared to brighten. “You’ll make a chart, then? Oh, Dr. Watson – Sherlock will like that.”
“Miss Adler, then,” John said, nodding.
Damn that Statute of Secrecy!
“He’s – um – he’s not feeling well,” said James.
He hardly had time to suck in a breath of air before he was pressed against the wall by Sherlock’s lean body, before Sherlock’s lips were on his. A knee worked in between his legs, stopping his downward slide, and Sherlock’s thigh pressed against his groin as his lips moved on John’s, sucked on his bottom lip, released it and mouthed his jaw, his cheek, his ear.
A balding man in a bespoke suit walks by the door and pauses to straighten the brass number placard until 221B is perfectly horizontal. He smiles in satisfaction, tips his hat to the landlady in the window, and walks unhurriedly away.
“Play something,” he says, eyes warm and happy, nodding at the violin against the wall. “I haven’t heard you play in months.”
Sherlock swallowed the lump in his throat and nodded, and turned his head to burrow his face in the comforting, familiar smell of John Watson.
“He doesn’t speak, you know,” she told John in a hushed voice. “He hasn’t – not since before he came here, Dr. Watson. Something happened – something that
“And this surprised you? That a six-month old managed to fund the dummy in the bed and get it into his mouth?”
But Lestrade was standing beside Sherlock now, keeping pace with him as he walked another circuit around the maze. John could not make out what they were saying, but he watched them while he sat on the bench in the shade under the oaks.
Oddly, Sherlock hadn’t ever expressed an interest in it, in the mysterious locked garden where his grandmother had died. To be fair, he’d no cause to think it even existed anymore, locked or not. His grandmother had died more than fifty years ago, and the story might be nothing more than fairy tale to him.
!” He looked delighted with himself to have solved the puzzle so quickly. “Tell me, John! What have you taken from him?”
“Yours didn’t count.’
No – not nervous. He was practically bristling with anticipation, and what he was feeling wasn’t really nerves at all. An honest examination of his motivation and his emotional state would reveal that he was nearly itching for the anticipated fight.
“One hundred and sixteen,” he said, starting to stoop to retrieve the lost button.
And the pulling desire, the want he could not stopper all these days and weeks and months, is nothing – nothing compared to the victory cry of his heart as John rests in his arms.
“I’ve just spoken with Mycroft,” he said, steadying her by the elbow. “Where is he?”
Sherlock shifted in his chair, frowning.
He laughed. “I was shot in the desert, Molly. Getting
“You aren’t my mother.”
died years and years ago so stop pretending he was your best friend and get
“Thinking about you,” John said, kissing Sherlock again.
“You tell me,” John challenged. He clicked his glass against Sherlock’s and tipped it back, then stared at him, waiting.
Sherlock dropped the words with unapologetic ease. Holding Rosie in front of the mantel, letting her touch the skull’s teeth, poke her finger in an eye socket. Pointing to the photograph of John and Mary on their wedding day.
“That’s me,” Sherlock explained. John thought he looked amused, and was apparently paying only peripheral attention to the very serious matter being discussed. “Code name Magpie. I imagine they’ll have to shoot you now, John.”
“If I did?” Sherlock asked.
“I’M NOT MOST CHILDREN!”
Sherlock stood. “I’d like to see Molly again – if not tonight, then in the morning. We’ve got quite a bit to discuss before we start in earnest.”
“If the two of you can come up with a better treatment plan, by all means go about it,” he said, “I’ll just sit here and eat the rest of these sandwiches and warm up my tea while you go on talking like you’ve known each other since you were children, and please do continue discussing me as if I’m deaf, dumb and blind and decidedly not a doctor myself. Don’t mind me – don’t mind me at all.”
Sherlock laughed. “I suppose there’s nothing stopping us now, is there?”
“The board was precisely cut and measured - it’s not a random scrap but a carefully-considered ladder rung made of strong, weather-resistant wood. Yet it was erected less carefully - though safely enough.” He tugged on the end of one of the wooden steps, though it was essentially part of the tree now and didn’t budge. “What does that tell you, John?”
“You’re in seventh heaven, Sherlock,” he says, giving him a steadying hand as Sherlock stands again.
“The police call me in when they’re out of their element.” Sherlock shrugs. “You’ve seen a lot injuries, then? Violent deaths?”
“Tell me you want this, John,” he murmured as they stood there in the darkest of dark, unmoving, not touching,
Lestrade’s eyes widened. Then, to John’s immense surprise, his mouth twitched into a slow, delighted smile and he moved forward until he stood just in front of Sherlock beside the bed.
“Right.” She glanced at the closed door opposite the door to the corridor, then stepped closer to him. “It’s not what you expect, Dr. Watson,” she whispered, removing the bag from his grasp and dropping it onto the chair on top of her newspaper. “Be strong. Remember who this is really about – who you really answer to.”
“Actually – she didn’t really hate them. She did that for me.”
. She stepped in closer, and he felt her hand touch his shoulder.
Mycroft Holmes had intentionally handed him a puzzle, invited him to unlock one of the manor’s secrets. The man was as much an enigma as his intriguing brother locked up inside.
“Is that what she said?” Sherlock’s smile was almost fond. “Drunk on love, perhaps.”
“About your project,” John said, an odd little thrill tingling in the back room of his consciousness. Time to get this conversation moving along. “About the work.”
John has a good feeling before Sherlock stops the car at the end of the drive. He has a good feeling when he sees the tangled ivy, the polished windows, the freshly painted door. It’s a bit mismatched on the outside, asymmetrical, with an equal mix of quaint old features and more modern upgrades. John is oddly drawn to it, but when they’re shown inside, and walk through a short corridor into the sitting room, he stops in his tracks and his mouth falls open and he turns around to look at Sherlock, who’s looking past him into the sitting room and staring at the familiar wallpaper.
“Do you
It was perfect. Aggressive, reckless, pleasure. All the better for Mycroft’s presence behind the very wall on which they leaned. Sherlock’s thigh rolled against his groin and he stifled a groan, coherent thought impossible as he hardened, and pushed back against Sherlock, groaning as Sherlock’s fingers worked under his shirt, pinching at his nipples.
“First door on the left,” Sherlock said with a smile.
“Yet they clearly do not,” said Mycroft in his usual, grown-up, unpleasant voice. “They are far too small, yet my belt is too large.”
“It’s not that I
John paused, one hand on the door.
“Billy?” John’s eyes widened in surprise. “Really?”
John came back from time to time, drawn inexorably by the forlorn scene, but the gate was always closed and locked.
“The rest of it? Church? What are you talking about? I can hardly read your mind, John.”
John occasionally has to remind Sherlock that they’d had another baby all those years ago – a daughter named Rosie whom Sherlock had thought quite wonderful in her own right. The sun rose and set in her eyes and the stars formed a crown about her wispy blonde halo. But Sherlock is quick to remind him that when Rosie was a delightful clean slate at eight pounds, John had been a tangled ball or nerves and he hadn’t been Sherlock’s, thus Rosie hadn’t been Sherlock’s either. John very much wants to remind Sherlock that Sherlock had been named godfather but hadn’t taken the job very seriously at first. John wonders if Sherlock has deleted the baptism, but it’s best to let these things go. Afterall, once he had started to take the job seriously, he’d never once faltered.
By the time Mrs. Hudson turned around, he’d managed to regain some semblance of control.
ooOOOoo
“No.” She cut him off and glared at him.
Mycroft, however, ignored the captain and leaned forward.
Sherlock, of course, hadn’t even woken up.
“Brilliant.” John rubbed his hand over his unshaven cheek. “You’re a genius.”
reads it wrong.
“Do you need something for the pain?” he asked, still keeping his voice low and affecting a professional attitude. “Morphine? I’ll get you settled then get ice for your arm.”
Beside him, sitting cross-legged on the bed in a crisp white uniform and cap, a nurse looked over at him and smiled. John, dumbfounded, stared at her hand with its polished red nails as it slid through Sherlock’s curls.
“I didn’t have a choice – they didn’t give me a choice,” Sherlock continued.
“London,” the man corrects. “Nowhere near Whitehall, of course.”
Something that might take his mind, for a time a least, from the dreariness and hopelessness of his future as a disabled army doctor.
“What do you mean? Grounding?” John asked, more soberly.
John had carefully counted the steps from the work room to the cottage through the tunnel, and lamps and torches were kept ready at either end. He knew exactly how long it took to traverse it, as well. He had every confidence that Sherlock and Molly would be able to get back into the work room within ten minutes when the need arose.
, do, especially with his father.”
“And our theme is Camelot,” Al added. “What? It’s quirky – but it means everyone can wear what they want and feel perfectly comfortable.”
Sherlock, however, turned back to the matrix, apparently oblivious.
John could have been exasperated, indignant, put out. But he wasn’t any of those things. He was, in fact, intrigued, curious. Excited. Sherlock Holmes was by far the most interesting thing that he’d encountered since coming to Rosethorne, and he was allowing himself to teeter dangerously close to the other man’s substantial gravitational pull.
“Mycroft would have loved this,” he said. “He’d have worn it around his neck like a medical alert device. He’d have taken it off before bed and kissed it and placed it in a custom-designed bedside shrine." He smiled, and John, gripping Rosie’s hand, blinked back ridiculous tears. “And I’d have constantly reminded him that my medal was bigger.” He held the two up together. “John will do something appropriate with mine. Wrap it up and pass it down to our grandson, perhaps. But I’ll take care of Mycroft's – put it in a place of honour. Give him the respect now that I never showed him during life.”
Mrs. Hudson fell and broke her leg. The entire staff succumbed to flu.
William Sherlock Scott Holmes. 30 years old. Service status classified. A terse paragraph requesting that all details about the patient, including his location, be kept strictly confidential.
“It’s mostly an inconvenience,” Sherlock acknowledged. He grew more serious. “It’s betrayed me on more than one occasion.”
The day was filled with closed doors, tiptoeing staff and hushed voices. While John spent the day  frustrated and isolated in the infirmary reviewing the file of a patient who’d be arriving later in the week, Molly was summoned to Mycroft’s office to participate in the grand kick-off.
“And now you’ve lost it – since your injury, I mean.”
Chapter 22
Holmes’ face tightened just enough for John to take notice. He was the type of man who didn’t betray emotions, undoubtedly an expert at maintaining a smooth, level exterior. Watchful. Calculating.
He spoke quietly, as soothingly as he once had to his wife, and Sherlock seemed to comply, breathing in tandem with John’s instructions until he at last opened his eyes, blinking against the light, the sensory assault as his brain attempted to sort itself again, to order events, to pull together fragments of memories and distorted stimuli and let them coalesce into this new reality.
He drifted off to sleep then, but John stood beside his bed for a long time, slowly letting go of the breath he’d been holding for six long months.
“And do find something for the pain that won’t make him high as a kite,” she said. “He’s going to be very cross with me for using the morphine.”
John was already shaking his head.
He took a single step then froze in place.
He sits on an over-stuffed chair to pull his shoes on, then limps to the door and picks up his cane.
John decides to try not to let Rosie’s preferences influence him.  He’s accepted that she’s nearly grown and gone, and while she’ll visit them – often, he hopes – she’ll likely not live with them again. He measures the distance in his head between Cambridge and London, Cambridge and Sussex, Sussex and wherever it is that Rosie will eventually settle.
It’s every bit as inviting as it looks, and they slide sideways into retirement in Sussex without hoopla or fanfare.
“DIgging was unproductive - given that I was seven years old and Mycroft made me do most of the digging. So we built a treehouse instead, or part of one,” Sherlock muttered, watching the beam of John’s torch illuminate the smooth dirt walls and ceiling of the tunnel. “Well - does it look safe enough for you?”
“Mycroft brought you here to Rosethorne. He told you it was a place where you could recover and heal but you knew you’d be left alone here, and you craved that peace. You
“Actually, I do.”
“Very good.” The man stands up straighter.  “And what the hell is a consulting detective?”
“Well - that - that was inconvenient.”
“You’re thinking too much,” Sherlock whispered with the so-familiar squeeze to his hand.
Holmes was alone in the room.
“Hey Sherlock,” she said. “Al made an appointment next week for a fitting for all the men in the wedding party.”
It was all going rather well, John thought, eying Mycroft. He was seated between the Potter boys, probably talking about Quidditch. George, seated directly across from them, was leaning in with interest, and John grinned and returned to his meal, half-listening to Sherlock and Hermione Granger-Weasley discuss safety at Hogwarts, when something else caught his ear.
“Of course it is. I have it on good authority you’ve met my brother.”
“We should get moving,” Sherlock murmured,
“Arthur. I choose Arthur.”
“You’re not allergic, are you?” John said, keeping his voice as calm and as low as Sherlock’s.
“I think - this.” He was fiddling with the sturdy pegs on which the shelf rested and reached out to touch the third. He pushed - hard - and the peg slid back through the hole into which it was inserted.
John had taken his leave then, occupying himself with a new task - two of the patients were being transferred out, deemed fit enough to return to their families, and he had paperwork to compile and case files to complete. He understood, of course, that Mycroft was taking pains to free up his time so he could spend more time with Sherlock and the
“He’s probably eight years old in that photo,” John shot back.
John approached the chair slowly, but stood behind it, hands on the chairback, waiting.
“Mrs. Hudson will show you your quarters and introduce you to the staff and the patients.”
“He’s not as jittery as he was at the beginning.” Mrs. Hudson walked beside John as he headed back to his rooms. “The air is good for him here – and the work. He’s outside nearly all of the time, even when the weather is foul. We don’t know what all he gets up to – but he’s made a world of difference in the gardens. We all enjoy going outside for an afternoon walk now that the pathways aren’t choked with grass and weeds. And the roses! We haven’t had such big blooms in years!”
Jesus Christ! Not Molly too!
“The deputy headmaster or headmistress,” Al replied. “Whoever that is when they’re getting ready to send the letters.
“Which explains quite a bit about my grandfather, I think. He was the legitimate heir, but perhaps not the most loved, perhaps not even the first-born.”
“Statute of Secrecy,” Lee warned from his seat near the back of the plane. “Percy showed up at my flat yesterday to personally read the entire statute to me.” He rolled his eyes. “He was there for three hours.”
“I’m not?” Sherlock glances around the room – a bedsit. Sparse and sterile. He doesn’t let his eyes linger on the gun on the bed.
He stood at the bottom of the tree and looked up to see what had once most certainly been an elaborate tree house. It was higher up in the tree than John thought he’d have allowed a child to climb, though probably no higher than a first-floor window. John imagined it closer to the ground in days gone by, when the oak hadn’t been quite so mighty. Though the tree itself had grown around the house, he could make out a rail, and something that glinted in the speckled sunlight, and what might have been a castle turret had it not been perched in an old oak tree.
“I’m sure that’s it,” Mrs. Hudson agreed.
was the one who said I should be doing something more meaningful. Or relevant. Look – I don’t remember what he said, but I certainly didn’t complain.”
John reached for Sherlock’s hand and grasped it, pulling him slightly off balance so that he tipped forward and steadied himself with a knee on the bench beside John’s leg.
Sherlock hums, and bends to examine the rotted wood around the loose screws.
“You really are brilliant, you know,” he said. Their faces were dangerously close to each other, and Sherlock’s expression softened as he and John locked eyes.
“Alright. Alright.” John reached forward to measure the man’s pulse again, but dropped his hand before he touched him. “I’m going to take your pulse now, and I need to check your head and see if you have any other injuries.”

“Of course with you! You won’t let me poke about outside on my own, will you? I suppose I could have Mrs. Hudson accompany me, or Molly Hooper.”
“Probably should have told your parents, then,” John noted.
John sighed. He certainly wasn’t going to beat Sherlock at this game. “I can’t.” He gestured at the bird. “He might see it.”
“It’s not broken,” Harry’s friend announced authoritatively. “But you’ll want to ice it and elevate it.”
oooOOOOooo
His shoulders sagged, his head bowed, and his stomach paunched out as he relaxed his abdominal muscles. He somehow looked both bony and boneless, and had John looked up to see him for the first time, a stranger in a wheelchair, in a suit from a bygone day, he’d have thought him very, very old indeed.
“What did you tell her?” He’d unfolded himself from the chair where he’d slept for the last three hours, and was following her through Billy Wiggin’s room. The bed was empty – still made up.
ooOOO
“What do you need, Sherlock?” He let his gaze move to John, and stared at him long enough for the others to take notice. “I’ve given you all you’ve asked for.”
