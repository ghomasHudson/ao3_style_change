After a couple minutes Donovan stomps by to manage the yellow tape again in a dark mood. I stroll back towards the front steps of the house and settle us in a semi-shady spot. Rosie is calming as I do. She starts to smile again around the time Greg comes out and sits to my right and starts to make faces at Rosie. We both start laughing at his antics.
Sherlock and I change Rosie. I wash my hands in the river then use a wipe. Take a drink out of my canteen and wish I’d thought to bring something along for my fever and aches. Sherlock holds a bottle out to me, Excedrin. “Do you know how much I love you?” I ask taking the bottle.
I place the tray in the kitchen and look down the hall, Sherlock is still in the room with Rosie. I head over to the monitor on the mantle and turn it up, he’s singing a lullaby at her lowly. I turn the volume back down and compose myself before turning back to Mrs. H. “That looks lovely Mrs. Hudson.” I wander into the kitchen where there is a cup of tea prepared how I like. I open the freezer, grab a large icepack, pick up my cup and head out to the lounge.
I open my eyes and answer, “Shouldn’t I be asking you that?” A bit harsher than I intended.
Distressed, turning back, “Do you know how close I came to following you off that roof? What losing you did to me? I was so depressed. After your funeral, I crawled into a bottle for a week.” Deep shuddering breath, a tear rolls down his left cheek, “I took my gun once along with a bottle to your headstone. I passed out before I could pull the trigger. Woke up with the mother of all hangovers, in my bed at Baker Street, gun locked up, not a bullet in the flat. I suspect Mycroft had something to do with it.” Another tear.
Rosie falls asleep almost as soon as she lands in her crib. I grab the monitor and close the door to her room and the door across the entry hall. I wander into the sitting room where Sherlock is clicking through the channels on the TV. “I didn’t know there were this many cooking shows John. Look at this.” I glance at the channel guide he picked up and half the channels show someone cooking something. He clicks on Martha Bakes and starts to watch her bake crisps.
“It’s a versatile recipe, you can vary flours for different textures and flavours. Replace some of the water with melted butter and/or milk and add sugar to make a sticky bun dough, roll out after first rise and brush with melted butter and add cinnamon sugar and/or chopped nuts; roll, slice and place in a well buttered pan or muffin tins to rise.
Taking a deep breath I grab the cleaned items and walk back to where Sherlock is kneeling.
Calmly, “Paid consultant with the MET with my assistant Sherlock Holmes. I’m taking over Dr. Elias Quincy’s contract, he only lectures once a week. There’ll be a lot of time left for chasing criminals.”
“Together or not at all Sherlock. We need to stay together, I can’t watch your back if I can’t see you.” John stares at Sherlock until he nods. “Right, I’ll get Rosie. We’ll grab our guns, I put extra clips and ammunition in the diaper bag.”
“Yeah, I couldn’t abide bacon until recently. We’ve been kind of keeping with the diet though. Sherlock used to eat half my bacon before anyway, so nothing has changed that way. So far we’ve been sticking with mostly chicken and fish with a lot of vegetables and a variety of beans and tofu.” John sighs “I was surprised Sherlock went along with the diet change myself. Though he did steal the bacon and sausages when Mrs. Hudson insisted on cooking a full English the first few weeks. He was quick, don’t think she ever noticed. If she did she never said anything. We didn’t have the heart to tell her no, she means so well.”
“John!”
are you doing?”
What he needs is rare, but he knows somehow that he will find it here.
The window is painted shut, she'd explained earlier, apologetic, so the room is muggy and stuffy and smells like there's mould lurking behind the plaster.
“Sherlock!” John says sharply. “This is out of line, yeah? I'm calling you a cab. Calm down.” He reaches into his pocket for his phone.
Sherlock hugs him.  The tea probably spills again; he doesn’t care.  John starts, and then hugs him back with his free arm, squeezing tight around his back and burying his face against Sherlock’s coat.  Perfect, Sherlock thinks, this is perfect, perfect, perfect.  He tucks his head into the crook of John’s neck and breathes deep.
“Nowhere else does terrible grilled cheese, John!”
“We’ll eat next time, then.”
“John Watson. Such a dull name.”
Sherlock hums like he's laughing inside.  "Hardly defenseless," he says with a nudge of his nose against John's ear.
“My landlady.  She lives in the flat downstairs.”
All John hears is the man talking around the question, and he has to struggle not to cut him off.
“And… And you make this bizarre potato dish. What's wrong with chips? Chips are perfectly serviceable, but no, you insist on horrible diced potatoes with burnt onions and then you have the gall, the utter
He hears his brother stand breathing heavily in the doorway for a few moments.  Then there’s a rush of movement and a thump of shoes on his bedroom carpet and his sheet is swept away from him, balled up in Mycroft’s arms, heedless of the not-yet-dry paint.
“You've got my attention, mate, go on. John Watson, that's me. Shall I call you a cab?”
"Lunch with your sister today, isn't it?" He cups his palm around the base of John's head and strokes a thumb over the edge of his ear.
She goes on.  "I think you're lovely, honestly, but--"
“He’ll be put in the special class at school! He’ll have to live in a home when he’s older.  He sat in a cold bath for an
“You came to meet me?”
“I’m not his date,” is all John can think to say.
“Where are the puffins?”
“Thank you,” John snaps, glancing through his cards to make sure they're all still there before flipping the wallet shut. “Do you normally dig through blokes' bags and read their cards aloud to them?”
?" And now she's almost shouting, her lovely warm voice gone high-pitched, and she's gathering herself up in her own arms and pulling away from him.
Sherlock stares at him, thinking hard, piecing together a puzzle made from tatty jumpers and black eyes and loneliness.
And right about now is when the man Sherlock was years ago would have told John in no uncertain terms how ridiculous, how unfounded his anxiety is, how it's laughable John would ever think that in London, of all places, a pink shirt, faint and swirling floral print and open collar and all, would somehow out him, that wearing it would be making some sort of statement.
The boy tips his head up.
“Have you had a fire?” he asks Sherlock as the other man bustles around the room, haphazardly stacking up loose pieces of sheet music.  “It smells like burnt plastic in here.”  It only occurs to him after he speaks that this is perhaps not the most polite way to talk about a flat he was just welcomed into.
Sherlock knew they would do.
Sherlock has dropped a hand over his eyes and tipped his head downward.
He gorges himself on steaming hot rice, pillowy dumplings, and pork lo-mein, and wonders if he is doomed to be constantly dazzled by tall, blue-eyed men.
When the desire to hit something finally leaves him some time later that evening, all he’s left with is a bleak empty feeling just below his ribcage and a loneliness he just isn’t able to shake.
He looks for the clock again.  Six-thirty.  Bingo.  Where is he?
"Like I dunno, John, but you're so
A rough tug at his collar, a ponderous, put-upon presence at his shoulder.  Mycroft.  Sherlock ignores him, tries to analyze the why of the perfect dress.
John snorts.  “I hate the other children at school.”
John freezes.  Sherlock is chewing at his bottom lip, brow furrowed.  His words tumble over and over in John’s mind.  What the hell does that mean? What the hell does that even mean?
All of a sudden it is a week or an hour or some amount of days later and Sherlock is for some reason standing on the pavement outside the flat and John has a cab waiting and his leather duffel slung over his shoulder and is saying things like “I’ll see you in two weeks” and “Don’t burn the flat down, yeah?”
“This is my place,” he insists again.  “This is my dream.  Get away from my rock pool.”
He can't be arsed about any of that.
His mind is shuffling together sentences, admonitions, trying to work out how best to express his displeasure at being treated like a donation bin at Christmas.  It’s probably in vain; when his temper boils over, any planned words he has tend to go straight out of his head.  And John’s had plenty of experience losing his temper.  He’s got anger issues just like every other Watson he’s ever known.  Before she died, his Gran used to say that the family blood was spiked with vinegar.  John could say now with some certainty it was more likely whiskey.
I carefully unstrap and pick up Rosie without waking her, as Sherlock and Kevin grab her bags. I follow Kevin into the house passing the claw foot tub on the screened porch. I’m happy to notice a stacked washer and dryer unit there as well. Rosie’s room is across from the kitchen. “I ended up buying a mattress for the crib, figured the dogs could use it when you go. I used a doubled up flat sheet on it for now.” He grins over his shoulder at me, placing a bag on the bureau by the window. Sherlock leaves his bag on the floor next to the crib.
The nurse behind the desk picks up the papers and pales. She hastily brings them over to Dr Angele and shoves them under his nose. The reply on his lips dies unmentioned as he in turn pales. I can’t help but wonder what Mycroft threated him with as I discretely wave at the camera in thanks.
Kevin was up already and had changed Rosie before John and Sherlock made it out of their room. A package containing collection of fireworks on the dining table when the honeymooners finally made an appearance, dressed for the day. Sherlock and John found Kevin in the kitchen flipping homemade sausage patties with one hand while bouncing a giggling Rosie on his opposite hip.
John finally realizes where he is, and what he’s doing “Shite!” while quickly rocking back and to the side to sit, hard, on the floor, in front of the couch. “I’m so sorry Greg! Are you alright?” Holding his left arm in his right across his chest.
Before we start eating Kevin pours us glasses of champagne “To your marriage, may you have many happy years together!” he toasts and drains half his glass. Sherlock and I sip our glasses and thank Kevin. The rest of our dinner is passed with pleasant conversation, fantastic food and pleasant company. Kevin had baked the day before so we had chocolate chip biscuits and tea for dessert.
Smiling, “That settles it then.” Kissing Sherlock again, “Mike is going to take my stiches out tomorrow.” Dancing his left eyebrow, flirting.
We both undress on our way to the loo. Brush our teeth side-by-side at the sink. Sherlock starts the water in the shower and sets the temperature just a bit hotter than I like. It feels good though as it hits my abused shoulder, releasing the tension that had built throughout the day.
“Oh John, this is fantastic!” Sherlock beams as he reads through the letter from Mrs. H detailing our discussion. He gives me a great bone-crushing hug and another passionate kiss.
At the gate - Burton
“We went shopping earlier, I thought we bought all the stuff we’ll need…” The kettle clicks off.
I smile fondly toward Sherlock who answers, “Scorpions.”
“The case took longer than anticipated and we needed to spend the night. The only room left in town only had one bed, some sort of event. In the middle of the night I woke up spooned to Sherlock’s back, rock hard. I ended up wanking in the loo before being able to get back to sleep.
“The same way I look at you.” Same tone back.
“Interesting, she has called me ‘dada’ and ‘mama’ before.” I walk across the kitchen, I left my pills on the counter earlier. “Do you want tea? Not sure what your routine is.”
Mike answers, “They sure do, check out the bag.” Pointing at the table next to John.
“Last I looked, Sherlock was a grown man able to make decisions for himself.” The driver stops outside of 221B. “Don’t bother getting out.”
John replies, “I don’t have much of an appetite yet, take half of mine.”
John hugs Sherlock to him again, “I think I always wanted to be a Doctor. I tried to nurse every injured animal I found back to health, succeeded quite a bit considering. I hid in my room away from Dad so often at night all I had to do was study. I ended up going to university mostly on academic scholarships.”
I believe Sherlock and I would have preferred to dine just the three of us but as Mrs. H provided the stew we couldn’t complain about her joining us. Sherlock feeds Rosie gravy bread (well soaked) and some of the vegetables, mashed, from the stew. He points the spoon at the various foods and she waves her hand at what she wants. She seems to like the carrots and potatoes mashed together best.
Exasperated John asks “What do they want with us?”
With a soft voice, “Let me do a quick exam. Afraid I’ll have to use a light, I’ll try to be quick.” Doctor Jacobs clicks on a pen light taken from his pocket. Inspects John’s eyes. Removes the bandage wrapped around his head to check the wound, using his pen light to see, pressing here and there. Does a few quick movement and strength tests, all without waking Sherlock. “I’d like an MRI to be sure, but I believe time will fix your symptoms John.”
“I get that Sherlock, I don’t want to hurt you. I’ve done enough of that already. Are you really sure you want me to do this? Release? You mean an orgasm? Wouldn’t, um, uh, masturbation work? I don’t want you to resent me if this doesn’t work out. I enjoy being your flatmate and friend; I don’t want to jeopardize that.”
“Euros. She disguised herself and flirted with me on the bus, gave me her number without my prompting. I tried to throw it out but I was so flattered, I couldn’t do it. We texted. Nothing more, but deep down I wanted more. She was clever and amusing. I did end it before it got too far; I felt guilty for cheating.
“I met him last week, not a psychopathic serial killer, seemed okay. He cares for her.” Sighing in contentment, snuggling next to John.
Sherlock clicks the next photo listed as ‘power’, it shows solar panels. Victory, electricity! I feel Sherlock’s thigh relax even further under my hand. Next photo is listed as ‘garage2’, looks like it’s attached to the back of the first. Shows a white Jeep, assorted long handled tools hanging on one wall the other with a pile of wood split into kindling. The last picture is taken from the left front of the house, it shows the tarps rolled up, and there are piles of split wood stacked neatly underneath. There is another large pile in front of the house and what looks like another pile outside of the garage. I can’t help but think ‘how cold does it get there?’
“Sherlock, you promised you were not going to go off on your own this time. That. Was. The. Deal.” I snarl.
Most of the day we wandered around a pond and creek on the property. I skipped a few rocks and taught Sherlock how as well. I think Sherlock deleted how to skip a stone over the water. I feel extremely privileged the few times I am able to teach him something and today was no exception.
Sherlock turns, Kevin points out five more places where there were cabins. He sheepishly mentions at one “This is the one I didn’t turn the water off at and drained the storage tank. I make sure to turn off or at least seal it now.” We’re at another crossroad “if you head straight we’ll end up by the pond you saw on the way in. The cabin up there was another place I almost moved into.” Sherlock headed that way, just as curious as I was. We drive by four more places with piles of cement pillars. We end up at a cabin and a large detached garage, across the way is what looks like a double stall horse barn. “I liked this place and the location, but it’s smaller and there wasn’t a lot of storage. It’s built well, 2 bedrooms, 1 bath and a decent sized living/dining/kitchen area. I’ve left all the places unlocked if you want to go in any. If you find any locked, let me know where they are. Only two are lived in and two have weekend visitors.
Sherlock opens the next email “Kitchen cabinet contents, freezer and refrigerator from the note. Says he won’t bore us with the pots, pans, dishes or utensils. Let us start with the refrigerator, see if he has a head or two.” He gives me a wicked grin and clicks the picture link marked ‘fridge’. The fridge freezer door is open showing only ice cube trays. The body of the refrigerator has eggs, bacon, milk, orange juice, assorted cheeses and sliced meats. Lots of dark leafy greens a few sodas, a couple more beers and what looks like a gallon pitcher of iced tea. I hear Sherlock whisper “heathen” at seeing the tea container.
Neither of us move.
“Daddy!” Little Rosie runs across the room to hug her father.
“Euros in a mood today then?” I hug back as tightly as I’m receiving, Sherlock is vibrating.
“No case. Got off early, been texting you to see if you were up to a pub night. You weren’t answering and I grew concerned when Sherlock didn’t reply either. Guess we’ll have to do a rain-check though if you’re not feeling up to it.” Greg steps closer as he is talking. “You want me to try massaging your neck and shoulders? Might help…” reaching out one hand and giving John’s right shoulder a squeeze.
Lestrade, sounding tired and resigned “So, tell me again why you had to shoot Muldoon?”
“Should have had Mycroft’s minions do this, he owes me.” John growls.
“Oh, yeah, right. What about them?” John wonders, absently rubbing his right temple where the stitches were.
Smiling “Obviously, thank you love.” Giving Sherlock a closed mouth kiss.
Ella’s relaxation techniques are not working! I know Sherlock will give me time, but I may need more than I asked for… I just seem to become more furious the further I walk away. How could Kevin be such an arse? We’ve travelled around the world to do him a favour… not helping the anger John. Think of something happy…
I sigh, “Just full of questions this morning aren’t you? Yeah, I married a woman. I thought she was what I wanted. At the time, I couldn’t imagine Sherlock ever wanting someone like me. Our first dinner together he told me he was ‘Married to his Work’. Little did I know, I had become a part of his work? I married Mary thinking I knew everything I needed to about her; I was wrong. At the reception I realized Sherlock’s feelings for me during his best man speech.
“Alright, good, that’s good.” Grin on his face. “I hope they approve of me.” John adds nervously.
Seeing everything has calmed down Angelo reappears with hot coffee all around and the plates for the tiramisu. He serves himself and joins us for coffee and pudding. After he swallows his first forkful he says “Well, this night will be memorable.”
Agent Kreisler “Main house? This isn’t where you live?”
“The officers didn’t think to wonder where the harpoon went. I think they forgot what floor and what flat they arrested him near. No one ever came looking for it so I kept it.” Shrugging a shoulder.
I groan when I finally open my eyes a couple minutes later. My vision a bit blurry with a headache behind it. Next thing I know I’m gently rolled onto my stomach as Sherlock starts to massage my neck and shoulders. “Mmm, feels good babe.”
Short chapter, I know. Getting the past done with so the future can unfold.
“Why, you going to trade me in for a newer model?” Glancing at his husband and noticing the taught lines. “Or are you jealous? You know I only have eyes for you.”
“John, Mycroft sent over Mary’s file. You probably shouldn’t read it.” There’s a thick folder on the kitchen table between them.
He sits back, takes a deep breath and with a suppressed grin. “Oh, yes. Miss Bunny Wigglesworth.” Waves a hand at the blond woman, who continues to smile vacuously at me. “If you would be so good as to start at the beginning again Miss Wigglesworth.” Placing his hands in his thinking ‘prayer’ position as he leans back in his chair, half closing his eyes.
“Best I’ve slept in years, thank you John.” Sherlock kisses my temple.
Sherlock starts coffee in a press after flicking on the kettle. “Harry started ordering John to move out and look into adoption options for Rosie. She didn’t even notice her niece was healthy, happy and well-loved here.” Waving an arm to encompass the flat, “We even cleaned yesterday, well mostly John, but I helped. She complained about the dust bothering her allergies before she even took off her coat.”
Homelessness was still an issue but not illegal. Yet. Begging for money on the streets, however, was illegal.
Greg sits up straight, indignant, “Of course I did, and I informed her in person myself. Even offered to drive her into town to see him.”
As John washes up from breakfast, the three agents are taking Sherlock’s statement. Agent Kreisler writing as Sherlock’s right hand is out of commission. When John comes back to the table, there are three FBI agents stunned by the attention to detail Sherlock threw at them. Sherlock even supplied information not known to even their research team. When John signs the bottom of his statement, agent Parks gets a call informing them the Sheriff is at the gates. One of the agents must have contacted the coroner before coming down to the main house.
“Oh, John. Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you.”
“Almost didn’t. “
Sherlock looks closer and frowns, “You alright? You seem off.”
There is light coming from under a door from the ground floor flat along with the noises of the telly turned to what sounds like a late-night talk show. Slowly the man climbs the steps to the first floor, testing every step before committing his weight to it. He doesn’t want to alert anyone to his presence. At least not yet.
I take a calming breath. “No… you go on. Investigate. It’s fine, good. We’ll be outside.” He wants to investigate but he wants to be with us, I can tell from his body language. “Stay, we’ll be just outside. We won’t leave without you. Promise.” I give him a quick kiss on the cheek, squeeze his hand and leave.
John, not having taken off his gun belt, releases the clasp, freeing his weapon. Sherlock draws closer to John, soundlessly. They stay in the dark, watching for movement outside. Several minutes later, they are rewarded by the sight of a strange man sneaking up the side of the house along the creek. John softly tells the dogs to “stay” and as quiet as they can the two work their way out the back door, Sherlock in the lead. John, weapon drawn and ready, guarding his rear.
“I like the country, I have my eye on a place in Sussex that would be a perfect place to retire to.” Sherlock replies.
“Have you fired a rifle before Sherlock?” Kevin is behaving.
The Sydney Opera House was exquisite in its detail. Its box also contained a small stuffed koala bear wearing a tan jumper. The small stuffed penguin toy from Madagascar was a surprise.
“I wanted to show up sober, I did, really. Then I drove by a pub and thought just one won’t hurt none. I was happy once, I need… I couldn’t face… god I don’t know…” She starts to cry.
“Yes. I acquired nerve damage resulting from the injury and subsequent infection.”
John can tell it is going to be a long, involved, highly detailed, oration. Not wanting to hear the lecture, yet again, “Okay, I get it, I know. But, you have to admit the DNA results show almost identical markers, clearly a very close relation.” Trying to be reasonable.
I cap the specimen cup off and cover John up before slipping off the gloves and opening the curtain. The nurse is waiting and takes the cup with her gloved hand and walks off placing the label. She calls over her shoulder “I’ll be back in a few for a blood sample.”
“Hey, that’s my line Kevin” I laugh at him.
I look at the Doctor, who didn’t seem to understand what John had said. “He says he has a bladder infection, or bloody pee. He has had a backache for the past week and half and has been a bit peaky lately.” I tell him.
“Hmm, he had a therapy session today, they have a tendency to wear him out. Did you notice if he had any shopping with him? He mentioned going to the shops on the way back.” Sherlock reports.
We thank him for his offer and hop back into the Jeep. Sherlock slows going by an empty flat, cement pillars piled then two more ‘cabins’ still standing, one with a detached garage. “Not sure what I’m going to do with these two places yet, they are in decent shape.” Kevin adds driving by. Shortly after we get back to the road that leads to the house.
Violet grins, “Call me Violet or Mummy dear. We’re both doing very well John. Sherlock told me you were doing much better after your ordeal; dreadful business, simply dreadful. We are glad you and your baby girl could come and join us.” Eagerly taking Rosie from his arms, “Let me help you.”
Lestrade leans in closer, “Not all Masters are kindly and some of them encourage their slaves to not breed, even going so far as to castrate the men. As for food, some owners only allow their slaves to eat their leftovers, some of the places I’ve seen…”
Sherlock’s brow furrows “I can’t help but wonder why you would acquire such a breed of dog living here?”
John frowns, “I’m not an escaped slave though… Hey, doesn’t Crawley run a bunch of newspapers and tabloids or something?”
Also, all my ‘children’ have four legs and fur for a very good reason.
“Thanks to the idiots who sent us there I was promoted to Captain and awarded both the Queens Medal and your countries Medal of Valour.” I take a large sip of my cognac. “As Kevin recovered we became friends. He was part of the team that rescued me in Kandahar.” I drain my drink with a shaking hand. “Sherlock knows some of that story, Bill Murry told him a bit of it at our reception.” I get up and grab the bottle of cognac and add a couple more fingers to all three drink glasses. Between this and the bottle of champagne we finished at dinner, we’ll be sure to have hangovers tomorrow.
From the doorway “There is another dog pen up here, you bring the dogs up when you stay here?” Sherlock wonders.
I did my best. James claimed a previous engagement and sent congratulations on our pending nuptials hoping there is no attempted murder at this one. He did however, mention having us come stay at his place in the future.
John gives a curt nod. “Excellent,” before sitting on the arm of chair then adjusting a curl on Sherlock’s forehead.
“You won’t.” Confidant
“You are amazing love!” Brandishing the harpoon, “I’ll get some brackets and hang it above the firebox in C flat, would that be alright? Best we keep it out of Rosie’s reach.”
“When the second man came in range I noticed he had a piece of wood in his hands. I was able to block the first few blows and knock the weapon out of his hands, pinning him, face first, against the alley wall. When I heard movement behind me, I turned to look. That is where everything goes black.
“You have a child John, you can’t go running off at all hours…” Trying to be sensible.
“Is that why you kept saying you weren’t gay?” Sherlock ponders.
John looks around, “So where is our budding architect then?”
“They know you’ve moved back in with Rosie. Mycroft couldn’t inform them of that fact fast enough it seems.” Sigh. “He may have also slipped that I didn’t leave your side the entire time you were in hospital.” Bouncing Rosie on his knee, just to have her giggle and smile. “I wanted to tell them about us in person, together.”
Rosie has been feeling a bit of jet lag, her sleep schedule seems to be stuck on California time for most of the first week back. This has been a tough week as Sherlock and I are trying our best to keep Rosie awake during the daylight hours. The fact that she has a couple more teeth coming in isn’t helping either.
“Bedroom Sherlock, we’ll need lube for what I have in mind…” I murmur into his mouth.
Sherlock looks through the kitchen door and reminds Greg, “Seriously Greg, don’t wake John, let him sleep.” Before turning back into the kitchen.
“But you chose her…”
“We missed you too. She wouldn’t eat the first day, refused everything, even biscuits until you skyped.”
Sherlock leans up and kisses John “I love you too John.”
Sherlock looks as though he’s storing everything in his mind palace or in mild shock.
Sherlock rocks back to sit on his heels to let me see his progress. “Impressive” The room has never looked this clean before. “How much more do you have to finish?”
Agent Parks drives out to the gates to lead the coroners van in, John having lent him his gate key.
He gives me a quick look while we’re stopped. “I haven’t been on holiday since I was a teenager. Even then I was expected to learn something.” Watching the road once more as the car crept forward. “The summers I spent with my Grand’Mere I had to perfect my French, she refused to speak English.”
Sherlock tightens his grip on my hand. “I won’t have you die on my account, I would be lost without you John.”
“Good, because I almost didn’t survive.” Mumbled, turning away
John glances up from the newspaper laid out on the coffee table in front of him. “He took Rosie for a walk in the park since the sun is shining. I have another headache threatening and stayed in; I’m still having issues with bright lights, this bloody concussion is lingering. What’s up, got a case?”
Sherlock interrupts by asking “Do you need me to write out your statement for you John?” He looks so earnest. Greg is gaping at him, mouth open and everything.
Sherlock has an experiment going that takes over the entire kitchen of 221B. John, in need of a cuppa figures he’ll just pop out to grab two cups of nirvana from Speedy’s. John doesn’t even bother to put on his coat, he wasn’t planning on being gone long. He only grabbed his keys and £10 from his wallet, more than enough for two cups of coffee and a couple sweet rolls.
1 tablespoon olive oil
“We found you, thankfully they kept your phone and left it on. Lestrade booked them for murder, kidnapping and assault. Mycroft found most of the assault on CCTV video. They aren’t getting out anytime soon.” Coming back to stand bedside and holding John’s hand again.
“If it’s too much Mrs. H, I can probably find something….” I start to add in.
John was in his armchair sipping a cup of tea while reading the newspaper when Sherlock strolled in and tossed a hat with a pair dark sunglasses folded up inside onto his lap. Picking them up and looking at Sherlock, John asks, “What’s this for?” John thought they left these at Sherlock’s parents when they had visited over Easter.
“Not without a magic hat Pumpkin.” Daddy John tries to calm her down, patting snow into another smaller ball.
She looks at me, then John very surprised “She still looks like both of you.”
John Watson, OMC, Sherlock Holmes
Going down the hallway he notices the light is on over the sink in the loo, the door is slightly ajar, pausing he determines no one is in the room. The man stops in the open doorway to the bedroom. With help from the glow of light through the glass door to the loo, he sees there is a t-shirt clad, blond man lying on his stomach in the bed, apparently asleep. The t-shirt he was wearing had ridden up and the bedsheet was barely offering any modesty to the man’s bare buttocks. The sleeping man has had a hard time of it lately from the scars and bruises visible on his muscular frame. There are two prescription bottles on the bedside table along with a half empty bottle of water. The blond man on the bed moans and shifts his position, exposing more of one muscular arse cheek.
I finish my morning ablutions quickly and head back to our room to dress for the day.
I wanted to see if there was anything in the Spice & Tea Exchange shop for Mrs. H while Sherlock took Rosie to find a stuffed seal toy at the gift shop nearby. I notice there are posters for Fleet Week a couple weeks out, we might have to come down and check it out. Sherlock meets me at one of the posters and puts Rosie back in her harness with a new seal toy. I notice Sherlock has a fairly large bag of other stuffed critters as well. As he does up the last strap to secure Rosie I give him a kiss.
“Okay, that’s not too hard. Time still at half six?”
Sherlock glances at his watch “Molly, she and Mrs. Hudson said they’ll will watch her for however long we’re here.”
“Right. Chinese good?”
The man, Lestrade, replies just as low, but without the growl, “Your brother insisted I come here and keep you company. He doesn’t like you being in here by yourself.” Looking at the catalogue and the numbered paddle on the table, “You here to buy someone Sherlock? Didn’t think you approved of slaves.” Voice still low.
No answer. Sirens can be heard in the background.
“It was painful to see you pining away after Irene Adler. When Mycroft told me she was dead I lied to save your feelings.  I tried to support you as best I could without letting you know how much pain I was in. Seemed like you wanted to be with her more than me. I was even jealous of Moriarty, he stimulated you so.
Turning back, “Bart’s, I’ll be teaching and an official consultant with the MET.” Confident, standing tall.
“Ooof, I still need to breathe! You’re looking good yourself old man.” I joke back, Kevin is a year older than me. I turn and bring Sherlock closer to my side with my hand at the small of his back “This is my husband Sherlock and our daughter Rosie. Sherlock this is Sargent Kevin Andrews US Marine, retired.”
“Oh, wonderful dear. Rather fast with the ceremony, one of you isn’t pregnant now are you?” she laughs, I can hear Father chuckling in the background. “Where are you registered dear? We want to get you the perfect gift.” Sherlock and I look at one another. We don’t need anything between what we already had and what I brought from the townhouse. Violet is starting to worry with the silence. “Darling boy are you still there?”
“I’ve rarely seen you in a tie. I thought you didn’t like to wear them?” I frown at him.
“I know you do John and you do contribute more than you know. You can pay for dinner tonight.” as he hands his card over to Stephon.
“Well Greg, from the looks of it you have a few options. Option one, you can try to get the keys from us.” The look John gives says ‘you and what army’. “Option two, you take a cab home and collect your car in the morning. Or, option three, you spend the night here.”
Sherlock runs a hand down John’s back, “You don’t have your gun?”
John starts off by giving Sherlock a kiss on the lips, trying to put as much feeling as he can into it. Staring into Sherlock’s eyes John states firmly, “Sherlock, I love you, I’m not going anywhere. I am here for as long as you will have me.”
John was relieved to see the replica of Big Ben in his hands. This package was different from the others as it contained a note, ‘Angelo’s, 7pm’, dated for that night in what could only be Sherlock’s scrawl.
“Then one Friday morning at breakfast, Mummy announced Mycroft was going away to boarding school and would be leaving that Sunday. I know now it wasn’t his fault, but I resented him for leaving me behind.
Sherlock is there in an instant holding John’s hand, “John, you had a seizure. Are you okay?”
“Johnny boy! How they hanging little bro?” As Harry walks in, John smells liquor. Harry sneezes. “Man, this place is filthy. Don’t you ever dust this dump?”
Sherlock levels his gaze at me, lifting an eyebrow “John?”
“I’m just glad I woke when I did.” Closing his eyes.
A man.
“No it wasn’t. Harry called... She wants to come over tomorrow, catch up. She was not happy the first time I moved in here, she is really not thrilled to hear that I moved back. Figure I will give her less ammunition to piss her off; she was always on Clara to keep their place spotless. I just have the bathroom after this. I neatened Rosie’s room before we went to the store. Oh, I picked up ingredients to make yellow curry if you want another lesson?” Shaking out the new bottom sheet.
Molly looks at John in the hope he would voice her request. John lifts an eyebrow at Molly, shakes his head and turns to face Sherlock. Before Molly can begin, John looks back at her and suggests, “Molly? Maybe the morgue isn’t the best place for this conversation. What say we go find somewhere a bit more private?”
“Across the way you see the fenced area? There is a small orchard and a small vegetable garden in there. Feel free to raid whatever you want.”
“Mycroft can marry us, he’s a bureaucrat it’s what he does. John? John, breathe for me!” He places Rosie on the floor and takes my hands “Look at me John. There is no need to panic, everything will be ok.”
We enjoyed the shower thoroughly again, this time Sherlock seduced me. After a short nap we ordered room service and ate in front of the telly watching a Dr. Who marathon on BBC America. In the morning, after checking out, Sherlock made a quick stop at the Tout Sweet Patisserie for breakfast and to grab something decent to nibble on the plane home.
She shuffles her feet and informs the floor, “Yes Master. Holmes purchased a slave sir.”
Sherlock whispers in John’s ear low enough so Rosie can’t hear, “John if you start her singing ‘Let It Go’ again I shan’t be responsible for my actions.” Sherlock raises an eyebrow at his husband for emphasis.
By the time I get three fingers into him he’s is panting and sweating. Pre come is leaking out of his gorgeous cock. He groans out “John, please. John I need you. Please” he moans.
“This was the first Harry has bothered to see how John was doing; no visit, card, text, call or flowers.” Sherlock adds, pouring out two mugs of coffee before plopping a tin on the table. Sherlock notes Rosie is getting sleepy. “There are biscuits in the tin. I’ll just pop off to put Rosie to bed.”
The boys are led one by one to the other side of the stage where their new Masters were paying, most leaving with their purchases. A group of young women, teen to mid-thirties, clad only with the ever-present collar and lead, are brought on stage next. Each one put up on a low platform that turned so the slowly diminishing audience could glimpse them from all angles while bidding. The handler pointing out the sights the auctioneer was describing.
Doctor Jacobs enters the room shortly after Anthea leaves, sees the lights are off, he keeps them that way, leaving the door ajar. Glancing around the room he quietly greets Mycroft as he rises to shake hands. “You must know some important people to get me to come here…” he glances at the men intertwined on the bed. “Which one is the patient?” whispered.
The shorter man tilts his head up with a large grin on his face, “And I love you too Sherlock Watson Holmes.”
Just as I was aiming he moans in appreciation around my cock. I feels fantastic. I’m so close. Sherlock takes me as deep as he can and swallows around the tip. That’s it, I’m seeing stars I come hard with his name on my lips.
Interrupts, insistent, “You are a brave, clever, generous man! Never underestimate your worth!”
The Holmes brothers both note John’s grimace and groan. Sherlock glares at the intruders.
3.	Fellatio
I wake quickly with a feeling that something is off. Sherlock isn’t in bed, testing I find the sheets still hold some, not a lot, of residual warmth. I rise pulling on pyjama bottoms and my dressing gown and tread down the hallway.
“Just the backache. Burning after shower today, none before. Fuck, I can’t think straight. Hold still.” John is still slurring and shaking a bit.
“Master Crawley, he purchased one of the mock Moran’s sir.” She anxiously answers, still looking at the floor.
After spending a couple hours going over files and videos, agent Burton wonders looking around “Is there somewhere we can set up as a base? The hotel in town is too far away to be effective.”
Mycroft sighing and cocking his head to the side, “Read the papers John.”
Smirking, “I didn’t want to say anything…”
“Do I have a mommy? Veronica at my preschool says I can’t have a real family without a mommy.“
“Yeah… hand me my phone, it’s in my coat behind you.” Sherlock throws John his coat. “Thanks.”
Sherlock reaches over to unclip the leash from his new slave, “That’s enough of that.” Then taking the blonds elbow to guide him off to a side alcove.
“So that burned out place with the old abandoned well, that was your childhood home?” John wraps an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders.
“Sir. Please sir.” He holds out the key for me in his palm.
“You know, there is such a thing as fraternal twins. Multiple eggs being fertilized, can be same or different genders? Similar DNA but not identical…” John enlightens.
Lifting his hand from over the phone “Good idea.” John then asks “Mycroft, when are the FBI supposed to arrive?”
Mycroft sits down, facing the door, “You may as well both try and sleep, I will be here when you wake.”
Jorge carefully takes the pieces of the tuxedo to the side and calls Sherlock back in. We’re putting on the pieces for the navy pinstripe suit as they walk back in. “I think we need to look at a few ties while we’re here as well.” He has a handful in his grip.
To Greg’s great surprise, Sherlock cleans up the mess he’d just made, taking sips of his coffee along the way. When everything is cleaned up, including the dishes from last night, Sherlock refills the kettle and clicks it on.
Sherlock and I look at one another quickly. I then open the box and look inside. There is a pile of frilly pink fabric and lace. As I pull it out I find it is a beautiful dress in Rosie’s size complete with matching slippers. Bless the woman! “Oh! Mrs Hudson you are a godsend! I forgot to pick out something for Rosie to wear tomorrow. How did you know? Did Sherlock tell you?” I demand the last as I look to him. He is the same mixture of stunned and pleased as I am.
“Her sister Joan and her wife Shirley Hopkins come most of the time. I thought they were visiting this week but didn’t get here before I left. Marge didn’t mention them when I called. I didn’t think to ask if they had arrived. I called her every night before I went to bed, she liked it when I kept in touch. I talked with her just last night.” He starts to sob.
Sherlock opens his eyes and ceases humming. The crinkly brow is back. He seems confused.
“Can be,” John says.  He looks away from Sherlock and stares out over the sea.
Mycroft tells him his ordering of things is illogical.  Mummy finds it endlessly frustrating, often reaches wit’s end and tells Sherlock just what a picky nuisance he is, and why can’t he just eat what’s put in front of him?
“Hang on, is that my--?” John sees now that the man is thumbing through the cards in what is unmistakably his wallet, and his voice trails off. His jaw feels suddenly tight. He grabs for his cane and shoves himself up to his feet, the movement putting him squarely into the intruder's personal space, and he reaches for his wallet.
The cane clicks against the floor as he hobbles to the stairs and hauls himself up them and out of the station.  The October chill outside rushes down into open collar of his jacket and up through his sleeves.  The exposed knuckles on his right hand are numbed by the wind.
The man furrows his brow, tilts his head just slightly to the side. “You're ashamed,” he states, after a moment, as if John's reaction has puzzled him. “Your clothing is worn, but spotlessly clean; it smells of the cheap detergent they sell at the laundrette. You've kept the military haircut, but it's lopsided, probably because you've been keeping it trimmed yourself with scissors. You're trying to keep your face clean-shaven; you don't want to look unkempt. The blade on your safety razor is starting to go, though. You nicked yourself there, by your left ear, and you've missed quite a few patches of stubble. You've been using the showers at the YMCA, of course; why else would you be paying for a membership when you can barely afford regular meals?”  He drags out the ‘s’ on the last syllable and stands there looking pleased with himself, like a cat that has carried home a dead songbird for its owner.
Sherlock’s face lights up, as though he had forgotten all about the music until just now.  “Indeed, John!” he says, setting his tea down haphazardly and splashing a bit over his hand.  He bounds out of his chair and over to the stereo in the corner.
Sherlock sits up and lets his eyes adjust to the cloudy daylight.  He watches John extract a small piece of cardstock from the bottom of the basket and squint at it.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and does his best to mimic the exasperated tone Mycroft often takes with him.  “Don’t be dense, John.  They’re used to being disturbed by waves.  Waves are a known entity.  Being struck with rocks is another disruption entirely.”
Angelo seems not to hear him.  “I’ll get a candle for the table, s’more romantic,” he says, winking hugely at them and clapping a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder before walking away.  John is left feeling a bit shell-shocked.
“How do we know which way north is?”
John rolls his eyes.  “Sod my leg,” he mutters, but he goes over to the chair, swats a few times at the (absurd, out-of-place) Union Jack cushion that rests on it, and drops himself down with some relief.  “Milk, no sugar,” he says, off-handedly.
He tugs his pants up over his hips, throws on the rest of his clothes, and slams the bedroom door as hard as he can on the way out.
Without breaking eye contact, Sherlock reaches for his own coat collar and prods his fingers around in the fabric until he catches his skin on something sharp and draws a tiny needle out from the wool.  “John, do you have a pocket knife?”
Sherlock stands up to meet him.  The man sets the menus down at both of their places and grips Sherlock’s outstretched hand with both of his own, shaking it vigorously.  “Sherlock, your playing last weekend was fantastic.  Outstanding!  Would’ve made Mozart himself weep.  And you’ve brought a date!” the man says, to John’s sudden alarm.  “Anything you’d like to eat, on the house, for both of you.”
When Sherlock has finished off his own chips and most of John's as well, he nearly trips over his own feet standing up, and he starts giggling uncontrollably.  John slides a steadying hand against the small of his back, helping him towards the door.  He leaves his hand there even when Sherlock finds his footing again.
“Ah, and did my dear brother tell you what experiment went wrong to land him here?”
They’ve been home from hospital for two days now. It has been two days of agonizing, tedious boredom. Two days of wandering restlessly around a spotlessly clean flat. A flat that smells all wrong, too clean, sanitized; not sure if Mrs. Hudson and/or Mycroft is to blame. Two days of being able to do nothing constructive, nothing productive, nothing meaningful at all. Two days of dull, mind-numbing, wearisome, frustrating, monotonous, droning, dreary, tedious, mindless boredom. John believes he has never been so bored in his entire life!
She flicks her brown eyes to his pale grey before staring at the floor again then hands him the file, “The younger sir. He… he…”
There is a shadow at the open door along with a light knock. In the doorway, looking a bit shocked, surprised and concerned is Mike Stamford holding a cellphone up in his hand. “John, I didn’t know you were here mate.” Walking in to stand next to Doctor Barnes.
John rose twenty minutes ago and took a long hot shower. From the sounds in the bathroom he is almost done. I pour boiling water into our new tea pot over a few bags of PG Tips. The last of the sausage Kevin made before he left is browned and keeping warm in the oven and I’ve put eggs in the pan to scramble.
“I don’t want to Bond and be some overpowering Alpha’s brood mare!”
“John…”
Kevin spots an old glass aquarium he had stored up at the office on the counter next to the pie. “What’s in the tank?” There is dirt and various bits of bark and sawdust.
“What’s this?” Opening the bag, “Oh John…”
“In his spare time, he assists Consulting Detective Sherlock Holmes. I’m sure we’ve all read his blog about their exploits. Let’s start the bidding at £100!”
She walks to the doorway “We’ll be fine, take your time. Have fun dears.”
He scoffs at me “Chores John, really?”
Jessie grins, “In the bathroom, top drawer next to the door should have a disposable shower cap, razor and toothbrush. Anything else, soap, toothpaste?”
Sherlock himself pales and pulls out his phone texting Mycroft, as he reads the message on the piece of paper:
“You didn’t know, but I was close to eating a bullet the day we first met. I was nothing, I couldn’t be a soldier, and I couldn’t be a surgeon anymore. I was nobody, nothing. You gave me a reason to live again, and when you left… it all came back with a vengeance.” Another tear, “You can’t do that to me ever again Sherlock, I won’t survive!”
“That’s good. I wondered if you had slept at all when I got up.” I finish my food and tea.
“Have you’ve never been in a, ah, a romantic relationship before?”
The taxi drops us off, I pay as Sherlock and Rosie open the front door. Mrs. Hudson is in and comes out to greet Rosie and us. “Glad you’re home boys, do you have everything ready for the big day?” she asks as she takes Rosie for a quick cuddle from Sherlock.
It is now just shy of six in the morning, he has been behind his desk going through various reports since half four. He sits with his back to the wall of windows, this way whenever someone arrives, he has the advantage of the light as his features are cast in shadow. Though today there isn’t much light coming through the heavy swirling fog outside. The building is specially designed with custom windows, mirrored on the outside. No use being careful elsewhere if he leaves himself exposed to threats here.
“John!”
“Army Doctor, quite good in fact. He would not have ignored the symptoms. We have been staying at a friend’s place and we both blamed the bed and travel for his backache.” I reply arrogantly. I reach over and hold John’s hand, his mumbling quiets down at my touch.
A few steps behind Sherlock are Greg Lestrade, Molly Hooper and Mrs. Hudson; the women with their plus-ones.
Frowning, “No, I don’t have an escape route. Honestly, I’m a Doctor, John Watson, I work at St. Bart’s in the A&E. In my haste to leave this morning I forgot my wallet, it’s on the kitchen table. I was running late for work and was lucky I had my pass card for the tube in my jacket.” Pointing once again, hopefully, down the street toward his door. “My flat is in that building three doors down, I’ll even give you the keys to get in and retrieve my wallet yourselves.” Pulling said keys out of his front trouser pocket to dangle them from his left index finger by the ring. “My room is on the third floor, two down from the stairs on the right.”
He sits up and I follow, reaching over to give him a loving kiss. “John, I am the fortunate one to have landed such an attractive and brave man.” It’s my turn to blush as I kiss him again.
“Oh… Jawn, I wanna to tell you somefing.”
In the kitchen, John opens up the refrigerator. Mrs. Hudson must have gone shopping before they came home, they are well stocked with vegetables, including carrots and celery, and they have ground beef. “Sherlock, is there any tomato paste in the cupboard behind you?”
He doesn’t know where he is. Is he still in London? Is he even still in the UK?
“We still need to clean up love, let me wash your hair. If you sit on the bench I’ll have better access.” I help Sherlock up to sit and grab his shampoo. I gently massage the shampoo into his scalp. He’s practically purring in pleasure to my touch. I pull Sherlock up as he reaches for my shampoo, as I aim him under the spray of the showerhead to rinse he starts to massage my scalp. I grab his body wash and start to lather him up all over, paying special attention to my favourite dangly bits.
Sherlock pats her on the head before starting to help her and John collect snow for the head. “Your Daddy seems to think I do. I believe it is he who holds all the magic though.”
Kevin “Yeah, a couple guys know friends, of friends that are having issues with living civilian life. I told them I have several houses available and to spread the word. They would only need to do minimal work, whatever they could handle if they have a disability, mostly help maintaining the roads. I wouldn’t require monetary rent. Let me know if they have families or are willing to share as most places have more than one bedroom. If they can figure out a way to make some cash up here, other than drugs, all proceeds are theirs.”
When Rosie wakes we have a quick lunch together then head out shopping. Sherlock insists upon his tailor first as it will take the longest what with fittings and choosing of style and fabric. The things I agree to! Sherlock is playing with Rosie as his favourite tailor at Savile Row, Jorge, is measuring me as I’ve never been measured before. We both agree the pinstripe navy and the dove grey bring out the colour of my eyes but I’m not sure if I’ll ever have need of a tuxedo… between these and the shirts I am set for formal wear for a long time.
“Yes he is Harry, this is our home. We both live here, together…” John starts to clarify.
The driver Edward, a gift from Mycroft apparently, won’t let either of us handle any of the luggage. I’m not complaining. The lady behind the desk gave us directions a suite on the 19th floor. I was not expecting our bags to arrive with both a porter and a butler, Graham, who helped us to unpack. We had a lovely suite overlooking Central Park.
Short-sleeved.  Button-front.  Size 10.  Laura Ashley.  Lace sailor collar.  Navy blue.  Perfect.
Sherlock's head shoots back up and he looks him in the eyes again. There's a wonderful, tiny sparkle of something there. John feels his own eyes must look the same.
“Afghanistan, or Iraq?”
The boy laughs.  Sherlock finds he can hear him well despite the roaring ocean.  He has a small voice, but it echoes into Sherlock’s head, amplified.  His ears are often strange that way.  At home, at school, his hearing plays tricks on him, the ticking of clocks like a train clattering by, the loudest voices distorted as if spoken through layers of glass, unintelligible.
It’s not funny.  John’s temper snaps.  He shouts.
Sherlock stands and looks him up and down.  He just practiced deductions with Mycroft two days ago.  “Your right eye is bruised.  It was your left last time.”
He quiets, starts poking at his food, wears a half-arsed failure of a smile, and she rolls her eyes, taking a long pull on her cup of tea.  "Fuck's sake, don't start with the sad puppy face already.  I'm trying to be fond."
If Mummy were here, she’d nudge Sherlock forward, prompt him with a whisper at his ear ‘Hello, John.  My name is Sherlock.  It’s nice to meet you.’  But Mummy isn’t here, and nor is Daddy or Mycroft or Sherrinford.  That’s the beauty of here.  This is Sherlock’s place.  He tears up the script and scatters it to the winds.
“North.”
It begins with scales; to check the tuning, John presumes. He cannot tell the names of the notes just from listening; G is the same as A is the same as D flat, as far as he is aware. But even basic scales are lovely to listen to when played with grace, and grace is something the man has in spades.
He thinks about perfect shades of blue.
John feels his breath catch, faintly, slightly. He tilts his head, regards the man in the corner of his tiny kitchen. Their eyes meet once more; Sherlock's no longer seem quite so unfocused. They breathe for a moment, watching each other from across the room. There is a wary energy in the room. Questions drift unasked between them.
John breaks his gaze away and does as he’s asked, handing the tiny circle to Sherlock.
John has a serious countenance, a crease to his forehead like Sherlock has never seen on a boy his age.  His face lightens at Sherlock’s words, though, a smile playing about his chapped lips.  “I’m the third John in my year.”
Sherlock looks him in the eye again, finally, the sparkle returned to them that had dissipated during John’s fit of temper.  John is relieved to see it, relieved to see that this something, this unsure and newly born connection between them remains intact.
Confusion is evident on Sherlock’s face.  “Buy you over for what?”
“Well, do you bring a lot of men here?”
"Look at you, paying attention to the calendar," John murmurs, leaning into the touch.
“Learn to control yourself, Sherlock.  You must.”  Mycroft’s eyes are red and wet, at the corners, past where rainwater might have settled.  “You must.”
They aren't alone either, though, and really it's the three football-kitted, beer-gutted blokes a few tables behind theirs that are keeping him from feeling purely euphoric.
“Christ, you really are drunk.”
Did he shout? He isn’t sure.  Everything has gone a bit fuzzy and he feels terribly lightheaded.  He is shaking and shaking and shaking, inside and out.
Sherlock grits his teeth and feels dizzy with thinking.
He hears John’s voice filter into the cacophony of wind and waves, a murmur.
“I wanted to ask you to have a meal with me yesterday, but as I stated then, I had a prior engagement that was unavoidable.  Since I wasn’t able to invite you to eat with me, I determined to at least leave you the funds I was going to spend anyway.  You looked quite ill.  No, don’t argue--” he says, holding a hand up flat to silence John’s interjection.  “You did.  You looked positively gaunt.  You have since you started coming to see me play three months ago and it’s only gotten worse with time.”
Sherlock unwraps the wax paper with care, takes a bite. When he's swallowed it, he smiles. “Terrible,” he says. “Absurd.”
Sherlock looks at him, seeming caught off guard by his quick response.
The words feel sour in his mind as he reads and rereads them.  He can almost feel the twenty-pound note through the leather, weighing heavily in his hand.  It’s charity, he’s sure of it, and he doesn’t know why he feels so utterly blind-sided by it.
This boy is the bullied, not the bully, belying all evidence Sherlock has collected to the latter.
John is cut adrift, leaning on his cane in the middle of the floor.  The smile that had lingered throughout his conversation with the busker slips gradually from his face.  He chews at the inside of his cheek, glances to his left and right and sees that the world has somehow kept turning.  People are cutting around him in wide swathes as they pass.  Nobody else seems to have noticed the coming and going of the remarkable man with the violin.
“John, this is Angelo,” Sherlock says as he sits back down.
There is a pause, a beat of silence, and then John feels a smile etch itself into his face and a bark of unexpected laughter escapes him.  It jars his system, wakes up the under-used creases near his mouth, pulls at muscles in his belly that have been long neglected.
“Yes, and you are really, really drunk. Sherlock.”
. Mad, John.” He growls and flails his hands again. “I am here, I am. I am drunk, and here, because I don't hate your sandwiches. I don't.” He stops moving, seems out of breath. “John.”
John takes that moment to flip the currently cooking grilled cheese, lest it burn. “They're not awful,” he says. “They're not fancy, but they're not awful. And at least there's no juniper sauce.” He offers Sherlock a smile. It's not returned. The other man still looks terribly distressed.
Harry
John gains a pound back, according to the scale at the YMCA.  He is loathe to admit it, but lately he feels just a little bit less like he might keel over at any moment.  He can’t bring himself to be truly resentful of Sherlock for it.  Every meal they share is accompanied by easy conversation, and usually also an impromptu music lesson of some sort.  John is learning more about classical music than he thought there was to know.
He’s tested all of them, and none of them are right.  Shuffling his hands through his hair, he racks his brain for any further blues that may be found in the house.  The cobalt is closer.  He needs more like the cobalt.
A woman pulling a rolling suitcase behind her clatters between them and the moment breaks. There is a clinking of coins as a few pence and pounds are tossed into the violin case.
John picks up a sandwich, examines it briefly; it appears to be chicken on a wheaty sort of bread, cut into neat triangle halves.  He downs one in a few bites.  The sudden intake of food gives him a head rush and he closes his eyes against the brief dizziness.  When he opens them again, he catches Sherlock watching him with steady eyes from the armchair opposite his.  John licks his lips and reaches for his tea, suddenly feeling self-conscious.
“It is not!” Sherlock’s hands shake as he grabs at the hem of John’s t-shirt to stop him walking.  “I’m supposed to be happy here.  It’s supposed to be quiet.  I’m supposed to be in control.”  He stares at the sea over John’s shoulder, avoiding his eyes.  “You’re a figment of my imagination.  This isn’t fair!”
"S' the truth," he says.  "I'm not... I'm not fussed either way, I like a bit of everybody, I just... I dunno."
John sounds incredulous, and Sherlock wants to be offended.  Is it really so far-fetched? He thrusts out the cup of tea, sloshing a bit on his fingers and wincing.  “I brought you tea.  I thought... well, I suppose it wasn’t a terribly long flight, and you probably could have had tea while you were flying, off the drinks trolley, if you had wanted tea, but I just thought you might want some now, as well.  As it were.” He is no longer sure where his brain is going or what words are coming out of his mouth.  The shaking has only gotten worse.
Sherlock still won’t look at him, but starts speaking in the same rapid monotone he used the previous day when he was rattling off observations about John.
He reaches to his left and gives the inside of Sherlock's thigh a solid grope under the table, right there under the sticky Formica and buzzing fluorescent lighting.
Instead the man’s lips curl into a tiny smile and his eyes dance.  He drops his voice down and tilts his head in towards John as if to tell him something in confidence.  “You’ve still got your expired RAMC identification card in your wallet.”
Too much.
It’s supposed to be quiet here.
Did they talk about this? Sherlock wants to say, ‘You hate your sister.  You don’t want to fly to Newcastle.  I hate when you leave.  I don’t want you to fly to Newcastle.’
The flat is nothing at all like he might have guessed.  John thinks if he were asked to describe it, he’d say it looked a bit like if Da Vinci, Shelley, Mendeleev, and Mozart had all taken up residence together in a far-too-small living space.  The entire room has a decidedly bohemian quality about it.  The furniture is mismatched and the wallpaper eccentric, covered in starkly contrasting black and white fleur-de-lis.  Laboratory equipment, of all things, is set up all over the kitchen table; John wonders what Sherlock could possibly need a microscope and a Bunsen burner and so very many Erlenmeyer flasks for.  There is sheet music strewn across every free surface.  Several bookcases are buckling under the weight of everything from Darwin to Dostoyevsky.  A gleaming upright piano is pushed against one wall, and Sherlock’s violin has been set carefully on the bench.  John wonders if he has just been playing it.
“Mummy,
Sherlock drops his voice even lower.  "And even if we were," he says firmly.  He slides his own hand over to rest it on John's thigh, nuzzles the side of John's head, kisses his cheek with a soft brush of his lips.
John turns his eyes to the tiled floor and forces himself to draw a tight breath.  He is not ready for this right now.  There is a tug in his chest that tells him he ought to retreat and spare himself the possibility of fucking up this conversation, driving a wedge between himself and the busker.  He doesn’t want to ruin this.  He wants to keep hearing the music every day.
“Ah, listen,” John starts finally.  Sherlock looks at him with a curious expression.  “I just wanted to… apologize.  For losing my temper, earlier.”
Sherlock starts at the sight of him.
Mummy frowns.  “Apologize, Sherlock.  Ford was just talking, and you’ve interrupted him.”
Instead, Sherlock nods slowly and they both sit in silence.
“Mrs. Hudson did us a plate of sandwiches as well, before she left for her sister’s this morning,” Sherlock says.  He plucks one off the tray for himself, then takes the plate and sets it on a table at John’s elbow.
John lifts the hand that had shaken Sherlock’s and touches his index finger to his lips, a real smile drawn across his face now.  “Shh.  It’s a secret.”
Sherlock takes it from him, still regarding John carefully. John gives him a small smile. It feels good, genuine.
Sometime later in the evening, there’s a quiet knock at his bedroom door.  Sherlock’s gaze flicks up and around the room.  It has fallen dark without his noticing.  The door inches open.  A dish is set down on the edge of his desk.
John wrenches the cork out of a bottle of ginger beer and takes a swallow from it.  “What should we do after lunch, then?”
Blue eyes.  Izu-Ogasawara Trench.  Marianas Trench.
“John, I
At first, it doesn’t seem brighter than the others.
