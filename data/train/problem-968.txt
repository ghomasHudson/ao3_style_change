Mycroft shook his head. “No, Harriet Watson’s birthday is today. They would be in Chelsea at the Benihana restaurant.”
Everything was just a bloody competition between them, just as it had been between Sherlock and Moriarty. In this room sat the two smartest people in the world, but one of them was just the smallest bit brighter. And no one knew exactly who it was, them least of all, and so they competed.
She squealed and vaulted over his chest. John went after her as best he could, groaning at the pain in his back, he wondered if the floor would have been a better choice.
“I don’t think she should go.” Sherlock said finally entering the room and walking to John’s side of the bed. He was hesitant to assert his feelings on how John should parent Willa.
Willa for her part eagerly recounted a school yard tiff that ended in two boys rolling around on the playground until the teachers broke it up.
She couldn’t call out for Daddy or Papa but she could still wiggle her toes. She managed to open her eyes just enough to see her right sandal land quietly on the rug behind them.
During dinner his phone rang. There’d been another Thallium poisoning, except this time the boy was still alive.
“Sherlock, what’s happened?” Mycroft asked as he swung his feet off the sofa. At his tone Gregory was instantly on alert, closing the lid to his computer.
Nothing special, just a plain pink t-shirt a few sizes too big, a black pair of leggings, some knickers and a thin pair of socks. Willa was surprised when she realized that everything, other than the shirt, was in her size. They seemed to know a lot about her.
John sighed in exasperation as he stooped to the floor picking up hurriedly discarded shoes. Some days he scolded Willa for leaving her shoes lying about, usually those were the days when the hastily kicked off shoes nailed the wall, but some days he simply trailed behind her picking them up. He was just happy he’d finally managed to break her from completely stripping during her ascent to her room.
“Aaron’s gotten two hours all together and I think I’m somewhere around three.” Molly confessed turning away from her conversation with Sherlock.
Willa nodded. “Uncle Mycroft says they’re drivel.” She stumbled over the final word for a moment as if trying to recall exactly what had been said to her.
Sherlock glanced down at John’s hand for a moment before shaking his head. “I think this is best, what is it? Sealed with a kiss?”
John got off the bed and walked back around to Willa. He pulled the covers back and chuckled softly when he saw her wearing one of his shirts. He raised an eyebrow at Sherlock.
“Are you alright with it?” He asked even though he felt certain he knew the answer, Willa loved Sherlock.
“My brother has no access to any of his accounts currently. Two days before he left he gave the instruction that ‘The Watsons’ receive his monthly allowance instead of it sitting in an account he couldn’t touch. I assumed since you didn’t ask that you knew.”
“Sherlock call Mycroft. Now.” John growled as he balled his fists and turned back towards the restaurant. He needed to do something, needed to keep doing something, and at least with Harry he could focus on being a doctor.
There was nothing sexual about it, or at least there wouldn’t have been had it been possible for Irene to exist in a space without making it sexual. With her present, every moment felt like one long and elaborate game of foreplay.
John laughed to himself when he reached downstairs and found the door to the hall door to the living room had been shut and the sliding doors from the kitchen had been pulled. Willa was already down the short hall to the bedroom. John was about to call out for her to knock but she’d already pushed open the door.
Greg sighed and leaned back into the chair, recognizing when an argument wasn't worth having. After all, that was
“I don’t dislike her.” It was true. Sherlock had felt several bursts of emotion towards Willa the previous night and he found her tolerable as far as children went.
Sherlock came into the kitchen and grabbed the container of honey and set it down in front of John. It was the honey he’d gotten the day they found Isabelle Durant hanging inside her own closet, except a large portion was already missing.
Willa smiled shyly at Sherlock and Sherlock waited patiently while she gathered her thoughts. He could see Angelo in the reflection of the glass, watching them.
Greg nodded. “I’ve been married nearly two years and if they want to call him Mycroft for the rest of their lives we’re fine with it.”
“Thank you.” He mumbled. “You know you didn’t have to stop taking cases for the week. Just nothing that would keep you from getting Willa from school.”
John did not cry. His eyes might have burned and he may have been rapidly blinking but he did not cry as he hugged his daughter and sent her off into her classroom.
Another rule Sherlock had expected. John had been understanding about Sherlock’s drug habits the first time around, hadn’t run from the flat when he found out he was moving in with a former addict. He sat with Sherlock all night when he needed.
“There wasn’t a car.” He shouted at John before bolting towards the street. John didn’t even think, he just chased after him.
Sherlock hadn’t admitted it to John, though he suspected he knew, but he enjoyed fixing Willa’s hair. There was something therapeutic about doing her hair for him and she enjoyed it too, nearly purring when he brushed it. Both she and John could brush it and make passable pony tails but it was only Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson who could tame it into anything resembling order.
“Well then John. I only spent a hundred and twenty-five pounds on half a telescope for Willa.” Sherlock smirked and slid into the car.
The orthopedist cleared Willa to have her cast removed exactly six weeks after she’d broken her arm. John had originally been planning to do the x-rays and removal of the cast himself but after she’d needed a new one he decided he wanted a second opinion on it. She was mesmerized by the flexibility of her own wrist after they removed the cast, less pleased when the doctor informed her she had two more weeks of restricted activity. That was what made John truly glad he’d taken her somewhere else.
John, like Mycroft, had aged. His hair was almost completely grey but it suited him and didn’t age him unnecessarily unlike the mustache from last time. Sherlock’s fingers twitched with the desire to run through it. John’s face looked very much the same, a few more lines sprinkled here and there but at this moment it was mostly smooth. He was watching the girl with so much adoration in his eyes that anyone would have noticed.
When they got to the living room John allows himself a triumphant smile. Before going to wake them, he had convinced Sherlock to feed Teddy his next bottle. Once John had showed him how, he’d taken to it just fine, despite the fact he constantly looked afraid.
"Really? That's your justification? That there's more? What about her parents?" Cole was pleading now, but his voice was getting closer to Willa and Janine.
She knew things weren’t going to be easy for them, with mummy dearest in the background pulling strings, but she had never wanted it to come to this. So when she’d been innocently
Because that was what would get her home. Sherlock. Not hysterics or prayers, Sherlock and his deductions. They were what would bring Willa home, and once again, John would owe Sherlock his life.
“You’ll be fine, Sherlock.” John called over his shoulder at him. “if you want to put him down the cradle is over there.”
She deflated at his sharp tone, her entire body going limp in his arms. She was no longer screaming but sharp rough sobs were escaping her mouth.
“Oh thank god, I don’t even know where she got that thing.” John said upon seeing what he was doing.
Within weeks his money ran dry. Mycroft had clearly gotten word he was using again and stopped the steady trickle of funds he’d been providing.
It turned out to be a booking for a five-course meal, Sherlock cursed his brother’s ability to get one in at him even while doing something nice.
John struggled to stand until Sherlock, whose body finally caught up to where his brain was, reached down and pulled him up by his other elbow.
“John, it’s Cardiff. Not Afghanistan.” Sherlock told him brusquely. If it had been anyone else saying that John might have punched them in the face but Sherlock didn’t mean it the way other’s might have.
Sherlock accepted the folder and opened it. “It’s a missing person.” He said and then rolled his eyes and shut it. “You don’t do missing persons unless of course someone from the British government hands you a file.”
“Oh god yes.” John breathed and then pulled him down again into a crushing kiss. “I want something from you, then.” John whispered when they broke apart.
Sherlock closed the gap between him and pulled John into his arms. John instantly wrapped his around Sherlock’s waist and buried his head in his chest, a mirror of how they had been earlier in the alley behind the restaurant.
Willa begged them to go out on her bike every day after she got it. Sherlock was the one who often gave in and would drag her and it to the park. John was impressed at the speed in which she was picking it up but going out nearly every day would do that.
She repeated what she’d told John, much quicker this time. Sherlock said they’d be down shortly before hanging up leaving her questioning if she’d made the right decision. Instead of heading straight down to Greg she went the back way into the morgue where she found Dr. Golden just starting to unzip the unsettlingly small shape in the body bag.
“Willa stop!” Sherlock shouted as they reached her room and John’s pulse hiked into dangerous levels. Sherlock never shouted at Willa.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “My findings will be more compelling if it’s believed I simply looked into this case out of morbid curiosity than if a man breaks the law to tell me about it.”
Willa was choosing the path and she darted towards a small bridge to cross the body of water. Once it was clear which way they were going the jogger picked up pace and darted ahead of them. Sherlock carefully controlled the urge to run forward as he passed Willa.
The funeral was held the following Tuesday and the entire school had been invited. All of the children were excused automatically if they were absent for the day. Noah’s mother had requested that those who attended didn’t wear black, instead she encouraged bright colors. Willa sat between John and Sherlock in a pew during the mass, she was wearing a bright orange dress John had chosen when she refused to do so.
They spent a majority of Saturday in the room, leaving for only a few hours to explore the grounds on John’s suggestion. A great deal of the time was spent in the suite, in bed, not just for sex, but also for lazing around and kissing each other languidly. A luxery they normally did not have between their jobs and the active six-year-old.
John left them alone when Sherlock said he was heating dinner, realizing he should find his own food.
They’d known she wasn’t coping with her classmate’s death well, she was too ‘alright’ for a child who had lost a friend. He should have seen it coming when her eyes glazed over and she was nearly mute during the funeral. Willa was a great many things but mute was not one of them.
She flopped back on the bed. “They didn’t say I couldn’t tell you, they just didn’t want me to know what they were for.”
Sherlock slid her into his lap and then climbed carefully out. She snuffled softly, burying her face in his coat before relaxing again. John hovered around them uncertainly before settling his hand on Sherlock’s lower back and unnecessarily guiding him into the building. Sherlock would never complain about it though.
There was one question he’d yet to ask that was weighing on his mind. It was becoming even more pressing with every day. Especially after seeing Willa’s room.
Mycroft laughed, not just a chuckle but a full laugh. “John that is half of his monthly allowance. I thought you’d be uncomfortable with the full amount. Half to you, a quarter in a savings account for Willa for university and the other quarter goes into an… offshore account.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes at her and pierced her with a glare that made her feel like an insect. “She was Mary’s maid of honor at the wedding.”
John finally pocketed his phone. He might not be Sherlock Holmes but the file folders in Greg’s hand meant this wasn’t a social call. “Hello, Greg.”
Mycroft inhaled on the other end before speaking, the bird in John’s throat died and joined the stone in his stomach. “You might wish to meet us at the hospital your sister is in,” he said eventually.
Sherlock stuffed his free hand into his pocket, unwilling to pull his other arm out of John’s grip he left it hanging.
John shrugged. “Thought a bit of a change would be nice and I know Nana wants to teach you how to bake cookies.”
Willa eventually broke the stillness of the moment by turning her head to John with a question in her eyes.
“Noah Wolfe’s parents don’t love each other anymore and he doesn’t get to see his mum because of it.” Willa elaborated, playing with her food on her plate. “Does that mean if you and Sherlock don’t love each other anymore that I won’t get to see Sherlock?”
Sherlock couldn’t help the distressed noise that ripped from his throat. He kneeled at John’s side of the bed to look at him better. “I don’t
He understood why people weren’t supposed to investigate cases that they were connected to. Being objective was the furthest thing from Greg’s mind right now.
see Willa but she smiled kindly at her. She was very pretty with long brown hair. “Hello, love, it’s alright come here.”
“John.” Sherlock called as they got up the stairs. “I believe it’s best if Mr. Fisher does not come in here.”
When the files did finally come up Sherlock noticed that the first dozen or so in the folder were nothing more than stills taken from a surveillance camera. He immediately turned to glare at his brother.
“Will it work?” Cole had asked as he watched from the other room, Janine was still working the dye through the ruins of Willa’s hair.
John sighed and loosened his grip on Sherlock’s arms, hands gently rubbing the spots where his fingers had been. He finally looked up and caught Sherlock’s eyes with his own. “If we do this, you and I, we won’t do secrets. Right?”
Willa had a large number of toys with everything from dolls to a robotics kit. There were even more books than toys and they filled shelves that circled the room. Sherlock was pleased to see an even mixture of fiction and nonfiction among them. A biography of Marie Curie sat on a shelf next to a book called ‘Pirate Princess’. On her nightstand was ‘The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe’ with a bit of paper sticking out acting as a bookmark.
They found a store and bought four cups just to ensure there were backups. The arts and crafts store was less crazy, most people who frequented the place had already finished their gifts.
Mycroft shook his head. “Not yet but we believe she has a target. She will undoubtedly be acting soon.”
Jessica took the paper and seemed to ignore his irritable tone with her. “For how long, sir?” She asked.
She’d spent the night away at Mycroft’s before, the opportunity to stay at friend’s houses hadn’t come up yet, but this was different. He wasn’t at Baker Street obsessively cleaning the flat until he fell asleep and could wake to go get her. He was in a posh hotel with a gorgeous man who’d made it clear he planned to use the entire weekend for nothing particularly productive.
At five, after checking on Sherlock who was still sound asleep not even flinching when John brushed his fingers over his pulse in a peek of irrationality, John went back down and interrupted the baking party that was underway. Willa only complained a little but was easily mollified by the promise of helping with dinner.
“Er. Watch your step, there’s probably most of a box of food dye on the ground.” John said and silently cursed how nervous he sounded.
John smashed it to pieces with a hammer and then proceeded to lock himself and Willa in Baker Street for weeks.
“Here give me a moment there’s a card.” Mrs. Hudson said flipping over a tag attached to the bow. “Says ‘Happy birthday, Princess. Love Agra.’”
“Why not?” Both Sherlock and John asked at the same time. Sherlock felt a warmth in his chest knowing John wasn’t eager to kick him out.
It took Willa a few tries to stand, her legs felt rubbery and every time she stood the room spun just a little. Once she could stand Janine led her across the room into a bathroom.
Sherlock enjoyed her squeal of joy when John brought out the telescope and books. What he did not enjoy, though, was the twenty minutes of ribbing it caused everyone to give him. He glared at John the entire time to let him know he was not thrilled.
Sherlock took to becoming the primary parent well. They only had takeaway one day during the week, the other days Sherlock and Willa made dinner together.
While everyone oohed and aahed over Willa and the kitten John looked up at Sherlock. “He was your gift.” He said quietly.
“It doesn’t mean we won’t be doing Easter lunch with your brother.” He reminded him after a few minutes of comfortable silence.
Sherlock felt as if he’d been punched. He hadn’t allowed himself to think of Baker Street or Mrs. Hudson in so long. How had they changed? Had she let out the flat again? Who was living there now? Did she still own the building? Was she even still in London? Or had she finally given into her sister’s pleas to move with her out of the city. Was she alright? How was her hip? How was her heart? Had she gotten ill? Was she even-
Sherlock was confused when he saw it. It was a board book with two polar bears dancing on the front cover, not something that normally sat on Willa’s shelves anymore.
It was nearly nine now and it had been twenty minutes since someone had last been in to check on her. Harry didn’t like the quiet, it made her whole body itch with discomfort which did nothing to help ease the knot of guilt that had wound its way around her gut. After what seemed like an eternity there were footsteps outside of her door. Harry sat on the edge of the bed waiting for the person to come in. She wanted to scream when Sherlock entered first but then John was right behind him.
“You do not get to do that and then tell me you’re not interested in my cock.” John told him firmly.
“Don’t apologize for my brother, it’s disturbing.” Sherlock sneered. It was almost as disturbing as the fact that John was so easily able to read him. That he knew exactly what had caused Sherlock’s flight from the office.
“You know I would have been happy with a kiss and a ‘happy Valentine’s day’?” John asked as he found Sherlock sitting on the bed with the room service menu in hand.
Eating with Mycroft and Lestrade wasn’t the worst thing Sherlock had ever done, he had been tortured after all. They managed to remain mostly civil throughout the entire dinner. Lestrade’s presence alone took the bite out of Mycroft’s retorts and one sharp look from him when Sherlock had made a comment about Mycroft’s diet had caused Sherlock to unexpectedly shut up.
Willa ignored him. “So if you hadn’t been born, I wouldn’t have been born and daddy would be very sad. That makes both of our birthdays special.”
Sherlock wanted to climb into the front seat and press his face to the window, to take in the familiar sites and catalogue the changes. He refrained. Mycroft was watching him after all. As the city began to rise up around them he became nervous, all these years of wanting home and suddenly here he was. He needed to do something.
When dinner arrived Baron was enticed to jump from her lap to investigate the smells. Willa followed until John made her sit at the table. She spent the entire meal trying to watch the kitten explore.
“You said you’d let me do this. You’re distracting enough as it is I don’t need you doing… that.” Sherlock told him.
They were arguing, she could tell by their tones, but it didn't seem like they'd noticed that Willa was awake. She now kept still on purpose so they wouldn't stop talking, maybe she could figure out what they were going to do.
*Look I'm warning ya'll now there is a tiny paragraph that involves feet in kinda sexual situation but like it's not bad. I haaate feet and foot fetishes are just gross to me but I wrote this. If this bugs you you'll be able to figure out when it's coming and skip the paragraph*
John groaned. “No, probably not.” He then rolled out of the bed. “Don’t think you’re getting out of this.” He warned Sherlock and began peeling off his clothes from the previous night until he was down to his vest and pants.
John barely glanced into the room before shoving Sherlock aside and darting in. Harry was lying, crumpled on the floor, a small stream of blood running down the side of her face. She was unconscious.
“Oh John.” Sherlock said and it took a moment to realize he’d said it out loud. John nodded and stood, going into the kitchen to refill his drink.
Mycroft looked at them like they were both idiots but he spoke to John, most likely because he assumed John was the easier one to sway. “John, do you know where he’s going at night?”
John let out a shaky breath before dropping his head forward. They were standing close enough that it came to rest on Sherlock’s chest.
Sherlock gave John a ‘really?’ look. “Willa has endeavored to tell me about everyone in her life, down to the third year teacher who gives her sweets after school, and she has never once mentioned Mary. There are no pictures of her around the flat, there aren’t even the photos of us from your wedding.”
Once he saw Willa standing in front of the tree looking absolutely mesmerized by the supposed magic of it he understood John had been serious.
John shrugged as best he could burrowed under the bedding. “We can’t coddle her, she doesn’t even know anything’s wrong.”
After dinner and dessert the girls disappeared again while the adults made their way into the sitting room. Mrs. Hudson found the piano bench instantly and showed off the Christmas tunes she remembered from her youth. Mycroft worked hard not to cringe when she hit an off note. John pretended not to see Greg’s hand caressing his thigh as a reward for his restraint.
Sherlock wasn’t that surprised, he knew Mycroft had been sitting on the news of his and John’s relationship probably since the day it started. He would have had no problem waiting even longer before rubbing it in Sherlock’s face that he knew.
“We’ve got one. The press snooped for a while after you disappeared but yeah, it might be good for him to remind them.” John agreed and then shut his laptop.
John was lying on the bed fully dressed, curled up on his side. Sherlock pulled off his shoes and threw the duvet over him before climbing in on his side. He was asleep within minutes.
“Who exactly, Mycroft.” Sherlock said already irritated because his brother still wouldn’t just text like a normal person.
John rolled his eyes at the text. “She’ll be here in a few minutes.” He announced to Sherlock and Willa.
John was confused until he saw Sherlock was holding her broken arm far from her body. The cast looked like hell all of a sudden. He cursed when he realized that had been the cause of the thumping sound earlier.
John stared. For the moment the need to breathe was forgotten and he just looked. If it wasn’t for the fact that Mycroft wouldn’t move out of the way, John would have believed he’d finally snapped.
More recently it had been the sounds of Willa that brightened the flat, her laugh most of all. She’d been barely a year old the very first time she’d laughed properly for Mycroft. Back then she’d been an endless supply of giggles for her father and even Mrs. Hudson, both of them willing to make fools of themselves just to earn them. Mycroft, at the time, hadn’t been willing to lower himself to that level. So instead, her first giggle for him had come from a simple sneeze.
They stood like that for a while and the few people out on the snowy Sunday morning shot them odd looks. John ignored them. He breathed in Sherlock, pleased that he smelled nearly the same still.
The second they reappeared downstairs, though, he couldn’t contain his questions any longer. “John why didn’t you tell me?” He asked John’s disappearing back.
John nodded and leaned over to wipe the chocolate ice cream off her chin. “Yes. But would you like to really surprise him?”
Sherlock glared at him full of defiance. “You have no allergies, I have no allergies, Willa’s last tests show no pet allergies and I’ve asked Mrs. Hudson already.”
He hadn’t been about to sit on his hands and wait for MI6 to call him into action again. Moriarty’s networks had been regaining strength while he’d been in London planning a wedding. They weren’t as connected nor anywhere near as clever but it gave him something to do. Sometimes he stumbled upon a gang or outfit that had zero ties to Moriarty but he brought them down anyway.
John posted his write up of the Thallium murders, which he insisted on calling the ‘Soda Slayings’, just days after the original article about their romantic weekend was published. The combination of those two things had the hits on the blog skyrocketing during the last week of February. In March the traffic of private clients picked up.
“And you think this has to do with Willa?” John asked, finally letting go of the footboard for the first time since they’d entered the room. Greg hadn’t realized how tightly the other man had been holding it until he watched the blood return to John’s knuckles.
It had been difficult to keep track of Sherlock when he was exiled, difficult but not impossible. She knew too many high-ranking men and women to make anything truly impossible to her.
He was a little surprised when Lestrade’s phone call was to his own son rather than to immediately put out the word. Only after he thoroughly put the boy off from soda did he call to put out a warning about the tainted soft drinks.
“Do not scorn her, Sherlock, that would be the quickest way to lose any relationship you have or hope to have with John.” Mycroft continued.
Sherlock gave into Willa’s less than gentle nudging and got up. As soon as he’d grabbed his dressing gown Willa jumped off the bed and blew past John. John turned to see her skid to a stop in front of the sliding doors and begin bouncing impatiently.
Harry watched as John argued on his mobile. She knew he was arguing, John’s eyebrows always went down and together when he was pissed at someone and since they hadn’t actually gotten to their own argument, for once the look wasn’t being directed at her. She also noticed how Sherlock watched John from the corner of his eye. Was there trouble in paradise already? And yet here they were trying to tell her that letting this psychopath adopt her niece was a good idea.
Willa was already at the table with a glass of milk and a plain piece of bread. John shrugged at her snack choice and cleaned up their mess from the morning.
Sherlock could see John’s face tightening. John had grown up in a home that wasn’t even middle class, he’d never told Sherlock that but enough of his habits spoke of it. Now Willa was attending a school that Mycroft had to buy their way into.
She tilted her head up to look at him. “Daddy said you wanted to be a pirate once but you became a detective instead. I think being a pirate sounds more fun.”
hit him. I don’t think he knew another person could cause you pain like that because he seemed more shocked at the concept of someone hurting him intentionally than he was at the fact I had. I was twelve though and knew I was smarter than most adults, it didn’t sit well with me that I had a seemingly clueless younger brother. Mummy was furious when she learned. Told me I had to spend an entire weekend doing everything with Sherlock and patiently answering every question that left his mouth. If I didn’t I would lose certain privileges I’d grown fond of.”
“I don’t know but I will ask you one thing, John.” Sherlock said and rounded on him. “How does a six-year-old get nicotine poisoning?”
John glanced over at Sherlock and properly looked at him for the first time since entering the room. He realized he honestly couldn’t read him right now. It was disconcerting.
John held up a book. “I found this for you at the shop earlier.” He told Willa, ignoring Sherlock’s glares.
He thought John trusted him and it wasn’t even like Sherlock was actively taking cases or had the means for consuming experiments. Besides, Willa would probably have been overjoyed to work on more of their list.
“There will be less people out now and someone needs to make sure you don’t spend your money on hideous trinkets.”
“I’m going to be six in four days.” She sang into the room as their wake-up call and only warning she was entering.
He sent to John as she came back out. He settled her into John’s side of the bed and became concerned enough to get the children’s pain reliever when she turned down watching movies on the laptop.
Aunt Harry hadn’t answered but her eyes darted to Willa and Willa took a step back. Aunt Harry looked worried and Willa was now worried as well. Why was Aunt Harry scared of this man?
“Yeah, she doesn’t think it’s fair. I tried telling her that fair isn’t parading a new boyfriend around the kids every other week.” Greg said in a low tone, not wanting to be over heard by the children. “Did you know she actually tried to make Addy call one of them dad?”
“Because sometimes that’s how life works. Besides I’ve got you, why would I need another child?” John asked hoping a little ego boost would draw her off the subject.
John ignored the comment. He didn’t even have enough energy to have the conversation about the difference between need and want again.
Sherlock’s chair was in the exact same spot it always had been and that left him feeling a bit dizzy when he looked at it. There were so many implications about the unchanged nature of it. Even John’s chair had been replaced with something newer.
“Let me go first.” John began and handed him a glass of whiskey. “I’ll tell you what I need, expect and hope for and if you can live with those you tell me yours. Alright?”
At three hours old the Watsons finally settled on a name. Mary had relented and allowed John to choose her first name. John wasn’t entirely sure she meant it, that it wasn’t another gesture to get herself back on his good side but he allowed it. Mary had been utterly surprised when John had suggested the name.
Breakfast had been lovely, not a bit of shell in the eggs John had gotten, and Willa had only managed to burn the toast slightly
The noise John had made seemed to rip Sherlock out from wherever he’d been and his face crumbled. “John.” He called and also ran by Greg.
Janine just sighed like she was done with her. “Alright, whatever. Ruin it, it’s not like we won’t throw it out in a little.”
John felt no sympathy, Sherlock hadn’t helped him through the worst part after all. “Partner.” He corrected. “Sherlock says boyfriend sounds childish.”
“I’m sorry.” Sherlock was upset as well because he had promised John he would end this and he didn’t want to be made a liar out of.
Willa ended the day covered head to toe in pink frosting and with half a toy store spread out on the living room floor. Greg’s daughter, Addison, was laying on the floor next to her trying to entertain Willa with one of the new gifts but all she wanted to do was chew on the wrapping.
John had given into the desire to think about Sherlock. He and Willa had spent the day in London visiting all of his favorite cases. They’d ended the trip having evening tea with Mrs. Hudson at Baker Street.
“You could have helped.” The woman huffed at Luke as she finally reached them. She didn’t stop but immediately went to John and pulled him into a hug. “Good to see you, John.”
“Not from me dear, found this on the chair downstairs. Someone must have set it down and forgot it.”
“Well then have my brother stick his nose in. He does so love to do that.” Sherlock said as he leaned forward and picked up one of the pictures off the desk.
“Oh… uh yes,” John said realizing Sherlock was behind him. “This is Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock this is Mr. West, Willa’s teacher.”
After she was in her bed Sherlock was free to disappear down to the office again. John would appear downstairs to help him after she fell asleep, monitor pulled up on his phone. He seemed to have set himself a bedtime of midnight, though, and wouldn’t help after then.
Also somehow in the editing process (which was literally I printed out 17 pages and re typed them) this chapter gained over 500 extra words.
“Willa’s not a pawn.” Sherlock protested and he pinched the bridge of his nose, feeling the pressure of a headache building behind his eyes.
“African lions.” She said, her eyes were glued to the television set. “Did you know that lions encourage their cubs to learn fighting by pretending to be hurt when they bite them?”
When they got back home Willa marched up the stairs with the same glassy eyed look she’d worn the whole day. John watched her retreating figure disappear up the stairs and worried.
It took John a bit to realize Sherlock was referring to 221C as his ‘work area’ instead of his new flat. This made him happier than he should have been with the man who just purchased a cat for Willa’s birthday without John’s permission.
” Irene spat in disgust as she stood up. “You’re taking me too literally Sherlock. Woman, female, girl they’re all interchangeable.”
Suddenly he hit Aunt Harry over the head with a gun he’d pulled from his trousers. Willa had seen Daddy’s gun a few times and he always told her she was never ever to touch it. Aunt Harry fell to the floor.
“Alright enough!” Lestrade shouted and stepped between the two of them. He put his back to Sherlock and placed a hand on John’s chest. “You two fighting about her isn’t going to give us anything. And you,” Lestrade said and pointed a finger at Irene, “stop winding them up, this is serious!”
“Because my birthday isn’t important.” He hadn’t celebrated a birthday since the last one spent in his parent’s house.
“We’ll be fine.” Willa cried out and squirmed away from John’s kiss, perhaps it was the fourth since they arrived at the station.
John learned his lesson and resisted the inborn desire to bury his head into the mattress as he moan. Sherlock rewarded him by continuing.
“Hello, I am in the room.” Sherlock said loudly. It was irksome to have them speaking about him as if he wasn’t in there. He’d spent the last several years of his life with others making decisions for him, he was damned to spend the future the same way.

She hadn’t been necessarily happy when the bastard had committed suicide, after all he’d made John watch him do it. John had been a mess but at least he’d been free from his manipulative partner, and no matter how many times John denied they were together there was no other word for it. It had been Harry’s sofa John had first slept on when he found he couldn’t live in a flat with a ghost. John had gone on to meet that lovely nurse at his clinic and Harry had truly thought his life was finally back on track, that he’d be able to forget Sherlock Holmes.
Yet here was John, standing in their kitchen, refusing to kiss him. Sherlock would have fled the second his advances had been rejected except John was holding him in place, refusing to let him back away.
John did and enjoyed the burn of the bourbon sliding down his throat. After he finished, and Willa hadn’t returned downstairs, John went into the bedroom to change. Sherlock followed him.
John came home the evening after Sherlock had solved that small mystery with a stack of papers in his hand.
John chuckled. He reached out and brushed one of Sherlock’s curls off his forehead. Unable to resist, now, he leaned over the baby and pressed a kiss there. “Of course I would have.”
By noon Sherlock had texted asking for more milk. John worried about the state of his kitchen once he realized there had been a full jug in the refrigerator when he’d left.
“Exactly, so are we going to bake your cupcakes to find out how that happens or do you want boring store bought cupcakes?” He asked her finally.
He’d only gotten his shirt unbuttoned when there was a thumping sound above their heads. He paused and looked up, confused as it continued. He glanced over at Sherlock about to ask him what the hell that was when Willa let out an almighty shriek.
“Because I’m cute in stripes and polka dots.” Willa said in her matter-of-fact tone. “Sherlock likes those jeans, he looks at your bum a lot when you wear them.”
“What would you like?” He asked her sliding off the sofa to stand, already positioning the violin under his chin. The weight of the violin was so familiar and lovely he wanted to weep. Instead he focused on Willa.
“Yes, gifting me my own property, that is very you.” Even Sherlock knew there was no bite in his words.
Sherlock refused to answer John’s text for another hour, by which point John was checking into the hotel. It was surprisingly nice considering it had been set up through work. It had wifi which was arguably the only thing John cared about during this trip.
Once the tree was more or less upright Willa dove for the large box they kept their special ornaments in. Each year they went to the store, picked out new special ones and then every year since she was in nursery John would save one or two of the handmade ornaments. Every year less and less generic ornaments made it on to the tree and every year it made John happy to see that.
“But…” John said slowly and he paused to think about how he wanted to say this. “Sherlock and I don’t actually have to get married first for him to adopt you.” He finished.
John muffled a laugh behind his hand at Sherlock’s look. John was beginning to suspect Willa knew which works drove him mad and sometimes chose them on purpose. Sherlock tried to hard not to show his feelings about them but they were always abundantly clear.
“Mycroft and Lestrade have offered to take Willa next weekend.” He called to John who was starting their dinner.
Sherlock stole a bunch of grapes out of the bag and threw them in the sink under the tap. As he rinsed them he heard John come into the kitchen behind him. Then there was a hand on his lower back.
Sherlock was overwhelmed being back inside their flat and his mind was racing trying to take in everything at once. So when John urged his daughter to introduce herself Sherlock was thankful for the distraction. She gave him one point to focus on and that focus calmed his racing mind.
“Alright, alright.” John said and raised his hands in surrender. “You can keep giving her honey if it makes you feel better.”
He did order the Chinese and set a delivery time for six. He always felt bad enough when ordering for a party of people that he called in advanced.
John hadn’t even had time to think of a retort before Sherlock was up and whirling around so he was nose to nose with her. “Irene,” he growled low, “if you could please focus on something other than yourself right now, that would be helpful.”
Oh. Sherlock found he rather liked that idea. He could still spend much of the day as he did now except dangerous experiments and crime scene photos would be close at hand. The flat did need a great deal of work but it would keep Willa safe upstairs and allow John to help regularly with cases.
In all her years of questioning her fortitude against the terrible things she saw daily, never once did she question her competency. So when she had been suddenly told that she was being pulled off intake duty it pissed her off. It was about ten times worse when she found out Greg, who technically had zero authority over her, had been the one to order her off.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and wondered how long his brother had been lurking waiting to make a dramatic entrance.
At one point Sherlock made a strangled noise in his throat, that was when John realized he’d seen the gesture too and was no doubt desperately trying to delete it.
Mary had been in the hospital for an hour at this point, having labored at home for nearly five. He’d been utterly useless and the only thing that calmed his nerves was watching Willa’s heart beat on the monitor.
“Get the lube you bastard.” John told him, his fingertips twitching against Sherlock’s scalp. “I want to watch you prep yourself.”
In the morning Willa played on the floor with her Legos until Sherlock could no longer stand the site of the nest that had become her hair. She then sat on the floor between his feet watching cartoons while he went at it with a brush. For lunch they went down to Speedy’s and let her have anything she wanted. In the afternoon he taught her how to start a fire with a battery and a gum wrapper, then proceeded to make her swear not to tell John. Willa was the one to suggest making dinner which was why John walked in the door to the two of them making pizza dough with half the kitchen covered in flour.
Once John was comfortable he swallowed as much of Sherlock into his mouth as he could without gagging, hand working the uncovered section.
John watched him for a moment before nodding. “Yes. I once had dreams of four kids, a dog and a farm.”
John showered as quickly as he could manage. When he came out, towel wrapped around his hips, he found Sherlock lounging on the bed stripped down to black silk pants. They weren’t new and John had seen them dozens of times but the sight still made his mouth water.
“I know.” Sherlock agreed because despite all of John’s reassurances that he didn’t have to go it was obvious the other man wanted him to.
He’d been surprised when Mycroft had looked older. The feeling didn’t make sense since fundamentally Sherlock understood that was how life worked. There were new lines around his eyes, laugh lines like somehow he’d been smiling more in the last five years. The indent on his left ring finger spoke volumes as to why.
“Willa Louise!” John scolded, his need to parent outweighing his desire to stare at Sherlock longer. “Manners.”
Sherlock snorted because that was exactly something John would do. He was about to say as such when another photo caught his eye.
Willa sat on the floor in front of them pulling her knees to her chest waiting, she had a present of her own by her side.
“No, well yes. She keeps that flat because her father would die if he knew she was living here, but we bought this together a couple months ago. It kept him happy thinking she was still living on her own…”
John’s reaction, the widening of his already blown pupils and the quickening of his pulse, was enough to make Sherlock shudder with anticipation.
The shrill ring of the hospital phone jerked Harry from her thoughts, her heart sinking. Only John knew where she was, she couldn't imagine a 3am call being good. She hoped for the best and prepared for the worst as she reached out to answer the phone.
Sherlock nodded, “yes, so is the sweater.” He sounded far away, too busy staring at the locks of hair he was holding even though he'd probably gotten everything he needed from it.
Gregory was on the sofa with his head tipped back to rest against the wall, looking utterly exhausted and seriously troubled. Despite his eyes being closed Mycroft could tell he was awake, monitoring both John and Sherlock by the noises they were or weren’t making. Mycroft’s long-rumored dead heart squeezed at this because long ago he’d vowed he would do everything within his considerable power to keep this man as happy as he could.
Sherlock decided to make it easier on him. “Besides I will have need of you when I begin taking cases again.”
When John’s phone finally vibrated on the third night, Sherlock gingerly reached over and snapped it up.
Willa’s eyes snapped open, Sherlock had been sure not to let her sleep yet, given the blow to the head but she’d been resting anyway.
“Are you alright?” John asked when he crawled back into the bed. He argued the duvet over them even in their awkward position.
John never had to wonder if the theatrical nature was hereditary, all he had to do was look at how both Mycroft and Sherlock lived their lives. He saw Molly grin at him from the corner of his eye, obviously thinking the same thing.
“I’m not that big a fan of cake.” He told her and received the most scandalous look he’d ever seen on her face. “I will eat one of your cupcakes however.” He reassured her.
John had to look away, not because he was feeling remorse, but rather because if he watched her facade any longer he might just let go of the footboard and strangle her.
Dinner had been pleasant. It was interesting to watch Willa interact with another child. Addison might have been older but the girls were intellectually on the same page. Willa acted more childish around her, perhaps not feeling the pressure to keep up with adults. They made rude noises, dissolved into giggles and Willa had even pouted over the idea of never getting a mobile.
As soon as she was done Janine pulled the trash from her hand and handed her a pair of trainers. They were a little too big but Willa didn't say anything about it. As she put them on, she looked at Cole again. He hadn't seemed to have moved since when she first woke up, he was still only looking at the wall and nowhere else.
Silence did not belong here, it was an omen of terrible things. Things such as Sherlock’s faked death or his exile.
Mycroft held out the only thing he had to offer, a small black memory stick. “This is everything from this evening,” he admitted.
The day had been so pleasant and terribly domestic feeling. John wondered over dinner if this was Sherlock’s way of reacting to the knowledge of what had happened with Mary. Or if he just felt more comfortable showing Willa affection after their conversation about babysitting. Whatever the reason it left a warm and pleasant feeling in John’s chest.
As they got to Baker Street Sherlock noticed a young man begging for change on the corner nearest their home. He wasn’t certain how John would react to Willa interacting with his homeless network but he had no doubt that they’d found a lead for him.
Mycroft didn’t argue, Gregory speaking to them would have a much better chance of working than if he were to do it. Sherlock, despite allegedly having been an adult for a very long time, was always reluctant to follow any suggestions Mycroft might ever give him. Except in the cases where things seemed dire, and while this certainly counted as a ‘dire’ situation, he doubted Sherlock could be reasoned with by himself.
“Willa,” John gasped, realizing what he was saying and suddenly understanding (once again) why Sherlock thought they were all stupid.
A few children cried at the news, mostly those from Willa’s class who had known Noah. A few more children were confused, those were the ones John knew had never dealt with death so close before. Willa’s face was blank and unreadable during the whole thing and John wasn’t sure if she didn’t understand or if she was just processing things.
“John, you already worry about the lack of attachment she has. If you tip her off to any of this are you willing to take the chance she won’t harm the child?” Mycroft reasoned.
Sherlock had lifted Willa’s broken arm to check the damage done to the cast. John could tell that it would need replaced and she would need more x-rays to see if any damage had been done.
"Do you want me to call her and tell her you're refusing?" Janine spat out, she was nearly yelling now.
“Alright,” John said, and his voice was rough with emotion. “Alright.” It came out firmer the second time.
Cole Barnes had been born and raised in Hoback, Wyoming. A tiny scrap of nothing in an even more vast state of nothingness.
It wasn’t that he would argue Sherlock’s reappearance this time or begrudge him his absence, no he would certainly welcome his friend back with open arms. But there would have to be changes. The biggest of which was Willa. She was John’s life now, everything he did revolved around her. Her existence would completely alter his and Sherlock’s relationship in a way even Mary hadn’t succeeded in doing.
John stared at the text for an inordinately long amount of time before realizing what he was looking at.
John came out of the bathroom and did a double take at Willa. He turned his gaze to Sherlock with one eyebrow raised in question. Sherlock just rolled his eyes at the other man.
Willa got to explore the grounds of the college as long as she stayed within site. Sherlock couldn’t resist leaning over and kissing John in front of the building. Willa made a gagging noise at them, her new favorite reaction when they were affectionate in front of her. John just pulled down the hood of her coat over her eyes and then kissed him back.
Willa rolled her eyes, not looking away from her structure. “People who are,” her eyes flicked up to Sherlock and narrowed, “
Lukas stood looking bewildered and upset. “Mr. Holmes, please I swear to you my brother didn’t do this.” He pleaded.
Despite the fact that he had impressed upon Willa how vital it was for her to keep it a secret John was finding it difficult to contain his own joy. Sherlock definitely knew something was up from the moment he got home after the way John and Willa exchanged glances and she giggled.
A moan spilled from Sherlock’s lips and John was instantly determined to hear it a hundred times more that night.
John was still clutching her to him when he entered the office. Mycroft was seated behind his laptop.
Downstairs Sherlock found his violin sitting in his chair. He desperately wanted to play it but he was loath to wake Willa. It was an odd feeling since he’d never cared before.
Gently John eased them onto their sides and slipped out. Sherlock locked his leg around his hip to keep him in place otherwise.
“He’s been gone over five years and you two pick up again like it wasn’t more than a week. When you two are apart you’re both broken and sad. You mourn like a widow when he leaves and need I remind you he fell into drugs again after your wedding.”
Five minutes turned into ten and by that point Willa had gotten Sherlock’s phone off of him. She had downloaded almost as many games to his mobile as she had to John’s. John was relieved when Harry rounded the corner.
John walked in followed by a familiar looking man. “Er, Sherlock this is Lukas Wolfe.” He introduced.
Sherlock had absolutely no intention of letting it go right up until he heard the sound of sandals descending down the wooden stairs.
It was thirteen minutes later that Dr. Golden emerged from the morgue and headed straight for Molly.
It didn’t escape him that John was perfecting the art of picking at Sherlock’s weak points. John was expertly manipulating him using a mixture of himself and Willa. It turned out to be a particularly effective method.
He was highly amused, though he tried to hide it, that when he told Willa to brush her hair she took the spray and brush over to Sherlock. Sherlock brushed out her hair and while John was in the bathroom he looked up how to braid hair and managed a passable French braid. John could barely do neat pigtails and it wouldn’t due to have Mrs. Hudson being the only person in the building who could tame Willa’s hair.
If Greg had to pinpoint his exact purpose in this room right now, he would have to say it was as Harry Watson’s reluctant protector. It wasn’t that he actually wanted to protect her, but he worried that if he wasn’t here, there was a very real possibility that Mycroft wouldn’t do anything to prevent John and Sherlock from killing her.
“What the hell?” It was Greg finally having caught up with them just in time to see John punching out a window.
“I want to hear you.” Sherlock answered softly, the breath from his words brushing against John’s arse.
John was proud that he startled only a little when he descended the stairs after tucking Willa in to find Sherlock curled in his chair again. He had a crystal glass of whisky in hand, a matching one was on the table next to John’s chair.
“It’s… well it’s not nice, but I guess there’s no other word for it, nice to meet you Mr. Holmes.” Lukas said as they shook hands.
Right at that moment John hated Mary just as badly as he had hated Moriarty. It was her fault Sherlock was gone. If she had been honest with John just once maybe none of this would have happened. Sherlock killed Magnussen to protect them and it was Mary’s fault they needed that protection in the first place.
Sherlock had to reign in his smirk when this got the little girl to move. John had been worried about bringing Willa with them now saw the use of having a child with. John and Lisa Long watched as Marie approached Willa. When Willa looked to John he nodded.
Willa glared at the timer before grabbing her notebook. John had just turned back to start making tea when Sherlock snorted in amusement. Glancing over his shoulder her saw Willa holding up her notebook.
Willa nodded, accidentally knocking her chin off the edge of the bath, before squeezing her eyes shut.
John reached out a hand and traced Sherlock’s cheeks. Sherlock relaxed into the warm pressure on his face, the intimate gestures were becoming more familiar between them.
Letting herself into Baker Street she noticed that the door wasn’t locked, for someone who seemed paranoid of the outside world and the threat that it posed to his daughter, John Watson was being extremely careless.
John did chuckle then and shook his head. Sherlock leaned back down and traced his tongue around the shape of John’s arse from his lower back to the top of his thigh and then back again. He mirrored it on the other side. When Sherlock’s hands came up to part the muscles of his arse John buried his head into the mattress, having a feeling as to where this was going.
They weren’t in the car long before it pulled up to a nondescript building. John followed Anthea inside. She strode past the doors into the lobby but John was stopped by security and frisked. Once he was allowed to pass he followed her into a lift.
Also a round of applause for my hubs who gave me the idea for the title and the summary after pointing out they're always comparing things to chess in Sherlock and after all, the queen is often called the most important player.  He might think I'm crazy but he tolerates my ramblings and often gives good advice!
Doctor Trayford nodded, relieved to have something to discuss. “Yes, complete fracture of the right radius. It’ll need to be set before we can cast it. We can do a closed reduction.”
They spent the rest of the evening in near silence. John seemed comfortable enough with it and had reverted to what must have been his evening routine only deviating to force another cup of tea on Sherlock. Sherlock however spent the evening calculating every last change that had taken place in the flat and with John. There were so many that at times it seemed too overwhelming but then John would do something so typical of the way he had been all those years ago and it would sooth over the panic that welled up in Sherlock’s chest.
They got through pleasantries easily enough. Sherlock was unusually reserved and Mycroft had thankfully sensed the reservation in his brother and restrained his usual nitpicking. David ignored everyone from beneath expensive headphones, immersed in his mobile. Willa had raced off with Addison the second they’d seen each other, echoes of giggles and squeals alerted the adults to where they were.
John had paused in the middle of the street, he’d never actually asked where the money he was receiving was from. “That’s Sherlock’s money?”
Sherlock knew there were four people, including John, who had authorization to take Willa from school. Even those three people had to meet with the head teacher and show some form of ID. John had told him he’d made it so even if he called or wrote a note to permit someone else, the school was still not allowed to release her. John was terrified that Mary would find a way to take her from the school.
Sherlock looked over to John who began chewing on his lip. “We don’t know.” John answered after a moment.
The British government called on him frequently, yanking his leash to make him heel like a good dog. He went because he had no choice. Every mission seemed to carry more certainty that he would die and yet he survived.
As the time drew near to get Willa from school John went back into the bedroom. Sherlock had moved onto another book.
Despite the hour the windows in the flat above him were brightly lit, a stark contrast to the neighborhood surrounding him where nearly everyone was asleep. He could even see movement from above though he couldn’t exactly make out who’d just been shuffling past the window.
Sherlock was full of fury. He’d risked his life to save her, to give her the gift of a life with one of the best men in the world and she’d thrown it away in less than six months. Not only that but she’d chosen something over Willa. It didn’t matter what it was because it was obvious John had given up so much in the last six years for her, including his pride.
Sherlock watched his disappearing back for a moment before shrugging off his coat. John still hadn’t returned by then so he went into the kitchen and filled the kettle for lack of anything better to do. He could see John through the doorway of the bedroom, standing still next to the bed looking down at something Sherlock couldn’t see.
Sherlock normally would have made a biting comment about sentiment blinding the senses but he realized that wasn’t what John needed to hear right now.
It didn’t escape Sherlock’s notice that John was limping again, his right knee buckling ever so often when he tried to walk normally. He’d seen it give out several times in the past day but this was the first time John had actually begun limping again. Sherlock didn’t know how to stop it this time.
John was indeed at the surgery today. Their Monday morning had been rushed. The dishes hadn’t even been cleared off the table and there was a hair brush with several hair ties scattered on the floor. Sherlock stepped over it and towards one of the two rooms he hadn’t seen the previous evening.
Mycroft spoke first once it was clear John was too uncomfortable to start the conversation. Finances then. John had always been uncomfortable talking about money to others.
Hahaha in my outline I had originally planned on putting the Christmas dinner in this chapter. I'm an absolute failure at conciseness.
Running away from it all wasn’t her style which led Sherlock to agree with the Yard’s postulation that there had been foul play involved in her disappearance. He’d have to talk to the boyfriend, the most likely suspect.
I am warning you: There will be drama and angst upcoming, I'm certainly not going to make it this easy for them.
“Oh.” John said remembering what he’d done. “I hope you don’t mind but I made chicken and rice casserole. It’ll be done in about thirty. Sherlock and Willa prepped a lasagna for the freezer. Just heat it and it’ll be good to eat.”
He kissed along Sherlock’s neck while he was reading through a file and then whispered the most wonderfully filthy things into his hear. Sherlock was irritated with himself when his traitor body reacted to John’s words.
She loved sitting on the table reading out the recipes to him. Her math skills were nearly on par with her reading and John encourage her tell him how many quarter cups in a cup and a half or how many teaspoons in two tablespoons. She nearly always got it right. But her number one favorite thing to do was to don the oven mitts and slide the dish into the oven. He imagined it made her feel grown.
Then he grabbed Sherlock’s birthday cookie out of the refrigerator and carefully piped ‘Happy Birthday Sherlock’ onto it with chocolate frosting. He placed it back where it had been only fifteen minutes before Sherlock and Willa made it home.
Sherlock came out a few minutes later dressed immaculately as ever in a fitted black suit. That didn’t help John since Sherlock wore them constantly.
It was hard to tell if the pained noise John made was due to the hangover or if she’d kneed him somewhere, either way he was awake and this was his daughter.
“You haven’t eaten anything. Besides would you have preferred I turned to John?” Sherlock let out a low growl and Mycroft ignored him. “He was attempting to simultaneously mourn you, celebrate his daughter’s birth and save his marriage. One more bit of pressure and the man would have cracked.”
Instead he cleared his throat and began reading. “On the night you were born, the moon smiled with such wonder that the stars peeked in to see you and the night wind whispered, ‘life will never be the same.’ Because there had never been anyone like you ever in the world…”
Sherlock turned and clapped. “Oh that’s brilliant!” He ignored John’s look of confusion, instead he leaned down and kissed him soundly in the middle of the street.
They hadn’t done this yet and Sherlock was forced to move slowly, the angle much deeper than he was used to. Once he was seated fully, both of John’s hands on his hips now, he let out a low moan.
John was on full alert the entire walk back to the flat and Sherlock refused to let Willa down even when she asked. They both breathed a sigh of relief when they reached the inside of the building and Sherlock finally put Willa down.
Sherlock found himself eating nearly everything that was served because if he ate John would smile at him.
Outside of Hadeon he’d never been able to find a solid lead towards finding Mary and because of that their daughter was missing. All he had now was a demolished room and some melted petrol jugs, even he had to admit that there were limits to his own brilliance. So once again, he wasn’t able to find a single clue, nothing, that would even tell them they were on the right path.
Aaron seemed to be a decent man and everyone else appeared to like him. He had a stable boring job, loved children to the point of volunteering with youth programs on the weekend and looked at Molly like she hung the moon. Sherlock had decided he was acceptable earlier when he made Willa laugh by performing some amateur magic trick.
Rosie, who had been less than thrilled at being woken, dozed against Sherlock’s chest during the ride.
He was preparing to say ‘you’re welcome’ or direct John’s attention back up to the sky when John did something surprising, even if it wasn’t exactly unexpected. John wrapped one gloved hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck and hauled him down. He barely managed to keep from flailing at the sudden pull.
She’d come around in the ambulance just before they left the restaurant. John had been standing just outside talking to one of the paramedics but he hadn’t noticed that she was awake. None of the doctors or nurses seemed to know where Willa was or what was going on.
“And you would have trusted me to hold her?” Sherlock asked, sounding genuinely shocked at the idea.
“My cases. No more cases until you get back.” Sherlock said and leaned down to kiss him. John squirmed away from his cold nose.
That normally would not have raised any concern for Sherlock, after all he was dressed in runners’ leggings. It was the fact that he had a backpack on that raised suspicion. Not something one normally wore for a run.
“Mycroft has booked me a room in the Saint Pancras.” Sherlock interrupted, effectively cutting off whatever rambling statement John was going to make.
“Maybe you two can bake those cookies now that you can use both hands again.” Sherlock suggested, giving her even more incentive to go downstairs.
“This, the waiting and the figuring it all out. This is you, Sherlock,” John gestured towards him with one hand, head still resting on the other. “Drawing conclusions from less than five minutes of CCTV footage, this is you. My daughter’s been kidnapped and I’m bloody useless.”
After Sherlock had learned how to braid her hair they’d discussed different types she thought he should learn. Her favorite was a braided crown. He hadn’t attempted it yet but knew roughly how it worked.
He couldn’t force the words out because he’d promised not to lie to John and he couldn’t be sure that they would find her soon. Janine’s involvement solidified the fact that Mary had a hand in this, the woman appeared to be the Anthea of the criminal world, always the right hand of the most powerful person in the room.
“I know I’ve asked you to watch Willa this week but would you be too upset if I said I wanted to ask Sherlock?”
It wasn’t just the tone of Lestrade’s words but from the way he just suddenly seemed to drain of color that kept Sherlock where he stood. His mind went in every direction at once until he realized Lestrade had tried to save them the pain of possibly identifying their daughter but had been unable to.
“Where was Sherlock?” Willa asked suddenly and John inhaled sharply. They’d always been very vague about where Sherlock had been for the last six years. Right now Willa didn’t need to know he’d been in exile for killing a man in order to protect her and John.
Willa was unusually quiet for the rest of the evening but otherwise she seemed alright. John didn’t buy it for one minute and judging by the looks Sherlock was casting at her back, neither did he.
Sherlock wondered what exactly Willa had picked up from Mycroft’s visit. “Dinner first” He said as the cab pulled up.
Not that Sherlock hadn’t noticed, of course he’d noticed he was Sherlock bloody Holmes it would have been worrying if he hadn’t.
Once he’d finished he couldn’t resist scooping her up into his arms and burying his face in her hair. He opened his eyes when he felt the bed shift, Sherlock was planning on leaving them to have their moment. John stopped him by reaching out and resting a hand on his knee. Sherlock froze.
A candle appeared on their table along with the food. John sighed heavily, Willa giggled and Sherlock enjoyed every second of it.
“No.” John huffed and ripped off his coat. “I apparently was ‘negligent’ on the upkeep of my medical knowledge last year and now must do twice the amount of trainings this year.” There were air quotes and everything.
“Brave.” Sherlock insisted and buries his head further down into John’s shoulder. He didn’t want to imagine a world where John Watson had pulled the trigger that morning.
. There had been such a level of determination under that warning that John truly wondered what he’d be like when things were settled enough they moved in that direction.
If Willa hadn’t been laying quietly in his arms John would have punched something. Instead he reigned in his fury and simply crumpled the photo violently. “When did she start?”
“Three hours ago in Chelsea.” John informed her. He then closed his eyes and braced himself against whatever emotions he was feeling.
“They drugged her.” John’s broken voice came after a minute of silence. “She was terrified and they stuck a needle into her and drugged her.”
This got Mycroft to turn. “Of course he isn’t but there is a difference between knowing what one’s partner is capable of, it is another entirely to see it. You and Gregory are both white knights always wanting to take the moral high ground.”
Sherlock had to remember to breathe and extend his hand in a friendly manner. John had referred to them as partners before, as in crime solving partners, but never to other people. Never in a way that could be construed as ‘romantic’ partner. He was positive a slightly vacant smile had settled across his face.
Lestrade tried to snatch the photo from Sherlock but he moved to quickly, pulling it to his side of the desk. “Your brother only interferes when he has to.”
The far wall is covered entirely with corkboard, hundreds of little pin stuck along the side ready for use. Another wall sported a decent sized white board with four different colored makers resting on the ledge. The bare walls, the ones with the window and the fireplace, had been half painted deep red with the tops a soft cream color. The window curtains were thick fabric and John could tell that when pulled they would block most of the light.
“No, don’t stop.” Sherlock muttered so low John wasn’t sure he knew he’d spoken. Then he chased after John’s lips again.
Tears were stinging her eyes once again as she remembered their beach trip. Daddy's eyes had crinkled up as he laughed when she'd puff out her cheeks really big before spitting. Papa had talked about taking them all on holiday again so he could do those things with them.
PS: The book John reads is "On the Night You Were Born" by Nancy Tillman. My husband hates it but I read it on the night before my kids' birthdays. I also cry every. single. time.
Mycroft suggested a private tutor once John had refused to pull Willa from her current class. When John had protested about funds Mycroft reminded him of the magically appearing money.
They eventually made it into the bathtub that night, together. It was a treat for both of them fit at the same time. They didn’t have sex but John pulled Sherlock back against him and they laid there talking until John began nodding off and the water cooled after the third warm up.
Tentatively he reached out a hand and rested it between John’s shoulders. “John, relax.” He said soothingly and rubbed his fingers in a gentle circle. Slowly the tension seeped away from the other man and he seemed to lean back, ever so slightly, into Sherlock’s touch. His breathing became more natural and then slipped deeper as he faded into sleep.
He’d just returned from settling Willa in her bed for the third time that night. It was Christmas Eve and she was so excited John wasn’t sure she’d ever get to sleep.
By the time the main course arrived they’d only brought up Willa half a dozen times. Sherlock was counting and intentionally directing the conversation away from her. It was important to reinforce that they still had things to talk about other than the girl. Though any other time he’d be glad to talk about her for hours.
Willa went to scream, she could feel it in her throat, but then the woman’s hand was over her mouth. “Jesus, Cole.” She cursed.
“Yes. She knows I’ll kick her out if she isn’t.” John said. “I know you don’t like her but she sees Willa three times a year and we’re the only family she has left. If she can stay sober for those three days I won’t keep her from knowing her niece a little.”
“I think I just about believe that.” John admitted, letting his hands drop to his sides. “But no more secrets
Mycroft did sigh this time. “I was only made aware of Miss Adler’s miraculous survive about three years ago,” he informed the other man.
John, after having rescued his computer from certain death, wrapped his arms around her. “Why is that?”
John didn’t bother moving from his seat because Sherlock was already halfway up the stairs when he thought of it. He listened as two sets of feet traveled back down again. Looking up John smiled to see Greg following Sherlock into the room.
It was odd knowing Sherlock was asleep in the next room just like old times, except it wasn’t old times. Then John would have stayed in the flat, watched a bit of the bad telly Sherlock mocked him about and maybe cleaned up some of the things Sherlock wouldn’t let him throw out when he was awake. He wouldn’t have truly cared if he made noise, Sherlocks lack of sleep was his own choosing then. Now he was contemplating how to keep his active child quiet for a few more hours to give Sherlock the rest he so desperately needed.
Willa was off for Christmas break starting the next day. The original plan was that she’d spend the days John worked downstairs with Mrs. Hudson but he’d been considering asking Sherlock and after last night he knew he had to.
Sherlock considered it for a moment. He’d been uncomfortable letting John scold her when she hadn’t really done anything wrong. “You didn’t need to be scolded.” He said simply.
‘Bedroom’ quickly became John’s new mantra and he pushed Sherlock away further, allowing himself the space to stand.
Irene had been dying to show up to the wedding just to watch how it went. She’d had to settle for the reports that trickled out and Sherlock’s dramatic hijacking of John’s blog. John and little Miss Mary’s honeymoon had been the first time Sherlock had responded to her texts since his death had been revealed a hoax.
“Oh.” John was surprised to see that he was correct. The blood coming from several cuts on his own hands.
John dropped his head into his hands. “Irene, just sit down and shut up.” He ordered and rose from his chair.
There was one last thing John had to say before he can leave the subject drop. He thinks it’s an obvious thing but it still absolutely needed to be said. “It won’t change between you and I, Willa, even though I’m with Sherlock. It won’t doesn’t mean anything will really change for you.”
“Shh, it’s alright love.” The woman whispered even as her nails continued to dig into Willa’s cheek.
John couldn’t see Willa’s face but he would bet a tenner that she rolled her eyes. “I’m well. Have you brought me a present?”
Sherlock turned at her tone. “Dying snow colors is hardly an experiment.” John was growing concerned he was about to have to intervene in this very bizarre spat.
John was the first one back into the building, this time leaving Sherlock to follow behind. Where Sherlock gained an advantage through longer legs John persevered with sheer will as he took the steps two at a time.
Sherlock didn’t move far but pulled his head back enough to speak. “So this is it? We’re… partners?” He asked hopefully.
“Did you know Irene Adler was also not dead?” Gregory asked after a beat, finally opening his eyes and lifting up his head.
“No, the only reason I didn’t is I’d already been shot once. I knew what it felt like and if I missed well… as a doctor one of my worst fears is ending up as a vegetable needing someone to care for me constantly.” He admitted and squeezed their fingers together.
Both John and Sherlock looked at him but Greg didn’t explain, instead he brushed by them to catch up with Mycroft.
Her neck had been so small under his hands, he’d only really needed one, and he’d been able to feel the violent tremors wracking her body as she’d known was he was going to do. Her spine had made the same noise knuckles did when he twisted her chin sharply. He’d never again be able to hear someone crack their fingers without remembering the way her neck had felt under
It was successful because as Sherlock was suffering John’s terrible humor he pressed a single finger inside. Sherlock gasped softly. “That was terrible.”
A silence greeted Mycroft when he pushed open the door to 221 B, regardless of what he’d seen from the outside.
Sherlock stopped suddenly and gestured into one of the rooms on the floor they were on. Inside was several dirty mattresses and a few piles of garbage. “Why was there no one here?”
The first being that Mycroft had zero issue answering Greg’s phone and seemed to enjoy John’s brief discomfort when he realized who had answered. The second was that Mary had been exceptionally intelligent, even Sherlock had noted that, so it shouldn’t have been a surprise that Willa was going that way as well. The third was perhaps the most surprising: the source of the mysteriously appearing money.
Sherlock opened the box while John determinedly did not look at him. Willa was oblivious to the whole thing and was currently finding the best spot for her next ornament.
John realized then, of course, that he had no idea how to put what’s changed into Willa-appropriate words. Sherlock offered no help, though at least he had closed his mouth and put down his fork.
“I don’t really like Christmas.” Sherlock felt that was a fair enough statement, Willa was old enough to know not everyone found the holidays as appealing as she did.
“Pull her phone records, see if this number has ever been in contact with her before,” Mycroft ordered as he shoved the paper back towards her.
Teddy remained deep asleep in that oblivious to the world way newborns had. Willa was just looking at him in awe.
Greg let out a cough that sounded suspiciously like ‘creepy.’ John had to turn his head so he didn’t laugh.
He was entirely grateful that Sherlock was willing to stay home with Willa while he was away, it was one less thing for John to fret over.
He gave up on the pretenses of working and climbed the stairs to see them. Willa’s arm was now covered in a baby blue cast.
That was the threat that got him to comply. His life was on the line now, but not just his. Angie wasn’t known for simply extinguishing you, she’d pick off everyone you loved in the most brutal and terrifying ways before she pulled the trigger on you. There were rumors that some people who had betrayed her were still alive but had gone completely nuts after what she’d done to them.
Sherlock was leaning over the chair almost as soon has John had given him permission but in that fraction of a second John went through a range of feelings. Trepidation, delight, worry and anticipation being the easiest to identify. Anticipation was the most prominent.
He must have said that last one out loud because John nodded curtly and stood from the bench they’d relocated too.
“And what have we chosen?” John asked. He was expecting Romeo and Juliet or even Hamlet, as Sherlock had that on the shelves (he suspected it was the Yorick bit) but he was not expecting what Sherlock held up in front of the laptop.
Sherlock wasn’t ready to dismiss the fire as unrelated though. The extent of the damage was so severe whoever had set it was definitely trying to cover up something. And since there was little actually in the room whatever they’d been trying to hide was something more than a drugs lab. It was still possible that Mary’s cronies had set the fire to cover up physical evidence of Willa having been there, but it was just as likely that someone else was trying to cover up something unrelated.
Now he was pouring Coco Pops into the bowl second because he knew Willa hated when her cereal got too soggy before she could eat it all.
Willa set down her cup and eyed him cautiously. Homework always came right after snack and helping with dinner was a rare occurrence since she insisted she was able to do all the work herself. So naturally she was less than trusting of his motives.
They had just finished the first cup of tea, generously dosed with amber liquid pulled from beneath the cupboards, when John’s phone finally went off.
When she came out of the bathroom Janine was waiting by the bed with a plastic cup in her hand. Willa sat down and took the cup as it was handed to her. One of the work lamps shined down into it and she could see specs of white things swirling in the water. Whatever they wanted to give her hadn’t completely dissolved yet.
When John pulled away he smiled for real this time. “Let’s get through to Willa’s birthday and then we’ll talk.”
“Because,” Mycroft said, shifting his glance towards John, “the other options are even less favorable for you.”
Sherlock looked up at her from where he was sitting in his chair with Willa in his lap, he’d been saying something to her.
“Yes, you’ll have to come over sometime and help me with him.” Molly agreed pulling her fingers to her mouth to blow on them.
“You cried nonstop for the first two hours.” John said with a fond smile remembering how her angry squalls echoed in the room.
Molly made a soft ‘oh’ when she understood. “Right, sorry. I- you know what? Don’t mind me.” She apologized and bustled over to Willa.
Harry barely managed six months of sobriety at a time and she was so spiteful towards John when she drank.
