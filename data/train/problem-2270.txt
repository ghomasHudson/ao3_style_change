There was one king sized four-poster bed against the center wall with blood red curtains draping on either side of it. Matching pillows of all sizes adorned the plush, beige comforter. The rest of the room was lavishly furnished with dark brownish-red furniture, beautifully engraved with intricate designs. The only lighting came from the dim candles and lanterns around the room.
John thought as he reached down behind him to turn the doorknob to the bedroom.
“Well then, you can just, uh, finish getting me back later then… When we get home.”
They simultaneously turned their heads on the pavement, both immensely grateful for the other’s presence. In complete seriousness, Sherlock added, “Except maybe your phone. We’ll probably need that.”
John turned and sprinted as fast as his legs would take him. Jackson and Bolt had gained a frightening lead while he had stopped for Molly. They were also younger and faster than him. They would catch up eventually, but John planned to keep them running as long as possible. If it wasn’t for the adrenaline, he would have been long burned out, but he kept pushing.
The cases they went on were spectacular as well. Or maybe it just seemed that way to John since everything was spectacular now that he was with Sherlock.
“You knocked me over!”
“Right.” John groaned, sitting up and stretching. “Lestrade, right?”
He closed his mouth and relaxed his posture. Sherlock fully entered and removed his shoes, smiling at him. John noticed he was also carrying several boxes. There was no mistaking the smell of Thai food that instantly filled the room.
“Why would I be worried?”
Sherlock loved his scar because without it, they never would have met. His wound was what first brought them together. And for that, Sherlock found it beautiful.
“Yeah, well. I was too busy chasing after you like a puppy.” He noticed the twinge of annoyance in his own voice.
He looked directly at John with stone cold eyes. “Do they?” he asked.
“Is that a . . .” John bent down to inspect it. “Is that a fucking
John got up and made his way down the stairs, the guilt still settled in his stomach. He couldn’t pretend he hadn’t noticed the way Sherlock had looked at him last night, as well as the implications of the whole situation. Intentionally or not, he was leading Sherlock on, and it needed to stop.
“Yes, well . . ." Sherlock cracked a light hearted smile. "Good thing there’s no such things as ghosts, am I right John?”
Sorry super short chapter! But next one will make up for it I promise :) If you've been following along with the soundtrack titles the chapters are named after, you probably know what's coming.
No response. He peeked into her room and was startled at what he found. Her bed sheets were stripped. Her drawers were all opened and emptied. Her backpack and all her clothes were gone, and there were no signs that anyone had lived in this room for at least a few days. Sherlock backed out of the bedroom, took his phone out, and scrolled to Irene’s name in his contacts. His thumb hovered over the call button, but he put it away. Later, he decided. He didn’t know what was going on, but he didn’t want to possibly endanger her by calling.
“Just . . . the ceremony, the rings, the white picket fence.”
“Just take something from Sean’s fridge.”
“All of our stuff is still in there,” John gasped between heaving breaths.
“So, in fact…” Sherlock started, his puzzled expression unchanged.
“It’s been alright,” Sherlock said nonchalantly.
“Sorry, mate. I have no idea. He’s never had to use methods apart from intimidation and rudeness to get what he wants. So this is new for all of us.”
“Shut up!” Victor barked from the cannons. His hand fumbled furiously, trying to figure out how to work them. You’re not my captain. You had your chance, and you gave it up. This is my moment, and you will not steal it.”
ONE YEAR LATER
Trying his hardest not to slump his shoulders, he hauled his duffel down the hall and up the grand staircase. The room he chose was rather small for the size of the house, but still charmingly furnished and decorated with thin white curtains and lavender blue accessories.
“Extra dumplings?”
But eventually, the painful, stabbing emptiness in his stomach was too much, and he knew he was severely dehydrated. If the madman wanted to drug him again, he would be more likely to do it tonight instead of directly again in the morning. He decided to take a chance that the biscuit and water were safe and downed them both in a matter of seconds. Within a minute of drinking the water, which had an odd sourness to it, his headache was nearly gone. He silently thanked and cursed the pirate at the same time.
All his pent up emotion spilled until his eyes had dried out. He cried for Mary being the cause of all this, he cried for the dance he and Sherlock didn’t finish, he cried for almost losing Sherlock yet again, and he cried for the cold, ruthless  words that had torn him apart downstairs.
“You could start clean. We could make new lives for ourselves and be together. Is that… is that something you would want?” John asked cautiously.
The year they spent dating was wonderful. She genuinely liked John Watson. Maybe even loved him. And as more and more time passed with no contact from Jim Moriarty, she grew think maybe he really was dead.
“Everyone’s a critic.”
“I mean, I know you don’t like to do much for your birthday, but it was our first time as a couple, and I really just wanted to do something special. And I know it doesn’t really matter what we do, cause spending time together is what makes it special, but… I still wanted everything to go well. Dinner, sunset… it was supposed to be great.”
They had many lazy mornings like that. John never would’ve thought Sherlock would be one to idly waste time in bed for hours without a reason, but he loved it. It gave them both a break. Time to just enjoy each other’s company without the stress of their daily lives hanging over their heads. It was just them in their own little world of Sherlock’s bedroom . . . well, their bedroom.
“What of him?”
“Oh Sherlock, if you take one more step I swear I will kill you.”
“Where’s Sherlock,” John growled, disgusted with him.
“What?”
“Stop it!” John yelled.
“Lestrade, he’s about to turn the corner of Main Street. We need back up,” Sherlock huffed into his phone.
Confession time: I actually wrote this whole fic because the cheating scene popped into my head (and the idea of rewriting S4 was something I was toying with at the time) so I combined them and here we are!!
“Not funny.”
was playing. A classic, John thought smiling to himself.
Julia brought one hand up and carded through his curls. John scowled in rage at the scene playing out in front of him.
“I miss the dancing lessons you used to give me. Quite a lot.”
Honestly this was supposed to be a one-shot, like no longer than 4k. And it turned into . . . this. Lol, so thank you for reading and being patient!
He made his way to brush past Sherlock and walk out the door, keeping his head down, unable to look him in the eye. But Sherlock’s arm darted out and closed the door, stopping him from proceeding.
And it would be heartless to wake him, he figured. So John closed his eyes and allowed his hand to rest on Sherlock’s forearm on his waist. He turned his face towards his friend’s and drifted back to sleep with a content smile lingering on his lips.
standing in Sherlock’s spot.
“But it didn’t.”
Sherlock couldn’t answer. He leaned down and pressed his forehead against John’s. He rocked back and forth, stroking his face with his thumbs.
“I love you, too.”
He nearly leapt across the living room and fished his phone out of the cushions of his chair. He pressed ‘1’ on speed dial and waited impatiently.
I'm not the best with writing smutty scenes but I hope you guys liked it anyhow. John got what he wanted, and Sherlock finally caved :)
**********
He stopped abruptly in front of Lestrade. “Well there’s been a theft, Inspector. Are you going to do something about it, or are you just going to continue staring after Molly like a love-starved tit?”
“I need you, Annie. I need you to help me with this,” he continued. “Remember Sherlock? Remember what he did to you?”
The party was in a very nice, upper scale club.
Sherlock had stopped visiting him after the drugging incident, and John had never gotten an explanation. So it took him by surprise when Sherlock turned up this evening. Before he could even begin questioning, John decided to fess up.
He could practically see the calculations flying around his head as he tried to figure out how it had moved on its own.
Until he swore something touched his foot.
“Did you mean it?” came Sherlock’s voice, low and quiet and pulling him out of his thoughts.
“Uh, yeah,” he replied, running a hand through his sleep-tousled hair.
They crashed inside, and Sherlock immediately crowded him up against the nearest wall. Not as a means of control and dominance, but as if he was afraid he'd leave if he didn’t hold him in place.
Sherlock tilted his head slyly. “Sort of.”
Sherlock hated to admit it, but he was actually having a little fun with this. The boy put a little extra mock-drama into his voice as they finished the chorus. “The one I need, the one I need. Oh yes indeed, yes indeed!”
“Oh, no you fucking don’t.” John leapt back inside to find Sherlock in a fetal position coughing and hacking on the ground, his figure barely visible through the smoke. He lifted Sherlock’s arms around his shoulder, supporting nearly all his weight.  With him safely in his arms, they dove back outside, collapsing onto the porch together.
He protested as several hands pulled him up to the stage. He mentally kicked himself as he climbed the steps. He should have gone home when he had the chance.
From then on, John made sure to tell Sherlock he loved him more often, kiss him in public even when Sherlock pretended to be embarrassed by it. They came up with their own rituals and traditions to celebrate their love. Sherlock noticed the effort John made. He felt stupid for even doubting him in the first place. But the question of their commitment and loyalty to one another was never again an issue from that day forth.
“You're the one that I want. You are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh”
“It’s not a place of residence. It’s a rendezvous,” John said.
“Hi,” John said politely while Sherlock nodded curtly.
“Yes I did. And I would do it again.” He punctuated each sentence with a kiss. “And again. And again. If it meant saving your life.”
“Did Sherlock send you for the muffins? I thought he wanted to keep it a surprise.”
John looked away. He couldn’t bear to watch his trembling lip, his glassy eyes.
“Yes. Problem?”
Day in and day out, John, Molly, and Greg remained shut in the brig. Sherlock was escorted every morning to assist Victor and returned every evening. And each evening brought on the same conversation.
“What happened? Are you alright?” he asked as he made his way to John’s bedside.
“John. I think you might be related to the Walters.”
John cut him off by launching himself at the man, pulling him in by his coat, and pressing a desperate kiss on that plush mouth of his. One hand pulled him in by the back of his head, tightening the seal even further. After momentary hesitation, Sherlock melted into it. He cupped John’s jaw and moved his mouth against his.
She’d also met a woman named Gretta Norton. They’d been married for one year. She told him all about their life in New Orleans. She said there was no need to write back. She had just come across John’s blog on the internet and wanted to reach out. She preferred to write rather than call or email. Ever since leaving London, she’d done her best to stay “off the grid.” The only thing Sherlock could find about her on the internet was her photography.
“What?”
John maneuvered through celebrating families and groups of friends until he found Sherlock. Sherlock ran up to him, cupped his face and kissed him more passionately than he ever had in public before. John wrapped his arms around his shoulders and kissed back.
John tucked a stray curl behind Sherlock’s ear.
“Say, weren’t there supposed to be three of those parties? We only went to two.”
WAIT DON'T KILL ME YET!
He panted heavily laying on his back. Sweat pooled around the neckline of his shirt.
When the door finally opened, a dripping wet Sherlock came through it. He was drenched from the knees down, his hair was damp and tousled, and there were dirt smudges on his face.
“Sherlock, come on, seriously. We should talk,” he said.
She draped her jacket over the back of the chair and flicked the light on.
Mentally kicking himself, he remembered getting stupidly drunk with him last night and crashing into his bedroom. Had they gone directly to sleep? Or did they . . . no. He was still wearing all his clothes, he realized, looking down at himself  And he felt he would remember instantly if they had.
Tony pressed the rod into his right pec. Agony burst from the spot as his skin was brutally scorched. The ruthless heat ignited his body, filling him up. His scream caught in his throat, threatening to tear his body in half, but he refused to release it. The stench of his own burning flesh filled his nostrils, and for a moment, he thought he was going to black out.
“He kills them.”
It took a moment for him to notice the light weight on top of him. Glancing down, he found a mess of soft, blonde curls nestled comfortably on his chest. A slight grin tugged at his lips. For a moment, he could pretend this was the Mary he married. The one who’s spicy humor made him laugh at the most unexpected times. The one who gave him head massages when he was sick. The sweet, spunky woman he had loved.
“Um, please,” John replied, gesturing to the spot next to him on the couch.
"...."
Now that John was chained to a well and almost drowning, he found he hated himself for waiting too long. No, he would not lose John when they were this close to happiness. He would simply not allow it.
Sherlock released him and moved down to suckle his balls. He mouthed eagerly at his most intimate parts, dipping lower to poke his tongue into his hole. After placing a full, open-mouthed kiss right on it, he pulled back and swiped his finger up his entire damp crack.
John thought. He turned Stacey back around to face him, gripped her hips, and pulled her in tightly. He graciously returned her eager smile, and then looked back to Sherlock.
“Sherlock wants to see you in his room.”
First thing: I know it's unlikely he would canter that early, but I sort of wanted to fast forward through the teaching process so I could get back to the plot :) Also, I've never taken lessons, so disclaimer for everything I get wrong from here on out! (I did my best to research through articles and Youtube videos)
“Can I offer you anything, sir?” a bartender asked.
John knew he and Sherlock would have a blast if they went. If things were different. If they hadn’t grown so distant.
“But I know you’re not interested in that kind of thing. I understand and respect that, Sherlock. Trust me, I do,” he scrambled. “And if you want to forget about what happened, we can forget it and just be friends. We can continue exactly like we were before. We don’t have to-”
Panic spiked through his gut as he saw the time stamps. One right after another. All just about an hour ago. Possibilities of all the dreadful things that could have happened flashed through his mind at top speed.
“Sherlock,” he said grabbing his face and looking into his eyes.
"Yes, Molly?"
,” Sherlock had spat, as if the word personally offended him.
He stuffed his hands in his pockets and followed Victor to the lounge. If he was lucky, he could make his escape without having to make any excuses.
“How does that sound?”
6:00 . . . 7:00 . . . 8:00 . . . Not a word.
Thanks to everyone who's stayed with this to the end and for the kind comments! My next long fic will be a sort-of HLV fix-it, so stay tuned for that
“The rope you used to to save me when I fell overboard during that storm. You threw it in the water but never reeled it back in. It was still tied to the mast and hanging over the edge into the water. I simply stayed under long enough to convince everyone, including you, that I had drowned. And then I swam over as discreetly as I could and grabbed hold of the rope. I climbed up and broke into a window leading into one of the lower levels. I acquired a gun, all while steering clear of the looters. And then I simply had to wait until Moriarty was alone so I could kill him without getting the rest of you or myself killed.”
“Sherlo-,”
“I . . . I don’t know.” He set the lamp back down on the nightstand.
He sighed and placed his cup down.
“Shut up.”
~~~~~~~~~~
John had written up Beppo’s case on his blog a few years ago. ‘The Six Thatchers’ he’d called it. Sherlock kept the knife as a memento. He’d even used it a few times to stab files into the mantelpiece, earning him scoldings from John.
“Well, yeah.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Do you want it or not?” John chuckled and reached out through the bars. Sherlock handed off the disappointingly cold bowl with a satisfied smile. As John began to eat, he found himself wanting to ask about the man who was supposedly his lover, or…. Something.
“Now, Sherlock!” he gasped. “Please.”
John couldn’t help thinking how majestic he looked. He truly wore his pirate captain attire very well. His hands were folded behind his back as he leaned forward and down towards John. The gaze of his piercing blue-gray eyes all but stabbed into him as they swept over his whole face.
He smiled and allowed himself to be twirled by Sherlock as the music spiked.
Beside John, Molly cried from delight.
“Please, I didn’t even graduate,” John said. “I don’t even have a real job at the moment.”
“Is that something you want to do?”
Sherlock stopped and turned, merely out of confusion. A young woman with panicked eyes and a mess of blond curls ran up to him.
Looking just past her ear, he furrowed his eyebrows and frowned. John followed his gaze but couldn’t see what Sherlock was irritated about.
He dressed and freshened up in the bathroom as quickly and quietly as he could, enjoying his last minutes of solitude and peace. When he was finished, he knelt by the couch and gently shook John’s shoulder. John mumbled in his sleep before opening his tired, baggy eyes. It was a few moments before Sherlock could physically see the memories of last night dim the friendly twinkle in his eyes into a dull glare of discontentment.
“It reminded me of that purple shirt of yours that I like. I just thought you might like something different. But if you want your old one, blue and cotton, I can return it. It’s fine. Not a big deal. I just thought you might like this one. But if you don’t, it’s okay.”
Mary didn’t know the box existed. He kept it tucked in the corner of his closet under all those blankets because he knew she’d never have any reason go look there.
When he didn’t respond, Evans sighed and nodded to Victor, whose entire face lit up like a Christmas tree. It was then that Sherlock noticed the baton in his hands. With a jolt of horror, he pressed back into the chair and shook his head.
Something seemed to dawn on Sherlock’s face.
John breathed heavily to steady himself. “I would rather DIE,” he growled through gritted teeth, “than
Together they swayed and enjoyed the music, the calmness and and serenity of it, the perfect pacing.
“Well speak of the devil,” Tony gloated, marching up to John with the knife. John hissed when the sharp blade was shoved up under his jaw. “Did he say I could carve my initials in his face?”
“Sod the case.”
*****
He fumbled with the flashlight, but it stayed dead to the world. This was impossible. He had just replaced the batteries before leaving.
She looked up into his dark eyes, empty and cold to outsiders, but full of quiet mischief and life to her. “Yes,” she whispered shakily and leaned into his open arms. He pulled her in and rested his chin atop her curls. His suit smelled like spicy mint and earth, just like she remembered.
“You’re supposed to be watching your floor,” he mumbled into his pillow.
When their laughter died down, Angelo returned with drinks.
John’s eyes flew open in hurt. Without responding, he fled out the living room, up the steps, and into his bedroom. He slammed the door shut and leaned against it, panting and grasping at his heaving chest.
They chuckled softly together. Sherlock’s grin faded, quickly replaced with a much different look.
After cases, they often came home and crashed in their chairs, listening to the crackling fireplace and drinking tea.
At this, John sat up and looked the pirate dead in the eyes. “Are you threatening me?”
Sherlock rubbed a hand over his forehead and groaned, trying to make sense of everything.
John cupped Sherlock’s face and pulled him in further. The kiss remained soft and tender, but still burned with a fiery passion at the same time.
"So you want to track down Moriarty to... do what?"
Tony rolled his eyes. John looked between the two of them, trying to work out the meaning of their exchange. The bank? As in The Bank of England? What did that have to do with anything?
"As a child, I was always fascinated by ships. Pirate ships, luxury ships, military cruisers, anything. I loved them. I would even pretend to be a pirate, the adventure, the danger, all of it. I found it fascinating. My older brother Mycroft was the only one who condoned this fantasy of mine. Come to think of it, he was the closest thing I had to a friend growing up. Of course, the same couldn't be said about today. We've grown apart, you see... Anyway..." Another deep breath.
Lestrade sent his crew off to chase the killer, but stayed back himself. He watched Sherlock embrace John so softly, so tenderly, almost like a lover. He scratched the back of his head uncomfortably, no doubt thinking of Mary and what she would think were she to see this.
John communicated with his eyes.
Remembering this, their smiles grew wider. It was rare for John to see Sherlock smile like this. The lines of his face cutting deep, the wrinkles reaching his eyes, which glistened with glee. While trying to memorize his smile, he vowed to do his best to make it reappear as often as possible.
“Let me,” he said softly.
He finally broke away, panting heavily, and turned his gaze only to find that Sherlock had disappeared.
“No you weren’t. You were going to say something else. I could tell.”
“Fine,” he breathed, and pulled Sherlock’s face in again for another heated kiss.
Something hard clattered to the floor after nearly ten minutes of ripping boards off the wall.
“Yes, of course. You’re always welcome here, John. You know that, right?”
“Sherlock?”
He opened the top flap and first took out a few of Sherlock’s shirts. The purple one he’d always liked (he was shocked Sherlock never noticed it was missing after his return), the sky blue one, and one of his many black shirts. He lifted one to his face. Sherlock’s scent lingered there, but only slightly. John didn’t bother keeping track of how many times he’d fallen asleep with his face buried in one of these shirts when he was living alone.
“Right. So then, with Victor…?”
“You noticed he was gone rather quickly, even though you seemed to be busy enough a moment ago.”
“You thought I wouldn’t catch on to what you were doing?” Victor kicked him in the stomach. “What kind of idiot do you take me for?” Another kick. He left him on the ground for a moment, clutching his stomach and gasping for breath.
The third incident happened months later in the kitchen of 221B.
Suddenly, the deafening crack of gunshots pierced the air. One. Two. Three of them. He and Sherlock broke eye contact as their heads snapped to find the source. Jackson and Bolt seemed to respond to the gunshots as a signal, taking out black bandanas and tying them around their heads, guns aiming at the other crew members in threat. John frantically looked back to Sherlock for direction, only to find him looking elsewhere. He followed his gaze and saw Victor, staring defiantly right back at Sherlock as he took out a matching black bandana and tied it around his head.
“And are you planning to take captives, too? Take an innocent person who knows nothing your agenda and rob them of their entire life?”
“What . . . job?” he asked, desperately scrambling to change the subject. He hated his voice for finally cracking, giving him away.
She tilted his chin up with the tip of the gun. “Always ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for you,” she said inspecting his face. Sherlock closed his eyes and winced as she stretched his head back with the gun far too much to be comfortable.
Sorry this update took so long. I thought with school being done, I'd have more time to whip these chapters out every week or so, but turns out the summer is just as crazy busy!!
Sherlock finally turned around and took in his sleepless, baggy eyes, his unchanged daytime clothes, and most importantly, the bags at his feet. Immediately, his demeanor softened. He set the violin down and rushed forward to help him with his bags.
He spoke while tying his scarf around his neck, refusing to meet John’s eye. When he was finished he whipped out the door without waiting for a response.
This time, they looked each other in the eye.
This only caused Sherlock to explode into another fit of high-pitched giggles.
"Thank God," he breathed. The tiny tingle of panic in his chest settled down as he fished through his pockets and pulled out his phone.
Sherlock rose up and plunged down again and again, grunting and moaning around him like his cock was a delicious treat. John trembled. He was definitely too close . . . he wouldn’t last.
“Not against my will. And what will become of you then? You can’t just keep aimlessly wandering the seas. You’ve achieved your mission. You’ve killed Moriarty. That’s why you became a pirate in the first place.”
John sighed impatiently. “Truth.” Sherlock looked away and snickered into his palm. “What?”
John’s breath caught in his throat. Now visible standing behind Moriarty was Sherlock, dripping wet and holding a gun.
“Good morning.”
They hung up, and Sherlock pocketed his phone with a smile.
"We go back a long way." He sat on the edge of his bed, clearly debating whether or not to share his tale. John slowly lowered himself onto the bed to sit next to him.
He turned to leave when the door slammed shut behind him. And his flashlight went out.
The second incident happened on a case.
He gasped and jumped back at what he found almost immediately. “Sherlock. I think you’ll want to see this.”
"It's just-"
John wasn’t sure whether to laugh at the imitation or punch the man for his accuracy. Regardless, Sherlock was clearly enjoying the dumbfounded look on his face. John decided he’d rather punch the self-satisfied smile off of his.
“What did they have you do.”
“It’s in my coat,” he said. Sherlock’s enthusiastic smile dropped somewhat, and he nodded his thanks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“All night and then some. It’s about ten in the morning now. This one here refused to leave your bedside for a moment. We had to pry him away from you to check on his head when you were rolled into the emergency room, but after-”
"Sherlock?" The man was standing on the other side of the room, looking out the window. He turned upon hearing John's voice and welcomed him in.
He began to lean down as if being drawn to a magnet. His eyes flickered between Sherlock’s plush lips and watering eyes. When Sherlock made no move to stop him, he stroked his thumb once over his cheekbone. His mouth now hovered about three inches from him, staying back just far enough to deny his intentions if needed.
John tossed his head back and laughed. He lifted Sherlock’s face up and smacked a quick kiss onto his sticky forehead.
Just a few shuffled steps to the right, and Sherlock helped him collapse into his chair.
He held him there, hovering nearly horizontal above the ground, their noses touching and their eyes still locked.
he thought, panic beginning to stir in his stomach.
“Oh my god,” John breathed. It was small. A child’s skeleton. No older than five. “Do you think it’s-”
"Here already?" she asked.
John raised his eyebrows at him in question, silently begging for a response. A word, a look, anything.
He looked away uncomfortably. So Sherlock
The boy rotated his shoulders back and forth in a little dance, both for Sherlock’s amusement and to appease the roaring rugby team that would no doubt give him hell later.
Sherlock . . . he thought as his eyes lolled back. He snapped them back to attention.
As if on cue, the flash of police lights he could barely make out above him at the well’s opening was blocked. Relief flooded through him as the dark figure that could only be Sherlock descended into the well attached to what looked like a thick, sturdy rope.
Regardless, he was back now. And she didn’t know how safe she was. Perhaps she should keep a bag packed just in case. Throw in her guns and a few of the wigs she kept taped under the wardrobe. She could run away. Leave Annie and Mary behind and become Rose this time.
Sherlock looked into his eyes as if he could see and understand his exact thought process. “Very well,” he said softly. “We’ll sort out this business with Moriarty today, and make a trip out to Cardiff tomorrow.”
“Well alright. What do you think, Sherlock? Nice place to rent for a vacation home?”
John nudged Sherlock to tell him to behave.
“Sherlock,” he breathed, looking down at the foamy, white bubbles where his companion had vanished. All feeling drained from his body as he fell limp and slumped down to the floor once again. This time, Molly’s soft arms enclosed around him, cradling him to her chest. Greg kneeled on his other side putting his hand on his shoulder.
“It’s not about being original, Sherlock. It’s supposed to be cheesy in its own, charming sort of way.”
“Is he alright?” He cut her off, sparing himself the long tale he sensed coming.
Sherlock sighed and crossed his arms. “Tedious.” John stifled a giggle.
The memories of the pool came flooding back. There was a conversation, he vaguely recalled. And then Mary pulled the trigger, and he took the bullet for Sherlock.
It was the purest of kisses. Just a shy brush of the lips. A chaste little nibble.
John squinted at them. Something seemed slightly off. Sherlock was acting way more drunk than he could possibly be. He had been with him the whole night and he hadn’t had anything to drink. There was no way he had gotten that tipsy in the few minutes they were separated.
“No I wasn’t.” His demeanor had closed off again. He was back to peering into his microscope and avoiding John’s gaze at all costs.
He trotted downstairs and turned into the living room only to have the breath knocked out of him at what he saw standing in the middle of the floor.
“Right, so. What am I here for?”
Sherlock Holmes died the next day, and so did Jim. At least, that’s what everyone was supposed to believe. Sherlock had died for real. She watched him jump with her own eyes, as she once again had her sniper rifle aimed at John. He was just as charming and handsome as she remembered. She couldn’t wait to meet him face to face.
Sherlock was quiet the whole cab ride home. John filled the silence by telling him all about Rick, Greg’s step-brother. One of the most interesting people he’d ever met. The guy could do it all. He trained exotic animals for a living. And in his free time, he travelled the world, both solo and with his band. He was truly fascinating to talk to. When he finished, Sherlock didn’t reply. He only kept looking out the window. John ducked his head to try to catch his gaze.
Sorry that update took so freaking long!! You guys know my excuses by now. But one more month of this hellish schedule and I'll be free.
He allowed himself a lazy weekend morning trying to convince himself he wasn’t completely bored out of his mind. In the late afternoon, he settled in front of the television with a beer in hand. He’d done enough silent pining over Sherlock, he figured. If he didn’t get some alcohol into his system, he knew where his thoughts would drift.
“Yes. I was, at least.” He cleared his throat. “I thought something had happened to you.”
Still, although he was unhappy, he didn’t let it affect their relationship.
“Greg is fine.”
The item underneath the magnifier was a file. John knew he really didn’t have time to be doing this, as Sherlock’s phone call had sounded rather urgent, but he took it out and opened it anyway.
Around him, Scotland Yard chuckled. Sherlock frowned deeper. “Grow up, John! And stop tampering with the snow. It needs to remain – No!” Another snowball directly on his mouth, muffling the end of his protest.
“Oh, shut up,” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes and standing up.
“John.”
By evening, John had settled comfortably in Molly’s cabin, which she had excitedly offered to share. Seeing as there could only be two to a cabin, it made the most sense. Before, Victor and Greg shared, Jackson and Bolt shared, and Molly had bunked alone.
Also, I have a question for ya'll. My creative writing professor was recently talking about things that ruin fiction, and he mentioned alternating perspectives as one of them. Because you get really deep into a character's pov and then you're suddenly pulled out of it. It got me thinking, and I'm curious what you guys think about the use of alternating pov in this fic? Just curious! You don't have to answer if you don't want to.
Sherlock looked down at him as he slowly slid himself into the widened hole. John tried to maintain the eye contact. He loved the intimacy of it. But he couldn’t help moaning and throwing his head back once it was all the way in. Sherlock took the opportunity to nip at his neck. He rocked his hips, setting a decent pace as his teeth grazed the already marked up skin. John whined and fisted his curls again.
John took his time eyeing up his entire body, drinking in every detail. Realizing his mouth was hanging open, he quickly snapped it shut and finally met Sherlock’s gaze. Sherlock looked smugly back at him and adjusted his tie, as if he knew exactly how he looked. Lowering his head slightly, he gazed at John through his ridiculously long eyelashes and smirked playfully.
"It was nothing, John. It was just about our tentative game plan and where to go from here, as we are sort of at a dead end. And of course, he was not particularly thrilled at the fact that I called off three more potential ambushes today.
“We need to take him back to his room and warm him up properly,” he said. Greg put one of Sherlock’s arms around his shoulders and lifted him up. Before John could get the other side, Victor rushed in and grabbed his other arm.
“I’m drunk, but I’m not a lightweight like you.”
Side note: If you want music to go with the kiss, I recommend the soundtrack to Harry and Ginny's kiss from The Half Blood Prince. Just trust me :) That's actually the music that prompted the scene to just pop in my head.

“Hm. What I was
Looking back through the hole, the smoke was almost too thick to see through, and fire was beginning to catch at the edges of the door.
He tipped Julia’s chin up with one hand and lowered his head.
“I knew you were deceiving me, Sherlock. You tried to throw me off and delay my plans as long as possible. But it didn’t work, did it? I told you, Sherlock, there are some things that I’m better at than you. And I brought myself back on track and finished tracking Moriarty down without your help.”
John felt a magnetic pull tugging him to the door by his gut. He craved the adventure and thrill of going on cases with Sherlock. Every fiber in his being screamed at him to accept the wordless invitation. But after last night, he didn’t trust himself.
*****
“What?” Sherlock demanded. At this, Greg joined in the laughter from the wheel.
“If you're filled with affection, you're too shy to convey . . .” he strutted around the boy.  “Meditate my direction." He fixed his challenging gaze directly on him. "Feel your way."
“Hmm . . . Turn over, love.”
“Yeah, definitely. So . . . who are these men?”
He sighed and slid his hands down to grip the sides of his open shirt. “Look, Sherlock. I’d rather not-”
“What?”
Then the world was dark around him.
Sherlock barged into the lab of St. Bart’s. His long, black Belstaff coat – a gift from his parents – swished behind him.
“Sorry.” He chuckled uncomfortably, rubbing the back of his head. “Couldn’t do that in front of Mary,” he quietly added with a guilty undertone.
Hope you liked the chapter! As always, please comment if you can! I love hearing your thoughts!
“John! I’m here.”
“Yeah, yeah. Alright,” he interrupted, rolling his eyes. Greg and Molly broke out into a shared laughter once more, and he scowled to keep himself from joining in. He scanned the deck and found Sherlock, standing with his hands behind his back and staring fondly back at him. He seemed to be suppressing laughter as well, revealing that he most likely overheard their conversation.
Still wearing only his pajama pants, Sherlock paced the room, laying out their plan for the day. John tried not to ogle his chest - pale, smooth and muscular, with the finest dark hairs scattered in the middle.
Victor, Jackson, and Bolt, now clearly marked as enemies, proceeded to ambush their own ship.  Sherlock yelled over the shots for John, Molly, and Greg to run. Greg pulled Molly’s arm as they ducked for cover and ran together. John’s eyes lingered on Sherlock for a moment. After he screamed at him to leave him and run again, with much more ferocity this time, he obeyed.
He eventually began to relax, although he still couldn’t bring himself to sleep.
“It would be best for you to lie down before you fall.”
Mycroft fixed him with a knowing look. A look that Sherlock gave him all the time. One that irritated the hell out of him. A look that told John he was expected to know something that hadn’t been stated, decipher some sort of conversational code.
“The door shut behind me and . . . locked itself? I dunno. I felt cold breath on the back of my neck. Like someone was there. Or something? I’m not sure.”
"Morning, Sherlock."
“You still could have left her and brought the child here with you.”
He rolled over and closed his eyes, enjoying the taste of Sherlock still lingering on his lips.
“Get started on that side,” he ordered. “These beams were taken out by someone and put back. Very poorly I might add. Obviously someone was trying to hide something here.”
John mostly kept to his work the rest of the day. But that did not stop him from noticing the stocky, brown-haired man talking to the two thugs from yesterday. Nor did he fail to notice their collective scornful glares and whispers. With this, he thought it best to steer clear from anyone else for a while.
Sherlock would forgive him. He knew he would. He had to.
“Nope. Sprained it.”
Sherlock flipped eagerly onto his back. In no time, John had swallowed half of him down, and began sucking hard. He looked up and watched as Sherlock moaned and arched back beautifully, displaying his whole body. Wrapping his tongue and around his cock, he lapped hungrily up and down. When Sherlock began squirming again, he closed his mouth around the tip and bobbed his head.
But instead of saying any of this he fixed her with a pointed glare. “I have 59 missed calls from Sherlock, Mary. As you already know. I’m going to make sure he’s okay.”
“Aye, Captain!” she exclaimed, way too peppy for this early in the morning. Turning towards John, she noticed Greg standing next to him. Her confident demeanor faltered a bit, and she gave him a shy smile before facing John. “Come on, John. I’ll show around,” she said with a cheery smile and led him off.
“There’s nothing left for me in London, Sherlock.”
“Victor thinks he can finish tracking down Moriarty, kill him, and loot.”
John thought.
“You’ll have to release me if you want any chance of fighting back,” Molly said with conviction, although there was a slight quiver in her voice.
"Do what?"
Back on the main floor, John’s disgust with Gina still made him want to chuck up his dinner onto the perfectly clean, patterned carpet.
This is end of Episode One! Stay tuned for a rewrite of TLD coming soon where I will resolve everything, don’t worry :) Just think of it as the hiatus between actual episodes that end in cliff hangers!
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed,
John turned his head back in Sherlock’s lap so he was facing the rest of the cell. Across from him, Greg continued tending to Molly. He occasionally leaned in and whispered in her ear, causing her to giggle and reply in similar whispers. She leaned into his shoulder as they continued their private conversation in hushed whispers and laughs.
That night, Sherlock came down to see John in the brig again. “What is it with you and your need to pick a fight with everyone you speak to on this ship?” Surprised at the lack of resentment in his tone, John looked up to see that he had been teasing. And with him, he had a bowl of soup.
They were safe.
“John?” said the concerned voice softly. But he couldn’t reply. He continued to rub his face in an attempt to contain the tears. Maybe if he just ignored Sherlock he would leave. That’s what he was expecting after the way he treated him today.
How was Sherlock letting this happen?! Granted, he did appear to be more annoyed than anything else, sitting still with his sharp gaze fixed straight ahead.
When John told her about the Magnussen case he and Sherlock were working on, she decided to take things into her own hands. She was astounded that she’d managed to fool Sherlock for this long, but with her information in that snake’s hands, everything could be ruined.
“Oh please, John, I’m not an idiot,” she repeated with a condescending edge in her voice after he had been silent too long. “You were drooling over than man even when he was dead.” The laugh in her voice was almost pitiful. She thought he was pathetic.
Without words, Sherlock had told him that he was there and that everything would be alright.
“We aren’t here because of me or anything I did. We know why we’re here. We’re here because of you.” He pointed at her, his entire body shaking with rage. “We’re here because I love Sherlock and you say he has to die for it!”
“I’ve thought it over. I have to admit, the three of you plus Sherlock and his thugs made a handsome crew. So instead of keeping you as my…. prizes.” He punctuated this word with a lingering, suggestive glance at John, a mischievous glint in his eyes. “I’ll off you a quite a merciful choice: You can either come on board and work for me…. or you can stay here and die. The choice is yours, lovelies.”
resonating in his ears.
I hope you guys liked this chapter! :) It was difficult, not knowing what a lot of these locations look like in person, or how bombs work. I did barely any research about the bomb stuff because I didn’t wanna get put on some FBI watchlist for my Google searches lol. So please excuse all the errors that I’m sure are there.
John clamped his jaw shut, the sharp words slicing through his heart. He blinked harder as the hot tears pooling in his ducts threatened to spill.
Placing each one on a cut, he took the opportunity to run his hands down his chest again, making sure the gauze was secure. When the third one was covered, he pointedly didn’t remove his hands.
Her voice, as calm and stone cold as ever, replied, “You know where he is John. I thought it appropriate to end this where I should have all those years ago when I had the chance.”
Sherlock grinned with smug satisfaction. “Come, John. We’re done here.” He pulled him towards the door. “We’ll leave this petty theft in the more than capable hands of the Detective Inspector, who has gone to the nice trouble of cleaning up his appearance for this investigation.”
“We’ve got four guys who are handling most of the logistics. The problem was that none of them knew me when I first approached them. They didn’t trust me. Thought I might be setting them up. And you know, I respected that. I like my men to be cautious. But I needed someone who could act as a mediator between us. That’s where you come in. They’ll trust you as an arms dealer, so you’re going to communicate to them everything I need them to do. Be my eyes and ears so to speak. My representative.”
Just moments ago, he had been recovering from an overdose that should have been fatal, after almost flying off for a suicide mission. Now he was back in 221B. Back in his home, but with no time to even take in the sweet, familiar smell because any moment now . . .
Because I'm such a nice person, I'm going to post the last chapter at the same time as this one :) You're welcome.
“He’s going to help me get what I want,” Victor said.
“Don’t be silly, John. Now, there’s a party tonight we must attend. Formal wear.”
“Three years since I got her killed.”
Of course it was.
“Look, I’m not an idiot, John. After what happened I knew you were only staying with me for the baby. And now that it’s out of the way I have no hold over you. Now you’re free to rebuild your life with Sherlock. I get it.”
John. Could she leave him? Would he go with her?
All he ever felt was dread, sorrow, and remorse. Pushing Sherlock away had lost him a key part of his central being. After he had returned home from the war, he was not himself. After losing Sherlock, he was not himself.  When he and Sherlock were together, then and only then was he whole, happy, and alive.
“What the hell is going on here?”
Also, head's up. Next chapter there will be a rating change.
"John."
But a deep moan to his left made him snap his head towards the sound. Julia had climbed onto Sherlock’s lap, cupped his face, and latched her mouth onto his.
The voice of a man could be heard around the corner. But only one. It seemed like he was in the midst of an intense phone conversation.
“John,” he breathed, pressing their foreheads together and panting over his lips. “I’m sorry.”
He fumbled through the sheets to find where his phone might have slipped into the folds and checked the time.
Once again relieved that they had been spared bringing a child into this world, he made his decision to pack up and leave once Mary had fallen asleep that night.
“Oh come on, Sherlock. You really think that if I wanted to slip around unnoticed, I wouldn’t be able to? I’ve been leaving clues for you because I wanted so badly to meet you again. To finish what we started. And you came straight to me like a mouse to a trap.”
Sherlock scowled as the rugby team lost it in the background. He pounded a finger into the boy’s chest and sang his part, equally as confident. “You better shape up! 'Cause I need a man, and my heart is set on you.”
With that, he stomped off to his cabin where he planned to stay until this was over. He sat on his bunk and buried his face in his hands. Joining the crew had been a mistake. How could he have been so
John gazed intently at the man in front of him. He was fumbling with his hat in front of him and looking between him and the floor like a child who had been told by his mother to apologize. Yet, he seemed entirely, one hundred percent sincere. John’s heart went out to him. Before, his fondness of Sherlock had been more of an intriguing infatuation. A physical attraction with a bit of objective curiosity. But now, after what Molly had told him about his past and after seeing this side to him- this trembling, insecure, almost childlike human side- he felt something deeper stir inside him. Much deeper.
(See the end of the chapter for
His eyes traced down the line of her arm, where he found his phone in her palm, her thumb lazily scrolling.
“The party tonight is at 8. You must attend because there is already a table reserved for us.”
Then John remembered that Moriarty had once bugged their flat with cameras and had broken in several times. If John breathed a word to Sherlock, she would undoubtedly know.  In fact, she’s probably been tracking their every action since Sherlock came back.
Their chests rose and fell together in sync. John didn’t push him away, nor did he want to. They were both no doubt thinking of that day in the alley some weeks back, where their foreheads were pressed up against each other in a similar manner. Neither of them had brought up what had happened since then. Nor had Lestrade, the only witness to the encounter. But it had lingered over them ever since, in every glance, every touch, every word.
With his back stiff like a soldier, he stood, ready to leave.
No matter how hard he tried to stop himself, even just to breathe, he couldn’t control it. As he placed his other hand over his mouth to quiet himself, the unrelenting, violent sobs shook him harder and harder. Eventually, no more sound came out. He was reduced to silently shaking shoulders and a rapidly trembling chest.
But then Sherlock reached out and touched him, just around the middle, and he couldn’t help but gasp. Those hands alone sent an electric buzz through his whole body in an instant. They roamed the planes of his chest, sweeping over his pectorals, his ribcage, his waist. He could feel Sherlock taking everything in, nice and slow, memorizing every bump and curve of his body through his fingertips.
“Shut up,” John breathed, and guided his head into a proper kiss, soft yet insistent.  Sherlock released his hand, allowing them both to cup the other’s jaw.
John nervously ran his palms down his thighs wiping the sweat off of them. He was terrified. He had almost lost Sherlock for the second time not even a week ago. His wife was a murderous assassin. And he was about to find out who she really was. The woman he had married. The woman who was carrying his child. The woman who had shot Sherlock and gotten away with it.
Instead of pushing him away, John lifted his hand and cupped the back of his head, pushing their foreheads back together.
Not ten minutes later though, John started to feel the cold bite of the October air through his thin t-shirt, and it was him who was bloody freezing to death instead. He rubbed up and down his arms, and tried to ignore the white puffs of breath appearing in front of his face.
John pinched the bridge of his nose as his breath continued to come in shuddering gasps. Sherlock stood at his bedside with his hands clasped in front of him, as if he didn’t know what to do with them.
“Aye.”
John reached up, careful not to disturb his wound, and carded through his curls. He ran his thumb over his cheekbones and down to brush across his bottom lip. God, he was beautiful. Just magnificent. He wanted nothing more than to flip them over and treat him how someone as brilliant and gorgeous as him deserved to be treated. But he knew he couldn’t. So instead he relaxed into the bed, relinquishing control, and fully giving himself over to Sherlock.
“What about you, then?” Sherlock asked after finishing his tales.
“It’s Captain to you, Victor. Whatever our relationship might have been in the past, you are still to address me as your leader.”
No. He wasn’t going to allow her to manipulate him anymore. He forced her toxic, twisted words out of his mind.
“Of course there is.”
“What?! What for?”
“But how does this tell us anything useful? You said there are no real spirits involved here.”
“Jesus, Sherlock!” But this only served to amuse Sherlock even more.
Shaking his head, he tuned into a clear channel.
“The prisoner.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony, come on,” Sean said quietly.
Sherlock almost couldn’t hear John’s response over his heart pounding in his ears.
“No, he doesn’t. So that’s what the first party is for. The selection. In the second, he gets them alone and kills them. Always perfectly staged. Always meant to look like a total accident. Or like someone else did it. Or sometimes it’s not even documented for weeks. The third party is for rewarding those who were worthy enough to stay another year. But of course, none of them know that.”
How dare she, John thought. How dare she make their first kiss, soft and chaste in the privacy of their living room, sound like the result of some sort of dirty, animalistic sex drive.
“Um . . .” Sherlock was silent for a moment, clearly embarrassed that he’d forgotten all about it. “Well, we can just shift the couch a little and forget it was ever there.” John returned his cheeky smile with another chuckle.
Around them, everyone was at their assigned post. The two thugs were working the sails, Greg at the wheel, and Sherlock and the brown haired man conversing at the bow.
“John,” mumbled a sleepy voice. He peeked his eyes open and looked down.
The boy’s mates roared in amusement as they shoved him forward. He laughed and put his hands up in mock-defense, but inevitably received the same treatment of being pulled unwillingly to the stage. He climbed up and took his position by the microphone next to Sherlock.
“You’ve got to, mate,” he said choking back laughter. “It’s the rules.”
John smiled and buried his face in between his cheeks, poking at the tiny, red, puckered hole. Once his tongue was wriggled in as far as he could manage, he closed his mouth around it and gave it a loud, wet smooch.
This wasn’t about his life or death. This was Sherlock’s.
“No, not at all!” John scooted closer to the center of the circular booth and made Sherlock do the same. The two girls giggled and squeezed in close on either side of them. Sherlock looked incredibly annoyed, but after John kicked him lightly under the table, he smiled tightly at Julia sitting next to him.
“I was making a joke, John. To see you laugh one last time before I… left.”
“What was it you were going to say?”
“Yeah,” he repeated. His voice came out small and croaky. He quickly cleared his voice to repeat himself, but Sherlock jumped in first.
He turned on the charm for Stacey, giving her his most devilish smile. He continued to sweet talk her, was even enjoying himself once he got into it.
“Sherlock?” he called out anyway. No response. “Shit,” he muttered, and ran down the stairs dialing him again. “Sherlock, where the hell are you.”
“Well, erm. A minor incident occurred. Nothing to worry about. But Lestrade seemed to think it was necessary to phone you. I assured him it most certainly wasn’t, but he insisted. And when you didn’t answer . . .”
again!” he growled as he scooted them away from her.
The significance of choosing Angelo’s was not lost on either of them: this was where their story began. John would never forget the energy that radiated between them that night. It was unlike anything he’d ever experienced with anyone.
“Well, Rick, Greg, and I were going to hit up a pub tonight. Want to come?”
“Wonderful eye, John,” he said. “This would have been easy to miss if you didn’t know exactly which wall to shine your light on.” John tried to deny how much his heart swelled with pride upon receiving praise from Sherlock.
She’d never forgive this. And John would never forgive her.
“You shot Sherlock.”
“I said QUIET.”
Like I said last time, the boys won't be apart too much longer, so stay tuned ;)
“That’s nice of you,” John said blandly.
And who knew? Once the ice was broken and they fell back into their usual routine, who’s to say they couldn’t take things a step further now? With Mary out of his life, their future was full of opportunity. Sherlock had definitely shown interest. All he had to do was return the advances, and see where things took them.
Due to the mishap at the supermarket, they showed up nearly an hour early for John’s dinner reservation for two.  While they were, Sherlock started chuckling to himself.
Sherlock’s insides ran cold from the moment he saw John in that well, alone, suffering, and nearly drowning.
So then what was that day in the kitchen all about? What were all the lingering stares? Why hadn’t they been able to maintain their close friendship after John got back with Mary?
“Though I still believe I owe you a proper dance. One that I’ll complete to the end this time.”
John climbed off of Sherlock and helped him up. Hand in hand, they bolted down the front steps and down the path, watching as the gap that was their last hope of escape narrowed more and more.
He knocked firmly three times. He waited a minute and knocked again. No one came. Perhaps Mrs. Hudson was out? He reached out and gave the door handle an experimental tug. It was unlocked.
After Sherlock set up his experiment with the feet at home, he spent the entire afternoon helping Molly, Sally, and Leah disassembling furniture and transporting them to Greg’s flat to reassemble. He made several trips in their rented van. At first, he wondered why they didn’t hire professional workers for this, but soon realized that it wasn’t so bad if you had enough hands helping. Greg even stopped by during his lunch break and helped for a bit. When Molly had first asked for his help, he thought he’d dread the entire day. But he ended up enjoying the time he spent with the three women.
He was taken back to that first day they spent together. When they were on their way to dinner after the case and Sherlock had looked at him like there was something . . . more.
Mary would have ways of knowing what had happened tonight. She probably already did.
“For what?” John asked. “What is this about?”
“And keep an eye out for suspicious activity on your floor.”
“Do you know why I told him to kill himself?” She shook her head again. “It’s little Johnny boy,” he whispered like it was a secret. “He’s a sum of everything Sherlock has tried to shield himself from all his life. All those pesky feelings. So I gave him a choice. Kill himself, or see his dear doctor die. Either way, they were to be permanently separated. And thus, his heart burned out.”
__________
"I called off the attack."
“Sherlock . . . my feet . . . I can’t-”
How dare he apologize. He had nothing to be sorry for. Sherlock would let John hug him like that every day if he wished. And it was him who should be apologizing. He was the reason John was with still with her.
“Oh, what is it now?”
“But I would prefer, for various reasons, that my concern go . . . unmentioned.”
Lucky to have been where I have been,
“Sherlock, these weeks I’ve known you have been some of best in my life,” he continued, growing braver by the moment. “Knowing you has just . . . I feel like I’ve found a missing part of me. Something that’s always meant to be there and I . . .” He faltered again, opening and closing his mouth as he searched for the words. “I just . . . I want to try Sherlock. This. Between us. I want to make it real.”
Victor was kneeling with his hands above his head, shaking and cowering. Moriarty strolled over and kneeled to look him right in the eye. “Please,” Victor sniveled. Moriarty smirked in return.
John leaned down to kiss him. Normally, on a day to day basis, they would part ways with a small peck to the lips. But this time, John took hold of his chin and held the kiss a little longer.
John climbed out of bed and wrestled his jeans on, doing his best to ignore the shrill giggles from the bed. Sure enough, looking through his notifications, there were indeed 59 missed calls from Sherlock.
“Hoo hoo,” piped a familiar voice as Mrs. Hudson rounded the corner to the kitchen.
“Aww. And look, he misses his boyfriend too!”
“You really think I wouldn’t have my own on hand, John?”
John looked around the room – at Tony watching him expectantly, at Sean nervously fidgeting with his sleeves, at Victor eagerly awaiting his answer. For the life of him, he could not understand how he had gone from being invited to their top-secret meeting to being under such scrutiny.
“John, no,” Sherlock blubbered, gently slapping his face to keep him awake.
“Shut up. I’m almost done.” He had almost loosened the ties around his hands enough to pull one free, but he wasn’t quite there yet.
John was panting with his hand on his knees, his face red from exertion.
Sherlock glared at him for a second, but John could see the spinning wheels in his head cracking his angry façade. “I don’t want to keep you from something that you want. If that’s the life you want. Go get it. I mean it.” His words were just a bit softer than how he’d spoken before. The sincerity in his voice tugged at John’s heart, melting away all the remaining anger.
Sherlock buried his nose into his wet hair. “I’ve got you,” he whispered onto the top of his head. “I’ve got you.”
"Sooooo...."
John chuckled warmly. “I know we are.” He leaned in and placed his hand over Sherlock’s knee.
“I fucked up, Sherlock. Really badly. I was stupid to not come to you in the first place. I just thought I was keeping you safe by doing what she wanted.” He swallowed tightly, leading into his next words with heavy emotion. “I overestimated my abilities to stay away from you, and it nearly destroyed us both. I could’ve gotten you killed and I don’t think I’ll ever live that down.”
“Why, Sherlock?”
“Yes, John, it is!”
"I said the
“Sherlock!!” he screamed with all his might. He yanked again, realizing that Sherlock was two floors above him. He might as well have been calling for Lestrade back in London.
“Are you quite all right, John?” he finally asked.
John led him into the kitchen and down the hall, stumbling over his own feet and walking head on into the walls. Once in Sherlock’s bedroom he dropped their combined deadweight onto the bed and was rewarded with a deep snore. He chuckled fondly at the sprawled out body beside him. He curled up against Sherlock’s back,cast an arm over his hips, and fell asleep.
“No,” Sherlock said, lightly slapping his cheek. “No, no, no!”
“I mean, how the hell could she have arranged a trap for us from her prison cell?”
“Sherlock,” he started, breathing heavily out of repressed rage. He spoke slowly with his voice low and barely controlled. “I have put up with so much from you. You’ve almost gotten us killed multiple times, you’ve run off without me on cases, your bloody experiments have nearly blown up the flat more than once. You’re an irrational, insufferable, stubborn pain in the arse sometimes, but you know what? I’ve stuck around. The least you could do is show some humanity for once in your damn life and answer me when I’m talking to you, dammit. Sherlock!”
