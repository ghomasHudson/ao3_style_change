“Last time I saw Fury, I was about to expose SHIELD,” I counter. I frown a moment after, pushing my ever-present safety goggles up in my head. “Although, I’m not exactly the green giant, so I can’t  really compare that one to your situation.”
“Hey, Nat,” I mutter, looking at my feet. The sounds of footsteps and a shadow falling over me are the only warnings I get before I’m pulled into a bone-crushing hug by one of the world’s deadliest assassins. I stiffen for a moment, before slowly relaxing and wrapping my arms around Natasha Romanoff’s middle, tablet clattering to the floor.
“I might need to visit Oslo, find our unknown,” Tony chips in, walking away from the dartboard and leaning into the kitchen.
I follow it.
My eyes meet Nat’s, and her green ones are the closest thing to scared I have ever seen. I hold up my arm, letting her see the bare wrist. She nods, retreating further into a small cluster of stopped cars that had been stopped by an overturned bus in the middle of the road.
It’s like a shield, I guess, but another downside to that is that I disrupt all electrical signals. These gloves let me touch shit without fucking it up.” I snap my fingers (because even in gloves, the metal makes a satisfying clicking sound), mind digging up an old memory. “And according to Phil, I’ve also got superhuman strength to rival Captain America.” Rogers raises an eyebrow at that, all of his previous confusion gone. I've gotta give it to  him: this guy adjusts well.
“How could it not?” he counters. “The twenty-first century is a digital book. Zola taught Hydra how to read it. Back records, medical histories, voting patterns, emails, phone calls, your SAT scores. Zola’s algorithm evaluates peoples’ past to predict their future.”
“Together,” Steve corrects, posture tense and defensive.
"First correction: I am Swiss," Zola says. My grip on Steve's bicep is white-knuckled, but the supersoldier doesn't complain. "Second, look around you. I have never been more alive." A pause. "In 1972, I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body. My mind, however, was worth saving on 200,000 feet of databanks. You are standing in my brain." Clint returns to the front of the platform where the computer is mounted, face grim.
"You and I remember Budapest very differently," the archer says darkly. I nod in agreement.
“Goddamit, Clint,” I mutter. A laser soars over my head, hitting the building in front of me. Whirling around, I see Doombots situated on top of the building opposite.
I swear loudly, coughing violently as I wave the clouds of dust away from my face. Once everything clears up, though, I can immediately spot the absence of a certain head of red hair and a purple shirt belonging to Nat and Banner respectively. Everyone else seems largely unharmed, although there’s now a massive gaping hole in the ground. My coffee mug is in pieces on the floor, but now isn't the time to focus on that. And when coffee isn’t my first priority, then you know everything is going to hell.
"You sure about this?" I hear Steve call.
"Widow, Captain, get clear!" I yell, whirling around with my whip. Nat and Steve both oblige, and I bring my whip down into the pavement with both hands. Lightning lights up the ground a couple inches around the impct point, and a shockwave sends more flying backwards. Groaning, I straighten up and stretch. I'm going to be feeling that one tomorrow. Natasha jogs over and pats my back sympathetically, free hand holding her gun with a finger on the trigger.
Natasha looks a little worried.
~~~~~
“And if I do?”
“We’ll get him back,” Nat says firmly, placing a hand on my shoulder. I nod shakily, hugging my arms to my chest as I follow the redhead inside. It’s a bit gloomy in true SHIELD fashion, with long hallways and numerous doors on either side. At some point, a door opens and a familiar brown-haired man joins Nat and me.
The soft scent of some sort of flower reaches my nose, and Nat envelops me in a tight hug. I cling to her like a lifeline for who knows how long, both of us drowning in our misery. Tears won’t form. I just shake with silent sobs while Natasha holds me tightly, sharing my pain as best as she can. My safety goggles dig into my collarbone, and I feel like trash. Because maybe if I hadn’t left, if I hadn’t run away, then I would’ve been able to stop this. Would’ve been able to distract Loki long enough for everyone to get away.
A thud follows the doctor’s words, and then a certain muscled blonde throws the doors to the lab open, striding straight to Tony and gripping him by the throat.
“Charlie lock!” I yell into my earpiece, heading for the railing.
~~~~~
“Oh, we’re way past that,” Bruce says, tone dismissive. “I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.”
Stark sends him a look colder than the ice that the blonde had been encased in, and he cuts himself off, crossing his arms.
Again! Until the runt can hold her own!
“Yeah, I’m not ready for that,” the super soldier says. There’s a whoosh of engines and the sound of screaming grows nearer.
~~~~~
"Okay," Steve relents, a frustrated note to his tone. Rumlow nods and turns, going back the way he'd come.
, like a viper, fast and deadly and dangerous. He’s halfway across the catwalk before I even manage to swing my whip around, and by the time it strikes it makes contact with empty air.
“Is everything a joke to you?” the Captain demands of the playboy. I start at the raised tone, looking up from my work. Apparently, I’d missed part of the conversation.
“Should we call ahead and actually tell Laura that we’re bringing five other people over for a visit?” I mutter. “It’s not too late.” Clint’s eyes meet mine in the glass of the cockpit, and he raises an eyebrow.
"I don't know," the supersoldier says, shrugging.
"That's up to you," my boss says casually. But there's nothing else that he can say, because at that moment, gunshots shatter the semi-silence, and Nick cries out. He collapses to the floor, and Clint dives for his bow and quiver, rolling behind the couch that Nick is slumped against now. I swear, abandoning the flannel and lunging behind the couch, yanking the handgun concealed under it out from its hiding place. I make to rise in order to peer over the couch, but a hand on my ankle stops me. I nearly scream, but manage to hold it in. Dammit, Supernatural isn't something I should be binging so late into the night.
“You’d be surprised,” I reply. “SHIELD therapists have been through some rough times lately. I’m sure one of them would be willing to listen to your problems in return for employment.”
“We better get going before Fury blows a gasket,” she mutters in my ear. I glance over at the director, and see that he does look pretty impatient. Geez, even a year couldn’t change the man. Nat and Maria go up to the cockpit, while Nick and I strap in, after I pick up the tablet and tuck it into my duffel.
And then an explosion cuts the shrill noise off.
Poking my head into the room, I see that Natasha has wedged herself into the hospital bed beside our resident archer. I grin.
Ultron’s hands fly up to the whip, chunky metal fingers searching for the thin wire.
Without his ceaseless chatter filling up the room, it’s easy to forget that he’s there because that’s all you’re used to hearing.
“I shit you not, my name is Dem,” I reply, stifling a smile. The god freezes in the middle of the cage, turning on heel to face me, a glint in his eye that makes me uneasy.
“Please don’t make me do this.”
"Gimme a sec," I say into the radio, rolling away from a laser. I head back towards the bridge, landing clumsily. More foot soldiers catch sight of me, immediately firing at me. I slide across the bridge and aim carefully. Four shots. Four aliens hit the ground. There's a small cluster of Chitauri downed by aliens nearby, and I jog over to their bodies. "Hey, C—Hawkeye?" I ask, carefully prying the arrow loose from the corpses. "Do you mind if there's a lot of blue blood on them? 'Cause, like, aliens and shit." The archer groans.
“What will you do?” Vision asks, genuine curiosity ringing through his otherwise expressionless facade.
“It’s what I knew him as,” I say in a small voice. There’s something about Steve’s voice, when he’d spoken. Something tight and fragile. Easily breakable.
Between Nat, Clint, Steve and me, we get rid of the aliens easily, regrouping behind the two assassins' taxi cab. My radio crackles.
Getting back to the Triskelion is awkward as fuck, because Steve and Natasha keep on throwing each other these
"Shouldn't be a problem," Clint says with a smirk.
I hiss out a curse. “Stark’s on the other side of the damn world, how are we getting there in time to stop him?”
Another dark room. The Soldier and I are locked in.
“Yeah,” I reply, blowing gently on my tea. The steam rising from the mug is hitting my chin, and when I move away the vents feel colder than usual. “From what I can remember, they kept him—the Soldier—on a different sort of… brainwash. Than me, I mean. Like, I was being brainwashed one way and he was being brainwashed in another.”
"I didn't say that," Natasha protests, ignoring the archer.
"This can't be the data point," Natasha murmurs, advancing towards a computer almost older than me at the center of the room. "This technology is ancient." The rest of us follow her, just as the computer screen flickers on. There's some sort of camera on top, and it shifts to scan the four of us as a pair of glasses appear onscreen.
There’s a weak whirr, and then the speeder stutters, purple lights on the side flickering out. The alien onboard lets out a panicked grunt, and I yank my blade free of the cycle, gripping the end of the vehicle tightly as I swing myself up, one foot coming up to kick the alien in the face. I don’t stick around to watch it topple overboard, just drop off of the motorcycle, falling for a few seconds before readjusting myself.
—in my life.
I hold my breath almost reflexively, reaching for my whip, and then the Soldier is doing a menacing model walk off of the car before he
“Hate to break it to you, but that title was all mine,” I correct with a smirk. “1940 was whack.”
Ultron looks back and forth between the two twins. “Please. Don’t do this.”
“Saved New York?” Tony pushes, moving back to where he had started.
"No, wait," Tony says.
"That stop better be for coffee," I grumble, eyes sliding closed and head lolling against the headrest.
The philanthropist rounds on Bruce, eyes flashing. “That’s it?” he demands. “You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.”
"Dr. Banner," he calls. The scientist pauses, looking back at the spupersoldier. "Now might be a good time for you to get angry." The smile Banner (Bruce, I think. We're about to face down an unholy lovechild of a centipede, a whale, a turtle and a fish) gives Steve is bitter.
"It was Operation Paperclip after World War II," the superspy says. "SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic value."
“Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss,” Steve replies simply.
“People are going to die, Buck,” Steve says. “I can’t let that happen.” The tension in the air is thick, and I feel like I’m intruding on something that isn’t meant for me. That my presence takes away the sheer impact of this moment. But Steve needs someone to watch his back, especially if he’s fighting against someone who used to be a childhood friend.
"I don't see how that's party," Nat remarks. The whale-centipede-turtle-fish thing is low to the ground now, crashing into trees and lampposts. None of them deter the beast in its goal. It just keeps on going. Banner moves forward, and so does Steve.
The assassin, whoever he was (because those shoulders are too broad to be a woman's), is already fleeing at a sprint, and I let my legs pump in overdrive, trying to catch up. Up ahead, the assassin leaps off the roof, and I grip my whip tightly, launching myself off of the ledge of the building and onto the next. As I do, I grasp the handle of my whip with both hands and bring it around. It crackles to life in midair. Just as it's about to make contact with the man, though, he snaps around and catches the whip, electricity and all. My grip on the whip slackens in surprise, and the assassin uses my shock against me.
“Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark,” one of the Maximoff twins says, stepping forwards so that he’s in front of his sister. Pietro, I recall. “It’s what, comfortable? Like old times?”
"Cam, stop," Natasha orders, gripping my wrists and pulling my hands away. My eyes dart around wildly before finally settling on my partner's green ones. "Whatever this is doing to you, it's not good," the redhead says firmly. "Stop trying and let me explain." My breaths are coming out in harsh huffs, and there's someone rubbing soothing circles onto my back. My breath evens out now that I'm not under pressure to tell anyone anything, and Natasha lets go of my wrists, turning to Steve.
“What the hell man! I - Ugh, alright, whatever.” Tony threw his hands up in the air, shaking his head at Steve dramatically in disbelief, as he rooted through his pockets. Steve watched, slightly amused and concerned and saw his expressions change from irritation to wide eyed disbelief. “Fuck, I left my wallet at the bar.”
“Fuck I’m alone.” Bruce also said slightly too loud, tipping his beer in everyone’s direction when they looked at him.
“Pretty sure that was you, maybe if you stayed off the booze you’d remember!” He’d meant it playfully although his tone suggested otherwise, thankfully his friend knew him well enough to understand that, letting go of his wrist and instead patting him on the shoulder to send him on his way.
“Hm. Okay. Firstly, this is a little unfair since I already said one, but since you’re a newbie, I’ll make it easy on you. I play the piano, too. Now you go.”
And then it was just them, alone, on two opposing couches.
When Tony grabbed his drink once again, pulling it over to him he made a shaky recovery as he sat himself on the floor, spilling some over onto Steves knee. Leaving a dark patch in his jeans,
“You’re clearly a morning person.” Tony tugged on his shoulder, pulling on the neck of his shirt like an annoying, petulant, child. “Can I show a song?”
Steve didn’t know why he did it, or why Tony was doing what he was now. He saw the paint on his skin and something inside of him overwhelming and hot decided he needed to clear it away, get rid of any pain he or anyone else might have caused him.
What it was like?
“Thanks.”
“This fire is terrible. If it weren’t for Clint whizzing that flashlight around like we’re at a very low-budget rave we wouldn’t be able to see shit.” Tony sighed as a matter of fact, pulling his jacket tighter around him with his spare hand. “At least he hasn’t started singing yet. That’s a bonus.”
“???”
Steve then realised that Bucky only knows one guy who’s openly queer and dating another guy and begrudgingly realised his mistake. Internally cursing his sudden need to talk about his feelings or something.
“I guess it is.” He said in a shaky breath.
“You say my name a lot. It’s very individuating. Anyway, carry on.”
There were moments, in the night, where he had conveniently turned over at the same time as Tony, and they were facing one another. When Tony’s eyes were shut, Steve could look at him, too dark to see detail, but enough to look at him without guilt or shame, because Tony wasn’t looking back at him with those dangerous deep eyes that questioned every move he made and he wasn’t with his boyfriend. He could look at Tony’s naked eyelid and his lashes that were still thick, black and curled without any of the makeup. His pouting lips, with no anger or even a wicked smile which either would make him tense. He calmed him, made him feel safer in his own room than he did when he wasn’t there, almost otherworldly, like when Tony was asleep and slightly peaceful, he was finally at one with his own body, something he could not fathom to access when he was awake.
He would be lying if he said he didn’t spend all his time thinking about. His mind always wandering back to the woods when he was just trying to go about his day.
. She looked at him with a mixture of worry and frustration, devising her own plan, all the while Steve felt as though he might be sick. What would Tony think of him?
“Thanks.”
“I’m serious.” Tony repeated.
Natasha fed him back a similar look, except Ty turned to Steve. Maybe he was trying to be intimidating, but he’d dealt with his fair share of obnoxious rich boys who think that their elite martial arts classes make them a fearful competitor and that they’re not hiding behind daddy’s plastic.
And even after all he’d heard, everything he’d said, he was infatuated.
“Awww. Do I still not get my discount?”
He wondered why he was still stood in the doorway, why Tony was still holding the door open with his hand, until he reached out, sliding his fingers in the collar of Steves shirt, it was blue, not too fancy, he nearly trembled when the tip of Tonys pointer finger grazed the skin of his neck in the process.
“You know…” He nodded, trying to imply something that Steve wasn’t in the mood to guess, shrugging his shoulders and shaking his head in response. “Doin’ it with a guy.”
that did not cease.
“Tony, Tony, where are you going?”
“Alright. It can be our lil’ secret.
Steve didn’t realise he had teared up until he saw Bucky’s eyes in the same state once they pulled apart.
“Well I don’t like that, and if you’re a swamp monster, then I’m a big ugly Forest troll. And I’m way uglier.”
“I hope I’ll see you around, Steve. Maybe get to see more of your moves.” Tony smiled in a way that made his cheeks swell, standing in the door frame before he would turn to leave.
“Fantastic –“ Thor grabbed the stick with so much force he caused Tony to lose his balance on his log. “I’ll bring this to him, thank you.” He trudged off in the opposite direction.
“Well as long as you’re happy.” Maybe it was the way he said it, maybe it was because the room was deafeningly quiet and they both shared the same silence under the same blanket because the pause was rupturing, awkward and terrible, although Tony was smiling after he said it – he was looking at his lips again – that’s why. “Uh- ahem- So what’s this song you desperately need to show me at…” He looked at Tony’s phone, reading upside down, from that angle he also saw his upside-down lock-screen which was a picture of him and Rhodey. “-9:42am.”
He wrestled with his own persistent imagination and belligerent morals for a good while until his boner went away for him.
“No. It’s not. But it’s okay. I like that you’re honest with me. Not many people are.”
- ‘activities’ going on inside were particularly... rigorous.
“Seriously, I don’t know who you are, have we met?” Tony squinted up at Steve like he was trying to make him out. Adorable, so cute in an annoying way it made him want to tear himself limb from limb. Steve laughed, nervously, unsure if he was allowed.
A thought that only made him drink more.
Gave Tony the go look as he crept out of the truck, and in almost no time at all, he scrambled to his feet, knocking Brian on his ass as he stood.
Tony laughed, sounding more like a breath of relief than anything. “I’m starting to think you only got into college ‘cuz you’re pretty.”
“Th- that was awe- awesome, Stevie.” Trying to catch his breath another time. Letting go of Steves hand as they stumbled onto a new road with a different story and a different set of rules they could break together.
He even called.
Sharon looked at her phone and gasped to herself. “Oh I’ve got class, I gotta go. It was nice talking to you, Steve.” She said thoughtfully, pulling her backpack strap over her shoulder and readying her coffee cup in her hand like she was ready for battle. “Nice to meet you.” She smiled at Tony before hasting off.
“Not everyone can.” The redhead said from beside him, her talking voice was sensuous in comparison to her singing voice, she had shimmery violet eyelids and red lipstick that almost matched the red bangs feathered over her eyes, and she looked up at Steve with not so curious green eyes, which made him uncomfortable, he felt as though she’d figured him out already and it was something that he didn’t even know about himself. “Hi. I’m Natasha.”
He waited until the coach came and left, until he finally decided that yes, Steve wasn’t coming.
“It’s not nice is it?” Steve boasted, earning him a purposeful splash in the face.
“I thought you should see this… Well, I’ll leave you alone.”
He quickly dodged a couple of bulky men crossing his path even though he had the right of way, like he knew instinctively to move out of the way. “I’m guessing it has something to do with the unplanned petty theft or my sociopathic boyfriend
There was this adult version of ‘Pictionary’ called ‘Dick-tionary’ that he didn’t partake in because he didn’t know them well enough to be drawing various sex positions on a tiny whiteboard - despite Tonys begging, which filled him with warmth, and nervousness, his small voice pleading
“Well I wasn’t expecting him to be joining us anyway?” Steve narrowed his eyes.
“Ha-ha. Well I just hope he realises it soon. Or he already has, and he’s just so damn stubborn he won’t give in.”
“Tony…You… You doubt yourself too much.”
look for him. You… You find him. You hear me?” Tony stopped speaking before his voice faltered anymore.
When they got back into the apartment, the laughter and the shouting was gone, the music must’ve been turned down but it filled out the room, just like the limp, passed out drunk bodies strewn across the apartment.
No remorse, no worry of that he’d just been caught, he knew Steve knew, and just bore the look of a teenager who was sitting in the principals office getting a lecture but he just found the whole thing ‘funny’.
Friends? He wouldn’t say friends. Maybe they were friends. The more accurate description would be
Natasha shouting into the microphone to introduce the band, Tony’s bright and cathartic smile as usual lighting up the make-shift stage. There was something to be said about the support from a bunch of stoned alternative kids and how the atmosphere always shifted the minute they started playing, it must have been part of the reason Steve was so drawn to Tony in the first place, the strange feeling of acceptance he radiated to everyone in the room all the while making you subconsciously fight for his attention without even realising. It was a fickle thing. But Tony was fickle.
“Wouldn’t be a party if not, right?” That might’ve been a tad inappropriate.
“One down.” He cornered Steve, stopping in front of him and forcing him to a halt.
At some point, Natasha returns and hands Clint a fresh set of aids. The archer locks challenging eyes onto Sam as he puts them on, but the other man simply stares for a few short seconds before shrugging and continuing to eat breakfast at midday.
~~~~~
But then a flash of red zooms by, just barely missing me, and I swear quietly as I use my inner arm to wipe away the bug guts.
“I don’t think we should be focusing on Loki,” Banner says. “That’s guy’s brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.” The (demi)god in the room frowns at the green giant.
"Holy shit!" Steve exclaims. I grin tiredly, leaning against the wall.
“Steve is about to get his ass handed to him by Ultron,” Clint replies.
My comm crackles to life.
Cho smiles weakly, and I place the phone on the ground beside her before I pull away.
Somebody pokes me, and my hand shoots out on autopilot, snagging the wrist attached to the hand attached to the finger and twisting it hard. A sharp yell of pain snaps me out of it, and I quickly let go.
His screams don’t last that long.
Clint is propped up against Sam with a broken ankle and mild abrasions on his left arm from where he’d toppled off of the roof of another building while nobody was there to catch him. The other man is trying hard not to, but I can see his expression fighting valiantly to remain neutral.
I swear viciously, but draw my elbow back and slam it into the other’s face hard enough to knock them out.
I didn’t expect Cap to actually come and ask my little trio to suit up, but he does. Clint and Nat go their way, and Maria tracks me down to drag me to the storage room, shoving a few crates at me and directing me to a room where I can change. There’s a single bench in here, and that’s where I sit. The boxes sit in front of me, and I’m straddling the bench, having the most intense staring contest with my past than any other that I’ve had before.
“Cam. I see you’re back to causing trouble.” I laugh as I drop down to my own feet, following Natasha as she begins to move again, throwing fond glances over her shoulder that she will definitely deny later when asked.
A tactical decision. Even if Thor could fly, the sound of his hammer whirring through the air would alert Ultron. It’s better if he moves on foot.
Good: Nat is with Ultron and alive and contacted Clint with her location.
“The Stark Tower?” Rogers asks. “That big, ugly—“
Something in Steve’s eyes flash, a bit of regretful longing mixed with guilt and realisation. I don’t know where all of these emotions are coming from, but I feel sorry for Steve all the same.
"What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me."
“It’s the Mind Stone,” the demigod quickly explains. “It’s one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.”
"Yeah," Sam replies modestly, shrugging.
I push myself to my feet immediately as the Soldier pauses for a moment, sprinting towards my whip, which is lying on the ground a few feet away. When I turn back around, the assassin has already yanked the arrow off of his arm, looking around for the source.
The concrete knocks all the air out of me, but I roll a few times and slam my hands against the ground to stop, scrambling to my feet as the Soldier advances. There’s a knife in his real hand, the metal one twitching and sparking as it reanimates itself.
“Dr. Banner and Agent Hinojosa are only here to track the cube,” a commanding voice states firmly. I snort quietly as Nick strides by purposefully. “I was hoping you might join them.” I roll my eyes, walking off of the table and into thin air as if it were a solid surface.
“Hey, there’s been a B&E at U-Gin Genetics Lab,” I say, quietly praying that it hasn’t been so long that my Korean is fucked. I gently thread my finger’s through Cho’s bloody one’s. “We have one serious injury, but she’s still conscious. There are” —I glance over my shoulder quickly— “four more injured, five unconscious. Again, we’re at the U-Gin Genetics Lab. Fifteenth floor. I can’t stay long, but I’m going to leave my phone here so that the injured can communicate with you until you get here.”
"Can you override it?"
“I don’t see why not.” Steve replied with an enthusiastic smile, pulling a stray curl out of Tony’s eye with the tips of his fingers – Tony’s eyes would narrow as if he was concerned about what Steve was doing to him, but there was something about how his jaw relaxed as his gaze fell back onto Steve’s face, his soft, warm eyes would show how he remembered he was safe, and that he was allowed to enjoy the warmth of another person. One day, Steve hoped, it would be so natural that Tony would have no doubts at all, and Steve could watch game shows with him and listen to his music just to make him happy, and it would be normal. “You deserve to be looked after.”
Steve pointed a long finger towards the slender boy picking at a red bass guitar. Dressed a little more moderately with a much calmer demeanour than the rest of the best, maybe he was just concentrating.
He read it, over and over again, six words, two period marks, ingrained into the back of his brain, clicking around and filling the space over and over again like clockwork.
sat on the edge of the low wall, throwing his legs over the wall, he didn’t seem to care at all. Tentatively following him, he sat beside him with his back to the city, Tony seemed to notice how he didn’t let himself hang over the edge like himself. “But because you’re here, I guess it’s ours now.”
“Right. Yeah.” Replied Tony with an air of apathy in his voice, looking to the hallway wall that hung a picture of the host and his parents. “Anyway, I’ve gotta go find Bruce, last I saw him he was drinking tequila like coke. And we all know how that story ends.” Sliding through the suddenly tiny seeming gap between Steve and wall, a casual smile and the shrug of his shoulders up at him like he didn’t care. He didn’t care at all, did he.
The tents were arranged in a circle within a rather dry yet tall forest just outside of town, a few bumps in the dirt and under grown trees putting more distance between a few of them, everybody’s bags and crates of beers rested against an oak east of the make shift camp they’d forged.
-of an idea, which he imagined Tony would appreciate given his style and love for David Bowie. Tony probably wouldn’t listen to it anyway.
“I - I just don’t know how anyone could put up with that. This obviously isn’t the first time he’s done this and I -“
“If I say yes, do I have to act on it?”
“I worked there with him for some time a little while ago for... reasons. Aaand long story short, I put weed in the batter and sold them on the side. I thought it was an innovative idea, space cakes, weed brownies they were old news, I had fuckin’ weed pretzels and they were
He turned to Tony, the most frightened he’d ever seen him.
the things he was saying about me in the bathroom since you were so keen to wait outside.” Pointing his finger as he walked and talked, keeping clear of all eye contact, purposefully trying to miss Steve’s faultiness attempting to breach through him.
“What’s not to get. He bailed. He obviously wanted to for a long time. Guess this just gave him a good escape route.” Tony sighed, sitting down at the table next to Steve’s friend.
It's a flurry of movement from then on. Most of them had put on the gear, but hadn't loaded up on weapons, so I have to skirt around a few guns and various other deadly weapons in order to get to the parachutes, where Clint, Nat and Steve are.
We’re not fast enough.
“I do,” Nick replies, waving the piece of bread in his hand around. “I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else.” He walks out from behind the counter, standing near the head of the table Nat and I are sat at. “Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit and our will to save the world.” He stands a little straighter, eye boring into each and every one of us in the room. “So stand.” Nick sits, and I stifle a laugh. “Outwit the platinum bastard.”
“I’m very tempted not to give you one,” Steve says, coming up behind me.
“A warm light for all mankind—“
"What do you mean by Subject 009?" I whisper. Natasha reaches out, grabbing me by the arm and dragging me back.
It was kinda hard to feel sorry for Clint when this happens on a regular basis.
“Sure we do,” Clint says, sitting backwards on a chair with his head resting on his folded arms, balanced on the back of the chair itself. “Go to wherever Dr. Cho is and kick Ultron’s ass.”
"Target is a mobile satellite launch platform, the Lemurian Star," he inform us. "They were sending up their last payload when pirates took them 93 minutes ago."
s out of nowhere, slamming into my side and sending me spinning through the air. By the time I manage to balance myself out, the speeder's coming in for another run. I whirl out of the way, then use both arms to swing my whip around to forcefully that it cuts through the speeder and its driver. My right side is burning, and I'm 95% sure that I've broken at least one rib. The left side of my face is getting painful to move, and my shoulders are aching from all the activity.
Sparks fly when the vibration collides with whatever the Soldier’s arm is made of, and I quickly launch off the catwalk as Steve advances, catching his shield just as the Soldier aims a few shots at him.
~~~~~
I snap out of it when four lasers slam into the body of the dead Chitauri that I still hold in front of me. The force sends me flying back into the balcony railing, and I grunt in pain. Loosening the whip in order to release the body, I let go of the end of the whip and bring it around to cut down the remaining three Chitauri. Moving fast, I stride over to the window and sweep the broken glass out of the way. Glancing over my shoulder to make sure that no one was hurt, I brace a foot against the windowsill and push off.
Now free, Ultron bends down all the way and grips Steve by the throat, backing him all the way up to the edge of the the truck.
“Well, you did something right,” Steve retorts, arms crossed tightly across his chest. “And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.”
I grab Clint and we grab weapons before heading over to the hospital.
Tucking into a ball, I roll under a jet of purple, and slash downwards with one arm to decaptitate an alien as it whizzes by on its speeder. Using another passing alien as a springboard, I rocket off in another direction, careening into a few cycles before digging my blades into one and flinging it at a few more.
“To become better,” Steve answers almost immediately. “Better than us. He keeps building bodies.”
It’s hard for me to keep my eyebrows from flying up and off my face, jaw unhinging just a little bit.
I blink once and the Winter Soldier from the present is gone.
"Is that what just happened?" Rogers mutters. I muffle a laugh as I float down onto the table again.
“JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge,” Stark cuts in. “In a few hours, I’ll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.” He offers the supersoldier the silver bag. “Blueberry?”
“I’ll speed up when I’m done saving your ass!” I call back, twisting in midair so that I’m flying backwards as I fire off a round to deter the fanged pterodactyl chasing us down 46th Street of NYC.
"Aren't you supposed to be in medical?" I grin, ducking past him with a hiss of pain.
The look on her face warns everyone against mentioning her position.
“Two minutes,” Steve says, hitting the ground running. “Cam, on my tail. Hawkeye, Widow, stay close.”
“Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I’ll give you that one,” Tony—because, really, if you stare down an evil Norse god who’s the brother of your teammate together while having a drink and can’t call each other friends, I don’t know what friends are—concedes. Loki pauses in his menacing model walk, calculating look on his face.
, Clint.”
“The gunshots?” he asks. I nod grimly. The blonde’s jaw twitches, glancing over when the sound of Steve hitting the roof of a car reaches his ears. “You stay. I’ll find her.” I salute him with two fingers, hurrying in the opposite direction of my partner after stowing my whip.
Tony hooks me up with bracelets that dampen my disruptor shield. Much subtler, easy to take on and off.
Taking a deep breath, I reach towards the top one and drag it towards me in order to pry the lid off.
“Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that,” Nick says grimly.
The first one I send the butt of my gun crashing through the top of its skull, and the second one I kick away. The force of it propels me through the air, my focus more on staying out of the way of everyone than keeping in place, and I yank my hand and the gun gripped in it out of the other Legionare’s skull.
I breathe out slowly as Steve’s footsteps retreat back into the living room that’s connected to a small kitchen. My breathing is evening out, the familiar rhythm of ribbing Steve settling my racing heart. My head is aching, like my brain had been pried out of my head and clumsily replaced in its efforts to unearth whatever mind fuckery Hydra had left me with.
"Thank you so much," I say, smiling at her as I detach myself from her.
“You’re the last of our potential recruits,” the director informs me as we take off. “You’ll meet the rest of them shortly after we arrive.” I roll my eyes.
After seeing the doctor’s look of pity as her clear green gaze (the sight of which had sent my mind looping back around to the woman, the one from my dreams born out of lost memory) took in my scars, I feel that urge again. The need to cut, be it out of spite or to forget for a few blissful moments, what that look of pity had looked like.
“Great,” I sigh, shifting on my feet. “We’ve still gotta find it.”
I snort. “Only if Katie didn’t pop in for a surprise visit.” I open the door, stepping inside and kicking off my boots. “Lucky!”
“But if iridium is the stabilizing agent, won't that mean that he can control how long the portal's open and how big it is?” I ask, crossing my legs as Stark makes his way over to the control deck, where five screens arranged in a half circle are set up.
“I’d say it’s nice to see you, but you’re a dick and you don’t bring cool presents when you come to visit like a normal weird uncle.”
“Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet,” Banner says.
~~~~~
“Do we even have a Plan B?” I retort.
"Romanoff missed the rendezvous point, Cap," Rumlow says. "We have Barton, no Romanoff. He says that he was coming back and she disappeared on him. Hostiles are still in play."
~~~~~
Wow. Totally off-topic. Point is, I haven't really been in on ops like these in a while, and I'm pretty sure that this is Nick's way of testing me out in the field as a SHIELD agent that isn't really an agent, after two years out of the game.
“The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it,” Thor argues. I raise an eyebrow mockingly.
Steve salutes me from the porch through the window.
"So, you doing anything fun Saturday night?" Natasha asks casually, taking a parachute out.
“Then Capsicle can stay at the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag—“
I should know.
~~~~~
His shield goes flying up immediately after.
But the group is quickly getting closer, and the whip isn’t that good for blocking a million lasers at once, especially not from different angles. Sure, I could whirl it around fast enough to create a shield against larger things, but small, thin purple lasers? Not a chance. I turn and run, cracking my whip once again to deactivate it, and jamming it into my belt as I take out a handgun. I risk a glance over my shoulder, blanching.
“Anyone recognize it?” I ask, frowning.
"You're a kid," Rogers insists heatedly. "You said it yourself, you're in college. You shouldn't be here." I shrug.
“I wouldn’t call it a comfort,” Steve replies with a small shake of his head.
“If you have the package, get it to Stark!” Steve orders. “Go!”
Taking a step back, I look at the not-roomba warily. The not-roomba rotates, before setting off into the workshop.
Clint and I look straight at Loki, and Natasha leans in to whisper something to him. Clint smiles slowly. I flip the god of mischief the bird with my good hand. Thor offers one end of the tube to Loki. He takes it, albeit reluctantly, and Thor nods to us all once. Then he twists his end of the tube and the brothers disappear in a flash of blue light. I blink the spots out of my eyes, wincing in pain as the fading bruise on the left side of my face makes itself known. Clint's arm is heavy around my shoulder, his hand intertwined with Natasha's where it rests on my shoulder.
“Why’re you here?” Tony asks, slumped over the counter.
Clint and I exchange looks, but we don't say anything else.
that tell me that there's definitely something going on. Clint is a little miffed that Nat abandonded him in the middle of a gunfight, but we both know that she wouldn't have done it if she didn't trust that he had it covered.
“Any hope of you forgetting that you want to kill me?” I ask, swallowing my fear. No answer, just the feeling that the glare is being dialed up to about a 10.5. “I’ll take that as a no.”
“Is this little display meant to insinuate that you’re going to throw me off the roof?” Sitwell asks. “Because it’s really not your style, Rogers.” A long pause, in which Steve’s face turns stone-cold and impassive.
"Which is...?" Clint prompts, raising an eyebrow. I glance at Steve, Maria and Natasha all up at the viewing room. Nat looks frazzled, despite looking perfectly put together. She'd burst into the viewing room barely a minute ago, eyes desperate and worried. Stiill, she's engaged in a low conversation with Steve at the window.
Bruce nods his assent.
“You got it, Cap,” Clint replies.
"Fucking SHIELD," I mutter, taking a long gulp from the pot.
"Well, they can't bank worth a damn," the archer offers. "Find a tight corner."
I throw Nat my gun and yank my whip out from where it was disguised as belt and press my bracelet.
"All right, I have a question for you," the redhead declares. I hum quietly to myself. Didn't expect her to be that blunt. "Which you do not have to answer," Natasha adds quickly. "But I feel like if you don't answer it, though, you're kind of answering it, you know?"
"Where you planning on hiding?" I ask. Clint shrugs, putting his purple jacket on.
“Sam and I are leaving tomorrow,” he tells me. There’s something sad in his voice. It reminds me of Ckint whenever he talks about SHIELD. It speaks of things lost but not forgotten.
“No, I
We touch glasses, sipping a good amount. The alcohol lights my throat on fire as it goes down, and I shiver at the feeling. It’s nice to know that I can still be human, even if I literally can’t tan or hold a phone to my ear without shorting it out. Still, this tequila won't hit me for a while if I take it slow. I shift so that I’ve got one arm propped up against the bar, acting casual even if we all know that it's just an act.
My eyes fly open at a knock on the door.
I shrug. “Clint needs new aids, but he wanted to see if you could fine-tune the old ones up a bit.”
"What else is more important than coffee?" Clint whines.
“Cam!” a reproachful Captain America yells. “No killing if you can help it!”
A pause, in whic everyone looks to Tony, whose braced his hands against a nearby table and hunched over a bit, and Bruce, standing at the billionaire’s side. And then Tony’s shoulders begin to shake as small, bitter chuckles leave his mouth. Bruce’s eyes widen, and he tries to shake his head subtly at Tony, but the genius takes no heed of the doctor’s warnings.
they’re talking about.
There is no warning when the hand that Ultron is gesturing with suddenly points towards Tony, an insubstantial, wispy sort of tractor beam yanking the billionaire towards him. Iron Legionaires drop from the catwalks above, and my foot lashes out to kick one towards the other end of the bridge. The Maximoff twin’s are gone in a flash of blue, and I growl. A metal fist barely misses my face, and I reel back to avoid the next hit. Below me, Tony is thrown back by a red beam emitting from Ultron’s hand.
The Maximoffs nod silently, and I cross my arms without giving any indication of agreement.
The Iron Man mask shows so emotion.
“On it,” the genius sighs.
~~~~~
The genius is pointedly Not Looking at anyone in the room.
"New Jersey," Steve replies, nodding awkwardly. Natasha goes back to the computer, and I glance back at my screen just as I press the down button and lose the game. I click restart.
Of course, Thor is Thor and is decked out in his battle armor anyways. I myself am half geared up, cargo jacket on, but whip hanging on my arm, knives clamped in my armpit and guns stacked and balanced precariously on the the other arm. My ammo has already been squirrelled away in the pockets of the cargo jacket, and as Tony readies the Quinjet for launch, I let my knives fall onto a seat, followed by my guns.
“We… we don’t have time,” I admit guiltily. Because Clint deserves so much more, deserves to have all the time in the world to heal. Someone who can care without hurting. The archer’s gaze bores into me.
Clips of Steve from the '40's, then of the SHIELD logo before landing on a picture of Howard Stark, Peggy Carter in the background.
Bruce looks up with a mildly surprised expression, but hands the file over to Tony. “From back in the day,” the genius elaborates, a bitter sort of aftertaste to his tone. Clint wanders over from the other side of the room, standing between Steve and Tony. “He operates off the African coast, black market arms.”
, barely audible over the noise of the guns, and there’s an opening. Pushing off at full force, I rocket through the air, arms crossed in front of my face. My armguards slam into the gunman’s chest, and the reapers unsheathe in his chest. I’m in the one behind him in the space of a breath, knocking the gun out of their hands and slamming them against the railing. Just as I’m about to tip them over the edge, a voice rings out.
A blur of silver-blue has me lashing out instinctively, but this time the Maximoff twin is not attacking me.
“No, those are tattoos,” Thor says, shaking his head. “This is a brand.”
The dinosaur lets out a high-pitched screech as I near the next building, quickly reversing my flight in order to slow myself down.
There's a beat of silence, almost undetectable. A quiet beep from the computer.
"News to me," I say.
"And why would I do that?" Clint goes eerily still next to me, rifle in hand, breathing steady, eyes focused.
“He has an army called the Chitauri, that none of Asgard nor any world know,” the blonde explains. “He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the earth. In return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.” Rogers raises an eyebrow.
Something nudges my foot, and I jump, settling into a fighting stance on instinct. Looking down, I see a small, circular robot, almost like a roomba, trundling up to my foot again. I stand stock still as the little thing makes a loop around my Converse, before running into my foot again. If it had eyes, I’d swear that it would be giving me an expectant look.
Steve grabs the opportunity, leaping up to grab Ultron’s ankles, pulling him back onto the truck.
"I'm pretty sure that Nat and I know who killed Fury," I say. Steve steps away from Natasha, eyebrows raised. I bite my lip, crossing my arms. "Natasha probably knows more of the specifics, but when I was on the roof I tried to get him with my whip." I swallow nervously, glancing at Clint. "And, uh, I... I don't know what it was, but it was like a memory and..."
I don’t hear Thor’s reply, because I’m too busy listening to the sound of Doombots crumpling under my feet. Two down, five to go.
~~~~~
And he sounds so
The Soldier is advancing once again, arm whirring into full working order. But before either of us can make a move, the sound of sirens splits the air.
"I am afraid that all of us are out of time," Zola says.
I snort, cracking an egg. “You need it,” I say firmly. “If you didn’t have Steve, you’d waste away in that damn workshop.”
"Lynx, I trust that you can take care of this yourself," he says, "but Fury recruited you under duress. He said that you were only here to track the cube. You shouldn't be out here, fighting with us. You were never meant to be here."
“Phil!” I exclaim, lunging at the man and attaching myself to him like a koala. My old mentor stands stock-still, supporting my weight with seemingly no effort and an amused smile.
I clear my throat. No response.
~~~~~
I whip out my own, bracing my hands on the dashboard as I kick my legs up, body screaming in protest as my feet slam into the Winter Soldier through the hole in the roof.
“Where is this guy now?” Steve asks.
“You already bought it, didn’t you.”
"Just like Budapest all over again!" Nat calls over the sound of gunfire. Clint and I both shoot her identical looks of disbelief.
“If we lose another engine, we won’t be in the air for much longer,” Maria interjects. “Someone’s gonna have to get inside and patch the engine.”
"Office building, south," I mutter to my self, scooping up the arrows. "Yeah, I can do that." Then I kick off, rocketing down the street with a cluster of arrows held tightly in one hand. I loop around the office building, tumbling through an already-broken window, and Clint manages to steady me. "Thanks," I say, slightly breathless. "Here's the arrows." More speeders
Vision’s hand sweeps down low, over the coffee table, and when he raises his arm, Mjölnr grasped in one hand, the whole world seems to grind to a halt.
"Lynx, watch your six!" Clint warns me. I barely dive out of the way before four speeders bank in a wide arc in order to face me again. I crack my whip, deactivating it before unsheathing my reapers.
"No, this is not because Clint is stuck in the hospital again."
"Какое дерьмо**," I whisper. The man just stares at me for a moment before turning—and as he does I catch sight of his metal arm, and on the shoulder of the arm is a red star that I know that I remember—
Clint is still rubbing comforting patterns onto my back.
“You three will be the death of me, I swear,” she mutters, ushering me out of the kitchen. My throat closes up at those ten familiar words, spoken over and over in a different, drier, male tone. Laura stills, hand on my back. “You need a second?” she asks softly.
"Just keep me posted," Tony orders. None of us get time to reply, because all of a sudden there's a barrage of lasers being fired. Steve's shield arm snaps up, shielding him from the onslaught, and Nat and Clint dive behind an overturned taxi. The lasers sting against my skin, and hit me with about enough force to bruise, but I raise my whip and bring it around. Speeders tumble out of the sky, and when the smart ones begin to retreat in order to get out of my range, I leap off the ground.
I blink, surprised. “Yes?”
~~~~~
Affirmative
Translations, all in order. Really sorry if I fucked anything up.
~~~~~
“Eighteen.”
"What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship?" Steve mutters to himself, looking down to put on his gloves. He doesn't wait for an answer. "All right, I'm gonna sweep the deck and find Batroc. Cam, you're with me. Clint, take the jet and put it into stealth mode. Get as close as you can and take out whoever you can see. Nat, you kill the engines and wait for instruction. Rumlow, you sweep aft, find the hostages, get them to the life-pods, get them out."
“I’m going to say this once,” Steve says, voice full of authority, commanding aura exuding from his every word.
“Then why don’t you stick a cork in it,” Sam snaps, eyes glued to the road.
There’s crashing down below, but I don’t have time to worry about that because there are men with guns and they’re aiming at me so I fuck behind stopped cars, empty of their owners.
“Verily!” Thor booms. I wince. “The man with eyes of a hawk is safe with me!”
"Guys, Lynx is hit," Steve says into his comm. "What do I do?"
~~~~~~
“Hinojosa,” Fury acknowledges, turning away from the sink. I sigh, pulling out a chair at the table.
"Standard tac team," the supersoldier murmurs. "Two behind, two across and two coming straight at us. If they make us, I'll engage, you hit the south escalator to the metro." I quickly duck into a nearby Victoria's Secret, praying that the tac team sent out are male, just as Natasha responds.
"Well, there's a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers," Natasha says for all of us.
"Uh, Steve is starting on breakfast if either of you want any," Sam says. I grit my teeth and muscle through the pain, because Jesus fucking Christ I am hungry and my stomach is screaming for attention.
The door leads us to a set of stairs, which Steve leads the way down. Natasha is right behind him, Clint behind her and me behind him. As we step off the stairs, I can just see the vague form of Steve switching the lights on. I blink once for my eyes to adjust to the new lighting, and the first thing I see when they do is a familiar logo emblazoned on the far wall. Clint sucks in a shocked breath from in front of me as the four of us advance forwards slowly.
There’s a knock on the door of my room not a moment after I’d thought that. Standing up and stretching, I open the door and see Clint standing outside with a phone in hand.
“Fuck, I need some coffee,” I mumble to myself. Straightening, I face the ravenette with resigned posture. Underestimation is the key to prying out information, and with my first impression it’ll be easy. Assuming Clint hasn’t spilt the beans yet, that is. At least now I’m not in a decaffeinated zombie trance. I hide my hands behind my back in order to conceal the telltale black gloves. The so-called god seems surprised, though, so that’s another bonus.
"We're not finished yet," Thor says. I let out a long, drawn-out groan, slumping sideways onto the Hulk's leg.
Up at the window, the red of the creature turns into a scaly-looking dark green-blue and it turns, floating down to the ground beside Thor. I follow suit, albeit warily, hands resting at my hips, where my knives are.
"That's for Phil," I mutter, breathing heavily.
~~~~~
“Zola,” Steve mutters, still lost in thought. “Bucky’s whole unit was captured in ‘43. Zola experimented on him. Whatever he did helped Bucky survive the fall.” He’s looking up now, at Sam. My head is pounding, and I blink away the spots in my vision. “They must have found him and…”
"C'mon, Cap, I'm not an invalid," I growl. Steve's frown deepens, and he holds my whip away from me.
~~~~~
Kate is back in Bed Stuy petsitting Lucky.
"Cover me!" Clint yells all of a sudden. He doesn't wait for me to confirm before he's slinging his bow over his shoulder and making a beeline towards a bus. I move to cover him smoothly, swapping guns smoothly when the cartridge runs dry. A few minutes later, Clint reappears at my side, arrow flying before he even comes to a stop.
A pause, in which Clint’s face darkens. His attention shifts to me.
I shower and half change into my combat outfit, entire body wired to run at a moment’s notice. Reading over the meagre files we have on the two enhanced, I carefully think about ways to counteract their powers.
“What do you mean?” Natasha replies casually, straightening up and mirroring my pose.
~~~~~
Skidding to a stop, I swing around, arms flexing, and fling the blonde towards the truck. He tucks and rolls to his feet, and I uncoil my whip as I follow him down the road.
"The file came from these coordinates," Natasha replies. She has her StarkPhone out, display lit up. Clint's grip on the rise of his bow is white-knuckled, and his hand keeps on drifting towards his quiver.
"25," the STRIKE operative replies, flipping past something and clicking on another icon. A photo pops up of a man with huge-ass ears and a massive nose. "Top mercs led by this guy, Georges Batroc. Ex-DGSE, Action Division. He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice. Before the French demobilized him, he had 36 kill missions. This guy's got a rep for maximum casualities."
All too soon, we’re drawing even with the fourth floor.
“Really not the time,” Steve sighs. “Lynx, the driver’s down.”
“So what does he want?” Nick asks, morbidly interested.
~~~~~
"Nope," I lie shamelessly.
Natasha’s head lolls back, and her red hair shifts to reveal a slowly spreading dark red patch on her jacket. Sam follows my line of vision, twisting his neck to do so. He quickly turns to one of the STRIKE agents.
“Okay, come here,” I sigh, tucking the small box I’d been holding into my back pocket and reaching out to snatch the screwdriver in Tony’s hand away. When he makes a small noise of dissent and reaches for the screwdriver, I snag his wrist and drag him back the way I’d come. For some reason, the roomba follows us into the elevator and into the kitchen.
"Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull," the blonde says as Clint circles around the computer, inspecting the ancient contraption. "He's been dead for years."
. There are more Hydra agents dropping from the bridge above and gunfire going off, but when the Soldier turns and locks eyes with me, it all goes away.
"Guys, we've got more incoming," Steve warns. I straighten up quickly, scooping my whip up from where I'd released the handle on the ground.
And the way that Tony says it is sad, almost, resigned. He points his StarkPhone at the nearest patch of empty floor, and a 3D schematic of wrecked code pops up.
“And you do?” Bruce pipes up, voice uncharacteristically stony. His eyes are fixed on Wanda. “She’s not in your head?”
"You know who killed him, don't you?" she asks as the call goes through. My posture immediately tightens, and I cross my arms.
Eight-year-old me had not know what she had meant back then, but I do now.
James Buchanan Barnes’ (but not quite, because this man is no longer James Buchanan Barnes) metal hand glints in the sun as he raises a gun to shoot, but then Sam is swooping out of nowhere in his flying suit, knocking him to the ground. He stumbles to a landing beside me as the Soldier rolls to his feet.
"But he's not working alone," Steve says. "Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star." I sit up straight, scrunching my nose up in pain. It's not as bad as when I woke up, but it still kinda sucks.
"Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?" Sam asks. "I hear the crab cakes here are delicious."
Still, I've been involved enough to know that the reason Nat's trying to set Steve up with girls is to make Tony jealous so that he can finally grow the balls to ask Steve out. Everyone except Steve and Tony can see the looks that they give each other when they think no one is watching. Honestly, it's kinda depressing to see just how oblivious the two can be. It's a collaborative project, getting those two to woman up and confront their feelings, and I think that even JARVIS is helping.
“If you believe in peace, then let us keep it,” Thor jumps in.
“Shit, Cap,” I say, tumbling to a messy landing at the front of the train. We’re no longer on any tracks, the momentum from its previous planned path having the train plough through concrete streets.
"Clint and Cam and here," the ex-Russian superspy cuts in, ignoring the supersoldier's protests. "We all need to talk to you."
A pause.
“Do we have an ally?” Nat asked, a wary sort of hope in her eyes. It is a new look that I quite like, but Nick’s own eye is hard.
“Well, performance issues, not uncommon,” Tony comments. “One out of five—“
“Nat!” Clint suddenly exclaims.
“So,” I begin, shoving the glove into a pocket and angling myself up once again, “turns out my ‘mojo’, as you put it, works on alien shit.”
The kick collides with the Soldier’s metal hand, and I grit my teeth as the force of the impact reverberates throughout my entire body. After a beat of hesitance, I use the residual momentum to throw my body forwards, bending in half to grab the Soldier’s wrist and wrench my ankle free of his grasp. I twist as the ground comes up to meet me, hitting it in a roll with my right shoulder.
“And you’re all about style, aren’t you?” the blonde counters sarcastically.
“Why’re you here?” Tony asks again as I open the bread.
“Ah, fuck it,” I mutter, pulling away from the pilot’s seat to face the rest of the team. They’re all standing, everyone but Nat looking some shade of confused and apprehensive.
"Five years ago, I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran," Natasha replies, words getting a little faster now. "Somebody shot out my tires near Odessa. We lost control, went straight over a cliff. I pulled us out. But the Winter Soldier was there. I was covering my engineer, so he shot him straight through me." She tugs up her shirt, revealing a not-so-old scar. "Soviet Slug. No rifling. Bye-bye bikinis." She puts her shirt back down.
"Why did I get a notification that said to be on the lookout for you because you're a wanted criminal by SHIELD?" the redhead asks, holding up her phone. Clint and I both make a noise.
“I asked him to,” Steve says simply. I take a long draw from the mug, because,
"I used to. Let's go." A click, and then I see the superspy and the supersoldier walk in front of me on the other side of the table. Clint starts a new game of Flappy Bird. I close out of my tabs, head out of the store and tug my beanie down to make sure that all of my blue hair is hidden. It's loud out here, with a lot more people than the Apple Store, so I have to focus hard in order to listen in on the conversation that Nat and Steve are having.
“One op,” I say firmly, holding up a gloved finger. A silver cord woven into the black material glints in the sun. Fury hands me the tablet under his arm.
"I'm almost entirely sure that what you just said was Biblically inaccurate," I quip, covering up my surprise. Clint opens his mouth, but Natasha cuts in before he can really say anything.
"I'm not gonna ask you again," Steve growls, getting up in Natasha's face. I raise my hand again, clearing my throat. The supersoldier and the spy both turn to look at me.
