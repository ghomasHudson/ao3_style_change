“Right,” John said. A few awkward seconds passed before John broke the silence again, determined not to let this ruin how perfectly breakfast was going. “So what’s his name?”
Sherlock made a noise of agreement in the back of his throat but made absolutely no effort to dislodge himself from the blonde, now sucking on the bites he’d left on his collarbones. John, in turn, decided he didn’t particularly care either and set out to help Sherlock with his shirt, the artist’s trembling fingers were not really doing much in the desperation. He threw the garment across the room and locked his mouth with the artist’s, tasting the wine they’d drunk and a slight taste of the tiramisu dessert they’d ‘shared’ on his tongue (if you could call Sherlock eating most of it on the first bite sharing).
Minerva McGonagall
Sherlock thought to himself.
Lestrade looked between the two of them, eyes narrowed in bemusement. “Gentlemen? There’s a dead body upstairs.” It sounded like a question.
The experiments in emotional outbursts stopped, much to John’s both relief and disappointment. He had expected Sherlock’s mood to be all over the place, one second irritated and the next sulking. But he just seemed… off. For the past few days, they’d done little more than sit quietly together, reading books from the Holmes’s extensive collection on every subject imaginable. Since meeting John Eliza had made a point of purchasing plenty of Muggle-published books too, that Sherlock if anything found even more fascinating. He was currently flipping through a book about Apiology and bee-keeping, his back against their usual tree.
“These are... amazing” John beamed
He blinked a couple of times and felt the sharp sting of dryness. He really should put little reminders in his mind palace to blink once in awhile when he got lost in there, he thought. He looked back at the woman in the painting one last time just to check it had not magically figured itself out while he was relaxing. Nope. Same mint green jumper. Same inky black hair down to her waist. The military tags around her neck were still engraved with the name of her deceased brother, the slight rust on the edges betraying her often clutch of it to relieve her anxiousness and grief. The eyes and mouth, however, said nothing. He frowned at them, willing them to betray her distrust in every other family member and their disrespect for her sexual orientation and her choice of career. Sherlock had caught a glimpse of her only for a moment when he had been walking down the street to buy some cigarettes but the single glimpse of the fast walking woman and the quarter of a second eye contact were enough to send Sherlock flying back to his studio and sketchbook. Something was missing from his painting, though. Although it was a fascinating subject, it still did not do enough to fill Sherlock’s mind.
The artist paused, biting his lip “Could you- I mean, would you like to come over?” he asked shyly.  “I mean, we don’t have to do anything but-“
“John?” Sherlock whispered
Sally looked at him, mouth slightly agape and Sherlock froze, afraid he’s somehow let the secret out, accidentally confessed to being shagged by the model into the mattress repeatedly.
“What’s so funny?” Sherlock asked curiously.
want to be John’s friend. More than anything he wanted that. But he wanted so much more too. He’d known for a while. Since before he and John had been in touch again, even. But now that John was here again, boyish round face chiselled into a manly, teenage boy’s rugged handsomeness, Sherlock had damn near got all his breath knocked out of his when he saw him sitting at the Gryffindor table that very first day he’d arrived.
As hard as Sherlock tried he could not help the happy grin that bloomed across his face. Yes… it was his first week at Hogwarts with John. At last.
“Yes, you nevertheless spent an entire week at the hospital wing.” He shot back, raising an eyebrow.
“You should… accompany me again. I really… appreciated your insight”
“I work in the school cafeteria so it was really no trouble getting it from his room. I owe that man my life” Angelo beamed. “You take care of that more carefully!” he laughed, already turning away and raising a hand in farewell.
And so Sherlock went around the room. Occasionally saying “Wrong” or “You’re drawing is boring me. Stop boring me.
More smut, fluff and getting to know each other better <3<3 Can you see the angsty part on the near horizon? *chuckles evilly* Don't worry it won't hurt too much... ish ;)
“What the on earth are these?” Sherlock couldn’t stop giggling as he pointed at several tiny dots and smudges John had smeared on the sliver of back you could see and a single squiggly dot on his hip.
“Never!” John snickered, dodging Sherlock’s attempts to tickle him back. He leant closer and closer to Sherlock’s space until somehow he was half on top of him and their combined weight was too much for their balance. For the second time that evening Sherlock suddenly went “OH!” as the snow behind him crumbled under them and he fell backwards into a pile of snow, pulling John with him. John fell with a soft oomph onto Sherlock’s chest.
John snorted “Be friendly?
“Molly!” he called out, just as Greg sprinted towards her.
A man that was most certainly not Sherlock was standing there smiling, he was only slightly taller than himself and rather rounded. He had a thick black beard and his long thick hair was pulled back into a messy ponytail. All in all he looked joyful and… jolly for a lack of a better word.
The Gryffindor watched him walk away, smiling softly to himself, the sneering of the Slytherin team seeming muted and far away. He looked back towards his team and caught Greg’s eye, who smiled and motioned with his head towards Sherlock’s retreating figure and looked back to his Captain, smiling knowingly. “You guys…. got something going on?”.
Of course, Art school had not been cheap. And his mother, raising two boys single-handedly simply could not support Sherlock as he tried to make a name for himself in the vast world of art. His style, as well as his personality, had never been completely understood this world. He did not find this completely surprising as at an early age he had learned that ‘normal people’ did not feel a need to quiet their minds due to the incessant buzzing and incoming information per second. So after college Sherlock had found himself a teaching job for figure drawing lessons at his old college while he paid off his loans and he worked on his gallery showings and worked for Scotland yard on the sidelines for free. Teaching for him was easy money and he did enjoy it to a certain extent.
Irene turned to see him, grinning widely. She made to approach him but noticed the interviewer and nodded to express they would talk later. She surveyed John by his side and looked him up and down with wide eyes before turning back to Sherlock and winking suggestively, a proud grin pulling at her lips. Sherlock couldn’t help the happy smile he sent her way.
As soon as the bus took off and John sat on one of the empty seats close to the front. He hesitated over sitting on one of the reserved seats for the incapacitated next to the bus door but remembering his lack of limp smiled and took the ones behind.
Sherlock just laughed “Of courthe!” and kept walking merrily. John’s eyebrows rose, still concerned but after a couple of seconds just snickered and followed Sherlock. “What IM wondering” Sherlock suddenly said, as John caught up with him “is what on earth are these.. video games?” he turned to look at John seeming completely perplexed. John grinned.
Sherlock could not help the shy smile that pulled at his lips “You really think so?”. He wished he didn’t sound so insecure but he rarely had people critique his work. Ever. He knew he was good. The scholarship, the approving looks of his professors, the jealous stares of his peers and Mrs Hudson’s praises were enough evidence to come to that conclusion, but that was nothing like the way John was looking at him now. Like Sherlock had magically conjured some amazing spectacle all by himself.
according to the several websites he had done his research on.
“I have an experiment.” Sherlock said quickly, “I need a sample of ‘devil snare’ and I asked professor Longbottom for some, but he wouldn’t let me cut it without an official authorization. Even if I tried to get it  I wouldn’t for at least a couple of weeks. Besides… rules are dull”. It wasn’t an outright lie. He
John looked up.
“Gregory” he paused “Well… Greg.”
Mrs. Hudson hummed in answer, Sherlock finally looked up to see her. Her eyes were narrowed as she stared at him, clearly trying to figure something out. “Is this him too?” she peered over to the sketchbook opened to a page featuring John’s upper body, starting form the torso and up. The drawing was perfectly detailed, from the expansive scar on his shoulder to the eyelashes hooding his eyes. Mrs. Hudson picked up the sketchbook, and leafed through it. The John’s covering the pages were no wonder staring at her with telling smirks.
, but he nevertheless had the mothers of the baby hippogriff’s close by.
“Yeth.” Sherlock agreed. “You should come over for the last week before you have to go back to muggle school” he smiled at John as the latter answered him with a surprised but delighted grin that for some reason made Sherlock’s insides feel warmer.
... my Bumble-bee” John kissed his neck wetly, sucking slightly and pressing himself more insistently onto Sherlock and running his hands down Sherlock’s chest
“What? Really?” he grinned, his dimples sinking and his eyebrows rising with excitement. Sherlock instantly decided he never wanted that expression to leave the blonde’s face ever again.
John sighed. Wondering when this bloody class would finally end. He did his best to ignore Mary... and the sneaking tingling in his neck that someone was staring at him intently.
Sherlock frowned even further, eyes narrowing and a deep growl rising in his throat. Jealousy.
“Come on.  You want to go walk around or something?”
“Oh God yes!”
you”.
“ARGH! Sherlock!”
John smiled, remembering his own sorting ceremony, vividly.
John’s nerves dissipated, leaving a more familiar feeling of smug thrill at having this reaction on someone. “Alright?” he asked.
It had been steadily snowing for the past couple of days, and the outside grounds were completely buried in fluffy white mounds which John absolutely wanted to throw himself into. So they both set out wearing their winter coats, scarves, hats and gloves. John snorted at how posh the Beauxbatons winter uniform was, with frilly fur that served more for decorative purposes than actual heat. Sherlock had rolled his eyes and stolen some of John’s woolly winter socks in retaliation.
“You definitely could stand being a little nicer to those kids don’t you think?” John suddenly said. Sherlock, surprised, turned and saw him walking out from behind the screen back into his jeans and jumper, cane in one hand and phone in the other.
“Sure! Unless you’re scared I’ll still beat you!” he nudged Sherlock’s side teasingly.
How could he have one this to him? Why? Goddamn bastard. Hell, maybe Mary was right. Maybe Sherlock Holmes had become nothing more that a little…
John giggled “I’m really excited to meet her, I know how important she is to you.” He pressed his cheek against the artist’s nape, the later feeling the warm exhalation of breath trickle down beneath the thin silk of his dressing gown. “I just can’t believe I didn’t know about bumble-bee” John giggled, tickling Sherlock’s sides softly.
“OH! Christ! I’m so sorry!” John cried.
Some students preferred to stay during lunch to either relax with a book or chat with their fellow classmates in the quiet classroom instead of the crowded cafeteria. Sherlock, preferring to clear his mind and needing some change of scenery always opted to go for a small walk during the hour-long break. He picked up his notepad, looking back only once in minimal hesitation at leaving John behind. But why shouldn’t he? John was just a stranger. Why on earth should Sherlock feel compelled to spend his lunch time in the classroom trying to figure him out? Ridiculous. Sherlock forced himself to tear his eyes away from John’s figure, which was slipping the black robe on and reaching for his phone.
“An emergency, eh?” John laughed. “I… maybe. I don’t know”
Sherlock smiled sadly. “I felt it too. I’m afraid my father was ashamed to have a “fag” as he would constantly call me, as a son.”
“You just came up with that? Just now?”
“Five serial murders and now an innocent husband. It’s Christmas!” Sherlock enthused, zipping up the bag and throwing it over his shoulder.
John chuckled “Fine. THREE, TWO, ONE…. GO!” They both threw the balls into the air and John zoomed in slamming down the bat and sending the ball flying directly into the middle hoops on Sherlock’s side. Sherlock, in turn, held the bat with both hands and swung as hard as he could to his own ball, desperate to get to John’s rapidly approaching ball, but just then John whooshed in front of Sherlock and intercepted the Beauxbatons ball, sending it alongside the other to Sherlock’s right hoop.
John looked like he felt… like he wasn’t sure how he felt. Sherlock tried his best to deduce him. Tried his best to not focus on his nervously hammering heart and the blood roaring in his ears and watched him. Nothing. He could focus on
She hummed “Didn’t sleep much last night. Kate kept me… busy.” She laughed under her breath “Though I can tell you didn’t sleep much either… has someone kept you busy too? Lord knows
“So… see you later then?” John asked quietly
Greg nodded, looking a little more at ease now. He walked alongside John until they reached the stage. Names started being called in and then they started sitting down at their enthusiastic tables.
John watched them, heart pounding and a sinking feeling in his chest. He couldn’t breathe. This had something to do with Sherlock’s father, he was sure. Whatever it was wasn’t good. But why wouldn’t she tell Sherlock? How did it involve him? John wasn’t so sure he wanted to know.
in fact, giving them the side eye.
about death or some horrible freak accident? Now she had his curiosity. He sat up straighter. John looked at the professor, intrigued as well.
“Not hungry,” John smiled “At least… not for food,” he winked. Sherlock blushed to the tips of his ears, basically tripping over himself in his hurry to get up and follow John as he walked towards the entrance of the Great Hall. Knowing John though, he took a couple of biscuits and scones from the table and stuffed them into his pockets, for later.
Sherlock tried his best to haul him up but his sudden stop had also made him lose focus and disrupted his balance. “Shitshitshit!”. He toppled towards John uncontrollably and watched in slow motion as his friend’s eyes widened in shock as they both slid forcefully on the ice and tumbled in a pile of limbs onto the icy hard ground.
“Miss Adler” Sherlock acknowledged her with a curt nod, still not looking up.
As prefects they didn’t ride the train with the others, having to stay for a meeting with the rest of the prefects in a separate cubicle before every school year. But at least they were together. He finally spotted a familiar tinge of light brown hair scooped up into a ponytail walking almost at the very front of the crowd. “There she is!” he cried, he fastened his pace towards her, Greg trailing closely behind.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ve got you”, the words were exhaled into the hollow of his collarbone. He felt John press his weight on top of him and he sighed, feeling every inch of John press against him skin to skin and reveling in it. “What do you want love?” John kissed down his chest, taking one of his peaked nipples into his mouth and sucking it gently. Sherlock cried out, surprised by the intensity of the feeling.
in the living room where John could hear their every word. He cleared his throat, “we’ve only been living together for 8 and a half months I think the kid's talk can wait” he said hurriedly, trying to hush his tone as best he could whilst attempting not to be obvious. He felt himself blushing to the tips of his ears in mortification as John looked up from his paper curiously.
He cleared his throat. “So. Are we done here?” he asked Lestrade.
“Maybe…” The blonde continued “Maybe we could go to my place?”
Sherlock took another lungful from the delicious swiveling steam and began quietly,
“Sherlock?”
In a matter of seconds, John was left alone sitting on the side of an empty bed, looking towards the space Sherlock had left behind him, feeling empty and immensely unhappy with the world.
(See the end of the chapter for
John.
“Okay...” Sherlock said dubiously. “But why?”
Dear Mr Watson,
Sherlock smiled. “Well, some are definitely more entertaining than others. What’s not to love about a man-eating shark? James Bond, on the other hand…”
“Clearly. You clearly handle yourself somewhat well without cane walking, you seem to forget about the cane completely in stand still and clearly, you can hold your weight comfortably while modelling, almost as if the pain completely disappears which is not something that would happen if the pain was even partly psychosomatic. So, clearly, the pain is at least partly if not mostly imagined”
Sherlock snorted, of course, John would be interested in such sentimental things. But he had to admit the fact that John
“I don’t know” John whispered back, nervously. “You?”
Eventually, it got dark enough that they decided to go back indoors. However, instead of heading back to their own common rooms, they silently agreed to finally explore the restricted section in the library Sherlock had promised to show John.
Eventually, he had graduated from Baker’s Art College with honors and an immense amount of talent but  without finding that one thing he yearned for.
Eliza let out a shuddering breath.
“All okay?” John prompted, a small nervous smile pulling at his lips.
“Sorry, Cap! I was just playing around!” she grinned, swinging her bat playfully. Mike, who was rubbing his head with one hand whilst clutching his broom for dear life didn’t look so amused.
John kissed the inside of his creamy thighs, pulling them up above his shoulders and letting his hands caress his hips gently. A small part of Sherlock expected it when John took him into his mouth and started teasing the swollen head with his tongue, but that did not in any way stop the low groan of pleasure or the instant reaction his hands had as they latched themselves onto John’s hair and pulled, not hard enough to dislodge his mouth but enough to tease.
?” John stopped in his tracks, his heart thumping loudly, his ears roaring. Had he just jumped 3 meters into the air? But that was impossible! Completely impossible! How could anyone possibly
“To the lab!” he called out to John, who closely tailed him with a slightly confused but very intrigued grin.
“Whatever you like, John. I’ve seen most of this place. I guarantee it’s all very fascinating”.
In the end, the most prominent emotion he had up till now was anger. A familiar buzz in his veins thrummed to the beat of his whirling thoughts. He’d already been hurt enough when Sherlock had never attempted to make contact with him. HIM. Someone, Sherlock had claimed was his very best friend. His
asked professor Longbottom for a sample. But he had also already asked him for an authorization form. And he’d already filled it out. But it was the only thing he could think of. And… sneaking into the Greenhouse with John held some sort of appeal. Some edge of danger... and something about being alone with the blonde in the darkness of the greenhouse gave him a strange sense of enticement he couldn’t quite place.
“So Mr.Holmes what can you smell?” Slughorn asked again
She smiled menacingly and leaned as close as she could “Very good. And I'm not blackmailing Sherly… just looking for protection. Anyway, you'll help me”. She concluded
John tilted his head further, perfecting the lock of their lips as he gently kissed those plush pink lips over and over and over again, just as he’d been dreaming of doing for months and months. Sherlock groaned softly into John’s mouth as the latter pulled his lower lip between his lips and sucked softly, dragging it tenderly with his teeth in a way that Sherlock swore could make him combust with that alone. Who knew kissing could feel like this? If Sherlock had known earlier… well, he probably would’ve kissed John a lot sooner. John was gentle, but possessive. Sweet, but dominating. He pushed himself into Sherlock’s space and absolutely
Sherlock kept staring at John’s lips on the painting, letting himself wonder what it would feel like if those lips were to press against his. Would they feel as soft as they looked? Would they be gently or demanding? Pulling or pressing?
“John?” Sherlock said, walked up close to him, feeling his heart lodging up his throat.
Time, these summers, had been spent talking, playing Quidditch, pirates, and helping out Sherlock with crazy theories and experiments in his backyard. John’s first impression of Sherlock had been that he was a boy with definite personal boundaries and a highly superior intelligence and although the latter held up John soon discovered Sherlock had very small personal boundaries, finding it completely natural to use John as an armrest, chin rest and whole body rest when he fell into his spontaneous sulks where he thought everything was dull. John didn’t even react anymore when Sherlock just fell into his side in despair for something interesting to happen.
been a very good daydream after all.
He had expected Trelawney to be a bit of a mess with her predictions. He suspected she
“I see your practice went well”
“Hello?” John asked hesitantly, his lips pulling into an automatic polite if a little hesitant smile. “Can I help you?”
“Yes”
The usual for rings from his clock chimed into the early dawn and Sherlock jumped out of bed. Normally his routine consisted of no more than showering and styling his hair very simply before wearing the first suit he laid his eyes on. Today, however, something tingled in the back of his mind. He tried his best to convince himself that he wasn’t lingering in the mirror to perfect every single curl on his head and styling them in a slightly puffed but soft looking style just because he would be seeing the new model again. Obviously not.
Eventually as the ten minutes of the break ticked by the rest of the class trickled back in, all holding half drunk coffee cups in their hands and looking significantly more ready to tackle on their drawings for the rest of the day. John and Mary were still talking, from what Sherlock gathered John was a very friendly and approachable person, laughing at Mary’s jokes and responding politely to everything. Nevertheless, he could also tell that John wasn’t an open person, nothing he said revealed anything personal about himself and he preferred to listen much more than talk. But then again these observations were made by only observing John talk to one individual, one whose interest he was not seeking for.
floor. We have no idea what happened or why".
“You want me to?” John murmured as he looked up at Sherlock under hooded eyes. He could see how flustered Sherlock was getting already, but seeing him become more confident was a huge turn on for him. He wanted Sherlock to know how much John wanted him. How gorgeous he really was.
“Of course, it is. What might you have been thinking mm?” Sherlock rose a challenging brow, eyes shining with mischief.
Sherlock was quite used to having nights like these where he would not sleep at all trying to finish up a painting, or because he had far too many ideas and he simply had to sketch them all before he inevitably overthought them all and ended up doing absolutely nothing but stare intently at one of his many sketchbooks.
, pulling the Beauxbatons snugly against his own body.
“Mm- what? Oh um. Y-yes. S’fine” Sherlock blabbered out. He licked his lips.
Sherlock handed him his tea and motioned towards the open door with his head, leading they way. He let of a long breath quietly, knowing that however he and John’s relationship was going to progress was going to be narrowed down to however the next few minutes. He bit his lip and opened the door the rest of the way, John stepped into the dark room and Sherlock closed his eyes, braced himself and turned on the light.
The end.
The drawing…Well. It was pretty dreadful. It held absolutely no resemblance to Sherlock at all. It looked like some sort of mutant swan creature layered in dots and smudges.
So he did.
John had padded quietly behind Sherlock to observe him painting from a closer range. Sherlock had been staring unblinkingly, eyes wide and wondering. His right cheek was matter with a large stripe of blue paint and his hair was matted different colours from Sherlock’s stained fingers. He had looked intensely adorable.
John’s heart clenched painfully in his chest, the sight of this man before him struggling, looking down at his shuffling feet and…nervous? The blush was back in his cheeks. John’s eyes peered down as the redness spreading onto his neck and chest just like he’d daydreamed about. He let out a shaky breath into the cold night air.
John looked back at Sherlock, his interest piquing a little “Did you?”
“Well... the room doesn’t show signs of a struggle. But I suppose the killer could’ve covered that… he doesn’t show signs of any kind of physical harm, though”
“Shut up, Greg” John laughed, swatting his friend on the arm with the back of his hand. Nevertheless, he made absolutely no move to tear his eyes away from the gorgeous crowd of students passing by before him, a quiet parade of beauty. If anything he just seemed more focused on them.
The Gryffindor common room was drenched in golden light as the fire’s embers slowly dimmed. The warm air against their freezing wet skin was a definite relief and John couldn’t stop the sigh of pleasure that escaped his lips. Sherlock echoed it behind him. Their fingers were still interlaced with each other, and John couldn’t stop the little jumps his stomach made every time he thought about it or focused on the heat between their pressed palms.
John swallowed at hearing Sherlock say ‘thick’ so slowly.
Headmistress
All his life, John Watson had been utterly ordinary. His parents. His sister. His day to day life.
“There is another way!” John suddenly exclaimed. “You don’t have to stay with him! He treats you... he treats
So, John took Sherlock there to re-watch all the classic movies they’d seen as children, Sherlock had put up a token protest but had naturally sat down raptly to wait for John to pop in the movie, blanket in hand. John had draped his arm on the back of the soft and scene after scene, it had somehow crept closer to Sherlock until somehow halfway through the movie it rested comfortably against his neck. Sherlock had been a bright beet red colour for the rest of the movie, and the snarky deductions had halted to a suspicious stop.
John grinned. “Good! Well… I’ll see you tomorrow at breakfast then?”
He ran inside the shop with him and after another few minutes of Sherlock making very good arguments and the shop owner nodding enthusiastically to each and every one of them John walked out of the store and into the rapidly darkening streets of Diagon Alley with the Owl perched on a pearly white cage.
Summer began pretty much as any other summer John was used to nowadays. Sherlock and Elizabeth (“
John had laughed along with a couple of other students but had afterwards not been overly eager to approach Sherlock after seeing a girl crying after the Ravenclaw had deduced her parents were getting a divorce in the following week. Naturally, John had been impressed by the stranger’s strange powers of knowledge when a letter had arrived saying that the girl's parents were, in fact, separating but he was hesitant to meet the strange boy, afraid of what he might see in John.
The artist expected him to accept the accusation, or if he was lucky some angry denials but what he wasn’t expecting was for John to reach out and in one swift move pull Sherlock’s body against his, arms wrapped around his waist into a tight hug. “Sherlock” John whispered, pressing his lips very lightly to the side of Sherlock’s neck. “I couldn’t possibly be interested in anyone other than you… I thought you knew that. I thought...” he pressed Sherlock even tighter against himself, sounding pained and saddened by the thought of Sherlock thinking he would ever pursue someone else when he finally had this amazing gorgeous man.
He expected John to scoff but he just looked more confused “The other models said you do that. But I haven’t even put my info on the website. There’s no way you could have known that”
“Good. Great. Whatever. Where is it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What can I get you boys?” the booming voice of the waiter resounded between them, bursting their tiny shared moment.
“Yes John” Sherlock gasped out “Please” he added.
Sherlock blinked, his eyes glassy. His breathing became ragged, his eyes filling with tears. He turned abruptly, leaving the kitchen in a sprint before anyone could say anything else. John could hear his steps thundering rapidly up the stairs, the hints of a quiet sob muffled through the walls.
“Sorry?” John turned around, his long blond bangs swishing with the motion and stumbling out of his raised stance. His sights fell upon the owner of  the high voice, a small boy around his age with had dark brown hair that was completely untamed in messy curls that framed his pale face. The face itself was thin but he had two round cheeks that were rosy and soft and his lips resembled a tiny red rosebud that contrasted completely with the stark grey blue of his eyes.
The following couple of hours had been possibly the strangest of any of their lives. There was a lot of talking on the McGonagall’s side, and a lot of confusion on the other. In the end, what was understood was that everything John had ever thought to be impossible was indeed… happening to his big sister.
“As in… your nickname when we played pirates?” John grinned. “That's brilliant! I want to meet him”.
Sherlock came first, long and hard clutching John so tightly he was sure he would leave bruises but John didn’t seem to care. He felt the pleasure build from deep within his groin and erupt feverishly. He saw white beneath his eyelids as he tensed, leaving him shattered in the consuming aftershocks.  John followed not much later with a groan, shivering as Sherlock’s body had tensed around him and made everything so much tighter, so much more real.
This is a short-ish chapter-- intro to teenlock, kinda <3<3 I already started the next one so I HOPE itll be up in about a week!! Next chapter will be like twice the size of this one i think<3<3
“You look gorgeous” John smiled.
“Umm.. looking for someone?” Lestrade asked, finally noticing that he was not listening to a single word he was saying.
“What’s true?” John whispered back, confused.
How could a student have made such an impression in such a short amount of time? The first class wasn’t even over! John almost wanted to grin, his curiosity peaked as he once again attempted to get a look. But all he caught was a flashing glimpse of blue robes. A Beauxbatons then. Even more interesting.
“I know… I just... He means well, he’s just… temperamental. And… I just can’t leave him. I can’t… What would happen to us?” her voice was a whisper, and John knew the question wasn’t directed at him, so he didn’t answer. Instead, he just held on to her as her breaths calmed slowly. Eventually, she pulled back taking a deep breath and smiling that familiar smile that made John feel much more loved and welcome in a house even in where he had no family ties.
Sherlock nodded slowly, his chin rubbing gently against John’s short soft hair. “Okay... okay. Thank you”
It was now the very first day of winter break and Greg and Molly had both left to their respective homes that afternoon. John and Sherlock found themselves alone in an almost completely deserted castle.
“Hey, John!” Mary called out “So nice to see you again!”
Suddenly his good mood shattered as he thought back to what he’d said last and a realization hit him, a sinking feeling in his gut. Oh no…I said
“What?” John turned to him wide-eyed and confused. “Why?”
The Gryffindor barely had the chance to hear the soft whisper of “John,” from Sherlock’s lips before he pressed their lips together. They kissed, gently and determinedly, reassuring one another that they felt the same as their lips slid together in tandem. John could dimly hear the enthusiastic response around them, catcalls and clapping and suddenly Irene’s booming voice from the speaker echoed loudly through the outdoor stadium. But he paid no attention to them as he got lost in the sweet taste of Sherlock, and the feeling of his warm tongue against his own.
“You miss it” Sherlock stated, not missing a beat
Sherlock looked at John thoughtfully. “I… hadn’t really thought about it. Why?”
John’s own breath hitched as he opened his mouth to answer, but nothing came out. He settled with a nod. Sherlock nodded back and proceeded to walk around the room, inspecting the plants. John watched him go for a moment, shaking himself out of his temporary trance. What was going ON with him?
The last note, high and hopeful rang out in his ears. And although he could not recall any single note of the long and soft melody he had just played the look on John’s face made him feel as if he’s brought down the moon itself only for him.
They were… just shagging. Nothing more.
“Y-You can’t! You’ll get expelled or something! You don’t mean it!”
The sorting ceremony progressed as it did each year.  The sorting hat sang a song and the very frightened pack of first years began shuffling one by one to the very centre of the stage-like platform to try on the hat and test their luck with the houses.
Sherlock berated himself.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, smiling back. “Well, we’ll just have to wait and see which team wins.”
Molly gasped “So it’s true!” she whispered urgently to Greg and John
John walked with the crowd of kids surrounding him, all wearing black robes down to their ankles and anxious expressions on their faces. John was so afraid. More than he could remember being in a long time. He was alone. No Sherlock to be a comforting presence beside him. No Sherlock to walk down and through those massive wooden gates with. No Sherlock to remind him that he was a part of this world too. Somehow. Miraculously.
Their lips moved tenderly against each other, quietly assuring each other that
“Well you probably weren’t very good then” Sherlock smirked
“Not potions. Just regular old medicine. What’s your potion for, anyway?” John tried to come closer but the fumes coming out of the small black pot were rather unpleasant and he instantly recoiled. “Eurgh! Sherlock! Seriously, what the hell is that?”
“I’m right here mate. Don’t worry, you’re okay. you just passed out” he smiled as Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open delicately and looked completely and utterly confused. A rare look to catch in Sherlock’s expression. He liked when Sherlock looked like this, unreserved and soft.

He would… but Sherlock just couldn’t figure out how to just tell John he had been helping Irene retrieve some compromising photographs of her and Mary (incidentally John’s ex-girlfriend) from the Slytherin Sebastian Moran (who had taken them from Irene’s bag to get back at her for stealing his own...sensitive photographs with that other kid Jim Mori-something) without John asking why he was helping her so willingly. As usually there was a case or some sort of experiment behind Sherlock's reason for help, with the exception of when the one in need of help was John. And Sherlock knew that under the pressure of those damn blue eyes John had he would break and tell him the truth. That he helped Irene to stop her telling him Sherlock was being affected by… Sentiment.
Sherlock put his cup down on the small table beside him “No. My father left us when I was a child. He had been having an affair for all my life and most of my elder brother’s. When his mistress became pregnant he left us for the new family”
John’s lips tightened “I’m sorry, love. I didn’t mean to upset you. We’ll figure this out. I don’t want you to lose your mother over this… I know how important she is to you. But Sherlock. I won't let him get away with this. I don’t know how... but we WILL get your mother away from that man.”
“Of course we have 'houses', John. They’re Bellefeuille, Papillonlisse, and Ombrelune. I'm in the Ombrelune house, the one most similar to a combination of Ravenclaw and Slytherin from Hogwarts. They value knowledge, intellect and cunning more than anything. Our teams correspond to the houses. I play the seeker of course. You, however, play Chaser if I’m not mistaken.”
He’d, of course, seen John naked before. But seeing his from a distance lit up by artificial white lights and a room full of students was entirely different to seeing him like this, only lit by the dim moonlight, panting, pressed close against him, hard cock dragging wetly against his own in enticing bursts of sizzling pleasure.
“I’d love to come over”, John replied with a knowing smile, tracing his index finger over the top of Sherlock’s resting hand on the table suggestively.
Back in his house, he had tried as best as he could not to made any more paintings of him, not that it had worked. He spent most of the weekend begrudgingly painting and brooding in between debating whether he should text him or not. But images of the blonde and the woman haunted him. He knew that the odds were that he was… with her. He tried not to think about that. He had expected not to hear from him all weekend long, suspecting he would like to spend the entire weekend by her side. But then today… John texted.
How could he have not seen what he felt for Sherlock all along? For how
Sherlock was silent for approximately 3 seconds before he growled in annoyance. “Ughhhh Joooohn!”
They turned around and saw Molly accompanied by Mike and Sally, who Sherlock was pleased to see had finally dumped Anderson to date a much nicer boy. They were all, predictably, completely unsurprised to see him holding John’s hand.
In the midst of this, they drank wine and chatted and John held him close the whole night, either holding his hand and squeezing reassuringly or keeping an arm safely around his waist. All night he introduced himself to everyone as his boyfriend and was consistently charming and charismatic. Sherlock couldn’t take his eyes off of him.
Trelawney stepped closer to Sherlock and leant in to watch the mist on his globe. “Oh, my! Oh, my goodness… my dear!”
It had been a strange feeling receiving his wand. The elderly man that owned the shop (Ollivander, John presumed) had taken a single look at him and rummaged through one of the top shelves behind his desk before handing him the caramel coloured wand. It had intricate patterns at the handle and a dent that was made as if by design to John’s hand. Well, the size was a tiny bit larger but he could tell that with the passing of the years his thumb would mould perfectly.
A lot of the models surveyed the drawings during their breaks, something Sherlock usually did not even think about twice. But for some reason, he found John’s clear admiration towards the talent of his students very endearing to watch. The sudden urge to show John his own drawings was suddenly completely overpowering. He turned his back to them, trying to block them out again and shaking the ridiculous thought from his mind.
“No no it definitely is.”
“You love it”
“Mycroft ith buying hith thingth for school.” Sherlock shrugged.
“Sherlock” louder this time
Eventually, John got his balance back and he tentatively skated over to Sherlock, who was already spinning around and doing small elaborate jumps. “Show off!” John teased. “Where’d you learn that anyway?”
Taking a deep breath (and before he could think too much about it) he scrolled down his contact list until he found John’s number. He had found it on the model’s agency website... hopefully, John wouldn’t find that too creepy. Then again, he already knew that Sherlock knew where he lived so he guessed knowing his phone number was at least a little bit less intrusive.
John thought, smiling.
“Hey, Molly! Glad to see you again” she grinned “I heard about your scholarship raise. Well done, you deserve it”
“Oh? Sounds promising,” John smiled at him over his scarf, his words slightly muffled and wafting a light mist into the chilly wind.
Sherlock nodded, shivering and giving in to closing his eyes. His hands tugged again at John’s hair desperately, urging him silently to do it again. John did not hesitate to nudge at the sensitive nub again, prompting low groans from the artist, his inky curls sticking to his forehead with sweat and his mouth opening with a silent scream. The blonde didn’t resume his attention to the artist’s cock, knowing Sherlock would not last very long if he did, especially if he was reacting this strongly to solely the preparation. He worked from two fingers onto three into Sherlock with infinite patience, relishing in every reaction from the artist’s inexperienced sensitive body.
John smiled “I’m just teasing, you’re actually a really good player… I’m just the best”
“You alright?”
. Although maybe not as much as
Sherlock face-palmed a few feet away.
“So you can move in here? I mean… I understand if… there
Sherlock didn’t even bother looking up. He knew it wasn’t John.
“Wait- okay? So you’ll stay with me?” John sounded so hopeful, so disbelieving. Sherlock simply had to look up and see all the doubt and hesitation, the anticipation and beginnings of delight forming. He nodded again, more confident this time.
John had to change poses so Sherlock wasn’t able to draw his face directed solely at him again. But he was happy to draw every bit of John he could see for the rest of the class, already planning many more paintings he could do with them. If he wasn’t careful his next gallery would be all John paintings. Well, that didn’t sound so back when he thought about it.
Sherlock, not knowing how to respond just nodded, a little dumbstruck by John’s easy demeanour and lack of offence.
“Fine. Yes. I like him. Happy?”
Thank you so much for reading and following this story with me so far <3<3<3
He had kissed Sherlock.
John kissed Sherlock’s forehead gently “I would love to move in. But don’t think we’ll be needing two bedrooms, love” he teased, nudging at Sherlock’s face to reach his lips.
“Guys! How’s everything?”
John groaned and threw his head back against the cushions. “I know... how, though? How do I talk to him?”
He paused as he took in the fact that the room was deadly silent.
“Welcome to Divination! Take a seat! I reserved this empty chair just for you, my dear! Saturn warned me of your unexpected coming!” she exclaimed in her sing-song voice whilst motioning him to the chair with her wiry long and heavily ringed fingers.
Yaay! John has magic I bet NO ONE saw that coming! haha So everything will be just perfect!
“And you should never ever put them in a cage, they can contract all sorts of diseases! But you should under no circumstances leave them alone outside either because their bright colors can attract predators, and trust me: once a Pygmy Puff starts running it won’t stop for even treats! I mean one time I had my little Bluebell and… John?”
John laughed. Because perhaps it didn’t. Perhaps John really
John frowned “Develop? What are you talking about?”. He felt nervous all of a sudden.
“What-? Oh er… yeah. I umm… Sorry Molly, I got a little distracted”
John didn’t know about the crush, however, as Sherlock had done his best during the 3 years that had passed since that day to stop John from noticing his feelings. He was determined to not ruin the friendship they had formed.
The anxiety of not seeing John again had made Sherlock cling to him tightly, desperately. He silently begged John not to leave. Not to see her again. To stay with him always. But he didn’t voice anything, knowing exactly what John’s response would be, and scared to see the disappointment in his eyes and to hear the heartbreaking words leave those rosy lips.
Sherlock scurried into the kitchen, feeling nervous again. He knew he had to bring it up but how? Everything was going so well, clearly, they had moved past it but Sherlock didn’t want to. If anything this might just grow to become a larger problem in the future and he couldn’t lose John. But if he had to lose him… maybe it was best that it was now before Sherlock grew completely attached to the man.
*hides* this is SO late. Again. Welp... I have no excuses. Other than I binge watched sense 8 and it's great you should see it. Ok. Here's the new chapter.
John picked up a new parchment and started a new letter
“Brilliant” whispered John.
“No, right sorry.. sorry. Yes. I’ll uh- I'll take this please.” John stuttered out, quickly letting go of Sherlock as the latter did the same and he reached for the first thing his eye caught, which happened to be a dungbomb.
The artist bit his lip, cautious but needing to see John and texted back
Sherlock still became lightheaded when he remembered the brilliant smile that John had shot in his direction, followed by a small wink and Sherlock was still surprised he hadn’t needed to go to the hospital wing from a heart attack.
John smiled at the enthusiasm. Who knows, maybe Trelawney could tell him what the hell he should do next.
John snapped his gaze back to Sherlock, eyes wide and guilty for having been caught. “Oh hey! I was just umm… I know you said.. but I was- I’m so“
Sherlock hummed, unsure. He walked over to John, placing his hand in the crook of his elbow and pulling it up gently. John’s breath hitched almost imperceptible, certainly inaudible to anyone that wasn’t Sherlock. Now that he had had a touch of John he felt unable to stop himself from getting more. He rose his hand, lightly and deliberately touching along the length of the man's arm. He could feel those deep midnight eyes watching him. He breathed out shakily and his hand travelled up his shoulder and onto John’s other arm which was curled above his head with his elbow pulled up, and straightened it tenderly.
Sherlock shook himself out of his trance “John Watson?” he asked
“Brilliant! What is it? Where is it? Is it higher than a 6? No matter. Just tell me the details.”
“That’s not fair!” Sherlock bellowed, eyes wild and hair damp and sticking out in all directions. He coursed his fingers through it, frustrated, but only managed to make it look more like it belonged to a crazed scientist.
Any day now he would get magic.
“Anyway… she said Clara finally left her. I guess 10 years of living with someone who does not want to be helped and equally does not try for herself will do that. She called to say she’s going to rehab to get her act together. That this time it’s different. But I’ve heard this all before. I don’t know what to believe”
“John…” Sherlock whispered. He stared at him, silently asking, begging for a kiss without the courage of asking for one. He licked his lips, his breath hitching as he watched John observe the path of his tongue across his bottom pouting lip and bite his own in response.
“Oh John... hehe You have a way with- hahah- words and a way with- pffff-- modelling and much hahah- much more. But John.” he cradled the blonde’s face in between his hands as they grinned stupidly at each other “You can’t draw” he giggled, his nose scrunching up with the peals of joyous laughter.
“Holmes?! He won’t smell a thing! That freak doesn’t have a heart! He can't feel attraction or love!!” Anderson Whispered not so quietly into Sally’s ear.
“It means that whenever the police are out of their depth I help them. Which is pretty often, to be honest. And to answer your previous question I knew because they suspected him due to his PTSD and habit of having nightmares related to his time in the war. He had been going to therapy for a couple of years but it had not seemed to help and thus they pinned it on him.” Sherlock took a deep breath and went on, the speed of his speech doubling but each word still perfectly enunciated.
“Amazing” John was still shaking his head in awed disbelief when Sherlock turned to look at him. He swallowed; his thoughts which had been crystal clear suddenly clouding and leaving nothing but the expression of John’s face and the sparkle in his eyes.
Sherringford. And he knew very well that Sherlock hated him too. John was sure that the few instances he’d seen of the verbal and almost physical abuse he’d inflicted on his family had not been rare occurrences. And he was sure that his young mind had most likely not even processed a lot more occasions where he had been the bastard he is. He couldn’t even start to imagine how Sherlock must be feeling about this. About the man who was solely responsible for his not going to Hogwarts, the place he had dreamed of for all his life, and what’s more, for his mother’s suffering.  “I’m so sorry… there must be something we can do. Or Mycroft. Maybe we can talk her out of it”
(See the end of the chapter for
John stance tensed even more. His eyes shifted to his scar.
“Well... I don’t know where I stand with him either! We had a great time yesterday but… maybe he was just being nice. I mean he stopped writing for a reason, right? He didn’t want to keep in touch. Why should that change now?”
” his jaw tightened again at the memory, Sherlock watched the muscles contract at the edge of his throat closely. “He clearly wanted nothing more than to have you all for himself. Well now that’s just..” he frowned deeply again, seeming torn between needing to express a claim on Sherlock and keep his temper under control.
“Thank you,” John smiled and patted the owl softly on the head. Gladstone hooted quietly and zoomed back to his spot above John’s bed.
“Okay, enough chit-chat now” Sherlock stood from behind his desk. “To work now. We’re 20 minutes behind schedule so I expect you all to make up for it with energy and good drawings. Gestures poses. Go.”
He barely heard Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath before he blindingly closed the distance between them and pressed his lips against Sherlock’s and they were kissing fiercely. John’s heart was bursting. He didn’t know how to feel. On one hand, he felt furious for the way Sherrinford had continued to treat his family all those years, it was
“Oh, Sherlock... I’m so sorry” John’s brow furrowed in sadness. He imagined Sherlock as a kid, all bouncing dark curls and big icy eyes, abandoned by his father. He felt the urge to take Sherlock into his arms, hug him and never let go.
She clicked her tongue, dropping the subject but sending him a sly wink anyway. A sharp memory of himself doing the same to John on his last class here rose in Sherlock’s memory.
“Yeah. He’s a Beauxbaton now. We talked yesterday and I thought… I dunno. I thought everything would go back to the way it was.”
Sherlock was pacing rapidly around the room, while John sat on his chair reading the paper. Even after months of living together Sherlock marveled at the fact that it was now ‘John’s’. If he was being honest, though, it had been from the moment John had walked into the flat months and months ago that first time, really.
He turned to Sherlock, meaning to express some of these things and perhaps broach the subject on what they should refer to each other as when Sherlock suddenly stopped short and started jumping in excitement.
“You’re going to break something” John snorted, standing up from the bed and looking around the room. “Wow. We made a mess”.
“The... fumes of the explosion might have made them…. Enlarge dramatically. Their size could not be decreased with magic. ‘The Department of Magical accident and catastrophes’ tried. Several times. But in my defence how could I have expected my formula would be successful to THAT degree?”
John turned quickly, startled. Sherlock was suddenly walking beside him, nose still buried in his book. “What do you say that?” asked John, grinning.
he thought to himself, knowing that there was no way Sherlock could possibly be attracted to him but still liking the pretty pink blush that had covered Sherlock’s cheeks after being caught staring. Wiping the smugness off of his face the moment Sherlock began lifting his head again, John took a deep breath. Christ Sherlock was
The evening had progressed without a hitch. Sherlock had ignored Lestrade’s texts about coming down to the Yard to fill in witness reports and he and John had simply talked. Sherlock could see John’s eyes flicker every now and then towards his studio but he resolved not to ruin this sooner than he had to. John deserved to see his paintings. They
Sherlock felt Johns eyes boring into his, recreating their small moment on the icy lake. And once again… right on cue John’s gaze slowly drifted down until it stuck to Sherlock’s rosy lips. The latter licked them instinctively, relishing in the slight gasp that rushed out from John’s parted mouth. Sherlock’s own gaze was drawn down then, unable to stop the slight tilt of his head as watched John’s tongue trace his lower lip tantalisingly slowly. He looked back up at the blond’s eyes, silently asking… letting himself hope for just a moment. His heart thudded faster than he thought possible, his throat closed up with a rush of nerves and emotion. And want. So much want.
“Stopped the bludger. Got yourself hurt.”
So far John’s favourite shops had been “Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes”, where he’d seen what he believed to be a miniature dragon making the popcorn they sold, and “Quality Quidditch Supplies”. In the latter, Sherlock had rambled about Quidditch as soon as John brought it up, hands moving frantically as he explained the rules and the different balls and brooms and teams. John instantly wanted to play it, impossible as it seemed.
Panic rose up hot and sharp in Sherlock’s chest. He could picture the way he had left his studio perfectly this morning. Three finished paintings of John Watson decorated the walls. And a fourth one sat almost finished on his easel.
-extensive military experience
then I wouldn't have dared settle!” his words became harsher and angrier. John felt something ugly and hot stir inside of him. Words directed at such a kindhearted wonderful woman, who basically raised both boys on her own. Who opened up her arms to John into her life even when she owed him nothing. And to say that about Sherlock… he who was anything BUT incompetent. Who wanted magic above all else in all this world. How dare he speak about his own son like that? About either of them like that?
disastrous effects). She had sat him down and even made an effort not to laugh as she repaired all the bald spots and uneven cuts Sherlock had done while said boy sulked in the background and John giggled in delight. John’s clothes had also miraculously grown to his own size overnight, something he was sure Eliza did while he was sleeping so he would be more comfortable in them.
Sherlock frowned, Trelawney was making a prediction and it
“Well, we got him about a year ago. When we weren’t... well.”
The next thing he knew, he had been carrying a half-conscious complaining second year Ravenclaw to the hospital wing part-concerned and part-amused as the poor boy mumbled deductions about John’s shoes. They had been inseparable since.
“Visit for the summer!?” he cried
The moment John walked into the classroom Sherlock grinned up at him as brightly as he could manage, knowing John liked it when he smiled and forcing himself not to think about what the man had been up to that weekend. The blonde beamed back, seeming pleased at the fact that Sherlock was happy to see him. He looked well rested, the artist noted, so no late nights in the past few days. He looked over his figure as it walked over to the changing screen but could not deduce anything out of the ordinary. The urge to go kiss him was almost impossible to resist.
John shifted closer to Sherlock, he watched him with a serious expression for a couple of moments before he muttered, “Siblings really suck”. That got a surprised chuckle out of the artist.
The thought had crossed John’s mind in a loop for at least the last 20 minutes as the cab carried him further and further away from Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks as both girls almost fell on top of him. He looked up just in time to see the snitch fluttering frenziedly beside his neck and he clutched at it, holding it tight in his fist. As he heard the high-pitched whistle sound, one of Soo Lin’s legs accidentally kicked him and he lost balance.
? It wasn’t his fault! And in the blink of an eye, John had been thrust onto his first year at Hogwarts without his friend… without even a word from him. And the silence had persisted for years. Up till now, it seemed. How was John guilty in all of this? Why did he deserve to be treated like this by a boy he’d cared for and stood by all those years?
John smiled, thinking about finally getting to play Quidditch against Sherlock in a more serious setting. He and Sherlock had kept on playing each other every single Friday after class, though lately, John had found it a lot more entertaining to tease Sherlock during it rather than playing just to watch him blush prettily.
Carefully he circled the platform, surveyed the model from every angle until he knew exactly what he wanted for the first pose of the day. “Go down on one knee please, John”
He accompanied Irene to the small booth for the commentator and sat down next to her to wait for the game to start, ignoring the fact that he was technically sitting in the Slytherin booth a couple of rows in front of Anderson and Sally who were talking loudly about the inefficiency of the Gryffindor team to anyone who would listen. But suddenly he didn’t feel at ease, like he belonged, like he usually did at John’s games (the only Quidditch matches he would bother attending. If he attended any others he was dragged by John and he deleted them later anyway).
.’ he thought to himself.  His skin was still fairly tan, so he clearly had returned from action not too long ago, and his golden hair was bleached from the sun. Sherlock calculated him between 24 and 25 years of age. John Watson did not seem to notice the fact that everyone was staring at him in utter awe. The man was truly beautiful.
“YOU INSOLENT LITTLE-”
“Never trutht a yellow floured bean, John. Everyone knowth that”
As Sherlock drew he did not even focus on getting John’s figure or exact look right, he just… drew and John ended up perfectly situated on the page. He drew and drew and before he knew it Sherlock Holmes was at his studio desk, fast asleep, the woman in the painting he had not been able to finish that morning staring at him with a knowing smirk.
John had asked her out. John had asked her for her number.
John wasn’t watching the entrance when the last few students strode in. John wasn’t watching when one of them, a young boy with curly brown hair and icy eyes stood under the massive wooden gates for a moment, wearing under his light blue robe the same shade of vest a white dress shirt and perfectly tailored trousers. John wasn’t watching when one of his teachers rushed the boy inside when he had stopped to stare at the hall in absolute awestruck wonder.
“The artist Mr. Holmes I suppose?” a low voice behind him asked
Sherlock quickly typed
“How could I regret you kissing me? When…” Sherlock had closed his eyes once again and rested his forehead against John’s. “When I cannot think of anything else anymore?”
“oh”, John loosened his hold on him, not wanting to pressure Sherlock into anything he wasn’t ready for. How had this gorgeous man never even kissed another pair of lips in his life? Some animal instinct just made John want to hold him tighter, claim Sherlock as his own. Here was his own blank canvas for him to claim and possess for himself and himself solely. But he couldn’t think like that. If Sherlock hadn’t done anything with anyone ever, John wouldn’t be one to pressure him to do so this fast.
John bit his lip, still staring at the owl. “I don’t… I don’t know.”
He rose rapidly from his chair, almost knocking it over in the process. It was like a veil had been uncovered from Sherlock’s eyes and now he could see him painting exactly as it was and exactly as it should be. Everything was so clear. He walked rapidly towards his easel and his painting materials and set to work, uncapping the paints he would need and making sure he had every paintbrush he would utilise as well as a rag to clean them on and a good amount of turpenoid.
“Excuse me” a familiar voice now resounded right behind Sherlock, instantly calming his boiling blood and angry words rising in his throat. “I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m John, the model in the paintings. Sherlock’s
“Heh…. I guess so” John smiled. Sherlock smiled hesitantly back, wanting things to be okay between them. What had gone wrong in the last 12 hours since they’d spoken? Granted, he hadn’t actually
John hummed “She’s a good model then? Pretty?” he couldn’t help the slight pang of jealousy he felt knowing someone else had been posing naked in front of Sherlock just hours before. Knowing Sherlock had been observing her closely with those unnatural icy eyes and mirroring her exact image carefully onto the paper before him, capturing a piece of her and keeping it with him. He bit the inside of his cheek, trying not to grit his jaw. After all, he still wasn’t sure what Sherlock thought about their kiss or whether he should bring it up and apologize or not.
Walking around the room, John realised how freaky the greenhouse really was. A couple of pots with ‘screechsnaps’ was squirming around humming softly as if singing themselves a lullaby. Right next to that there was a giant plant that with closer observation John was quite sure was covered in… teeth? He steered clear out of that one.
John was even more excited than Sherlock to be here, dressed to the nines in a grey suit and blue shirt and tie, his suit had been tailored by Sherlock’s own personal tailor, and with his hair pushed back into a classy swoop. The artist’s heart had skipped a beat at the first sight of him. John had absolutely insisted they stay for the interviews, knowing the more media attention on Sherlock’s work, the more opportunities he could have in the future for solo galleries. Sherlock begrudgingly complied. Where was he anyway?
