He can feel the wall once it crumbles, and realizes Lucifer really had been blocking him before. The last resistance crumbles, and Sam can feel everything. He searches through Lucifer's mind, feels his enthusiasm as God announces to the Heavenly Host the need for the true vessels. Can see Lucifer helping to create him, offering God suggestions as Michael leans over his shoulder cracking jokes- and apparently, his long hair was an idea of Michael's- and slapping Michael's hand away, laughing as they create Sam together. He feels the rejection and abandonment of the Fall, and collapses back onto the bed with the pain or Lucifer's suffering. Sam had never stopped to consider how much it would have hurt, to be cast out by his brother. The pain sends him reeling, and he feels Lucifer stop and try to awkwardly fast-forward his own memories.
"Sam, please stop trying to pull that out. It's helping you breathe." He takes Sam's hand gently in his own, smoothing fingertips over it. "I am so glad you're awake." He breathes out a choking laugh, that gets caught somewhere around a sob and bursts out so he's laughing and crying at the same time. "I didn't know- I tried to be optimistic, but nobody knew if you would wake up again or not."
Dean's pretending to be working on homework, but secretly he's watching Cas. He likes to do that a lot.
"Yes, this again. Until he's a fully-fledged adult, this is a very big concern." His mouth is saying the words, but he's still staring at Sam.
"This is the entire temple. I dug up under the entire thing, and yet there's nothing here. No sign of Gabriel, no sign of a Greek god, no sign of- of anything!"
He navigates to his budget, and slowly and painstakingly walks them through the process of moving out. Then he explains the added cost of a baby, and why Becky and Mary would caution against having a baby yet. Both boys are paying attention and not fighting with him. Better yet, Cas isn't crying either.
Lucifer lunges forward in an attempt to break Sam's grip and attack. Miraculously Sam restrains him. He's so distracted with Lucifer he misses Gabriel stalking by then both with fire in his eyes. Fortunately Cas is more alert and grabs Gabriel, twisting both arms behind his back to hold him.
"Lucifer, Sam, I know you're out there!" One of the angels calls tauntingly. "I could hear you discussing the use of the sigils." Lucifer and Sam exchange a glance. Sam waggles his fingers questioningly, silently asking if he can use his hellfire for this one. Lucifer shrugs, then nods. Sam closes his eyes and concentrates, then allows his hellfire to come up. It licks along his fingers joyously, then launches from his fingertips toward the angels. 'Don't hurt them!' Sam thinks, and it doesn't, it simply wraps its way around where they're standing like a circle of holy oil. The angel who was taunting them glares as they approach. "You will be lucky if you avoid being thrown back in your Cage for this, Lucifer. Of all the arrogance- to do this when Michael specifically asked you not to reeks of pride. You truly believe you'll succeed where the best warriors have failed?"
He leads the distressed Omega into the bathroom, coaxing him into taking off his clothes. Sam is shaking hard enough it's evident he's not going to be able to wash himself, so Cas undresses with him and crawls into the shower with him, helping to bathe him. He keeps up a running litany of reassurances, calming Sam slowly.
"That's impossible, we were dancing together and I was with him and my drink both here at the table before that! He had no capability of putting that drug in my drink without me noticing!"
Once he and Lucifer had had their talk at the restaurant, Sam left Jess know the next day that he had been leading her on and apologized wholeheartedly. She had slapped him, froze him out for the weekend, and when they were back in school Tuesday she gave him a hug and said she was sorry for slapping him. From that moment on, they were friends again. Which led to him being in a club for Jess' eighteenth birthday. (Apparently, she knew the owner, and the owner knew her parents, so she and Sam were allowed in though they were underage. Sam was pretty sure that was illegal.)
"I'll never admit it." She watches her son and Sam play together in the water. "How's he taking it?"
"I'm thirteen, Michael." Michael wallops him with the pillow, then falls asleep to the sound of his brother's giggles.
"I didn't. You stabbed yourself then slipped back into your own body. By the way, we typically recommend that if you're going to abandon the person you're possessing, you shouldn't stab the body you're going to go into first. You nearly died."
"You were right about that part," Dean says, standing up and crossing over to Cas to take his hand. He turns back to Lucifer, sitting on the ground and yanking Cas into his lap. "For days Sam was inside his own mind, locked away. When he woke up, he swore he was fine. We went after Cas. But he lied. Bobby and I didn't realize it at first. We didn't realize anything was wrong until we chained Death and he told us that Sam had been struggling with his Hell memories. He had hallucinations. They got worse. He was unable to differentiate between reality and Hell, and then you came."
"Moose, you're not supposed to gulp that!" Crowley mock-scolds, sounding scandalized. "Where is your sense of refinery?"
A deep chuckle sounds from behind him, but Lucifer doesn't say anything else to tease him. He tightens his arms against Sam, enjoying the warmth and strength of the hunter in front of him. Neither man says anything, feeling that words will break the surreal spell that seems to surround them both. Sam's fingers play across the back of Lucifer's hands, drawing burning patterns with his body heat.
"Shut up," Sam chastises, but it lacks all heat. He paces away from Lucifer, staring around the Cage for a moment. Then he yells, "Oh my God, Gabriel!" and takes off, Lucifer directly on his heels.
John walks by, smacking Cas on the back. "Good to see you again, Castiel. Sam, when you get a moment I'd like to speak to you and your brother in private. Tomorrow, though, not today. I have something important to do now." He approaches Mary, holding one hand out to her. "Will you come with me? I would like to tell you several things."
Dean rushes back in, thrusting a bagel and coffee into Cas' unsuspecting hands. "C'mon, let's go!" He grabs Cas' arm and proceeds to drag him out the door.
Crowley's pulled away, and Azazel is thrusting the sword so it nearly beheads Sam. He ducks, and steps in so he's knocking Azazel down.
Cas nods and walks out, feeling like he's in a fog. He delivers the message to Dr. Blake, calls overhead for assistance from labor and delivery, and heads off to the ER department. People are busy everywhere, because more and more victims of the shooting are being brought in. Students everywhere are sobbing, and Cas can't recognize the words many of them are saying. It was Balthazar's class, he realizes that now. But there's no time to panic now, people need him.
"Listen, stop by Thursday in time for supper, yeah? We'll make a meal, catch up... then your parents can take off. Samandriel put that down! Do not put that in your mouth! Gotta go Sammy, good talking to you. Samandriel! What did Daddy say?" The phone clicks off.
"And the most humble," quips Sam. "You don't stare at guys when they get out of the shower, it's just weird."
Sam has always been too smart for his own good, so the second he walks away he asks, "Michael, why did you tell that man to ask me if there's anything he could do to make that flirty waitress situation okay?"
Michael talks over him as though he doesn't even hear him. "We left him at the grocery store! I got the whole way home before I realized it! I abandoned my baby brother in a grocery store at two years old. Anything could have happened! And then one time, I left Gabe play with knives- well, I didn't leave him, leave him, but he picked up a knife and I didn't realize it, and he split his face and now he has a small scar on his chin because I couldn't watch him well enough! That's neglect!" Michael barrels on, waving his hands and gesticulating wildly as he talks faster and faster. "You fell out of a tree when I was babysitting and broke your collarbone, Balthazar nearly drowned in the pool, and Uriel almost got hit by a car! I almost killed all of my siblings! And now Anna tells me she's pregnant, but she doesn't know I'm going to accidentally kill the baby!"
"Guys no!" Cas protests. "You shouldn't be losing income to attend the family dinner. We'll just hold off announcing until you guys get there."
"You realize they kidnapped my wife too, right? Of course I'm going to help. Plus, it'll give Sam and I a chance to work together on his demon power stuff. He's been refusing Crowley, so with any luck I'll be able to guide him instead."
"I heard you two last night. I'm so glad Sam feels that way about Luc. I was starting to think he would never think of Luc with a romantic filter."
"Get up, Jerk. Your future husband is looking for you two, and it's breakfast time. And people are supposed to be arriving soon. Get up!"
"As alright as we can be," he answers honestly. "Haven't seen everyone for a while, it's a little awkward. Only reunited for a wedding."
"Awww," Sam pouts. He's dripping green down his hair, making fancy patterns on Lucifer's khaki pants. There's no saving them now. Sam turns to Lucifer, reaching out to take the devil's hand and smearing him with more green. "Help me get him back?"
Dean pulls his chair to the bed and settles in. Michael exchanges a look with Cas, but he already knows Dean won't leave even if he suggests it. Instead, he pulls his own chair close to Dean and tugs at his fiance's hand until he has his fingers wrapped around him.
Azazel huffs out an angry sound, but he walks out of his room. Within seconds he's back, Crowley and Rowena behind him.
Intaosseous IVs: literally an IV straight into the bone, only used in emergency situations, and even then not very frequently
Cas hurries down the hall, hoping he can get Jack before he wakes Claire. He pushes open the door, only to freeze when he notices a dark figure standing in the room, already lifting Jack out of the crib. "DEAN!" he yells, rushing forward to throw the stranger back, away from his baby.
"I just- I need a minute." Thus saying, he takes off up the stairs to his own room. He's literally shaking, nerves and emotions too much for him as he locks the door behind him. It's ridiculous that he's training to be a doctor but something like this can still reduce him to a wreck.
Cas nods, and Dean helps him drag the blankets up to his bed. They make a huge pile out of the blankets and cuddle beneath them, Dean's arms wrapped around Cas and holding him tight.
"Dean, Bobby's back!" he says, physically pushing his brother to Bobby. Dean hugs him distractedly. "Your future husband just punched mine!"
"I'll let you be the judge of that. If you pull your shirt up for me, Mr. Winchester, we'll get started."
Sam doesn't answer. He leads Gabriel outside to where the car is parked and the two men crawl inside. Sam reclines the driver's seat and turns until he's comfortable. "Night, Gabriel."
Cas' Mommy and Daddy don't come for him by supper, so he eats chicken nuggets and french fries with Dean. After dinner, Dean sits with his mommy and feels the baby kick while Clifford plays in the background. Cas normally likes Clifford, but today it makes him sad and he doesn't like it at all. Instead he feels the baby with Dean. He learns that babies can hear what you say when they're in a stomach, so Cas talks with Sam and Sam kicks his hand in response to say hello.
Sam grabs his phone and begins dialing. "Bobby, where's Crowley?" he asks sharply. "Because he's missing a demon meeting...Demon or not, I still want his opinion on stuff...Well then, wake Sleeping Beauty with a kiss, but tell him I'm starting in five minutes and he needs to be here." Sam clicks the phone off, then turns on an alarm. Then he sits at the conference table and props his feet on the table. He leans back so the chair is balancing on two legs, both hands folded behind his head.
"Yes. I want you, Gabriel. I want you too, Lucifer." Sam extends both arms, waiting. They don't let him wait long, reaching for him greedily, and Sam's eyes fall closed under their onslaught. Hands are everywhere-his back, his arms, his stomach, his hair. Sam can't figure out which hands belong to which angel...and then the kissing starts. One of them is at his back, mouthing at his neck, making Sam feel weak, and he nearly collapses, groaning into the mouth of whichever angel is in front of him. A finger snap, and they're on the bed.
Lucifer straightens and heals himself with his grace. "I deserved that," he realizes. Sam doesn't say anything, waiting tensely for retaliation. Nothing happens.
Sam should be sleeping, because he's expected to be conscious for Bobby, Balthazar, and Crowley's wedding tomorrow. But he's restless and a light sleeper to begin with, so when Gabriel leaves, he instantly snaps awake. And when he leaves the room, clearly not headed to the bathroom, it's not difficult for Sam to decide to follow him.
Sam pulls away, glancing at everyone suspiciously. "Balthazar and Crowley both said they weren't changing. I asked."
The trek through the airport is relatively easy, because Cas puts on his 'I'm an adorable child' face and asks the closest friendly looking person for help because he and his boyfriend are trying to get to Massachusetts. The woman takes pity on them and guides them through the airport like they're her own children. She drops them at their gate and gives them strict instructions to stay there until the flight boards, and to keep their bags with them at all times.
"What do you think?" Cas asks, coming out of the dressing room. Sam blinks at him, how did Cas manage to find a whole outfit while he's just stood there and watched Dean gawk at the store?
Sam doesn't respond, flopping back onto the blanket and relaxing in the sunshine. He lets out a contented sigh. "This is nice."
"I know, Sam, I know. He's under control now. He didn't realize you were following orders. He's retreated to Heaven, and he will not come after you again."
Someone's arms wrap around him and begin yanking, taking him away. Sam struggles in the person's grip, screaming and fighting. It's only when the person swears in his ear that he realizes the unknown assailant is John. He doesn't care, he's not sorry for hurting him. He was trying to take him away from Lucifer.
"Because I thought we were already married, so I didn't see a reason for it. But now that I realize we're not actually married, I'd like to remedy that. But if your don't want to get married, that's fine."
"Fine. It's mostly not my blood, I'm fine, I'm fine," Lucifer chants. "I thought I lost you. I thought you were gone. Mine," he mumbles again.
"What's going on? Why are we awake?" Lucifer grouses. His hair is still mussed and sticking up a variety of different directions thanks to Sam and Gabriel. He looks very nearly human, and Sam's heart gives a painful lurch in his chest as he reaches out to his fiance for comfort, stepping out of the small bathroom as he grabs for him.
Sam crawls onto the bed with Lucifer, body chasing the coolness of the other man. He snuggles into him, pressing his body to Lucifer's shirtless chest. His body shudders, and he drifts off immediately.
They meet in a sweet kiss, but before it can get too heavy Sam somehow wrangles free and ducks out the door. "Goodnight!"
The elevator opens like a shot and Sam flies out of it, nearly toppling Gabriel in his haste to leave. He finds their room and unlocks it, entering the room to toss his bag into it. Unlike the last room he and Dean stayed in, there is only one large bed, large enough for two- or perhaps even three. Sam shudders. He will be filching a key the second Baldur's back is turned. He pulls his new knife out of his pocket, ready to go hunting.
"Out for a walk. Couldn't sleep, so I just walked around for a while. Went to get a newspaper and look for jobs, the usual." He conveniently forgets to mention that he's been under the bed for probably the past four hours.
"I know! Dean and I talked to Michael and promised we wouldn't have sex." He gasps aloud. "I can't do this! I promised Mom and Mary and Michael we wouldn't! Call him back, tell him-" Whatever message Cas wants relayed is lost as he collapses screaming.
Lucifer is still awake, or perhaps just woke up, but he's talking with Azazel and Ruby quietly. Lilith doesn't seem to be nearby. Azazel catches Sam's eye and says something to Lucifer. Lucifer looks up and sees Sam, and the expression on his face is akin to a man witnessing a miracle.
Michael sighs. "Dean, please. I am trying to make this easy for you. I want your opinion on these things, because I feel they are important matters that a spouse should get input on. I would like a house, and I would very much like for you to like it, too."
"He didn't sleep well last night. He and Michael were kissing intensely for the majority of the night."
Lucifer stands nervously outside Michael's apartment, bouncing his suitcase off his knees alternatively. He's already knocked, and Michael and
"No I don't think I will. He's in agony right now and it's so glorious. And after all, possession is nine-tenths of the law, so I think he's mine." Sam pulls back his hands and releases the hellfire again.
"That was why I intended to kill the Winchesters in combat. They clearly have you under a spell of witchcraft."
Lucifer clearly misunderstands. "Why is that scary? Because if we debated over anything, you know I'd win?"
"And Dean Michael Winchester, do you take Castiel James Novak as your lawfully wedded husband, in r-"
Cas runs off. He hardly remembers to knock on the door, except Dr. Prescott catches him by his scrub jacket and hauls him back. "Ah right," Cas breathes softly. "Drs. Prescott and Winchester," he yells as he runs in.
Lucifer shakes his head in denial. "Sam was cured of the demon blood and its subsequent addiction years ago. His blood is normal human blood."
"Well, Gabe is planning to start a bakery. He's actually looking into getting a business on the main street of town here."
Cas shakes his head no. Dean wants to eat here; Cas will eat here if it kills him. He's sure that walking the campus and learning about the medical program wasn't enjoyable for Dean, and this is how he will repay him.
He can tell instantly when Phobos is back in control. The hand holding him turns heavy, fingers digging into his skin. There's another punch landed to his face, and Sam falls yet again. A foot comes back and stomps on his leg, and Sam feels the bone break. Lucifer is totally going to have to heal him after this.
Gabriel laughs, loud in the quiet following Lucifer's outburst. "He does like you! Anyone else he would incinerate for that."
Lucifer's hand traces his arm, and tiny gashes that Sam hadn't noticed begin to mend. "I thought you weren't coming back," Lucifer tells him.
Fine. If Michael won't help him, Sam will be sure that his idea to rescue people from Hell gets through with the demons. He and Dean will do it when their dad dies. And if Dean won't help, Sam will go it alone.
"Castiel Winchester?" Cas bolts to his feet, nail ten saved for now. He follows the nurse back to an empty waiting room and waits for her to take his vitals and leave before nail ten meets its end.
"Who said anything about a child?" Dean asks, now thoroughly confused. He has no idea where his mom is going with this.
"Hey!" Sam thunders, entering the room. What he sees really confuses him. There's a guy that looks just like him, talking with Ruby while leaning against a wall.  He looks relaxed, she looks tense.
"Hunting," Sam says the word with all the exhaustion he feels. He pulls back to look at the woman holding him. "I couldn't have!" At her skeptical look, he argues, "Don't give me that look! You were innocent, Jess! How would you have responded to knowing that there were monsters in this world, that everything in your worst nightmares is true? I thought I got out, thought I was safe and never going back!" His voice trails off. "That's why they killed you, you know. They needed me to return to it."
Mary gives him a hug. "I'm so glad to be here with you. Celebrating this special day!" She hugs Sam then too. "I heard you're getting married too!"
Gabriel and Lucifer are both slouched on separate couches, but like his presence has forced them to move they jump to their feet. "Sam, you came back," Gabriel states, sounding surprised.
Lucifer laughs then, head thrown back. "You keep trying to pick a fight, but I'm just glad that I don't have to keep hiding that you're my mate."
Dean runs into the room, growling ferociously as he confronts the intruder. Cas flips on the lights, and Dean's growl aborts with a startled, "Sammy?" falling from his lips instead.
"Sorry, Cas, your fiance calls. Um, good talk and all that." He smacks Cas on the back and literally runs off.
"Sam." Mary places her hand on the chair and spins him around so he's looking at her again. "What's going on? You and Lucifer used to be good friends."
"Maybe," Cas agrees. "How's my brother?" he questions a moment later, face breaking into an impish smile that would have been much more at home on Dean.
Gabriel let's out a loud war whoop when he sees Sam. "That's my boyfriend!" Then he launches into 'My Boyfriend's Back', which was probably never meant to be sang at the volume Gabriel is currently singing.
Lucifer obliges him, curling into bed with him. He wraps both arms around Sam's in a parody of a restraint, increasing their skin contact. "Aren't you tough men not supposed to admit that you enjoy cuddling?" Lucifer teases.
"So we keep saying," Dean remarks under his breath. He jerks his hand away from Michael so he can wave it. "I'm so sick of failing him, you know? I'm sick of it! I'm always, always, always failing to protect him. It was the one thing that was asked of me as a kid- 'take care of Sammy'. Ever since that fire that's all it's ever been, is 'take care of Sammy'. God knows Dad couldn't do it, it was always my responsibility. And I just keep failing him. Over and over and over- this shouldn't be happening. I should be the one seeing the crazy things, I'm the one that should have been possessed, and I'm not because I'm so wrapped up in my own life that I didn't even see Sammy was falling apart in front of my until it was too late."
Cas takes that as a cue to intervene, grabbing Dean and spinning him toward him. A low conversation follows.
A crash announces Dean's victory, but Sam didn't see how it happened thanks to Lucifer's yanking on him. Inias grabs his blade, says something with a smile to Dean, and exits.
"I'm just so angry all the time," Sam says, apropos of nothing. "I feel like I can't help it, and yet I also feel like I have no reason to feel this way."
There's one other patron in the building, and he swivels to stare at them as they walk in. Cas ignores him, yet he still presses closer to Dean.
Lucifer runs the entire length of the first floor while Sam throws his head back and screams with laughter. They run into the dining room together, and Gabriel magics the chair out for Lucifer to throw Sam into. "Still not a piggy back ride," Sam gasps, breathless, "but equally fun."
Lucifer grabs the cutters from Michael and deftly snips them, then attaches a new clasp so it will hold. "I'll solder this on, let me get it heated up quick." A few minutes later the new clasp is attached and soaked in water to cool it. Lucifer pats it dry then hands it to Michael.
Sam shoves past Dean, who holds the door open wider. "Well in that case, you might as well as come in," he offers magnanimously.
Sam looks between them both for a moment before a mischievous smirk crosses his face. "Catch me if you can," he taunts and he darts off, taking the stairs four at a time with his long legs. He pulls his shirt off mid-jump and throws it in Lucifer's face.
"I can't keep doing this: the torture, the hallucinations, I can't keep going. I'm so tired. I just need to rest."
"I'm not. For the record, I think you're right. Though I will be thrilled once Dean and Cas finally get married, and you say yes to me."
Sam's arm catches the demon and slams it into the ground. "Where are they? What have you done with them?" he demands.
Misha laughs, clears his throat, crosses over to Jensen and growls, "Hello, Dean," in Castiel's gravelly voice.
Sam winces. He catches sight of his phone as he glances down at the bed and recalls the chime that woke him. He checks his messages. He's got a video message from an unknown number, which he clicks on. The video begins to play. A few seconds later, Sam bolts from the bed. "Dean! Cas! Dean!" he shouts as he sprints out the door.
"Trying to fill out these college applications," Cas tells him, gesturing at the haphazard pile in front of him.
"I know. But Gabriel is insecure right now, he needs to know where he stands with you. He'd prefer to be your friend, if you'll let him."
Within a few minutes, Cas is holding the results in his shaking hands. "Negative. Oh thank you God, it's negative," he gasps, practically collapsing against the wall.
Sam staggers to his feet. It's hard to breathe. His ribs are probably broken. With that thought, he coughs blood. Yep. Definitely broken. Like Sam's going to be soon.
"Don't. Touch. My. Brother," Sam bites out as he drags Michael back a half step. Michael blasts him with grace and Sam goes flying, bouncing off the ceiling before he hits the ground.
'For that matter, my foot is probably broken too,' Sam thinks, and after a moment he collapses back to the ground again, his broken foot unable to hold him any longer.
John looks defeated. "I understand. But I am here to stay. I'll show you in time how sorry I am, even if it takes the rest of my life."
"Why did I have to grow up, Gabriel? I can tell you I was NOT thinking about this last year at this time," Sam says, laying back on the couch and propping a pillow beneath him.
"Yeah, he did. Years ago, before he realized nobody cares if he liked men instead of women. It's not like that for him now."
"She's not the only one who says it! A lot of the Alpha boys say it too, and if Dean gets into one more fight he's going to get expelled because he won't listen to me and just let it go!"
Sam grabs Lucifer as he releases his hand and hauls him in for a fierce consuming kiss. When he finally lets go, Lucifer mutters "Tease."
Gabriel vaults the back of the couch easily, especially considering his tiny stature. After he lands he turns to Sam with a preen, "Thank you, Sam."
"It will, but that's okay, Lucifer. The most important thing is that you try not to let it happen again, and that you be the best Alpha, and the best man, that you can be. Look out for Omegas. Protect them when they're unable to protect themselves, not because they're weaker but because you're capable. And learn to be a team. Find an Omega's strengths, and if they can't see them, call them out in them. An Omega who can't see their strengths is one that is more likely to be abused. What are Gabriel's strengths?"
"Positive. It won't last for long, and it'll knock Dean out for probably a day afterward, which will give us a bit of a headstart because Michael will want to be sure Dean is alright. You'll have to get us to safety, because I will also be unconscious. I'll cushion you the best I can as we fall, but there's no guarantees that you won't be hurt as well. But I can do it. It can work."
"No, we need a little girl for Samandriel to play with. Dean and Cas are having a little girl," he argues.
Lucifer quickly becomes a presence in the Winchester household as much as Castiel does. He drags Michael and Balthazar around too, so Dean seems to make the jump from expecting one brother to having three older brothers. (Uriel never wants to go to the Winchester's, so he stays home and reads instead when his brothers are running to their house.) He takes it about as well as can be expected.
"Shut up, Dean. But seriously, it's a shame we didn't think of this earlier. Then we'd already be married so we can't participate in this crazy marriage scheme of Chuck's. We'd keep the same last name. We'd never actually have to be married, so there wouldn't need to be a consummation."
"I hid them with a bit of grace," Cas explains, waving his hands for a moment so that their unconscious bodies become visible. "I knocked them unconscious myself, because it's easier to hide them. Unfortunately, the same is not true for Gabriel. He was like this when I got here. But Sam, there is potential that-"
Michael nods, taking his fiance's hand and sitting as his feet. Dean speaks into the silence, "I don't expect you to wait here with me."
"That's encouraging. I think I will intern with him, at least to start out. It is a high honor to be picked by him, after all."
The doctor, who had been holding the door, freezes and turns to pin Cas with an icy stare. "What did you just say?"
Michael grabs Lucifer's water bottle and uncaps it to pour it over his head. Lucifer sputters immediately, pushing water out of his eyes as he reaches for his phone. "Pick up, pick up," he chants frantically. There's a horrible instinct inside of him saying that Balthazar has been gravely injured- that he was shot in the leg. He's never experienced anything like this before, but rumor has it that if one twin was horrifically injured the other would be as well.
But Cas has rarely responded to Sam's prayers before, and it doesn't seem he's going to now. Sam watches one of the vampires move closer to Ben, and suddenly the world is engulfed in flames. Everything is burning, flames gleefully licking higher. The vampire trying to get to Ben is the first to burn, but the others all follow him in his crispy ending until it's just Sam, Claire, Ben, and Benny left alive.
"Dude, was that really necessary? My mom is right there!" Dean argues when he's released, still perched on Michael's lap.
"Y'know what's a scary thought? Imagine just the two of us alive on Earth." Sam says, thinking Lucifer would definitely discover his crush if that were the case. He'd be forced to mate Sam, which wouldn't be fair to either of them.
Lucifer reaches down and yanks Gabriel up, catching him before he overbalances and falls back on his face. "Alright, good enough. Let's go!"
"It's true, Brother," Benny says to Dean. "The children were in danger and he just spread his arms out and flexed his fingers, and fire spewed from them! But before it hit anything, he asked everyone, 'What is your intentions toward my family?' and you couldn't lie to him. I told him honestly I wanted to eat them, and he just said, 'I don't think you're telling the truth.' And that was that, and everyone around us was burning."
In a split second, Sam makes his decision. He knows what he needs to do, and there's only one way to see it through. He imitates Dean's cocky bravado when he challenges "Oh yeah? Better hurry it up then, so I can get my family out of here."
"No, no, don't do this Sam. This wasn't meant to be a sad thing. There's no future for us, but you still have a life, so you'll go back to it. And I'll be your friend for tonight. Tomorrow I'm going to Heaven for the first time, so that will be super exciting! You can come visit sometime."
"Thanks. And getting my memory back some definitely helps. I just wish the rest of it would hurry up and come back too."
"For what?" Jack asks, popping into existence on the bed with them. "Oh, you two got together. Finally. Tell Sam I'll owe him $50 when you see him next."
"Get off of me!" he commands, staring murder at the thin man with milky white eyes who's watching him with the deranged look of a hungry predator.
"It means that the next time we see each other, we will be on Earth together. I will have a proposition for you, one I hope you will accept, but you will learn about all of that in time."
Gabriel laughs and turns around, grabbing Sam and smothering him in goop. Then he lurches toward Balthazar unsteadily, smearing him with the concoction. Balthazar leaps away, swearing in his posh European accent. He grabs the oatmeal he's eating and tries to dump it on Gabriel, but misses and dumps it on Michael instead.
The boy hasn't said a word, tucked into Lucifer's arms, no longer crying, but staring at Balthazar. He glares once his mother puts the attention on him. "You treat my Mommy right, or I will hurt you."
His back hurts. It hurts so badly, and Cas is forced to stop his work for a moment as pain shoots through his body. He grits his teeth and rides out the false contraction. The student says something to him, but Cas doesn't understand it. "I don't understand you," he says in English, "I'm so sorry."
"But come on, not all Alphas act like that. You and Michael don't, Dean doesn't... do you think there were Alphas that would give Omegas rights before, even when it was illegal?"
Lucifer kisses her hand too. "Dean looks a lot like you," Lucifer observes. "Sam too, but in a more subtle manner.
"I saw, honey. Come on, we're soon going to be late to get your brothers from the bus stop." Cas is tugged along to their house. Just as they reach the driveway the bus pulls into view. It stops in front of their house and lets Cas' brothers off. "Gab'il!" Cas screams as his next oldest brother exits. Gabriel is his real name, but that's hard for a three-year-old to pronounce.
He takes Dean's shirt off in much the same manner Dean took his off. They're only on the second button when Dean says, "Cas?" Cas hums next to Dean's heart before he presses a kiss over the possession tattoo. "You don't have to do that just because I-" and then he yelps because Cas is tracing the tattoo with his tongue.
The blonde bartender saunters over to them. "Hi, sweetie, what can I get you?" she questions with a too-friendly smile for Dean.
Obligingly Dean yanks his flannel over-shirt off, followed by his t-shirt. He spins around so Sam can see two huge bumps near his shoulder blades. The hunter and cursed parts of Sam war, conflicted between ignoring his brother's pain and helping.
"It hurt him more than anything he's ever done," Sam chimes in quietly. "I wasn't allowed to talk about you guys any more. He hurt too, Ben, I promise."
"Then I guess you have your answer," Gabriel concludes. He pats Sam's leg as he gets up. "Either way, get some sleep, okay? You don't need to decide anything tonight."
"Hormones, heat relief, intimacy, they want a baby, it's fun, stress relief- I dunno, how long of a list do you want?"
Before Lucifer can retort as he so obviously wants to, Dean and Cas appear in yet another bright flash of light. Dean's green wings are behind him, and he's gripping his sword so tightly his knuckles are white around it. He looks like he's going into battle, and even though Sam has seen him battle-ready thousands of times, the wings add such a different look that he nearly doesn't recognize his own brother.
"Oh! Um...no thanks." Silence, broken only by Sam's slurping. Gabriel's back too soon but not soon enough, with a 'smoothie' that any sane person would refer to as a milkshake. At a quick glance it seems to have ice cream, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, caramel, peanut butter, butterscotch, and 10-15 maraschino cherries.
"Gabriel, stop picking on Cas! Hi Sam, how are you?" Michael greets as he exits the bathroom still fastening his cumberband. Gabriel takes advantage of his brother's distraction and snags the condom from the bed. Then it's into Sam's pocket instead, followed with a lewd wink. "You know what they say about the wedding party."
Gabriel approaches the bed, grinning predatory as he crawls down to Lucifer's level. They lock lips and Lucifer growls as he pulls his brother into a deep soul-searching kiss. Sam is sandwiched between them, and based on the way Gabriel pulls away with a laugh and a quick kiss to Sam's nose, still has his eyes screwed shut. "You're adorable when you're embarrassed, Sammy."
Balthazar stops talking, though he offers a tight-lipped smile at Sam. Crowley's hands travel to the collar of Bobby's shirt, playing across his neck as he says, "The answer is no, Moose. You will not be taking Bobby from us to go hunting."
Triaging: a color-coding system where you identify who needs help first. Black means the person is already dead/beyond the point of help. Red means they need help immediately or they will die. Yellow is the next step down, where a person needs medical care but not immediately. Green is the 'walking wounded' where they are injured but only minimally. Notice Cas doesn't use black at all, thanks to Sam.
Lucifer nods and runs off, jumping the fence again and taking off for their house, bawling bloody murder for their father.
The medical program is nothing short of astounding. The woman showing them around is very friendly and answers all their questions. She also doesn't favor Dean because he's an Alpha, nor does she treat him like a moron because he's a mechanic and not a doctor.
Dean huffs. The music switches to anther song, but neither Winchester notices. Dean presses closer, Sam's arms tightening around him in response. "How long until your honeymoon is over?"
"Quiet!" Uriel barks, knocking on their shared wall, and Lucifer and Balthazar have to smother frantic laughter into their pillows.
"We do, I promise. I've been saving my tip money from bartending. And apparently my parents had a college fund for me that they're dedicating to this instead. So come on. You deserve this- no, you deserve the world, but I want to start with this."
False contractions: aka Braxton-Hicks contractions- contractions that don't actually cause labor. However, this can be a sign you're going into labor. They're irregular contractions. (Cas is so busy he doesn't pay attention to the switch between this and his true labor, that's why he keeps insisting he's fine)
"Throughout the years I've considered it. But Mom always tells me that you guys are my brothers, and I'll want you around some day."
"If Michael didn't think it was safe, he wouldn't ask Inias to represent the garrison leaders. He wouldn't sacrifice Dean's safety," Lucifer reminds him.
"About a year ago, when I went to Harvard for the debate between his lawyers and my debate class." Sam sits back down at the table, and Balthazar follows him.
"God, Bal, that's pretentious, even for you," Lucifer teases. Balthazar shoves him, forgetting that they're on the top bunk and there's no where to shove Lucifer to. Lucifer smacks his back soundly on the wood of the bunk bed and ricochets back up, laughing wildly the whole time.
A few weeks later, Mary goes into labor. When she comes home two days later, she's back with a small bundle in her arms. Lucifer's looking out the window pensively when he spots them, and Mary looks up and waves him over.
"I know. It's not the same. I'm going," Sam promises. He trots off, jumping the fence to the Novak childhood home with the ease of someone who's done this a thousand times before. It's easy to let himself in the door, work around all the people milling about, and jogs up the stairs to Cas' room. Cas is yelling, which is the first thing Sam hears. "It's not funny Gabriel- oh hi Sam- and if you stick this condom in my jacket one more time I'm going to need to be bailed out of jail first before I get to walk down the aisle!"
"Get back here you rugrat! You better pray I don't catch you, because if I do I'm going to kill you!" Michael shouts. Gabriel runs into the room with Michael hard on his heels. Michael's hair is a brilliant shade of purple, which might be why he's yelling.
Dean snarls and blasts the gate with round after round of angel grace. Nothing happens, the gates don't even shudder as he attacks. "I meant it, Cas," Dean whispers when he finally gets tired. Everyone besides Sam has left him to work out his anger at losing Cas, so no one hears him as he repeats "I am coming for you. I promise."
Sam sighs as he cuts off fake-Gabriel yet again, trying to shift his weight so it just looks like he's restless and not doing it on purpose. Chuck is babbling on with the same speech for the third time in a row, and Sam is starting to think he could invest in a career as a wedding officiator if this whole ruling Hell business doesn't work out. Fake-Gabriel has been trying to stand next to Cas, but Sam has been keeping an eye on him and cutting him off. It's hard, because he's supposed to be standing next to Dean as Dean's best man, and Gabriel next to Cas. Bobby shoots him a weird look, which Sam ignores. Bobby's already done his job of walking Dean down the aisle, there's not much else he can do. Even if Sam knew what to do about this, Bobby wouldn't be able to help.
Cas kisses him, though he doesn't allow Dean to escalate the kiss. "I still love hearing that. My day was good, but I'm glad it's over. I'm so tired. Here, let me by to put the groceries away."
"I was going to come for you, once I finished getting our piece of Heaven built. But looks like you beat me to it," he says, as his hand slips into Dean's.
"Michael's locked in the Cage," Dean feels the needs to point out. "Also, no offense, but I'm not really into getting buddy-buddy with him. He tried to kill me, he tried to kill Sam, he tried to kill my parents. I don't want to be his friend." He takes a big bite of his sandwich, declaring the matter closed.
Lucifer hangs up the phone, resisting the urge to throw the stupid thing against the wall. If what Michael claims is true…
Crowley eyes them both suspiciously. "That doesn't sound like something Moose normally does, anything that's not involving Dean doesn't normally get done."
Sam shoots him a side-eyed glance. "Are you trying to convince me to restart the Apocalypse? I thought we were over that."
Afterward, they take him to the Empire State Building. Gabriel beats his chest and whoops like King Kong, and Sam and Lucifer both laugh at him. The other guests appear bemused by Gabriel's antics, thankfully, and not annoyed by them.
"I will show you the respect due to you as Lucifer's consort. Your brother is out house-hunting with Castiel and Michael. They forcibly removed him from the premises this morning."
“For letting me talk to him without you. I’m sure it was hard for you to stay out and take care of Jack, instead of being in here and talking with Sam too."
"No, he wouldn't. How are you related to 'Cas?'" There's amusement clear in Dr. Prescott's voice. "Brothers?"
"Samandriel just woke up." She carries the child out to Michael, passing him off gently. "Look, buddy, it's Uncle Cas!"
Sam finally gets back to Indiana and goes into the hotel. His eyes are burning as he tries to hold them open for a tiny bit longer. The hellhounds knock him out of the car and onto his face, but thankfully it's early enough no one is around to witness it. He staggers into the hotel tiredly.
"Well, I left the house now, I'm studying in the college's library here. But I'm the only person, the librarian just left for the night. Cas is at home with Dean. I had to call Dean in from vacation, he was about an hour away. I stayed with Cassie until he got to our house. Mom and Dad are away at some conference right now, and Gabe was at Kali's again. And of course I texted you big bad college boys who left home to update you."
"Pfft. Yeah. I don't have enough grace to make more, so this will need to last me for the rest of tonight."
Lilith goes into the kitchen to grab their orders as they continue talking. She jumps up onto the counter and sits with them while eating her own meal.
"For his own good, I can't be anything other than a brother figure. I just can't risk it. He's a child!"
"Here's the key. You, Gabriel, and Lucifer," Baldur practically spat the last name, and Sam sympathizes wholeheartedly, "will be rooming in 225."
Gabriel laughs. "Seriously, though, I wouldn't mind a romantic relationship. I like you a lot, Sam, and so does Lucifer."
Castiel has produced an angel blade and is trying to stab Anna with it, but she lurches out of the way and falls to her knees beside Dean. "Sorry, I'm sorry, that was an accident," she apologizes, stretching out her hand and healing him. Dean's entire body jerks as he sucks in a breath. His chest wound begins to heal before their eyes, flesh stitching itself back together as though it had never been parted.
"No! No I'm not going to tell you that. You know why? Because it's not my feelings. Your feelings are valid because they're coming from you. And I can understand why you feel that way."
"He doesn't really consider himself an archangel anymore. Talk to him, Sam. Do you forgive him for what he's done?"
Sam steps away from Azazel, shadowing Dean out to Baby. Dean hands him several blades, slamming the trunk then taking one of the blades back. Cas is suddenly there, removing the other blade from Sam's hands. "Claire prayed to me. I know where they are." He latches on to Dean and they vanish.
Sam spent a restless night jogging the blocks around the hotel then collapsing beneath the stairwell. It wasn't comfortable, which is probably why he's awake entirely too early.
The guy walks over, hand still tight around the bartender's waist. "Hi. Lucifer? I'm Azazel, but my friends call me Aze. And of course you've already met my mate and the love of my life, Lilith."
"Mom, I'm talking about going to Harvard, not the moon! Dean and Cas went by themselves when they were younger than me!"
Dean shrugs. "Sounds better." He says nothing as they walk outside and climbs inside of Baby, but then as he puts the car into gear he asks, "Have Gabriel or Lucifer said anything?"
"For what? You're right, now more than ever," she snickers. "I'm going home now, before you can shove your foot in your mouth any further. Ta, darling."
Cas takes Benny and Claire, and soon it's just Lucifer and Sam standing together. Sam is fidgeting and backing up slowly, probably subconsciously but that doesn't make it hurt less. "Ready, Sam?"
"Brother or not, you will lose both hands if you ever joke about taking your underwear off in Sam's presence ever again."
"They had a meal with Michael, Anna, and Samandriel last night. But when they come to get us, they're staying for another dinner with you."
Sam realizes whatever is causing Michael to act this way is the strange voice he heard in his visions, laughing and saying it awaits him. But what could possibly be strong enough to possess an archangel?
Sam quips, "It can get worse? We better go then!" He takes Gabriel's hand, landing easily as they appear into the hotel again. "Thanks. Both of you. Again. It was fun." He squeezes both men's hands then releases them.
"She's not into me, she's into Adam. Here, give me your plate Mom, I'll get your pizza." He throws a slice on it and passes it back. Dean gets three slices of meat lovers, Adam and John two apiece. Sam pulls the entire veggie lovers close and begins eating straight from the pan.
"Amazing, as usual. It's so awesome being able to help all the different students. And it's so fun to speak multiple languages! Plus, I'm thinking it should help once I become a lawyer, because I won't necessarily have to use an interpreter, and hopefully that will help build our rapport and trust with clients. How is your latest case going?" he asks, slinging himself onto the couch next to Lucifer.
Dean closes his textbook, algebra abandoned for the moment. He pats the bed, and Mary comes to sit with him. "What's up?"
Gabriel leaves them to get dressed, and reappears in a few moments in his suit. It's designer, though Sam thinks that's more because of Balthazar and Crowley than Bobby's pick. He tosses Sam's own suit at him, so he gets changed in the kitchen with a sultry wink.
"No. There was no marriage certificate, no kiss, no sex, no honeymoon, no legality. It wasn't real."
"No way, I've carefully avoided thinking about that," laughs Cas. "I'm hoping I'll have one of those precipitous labors that last half an hour or so, but I honestly don't think that'd be good for me or the babies."
Gabriel sighs, flopping down on the loveseat. He's not leaving now, apparently. "I was really self-conscious. Still am, as a matter of fact. I don't think I'm really much to look at, and I'm kinda short. Also, I'm a bit overweight. Cassie and you are both gangly thin Omegas, and I just kinda figured my mate would never be satisfied with the way I look."
"This nephew of mine is spoiled rotten, and he's not even born yet," Lucifer remarks, stretching out his back.
Sam sniffles. "I think it's harder because I can't remember your wedding, or your pregnancy with the twins. I see the pictures, you know, but I feel like an imposter got to experience those moments with you. I feel like the world has just merrily gone on its way and left me behind and I'm just sprinting trying to catch up. It's so frustrating."
Cas trails after the kid as they gather candles and roses. "I hope your friend has a great birthday."
He's still more than half asleep as he stumbles downstairs, which is what drives him to grab a mug of coffee and beg Bobby's flask off of him.
Lucifer has taken the opportunity to fly up behind Gabriel and knock him to the ground. "Get him, Sam!" he yells as he pins his brother to the ground so he can't fly away.
Lucifer looks up from his computer again around ten. He's shocked to realize it's dark out, and Sam is snoring on his shoulder. Somehow he missed that, too. He picks Sam up and carries him to the guest room, lying him down on the bed before systematically stripping him of his plaid shirt and sneakers. Sam mumbles something beneath his breath and turns onto his stomach, which works fine for Lucifer because that's all the more naked Sam should be if he's sleeping in the guest bedroom- t-shirt and jeans. Then he goes out to call Mary.
The bed dips as more weight gets added to it, and Sam flips Gabriel over him, tossing him onto the bed behind him as wild eyes assess this new threat. Lucifer freezes, hands extended as he reaches for the shirt thrown on the pillow under Sam's head. "Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt."
Lucifer nods. He opens the door and lets Gabriel out first, then raises an eyebrow challengingly at Sam. "Go, and don't you dare say anything. And don't touch me, either."
Lucifer puts his hand out as if he's waiting on Sam to shake it. "Hi, have we met? Lucifer Novak, overly-dramatic Alpha lawyer." He waggles his eyebrows flirtatiously at the young Omega, allowing himself this one thing as a concession to his feelings.
"The Apocalypse, brother?" Michael addresses Raphael as Sam finishes reassuring Cas. "Lucifer and I have healed old wounds. We do not intend to fight."
Lucifer looks at him in horrified silence. Sure, this is what he's brought Sam here for but... He takes a deep breath for fortification and answers, "You are."
"No, I knew long before that. When that d**n demon possessed me, that's when I realized it. They told me you've been possessed by Lucifer, so I know you got an idea of what I'm talking about. You talk, in your own head, even if you don't want to. And all he wanted to talk about was you. Sam, Sam, Sam. He had plans for you; you were to be Lucifer's vessel. And he was in awe of you. You were everything he wanted, even back then. He was pinning all of his hopes on you.
"See, it's not just me who says that," Lucifer mutters, grabbing a cup of coffee. Michael pokes his tongue out at him childishly.
"Let go!" Sam protests, bothered by the fact that his arm is held like he's a prisoner or a disobedient child. Lucifer doesn't acknowledge him, and Sam tries to ignore the burst of fear that travels down his spine. "Lucifer, let go or I'll make a scene."
Sam wakes to hear his phone chime with an incoming message. He is covered in sweat, evidently his fever had broken. He hears a creaking sound and turns to see Adam come out of the bathroom. "Hey, you're awake again!" Adam exclaims happily. "Wait. Where are you at right now?"
That's really all he has to say to make Sam feel guilty. He drinks the smoothie in about three gulps, handing the empty cup to Gabriel, who vanishes it with a snap. "Thanks," Sam tells him. "Sit with me?"
Cas stops suddenly. "But Dean, if I go to school here you won't be able to keep working with Bobby!"
Dean's mommy comes out, and takes him into the house. She picks him up and holds him for a little while, rubbing his back as he cries, until all his tears are gone. "It's alright," she promises. "We're just going to babysit you for a little bit until either your daddy wakes up or your mommy gets home. Your brother is going to be fine." Then she carries him up the stairs to a nice blue room with Batman bed sheets. "Dean? Look who's here to play!"
Mary smiles and takes his hand. The two go into the elevator, heads bent together. The door closes and Sam spends several seconds watching the closed door, mentally replaying the scene of his parents together for the first time in years.
"Then I can't do it. Because there is no way I'd be able to fit something of that size into my body."
"Because your letter made it sound like you were so busy. I didn't think you had time to write to me, and it was distracting you from other, more important stuff."
Michael's lips purse into a thin line as he stares at his remaining husband. "Close down Heaven. Recall the Host. Earth obviously isn't safe anymore."
"Hmmm. Well you're in luck. I do have the textbooks you're looking for, most of them anyway. I can make some calls and get the rest. I'll see you back here at this time tomorrow?"
"What I don't understand is, what is possibly strong enough to do that? What can possess an archangel? Like, what the h**l?" Dean demands, pacing in the hotel room he shares with Cas and Michael. They had reconvened here after the possession of Michael and Sam. It's only him, Michael, Cas, Gabriel, Lucifer, and an unconscious Sam in the room right now. John has Mary somewhere else as she recovers.
Dean huffs in exasperation. "Scoot over. And if you kick me in the middle of the night, be prepared to greet your husbands tomorrow with just one leg."
He looks up to see Dean wipe a tear from his cheek. "We thought maybe you felt unloved," Dean mumbles. "We were just trying to help."
Lilith darts into the back, pulling her apron off as she goes. "I'm leaving!" she calls to whoever is in the back.
Sam winces slightly and turns toward his father, who had obviously entered the hotel behind him and Dean. "Winchester family reunion. Yay," he hears Gabriel intone sarcastically.
After a bit more pleading, Jess finally leaves him at the table. Sam sits back and watches her dance, a fond smile playing across his lips.
Michael finally leaps onto the stand and pounds his brother's back until his airway is clear. Because Sam's watching closely, he sees Lucifer say, 'You are so dead' the second his airway is clear.
"So, beneficence is doing the best thing for the greatest number of people. Nonmaleficence is doing the least harm the least amount of people. They're similar, but nonmaleficence is what they did on the Titanic after they hit the iceberg. People were going to die, but they tried to minimize it by sending women and children first."
"Dean can't be a part of this either," Sam says, frustration clear in his tone. "All I need is Lucifer's Cage."
"A man arrived who is being vocal in his desire to kill you, Sam. He rants loudly about demon blood. Your mother and Bobby are trying to calm him."
Cas tries valiantly to stay awake, but soon after he's finished nursing the babies he drifts off to sleep. Dean holds Cas' head in his lap, stroking his hair with one arm as he holds his son in the other. Lucifer has Claire, and he's been crying since he first held her in his arms.
"Excuse me, sirs," the manager requests, plopping a giant bowl of ice cream between the two of them with two spoons. Sam's eyes become dinner plates as he stares at the ice cream.
Sam pulls a b***hface at him. "Behave. I'll be back in ten minutes." He darts away to their room on the second floor. Nine minutes later he is back, hair still damp, and yanking on a plaid shirt overtop a black tanktop. "Ready!"
"Murderers, anyone with crimes against children, abusers, human traffickers, drug kingpins-" Azazel begins.
"The way you watched him. And you were so proud when he had the idea to sue Alastair. I've never seen that expression on your face before."
Mary and John are the first to make it to the hospital, and Gabe and Kali aren't far behind. Then Bal, Rowena, and Crowley show up, though Crowley isn't allowed into the ICU. Lucifer sits with him while Bal and Rowena go in. Becky and Chuck are the next in, followed by Uriel. Michael is the next to show up, fresh from court, and Anna comes in with Samandriel moments later. Then finally Dean and Cas show up with Jack and Claire in tow.
Sam freezes, mouth an inch from Lucifer's. Then he pulls away, grumbling under his breath as he moves out the door. "What?" he growls.
"And we're not. But if you say 'yes' to me, I can show you how I feel. How I've always felt. I kept it from you before, and you felt the wall but didn't even realize it. I can take it down."
"I don't know. I can never claim to understand the Will of my Father. But it's true. It's undeniable."
"Dean, the point is, we don't want you and Cas to become a teenage pregnancy statistic. And we're worried you might become one."
"I didn't!" At Cas' skeptical look, he amends, "Just the one. And I didn't even kill it. The freak fire took care of it. Besides, they were going for the kids! What did you want me to do- throw myself into the vampire's arms and say 'Eat me first'?"
"What's the last thing you remember? I want you to write it on this white board so you don't lose your voice immediately."
Something about that strikes Lucifer. He leans back, away from the bartender. "Did he mention I know who my mate is?"
He waits outside the door to be sure he hasn't made Sam angry, but instead he's met with a sound he hasn't heard for months- Sam is laughing. Lucifer smiles to himself and goes off for a snack out of the vending machine.When he returns, Sam is sleeping, and Lucifer knows he's dodged the conversation for now.
Balthazar laughs. "Want to know a secret? Nobody knows what they're doing at the age of eighteen. We all fake it until we make it. You're normal."
"Bluebells." Dean turns to listen to the music, cocking his head as Cas does when he's confused. "Dance with me?"
"New ones always take their place. That's true of everything- mortal or immortal. You have new fears."
Although the demons are organized, it takes a couple well-aimed hits to break them apart. Sam is quick, darting through them and upending cups then darting out of the way. Lucifer rushes in behind them, thrusting more green drinks over them. They're a good team, and between them the entire demon group is smothered in green goop in seconds.
Dead-Sam vanishes before he can answer, and Lucifer's memory of himself chuckles. "Even now, you've become a thorn in my side, Vessel of Michael," he addresses the ceiling.
"I'm home, baby!" Sam calls with a smile. He's been doing better, smiling more, remembering more, and going to therapy. He's been put on antidepressants for the moment, and taking them faithfully. All in all, he's doing so much better- and now Lucifer is afraid he's going to backslide. "What happened?"
"When we died, did you get rid of all the hellhounds?" Jo asks, bouncing excitedly on the balls of her feet next to her mother.
I sincerely apologize to everyone who is waiting such a long time for this chapter, it really gave me some trouble.
"Greece. This is where Thesselia was. It uh, it wasn't always this ugly." He waves his hand, and Sam sees a completely different city. In place of the bustling metropolis of modern day, there's a beautiful ancient Greece city. There's much more trees than they used to be, and Sam almost feels that the air is cleaner. It looks cleaner, as though the pollution is all gone or something.
"No. I thought maybe Jess- but the more time I spend with her I don't think she's it. And Cas told me we shouldn't settle for each other."
Lucifer refuses to be baited. "Once more. Then we'll gather the demons and discuss whatever you want."
"It's tradition," Michael says, "and besides, Dean will be fine. We already know the outcome of the fight- Castiel and he will be able to defeat the other angels, but not me. We've just got to let it play out. Besides, Dean has been practicing. He's using his grace, as you saw today, and practicing flying. He's taken to battle in air with astonishing speed. He'll do well, and he'll make an excellent leader of Heaven. There's nothing to worry about, Sam. Dean's not in danger."
