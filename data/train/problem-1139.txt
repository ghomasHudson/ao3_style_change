A bloodhound pup around four months old now resided in his home that was shared with the army doctor and it drove him crazy. His friend had insisted on keeping it temporarily to his dismay. It had been a week since its arrival to their no longer adjusted lifestyle.
This dream started as the others would with darkness and its shadows surrounding him like a warm cocoon, it was suffocating.
“There was money. It’s brilliant, absolutely brilliant!” A clap of his hands as he laughed in a boisterous manner; a smile wide on his lips, “There’s a clear smell of cotton, ink and a coppery undertone; possibly blood.”
The doctor gazed up from where he had been reading his email that his sister had sent him. He had been more focused on that admittedly to the case the Inspector left them to review. Him and his sister Harry had never gotten on since he left for the military; now that he had returned and became a prominent figure in the newspapers, she had taken to reading his blog and wanted him to come to dinner with her and Clara. She was throwing the olive branch first, he spent a few moments to think of how to respond when the call of his name came.
After Lestrade had left the flat, Sherlock had taken to pacing a hole into the floor in front of the couch with little Tobey circling with him easily. Every other step, the tall male had to pause to chide the creature to stop his motions.
He took long strides towards the open door where the bane of his existence had just appeared from all the while John remained stationary. “John, let’s go.” And out Sherlock went without a backwards glance.
“Sherlock, there are four people missing. This is not a bloody game, we need to find them fast.”
A small secretive smile came onto John’s lips instead now as those meticulous hands that saved lives were no longer reaching for his own; they went behind him to Moriarty’s. No. One of them was going to die with the probability of a gunshot hitting a viable organ. The brief struggle resulted in the percentage calculated outcome: one would die from it.
Before the military man could respond, the sound of footsteps bounding up the stairs could be heard which turned both heads towards the door to see the Detective Inspector looking worn out; more so than usual. “Sherlock…John…. you two have never been a sight for sore eyes.”
“Sherlock, can you try to be rational for once and not make enemies? This is their turf not ours. I’ve heard carnies are pretty territorial.” John warned his friend as his eyes took in the way the dwarves were making obscene gestures towards them. It made him shudder a brief moment.
~ ~ ~
A growl escaping him as he willed his feet to cooperate and move; to stop this with action! Now as it released his grip and he practically jumped the last three steps, he skidded to a halt at the door frame. There he was.
“Eh? Just junk from the circus cleanups. What with the shit from the elephants and dogs, you’d think people would be put off from eatin’ anythin’ an’ makin’ a fuckin’ mess.” The large man grumbled a badge on his chest saying his name as ‘Jakob’; he reached for one of the bags to toss it into his garbage truck. “Look I don’t ask, I just toss it out. So get your mutt outta here before I toss ‘im into the crusher too.”
Their fingers brushing made him twitch to grasp the phone and keys securely this time as he retracted to his side, “Sorry. I’ll uh…just get going.”
A dream.
“Yes, good day Detective Inspector.” The redhead gave a brief wave in farewell as the DI entered his vehicle to drive away. Mycroft’s eyes watching till the car was gone from sight with a small sigh escaping him as he went to trail inside. “Still couldn’t do it…. well done Mycroft.”
“What?”
“It’s entirely possible, but I’d have to gain a greater sense of smell before I can definitively deduce a body was placed in there. Money is the surety, perhaps someone who got in the wrong place.” A tap of his chin as he mentally mumbled details of the four men who had disappeared; tacking off who out of the four would have the body depth to even fit in the small barrel.
John’s face wrinkled slightly at his flat mate’s disposition to assist their friend though before he could coax the man to assist, his ears picked up on a chime from his laptop. He moved automatically to it and sat in Sherlock’s chair to review the email.
A small ringtone from “Breaking Bad” could be heard, making Greg look down to his cellphone to dig into the pocket and press the answer button, “Lestrade. Eh? Alright, alright; I’ll be there in a bit…keep the missus occupied.” He commented, getting to his feet as he set half drank cup onto the coffee table.
“I heard that!” Sherlock paused in his pacing to frown at John who went back to gazing at his computer, pretending to be deaf to the offended tone.
John. His mind supplied.
“It says here that four audience members have disappeared since its show appearance, making it two a night. No bodies found, no evidence of foul play – they’ve just up and gone. Why haven’t you made this public? You know to avoid additional disappearances.”
“Donovan’s. The woman would do anything to try and ‘one’ up me. Miserably I might add.” The Detective with the curled black hair sat up, reaching for his slippers to place onto his feet while giving the pup a small nudge with his foot to go off. “Shoo you beast.”
He had to do something! Or perhaps say something? His mouth opened to retort back to the man who was trailing to the door to the street only to hear the strain of nothing coming out. Oh Sherlock could practically hear the jokes or sneers from colleagues stabbing into his mind for which he momentarily ignored.
Mycroft’s eyebrow raise in the direction of the smaller male who had dismissed him as easily as his brother did, causing him to shake his head, “He’s a horrible influence. To which I’m speaking of, I have yet to determine.” He spoke to himself out loud before finding his own way out; making sure the CCTVs were all operational to spy on his favorite DI.
“If there was money in the barrels, where’s it gone now? I’d imagine if this was some convoluted plan, they can’t exactly store it openly. It’s a small area.” He felt himself tugged by the small dog off to a small bale of hay, watching as the pup relieved himself then pattered back to Sherlock.
The sound of an irritated Anderson coming from the floor jostled his brief musings to gaze down. “Lestrade?! Hello! I was still speaking!”
“My brother has a very small perceived notion of how to react to anything.” Mycroft responded with irritation coated in his voice, peeking to the door with the 221B sign.
“Sherlock, how can you decide the level if you haven’t even heard Greg say what it’s about?” Rubbing at his temples, the army doctor rose to grab the folder from the weary officer, offering his seat in return as he trailed to the kitchen to make him a cup of coffee.
“Come now you two. Can we not?”
The shorter of the two only crossing his arms over his chest with a raised eyebrow, “Just because you haven’t had a case doesn’t mean you need to take it out on the little fellow.”
“Well I couldn’t very well just leave him home alone. Mycroft refused to take him - rather looked about to toss him back into the gutter.” A calm tone responded to the other’s complaint. "I've got him leashed, I'll handle it."
“No of course not. You HAD to pick him up, bring him home and wash him off in our sink; you know how much bacteria were transmitted to your hands in a matter of seconds?” The petulant man responded from his location: the long couch, laying calmly as his eyes stared up to the worn-down ceiling. A frown clearly depicted on his features from the unwarranted guest in the shared flat.
“You didn’t come here for anything important otherwise you would’ve complained about it by now.”
“He’s no trouble. I imagine you’re going to head out, please leave him with Mrs. Hudson and she’ll make sure he doesn’t rip your brother’s lab apart.” John commented casually slipping on his leather jacket as well then on went his boots by the door.
His long arms with their large palms extended outward towards John’s that were held up, reaching as best he could while his frame struggled. The shorter man’s arms following suit as he reached forward only to have Moriarty slip an arm around his waist instead and the gun now more notable as it was placed to the blonde’s temple.
Greg took his cup to sip and sighed at the warmth it brought him. It was rather chilly outside considering it was early November; the wind blowing against the trees outside making them bend this way and that. His hazel irises looking to the consulting detective seriously for a moment.
The curly-haired Holmes would only have a frown on his features when they returned as if now noticing the animal.
A snort escaped the Inspector which turned into a sheepish expression when he recalled he still had company; a very dignified one at that. His hand was paused as he was about to reach for his fallen items only to see the taller man reaching down more quickly then promptly handing them over.
A laugh escaping past the DI’s lips as he nodded, “He barely gets ruffled when I’m here, so seeing you accomplish the job’s good for a chuckle. I left him with something to help with and doesn’t even blink!”
“Hello Doctor Watson. Why should I knock when the door was already open from the Inspector’s departure?” It was said in the most obvious tone that had John sighing as he got to his feet with his dog at hand.
They were beautiful, filled with life that drastically opposed the image embedded unfortunately in his mind of them being dead.
It was a brief moment between them but with his quick observational skills; he took in the other’s appearance more vividly and commit it to memory instead. From the soft wrinkle of John’s nose at his clear contentment that was mingled with patience drawing thin presumably from his own actions; then the light ruffle in his hair from a quick jog out of their flat to catch a cabby to the circus as well as probably wrestling the dog. A small smile on his lips that were aimed only at him, Sherlock, his heart unconsciously speeding up in its beat then the scene from this morning briefly flashed his eyes that made him grip into the fabric of the leather beneath fingertips.
The loud pop sound stopped any passerby on the street who watched the violence unfold; screaming in terror to seek shelter should a bullet stray.
His fingers had curled into the fabric of the suit in front of him a moment for his bearings, hazel eyes then relaxing as Greg pushed himself back and away to straighten out. “Ah apologies, Mycroft, I was just headin’ out.”
Sherlock moved easily past his brother towards the coat hanger for his blue long coat to shrug on easily, shifting the collar up as he did so then reaching for his scarf to wrap about his long neck without so much as a response. The other two occupants in the room, not counting the new dog, would gaze to him curiously: well, John was curious, Mycroft was indifferent.
“Isn’t that metaphor counterproductive? Not to mention horribly grotesque? I mean taking a stone to murder two birds is very inefficient and-”
“It wasn’t my idea, it was---”
“He likes you, stop discouraging him and just tell me what on earth you were talking about before? Lestrade said something and you just got all into your thinking mode.”
John nibbled at Sherlock’s ear as he continued to bring Sherlock to orgasm. He sucked and nipped around Sherlock’s neck, leaving behind red marks. Soon, Sherlock was clutching him, his teeth sinking into John’s neck as he came.
“So the words mean nothing?”
Sherlock. You can't sleep here.” He stood out of the tub, wrapping a towel around his waist.
John bucked his hips forward, growing desperate for more.
“You doing okay John?”
“Of course, I…do…do you want to-”
“I’m happy just being with you.”
“Of course.” John whispered, smiling as he followed Sherlock.
The two sat in the awkward embrace for a few minutes, before John’s breathing was completely even and relaxed and he stood up with Sherlock.
“Shut up.” John grumbled.
John hadn’t realised that Sherlock was in the room and so at the sound of his voice from the front of the room startled him, causing him to hiccup and looked behind his shoulder. He quickly turned away but Sherlock saw his face; his eyes were red from rubbing them, his cheeks and nose colored red and were glistening in the mellow light of the lamp on the bedside table. He was shaking slightly but Sherlock crept further and when he was next to John, he knelt down and waited for John to be comfortable in talking. It was awhile, but John finally got his breathing under control, the tears no longer coming.
“I do John, but I… I called your therapist.”
John nodded, unable to speak coherently, and he crashed his lips against Sherlock, and soon after, he was coming, a cry muffled by Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock then came, white hot pleasure erupting in his body.  The two rode out their orgasms, clinging onto each other.
“John-” Sherlock said, pulling back slightly to view his partner laughing uncontrollably.
John grinned. “Sorry love but I love it when you look so lustful. Makes me hard.” He whispered, rocking his hips.
“Here Sherlock, take small sips of this,” John said as he opened the can. “And keep your eyes on the horizon.”
John, happy to please Sherlock’s request, squirmed out of his jumper and t-shirt, baring his scarred and tanned chest to Sherlock who immediately began touching John’s chest. He then licked up from John’s right nipple to his earlobe, causing a moan creep out of John. He began sucking and biting John’s neck back down leaving marks along the way. John, aroused more than ever, than pulled Sherlock’s face back to his and roughly began kissing him. The two men were kissing and gasping for breath, their trousers becoming unbearably tight that it wasn’t long before Sherlock pulled back suddenly with his hair in a disarray. He quickly got off of John’s lap and yanked off his own trousers and pants, revealing his very erected cock.  At the sensual sight, John, who had been catching his breath, quickly began unbuckling his own when Sherlock’s hands joined his own and pulled John’s trousers and pants all at once, letting them join with his own on the floor.
“Sherlock.” John said for the third time as he followed the detective into a warehouse. It was dark now, John swearing at himself for not thinking to bring a flashlight. “Sherlock.” He said again, when he got no response.
“John—” Sherlock moaned as he slammed into John’s body.
* * *
The two stayed like that, John on top of Sherlock as he began to calm down, slowly drifting back asleep.
Sherlock made a startled noise as John began to stroke his cock.
“Did anyone talk to you about it? Explain it-”
Sherlock smirked, but nodded. He and John made their way to the cab waiting, the two men trying to hide their aroused state.
“Nice to meet you.” John said. Sherlock shook the ladies’ hands, both women giggling even louder. John, confused, shook it and off and continued catching up with his mates.
Sherlock moaned and slightly broke apart. “You want to…?” Sherlock mumbled.
“Mhm, that was perfect.” John panted against Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock winced as his hands were squished between the desk and John’s backside.
Johns smiled, before kissing Sherlock's swollen lips gently.
“Okay?”
John gasped at the sudden pleasure, grasping Sherlock shoulders.
“John, we shouldn’t. Just tell me about it.”
Sherlock pulled off, crawling over John to kiss him hard.
“Oh, brilliant!” Sherlock exclaimed
Lestrade, who was looking at the words, was now just getting it.
John rearranged himself, pulling his trousers down enough to reveal his cock. He lifted Sherlock higher a bit a he aligned himself with Sherlock’s entrance.
John kept his gaze away from Lestrade as he followed.
“Sherlock.” John whispered harshly has his erection strained against his jeans.
“John…?”
Sherlock sucked in a breath before scooting back a bit to allow room for John to stretch out a bit. John followed suit, quickly sliding fully under Sherlock, and with the help of Sherlock’s quick hands, they both got John’s trousers and pants down past his knees, the shocking cold air causing John to gasp.
“Mmh, what?” John groaned, sitting up slightly to peer at Sherlock, who had already pulled on his coat and scarf.
“Sher-” John started. “This…this is crazy! You-you really want to…I mean…oh fuck it.” John launched forward, pulling Sherlock down into a kiss. Sherlock gasped, as John ravaged his mouth. The two kissed roughly, Sherlock moving his hands to John’s arse, squeezing it.
“Really, Lestrade? I thought this wasn’t your division.”
“John-“ Sherlock said again, rolling his eyes. “Its not
. And with that, John discarded his sandwich, and made his way as quickly as possible back to Scotland Yard.
The cabbie didn’t respond but pulled out two bottles, a pill in each. He placed them next to each other in front of them.
“Yes.” Sherlock said, his voice rough.
John carried his gun into the kitchen, handing to Sherlock.
John smiled before sitting up. “Here.” He gently tugged Sherlock forward so that he was easily sitting directly in John’s lap. He sat up straighter, resting more forward, placing his hands on Sherlock’s thighs.
John cleared his throat. “Uh, yeah…I’m—I’m fine.”
“John.” Sherlock moaned, pulling John on top of him so that he was straddling him.
“Seen what?” Sherlock whispered sharply, still facing away from John.
“Close..Sher-Sherlock…I’m---“ John sucked in a breath before his orgasm hit him, ecstasy running though his veins as he came. Sherlock came right after, the feeling of John’s body against his sending shivers through out him. It was only after a few more minutes before either man caught his breath, the cold air causing goose bumps to form.
John’s face flushed with embarrassment but kept silent for a moment, trying desperately to think of an explanation.
in the mood to have my whole trip be deduced and analyzed, thank you very much.” John grumbled as he stood on his toes to reach a clean mug.
Sherlock lay there on the long couch calmly in contemplation. The dream was becoming habitual, ever since the incident at the pool. His heart had dropped at seeing so many explosive strapped to John; a man he knew was very much capable in his right to be used for foul purposes. Moriarty knew how to press his buttons and it irked him that the feeling was not reciprocated.
Right now though, it was having an opposite effect on him: it was giving him anxiety that he desperately needed to vanquish.
John looked now over to Sherlock who was looking over the body, undeterred as always with little Tobey sniffing about as well. The man muttering to the dog who appeared to respond with tiny yaps of agreement which caused a small smile to appear on normally stoic features; it was endearing to see a man bonding with his dog over a dead man’s body.
The younger Holmes only frowned at the snickering sound then reached for the file to toss it onto John’s laptop, “John, when Mycroft comes up, leave him the dog and let’s get going.”
This last question spoken out loud in the flat made the curly haired Holmes look up from his cellphone, tossing it aside to reach for the folder once more and skim it over more thoroughly than the first time. “That’s the good question. Now…. it’s a five.” It was something to take his mind off of reliving a tormenting moment of the morn.
Also being observant or rather, just observant of Sherlock considering how many years they had lived together in addition to the general cases they undertook; the man leaned his head forward and into his space.
“Oi! You can’t be here!”
Next came the sound of running water from the kitchen as it filled up a small bowl before being set down onto the tiled floor that was surprisingly clean of muck, blood or any odd sticky substance. The pup running towards the dish with his panting tongue nearly skid to a halt at the feet of the man who placed it for it. It began to lap at the water lavishly in its thirst.
Recalling the question tossed to him, he tossed his head back to look over at the occupant in the kitchen with a frown, “I was advised it might have been…more beneficial to scope out the place after the first two disappeared but we missed our window of opportunity and the next pair went missing.”
“I called your therapist.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Comfortable?”  John asked, making room for Sherlock.
? John didn’t know and was afraid to find out.
“John?”
Sherlock remained quiet only for ten minutes and then he said, “I’m going below deck.”
“School?”
“You weren’t home.” Lestrade said, exasperated. “We tried contacting you but you never answered, and your landlady said you were staying with a friend…”
“Wow…that was amazing…”
John’s mouth began to water as he eyed the breakfast. Sherlock led him to sit down but before he began to eat, he looked up at Sherlock.
“Yes.” John nodded quickly before he began unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt. Once the removed the shirt he moved to Sherlock trousers and soon enough Sherlock was completely naked, goose bumps forming on his skin as he was looked at by John.
“I want to hear you say it.”
still loved him, and treated him just the same, for they could really care less who their son loved. Now Sherlock Holmes was most definitely not a virgin. He had to have sex to know what the big fuss was about and so he did, with a boy with a name he deleted, in his first year at university. He enjoyed it for the most part, but found other things he’d rather do, and it didn’t help peak his interest when most of the people around him were too dull. But then he met Victor Trevor and that’s when it took a turn for the worse. Sherlock lost control, that’s what he thinks and so after three years under the influence of Victor Trevor and cocaine, Sherlock Holmes swore off relationships and of course drugs but cigarettes and nicotine patches don’t count. And only rarely did he have sex. He didn’t really miss it, but as he grew older he found other things to do.
“If they cared for her and loved her so much then she wouldn’t have been wandering the streets for so long and I wouldn’t have found her.” He snapped, anger radiating from him; anger and another emotion John couldn’t place; something he’s never seen on Sherlock.
The father simply handed Sherlock pictures of what appeared to be Marie, some dating back to Christmas, 5 months ago.
“A client.” Sherlock said, a slight annoyance in his tone.
“John,” Sherlock said, breaking the kiss. “I…I may have a list…actually.” He said, suddenly feeling shy.
Sherlock eased himself slowly onto John’s cock, gasping as his enhanced senses erupted through him.
John watched as Sherlock continued talking to the people, their faces not hiding the obvious features of admiration. John surged forward, walking in between the crowd, grabbing Sherlock’s attention. When Sherlock laid eyes on John, his eyes widened.
Silence devoured the room for several minutes, the both of them organizing their thoughts. Sherlock remained standing for a bit longer before he took the seat across from John at the table. John looked up at him and placed his interlocked hands in front of him on the table while Sherlock kept his in his lap.
“I-alright,” John said, blushing deeply.
“Okay, slowly, now.” Sherlock said, his voice wavering a bit as John sank lower.
The man didn’t respond, his breathing hitching as more tears fell from his eyes but he nodded, slowly reaching out to Sherlock. At that Sherlock swiftly sprung forward, seizing the man and taking him down off the ledge and onto the balcony floor. Noise erupted from the ground but Sherlock paid no attention. He held the man in his arms as the man continued on crying and shaking all over from the cold. Sherlock remained where he was until the man’s shaking subsided and the tears stopped; all that was left was the man trying to catch his breath. He then slowly stood up, the man still clutching him in a sideways hug and Sherlock half carried the man into the room and sat him down on the bed.
Sherlock gasped at John’s orgasm, he himself suddenly coming, his come splattering his and John’s chests as he rode his orgasm out.
I have added a few tags and also I am not an expert in therapy or in PTSD treatment; the following is just what I imagined would happen.
He nodded.
Sherlock Holmes was a man of many things. He had been many things as well in only 34 years of his life. And now, when the most bravest, kindest, and wisest human being he has ever had the good fortune of knowing tells him that he is in love with Sherlock, Sherlock himself feels he is no longer just
The two continued to snog there for another ten minutes before coming back up to the deck.
Finally, they were they. Sherlock, after almost running here, stopped right outside the door.
John’s head snapped up at that. “You did?”
“You’re an army doctor, recently returned from either Afghanistan or Iraq. You were wounded but not in the leg but in the shoulder and yet you feel pain in your leg so it’s a psychosomatic limp you have which your therapists does not see. You are extremely depressed and have a hidden gun in your waistband underneath your coat and were on your way to kill yourself when you got into the ill-fated cab. You are suicidal but are not going to kill yourself any time soon now for an unknown reason, and you were just going to ask Sergeant Donavan for a recommendation of a counselor. Am I wrong?”
“Oi! Stop!” The guard yelled as he stumbled.
“Oh.” John said, looking down in between their bodies.
stated the obvious.
John hummed as Sherlock began to tremble, the warm water rippling around them. “John.” Sherlock said with more intensity, clearly wanting more. John smiled against Sherlock's skin.
“We’re clean.” Sherlock stated, placing his lips roughly onto John’s neck, sucking and biting and licking again to soothe as John began mumbling incoherent words. Sherlock hands found their way back to John’s jeans, and elegantly pulled they down along with John’s
thing, I kinda really want you to see if you can guess the password. So the password is now not in the living room” John said. Sherlock looked at him in confusion. And then he realised
“I want…” Sherlock started.
“Ugh, sore. Who knew you could come just by me calling your name?” He said, smirking.
John didn’t stop though and then Sherlock was coming into John’s throat.
John sighed. “Sherlock, what did I tell you about sharing each other our kinks and fantasies?”
As the two kissed and sucked and nipped each other, John shoved off his coat, and then shucked Sherlock’s off. He then moved his hands swiftly over Sherlock’s shirt, unbuttoning it. He ran his hands over Sherlock’s chest, twisting his nipples. He leaned forward, latching onto one, swirling his tongue around the nub, feeling it harden in his mouth.
Sherlock didn’t respond but the look of terror was enough for John to reassure him.
“Perfect.” Sherlock whispered.
“Good morning John. What did you want to do today?” Sherlock asked, not completely sure if that’s what he should be asking.
are the only one that is being daft. I mean, it’s…” He paused clearly realising he’s about to let out a deep secret. “It’s so obvious to Lestrade, to Molly, to Mycroft...to practically every client, I mean, how could you not have seen it?” he said the last part softly, his face relaxing in resignation.
Sherlock glanced right and left, only to see they were trapped.
* * *
Finally, with the tension building, John slowly turned around, ready to explain himself when he was bombarded with Sherlock right behind him. Before John had time to curse at Sherlock for sneaking up on him, Sherlock planted his lips onto John’s.
“Is killing those who remind him of fairytale characters.” Sherlock finished his sentence, his gaze going unfocused as he took this information in.
John was mumbling Sherlock’s name when he came inside Sherlock, pleasure surging through him as he rocked his hips.
“I can just…take care of that…in the bathroom.” Sherlock said, trying to sit up only to be held down by John.
(See the end of the chapter for
Paramedics and some officers had made their way into the room already. A paramedic came up to the man and Sherlock placed a blanket over them. Sherlock was grateful, as was the man, that no one was trying to pry them apart for both these men needed someone, and now seemed to have found that person.
“Would you like to come with me to Scotland Yard? Lestrade texted, there’s a case he wants me to look at.”
“Oh Sherlock…”
Sherlock hummed as he sucked, bobbing his head.
He spread some lube on his own cock before he began to prepare John.
“Can we go home now?”
“Oof, Sherlock!” John chocked out.
Comments are appreciated : )
“You…” Sherlock started.. “You love me?” He said, his eyes wide and wet, but his voice clear.
“Because you’d get mad.”
“Sherlock, I don’t—oh fuck.” John gasped, swinging his head back against the stretcher as Sherlock had swifly pulled John’s jeans down, revealing his cock pocking out from under the red panties.
John rolled his eyes and tried his best from not running into people.
“Well, yeah.” John said, confused. “I don’t really understand why you continue to work for them.”
John was now able to work three fingers into Sherlock, causing the detective to mumble against John's head.
* * *
“John?” Sherlock asked, forcing himself not to move.
Lestrade cleared his throat before speaking. “Well, lets just sail for bit shall we?”
“Oh, my apologies,” Bill said. “This is Layla, my girlfriend. Layla, the brunette, shook John’s hand, covering her smile behind her other. “And this is Emily.” Charlie said, kissing the very blushing redhead.
“Listen, Sherlock, you’ve been sulking for four whole days now,” John started, “and I know you’ve had longer periods without a case, but hear me out, Greg and I think it would be fun to…Sherlock are you listening to me?”
John saw the look on Sherlock’s face and rolled his eyes.
“I need more.” Sherlock begged.
* * *
“Do you want some tea?”
Sherlock muttered “finally” under his breath as he sat down, eyes on the horizon.
“Good morning.” John said, handing Sherlock his tea.
“For a month. But it’ll be at least a week before they start begging for my help, so no harm done.”
Once in, the sound of attention-seeking dogs engulfed John’s attention. The dogs all ranged from young to old, from miniature to almost pony-size and they all peered from behind expensive-looking cages.
“Okay, okay.” John breathed out as he blindly aligned his cock with Sherlock’s entrance.
“Oh, John.”
As the laughter subsided, Sherlock spoke. “You okay?”
“I am ready John!” Sherlock interrupted.
“How are you feeling?”
situation had caused. The feeling of Sherlock pressed so close to him, and the feeling of his soft lips begging a way into his mouth had him nearly hard. He gave in, allowing Sherlock’s tongue to slide into his mouth and the two began kissing each other; mapping out each other’s mouths.
“John!”
“Sherlock?” John said as he entered the kitchen. The state of the kitchen was not what John thought he’d see. There was no mess. The breakfast was sitting on the table, still steaming, but all the dishes that had been used were now in the sink, being washed or had already been washed, and were now drying.
“Mhm, that’s boring.”
“Where’s your gun?”
He strode by John, grabbing his arm and tugged him to follow him.
“Really?” Sherlock said, surprised at the praise.
John moaned at the intrusion, his hands clutching Sherlock’s shoulders.
“Oh, perfect. John.” Sherlock whispered before turning and roughly kissing John, his lips biting John’s hard enough for a bit of blood to soon appear. Sherlock licked the wound as he moved down John’s front, unbuttoning his shirt. Once all the buttons were undone, John swiftly took the shirt off, pulling Sherlock’s robe and shirt off very quickly after. He pulled Sherlock down and hummed at the feel of skin to skin.
“Sherlock.” John whispered, his voice rough. “I need you to—”
When John woke up the next morning, he was fully expecting a very alerted Sherlock waiting impatiently for a case to appear. When the smell of freshly made breakfast entered his senses, John was wide-awake, stumbling out of bed within seconds. As he stood up, he racked his brain for something, anything Sherlock may have done that would call upon for this kind of treatment. When nothing came to mind, he walked slowly to the kitchen.
“You…you called the police!?”
“Sherlock…” John mumbled as Sherlock moved to John’s neck, licking and sucking, determined to leave a mark.
Was one thought that went through his mind.
“I do.” Sherlock said, his tone comforting, his expression gentle.
“Its alright John. We can stop.” Sherlock assured him, before sitting up. “Let me just…” He faltered, but waved a hand to his groin. John nodded, and they both got off the couch. Before Sherlock left, he placed a kiss on John’s cheek, very close to his lips. John blushed and then sat down and waited for Sherlock to come back.
Sherlock finally got his trousers off, and was shaking slightly as he struggled to pull of his shirt while still keeping the towel on.
“I wanted to first see if the mouse had a certain spot where it liked to…sleep...forget it just let me catch it alive.”
The two men froze as the heat and lust filled the car, and then John let out a rough moan. “Move Sherlock.” He ordered.
John lied on the bed. His breathing had normalized, but he was incredibly embarrassed. The ringing of the phone was loud and abrupt, startling him, but it was the loss of contact of Sherlock that upset him and he didn’t understand why. He had been in the bedroom now for over ten minutes and the sounds of the violin from the living room were alluring. He wanted to go back to Sherlock, but he was embarrassed and he had no idea how to handle any of this. It had been years since he was in a serious-
“Mhm, its fine.” He said as he pulled the red panties back up, following by John’s jeans. He then crawled on top of John to kiss his lips. He picked up John’s bitten hand, kissing the red marks softly.
“Okay, I think we are done here.” The officer spoke, looking up at John. “Here is my card if there is anything else you feel is significant and Scotland Yard has your contact info-“ She was caught off guard by the tall skinny man who invaded the space between the officer and John and began yelling, at who John didn’t know.
He started humming the words; familiar with the beat they give but unsure where they come from. It wasn’t until he realized what he was humming under his breath:
“I’m embarrassed and annoyed that I didn’t recognize you as that man who punched me two months ago but I think that’s because you hide him. You keep that strong, military side of yourself hidden…not on purpose but because you think that that man you are isn’t needed…but I could use a friend like that…I don’t have any friends either.
“That I’m in love with you.”
“John.”
“Oh God yes.”
John’s smile grew bigger. “I know. And it’s all fine.”
“I…no I wouldn’t John!”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Not to bribe each other.”
John moaned at the salty taste as he gripped Sherlock’s cock.
Sherlock hummed, wrapping his arms around John’s shoulders. “Just finishing things off with the case. The police here were incompetent.”
Sherlock nodded, looking down at John. John looked up at Sherlock, and once their eyes met, Sherlock lowered his head, capturing John's lips roughly. John's hands moved to grasp Sherlock's arse as he kissed back, swiveling his tongue with Sherlock. Sherlock moaned as John nipped his lips.
This sudden movement caused Sherlock to turn slightly green, and before John could even regain his steady footing, Sherlock hurled his upper body over the railing, letting out last night’s dinner.
“I…sorry…” Sherlock stared, blushing furiously. Before he could get off however, he looked down at John who was as red as a tomato, his gaze averted anywhere but at Sherlock. “John…”
“You are mine.” He rasped against Sherlock’s lips before kissing his lips. “Mine.” He repeated as he moved along Sherlock’s jawbone. The taller man’s breathing grew ragged, his voice cracking as he spoke. “Yes…John…I’m yours.” He gasped loudly when John then nipped at his pulse point, before licking over the mark. John slapped a hand over Sherlock’s mouth.
“No I don’t know, so enlighten me.”
“Oh, fuck Sherlock.” He moaned, sliding a hand in between them, taking hold of both their cocks and in unison, the two began rocking. They rolled their hips and kissed messily as pleasure erupted between them.
“Oof.”
“Mhm, right, okay, lets go.” Sherlock said, blinking. He turned away and bounced down the stairs with John right behind him.
“He was the only one who liked me.”
“Oh god yes.” John giggled as he sat up straighter, capturing Sherlock’s lips with his own.
“You’re interesting to me.”
“Baker Street. I need to look over some things.”
“What is it Donavan?” The man named Lestrade said, appearing exhausted behind her.
Sherlock practically leapt onto the soda, resting his head on John’ lap.
Everything was going pleasantly until one day while out walking Marie was Sherlock put to the test. Marie suddenly began running away, causing Sherlock to lose the leash and having to chase down Marie through London. John followed as swiftly as he could and when he finally did catch up, Sherlock was yelling viciously at a young teen who was yelling back and holding Marie. When John was within earshot he heard the preteen yell for his mother and saw him turn around where a couple and young girl were walking fast up to the boy.
“Yeah, I…everything is new right now, and I-I think I’m just scared too.”
* * *
Sherlock, clearly noticing the man tense up at the arrival of the emergency vehicles, began speaking a bit urgently.
“It’s fine,” John said.
The second time John woke up it was almost seven at night. He stretched, his hangover nearly gone along with the headache, but his whole body ached and his stomach was still aching and empty. He reluctantly got out of bed and limped his way to the bathroom only to be greeted with the same sight of him from earlier. He took a deep breath; not wanting to accept this was his life he slowly prepared for a shower. It was in the shower that the realization on his finally dawned on him. He wanted to die. The scary, unsettling realization made him feel sick but the idea of ending his misery was enough for him to turn the shower off and slowly but effectively dry off and put on some cleaner clothes.
John smiled at the sentiment, and nodded. “Alright then.”
Sherlock remained where he was for the next half hour, drinking the gingerale, his hiccups slowly disappearing. About an hour later, Greg and Molly prepared the boat so they can slowly cruise along while eating lunch. Molly pulled out sandwiches, only to have Sherlock to say, “I’m not hungry.”
Sherlock fumbled slightly as he pulled himself out of his trousers and pants. He wiggled slightly and then his naked cock came into contact with John’s arse, causing John to moan slightly.
“Exactly what I said Lestrade. Other than the fact the words are adjectives describing the victim, I don’t know what other reason the killer would have in putting them their. In
“Here, let me-“ Sherlock said, his voice cracking slightly. They were only able to get his trousers and pants down to his knees before John leaned forward eagerly, lifting himself up.
“Sherlock.” John said, his voice rough and impatient.
Sherlock pulled John with him to the main hallway
As if he couldn’t get any redder, Sherlock did, his voice rough with arousal.
“John.” He said firmly.
John nodded, his throat tight, his eyes letting out the last few tears. He leaned forward, wrapping his arms around Sherlock, who stiffened at first, but then relaxed and wrapped his arms around John’s waist.
John looked over at what Sherlock was so fixed on; the screen was still at the login. John sniggered. Sherlock’s eyes snapped at him.
“You bought me something.” He stated, his eyes narrowing as he tried to deduce it.
“Oh fuck! Sherlock, oh my god…”
“Mmkay.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t worry about that, Dr. Watson.” The female officer said while finishing up her notes. John just nodded, returning his attention back to the officer.
“I…I want to feel you…against me.”
“Yes. Redbeard was named after a pirate I read about as a child and Marie was named after Marie Curie, so its only fitting we name this dog, who we have adopted as a couple, after someone who was an excellent man who helped his country and was also a genius.”
Sherlock slammed his head on the table and muttered, “Just give me something-anything will do.”
rocked side to side slightly, causing John and Sherlock to both grasp the railing.
“Why is
As he was finishing up the last cut, John took a deep breath and began speaking.
“Sher-Sherlock!” He cried out, his orgasm rushing through him. He rocked his hips into Sherlock’s mouth as he rode his orgasm out.
John, although feeling hesitant, pulled on his jacket. “What’s the case?”
“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” John said.
“John! A case! Hurry, I need to wash my hair!” Sherlock yelled, his eyes squeezed shut.
“Yeah, okay.”
“Its alright.”
This case is a bit creative and will take up about 3 chapters but John will be going through some things; so don't worry, this case is not shadowing John.
John giggled again. “Sherlock, my legs are wrapping around your waist, thus your coat is askew. Your arse is on camera.” He said again, his giggles turning into laughter.
John moaned in pleasure, the heat of Sherlock’s mouth and the cold air around him creating goose bumps along his skin. He shivered as Sherlock swallowed around his cock, the head nearly at the back of Sherlock’s throat.
John let out a shaky breath, and brought his face to his hands, taking in deep breaths. Sherlock pulled him to the side, so that his head was resting on his Sherlock’s shoulder. He found this position a bit uncomfortable but it seemed to be helping John, whose breathing was beginning to slow down and his face, once scrunched up, was relaxing, and it wasn’t until his breathing completely quiet did Sherlock realize he had fallen asleep. Sherlock gently pulled John so that he was lying on his side on the bed, his head on Sherlock’s chest, his hand clutching Sherlock’s t-shirt. Sherlock wasn’t really that tired, but the peacefulness got to him and before he knew it, he was drifting off.
John was lying in a bed after being questioned for nearly an hour. He was being admitted to stay overnight at the hospital and was required to be admitted into a rehab hospital that dealt with people like him for at least a month. After that he had no idea where he was going. And that was frightening him. That man who helped him down off the ledge, Sherlock was his name had seemed earnest in being friends and John, although he wouldn’t admit it out loud, was really looking forward to that.
John smiled widely at that, and leaned forward, pressing a deep kiss onto Sherlock.
“Mhm?” He responded.
The two rocked together, their moans enveloping the cruiser.
Sherlock’s eyes widened, his cheeks reddening.
floor, John’s unease increasing. The bing of the elevator snapped John out of his worry, and he followed Sherlock into the flat, where they met Detective Inspector Lestrade, as other personnel were about the flat, snapping photos and documenting the crime scene.
“No…I know your voice. And those things you noticed…that was like…” And it finally dawned on the man. “Do you work with the police?”
“Sherlock! Oh, Jesus, Sherlock!” John cried out, bucking his hips.
John shuffled his feet. “I was desperate. You know that. Besides, you never told me—.”
The next two months went on normally. John was quite surprised how good Sherlock was at caring for a dog, he always fed her daily meals and made sure she always got a belly rub. It was quite extraordinary to seen the detective, who was usually so harsh and kept his emotions hidden, to be really caring and joyful.
Sherlock, he saw, was curled on the sofa, in a sulk obviously, and John sighed, not at all ready for the whining and complaining for lack of murder at the moment.
Sherlock’s face scrunched up as he nodded.
“Sherlock-Sherlock what are we doing?” John asked, throwing the door closed behind him as Sherlock tugged him to the balcony.
Sherlock whimpered against him as John began to rock his hips, brushing his prostate. His hands tightened their grasp on Sherlock arse, his breathing grew ragged as he rocked into the detective.
Sherlock looked at the bottle in disgust. “It’ll sting my eyes.” He pouted.
There was a shot of cold air suddenly, startling John from his content state. He blinked opened his eyes and titled his head up slightly, catching an eyeful of the detective, currently undressing.
“Oh, John.” He moaned, leaning his forehead against John’s shoulders. “Oh, you feel so good inside me.”
John looked at Sherlock with a resigned look on his face. “I wanted some of my favorite biscuits only to find a bloody hole in the back of the box and only crumbs left.” He said, becoming more frustrated.
“Nothing. You’re just a lot smarter than you appear.”
John let out a sigh and leaned forward slowly, pressing a much more promising and sensual kiss on to Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock responded, relived for the conversation to switch topics and returned with much promise.
John woke up with a start. His cheek was stinging, and there was a heavy weight pressing into his side. Blinking away the dizziness and blurriness, John looked in front of him to see Sherlock leaning over him, panic written across his face.
“Yes.” Sherlock said, hiding a smirk.
“Oh right. I was thinking Turing.”
And so it went on. John Watson grew up, dated loads of women, rarely any serious enough to ‘meet the parents’ and had three rather long serious relationships with three different men. His parents only ever hearing about his ‘girlfriends’. John Watson kept that one secret though, deep down and never told his parents, never planned on telling them, that he was bisexual.
“Patience, John, we don’t want to be seen now do we.” Sherlock said as he pulled out a small bottle of lube.
The officers didn’t know what to do, so they scurried as Sherlock walked towards John.
John stayed seated, glancing around the flat. It felt warm, but the warmth didn’t comfort him. He felt too many things at once, causing him to feel overwhelmed the most, and within only a few minutes, John got up quickly and practically ran to the bathroom, emptying his stomach. After a few dry heaves, John stood in front of the mirror and cleaned his mouth, followed by a glass of water. The realization of what happened hit him, and he bowed his head in shame, his eyes stinging. After a few minutes, he took a deep breath and pulled out the pill bottle he was prescribed. They said to take one every morning, and so he did.
John kept shaking slightly with laughter. “I’m sorry.” He said, smiling wide.
At the feel of the tip right at Sherlock’s hole, he spoke. “Okay, slowly now Sherlock.”
“Yes, a case John. I told you they couldn’t last a week.” Sherlock said cheerfully.
Once John had finished eating, he and Sherlock made their way to Scotland Yard. Sherlock could sense John was feeling unsure, but with a nod of reassurance from him, Sherlock continued on.
“Oh, John!” Sherlock gasped, causing John to pull back slightly, slamming his hand over Sherlock’s mouth.
“What do you think?” Sherlock whispered as he pulled back, stroking John’s cock.
“Er, where are we going?” John asked as he began putting the groceries away.
“Found something?” John whispered, his hand wavering to the gun tucked in his waistband.
“Mhm, what Sh’lock?”
John kept quiet as he watched the situation unfold; Marie obviously had a previous loving family and he saw Sherlock’s anger dissolve into a something he never seen on Sherlock before: heartbreak.
“Why? Its deserted Sherlock. And it is nearly 10 pm, which you said was the time where most of Scotland Yard were out, what was it you said, ruining their already dim brains with alcohol?” He said, smirking as he shucked off his shoes.
“You agreed to come here John!” Sherlock blurted out.
John looked at Sherlock, his eyes glistening. “Sherlock I…” He paused, swallowing. He cleared his throat. “I have had nightmares for a while now Sherlock and what I found to prevent any panic attacks from happening is if I…get close with you. The sex sort of just happened. And I enjoy it. I thought you did too.”
“Yes…please.” John moaned against Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock’s lips twitched to the promise of a grin. “I do.” The grin fell and was quickly replaced by uncertainty. “Do you mind?”
As he entered the bedroom, Sherlock grabbed him, shoving him on the sofa. He then climbed over John, capturing his lips roughly. The two kissed keenly, John’s hand moving to grab Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock tasted John, the taste of tea fresh on his tongue. He swirled his tongue around John, before pulling back sharply.
“Right. Sherlock, I want you to be comfortable. Okay?” He said, kissing a kiss on the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. “Now, I’ll wear them for you. But I don’t know if I’ll like wearing them or not. Okay?”
"Yeah, that was brilliant.”  John smiled.
“T-Take your clothes off- Sh-Sherlock.” John spoke, as he slowly began undressing.
“Oh fuck, Sherlock.” John moaned, his hands tugging at Sherlock’s drenched curls.
“Sherlock, shh, its all right.” John said softly, placing a hand gently on Sherlock’s shoulder blade, caressing it. Sherlock didn’t respond, but tried taking a breath only to hiccup in the process. The shaking slowly wore out, until Sherlock was resting, half on the floor and half on John’s lap, his breathing evening out. John gently and kindly led Sherlock up from the floor and led him to the sofa. He sat down first and then brought Sherlock into his lap, his feet by the opposite end of the sofa, and his head in John’s lap.
“I’m just—We’re out of milk…and I know you like milk in your tea. So I’m just going to the store. I won’t be long.”
Sherlock then looked up, capturing John’s lips tenderly as he gently pulled himself out and lowered John back to the floor.
“John.” Sherlock said again.
“I did…sort of. I couldn’t wait any longer.” Sherlock replied. He hesitated before speaking again.
John breathed deeply before grasping Sherlock’s arse hard, lifting the taller man up. Sherlock wrapped his legs around John’s waist, resting his back against the stonewall.
John swallowed, and then stood up, kissing Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock was breathing heavily but smirked as he stroked John’s cock, causing John to gasp loudly, leaning forward on him.
“Scare me off?” John repeated, his voice cracking.
“No case. Not really.”
“John?” Sherlock said, moving towards him on the bed.
John spun around, facing the doorway, waiting. Sherlock made his way into the sitting room, his face pale, his eyes twinkling with raw emotion, his clothes rumpled.
John sighed, as he quickly rinsed his body before he climbed out of the shower.  As he was patting dry, Sherlock walked into the bathroom, already dressed in his trousers and burgundy shirt.
Sherlock huffed. “And not to feel embarrassed.”
“Now that is the question.” Sherlock said, already distracted by
John heard a shout of glee and then Sherlock was in front of him, having pulled back the curtain.
“Move.” John ordered. “Please.” He added in a whisper.
John, feeling calm, was about to speak when Sherlock unlocked the door and proceeded in.
Before Sherlock could speak, John crashed his lips against Sherlock’s. He bit and nipped at his cupid’s bow, swirling his tongue harshly with Sherlock’s, emitting a groan from the taller man.
Sherlock then made his way slowly and logically, knocked softly on the balcony door. The man flinched at the noise, his hands tightening their hold on the ledge. He sat up straighter and glanced behind his shoulder but didn’t object. Sherlock opened the door slowly. The man on the ledge didn’t ease at the intrusion but remained silent, not aggressive or in fear.
“I’m fine.” John simply stated.
“Sorry.” Sherlock said as he stepped in with John, capturing John’s lips, prohibiting him from speaking.
Sherlock smiled, and then smirked. “You know you blush a rather lot.”
Sherlock was sitting in the kitchen when John walked out of the shower, clad only in a towel wrapped around his waist. Sherlock disregarded the paper he was reading and followed John into the bedroom.
“Oh...” Sherlock gasped at the sight before diving forward, burying his face between John’s thighs.
“Here.” He said, pulling out a half empty bottle of lube.
“Er, nope.” John said simply.
“John, I was a child, but I understood that every living thing dies.” He snapped.
“Yeah…” The man said quietly, apparently in thought. “That was really…impressive….um….have we met before? Those deductions…your voice…its all sort of familiar…”
“Yes.” Sherlock simply responded, fumbling for something in his coat pocket.
“Mhm, we should—do that—“ John tried to answer back, but Sherlock’s strokes were becoming tighter and faster.
John didn’t respond, but kept his gaze lowered, his eyes betraying him and beginning to fill with tears. He didn’t want to cry in front of Sherlock and tried to hold them back, but then Sherlock placed his hand along his jaw, lifting his head up so they were face to face. The look of genuine worry and unease were written on Sherlock’s face, but it was all buried by the sudden distress that became evident when he noticed John’s eyes.
Sherlock grimaced. “We don’t have to do that do we?”
Sherlock looked unfazed. “I made you breakfast.”
“We don’t have to go any further than just kissing. We can wait until you’re ready-“
Possible Suicide about to take place at St. Reagent’s Hotel, room 805. Man on ledge. Send help.
“What-“ Sherlock huffed, his hand in between them aching at the awkward angle.
“Good luck to you, Doctor.”
“Yes.”
“No John. I don’t want to talk about this-”
“I guess, if you think you could use me…”
“Mhm, no.” Sherlock said, never taking his eyes off the file.
“Here ya go.”
Sherlock scoffed in response, and slowly sat up, his sulking mood radiating violently. He was still in his dressing gown, had been for –
“You told your mother about me?” John asked, rather amused.
Sherlock pulled off of John, before sitting back, opposite John.
“It’s a pest John.”
“Mhm, yes, now, please.” John begged, his hands holding tightly on Sherlock’s shoulders.
“Sorry-“
“Yes, John, oh, yes, John.” Sherlock whined slightly, clutching John’s hips.
John clarified. “I bought something for
“Don’t worry, Mycroft will take care of it.”
“Oh fuck, yes.” He gasped, moving his hips faster, riding Sherlock’s cock.
“Sherlock.” John said again but was cut off as Sherlock kissed him gently. When he pulled back, Sherlock eyed him up and down. “Okay?” He asked, genuine worry etched on his face.
Sherlock blinked.
John smiled, before kissing Sherlock’s lips hard, flicking his tongue into his mouth, grazing his lips. He swirled his tongue around Sherlock’s, as he rocked his hips harder.
“Er…you should talk to Sherlock about that.”
“Do you want to be friends?” He asked suddenly, causing John to suddenly shift his gaze up at Sherlock. “Because I was honest when I said I didn’t have any and thought we…” He stopped.
“I…no…”
John instantly relaxed against Sherlock, enjoying the sudden shivers that spread through his body as Sherlock’s cold hands cupped his face.
“Oh Sherlock, I’m sorry. So Marie…”
“Hurry, John.”
John huffed as he climbed on to the boat. “Just put on the sunscreen Sherlock.”
“Jesus.”
John sucked harder at the head before licking Sherlock’s cock from base to tip. He sucked and swirled his tongue, one hand massaging Sherlock’s balls, and the other gripping his arse.
“John I, I don’t do sentiment….” He began, looking up at John which he immediately regretted. John’s face looked like it was breaking and he didn’t want to see that happen so he quickly finished his thought, “John I do, I want to continue, I don’t know how to explain what I’m feeling so I started out slow but I’m sorry…don’t get mad….John I…” His rambling was caught off by John who had let out a breath of relief and had placed his hands on either side of Sherlock’s’ face.
“What’s so funny?” Sherlock whispered.
John ran his hand over his face. “That’s it. I betrayed you. That’s why you reacted that way.”
“Come on.” John said, pulling Sherlock with him to the bedroom.
“I’m hot, John.”
“Oh my god, Sherlock.” John whispered, as he began to fumble with his jeans.
“Have you done anything today Sherlock?” John asked casually, blowing on his tea.
?” The man spat out.
“No, you, put it under your jumper.”
I hope to be updating once a week : )
“You are all imbeciles! Seriously! If you had listened to me in the first place none of this would’ve happened!” The tall man went on. And on. And on. John began growing impatient, wanting to ask the female officer if there was someone, a counselor of some sort, to talk to, but the tall man kept going on, causing officers, including the one John had talked to, pull annoyed faces and mutter words that John couldn’t hear. The tall man weaved his way through the crowd like a child who had too much sugar and bumped into John multiple times. After the fourth shove by the tall man, John lost his patience completely and snapped.
“Of course.” Sherlock said simply, as he leaned his weight over John so that he can removed his hands slightly enough to pour lube onto his hand.
“What do you do after waking from a nightmare?”
Sherlock looked at him fiercely for a moment, then his face softened slowly, the aggravation being replaced by confusion. He furrowed his eyebrows.
“They’re from a song. Listen,” he said, walking to the computer and typing the song into the browser.
“Inspector.” Sherlock said.
John followed and was about to speak when Sherlock pressed level 8, instead of the first level. They were on level 7.
* * *
Sherlock didn’t need to be told twice. He slowly moved his hips enough for John to get a rhythm. John’s eyes blew open as Sherlock’s cock brushed his prostate.
Sherlock kept quiet at he studied John’s face.
As his orgasm faded down, John began to the notice the loud shouting from outside the ambulance.
Sherlock stared, unsure what to do.
“Hurry.” John said, his voice rough.
“Oh fuck Sherlock!” John yelled. “Oh Sherlock I’m going-“ He tried to speak, his orgasm coming in full blast cutting him off. He came hard; his come splattering on his and Sherlock’s clothes. Sherlock came right then, falling forward on top of John, who fell backwards onto the desk.
“I don’t understand.” John lowered his head.
Sherlock merely glared John.
Sherlock moaned beneath him, withering.
“Sherlock, I—”
“ Make me.”
John gently let go Sherlock’s softening cock as he licked at the mark he made under his ear. Sherlock hummed at the gentleness, kissing the mark he left on John’s neck.
John’s smile, which had only begun growing, faltered slightly, the gleam in his eyes dissipating. He tried to recover from that abrupt question but Sherlock caught his shift in emotion and realised what he had asked must’ve sounded harsher than he meant and so he quickly recuperated.
“I can take care of it.” John sputtered out. “I mean…if you want me to.”
* * *
Sherlock pulled off, and sucked the head of John’s now completely erected cock. He hummed as he sucked, one hand moving to cradle and massage John’s balls.
A giggled erupted from John suddenly his body shaking slightly he squirmed underneath Sherlock’s body. Sherlock didn’t move, but stayed laying on top of John’s, his head resting on John’s chest as a deep laugh vibrating from his throat.
“Not yet, love.”
John gulped. The pills were identical as were the bottles.
John chuckled lightly. “No, no, we don’t. But I think…” he trailed off, suddenly feeling like he was going in too deep. But Sherlock was looking at him, waiting and expecting him to continue. John breathed in slowly and then exhaled.
Sherlock remained quiet however and after about 10 minutes did John finally speak up.
Sherlock’s orgasm erupted, white-hot pleasure flowing through him as he rocked into John’s mouth.
John followed Sherlock up the seventeen steps into 221B. Upon entering the new flat, he looked around, noticing the flat looked a bit messy, but still welcoming.
“Sherlock…I…I need you to fuck me.” John moaned as Sherlock’s hand stroked their cocks together.
“Ah, hello John,” Sherlock said, pretending to be dismissive.
The two men nodded and slowly made their way out.
“You alright?” John asked.
“And now here is the fun part,” The cabbie spoke again, startling John. “Whatever pill you choose, I take the other and we both take our medicine.”
“Do you want to...talk...?”
“Were you at that school where that cabbie was caught two months ago?”
“What do you mean? Like…bondage…or fantasies?”
John followed Sherlock through the officers in the hotel’s hallway.
“You want me to suck you?”
“Mhm…are you sure?”
As those words were taken in by Sherlock, his eyes started darting around the living room, cancelling out things that didn’t belong to John and so on. When a list of possible things came to mind, Sherlock started typing, only to end with a huff and a slam of his head on the table.
“We will go further when you’re ready.”
Sherlock’s body quivered as he let out a shout.
“Its just…” John leaned up to Sherlock’s ear. “Why do you work for these people when they aren’t treating you very nicely…?” He whispered so only Sherlock could hear.
“Sherlock—oh, Sherlock.” He groaned as he swung his head back, knocking it against the window. “Oh fuck, yes, Sherlock. Harder. OH!” He gasped, as Sherlock sucked his neck hard.
“They’re all dead…or overseas.”
“John.” Sherlock suddenly blurted out, roughly pulling at John’s hair.
“John.” Sherlock groaned slightly as he began to rock his hips.
John stared at him. “So then why are you upset? Is it just because I didn’t tell you? You didn’t tell me you had a drug problem—.”
Sherlock smirked, kissing away the mock pout forming on John’s face.
John grinned as he pulled back, dropping his towel. He pulled out the panties—
“Sherlock…” John said, suddenly nervous.
“You—” he started, “You actually care.” He stated.
Sherlock looked over at John once to make sure he was indeed alright, and then turned back to Lestrade.
“Thanks mate.” John responded, and made his way back to Sherlock who was now on the floor, letting out heavy breaths, his voice ragged from the retching.
John stroked Sherlock sweaty curls as he gently kissed his temple. Sherlock hummed as he gently pulled himself off. He slid to the side, resting his head on John’s shoulder, his hand coming to rest on John’s come splattered stomach. John turned his head slightly as he removed the blindfold. He blinked against the light from the setting sun and then moved Sherlock’s blindfold off.
“Victim is Emily Glenn Bass, CEO of Bass Industries.” Lestrade said. “Very, very rich. And very, very popular. Her company has done some charity work as well as improvements for the education system. She was a frequent churchgoer. Her daughter, Erica, found her.”
Sherlock snapped his head up, his eyes now adjusting to the fact that John wasn’t on the floor anymore, and he flushed harder, the summer heat doing no help for his and John’s arousal. He cleared his throat, trying to provide any answer when John causally walked over to him.
* * *
John moved his face so that he was hiding behind Sherlock’s shoulder. He giggled slightly before responding.
“Come with me Sherlock…I’m close.” John whispered.
“But you shouldn’t be!” John blurted out in a rushed whisper. “I…I don’t like what they’re saying about you.”
“Mhm.”
John sucked a mark on Sherlock’s neck, his hands gripping Sherlock’s arse tightly underneath his coat. The two men were both breathing heavily now, their bodies trembling slightly as Sherlock aligned his cock with John’s entrance.
* * *
These officers are trying to do their job and you getting in the way shouting at them isn’t going to get
“Ah, John, perfect timing. Come on.” Sherlock said, pulling on his coat.
“Come on John!” Sherlock yelled enthusiastically. He ran down the hallway, John right behind him as they got outside, only to have two cop cars waiting. Sherlock stopped in his tracks as Lestrade exited one, an annoyed look on his face.
-get seasick.”
“No, that’s clear. I just…why?”
“John.”
“Yes, I know the list…but the case?
Sherlock let out a loud groan. “John!” His voice wavered as he bucked his hips.
“Choose what?”
When they broke apart, they giggled, and relaxed into each, John’s arms around Sherlock’s neck, Sherlock’s arms tightly held John’s waist and they kissed again, this time much more passionate, tasting each other, their breathing turning ragged, and a few more tears may have leaked.
“Oh, wow, thank you, sir.”
It wasn’t long before Sherlock came, followed right away by John, their cum mixing as Sherlock slumped forward onto John, who wrapped his arms around Sherlock as they caught their breath.
Sherlock didn’t reply, but walked over to the mouse trap lying on the table. “And you expect to catch one with
“Sherlock, please, I’m only trying to help. Did having Marie rekindle some memoires of Redbeard?”
“We had a case a couple of months ago, unsolved, the victim was found in her flat, with large, ragged cuts on her back. Doors locked. Black words were written along the books in her bookshelf.”
“Sherlock…”
Sherlock scoffed. “I’m not embarrassed.”
John then sat up. “I think its bout time for tea, don’t you? And some dinner.”
“Sherlock listen to me. The words on the bookcase. It’s from a fairytale.” John sputtered out as he was catching his breath.
“Shh, its okay Sherlock. You don’t need to be snappy. I just want to make sure you’re ready and that you’re comfortable.”
“Excuse me!” the man yelled, causing John and Sherlock to break apart. Startled, Sherlock slipped out of John and fell onto the floor.
It was early. Too early for his liking, but he had agreed to John’s idea of a something fun. Sherlock sat in the taxi with John, on their way to the dock to meet Greg, whose brother leant him his sailboat. Sherlock stared out the window, deep in thought. He couldn’t deduce any passerby for it was so early; it was too foggy to see even if there
John sat down next to Sherlock as they resumed sailing.
That caught the man off guard for a second. “Wha-why? Why am I interesting to you?” The man let out quickly.
Sherlock huffed, about to speak when John nudged him.
The man didn’t know what to say but turned slightly to look at Sherlock for the first time. Their eyes met but neither of them moving. The man was breathing slightly uneven, his eyes glistening and tears falling down his face. The man gulped but didn’t move. Sherlock took this opportunity to ask,
Sherlock’s cheeks somehow turned more red, and he swiftly followed John into the bathroom.
John blushed and with a look of desire from Sherlock, he slid Sherlock’s pants down and started doing what he’s wanted to do for a long time to
John felt he was in a daze as Sherlock inserted a finger, massaging him gently open. Soon, he had two fingers in him, and as they brushed his prostate, Sherlock put his mouth back on John’s cock, sucking and licking him into oblivion.
“Okay?” John asked quietly, pulling back and resting his forehead on Sherlock’s.
John hesitated, then clicked the safety on, checked to make sure it was loaded, and then placed it in the waistband under his jumper. He then followed Sherlock out of the flat.
“Who would want to be my friend? I’m not interesting…or impressive like you”
John gritted his teeth. “Yes, yes you did. What are we
Finally, the silence was broken.
“Where are we going?” John asked.
John’s eyes were twinkling as he laughed and Sherlock felt a sudden urge to kiss him. He fell forward, meeting John’s lips gently. The two men kissed chastely, the moment broken when a loud yell came from above them.
“What, why?”
“Could we step outside for a moment?” John said, tensely. Sherlock’s answer caught in his throat, so he nodded. John pulled him along, completely ignoring the distasteful stares he got from the surrounding crowd.
Sherlock then went back to room, collecting some fresh pajamas for John and placed them on top the sink. Upon entering the bathroom, John was already in the shower.
John blinked at the light as he fumbling with his pants and jeans.
“When we get home we can go further if you want.” He whispered against Sherlock’s neck.
“Oh, fuck, mhm, yes, okay, okay, Sherlock, please, now. I’m ready.” John panted, his legs trembling.
“Does he have an alibi?”
“Yes.” Sherlock said with certainty, “At night.” He added under his breath.
“Sherlock…” John pouted.
John shook his head, his lips quivering. He wasn’t crying, his eyes practically dry, but his forehead was gleaming with sweat, and his body was slightly trembling.
After unpacking John’s things, the two sat on the sofa, John half watching the telly and Sherlock not at all. Sherlock was lying down, his head in John’s lap, which allowed John to place his right hand in his bed of curls, slightly stroking them, making random patterns. The ringing of a phone, which startled John, interrupted the peacefulness. Sherlock practically leapt from the sofa to retrieve the phone out of habit and it wasn’t until he turned back around, phone in hand, did he realise what had happened. John was still sitting, but he was breathing faster, his eyes closed tightly, his left hand clutching the arm of the sofa.
“I thought I said you needed to be quiet.”
John sat in the office of the detective inspector – Lestrade – his hands handcuffed in front of him. After turning in his not so legal gun in he was detained and then sent to the DI’s office. It wasn’t long until the DI himself entered.
The look on John’s face was one of confusion, for Sherlock sighed loudly.
John tiredly made his way up the seventeen stairs into 221b Baker Street, nearly dragging his duffel bag as he walked into the sitting.
Sherlock worked his fingers in. He worked in a third and soon John was breathing heavily against him.
“Tired?” John asked softly.
John gasped as Sherlock’s cock brushed his prostate, burying his face into Sherlock’s neck. The boat rocked with their movements, but two men were unaware of the world around them. They rocked together, each other’s names whispered out as they quickly reached climax.
Sherlock smiled back, the air in the room turning silently as the two stared at each other. They were brought back to the present with the awkward cough from the inspector.
“When was it?”
Sherlock collected John’s soiled clothes and the sheets and headed to the washer, placing them inside. When he went back up stairs, the shower was turned off. He walked past the bathroom and remade the bed with clean sheets from the hall closet.
“Sit right here,” Lestrade said, leading them to the stern of the boat, where the was a small sitting area lower slightly than the whole deck. Molly came by quickly handing towels to them, and soon John and Sherlock were huddled together in a bundle of blankets.
“Not now Lestrade.” Sherlock smirked, as he walked quickly, tugging John with him.
John’s eyes widened slightly, and he looked away. He nodded.
And at that, Sherlock remembered this man. He couldn’t remember his name but he remembered him, the man who had surprised him not with the punch but the words that were said to him after the punch:
3 hours later
Sherlock then lifted John’s arse off the stretcher, taking even more, moans and hums escaping his throat.
“Oh, Sherlock, careful. I don’t want you to slip.” John muttered out as Sherlock moved to his neck, gently nipping and sucking at his pulse.
Before he could finish his rambling sentence, the door swung open, and a disheveled and bleeding Sherlock stood in the doorway.
John smiled. “Okay…” He paused, looking around. “We need lube.”
“I’m sorry, I don’t want to upset you but I think you haven’t been dealing with the nightmares the best way and I think we should work together to do that.”
“John!”
any people out. He went back to what he was thinking yesterday before John had interrupted him. He was thinking of John, obviously, and was trying to and failing in remembering when he started getting the fluttering sensation in his lower abdomen. These thoughts about his straight flatmate had only led him in an intense sexual fantasy that left him hard and snappy when the actual man had interrupted him, leaving him hard and causing him to sit rather tight and uncomfortable while John persuaded him to go sailing with him and Greg. That’s been happening a lot, getting hard whenever John entered his mind, or worse, his vision. Maybe with the intense cold air, he wouldn’t this time.
'You did this on purpose, didn't you? You made us wonder the woods without knowing where we're going- oh, I'm sorry,
John tentatively grabbed Sherlock's cock, trying to remember every blowjob he'd ever got, but his brain seemed to freeze. Sherlock's hand gently stroked his hair and John parted his lips, licking the clear fluid from the slit. Sherlock gasped and John felt a wave of adrenalin go through his system. Boldly, he wrapped his lips around the head and stroked the frenulum with his tongue. Sherlock shuddered, fingers twitching against John's scalp, then tugging sharply as John accidentally grazed him with his teeth.
'Are we going to stop anytime soon or do you propose we wonder the woods aimlessly and hope for a divine sign?'
“John,” Sherlock murmured, like a prayer, but he couldn't tell what he was praying for. John seemed to know regardless, as he pressed himself flush with Sherlock and sucked eagerly at his pulse point. Sherlock very nearly screamed.
, he had every right to peek...
“Happy Birthday, Sherlock!” She said jovially, ignoring the smoke and heading straight towards the scowling man. “I baked you your favourite, chocolate fudge!”
'John, for God's sake let me in!'
He managed after a few tries, working the tight ring of muscles in circular motions. It wasn't uncomfortably tight, but Sherlock did grunt this time as John pushed all the way in. John stilled his hand and stroked Sherlock's flank a few times, until the detective started to push back against him again. John picked up his pace, massaging, thrusting and scissoring his fingers inside Sherlock, hitting his sweet spot every couple of passes.
She turned to John, who nodded numbly. He recalled an argument about tobacco ash and deerstalkers and smiled fondly at the memory.
"Did you get all that from the Internet?"
'John, did you hear that? Wolves are fascinating creatures and in these woods they grow bigger and stronger, because of the climate.'
“Sorry,” John mumbled and tried again, this time mindful of his teeth. He tried using his hand on the base to create some sort of rhythm, but when he felt Sherlock's cock hit the back of his throat, he choked and had to back off.
'The cleaning lady had it coming...' Sherlock offered, lifting his gaze to look at John.
"Y-yes, yes, fine, everything's fine."
It was John who hissed as he breached Sherlock, watching his finger disappear into that yielding passage. Sherlock just pushed against him and arched his back, sighing and guiding John deeper.
? I can't believe you're actually saying this...'
look away from that blinding smile.
"Let's see now..."
John threw his hands in the air and resumed his pacing. There was a loud, crackling thunder and the birds scattered from the nearby trees in a flutter of wings.
'I don't plan on hurting you, you git,' John was only mildly comforted to note the condoms were lubricated. His cock jumped in spite of his conscience at the thought of being buried in Sherlock's tight heat, so John sighed and spit on his fingers. 'Turn over.'
'No, it was kind of them not to look for me. The housemaids would always pack me food and some of my equipment whenever I felt like disappearing, and everyone was glad I wasn't underfoot. I found nature infinitely more fascinating than the mansion,' Sherlock added. John was still not convinced that it was alright to leave unsupervised children in an uncontrolled environment, but he supposed Sherlock's upbringing had to have been as unconventional as the man himself.
“John...”
'Fine. I'm sorry for getting us kicked out of the hotel and for insulting you.'
Sherlock sucked his lower lip into his mouth and spread his other hand on John's chest, moving slowly towards the bulge in his jeans. When John gasped he leaned down and brushed his lips to John's chastely, then again, a little slower, until John moaned and grabbed the back of his neck, pulling him in for a deeper kiss.
'But she
'The soles of quality high heels are better than those of certain brands of trainers, including yours,' Sherlock deadpanned.
"Payment," Sherlock answered and nibbled John's collarbone. "You should send a thank-you gift too."
Sherlock was quick as lightning. In one fluid motion he grabbed his bag from next to him and, just as the dog was charging towards John, he swung the bag at it, effectively sending it a few feet backwards. The beast was quicker, though, and charged again faster than Sherlock could duck. A deafening crack and a pained howl were all he could hear before he saw the dog crumble to the ground, a bloody wound in its side.
'Shut up,' John said weakly and threw the tent at Sherlock.
“Bed, now.”
'Bored?! We were almost fucking killed by a fucking rabid hound! Is this exciting enough for you?!'
“Are you crazy? Do you think I give a fuck about you being gay or whatever, just because Bill and Terry like to make stupid jokes?” John shook his head and put a hand on Sherlock's shoulder. He could feel the younger man tense under his touch, so he slowly pulled his hand back, but his tone was firm when he said, “Sherlock, I don't care. Seriously, it's fine, it's all fine. And anyway, it would be a bit hypocritical of me, you know, considering...”
Sherlock closed his eyes and rested his head against the headboard. This was a conversation he was most definitely not ready to have, least of all with John. When the latter returned with a pack of ice and a frown, Sherlock knew it was inevitable.
Sherlock broke their kiss for air and John let out a small chuckle. His anger had dissolved into that kiss, transfigured into hot desire. The detective smiled, kissing John's nose, his brow, the shell of his ear, then moving lower down his jaw and neck, pausing to nibble at his pulse point. John closed his eyes, exposing more of himself for Sherlock's agile mouth.
“Uh... I meant my sister, Sherlock. She's a lesbian, remember?” John tilted his head in confusion.
'Get under the cover, we'll share the heat,' John offered, already half-asleep. He jumped a little as Sherlock's cold feet came in contact with his own, but he shortly grew accustomed to the long body pressed against his left side. Sherlock was lying on his back, his arms wrapped around his torso, his teeth clattering.
'You know, this is sort of brilliant, actually,' John said when they stopped to drink from a gill. 'This whole being lost thing, it's pretty fun.'
, that he was growing familiar to Sherlock's comforting weight draped across his back, and he never wanted to move ever again.
"Spare me the sentimental expose Lestrade, I'm here for the case."
, as it were."
John was happy that he hadn't lost his touch when the hand that Sherlock had fisted into the sheets came up to John's head. The detective tried to say something, but all he could manage were a few broken syllables. John nodded anyway and Sherlock's hand tightened, holding John's head in place as he came down his throat, eyes shut tightly, stoic face crumbling with pleasure. John choked a little but managed to swallow most of it down. His hands stroked Sherlock's twitching thighs, his thumbs tracing the soft skin along Sherlock's iliac wings, down his pubis, inching lower...
'You know what, maybe I will get a new flatmate!'
Then, as time went, his interventions began to vary in topic.
“Hold on, I'll get you some ice for that. Jesus, who did you piss off this time?”
'Yes?' John replied coyly, tracing his index finger around Sherlock's rim. He was relaxed from his orgasm, wet from John's tongue, and John's finger went in easily to the first knuckle. 'Is this what you want?'
“As long as you keep any... experiments to your side of the room, it's fine with me.”
“Don't be silly, John,” Sherlock chided and put the cigarette in a strange contraption sitting on his desk. John watched in fascination as the strange mechanism came to life at Sherlock's gentle prodding and the cigarette was now smoked by a sort of air pump.
'You said yourself this was fun. Would you have been happier on a perfectly safe, perfectly boring trip with
'What for? Well how should I know, you're the one making me apologize!'
Utterly spent, Sherlock collapsed on the mattress. John's leg had started cramping and fatigue was finally catching up with him. He rolled to the side with a groan, pulling off his condom, and he felt Sherlock turning away from the wet spot to curl around him. John realized with a start that this was becoming a
“If you plan on getting me a present, don't,” Sherlock said sternly from behind his laptop screen. John stopped dead in his tracks, one arm caught in his jacket and the other fumbling with his scarf.
"Good day then, Devin. Alex."
"Yes, yes, I remember." Sherlock waved a hand impatiently. "Expect it later this evening."
'Fine!'
"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I am here to change your life!"
“Bullshit,” John said simply.
“What do they normally say?”
John clasped his hand firmly and smiled in return. Sherlock suddenly didn't feel so adverse to sharing his room with this man.
'Sherlock, we should get up,' John whispered.
'That would not be advisable,' Sherlock acquiesced. 'We could follow the stream, but there was a rather large waterfall down the road, from what I recall. It would be difficult, if not impossible to continue towards the nearest town.'
“John...” Sherlock said more insistently, the warning tone making John pause.
It was Sherlock's turn to laugh.
'So, what's your plan?' John looked up towards the winding road. There was a mass of felled trees uphill, another result of the storm, their sharp, broken branches poking out menacingly.
"What was that?"
It was worse than he could have imagined. He hoped Mrs. Hudson didn't see any of it. It was positively horrendous!
"A more... what exactly do you mean?" John dreaded the answer to his question.
“Sherlock!” John definitely did scream then, head falling back and hitting the headboard. He could feel Sherlock's smug smile as he took him deeper, and John's hands instinctively fisted into Sherlock's dark curls. He loosened his grip at Sherlock's warning growl, stroking his scalp apologetically. He could already feel the heat in his lower abdomen, the tightening of his balls, and he knew that he had to stop or things would be over far too quickly.
Sherlock caressed John's cheek with his thumb, tracing his lips before moving to cup the back of his neck. John's gaze dropped under the scrutiny of those green eyes (so green, weren't they supposed to be blue or gray?) and took in the perfect lips, so full, so beautifully arched, slightly parted, so close...
"John, how do you feel about the contents of their website?"
“I am studying various types of tobacco ash, the different colours and textures, as well as their burning speed and smoke colour.”
'Then perhaps you should get a normal flatmate.'
'Oh, no. It was your orientation skills which brought us here in the first place. I do believe we should follow my lead this time, hmm?'
It turned out the serial killer was a salesman with a psychotic disorder and a fascination for Tchaikovsky. Sherlock solved the case in less than three hours and the papers were demanding interviews and photo shoots with the rehabilitated hero and his "partner".
“Oh, of course! Someone in your family has a drinking problem, probably requires special care and treatment, and you help out the only way you can.”
'Off, now!' John glowered and Sherlock struggled to comply. He left John's mouth long enough to pull his shirt over his head, then attacked a rosy nipple with his lips.
He turned to face Sherlock, who remained silent still. He crossed his arms, averting his gaze and studying the dead beast.
"Well... no, but-"
"I think I left my thumbs in the bathroom, I'll be right back."
“Happy New Year, John,” Sherlock said instead, then did a double take. “Oh, I'm sorry about your sister.”
'No.'
"So, you know, you can... take it down now."
'Please, what, Sherlock?' John's voice was hoarse as he traced Sherlock's balls lightly. Sherlock squirmed. 'What more do you want?'
"Thorough research and observation are essential, John. You seemed to enjoy the fruits of my labor."
The way Sherlock said his name made John look up at him. There was something both commanding and pleading in his voice, something so raw it never failed to capture the doctor's attention.
He didn't look all genuine, but John was too tired to care so he let Sherlock in.
“Ash is important,” Sherlock replied, “and you're not supposed to be here anyway. You were supposed to be on holiday.”
John snorted, pulling Sherlock's hand and lacing their fingers. He was ridiculously proud of himself, for pulling those wonderful sounds from Sherlock, for making him come undone, for being brave enough to trust his instincts and wise enough to stick with this maddening, wonderful genius, his Sherlock, the one who drove him up the wall and pushed him to be better, the one he cared about more than anyone else, so much it scared him, so much it hurt, with all his heart.
He was wrong.
"Yes, you've seen the benefits of having devoted fans on the Internet."
“Thank you,” he said grudgingly, “but as you can see, I'm busy.”
'Go on, where do you deduce we are?'
It was all Sherlock's fault, of course, for being such an irresponsible child all the time, but it didn't make John feel any better. No, in fact, having to babysit the consulting five-year-old was an even harder task while outside, in the middle of a bloody forest, in bloody Romania. In the rain.
John's voice was so low Sherlock had to strain to hear it, especially with the loud ringing in his ears. That had been a good punch.
"Sherlock, come and see this!"
Sherlock opened the window, but made no attempt to clear the smoke or put out his cigarette. Instead, he pulled his laptop closer and typed something up, before taking another long drag.
"How's it going guys?"
Later, John came back to the tent looking paler than Sherlock deemed normal, even with a lack of nourishing breakfast and fresh coffee. Before he could ask what was wrong, John pulled back the curtain at the entrance of the tent, gesturing towards the steep slope that lead to the road. The slope was steeper than he remembered, and a quick look-around confirmed that the storm had created a landslide, wiping a large portion of the road and stopping miraculously short of their tent. How they had slept through it was no great mystery, as the emotional and physical toll of yesterday had clearly exhausted them.
'This, at least, is more interesting than sitting in our pretty little hotel room, taking long walks around the pond and chatting up strangers! What were you thinking, coming out here, arranging a 'vacation', planning little 'hiking trips' with your 'experienced outdoor guide' Adele. Who's playing campers? I at least had the decency of making it an authentic trip, more or less.'
“Sherlock, please. If you're sick or anything, maybe I could help. I am a doctor, well, almost...” John carefully sat on the edge of Sherlock's bed, but didn't dare check for a fever.
'John, please.'
John made exaggerated hand gestures in attempt to clear the thick smoke, but it was no use.
'Good.'
'Anything!' John arched up and shuddered as his groin pressed against a strong thigh.
Sherlock seemed to consider the question for a few moments before answering.
"What is
'Only room available.'
They walked in silence until sunset. Somehow, they were still inside the woods and had to settle for yet another night in the tent. John was disappointed in this lack of progress, but at least they managed to find themselves closer to that stream (or was it a different one? He had no idea). Sherlock took it upon himself to set up the tent this time, and John was content to lie back and watch him struggle with the task. He was quite the fast learner, managing to finish in ten minutes. The look of utter satisfaction as he stepped back to appreciate his own handiwork warmed John's heart to no end, and he went inside to prepare for bed.
John realized he was supposed to give some sort of answer but all he could do was stare at that mouth and imagine running his tongue over the pale lips until they were red and wet and-
Sherlock wrapped himself tighter in his dressing gown and curled up on his bed, facing the wall.
"Quite."
Here John paused to glare at Sherlock again, only to find him feigning interest in a particularly large snail, making its way towards his right shoe.
"Look, we might not... that is, Sherlock isn't as... successful as he once was, but he's just got back, I mean... it's a bit rough at the moment, but-"
'Morning,' John replied, pulling back a little. He felt Sherlock tightening his hold for a moment before letting his arms fall down. He was reluctant to let go of the warm hip, but Sherlock rolled over languidly and pillowed his head on his hands.
Sherlock could feel his own orgasm building up rapidly, John's sharp thrusts proving to be surprisingly accurate. As John tweaked one of his nipples, he sneaked a hand between them to fist at his neglected erection and clenched his muscles around John. The other man gave a surprised shout and his thrusts became more erratic as Sherlock got closer and closer to the edge.
John stormed in the tent with as much dignity as he could muster, considering he had to crawl inside through the mud. Sherlock picked up his bag and stormed off towards the stream, the effect not quite as dramatic without his coat.
here, if it's such a horrible place?”
“Oh, if that's the worst thing about you, John Watson, I expect we'll get along just fine.”
'Move,' came Sherlock's grunt. So John carefully pulled out and then pressed in again, slowly and steadily, holding himself tightly at the hilt.
'Doctor,' John corrected, wriggling his fingers suggestively and tilting his head back for a kiss. Sherlock's laugh was light and merry and John thought that, of all the sounds he'd coaxed out of Sherlock, that one was his favourite.
"Is that so? How terrible. John, you know I would never-"
"What was that all about?" John demanded.
"Sherlock, it's great to see you again-"
John sighed, taking another good look around.
'Look, that tree there has been struck by lightning. You know, there is a big chance of us getting struck if you're planning to settle on that plateau there.'
John's laugh was clear and merry, like summer rain. Sherlock couldn't help but join in.
'I'm sorry.'
"Apologies," John bowed and snatched the laptop from Sherlock. "Should I really send it though?"
'Don't move,' Sherlock said steadily. 'And whatever you do, don't let it bite you.'
“Oh for- GO AWAY!!!”
'Please,' Sherlock keened, raising his head to throw John an absolutely wild look. John's mouth was dry.
As John leaned in to inspect his eye more closely, Sherlock sighed and patiently endured John's careful prodding.
Panting, John fell half on top of Sherlock, and neither felt too inclined to move, even as their sweat and seed were rapidly cooling in the gentle February breeze.
'I need to get some sleep. Get out.'
“I doubt you can see much in here, though,” John put the kettle on and once again scrunched up his nose as he saw Sherlock reach for his lighter again.
Sherlock's voice became a bit sharper and John narrowed his eyes.
John used one hand to pin Sherlock's writhing hip to the bed and the other to hold the base of his cock tightly as his lips moved over the shaft, flicking his tongue at the slit and circling the sensitive crown. John swallowed him down and used the free hand to pump his own neglected cock. He could feel Sherlock's quivering thighs as John's moaning added to the sensation.
Without thinking, Sherlock cupped John's face in both hands and adjusted the angle, so he could deepen the kiss. It was John's turn to moan, and he temporarily lost his balance, propping his hand on Sherlock's knee. Impatient, Sherlock pulled John on his lap and felt the older man's fingers gently tugging at his hair.
"Bed?"
“I know.” Sherlock narrows his eyes and then flops back on his bed.
Sherlock suddenly sprung back up, steepling his fingers under his chin and focusing once again on John.
John looked at him and was a little afraid of the mischief lurking in those blue-green eyes.
“You were right, spot on actually. I do get a monthly cheque, but that money... has to go elsewhere.”
“Your lab coat is peaking out of your bag, and you have a stethoscope keychain, obvious. You were also on the College's website, listed as the third ranking student of your year. Now, you're obviously not rich, judging by your tattered duffel bag and appalling jumper, but the College allots special funds for students like you, for accommodations and such, so I'll ask you again: what are you doing here?”
John looked at it for moment before he spoke. “Sherlock, this is five pages...front and back!”
“I…I think I heard something.”
John followed right behind. “Can’t we just pick one? There are enough here Sherlock.”
John grinned. “I know. I don’t see how that’s concerning.”
“Sherlock…?”
"Alright, fine, she can stay, if it is alright with Mrs. Hudson-
“Why…do you want to be friends?”
Sherlock looked up, his breathing finally somewhat normalized. “You think so?”, his eyebrow quirking up.
“Mhm, more.” John ordered.
“Sherlock, slow down!”
“You were able to take Kent down. I could’ve been injured and you stopped that from happening. So thank you.” Sherlock said, quietly.
The two broke apart, and without a need to speak, turned around, hand in hand, and made their way home.
The room was exactly has it been before the guest had checked in. Sherlock looked around the room and there was almost nothing revealing that someone had checked out this room. Almost. There was an imprint of a body on the bed although the bed was fully and professionally made which indicated the person might’ve been to tired to actually get into bed. That possibility disappeared from his mind when his eyes fell on the figure outside on the balcony, not standing, but sitting on the ledge. Sherlock was caught off guard and for longer than he would admit, his brain froze. He had no idea what to do. He looked around and found nothing else relating to the man apart from what was clearly a suicide note on the small table in the corner. After he regained his senses, Sherlock pulled out his phone and sent a text to Lestrade.
“I will. I always do.”
He didn’t have to wait much longer when he heard the soft click of the front door, followed by the very distinct footsteps of John, carrying two—no three—bags of groceries.
“Yeah…yeah I did…it was…fuck…you were so arrogant but so right.” The man said, looking up at the sky, trying to blink back his tears.. “Shit, I’m sorry.”
“Oh, I see.” He said, and then looked at Sherlock, who was more confused than ever.
“I was doing
Sherlock pouted. “I want..”
“Are you sure? I don’t know if I can be of much help…”
When Sherlock saw John enter the sitting room, his cheeks blushing, he himself began to blush as he eyed John lustfully.
“You…you had initiated it John! You were in control! We could’ve moved. Why didn’t you say anything?”
“Sherlock…” John whispered. Sherlock crawled forward slightly, keeping a hand lazily stroking John’s cock. He placed soft kisses along John’s jaw, avoiding his lips. He moved along his ear, to his neck, back up to his cheek, causing John to wriggle in frustration.
“I want to make you cum.” He said, his voice rough with arousal.
“Honestly, Lestrade. You call yourself an inspector.” Sherlock snapped as the culprit was taken away.
“How’s your throat.”
Sherlock stood up swiftly, and ignoring John’s plea, spoke his deductions out loud. “You went on a three and half day trip to visit your parents. You were at first pleased to see them, but that quickly went away with their pestering about you and a lack of a wife. They pleaded with you about their age and how they have no grandchildren and proceeded in making you feel guilty. They didn’t even mention Harry or how sober she’s been or how she and Clara are back together and are expecting a baby. You got tired after only the first day, but had to stay because you had initially told them you’d be staying three days. Really John, you
ERROR
John thought gleefully. And an idea came to him, lighting him up.
“Alright you two come on.” Lestrade said, leading them to the cop car.
“I don’t
“Sherlock-” John began but was caught off when Sherlock stopped suddenly, tugging John inside a room. “Sher-” He tried again, only to be shoved against a desk, the feeling of Sherlock’s lips against his, completely stopping his train of thought.
John huffed, his face reddening even more. He continued to rock his hips, as Sherlock bucked his hips forward, stroking his cock.
Both phone and keys fell to the ground with a resounding crack as his frame had crashed into a sturdy one that caught them surprisingly well despite the sudden motion. An arm wrapped about his waist for balance, cursing his shorter height then gazing up to the man who had saved them a bloody nose. He was impressed by the quick reflexes. Though it should not have come as a surprise, after all, it was a Holmes; the older one to be precise.
It made the blonde blink his irises briefly then shook his head as he pushed the dog into Mycroft’s arms unceremoniously to cause the pup to lap at his face and the redhead looking indignant, “What on earth?!”
“I see. I literally caught you at a bad time.” His expression calm, neutral as it normally was when they spoke on the brief occasions they did. It was always more of a conversation over the phone or small vague text messages that Greg had to consult with John to understand. The shorter doctor was the only one who could understand the cryptic ways of the Holmes brothers and he was slowly discovering that himself of the older one after years with the younger.
